utility (value-based) format. The incremental costs (Medicare) of therapy versus 
no therapy were integrated with the value gain conferred by the telescope 
prosthesis to assess its average cost-utility. The incremental value gains and 
incremental costs of therapy referent to (1) a fellow eye cohort and (2) a 
fellow eye cohort of those who underwent intra-study cataract surgery were 
integrated in incremental cost-utility analyses. All value outcomes and costs 
were discounted at a 3% annual rate, as per the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in 
Health and Medicine.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparative effectiveness was quantified using the (1) 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain and (2) percent human value gain 
(improvement in quality of life). The QALY gain was integrated with incremental 
costs into the cost-utility ratio ($/QALY, or US dollars expended per QALY 
gained).
RESULTS: The mean, discounted QALY gain associated with use of the telescope 
prosthesis over 12 years was 0.7577. When the QALY loss of 0.0004 attributable 
to the adverse events was factored into the model, the final QALY gain was 
0.7573. This resulted in a 12.5% quality of life gain for the average patient 
during the 12 years of the model. The average cost-utility versus no therapy for 
use of the telescope prosthesis was $14389/QALY. The incremental cost-utility 
referent to control fellow eyes was $14063/QALY, whereas the incremental 
cost-utility referent to fellow eyes that underwent intra-study cataract surgery 
was $11805/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with the telescope prosthesis considerably improves quality 
of life and at the same time is cost-effective by conventional standards.

This paper uses the English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing to explore the 
self-reported effect of cataract operations on eye-sight. A non-parametric 
analysis shows clearly that most cataract patients report improved eye-sight 
after surgery and a parametric analysis provides further information: it shows 
that the beneficial effect is larger the worse was self-reported eye-sight 
preceding surgery so that those with very good or excellent eye-sight do not 
derive immediate benefit. Nevertheless, the long-run effect is suggested to be 
beneficial. Calibrating the results to existing studies of the effect of 
imperfect eye-sight on quality of life, the impact of cataract operations on 
Quality Adjusted Life Years is found to be similar to that established in 
previous studies and well above the costs of cataract operations in most 
circumstances.

ME, van Zundert AJ.

Netherlands.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the 
additive and logistic EuroSCOREs in predicting the operative mortality in 
patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) with or without coronary 
artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.
SETTING: This was a single-center study performed in an educational hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: All patients (n = 1,885) who underwent AVR with (n = 813) or 
without (n = 1,072) CABG surgery between 1998 and 2007.
INTERVENTIONS: AVR with or without CABG surgery.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Variable life-adjusted display curves were 
constructed to compare the observed operative mortality with the additive and 
logistic EuroSCOREs. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used 
to determine the discriminatory power of the additive and logistic EuroSCOREs. 
Calibration between the predicted and the observed operative mortality was 
checked by comparing the predicted probability of the mortality with the 
additive and logistic EuroSCORE. In the isolated AVR group, the additive 
EuroSCORE was 5.8% predicted mortality and the logistic EuroSCORE was 7.2%, 
whereas the observed operative mortality was 3.2%. In the AVR with CABG surgery 
group, the additive EuroSCORE was 7.2% and the logistic EuroSCORE was 8.8%, 
whereas the observed operative mortality was 5.3%. ROC curve analyses showed a 
high discriminatory power for both EuroSCOREs in both patient groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the additive and the logistic EuroSCOREs had good 
discriminatory power, they were not able to predict the actual operative 
mortality accurately. Both EuroSCOREs overestimated the operative mortality, 
especially in low-risk patients.

planning of CNS tumors. Is it worth it?

The purpose of our study was to examine the potential benefits of integrating 
functional MRI (fMRI) information into the 3D-based planning process for central 
nervous system (CNS) malignancies. Between 01.01.2008 and 01.12.2009, ten 
patients with astrocytoma (both low and high-grade histological type) were 
enrolled in this study. Before the planning process, conventional CT planning, 
postoperative MR, and individual functional MRI examinations were conducted. For 
the functional MRI examination four types of conventional stimuli were applied: 
acoustic, visual, somatosensory, and numeric. To examine the potential benefits 
of using fMRI-based information, three different types of theoretical planning 
were applied and compared: 3D conformal plan without fMRI information, 3D 
conformal plan with fMRI information, and IMRT plan with fMRI information. DVH 
analysis and the NTCP model were used for plan comparison. When comparing 
planning methods, distance-related subgroups were generated and studied. By 
using the additional fMRI information, a significantly higher sparing effect can 
be achieved on these ORs (both with conventional 3D-based planning and IMRT). In 
cases when the OR-PTV distance is less than 1 cm, IMRT seems to be a 
significantly better choice than conventional 3D-based techniques. IMRT also has 
an additional sparing effect on the optic tract and brainstem, especially for 
locations close to the midline. Our results demonstrated that using fMRI 
information in conventional 3D-based treatment planning has the potential 
benefit of significant dose reduction for the critical organs, with no 
compromise in PTV coverage even when using conventional 3D planning. fMRI can be 
widely used in low-grade cases (long life expectancy, lower acute and late 
toxicity) and also in cases with high-grade astrocytomas or distant metastases 
(higher dose to PTV with better sparing of risk organs). In cases when the 
OR-PTV distance is less than 1 cm, IMRT should be the choice of treatment for a 
higher sparing effect on functional active areas. Longer imaging and clinical 
follow up are needed to confirm the real sparing effect on these functional 
areas.

and Norway.

Netherlands. s.spronk@erasmusmc.nl

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in men aged 65 years, 
for both the Netherlands and Norway.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life-years, net health benefits, lifetime costs and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios for both screening and no screening for AAA. The best 
available evidence was retrieved from the literature and combined with primary 
data from the two countries separately, and analysed from a national 
perspective. A threshold willingness-to-pay (WTP) of €20,000 and €62,500 was 
used for data from the Netherlands and Norway respectively.
RESULTS: The additional costs of the screening strategy compared with no 
screening were €421 (95 per cent confidence interval 33 to 806) per person in 
the Netherlands, and the additional life-years were 0·097 (-0·180 to 0·365), 
representing €4340 per life-year. For Norway, the values were €562 (59 to 1078), 
0·057 (-0·135 to 0·253) life-years and €9860 per life-year respectively. In 
Norway the results were sensitive to a decrease in the prevalence of AAA in 
65-year-old men to 1 per cent, or lower. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
indicated that AAA screening has a 70 per cent probability of being 
cost-effective in the Netherlands with a WTP threshold of €20,000, and 70 per 
cent in Norway with a threshold of €62,500.
CONCLUSION: Using this model, screening for AAA in 65-year-old men would be 
highly cost-effective in both the Netherlands and Norway.

Knowledge of the structure of a viroid is critically important to elucidate the 
roles played by the various RNA motifs in the steps of the viroid's life cycle. 
A new technique, RNA-selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer 
extension (SHAPE), has recently been shown to be fast, reliable and applicable 
to the study of various RNA molecules. Consequently, this method was used to 
probe sequence variants of Peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd). Initially, 
probing data from RNA strands of both polarities of the Siberian C variant 
confirmed the secondary structures previously determined using both conventional 
and fastidious approaches. Subsequently, analysis of an Alberta variant showed 
an identical structure for the strand of (-) polarity, but the (+) polarity 
strand exhibited two differences from the Siberian C variant: the P11-L11 
stem-loop domain formed a cruciform structure, and nucleotides from loops L1 and 
L11 were involved in the formation of a pseudoknot. The existence of both of 
these motifs was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. The subsequent probing 
of 12 natural sequence variants led to the elucidation of the criteria governing 
the formation of this novel pseudoknot. Importantly, this study revealed that 
the heterogeneity of a viroid is not limited to its nucleotide sequence, but may 
also occur at the structural level.

Urologists, regardless of whether they practice in the community or in an 
academic institution, make decisions not only about their individual patients 
but also about hospital and health care policy by providing input to various 
committees that influence the adoption of new diagnostic and therapeutic 
technology. In an era of increasing awareness of healthcare costs, economic 
analyses that consider not only the potential benefit and harm of a given 
intervention but also the costs of the intervention, are increasingly important. 
This review article introduces a framework to critically appraise an economic 
analysis for its validity, impact, and applicability to patient care using an 
example from the urologic literature.

CONTEXT: The increasing incidence of localised renal cell carcinoma (RCC) over 
the last 3 decades and controversy over mortality rates have prompted 
reassessment of current treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To critically review the recent data on the management of localised 
RCC to arrive at a general consensus.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A Medline search was performed from January 1, 2004, to 
May 3, 2011, using renal cell carcinoma, nephrectomy (Medical Subject Heading 
[MeSH] major topic), surgical procedures, minimally invasive (MeSH major topic), 
nephron-sparing surgery, cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, surveillance, 
and watchful waiting.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Initial active surveillance (AS) should be a first treatment 
option for small renal masses (SRMs) <4 cm in unfit patients or those with 
limited life expectancy. SRMs that show fast growth or reach 4 cm in diameter 
while on AS should be considered for treatment. Partial nephrectomy (PN) is the 
established treatment for T1a tumours (<4 cm) and an emerging standard treatment 
for T1b tumours (4-7 cm) provided that the operation is technically feasible and 
the tumour can be completely removed. Radical nephrectomy (RN) should be limited 
to those cases where the tumour is not amenable to nephron-sparing surgery 
(NSS). Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy (LRN) has benefits over open RN in terms 
of morbidity and should be the standard of care for T1 and T2 tumours, provided 
that it is performed in an advanced laparoscopic centre and NSS is not 
applicable. Open PN, not LRN, should be performed if minimally invasive 
expertise is not available. At this time, there is insufficient long-term data 
available to adequately compare ablative techniques with surgical options. 
Therefore ablative therapies should be reserved for carefully selected high 
surgical risk patients with SRMs <4 cm.
CONCLUSIONS: The choice of treatment for the patient with localised RCC needs to 
be individualised. Preservation of renal function without compromising the 
oncologic outcome should be the most important goal in the decision-making 
process.

BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) worsens with multiple 
sclerosis (MS) relapses and disease progression. Common symptoms including 
depression and fatigue may contribute to poor HRQoL.
OBJECTIVES: To report exploratory analyses assessing the impact of fingolimod 
(FTY720) on HRQoL and depression in a phase II study of relapsing MS.
METHODS: The Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire in MS (HAQUAMS) and Beck 
Depression Inventory second edition (BDI-II) scores were assessed during a 
6-month, placebo-controlled study and optional extension.
RESULTS: HAQUAMS total score improved with fingolimod and worsened with placebo. 
Mean score change from baseline to month 6 was -0.02 with fingolimod 1.25 mg 
(p < 0.05 versus placebo), -0.01 with fingolimod 5.0 mg and + 0.12 with placebo. 
Categorical data supported a clinically important effect of fingolimod on HRQoL. 
Fingolimod 1.25 mg was also beneficial over placebo in the fatigue/thinking 
HAQUAMS sub-domain (p < 0.05 versus placebo). Change in mean BDI-II scores from 
baseline to month 6 and the proportion of patients with BDI-II scores indicative 
of clinical depression favored fingolimod 1.25 mg over placebo (p < 0.05 for 
both). At month 4, mean BDI-II and HAQUAMS total scores appeared to be 
maintained in fingolimod-treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Fingolimod 1.25 mg may improve HRQoL and depression at 6 months 
compared with placebo in patients with relapsing MS.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend mammography every 1 or 2 years starting 
at age 40 or 50 years, regardless of individual risk for breast cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of mammography by age, breast 
density, history of breast biopsy, family history of breast cancer, and 
screening interval.
DESIGN: Markov microsimulation model.
DATA SOURCES: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, Breast Cancer 
Surveillance Consortium, and the medical literature.
TARGET POPULATION: U.S. women aged 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 to 79 
years with initial mammography at age 40 years and breast density of Breast 
Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories 1 to 4.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: National health payer.
INTERVENTION: Mammography annually, biennially, or every 3 to 4 years or no 
mammography.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and number 
of women screened over 10 years to prevent 1 death from breast cancer.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Biennial mammography cost less than $100,000 per 
QALY gained for women aged 40 to 79 years with BI-RADS category 3 or 4 breast 
density or aged 50 to 69 years with category 2 density; women aged 60 to 79 
years with category 1 density and either a family history of breast cancer or a 
previous breast biopsy; and all women aged 40 to 79 years with both a family 
history of breast cancer and a previous breast biopsy, regardless of breast 
density. Biennial mammography cost less than $50,000 per QALY gained for women 
aged 40 to 49 years with category 3 or 4 breast density and either a previous 
breast biopsy or a family history of breast cancer. Annual mammography was not 
cost-effective for any group, regardless of age or breast density.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Mammography is expensive if the disutility of 
false-positive mammography results and the costs of detecting nonprogressive and 
nonlethal invasive cancer are considered.
LIMITATION: Results are not applicable to carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.
CONCLUSION: Mammography screening should be personalized on the basis of a 
woman's age, breast density, history of breast biopsy, family history of breast 
cancer, and beliefs about the potential benefit and harms of screening.

Maharashtra, India. sunil1030@yahoo.com

Within the next few decades, we will see an extraordinary increase in the number 
of older people worldwide. The public health benefit of preventive medicine in 
old age comes from the compression of the time spent in dependency to a minimum. 
A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the morbidity 
profile of the geriatric population in a rural area of Maharashtra. A total of 
214 subjects, of age 60 years and above, were examined. Data were collected by 
structured interviews and clinical and laboratory examinations. Out of the total 
of 214 subjects, 190 were suffering from some or the other diseases and the 
major morbidities were visual (56%), musculoskeletal (38.3%), respiratory 
(32.7%), and hypertension (28%). Anemia was present in 62.6%, 5.61% had Diabetes 
Mellitus and 22.5% were found to be overweight. The average morbidity load was 
2.61. The rising morbidities clearly showed that a regular, complete health 
checkup of the elderly should be embedded in the essential elements of the 
Primary Health Care. This would reduce the morbidity, improve the quality of 
life, and facilitate 'Active Aging'.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of cost-effectiveness of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel 
(LCIG), compared to standard care (SC) in patients with advanced Parkinson's 
disease (aPD) in the UK.
DESIGN: Markov model to quantify costs and outcomes associated with LCIG versus 
SC in aPD patients at Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stages 3, 4 or 5 experiencing >50% 
OFF time per day. Time horizon was lifetime, LCIG treatment was assumed to last 
maximal 5 years after which patients revert to SC. Model comprised 12 aPD health 
states according to H&Y status and daily time spent in OFF state. Cost analyses 
are reported from a UK NHS and Personal Social Services perspective. 
Uncertainties were assessed through one-way sensitivity analyses.
COMPARATORS: LCIG, providing patients with continuous dopaminergic stimulation 
to maximise functional ON time during the day and SC, defined as medically 
determined best available oral medication.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness, based on quality adjusted life years 
gained, presented as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: Lifetime analysis yields an incremental cost per QALY of £36,024 for 
LCIG compared to SC (incremental cost £39,644, QALY gain 1.1). Results were 
sensitive to time on treatment, health state on treatment initiation, and 
estimates of long term benefit (OWSA results from £32,127 to £66,421 per QALY). 
Findings must be considered in the context of the study limitations which were 
mainly due to data availability constraints.
CONCLUSIONS: LCIG is an effective treatment, reducing OFF time and improving 
quality of life in advanced PD. It provides value for money in 
levodopa-responsive aPD patients with severe motor fluctuations when no other 
treatment options are effective or suitable. Given LCIG is an orphan drug, it is 
reasonable to suggest that it may be considered cost-effective in the UK 
setting. However, further research is needed to complete current data gaps and 
increase robustness of the model.

Bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) for people who are bilaterally deaf: a 
systematic review and economic evaluation.

BACKGROUND: A bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) consists of a permanent titanium 
fixture, which is surgically implanted into the skull bone behind the ear, and a 
small detachable sound processor that clips onto the fixture. BAHAs are suitable 
for people with conductive or mixed hearing loss who cannot benefit fully from 
conventional hearing aids.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BAHAs 
for people who are bilaterally deaf.
DATA SOURCES: Nineteen electronic resources, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and The 
Cochrane Library (inception to November 2009). Additional studies were sought 
from reference lists and clinical experts.
REVIEW METHODS: Inclusion criteria were applied by two reviewers independently. 
Data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by one reviewer and 
checked by a second. Prospective studies of adults or children with bilateral 
hearing loss were eligible. Comparisons were BAHAs versus conventional hearing 
aids [air conduction hearing aid (ACHA) or bone conduction hearing aid (BCHA)], 
unaided hearing and ear surgery; and unilateral versus bilateral BAHAs. Outcomes 
included hearing measures, validated measures of quality of life (QoL), adverse 
events and measures of cost-effectiveness. For the review of cost-effectiveness, 
full economic evaluations were eligible.
RESULTS: Twelve studies were included (seven cohort pre-post studies and five 
cross-sectional 'audiological comparison' studies). No prospective studies 
comparing BAHAs with ear surgery were identified. Overall quality was rated as 
weak for all included studies and meta-analysis was not possible due to 
differences in outcome measures and patient populations. There appeared to be 
some audiological benefits of BAHAs compared with BCHAs and improvements in 
speech understanding in noise compared with ACHAs; however, ACHAs may produce 
better audiological results for other outcomes. The limited evidence reduces 
certainty. Hearing is improved with BAHAs compared with unaided hearing. 
Improvements in QoL with BAHAs were identified by a hearing-specific instrument 
but not generic QoL measures. Studies comparing unilateral with bilateral BAHAs 
suggested benefits of bilateral BAHAs in many, but not all, situations. 
Prospective case series reported between 6.1% and 19.4% loss of implants. Most 
participants experienced no or minor skin reactions. A decision analytic model 
was developed. Costs and benefits of unilateral BAHAs were estimated over a 
10-year time horizon, applying discount rates of 3.5%. The incremental cost per 
user receiving BAHA, compared with BCHA, was £ 16,409 for children and £ 13,449 
for adults. In an exploratory analysis the incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained was between £ 55,642 and £ 119,367 for children and 
between £ 46,628 and £ 100,029 for adults for BAHAs compared with BCHA, 
depending on the assumed QoL gain and proportion of each modelled cohort using 
their hearing aid for ≥ 8 or more hours per day. Deterministic sensitivity 
analysis suggested that the results were highly sensitive to the assumed 
proportion of people using BCHA for ≥ 8 hours per day, with very high 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio values (£ 500,000-1,200,000 per QALY 
gained) associated with a high proportion of people using BCHA. More acceptable 
values (£ 15,000-37,000 per QALY gained) were associated with a low proportion 
of people using BCHA for ≥ 8 hours per day (compared with BAHA).
LIMITATIONS: The economic evaluation presented in this report is severely 
limited by a lack of robust evidence on the outcome of hearing aid provision. 
This has lead to a more restricted analysis than was originally anticipated 
(limited to a comparison of BAHA and BCHA). In the absence of useable QoL data, 
the cost-effectiveness analysis is based on potential utility gains from 
hearing, that been inferred using a QoL instrument rather than measures reported 
by hearing aid users themselves. As a result the analysis is regarded as 
exploratory and the reported results should be interpreted with caution.
CONCLUSIONS: Exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that BAHAs are 
unlikely to be a cost-effective option where the benefits (in terms of hearing 
gain and probability of using of alternative aids) are similar for BAHAs and 
their comparators. The greater the benefit from aided hearing and the greater 
the difference in the proportion of people using the hearing aid for ≥ 8 hours 
per day, the more likely BAHAs are to be a cost-effective option. The inclusion 
of other dimensions of QoL may also increase the likelihood of BAHAs being a 
cost-effective option. A national audit of BAHAs is needed to provide clarity on 
the many areas of uncertainty surrounding BAHAs. Further research into the 
non-audiological benefits of BAHAs, including QoL, is required.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The development of a cervical kyphotic deformity can be 
associated with a degenerative disease, trauma, tumour, developmental anomaly 
and also a surgical procedure. Post-operative kyphosis can develop after both 
the anterior and posterior surgical approaches. The deformity can also result 
from systemic diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis or rheumatoid arthritis. 
The aim of the study was to make the clinical and radiographic evaluation of a 
group of patients with kyphotic deformity treated at our department.
MATERIAL: Between May 2005 and April 2010, a total of 102 patients underwent 
correction of cervical kyphosis at our department. (Center for Spinal Surgery). 
Of them, 90 patients with complete medical records and post-operative periods 
longer than 6 months were included in this study. There were 36 men and 54 women 
ranging in age from 13 to 90 years and with an average of 56.7 years. In six 
patients cervical kyphosis was caused by an inveterate injury, in 71 by 
degenerative disease, in six it developed in association with rheumatoid 
arthritis, and in seven patients it was due to previous surgery. Patients with 
acute trauma, tumour, infectious disease or congenital anomaly were not 
included.
METHODS: All patients were examined before surgery by radiography in 
antero-posterior and lateral projection, including flexion- extension bending 
films, and by CT scanning of ultrathin cross-sections with sagittal, frontal and 
recently also 3D reconstructions. Magnetic resonance imaging in three planes was 
also performed. On the basis of the results and clinical examination, the 
operative strategy was planned. Surgery was carried out from the anterior or the 
posterior approach, or the combined approach was used. Three-stage surgery was 
performed in one patient. The surgical outcome was assessed using the Nurick 
score and Neck Disability Index (NDI), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used 
to evaluate pain intensity or paraesthesia. Statistical analysis was done using 
the Chi-square test and paired t-test.
RESULTS: The average NDI value was 25.5 before surgery and 14.3 and 14.9 at one 
and two years after surgery, respectively. Compared with the pre-operative 
state, improvement or no changes were recorded in 89.7 % of the patients; 
transient deterioration occurred in 10.3 %. Improvements found were as follows: 
by one degree in 46.2 % of the patients, by two degrees in 18 %, by three 
degrees in 5.1 % and by five degrees in 2.6 % of the patients. The condition 
remained unchanged in 18 % of the patients. The average outcome was an 
improvement by one degree. The average pre-operative Nurick score was 0.7; an 
average post-operative value of 0.6 was recorded at both one and two years of 
follow-up. The average VAS value for neck and radicular pain was 5.7 
pre-operatively, and 2.5 and 2.7 at one and two post-operative years, 
respectively. Out of 90 patients, complete bone union was achieved at 6 months 
after surgery in 88 patients (97.8 %). The average pre-operative value for the 
cervical curvature index (Ishihara) was -13.7; the average pre-operative 
cervical kyphosis was -14.4 degrees, ranging from -2.2 to -44.0 degrees. After 
surgery, the average Ishihara index was +15.3 and the average lordosis was +13.5 
degrees, with a range of -16.0 to + 37.4 degrees.
DISCUSSION: A single/isolated anterior approach can be used for fixed 
deformities without ankylosing spondylitis. It allows for decompression of the 
anterior pathology and for correction of cervical kyphosis with use of 
instrumentation and structural graft. A combined ventral-dorsal approach is 
appropriate in fixed deformities or deformities involving the cervico-thoracic 
junction. The main principle of correction is to lengthen the cervical spinal 
column in the front and to shorten it at the back by anterior decompression with 
or without instrumentation and by subsequent posterior stabilisation. An 
isolated/single dorsal correction can be used in the case of successful 
correction by traction or specific head positioning on the table without 
anterior nerve compression. In severe fixed deformities such as Bekhterev's 
disease, the chin can be so close to the chest as to interfere with eating and 
breathing. The deformity most often develops at the cervico-thoracic junction 
and requires treatment by osteotomy.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study showed a marked improvement in the 
patients' quality of life after kyphosis correction, improved neurological 
status and an improved posture seen on radiograms of the cervical spine. The 
study also revealed a higher number of potential complications associated, in 
particular, with corrective osteotomy. The best results were achieved with the 
combined surgical approach; however, the choice of a surgical method was 
independent of the patient's clinical status.

Large-volume intrathecal enzyme delivery increases survival of a mouse model of 
late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.

Late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL) is a progressive 
neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in TPP1, the 
gene encoding the lysosomal protease tripeptidyl-peptidase (TPP1). LINCL 
primarily affects children, is fatal and there is no effective treatment. 
Administration of recombinant protein has proved effective in treatment of 
visceral manifestations of other lysosomal storage disorders but to date, only 
marginal improvement in survival has been obtained for neurological diseases. In 
this study, we have developed and optimized a large-volume intrathecal 
administration strategy to deliver therapeutic amounts of TPP1 to the central 
nervous system (CNS) of a mouse model of LINCL. To determine the efficacy of 
treatment, we have monitored survival as the primary endpoint and demonstrate 
that an acute treatment regimen (three consecutive daily doses started at 4 
weeks of age) increases median lifespan of the LINCL mice from 16 (vehicle 
treated) to 23 weeks (enzyme treated). Consistent with the increase in 
life-span, we also observed significant reversal of pathology and improvement in 
neurological phenotype. These results provide a strong basis for both clinical 
investigation of large-volume/high-dose delivery of TPP1 to the brain via the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and extension of this approach towards other 
neurological lysosomal storage diseases.

An estimate of the global reduction in mortality rates through doubling vitamin 
D levels.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The goal of this work is to estimate the reduction in 
mortality rates for six geopolitical regions of the world under the assumption 
that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels increase from 54 to 110 nmol/l.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study is based on interpretation of the journal 
literature relating to the effects of solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) and vitamin D in 
reducing the risk of disease and estimates of the serum 25(OH)D level-disease 
risk relations for cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and respiratory 
infections. The vitamin D-sensitive diseases that account for more than half of 
global mortality rates are CVD, cancer, respiratory infections, respiratory 
diseases, tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus. Additional vitamin D-sensitive 
diseases and conditions that account for 2 to 3% of global mortality rates are 
Alzheimer's disease, falls, meningitis, Parkinson's disease, maternal sepsis, 
maternal hypertension (pre-eclampsia) and multiple sclerosis. Increasing serum 
25(OH)D levels from 54 to 110 nmol/l would reduce the vitamin D-sensitive 
disease mortality rate by an estimated 20%.
RESULTS: The reduction in all-cause mortality rates range from 7.6% for African 
females to 17.3% for European females. Reductions for males average 0.6% lower 
than for females. The estimated increase in life expectancy is 2 years for all 
six regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing serum 25(OH)D levels is the most cost-effective way to 
reduce global mortality rates, as the cost of vitamin D is very low and there 
are few adverse effects from oral intake and/or frequent moderate UVB irradiance 
with sufficient body surface area exposed.

Preventive medication use among persons with limited life expectancy.

Maddison AR(1), Fisher J, Johnston G.

Persons with limited life expectancy (LLE) - less than 1 year - are significant 
consumers of health care, are at increased risk of polypharmacy and adverse drug 
events, and have dynamic health statuses. Therefore, medication use among this 
population must be appropriate and regularly evaluated. The objective of this 
review is to assess the current state of knowledge and clinical practice 
presented in the literature regarding preventive medication use among persons 
with LLE. We searched Medline, Embase, and CINAHL using Medical Subject 
Headings. Broad searches were first conducted using the terms 'terminal care or 
therapy' or 'advanced disease' and 'polypharmacy' or 'inappropriate medication' 
or 'preventive medicine', followed by more specific searches using the terms 
'statins' or 'anti-hypertensives' or 'bisphosphonates' or 'laxatives' and 
'terminal care'. Frameworks to assess appropriate versus inappropriate 
medications for persons with LLE, and the prevalence of potentially 
inappropriate medication use among this population, are presented. A 
considerable proportion of individuals with a known terminal condition continue 
to take chronic disease preventive medications until death despite questionable 
benefit. The addition of palliative preventive medications is advised. There is 
an indication that as death approaches the shift from a curative to palliative 
goal of care translates into a shift in medication use. This literature review 
is a first step towards improving medication use and decreasing polypharmacy in 
persons at the end of life. There is a need to develop consensus criteria to 
assess appropriate versus inappropriate medication use, specifically for 
individuals at the end of life.

Erythrodontia in congenital erythropoietic porphyria.

Bhavasar R(1), Santoshkumar G, Prakash BR.

Author information:

Sciences, Narketpalli, Andhra Pradesh, India.

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is one of the rarest of porphyrias 
occurring worldwide. CEP is a very rare genetic autosomal recessive disease, 
with mutation in the gene that codifies uroporphyrinogen-III synthase, leading 
to porphyrin accumulation in many tissues, with marked skin photosensitivity, 
hemolytic anemia with splenomegaly and a decreased life expectancy. We report a 
case of Gü;nther's disease in view of its rarity along with a description of 
this interesting condition. An 18-month-old female baby with clinical, 
hematological and biochemical profile of CEP was reported with marked skin 
photosensitivity over face and hands. She had erythrodontia with delayed 
eruption of teeth. When evaluating erythrodontia of uncertain cause, we advocate 
maintaining a high degree of awareness for porphyria, especially for CEP as it 
is the rarest among porphyria and is a life-threatening condition.

Hybrid shell engineering of animal cells for immune protections and regulation 
of drug delivery: towards the design of "artificial organs".

University of Namur (FUNDP), Namur, Belgium.

BACKGROUND: With the progress in medicine, the average human life expectancy is 
continuously increasing. At the same time, the number of patients who require 
full organ transplantations is augmenting. Consequently, new strategies for cell 
transplantation are the subject of great interest.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This work reports the design, the synthesis and 
the characterisation of robust and biocompatible mineralised beads composed of 
two layers: an alginate-silica composite core and a Ca-alginate layer. The 
adequate choice of materials was achieved through cytotoxicity LDH release 
measurement and in vitro inflammatory assay (IL-8) to meet the biocompatibility 
requirements for medical purpose. The results obtained following this strategy 
provide a direct proof of the total innocuity of silica and alginate networks 
for human cells as underscored by the non-activation of immune defenders (THP-1 
monocytes). The accessible pore size diameter of the mineralised beads 
synthesized was estimated between 22 and 30 nm, as required for efficient 
immuno-isolation without preventing the diffusion of nutrients and metabolites. 
The model human cells, HepG2, entrapped within these hybrid beads display a high 
survival rate over more than six weeks according to the measurements of 
intracellular enzymatic activity, respiration rate, as well as the "de novo" 
biosynthesis and secretion of albumin out of the beads.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The current study shows that active mammalian cells 
can be protected by a silica-alginate hybrid shell-like system. The 
functionality of the cell strain can be maintained. Consequently, cells coated 
with an artificial and a biocompatible mineral shell could respond 
physiologically within the human body in order to deliver therapeutic agents in 
a controlled fashion (i.e. insulin), substituting the declining organ functions 
of the patient.

Asia is home to four of the world's five largest diabetic populations, two of 
them being South Asian nations, namely, India and Pakistan. This problem is 
compounded by a substantial rise in the elderly population in Asian countries. 
On the other hand, the heterogeneous health condition and multiple 
co-morbidities make the care of chronic disease in the elderly a challenging 
task. The aim of the South Asian Consensus Guidelines is to provide 
evidence-based recommendations to assist healthcare providers in the rational 
management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly population. Current 
Guidelines used systematic reviews of available evidence to form its key 
recommendations. No evidence grading was done for the purpose of this 
manuscript. The clinical questions of the guidelines, the methodology of 
literature search, and medical writing strategy were finalized by consultations 
in person and through mail. The South Asian Consensus guideline emphasizes 
tailoring of glycemic goals for patients based on age, co-morbid conditions 
especially that of cardiovascular system, risk of hypoglycemia, and life 
expectancy. It also recommends cautious use of available pharmacotherapy in 
geriatric patients with diabetes. The primary principle of diabetes therapy 
should be to achieve euglycemia, without causing hypoglycemia. Appropriate use 
of modern insulins and oral drugs, including incretin mimetics will help 
physicians achieve this aim.

Changes in skills required for using a manual wheelchair after reconstructive 
hand surgery in tetraplegia.

Lamberg AS(1), Fridén J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Physical Therapy, Institute of Clinical Sciences, The 
Sahlgrenska Academy at Göteborg University, Göteborg, Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to document prospectively the changes in 
function that can affect the skills required to use a manual wheelchair after 
reconstructive hand and arm surgery in individuals with tetraplegia.
DESIGN: Case series. The tests were conducted preoperatively and 12 months 
postoperatively.
PATIENTS: Sixteen individuals who underwent a total of 23 grip/elbow extension 
reconstructions and who used a manual wheelchair as their main form of transport 
were included.
METHODS: Functional tests of wheelchair control were performed. The tests 
addressed 8 aspects of manoeuvring a wheelchair.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight percent of the individuals improved their manoeuvring 
skills after hand surgery. Improvements were also observed in the ability 
successfully to perform tests that were impossible to perform before surgery. 
The type of reconstruction and level of injury affected the outcome.
CONCLUSION: The improvement in wheelchair propulsion ability after 
reconstructive hand and arm surgery in individuals with tetraplegic spinal cord 
injury implies increased mobility, which can help individuals to live a more 
active life.

X-rays of inner worlds: the mid-twentieth-century American projective test 
movement.

Lemov R(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of the History of Science, Harvard University, USA.

This essay begins to tell the neglected history of the projective test movement 
in the U.S. behavioral sciences from approximately 1941 to 1968. This 
cross-disciplinary enterprise attempted to use projective techniques as "X-ray" 
machines to see into the psyches of subjects tested around the world. The aim 
was to gather subjective materials en masse, pursuing data on a scope, scale, 
and manner rarely hazarded before in any science. In particular, the targeted 
data included the traces of the inner life and elusive aspects of subjective 
experience including dreams, life stories, and myriad test results from a 
battery of tests. This essay explores how the movement and the experimental data 
bank that resulted were unlikely yet telling sites for the practice and pursuit 
of the Cold War human sciences. To look closely at the encounters that resulted 
is to show how the most out-of-the-way places and seemingly insignificant 
moments played a role in heady scientific ambitions and global geopolitical 
projects. At times, the projective test movement became a mirror of Cold War 
rationality itself, as tests were employed at the very limits of their possible 
extension. The essay argues for an off-kilter centrality in the movement itself, 
shedding light on the would-be unified social sciences after World War II and 
the "subjective turn" they took.

Liver transplantation with donors over the expected lifespan in the model for 
end-staged liver disease era: is Mother Nature punishing us?

Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.

BACKGROUND: The lack of sufficient donors to satisfy the waiting list 
requirements has prompted many to expand the acceptance criteria. The purpose of 
this study was to evaluate our liver transplantation (LT) experience with donors 
beyond the average lifespan.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2009, we received 75 liver 
offers involving donors ≥ 75 years of age. Donor and recipient data were 
analysed by both uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analyses.
RESULTS: We performed 32 adult liver transplants (43%). Half of the patients 
received organs through rescue allocations. Seven recipients (22%) developed 
initial poor function. Two had primary graft non-function (PNF). Four recipients 
were re-transplanted (two PNF and two ischaemic-type bile lesions). One- and 
3-year cumulative survival was 62 and 51% respectively. PNF, lab model for 
end-staged liver disease (MELD), post-LT haemodialysis, post-LT re-operations 
and post-LT sepsis were significant predictors by univariate analysis. Only PNF 
reached multivariate significance (P = 0.0307). Rescue offer allocation reached 
significance as a predictor of PNF by general linear model forward analysis. 
One- and 3-year 'MELD based allocation' (n = 16) vs 'rescue allocation' (n = 16) 
survival rates were 44 and 29% vs 82 and 76% respectively (P = 0.0197).
CONCLUSIONS: Although grafts from donors ≥ 75 years allow for an expansion of 
the donor pool, long-term recipient survival is inferior to that encountered
