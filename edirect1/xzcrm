STUDY DESIGN: Experimental animal study.
OBJECTIVES: Spastic hypertonia is originally believed to cause contractures from 
clinical observations. Botulinum toxin is effective for the treatment of 
spasticity and is widely used in patients who have joints with contractures. 
Using an established rat model with knee contractures after spinal cord 
injuries, we aimed to verify whether hypertonia contributes to contracture 
development, and the botulinum toxin improves structural changes in muscles and 
joint components responsible for contractures.
SETTING: University laboratory in Japan.
METHODS: To evaluate the effect of hypertonia on contracture development, the 
rats received botulinum toxin injections after spinal cord injuries. Knee 
extension motion was measured with a goniometer applying a standardized torque 
under anesthesia, and the contribution by muscle or non-muscle structures to 
contractures were calculated by measuring joint motion before and after the 
myotomies. We quantitatively measured the muscle atrophy, muscle fibrosis, and 
synovial intima length.
RESULTS: Botulinum toxin injections significantly improved contractures, whereas 
did not completely prevent contracture development. Botulinum toxin was 
effective in improving the muscular factor, but little difference in the 
articular factor. Spinal cord injuries induced muscle atrophy, and botulinum 
toxin significantly accelerated muscle atrophy and fibrosis. The synovial intima 
length decreased significantly after spinal cord injuries, and botulinum toxin 
did not improve this shortening.
CONCLUSIONS: This animal study provides new evidence that hypertonia is not the 
sole cause rather is the partial contributor of contractures after spinal cord 
injuries. Furthermore, botulinum toxin has adverse effects in the muscle.

Error-free mitosis depends on accurate chromosome attachment to spindle 
microtubules, powered congression of those chromosomes, their segregation in 
anaphase, and assembly of a spindle midzone at mitotic exit. The 
centromere-associated kinesin motor CENP-E, whose binding partner is BubR1, has 
been implicated in congression of misaligned chromosomes and the transition from 
lateral kinetochore-microtubule association to end-on capture. Although 
previously proposed to be a pseudokinase, here we report the structure of the 
kinase domain of Drosophila melanogaster BubR1, revealing its folding into a 
conformation predicted to be catalytically active. BubR1 is shown to be a bona 
fide kinase whose phosphorylation of CENP-E switches it from a laterally 
attached microtubule motor to a plus-end microtubule tip tracker. Computational 
modeling is used to identify bubristatin as a selective BubR1 kinase antagonist 
that targets the αN1 helix of N-terminal extension and αC helix of the BubR1 
kinase domain. Inhibition of CENP-E phosphorylation is shown to prevent proper 
microtubule capture at kinetochores and, surprisingly, proper assembly of the 
central spindle at mitotic exit. Thus, BubR1-mediated CENP-E phosphorylation 
produces a temporal switch that enables transition from lateral to end-on 
microtubule capture and organization of microtubules into stable midzone arrays.

BACKGROUND: The EQ-5D is a generic preference-based quality of life measure 
considered useful for supporting clinical and policy decisions by providing 
utility values that can easily be converted into quality-adjusted life years to 
be integrated in cost-utility economic evaluations. Although the three-level 
classification system of the EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) is still the most 
popular preference-based instrument used worldwide, several studies reported a 
ceiling effect on this version, especially in healthy and/or young individuals. 
In 2009, the EuroQol Group introduced a five-level EQ-5D, which expands the 
descriptive system from three to five levels within the same five dimensions. 
For this version to be used in health economic evaluation, societal values need 
to be assigned to the 3125 health states generated by this instrument.
OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to elicit the EQ-5D-5L health state 
preferences from the general Portuguese population and to derive the Portuguese 
value set for the EQ-5D-5L.
METHODS: A representative sample of the Portuguese general population aged above 
18 years was stratified by age and gender (n = 1451). Between October 2015 and 
July 2016, 28 interviewers carried out a series of 1-h-long computer-assisted 
personal interviews following the EuroQol Valuation Technology protocol. Each 
interview included the valuation of ten health states using the composite time 
trade-off (cTTO) and seven pairs of discrete choice experiments (DCEs). A 
standardized tool for quality control was used to assess the quality of the data 
as well as direct supervision and cross-examination of 10% of the global sample 
size. Data from both cTTO and DCE valuation tasks were modelled using a censored 
heteroskedastic hybrid model.
RESULTS: Interviewers complied with the quality control protocol in providing 
high-quality valuation data. The hybrid econometric model had consistent and 
significant parameters. The derived societal values for the Portuguese 
population ranged from - 0.603 to 1.
CONCLUSION: This study provided the Portuguese value set for the EQ-5D-5L on the 
basis of a hybrid econometric model using cTTO and DCE data. These results 
represent the preferences of the Portuguese population and are recommended to 
inform health decision-making in Portugal.

Aging is a multifactorial universal process characterized by a gradual decrease 
in physiological and biochemical functions. Given that life expectancy is on the 
rise, a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of the aging process is 
necessary in order to develop anti-aging interventions. Uncontrolled cellular 
senescence promotes persistent inflammation and accelerates the aging process by 
decreasing tissue renewal, repair and regeneration. Senescence of immune cells, 
immunesenescence, is another hallmark of aging. Targeting pro-senescent enzymes 
increases survival and therefore the lifespan. Although the upregulation of 
Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) enzymes in aging is still 
controversial, increasing evidence shows that dysregulation of those enzymes are 
associated with biological processes that contribute to aging such as 
irreversible senescence. In this manuscript components of the MAPK pathway will 
be summarized, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), 
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, as well as natural flavonoids, phenolic 
and diterpenoids with anti-senescence activity that shows positive effects on 
longevity and MAPK inhibition. Although more studies using additional aging 
models are needed, we suggest that these selected natural bioactive compounds 
that regulate MAPK enzymes and reduce senescent cells can be potentially used to 
improve longevity and prevent/treat age-related diseases.

Manual Therapy With Cryotherapy Versus Kinesiotherapy With Cryotherapy for Knee 
Osteoarthritis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Lizis P, Manko G, Kobza W, Para B.

CONTEXT: Manual therapy and kinesiotherapy are used for knee osteoarthritis 
(OA). Yet, a clear evidence of the effects of manual therapy versus 
kinesiotherapy on knee OA is limited. The addition of cryotherapy to manual 
therapy or to kinesiotherapy may enhance the health benefits in patients with 
knee OA.
OBJECTIVE: The study intended to evaluate the efficacy of manual therapy 
combined with cryotherapy versus kinesiotherapy combined with cryotherapy for 
patients with knee OA.
DESIGN: The research team designed a randomized, controlled trial.
SETTING: The study occurred in the Physiotherapy Outpatient Department of the 
Regional Hospital (Sandomierz, Poland).
PARTICIPANTS: The participants were 128 females and males with knee OA, aged 40 
to 80 y, who were patients in the department at the hospital.
INTERVENTION: The participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group 
that received manual therapy combined with cryotherapy, the MT-C group (n = 64), 
or to a control group, which received kinesiotherapy combined with cryotherapy, 
the KIN-C group (n = 64). The participants in both groups received 10 
treatments, 2 per wk for 5 wk.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was measured using a visual analog scale 
pain ratings. The secondary outcome measured the quality of life using the 
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities questionnaire, knee extension, and 
flexion range of motion using the goniometer, and functional capacity using the 
6-min walk test.
RESULTS: After the treatments, the intervention group had significantly lower 
scores than the control group for pain, as well as significantly higher scores 
for quality of life, range of motion of the affected knee, and functional 
capacity.
CONCLUSION: The patients achieved better health benefits from manual therapy 
when it was combined with cryotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Interferon (IFN) beta drugs have been approved for the treatment of 
relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) for more than 20 years and are 
considered to offer a favourable benefit-risk profile. In July 2014, 
subcutaneous (SC) peginterferon beta-1a 125 μg dosed every 2 weeks, a pegylated 
form of interferon beta-1a, was approved by the EMA for the treatment of adult 
patients with RRMS and in August 2014 by the FDA for RMS. Peginterferon beta-1a 
shows a prolonged half-life and increased systemic drug exposure resulting in a 
reduced dosing frequency compared to other available interferon-based products 
in MS. In the Phase 3 ADVANCE trial peginterferon beta-1a demonstrated 
significant positive effects on clinical and MRI outcome measures versus placebo 
after one year. Furthermore, in the ATTAIN extension study, sustained efficacy 
with long-term treatment for nearly 6 years was shown.
MAIN TEXT: In July 2016, an interdisciplinary panel of German and Austrian 
experts convened to discuss the management of side effects associated with 
peginterferon beta-1a and other interferon beta-based treatments in MS in daily 
practice. The panel was composed of experts from university hospitals and 
private clinics comprised of neurologists, dermatologists, and an MS nurse. In 
this paper we report recommendations regarding best practices for adverse event 
management, focussing on peginterferon beta-1a. Injection site reactions (ISRs) 
and influenza-like illness are the most common adverse effects of interferon 
beta therapies and can present a burden for MS patients leading to non-adherence 
and discontinuation of therapy. Peginterferon beta-1a shows improved 
pharmacological properties. In clinical trials, the adverse event (AE) profile 
of peginterferon beta-1a was similar to other interferon beta formulations. The 
most common AEs were mild to moderate ISRs, influenza-like illness, pyrexia, and 
headache. Current information on the underlying cause of skin reactions 
associated with SC interferon treatment, and the management strategies for these 
AEs are limited. In pivotal trials, ISRs were mainly characterized and 
classified by neurologists, while dermatologists were only rarely consulted.
CONCLUSIONS: This report addresses expert recommendations on the management of 
most relevant adverse effects related to peginterferon beta-1a and other 
interferon betas, based on literature and interdisciplinary experience.

BACKGROUND: Age-related decrements in power affect quality of life in older 
adults; however, no studies have determined the optimal loads that maximize 
power outputs using the most commonly employed lifting equipment, plate-loaded 
machines.
METHODS: Fifteen older men (69.2 ± 6.9 y) and 22 older women (68.9 ± 5.9 y) 
performed two sessions of strength and power testing. Individuals completed ten 
plate-loaded exercises to determine their maximum dynamic strengths (1RM) and 
peak power outputs (PP). Power was tested at 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80% 1RM using a 
linear position transducer. PP was expressed relative to the highest power 
produced (PPREL).
RESULTS: Multi-joint exercises produced optimal load values at 50-60%1RM for leg 
press, 50%1RM for chest press, and 40-60%1RM for seated row, with no significant 
differences among loads for shoulder press. Single-joint exercise optimal loads 
were seen at 50-60% for hip adduction, 50-70%1RM for calf raise, 60-80%1RM for 
biceps curl, and 50-80%1RM for triceps extension, with no significant 
differences between loads for hip abduction or leg curl. No significant 
differences were found between sexes for any exercise.
CONCLUSIONS: Different optimal load ranges are required for individual 
plate-loaded exercises in older persons. Specifically, multi-joint exercises 
demonstrated a narrow optimal load range favoring the velocity end of the 
load-velocity curve, while single-joint exercises produced a wider optimal load 
range extending into the upper limits of the load end of the curve.

Metallothioneins (MTs) are a family of low molecular weight, cysteine-rich, 
metal-binding proteins, which play important roles in metal homeostasis and 
heavy metal detoxiﬁcation. In our previous study, a novel full length MT cDNA 
was successfully cloned from the freshwater crab (Sinopotamon henanense). In the 
present study, tandem repeats of two and three copies of the crab MT gene were 
integrated by overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) and expressed in Escherichia coli. 
The SUMO fusion expression system was adopted to increase the stability and 
solubility of the recombinant MT proteins. The recombinant proteins were 
purified and their metal-binding abilities were further analyzed by the 
ultraviolet absorption spectral scan. Furthermore, the metal tolerance and 
bioaccumulation of E. coli cells expressing oligomeric MTs were determined. 
Results showed that the recombinant plasmids pET28a-SUMO-2MT and pET28a-SUMO-3MT 
were successfully constructed. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the SUMO-2MT and 
SUMO-3MT were expressed mainly in the soluble forms. Oligomeric MTs expression 
significantly enhanced Cu, Cd or Zn tolerance and accumulation in E. coli in the 
order: SUMO-3MT˃SUMO-2MT˃SUMO-MT˃control. Cells harboring pET28a-SUMO -3MT 
exhibited the highest Cu, Cd or Zn bioaccumulation at 5.8-fold, 3.1-fold or 
6.7-fold higher than that of the control cells. Our research could lay a 
foundation for large-scale preparation of MTs and provide a scientific basis for 
bioremediation of heavy metal pollution by oligomeric MTs.

OBJECTIVES: Given the goal of hepatitis C virus elimination by 2030, World 
Health Organization guidelines recommend treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) 
with pan-genotypic direct-acting antivirals, such as sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 
(SOF/VEL), SOF/VEL/voxilaprevir (VOX) or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB). The 
study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pan-genotypic regimens in initial 
(SOF/VEL or GLE/PIB) and re-treatment (SOF/VEL/VOX or GLE/PIB+SOF+ribavirin 
(RBV)) of CHC.
METHODS: A Markov state-transition model projected lifetime CHC health and 
economic outcomes from the US payer perspective. Model inputs were sourced from 
clinical trials or published literature and validated by hepatologists. Model 
outcomes included numbers of advanced liver disease events, life-years and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and total lifetime costs. One-way 
sensitivity analyses were performed on model results.
RESULTS: SOF/VEL followed by SOF/VEL/VOX resulted in comparable cure rates to 
the GLE/PIB treatment pathway (99.94% vs. 99.93%, respectively). SOF-based 
regimens provided similar QALYs at a lower lifetime cost versus a GLE/PIB 
treatment pathway ($30,749 vs. $36,255), resulting in cost savings of $5,506 per 
patient. Results were robust in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: SOF/VEL followed by SOF/VEL/VOX leads to comparable cure rates in 
the overall CHC population relative to the GLE/PIB treatment pathway. Based on 
wholesale acquisition prices, the SOF/VEL treatment pathway led to lower 
lifetime costs.

STUDY DESIGN: Secondary analysis using data from the NIH-sponsored study on 
adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis (ASLS) that included randomized and 
observational arms.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to perform an intent-to-treat 
cost-effectiveness study comparing operative (Op) versus nonoperative (NonOp) 
care for ASLS.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The appropriate treatment approach for ASLS 
continues to be ill-defined. NonOp care has not been shown to improve outcomes. 
Surgical treatment has been shown to improve outcomes, but is costly with high 
revision rates.
METHODS: Patients with at least 5-year follow-up data were included. Data 
collected every 3 months included use of NonOp modalities, medications, and 
employment status. Costs for index and revision surgeries and NonOp modalities 
were determined using Medicare Allowable rates. Medication costs were determined 
using the RedBook and indirect costs were calculated based on reported 
employment status and income. Qualityadjusted life year (QALY) was determined 
using the SF6D.
RESULTS: There were 81 of 95 cases in the Op and 81 of 95 in the NonOp group 
with complete 5-year follow-up data. Not all patients were eligible 5-year 
follow-up at the time of the analysis. All patients in the Op and 24 (30%) in 
the NonOp group had surgery by 5 years. At 5 years, the cumulative cost for Op 
was $96,000 with a QALY gain of 2.44 and for NonOp the cumulative cost was 
$49,546 with a QALY gain of 0.75 with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of $27,480 per QALY gain.
CONCLUSION: In an intent-to-treat analysis, neither treatment was dominant, as 
the greater gains in QALY in the surgery group come at a greater cost. The ICER 
for Op compared to NonOp treatment was above the threshold generally considered 
cost-effective in the first 3 years of the study but improved over time and was

Geriatric trauma has become an increasingly recognized management concern for 
trauma centers, and hospitals alike, on a national scale. The population of the 
United States is aging, as life expectancy rates have demonstrated a steady 
climb to an average of 78.8 years of expected life. With pervasive efforts of 
medical screening, prevention and chronic medical condition management, more 
elderly people will lead more active lifestyles and will be more predisposed to 
injury. As best practice guidelines specific for the geriatric trauma population 
have yet to be developed, many researchers have identified management strategies 
that have offset complications and mortality rates inherent to this patient 
population after injury. The impact of rib fractures in the 65-year and older 
patient population has been well documented, as have the mortality and pneumonia 
rates yet, historically, little attention has been directed to curtailing these 
adverse outcomes with more advanced treatment options. With the advent of rib 
plating for rib fracture fixation and chest wall stabilization, the practice 
paradigm for rib fracture management is shifting, as a viable operative 
intervention now exists. In this review, we focus on the characteristics of the 
geriatric trauma patient, areas of management where improvement opportunities 
have been identified, chest wall injury in the elderly patient, rib plating as a 
treatment option and offer our data to facilitate a better understanding of rib 
plating's impact in the geriatric trauma patient.

Property Based on Polypropylene/Poly(Vinyl Alcohol)/Polypropylene Incorporated 
with Tea Polyphenols.

The polypropylene/poly(vinyl alcohol)/polypropylene (PP/PVA/PP) multilayer 
active films with controlled release property were developed, of which the 
intermediate PVA layer was incorporated with 4% (w/w) tea polyphenols (TP) and 
the microporous PP films with different pore size were used as the internal 
controlled release layer. The SEM results showed that each layer of these films 
was agglutinated tightly. With increasing pore size from 171.05 to 684.03 µm, 
there were little effect on the films' color and opacity, the tensile strength 
(TS) and elongation at break (EAB) decreased slightly, the gas barrier (O2 and 
water vapor) property of the film reduced faintly, the time of achieving the 
release equilibrium in 50% ethanol decreased from 75 hours to 30 hours. The 
diffusion coefficient for the films increased with the increase of pore size, 
from 2.06 × 10-11 cm2 /s to 8.06 × 10-11 cm2 /s, suggesting that the release 
rate of TP increased as the pore size increased. The results were indicated that 
its release rate could be controlled by adjusting the size of pore. The films 
also exhibited different antioxidant activities due to their different release 
profiles of TP. It showed promise for developing the controlled release active 
packaging film based on this concept. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Controlled release 
packaging is propitious to extension of food shelf life. The microporous 
polypropylene films with different pore size used as the internal layer of 
polypropylene/poly(vinyl alcohol)/polypropylene (PP/PVA/PP) multilayer active 
films was proved that the release rate of tea polyphenols in the intermediate 
PVA layer released from the films into the food simulant can be controlled by 
adjusting the size of pore in this study. It showed a good prospect for using 
microporous or perforation-mediated film as the internal layer of multilayer 
film to develop the controlled release active packaging film for food packaging.

Microelectrode arrays are used to sort single fluorescently labeled cells and 
particles as they flow through a microfluidic channel using dielectrophoresis. 
Negative dielectrophoresis is used to create a "Dielectrophoretic virtual 
channel" that runs along the center of the microfluidic channel. By switching 
the polarity of the electrodes, the virtual channel can be dynamically 
reconfigured to direct particles along a different path. This is demonstrated by 
sorting particles into two microfluidic outlets, controlled by an automated 
system that interprets video data from a color camera and makes complex sorting 
decisions based on color, intensity, size, and shape. This enables the rejection 
of particle aggregates and other impurities, and the system is optimized to 
isolate high purity populations from a heterogeneous sample. Green beads are 
isolated from an excess of red beads with 100% purity at a rate of up to 0.9 
particles per second, in addition application to the sorting of osteosarcoma and 
human bone marrow cells is evidenced. The extension of Dielectrophoretic Virtual 
Channels to an arbitrary number of sorting outputs is examined, with design, 
simulation, and experimental verification of two alternate geometries presented 
and compared.

Men's Sheds: A conceptual exploration of the causal pathways for health and 
well-being.

Glasgow, UK.

Although men have a lower life expectancy than women, and are more susceptible 
to illness, they have been found to be less likely to engage in health-seeking 
behaviour. Men's Sheds, as a gendered intervention, has been identified as an 
effective way to engage men in meaningful activity and gain social support from 
others. However, links between sheds and health and well-being are not 
well-documented, and evidence is lacking of the potential causal pathways to 
health generation. This study aims to develop a plausible empirically based 
causal theory of how Men's Sheds influence the health and well-being of their 
participants and to set out future research directions to test this theory. 
Drawing on a scoping review of academic, peer-reviewed journal articles 
published between 1990 and 2018, potential causal linkages between shed activity 
and health and well-being outcomes are synthesised into a logic model framework. 
Sixteen relevant peer-reviewed journal were identified from the academic 
literature. The data from the articles are predominantly self-reported, and 
characterised by small sample sizes and/ or low response rates. Further, 
information is lacking on the demographics of Men's Shed participants and the 
contexts in which they exist. Most notably, while there is some evidence on the 
potential mental health and social well-being impacts of shed activities, 
physical health is less documented. The study shows that there is a lack of 
reliable and systematic evidence of the potential causal pathways between Men's 
Shed activities and health and well-being outcomes. In order to address research 
gaps, further research is required to test and develop the proposed theory and 
logic model.

BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence of cure for some neoplasms has emerged in recent 
years. The study aimed to estimate population-based indicators of cancer cure.
METHODS: Information on more than half a million cancer patients aged 
15-74 years collected by population-based Italian cancer registries and mixture 
cure models were used to estimate the life expectancy of fatal tumors (LEFT), 
proportions of patients with similar death rates of the general population (cure 
fraction), and time to reach 5-year conditional relative survival (CRS) >90% or 
95% (time to cure).
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2000, the median LEFT increased >1 year for breast 
(from 8.1 to 9.4 years) and prostate cancers (from 5.2 to 7.4 years). Median 
LEFT in 1990 was >5 years for testicular cancers (5.8) and Hodgkin lymphoma 
(6.3) below 45 years of age. In both sexes, it was ≤0.5 years for 
pancreatic cancers and NHL in 1990 and in 2000. The cure fraction showed a 10% 
increase between 1990 and 2000. It was 95% for thyroid cancer in women, 94% for 
testis, 75% for prostate, 67% for breast cancers, and <20% for liver, lung, and 
pancreatic cancers. Time to 5-year CRS >95% was <10 years for testis, thyroid, 
colon cancers, and melanoma. For breast and prostate cancers, the 5-year 
CRS >90% was reached in <10 years but a small excess remained for >15 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The study findings confirmed that several cancer types are curable. 
Became aware of the possibility of cancer cure has relevant clinical and social 
impacts.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) reduce 
cardiovascular events in coronary artery disease (CAD). Their costs exceed that 
of established oral lipid-lowering agents. Previous cost-effectiveness 
assessments have been inconsistent. Markov cohort state transitions models for 
stable CAD patients were calculated using information from 1530 participants of 
the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study (LURIC) with known causes 
of deaths. Non-fatal to fatal event rates, drug prices, direct treatment costs, 
and utility weights were from public sources. At an assumed relative risk 
reduction of 32.5% and an annual drug price of 8500 Euros, QALYs gained were 
1.23 and 1.20, savings were 2390 and 2410 Euros, and ICERs were 112,530 and 
108,660 Euros in women and men, respectively. When the annual cost of this 
medication was set at 1600 Euros, corresponding ICERs were 21,180 and 20,450 
Euros. PCSK9i treatment is cost-effective in stable CAD at a threshold of 
150,000 Euro and annual costs of 8500 Euros. As the broad use of PCSK9i therapy 
in CAD would have a disruptive impact on the healthcare budget, treatment should 
be focused on very high risk patients (≥3 comorbidities, annual risk of 10%); 
alternatively, and for lower risk, significant cost reductions would be needed.

Forestry Experiment Station, Mississippi State University, Box 9805, Mississippi 
State, Mississippi 39762-9805, USA.

This study examined the effects of trisodium phosphate (TSP), sodium 
tripolyphosphate (STPP), and sodium metaphosphate (SMP) dipping solutions on the 
microbiological quality of catfish frames (the carcasses remaining after 
skinless boneless fillets are removed). Frames were dipped for 5 min in 10% 
phosphate solutions at 5°C, drained for 2 min, and analyzed for aerobic plate 
counts and total coliform counts. TSP reduced aerobic plate and total coliform 
counts by 1.0 and 2.5 log CFU/ml of rinse buffer, respectively. STPP reduced 
aerobic plate and total coliform counts by 0.3 and 1.0 logs, respectively. SMP 
did not reduce aerobic plate counts, but did decrease total coliform counts by 
0.7 logs. The microbiological shelf life (time to reach 107 CFU/ml) of the 
frames treated with TSP was 3 days longer than controls. Rinsing frames in water 
after phosphate treatment reduced the effectiveness of the dips. The results 
demonstrate that TSP was more effective than either STPP or SMP in reducing 
microbial numbers on the surface of the frames and provided a subsequent shelf 
life extension.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Epidemiological correlations between active malignancy 
(AM) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) are well-established. However, the effect 
of reperfusion strategies, particularly mechanical thrombectomy (MT), has been 
barely investigated in patients with AIS and AM. We aim to evaluate safety and 
efficacy of reperfusion strategies in such patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a case-control analysis comparing patients 
with AM and AIS (AM group) to a group of cancer-free patients with AIS (control 
group). All enrolled patients underwent reperfusion therapies (i.e. intravenous 
thrombolysis, MT, intravenous thrombolysis plus MT). Main outcomes were 3-month 
functional independence, successful reperfusion, 3-month mortality, symptomatic 
intracranial hemorrhage.
RESULTS: Total 24 patients with AM and AIS (mean age: 69 ± 10.1) were 
individually matched to 24 control patients (mean age: 70.7 ± 9.3). In both 
groups 50% were treated with MT, 46% with intravenous thrombolysis and 4% with 
intravenous thrombolysis plus MT. No difference were found in successful 
reperfusion, 3-month functional independence, symptomatic intracranial 
hemorrhage, and mortality. However an overall mortality of 33% in the AM group 
was reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Reperfusion strategies for AIS patients with AM seem to be safe and 
effective. However an individualized approach to understand cancer stage and 
life-expectation is warranted.

Life expectancy continues to rise exponentially. The concept of frailty has 
emerged as a tool helping to gauge overall health status and risk of adverse 
events in aging patients, has shown to exhibit a linear relationship with poor 
survival in the elderly. Multiple pathologies have different genetic, 
radiographic, clinical and prognostic characteristics in the elderly, responding 
differently to various treatment modalities and thus present as unique clinical 
entities, not properly represented in large - guidelines generating studies. We 
present a two parts review discussing the unique features of the elderly patient 
harboring an intracranial neoplasm. In this Part-I, we review the management of 
benign meningioma in the elderly population. Meningioma is the second most 
common primary brain tumor. The risk of developing meningioma increases 
dramatically after 65 years of age. Predicting a specific meningioma's growth 
pattern and clinical behavior is impossible. Clinicians must choose between GTR 
with associated morbidity/ mortality, SRS or a combined AHS approach, since 
progression rates after STR are high. Several scoring systems attempt to offer 
risk stratification in meningiomas (five systems presented). The most 
comprehensive and validated GSS (for both resection and SRS) offers the 
opportunity for intervention, with potentially modifiable parameters.

Adapting treatment and follow-up according to the risk of recurrence and/or 
death from thyroid cancer is a relatively recent concept of "personnalized" 
medicine, developed particularly to avoid overtreatment of low-risk thyroid 
cancer which represents the majority of thyroid cancers diagnosed in the world 
today. For low-risk thyroid cancer, this decrease in extent of treatment 
involves the extent of surgery-total thyroidectomy, lobectomy or no surgery with 
active surveillance-but also the indications, doses and methods of stimulation 
when or if administering radioactive iodine (RAI), the indication for 
suppressive thyroxin therapy and the extent and modalities for follow-up that 
should be adapted to the risk of recurrence. The aim is to optimize medical 
resources and quality of life, particularly for low-risk patients whose life 
expectancy is that of the general population.
