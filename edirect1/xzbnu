(RA). ALX-0061 is a bispecific Nanobody® with a high affinity and potency for 
IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), combined with an extended half-life by targeting human 
serum albumin. We describe here the relevant aspects of its in vitro and in vivo 
pharmacology.
METHODS: ALX-0061 is composed of an affinity-matured IL-6R-targeting domain 
fused to an albumin-binding domain representing a minimized two-domain 
structure. A panel of different in vitro assays was used to characterize the 
biological activities of ALX-0061. The pharmacological properties of ALX-0061 
were examined in cynomolgus monkeys, using plasma levels of total soluble 
(s)IL-6R as pharmacodynamic marker. Therapeutic effect was evaluated in a human 
IL-6-induced acute phase response model in the same species, and in a 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in rhesus monkeys, using tocilizumab as 
positive control.
RESULTS: ALX-0061 was designed to confer the desired pharmacological properties. 
A 200-fold increase of target affinity was obtained through affinity maturation 
of the parental domain. The high affinity for sIL-6R (0.19 pM) translated to a 
concentration-dependent and complete neutralization of sIL-6R in vitro. In 
cynomolgus monkeys, ALX-0061 showed a dose-dependent and complete inhibition of 
hIL-6-induced inflammatory parameters, including plasma levels of C-reactive 
protein (CRP), fibrinogen and platelets. An apparent plasma half-life of 6.6 
days was observed after a single intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg ALX-0061 
in cynomolgus monkeys, similar to the estimated expected half-life of serum 
albumin. ALX-0061 and tocilizumab demonstrated a marked decrease in serum CRP 
levels in a non-human primate CIA model. Clinical effect was confirmed in 
animals with active drug exposure throughout the study duration.
CONCLUSIONS: ALX-0061 represents a minimized bispecific biotherapeutic of 26 
kDa, nearly six times smaller than monoclonal antibodies. High in vitro affinity 
and potency was demonstrated. Albumin binding as a half-life extension 
technology resulted in describable and expected pharmacokinetics. Strong IL-6R 
engagement was shown to translate to in vivo effect in non-human primates, 
demonstrated via biomarker deregulation as well as clinical effect. Presented 
results on preclinical pharmacological properties of ALX-0061 are supportive of 
clinical development in RA.

OBJECTIVES: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver 
disease in Western countries. No studies have examined the cost-effectiveness of 
screening its advanced form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis of annual noninvasive screening 
strategies using third-party payer perspective in a general population in 
comparison to screening a high-risk obese or diabetic population. Screening 
algorithms involved well-studied techniques, including NAFLD fibrosis score, 
transient elastography (TE), and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging 
for detecting advanced fibrosis (≥ F3); and plasma cytokeratin (CK)-18 for NASH 
detection. Liver biopsy and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) were compared 
as confirmation methods. Canadian dollar (CAD or C$) costs were adjusted for 
inflation and discounted at 5%. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
≤C$ 50,000 was considered cost-effective.
RESULTS: Compared with no screening, screening with NAFLD fibrosis 
score/TE/CK-18 algorithm with MRE as confirmation for advanced fibrosis had an 
ICER of C$ 26,143 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Screening in 
high-risk obese or diabetic populations was more cost-effective, with an ICER of 
C$ 9,051 and C$ 7,991 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, 
respectively. Liver biopsy confirmation was not found to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that annual NASH screening in high-risk obese or 
diabetic populations can be cost-effective.
KEY POINTS: • This cost-utility analysis suggests that screening for 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis may be cost-effective. • In particular, screening 
of high-risk obese or diabetic populations is more cost-effective. • Magnetic 
resonance elastography was more cost-effective to confirm disease compared to 
biopsy. • More studies are needed to determine quality of life in nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis. • More management strategies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
are also needed.

BACKGROUND: The treatment gap for serious mental disorders across low-income 
countries is estimated to be 89%. The model for Mental Health and Development 
(MHD) offers community-based care for people with mental disorders in 11 low- 
and middle-income countries.
METHOD: In Kenya, using a pre-post design, 117 consecutively enrolled 
participants with schizophrenia-spectrum and bipolar disorders were followed-up 
at 10 and 20 months. Comparison outcomes were drawn from the literature. Costs 
were analysed from societal and health system perspectives.
RESULTS: From the societal perspective, MHD cost Int$ 594 per person in the 
first year and Int$ 876 over 2 years. The cost per healthy day gained was Int$ 
7.96 in the first year and Int$ 1.03 over 2 years - less than the agricultural 
minimum wage. The cost per disability-adjusted life year averted over 2 years 
was Int$ 13.1 and Int$ 727 from the societal and health system perspectives, 
respectively, on par with antiretrovirals for HIV.
CONCLUSIONS: MHD achieved increasing returns over time. The model appears 
cost-effective and equitable, especially over 2 years. Its affordability relies 
on multi-sectoral participation nationally and internationally.

BACKGROUND: Monitoring population trends including mortality within subgroups 
such as people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and between 
countries provides crucial information about the population's health and 
insights into underlying health concerns and the need for and effectiveness of 
public health efforts.
METHODS: Data from both US state intellectual and developmental disabilities 
service system administrative data sets and de-identified state Medicaid claims 
were used to calculate average age at death and crude mortality rates.
RESULTS: Average age at death for people in state intellectual and developmental 
disabilities systems was 50.4-58.7 years and 61.2-63.0 years in Medicaid data, 
with a crude adult mortality rate of 15.2 per thousand.
CONCLUSIONS: Age at death remains lower and mortality rates higher for people 
with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Improved case finding (e.g. 
medical claims) could provide more complete mortality patterns for the 
population with intellectual and developmental disabilities to inform the range 
of access and receipt of supportive and health-related interventions and 
preventive care.

Thoracic kyphosis angle (TKA) increases with osteoporosis. This study aimed to 
investigate the relationship between magnitude of TKA and quality of life and 
gait performance in 34 osteoporotic women. Our results suggest that increasing 
TKA is significantly associated with decreasing quality of life (r = -0.48, 
p < 0.005) and gait performance (r = -0.74, p < 0.0005).
INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis and its related effects are threatening health and 
quality of life especially in postmenopausal women. Increased thoracic kyphosis 
angle (TKA), as one of the most common adverse musculoskeletal changes, could be 
regarded as a quantitative index for osteoporotic patients' assessment. Dual 
digital inclinometer (DDI) is one of the latest tools for non-invasive TKA 
measurement. The main purpose of this study was to determine whether a 
relationship existed between the magnitude of TKA, gait performance, and quality 
of life in a group of osteoporotic women.
METHODS: Thirty-four osteoporotic women, aged 50-68, participated in this 
descriptive analytic study. The magnitude of TKA measured by using DDI and 
expressed as the kyphosis index (KI). Quality of life and gait performance were 
assessed using short form 36 (SF36) questionnaire and functional gait assessment 
test, respectively. Back extension range of motion (ROM) and back extensor 
strength were also assessed. Pearson's correlation test was used to analyze the 
data, with the significance level of p < 0.05.
RESULTS: The findings revealed a statistically significant negative correlation 
between KI and quality of life (r = -0.48, p < 0.005) and KI and gait 
performance (r = -0.74, p < 0.0005). There was also a significantly negative 
relation between KI and back extension ROM and back extensor strength 
(p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that increased thoracic 
kyphosis negatively affects gait performance and quality of life. This finding 
could be regarded as an important implication for therapist to pay more 
attention to the magnitude of thoracic kyphosis angle and its changes, when 
selecting appropriate therapeutic methods to improve gait performance and 
quality of life in osteoporosis women.

BACKGROUND: Low-dose aspirin (ASA) is effective for secondary prevention of 
ischemic stroke but can increase the risks of hemorrhagic stroke, upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and dyspepsia. Prophylactic administration of 
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduces the risks of these digestive symptoms. We 
investigated the cost effectiveness of adding a PPI to ASA therapy for ischemic 
stroke patients in Japan.
METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed to compare the cost 
effectiveness of ASA monotherapy with ASA plus PPI co-therapy in patients with 
histories of upper gastrointestinal ulcers and ischemic stroke. The model takes 
into account ASA adherence rate and adverse effects due to ASA, including 
hemorrhagic stroke and UGIB. The analysis was performed from the perspective of 
healthcare payers in 2013.
RESULTS: In the base case, total life-years by PPI co-therapy and monotherapy 
were 16.005 and 15.932, respectively. The difference in duration of no therapy 
(no ASA or PPI) between the therapies was 558.5 days, which would prevent 30.3 
recurrences of ischemic stroke per 1000 person-years. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of PPI co-therapy relative to monotherapy was 
¥1,191,665 (US$11,458) per life-year gained. In a one-way sensitivity analysis, 
PPI co-therapy was consistently cost effective at a willingness to pay of 
¥5,000,000 (US$48,077) per life-year gained. In a probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, the probability that PPI co-therapy was cost effective was 89.74% at 
the willingness to pay.
CONCLUSIONS: Co-therapy with ASA plus PPI appears to be cost-effective compared 
with ASA monotherapy. The addition of PPI also appeared to prolong the duration 
of ASA therapy, thereby reducing the risk of ischemic stroke.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of an internet-based, nurse-led 
vascular risk factor management programme in addition to usual care compared 
with usual care alone in patients with a clinical manifestation of a vascular 
disease.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial (the 
Internet-based vascular Risk factor Intervention and Self-management (IRIS) 
study).
SETTING: Multicentre trial in a secondary and tertiary healthcare setting.
PARTICIPANTS: 330 patients with a recent clinical manifestation of 
atherosclerosis in the coronary, cerebral, or peripheral arteries and with ≥2 
treatable vascular risk factors not at goal.
INTERVENTION: The intervention consisted of a personalised website with an 
overview and actual status of patients' vascular risk factors, and mail 
communication with a nurse practitioner via the website for 12 months. The 
intervention combined self-management support, monitoring of disease control and 
pharmacotherapy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Societal costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 
incremental cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Patients experienced equal health benefits, that is, 0.86 vs 0.85 QALY 
(intervention vs usual care) at 1 year. Adjusting for baseline differences, the 
incremental QALY difference was -0.014 (95% CI -0.034 to 0.007). The 
intervention was associated with lower total costs (€4859 vs €5078, difference 
€219, 95% CI -€2301 to €1825). The probability that the intervention is 
cost-effective at a threshold value of €20,000/QALY, is 65%. At mean annual cost 
of €220 per patient, the intervention is relatively cheap.
CONCLUSIONS: An internet-based, nurse-led intervention in addition to usual care 
to improve vascular risk factors in patients with a clinical manifestation of a 
vascular disease does not result in a QALY gain at 1 year, but has a small 
effect on vascular risk factors and is associated with lower costs.

BACKGROUND: Surgical options for the management of medial compartment 
osteoarthritis of the varus knee include high tibial osteotomy, unicompartmental 
knee arthroplasty, and total knee arthroplasty. We sought to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of high tibial osteotomy and unicompartmental knee 
arthroplasty as alternatives to total knee arthroplasty for patients fifty to 
sixty years of age.
METHODS: We built a probabilistic state-transition computer model with health 
states defined by pain, postoperative complications, and subsequent surgical 
procedures. We estimated transition probabilities from published literature. 
Costs were determined from Medicare reimbursement schedules. Health outcomes 
were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We conducted analyses over 
patients' lifetimes from the societal perspective, with health and cost outcomes 
discounted by 3% annually. We used probabilistic sensitivity analyses to account 
for uncertainty in data inputs.
RESULTS: The estimated discounted QALYs were 14.62, 14.63, and 14.64 for high 
tibial osteotomy, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, and total knee 
arthroplasty, respectively. Discounted total direct medical costs were $20,436 
for high tibial osteotomy, $24,637 for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, and 
$24,761 for total knee arthroplasty (in 2012 U.S. dollars). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $231,900 per QALY for total knee 
arthroplasty and $420,100 per QALY for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that, at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
threshold of $50,000 per QALY, high tibial osteotomy was cost-effective 57% of 
the time; total knee arthroplasty, 24%; and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, 
19%. At a WTP threshold of $100,000 per QALY, high tibial osteotomy was 
cost-effective 43% of time; total knee arthroplasty, 31%; and unicompartmental 
knee arthroplasty, 26%.
CONCLUSIONS: In fifty to sixty-year-old patients with medial unicompartmental 
knee osteoarthritis, high tibial osteotomy is an attractive option compared with 
unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty. This finding 
supports greater utilization of high tibial osteotomy for these patients. The 
cost-effectiveness of high tibial osteotomy and of unicompartmental knee 
arthroplasty depend on rates of conversion to total knee arthroplasty and the 
clinical outcomes of the conversions.

Comment in
    Pain Physician. 2019 May;22(3):E245.

STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost per quality-adjusted life-year for lumbar 
epidural steroid injections (LESI).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Despite being a widely performed procedure, there 
are few studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of LESIs.
METHODS: Patients who had received LESI between June 2012 and July 2013 with 
EuroQOL-5D (EQ-5D) scores available before and after LESIs but before any 
surgical intervention were identified. Costs were calculated on the basis of the 
Medicare Fee Schedule multiplied by the number of LESIs received between the 2 
clinic visits. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using the 
EQ-5D.
RESULTS: Of 421 patients who had pre-LESI EQ-5D data, 323 (77%) had post-LESI 
data available; 200 females, 123 males, mean age: 59.2 ± 14.2 years. Cost per 
LESI was $608, with most patients receiving 3 LESIs for more than 1 year (range: 
1-6 yr). Mean QALY gained was 0.005. One hundred forty-five patients (45%) had a 
QALY gain (mean = 0.117) at a cost of $62,175 per QALY gained; 127 patients 
(40%) had a loss in QALY (mean = -0.120) and 51 patients (15%) had no change in 
QALY. Fourteen of the 145 patients who improved, and 29 of the 178 patients who 
did not, have medical comorbidities that precluded surgery. Thirty-two (22%) of 
131 patients without medical comorbidities who improved and 57 (32%) of 149 
patients without medical comorbidities who did not improve subsequently had 
undergone surgery (P = 0.015).
CONCLUSION: LESI may not be cost-effective in patients with lumbar degenerative 
disorders. For the 145 patients who improved, cost per QALY gained was 
acceptable at $62,175. However, for the 178 patients with no gain or a loss in 
QALY, the economics are not reportable with a cost per QALY gained being 
theoretically infinite. Further studies are needed to identify specific patient 
populations who will benefit from LESI because the economic viability of LESI 
requires improved patient selection.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased the life expectancy of 
people living with HIV (PLHIV); HIV is now considered a chronic disease. 
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and HIV care were integrated into primary care 
clinics operated within the informal settlement of Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya. We 
describe early cohort outcomes among PLHIV and HIV-negative patients, both of 
whom had NCDs.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of routinely collected clinic 
data from January 2010 to June 2013. All patients >14 years with hypertension 
and/or diabetes were included.
RESULTS: Of 2206 patients included in the analysis, 210 (9.5%) were PLHIV. 
Median age at enrollment in the NCD program was 43 years for PLHIV and 49 years 
for HIV-negative patients (p<0.0001). The median duration of follow up was 1.4 
(IQR 0.7-2.1) and 1.0 (IQR 0.4-1.8) years for PLHIV and HIV-negative patients, 
respectively (p=0.003). Among patients with hypertension, blood pressure 
outcomes were similar, and for those with diabetes, outcomes for HbA1c, fasting 
glucose and cholesterol were not significantly different between the two groups. 
The frequency of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was 12% overall. Median age for 
PLHIV and CKD was 50 vs 55 years for those without HIV (p=0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: In this early comparison of PLHIV and HIV-negative patients with 
NCDs, there were significant differences in age at diagnosis but both groups 
responded similarly to treatment. This study suggests that integrating NCD care 
for PLHIV along with HIV-negative patients is feasible and achieves similar 
results.

Mummified remains have been successfully studied radiologically since the end of 
the 19th century, giving rise to a specific field of research-paleoradiology. In 
this paper, we present the results of the first radiological investigation of a 
collection of Sicilian mummies found in a subterranean chamber beneath the 
Capuchin Church of Savoca. The chamber contains a number of preserved bodies, 
either held in special niches in the walls or interred within coffins. A recent 
detailed radiological examination of these mummies allowed the authors to 
determine information relating to the funerary treatment and some of the 
pathological alterations witnessed in the remains. Specifically, evidence of 
gout and DISH was identified, along with frequent degenerative joint disease, 
suggestive of rich dietary habits and a longer life expectancy. These findings 
were interpreted in the light of historical information and the social status of 
the subjects concerned.

BACKGROUND: Management of patients with neuroendocrine liver metastasis (NELM) 
remains controversial. We sought to compare the net health benefit (NHB) of 
hepatic resection (HR) versus intraarterial therapy (IAT) among patients with 
NELM.
METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model was created to estimate and compare 
the cost effectiveness associated with different management strategies (HR vs 
IAT) for a simulated cohort of patients with NELM. The primary (base case) 
analysis was calculated based on a 57-year-old male patient with metachronous, 
symptomatic NELM that involved <25% of the liver in the absence of extrahepatic 
disease. The endpoints were quality-adjusted life-months (QALMs), 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), 
and NHB.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, HR was strongly favored over IAT providing 
NHB of 20.0 QALMs and an ICER of $8,427 per QALY. In the Monte Carlo simulation, 
the greatest NHB for HR was among patients with functioning/symptomatic NELM, 
regardless of liver tumor burden. In the symptomatic group, IAT was favored only 
in a minority of old patients (>60 years) with extrahepatic disease and 
synchronous NELM. In contrast, in patients with nonfunctioning/asymptomatic 
NELM, hepatic tumor burden was the most important variable and HR was always 
cost ineffective in large tumors, independent of patient age and extrahepatic 
disease characteristics.
CONCLUSION: A Markov decision model demonstrated that HR was the preferred 
strategy among patients with symptomatic NELM, regardless of hepatic disease 
burden. In contrast, IAT should be preferred for patients with large volume 
nonfunctioning/asymptomatic NELM.

PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of multiple versions of a commercially 
available arrayed primer extension (APEX) microarray chip for autosomal 
recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP).
METHODS: We included 250 probands suspected of arRP who were genetically 
analyzed with the APEX microarray between January 2008 and November 2013. The 
mode of inheritance had to be autosomal recessive according to the pedigree 
(including isolated cases). If the microarray identified a heterozygous 
mutation, we performed Sanger sequencing of exons and exon-intron boundaries of 
that specific gene. The efficacy of this microarray chip with the additional 
Sanger sequencing approach was determined by the percentage of patients that 
received a molecular diagnosis. We also collected data from genetic tests other 
than the APEX analysis for arRP to provide a detailed description of the 
molecular diagnoses in our study cohort.
RESULTS: The APEX microarray chip for arRP identified the molecular diagnosis in 
21 (8.5%) of the patients in our cohort. Additional Sanger sequencing yielded a 
second mutation in 17 patients (6.8%), thereby establishing the molecular 
diagnosis. In total, 38 patients (15.2%) received a molecular diagnosis after 
analysis using the microarray and additional Sanger sequencing approach. Further 
genetic analyses after a negative result of the arRP microarray (n = 107) 
resulted in a molecular diagnosis of arRP (n = 23), autosomal dominant RP (n = 
5), X-linked RP (n = 2), and choroideremia (n = 1).
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of the commercially available APEX microarray chips 
for arRP appears to be low, most likely caused by the limitations of this 
technique and the genetic and allelic heterogeneity of RP. Diagnostic yields up 
to 40% have been reported for next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques that, 
as expected, thereby outperform targeted APEX analysis.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and morbidity increases with increasing 
age, largely as a result of increased lifetime exposure as well as increased 
prevalence of CVD risk factors. Hospitalization for CVD increases by a factor of 
over 18× for those aged 85+ years versus those aged <30 years. In spite of this, 
life expectancy continues to increase, and in Australia for people reaching the 
age of 65 years, it is now 84 years in men and 87 years in women. The number of 
people for whom lipid management is potentially indicated therefore increases 
with aging. This is especially the case for secondary prevention and for people 
aged 65-75 years for whom there is also evidence of benefit from primary 
prevention. Many people in this age group are not treated with lipid-lowering 
drugs, however. Even those with CVD may be suboptimally treated, with one study 
showing treatment rates to fall from ~60% in those aged <50 years to <15% for 
those aged 85+ years. Treatment of the most elderly patient groups remains 
controversial partly from the lack of randomized trial intervention data and 
partly from the potential for adverse effects of lipid therapy. There are many 
complex issues involved in the decision to introduce effective lipid-lowering 
therapy and, unfortunately, in many instances there is not adequate data to make 
evidence-based decisions regarding management. This review summarizes the 
current state of knowledge of the management of lipid disorders in the elderly 
and proposes guidelines for management.

Historical, the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was as a united disease 
entity and the chemotherapy to the metastatic cancer had limited results. Recent 
studies for the metastatic non-small cell lung cancer led to the ascertainment 
that the NSCLC does not constitute exclusively a disease entity, but different 
neoplasms guided from different molecular paths, different biological behavior 
and at extension requires different confrontation. Thus the new direction for 
the therapeutic approach of NSCLC is henceforth the most individualized approach 
based on the activated molecular paths of tumor. Distinct subtypes of NSCLC are 
driven by a specific genetic alteration, like EGFR, ALK, ROS1 or BRAF mutations, 
and these genetic alterations are sensitized to the inhibition of specific 
oncogenic pathways. The benefit from the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in 
patients with EGFR mutations it was confirmed by six randomized studies of phase 
III that investigated the role of gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib. In these 
studies the response rates vary in the impressive percentages from 55% to 86% 
and were connected with a remarkable median progression free survival of 
approximately 8 to 13 months, and with better quality of life compared to that 
of chemotherapy. In early stages NSCLC is needed the individualization of 
systemic treatment in order to reduce toxicity that is observed in the classic 
chemotherapy and to impact outcome. The role of EGFR TKI's has been evaluated in 
the adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage resected NSCLC. The data from these 
studies suggest that adjuvant TKI therapy might not increase the overall 
survival, but delay the recurrences. Prospective trials restricted to EGFR or 
ALK driven NSCLC subsets potentially offering the opportunity for a definitive 
answer in early disease adjuvant setting (ALCHEMIST) or as induction treatment 
before stage III chemo-radiotherapy (RTOG 1210/Alliance 31101), are ongoing. 
Ongoing prospective trials may offer the opportunity for a definitive answer of 
the role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in induction treatment before 
chemo-radiotherapy or in early disease adjuvant therapy.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer and the leading 
cause of cancer-related mortality in Canada. Surgical resection is the treatment 
of choice for patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, 
20% to 30% of them are deemed medically inoperable and may be offered radiation 
therapy. Standard external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is associated with high 
rates of local recurrence and poor long-term survival. Stereotactic ablative 
radiation therapy (SABR) is increasingly being proposed for inoperable patients, 
and the use of this treatment modality for operable patients is also being 
contemplated. The objective of this guideline is to review the efficacy and 
safety of SABR in these two clinical situations and to develop evidence-based 
recommendations.
METHOD: A review of the scientific literature published up to December 2013 was 
performed. A total of 44 publications were included.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Considering the evidence available to date, the Comité de 
l'évolution des pratiques en oncologie recommends the following: (1) for 
medically operable patients with stage T1-2N0M0 NSCLC, surgery remains the 
standard treatment because comparative data regarding the efficacy of SABR and 
surgery are currently insufficient for SABR to be considered an equivalent 
alternative to surgery for these patients; (2) for medically inoperable patients 
with stage T1-2N0M0 NSCLC or medically operable patients who refuse surgery, 
SABR should be preferred to standard EBRT (grade B recommendation); (3) the 
biological equivalent dose (BED(10)) used for SABR treatment should be at least 
100 Gy (grade B recommendation); (4) for patients with a central tumor, a 
large-volume tumor (large planning target volume) or severe pulmonary 
comorbidity, a risk-adaptive schedule should be used (dose reduction or increase 
in the number of fractions; grade B recommendation); (5) the choice of using 
SABR to treat NSCLC should be discussed within tumor boards; treatment with SABR 
(or with standard EBRT) should not be considered for patients whose life 
expectancy is very limited because of comorbidities (grade D recommendation).

Projected Effects of Radiation-Induced Cancers on Life Expectancy in Patients 
Undergoing CT Surveillance for Limited-Stage Hodgkin Lymphoma: A Markov Model.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with limited-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) undergo frequent 
posttreatment surveillance CT examinations, raising concerns about the 
cumulative magnitude of radiation exposure. The purpose of this study was to 
project radiation-induced cancer risks relative to competing risks of HL and 
account for the differential timing of each.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We adapted a previously developed Markov model to project 
lifetime mortality risks and life expectancy losses due to HL versus 
radiation-induced cancers in HL patients undergoing surveillance CT. In the base 
case, we modeled 35-year-old men and women undergoing seven CT examinations of 
the chest, abdomen, and pelvis over 5 years. Radiation-induced cancer risks and 
deaths for 17 organ systems were modeled using an organ-specific approach, 
accounting for specific anatomy exposed at CT. Cohorts of 20-, 50-, and 
65-year-old men and women were evaluated in secondary analyses. Markov chain 
Monte Carlo methods were used to estimate the uncertainty of radiation risk 
projections.
RESULTS: For 35-year-old adults, we projected 3324/100,000 (men) and 
3345/100,000 (women) deaths from recurrent lymphoma and 245/100,000 (men, 95% 
uncertainty interval [UI]: 121-369) and 317/100,000 (women, 95% UI: 202-432) 
radiation-induced cancer deaths. Discrepancies in life expectancy losses between 
HL (428 days in men, 482 days in women) and radiation-induced cancers (11.6 days 
in men, [95% UI: 5.7-17.5], 15.6 days in women [95% UI: 9.8-21.4]) were 
proportionately greater because of the delayed timing of radiation-induced 
cancers relative to recurrent HL. Deaths and life expectancy losses from 
radiation-induced cancers were highest in the youngest cohorts.
CONCLUSION: Given the low rate of radiation-induced cancer deaths associated 
with CT surveillance, modest CT benefits would justify its use in patients with 
limited-stage HL.

BACKGROUND: Data regarding the quality of life in patients undergoing 
laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy are lacking and no studies have reported a 
real cost-effectiveness analysis of this surgical procedure. The aim of this 
study was to evaluate and compare the quality of life and the cost-effectiveness 
of a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with respect to an open distal 
pancreatectomy.
METHODS: Forty-one patients who underwent a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy 
and 40 patients who underwent an open distal pancreatectomy were retrospectively 
studied as regards postoperative results, quality of life and cost-effectiveness 
analysis. The Italian neutral version of the European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C-30, version 3.0, was 
used to rate the quality of life.
RESULTS: Postoperative results were similar in the two groups; the only 
difference was that the first oral intake took place significantly earlier in 
the laparoscopic group than in the open group (P < 0.001). Regarding quality of 
life, the laparoscopic approach was able to ameliorate physical functioning 
(P = 0.049), role functioning (P = 0.044) and cognitive functioning (P = 0.030) 
and reduce the sleep disturbance scale (P = 0.050). The cost-effectiveness 
analysis showed that the acceptability curve for a laparoscopic distal 
pancreatectomy had a higher probability of being more cost-effective than an 
open distal pancreatectomy when a willingness to pay above 5400 
Euros/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was accepted.
CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of the study, laparoscopic distal 
pancreatectomy can be considered not only safe and feasible but also permits a 
better quality of life and is acceptable in terms of cost-effectiveness to 
Italian and European health care services.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy in patients with schizophrenia is reduced by 
20 years for males and 15 years for females compared to the general population. 
About 60% of the excess mortality is due to physical illnesses, with 
cardiovascular disease being the single largest cause of death.
METHODS/DESIGN: The CHANGE trial is an investigator-initiated, independently 
funded, randomized, parallel-group, superiority, multi-centre trial with blinded 
outcome assessment. 450 patients aged 18 years or above, diagnosed with 
schizophrenia spectrum disorders and increased waist circumference, will be 
recruited and randomized 1:1:1 to 12-months interventions. We will compare the 
effects of 1) affiliation to the CHANGE team, offering a tailored, manual-based 
intervention targeting physical inactivity, unhealthy dietary habits, and 
smoking, and facilitating contact to their general practitioner to secure 
medical treatment of somatic comorbidity; versus 2) affiliation to a care 
coordinator who will secure guideline-concordant monitoring and treatment of 
somatic comorbidity by facilitating contact to their general practitioner; 
versus 3) treatment as usual to evaluate the potential add-on effects of 
lifestyle coaching plus care coordination or care coordination alone to 
treatment as usual. The primary outcome is the 10-year risks of cardiovascular 
disease assessed at 12 months after randomization.
DISCUSSION: The premature mortality observed in this vulnerable population has 
not formerly been addressed specifically by using composite surrogate outcomes 
for mortality. The CHANGE trial expands the evidence for interventions aiming to 
reduce the burden of metabolic disturbances with a view to increase life 
expectancy. Here, we present the trial design, describe the methodological 
concepts in detail, and discuss the rationale and challenges of the intermediate 
outcomes.
