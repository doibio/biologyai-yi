OBJECTIVE: To estimate one-year costs of eating disorders in the United States 
(U.S.) from a societal perspective, including the costs to the U.S. health 
system, individual and family productivity costs, lost wellbeing, and other 
societal economic costs, by setting and payer. Findings will inform needed 
policy action to mitigate the impact of eating disorders in the U.S.
METHOD: Costs of eating disorders were estimated using a bottom-up 
cost-of-illness methodology, based on the estimated one-year prevalence of 
eating disorders. Intangible costs of reduced wellbeing were also estimated 
using disability-adjusted life years.
RESULTS: Total economic costs associated with eating disorders were estimated to 
be $64.7 billion (95% CI: $63.5-$66.0 billion) in fiscal year 2018-2019, 
equivalent to $11,808 per affected person (95% CI: $11,754-$11,863 per affected 
person). Otherwise Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder accounted for 35% of 
total economic costs, followed by Binge Eating Disorder (30%), Bulimia Nervosa 
(18%) and Anorexia Nervosa (17%). The substantial reduction in wellbeing 
associated with eating disorders was further valued at $326.5 billion (95% CI: 
$316.8-$336.2 billion).
DISCUSSION: The impact of eating disorders in the U.S. is substantial when 
considering both economic costs and reduced wellbeing (nearly $400 billion in 
fiscal year 2018-2019). Study findings underscore the urgency of identifying 
effective policy actions to reduce the impact of eating disorders, such as 
through primary prevention and screening to identify people with emerging or 
early eating disorders in primary care, schools, and workplaces and ensuring 
access to early evidence-based treatment.

Coumarin-1,2,3-triazole Hybrid Molecules: An Emerging Scaffold for Combating 
Drug Resistance.

Undoubtedly, antibiotics have saved billions of lives, but lack of novel 
antibiotics, development of resistance mechanisms in almost all clinical 
isolates of bacteria, and recurrent infections caused by persistent bacteria 
hamper the successful treatment of the infections. Due to the widespread 
emergence of resistance, even the new families of anti-microbial agents have a 
short life expectancy. Drugs acting on a single target often lead to drug 
resistance and are associated with various side effects. For overcoming this 
problem, either multidrug therapy, or a single drug acting on multiple targets 
may be used. The latter is called 'hybrid molecules,' which are formed by 
clubbing two biologically active pharmacophores together, with or without an 
appropriate linker. In this rapidly evolving era, the development of natural 
product-based hybrid molecules may be a super-alternative to multidrug therapy, 
for combating drug resistance caused by various bacterial and fungal strains. 
Coumarins (benzopyran-2-one) are one of the earliest reported plant secondary 
metabolites having a clinically proven diverse range of pharmacological 
properties. On the other hand, 1,2,3-triazole is a common pharmacophore in many 
drugs responsible for polar interactions, improving the solubility and binding 
affinity to biomolecular targets. In this review, we discuss recent advances in 
Coumarin-1,2,3-triazole hybrids as potential anti-bacterial agents, aiming to 
provide a useful platform for the exploration of new leads with a broader 
spectrum, more effectiveness and less toxicity with multiple modes of action for 
the development of cost-effective and safer drugs in the future.

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva in a young adult with genetic mutation: 
Case report.

RATIONALE: Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare autosomal 
dominant disorder characterized by congenital skeletal deformities and soft 
tissue masses that progress into heterotopic ossification. Deformities of the 
great toes are distinctive and heterotrophic ossification usually begins in the 
first decade of the patient's life. Any invasive procedure could potentially 
trigger a flare and heterotopic calcification. The diagnosis is difficult and 
there is no effective treatment for FOP and the approximate life expectancy is 4 
decades.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 22-year-old male patient who had suffered from pain and 
movement limitations for 14 years. At the early stage of disease, the child 
underwent an operation on both thighs with a diagnosis of myophagism. He had 
serious stiffness and multiple bony masses with the characteristic bilateral 
hallux valgus deformity and microdactyly.
DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with FOP by the help of characteristic 
great toe malformations and widespread heterotopic ossification throughout the 
body. Deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing demonstrated that the patient had a de 
novo heterozygous mutation (c.617G>A; p.R206H) in activin A 
receptor/activin-like kinase 2.
INTERVENTIONS: We administered a co-therapy of glucocorticoids, NSAIDs to 
relieve pain, and montelukast for 2 months. Bisphosphonate (5 mg, intravenous) 
was used once.
OUTCOMES: At the follow-up 12 months later, the patient still felt low back pain 
sometimes and need take NSAIDs three times a week.
LESSONS: Clinicians and radiologists should realize the characteristic features 
of FOP and early diagnosis can prevent additional invasive harm to the patient.

The semantic of a pandemic: Are cardiovascular patients dying "with" or "from" 
COVID-19? Reflections from a case report.

University of Milan, Milan, Italy.

RATIONALE: Northern Italy has been particularly hit by the current Covid-19 
pandemic. Italian deceased patients have a mean age of 78.5 years and only 1.2% 
have no comorbidities. These data started a public debate whether patients die 
"with" or "from" Covid-19. If on one hand the public opinion has been persuaded 
to believe that Covid-19 infection has poor outcomes just in elderly and/or 
fragile subjects, on the other hand, hospitals are admitting an increasing 
number of healthy young patients needing semi-intensive or intensive care units.
PATIENT CONCERNS: At the end of March 2020, a 79-year-old patient (M.G.) was 
admitted to the emergency department of our hospital with a 5 days history of 
fever, dyspnea, and cough. He was known for hypertension and coronary artery 
disease with a previous coronary artery stenting. Both the comorbidities were 
carried out without complications and the patient was previously asymptomatic 
and in good health. At admission, he was febrile and showed signs of respiratory 
failure with hypoxia and hypocapnia at blood gas analysis.
DIAGNOSIS: The day after, he was tested for SARS-CoV-2 with a real-time reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swab, which 
turned positive and a chest CT-Scan was consistent with the diagnosis of 
interstitial pneumonia.
INTERVENTIONS: He was treated with i.v. diuretics, paracetamol, prolonged 
noninvasive ventilation (CPAP), and empiric antibiotic therapy on top of his 
chronic treatment.
OUTCOMES: A treatment with heparin and corticosteroids was started; however, he 
developed irreversible respiratory failure. Invasive ventilation was not 
considered appropriate due to his comorbidities, low chances of recovery, and 
intensive care unit overcrowding. The patient died 9 days after admission.
LESSONS: Health conditions that are most reported as risk factors are common 
cardiovascular diseases that can be managed in modern clinical practice. Through 
a brief illustrative clinical case, we would like to underline how Covid-19 can 
be per se the cause of death in patients that would otherwise have had an 
acceptable life expectancy.

Oil Tea (Camellia oleifera) is an important woody edible oil plant in China. Oil 
Tea suffers from low rate of fruit set during production, which is related to 
poor pollination and fertilization. Pollen vigor is directly related to 
pollination and fertilization. Using the interspecific hybrid Y3 (C. grijsii × 
C. oleifera) as plant material, we studied the effects of sucrose, H3BO3, MgSO4, 
and IAA on pollen germination using an orthogonal design to determine the best 
culture medium. Results indicated that pollen germination rates were 
significantly affected by medium components and ranged from 29.13% to 56.84%. 
Pollen tube length was the longest in the T5 medium surpassing the control group 
by 489.36 μm. MgSO4 turned out to be the most important germination medium 
component having great effect on the pollen germination rate. The optimal 
culture medium to promote pollen tube growth of Oil Tea Y3 was: 1% agar, 150 
g·L-1 sucrose, 0.15 g·L-1 H3BO3, 0.07 g·L-1 MgSO4, and 0.01 g·L-1 IAA. The 
results of this paper may provide information for foliar application of Mg and 
IAA, which can improve pollen tube growth of Oil Tea in practice.

OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The intensification of treatment for head and neck cancers 
(HNCs) has created a cohort of patients living with short- and long-term 
comorbidities and functional deficits. This study aimed to determine whether 
there is a relationship between patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and objective 
measures of neck function in survivors of HNCs.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Thirty-one subjects (aged 64 ± 8.7 years; 28 males and three females) 
were recruited and completed the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and a numeric pain 
scale. At the same visit, subjects were fitted with two portable motion sensors 
to collect range of motion (ROM) and velocity data. Differences between ROM, 
velocity, and PRO subgroups were assessed using a one-tailed t test (*P < .05). 
The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was calculated between the NDI values 
and the ROM and velocity values for each motion.
RESULTS: A moderate correlation (r = 0.507) was observed between NDI and neck 
pain. Patients with no disability according to the NDI had significantly higher 
ROM and velocity than patients with mild to moderate disability. Velocity in all 
degrees of freedom (axial rotation, flexion and extension, and lateral bending) 
was significantly lower for patients who perceived higher levels of neck pain 
and neck disability.
CONCLUSIONS: This study notes that patients who report neck disability and pain 
have more limited ROM and velocity following HNC treatment. These data may 
improve treatment planning and care delivery by facilitating an understanding of 
the experiences of HNC survivors and the pathophysiology that must be targeted 
to address their psychosocial and functional deficits.

Cost-effectiveness of a Telemonitoring Program for Patients With Heart Failure 
During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Hong Kong: Model Development and Data Analysis.

Author information:

Hong Kong, China (Hong Kong).

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused patients to avoid seeking medical 
care. Provision of telemonitoring programs in addition to usual care has 
demonstrated improved effectiveness in managing patients with heart failure 
(HF).
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the potential clinical and health economic 
outcomes of a telemonitoring program for management of patients with HF during 
the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of health care providers in Hong 
Kong.
METHODS: A Markov model was designed to compare the outcomes of a care under 
COVID-19 (CUC) group and a telemonitoring plus CUC group (telemonitoring group) 
in a hypothetical cohort of older patients with HF in Hong Kong. The model 
outcome measures were direct medical cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Sensitivity analyses were performed to 
examine the model assumptions and the robustness of the base-case results.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the telemonitoring group showed a higher 
QALY gain (1.9007) at a higher cost (US $15,888) compared to the CUC group 
(1.8345 QALYs at US $15,603). Adopting US $48,937/QALY (1 × the gross domestic 
product per capita of Hong Kong) as the willingness-to-pay threshold, 
telemonitoring was accepted as a highly cost-effective strategy, with an 
incremental cost-effective ratio of US $4292/QALY. No threshold value was 
identified in the deterministic sensitivity analysis. In the probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, telemonitoring was accepted as cost-effective in 99.22% of 
10,000 Monte Carlo simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the current outpatient care alone under the COVID-19 
pandemic, the addition of telemonitoring-mediated management to the current care 
for patients with HF appears to be a highly cost-effective strategy from the 
perspective of health care providers in Hong Kong.

IMPORTANCE: The unaffordability of drugs has been a persistent and elusive 
challenge in the US health care system. Little is known about the prevalence and 
persistence of cost-related medication nonadherence (CRN) in a population with 
high-cost, high-need resource utilization.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and persistence of CRN among Medicare 
beneficiaries at high risk of hospitalization as well as the characteristics 
associated with CRN in this population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used survey data from 
Medicare patients at high risk of hospitalization and with a life expectancy 
greater than 12 months at an urban academic medical center from November 6, 
2012, to January 30, 2018. Patients were followed up for 12 months at 3-month 
intervals from baseline, for a total of 5 surveys. Data were analyzed from 
September 1, 2020, to January 5, 2021.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported CRN, using a metric of persistence and 
transiency. Based on the results of the 5 surveys, CRN was categorized as 
persistent (3 or more surveys), intermittent (2), transient (1), and any (1 or 
more). Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate factors 
associated with persistent and transient CRN.
RESULTS: Of the 1655 Medicare beneficiaries followed up during the 15-month 
study period, 1036 (62.6%) were women and 1452 (87.7%) were Black or African 
American; 769 (46.5%) were younger than 65 years, and 886 (53.5%) were 65 years 
or older (mean [SD] age, 62.4 [15.9] years). A total of 374 patients (22.6%) 
reported CRN at baseline, 810 (48.9%) reported any CRN, and 230 (13.9%) reported 
persistent CRN (148 [19.2%] of those younger than 65 years and 82 [9.3%] of 
those 65 years or older). The 230 patients who had persistent CRN accounted for 
28% of those who reported CRN at least once during the 15-month study period. 
Younger age (eg, <50 years vs 75 years: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.07; 95% CI, 
1.61-5.86; P = .001), worse self-reported health (AOR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.10-2.31; 
P = .01), and depression (AOR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.11-2.24; P = .01) were associated 
with greater likelihood of persistent CRN. The population-adjusted prevalence of 
CRN was 53.6% (887 patients).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that CRN is prevalent, 
moderately persistent, and variable in the Medicare population at high risk of 
hospitalization despite coverage by insurance. Longitudinal follow-up and 
refined predictive modeling of CRN appear to be needed to identify and target 
more precisely those with persistent CRN and to develop effective interventions.

The past century has witnessed remarkable advances in life expectancy in the 
United States and throughout the world. In 2010, however, progress in life 
expectancy in the United States began to stall, despite continuing to increase 
in other high-income countries. Alarmingly, U.S. life expectancy fell between 
2014 and 2015 and continued to decline through 2017, the longest sustained 
decline in life expectancy in a century (since the influenza pandemic of 
1918-1919). The recent decline in U.S. life expectancy appears to have been the 
product of two trends: (1) an increase in mortality among middle-aged and 
younger adults, defined as those aged 25-64 years (i.e., “working age”), which 
began in the 1990s for several specific causes of death (e.g., drug- and 
alcohol-related causes and suicide); and (2) a slowing of declines in 
working-age mortality due to other causes of death (mainly cardiovascular 
diseases) after 2010. High and Rising Mortality Rates among Working Age Adults 
highlights the crisis of rising premature mortality that threatens the future of 
the nation's families, communities, and national wellbeing. This report 
identifies the key drivers of increasing death rates and disparities in 
working-age mortality over the period 1990 to 2017; elucidates modifiable risk 
factors that could alleviate poor health in the working-age population, as well 
as widening health inequalities; identifies key knowledge gaps and make 
recommendations for future research and data collection to fill those gaps; and 
explores potential policy implications. After a comprehensive analysis of the 
trends in working-age mortality by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geography using 
the most up-to-date data, this report then looks upstream to the macrostructural 
factors (e.g., public policies, macroeconomic trends, social and economic 
inequality, technology) and social determinants (e.g., socioeconomic status, 
environment, social networks) that may affect the health of working-age 
Americans in multiple ways and through multiple pathways.

Although the theoretical underpinnings and analytical framework for needs-based 
health workforce planning are well developed and tested, its uptake in national 
planning processes is still limited. Towards the development of open-access 
needs-based planning model for national workforce planning, we conducted a 
systematic scoping review of analytical applications of needs-based health 
workforce models. Guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews 
and Meta-Analyses-extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist, a 
systematic scoping review was conducted. A systematic search of peer-reviewed 
literature published in English was undertaken across several databases. Papers 
retrieved were assessed against predefined inclusion criteria, critically 
appraised, extracted and synthesized. Twenty-five papers were included, which 
showed increasing uptake of the needs-based health workforce modelling, with 84% 
of the studies published within the last decade (2010-20). Three countries 
(Canada, Australia and England) accounted for 48% of the publications included 
whilst four studies (16%) were based on low-and-middle-income countries. Only 
three of the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the studies 
(36%) reported analytical applications for specific disease areas/programs at 
sub-national levels; 20% focused on the health system need for particular 
categories of health workers, and only two (8%) reported the analytical 
application of the needs-based health workforce approach at the level of a 
national health system across several disease areas/programs. Amongst the 
studies that conducted long-term projections, the time horizon of the projection 
was an average of 17 years, ranging from 3 to 33 years. Most of these studies 
had a minimum time horizon of 10 years. Across the studies, we synthesized six 
typical methodological considerations for advancing needs-based health workforce 
modelling. As countries aspire to align health workforce investments with 
population health needs, the need for some level of methodological 
harmonization, open-access needs-based models and guidelines for policy-oriented 
country-level use is not only imperative but urgent.

There is growing interest in studying the genetic contributions to longevity, 
but limited relevant genes have been identified. In this study, we performed a 
genetic association study of longevity in a total of 15,651 Chinese individuals. 
Novel longevity loci, BMPER (rs17169634; p = 7.91 × 10-15 ) and TMEM43/XPC 
(rs1043943; p = 3.59 × 10-8 ), were identified in a case-control analysis of 
11,045 individuals. BRAF (rs1267601; p = 8.33 × 10-15 ) and BMPER (rs17169634; 
p = 1.45 × 10-10 ) were significantly associated with life expectancy in 12,664 
individuals who had survival status records. Additional sex-stratified analyses 
identified sex-specific longevity genes. Notably, sex-differential associations 
were identified in two linkage disequilibrium blocks in the TOMM40/APOE region, 
indicating potential differences during meiosis between males and females. 
Moreover, polygenic risk scores and Mendelian randomization analyses revealed 
that longevity was genetically causally correlated with reduced risks of 
multiple diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and 
arthritis. Finally, we incorporated genetic markers, disease status, and 
lifestyles to classify longevity or not-longevity groups and predict life span. 
Our predictive models showed good performance (AUC = 0.86 for longevity 
classification and explained 19.8% variance of life span) and presented a 
greater predictive efficiency in females than in males. Taken together, our 
findings not only shed light on the genetic contributions to longevity but also 
elucidate correlations between diseases and longevity.

With an increasing life expectancy and aging population, orthopedic defects and 
bone graft surgeries are increasing in global prevalence. Research to date has 
advanced the understanding of bone biology and defect repair mechanism, leading 
to a marked success in the development of synthetic bone substitutes. Yet, the 
quest for functionalized bone grafts prompted the researchers to find a viable 
alternative that regulates cellular activity and supports bone regeneration and 
healing process without causing serious side-effects. Recently, researchers have 
introduced natural medicinal compounds (NMCs) in bone scaffold that enables them 
to release at a desirable rate, maintains a sustained release allowing 
sufficient time for tissue in-growth, and guides bone regeneration process with 
minimized risk of tissue toxicity. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 
NMCs are gaining popularity in western countries for the last two decades and 
are being used by 80% of the population worldwide. Compared to synthetic drugs, 
NMCs have a broader range of safety window and thus suitable for prolonged 
localized delivery for bone regeneration. There is limited literature focusing 
on the integration of bone grafts and natural medicines that provides detailed 
scientific evidences on NMCs, their toxic limits and particular application in 
bone tissue engineering, which could guide the researchers to develop 
functionalized implants for various bone disorders. This review will discuss the 
emerging trend of NMC delivery from bone grafts, including 3D-printed structures 
and surface-modified implants, highlighting the significance and potential of 
NMCs for bone health, guiding future paths toward the development of an ideal 
bone tissue engineering scaffold. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: To date, additive 
manufacturing technology provids us with many advanced patient specific or 
defect specific bone constructs exhibiting three-dimensional, well-defined 
microstructure with interconnected porous networks for defect-repair 
applications. However, an ideal scaffold should also be able to supply 
biological signals that actively guide tissue regeneration while simultaneously 
preventing post-implantation complications. Natural biomolecules are gaining 
popularity in tissue engineering since they possess a safer, effective approach 
compared to synthetic drugs. The integration of bone scaffolds and natural 
biomolecules exploits the advantages of customized, multi-functional bone 
implants to provide localized delivery of biochemical signals in a controlled 
manner. This review presents an overview of bone scaffolds as delivery systems 
for natural biomolecules, which may provide prominent advancement in bone 
development and improve defect-healing caused by various musculoskeletal 
disorders.

Intestinal involvement in ulcerative colitis is generally limited to the colon 
and rectum. We describe a life-threatening case of ulcerative enteritis 
occurring after colectomy. Other 53 similar cases are reported in the 
literature. The aim of this narrative review was to focus on ulcerative 
enteritis characteristics and diagnostic workup. A 25-year-old boy affected by 
ulcerative colitis underwent a total colectomy in an urgent setting for septic 
shock. Postoperative course was characterized by elevated ileostomy output, 
raised up to 10 L/day. Critical clinical conditions required resuscitation 
therapy. After exclusion of surgical complications, intestinal infections, and 
histologic specimen revision, the patient underwent endoscopic examination. 
Ileal biopsies revealed ileal localization of ulcerative colitis. Steroid 
treatment was finally effective. After literature revision, we classified all 
cases of ulcerative enteritis in three groups, according to intestinal 
involvement pattern and timing of clinical manifestation after operation. Out of 
54 cases, 18 occurred within 1 month since colectomy (early ileitis), 10 later 
on (late ileitis) and 26 do not involve ileus (nonileitis). Clinical 
manifestation is generally severe in the first group and mild and chronic in the 
others. Differential diagnoses of ulcerative enteritis are represented by 
infectious, immunological, toxic, and ischemic disorders. Those conditions 
excluded, ulcerative enteritis can be easily detected by endoscopic biopsies and 
treated with immunosuppressive agents. Long term surveillance seems important 
since recurrences are described. In conclusion, clinicians should suspect 
ulcerative enteritis in all patients with previous colectomy history that 
develop unexplained gastrointestinal syndromes, in order to avoid therapeutic 
delay.

BACKGROUND: Diminished sensorimotor control of the hand is one of the most 
common outcomes following stroke. This hand impairment substantially impacts 
overall function and quality of life; standard therapy often results in limited 
improvement. Mechanisms of dysfunction of the severely impaired post-stroke hand 
are still incompletely understood, thereby impeding the development of new 
targeted treatments.
OBJECTIVE: To identify and determine potential relationships among the 
mechanisms responsible for hand impairment following stroke.
METHODS: This cohort study observed stroke survivors (n = 95) with severe, 
chronic hand impairment (Chedoke-McMaster Hand score = 2-3). Custom 
instrumentation created precise perturbations and measured kinematic responses. 
Muscle activation was recorded through electromyography. Strength, spasticity, 
muscle relaxation time, and muscle coactivation were quantified.
RESULTS: Maximum grip strength in the paretic hand was only 12% of that achieved 
by the nonparetic hand, and only 6 of 95 participants were able to produce any 
net extension force. Despite force deficits, spastic reflex response of the 
finger flexor evoked by imposed stretch averaged 90.1 ± 26.8% of maximum 
voluntary activation, relaxation time averaged 3.8 ± 0.8 seconds, and 
coactivation during voluntary extension exceeded 30% of maximum contraction, 
thereby resulting in substantial net flexion. Surprisingly, these hypertonicity 
measures were not significantly correlated with each other.
CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of severe, chronic hemiparetic stroke experience profound 
weakness of both flexion and extension that arises from increased involuntary 
antagonist activation and decreased voluntary activation. The lack of 
correlation amongst hypertonicity measures suggests that these phenomena may 
arise from multiple, potentially independent mechanisms that could require 
different treatments.

BACKGROUND: In the recent era, antimicrobial resistance has been identified as 
one of the most important threats to human health worldwide. The rapid emergence 
of antibiotic-resistant pathogens (ABRP) in the modern intensive care unit (ICU) 
also represents a "nightmare scenario" with unknown clinical consequences. In 
the Greek ICU, in particular, gram negative ABRPs are now considered endemic. 
However, the possible longitudinal impact of ABRPs on long-term outcomes of ICU 
patients has not yet been determined.
METHODS: In this two-year (January 2014-December 2015) single-centre 
observational longitudinal study, 351 non-neurocritical ICU 
patients ≥ 18 year-old were enrolled. Patients' demographic, clinical and 
outcome data were prospectively collected. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
were calculated at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after ICU admission.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients developed infections due to ABRP (ABRP group), 57 
due to non-ABRP (non-ABRP group), and 236 demonstrated no infection 
(no-infection group) while in ICU. Multiple regression analysis revealed that 
multiple organ dysfunction syndrome score (OR: 0.676, 95%CI 0.584-0.782; 
P < 0.001) and continuous renal replacement therapy (OR: 4.453, 95%CI 
1.805-10.982; P = 0.001) were the only independent determinants for ABRP 
infections in ICU. Intra-ICU, 90-day and 2-year mortality was 27.9%, 52.4% and 
61.5%, respectively. Compared to the non-ABRP and no-infection group, the ABRP 
group demonstrated increased intra-ICU, 90-day and 2-year mortality (P ≤ 0.022), 
worse 2-year survival rates in ICU patients overall and ICU survivor subset 
(Log-rank test, P ≤ 0.046), and poorer progress over time in 2-year QALY 
kinetics in ICU population overall, ICU survivor and 2-year survivor subgroups 
(P ≤ 0.013). ABRP group was further divided into multi-drug and extensively-drug 
resistant subgroups [MDR (n = 34) / XDR (n = 24), respectively]. Compared to MDR 
subgroup, the XDR subgroup demonstrated increased ICU, 90-day and 2-year 
mortality (P ≤ 0.031), but similar 90-day and 2-year QALYs (P ≥ 0.549). ABRP 
infections overall (HR = 1.778, 95% CI 1.166-2.711; P = 0.008), as well as XDR 
[HR = 1.889, 95% CI 1.075-3.320; P = 0.027) but not MDR pathogens, were 
independently associated with 2-year mortality, after adjusting for several 
covariates of critical illness.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study may suggest a significant association between 
ABRP (especially XDR) infections in ICU and increased mortality and inability 
rates for a prolonged period post-discharge that requires further attention in 
larger-scale studies.

BACKGROUND: Psoriasis vulgaris is a skin autoimmune disease. Psoriatic patients 
have significantly lowered life expectancy and suffer from various 
comorbidities. The main goal of the study was to determine whether psoriatic 
patients experience accelerated aging. As accelerated aging might be the reason 
for the higher prevalence of comorbidities at lower chronological ages, we also 
wanted to investigate the relationship between aging and selected parameters of 
frequent psoriatic comorbidities - endocan, vascular endothelial growth factor 
and interleukin-17. Samples were obtained from 28 patients and 42 healthy 
controls. Epigenetic age measurement was based on the Horvath clock. The levels 
of endocan, vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-17 were analyzed 
using standardized ELISA methods.
RESULTS: The difference between the epigenetic age and the chronological age of 
each individual subject did not increase with the increasing chronological age 
of patients. We cannot conclude that psoriasis causes accelerated aging. 
However, the epigenetic and chronological age difference was significantly 
higher in female patients than in female controls, and the difference was 
correlated with endocan (r = 0.867, p = 0.0012) and vascular endothelial growth 
factor (r = 0.633, p = 0.0365) only in female patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a possible presence of pathophysiological 
processes that occur only in female psoriatic patients. These processes make 
psoriatic females biologically older and might lead to an increased risk of 
comorbidity occurrence. This study also supports the idea that autoimmune 
diseases cause accelerated aging, which should be further explored in the 
future.

BACKGROUND: People with severe mental disorders (SMD) experience premature 
mortality mostly from preventable physical causes. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) have recently produced guidelines on the prevention and management of 
physical health conditions in SMD. This paper presents the evidence which led to 
the recommendations presented in the guidelines.
METHODS: The work followed the methodological principles for WHO guideline 
development. Systematic reviews in relation to the treatment of seven key 
priority physical health conditions and associated risk factors in persons with 
SMD were systematically sourced. The quality of this evidence was assessed, and 
compiled into evidence profiles. Existing guidelines and treatment 
recommendations were also considered. Based on this information, specific 
recommendations were developed on the prevention and management of physical 
health conditions and their risk factors amongst people with SMD.
RESULTS: Nineteen recommendations were made in relation to the seven key 
priority physical health conditions and risk factors, alongside best practice 
statements for each condition. A mixture of conditional and strong 
recommendations were made, the quality of evidence underpinning these was 
generally low or very low. This is owing to the dearth of direct evidence 
relating to people living with SMD and comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents evidence-based recommendations to prevent and 
manage physical health conditions in people with SMD. The recommendations are 
designed to inform policy makers, healthcare providers as well as other 
stakeholders about what they can do to improve the management of physical health 
conditions in adults with SMD and support the promotion of individual health 
behaviors to reduce the risk factors for these conditions. If implemented, these 
recommendations can improve the care that people with SMD receive for their 
physical health conditions in an equitable and person-centered manner, so that 
in future in relation to premature mortality 'no-one is left behind'.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of Actinidia eriantha polysaccharide (AEPS) 
combined with PD1 antibody therapy in colorectal cancer-xenograft mice.
METHODS: CT26 cells were inoculated into 80 C57BL/6 mice to establish the 
colorectal cancer xenograft-mouse model. Mice were divided evenly into a model 
group, AEPS group, anti-PD1 group, and combined group. AEPS 5mL/kg•day was given 
orally and 10 mg/kg anti-PD1 injected intravenously for 28 days. Tumor growth 
and mouse survival were observed. Tumor-cell proliferation and metastasis 
markers Ki67, N-cadherin, KLF4, and Oct4 were detected with immunochemistry and 
Western blotting, T-cell infiltration in spleens and tumors was detected with 
MTT and flow cytometry. IFNγ and TNFα were detected with ELISA.
RESULTS: Tumor growth was significantly retarded and survival prolonged in the 
AEPS, anti-PD1, and combined groups. Ki67 expression decreased in the anti-PD1 
and combined groups, and N-cadherin, KLF4, and Oct4 expression decreased in the 
AEPS and combined groups. IFNγ and TNFα levels, T-cell infiltration in spleen, 
and tumor all increased distinctively in the AEPS and combined groups. The 
combined group showed better antitumor effects and life-extension effect than 
the other two groups.
CONCLUSION: AEPS and PD1 antibody-combination therapy can suppresses tumor 
growth and prolong survival of colorectal cancer-xenograft mice by regulating 
immunofunction, and the combined therapy showed better therapeutic efficacy than 
the single treatment.

PURPOSE: Molecular-based targeted therapy has improved life expectancy for 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it does not have to be 
inevitable that patients receiving third-generation EGFR-TKIs become drug 
resistant. EGFR C797S and MET amplification are common mechanisms of 
osimertinib. However, a large part of these potential drug mechanisms remains 
unknown, and further research is needed.
METHODS: Tumour and blood samples from forty advanced NSCLC patients were 
identified as acquired drug resistant to osimertinib. The NGS panel was applied 
to detect EGFR C797S and MET amplification in tumour tissues or plasma samples. 
Whole-exome sequencing was conducted in five pairs of tumour tissues obtained 
before osimertinib administration and after osimertinib resistance in patients 
without C797S/cMET amplification.
RESULTS: The overall C797S mutation rate was 20%, and MET amplification was 
detected in six out of sixteen C797S-negative samples. PDGFRA in the 
PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalling pathway, RASAL2, RIN3 and SOS2 in the RAS-Raf-ERK 
signalling pathway, PTK2 in the ERBB signalling pathway and ABCC1 and ABCB5 in 
the ABC membrane pump system were identified as candidate crucial genes of drug 
resistance to osimertinib.
CONCLUSION: EGFR C797S mutation and MET amplification are leading mechanisms for 
osimertinib resistance in lung cancer. The crucial potential mutated genes 
defined in our present study may need further validation in a considerable 
number of lung cancer patients.
