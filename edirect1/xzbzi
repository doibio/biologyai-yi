BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the potentially reduced life expectancy 
associated with spinal pain (i.e. low back and neck pain) in an ageing 
population, particularly after controlling for familial factors, including 
genetics.
METHODS: We investigated whether spinal pain increased the rate of all-cause and 
disease-specific cardiovascular mortality in older Danish twins aged ≥70 years. 
Data from 4391 participants collected at baseline were linked with the Danish 
Cause of Death Registry with the study ending on 31 December 2014. Two crude and 
adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analyses determined the rate of 
all-cause and disease-specific cardiovascular mortality by baseline spinal pain 
exposure; unpaired (total sample analysis) and twin pair (intra-pair analysis). 
Analyses were also adjusted for confounders; baseline physical functional 
ability and depressive symptoms. Competing risk regression models determined the 
rate of cardiovascular mortality, adjusting for similar confounders and using 
the total sample only.
RESULTS: Spinal pain was associated with an increased rate of all-cause 
mortality, hazard ratio (HR): 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.21]. 
There was no association between spinal pain and cardiovascular disease 
mortality, sub-distribution hazard ratio (SHR): 1.08 [95% CI 0.96-1.21]. After 
adjusting for confounders (physical functional ability and depressive symptoms), 
the association became non-significant. All intra-pair analyses were 
statistically non-significant, although greater in magnitude for monozygotic 
twins.
CONCLUSIONS: Older people reporting spinal pain have 13% increased risk of 
mortality per years lived but the connection is not causal. We found no 
association between spinal pain and cardiovascular-specific mortality. The 
influence of shared familial factors is unlikely.
SIGNIFICANCE: Older people reporting spinal pain have 13% increased risk of 
mortality per year lived. However, this association is not likely to be causal, 
with the relevant confounders contributing to this relationship. Thus, pain in 
the spine may be part of a pattern of poor health, which increases mortality 
risk in the older population.

Exposure to aflatoxin, a mycotoxin common in many foods, has been associated 
with child growth impairment in sub-Saharan Africa. To improve our understanding 
of growth impairment in relation to aflatoxin and other risk factors, we 
assessed biospecimens collected in Nepalese children at 15, 24, and 36 months of 
age for aflatoxin exposure. Children (N = 85) enrolled in the Bhaktapur, Nepal 
MAL-ED study encompassed the cohort analysed in this study. Exposure was 
assessed through a plasma biomarker of aflatoxin exposure: the AFB1-lysine 
adduct. The aflatoxin exposures in the study participants were compared to 
anthropometrics at each time period (length-for-age [LAZ], weight-for-age [WAZ], 
and weight-for-length [WLZ] z-scores), growth trajectories over time, age, and 
breastfeeding status. Results demonstrated chronic aflatoxin exposure in this 
cohort of children, with a geometric mean of 3.62 pg AFB1-lysine/mg albumin. 
However, the chronic aflatoxin exposure in this cohort was not significantly 
associated with anthropometric z-scores, growth trajectories, age, or feeding 
status, based on the available time points to assess aflatoxin exposure. Low 
mean levels of aflatoxin exposure and infrequent occurrence of stunting, 
wasting, or underweight z-score values in this cohort are possible contributing 
factors to a lack of evidence for an association. Further research is needed to 
examine whether a threshold dose of aflatoxin exists that could induce child 
growth impairment.

BACKGROUND: Among twenty amino acids, methionine has a special role as it is 
coded by the translation initiation codon and methionyl-tRNAi (Met-tRNAi) is 
required for the assembly of the translation initiation complex. Thus methionine 
may play a special role in global gene regulation. Methionine has also been 
known to play important roles in cell growth, development, cancer, and aging. In 
this work, we characterize the translational and transcriptional programs 
induced by methionine restriction (MetR) and investigate the potential 
mechanisms through which methionine regulates gene expression, using the budding 
yeast S. cerevisiae as the model organism.
RESULTS: Using ribosomal profiling and RNA-seq, we observed a broad spectrum of 
gene expression changes in response to MetR and identified hundreds of genes 
whose transcript level and/or translational efficiency changed significantly. 
These genes show clear functional themes, suggesting that cell slows down its 
growth and cell cycle progression and increases its stress resistance and 
maintenance in response to MetR. Interestingly, under MetR cell also decreases 
glycolysis and increases respiration, and increased respiration was linked to 
lifespan extension caused by caloric restriction. Analysis of genes whose 
translational efficiency changed significantly under MetR revealed different 
modes of translational regulation: 1) Ribosome loading patterns in the 5'UTR and 
coding regions of genes with increased translational efficiency suggested 
mechanisms both similar and different from that for the translational regulation 
of Gcn4 under general amino acid starvation condition; 2) Genes with decreased 
translational efficiency showed strong enrichment of lysine, glutamine, and 
glutamate codons, supporting the model that methionine can regulate translation 
by controlling tRNA thiolation.
CONCLUSIONS: MetR induced a broad spectrum of gene expression changes at both 
the transcriptional and translational levels, with clear functional themes 
indicative of the physiological state of the cell under MetR. Different modes of 
translational regulation were induced by MetR, including the regulation of the 
ribosome loading at 5'UTR and regulation by tRNA thiolation. Since MetR extends 
the lifespan of many species, the list of genes we identified in this study can 
be good candidates for studying the mechanisms of lifespan extension.

BACKGROUND: A consequence of the widespread uptake of anti-retroviral therapy 
(ART) is that the older South African population will experience an increase in 
life expectancy, increasing their risk for cardiometabolic diseases (CMD), and 
its risk factors. The long-term interactions between HIV infection, treatment, 
and CMD remain to be elucidated in the African population. The HAALSI cohort was 
established to investigate the impact of these interactions on CMD morbidity and 
mortality among middle-aged and older adults.
METHODS: We recruited randomly selected adults aged 40 or older residing in the 
rural Agincourt sub-district in Mpumalanga Province. In-person interviews were 
conducted to collect baseline household and socioeconomic data, self-reported 
health, anthropometric measures, blood pressure, high-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein (hsCRP), HbA1c, HIV-status, and point-of-care glucose and lipid levels.
RESULTS: Five thousand fifty nine persons (46.4% male) were enrolled with a mean 
age of 61.7 ± 13.06 years. Waist-to-hip ratio was high for men and women 
(0.92 ± 0.08 vs. 0.89 ± 0.08), with 70% of women and 44% of men being overweight 
or obese. Blood pressure was similar for men and women with a combined 
hypertension prevalence of 58.4% and statistically significant increases were 
observed with increasing age. High total cholesterol prevalence in women was 
twice that observed for men (8.5 vs. 4.1%). The prevalence of self-reported CMD 
conditions was higher among women, except for myocardial infarction, and women 
had a statistically significantly higher prevalence of angina (10.82 vs. 6.97%) 
using Rose Criteria. The HIV- persons were significantly more likely to have 
hypertension, diabetes, or be overweight or obese than HIV+ persons. 
Approximately 56% of the cohort had at least 2 measured or self-reported 
clinical co-morbidities, with HIV+ persons having a consistently lower 
prevalence of co-morbidities compared to those without HIV. Absolute 10-year 
risk cardiovascular risk scores ranged from 7.7-9.7% for women and from 
12.5-15.3% for men, depending on the risk score equations used.
CONCLUSIONS: This cohort has high CMD risk based on both traditional risk 
factors and novel markers like hsCRP. Longitudinal follow-up of the cohort will 
allow us to determine the long-term impact of increased lifespan in a population 
with both high HIV infection and CMD risk.

OBJECTIVES: Recent debates in the Netherlands on health care priority setting 
have focused on the relative value of gains generated by life-extending 
medicines for people with a terminal illness, mostly new cancer drugs. These 
treatments are generally expensive, provide relatively small health gains, and 
therefore usually do not meet common cost per QALY thresholds. Nevertheless, 
these drugs may be provided under the assumption that there is public support 
for making a special case for treatments for people with a terminal illness. 
This study investigated the views of the public in the Netherlands on a range of 
equity and efficiency considerations relevant to priority setting and examines 
whether there is public support for making such a special case.
METHODS: Using Q methodology, three viewpoints on important principles for 
priority setting were identified. Data were collected through ranking exercises 
conducted by 46 members of the general public in the Netherlands, including 11 
respondents with personal experience with cancer.
RESULTS: Viewpoint 1 emphasized that people have equal rights to healthcare and 
opposed priority setting on any ground. Viewpoint 2 emphasized that the care for 
terminal patients should at all times respect the patients' quality of life, 
which sometimes means refraining from invasive treatments. Viewpoint 3 had a 
strong focus on effective and efficient care and had no moral objection against 
priority setting under certain circumstances.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found little public support for the assumption that 
health gains in terminally ill patients are more valuable than those in other 
patients. This implies that the assumption that society is prepared to pay more 
for health gains in people who have only a short period of lifetime left does 
not correspond with societal preferences in the Netherlands.

The Challenge of Conditional Reimbursement: Stopping Reimbursement Can Be More 
Difficult Than Not Starting in the First Place!

BACKGROUND: Conditional reimbursement of new health technologies is increasingly 
considered as a useful policy instrument. It allows gathering more robust 
evidence regarding effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of new technologies 
without delaying market access. Nevertheless, the literature suggests that 
ending reimbursement and provision of a technology when it proves not to be 
effective or cost-effective in practice may be difficult.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate how policymakers and the general public in the 
Netherlands value removing a previously reimbursed treatment from the basic 
benefits package relative to not including a new treatment.
METHODS: To investigate this issue, we used discrete-choice experiments. Mixed 
multinomial logit models were used to analyze the data. Compensating variation 
values and changes in probability of acceptance were calculated for withdrawal 
of reimbursement.
RESULTS: The results show that, ceteris paribus, both the general public (n = 
1169) and policymakers (n = 90) prefer a treatment that is presently reimbursed 
over one that is presently not yet reimbursed.
CONCLUSIONS: Apparently, ending reimbursement is more difficult than not 
starting reimbursement in the first place, both for policymakers and for the 
public. Loss aversion is one of the possible explanations for this result. 
Policymakers in health care need to be aware of this effect before engaging in 
conditional reimbursement schemes.

BACKGROUND: Valid and relevant estimates of health state preference weights 
(HSPWs) for Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) categories are a key input of economic 
models evaluating treatments for traumatic brain injury (TBI).
OBJECTIVES: To characterize existing HSPW estimates, and model the EuroQol 
five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) from the GOS, to inform parameterization 
of future economic models.
METHODS: A systematic review of HSPWs for GOS categories following TBI was 
conducted using a highly sensitive search strategy implemented in an extensive 
range of information sources between 1975 and 2016. A cross-sectional mapping 
study of GOS health states onto the three-level EQ-5D UK tariff index values was 
also performed in patients with significant TBI (head region Abbreviated Injury 
Scale score ≥3) from the Victoria State Trauma Registry. A limited dependent 
variable mixture model was used to estimate the 12-month EQ-5D UK value set as a 
function of GOS category, age, and other explanatory variables.
RESULTS: Six unique HSPWs from five eligible studies were identified. All 
studies were at high risk of bias with limited applicability. The magnitude of 
HSPWs differed significantly between studies. Three class mixture models 
demonstrated excellent goodness of fit to the observed Victoria State Trauma 
Registry data. GOS category, age at injury, sex, comorbidity, and major 
extracranial injury all had significant independent effects on mean EQ-5D 
utility values.
CONCLUSIONS: The few available HSPWs for GOS categories are challenged by 
potential biases and restricted generalizability. Mixture models are presented 
to provide HSPWs for GOS categories consistent with the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence reference case.

BACKGROUND: Many decision-analytic models with varying structures have been 
developed to inform resource allocation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD).
OBJECTIVES: To review COPD models for their adherence to the best practice 
modeling recommendations and their assumptions regarding important aspects of 
the natural history of COPD.
METHODS: A systematic search of English articles reporting on the development or 
application of a decision-analytic model in COPD was performed in MEDLINE, 
Embase, and citations within reviewed articles. Studies were summarized and 
evaluated on the basis of their adherence to the Consolidated Health Economic 
Evaluation Reporting Standards. They were also evaluated for the underlying 
assumptions about disease progression, heterogeneity, comorbidity, and treatment 
effects.
RESULTS: Forty-nine models of COPD were included. Decision trees and Markov 
models were the most popular techniques (43 studies). Quality of reporting and 
adherence to the guidelines were generally high, especially in more recent 
publications. Disease progression was modeled through clinical staging in most 
studies. Although most studies (n = 43) had incorporated some aspects of COPD 
heterogeneity, only 8 reported the results across subgroups. Only 2 evaluations 
explicitly considered the impact of comorbidities. Treatment effect had been 
mostly modeled (20) as both reduction in exacerbation rate and improvement in 
lung function.
CONCLUSIONS: Many COPD models have been developed, generally with similar 
structural elements. COPD is highly heterogeneous, and comorbid conditions play 
an important role in its burden. These important aspects, however, have not been 
adequately addressed in most of the published models.

Results from a Well-Being Survey in the North West of England: Inequalities in 
EQ-5D-Derived Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy Are Mainly Driven by Pain and 
Mental Health.

BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of evidence that once quality-of-life 
decrements are factored in, health inequalities become more prominent than using 
life expectancy alone.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to understand what the drivers were in inequalities 
in quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE).
METHODS: This study used EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire data 
from a large survey from the North West of England (N = 11,500), which were 
combined with population and mortality data from administrative datasets, to 
calculate estimated QALE by deprivation quintile.
RESULTS: The gap in QALE between the most and least deprived quintiles was 16.8 
years in males and 14.5 years in females. The gap in health-related quality of 
life between the rich and the poor was most prominent in males and in the age 
group of 55 to 64 years. People who live in the least deprived areas are less 
likely to show any level of problems across all five domains of the EQ-5D than 
those who live in the most deprived areas. People from the least deprived areas 
are less likely to have severe problems on two domains: pain (odds ratio = 0.45 
[95% confidence interval 0.33-0.62]) and anxiety/depression (odds ratio = 0.3 
[95% confidence interval 0.19-0.47]).
CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that, in the North West of England, 
inequalities in QALE are driven by pain and anxiety/depression.

Economic evaluation conducted in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) provides information that decision makers find useful in many parts of 
the world. Ideally, clinical studies designed to assess the effectiveness of 
health technologies would include outcome measures that are directly linked to 
health utility to calculate QALYs. Often this does not happen, and even when it 
does, clinical studies may be insufficient for a cost-utility assessment. 
Mapping can solve this problem. It uses an additional data set to estimate the 
relationship between outcomes measured in clinical studies and health utility. 
This bridges the evidence gap between available evidence on the effect of a 
health technology in one metric and the requirement for decision makers to 
express it in a different one (QALYs). In 2014, ISPOR established a Good 
Practices for Outcome Research Task Force for mapping studies. This task force 
report provides recommendations to analysts undertaking mapping studies, those 
that use the results in cost-utility analysis, and those that need to critically 
review such studies. The recommendations cover all areas of mapping practice: 
the selection of data sets for the mapping estimation, model selection and 
performance assessment, reporting standards, and the use of results including 
the appropriate reflection of variability and uncertainty. This report is unique 
because it takes an international perspective, is comprehensive in its coverage 
of the aspects of mapping practice, and reflects the current state of the art.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate costs and outcomes of increasing access to bariatric 
surgery in obese adults and in population subgroups of age, sex, deprivation, 
comorbidity, and obesity category.
METHODS: A cohort study was conducted using primary care electronic health 
records, with linked hospital utilization data, for 3,045 participants who 
underwent bariatric surgery and 247,537 participants who did not undergo 
bariatric surgery. Epidemiological analyses informed a probabilistic Markov 
model to compare bariatric surgery, including equal proportions with adjustable 
gastric banding, gastric bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy, with standard 
nonsurgical management of obesity. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) and net monetary benefits at a threshold of £30,000 per QALY.
RESULTS: In a UK population of 250,000 adults, there may be 7,163 people with 
morbid obesity including 1,406 with diabetes. The immediate cost of 1,000 
bariatric surgical procedures is £9.16 million, with incremental discounted 
lifetime health care costs of £15.26 million (95% confidence interval 
£15.18-£15.36 million). Patient-years with diabetes mellitus will decrease by 
8,320 (range 8,123-8,502). Incremental QALYs will increase by 2,142 (range 
2,032-2,256). The estimated cost per QALY gained is £7,129 (range 
£6,775-£7,506). Net monetary benefits will be £49.02 million (range 
£45.72-£52.41 million). Estimates are similar for subgroups of age, sex, and 
deprivation. Bariatric surgery remains cost-effective if the procedure is twice 
as costly, or if intervention effect declines over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Diverse obese individuals may benefit from bariatric surgery at 
acceptable cost. Bariatric surgery is not cost-saving, but increased health care 
costs are exceeded by health benefits to obese individuals.

OBJECTIVE: In 2014, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended 
behavioral counseling interventions for overweight or obese adults with the 
following known cardiovascular disease risk factors: impaired fasting glucose 
(IFG), hypertension, dyslipidemia, or metabolic syndrome. We assessed the 
long-term cost-effectiveness (CE) of implementing the recommended interventions 
in the U.S.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a disease progression model to simulate the 
25-year CE of the USPSTF recommendation for eligible U.S. adults and subgroups 
defined by a combination of the risk factors. The baseline population was 
estimated using 2005-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES). The cost and effectiveness of the intervention were obtained from 
systematic reviews. Incremental CE ratios (ICERs), measured in 
cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), were used to assess the CE of the 
intervention compared with no intervention. Future QALYs and costs (reported in 
2014 U.S. dollars) were discounted at 3%.
RESULTS: We estimated that ∼98 million U.S. adults (44%) would be eligible for 
the recommended intervention. Compared with no intervention, the ICER of the 
intervention would be $13,900/QALY. CE varied widely among subgroups, ranging 
from a cost saving of $302 per capita for those who were obese with IFG, 
hypertension, and dyslipidemia to a cost of $103,200/QALY in overweight people 
without these conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: The recommended intervention is cost effective based on the 
conventional CE threshold. Considerable variation in CE across the recommended 
subpopulations suggests that prioritization based on risk level would yield 
larger total health gains per dollar spent.

University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.

OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to economically evaluate universal HIV prenatal 
screening in Israel, a very low prevalence country (0.1%), compared with the 
current policy of testing only women belonging to high-risk (HR) groups.
DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analytical model was constructed. Life 
expectancies, direct medical costs and utility weights of an HIV-positive 
newborn and a healthy newborn were derived from the literature. Screening was 
assessed using fourth-generation combo tests. Structural uncertainties were 
discussed with leading Israeli HIV experts. Univariate and multivariate 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for uncertainty of the model's 
parameters.
RESULTS: Under the current policy, about 2700 women are tested annually 
identifying 27 HIV-positive women. With the universal screening, 171 000 women 
would be tested yearly identifying 37 as HIV positive. The analysis included the 
increased life expectancy of vertically infected children based on current 
standards of care. Over the lifetime expectancy, universal screening is 
projected to grant 15 additional quality-adjusted life years and save $177 521 
when compared with the current HR only policy.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal prenatal HIV screening is projected to be cost saving in 
Israel, despite a very low HIV prevalence in the general population.

PURPOSE: Besides cervical cancer, HPV infection is linked to a multitude of 
diseases in both males and females, suggesting that vaccination programmes 
should be re-evaluated, with a judicious assessment made of the disease burden 
stratified by sex, age, and genotype. Projections of burden into the near future 
are also needed to provide a benchmark for evaluating the impact of vaccination 
programmes, and to assess the need for scaling-up preventive measures.
METHODS: Using the disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) measure, we estimated 
the total HPV-associated disease burden in the Netherlands. Annual cancer 
registrations over the period 1989-2014 for all cancers with an aetiological 
link to HPV infection were retrieved, supplemented by incidence data on 
high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and anogenital warts.
RESULTS: Over the recent period 2011-2014, the average annual HPV disease burden 
was 10,600 DALYs (95% credible interval (CrI):10,260-10,960) in females and 
3,346 DALYs (95% CrI: 2,973-3,762) in males. Burden was dominated by cervical 
cancer, but its share amongst women decreased from 89% in 1989 to 77% in 2014. 
The male share of the total disease burden increased from 9.8% in 1989 to 26% in 
2014. In 2023 (before the expected clinical impact from vaccinating girls), 
total burden is forecasted at 1.3-fold larger than in 2014.
CONCLUSIONS: The HPV-associated disease burden is higher than that reported for 
any other infectious disease in the Netherlands, with a larger burden observed 
in women than in men. The rapidly rising male share of the total burden 
underlines the prioritization of male HPV-related disease in prevention 
programmes.

BACKGROUND: A validated prediction model estimates the absolute benefit of 
intensive versus standard lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) with statins on next 
major cardiovascular events for individual patients with coronary artery 
disease. We aimed to assess whether targeting intensive LLT therapy to coronary 
artery disease patients with the highest predicted absolute benefit is 
cost-effective compared to treating all with standard or all with intensive LLT.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A lifetime Markov model was constructed for coronary artery 
disease patients (n=10 000) with mean age 61 years. Number of major 
cardiovascular events, (non) vascular death, costs, and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) were estimated for the following strategies: (1) standard LLT for 
all (reference strategy); (2) intensive LLT for those with 5-year absolute major 
cardiovascular events risk reduction (ARR) ≥3%, ≥2.3%, or ≥1.5% (corresponding 
to ≥20%, ≥15%, or ≥10% 5-year major cardiovascular events risk); and (3) 
intensive LLT for all. With intensive LLT for those with ≥3% 5-year ARR (13% of 
patients), 380 QALYs were gained for €2423/QALY. Using a threshold of ≥2.3% ARR 
(26% of patients), 630 QALYs were gained for €5653/QALY. Using a threshold of 
≥1.5% ARR (56% of patients), 1020 QALYs were gained for €10 960/QALY. By 
treating all intensively, 1410 QALYs were gained (0.14 QALY per patient) for 
€17 223/QALY. With benefit-based treatment, 0.16 to 0.17 QALY was gained per 
treated patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Intensive LLT with statins for all coronary artery disease patients 
results in the highest overall QALY gain against acceptable costs. However, the 
number of QALYs gained with intensive LLT by statins in individual patients can 
be increased with selective benefit-based treatment.

Bearings are widely used in various industries to support rotating shafts. Their 
failures accelerate failures of other adjacent components and may cause 
unexpected machine breakdowns. In recent years, nonlinear vibration responses 
collected from a dynamic rotor-bearing system have been widely analyzed for 
bearing diagnostics. Numerous methods have been proposed to identify different 
bearing faults. However, these methods are unable to predict the future health 
conditions of bearings. To extend bearing diagnostics to bearing prognostics, 
this paper reports the design of a state space formulation of nonlinear 
vibration responses collected from a dynamic rotor-bearing system in order to 
intelligently predict bearing remaining useful life (RUL). Firstly, analyses of 
nonlinear vibration responses were conducted to construct a bearing health 
indicator (BHI) so as to assess the current bearing health condition. Secondly, 
a state space model of the BHI was developed to mathematically track the health 
evolution of the BHI. Thirdly, unscented particle filtering was used to predict 
bearing RUL. Lastly, a new bearing acceleration life testing setup was designed 
to collect natural bearing degradation data, which were used to validate the 
effectiveness of the proposed bearing prognostic method. Results show that the 
prediction accuracy of the proposed bearing prognostic method is promising and 
the proposed bearing prognostic method is able to reflect future bearing health 
conditions.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the effect of scrambler therapy on patients with 
chronic cancer pain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective, observational study conducted on 
patients with chronic pain due to malignancy which is not responding to oral 
analgesics. A total of twenty patients were included in the study (ten males, 
ten females) with a visual analog scale score of >4 on oral analgesics. Patients 
aged 18-70 years with a life expectancy of >3 months having bony, neuropathic, 
or mixed type of pain were included in the study. A total of 12 sessions of 
scrambler therapy were planned, ten sessions on consecutive days and one session 
each on two follow-up visits after 1 week each. Each session lasted for 40 min. 
Pain relief and quality of life according to the World Health Organization 
Quality of Life were recorded as primary outcome variables.
RESULTS: All patients had good pain relief and improvement in all four domains 
of quality of life. Pain scores decreased significantly (P < 0.01) after each 
session and at each follow-up. Patients showed significant improvement in 
physical, psychological, social, and environmental health (P < 0.01) after the 
therapy.
CONCLUSION: Scrambler therapy offers a promising role in the pain physician's 
armamentarium as an adjunct to pharmacological therapy for the treatment of 
chronic drug-resistant cancer pain; it may bring down analgesic drug 
requirements significantly and improve quality of life in cancer patients. 
Larger prospective, randomized multicenter studies are needed to validate the 
findings of the small pilot studies published in literature so far.

OBJECTIVE: To illustrate our experience when managing a complex patient with 
potentially life-threatening bilateral otological disease facing multisensory 
compromise including complete loss of audiovestibular function and visual 
disturbance Clinical presentation: A 67 year old lady, presented with a large 
left vestibular schwannoma and extensive right cholesteatoma encircling the otic 
capsule. She underwent translabyrinthine resection of the vestibular schwannoma, 
resulting in profound sensorineural hearing loss, vestibular hypofunction and 
corneal scarring following an initial temporary facial palsy. Due to the extent 
of the disease and good right-sided bone conduction thresholds, the 
cholesteatoma was managed conservatively utilising a bone-anchored-hearing-aid 
with regular review by the Skull-Base team. However, following acute 
deterioration in hearing and disease extension threatening right facial nerve 
function, the decision was taken for surgical intervention with a view to staged 
cochlear implantation (CI).
INTERVENTION: Our patient underwent right lateral petrousectomy, total osseous 
labyrinthectomy, and implantation of an intracochlear 'dummy' with blind sac 
closure of the external auditory canal. Recovery was excellent with no further 
deterioration in balance and no loss of facial nerve function. CI occurred 3 
months post-operatively with good functional outcome.
CONCLUSION: We present the management of bilateral complex otoneurological 
disease with significant risk of multisensory compromise. Size of the left 
vestibular schwannoma necessitated surgical resection with resultant loss of 
ipsilateral audiovestibular function. Due to residual right audiovestibular 
function and the risks of surgery, the extensive right cholesteatoma was managed 
conservatively until disease progression necessitated surgical intervention. 
Subsequently it was possible to restore access to open-set speech with a right 
CI.
