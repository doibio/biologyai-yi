Well-planned urban infrastructure should meet critical loads during its design 
lifetime. In order to proceed with design, engineers are forced to make numerous 
assumptions with very little supporting information about the development of 
various drivers. For the wastewater sector, these drivers include the future 
amount and composition of the generated wastewater, effluent requirements, 
technologies, prices of inputs such as energy or chemicals, and the value of 
outputs produced such as nutrients for fertilizer use. When planning wastewater 
systems, there is a lack of methods to address discrepancies between the 
timescales at which fundamental changes in these drivers can occur, and the long 
physical life expectancy of infrastructure (on the order of 25-80 years). To 
explore these discrepancies, we take a hindsight perspective of the long-term 
development of wastewater infrastructure and assess the stability of assumptions 
made during previous designs. Repeatedly we find that the drivers influencing 
wastewater loads, environmental requirements or technological innovation can 
change at smaller timescales than the infrastructure design lifetime, often in 
less than a decade. Our analysis shows that i) built infrastructure is 
continuously confronted with challenges it was not conceived for, ii) 
significant adaptation occurs during a structure's lifetime, and iii) 
"muddling-through" is the pre-dominant strategy for adaptive management. As a 
consequence, we argue, there is a need to explore robust design strategies which 
require the systematic use of scenario planning methods and instruments to 
increase operational, structural, managerial, institutional and financial 
flexibility. Hindsight studies, such as this one, may inform the development of 
robust design strategies and assist in the transition to more explicit forms of 
adaptive management for urban infrastructures.

OBJECTIVE: The pulsed laser-induced liquid jet (LILJ) system is an emerging 
surgical instrument intended to assist both maximal removal of the lesion and 
functional maintenance through preservation of fine vessels and minimal damage 
to the surrounding tissue. The system ejects the minimum required amount of 
pulsed water through a handy bayonet-shaped catheter. We have already shown a 
significant increase in removal rate, in addition to a noteworthy reduction of 
intraoperative blood loss and procedure time in the treatment of large pituitary 
and skull base tumors in a single-institution series. The present study 
evaluated the safety of the system in multiple institutions.
METHODS: The study included 46 patients, 29 men and 17 women (mean age: 59.1 
years) who underwent microsurgical/endoscopic resection of lesions in or in the 
vicinity of the pituitary fossa through the transsphenoidal approach between 
October 2011 and June 2012 at six institutions. The histologic diagnoses were 
pituitary adenoma (31 cases), meningioma (4), craniopharyngioma (3), cavernous 
angioma (2), and Rathke cyst cleft (1). Lesion volume ranged from 2.0 to 30.4 
cm³ (mean: 3.7 cm³). Cavernous sinus invasion was observed in 11 cases and 
suprasellar extension in 29 cases.
RESULTS: Preservation of intralesional arteries (diameter: 150 µm) was achieved 
in all situations in > 80% of cases. Intended surgical steps were achieved 
except for some restrictions in motion due to the use of an optical quartz 
fiber. No complications occurred directly related to the use of the device.
CONCLUSIONS: The LILJ system can be used for safe removal of lesions in or in 
the vicinity of the pituitary fossa.

Members of the family of Streptomycetaceae, the main producer of antibiotics and 
other secondary metabolites, are Gram-positive multi-cellular soil bacteria with 
a complex life cycle. By apical tip extension Streptomyces coelicolor forms a 
multiply branching vegetative mycelium penetrating the substrate. Upon nutrient 
limitation, a hydrophobic aerial mycelium is erected, which eventually develops 
into a regular chain of spores that are able to survive detrimental 
environmental conditions. Morphological differentiation involves a switch in the 
peptidoglycan synthesizing machinery. Whereas apical tip extension is directed 
by the so-called polarisome, sporulation septation and synthesis of the 
thickened spore wall involves a multi-protein complex, which resembles the 
elongasome of rod-shaped bacteria. The Streptomyces spore wall synthesizing 
complex (SSSC) does not only direct synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer but is 
also involved in the incorporation of anionic spore wall glycopolymers, which 
contribute to the resistance of spores. The SSSC also contains eukaryotic type 
serine/threonine kinases which might control its activity by 
protein-phosphorylation.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the loss in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in 
Korean adults due to 13 noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in 2010 and predict 
changes in QALY loss through to the year 2040.
METHODS: Thirteen NCDs (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, stroke, 
myocardial infarction, angina, arthritis, osteoporosis, asthma, allergic 
rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, cataract, and depression) were selected from the 
Korean Community Health Survey 2010. The EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire 
index from the Korean Community Health Survey 2010 and the Korean valuation set 
were used to estimate utility weights according to sex, age, and disease. 
Morbidity data were also obtained from the Korean Community Health Survey 2010. 
Mortality data according to disease and life expectancy were retrieved from the 
Korean Statistical Information Service. To predict future QALY loss, future 
population projection data from the Korean Statistical Information Service were 
used as substitutes for 2010 population size.
RESULTS: Among the assessed 13 NCDs, the largest total QALY loss was for 
hypertension (513,113 QALYs; units are omitted hereafter), followed by arthritis 
(509,317) and stroke (431,049). The largest QALY loss due to mortality was 
stroke (306,733), whereas the largest QALY loss due to morbidity was arthritis 
(502,513). By applying the middle estimate of future population, the largest 
increase in total QALY loss between 2010 and 2040 was for hypertension 
(840,582), followed by stroke (719,076) and diabetes mellitus (474,607).
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension, arthritis, and stroke are important in terms of total 
QALY loss, which will continuous to increase because of aging. These results 
could be used to develop cost-effective interventions that reduce the burden of 
NCDs.

Proposition of a protocol to evaluate upper-extremity functional deficits and 
compensation mechanisms: application to elbow contracture.

OBJECTIVE: Instrumented gait analysis is widely accepted as an objective 
assessment of lower-extremity function. Conversely, upper-extremity function 
suffers from lack of objective evaluation. The present paper aims at proposing a 
protocol to be used to clinically and objectively evaluate upper-extremity 
function whatever the pathological joint. Secondly, it aims at better 
understanding the consequences on upper-extremity function and the compensation 
mechanisms induced by elbow contracture. Elbow contracture was simulated in this 
study by using a brace.
DESIGN: Twelve healthy subjects followed an instrumented 3D movement analysis 
while performing 11 daily life movements. The movements were performed with 3 
different elbow contracture conditions, simulated by wearing an adjustable elbow 
brace.
RESULTS: The proposed protocol was successful in creating a wide range of motion 
at all the upper-extremity joints. The activity-related range of motion and the 
mean range of motion computed on the whole set of daily life movements were 
effective in evaluating the severity of elbow contracture. The lack of elbow 
flexion was compensated by trunk flexion, hand flexion and radial deviation, and 
combined movement of shoulder flexion, abduction, and humeral internal rotation. 
Deficit in elbow extension was mainly compensated by the use of trunk flexion.
CONCLUSION: A protocol could be proposed for the objective evaluation of 
upper-extremity function. Its application to elbow contracture suggests that 
loss of elbow flexion affects more movements than loss of elbow extension.

The aim of cost-utility analysis is to support decision making in healthcare by 
providing a standardised mechanism for comparing resource use and health 
outcomes across programmes of work. The focus of this paper is the denominator 
of the cost-utility analysis, specifically the methodology and statistical 
challenges associated with calculating QALYs from patient-level data collected 
as part of a trial. We provide a brief description of the most common 
questionnaire used to calculate patient level utility scores, the EQ-5D, 
followed by a discussion of other ways to calculate patient level utility scores 
alongside a trial including other generic measures of health-related quality of 
life and condition- and population-specific questionnaires. Detail is provided 
on how to calculate the mean QALYs per patient, including discounting, adjusting 
for baseline differences in utility scores and a discussion of the implications 
of different methods for handling missing data. The methods are demonstrated 
using data from a trial. As the methods chosen can systematically change the 
results of the analysis, it is important that standardised methods such as 
patient-level analysis are adhered to as best as possible. Regardless, 
researchers need to ensure that they are sufficiently transparent about the 
methods they use so as to provide the best possible information to aid in 
healthcare decision making.

Marfan syndrome is a heritable disorder of connective tissue leading to aortic 
aneurysms and other cardiovascular complications associated with reduced life 
expectancy. Although contemporary management of ascending aortic disease 
requires open surgical reconstruction, the combined retrograde visceral 
revascularization and endovascular exclusion (hybrid procedure) of entire 
thoracoabdominal aorta has been introduced for the management of descending 
thoracic and abdominal aortic pathology. The present experience reports 2 cases 
of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, in Marfan patients, previously submitted 
to major cardiovascular surgical procedures, through a hybrid approach.

Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for peripheral artery disease. 
Life expectancy is 41 months for diabetic patients with an ischemic ulcer. The 
characteristics of diabetic arteriopathy make its treatment more difficult than 
in non-diabetic patients. Few data are available about the surgical treatment of 
arteriopathy in diabetic patients (including angioplasty or bypass), especially 
in case of distal arteriopathy. The choice of the procedure depends on multiple 
factors such as the disease localization, its extent, distal blood flow and 
vascular disease-related surgical risk. The principal aim of revascularisation 
is to restore direct flow to the foot in order to ensure wound healing and limb 
salvage. With percutaneous endoluminal angioplasty, limb salvage can be achieved 
in more than 80% of patients at 1-3 years. The percutaneous procedure is less 
invasive than open surgery, there are fewer complications, and morbidity and 
mortality rates are reduced; moreover, a second procedure remains possible in 
the future. With bypass surgery, the rate of limb salvage exceeds 80% at five 
years. Nevertheless, peri-operative mortality reaches 3% and arterial anatomy, 
patient-related risks factors or venous graft availability may be limitations. 
New endovascular techniques especially designed for the distal arteries of the 
lower limbs enable very distal revascularization with morbidity and mortality 
rates lower than with surgery.

Rational expectations? An explorative study of subjective survival probabilities 
and lifestyle across Europe.

Assessment, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Subjective survival probabilities (SSPs) are considered relevant in 
relation to lifestyle as lifestyle improvements may improve health and lower 
mortality risk.
OBJECTIVE: To study individuals' SSP in a population of elderly (i.e. 60 years 
and older) from 15 European countries.
METHODS: Data from the second wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and 
Retirement in Europe (SHARE) were used. Individuals were asked about their 
chances to live up to age [T] or more. These SSPs were related to general 
characteristics, health and lifestyle. In addition, cross-country comparisons 
were made. The validity of the probabilistic elicitation format used for 
collecting SSPs was also addressed.
RESULTS: The average subjective probability of surviving the next 9-15 years was 
around 57%. Mean SSPs varied significantly across age, with lower means at 
higher ages. Cross-country comparisons showed lowest mean in the Czech Republic 
(42%) and the highest in Denmark (64%). SSPs correlated with socio-demographic, 
socio-economic and also strongly with (objective) health characteristics except 
for obesity. Smokers reported significantly lower SSPs compared to non-smokers, 
but no difference was found between non-smokers and quitters. Excessive alcohol 
consumers reported significantly higher SSPs than moderate consumers and 
abstainers, but this only held for female excessive drinkers. Physical 
inactivity was negatively associated with SSPs, but this relation was attenuated 
at higher ages. In this context, important cross-country differences were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Subjective survival probabilities are informative and relevant in 
relation to lifestyle decisions and can be validly obtained in elder people. The 
results from this study provide interesting implications for health policy, 
health communication strategies and future research.

Development of cancer resistance, cancer relapse and metastasis are attributed 
to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Eradication of this subpopulation 
has been shown to increase life expectancy of patients. Since the discovery of 
CSCs a decade ago, several strategies have been devised to specifically target 
them but with limited success. Nanocarriers have recently been employed to 
deliver anti-CSC therapeutics for reducing the population of CSCs at the tumor 
site with great success. This review discusses the different therapeutic 
strategies that have been employed using nanocarriers, their advantages, success 
in targeting CSCs and the challenges that are to be overcome. Exploiting this 
new modality of cancer treatment in the coming decade may improve outcomes 
profoundly with promise of effective treatment response and reducing relapse and 
metastasis.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the indirect economic burden of disease-related premature 
deaths in China, 2012.
METHODS: Both human capital approach and friction cost methods were used to 
compute the indirect economic burden of premature deaths from the following 
sources: mortality from the national disease surveillance system in 2012, 
average annual income per capita from the China Statistic Yearbook in 2012, 
population size from the 2010 China census, and life expectancy in China from 
the World Health Organization life table.
RESULTS: Data from the Human Capital Approach Estimates showed that the indirect 
economic burden of premature deaths in China was 425.1 billion in 2012, 
accounting for 8‰ of the GDP. The indirect economic burden of chronic 
non-communicable diseases associated premature deaths was accounted for the 
highest proportion(67.1%, 295.4 billion), followed by those of injuries related 
premature deaths (25.6% , 108.9 billion), infectious diseases, maternal and 
infants diseases, and malnutrition related deaths (6.4% , 26.9 billion). The top 
five premature deaths that cause the indirect economic burden were malignancy, 
cardiovascular diseases, unintentional injuries, intentional injuries, and 
diseases of the respiratory system. The indirect economic burden of premature 
deaths mainly occurred in the population of 20-59 year-olds. Under the Friction 
Cost method, the estimates appeared to be 0.11%-3.49% of the total human capital 
approach estimates.
CONCLUSION: Premature death caused heavy indirect economic burden in China. 
Chronic non-communicable diseases and injuries seemed to incur the major disease 
burden. The indirect economic burden of premature deaths mainly occurred in the 
working age group.

Introducing stage-specific spatial distribution into the Levins metapopulation 
model.

Nakazawa T(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Life Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, No.1, University 
Road, Tainan City 701, Taiwan.

The Levins model is a classical but still widely used metapopulation model that 
describes temporal changes in the regional abundance of a species by extinction 
and colonization of subpopulations. A fundamental assumption of the model is 
that the landscape is homogeneous and the species moves between identical 
patches at random. However, this assumption clearly contrasts with the common 
observation that different stages prefer or require different habitat types. 
Here I studied a minimum extension of the Levins model in which the species has 
stage-specific (juvenile and adult) spatial distributions and dispersal occurs 
at the timing of reproduction and maturation (i.e., ontogenetic habitat shifts). 
I examined how the persistence of the stage-structured metapopulations would be 
affected by rescue effect and interspecific competition. The models predict that 
rates of ontogenetic habitat shifts are particularly crucial for the persistence 
or coexistence of stage-structured metapopulations because the species need to 
complete biphasic life cycles. The present study opens a new avenue for 
exploring stage- and space-structured population dynamics and will contribute to 
better landscape management for the conservation of stage-structured animals.

BACKGROUND: Loss of motion is a well-known complication after elbow trauma and 
in severe cases, arthrolysis of elbow is the procedure of choice. The posterior 
approach might have some advantages especially in post-traumatic patients who 
have undergone the same surgical approach in the past.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term outcomes of 
elbow arthrolysis through posterior approach. Moreover, we assessed the effect 
of operation on the patients' quality of life.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a retrospective-cohort study, the medical records 
of 14 patients (12 men, two women) whose range of movement had been limited 
post-traumatically and had undergone elbow arthrolysis with posterior approach 
were reviewed. Before intervention, the patients had a flexion less than 100 
degrees or an extension lag of 30 degrees or more. For evaluation of the final 
outcomes, they were invited to participate in our study and the final range of 
motion, visual analogue score (VAS), disability of arm, shoulder and hand 
(DASH), Mayo elbow score (MES) and short form health survey (SF-36) scores were 
measured in the patients.
RESULTS: Mean age of the participants was 28.7 years. The interval from initial 
injury and arthrolysis was 16 months and the patients were followed for 14 
months. The mean range of motion in patients before surgery was 35.8 degrees, 
which was increased to a mean of 108.9 after the surgery, indicating a 73.1 
degrees improvement. The means of VAS, DASH, Mayo elbow and SF-36 scores in the 
patients were 1.6, 34, 68 and 43, respectively. A significant inverse 
correlation was found between the preoperative range of motion and final range 
of motion.
CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, elbow arthrolysis through posterior 
approach could be an effective technique with low complications. Since the final 
range of motion improved significantly, it might be a valuable method in 
promoting the patients' quality of life.

Influenza is one of the most common infections of the upper respiratory tract. 
Antiviral drugs that are currently used to treat influenza, such as oseltamivir 
and zanamivir, are neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors. However, the virus may develop 
resistance through single-point mutations of NA. Antiviral resistance is 
currently monitored by a labelled enzymatic assay, which can be inconsistent 
because of the short half-life of the labelled product and variations in the 
assay conditions. In this paper, we describe a label-free surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR) assay for measuring the binding affinity of NA-drug 
interactions. Wild-type (WT) NA and a histidine 274 tyrosine (H274Y) mutant were 
expressed in High Five™ (Trichoplusia ni) insect cells. A spacer molecule 
(1,6-hexanediamine) was site-specifically conjugated to the 7-hydroxyl group of 
zanamivir, which is not involved in binding to NA, and the construct was 
immobilized onto a SPR sensor Chip to obtain a final immobilization response of 
431 response units. Binding responses obtained for WT and H274Y mutant NAs were 
fitted to a simple Langmuir 1:1 model with drift to obtain the association (ka ) 
and dissociation (kd ) rate constants. The ratio between the binding affinities 
for the two isoforms was comparable to literature values obtained using labelled 
enzyme assays. Significant potential exists for an extension of this approach to 
test for drug resistance of further NA mutants against zanamivir and other 
antiviral drugs, perhaps paving the way for a reliable SPR biosensor assay that 
may replace labelled enzymatic assays.

surgical treatment.

Barcelona, Spain.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the life expectancy of surgically eligible children with 
refractory epilepsy comparing two treatment strategies: medical treatment only 
versus epilepsy surgery.
METHODS: Decision analysis model populated with available parameters from the 
literature. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses and second-order Monte Carlo 
simulations evaluated the robustness of the results across wide variations of 
the input parameters. The time horizon was lifetime and the main outcome was 
life expectancy.
RESULTS: Across the range of pediatric ages, epilepsy surgery yielded a higher 
life expectancy. For a cohort of 10-year-old children with refractory epilepsy, 
the gain in life expectancy with epilepsy surgery (compared to medical treatment 
only) was 5.9 years for temporal epilepsy and 5.6 years for extratemporal 
epilepsy. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses and second-order Monte Carlo 
simulations demonstrated the robustness of results across a wide variation of 
input parameters. There was no adjustment for quality of life, but we estimated 
the percentage of life expectancy spent in seizure freedom. For a cohort of 
10-year-old patients with refractory epilepsy: (1) in temporal lobe epilepsy, 
epilepsy surgery yielded 48.9% of life expectancy years in seizure freedom while 
medical treatment yielded 14.3%; and (2) in extratemporal epilepsy, epilepsy 
surgery yielded 43.0% of life expectancy years in seizure freedom while medical 
treatment yielded 14.3%.
SIGNIFICANCE: Epilepsy surgery yields a substantially higher life expectancy 
than continued medical treatment for surgically eligible children with 
refractory epilepsy. This conclusion remains robust across a wide range of 
parameter variations.

On the decomposition of life expectancy and limits to life.

Mayhew L(1), Smith D.

Author information:

Life expectancy is a measure of how long people are expected to live and is 
widely used as a measure of human development. Variations in the measure reflect 
not only the process of ageing but also the impacts of such events as epidemics, 
wars, and economic recessions. Since 1950, the influence of these events in the 
most developed countries has waned and life expectancy continues to lengthen 
unabated. As a result, it has become more difficult to forecast long-run trends 
accurately, or identify possible upper limits. We present new methods for 
comparing past improvements in life expectancy and also future prospects, using 
data from five developed, low-mortality countries. We consider life expectancy 
in 10-year age intervals rather than over the remaining lifetime, and show how 
natural limits to life expectancy can be used to extrapolate trends. We discuss 
the implications and compare our approach with other commonly used methods.

T-Brain-1 (TBR1), a causative gene in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), encodes 
a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. It is therefore possible that TBR1 
controls the expression of other autism risk factors. The downstream genes of 
TBR1 have been identified using microarray and promoter analyses. In this study, 
we annotated individual genes downstream of TBR1 and investigated any 
associations with ASDs through extensive literature searches. Of 124 TBR1 target 
genes, 23 were reported to be associated with ASDs. In addition, one gene, 
Kiaa0319, is a known causative gene for dyslexia, a disorder frequently 
associated with autism. A change in expression level in 10 of these 24 genes has 
been previously confirmed. We further validated the alteration of RNA expression 
levels of Kiaa0319, Baiap2, and Gad1 in Tbr1 deficient mice. Among these 24 
genes, four transcription factors Auts2, Nfia, Nr4a2, and Sox5 were found, 
suggesting that TBR1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism 
pathogenesis. A further five of the 24 genes (Cd44, Cdh8, Cntn6, Gpc6, and 
Ntng1) encode membrane proteins that regulate cell adhesion and axonal 
outgrowth. These genes likely contribute to the role of TBR1 in regulation of 
neuronal migration and axonal extension. Besides, decreases in Grin2b expression 
and increases in Gad1 expression imply that neuronal activity may be aberrant in 
Tbr1 deficient mice. These analyses provide direction for future experiments to 
reveal the pathogenic mechanism of autism.

Smoking cessation is the only strategy that has shown a lasting reduction in the 
decline of lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation 
interventions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, to assess 
the quality of the Markov models and to estimate the consequences of model 
structure and input data on cost-effectiveness. A systematic literature search 
was conducted in PubMed, Embase, BusinessSourceComplete and Econlit on June 11, 
2014. Data were extracted, and costs were inflated. Model quality was evaluated 
by a quality appraisal, and results were interpreted. Ten studies met the 
inclusion criteria. The results varied widely from cost savings to additional 
costs of €17,004 per quality adjusted life year. The models scored best in the 
category structure, followed by data and consistency. The quality of the models 
seems to rise over time, and regarding the results there is no economic reason 
to refuse the reimbursement of any smoking cessation intervention.

The biogenesis of ribosomes and their coordination of protein translation 
consume an enormous amount of cellular energy. As such, it has been established 
that the inhibition of either process can extend eukaryotic lifespan. Here, we 
used next-generation sequencing to compare ribosome-associated RNAs from normal 
strains of Caenorhabditis elegans to those carrying the life-extending daf-2 
mutation. We found a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), transcribed telomeric sequence 
1 (tts-1), on ribosomes of the daf-2 mutant. Depleting tts-1 in daf-2 mutants 
increases ribosome levels and significantly shortens their extended lifespan. We 
find tts-1 is also required for the longer lifespan of the mitochondrial clk-1 
mutants but not the feeding-defective eat-2 mutants. In line with this, the 
clk-1 mutants express more tts-1 and fewer ribosomes than the eat-2 mutants. Our 
results suggest that the expression of tts-1 functions in different longevity 
pathways to reduce ribosome levels in a way that promotes life extension.

The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine whether economic dependence 
on various natural resources is associated with lower investment in health, 
after controlling for countries' geographical and historical fixed effects, 
corruption, autocratic regimes, income levels, and initial health status. 
Employing panel data for 118 countries for the period 1990-2008, we find no 
compelling evidence in support of a negative effect of resources on healthcare 
spending and outcomes. On the contrary, higher dependence on agricultural 
exports is associated with higher healthcare spending, higher life expectancy, 
and lower diabetes rates. Similarly, healthcare spending increases with higher 
mineral intensity. Finally, more hydrocarbon resource rents are associated with 
less diabetes and obesity rates. There is however evidence that public health 
provision relative to the size of the economy declines with greater hydrocarbon 
resource-intensity; the magnitude of this effect is less severe in 
non-democratic countries.

Early treatment of psoriatic arthritis improves prognosis.

McLaughlin M(1), Ostör A.

Author information:
(1)University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital, UK.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease, affecting up to 1% 
of the adult population and up to 40% of those with psoriasis. There is no 
universally accepted definition or diagnostic criteria for the disease although 
the CASPAR classification of PsA is now the most widely used. PsA has a peak age 
of onset between 35 and 55 years with an equal gender distribution. Around 20% 
of patients develop PsA before psoriasis, often many years before skin or nail 
changes. Enthesitis, pain and tenderness at the insertion of any tendon onto the 
bone, is characteristic and screening for enthesitis should include palpation of 
the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, the medial condyle of the femur and the 
achilles tendon insertion. Diagnosis of PsA relies on a detailed history, 
particularly as many of the manifestations may be mild or transient, and 
therefore not reported by the patient. There may be a previous, current, or 
family history of psoriasis. There are no diagnostic blood tests for PsA. The 
presence of rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies does not preclude a 
diagnosis of PsA, but should prompt careful scrutiny of the diagnosis. X-rays of 
the hands and feet should be performed at baseline for all those with suspected 
inflammatory arthritis. Features of back pain that suggest an inflammatory 
cause, rather than a mechanical problem, include the presence of early morning 
stiffness and pain that is relieved by exercise and exacerbated by rest. Any 
patient with suspected inflammatory arthritis and a six-week history of painful, 
swollen joints should be referred for specialist assessment. Patients with PsA 
have a higher self-rated disease severity than those with psoriasis only and a 
60% higher risk of premature mortality than the general population, their life 
expectancy is estimated to be approximately three years shorter. Aggressive 
treatment of early stage progressive PsA can substantially improve the long-term 
prognosis.

INTRODUCTION: Success in the treatment of young people with cancer, as measured 
conventionally by survival rates, is mitigated by late effects of therapy that 
impose a burden of morbidity and limit life expectancy. Among these adverse 
sequelae are altered body composition, especially obesity, and compromised bone 
health in the form of osteoporosis and increased fragility. These outcomes are 
potentially reversible and even preventable. This study will examine measures of 
body composition and bone health in long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) in childhood and adolescence. These measures will be 
complemented by measures of physical activity and health-related quality of life 
(HRQL).
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Survivors of ALL who are at least 10 years from diagnosis, 
following treatment on uniform protocols, will undergo measurements of body mass 
index; triceps skin fold thickness and mid-upper arm circumference; fat mass, 
lean body mass, skeletal muscle mass and bone mineral density by dual energy 
X-ray absorptiometry; trabecular and cortical bone indices and muscle density by 
peripheral quantitative CT; physical activity by the Habitual Activity 
Estimation Scale; and HRQL by Health Utilities Index instruments. Descriptive 
measures will be used for continuous variables and number (percent) for 
categorical variables. Associations between variables will be assessed using 
Fisher's exact t test and the χ(2) test; correlations will be tested by the 
Pearson correlation coefficient.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the institutional research 
ethics board and is supported by a competitive funding award. Dissemination of 
the results will occur by presentations to scientific meetings and publications 
in peer-reviewed journals, and by posting summaries of the results on websites 
accessed by adolescent and young adult survivors of cancer.

"I don't mind damaging my own body" a qualitative study of the factors that 
motivate smokers to quit.

BACKGROUND: Although smoking prevalence in England has declined, one in five 
adults smoke. Smokers are at increased risk of a number of diseases, including 
COPD which affects an estimated 1.5 million people in England alone. This study 
aimed to explore issues relating to smoking behaviour and intention to quit that 
might be used to inform the development of cessation interventions. Issues 
explored included knowledge of smoking related disease, with a particular 
emphasis on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Understanding around 
risk of disease, including genetic risk was explored, as were features of 
appropriate and accessible cessation materials and support.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with a total 
of 30 individuals of which 17 were smoking cessation clients and 13 were 
professionals working within health care settings relevant to supporting smokers 
to quit. A largely purposive approach was taken to sampling, and data were 
analysed using the constant comparative method.
RESULTS: Knowledge of the smoking related disease COPD was limited. Smokers' 
concerns around risk of disease were influenced by their social context and were 
more focussed on how their smoking might impact on the health of their family 
and friends, rather than how it might impact on them as individuals. 
Participants felt the provision of genetic risk information may have a limited 
impact on motivation to quit. Genetic risk was considered to be a difficult 
concept to understand, particularly as increased risk does not mean an 
individual will definitely develop disease. In terms of cessation approaches, 
the use of visual media was consistently supported, as was the use of materials 
that linked directly with life experiences. Images of children inhaling second 
hand smoke for example, had a particular impact.
CONCLUSIONS: Public health messages around the risks of smoking and approaches 
to quitting should continue to have an emphasis on the dangers that an 
individual's smoking has on the lives of the people around them. More work also 
needs to be done to raise awareness around both the risk of COPD in smokers and 
the impact this disease has on quality of life and life expectancy.

Lower back pain is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal conditions in the 
developed world and accounts for significant health services use. The American 
College of Physicians and the American Pain Society have published a joint 
clinical guideline that recommends providing patients with information on 
prognosis and self-management, the use of medications with proven benefits and, 
for those who do not improve, consideration be given to the use of spinal 
manipulation (for acute lower back pain only), interdisciplinary rehabilitation,
