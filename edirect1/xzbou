Expectancies play a major role for the treatment outcome of a broad variety of 
immune-mediated conditions and may strengthen or mimic the effects of regular 
long-term therapies. This study adds to a recently published study of Kox et al. 
(PNAS 111:7379-7384, 2014) on the ability to voluntarily influence the 
physiological stress response in healthy men after a training program consisting 
of meditation, breathing techniques, and exposure to cold, which found highly 
promising results on the clinical, autonomic, and immune response to 
experimentally induced inflammation (using the experimental human endotoxemia 
model). Within this project, a number of variables were included to assess the 
role of generalized (optimism, neuroticism) and specific outcome expectancies 
(related to the effects of the training on health) on the response to endotoxin 
administration after training. Indications were found that especially the 
generalized outcome expectancy optimism is a potential determinant of the 
autonomic (epinephrine: rho = 0.76, p < .01) and immune response 
(interleukin-10: rho = 0.60, p < .05) to induced inflammation after training, 
whereas more specific expectations with regard to the effects of the training 
could be especially relevant for the clinical symptom report (flu-like symptoms: 
rho = -0.71, p < .01). This proof-of-principle study provides first indications 
for potential innovative treatments to change immune-modulating responses by 
means of psychological mechanisms. If replicated, these findings may be used for 
predicting training responses and potentiate their effects by means of 
optimism-inducing interventions in patients with immune-mediated rheumatic 
conditions.

When Opportunity Knocks Twice: Dual Living Kidney Donation, Autonomy and the 
Public Interest.

Bailey P, Huxtable R.

Living kidney transplantation offers the best treatment in terms of 
life-expectancy and quality of life for those with end-stage renal disease. The 
long-term risks of living donor nephrectomy, although real, are very small, with 
evidence of good medium-term outcomes. Who should be entitled to donate, and in 
which circumstances, is nevertheless a live question. We explore the ethical 
dimensions of a request by an individual to donate both of their kidneys during 
life: 'dual living kidney donation'. Our ethical analysis is tethered to a 
hypothetical case study in which a father asks to donate a kidney to each of his 
twin boys. We explore the autonomy of the protagonists, alongside different 
dimensions of the public interest, such as the need to protect not only the 
recipients, but also the donor and even the wider community. Whilst 
acknowledging objections to 'dual-donation', not least by reference to the harms 
that the donor might be expected to endure, we suggest there is a prima facie 
case for permitting this, provided that both donor and recipients are willing 
and that due attention is paid to such considerations as the autonomy and 
welfare of all parties, as well as to the wider ramifications of acting on such 
a request. We argue for broader interpretations of the concepts of autonomy and 
welfare, recognizing the importance of relationships and the relevance of more 
than merely physical well-being. Equipped with such a holistic assessment, we 
suggest there is a prima facie case for allowing 'dual living kidney donation'.

Aging is associated with body composition changes that lead to glucose 
intolerance and increased risk of diabetes. The incidence of diabetes increases 
with aging, and the prevalence has increased because of the increased life 
expectancy of the population. Lifestyle modifications through nutrition and 
exercise in combination with medications are the main components of diabetes 
management. The potential benefits of nutrition and exercise intervention in 
older people with diabetes are enormous. Nutrition and exercise training are 
feasible even in frail older people living in care homes and should take into 
consideration individual circumstances, cultural factors, and ethnic 
preferences.

BACKGROUND: Appendectomy remains the gold standard in the treatment of acute, 
uncomplicated appendicitis in the United States. Nonetheless, there is growing 
evidence that nonoperative management is safe and efficacious.
METHODS: We constructed a decision tree to compare nonoperative management of 
appendicitis with laparoscopic appendectomy in otherwise healthy adults. Model 
variables were abstracted from a literature review, data from the Healthcare 
Cost and Utilization Project data, the Medicare Physician Fee schedule, and the 
American College of Surgeons Surgical Risk Calculator. Uncertainty surrounding 
parameters of the model was assessed via 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Operative management cost $12,213 per patient. Nonoperative management 
without interval appendectomy (IA) was the dominant strategy, costing $1,865 
less and producing 0.03 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Nonoperative 
management with IA cost $4,271 more than operative management, but yielded only 
0.01 additional QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis suggested operative 
management would become the preferred strategy if the recurrence rate was >40.5% 
or the total cost of appendectomy was decreased to <$5,468. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis confirmed nonoperative management without IA was the 
preferred strategy in 95.6% of cases.
CONCLUSION: Nonoperative management without IA is the least costly, most 
effective treatment for acute, uncomplicated appendicitis and warrants further 
evaluation in a disease thought to be definitively surgical.

INTRODUCTION: The burden of disease and mortality associated with inguinal 
hernia in Africa, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, is very high. The purpose of 
this study is to show that International Cooperation work in the field of hernia 
repair is effective; it minimizes the delay in hernia repairs in the targeted 
population, and can prevent a large number of disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: As a part of an International Cooperation program, a 
total of 990 black patients with inguinal hernias were studied, in whom 
hernioplasty was performed using polypropylene mesh. The type of hernia and 
surgical technique were studied. Indicators of scientific and technical quality, 
indicators of efficiency and of effectiveness were analyzed. The results on the 
usefulness of interventions were calculated as avoided DALYs.
RESULTS: Surgery was performed on 926 patients with a total of 1033 hernia 
repairs. 87.2 % of the repairs were made with mesh. There was no mortality in 
the series, complications were minor, and 85.7 % of patients remained less than 
24 h in the center. There was a 2.8 % of recurrence, with a follow-up 58.7 % of 
the patients in the first year. 5014 DALYs were avoided, and the average of the 
avoided DALYs per patient was of 5.41.
CONCLUSIONS: Hernia repair with mesh in low development countries is a procedure 
with low morbidity and high effectiveness that can prevent a large number of 
DALYs.

Elective Urological Surgery Following Coronary Stent Implantation: To Whom, How 
To Do It?

Öztürk H(1).

Coronary artery disease is one of the most common diseases today and the primary 
cause of sudden death. The development of atherosclerosis and the incidence of 
symptomatic heart and vascular diseases increase depending on the average life 
expectancy in the elderly population. Stent applications in the treatment of 
coronary artery disease are quite widespread and are a standard procedure. Stent 
applications are applied to approximately 2 million people in the United States 
every year. Therefore, there is an increase in the number of patients with 
stents. This increase is an important and complex situation for patients who are 
planned for urological elective surgery. The necessity of treating the patient 
with the least morbidity and mortality, and supplying the balance in terms of 
the dose and duration of antiplatelet agents which are used for patients with 
stents who are planned for elective urological surgery, is main subject of our 
review. To whom and what should be the treatment are assessed accompanied by the 
literature.

Models of risk-taking as used in the social sciences may be improved by 
including concepts from life history theory, particularly environmental 
unpredictability and life expectancy. Community college students completed 
self-report questionnaires measuring these constructs along with several 
well-known correlates. The frequency of risk-taking was higher for those with 
higher future unpredictability beliefs and shorter lifespan estimates (as 
measured by the Future Lifespan Assessment developed for this study), and 
unpredictability beliefs remained significant after accounting for standard 
predictors, such as sex and temperament. The results demonstrate the usefulness 
of applying concepts from life history theory to enhance our understanding of 
human behavior.

Evaluating the Long-Term Health and Economic Impacts of Central Residential Air 
Filtration for Reducing Premature Mortality Associated with Indoor Fine 
Particulate Matter (PM2.5) of Outdoor Origin.

Much of human exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) of outdoor origin 
occurs in residences. High-efficiency particle air filtration in central 
heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is increasingly being 
used to reduce concentrations of particulate matter inside homes. However, 
questions remain about the effectiveness of filtration for reducing exposures to 
PM2.5 of outdoor origin and adverse health outcomes. Here we integrate 
epidemiology functions and mass balance modeling to estimate the long-term 
health and economic impacts of HVAC filtration for reducing premature mortality 
associated with indoor PM2.5 of outdoor origin in residences. We evaluate 11 
classifications of filters (MERV 5 through HEPA) using six case studies of 
single-family home vintages and ventilation system combinations located in 22 
U.S. cities. We estimate that widespread use of higher efficiency filters would 
reduce premature mortality by 0.002-2.5% and increase life expectancy by 
0.02-1.6 months, yielding annual monetary benefits ranging from $1 to $1348 per 
person in the homes and locations modeled herein. Large differences in the 
magnitude of health and economic impacts are driven largely by differences in 
rated filter efficiency and building and ventilation system characteristics that 
govern particle infiltration and persistence, with smaller influences 
attributable to geographic location.

[Rehabilitation for Motor Dysfunction in Patients with Cancer].

[Article in Japanese]

Advancements in cancer treatment have led to an increase in the 5-year survival 
rate to>50%for various cancers. However, cancer remains a serious disease that 
affects the patients' life. Cancer progression or invasive treatments may cause 
various disabilities in patients. For example, functional impairment is a 
typical problem leading to impaired activities of daily living and quality of 
life, extended hospital stay, and increased burden for the family. Optimal 
rehabilitation is needed to improve the motor function and activity of these 
patients. The number of reports that describe the effect of cancer 
rehabilitation has increased in recent years. On the basis of these reports, the 
Guideline Committee of the Japanese Association of Rehabilitation Medicine has 
published clinical guidelines for cancer rehabilitation in 2013. Providing a 
rehabilitation program, however, is sometimes problematic because the general 
condition of cancer patients is sometimes complicated by a fluctuating clinical 
course. To create a rehabilitation program for cancer patients, various factors 
should be taken into consideration, such as the severity of the dysfunction, 
life expectancy, and risk of complications. Among the potential complications, 
bone metastasis is the most serious problem. As the risk of skeletal-related 
events is increased by exercise or improvement in the activities of daily 
living, the merits and risks of rehabilitation need to be evaluated. To improve 
the quality of cancer rehabilitation, highly specialized education for 
physicians and therapists is needed.

Improving survival after endometrial cancer: the big picture.

Kwon JS(1).

Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada. Janice.Kwon@vch.ca.

To improve survival in women with endometrial cancer, we need to look at the 
"big picture" beyond initial treatment. Although the majority of women will be 
diagnosed with early stage disease and are cured with surgery alone, there is a 
subgroup of women with advanced and high-risk early stage disease whose life 
expectancy may be prolonged with the addition of chemotherapy. 
Immunohistochemistry will help to identify those women with Lynch syndrome who 
will benefit from more frequent colorectal cancer surveillance and genetic 
counseling. If they happen to be diagnosed with colorectal cancer, this 
information has an important therapeutic implication. And finally, because the 
majority of women will survive their diagnosis of endometrial cancer, they 
remain at risk for breast and colorectal cancer, so these women should be 
counselled about screening for these cancers. These three interventions will 
contribute to improving the overall survival of women with endometrial cancer.

Idiopathic (primary) achalasia: a review.

Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. Michael.vaezi@vanderbilt.edu.

Idiopathic achalasia is a primary esophageal motor disorder characterized by 
loss of esophageal peristalsis and insufficient lower esophageal sphincter 
relaxation in response to deglutition. Patients with achalasia commonly complain 
of dysphagia to solids and liquids, bland regurgitation often unresponsive to an 
adequate trial of proton pump inhibitor, and chest pain. Weight loss is present 
in many, but not all patients. Although the precise etiology is unknown, it is 
often thought to be either autoimmune, viral immune, or neurodegenerative. The 
diagnosis is based on history of the disease, barium esophagogram, and 
esophageal motility testing. Endoscopic assessment of the gastroesophageal 
junction and gastric cardia is necessary to rule out malignancy. Newer 
diagnostic modalities such as high resolution manometry help in predicting 
treatment response in achalasia based on esophageal pressure topography patterns 
identifying three phenotypes of achalasia (I-III) and outcome studies suggest 
better treatment response with types I and II compared to type III. Although 
achalasia cannot be permanently cured, excellent outcomes are achieved in over 
90 % of patients. Current medical and surgical therapeutic options (pneumatic 
dilation, endoscopic and surgical myotomy, and pharmacologic agents) aim at 
reducing the LES pressure and facilitating esophageal emptying by gravity and 
hydrostatic pressure of retained food and liquids. Either graded pneumatic 
dilatation or laparoscopic surgical myotomy with a partial fundoplication are 
recommended as initial therapy guided by patient age, gender, preference, and 
local institutional expertise. The prognosis in achalasia patients is excellent. 
Most patients who are appropriately treated have a normal life expectancy but 
the disease does recur and the patient may need intermittent treatment.

The Contribution of Smoking to Educational Gradients in U.S. Life Expectancy.

Ho JY(1), Fenelon A(2).

Researchers have documented widening educational gradients in mortality in the 
United States since the 1970s. While smoking has been proposed as a key 
explanation for this trend, no prior study has quantified the contribution of 
smoking to increasing education gaps in longevity. We estimate the contribution 
of smoking to educational gradients in life expectancy using data on white men 
and women ages 50 and older from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (N = 
283,430; 68,644 deaths) and the National Health Interview Survey (N = 584,811; 
127,226 deaths) in five periods covering the 1980s to 2006. In each period, 
smoking makes an important contribution to education gaps in longevity for white 
men and women. Smoking accounts for half the increase in the gap for white women 
but does not explain the widening gap for white men in the most recent period. 
Addressing greater initiation and continued smoking among the less educated may 
reduce mortality inequalities.

The global population is aging with significant gains in life expectancy 
particularly in the developed world. Consequently, greater focus on 
understanding the processes that underlie physiological aging has occurred. Key 
facets of advancing age include genomic instability, telomere shortening, 
epigenetic changes, and declines in immune function termed immunosenescence. 
Immunosenescence and its associated chronic low grade systemic "inflamm-aging" 
contribute to the development and progression of pulmonary disease in older 
individuals. These physiological processes predispose to pulmonary infection and 
confer specific and unique clinical phenotypes observed in chronic respiratory 
disease including late-onset asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 
pulmonary fibrosis. Emerging concepts of the gut and airway microbiome further 
complicate the interrelationship between host and microorganism particularly 
from an immunological perspective and especially so in the setting of 
immunosenescence. This review focuses on our current understanding of the aging 
process, immunosenescence, and how it can potentially impact on various 
pulmonary diseases and the human microbiome.

We present a case report of a patient with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) 
complicated by extracranial metastasis (ECM) whose survival of nearly four years 
surpassed the anticipated life expectancy given numerous negative prognostic 
factors including EGFRvIII-mutation, unmethylated MGMT promoter status, and ECM. 
Interestingly, while this patient suffered from locally aggressive disease with 
multiple intracranial recurrences, the proximal cause of death was progressive 
extracranial disease and complications related to pulmonary metastases. Herein, 
we review potential mechanisms of ECM with an emphasis upon glioblastoma 
molecular and genetic profiles and the potential implications of targeted agents 
such as bevacizumab.

β-thalassemia is the most common single gene disorder worldwide, in which 
hemoglobin β-chain production is decreased. Today, the life expectancy of 
thalassemic patients is increased because of a variety of treatment methods; 
however treatment related complications have also increased. The most common 
side effect is osteoporosis, which usually occurs in early adulthood as a 
consequence of increased bone resorption. Increased bone resorption mainly 
results from factors such as delayed puberty, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, 
ineffective hematopoiesis as well as hyperplasia of the bone marrow, parathyroid 
gland dysfunction, toxic effect of iron on osteoblasts, growth hormone (GH) and 
insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) deficiency. These factors disrupt the 
balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts by interfering with various 
molecular mechanisms and result in decreased bone density. Given the high 
prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in thalassemic patients and complexity 
of their development process, the goal of this review is to evaluate the 
molecular aspects involved in osteopenia and osteoporosis in thalassemic 
patients, which may be useful for therapeutic purposes.

With the increase in life expectancy in Brazil, concerns have grown about the 
most prevalent diseases in elderly people. Among these diseases are 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. 
Protein deposits related to the development of these diseases can pre-date the 
symptomatic phases by years. The tau protein is particularly interesting: it 
might be found in the brainstem and olfactory bulb long before it reaches the 
limbic cortex, at which point symptoms occur. Of the 14 brains collected in this 
study, the tau protein was found in the brainstems of 10 (71.42%) and in 
olfactory bulbs of 3 out 11. Of the 7 individuals who had a final diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), 6 presented tau deposits in some region of the 
brainstem. Our data support the idea of the presence of tau protein in the 
brainstem and olfactory bulb in the earliest stages of AD.

This article aimed to present a proposal for characterizing health regions in 
Brazil based on human development, contributing to the identification of 
comparable geographic areas for observation, analysis, and monitoring of 
performance in regionalized health systems. The dimensions of the Municipal 
Human Development Index were calculated for the health regions by aggregating 
data from municipalities, weighted by population size. The grouping of health 
regions in 5 groups, based on combinations of life expectancy, income, and 
schooling, was determined by the K-Means method. Approximately half of Brazil's 
health regions were classified as type 1 and the other half as types 3 to 5. The 
typology provides a clustering model for homogeneous health regions, consistent 
with the theoretical assumptions of PROADESS. The choice of well-established 
indicators and aggregation methods tends to facilitate their comprehension and 
use by the actors involved in the administration of the Brazilian Unified 
National Health System (SUS).

Advances in tobacco control in Brazil can be reflected in the decrease in 
prevalence over the past two decades. Death statistics and the occurrence of 
events and direct costs attributable to tobacco-related diseases have not been 
frequently estimated in the country. The goal of this article is to estimate the 
burden of smoking in 2011 regarding mortality, morbidity and medical care costs 
of the main tobacco-related diseases. A probabilistic microsimulation health 
economic model was built. The model incorporates the natural history, costs and 
quality of life of all the tobacco-related adult-specific diseases. Smoking was 
accountable for 147,072 deaths, 2.69 million years of life lost, 157,126 acute 
myocardial infarctions, 75,663 strokes, and 63,753 cancer diagnoses. The direct 
cost for the health system was of BRL 23.37 billion. The monitoring of 
tobacco-related burden is an important strategy to guide decision-makers and to 
strenghten health public policies.

Chronic transfusion therapy has played a central role in extending life 
expectancy for patients with hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia. However, 
this life-saving therapy is associated with numerous complications that now 
comprise the bulk of management considerations for patients with thalassemia. 
This review reports on the experience of the Thalassemia Longitudinal Cohort and 
reviews available literature to establish guidelines for the management of 
patients with thalassemia.

[Malignant Choroidal Melanoma in T4 Orbital Stage; Prosthesis of the Orbit].

[Article in Czech]

Furdová A, Ferková A, Krásnik V, Krčová I, Horkovičová K.

AIM: Diagnosis and treatment of tumors of the eye is extremely difficul; 
surgical treatment in advanced stages, when the tumor grows in the orbit, leads 
to extensive radical surgery of the face. The extent and nature of surgical 
procedures depends on the nature of the tumor process, in advanced stages is 
indicated mutilating surgery--exenteration of the orbit. Exenteration of the 
orbit due to the extrascleral extension of malignant melanoma of the uvea is 
very rare, unfortunately, even today in certain cases it is necessary to make 
such a mutilating surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case report--65 year old female patient, sent to our 
Departement in 2008 with the finding of the pigment deposits on the posterior 
pole of the left eye. Ultrasound study found elevations of up to 3 mm, she was 
asked to come for further control in three months interval. She did not coma, 
furthermore she sporadically attended another eye clinic. In 2011 she was 
treated for secondary glaucoma--cyclocryopexia. Due to pain another 
surgery--tarzoraphia was indicated. In 2012 she underwent surgery at St. 
Elisabeth Cancer Institute in Bratislava--Nefrectomia transperitoneally l. dx., 
excision hepatis. Histological examination in addition to the primary papillary 
renal carcinoma--mucinous tubular T1 Nx Mx type, found the metastasis of 
malignant melanoma to the liver and right kidney. She underwent the diagnostic 
procedure to find the origo of the melanoma. The patient was subsequently 
admitted to our clinic with blind painfull eye for enucleation. During the 
surgery the was found retrobulbar tumor ingrowth. Histopatholigical findings 
confirmed malignant melanoma. Indicated was exenteration of the orbit due to 
malignant melanoma T4 N0 M2 stage in June 2012. After healing of the cavity she 
was recommended to design an individual prosthesis. After completing several 
courses of palliative chemotherapy during a recent review in January 2015 the 
patient is without recurrence of the melanoma in the orbit
RESULTS: Histological examination confirmed malignant melanoma in stage G2, 
predominantly epithelioid type, spindle cell type in part B of pips, tumor fills 
the entire back and part of the anterior chamber, grows through the sclera and 
optic nerve is completely overgrown by tumor mass and spreads into orbit. The 
immunophenotype is suggesting a better prognosis (S100+, melanoma+, +HMB45, 
cyklin D1 3%, 10% of p53, Ki67 3%). Tissue eyelashes were infiltrated by 
numerous micrometastases. The patient after exenteration of the orbit after 3 
months got an individual epithesis. Local orbit cavity is more than 24 months 
after exenteration without recurrence of melanoma. The patient is still 
undergoing outpatient chemotherapy and feels good.
CONCLUSION: The treatment of malignant tumors of the orbit and the eye is 
difficult, in most cases surgical treatment is indicated, with the additional 
radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Malignant tumors at an advanced stage should 
to be solved radically. Exenteration of the orbit leads to produce a large 
defect in the orbit and this part of the face. Patients in the active age after 
surgery followed by facial defects after such procedures have disadvantage in 
work and thie defect leads to serious socio-economic challenges. Patients with 
individually made prosthesis comprising a refund of the eyeball and the 
surrounding soft tissues allow active life and full application of the private 
as well as professional life.

Aging is one of the most important societal challenges that western societies 
face, as a result of longer life expectancy and reduced natality rates. Aging is 
a success story of our health and social systems, but raises sustainability 
issues that are linked to the increased need for services of older adults, due 
to the reduction of their independence and to the co-existence of multiple 
chronic diseases. The metabolic syndrome can be considered an age-related 
disease, since its prevalence increases with age. Current demographic trends in 
the population highlight aging-related dysfunctions that contribute to the onset 
of several metabolic diseases, and the need for innovative, effective and 
sustainable approaches. This review describes the correlation between the 
metabolic syndrome and aging, and the underlying common molecular mechanisms, 
focusing on calcium signaling and its crosstalks.

BACKGROUND: No systematic comparison has been conducted in Fiji using all 
suitable surveys of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity prevalence after 
standardizing methodology and definitions.
METHODS: Unit records from six surveys of Fiji adults were variously adjusted 
for age, ethnicity (Fiji Melanesians, i-Taukei, and Fijians of Asian Indian 
descent [Indians]) and urban-rural by sex to previous censuses. Trends were 
assessed using meta-regression (random effect models) and estimates projected to 
2020. Poisson regression of strata was used to assess the effect of body mass 
index (BMI) increases on T2DM period trends.
RESULTS: Over 1980-2011, T2DM prevalence increased in i-Taukei men (3.2% to 
11.1%; 1.32%/5 years) and women (5.3% to 13.6%; 1.40%/5 years) and Indian men 
(11.1% to 17.9%; 1.24%/5 years) and women (11.2% to 19.9%; 1.71%/5 years). 
Projected T2DM prevalence in 2020 is 13.3% and 16.7% in i-Taukei men and women, 
and 23.4% and 24.1% in Indian men and women, respectively. Obesity prevalence 
increased in i-Taukei men (12.6% to 28.9%; 2.99%/5 years) and women (30.1% to 
52.9%; 3.84%/5 years) and in Indian men (2.8% to 9.4%; 1.21%/5 years) and women 
(13.2% to 26.6%; 2.61%/5 years). Projected obesity prevalence in 2020 is 34.0% 
and 60.0% in i-Taukei and women, and 11.4% and 31.0% in Indian men and women, 
respectively. After age-adjustment, an estimated 27%, 25%, 16% and 18% of the 
T2DM period trend is attributable to BMI in i-Taukei men and women and Indian 
men and women, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of T2DM in Fiji is projected to continue increasing, 
driven by rising obesity, with consequences for premature mortality and life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: There is much controversy surrounding the natural history of 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.
AIMS: The aim of this review was to review the natural history of HCV infection.
METHODS: Published English literature was searched via pubmed and then reviewed.
RESULTS: Approximately, 75-85% of HCV-infected persons will progress to chronic 
HCV infection. The rate of chronic HCV infection is affected by a person's age, 
gender, race, and viral immune response. Once chronic HCV infection develops, 
there are external and host factors that can increase the risk of progression of 
liver disease. Progression of chronic HCV infection is not linear in time, 
probably because many cofactors change the rate of development of fibrosis, 
cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Factors linked with aggressive disease 
progression include age at infection, duration of infection, heavy alcohol use, 
co-infections with HIV or hepatitis B virus, male sex, steatosis, insulin 
resistance (and factors associated with the metabolic syndrome), and host 
genetics. However, the relative importance of many and varied factors remains 
uncertain, and further research efforts should be directed toward design of 
predictive models for effective risk stratification. Interferon-based therapy, 
particularly among those achieving a sustained virologic response (SVR), is 
associated with improved fibrosis and inflammation scores, reduced incidence of 
hepatocellular carcinoma, and prolonged life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the progress in understanding the factors affecting the 
natural history of HCV infection, a great deal remains to be learnt.

Investment in current versus future reproduction represents a prominent 
trade-off in life-history theory and is likely dependent on an individual's life 
expectancy. The terminal investment hypothesis posits that a reduction in 
residual reproductive value (i.e. potential for future offspring) will result in 
increased investment in current reproduction. We tested the hypothesis that male 
decorated crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus), when cued to their impending 
mortality, should increase their reproductive effort by altering the composition 
of their nuptial food gifts (i.e. spermatophylaxes) to increase their gustatory 
appeal to females. Using a repeated-measures design, we analysed the amino acid 
composition of spermatophylaxes derived from males both before and after 
injection of either a saline control or a solution of heat-killed bacteria. The 
latter, although nonpathogenic, represents an immune challenge that may signal 
an impending survival threat. One principal component explaining amino acid 
variation in spermatophylaxes, characterized by a high loading to histidine, was 
significantly lower in immune-challenged versus control males. The relevance of 
this difference for the gustatory appeal of gifts to females was assessed by 
mapping spermatophylax composition onto a fitness surface derived in an earlier 
study identifying the amino acid composition of spermatophylaxes preferred by 
females. We found that immune-challenged males maintained the level of 
attractiveness of their gifts post-treatment, whereas control males produced 
significantly less attractive gifts post-injection. These results are consistent 
with the hypothesis that cues of a survival-threatening infection stimulate 
terminal investment in male decorated crickets with respect to the gustatory 
appeal of their nuptial food gifts.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Egypt is the 
highest in the world, yet the total economic burden has not been quantified. 
Improved understanding of costs and the impact of treatment strategies will 
provide for better allocation of resources to reduce HCV disease and economic 
burden.
AIM: A modelling approach was used to quantify the current HCV-infected 
population, future disease progression and associated costs in Egypt.
METHODS: Direct healthcare costs were calculated from a nationally 
representative hospital and a disability adjusted life year (DALY) template was 
used with monetary value assigned to lost life years. Three scenarios were 
considered: (i) Historical treatment scenario: 50% SVR; 65,000 treated annually, 
(ii) Current treatment scenario: 90% sustained virologic response (SVR); 65,000 
treated annually, (iii) Increased treatment scenario: 90% SVR; 325,000 treated 
annually by 2018.
RESULTS: Cumulative DALYs (2015-2030) under Scenario 1 were estimated at 7.88 
million and cumulative costs estimated at $89.07 billion. Annual DALYs increased 
16% during 2015-2030 while annual costs more than doubled. Scenario 2 reduced 
cumulative DALYs and costs by 7% and 4%, respectively. Under Scenario 3, total 
costs declined 73% to $1047 million during 2015-2030. As compared to Scenario 1, 
cumulative DALYs and costs decreased 37% and 35%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first estimate of the total economic burden of HCV in 
Egypt. Extraordinary measures are necessary to substantially reduce HCV disease 
and cost burden. With newer therapies, strategies to reduce disease burden are 
feasible and cost-effective.
