Focused compound libraries are well-established tools for hit identification in 
drug discovery and chemical probe development. We present the compilation and 
application of a focused screening library of fatty acid mimetics (FAMs), which 
are compounds designed to bind the orthosteric site of proteins that 
endogenously accommodate natural fatty acids and lipid metabolites. This set 
complies with chemical properties of FAM and was found suitable for use also in 
cellular setting. Several hits were retrieved in screening the focused library 
against diverse fatty acid binding targets including the enzymes soluble epoxide 
hydrolase (sEH) and leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H), the nuclear receptors 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and retinoid X receptor α 
(RXRα), the carrier proteins fatty acid binding protein 4 and 5 (FABP4 and 
FABP5), as well as the G-protein coupled receptors leukotriene B4 receptor 1 
(BLT1) and free-fatty acid receptor 1 (FFAR1). Thus, the focused FAM library is 
suitable to obtain chemical starting matter for fatty acid binding proteins and 
provides a valuable extension to available screening collections.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer (OC) is a major cause of cancer-related deaths among 
women. The aim of this study was to estimate and report data on the current 
burden of ovarian cancer worldwide over the past 30 years.
METHOD: Based on the data provided by GBD 2019, we collected and interpreted the 
disease data of ovarian cancer by incidence, mortality, disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs), and used corresponding age-standardized rates as indicators. 
Also, we categorized the data by attributed risk factors and captured deaths due 
to high fasting plasma glucose, occupational exposure to asbestos and high 
body-mass index, respectively. All outcomes in the study were reported using 
mean values and corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UI).
RESULTS: Globally, there were 294422 (260649 to 329727) incident cases in 2019, 
and the number of deaths and DALYs were 198412 (175357 to 217665) and 5.36 
million (4.69 to 5.95). The overall burden was on the rise, with a percentage 
change of 107.8% (76.1 to 135.7%) for new cases, 103.8% (75.7 to 126.4%) for 
deaths and 96.1% (65.0 to 120.5%) for DALYs. Whereas the age-standardized rates 
kept stable during 1990-2019. The burden of ovarian cancer increased with age. 
and showed a totally different trends among SDI regions. Although high SDI 
region had the declining rates, the burden of ovarian cancer remained stable in 
high-middle and low SDI regions, and the middle and low-middle SDI areas showed 
increasing trends. High fasting plasma glucose was estimated to be the most 
important attributable risk factor for ovarian cancer deaths globally, with a 
percentage change of deaths of 7.9% (1.6 to 18.3%), followed by occupational 
exposure to asbestos and high body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the age-standardized rates of ovarian cancer didn't 
significantly change at the global level, the burden still increased, especially 
in areas on the lower end of the SDI range. Also, the disease burden due to 
different attributable risk factors showed heterogeneous, and it became more 
severe with age.

BACKGROUND: The disease burden of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) has become a 
significant public health threat. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive analysis 
to mitigate the health hazards of NMSC.
METHODS: This study had three objectives. First, we reported the NMSC-related 
disease burden globally and for different subgroups (sex, socio-demographic 
index (SDI), etiology, and countries) in 2019. Second, we examined the temporal 
trend of the disease burden from 1990 to 2019. Finally, we used the Bayesian 
age-period-cohort (BAPC) model integrated nested Laplacian approximation to 
predict the disease burden in the coming 25 years. The Norpred age-period-cohort 
(APC) model and the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model were 
used for sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The disease burden was significantly higher in males than in females in 
2019. The results showed significant differences in disease burden in different 
SDI regions. The better the socio-economic development, the heavier the disease 
burden of NMSC. The number of new cases and the ASIR of basal cell carcinoma 
(BCC) were higher than that of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in 2019 globally. 
However, the number of DALYs and the age-standardized DALYs rate were the 
opposite. There were statistically significant differences among different 
countries. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of NMSC increased from 
54.08/100,000 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 46.97, 62.08) in 1990 to 
79.10/100,000 (95% UI: 72.29, 86.63) in 2019, with an estimated annual 
percentage change (EAPC) of 1.78. Other indicators (the number of new cases, the 
number of deaths, the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), the 
age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and the age-standardized DALYs rate) 
showed the same trend. Our predictions suggested that the number of new cases, 
deaths, and DALYs attributable to NMSC would increase by at least 1.5 times from 
2020 to 2044.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden attributable to NMSC will continue to increase 
or remain stable at high levels. Therefore, relevant policies should be 
developed to manage NMSC, and measures should be taken to target risk factors 
and high-risk groups.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe root causes of health disparities by reviewing 
studies on incidence and outcomes of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) related 
to ethnic, race, gender, or socioeconomic differences and to propose solutions.
RECENT FINDINGS: SLE outcomes have steadily improved over the past 40 years but 
are not uniformly distributed across various racial and ethnic groups. Belonging 
to racial and ethnic minority has been cited as a risk factor for more severe 
disease and poor outcome in SLE. Population-based registries have demonstrated 
that Black patients with SLE have significantly lower life expectancy compared 
to White patients. Lower socioeconomic status has been shown to be one of the 
strongest predictors of progression to end stage renal disease in lupus 
nephritis. An association between patient experiences of racial discrimination, 
increased SLE activity, and damage has also been described. The lack of 
representation of marginalized communities in lupus clinical trials further 
perpetuates these disparities. To that end, the goal of a rheumatology workforce 
that resembles the patients it treats has emerged as one of many solutions to 
current shortfalls in care. Disparities in SLE incidence, treatment, and 
outcomes have now been well established. The root causes of these disparities 
are multifactorial including genetic, epigenetic, and socioeconomic. The 
underrepresentation of marginalized communities in lupus clinical trials further 
worsen these disparities. Efforts have been made recently to address disparities 
in a more comprehensive manner, but systemic causes of disparities must be 
acknowledged and political will is required for a sustained positive change.

PURPOSE: To support shared decision-making, patient-facing resources are needed 
to complement recently published guidelines on approaches for surveillance 
mammography in breast cancer survivors aged ≥ 75 or with < 10-year life 
expectancy. We created a patient guide to facilitate discussions about 
surveillance mammography in older breast cancer survivors.
METHODS: The "Are Mammograms Still Right for Me?" guide estimates future 
ipsilateral and contralateral breast (in-breast) cancer risks, general health, 
and the potential benefits/harms of mammography, with prompts for discussion. We 
conducted in-clinic acceptability testing of the guide by survivors and their 
clinicians at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer 
center, including two community practices. Patients and clinicians received the 
guide ahead of a clinic visit and surveyed patients (pre-/post-visit) and 
clinicians (post-visit). Acceptability was defined as ≥ 75% of patients and 
clinicians reporting that the guide (a) should be recommended to others, (b) is 
clear, (c) is helpful, and (d) contains a suitable amount of information. We 
also elicited feedback on usability and mammography intentions.
RESULTS: We enrolled 45 patients and their 21 clinicians. Among those responding 
in post-visit surveys, 33/37 (89%) patients and 15/16 (94%) clinicians would 
recommend the guide to others; 33/37 (89%) patients and 15/16 (94%) clinicians 
felt everything/most things were clear. All other pre-specified acceptability 
criteria were met. Most patients reported strong intentions for mammography 
(100% pre-visit, 98% post-visit).
CONCLUSION: Oncology clinicians and older breast cancer survivors found a guide 
to inform mammography decision-making acceptable and clear. A multisite clinical 
trial is needed to assess the guide's impact mammography utilization.

BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR/ATTRv) results from the 
deposition of misfolded transthyretin (TTR) throughout the body, including 
peripheral nerves. Inotersen, an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of hepatic 
TTR production, demonstrated a favorable efficacy and safety profile in patients 
with the polyneuropathy associated with hATTR in the NEURO-TTR (NCT01737398) 
study. We report longer-term efficacy and safety data for inotersen, with a 
median treatment exposure of 3 years.
METHODS: Patients who satisfactorily completed NEURO-TTR were enrolled in its 
open-label extension (OLE) study. Efficacy assessments included the modified 
Neuropathy Impairment Score + 7 (mNIS + 7), Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic 
Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) questionnaire total score, and the Short Form 36 
(SF-36v2) Health Survey Physical Component Summary score. Safety and 
tolerability were also assessed. Efficacy is reported for patients living in 
Europe and North America (this cohort completed the study approximately 9 months 
before the remaining group of patients outside these regions); safety is 
reported for the full safety dataset, comprising patients living in Europe, 
North America, and Latin America/Australasia. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02175004.
RESULTS: In the Europe and North America cohort of the NEURO-TTR study, 113/141 
patients (80.1%) completed the study, and 109 patients participated in the OLE 
study. A total of 70 patients continued to receive inotersen 
(inotersen-inotersen) and 39 switched from placebo to inotersen 
(placebo-inotersen). The placebo-inotersen group demonstrated sustained 
improvement in neurological disease progression as measured by mNIS + 7, 
compared with predicted worsening based on projection of the NEURO-TTR placebo 
data (estimated natural history). The inotersen-inotersen group demonstrated 
sustained benefit, as measured by mNIS + 7, Norfolk QoL-DN, and SF-36v2, 
compared with estimated natural history as well as compared with the 
placebo-inotersen group. With a maximum exposure of 6.2 years, inotersen was not 
associated with any additional safety concerns or increased toxicity in the OLE 
study. Platelet and renal monitoring were effective in reducing the risk of 
severe adverse events in the OLE study.
CONCLUSION: Inotersen treatment for > 3 years slowed progression of the 
polyneuropathy associated with hATTR, and no new safety signals were observed.

Green and facile synthesis of 24 tryptanthrin-thiopyrano[2,3-b]indole hybrid 
molecules is described (i) by a thermal one-pot multi-component strategy, (ii) 
using ammonium acetate in solvent-free conditions at 100 °C and (iii) by 
electrochemical method at room temperature. The in vitro antibacterial 
activities of compounds were evaluated against bacterial pathogen panel 
including clinically relevant highly drug-resistant MRSA/VRSA isolates, which 
led to the identification of nitro-substituted hybrid molecule 4c as being the 
most potent molecule against S. aureus ATCC 29213 with a high selectivity index. 
Upon further analysis, 4c exhibited concentration dependent bactericidal 
activity with a long PAE (post-antibiotic effect) and synergized with linezolid 
against S. aureus. From the in vitro metabolic stability assay (using rat liver 
microsomes) it was found that 4c has half-life of >120 min. The 
co-crystallographic studies indicated that amino group in compound 4c is the 
potential binding site. From all the studies, it was clear that compound 4c 
exhibits all the hallmarks for positioning it as a novel anti-staphylococcal 
therapeutic option.

BACKGROUND: VEGF inhibitors can enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, 
despite high initial response rates, almost all patients eventually develop 
treatment resistance to EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. We aimed to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of sintilimab with or without IBI305 plus pemetrexed and 
cisplatin, compared with pemetrexed and cisplatin alone, for the treatment of 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) who had disease progression after receiving EGFR tyrosine-kinase 
inhibitor therapy.
METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 trial was conducted 
at 52 hospitals in China. Eligible participants were adults aged 18-75 years 
with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and EGFRmut who progressed after 
receiving a EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group performance status of 0 or 1 with at least one measurable lesion, and an 
estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months. Participants were randomly 
assigned (1:1:1) to receive sintilimab (200 mg) plus IBI305 (15 mg/kg) plus 
pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2), sintilimab plus pemetrexed and 
cisplatin, or pemetrexed and cisplatin (chemotherapy alone) using block 
randomisation with stratification according to sex and presence or absence of 
brain metastases. All study drugs were administered intravenously on day 1 of 
each cycle, once every 3 weeks. Except for cisplatin, which was only given in 
the first four cycles, treatment was given for 24 months or until disease 
progression, intolerable toxic effects, withdrawal of consent, death, or other 
protocol-specified conditions, whichever occurred first. The primary endpoint 
was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. We herein 
report the first planned interim analysis, with progression-free survival 
results for the comparison between sintilimab plus IBI305 plus chemotherapy 
versus chemotherapy alone. The progression-free survival results for the 
sintilimab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin group are immature and not reported 
here. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03802240 
(recruiting).
FINDINGS: Between July 11, 2019, and July 31, 2021, 936 patients were screened 
and 444 were randomly assigned (148 to the sintilimab plus IBI305 plus 
chemotherapy group, 145 to the sintilimab plus chemotherapy group, and 151 to 
the chemotherapy alone group). Data cutoff for this interim analysis was July 
31, 2021. After a median follow-up of 9·8 months (IQR 4·4-13·3), 
progression-free survival was significantly longer in the sintilimab plus IBI305 
plus chemotherapy group versus the chemotherapy alone group (median 6·9 months 
[95% CI 6·0-9.3] vs 4·3 months [4·1-5·4]; hazard ratio 0·46 [0·34-0·64]; 
p<0·0001). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were 
decreased neutrophil count (30 [20%] in the sintilimab plus IBI305 plus 
chemotherapy group vs 26 [18%] in the sintilimab plus chemotherapy group vs 27 
[18%] in the chemotherapy alone group), decreased white blood cell count (17 
[11%] vs 12 [8%] vs 13 [9%]), and anaemia (18 [12%] vs ten [7%] vs 15 [10%]). 
Potentially treatment-related deaths occurred in six patients (intestinal 
obstruction, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and myelosuppression in one patient 
each, and three deaths of unknown cause) in the sintilimab plus IBI305 plus 
chemotherapy group, and in one patient in the chemotherapy alone group (unknown 
cause).
INTERPRETATION: In this interim analysis, sintilimab plus IBI305 plus cisplatin 
and pemetrexed was generally efficacious and well tolerated in patients with 
EGFR-mutated NSCLC who progressed after receiving EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor 
therapy.

BACKGROUND: Substance use disorder (SUD) is a persistent problem within society 
and an issue of increasing community awareness and concern. SUD is often 
comorbid with significant mental health challenges, trauma and negative social 
determinants of health. SUDs contribute to increased burden of chronic disease 
and can lead to increased mortality and shorter life expectancy, not just 
through overdose but also through increased rates of mental and physical chronic 
disease.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to explore the evidence regarding 
lifestyle interventions as either primary interventions or adjuncts to existing 
treatments for individuals with SUD.
DISCUSSION: Lifestyle interventions can play a significant part in the 
management of people with SUD. These interventions play a part in SUD treatment 
and relapse prevention as well as improving physical and mental health and 
quality of life. These interventions ideally can be instituted and managed 
through community services and primary care.

Somatotropic Axis, Pace of Life and Aging.

Medicine, Springfield, IL, United States.

Mice with genetic growth hormone (GH) deficiency or GH resistance live much 
longer than their normal siblings maintained under identical conditions with 
unlimited access to food. Extended longevity of these mutants is associated with 
extension of their healthspan (period of life free of disability and disease) 
and with delayed and/or slower aging. Importantly, GH and GH-related traits have 
been linked to the regulation of aging and longevity also in mice that have not 
been genetically altered and in other mammalian species including humans. 
Avai+lable evidence indicates that the impact of suppressed GH signaling on 
aging is mediated by multiple interacting mechanisms and involves trade-offs 
among growth, reproduction, and longevity. Life history traits of long-lived 
GH-related mutants include slow postnatal growth, delayed sexual maturation, and 
reduced fecundity (smaller litter size and increased intervals between the 
litters). These traits are consistent with a slower pace-of-life, a 
well-documented characteristic of species of wild animals that are long-lived in 
their natural environment. Apparently, slower pace-of-life (or at least some of 
its features) is associated with extended longevity both within and between 
species. This association is unexpected and may appear counterintuitive, because 
the relationships between adult body size (a GH-dependent trait) and longevity 
within and between species are opposite rather than similar. Studies of energy 
metabolism and nutrient-dependent signaling pathways at different stages of the 
life course will be needed to elucidate mechanisms of these relationships.

Women with cystic fibrosis (CF) have a significantly lower life expectancy 
compared to men, which is indicated by an earlier impairment of lung function 
due to chronic colonization with biofilm formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There 
is growing evidence that blood serum concentrations of the steroid sex hormone 
estradiol (E2) correlate with the occurrence of pulmonary exacerbations in CF 
but also play a role in the mucoid switch of P. aeruginosa. This study aims to 
shed light on possible microbiological reasons for sexual dimorphism in CF by 
investigating the influence of E2 on biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa CF 
isolates. For this purpose, 10 CF isolates of the respiratory tract derived from 
different CF patients have been treated with E2 in a microtiter plate biofilm 
model. Biofilms have been examined by crystal violet assays, field emission 
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), 3D laser scanning microscopy (LSM), and 
quorum sensing (QS) reporter assays of the supernatants taken from biofilms. 
This allowed us to simultaneously investigate the effects of E2 on attached 
biofilm mass, biofilm ultrastructure, and QS activity. Upon E2 treatment, six 
out of 10 investigated CF isolates showed an increase of attached biofilm mass, 
whereas biofilms from two tested non-CF laboratory strains (PAO1 and ATCC19660) 
did not. Moreover, FE-SEM and 3D LSM analyses of the E2 responsive CF biofilms 
revealed ultrastructural remodeling of biofilm structure at different scales 
with increased formation of prominent biofilm spots, enhanced coverage with 
extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), and extended average surface roughness. 
QS activity measurements performed in biofilm supernatants via luminescence acyl 
homoserine lactone (AHL) reporter assays further showed that E2 treatment may 
also modulate QS signaling, as shown in an E2 sensitive CF isolate. Together, 
our results suggest the biofilm modulating effects of E2 on various clinical CF 
isolates that are documented by both biomass and ultrastructural changes of 
biofilms. The gained new insight into the influence of steroid hormones on 
P. aeruginosa biofilm phenotypes might pave the way for novel future approaches 
in personalized medicine based on the patients' sex and hormonal status.

Improving healthy life expectancy by targeting aging-related pathological 
changes has been the spotlight of geroscience. Scorpions have been used in 
traditional medicine in Asia and Africa for a long time. We have isolated 
heat-resistant peptides from scorpion venom of Buthusmartensii Karsch (SVHRP) 
and found that SVHRP can attenuate microglia activation and protect 
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) against β-amyloid toxicity. Based on the 
amino acid sequence of these peptides, scorpion venom heat-resistant synthesized 
peptide (SVHRSP) was prepared using polypeptide synthesis technology. In the 
present study, we used C. elegans as a model organism to assess the 
longevity-related effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of SVHRSP in vivo. 
The results showed that SVHRSP could prolong the lifespan of worms and 
significantly improve the age-related physiological functions of worms. SVHRSP 
increases the survival rate of larvae under oxidative and heat stress and 
decreases the level of reactive oxygen species and fat accumulation in vivo. 
Using gene-specific mutation of C. elegans, we found that SVHRSP-mediated 
prolongation of life depends on Daf-2, Daf-16, Skn-1, and Hsf-1 genes. These 
results indicate that the antiaging mechanism of SVHRSP in nematodes might be 
mediated by the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway. 
Meanwhile, SVHRSP could also up-regulate the expression of stress-inducing genes 
Hsp-16.2, Sod-3, Gei-7, and Ctl-1 associated with aging. In general, our study 
may have important implications for SVHRSP to promote healthy aging and provide 
strategies for research and development of drugs to treat age-related diseases.

BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are an important component of the 
tumor. This study aimed to investigate the burden of six major GI cancers in 
China and globally from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study based on the Global Burden of 
Disease Study (GBD) 2019. Indicators on incidence, deaths, disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs), and risk factors for esophageal, stomach, liver, pancreatic, 
colon and rectum, and gallbladder and biliary tract cancers were collected and 
analyzed for time trends. The contribution of each cancer and the proportion of 
cases in China among global cases were further reported.
RESULTS: Global incidence cases, death cases, and DALYs of GI cancers showed an 
overall ascending trend over the past 30 years, but there was temporal and 
geographical variation across cancer types. By 2019, colon and rectum cancer had 
overtaken stomach cancer as the most burdensome GI cancer globally. However, 
stomach cancer narrowly continued to be the most burdensome GI in China. In 
addition, the proportion of incidence and death cases of stomach, pancreatic, 
colon and rectum, and gallbladder and biliary tract cancers among global cases 
had further increased. It was noteworthy that the burden of liver cancer in 
China has been alleviated significantly.
CONCLUSION: GI cancers remain a major public health problem in China and 
globally. Despite the temporal and geographic diversity of different cancers, 
targeted primary and secondary prevention are still necessary for the future to 
face these unknown challenges.

BACKGROUND: Surgical procedures impose hemostatic risk to people with 
hemophilia, which may be minimized by optimal factor (F) replacement therapy.
METHODS: This analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of extended half-life 
factor replacement recombinant FVIII and FIX Fc fusion proteins (rFVIIIFc and 
rFIXFc) during surgery in phase 3 pivotal (A-LONG/Kids A-LONG and B-LONG/Kids 
B-LONG) and extension (ASPIRE and B-YOND) studies. Dosing regimens were 
determined by investigators. Injection frequency, dosing, blood loss, 
transfusions, and hemostatic response were assessed.
RESULTS: Forty-five major (n = 31 subjects) and 90 minor (n = 70 subjects) 
procedures were performed in hemophilia A; 35 major (n = 22) and 62 minor 
(n = 37) procedures were performed in hemophilia B. Unilateral knee arthroplasty 
was the most common major orthopedic procedure (hemophilia A: n = 15/34; 
hemophilia B: n = 8/24). On the day of surgery, median total dose in 
adults/adolescents was 81 IU/kg for rFVIIIFc and 144 IU/kg for rFIXFc; most 
major procedures required ≤2 injections (including loading dose). Through days 
1-14, most major procedures had ≤1 injection/day. Hemostasis was rated excellent 
(rFVIIIFc: n = 39/42; rFIXFc: n = 29/33) or good (n = 3/42; n = 4/33) in 
evaluable major surgeries, with blood loss comparable with subjects without 
hemophilia. Most minor procedures in adults/adolescents required one injection 
on the day of surgery, including median loading dose of 51 IU/kg (rFVIIIFc) and 
80 IU/kg (rFIXFc). No major treatment-related safety concerns were identified. 
No subjects developed inhibitors or serious vascular thromboembolic events.
CONCLUSIONS: rFVIIIFc and rFIXFc were efficacious and well tolerated for the 
management of perioperative hemostasis across a wide spectrum of major and minor 
surgeries in hemophilia.

Forecast of Population Size and Demographic Burden in Russia up to 2100.

Yumaguzin VV(1), Vinnik MV(1).

Author information:
(1)HSE University, Moscow, Russia.

The article presents basic approaches to substantiating the hypotheses of 
fertility, mortality, and migration in Russia in the long term. The main results 
of the multivariate demographic development of Russia until 2100, which combines 
30 different combinations of demographic processes, are analyzed. It is shown 
that the population will decline under most scenarios, including the most 
probable medium scenario - up to 137.5 million people by the end of the century. 
In the short term until the early 2030s, all options show an increase in the 
demographic load, and in the longer term it alternatively decreases and 
increases with different intensity time and again. The most favorable scenarios 
with high fertility and life expectancy and low migration growth put the 
greatest pressure on the working-age population due to the higher number of 
births and the elderly in these scenarios.

The article examines the current demographic trends in Russia as compared to 
population changes in the world and its major regions based on data from the 
Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), Eurostat, and the UN 
Population Division. It is shown that in terms of a number of characteristics of 
population reproduction-low fertility, ageing population structure, natural 
population decline-Russia is quite similar to the developed countries group. 
However, Russia is behind many countries in reducing the mortality rate of the 
middle-aged and older population, especially in men, and, correspondingly, in 
life expectancy for all age groups, which results in a noticeable increase in 
natural population decline and in deformation of the sex structure of the 
population. The specifics of the age structure of the Russian population that 
have been formed by a number of demographic waves are such that changes in the 
number of births and in age group sizes come in waves; this trend will continue 
in the coming decades. The article also analyzes excess mortality in Russia 
during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison with similar data for the European 
Union (EU-27) and compares healthy life expectancy estimates for Russia, the 
entire world, individual countries, and different groups of countries by income.

This case report presents the failure of retrograde intramedullary (IM) nailing 
in a supracondylar distal femur fracture in a 72-year-old female after a fall 
from standing. Multiple medical comorbidities are a known risk factor for 
fracture nonunion. With the rising incidence of patients having osteoporosis and 
multiple medical comorbidities, orthopedic surgeons need to be prepared for the 
treatment of hardware complications. The patient is a 72-year-old severely obese 
female with multiple medical comorbidities including cardiac valvular disease, 
hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, acute on chronic blood 
loss anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus arthritis. She presented after a 
fall from standing where she sustained a closed displaced left supracondylar 
distal femur fracture with intercondylar extension. Open reduction and internal 
fixation (ORIF) was performed on the left distal femur intercondylar split and 
retrograde intramedullary nailing for the left supracondylar distal femur 
fracture. Three-month follow-up X-rays revealed no osseous formation of the 
supracondylar distal femur fracture and catastrophic failure of the implants 
with two broken screws and a broken condylar bolt consistent with hardware 
failure. Treatment options included either non-weight-bearing for three months 
to evaluate for callus formation, which would require her to be in a wheelchair,
