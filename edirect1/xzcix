(adjusted to 2017 inflation rate). Similarly, the use of telemonitoring and 
telephone reminders was cost-effective in diabetes management.
CONCLUSIONS: Among all telemedicine strategies examined, teleophthalmology was 
the most cost-effective intervention. Future research is needed to provide 
evidence on the long-term experience of telemedicine and facilitate resource 
allocation.

Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) play an essential role in the 
regulation of pollen tube growth. Although CPK genes have been identified in 
maize, and some have been functionally characterized, the molecular function of 
ZmCPKs associated with pollen tube development remains less well studied. Here, 
we report that a pollen-specific CPK, ZmCPK32, is involved in the regulation of 
pollen germination and tube extension. ZmCPK32 exhibited CPK activity and was 
localized on the plasma membrane and punctate internal membrane compartments via 
N-terminal acylation. In situ hybridization and real-time PCR revealed that 
ZmCPK32 transcripts accumulated in pollen and expression was dramatically 
upregulated during shedding. To elucidate the function of this gene, we 
transiently expressed a ZmCPK32-GFP fusion protein in tobacco pollen using 
microparticle bombardment. ZmCPK32 accumulation inhibited pollen germination and 
reduced pollen tube growth, but this effect was abolished when the 
kinase-inactive variant was expressed, indicating that kinase activity is 
critical for its regulatory function. In addition, the plasma membrane 
localization of ZmCPK32 is essential for regulating polar growth, as pollen 
expressing the cytosol-localized kinase displayed reduced tube length but 
germinated well. Moreover, the constitutively active form of ZmCPK32 enhanced 
the reduction in the germination rate, indicating that the specific activation 
of ZmCPK32 via calcium ions at the cortical growth point is essential for 
regulating appropriate germination. The results suggest that ZmCPK32 is 
functionally associated with pollen tube growth, and could represent a potential 
target for breeding male-sterile maize.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES:  Life expectancy for people with spinal cord 
injury/disease (SCI/D) is increasing, due to modern advances in treatment 
methods and in neuro-urology. However, with the increased life expectancy the 
risk of developing urinary bladder cancer is gaining importance. How is this 
patient group different from the general population?
METHODS:  Single-centre retrospective evaluation of consecutive patient data 
with spinal cord injury and proven urinary bladder cancer.
RESULTS:  Between January 1st 1998 and March 31st 2017, 32 (3 female, 29 male) 
out of a total of 6432 patients with SCI/D were diagnosed with bladder 
cancer.The average age at bladder cancer diagnosis was 54.5 years, which is well 
below the average for bladder cancer cases in the general population (male: 74, 
female: 75).Twenty-seven patients suffered from urodynamically confirmed 
neurogenic detrusor overactivity, while five patients (all male) had detrusor 
acontractility.The median latency period between the onset of SCI/D and tumor 
diagnosis was 29.5 years. Temporary indwelling catheterisation was found in four 
patients for only 1.61 % of the overall latency period of all patients.The 
majority of the patients (n = 27) had transitional cell carcinoma, while five 
had squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 32 patients, 25 (78 %) had muscle invasive 
bladder cancer at ≥ T2 at the time of diagnosis. Regarding tumour grading, 23 
out of 32 patients showed a histologically poorly differentiated G3 carcinoma; 
two patients each had G2 and G1 tumours repectively (no information on tumour 
grading was available in five patients).The median survival for all patients was 
11.5 months. The prognosis of patients with squamous cell carcinoma was even 
worse; 4 out of 5 died within 7 months (median 4 months).
CONCLUSIONS:  The significantly younger age at onset and the frequency of 
invasive, poorly differentiated tumour at diagnosis indicate that SCI/D 
influences both bladder cancer risk and prognosis significantly. The latency 
period between paralysis and tumour disease seems to be a decisive risk 
parameter.The type of neurogenic bladder dysfunction and the form of bladder 
drainage do not appear to influence the risk. Long-term indwelling catheter 
drainage played only a minor role in the investigated patients.Early detection 
of bladder cancer in patients with spinal cord injury remains a challenge.

Publisher: FRAGESTELLUNG:  Die Lebenserwartung für Menschen mit 
Querschnittlähmung (spinal cord injury/disease; SCI/D) steigt infolge der 
Fortschritte der paraplegiologischen und neuro-urologischen Behandlungsmethoden. 
Somit gewinnt jedoch das Risiko, an Harnblasenkrebs zu erkranken, an Bedeutung.
METHODIK:  Retrospektive Single-Center-Auswertung von konsekutiven 
Patientendaten mit SCI/D und nachgewiesenem Harnblasenkarzinom.
ERGEBNIS:  Vom 1. Januar 1998 bis 31. März 2017 wurde bei 32 (3 weiblich, 29 
männlich) von insgesamt 6 432 Patienten mit SCI/D ein Harnblasen-Karzinom 
diagnostiziert. Das Durchschnittsalter bei der Blasenkrebsdiagnose lag mit 54,5 
Jahren deutlich unter dem für Blasenkrebsfälle in der Allgemeinbevölkerung 
(männlich: 74, weiblich: 75 Jahre). 27 Patienten litten an einer urodynamisch 
bestätigten neurogenen Detrusor-Überaktivität, während 5 Patienten (alle 
männlich) eine neurogene Akontraktilität des Detrusors aufwiesen.Die mediane 
Latenzzeit zwischen dem Einsetzen der SCI/D und der Tumordiagnose betrug 29,5 
Jahre. Temporäre Dauerkatheterisierungen wurden bei lediglich 4 Patienten für 
insgesamt nur 1,61 % der Latenzzeit aller Patienten gefunden.Die Mehrzahl der 
Patienten (n = 27) wies ein Urothelzellkarzinom auf, 5 Patienten hatten ein 
Plattenepithelkarzinom. 25 Patienten (78 %) hatten zum Zeitpunkt der Diagnose 
bereits einen muskelinvasiven Tumor ≥ T2. 23 Patienten zeigten ein histologisch 
schlecht differenziertes G3-Karzinom, zwei Patienten hatten jeweils einen G2- 
und G1-Tumor (keine Angaben bei 5 Patienten).Das mediane Überleben für alle 
Patienten betrug 11,5 Monate. Die Prognose der Patienten mit 
Plattenepithelkarzinom war signifikant noch schlechter, 4 von 5 starben 
innerhalb von 7 Monaten (Median 4 Monate).
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG:  Das jüngere Alter bei Beginn der Tumorerkrankung und die 
Häufigkeit invasiver, schlecht differenzierter Tumoren bei der Diagnose weisen 
darauf hin, dass das Vorliegen einer SCI/D sowohl Risiko als auch Prognose der 
Blasentumor-Erkrankung signifikant beeinflussen. Die Latenzzeit zwischen 
Lähmungseintritt und Tumorerkrankung scheint ein maßgeblicher Risiko-Parameter 
zu sein.Die Art der neurogenen Blasenfunktionsstörung und des Blasen-Managements 
scheinen dagegen das Risiko nicht zu beeinflussen. Langzeit-Dauerableitungen der 
Harnblase spielten bei den untersuchten Patienten nur eine untergeordnete 
Rolle.Die Früherkennung von Blasenkrebs bei Patienten mit SCI/D bleibt eine 
Herausforderung.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become a leading cause of death 
among young people worldwide. Survivors may live with a long-term TBI-related 
disability or even develop a disorder of consciousness resulting in poor life 
quality and shortened life expectancy. Thus far, very few approaches have been 
found to be effective in the consciousness recovery of these patients. 
Acupuncture has long been used in the treatment of neurological disorders in 
China. However, its efficacy and safety in consciousness recovery remain to be 
proved.
METHODS: Here, we present a study design and protocol of a randomized, blinded, 
controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electro-acupuncture in 
the consciousness recovery of patients with TBI. A total of 150 patients with 
initial Glasgow coma scale score of less than 8 points will be recruited in the 
trial and randomized into acupuncture or control groups. Patients in the control 
group will receive routine pharmacological treatment alone while patients in the 
acupuncture group will receive electro-acupuncture treatment for 10 days in 
addition to routine treatment. The efficacy will be assessed with the changes in 
Glasgow coma scale score and mismatch negativity of event-related brain 
potentials before and after treatment. Moreover, Glasgow outcome scale and 
Barthel index of activities of daily living will be compared between the two 
groups at 3 months after treatment. The secondary outcome measures are the 
length of stay in ICU and hospital, expenses in ICU and hospital, as well as the 
incidence of coma-related complications. The safety of electro-acupuncture will 
be assessed by monitoring the incidence of adverse events and changes in vital 
signs during the study.
DISCUSSION: Results from this trial will significantly add to the current body 
of evidence on the role of electro-acupuncture in the consciousness recovery of 
patients with severe TBI. In addition, a more convenient and consistent 
electro-acupuncture method can be set up for clinical practice. If found to be 
effective and safe, electro-acupuncture will be a valuable complementary option 
for comatose patients with TBI.

BACKGROUND: To estimate the short-term cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir 
(IDet) versus neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin based on the incidence of 
non-severe hypoglycemia and changes in body weight in subjects with type 1 
diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the UK.
METHODS: A model was developed to evaluate cost-effectiveness based on 
non-severe hypoglycemia, body mass index, and pharmacy costs over 1 year. 
Published rates of non-severe hypoglycemia were employed in the T1D and T2D 
analyses, while reduced weight gain with IDet was modeled in the T2D analysis 
only. Effectiveness was calculated in terms of quality-adjusted life expectancy 
using published utility scores. Pharmacy costs were captured using published 
prices and defined daily doses. Costs were expressed in 2016 pounds sterling 
(GBP). Sensitivity analyses were performed (including probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis).
RESULTS: In T1D, IDet was associated with fewer non-severe hypoglycemic events 
than NPH insulin (126.7 versus 150.8 events per person-year), leading to an 
improvement of 0.099 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs with IDet were 
GBP 60 higher, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of GBP 
610 per QALY gained. In T2D, mean non-severe hypoglycemic event rates and body 
weight were lower with IDet than NPH insulin, leading to a total incremental 
utility of 0.120, accompanied by an annual cost increase of GBP 171, yielding an 
ICER of GBP 1,422 per QALY gained for IDet versus NPH insulin.
CONCLUSION: Short-term health economic evaluation showed IDet to be a 
cost-effective alternative to NPH insulin in the UK due to lower rates of 
non-severe hypoglycemia (T1D and T2D) and reduced weight gain (T2D only).

BACKGROUND: Malignant gastric outlet obstruction is the clinical and 
pathological consequence of cancerous disease causing a mechanical obstruction 
to gastric emptying. It usually occurs when malignancy is at an advanced stage; 
therefore, people have a limited life expectancy. It is of paramount importance 
to restore oral intake to improve quality of life for the person in a manner 
that has a minimal risk of complications and a short recovery period.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of endoscopic stent placement 
versus surgical palliation for people with symptomatic malignant gastric outlet 
obstruction.
SEARCH METHODS: In May 2018 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and Ovid CINAHL. We screened 
reference lists from included studies and review articles.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials comparing stent 
placement with surgical palliation for people with gastric outlet obstruction 
secondary to malignant disease.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted study 
data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 
binary outcomes, mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 
95% CI for continuous outcomes and the hazard ratio (HR) for time-to-event 
outcomes. We performed meta-analyses where meaningful. We assessed the quality 
of evidence using GRADE criteria.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified three randomised controlled trials with 84 
participants. Forty-one participants underwent surgical palliation and 43 
participants underwent duodenal stent placement. There may have been little or 
no difference in the technical success of the procedure (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 
1.09; low-quality evidence), or whether the time to resumption of oral intake 
was quicker for participants who had undergone duodenal stent placement (MD 
-3.07 days, 95% CI -4.76 to -1.39; low-quality evidence).Due to very low-quality 
evidence, we were uncertain whether surgical palliation improved all-cause 
mortality and median survival postintervention.The time to recurrence of 
obstructive symptoms may have increased slightly following duodenal stenting (RR 
5.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 26.74; moderate-quality evidence).Due to very low-quality 
evidence, we were uncertain whether surgical palliation improved serious and 
minor adverse events. The heterogeneity for adverse events was moderately high 
(serious adverse events: Chi² = 1.71; minor adverse events: Chi² = 3.08), 
reflecting the differences in definitions used and therefore, may have impacted 
the outcomes. The need for reintervention may have increased following duodenal 
stenting (RR 4.71, 95% CI 1.36 to 16.30; very low-quality evidence).The length 
of hospital stay may have been shorter (by approximately 4 to 10 days) following 
stenting (MD -6.70 days, 95% CI -9.41 to -3.98; moderate-quality evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The use of duodenal stent placement in malignant gastric 
outlet obstruction has the benefits of a quicker resumption of oral intake and a 
reduced inpatient hospital stay; however, this is balanced by an increase in the 
recurrence of symptoms and the need for further intervention.It is impossible to 
draw further conclusions on these and the other measured outcomes, primarily due 
to the low number of eligible studies and small number of participants which 
resulted in low-quality evidence. It was not possible to analyse the impact on 
quality of life each intervention had for these participants.

From loss of life to loss of years: a different view on the burden of injury 
fatalities in Sweden 1972-2014.

BACKGROUND: Worldwide, about 5.8 million people die each year due to injuries. 
In Sweden, the corresponding number amounts to 3000. There are large differences 
among injury types regarding the age-profile of the fatalities and as most of 
them occur in older age groups, counting the absolute number of injury 
fatalities does not fully reflect the size of the burden of injury.
METHODS: Using age- and sex-specific life expectancy tables in combination with 
data on external causes of injury, the number of injury fatalities in Sweden for 
the time period 1972-2014 is converted to a sum of potential years of life lost 
(PYLL). We then fit cause and group-specific spline regression models to the 
data to estimate temporal trends in both fatality counts and PYLL.
RESULTS: There has been a steady reduction in the number of injury fatalities 
and in the sum of PYLL from the early 1970s to around the year 2000. Since then, 
there has been an increase in the number of injury fatalities and in the sum of 
PYLL. The upward trend is mainly explained by an increasing number of deaths due 
to poisonings and suicide, specifically among younger men.
CONCLUSIONS: The increases in suicide and poisoning mortality offset the 
reductions in downward trending causes of injury mortality during the last 
decades. The share of PYLL is larger than the share of fatalities for both 
suicides and poisonings implying that an aging population does not cause the 
increase.

Demographic parameters of the turnip aphid, Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach) 
(Hemiptera: Aphididae), which is a serious pest of Brassica crops worldwide, 
were evaluated on five major Brassica vegetables (three varieties of Brassica 
oleraceae (Linnaeus) (Brassicaceae: Brassicales); kohlrabi, cabbage and 
ornamental cabbage, and two subspecies of Brassica rapa (Linnaeus) 
(Brassicaceae: Brassicales); Chinese cabbage and bak choi). The study was 
carried out under laboratory conditions at 25 ± 1°C, 70 ± 5% RH and 16:8 (L:D) 
h. Preadult developmental time, survival rate, female longevity, reproduction, 
and life table parameters were evaluated according to the age-stage specific 
life table method. The highest population growth parameters, i.e., net 
reproductive rate (R0), intrinsic rate of increase (r), and finite rate of 
increase (λ) were recorded on kohlrabi (R0 = 30.45 offspring, r = 0.2174 d-1, λ 
= 1.2429 d-1). These parameters were the lowest on Chinese cabbage (R0 = 13.00 
offspring, r = 0.1503 d-1, and λ = 1.1621 d-1) and bak choi (R0 = 16.30 
offspring, r = 0.1614 d-1, λ = 1.1752 d-1). The results attained from population 
growth parameters, together with population projection estimation based on the 
age-stage, two-sex life table theory, indicated that both Chinese cabbage and 
bak choi were less suitable hosts for turnip aphids and should be considered as 
a possible source for developing resistance in breeding programs and integrated 
pest management strategies.

A huge diversity of modified nucleobases is used as a tool for studying DNA and 
RNA. Due to practical reasons, the most suitable positions for modifications are 
C5 of pyrimidines and C7 of purines. Unfortunately, by using these two positions 
only, one cannot expand a repertoire of modified nucleotides to a maximum. Here, 
we demonstrate the synthesis and enzymatic incorporation of novel N4-acylated 
2'-deoxycytidine nucleotides (dCAcyl). We find that a variety of family A and B 
DNA polymerases efficiently use dCAcylTPs as substrates. In addition to the 
formation of complementary CAcyl•G pair, a strong base-pairing between 
N4-acyl-cytosine and adenine takes place when Taq, Klenow fragment (exo-), Bsm 
and KOD XL DNA polymerases are used for the primer extension reactions. In 
contrast, a proofreading phi29 DNA polymerase successfully utilizes dCAcylTPs 
but is prone to form CAcyl•A base pair under the same conditions. Moreover, we 
show that terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase is able to incorporate as many 
as several hundred N4-acylated-deoxycytidine nucleotides. These data reveal 
novel N4-acylated deoxycytidine nucleotides as beneficial substrates for the 
enzymatic synthesis of modified DNA, which can be further applied for specific 
labelling of DNA fragments, selection of aptamers or photoimmobilization.

INTRODUCTION: This phase III, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial 
(and extension phase) was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 
velmanase alfa (VA) in alpha-mannosidosis (AM) patients.
METHODS: Twenty-five patients were randomised to weekly 1 mg/kg VA or placebo 
for 52 weeks. At study conclusion, placebo patients switched to VA; 23 patients 
continued receiving VA in compassionate-use/follow-on studies and were evaluated 
in the extension phase [last observation (LO)]. Co-primary endpoints were 
changes in serum oligosaccharide (S-oligo) and in the 3-min stair-climb test 
(3MSCT).
RESULTS: Mean relative change in S-oligo in the VA arm was -77.6% [95% 
confidence interval (CI) -81.6 to -72.8] at week 52 and -62.9% (95% CI -85.8 to 
-40.0) at LO; mean relative change in the placebo arm was -24.1% (95% CI -40.3 
to -3.6) at week 52 and -55.7% (95% CI -76.4 to -34.9) at LO after switch to 
active treatment. Mean relative change in 3MSCT at week 52 was -1.1% (95% CI 
-9.0 to 7.6) and - % (95% CI -13.4 to 6.5) for VA and placebo, respectively. At 
LO, the mean relative change was 3.9% (95% CI -5.5 to 13.2) in the VA arm and 
9.0% (95% CI -10.3 to 28.3) in placebo patients after switch to active 
treatment. Similar improvement pattern was observed in secondary parameters. A 
post hoc analysis investigated whether some factors at baseline could account 
for treatment outcome; none of those factors were predictive of the response to 
VA, besides age.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the utility of VA for the treatment of AM, 
with more evident benefit over time and when treatment is started in the 
paediatric age.

In the United States, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer 
diagnosed among adults and the second leading cause of death from cancer. For 
this guideline update, the American Cancer Society (ACS) used an existing 
systematic evidence review of the CRC screening literature and microsimulation 
modeling analyses, including a new evaluation of the age to begin screening by 
race and sex and additional modeling that incorporates changes in US CRC 
incidence. Screening with any one of multiple options is associated with a 
significant reduction in CRC incidence through the detection and removal of 
adenomatous polyps and other precancerous lesions and with a reduction in 
mortality through incidence reduction and early detection of CRC. Results from 
modeling analyses identified efficient and model-recommendable strategies that 
started screening at age 45 years. The ACS Guideline Development Group applied 
the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) 
criteria in developing and rating the recommendations. The ACS recommends that 
adults aged 45 years and older with an average risk of CRC undergo regular 
screening with either a high-sensitivity stool-based test or a structural 
(visual) examination, depending on patient preference and test availability. As 
a part of the screening process, all positive results on noncolonoscopy 
screening tests should be followed up with timely colonoscopy. The 
recommendation to begin screening at age 45 years is a qualified recommendation. 
The recommendation for regular screening in adults aged 50 years and older is a 
strong recommendation. The ACS recommends (qualified recommendations) that: 1) 
average-risk adults in good health with a life expectancy of more than 10 years 
continue CRC screening through the age of 75 years; 2) clinicians individualize 
CRC screening decisions for individuals aged 76 through 85 years based on 
patient preferences, life expectancy, health status, and prior screening 
history; and 3) clinicians discourage individuals older than 85 years from 
continuing CRC screening. The options for CRC screening are: fecal 
immunochemical test annually; high-sensitivity, guaiac-based fecal occult blood 
test annually; multitarget stool DNA test every 3 years; colonoscopy every 10 
years; computed tomography colonography every 5 years; and flexible 
sigmoidoscopy every 5 years. CA Cancer J Clin 2018;68:250-281. © 2018 American

Aging- and vascular-related pathologies.

Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Vic., Australia.

Our aging population is set to grow considerably in the coming decades. In fact, 
the number of individuals older than 65 years will double by 2050. This 
projected increase in people living with extended life expectancy represents an 
inevitable upsurge in the presentation of age-related pathologies. However, our 
current understanding of the impact of aging on a number of biological processes 
is unfortunately inadequate. Cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and 
neurodegenerative diseases are particularly prevalent in the elderly population. 
Intriguingly, these pathologies are all associated with vascular dysfunction, 
suggesting that the process of aging can induce structural and functional 
impairments in vascular networks. Together with elevated cell senescence, 
pre-existing comorbidities, and the emerging concept of age-associated 
inflammatory imbalance, impaired vascular functions can significantly increase 
one's risk in acquiring age-related diseases. In this short review, we highlight 
some current clinical and experimental evidence of how biological aging 
contributes to three vascular-associated pathologies: atherosclerosis, stroke, 
and Alzheimer's disease.

A voluntary contraction of muscles with one arm increases the excitability of 
corticospinal projections to the contralateral resting arm, a phenomenon known 
as crossed facilitation. Although many motor tasks engage simultaneous 
activation of the arm and trunk, interactions between corticospinal projections 
targeting these segments remain largely unknown. Using transcranial magnetic 
stimulation over the trunk representation of the primary motor cortex, we 
examined motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the resting erector spinae (ES) 
muscle when the contralateral arm remained at rest or performed 20% of isometric 
maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) into index finger abduction, thumb 
abduction, elbow flexion, and elbow extension. We found that MEP size in the ES 
increased during all voluntary contractions, with greater facilitation occurring 
during elbow flexion and index finger abduction. To further examine the origin 
of changes in MEP size, we measured short-interval intracortical inhibition 
(SICI) and cervicomedullary MEPs (CMEPs) in the ES muscle during elbow flexion 
and index finger abduction and when the arm remained at rest. Notably, SICI 
decreased and CMEPs remained unchanged in the ES during both voluntary 
contractions compared with rest, suggesting a cortical origin for the effects. 
Our findings reveal crossed facilitatory interactions between trunk extensor and 
proximal and distal arm muscles, particularly for elbow flexor and index finger 
muscles, likely involving cortical mechanisms. These interactions might reflect 
the different role of these muscles during functionally relevant arm and trunk 
movements. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Many of the tasks of daily life involve simultaneous 
activation of the arm and trunk. We found that responses in the erector spinae 
muscles evoked by motor cortical stimulation increased in size during elbow 
flexion and extension and during index finger abduction and thumb abduction. 
Crossed facilitation with the trunk was more pronounced during elbow flexion and 
index finger abduction. These results might reflect the different role of these 
muscles during arm and trunk movements.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 670,000 people in the UK have dementia. Previous 
literature suggests that physical exercise could slow dementia symptom 
progression.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a 
bespoke exercise programme, in addition to usual care, on the cognitive 
impairment (primary outcome), function and health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) of people with mild to moderate dementia (MMD) and carer burden and 
HRQoL.
DESIGN: Intervention development, systematic review, multicentred, randomised 
controlled trial (RCT) with a parallel economic evaluation and qualitative 
study.
SETTING: 15 English regions.
PARTICIPANTS: People with MMD living in the community.
INTERVENTION: A 4-month moderate- to high-intensity, structured exercise 
programme designed specifically for people with MMD, with support to continue 
unsupervised physical activity thereafter. Exercises were individually 
prescribed and progressed, and participants were supervised in groups. The 
comparator was usual practice.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog). The secondary outcomes were 
function [as measured using the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale 
(BADLS)], generic HRQoL [as measured using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, three-level 
version (EQ-5D-3L)], dementia-related QoL [as measured using the Quality of Life 
in Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) scale], behavioural symptoms [as measured using 
the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)], falls and fractures, physical fitness (as 
measured using the 6-minute walk test) and muscle strength. Carer outcomes were 
HRQoL (Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease) (as measured using the EQ-5D-3L) 
and carer burden (as measured using the Zarit Burden Interview). The economic 
evaluation was expressed in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained from a NHS and Personal Social Services perspective. We 
measured health and social care use with the Client Services Receipt Inventory. 
Participants were followed up for 12 months.
RESULTS: Between February 2013 and June 2015, 494 participants were randomised 
with an intentional unequal allocation ratio: 165 to usual care and 329 to the 
intervention. The mean age of participants was 77 years [standard deviation (SD) 
7.9 years], 39% (193/494) were female and the mean baseline ADAS-Cog score was 
21.5 (SD 9.0). Participants in the intervention arm achieved high compliance 
rates, with 65% (214/329) attending between 75% and 100% of sessions. Outcome 
data were obtained for 85% (418/494) of participants at 12 months, at which 
point a small, statistically significant negative treatment effect was found in 
the primary outcome, ADAS-Cog (patient reported), with a mean difference of -1.4 
[95% confidence interval (CI) -2.62 to -0.17]. There were no treatment effects 
for any of the other secondary outcome measures for participants or carers: for 
the BADLS there was a mean difference of -0.6 (95% CI -2.05 to 0.78), for the 
EQ-5D-3L a mean difference of -0.002 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.04), for the QoL-AD 
scale a mean difference of 0.7 (95% CI -0.21 to 1.65) and for the NPI a mean 
difference of -2.1 (95% CI -4.83 to 0.65). Four serious adverse events were 
reported. The exercise intervention was dominated in health economic terms.
LIMITATIONS: In the absence of definitive guidance and rationale, we used a 
mixed exercise programme. Neither intervention providers nor participants could 
be masked to treatment allocation.
CONCLUSIONS: This is a large well-conducted RCT, with good compliance to 
exercise and research procedures. A structured exercise programme did not 
produce any clinically meaningful benefit in function or HRQoL in people with 
dementia or on carer burden.
FUTURE WORK: Future work should concentrate on approaches other than exercise to 
influence cognitive impairment in dementia.

Bloodstream infections are associated with considerable morbidity and health 
care costs. Molecular rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) are a promising complement 
to conventional laboratory methods for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections 
and may reduce the time to effective therapy among patients with bloodstream 
infections. The concurrent implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs 
(ASPs) may reinforce these benefits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectivenesses of competing strategies for the diagnosis of bloodstream 
infection alone or combined with an ASP. To this effect, we constructed a 
decision-analytic model comparing 12 strategies for the diagnosis of bloodstream 
infection. The main arms compared the use of mRDT and conventional laboratory 
methods with or without an ASP. The baseline strategy used as the standard was 
the use of conventional laboratory methods without an ASP, and our 
decision-analytic model assessed the cost-effectivenesses of 5 principal 
strategies: mRDT (with and without an ASP), mRDT with an ASP, mRDT without an 
ASP, conventional laboratory methods with an ASP, and conventional laboratory 
methods without an ASP. Furthermore, based on the availability of data in the 
literature, we assessed the cost-effectivenesses of 7 mRDT subcategories, as 
follows: PCR with an ASP, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of 
flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis with an ASP, peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in 
situ hybridization (PNA-FISH) with an ASP, a blood culture nanotechnology 
microarray system for Gram-negative bacteria (BC-GP) with an ASP, a blood 
culture nanotechnology microarray system for Gram-positive bacteria (BC-GN) with 
an ASP, PCR without an ASP, and PNA-FISH without an ASP. Our patient population 
consisted of adult inpatients in U.S. hospitals with suspected bloodstream 
infection. The time horizon of the model was the projected life expectancy of 
the patients. In a base-case analysis, cost-effectiveness was determined by 
calculating the numbers of bloodstream infection deaths averted, the numbers of 
quality-adjusted life years gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs). In a probabilistic analysis, uncertainty was addressed by plotting 
cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves for various 
willingness-to-pay thresholds. In the base-case analysis, MALDI-TOF analysis 
with an ASP was the most cost-effective strategy, resulting in savings of 
$29,205 per quality-adjusted life year and preventing 1 death per 14 patients 
with suspected bloodstream infection tested compared to conventional laboratory 
methods without an ASP (ICER, -$29,205/quality-adjusted life year). BC-GN with 
an ASP (ICER, -$23,587/quality-adjusted life year), PCR with an ASP (ICER, 
-$19,833/quality-adjusted life year), and PCR without an ASP (ICER, 
-$21,039/quality-adjusted life year) were other cost-effective options. In the 
probabilistic analysis, mRDT was dominant and cost-effective in 85.1% of 
simulations. Importantly, mRDT with an ASP had an 80.0% chance of being 
cost-effective, while mRDT without an ASP had only a 41.1% chance. In 
conclusion, our findings suggest that mRDTs are cost-effective for the diagnosis 
of patients with suspected bloodstream infection and can reduce health care 
expenditures. Notably, the combination of mRDT and an ASP can result in 
substantial health care savings.

Despite advances in malignant pleural mesothelioma therapy, life expectancy of 
affected patients remains short. The limited efficiency of treatment options is 
mainly caused by inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity of mesotheliomas. This 
diversity can be observed at the morphological and molecular levels. Molecular 
analyses reveal a high heterogeneity (i) between patients; (ii) within different 
areas of a given tumor in terms of different clonal compositions; and (iii) 
during treatment over time. The aim of the present review is to highlight this 
diversity and its therapeutic implications.

Cranial irradiation is the main therapeutic strategy for treating primary and 
metastatic brain tumors. However, radiation is well-known to induce several 
unexpected side effects including emotional disorders. Although 
radiation-induced depression may cause decreased quality of life after 
radiotherapy, investigations of its molecular mechanism and therapeutic 
strategies are still insufficient. In this study, we found that behavioral 
symptoms of depression on mice models with the decrease of BrdU/NeuN- and 
Dcx-positive populations and MAP-2 expression in hippocampus were induced by 
cranial irradiation, and transthyretin (TTR) was highly expressed in hippocampus 
after irradiation. It was shown that overexpression of TTR resulted in the 
inhibition of retinol-mediated neuritogenesis. PAK1 phosphorylation and MAP-2 
expression were significantly reduced by TTR overexpression following 
irradiation. Moreover, we observed that treatment of allantoin and neferine, the 
active components of Nelumbo nucifera, interrupted irradiation-induced TTR
