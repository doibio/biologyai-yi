unique in onco-cardiology.
CONCLUSIONS: Heart function monitoring is critical during anti-cancer therapy so 
that we can early identify cardiac abnormalities and actively adopt measures to 
prevent myocardial injury.

AIMS: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) is a 
life-threatening entity with a highly heterogeneous genetic background. Cardiac 
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can identify fibrofatty scar by late gadolinium 
enhancement (LGE). Our aim is to investigate genotype-phenotype correlation in 
ARVC/D mutation carriers, focusing on CMR-LGE and myocardial fibrosis patterns.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A cohort of 44 genotyped patients, 33 with definite and 11 
with borderline ARVC/D diagnosis, was characterized using CMR and divided into 
groups according to their genetic condition (desmosomal, non-desmosomal 
mutation, or negative). We collected information on cardiac volumes and 
function, as well as LGE pattern and extension. In addition, available 
ventricular myocardium samples from patients with pathogenic gene mutations were 
histopathologically analysed. Half of the patients were women, with a mean age 
of 41.6 ± 17.5 years. Next-generation sequencing identified a potential 
pathogenic mutation in 71.4% of the probands. The phenotype varied according to 
genetic status, with non-desmosomal male patients showing lower left ventricular 
(LV) systolic function. LV fibrosis was similar between groups, but distribution 
in non-desmosomal patients was frequently located at the posterolateral LV wall; 
a characteristic LV subepicardial circumferential LGE pattern was significantly 
associated with ARVC/D caused by desmin mutation. Histological analysis showed 
increased fibrillar connective tissue and intercellular space in all the 
samples.
CONCLUSION: Desmosomal and non-desmosomal mutation carriers showed different 
morphofunctional features but similar LV LGE presence. DES mutation carriers can 
be identified by a specific and extensive LV subepicardial circumferential LGE 
pattern. Further studies should investigate the specificity of LGE in ARVC/D.

IMPORTANCE: No studies to date have examined support by the National Institutes 
of Health (NIH) for primary and secondary prevention research in humans and 
related methods research that measures the leading risk factors or causes of 
death or disability as outcomes or exposures.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize NIH support for such research.
DESIGN AND SETTING: This serial cross-sectional study randomly sampled NIH 
grants and cooperative agreements funded during fiscal years 2012 through 2017. 
For awards with multiple subprojects, each was treated as a separate project. 
Study characteristics, outcomes, and exposures were coded from October 2015 
through February 2019. Analyses weighted to reflect the sampling scheme were 
completed in March through June 2019. Using 2017 data from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention and 2016 data from the Global Burden of Disease 
project, the leading risk factors and causes of death and disability in the 
United States were identified.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the percentage of the NIH 
prevention research portfolio measuring a leading risk factor or cause of death 
or disability as an outcome or exposure.
RESULTS: A total of 11 082 research projects were coded. Only 25.9% (95% CI, 
24.0%-27.8%) of prevention research projects measured a leading cause of death 
as an outcome or exposure, although these leading causes were associated with 
74.0% of US mortality. Only 34.0% (95% CI, 32.2%-35.9%) measured a leading risk 
factor for death, although these risk factors were associated with 57.3% of 
mortality. Only 31.4% (95% CI, 29.6%-33.3%) measured a leading risk factor for 
disability-adjusted life-years lost, although these risk factors were associated 
with 42.1% of disability-adjusted life-years lost. Relatively few projects 
included a randomized clinical trial (24.6%; 95% CI, 22.5%-26.9%) or involved 
more than 1 leading cause (3.3%; 95% CI, 2.6%-4.1%) or risk factor (8.8%; 95% 
CI, 7.9%-9.8%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, the leading risk 
factors and causes of death and disability were underrepresented in the NIH 
prevention research portfolio relative to their burden. Because so much is 
already known about these risk factors and causes, and because randomized 
interventions play such a vital role in the development of clinical and public 
health guidelines, it appears that greater attention should be given to develop 
and test interventions that address these risk factors and causes, addressing 
multiple risk factors or causes when possible.

BACKGROUND: Proximal femoral fractures are strongly associated with morbidity 
and mortality in elderly patients. Mortality is highest among frail 
institutionalized elderly with both physical and cognitive comorbidities who 
consequently have a limited life expectancy. Evidence based guidelines on 
whether or not to operate on these patients in the case of a proximal femoral 
fracture are lacking. Practice variation occurs, and it remains unknown if 
nonoperative treatment would result in at least the same quality of life as 
operative treatment. This study aims to determine the effect of nonoperative 
management versus operative management of proximal femoral fractures in a 
selected group of frail institutionalized elderly on the quality of life, level 
of pain, rate of complications, time to death, satisfaction of the patient (or 
proxy) and the caregiver with the management strategy, and health care 
consumption.
METHODS: This is a multicenter, observational cohort study. Frail 
institutionalized elderly (70 years or older with a body mass index < 18.5, a 
Functional Ambulation Category of 2 or lower pre-trauma, or an American Society 
of Anesthesiologists score of 4 or 5), who sustained a proximal femoral fracture 
are eligible to participate. Patients with a pathological or periprosthetic 
fractures and known metastatic oncological disease will be excluded. Treatment 
decision will be reached following a structured shared decision process. The 
primary outcome is quality of life (Euro-QoL; EQ-5D-5 L). Secondary outcome 
measures are quality of life measured with the QUALIDEM, pain level (PACSLAC), 
pain medication use, treatment satisfaction of patient (or proxy) and 
caregivers, quality of dying (QODD), time to death, and direct medical costs. A 
cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analysis will be done, using the EQ-5D 
utility score and QUALIDEM score, respectively. Non-inferiority of nonoperative 
treatment is assumed with a limit of 0.15 on the EQ-5D score. Data will be 
acquired at 7, 14, and 30 days and at 3 and 6 months after trauma.
DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide insight into the true value 
of nonoperative treatment of proximal femoral fractures in frail elderly with a 
limited life expectancy. The results may be used for updating (inter)national 
treatment guidelines.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered at the Netherlands Trial Register 
(NTR7245; date 10-06-2018).

BACKGROUND: Coronary artery aneurysms in most cases require surgical treatment 
once diagnosed. Lifelong anticoagulation is often needed after surgery. We 
herein describe a 55-year-old man who was asymptomatic and diagnosed with right 
giant coronary artery aneurysm combined with right atrial fistula.
CASE PRESENTATION: This is a case of asymptomatic giant right coronary artery 
aneurysm concurrent with coronary artery fistula. Because the aneurysm was in 
the distal right posterior descending coronary artery, right coronary artery 
ligation and fistula occlusion through the right atrium were performed in the 
absence of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aneurysm was excluded without impacting 
the myocardial blood supply, and the patient was exempted from lifelong 
anticoagulation regimen. The follow-up revealed favorable outcomes and the 
patient's life expectancy was improved.
CONCLUSION: Decompression and exclusion without cardiopulmonary bypass can be 
adopted for distal coronary artery aneurysms that do not involve or only have a 
limited impact on distal blood supply. This procedure can exempt the patient 
from the lifelong anticoagulation regimen. In addition, the risk for myocardial 
ischemia caused by the thrombus in the aneurysm can also be avoided. The whole 
procedure is comparatively easy to perform.

BACKGROUND: We have previously modelled that the optimal number of comprehensive 
stroke centres (CSC) providing endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in England would 
be 30 (net 6 new centres). We now estimate the relative effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of increasing the number of centres from 24 to 30.
METHODS: We constructed a discrete event simulation (DES) to estimate the 
effectiveness and lifetime cost-effectiveness (from a payer perspective) using 
1 year's incidence of stroke in England. 2000 iterations of the simulation were 
performed comparing baseline 24 centres to 30.
RESULTS: Of 80,800 patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke/year, 21,740 
would be affected by the service reconfiguration. The median time to treatment 
for eligible early presenters (< 270 min since onset) would reduce from 195 (IQR 
155-249) to 165 (IQR 105-224) minutes. Our model predicts reconfiguration would 
mean an additional 33 independent patients (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 0-1) and 
30 fewer dependent/dead patients (mRS 3-6) per year. The net addition of 6 
centres generates 190 QALYs (95%CI - 6 to 399) and results in net savings to the 
healthcare system of £1,864,000/year (95% CI -1,204,000 to £5,017,000). The 
estimated budget impact was a saving of £980,000 in year 1 and £7.07 million in 
years 2 to 5.
CONCLUSION: Changes in acute stroke service configuration will produce clinical 
and cost benefits when the time taken for patients to receive treatment is 
reduced. Benefits are highly likely to be cost saving over 5 years before any 
capital investment above £8 million is required.

OBJECTIVE: To assess survival and identify predictors of survival more than 
30-days after discharge in a cohort of consecutive patients diagnosed with 
pneumococcal pneumonia.
METHODS: Observational study including all consecutive immunocompetent adult 
patients surviving more than 30-days after hospitalization. The bacteriological 
diagnosis was based on the results of urinary antigen testing and/or blood 
culture. Life expectancy was calculated for each patient considering their sex, 
age and date of discharge.
RESULTS: We included 1114 patients that survived more than 30- days after 
discharge. Of them, 431 (38.6%) died during follow-up (median follow-up of 6.7 
years). Age, history of cancer, liver disease, chronic renal disease, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, atrial arrhythmia and 
coronary disease, red cell distribution width (RDW) > 15%, positive blood 
culture, hematocrit < 30% and living in a nursing home were independent risk 
factors for reduced long-term survival after hospital discharge. Cumulative 1-, 
3- and 5-year survival rates were 93.9%, 85.3% and 76%, respectively. Among 
non-survivors, 361 (83.8%) died earlier than expected given their life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival after hospital discharge is mainly associated with age and 
comorbidities. The findings of bacteremia and elevated RDW on admission could 
help identify patients at high risk of long-term mortality.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant recipients must take immunosuppressant drugs to 
prevent rejection and maintain transplant function. Medicare coverage of 
immunosuppressant drugs for kidney transplant recipients ceases 36 months after 
transplantation, potentially increasing the risk of transplant failure. A 
contemporary economic analysis of extending Medicare coverage for the duration 
of transplant survival using current costs of immunosuppressant medications in 
the era of generic equivalents may inform immunosuppressant drug policy.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to determine the incremental cost and 
effectiveness of extending Medicare coverage for immunosuppressive drugs over 
the duration of transplant survival, compared with the current policy of 
36-month coverage, from the perspective of the Medicare payer. The expected 
improvement in transplant survival by extending immunosuppressive drug coverage 
was estimated from a cohort of privately insured transplant recipients who 
receive lifelong immunosuppressant drug coverage compared with a cohort of 
Medicare-insured transplant recipients, using multivariable survival analysis.
RESULTS: Extension of immunosuppression Medicare coverage for kidney transplant 
recipients led to lower costs of -$3077 and 0.37 additional quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) per patient. When the improvement in transplant survival 
associated with extending immunosuppressant coverage was reduced to 50% of that 
observed in privately insured patients, the strategy of extending drug coverage 
had an incremental cost-utility ratio of $51,694 per QALY gained. In a threshold 
analysis, the extension of immunosuppression coverage was cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000, $50,000, and $0 per QALY if it results 
in a decrease in risk of transplant failure of 5.5%, 7.8%, and 13.3%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Extending immunosuppressive drug coverage under Medicare from the 
current 36 months to the duration of transplant survival will result in better 
patient outcomes and cost-savings, and remains cost-effective if only a fraction 
of anticipated benefit is realized.

BACKGROUND: People experiencing homelessness have significantly shorter life 
expectancies and higher rates of morbidity and mortality than the general 
population. Many barriers have been identified to providing palliative care to 
this population. This study examines health and social service providers' 
experiences providing end-of-life care to people experiencing homelessness, 
seeking recommendations to improve both patient and provider experience.
METHODS: Qualitative study using phenomenological approach. Qualitative and 
quantitative surveys with 136 health and social service providers in Ontario's 
South East Local Health Integration Network, in-depth interview with 10 key 
informants.
FINDINGS: Participants approached the end-of-life care of people experiencing 
homelessness from a framework of dignity and respect. Themes included barriers 
to end-of-life care internal to the health care system; care avoidance; the 
experience of stigma for this population when accessing end-of-life care; lack 
of provider information and awareness on how to provide care for marginalized 
groups, how to provide care in the context of substance use, and how to assist 
clients in accessing the formal palliative care system; and the need for harm 
reduction approaches to end-of-life care for persons experiencing homelessness.
DISCUSSION: Focusing on harm reduction, and using the framework of 
Equity-Oriented Health Care to make systemic, cultural, and policy changes to 
develop a palliative-care system for persons experiencing homelessness may 
improve care experience for both patients and providers.

Pufferfish are ideal models for vertebrate chromosome evolution studies. The 
yellowbelly pufferfish, Takifugu flavidus, is an important marine fish species 
in the aquaculture industry and ecology of East Asia. The chromosome assembly of 
the species could facilitate the study of chromosome evolution and functional 
gene mapping. To this end, 44, 27 and 50 Gb reads were generated for genome 
assembly using Illumina, PacBio and Hi-C sequencing technologies, respectively. 
More than 13 Gb full-length transcripts were sequenced on the PacBio platform. A 
366 Mb genome was obtained with the contig of 4.4 Mb and scaffold N50 length of 
15.7 Mb. 266 contigs were reliably assembled into 22 chromosomes, representing 
95.9% of the total genome. A total of 29,416 protein-coding genes were predicted 
and 28,071 genes were functionally annotated. More than 97.7% of the BUSCO genes 
were successfully detected in the genome. The genome resource in this work will 
be used for the conservation and population genetics of the yellowbelly 
pufferfish, as well as in vertebrate chromosome evolution studies.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is an important differential diagnosis of 
neurodegenerative diseases. The prevalence of dementia is increasing in line 
with the worldwide increase in life expectancy. NPH can be divided into 
idiopathic (iNPH) and secondary (sNPH) which is important in terms of clinical 
symptoms, future progress, and the outcome of possible treatment. The full 
clinical triad is not prevalent in all of the cases and the pathophysiology of 
iNPH remains unclear. Diagnosis is based on the evaluation of clinical symptoms 
(Hakim's triad) combined with an MRI assessment, evaluation of CSF dynamic 
parameters by different methods such as a tap test, lumbar infusion test (LIT), 
and external lumbar drainage (ELD). Despite the development of diagnostic 
techniques and strategies in management, NPH remains to be a challenge for the 
specialists despite more than 50 years of research. However, results of this 
research have brought new opportunities in the diagnosis, therapy, and quality 
of life as well as survival time of NPH patients with improved symptoms. The aim 
of this article is to present the pathophysiological hypotheses of NPH and an 
overview of the diagnostic techniques used for the evaluation of NPH patients.

BACKGROUND: Systematic screening skin examination has been proposed to reduce 
melanoma-related mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential effectiveness of screening, in a demographic 
at high risk of melanoma mortality.
DESIGN: A cohort Markov state-transition model was developed comparing 
systematic screening versus usual care (no systematic screening). In the base 
case, we evaluated a sensitivity and specificity of 20% and 85%, respectively, 
for usual care (incidental detection) and 50% sensitivity and 85% specificity 
from systematic screening. We examined a wide range of values in sensitivity 
analyses.
PARTICIPANTS: Potential screening strategies applied to a hypothetical 
population of 10,000 white men from ages 50-75.
MAIN MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, measured in cost per 
quality adjusted life year (QALY).
KEY RESULTS: Using base case assumptions, screening every 2 years beginning at 
age 60 reduced melanoma mortality by 20% with a cost-utility of $26,503 per QALY 
gained. Screening every 2 years beginning at age 50 reduced mortality by 30% 
with an incremental cost-utility of $67,970 per QALY. Results were sensitive to 
differences in accuracy of systematic screening versus usual care, and costs of 
screening, but were generally insensitive to costs of biopsy or treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming moderate differences in accuracy with systematic screening 
versus usual care, screening for melanoma every 2 years starting at age 50 or 60 
may be cost-effective in white men. Results are sensitive to degree of 
difference in sensitivity with screening compared to usual care. Better studies 
of the accuracy of systematic screening exams compared with usual care are 
required to determine whether a trial of screening should be undertaken.

The beneficial effects of caloric restriction (CR) on health and life expectancy 
are well documented, although its ability to slow down age-dependent cognitive 
decline and the underlying biochemical changes remains unclear. Therefore, the 
aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CR on spatial memory in aged 
Wistar rats, as well as on monoaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in 
the hippocampus (HPC). As such, animals maintained on different dietary regimes 
were trained in the Morris Water Maze (MWM): old rats (24-27 months) maintained 
on a 30% CR diet from four months of age, old rats (24-27 months) with 
unrestricted access to food (Ad Libitum); and adult rats (3-4 months) with Ad 
Libitum access to food. As well as their performance in the spatial memory task, 
monoamine levels, and NMDA and AMPA receptor subunit expression in the HPC were 
also assessed in these rats, as was the plasma corticosterone as a measure of 
the pituitary-adrenal response to stress. Accordingly, it appears that CR 
attenuates the spatial memory decline in aged rats and the age-associated 
decrease in the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA, as well as the expression of the 
GluA1 and GluA2 AMPA receptor subunits in the HPC. In addition, CR augments the 
noradrenaline in this structure, although it did not modify the age-associated 
increase in plasma corticosterone levels. These findings support the positive 
effect of CR on spatial memory, suggesting that enhancing monoaminergic and 
glutamatergic neurotransmission in the HPC may help improve learning and memory 
in aged animals.

Plants are considered to be a leading source for possible human therapeutic 
agents. This holistic study has investigated the anti-quorum sensing (anti-QS), 
anti-infection, antioxidant and anti-photoaging properties of neglected plant 
Diplocyclos palmatus. The results showed that D. palmatus methanolic leaf 
extract (DPME) effectively inhibited the quorum sensing (QS) regulated virulence 
factor production as well as biofilm formation in Serratia marcescens. The 
transcriptomic analysis revealed that DPME significantly downed the expression 
of QS-regulated genes such as fimA, fimC, flhC, bsmB, pigP and shlA in S. 
marcescens, which supports the outcome of in vitro bioassays. Further, the 
docking study revealed that the presence of active compounds, namely tocopherols 
and phytol, DPME exhibited its anti-QS activity against S. marcescens. In 
addition, DPME treatment extended the lifespan of S. marcescens infected C. 
elegans by the action of dropping the internal accumulation. Further, qPCR 
analysis clearly revealed that DPME treatment significantly up-regulated the 
expression of the lifespan-related gene (daf-16) and immune-related genes 
(clec-60, clec-87, lys-7 and bec-1) in S. marcescens infected C.elegans. On the 
other hand, DPME extensively reduced the UV-A induced ROS stress, thereby, 
extended the lifespan in UV-A photoaged C. elegans. Further, the qPCR analysis 
also confirmed the up-regulation of daf-16, clec-60, clec-87 and col-19 genes 
which advocated the improvement of the lifespan, healthspan and collagen 
production in UV-A photoaged C. elegans. Further bioassays evidenced that that 
the lifespan extension of photoaged C. elegans was accomplished by the actions 
of antioxidants such as tocopherols and phytol in DPME.

PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of escalating doses of 
norepinephrine or norepinephrine plus the adjunctive use of vasopressin or 
angiotensin II as a second-line vasopressor for septic shock.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Decision tree analysis was performed to compare costs and 
outcomes associated with norepinephrine monotherapy or the two adjunctive 
second-line vasopressors. Short- and long-term outcomes modeled included ICU 
survival and lifetime quality-adjusted-life-years (QALY) gained. Costs were 
modeled from a payer's perspective, with a willingness-to-pay threshold set at 
$100,000/unit gained. One-way (tornado diagrams) and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Adjunctive vasopressin was the most cost-effective therapy, and 
dominated both norepinephrine monotherapy and adjunctive angiotensin II by 
producing higher ICU survival at less cost. For the lifetime horizon, while 
norepinephrine monotherapy was least expensive, adjunctive vasopressin was the 
most cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $19,762 / 
QALY gained. Although adjunctive angiotensin II produced more QALYs compared to 
norepinephrine monotherapy, it was dominated in the long-term evaluation by 
second-line vasopressin. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated model robustness and 
medication costs were not significant drivers of model results.
CONCLUSIONS: Vasopressin is the most cost-effective second-line vasopressor in 
both the short- and long-term evaluations. Vasopressor price is a minor 
contributor to overall cost.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has grown significantly in China. 
However, little is known about the survival outcome of people with type 2 
diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The purpose of this study is to 
examine the survival of this population and the risk factors for mortality in 
one suburb cohort of Beijing, China.
METHODS: Four hundred and forty-five people with DKD (48.8% male, age at onset 
of diabetes 48.8 ± 11.0 years, age at enrollment 57.5 ± 11.6 years) were 
enrolled in one suburb of Beijing, China between January 1st, 2003 and December 
31st, 2015. Mortality ascertainment was censored by December 31st, 2015. 
Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional 
hazards regression models were served for risk factor analysis of mortality. The 
Chiang method was used to estimate life expectancy by age.
RESULTS: A total of 78 deaths were identified during the 3232 person-years of 
follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed significantly higher 
risks of mortality with respect to older age, higher systolic blood pressure 
(SBP), lower body mass index (BMI) and lower estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR). The life expectancy at age of 50 was estimated to be 12.3 (95%, CI: 
9.0-16.1) years. Circulatory disease was the leading cause of death in this 
population (accounting for 43.6% of all deaths), followed by diabetic 
complications (33.3%) and respiratory disease (6.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: Data from one Chinese cohort from 2003 through 2015 showed that 
people with DKD faced higher risk of death and shorter life expectancy. Factors 
significantly increasing risk of death included older age, higher SBP, lower BMI 
and lower eGFR. There is an urgent need to early detection, closely monitoring 
and effective intervention on DKD.

This review reports the most current evidence on the effects of exercise 
interventions on improving physical function, daily living activities and 
quality of life in community-dwelling frail older adults. CBMdisc, CNKI, 
Wanfang, VIP, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central), 
Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and EBSCO were searched from inception to July 
2019. Exercise interventions were found to improve knee extension strength and 
normal speed and were beneficial in lower Time up and go test (TUG) and 
improving semi-tandem, Berg balance scale (BBS), Short Physical Performance 
Battery (SPPB), Physical Performance Test (PPT) and Activities of daily living 
(ADL). Further well-designed studies are needed to explore the most effective 
intervention type and dose.

BACKGROUND: Sit-to-stand (STS) movement is an important transition movement for 
daily life. STS movement is typically seen in children aged 1 year and older. 
According to the motor development process, the ability of children in different 
age groups to perform STS movement would be different before they meet the 
mutuality. However, it is still unclear whether there are changes in the STS 
movement of growing children and adults.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Are there any differences in the movement time, joint angles, 
and peak joint moments of STS in typically developing (TD) children?
METHODS: Motion analysis and the force plate system were used to analyze the STS 
movement in 77 healthy participants. All participants were asked to perform the 
STS movement using an adjustable bench with a self-selected pattern. Statistical 
analysis was done with respect to age (4-6, 7-9, 10-12, 18-25 years) and body 
height (1.00-1.20, 1.20-1.40, 1.40-1.60, 1.60-1.80 meters).
RESULTS: Children aged 4-6 years (or 1.0-1.20 m height) took less time to 
accomplish STS movement than adults (or 1.60-1.80 m height). Children aged 4-9 
years performed STS movement by using more trunk and hip flexion and anterior 
pelvic tilt, but less knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion than children aged 
10-12 years and adults. At the final standing position, children aged 4-12 years 
exhibited more knee extension and more ankle plantar flexion than adults. In 
addition, children aged 4-12 years had more peak trunk-pelvic extension and less 
peak knee extension moments than adults.
SIGNIFICANCE: Different strategies to achieve the STS task were found among 
children aged 4-12 years in terms of total movement time, joint angle, and joint 
moments. Adult-like kinematic and kinetic STS patterns were not seen in children 
up to 12 years old.

New and emerging advances in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment combined with 
limited healthcare resources highlight the need for detailed decision-analytic 
models to evaluate costs, survival and quality-adjusted life years. The 
objectives of this article were to estimate the expected lifetime treatment cost 
of CRC for an average 70-year-old patient and to test the applicability and 
flexibility of a model in predicting survival and costs of changing treatment 
scenarios. The analyses were based on a validated semi-Markov model using data 
from a Norwegian observational study (2049 CRC patients) to estimate transition 
probabilities and the proportion resected. In addition, inputs from the 
Norwegian Patient Registry, guidelines, literature, and expert opinions were 
used to estimate resource use. We found that the expected lifetime treatment 
cost for a 70-year-old CRC patient was €47,300 (CRC stage I €26,630, II €38,130, 
III €56,800, and IV €69,890). Altered use of palliative chemotherapy would 
increase the costs by up to 29%. A 5% point reduction in recurrence rate for 
stages I-III would reduce the costs by 5.3% and increase overall survival by 
8.2 months. Given the Norwegian willingness to pay threshold per QALY gained, 
society's willingness to pay for interventions that could result in such a 
reduction was on average €28,540 per CRC patient. The life years gained by CRC 
treatment were 6.05 years. The overall CRC treatment costs appear to be low 
compared to the health gain, and the use of palliative chemotherapy can have a 
major impact on cost. The model was found to be flexible and applicable for 
estimating the cost and survival of several CRC treatment scenarios.
