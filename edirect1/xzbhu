Observational studies of up to 12 months duration showed that glatiramer acetate 
(GA) treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis may result in decreased 
fatigue and improves health-related quality of life (HRQoL), with no changes in 
disability or mood. We investigated whether in the second year of treatment 
these improvements are sustained, disability or mood yet improved, and 2-year 
changes may be predicted by changes in the first 6 or 12 months. The 
multi-center FOCUS-Extension study was a prospective extension of the 12-month, 
international, observational FOCUS study and included 67 patients (38 
treatment-naïve, 29 pre-treated) of the Dutch FOCUS cohort. Fatigue, HRQoL, 
depression and disability were measured by the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), Leeds 
Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (LMSQoL) questionnaire, Beck Depression 
Inventory-Short Form and the Guy's Neurological Disability Scale. A 2-year 
period of GA treatment was associated with -0.52 and +0.66 standard deviation 
changes in mean FIS and LMSQoL scores compared to baseline, whereas disability 
and mood remained unchanged. For FIS and LMSQoL, the Pearson correlation 
coefficients between 6-month changes and 2-year scores were 0.47 and 0.50, and 
between 12-month changes and 2-year scores 0.65 and 0.62. After 2 years GA 
treatment, the improvements in fatigue and HRQoL observed at 1 year are 
sustained, whereas disability and mood remain unchanged compared to baseline. 
Moreover, the levels of fatigue and HRQoL at 2 years GA treatment are predicted 
by the improvements at 6 months.

Gastrointestinal cancers are asymptomatic in early tumor development, leading to 
high mortality rates. Peri- or postoperative chemotherapy is a common strategy 
used to prolong the life expectancy of patients with these diseases. 
Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which anticancer drugs exert their 
effect is crucial to the development of anticancer therapies, especially when 
drug resistance occurs and an alternative drug is needed. By integrating 
high-throughput techniques and computational modeling to explore biological 
systems at different levels, from gene expressions to networks, systems biology 
approaches have been successfully applied in various fields of cancer research. 
In this review, we highlight chemotherapy studies that reveal potential 
signatures using microarray analysis, next-generation sequencing (NGS), 
proteomic and metabolomic approaches for the treatment of gastrointestinal 
cancers.

Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) represent almost half the 
world's population, and all five national governments recently committed to work 
nationally, regionally, and globally to ensure that universal health coverage 
(UHC) is achieved. This analysis reviews national efforts to achieve UHC. With a 
broad range of health indicators, life expectancy (ranging from 53 years to 73 
years), and mortality rate in children younger than 5 years (ranging from 10·3 
to 44·6 deaths per 1000 livebirths), a review of progress in each of the BRICS 
countries shows that each has some way to go before achieving UHC. The BRICS 
countries show substantial, and often similar, challenges in moving towards UHC. 
On the basis of a review of each country, the most pressing problems are: 
raising insufficient public spending; stewarding mixed private and public health 
systems; ensuring equity; meeting the demands for more human resources; managing 
changing demographics and disease burdens; and addressing the social 
determinants of health. Increases in public funding can be used to show how 
BRICS health ministries could accelerate progress to achieve UHC. Although all 
the BRICS countries have devoted increased resources to health, the biggest 
increase has been in China, which was probably facilitated by China's rapid 
economic growth. However, the BRICS country with the second highest economic 
growth, India, has had the least improvement in public funding for health. 
Future research to understand such different levels of prioritisation of the 
health sector in these countries could be useful. Similarly, the role of 
strategic purchasing in working with powerful private sectors, the effect of 
federal structures, and the implications of investment in primary health care as 
a foundation for UHC could be explored. These issues could serve as the basis on 
which BRICS countries focus their efforts to share ideas and strategies.

BACKGROUND: Despite increased life expectancy among patients with cystic 
fibrosis (CF), few studies have examined coping among adolescents and young 
adults with CF. Previous research suggests that stigma associated with chronic 
disease is related to worse physical and psychological health, but optimism may 
be protective. This study examined stigma and optimism among patients with CF.
METHODS: Seventy-two patients with CF (ages 14 to 25) completed a self-report 
questionnaire assessing stigma, distress, CF-specific quality of life (QoL), and 
optimism. Objective health data were recorded from patient medical records.
RESULTS: Greater stigma was associated with lower pulmonary function, QoL, and 
optimism. Stigma was positively correlated with distress. Optimism moderated the 
relationship between stigma and anxiety (p<0.001), and between stigma and 
emotional functioning (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Stigma is related to worse lung function and psychological health 
in patients with CF, but higher levels of optimism may act as a protective 
factor.

[Insulin resistance and cognitive function].

[Article in Japanese]

Sasaoka T, Wada T, Tsuneki H.

Risk of Alzheimer disease is increased in patients with diabetes. Insulin 
resistance is identified as a pathogenic mechanism of impaired cognitive 
dysfunction. Amyloid beta oligomers cause impaired insulin signaling at IRS-1 
via mechanisms of TNFalpha and JNK activation. Attenuation of PI-3 kinase 
pathway is also involved in the hyper-phosphorylation of Tau. Impairment of 
orexin function is connected to the age related insulin resistance and 
shortening of life expectancy. Synapse deterioration and loss via these 
mechanisms underlying defective brain insulin signaling result in cognitive 
dysfunction. Stimulation of insulin signaling is a developing therapeutic 
approach in Alzheimer disease. Nasal insulin administration, thiazolidinedione, 
and GLP-1 receptor agonist possess neuronal protective effects in the treatment 
of mild cognitive dysfunction. Further identification of the pathogenic 
mechanism connecting between Alzheimer disease and insulin resistance 
contributes to development of novel therapeutics in Alzheimer disease.

Spiritual Well-Being for Increasing Life Expectancy in Palliative Radiotherapy 
Patients: A Questionnaire-Based Study.

Spiritual well-being in patients with an advanced cancer has been found to 
positively correlate with subjective well-being, lower pain levels, hope and 
positive mood states, high self-esteem, social competence, purpose in life, and 
overall quality of life. In this regard, Quran recitation is stated to be an 
efficient way to increase patient spirituality and also to handle life's 
everyday challenges. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 
listening, reading, and watching the text of the Holy Quran, called (in this 
study) Quran recitation, for increasing life expectancy (LE) in palliative 
radiotherapy patients admitted to Radiotherapy Department of Seyed alshohada 
Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. A questionnaire-based study was carried out on a total 
of 89 palliative radiotherapy patients between March 2012 and June 2012. 
Informed consent was obtained. The patients were requested to complete a 
standardized questionnaire which was designed based on the European Organization 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer C30 Scale Quality of Life Questionnaire 
(EORTC C30 Scale QLQ). A computer program (SPSS version 16.0, Chicago, IL, USA) 
was used, and data were analyzed by the Wilcoxon test and Spearman's rank 
correlation. All hypotheses were tested using a criterion level of P = 0.05. 
There was a significant difference for frequency and duration of Quran 
recitation among patients, before and after the diagnosis of their cancer (P = 
0.03). Using the Spearman's rank correlation, it was found that there was a 
correlation between Quran recitation and subjective well-being (r = 0.352, P < 
0.001). Moreover, there was a correlation between Quran recitation and 
increasing LE (r = 0.311, P < 0.003). More than 60% of the patients stated that 
more frequent recitation would lead to more LE and/or greater reassurance. On 
the basis of the present work, listening, reading, and watching the text of the 
Holy Quran are useful for increasing LE in palliative radiotherapy patients 
admitted to Radiotherapy Department. In other words, a benefit of Quran 
recitation on outcome of radiotherapy for palliative radiotherapy patients was 
found.

The African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, is a unicellular parasite causing 
African Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in animals). Due 
to some of its unique properties, it has emerged as a popular model organism in 
systems biology. A predictive quantitative model of glycolysis in the 
bloodstream form of the parasite has been constructed and updated several times. 
The Silicon Trypanosome is a project that brings together modellers and 
experimentalists to improve and extend this core model with new pathways and 
additional levels of regulation. These new extensions and analyses use 
computational methods that explicitly take different levels of uncertainty into 
account. During this project, numerous tools and techniques have been developed 
for this purpose, which can now be used for a wide range of different studies in 
systems biology.

Distributional cost-effectiveness analysis of health care programmes--a 
methodological case study of the UK Bowel Cancer Screening Programme.

Asaria M(1), Griffin S, Cookson R, Whyte S, Tappenden P.

Author information:
(1)Centre for Health Economics, University of York, York, UK.

This paper presents an application of a new methodological framework for 
undertaking distributional cost-effectiveness analysis to combine the objectives 
of maximising health and minimising unfair variation in health when evaluating 
population health interventions. The National Health Service bowel cancer 
screening programme introduced in 2006 is expected to improve population health 
on average and to worsen population health inequalities associated with 
deprivation and ethnicity--a classic case of 'intervention-generated 
inequality'. We demonstrate the distributional cost-effectiveness analysis 
framework by examining two redesign options for the bowel cancer screening 
programme: (i) the introduction of an enhanced targeted reminder aimed at 
increasing screening uptake in deprived and ethnically diverse neighbourhoods 
and (ii) the introduction of a basic universal reminder aimed at increasing 
screening uptake across the whole population. Our analysis indicates that the 
universal reminder is the strategy that maximises population health, while the 
targeted reminder is the screening strategy that minimises unfair variation in 
health. The framework is used to demonstrate how these two objectives can be 
traded off against each other, and how alternative social value judgements 
influence the assessment of which strategy is best, including judgements about 
which dimensions of health variation are considered unfair and judgements about 
societal levels of inequality aversion.

Economic return from the Women's Health Initiative estrogen plus progestin 
clinical trial: a modeling study.

Comment in
    Ann Intern Med. 2014 May 6;160(9):651-2.

BACKGROUND: The findings of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus 
progestin (E+P) trial led to a substantial reduction in use of combined hormone 
therapy (cHT) among postmenopausal women in the United States. The economic 
effect of this shift has not been evaluated relative to the trial's $260 million 
cost (2012 U.S. dollars).
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the economic return from the WHI E+P trial.
DESIGN: Decision model to simulate health outcomes for a "WHI scenario" with 
observed cHT use and a "no-WHI scenario" with cHT use extrapolated from the 
pretrial period.
DATA SOURCES: Primary analyses of WHI outcomes, peer-reviewed literature, and 
government sources.
TARGET POPULATION: Postmenopausal women in the United States, aged 50 to 79 
years, who did not have a hysterectomy.
TIME HORIZON: 2003 to 2012.
PERSPECTIVE: Payer.
INTERVENTION: Combined hormone therapy.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease incidence, expenditure, quality-adjusted life-years, 
and net economic return.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The WHI scenario resulted in 4.3 million fewer 
cHT users, 126,000 fewer breast cancer cases, 76,000 fewer cardiovascular 
disease cases, 263,000 more fractures, 145,000 more quality-adjusted life-years, 
and expenditure savings of $35.2 billion. The corresponding net economic return 
of the trial was $37.1 billion ($140 per dollar invested in the trial) at a 
willingness-to-pay level of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The 95% CI for the net economic return of the 
trial was $23.1 to $51.2 billion.
LIMITATION: No evaluation of indirect costs or outcomes beyond 2012.
CONCLUSION: The WHI E+P trial made high-value use of public funds with a 
substantial return on investment. These results can contribute to discussions 
about the role of public funding for large, prospective trials with high 
potential for public health effects.

Diabetes mellitus and kidney disease in the elderly.

[Article in English, Spanish]

Iglesias P, Heras M, Díez JJ.

Management of diabetic elderly patients with chronic kidney disease involves 
specific characteristics that affect both metabolic control and therapeutic 
measures. Blood glucose control targets should be individualised based on life 
expectancy, renal function, hypoglycaemia risk and comorbidity. Metformin may be 
used alone or in combination with other oral anti-diabetic drugs but must be 
discontinued when the glomerular filtration rate is less than 30 mL/min. 
Gliclazide and glipizide are sulfonylureas that do not require dose adjustment 
in chronic kidney disease but they should be avoided in cases of advanced kidney 
disease because of the risk of hypoglycaemia. Repaglinide is the only 
meglitinide recommended in these patients. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors must be 
avoided in patients with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 25 mL/min or 
those undergoing dialysis. Pioglitazone does not require dose adjustment but it 
has potentially adverse effects in this population. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitors are effective and well tolerated. Of the latter, linagliptin does not 
require dose adjustment. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and 
sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are not recommended in elderly 
patients with advanced kidney disease. Lastly, insulin therapy, particularly 
using the new insulin analogues, allows adequate management of hyperglycaemia in 
these patients, with different therapeutic regimens that must be individualised 
in order to avoid hypoglycaemia.

Memorial Hospital at Linkou, and School of Medicine, Chang Gung University, No. 
5 Fuxing Street, Guishan Township, 333, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.

PURPOSE: The use of the palliative prognostic index (PPI) when used only at an 
initial assessment might be inappropriate as a prognostic tool because it does 
not reflect the patient's clinical course. The purpose of this study was to 
assess the utility of PPI score change (∆score) between two assessments as a 
prognostic tool in terminally ill cancer patients categorized as having a poor 
prognosis.
METHODS: A total of 1,035 terminally ill cancer patients categorized as having a 
poor prognosis (initial PPI score >6) under palliative care between January 2006 
and December 2011 at a single medical center in Taiwan were selected. Patients 
were categorized by magnitude of ∆score between the initial PPI and week 1 PPI 
assessments into five groups (<-20, -20 to 0, 0, 0 to 20, and >20 %) for 
survival analysis.
RESULTS: The median survival was 22 days (range, 8-180 days) in all patients. 
Median survival duration was 78, 32, 23, 17, and 14 days, and the death rate at 
the study end was 78.9, 87.1, 96.2, 100, and 100 % in each group, respectively. 
The c-statistic value for predicting life expectancy less than 30, 60, and 90 
days was significantly higher with magnitude of ∆score than with the initial PPI 
score (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Magnitude of PPI score change within 1-week interval provides a 
significant difference in survival prediction and is more reliable than initial 
PPI alone to identify terminally ill cancer patients with better outcome 
potential in those patients considered to have a poor prognosis.

Comment in
    Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2014 Jul;211(1):3-4.

OBJECTIVE: Oregon and federal laws prohibit giving informed consent for 
permanent contraception when presenting for an abortion. The primary objective 
of this study was to estimate the number of unintended pregnancies associated 
with this barrier to obtaining concurrent tubal occlusion and abortion, compared 
with the current policy, which limits women to obtaining interval tubal 
occlusion after abortion. The secondary objectives were to compare the financial 
costs, quality-adjusted life years, and the cost-effectiveness of these 
policies.
STUDY DESIGN: We designed a decision-analytic model examining a theoretical 
population of women who requested tubal occlusion at time of abortion. Model 
inputs came from the literature. We examined the primary and secondary outcomes 
stratified by maternal age (>30 and <30 years). A Markov model incorporated the 
possibility of multiple pregnancies. Sensitivity analyses were performed on all 
variables and a Monte Carlo simulation was conducted.
RESULTS: For every 1000 women age <30 years in Oregon who did not receive 
requested tubal occlusion at the time of abortion, over 5 years there would be 
1274 additional unintended pregnancies and an additional $4,152,373 in direct 
medical costs. Allowing women to receive tubal occlusion at time of abortion was 
the dominant strategy. It resulted in both lower costs and greater 
quality-adjusted life years compared to allowing only interval tubal occlusion 
after abortion.
CONCLUSION: Prohibiting tubal occlusion at time of abortion resulted in an 
increased incidence of unintended pregnancy and increased public costs.

BACKGROUND: In immunocompetent patients with primary central nervous system 
lymphoma (PCNSL), combined modality therapy (CMT) using high-dose methotrexate 
and radiotherapy (WBRT) has improved response rates compared with chemotherapy 
alone. The trade-off is delayed and potentially devastating treatment-related 
neurotoxicity (NT).
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model compared CMT with 
chemotherapy alone in age-stratified patients with PCNSL. Baseline probabilities 
were derived from a systematic literature review. Direct and lost productivity 
costs were collected from a Canadian perspective and presented in Can$ in 2011. 
Outcomes were life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: The quality-adjusted life expectancy was 1.55 QALYs for CMT and 1.53 
QALYs for chemotherapy alone. In younger patients (aged <60 years), CMT yielded 
2.44 QALYs, compared with 1.89 QALYs for chemotherapy alone, yielding an 
expected benefit with CMT of 0.55 QALYs or 6.6 quality-adjusted months. The CMT 
strategy dominated in younger patients, as it was Can$11 951 less expensive than 
chemotherapy alone. The chemotherapy-alone strategy dominated in older patients, 
as it was Can$11 244 less expensive than CMT, and there was no difference in 
QALYs between the strategies. The model was robust in sensitivity analyses of 
key variables tested through the plausible ranges obtained from costing sources 
and published literature.
CONCLUSION: The preferred induction strategy for younger patients with PCNSL 
appears to be CMT, which minimized cost while maximizing life expectancy and 
QALYs. This analysis confirms that the preferred strategy for older patients is 
chemotherapy alone.

frontier approach.

BACKGROUND: To identify best-fitting input sets using model calibration, 
individual calibration target fits are often combined into a single 
goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure using a set of weights. Decisions in the 
calibration process, such as which weights to use, influence which sets of model 
inputs are identified as best-fitting, potentially leading to different health 
economic conclusions. We present an alternative approach to identifying 
best-fitting input sets based on the concept of Pareto-optimality. A set of 
model inputs is on the Pareto frontier if no other input set simultaneously fits 
all calibration targets as well or better.
METHODS: We demonstrate the Pareto frontier approach in the calibration of 2 
models: a simple, illustrative Markov model and a previously published 
cost-effectiveness model of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). For 
each model, we compare the input sets on the Pareto frontier to an equal number 
of best-fitting input sets according to 2 possible weighted-sum GOF scoring 
systems, and we compare the health economic conclusions arising from these 
different definitions of best-fitting.
RESULTS: For the simple model, outcomes evaluated over the best-fitting input 
sets according to the 2 weighted-sum GOF schemes were virtually nonoverlapping 
on the cost-effectiveness plane and resulted in very different incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios ($79,300 [95% CI 72,500-87,600] v. $139,700 [95% CI 
79,900-182,800] per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained). Input sets on the 
Pareto frontier spanned both regions ($79,000 [95% CI 64,900-156,200] per QALY 
gained). The TAVR model yielded similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: Choices in generating a summary GOF score may result in different 
health economic conclusions. The Pareto frontier approach eliminates the need to 
make these choices by using an intuitive and transparent notion of optimality as 
the basis for identifying best-fitting input sets.

Age-specific life table parameters, survivorship, and extra molting of the beet 
armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hübner), were determined at eight constant 
temperatures of 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 33, 34, and 36°C with a variation of 0.5°C 
on sugar beet leaves. No development was observed at 12 and 36°C. The 
survivorship of overall immature stages was higher at 25°C than the other 
temperatures. The highest (0.276 d(-1)) and lowest (0.149 d(-1)) value of the 
intrinsic rate of increase (r) was observed at 30 and 20°C, respectively. 
Although the highest value of the net reproductive rate was at 25°C (377.7 
female offspring at 25°C and 127.4 female offspring at 30°C), the highest value 
of r was at 30°C, which indicated the importance of shorter development time 
(16.9 d at 30°C and 27.2 d at 25°C) in enhancing r. The relationship between 
temperature and r was modeled using the Lactin-2 model. The lower temperature 
threshold, the upper temperature threshold, and optimal temperature for the r 
were estimated at 13.1, 32.2, and 34.1°C, respectively. The mean generation time 
decreased significantly with increasing temperature, with the longest (35.9 d) 
and shortest (15.1 d) mean generation time was calculated at 20 and 33°C, 
respectively.

Nigeria.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the profile and determinants of successful aging in a 
developing country characterized by low life expectancy and where successful 
agers may represent a unique group.
DESIGN: Community-based cohort study.
SETTING: Eight contiguous states in the Yoruba-speaking region of Nigeria.
PARTICIPANTS: A multistage clustered sampling of households was used to select a 
representative sample of individuals (N = 2,149) aged 65 and older at baseline. 
Nine hundred thirty were successfully followed for an average of 64 months 
between August 2003 and December 2009.
MEASUREMENTS: Lifestyle and behavioral factors were assessed at baseline. 
Successful aging, defined using each of three models (absence of chronic health 
conditions, functional independence, and satisfaction with life), was assessed 
at follow-up.
RESULTS: Between 16% and 75% of respondents could be classified as successful 
agers using one of the three models while 7.5% could be so classified using a 
combination of all the models. Correlations between the three models were small, 
ranging from 0.08 to 0.15. Different features predicted their outcomes, 
suggesting that they represent relatively independent trajectories of aging. 
Whichever model was used, more men than women tended to be classified as aging 
successfully. Men who aged successfully, using a combination of all the three 
models, were more likely never to have smoked (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 4.7, 
95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.55-14.46) and to report, at baseline, having 
contacts with friends (aOR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.0-18.76) or participating in 
community activities (aOR = 16.0, 95% CI = 1.23-204.40). In women, there was a 
nonlinear trend for younger age at baseline to predict this outcome.
CONCLUSION: Modifiable social and lifestyle factors predicted successful aging 
in this population, suggesting that health promotion targeting behavior change 
may lead to tangible benefits for health and well-being in old age.

CONTEXT: Having a sense of security is vitally important to patients who have a 
limited life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify the factors associated with patients' sense of 
security during the palliative care period.
METHODS: We recruited 174 adult patients (65% of those eligible) from six 
palliative home care units. The relationship between the patients' sense of 
security during palliative care and individual factors was evaluated in a 
stepwise procedure using the generalized linear model (ordinal multinomial 
distribution and logit link).
RESULTS: Respondents' ratings of their sense of security ranged from 1 (never) 
to 6 (always), with a mean value of 4.6 (SD 1.19). Patients with lower feelings 
of security experienced higher stress; more worry about personal finances; lower 
feelings of self-efficacy; a lower sense of security with the palliative care 
provided (lower ratings on subscales of care interaction); mastery; prevailed 
own identity; higher symptom intensity (especially depression, anxiety, and lack 
of well-being); lower health-related quality of life; lower attachment anxiety 
and avoidance; less support from family, relatives, and friends; lower comfort 
for those closest to them; and more often had gynecological cancer. Six 
variables (mastery, nervousness and stress, gynecological cancer, self-efficacy, 
worrying about personal finances, and avoidance) were selected in building the 
stepwise model.
CONCLUSION: These findings stress the importance of palliative care services in 
supporting dying patients' sense of security through symptom management with a 
wide scope and through supporting the patients' sense of mastery, identity, and 
perception of a secure care interaction and also through attention to the family 
members' situation.

BACKGROUND: An initial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear can be treated with 
surgical reconstruction or focused rehabilitation. The KANON (Knee Anterior 
cruciate ligament, NON-surgical versus surgical treatment) randomized controlled 
trial compared rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction (ACLR) to 
rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACLR and found no difference at 2 years by 
an intention-to-treat analysis of total Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome 
Score (KOOS) results.
PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of early versus delayed ACLR.
STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed for a cost-utility analysis of 
early reconstruction (ER) versus rehabilitation plus optional delayed 
reconstruction (DR). Outcome probabilities and effectiveness were derived from 2 
sources: the KANON study and the Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) 
database. Collectively, these 2 sources provided data from 928 ACL-injured 
patients. Utilities were measured by the Short Form-6 dimensions (SF-6D). Costs 
were estimated from a societal perspective in 2012 US dollars. Costs and 
utilities were discounted in accordance with the United States Panel on 
Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. Effectiveness was expressed in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Principal outcome measures were 
average incremental costs, incremental effectiveness (as measured by QALYs), and 
net health benefits. Willingness to pay was set at $50,000, which is the 
currently accepted standard in the United States.
RESULTS: In the base case, the ER group resulted in an incremental gain of 0.28 
QALYs over the DR group, with a corresponding lower overall cost to society of 
$1572. Effectiveness gains were driven by the low utility of an unstable knee 
and the lower utility for the DR group. The cost of rehabilitation and the rate 
of additional surgery drove the increased cost of the DR group. The most 
sensitive variable was the rate of knee instability after initial 
rehabilitation. When the rate of instability falls to 51.5%, DR is less costly, 
and when the rate of instability falls below 18.0%, DR becomes the preferred 
cost-effective strategy.
CONCLUSION: An economic analysis of the timing of ACLR using data exclusively 
from the KANON trial, MOON cohort, and national average reimbursement revealed 
that early ACLR was more effective (improved QALYs) at a lower cost than 
rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACLR. Therefore, early ACLR should be the 
preferred treatment strategy from a societal health system perspective.

Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is a rare 
autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease associated with mutations in the 
nuclear TYMP gene. As a result, the thymidine phosphorylase (TP) enzyme activity 
is markedly reduced leading to toxic accumulation of thymidine and therefore 
altered mitochondrial DNA. MNGIE is characterized by severe gastrointestinal 
dysmotility, neurological impairment, reduced life expectancy and poor quality 
of life. There are limited therapeutic options for MNGIE. In the attempt to 
restore TP activity, allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been 
used as cellular source of TP. The results of this approach on ∼ 20 MNGIE 
patients showed gastrointestinal and neurological improvement, although the 
5-year mortality rate is about 70%. In this study we tested whether the liver 
may serve as an alternative source of TP. We investigated 11 patients (7M; 35-55 
years) who underwent hepatic resection for focal disorders. Margins of normal 
liver tissue were processed to identify, quantify and localize the TP protein by 
Western Blot, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry, and to evaluate TYMP mRNA 
expression by qPCR. Western Blot identified TP in liver with a TP/GAPDH ratio of 
0.9 ± 0.5. ELISA estimated TP content as 0.5 ± 0.07 ng/μg of total protein. TP 
was identified in both nuclei and cytoplasm of hepatocytes and sinusoidal lining 
cells. Finally, TYMP mRNA was expressed in the liver. Overall, our study 
demonstrates that the liver is an important source of TP. Orthotopic liver 
transplantation may be considered as a therapeutic alternative for MNGIE 
patients.

Progress and challenges in women's health: an analysis of levels and patterns of 
mortality and morbidity.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to provide a summary description of the current 
status of women's health globally and trends since the 1990s.
STUDY DESIGN: A compilation and analytic review of available information was 
performed.
RESULTS: Globally, a woman born in 2010 could expect to live some 3½ years 
longer than her sister born just a decade earlier in 2000 and over 8 years 
longer than her mother or aunt born in 1980. These huge gains in health have, 
however, been unevenly spread, and in many parts of the world, women's lives 
continue to be diminished by preventable illness and premature death due to 
social and gender inequalities and health system inadequacies. These are most 
acute in poor countries and among the poorest women everywhere. Health problems 
that are not adequately addressed in childhood, adolescence and the reproductive 
years have serious adverse repercussions for the children women bear and cast a 
long shadow on their own health as they age.
CONCLUSION: Improvements in health, demographic, economic, social and 
environmental conditions have brought significant benefits to women in terms of 
their health and development but are also associated with new challenges, 
especially for the poorest women. As the causes of death and disability change 
from those associated with acute conditions--infectious diseases and 
pregnancy-related complications--to chronic, long-term conditions--cancer, 
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and mental ill-health--women will be faced 
with accessing and paying for medical care and medicines. Many of these chronic 
conditions can, however, be prevented by a combination of behavioral change and 
early detection. Paying due attention to the health of girls and women today is 
an investment not just for the present but also for the future and for coming 
generations.
IMPLICATIONS: The findings of this review have important implications for health 
systems as well as for broader policy dialogue on the underlying determinants of 
women's health including gender-based inequalities and discrimination. Health 
systems need to be structured and managed in ways that are responsive to the 
needs of girls and women, both for information and for care. Impediments to 
access--including distance, costs, lack of acceptability and 
discrimination--must be removed. Women themselves should be involved in 
designing and delivering health services that meet their needs as patients. They 
need support also in carrying out their roles as carers, both in the formal 
health care sector and within families and communities. Strategies to improve 
women's health must take full account of the underlying determinants of 
health--particularly gender inequality--and address the specific socioeconomic 
and cultural barriers that hamper women in protecting and improving their 
health.
