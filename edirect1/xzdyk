BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are rapidly increasing in 
sub-Saharan African countries, where 96% of global malaria deaths occur. This 
study aimed to investigate the disease burden of NCDs in countries with the 
current highest malaria mortality.
METHODS: Data for this study were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 
2019 study (1990-2019). We selected the ten countries with malaria's highest 
age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) and identified and ranked the five NCDs 
with the highest ASMR in each country. Measures of the NCDs disease burden 
included ASMR, age-standardised disability-adjusted life-years (DALY), years of 
life lost (YLL) and years lost due to a disability (YLD). The Estimated annual 
percentage change (EAPC) was used to examine the trends of the NCDs disease 
burden from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: As of 2019, the ASMR of chronic liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes 
mellitus, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, hypertensive heart disease 
and stroke were higher than the global average. From 1990 to 2019, the ASMR for 
Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic 
kidney disease increased by 3.0%, 10.8%, 13.3%, and the age-standardised DALY 
rate increased by 3.7%, 27.6%, 6.3%, and the increases tended to be in younger 
populations.
CONCLUSION: The double burden of non-communicable and communicable diseases is 
crippling the health systems of many sub-Saharan African countries and is often 
neglected. The prevention, surveillance, and control of diseases require an 
integrated strategy, with governments and non-government organisations aligned 
and supported by the global initiative.

BACKGROUND: Women's empowerment status in menopausal transition is of great 
importance due to the increasing trend of life expectancy and population aging. 
This study was conducted to evaluate the empowerment status of women during the 
menopausal transition in Gonabad, Iran.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Gonabad city in Northeast 
of Iran from April 2017 to March 2018. Cluster sampling was used for selecting 
680 women who were in the menopausal transition. Demographic questionnaire and 
Women's Empowerment Status Questionnaire - a researcher-made questionnaire- was 
used for data collection. Pearson's correlation coefficient, one-way ANOVA, and 
linear regression were used to analyze the data using SPSS version 16; A p-value 
less than 0.05 was considered as significant.
RESULTS: The majority of the participants (510; 76.10%) had a high empowerment 
level. A high empowerment status in the family, economic, social, and health 
domains was observed in 499 (74.50%), 534 (79.70%), 523 (78.05%), and 493 
(73.60%) participants, respectively. The majority of the participants had 
moderate empowerment status in political (427; 70.40%) and religious domains 
(464; 69.30%). There was a negative correlation between the total empowerment 
score and the participants' age (P&lt;0.001), husband's age (P&lt;0.001), and 
the number of children (P&lt;0.001). There was a positive correlation between 
the total empowerment score and education (P=0.003) as well as age of marriage 
(P=0.03).
CONCLUSION: Overall empowerment status of women in menopausal transition in 
Gonabad -Iran was high. However, in political and religious domains, the status 
was moderate. We suggest that empowered women should be invited to share their 
experiences with other females. Development of social networks could provide the 
basis for sharing the experiences of these women and helps policy makers to 
develop community empowerment programs.

Live imaging of migrating and interacting cells in developing embryos has opened 
a new means for deciphering fundamental principles in morphogenesis and 
patterning, which was not possible with classic approaches of experimental 
embryology. In our recent study, we devised a new genetic tool to sparsely label 
cells with a green-fluorescent protein in the broad field of chicken embryos, 
enabling the analysis of cell migration during the early stages of brain 
development. Trajectory analysis indicated that anterior epiblast cells from a 
broad area gather to the head axis to form the brain primordia or brain-abutting 
head ectoderm. Grafting the mCherry-labeled stage (st.) 4 node in an anterior 
embryonic region resulted in the anterior extension of the anterior mesendoderm 
(AME), the precursor for the prechordal plate and anterior notochord, from the 
node graft at st. 5. Grafting the st. 4 node or st. 5 AME at various epiblast 
positions that otherwise develop into the head ectoderm caused local cell 
gathering to the graft-derived AME. The node was not directly associated with 
this local epiblast-gathering activity. The gathered anterior epiblast cells 
developed into secondary brain tissue consisting of consecutive brain portions, 
e.g., forebrain and midbrain or midbrain and hindbrain, reflecting the brain 
portion specificities inherent to the epiblast cells. The observations indicated 
the bipotentiality of all anterior epiblast cells to develop into the brain or 
head ectoderm. Thus, a new epiblast brain field map is proposed, allowing the 
reinterpretation of classical node graft data, and the role of the AME is 
highlighted. The new model leads to the conclusion that the node does not 
directly participate in brain development.

The emergence of deep neural networks has allowed the development of fully 
automated and efficient diagnostic systems for plant disease and pest 
phenotyping. Although previous approaches have proven to be promising, they are 
limited, especially in real-life scenarios, to properly diagnose and 
characterize the problem. In this work, we propose a framework which besides 
recognizing and localizing various plant abnormalities also informs the user 
about the severity of the diseases infecting the plant. By taking a single image 
as input, our algorithm is able to generate detailed descriptive phrases 
(user-defined) that display the location, severity stage, and visual attributes 
of all the abnormalities that are present in the image. Our framework is 
composed of three main components. One of them is a detector that accurately and 
efficiently recognizes and localizes the abnormalities in plants by extracting 
region-based anomaly features using a deep neural network-based feature 
extractor. The second one is an encoder-decoder network that performs 
pixel-level analysis to generate abnormality-specific severity levels. Lastly is 
an integration unit which aggregates the information of these units and assigns 
unique IDs to all the detected anomaly instances, thus generating descriptive 
sentences describing the location, severity, and class of anomalies infecting 
plants. We discuss two possible ways of utilizing the abovementioned units in a 
single framework. We evaluate and analyze the efficacy of both approaches on 
newly constructed diverse paprika disease and pest recognition datasets, 
comprising six anomaly categories along with 11 different severity levels. Our 
algorithm achieves mean average precision of 91.7% for the abnormality detection 
task and a mean panoptic quality score of 70.78% for severity level prediction. 
Our algorithm provides a practical and cost-efficient solution to farmers that 
facilitates proper handling of crops.

BACKGROUND: Robotic surgery for malignant uterine cancer raises issue of 
economic sustainability for providers. The objective of this study was to assess 
the value of surgical admissions for malignant uterine cancer in a University 
Hospital through an analysis of their costs and outcomes by comparing three 
different surgical approaches (laparotomy, laparoscopic, and robotic surgery).
METHODS: Hospitalizations between 1 January 2019 and 31 October 2021 for 
malignant uterine cancer surgery were selected and stratified. For each surgical 
approach, mean values (with 95% confidence intervals, CI) were calculated for 
cost items. Moreover, 30-day readmission frequency was calculated for the three 
approaches compared to each other. ANOVA and Student's t-test and relative risk 
(RR) were used for statistical analysis. A break-even analysis was carried out 
by evaluating the volume of robotic and non-robotic surgical admissions.
RESULTS: A total of 1,336 hospitalizations were included in the study, 366 with 
robotic, 591 with laparoscopic, and 379 with laparotomy surgery. Robotic 
surgery, compared to laparoscopic and laparotomy ones, showed a statistically 
significant difference (p < 0.001) in the economic margin, which was largely 
negative (-1069.18 €; 95%CI:-1240.44--897.92 €) mainly due to devices cost, and 
a lower percentage of 30-day readmissions (1.4%; 95%CI: 0.2-2.6%), with a 
statistically significant difference only vs. laparotomy (p = 0.029). 
Laparoscopic compared to laparotomy surgery showed a significantly (p < 0,001) 
more profitable economic margin (1692.21 €; 95%CI: 1531.75 €-1852.66 €) without 
a significant difference for 30-day readmissions. Break-even analysis showed 
that, on average, for each malignant uterine cancer elective surgery performed 
laparoscopically, 1.58 elective robotic surgeries are sustainable for the 
hospital (95% CI: 1.23-2.06).
CONCLUSION: Break-even analysis could be a useful tool to support hospital 
management in planning and governance of malignant uterine cancer surgery. 
Systematic application of this tool will allow defining over time right 
distribution of robotic, laparoscopic, and laparotomy surgeries' volumes to 
perform to ensure both quality and economic-financial balance and therefore 
value of uterine oncological surgery. Concerning research, this study paves the 
way for a multicentric study, the extension of outcomes of malignant uterine 
surgery to be considered and assessed, and the future inclusion of other 
therapeutic interventions in the analysis.

Background: Adolescents are more likely than adults to engage in risky health 
behaviors such as smoking, drinking, and sexual activity. Community development 
plays a role in reducing adolescents' personal, cognitive, and social skill 
deficits. A review of the effectiveness of community-development interventions 
is required to advance our understanding of how the intervention reduce health 
risk behaviors. This study analyze type and effectiveness of adolescents' 
community development programs reduce multiple health risk behaviors among 
adolescents. Methods: This scoping review used the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). 
With a date range of 2015-2021, searches were conducted in PubMed, EBSCO, and 
ProQuest using keywords (((Life skill education) OR (community development)) AND 
((health risk behavior) OR (risk behavior)) AND ((adolescent) OR (adolescence) 
OR (teenagers) OR (teens) OR (youth))). After title and abstract checking, 
full-text retrieval, and data extraction, data were synthesized based on the 
main objectives. The most important data were tabulated. Results: Most studies 
showed that community development-based interventions effectively reduce 
adolescents' health risk behaviors, including risky sexual behaviors, drug and 
alcohol use. Interventions were carried out in schools, places of worship, and 
communities, involving adolescents, educational institutions, health 
professionals, religious leaders, and families. Conclusion: This review can 
assist community health nurses, policymakers, researchers, and teachers in 
developing and implementing effective community-development programs that ensure 
knowledge, attitudes, and skills transfer to reduce health risk behaviors.

Truncus arteriosus (TA) is a very rare congenital anomaly with complex 
cardiovascular anatomy and high lethality also due to severe associated 
anatomical variants and pathologies. As TA has a massive impact on the survival 
of a newborn and usually has to be surgically treated. Thus, it is of high 
importance to understand this congenital cardiovascular disease and associated 
complications, to improve life expectancy and outcome of these patients. We 
recently came across a newborn female patient with a rare complex case of 
persistent TA type 2 associated with further complex cardiovascular anomalies, 
who received a contrast enhanced CT scan on the 3 rd day post-partum, showing 
complex cardiovascular abnormalities that were ultimately incompatible with 
life.

BACKGROUND: Risk stratification in long QT syndrome (LQTS) patients is important 
for optimizing patient care and informing clinical decision making. We developed 
a risk prediction algorithm with prediction of 5-year absolute risk of the first 
life-threatening arrhythmic event [defined as aborted cardiac arrest, sudden 
cardiac death, or appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) 
shock] in LQTS patients, accounting for individual risk factors and their 
changes over time.
METHODS: Rochester-based LQTS Registry included the phenotypic cohort consisting 
of 1,509 LQTS patients with a QTc ≥ 470 ms, and the genotypic cohort including 
1,288 patients with single LQT1, LQT2, or LQT3 mutation. We developed two 
separate risk prediction models which included pre-specified time-dependent 
covariates of beta-blocker use, syncope (never, syncope while off beta blockers, 
and syncope while on beta blockers), and sex by age < and ≥13 years, baseline 
QTc, and genotype (for the genotypic cohort only). Follow-up started from 
enrollment in the registry and was censored at patients' 50s birthday, date of 
death due to reasons other than sudden cardiac death, or last contact, whichever 
occurred first. The predictive models were externally validated in an 
independent cohort of 1,481 LQTS patients from Pavia, Italy.
RESULTS: In Rochester dataset, there were 77 endpoints in the phenotypic cohort 
during a median follow-up of 9.0 years, and 47 endpoints in the genotypic cohort 
during a median follow-up of 9.8 years. The time-dependent extension of 
Harrell's generalized C-statistics for the phenotypic model and genotypic model 
were 0.784 (95% CI: 0.740-0.827) and 0.785 (95% CI: 0.721-0.849), respectively, 
in the Rochester cohort. The C-statistics obtained from external validation in 
the Pavia cohort were 0.700 (95% CI: 0.610-0.790) and 0.711 (95% CI: 
0.631-0.792) for the two models, respectively. Based on the above models, an 
online risk calculator estimating a 5-year risk of life-threatening arrhythmic 
events was developed.
CONCLUSION: This study developed two risk prediction algorithms for phenotype 
and genotype positive LQTS patients separately. The estimated 5-year absolute 
risk can be used to quantify a LQTS patient's risk of developing 
life-threatening arrhythmic events and thus assisting in clinical decision 
making regarding prophylactic ICD therapy.

BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) has become a public health problem among elderly 
in developing countries with the gradual increase in life expectancy.
AIM/OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the prognosis factors and 
chronological trends of TB in elderly in Southern Tunisia.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. All TB patients aged ≥60 years, 
recorded in the Center of TB Control between 1995 and 2016, were included. 
Chronological trends of TB were analyzed by calculating the correlation 
coefficient of Spearman (Rho). Multivariate analysis was done by binary logistic 
regression (Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR); CI; p) to determine the independent risk 
factors associated with unsuccessful outcome in elderly. A p value <0.05 was 
considered as statistically significant.
RESULTS: Overall, 512 new elderly TB cases were notified between 1995 and 2016, 
with an average of 23.3 new cases/year. The mean TB incidence rate for elderly 
was 2.31/100,000 population/year. The case-fatality rate of 8.6%. Multivariate 
analysis showed that factors independently associated with unsuccessful outcome 
among elderly patients were age between 80 and 89 (AOR = 4.5; [95% CI: 2, 10.2]; 
p < 0.001), male gender (AOR = 2.2; [95% CI: 1.1, 4.4]; p = 0.026) and 
neuro-meningeal involvement (AOR = 4.6; [95% CI: 1.4, 14.8]; p = 0.011). The 
incidence of TB in elderly patients increased significantly from 0.95/100,000 
population in 1995 to 2.17/100,000 population in 2016 (Rho = 0.48; p = 0.024).
DISCUSSION: A better understanding of TB features in elderly and its 
chronological trends overtime would facilitate to put in place, in the national 
TB control program, strategies geared towards this group of people.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multiorgan disease caused by mutations in the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Approximately 90% of 
the morbidity and mortality are caused by pulmonary involvement. The mean life 
expectancy of patients with CF in 2020 was more than 52 years in Germany. The 
introduction of neonatal screening for CF and the development of a causally 
acting CFTR modulator treatment have clearly improved the prognosis of these 
patients. As an introduction, this article describes important aspects of CF in 
this context in order to go into details of the CF neonatal screening which was 
introduced in Germany in 2016.

Publisher: Die Mukoviszidose (syn.: zystische Fibrose [CF]) ist eine durch 
Varianten im CFTR(„cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator“)-Gen 
bedingte Multiorganerkrankung. 90 % der Morbidität und Mortalität werden durch 
die Lungenbeteiligung verursacht. Die mittlere Lebenserwartung von Patienten mit 
CF betrug in Deutschland im Jahr 2020 mehr als 52 Jahre. Durch die Einführung 
des Neugeborenenscreenings (NGS) auf CF und die Entwicklung einer kausal 
wirkenden CFTR-Modulator-Therapie hat sich die Prognose dieser Patienten 
deutlich verbessert. Der vorliegende Artikel beschreibt einleitend wichtige 
Aspekte der CF-Erkrankung, um in diesem Zusammenhang auch auf die Spezifika des 
im Jahr 2016 in Deutschland eingeführten CF-NGS einzugehen.

BACKGROUND: Visual analysis and data delivery in the form of visualizations are 
of great importance in health care, as such forms of presentation can reduce 
errors and improve care and can also help provide new insights into long-term 
disease progression. Information visualization and visual analytics also address 
the complexity of long-term, time-oriented patient data by reducing inherent 
complexity and facilitating a focus on underlying and hidden patterns.
OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide an overview of visualization techniques 
for time-oriented data in health care, supporting the comparison of patients. We 
systematically collected literature and report on the visualization techniques 
supporting the comparison of time-based data sets of single patients with those 
of multiple patients or their cohorts and summarized the use of these 
techniques.
METHODS: This scoping review used the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. 
After all collected articles were screened by 16 reviewers according to the 
criteria, 6 reviewers extracted the set of variables under investigation. The 
characteristics of these variables were based on existing taxonomies or 
identified through open coding.
RESULTS: Of the 249 screened articles, we identified 22 (8.8%) that fit all 
criteria and reviewed them in depth. We collected and synthesized findings from 
these articles for medical aspects such as medical context, medical objective, 
and medical data type, as well as for the core investigated aspects of 
visualization techniques, interaction techniques, and supported tasks. The 
extracted articles were published between 2003 and 2019 and were mostly situated 
in clinical research. These systems used a wide range of visualization 
techniques, most frequently showing changes over time. Timelines and temporal 
line charts occurred 8 times each, followed by histograms with 7 occurrences and 
scatterplots with 5 occurrences. We report on the findings quantitatively 
through visual summarization, as well as qualitatively.
CONCLUSIONS: The articles under review in general mitigated complexity through 
visualization and supported diverse medical objectives. We identified 3 distinct 
patient entities: single patients, multiple patients, and cohorts. Cohorts were 
typically visualized in condensed form, either through prior data aggregation or 
through visual summarization, whereas visualization of individual patients often 
contained finer details. All the systems provided mechanisms for viewing and 
comparing patient data. However, explicitly comparing a single patient with 
multiple patients or a cohort was supported only by a few systems. These systems 
mainly use basic visualization techniques, with some using novel visualizations 
tailored to a specific task. Overall, we found the visual comparison of 
measurements between single and multiple patients or cohorts to be 
underdeveloped, and we argue for further research in a systematic review, as 
well as the usefulness of a design space.

BACKGROUND: Niemann-Pick Disease Type C1 (NPC1) is a disorder of intracellular 
cholesterol and lipid trafficking that leads to the accumulation of cholesterol 
and lipids in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment, resulting in systemic 
manifestations (including hepatosplenomegaly and lung infiltration) and 
neurodegeneration. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that systemically 
administered 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD; Trappsol® Cyclo™) restores 
cholesterol metabolism and homeostasis in peripheral organs and tissues and in 
the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we assessed the safety, 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of HPβCD in peripheral tissues and the 
CNS in adult subjects with NPC1.
METHODS: A Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study enrolled 13 
subjects with NPC1 who received either 1500 mg/kg or 2500 mg/kg HPβCD 
intravenously every 2 weeks for a total of 7 doses (14 weeks). Subjects were 18 
years or older, with a confirmed diagnosis of NPC1 and evidence of systemic 
involvement on clinical assessment. Pharmacokinetic evaluations in plasma and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were performed at the first and seventh infusions. 
Pharmacodynamic assessments included biomarkers of systemic cholesterol 
synthesis (serum lathosterol) and degradation (serum 4β-hydroxycholesterol), 
secondary sphingomyelin storage (plasma lysosphingomyelin-509, now more 
accurately referred to as N-palmitoyl-O-phosphocholineserine [PPCS]), and 
CNS-specific biomarkers of neurodegeneration (CSF total Tau) and cholesterol 
metabolism (serum 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol [24(S)-HC]). Safety monitoring 
included assessments of liver and kidney function, infusion related adverse 
events, and hearing evaluations.
RESULTS: Ten subjects completed the study, with 6 at the 1500 mg/kg dose and 4 
at the 2500 mg/kg dose. One subject withdrew following the first infusion after 
experiencing hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and 2 subjects withdrew after meeting 
a stopping rule related to hearing loss. Overall, HPβCD had an acceptable safety 
profile. The observed pharmacokinetic profile of HPβCD was similar following the 
first and seventh infusions, with a plasma half-life of 2 h, a maximum 
concentration reached at 6 to 8 h, and no evidence of accumulation. Serum 
biomarkers of cholesterol metabolism showed reduced synthesis and increased 
degradation. Compared to Baseline, filipin staining of liver tissue showed 
significant reductions of trapped unesterified cholesterol at both dose levels 
at Week 14. Plasma PPCS levels were also reduced. HPβCD was detected at low 
concentrations in the CSF (maximum, 33 μM) at both dose levels and persisted 
longer in CSF than in plasma. Total Tau levels in CSF decreased in most 
subjects. Serum levels of 24(S)-HC, a cholesterol metabolite from the CNS that 
is exported across the blood-brain barrier and into the circulation, decreased 
after both the first and seventh doses. Hence, pharmacodynamic assessments in 
both peripheral and CNS-related tissue show target engagement. While not the aim 
of the study, subjects reported favorable impacts on their quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of HPβCD 
administered at two intravenous dose levels to subjects with NPC1 were 
comparable to those observed in preclinical models. HPβCD cleared cholesterol 
from the liver and improved peripheral biomarkers of cholesterol homeostasis. At 
low CSF concentrations, HPβCD appeared to be pharmacologically active in the CNS 
based on the increased efflux of 24(S)-HC and reduction in CSF total Tau, a 
biomarker of CNS neurodegeneration. These data support the initiation of 
longer-term clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous 
HPβCD in subjects with NPC1. (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers: present trial, 
NCT02939547; open-label extension of the present trial, NCT03893071; global 
pivotal trial, NCT04860960).

People with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) are living longer and healthier lives due in 
part to new therapies, called Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance 
Regulator (CFTR) modulators. However, disparities in outcomes still exist, with 
females demonstrating a shorter life expectancy than males; this is opposed to 
the typical female versus male life expectancy in the general United States 
population. In addition, minority populations such as those of Hispanic 
ethnicity and African Americans are less frequently eligible for these new CFTR 
modulators. The mechanisms driving this difference and the relative contribution 
of CFTR to the etiology are not yet elucidated.

BACKGROUND: Tooth loss has been reportedly associated with shorter 
disability-free life expectancy (DFLE). However, no study has explored whether 
oral self-care offsets reduction in DFLE. The present study aimed to assess the 
association between oral self-care and DFLE in older individuals with tooth 
loss.
METHODS: Data on the 13-year follow-up from a cohort study of 14,206 older 
Japanese adults aged ≥ 65 years in 2006 were analyzed. Information on the number 
of remaining teeth was collected using a questionnaire, and the participants 
were then categorized into three groups (0-9, 10-19, and ≥ 20 teeth). 
Additionally, "0-9" and "10-19" groups were divided into two subgroups based on 
whether they practiced oral self-care. DFLE was defined as the average number of 
years a person could expect to live without disability, and was calculated by 
the multistate life table method based on a Markov model.
RESULTS: DFLE (95% confidence interval) was 19.0 years (18.7-19.4) for 0-9 
teeth, 20.1 (19.7-20.5) for 10-19 teeth, and 21.6 (21.2-21.9) for ≥ 20 teeth for 
men. For women, DFLE was 22.6 (22.3-22.9), 23.5 (23.1-23.8), and 24.7 
(24.3-25.1), respectively. Practicing oral self-care was associated with longer 
DFLE, by 1.6-1.9 years with brushing ≥ 2 times a day in people with 0-9 and 
10-19 teeth, and by 3.0-3.1 years with the use of dentures in those with 0-9 
teeth.
CONCLUSIONS: Practicing oral self-care is associated with an increase in DFLE in 
older people with tooth loss.

BACKGROUND: For hypertensive patients without a history of stroke or myocardial 
infarction (MI), the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT) demonstrated 
that treatment with enalapril-folic acid reduced the risk of primary stroke 
compared with enalapril alone. Whether folic acid therapy is an affordable and 
beneficial treatment strategy for the primary prevention of stroke in 
hypertensive patients from the Chinese healthcare sector perspective has not 
been thoroughly explored.
METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside the CSPPT, which 
randomized 20,702 hypertensive patients. A patient-level microsimulation model 
based on the 4.5-year period of in-trial data was used to estimate costs, life 
years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) for enalapril-folic acid vs. enalapril over a lifetime horizon 
from the payer perspective.
RESULTS: During the in-trial follow-up period, patients receiving 
enalapril-folic acid gained an average of 0.016 QALYs related primarily to 
reductions in stroke, and the incremental cost was $706.03 (4553.92 RMB). Over a 
lifetime horizon, enalapril-folic acid treatment was projected to increase 
quality-adjusted life years by 0.06 QALYs or 0.03 life-year relative to 
enalapril alone at an incremental cost of $1633.84 (10,538.27 RMB), resulting in 
an ICER for enalapril-folic acid compared with enalapril alone of $26,066.13 
(168,126.54 RMB) per QALY gained and $61,770.73 (398,421.21 RMB) per life-year 
gained, respectively. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that 
enalapril-folic acid compared with enalapril would be economically attractive in 
74.5% of simulations at a threshold of $37,663 (242,9281 RMB) per QALY (3x 
current Chinese per capita GDP). Several high-risk subgroups had highly 
favorable ICERs < $12,554 (80,976 RMB) per QALY (1x GDP).
CONCLUSIONS: For both in-trial and over a lifetime, it appears that 
enalapril-folic acid is a clinically and economically attractive medication 
compared with enalapril alone. Adding folic acid to enalapril may be a 
cost-effective strategy for the prevention of primary stroke in hypertensive 
patients from the Chinese health system perspective.

BACKGROUND: The adherence to home exercise is generally low despite its 
well-known effect on knee osteoarthritis. Therefore, we developed a home 
exercise application, LongLifeSupport, to provide patients with daily basic 
exercise videos and an automatic recording calendar. We hypothesized that this 
application would encourage patients to exercise and help maintain their 
motivation; this pilot study aimed to determine their exercise adherence rates. 
Using outcome measures, we also aimed to determine the effect of home exercise 
using this application and the factors for its continuation.
METHODS: Twenty patients with knee osteoarthritis were included. The 
participants exercised for 12 weeks. Using pre- and post-tests, we examined 
their satisfaction with continuation (only in the post-test), Japanese knee 
osteoarthritis measure score, short physical performance battery score, 
bilateral knee extension muscle strength, and short test battery for locomotive 
syndrome. Furthermore, we investigated correlations between adherence rates and 
pretest scores of Japanese knee osteoarthritis measure and short test battery 
and between pretest scores and variations in Japanese knee osteoarthritis 
measure and short test battery.
RESULTS: The mean adherence rate was 82.4%. The participants showed ease of 
continuation (100%) and significant improvements in the degree of knee pain, 
pain, and stiffness, and daily life conditions using the Japanese knee 
osteoarthritis measure score, total score, walk seconds, and chair stand seconds 
of the short physical performance battery, as well as the extension muscle 
strength of the right- and pain-side knee. No significant correlations were 
identified between the adherence rate and the pretest or variation.
CONCLUSION: The adherence rate to the application was over 80%. Participants 
with knee osteoarthritis showed almost full satisfaction, reduced pain, and 
improved physical ability. Therefore, the use of this application provided a 
safe exercise program and maintained the exercise motivation of participants. 
Thus, it may be useful for unsupervised home exercise.

ABSTRACT: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
worldwide. The implementation of effective technologies such as Implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death 
requires additional health system resources.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the economic effectiveness of ICD in comparison with 
conservative tactics for preventing life-threatening rhythm disturbances in 
Kazakhstan.
METHODS: A Markov model was built with a time horizon of 35 years. Mortality and 
utility data were obtained from the available literature. The economic 
parameters of the model are based on the approved tariffs for medical services
