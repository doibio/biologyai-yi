OBJECTIVE: The evaluation of efficacy of palliative thoracic radiotherapy (PTR) 
in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to compare it 
with efficacy of supportive care (SC) alone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2012, 235 patients with advanced NSCLC 
(IIIB and IV) and Karnofsky Performance Status accounted 40-30, were qualified 
to PTR. In fact, 125 (53.2%) out of them were treated with PTR, and 110 
(46.8%)-with SC alone, in accordance with patients expectations. There were no 
differences between PTR and SC group with respect to patient and tumor 
characteristics as well as with respect to the type and incidence of symptoms 
related to the local growth of NSCLC. In all 125 PTR patients the delivered 
tumor dose was 20Gy given in five daily fractions over five treatment days. All 
110 patients who refused PTR were treated with SC in another hospital (28.2%), 
in a hospice (21.8%) or by general practitioners at home (50.0%).
RESULTS: The 90-day overall survival rate in the group of PTR patients was 
20.0%, and in the group of SC patients it was 18.2%. Median survival amounted 58 
and 59 days, respectively. The efficacy of PTR and SC, relative to the symptoms 
associated with the local growth of NSCLC, was comparable. Tolerance of PTR was 
poor and early toxicity-significant. Moreover 41.6% of irradiated patients 
received PTR within the last 30 days of their lives and 16.0% of these 
patients-within the last 15 days prior to death.
CONCLUSION: The life expectancy of patients with advanced NSCLC and poor 
performance status (Karnofsky 40-30), who presenting moderate or severe symptoms 
related to the local growth of cancer, is measured in days or weeks. The 
effective method of treatment for these patients is modern supportive care 
rather than PTR.

Governments are routinely involved in the biosecurity of agricultural and food 
imports and exports. This involves controlling the complex ongoing threat of the 
broad range of zoonoses: endemic, exotic and newly emerging. Policy-related 
decision-making in these areas requires accurate information and predictions 
concerning the effects and potential impacts of zoonotic diseases. The aim of 
this article was to provide information concerning the development and use of 
utility-based tools, specifically disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), for 
measuring the burden on human disease (morbidity and mortality) as a consequence 
of zoonotic infections. Issues and challenges to their use are also considered. 
Non-monetary utility approaches that are reviewed in this paper form one of a 
number of tools that can be used to estimate the monetary and non-monetary 
'cost' of morbidity- and mortality-related consequences. Other tools derive from 
cost-of-illness, willingness-to-pay and multicriteria approaches. Utility-based 
approaches are specifically designed to capture the pain, suffering and loss of 
functioning associated with diseases, zoonotic and otherwise. These effects are 
typically complicated to define, measure and subsequently 'cost'. Utility-based 
measures will not be able to capture all of the effects, especially those that 
extend beyond the health sector. These will more normally be captured in 
financial terms. Along with other uncommon diseases, the quality of the relevant 
epidemiological data may not be adequate to support the estimation of losses in 
utility as a result of zoonoses. Other issues in their use have been identified. 
New empirical studies have shown some success in addressing these issues. Other 
issues await further study. It is concluded that, bearing in mind all caveats, 
utility-based methods are important tools in assessing the magnitude of the 
impacts of zoonoses in human disease. They make an important contribution to 
decision-making and priority setting across all sectors. In doing so, they 
highlight the relative importance of the burden of zoonotic disease globally.

Molecular phylogenetic topologies from 40 individuals of 17 sweetlips were 
constructed based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) and cytochrome c 
oxidase subunit I (COI) genes. All phylogenetic results strongly revealed the 
division of the sweetlips into three morphological distinct groups. Group I: 
sweetlips with colorful patterns, Group II and Group III: species with uniformly 
dark patterns. The relationships of those morphologically confused 
Plectorhinchus species were well-resolved in the phylogenetic results. We also 
confirmed that the genus Diagramma was placed inside the colorful Plectorhinchus 
groups, suggesting close relationship of Diagramma within Plectorhinchus. 
Additionally, we found that two species, P. orientalis and P. vittatus, which 
were traditionally considered as synonyms for oriental sweetlips, which were 
suggested to be two distinct species. Sequence divergence also revealed a great 
genetic variation between P. orientalis and P. vittatus (6.0% in Cyt b and 7.4% 
in COI), which was largely greater than the species diagnosis divergence value 
(2%) suggested by Hebert et al. This new finding suggested P. orientalis and P. 
vittatus might be two distinct species and should not be placed as synonyms.

Progesterone in Peri- and Postmenopause: A Review.

Regidor PA(1).

Around 14.5 million peri- and postmenopausal women currently live in Germany. 
Moreover, approximately 450 000 women, each with a life expectancy of around 85 
years, reach menopause every year in Germany. The challenge is therefore to find 
a therapy with few side effects which could improve the quality of life of women 
with menopausal symptoms. The aim of hormone therapy (HT) is to remedy hormone 
deficiencies using substances that offer the best trade-off between benefits and 
risks. This is where progesterone has a new and important role to play. 
Progesterone is one of the most important gestagens. Biologically effective 
progesterone formulations created with micronization techniques have been used 
in clinical practice since 1996. Nevertheless, up until 2003 preference was 
given to synthetic gestagens rather than progesterone. The increased breast 
cancer hazard ratio of 1.23 reported in the WHI study and of 2 given in the 
Million Women Study has been associated with the use of synthetic gestagens. In 
a comparison between synthetic gestagens and progesterone, the E3N Study showed 
that the transdermal administration of estrogen and progesterone did not lead to 
an increase in breast cancer rates (RR: 1.08). The administration of 
progesterone does not change the HDL/LDL cholesterol ratio. Because of its 
anti-mineralocorticoid effect, progesterone has no impact on carbohydrate 
metabolism, hemostasis, blood pressure, thrombogenicity and body weight. The 
administration of 200 mg/day progesterone over 12 days of a menstrual cycle or a 
daily administration of 100 mg combined with an estrogen are a safe and 
well-tolerated option to treat menopausal symptoms, with a better benefit risk 
profile compared to synthetic gestagens.

Publisher: Aktuell leben 14,5 Millionen peri- und postmenopausale Frauen in 
Deutschland. Gleichzeitig gibt es ungefähr 450 000 neue menopausale Frauen pro 
Jahr, die eine Lebenserwartung von bis zu 85 Jahren haben. Die Herausforderung 
besteht daher in einer möglichst nebenwirkungsarmen Therapie bei den Frauen mit 
menopausalen Beschwerden, um einer Verschlechterung ihrer Lebensqualität 
entgegenzuwirken. Ziel einer Hormontherapie (HT) sollte die Behebung des 
Hormonmangels sein, wobei Substanzen mit dem besten Nutzen-Risiko-Profil 
eingesetzt werden sollten. Hier spielt Progesteron eine neue und wichtige Rolle. 
Beim Progesteron handelt es sich um den wichtigsten Vertreter der Gestagene. 
Durch Mikronisierungsverfahren können biologisch wirksame Formulierungen 
hergestellt werden, sodass es seit 1996 Anwendung im klinischen Alltag findet. 
Dennoch wurde bis 2003 den synthetischen Gestagenen und nicht dem Progesteron 
der Vorzug gegeben. Die Erhöhungen des Mammakarzinomrisikos in der WHI-Studie 
auf eine Ratio von 1,23 und in der Million-Women-Studie auf bis zu 2 sind daher 
auch unter diesem Aspekt zu werten. Beim Vergleich zwischen synthetischen 
Gestagenen und Progesteron konnte in der E3N-Studie gezeigt werden, dass es 
unter einer transdermalen Östrogengabe zusammen mit Progesteron nicht zu einer 
Erhöhung der Mammakarzinomrate (RR von 1,08) kommt. Progesteron verändert nicht 
die HDL/LDL-Cholesterinratio. Es hat keinen Einfluss auf den 
Kohlenhydratstoffwechsel, die Hämostase, den Blutdruck, die Thrombogenität und 
das Körpergewicht, da es auch antimineralokortikoid wirkt. Die Gabe von 200 mg 
Progesteron pro Tag über 12 Tage im Zyklus oder die tägliche Gabe von 100 mg in 
Kombination mit einem Östrogen stellen daher eine sichere Option in der 
Behandlung der menopausalen Beschwerden dar, bei gleichzeitig besserem 
Nutzen-Risiko-Profil als die synthetischen Gestagene.

Dutch nurses' willingness to use home telehealth: implications for practice and 
education.

van Houwelingen CT, Barakat A, Best R, Boot WR, Charness N, Kort HS.

Home telehealth (HT) refers to the use of videoconferencing to provide care to 
patients remotely and can help older adults age in place. However, these 
technologies are unlikely to impact care unless health care providers are 
motivated to use them. Education may play a key role in increasing motivation to 
use and competence regarding HT. To help guide the development of nursing 
education to facilitate adoption and use, the current study examined predictors 
of Dutch nurses' willingness to use HT, based on a survey of 67 Dutch nurses 
with and 126 without HT experience. Nurses' willingness to use this technology 
was predicted by HT's (a) perceived usefulness to the client, (b) effort 
expectancy, (c) social influence, and (d) cost expectations. These observed 
relationships are anticipated to help with the development of effective 
educational programs to increase HT use and, therefore, improve older adults' 
quality of life. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 41(4), 47-56.].

BACKGROUND: Many states have laws requiring mammography facilities to tell women 
with dense breasts and negative results on screening mammography to discuss 
supplemental screening tests with their providers. The most readily available 
supplemental screening method is ultrasonography, but little is known about its 
effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of 
supplemental ultrasonography screening for women with dense breasts.
DESIGN: Comparative modeling with 3 validated simulation models.
DATA SOURCES: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; Breast Cancer 
Surveillance Consortium; and medical literature.
TARGET POPULATION: Contemporary cohort of women eligible for routine screening.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Payer.
INTERVENTION: Supplemental ultrasonography screening for women with dense 
breasts after a negative screening mammography result.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Breast cancer deaths averted, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained, biopsies recommended after a false-positive ultrasonography 
result, and costs.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Supplemental ultrasonography screening after a 
negative mammography result for women aged 50 to 74 years with heterogeneously 
or extremely dense breasts averted 0.36 additional breast cancer deaths (range 
across models, 0.14 to 0.75), gained 1.7 QALYs (range, 0.9 to 4.7), and resulted 
in 354 biopsy recommendations after a false-positive ultrasonography result 
(range, 345 to 421) per 1000 women with dense breasts compared with biennial 
screening by mammography alone. The cost-effectiveness ratio was $325,000 per 
QALY gained (range, $112,000 to $766,000). Supplemental ultrasonography 
screening for only women with extremely dense breasts cost $246,000 per QALY 
gained (range, $74,000 to $535,000).
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The conclusions were not sensitive to 
ultrasonography performance characteristics, screening frequency, or starting 
age.
LIMITATION: Provider costs for coordinating supplemental ultrasonography were 
not considered.
CONCLUSION: Supplemental ultrasonography screening for women with dense breasts 
would substantially increase costs while producing relatively small benefits.

Beta-thalassemia is one of most common autosomal recessive disorders worldwide. 
In France, 5 to 10 new major or intermedia forms are diagnosed annually and the 
global prevalence is about 500 cases. Since 20 years and thanks to the 
generalization of iron chelator treatments, the life expectancy has dramatically 
increased. Nearly 90% of the β-thalassemic alleles are point mutations easily 
identified by Sanger sequencing or dedicated methods. The remaining 10% are 
deletions detectable by MLPA or CGH Array. The alpha-globin genotype is also 
essential in the exploration of beta-thalassemia because an alpha-thalassemia 
improves the clinical state whereas an alpha triplication worsens it. The 
additional genotyping of a few HbF inducer polymorphisms allows to predict the 
age of the first transfusion, thanks to a recent dedicated algorithm, making 
beta-thalassemia one of the first potential application of predictive medicine. 
Gene therapy, pre-implantatory diagnosis and new drugs (Sotatercept®, 
hepcidin-like molecules) have also recently contributed to make beta-thalassemia 
a main scientific topic again.

[Reorganize hospitals to improve efficiency and quality].

[Article in Italian]

Macchi L, Pavan A.

The current economic difficulties and the changed epidemiological picture, 
characterized by an increase in life expectancy, which shows in the elderly, 
chronically ill and disabled the main, both health and social, care needs,r 
equires a remark on the hospital network and organization. Today, most of the 
application assistance is usually at low intensity of care, whereas the acute 
event is shrinking. The prevalence of hospital admissions concern the elderly, 
who get into acute events but on a substrate of chronicity and co-morbidity 
conditions. There must be a new model of hospital network, with the possibility 
of converting some hospital centres for medium intensity care and selecting few 
centres for high intensity care, where concentrating the more expensive 
technology and the skill and expertise of the professional. The -suggestion is a 
renewed health planning that detects:- hospitals for widespread disease, 
equipped with emergency war for minor codes-hospital at high intensity of care 
for emergency-urgency- hospital for particular fields of medical speciality and 
research.

Texas at Houston, Houston, TX. Electronic address: adan.rios@uth.tmc.edu.

HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and its consequence, AIDS (acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome) are responsible for a human tragedy of incalculable 
proportions. Patients afflicted by it are susceptible due to an early senescence 
of the immune system to opportunistic infections and malignancies. Since the 
introduction in 1996 of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), the 
landscape of malignancies associated to HIV/AIDS has changed in a significant 
manner as a direct result of significant improvement in the morbidity, mortality 
and life expectancy of HIV infected patients. While there has been a significant 
decrease in developed countries of malignancies such as Kaposi's sarcoma and 
Primary CNS lymphomas associated to the pre-HAART HIV-related immunodeficiency, 
hematological malignancies, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphomas continue to be 
the most common cancer-related cause of death in HIV infected individuals. This 
concise review of the subject highlights aspects of the natural history of HIV 
disease as it relates to the cause of malignancies with emphasis in the 
management and treatment of HIV-related hematological malignancies.

The European Neolithization process started around 12 000 years ago in the Near 
East. The introduction of agriculture spread north and west throughout Europe 
and a key question has been if this was brought about by migrating individuals, 
by an exchange of ideas or a by a mixture of these. The earliest farming 
evidence in Scandinavia is found within the Funnel Beaker Culture complex 
(Trichterbecherkultur, TRB) which represents the northernmost extension of 
Neolithic farmers in Europe. The TRB coexisted for almost a millennium with 
hunter-gatherers of the Pitted Ware Cultural complex (PWC). If migration was a 
substantial part of the Neolithization, even the northerly TRB community would 
display a closer genetic affinity to other farmer populations than to 
hunter-gatherer populations. We deep-sequenced the mitochondrial hypervariable 
region 1 from seven farmers (six TRB and one Battle Axe complex, BAC) and 13 
hunter-gatherers (PWC) and authenticated the sequences using postmortem DNA 
damage patterns. A comparison with 124 previously published sequences from 
prehistoric Europe shows that the TRB individuals share a close affinity to 
Central European farmer populations, and that they are distinct from 
hunter-gatherer groups, including the geographically close and partially 
contemporary PWC that show a close affinity to the European Mesolithic 
hunter-gatherers.

BACKGROUND: In colorectal cancer (CRC), unresectable liver metastases are linked 
to poor prognosis. Systemic chemotherapy with regimens such as FOLFOX 
(combination of infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) is the 
standard first-line treatment. The SIRFLOX trial was designed to assess the 
efficacy and safety of combining FOLFOX-based chemotherapy with Selective 
Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT or radioembolisation) using yttrium-90 resin 
microspheres (SIR-SpheresR; Sirtex Medical Limited, North Sydney, Australia).
METHODS/DESIGN: SIRFLOX is a randomised, multicentre trial of mFOLFOX6 
chemotherapy+/-SIRT as first-line treatment of patients with liver-only or 
liver-predominant metastatic CRC (mCRC). The trial aims to recruit adult 
chemotherapy-naive patients with proven liver metastases with or without limited 
extra-hepatic disease, a life expectancy of >=3 months and a WHO performance 
status of 0-1. Patients will be randomised to receive either mFOLFOX6 or 
SIRT+mFOLFOX6 (with a reduced dose of oxaliplatin in cycles 1-3 following SIRT). 
Patients in both arms can receive bevacizumab at investigator discretion. 
Protocol chemotherapy will continue until there is unacceptable toxicity, 
evidence of tumour progression, complete surgical resection or ablation of 
cancerous lesions, or the patient requests an end to treatment. The primary 
endpoint of the SIRFLOX trial is progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary 
endpoints include: PFS in the liver; tumour response rate (liver and any site); 
site of tumour progression; health-related quality of life; toxicity and safety; 
liver resection rate; and overall survival. Assuming an increase in the median 
PFS from 9.4 months to 12.5 months with the addition of SIRT to mFOLFOX6, 
recruiting >=450 patients will be sufficient for 80% power and 95% confidence.
DISCUSSION: The SIRFLOX trial will establish the potential role of SIRT+standard 
systemic chemotherapy in the first-line management of mCRC with non-resectable 
liver metastases.

BACKGROUND: Prosthetic shoulder arthroplasty provides excellent pain relief and 
functional restoration for patients with glenohumeral arthritis, but concerns of 
survivorship have limited its use in younger patients.
DISCUSSION: Despite general reports of high long-term survivorship, implant 
failure and functional deterioration after total shoulder arthroplasty are major 
concerns in the management of younger patients. In addition to having a longer 
life expectancy, younger patients also tend to be more active and can be 
expected to place greater demands on their shoulder arthroplasty.
CONCLUSION: Alternative strategies have been developed and used for shoulder 
arthroplasty in younger patients. This manuscript reviews current concepts of 
shoulder arthroplasty in young patients.

BACKGROUND: More than half of colorectal cancers occur in patients older than 75 
years. This group is not homogeneous but variably vulnerable to disease, 
diagnostics, treatment procedures and complications.
OBJECTIVES: This review highlights the age-specific aspects of diagnostics and 
screening, curative and adjuvant treatment and the prognostic and predictive 
value of a geriatric assessment.
METHODS: A survey was carried out based on a selection of the relevant 
literature.
RESULTS: The number of publications is currently rapidly increasing and even now 
it becomes apparent that a geriatric assessment carried out by the primary 
physician, can better predict therapy-linked adverse events and allow for a more 
individualized assessment of indications for diagnostics and screening of 
surgical and medicinal treatment. In particular this applies to total mesorectal 
resection and to the adjuvant use of oxaliplatin.
CONCLUSION: Even in the older age group screening colonoscopy and surgical and 
medicinal adjuvant treatment can be reasonably used when aligned to the results 
of a carefully performed geriatric assessment. A severely reduced 
life-expectancy (generally with more than 2 comorbidities) should lead to more 
conservative approaches.

In 2012, 15.13% of the total fiscal medical care expenditure was for 
lifestyle-related health care costs, which was approximately 179 billion yen. 
Lifestyle-related diseases are not only the biggest factor in reducing healthy 
life expectancy but also have the most significant impact on the national 
medical care expenditure. In addition, lifestyle-related diseases can be 
prevented by moderate daily exercise, a well-balanced diet, and not smoking. Our 
fuzzy robust regression model is a controllable model describing a target 
system. Therefore, our model is used to analyze the relation between medical 
care expenditure and selected lifestyle factors.

Causes for concern: is NICE failing to uphold its responsibilities to all NHS 
patients?

Health Economics, University of York.

Organisations across diverse health care systems making decisions about the 
funding of new medical technologies face extensive stakeholder and political 
pressures. As a consequence, there is quite understandable pressure to take 
account of other attributes of benefit and to fund technologies, even when the 
opportunity costs are likely exceed the benefits they offer. Recent evidence 
suggests that NICE technology appraisal is already approving drugs where more 
health is likely to be lost than gained. Also, NICE recently proposed increasing 
the upper bound of the cost-effectiveness threshold to reflect other attributes 
of benefit but without a proper assessment of the type of benefits that are 
expected to be displaced. It appears that NICE has taken a direction of travel, 
which means that more harm than good is being, and will continue to be, done, 
but it is unidentified NHS patients who bear the real opportunity costs.

Cost-value analysis of health interventions: introduction and update on methods 
and preference data.

Norway, erik.nord@folkehelsa.no.

According to the consensus statement from the International Society for 
Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY) 
workshop in Philadelphia in 2007 "concerns for fairness may cause social 
resource allocation preferences to deviate considerably from the ranking that 
consideration of costs per QALY would suggest." Salient concerns for fairness 
include the view that priority should be given to the severely ill over the less 
severely ill, that people have a right to realize their potential for health 
even if their capacity to benefit from treatment is moderate, and that everybody 
has the same right to treatment that averts premature death, even if their 
health and functional level is less than perfect. Cost-value analysis 
incorporates these concerns in formal economic evaluation of health 
interventions and programs and thus has a potential for ranking interventions 
and programs in a way that is more consistent with societal values. Data on the 
strength of public concerns for fairness are now sufficient to be useful in 
formal economic evaluation. The data may, within a context of fair and open 
deliberations, help societal decision makers to roughly indicate the societal 
value of a QALY in different circumstances and thus determine a tentative 
grading of willingness to pay for a QALY.

Cost effectiveness of dabrafenib as a first-line treatment in patients with BRAF 
V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma in Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of dabrafenib versus dacarbazine 
and vemurafenib as first-line treatments in patients with BRAF V600 
mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma from a Canadian healthcare 
system perspective.
METHODS: A partitioned-survival analysis model with three mutually exclusive 
health states (pre-progression, post-progression, and dead) was used. The 
proportion of patients in each state was calculated using survival distributions 
for progression-free and overall survival derived from pivotal trials of 
dabrafenib and vemurafenib. For each treatment, expected progression-free, 
post-progression, overall, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs 
were calculated. Costs were based on list prices, a clinician survey, and 
published sources. A 5-year time horizon was used in the base case. Costs (in 
2012 Canadian dollars [CA$]) and QALYs were discounted at 5% annually. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Dabrafenib was estimated to yield 0.2055 more QALYs at higher cost than 
dacarbazine. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CA$363,136/QALY. In 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses, at a threshold of CA$200,000/QALY, there was 
an 8.2% probability that dabrafenib is cost effective versus dacarbazine. In 
deterministic sensitivity analyses, cost effectiveness was sensitive to survival 
distributions, utilities, and time horizon, with the hazard ratio for overall 
survival for dabrafenib versus dacarbazine being the most sensitive parameter. 
Assuming a class effect for efficacy of BRAF inhibitors, dabrafenib was dominant 
versus vemurafenib (less costly, equally effective), reflecting its assumed 
lower daily cost. Assuming no class effect, dabrafenib yielded 0.0486 more QALYs 
than vemurafenib.
CONCLUSIONS: At a threshold of CA$200,000/QALY, dabrafenib is unlikely to be 
cost effective compared with dacarbazine. It is not possible to make reliable 
conclusions regarding the relative cost effectiveness of dabrafenib versus 
vemurafenib based on available information.

The ongoing longitudinal Adverse Childhood Experiences Study of adults has found 
significant associations between chronic conditions; quality of life and life 
expectancy in adulthood; and the trauma and stress associated with adverse 
childhood experiences, including physical or emotional abuse or neglect, 
deprivation, or exposure to violence. Less is known about the population-based 
epidemiology of adverse childhood experiences among US children. Using the 
2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health, we assessed the prevalence of 
adverse childhood experiences and associations between them and factors 
affecting children's development and lifelong health. After we adjusted for 
confounding factors, we found lower rates of school engagement and higher rates 
of chronic disease among children with adverse childhood experiences. Our 
findings suggest that building resilience-defined in the survey as "staying calm 
and in control when faced with a challenge," for children ages 6-17-can 
ameliorate the negative impact of adverse childhood experiences. We found higher 
rates of school engagement among children with adverse childhood experiences who 
demonstrated resilience, as well as higher rates of resilience among children 
with such experiences who received care in a family-centered medical home. We 
recommend a coordinated effort to fill knowledge gaps and translate existing 
knowledge about adverse childhood experiences and resilience into national, 
state, and local policies, with a focus on addressing childhood trauma in health 
systems as they evolve during ongoing reform.

Post lung transplant complications can have overlapping clinical and imaging 
features, and hence, the time point at which they occur is a key distinguisher. 
Complications of lung transplantation may occur along a continuum in the 
immediate or longer postoperative period, including surgical and mechanical 
problems due to size mismatch and vascular as well as airway anastomotic 
complication, injuries from ischemia and reperfusion, acute and chronic 
rejection, pulmonary infections, and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative 
disorder. Life expectancy after lung transplantation has been limited primarily 
by chronic rejection and infection. Multiple detector computed tomography (MDCT) 
is critical for evaluation and early diagnosis of complications to enable 
selection of effective therapy and decrease morbidity and mortality among lung 
transplant recipients.

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate the microbiological characteristics and 
complications of infective endocarditis (IE) in 119 patients treated in our 
center for IE, diagnosed by modified Duke criteria.
STUDY DESIGN: The archive records of 119 patients (82 [69%] males; 37 [31%] 
females; mean age 39 ± 16 years) with a definite diagnosis of IE between January 
1997 and November 2004 were systematically reviewed for clinical and 
microbiological properties and complications.
RESULTS: The most common complaint of the patients was fever and malaise (102 
patients, 85.7%, each). Culture was negative in 68 patients (57.1%), while 
Staphylococcus aureus was the most common etiological agent in culture positive 
cases. The aortic valve was the most common region of vegetation (43 patients, 
36.1%). The frequency of surgical operation for valvular insufficiency due to IE 
was 75.6%, and the frequency of congestive heart failure was 53.8% (64 
patients).
CONCLUSION: IE is still an important disease considering its high morbidity and 
mortality rates, increased life expectancy of the patients, and increased number 
of valve replacement procedures.

[Revascularization of lower limbs in patients with critical ischaemia induced by 
lesions of infrainguinal arteries].

[Article in Russian]

Pityk AI, Prasol VA, Boĭko VV.

AIM: The study was aimed at comparative analysis of efficacy of endovascular and 
surgical revascularization in patients presenting with lower limb critical 
ischaemia (LLCI) due to lesions of infrainguinal arteries.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective study included a total of 236 patients 
with LLCI undergoing revascularization of lower extremities performed at our 
Institute from 2007 to 2011. The patients were subdivided into two groups. Group 
One consisted of 135 patients subjected to transcutaneous endovascular 
interventions. Group Two comprised a total of 101 patients having endured bypass 
grafting operations. Limb salvage and survival of patients during five years 
were assessed by means of the Kaplan-Meyer method.
RESULTS: Technical success and clinical improvement in the both groups did not 
differ significantly, amounting to 90%. The complication rate and the number of 
major amputations turned out considerably higher in the group of surgical 
treatment as compared with that in the group of endovascular treatment. After 1, 
3 and 5 years the indices of limb salvage and survival (LSS) in the both groups 
did not differ significantly amounting respectively to 94.4, 72.7, and 52.2% in 
the surgical group and 89.7, 67.2 and 46.3% in the endovascular group (p=0.196). 
The number or re-do operations in the remote period due to relapses of LLCI was 
considerably higher in the group of endovascular treatment.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular and surgical methods demonstrate similar immediate and 
remote outcomes in patients with LLCI induced by lesions of infrainguinal 
arteries, but the choice of the method of revascularization should obligatorily 
take into consideration the localization and extension of arterial lesions, the 
presence of an appropriate autovein for the bypass graft, the level of 
perioperative risk, and life expectancy.

Estimation of death rates in US states with small subpopulations.

U.S.A.; National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, MD, 20782, U.S.A.

In US states with small subpopulations, the observed mortality rates are often 
zero, particularly among young ages. Because in life tables, death rates are 
reported mostly on a log scale, zero mortality rates are problematic. To 
overcome the observed zero death rates problem, appropriate probability models 
are used. Using these models, observed zero mortality rates are replaced by the 
corresponding expected values. This enables logarithmic transformations and, in 
some cases, the fitting of the eight-parameter Heligman-Pollard model to produce 
mortality estimates for ages 0-130 years, a procedure illustrated in terms of 
mortality data from several states.

[Development and population parameters of cohorts of the Chilean recluse spider 
Loxosceles laeta].

[Article in Spanish]

Canals M, Solís R.

BACKGROUND: Despite the abundant eco-epidemiological knowledge of the Chilean 
reclusive spider, Loxosceles laeta, which causes all forms of loxoscelism in 
Chile, the main characteristics of this species its stages of development 
remains poorly known especially in the medical area.
OBJECTIVE: In this study we address these issues with the goal of providing 
clear images of the development of this species and for the first time on 
population projections as well as the relationship between mature and immature 
instars, useful data for the control and prevention of accidental bites.
RESULTS: We found that L. laeta is an r-selected species, with R0=2.1, a 
generation time of G=2.1 years, with a concentration of the reproductive value 
of females between the first and second year of life. We determined the average 
sizes and development times of all instars. The first vary between 2.3 mm at 
birth and about 13 mm at adulthood. The total development time was about 1 year.
DISCUSSION: The population projection by Leslie matrix suggested great capacity 
for growth and dispersal with clear seasonal population fluctuations associated 
with reproduction. It also showed that the proportion of immature varied 
seasonally between 80 and 90 %, which means that a house with three or four 
visible adult spiders actually has a population between 20 and 40 spiders in 
total.

BACKGROUND: Unrealistic expectations regarding treatments and clinical outcomes 
may lead to disappointment about therapy and sub-optimal compliance; 
nonetheless, these expectations have not been studied in psoriasis patients yet.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate psoriasis patients' subjective future expectations 
regarding health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and life expectancy, and to 
explore clinical features associated with under- or overestimating behaviour.
METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of consecutive adult patients 
with moderate to severe psoriasis was conducted. HRQOL expectations were 
recorded by applying the EQ-5D descriptive system for 6 months ahead and for 
future ages of 60, 70, 80 and 90 respectively.
RESULTS: In total, 167 patients (71% males) were included in the analysis with 
mean age of 50.4 ± 12.4 years and mean EQ-5D score of 0.71 ± 0.30. Overall 65% 
had chronic plaque psoriasis, 35% nail psoriasis, 35% scalp involvement, 29% 
psoriatic arthritis, 9% inverse psoriasis and 5% palmoplantar psoriasis 
respectively (combinations occurred). Participants expected 0.1 ± 0.23 mean 
improvement in EQ-5D within 6 months (P < 0.001) that achieves the minimum 
clinically important difference. Overall 37% expected improvement and 13% 
decline; however, 49% expected no changes in any of the five dimensions of EQ-5D 
within 6 months. Female gender, inverse or palmoplantar involvement and more 
severe psoriasis were likely associated with higher expectations. Patients at 
the initiation of their first biological at the time of the survey expected 
0.18 ± 0.24 increase that seems to be realistic compared to the EQ-5D utility 
gain achieved in randomized controlled trials. Males expected by 2.7 ± 11.1 
more, while females expected by 5.2 ± 9.3 less life years compared to the 
average statistical gender- and age-matched life expectancy (P < 0.05). Patients 
who expected to be alive at ages of 60, 70, 80 and 90 scored their future EQ-5D 
at ages of 60 to 90: 0.59 ± 0.46, 0.48 ± 0.41, 0.42 ± 0.41 and 0.22 ± 0.47 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of exploring expectations that 
might help to increase patients' compliance.
