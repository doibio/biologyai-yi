Relations between sensory perception, extrusion and fracture in shear, extension 
and compression are examined. Gelatin-based gels are perceived as less firm and 
less hard than expected based on their mechanical properties compared to 
polysaccharide gels that have the same mechanical properties at room temperature 
but melt well above body temperature, underlying the importance of the 
measurement temperature for gels that melt during mastication. Correlations 
between parameters from extrusion and compression, extension and shear are 
verified using mixed polysaccharide gels.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: We previously reported a high correlation between 
several sensory attributes and parameters from an extrusion test. The extrusion 
test showed the most robust correlation, and could be used to assess samples at 
both extremes of the texture range with respect to elasticity, for example, both 
samples that could not be extended as their very low elasticity led to their 
fracture during handling, as well as samples that could not be fractured in 
compression. Here, we reexamine the validity of the relations reported. We 
demonstrate the generality of the relations between large deformation tests and 
extrusion, but the findings underscore the need to take into account the 
measurement temperature for samples that melt during mastication when 
correlating instrumental parameters with sensory perception.

Monitoring outcomes following endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is critical. 
Although evidence from randomized controlled trials has solidified the role of 
EVAR, the analysis of outcomes and "real-world" data has uncovered limitations, 
improved the selection of appropriate patients, and underscored the importance 
of instructions for use. Subsequent studies demonstrated the learning curve of 
EVAR and gradual improvement of outcomes over time. Outcomes analyses will 
continue to play an important role, particularly as technological growth of 
endovascular therapy has enabled treatment of more complex aneurysm pathologies 
and patients. The important analyses are herein reviewed, following the 
development of EVAR in the treatment of intact abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) 
to ruptured AAAs, and finally to complex aneurysms, including thoracoabdominal 
aortic aneurysms and mycotic aneurysms. This includes an overview of the more 
recent results from analyses of branched and fenestrated EVAR, as well as the 
use of chimney grafts. It is emphasized that the success of endovascular repair 
has paradoxically been hampered by its rapid growth and early achievements. Even 
the most advanced engineering developments cannot overcome the long-term effects 
of the progression of aortic disease. The long-term benefits thus require 
careful planning and considerations of the natural history of aneurysms and the 
life expectancy of the patient. Large and international data registry 
collaborations should continue to play a role in providing outcomes analyses to 
guide future improvements.

in rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis.

BACKGROUND: Treat to target (TTT) is a broad concept for treating patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It involves setting a treatment target, usually 
remission or low disease activity (LDA). This is often combined with frequent 
patient assessment and intensive and rapidly adjusted drug treatment, sometimes 
based on a formal protocol.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
TTT compared with routine care.
DATA SOURCES: Databases including EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched from 2008 to 
August 2016.
REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of clinical effectiveness was conducted. 
Studies were grouped according to comparisons made: (1) TTT compared with usual 
care, (2) different targets and (3) different treatment protocols. Trials were 
subgrouped by early or established disease populations. Study heterogeneity 
precluded meta-analyses. Narrative synthesis was undertaken for the first two 
comparisons, but was not feasible for the third. A systematic review of 
cost-effectiveness was also undertaken. No model was constructed as a result of 
the heterogeneity among studies identified in the clinical effectiveness review. 
Instead, conclusions were drawn on the cost-effectiveness of TTT from papers 
relating to these studies.
RESULTS: Sixteen clinical effectiveness studies were included. They differed in 
terms of treatment target, treatment protocol (where one existed) and patient 
visit frequency. For several outcomes, mixed results or evidence of no 
difference between TTT and conventional care was found. In early disease, two 
studies found that TTT resulted in favourable remission rates, although the 
findings of one study were not statistically significant. In established 
disease, two studies showed that TTT may be beneficial in terms of LDA at 6 
months, although, again, in one case the finding was not statistically 
significant. The TICORA (TIght COntrol for RA) trial found evidence of lower 
remission rates for TTT in a mixed population. Two studies reported 
cost-effectiveness: in one, TTT dominated usual care; in the other, step-up 
combination treatments were shown to be cost-effective. In 5 of the 16 studies 
included the clinical effectiveness review, no cost-effectiveness conclusion 
could be reached, and in one study no conclusion could be drawn in the case of 
patients denoted low risk. In the remaining 10 studies, and among patients 
denoted high risk in one study, cost-effectiveness was inferred. In most cases 
TTT is likely to be cost-effective, except where biological treatment in early 
disease is used initially. No conclusions could be drawn for established 
disease.
LIMITATIONS: TTT refers not to a single concept, but to a range of broad 
approaches. Evidence reflects this. Studies exhibit substantial heterogeneity, 
which hinders evidence synthesis. Many included studies are at risk of bias.
FUTURE WORK: Future studies comparing TTT with usual care must link to existing 
evidence. A consistent definition of remission in studies is required. There may 
be value in studies to establish the importance of different elements of TTT 
(the setting of a target, the intensive use of drug treatments and protocols 
pertaining to those drugs and the frequent assessment of patients).
CONCLUSION: In early RA and studies of mixed early and established RA 
populations, evidence suggests that TTT improves remission rates. In established 
disease, TTT may lead to improved rates of LDA. It remains unclear which 
element(s) of TTT (the target, treatment protocols or increased frequency of 
patient visits) drive these outcomes. Future trials comparing TTT with usual 
care and/or different TTT targets should use outcomes comparable with existing 
literature. Remission, defined in a consistent manner, should be the target of 
choice of future studies.

AIM: Although a National Health Screening Program (NHSP) for chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) has been implemented in Korea since 2002, its cost-effectiveness 
has never been determined. This study aimed to estimate the cost-utility of NHSP 
for CKD in Korea.
METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was constructed to compare CKD 
screening strategies of the NHSP with no screening. We developed a model that 
simulated disease progression in a cohort aged 20-120 years or death from the 
societal perspective.
RESULTS: Biannual screening starting at age 40 for CKD by proteinuria (dipstick) 
and estimated glomerular filtration ratio had an ICUR of $66 874/QALY relative 
to no screening. The targeted screening strategy had an ICUR of $37 812/QALY and 
$40 787/QALY for persons with diabetes and hypertension, respectively. ICURs 
improved with lower cost strategies. The most influential parameter that might 
make screening more cost-effective was the effectiveness of treatment on CKD to 
decrease disease progression and mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The Korean NHSP for CKD is more cost-effective for patients with 
diabetes or hypertension than the general population, consistent with prior 
studies. Although it is too early to conclude the cost-effectiveness of the 
Korean NHSP for CKD, this study provides evidence that is useful in evaluating 
the cost-effectiveness of CKD interventions.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in Cancer Care.

Chang A, Abbott DE.

With the increasing complexity of modern medical therapies, it is becoming 
imperative to recognize the marginal cost and gains of increasingly 
sophisticated (and expensive) interventions. By understanding the incremental 
cost of a given intervention, investigators must help answer questions about 
healthcare resource utilization that are not answered by randomized clinical 
trials. The continued funding of biomedical research and pharmaceuticals will 
require more objective study of the return on investment for any given treatment 
modality, and cost-effectiveness analyses will be instrumental in providing 
solutions to the inequalities in healthcare delivery.

Boston, MA.

PURPOSE: End-of-life care for patients with advanced cancer is aggressive and 
costly. Oncologists inconsistently estimate life expectancy and address goals of 
care. Currently available prognostication tools are based on subjective clinical 
assessment. An objective prognostic tool could help oncologists and patients 
decide on a realistic plan for end-of-life care. We developed a predictive model 
(Imminent Mortality Predictor in Advanced Cancer [IMPAC]) for short-term 
mortality in hospitalized patients with advanced cancer.
METHODS: Electronic health record data from 669 patients with advanced cancer 
who were discharged from Yale Cancer Center/Smilow Cancer Hospital were 
extracted. Statistical learning techniques were used to develop a tool to 
estimate survival probabilities. Patients were randomly split into training 
(70%) and validation (30%) sets 20 times. We tested the predictive properties of 
IMPAC for mortality at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days past the day of admission.
RESULTS: For mortality within 90 days at a 40% sensitivity level, IMPAC has 
close to 60% positive predictive value. Patients estimated to have a greater 
than 50% chance of death within 90 days had a median survival time of 47 days. 
Patients estimated to have a less than 50% chance of death had a median survival 
of 290 days. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for IMPAC 
averaged greater than .70 for all time horizons tested. Estimated potential cost 
savings per patient was $15,413 (95% CI, $9,162 to $21,665) in 2014 constant 
dollars.
CONCLUSION: IMPAC, a novel prognostic tool, can generate life expectancy 
probabilities in real time and support oncologists in counseling patients about 
end-of-life care. Potentially avoidable costs are significant.

Aircraft noise increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and mental illness. 
The allowable limit for sound in the vicinity of an airport is 65 decibels (dB) 
averaged over a 24-h 'day and night' period (DNL) in the United States. We 
evaluate the trade-off between the cost and the health benefits of changing the 
regulatory DNL level from 65 dB to 55 dB using a Markov model. The study used 
LaGuardia Airport (LGA) as a case study. In compliance with 55 dB allowable 
limit of aircraft noise, sound insulation would be required for residential 
homes within the 55 dB to 65 dB DNL. A Markov model was built to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of installing sound insulation. One-way sensitivity analyses 
and Monte Carlo simulation were conducted to test uncertainty of the model. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of installing sound insulation for 
residents exposed to airplane noise from LGA was $11,163/QALY gained (95% 
credible interval: cost-saving and life-saving to $93,054/QALY gained). Changing 
the regulatory standard for noise exposure around airports from 65 dB to 55 dB 
comes at a very good value.

Autophagy is an essential vacuolar process of the cell, leading to lysosomal 
degradation and recycling of proteins and organelles, which is extremely 
important in maintaining homeostasis. Multiple roles have been now associated 
with autophagy, in particular a pro-survival role in nutrient starvation or in 
stressful environments, a role in life span extension, in development, or in 
innate and adaptive immunity. This cellular process can also take over 
microorganisms or viral proteins inside autophagosomes and degrade them directly 
in autolysosomes and is then called xenophagy and virophagy, respectively. 
Several Herpesviruses have developed strategies to escape this degradation, by 
expression of specific anti-autophagic proteins. However, we are increasingly 
discovering that Herpesviruses hijack autophagy, rather than just fight it. This 
beneficial effect is obvious since inhibition of autophagy will lead to 
decreased viral titers for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV) or Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV), for example. Conversely, autophagy 
stimulation will improve viral multiplication. The autophagic machinery can be 
used in whole or in part, and can optimize viral propagation or persistence. 
Some viruses block maturation of autophagosomes to avoid the degradation step, 
then autophagosomal membranes are used to contribute to the envelopment and/or 
the egress of viral particles. On the other hand, VZV stimulates the whole 
process of autophagy to subvert it in order to use vesicles containing ATG 
(autophagy-related) proteins and resembling amphisomes for their transport in 
the cytoplasm. During latency, autophagy can also be activated by latent 
proteins encoded by different oncogenic Herpesviruses to promote cell survival 
and achieve long term viral persistence in vivo. Finally, reactivation of 
gammaherpesvirus Murid Herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) in mice appears to be positively 
modulated by autophagy, in order to control the level of inflammation. 
Therefore, Herpesviruses appear to behave more like thieves than fugitives.

Flammer syndrome (FS) is a prevalent and mostly benign condition. Subjects with 
FS seem to have a good life expectancy. Nevertheless, FS subjects are at 
increased risk for certain diseases, mainly when they are challenged by 
psychological stress or other stimuli such as coldness. FS is related to ocular 
diseases, such as normal-tension glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, central serous 
chorioretinopathy, optic nerve compartment syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic 
neuropathy, arterial or venous occlusions in the retina, and choroid and optic 
nerve head, despite the absence of classical vascular risk factors. FS is also 
related to some non-ocular diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, breast cancer, 
and altitude sickness. The role of FS in other diseases such as tinnitus, sudden 
hearing loss, Ménière's disease, anorexia nervosa, and thyroid dysfunction is 
currently under investigation. The exact relationship of FS to related diseases 
however still needs to be established. This may hopefully lead to more targeted 
diagnostics and personalized treatments.

BACKGROUND: The deep-sea hydrothermal vent is one of the most 'extreme' 
environments in the marine realm. Few species are capable of inhabiting such 
ecosystems, despite extremely high productivity there supported by microbial 
chemosynthesis, leading to high biomass and low species richness. Although 
gastropod molluscs are one of the main constituents of megafaunal communities at 
vent ecosystems, most species belong to several typical families (e.g., 
Provannidae, Peltospiridae, Lepetodrilidae) specialised and adapted to life at 
vents.
METHODS: During recent surveys of Okinawa Trough hydrothermal vent systems, two 
snails atypical of vent ecosystems were unexpectedly found in newly discovered 
hydrothermally influenced areas. Shell and radular characteristics were used to 
identify the gastropods morphologically.
RESULTS: One species was a vetigastropod, the calliostomatid Tristichotrochus 
ikukoae (Sakurai, 1994); and the other was a caenogastropod, the muricid 
Abyssotrophon soyoae (Okutani, 1959). Both gastropods were previously only known 
from regular non-chemosynthetic deep-sea and very rare-only two definitive 
published records exist for T. ikukoae and three for A. soyoae. The radula 
formula of Tristichotrochus ikukoae is accurately reported for the first time 
and based on that it is returned to genus Otukaia. For both species, barcode 
sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene were obtained and deposited 
for future references.
DISCUSSION: These new records represent the second record of calliostomatids 
from vents (third from chemosynthetic ecosystems) and the third record of 
muricids from vents (tenth from chemosynthetic ecosystems), and extend the 
distribution of both species to the southwest. Neither family has been recorded 
at chemosynthetic ecosystems in the western Pacific. Both were from weakly 
diffuse flow areas not subject to high temperature venting but were nevertheless 
associated with typical vent-reliant taxa such as Lamellibrachia tubeworms and 
Bathymodiolus mussels. These new records show that these species are capable of 
tolerating environmental stress associated with weak hydrothermally influenced 
areas, despite not being vent endemic species, adding to the list of known 
vent/non-vent species intersections. This signifies that such weakly influenced 
areas may provide key habitats for them, and that such areas may play a role in 
the evolution of biological adaptations to 'extreme' chemosynthetic ecosystems.

Efficacy and Safety of Nintedanib for the Treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary 
Fibrosis: An Update.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a fatal form of progressive fibrosing 
interstitial pneumonia with limited treatment options. In recent years, its 
management has been transformed with the approval of two new antifibrotic drugs: 
nintedanib and pirfenidone. Nintedanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that 
efficiently slows idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis progression and has an 
acceptable tolerability profile. This article reviews new available evidence on 
the long-term efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis. Data from extension trials indicate that nintedanib 
continues to slow disease progression for up to 3 years and is similarly 
effective in patients with mild and severe impairment of lung function. 
Treatment with nintedanib reduces the risk of acute exacerbations, and a 
combined analysis of data from clinical trials of nintedanib shows a trend 
towards a reduction in mortality. Nintedanib is well tolerated and has been 
shown to be safe for up to 51 months. Gastrointestinal events, mainly diarrhoea, 
are the main adverse events caused by the treatment. Currently available data 
confirm its safety profile in real-life clinical settings, with no new safety 
concerns identified in patients with comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: Emerging preclinical evidence indicates statins, medications 
commonly used in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), inhibit 
proliferation, promote apoptosis and limit invasiveness of esophageal 
adenocarcinoma (EAC). Population-based observational data demonstrate statin 
treatment after diagnosis of EAC is associated with significant reductions in 
all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. A feasibility study of adjuvant statin 
therapy following potentially curative resection for EAC has been completed, 
with planned progression to a full phase III, randomized controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to estimate the cost-utility of statin therapy following 
surgical resection for EAC from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the costs and outcomes 
[quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] for hypothetical cohorts of patients with 
EAC exposed or not exposed to statins following potentially curative surgical 
resection. Model parameters were based on estimates from published observational 
and trial data. Costs, utilities and transition probabilities were modeled to 
reflect clinical practice from a payer's perspective. Probabilistic and one-way 
sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainty in key 
parameters.
RESULTS: Overall, a cost saving of £6781 per patient was realized with statin 
treatment compared to no statins. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 99% of 
all iterations were cost saving and 99% of all iterations were less than £20,000 
per QALY gained. These results were robust to changes in the price and 
effectiveness of statins.
CONCLUSIONS: The cohort exposed to statins had lower costs and better QALY 
outcomes than the no statin cohort. Assuming a causal improvement in disease 
outcomes following resection for EAC, statin therapy is very likely to be a 
cost-saving treatment.

Cost-efficient fenced reserves for conservation: single large or two small?

Helmstedt KJ, Possingham HP, Brennan KEC, Rhodes JR, Bode M.

Fences that exclude alien invasive species are used to reduce predation pressure 
on reintroduced threatened wildlife. Planning these continuously managed systems 
of reserves raises an important extension of the Single Large or Several Small 
(SLOSS) reserve planning framework: the added complexity of ongoing management. 
We investigate the long-term cost-efficiency of a single large or two small 
predator exclusion fences in the arid Australian context of reintroducing 
bilbies Macrotis lagotis, and we highlight the broader significance of our 
results with sensitivity analysis. A single fence more frequently results in a 
much larger net cost than two smaller fences. We find that the cost-efficiency 
of two fences is robust to strong demographic and environmental uncertainty, 
which can help managers to mitigate the risk of incurring high costs over the 
entire life of the project.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) is an endocrine disease of global 
proportions which is currently affecting 1 in 12 adults in the world, with still 
increasing prevalence. World Health Organization (WHO) declared this worldwide 
health problem, as an epidemic disease, to be the only non-infectious disease 
with such categorization. People with DMT2 are at increased risk of various 
complications and have shorter life expectancy. The main classes of oral 
antidiabetic drugs accessible today for DMT2 vary in their chemical composition, 
modes of action, safety profiles and tolerability.
METHODS: A systematic search of peer-reviewed scientific literature and public 
databases has been conducted. We included the most recent relevant research 
papers and data in respect to the focus of the present review. The quality of 
retrieved papers was assessed using standard tools.
RESULTS: The review highlights the chemical structural diversity of the 
molecules that have the common target-DMT2. So-called traditional antidiabetics 
as well as the newest and the least explored drugs include polypeptides and 
amino acid derivatives (insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1, dipeptidyl 
peptidase-IV inhibitors, amylin), sulfonylurea derivatives, benzylthiazolidine- 
2,4-diones (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ agonists/glitazones), 
condensed guanido core (metformin) and sugar-like molecules (α-glucosidase and 
sodium/ glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors).
CONCLUSION: As diabetes becomes a more common disease, interest in new 
pharmacological targets is on the rise.

Over a few decades a strong interlink between oxidative damage and cancer has 
been investigated by various scientists across the world on the basis of 
epidemiological observations of the effects of fruits and vegetables used in the 
diet for cancer patients. Primarily, Vitamin C, Vitamin D and Vitamin E are 
reported to be involved in the amelioration of side effects which occur in 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy of lungs, stomach, prostate, colorectal, 
gastric head and neck cancers. The vitamins acting as antioxidant adjuvants are 
found to have apoptotic and antiangiogenesis potential as well as inhibitory 
effects against metastasis in cancer cells. This chapter explicitly discusses 
the key aspects concerned with the vitamins in relation to cancer prevention and 
treatment. It describes vitamins and their natural resources, role of vitamins 
in the body, and vitamins as prime ingredients in the diet and their effects on 
cancer biology with reference to recent research reports. Moreover, this paper 
also includes the emerging potential of pharmaceutical advances to enhance 
bioavailability of the vitamins to cancer patients with improved safety and 
efficacy. Clinicians and researchers must mull over the nutritional requirements 
of individual cancer patient so as to treat cancer and increase life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To characterize the disability-related health burden of 
hearing loss (HL) at a global level, with a focus on socioeconomic health 
disparities.
METHODS: The global burden of HL, as calculated by disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) per 100,000 individuals, was evaluated for 184 countries. Data 
from 5-year intervals encompassing 1990 to 2015 were organized by human 
development index (HDI) categorizations as specified by the U.N. Development 
Program (UNDP). Gini coefficients and concentration indices were used to 
evaluate global inequality in HL burden over this time period.
RESULTS: There was a global lack of improvement in hearing loss burden over 25 
years. National HL burden, as measured by age-standardized DALYs, had an inverse 
relationship with successive level of development (p < 0.0001). Global 
inequalities in HL burden as measured by the concentration index decreased from 
1990 to 2005, remained stable between 2005 and 2010, and slightly increased from 
2010 to 2015. Central Sub-Saharan Africa, followed by Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa 
and South Asia, had the greatest rates of disease burden in 2015.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this analysis is the first to investigate 
socioeconomic-related inequalities in hearing loss burden using statistical 
tools such as the Gini coefficient and concentration index. Although 
inequalities have largely decreased in recent decades, the global burden of 
hearing loss remains high and there are recent signs of increased inequality. 
These data suggest that a greater distribution of hearing care resources may 
need to be directed towards developing countries to combat global hearing loss 
burden.

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder in which the mutation of the Cystis 
Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene that codes the protein 
forming a chloride channel of epithelial cells results in its distorted 
functioning. The manifestations of the disorder are mainly observed in the 
respiratory and digestive system. Accumulation of sticky and thick mucus is the 
dominant clinical symptom; it leads to chronic infections and gradual tissue 
destruction. Although cystic fibrosis remains incurable, it is currently 
feasible to extend patients' life expectancy thanks to modern therapy 
possibilities. As cystic fibrosis is no longer the domain of pediatricians, 
health care to CF patients needs to be provided by doctors of various 
specializations. The multidisciplinary team of doctors should include a dentist 
aware of specific prevention and treatment needs of this group of patients. It 
results from the fact that in the course of cystic fibrosis it is possible to 
observe a variety of changes in the oral cavity environment. The study presents 
dental issues observed in CF patients and reported in literature. Particular 
attention was paid to dental caries, mineralization disorders of hard dental 
tissues, gingivitis and the change in the content and properties of saliva; 
moreover, prevention and treatment options regarding oral cavity health is this 
group of patients were taken into consideration.

BACKGROUND: International comparisons of disease prevalence have been useful in 
understanding what proportion of disease might be preventable and in informing 
potential policy interventions in different cultural and economic contexts. 
Using newly available, harmonized data from 20 countries, we compare disability 
and morbidity of older adults between the ages of 55 and 74.
METHODS: The Gateway to Global Aging Data, a data and information portal, 
provides access to easy-to-use individual-level longitudinal data from 10 
surveys covering over 30 countries. Exploiting harmonized measures available 
from the Gateway, we descriptively examine how disability and morbidity differ 
across countries.
RESULTS: Significant cross-country differences are observed for several health 
indicators. Comparing countries with the highest and lowest prevalence rates, we 
observe that hypertension rates vary twofold and stroke rates vary threefold, 
while disability and arthritis rates vary more than fivefold. Among women, 
higher gross domestic product and life expectancy are related to lower diabetes, 
heart disease, and better functioning. Among men, national indicators of 
economic conditions are not significantly associated with reported disease 
prevalence.
CONCLUSIONS: We document substantial heterogeneity in disability and morbidity 
across countries, separately for men and women and after controlling for 
population age composition and education. Rich data from various surveys across 
the world offers remarkable opportunities for cross-country analyses, calling 
for further investigation of what drives observed differences. The Gateway to 
Global Aging Data provides easy-to-use harmonized data files and tools to 
facilitate this type of research.

Population ageing is a phenomenon affecting the whole world. The countries that 
make up the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are no exception but transitions in 
population ageing are still in the early stages of the process. With current 
demographic dividends experienced by the GCC and the rest of the Middle-East, 
the pace of population ageing will be faster than that experienced by many 
European countries. The purpose of this paper is to explore the population 
ageing experience of different GCC countries while situating this within a 
context of social policies that still at the very early stages of acknowledging 
such change. We utilise data from sources such as the United Nations and the 
World Bank, complemented by policy analysis of current age-related social 
security measures in the GCC. Given the importance of the family aged care 
system in the region, we consider the implications of changes in family 
structures, living conditions, and care needs for the elderly. The findings 
confirm the declining trend in fertility combined with increased life expectancy 
in all the six GCC countries. However, they highlight that social policy 
measures focused on the older generations and their care needs are still 
relatively at the early stages of each country's policy agenda. The implications 
of such changes are serious in term of both the demand for and supply of care. 
Policy-makers need to adapt cohesive social policy strategies that strengthen 
the complementing relationships between the state, family and wider community as 
stakeholders in the provision of aged care.

Psychotherapy for Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder: A 
Health Technology Assessment.

Health Quality Ontario.

Collaborators: McMartin K, Gajic-Veljanoski O, Wells D, Higgins C, Walter M.

BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are among 
the most commonly diagnosed mental illnesses in Canada; both are associated with 
a high societal and economic burden. Treatment for major depressive disorder and 
generalized anxiety disorder consists of pharmacological and psychological 
interventions. Three commonly used psychological interventions are cognitive 
behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy, and supportive therapy. The 
objectives of this report were to assess the effectiveness and safety of these 
types of therapy for the treatment of adults with major depressive disorder 
and/or generalized anxiety disorder, to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
structured psychotherapy (CBT or interpersonal therapy), to calculate the budget 
impact of publicly funding structured psychotherapy, and to gain a greater 
understanding of the experiences of people with major depressive disorder and/or 
generalized anxiety disorder.
METHODS: We performed a literature search on October 27, 2016, for systematic 
reviews that compared CBT, interpersonal therapy, or supportive therapy with 
usual care, waitlist control, or pharmacotherapy in adult outpatients with major 
depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder. We developed an 
individual-level state-transition probabilistic model for a cohort of adult 
outpatients aged 18 to 75 years with a primary diagnosis of major depressive 
disorder to determine the cost-effectiveness of individual or group CBT (as a 
representative form of structured psychotherapy) versus usual care. We also 
estimated the 5-year budget impact of publicly funding structured psychotherapy 
in Ontario. Finally, we interviewed people with major depressive disorder and/or
