BACKGROUND: Siltuximab is recommended by international consensus as a first-line 
treatment for idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease on the basis of durable 
efficacy and safety data. This study was done to assess the long-term safety and 
activity of siltuximab over up to 6 years of treatment.
METHODS: This study is a prespecified open-label extension analysis of a phase 1 
trial (NCT00412321) and a phase 2 trial (NCT01024036), done at 26 hospitals 
worldwide. Patients in both studies were at least 18 years old with 
histologically confirmed, symptomatic Castleman disease. This extension study 
enrolled 60 patients who completed the previous trials without disease 
progression on siltuximab. Patients received siltuximab infusions of 11 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks (which could be extended to 6 weeks) for up to 6 years. 
Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the data. No formal hypothesis 
testing was performed. The primary endpoint was the safety of siltuximab, 
assessed at each dosing cycle. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT01400503 and with EudraCT, number 2010-022837-27.
FINDINGS: Patient enrolment into the phase 1 trial was from June 20, 2005, to 
Sept 15, 2009, and enrolment into the phase 2 trial was from Feb 9, 2010, to Feb 
3, 2012. Patients were enrolled in this long-term extension from April 1, 2011, 
to Jan 15, 2014. Median follow-up was 6 years (IQR 5·11-7·76). Median treatment 
duration, from the beginning of the previous trials to the end of the present 
study, was 5·5 years (IQR 4·26-7·14). Siltuximab was well tolerated; however, 
adverse events of grade 3 or worse were reported in 36 (60%) of 60 patients with 
the most common being hypertension (eight [13%]), fatigue (five [8%]), nausea 
(four [7%]), neutropenia (four [7%]), and vomiting (three [5%]). 25 (42%) 
patients reported at least one serious adverse event, which most commonly was an 
infection (eight [13%]). Only two serious adverse events, polycythaemia and 
urinary retention, were considered related to siltuximab treatment. 18 patients 
discontinued before study completion, either to receive siltuximab locally 
(eight) or because of progressive disease (two), adverse events (two), or other 
reasons (six). No deaths were reported.
INTERPRETATION: These results show that siltuximab is well tolerated long term 
and provides important evidence for the feasibility of the life-long use 
required by patients with idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease.

University, Fuzhou, Fujian Province.

University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China.

OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis incorporating 
recent phase III clinical trial (IMpassion130) data to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel (AnP) 
against nab-paclitaxel alone as the first-line treatment for advanced 
triple-negative breast cancer in developed and developing countries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed using 
IMpassion130 data to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of AnP over a lifetime from 
the US health care payer and Chinese health care system perspective. Model 
inputs were derived from IMpassion130 and published literature. The primary 
outcomes of the model were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Uncertainty was addressed using univariate 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: For the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the projected mean outcome 
was better with AnP (1.41 QALYs) than with nab-paclitaxel alone (0.99 QALYs). 
Similar results were obtained for the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive 
population, with the obtained mean outcomes of 1.66 and 0.88 QALYs, 
respectively. For the Unites States, the ICER values comparing AnP with 
nab-paclitaxel were US$331,996.89 and US$229,359.88 per QALY gained for the ITT 
and PD-L1-positive populations, respectively. For China, the ICER values were 
US$106,339.26 and US$72,971.88 per QALY gained for the ITT and PD-L1-positive 
populations, respectively. The univariate sensitivity analysis indicated that 
the price of atezolizumab was the most influential factor in our study. AnP had 
0% cost-effectiveness at the willingness-to-pay thresholds of US$150,000/QALY in 
the United States and US$29,383/QALY in China.
CONCLUSION: AnP is not a cost-effective choice as the first-line treatment for 
advanced triple-negative breast cancer in the United States and China.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the burden of cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases 
caused by specific etiologies in China.
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016) were used. 
We evaluated the burden by analyzing age-sex-province-specific prevalence, 
mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of 33 provinces in China.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2016, prevalence cases in thousands increased by 73.7% 
from 6833.3 (95% UI: 6498.0-7180.6) to 11869.6 (95% UI: 11274.6-12504.7). 
Age-standardized mortality and DALY rates per 100,000 decreased by 51.2% and 
53.3%, respectively. Male and elderly people (aged ≥ 60 years) preponderance 
were found for prevalence, mortality, and DALYs. The number of prevalence cases, 
deaths, and DALYs due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) increased by 86.6%, 8.7%, and 
0.9%, respectively. Also, age-standardized prevalence rates decreased in 31 
provinces, but increased in Yunnan and Shandong. The Socio-demographic Index 
(SDI) values were negatively correlated with age-standardized mortality and DALY 
rates by provinces in 2016; the correlation coefficients were -0.817 and -0.828, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases remain a huge health 
burden in China, with the increase of population and the aging of population. 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains the leading cause of the health burden in China.

Archaeal translation initiation occurs within a macromolecular complex 
containing the small ribosomal subunit (30S) bound to mRNA, initiation factors 
aIF1, aIF1A and the ternary complex aIF2:GDPNP:Met-tRNAiMet. Here, we determine 
the cryo-EM structure of a 30S:mRNA:aIF1A:aIF2:GTP:Met-tRNAiMet complex from 
Pyrococcus abyssi at 3.2 Å resolution. It highlights archaeal features in 
ribosomal proteins and rRNA modifications. We find an aS21 protein, at the 
location of eS21 in eukaryotic ribosomes. Moreover, we identify an N-terminal 
extension of archaeal eL41 contacting the P site. We characterize 34 
N4-acetylcytidines distributed throughout 16S rRNA, likely contributing to 
hyperthermostability. Without aIF1, the 30S head is stabilized and initiator 
tRNA is tightly bound to the P site. A network of interactions involving tRNA, 
mRNA, rRNA modified nucleotides and C-terminal tails of uS9, uS13 and uS19 is 
observed. Universal features and domain-specific idiosyncrasies of translation 
initiation are discussed in light of ribosomal structures from representatives 
of each domain of life.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an untreatable and fatal 
neurodegenerative disease that is identified by the loss of motor neurons in the 
spinal cord, brain stem, and motor cortex which theatrically reduces life 
expectancy. Although the primary cause of ALS remains unclear, its heterogeneity 
put forward for consideration of association with various factors, including 
endogenous and/or environmental ones, which may be involved in progressive motor 
neuron stress that causes activation of different cell death pathways. It is 
hypothesized that this disease is triggered by factors related to genetic, 
environmental, and age-dependent risk. In spite of large neurobiological, 
molecular and genetic research, at the beginning of the 21st century, ALS still 
remains one of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases because of the 
lack of effective therapeutic targets. It is a challenge for the clinical and 
scientific community. A better understanding of the etiology of ALS is necessary 
to develop specific targets of this progressive neurodegenerative disease. This 
review states about the current knowledge of targets in ALS research. This 
review provides an overview of the contribution of different targets like 
mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate transport and excitotoxicity, protein 
accumulation, Oxidative stress, neuromuscular junction, microglia, and other 
molecular targets in the pathogenesis of ALS.

BACKGROUND: Plastic and reconstructive surgical teams visiting from Australia, a 
high-income country, have delivered cleft surgical services to Timor Leste since 
2000 on a volunteer basis. This paper aims to estimate the economic benefit of 
correcting cleft deformities in this new nation as it evolved its healthcare 
delivery service from independence in 1999.
METHODS: We have utilised a prospective database of all cleft surgical 
interventions performed during 44 plastic surgical missions over the last 
18 years. The disability-adjusted life year (DALY) framework was used to 
calculate the total DALYs averted by primary cleft lip and palate repair. The 
2004 global burden of disease disability weights were used. Economic benefits 
were calculated using the gross national income (GNI) and the value of a 
statistical life (VSL) methods for Timor Leste. Estimates were adjusted for 
treatment effectiveness, counterfactual cases, and complications. Cost estimates 
included the local hospitalisation costs, the foregone salaries of the visiting 
surgeons and nurses, other costs associated with providing surgical care, and an 
estimate for foregone wages of the patients or their carers. Sensitivity 
analysis was performed with income elasticity set to 0.55, 1.0, and 1.5.
RESULTS: During 44 visiting plastic surgical missions to Timor Leste, 1500 
procedures were performed, including 843 primary cleft lip and palate 
operations. The cleft procedures resulted in the aversion of 842 DALYs and an 
economic return to Timor Leste of USD 2.2 million (GNI-based) or USD 197,917 
(VSL-based). Our programme cost USD 705 per DALY averted. The economic return on 
investment was 0.3:1 (VSL-based) or 3.8:1 (GNI-based).
CONCLUSION: A sustained and consistent visiting team approach providing repair 
of cleft lip and palate defects has resulted in considerable economic gain for 
Timor Leste over an 18-year period. The training of a local surgeon and 
multidisciplinary team with ongoing support to the in-country cleft service is 
expected to reduce the cost per DALY averted once the surgeon and team are able 
to manage clefts independently.

The aging of society observed during the past century in industrialized 
countries has not only led to a longer life expectancy, but also an increased 
frequency of age-related diseases and multimorbidity. In addition to dysphagia 
and vertigo, sensory deficits such as olfaction and hearing disorders are common 
in elderly persons and have a significant influence on quality of life. 
Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. Epidemiological studies 
have recently shown that disorders of olfaction and hearing are not only 
associated with dementia, but also represent specific risk factors for 
development and progression of the disease. Recognition and adequate treatment, 
e.g., of hearing loss, by otorhinolaryngologists is thus assuming an 
increasingly important role, not only to preserve patients' quality of life, but 
also to reduce the risk of developing dementia in the future.

PURPOSE: Worldwide, Indigenous people often have disproportionally worse health 
and lower life expectancy than their non-Indigenous counterparts. Despite the 
impact of cancer on life expectancy, little is known about the burden of cancer 
for Indigenous people primarily because of the paucity of data. We investigated 
the collection and reporting of Indigenous status information among a global 
sample of population-based cancer registries (PBCRs).
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: An online survey was e-mailed to eligible registries 
using set inclusion criteria. Respondents were asked questions on the 
collection, reporting, and quality assessment of Indigenous status in their 
registers.
RESULTS: Eighty-three PBCRs from 25 countries were included. Of these, 66% 
reported that their registry collected Indigenous status data, although the 
quality of this variable had been assessed in less than half in terms of 
completeness (38%) and accuracy (47%). Two thirds of PBCRs who collected 
Indigenous status data (67%), from nine of 25 countries responded that cancer 
statistics for Indigenous people were reported using registry data. Key barriers 
to the collection of Indigenous status information included the lack of data 
collection at the point of care (79%), lack of transfer of Indigenous status to 
the cancer registry (46%), inadequate information systems (43%), and legislative 
limitations (32%). Important variations existed among world regions, although 
the lack of Indigenous status data collection at the point of care was commonly 
reported across all regions.
CONCLUSION: High-quality data collection is lacking for Indigenous peoples in 
many countries. To ensure the design and implementation of cancer control 
activities required to reduce disparities for Indigenous populations, health 
information systems, including cancer registries, need to be strengthened, and 
this must be done in dialogue with Indigenous leaders.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the safety and efficacy of up to 156 weeks of 
ixekizumab (an IL-17A antagonist) treatment in PsA patients.
METHODS: In a phase III study, patients naïve to biologic treatment were 
randomized to placebo, adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks (ADA; active reference) or 
ixekizumab 80 mg every 2 weeks (IXEQ2W) or every 4 weeks (IXEQ4W) after an 
initial dose of 160 mg. At week 24 (week 16 for inadequate responders), ADA 
(after 8-week washout) and placebo patients were re-randomized to IXEQ2W or 
IXEQ4W. Outcomes were evaluated using a modified non-responder imputation 
[linear extrapolation for radiographic progression (modified total Sharp 
score = 0)] during extended treatment until week 156.
RESULTS: Of 417 patients, 381 entered the extension, and 243 of 381 (63.8%) 
completed the 156-week study. Incidence rates of treatment-emergent and serious 
adverse events, respectively, were 38.0 and 5.2 with IXEQ2W (n = 189) and 38.1 
and 8.0 with IXEQ4W (n = 197). One death occurred (IXEQ4W). With IXEQ2W and 
IXEQ4W, respectively, the response rates persisted to week 156 as measured by 
the ACR response ≥20% (62.5 and 69.8%), ≥50% (56.1 and 51.8%) and ≥70% (43.8 and 
33.4%), psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) 75 (69.1 and 63.5%), PASI 90 
(64.5 and 51.2%) and PASI 100 (60.5 and 43.6%). Inhibition of radiographic 
progression also persisted to week 156 in 61% of IXEQ2W and 71% of IXEQ4W 
patients.
CONCLUSION: In this 156-week study of ixekizumab, the safety profile remained 
consistent with previous reports, and improvements in signs and symptoms of PsA 
were observed, including persistent low rates of radiographic progression.

Surgical Reconstruction of the Acetabulum and Pelvis in Metastatic Bone Disease.

DiCaprio M, Ippolito JA, Benevenia J.

Management of a painful metastatic acetabular lesion is complex and requires the 
assessment of tumor size and location, remaining integrity of the acetabulum, 
analgesic requirements, ability to use postoperative radiation, and projected 
patient survival. Patients presenting with suspected periacetabular metastasis 
frequently have groin pain aggravated by weight bearing. After a complete 
physical examination, advanced imaging and a complete laboratory workup should 
be performed to assess the extent of local and systemic disease. If a patient 
has a previously identified metastatic lesion, it is beneficial to communicate 
with the patient's medical oncologist to gather information on responses to 
chemotherapeutic agents, hormonal agents, and radiation therapy. Management may 
be nonsurgical, interventional, or surgical. Despite the limited life expectancy 
of patients with periacetabular metastasis, when performed in the appropriate 
setting, reconstruction by using anti-protrusio cages, screws, and cemented hip 
arthroplasty can improve quality of life by aiding independent ambulation and 
decreasing pain.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that regular dental visits can affect 
the relationship of tooth loss with mortality and functional disability. 
However, the independent association between regular dental visits and incident 
functional disability is unclear.
METHODS: Our study participants were community-dwelling individuals aged ≥65 
years, without disability at baseline. The outcome was the level of incident 
functional disability, as defined in a new certification of the public long-term 
care insurance. We defined no disability as no certiﬁcation at follow-up, mild 
disability as support levels 1-2 and care level 1 (i.e., independent in basic 
ADL, but requiring some help in daily activities), and severe disability as care 
levels 2-5 (i.e., dependent in basic ADL). The exposure variable, based on the 
questionnaire, was regular dental visits at baseline. Covariates included 
gender, age, socio-economic status, health status, lifestyle habits, physical 
and mental functioning, and oral health variables. Using multinomial logistic 
regression, we calculated adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95 % confidence interval 
(CI) for mild disability and severe disability, with no disability as a 
reference category.
RESULTS: Among 8,877 participants, the 33-month cumulative incidence of mild and 
severe disability was 6.0 % and 1.8 %, respectively. After controlling for all 
covariates, regular dental visits at baseline were significantly associated with 
a lower risk of incident severe disability (aOR 0.65; 95 % CI, 0.46-0.91) but 
not the incidence of mild disability (aOR 0.96; 95 % CI, 0.79-1.17).
CONCLUSIONS: Encouraging dental visits may contribute to prevention of severe 
functional disability and extension of healthy life expectancy among 
community-dwelling older adults.

Background: Massive irreparable posterosuperior rotator cuff tears may result in 
the loss of external rotation. Most of the patients with posterosuperior rotator 
cuff tears suffer from a restriction in their daily life actions. Latissimus 
dorsi tendon transfer (LDTT) is a method to restore abduction and external 
rotation in these patients. However, the behavior of the LD after the transfer 
is not clear yet. Few studies have analyzed the activity of the LD after 
transfer. The goal of this study was to examine the function of the LD 
postoperatively in follow-up examinations during activities of daily life (ADLs) 
and during different movements evaluated by measuring the range of motion (ROM). 
Methods: We examined 12 patients 4.3 years (1-9 years) after LDTT, using 
simultaneous 3D motion analysis and surface Electromyography (sEMG) of 12 muscle 
parts; the opposite, nonaffected side was assessed as a control. The measurement 
protocol included two standardized movements (exorotation with an adducted arm 
and exorotation with 90° abduction) as well as two ADLs (combing hair and 
perineal care). Results: An average of 4.3 years (1-9 years) after LDTT, 9 of 
the 12 subjects showed EMG activity in the transferred LD during glenohumeral 
external rotation. During the endorotation phase, either little activity was 
registered or only the pectoralis major was active. During the ADLs, 6 out of 12 
subjects showed EMG activity in the transferred LD while "combing hair", whereas 
all subjects showed EMG activity during perineal care. Conclusion: The LD showed 
partial activity in its new role as an exorotator, but no clear difference was 
observed between some of the movements as well as in comparison with the healthy 
shoulder. Further studies will need to be conducted to better differentiate 
voluntary contractions and co-contractions as well as tension and extension in 
the muscle.

BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is highly prevalent in the Cote 
d'Ivoire and has severe health and economic consequences. In this paper, we 
apply a health economic model to quantify the burden of IDA, and the 
contribution of nationwide mandatory iron fortification of wheat flour and 
voluntary iron fortification of condiments to the reduction of this burden.
METHODS: The analysis for the population from 6 months to 64 years builds on 
published reviews and publicly available datasets and is stratified by 
age-groups and socioeconomic strata using comparative risk assessment model.
RESULTS: Without the impact of these fortification strategies, the annual burden 
of IDA is estimated at 242,100 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and 978.1 
million USD. Wheat flour and condiment fortification contributed to a reduction 
of the IDA burden by approximately 5% each.
CONCLUSION: In places with high prevalence of malaria and other infectious 
diseases, such as the Côte D'Ivoire, food fortification as a nutritional 
intervention should be accompanied with infectious disease prevention and 
control. The findings of this study provide additional input for policy makers 
about the magnitude of the impact and can support the conception of future 
fortification strategies.

OBJECTIVES: Improving outcomes for older people with long-term conditions and 
multimorbidity is a priority. Current policy commits to substantial expansion of 
social prescribing to community assets, such as charity, voluntary or community 
groups. We use longitudinal data to add to the limited evidence on whether this 
is associated with better quality of life or lower costs of care.
DESIGN: Prospective 18-month cohort survey of self-reported participation in 
community assets and quality of life linked to administrative care records. 
Effects of starting and stopping participation estimated using double-robust 
estimation.
SETTING: Participation in community asset facilities. Costs of primary and 
secondary care.
PARTICIPANTS: 4377 older people with long-term conditions.
INTERVENTION: Participation in community assets.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
healthcare costs and social value estimated using net benefits.
RESULTS: Starting to participate in community assets was associated with a 0.017 
(95% CI 0.002 to 0.032) gain in QALYs after 6 months, 0.030 (95% CI 0.005 to 
0.054) after 12 months and 0.056 (95% CI 0.017 to 0.094) after 18 months. 
Cumulative effects on care costs were negative in each time period: £-96 (95% CI 
£-512 to £321) at 6 months; £-283 (95% CI £-926 to £359) at 12 months; and £-453 
(95% CI £-1366 to £461) at 18 months. The net benefit of starting to participate 
was £1956 (95% CI £209 to £3703) per participant at 18 months. Stopping 
participation was associated with larger negative impacts of -0.102 (95% CI 
-0.173 to -0.031) QALYs and £1335.33 (95% CI £112.85 to £2557.81) higher costs 
after 18 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Participation in community assets by older people with long-term 
conditions is associated with improved quality of life and reduced costs of 
care. Sustaining that participation is important because there are considerable 
health changes associated with stopping. The results support the inclusion of 
community assets as part of an integrated care model for older patients.

Malfunctions in implanted pacemaker and defibrillator systems can affect all 
components of the device (battery, capacitor, central processing unit (CPU), 
connector, soldering points, electrodes). The resulting problems can manifest 
themselves as inadequate therapy, a lack of therapy despite the need for 
stimulation or shock release in case of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, or as an 
ineffective delivery of therapy. The high number of implanted pacemaker and 
defibrillator systems, the increased life expectancy and the technical progress 
of cardiac "device" therapy mean that the treating physician is confronted with 
increasingly complex problems in the follow-up. In addition to the knowledge of 
the basic function of these devices, a structured procedure to detect and treat 
malfunctions in a timely manner is required. In this review, frequent 
malfunctions of pacemaker and defibrillators are presented, individual problems 
are pointed out, and solutions and treatment options are shown.

INTRODUCTION: Voretigene neparvovec (VN) is a gene therapy and the first 
approved pharmacological treatment for biallelic RPE65-mediated inherited 
retinal dystrophies (IRD), a rare condition that starts in early life and causes 
vision to progressively deteriorate towards complete blindness. In a phase III 
trial, treatment with VN significantly improved functional vision and visual 
function, and in October 2019 the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) Highly Specialised Technologies (HST) process recommended VN 
for patients in England and Wales. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of VN 
compared with best supportive care (BSC) in individuals with biallelic 
RPE65-mediated IRD in the UK.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for VN compared with BSC, from the 
perspective of the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services. 
Phase III trial data were used to inform transition probabilities up to year 1, 
after which the treatment effect was assumed to be maintained for 40 years, 
followed by a decline in vision. A bespoke elicitation exercise involving 
clinical experts, patients and carers was conducted to estimate utility values 
for each model health state.
RESULTS: At list price, VN is associated with incremental costs of £612,404 and 
incremental QALYs of 6.4, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of £95,072 per QALY gained. Voretigene neparvovec is associated with a 
significant undiscounted QALY gain (20.5) and is therefore eligible for 
additional QALY weighting under the NICE HST process; an ICER of up to £205,000 
per QALY gained could be considered cost-effective under this framework.
CONCLUSION: The results of the model show VN to be a cost-effective use of 
healthcare resources in the UK at list price. The availability of a commercial 
discount in the UK (as considered in the NICE appraisal) means that in reality 
the ICER will be even lower. Plain language summary available for this article.

As longevity has increased for people living with HIV (PLWH) in the United 
States and Europe, there has been a concomitant increase in the prevalence of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and morbidity in this population. 
Whereas the availability of HIV antiretroviral therapy has resulted in dramatic 
increases in life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where over two thirds 
of PLWH reside, if and how these trends impact the epidemiology of CVD is less 
clear. In this review, we describe the current state of the science on how both 
HIV and its treatment impact CVD risk factors and outcomes among PLWH in 
sub-Saharan Africa, including regional factors (unique to SSA) likely to 
differentiate these relationships from the global North. We then outline how 
current regional guidelines address CVD prevention among PLWH and which clinical 
and structural interventions are best poised to confront the co-epidemics of HIV 
and CVD in the region. We conclude with a discussion of key research gaps that 
need to be addressed to optimally develop an actionable public health response.

PURPOSE: The decreased life expectancy of MEN-1 patients is mainly related to 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs). At best, limited data is available on 
the natural history of MEN-1-associated pNETs, as these tumors are rare and have 
a wide range of biologic behavior. Our study aims to explore the clinical course 
of patients with MEN-1-associated pNETs and the long-term outcomes.
METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted on the MEN-1 cohort treated at 
our referral center over a 22-year period (1996-2018). Relevant clinical data 
were retrospectively analysed.
RESULTS: Among the 33 MEN-1 patients included in our study, pNETs were 
identified in 21 subjects with a penetrance of 48% by the age of 50. 
Non-functioning and functioning pNETs were diagnosed in sixteen (76%) and five 
(24%) patients, respectively. Two-thirds of the patients had multifocal tumors. 
The median number of pancreatic macroscopic lesions per individual was 4.0 ± 3.9 
(range 1-8) with a mean size of 1.3 ± 2.1 cm (range 0.5-10). The metastatic rate 
according to the dominant pNET lesion reached 100%, 62% and 6% for tumors 
sized > 4 cm, 2.1-4 cm, and 1-2 cm, respectively. Over the study period, one or 
more therapeutic interventions for pNETs were required in 20 out of the 21 
patients. pNET-related metastatic complication was the main cause of death 
within this MEN-1 cohort. The overall survival rate for the pNETs patients was 
86% during a mean follow-up period of 8.0 ± 4.6 years.
CONCLUSIONS: In our MEN-1 cohort, non-functioning pNETs were the most frequent 
type of pancreaticoduodenal tumor, and the tumor size correlated with the risks 
of metastasis and death. Increased awareness, early diagnosis, and a 
multidisciplinary approach may improve the associated morbidity and mortality in 
these patients.

One of the most important causes of the high mortality rate and low life 
expectancy of lung cancer is the detection at advanced stages. Thus, there is an 
urgent need for early diagnosis and the search of new selective biomarkers. 
Selenium is an important constituent of selenoproteins and a powerful 
antioxidant able to protect against cancer. In this work, the absolute 
quantification of selenium in selenoproteins and the total content in 
selenometabolites has been performed for the first time in serum from lung 
cancer patients (LC) and healthy controls (HC). To this end, a method for the 
simultaneous speciation of selenoproteins using size exclusion chromatography 
(SEC) and affinity chromatography (AF) with detection by ICP-QQQ-MS, and 
quantification by isotopic dilution (IDA) (SEC-AF-HPLC-SUID-ICP-QQQ-MS) was 
developed to determine the selenium concentration in eGPx, SEPP1 and SeAlb, as 
well as total selenometabolites, to find alterations that may serve as 
biomarkers of this disease. In the same way, a method based on anion-exchange 
chromatography coupled to ICP-QQQ-MS was developed to quantify selenometabolites 
(SeCys2, SeMeSeCys, SeMet, selenite and selenate) in the same LC and HC serum 
samples. The results showed that the averaged concentrations of selenium in 
eGPx, SeAlb and selenite were significantly higher in LC patients (LC (eGPx: 
21.24 ± 0.77 ng g-1; SeAlb: 49.56 ± 3.16 ng g-1 and Se(IV): 6.20 ± 1.22 ng g-1) 
than in HC group (eGPx: 16.96 ± 0.53 ng g-1; SeAlb: 38.33 ± 2.66 ng g-1 and 
Se(IV): 3.56 ± 0.55 ng g-1). In addition, the ratios between selenoproteins and 
selenometabolites have been calculated for the first to study their potential 
use as LC biomarkers. The rates eGPx/SEPP1, SEPP1/SeAlb, eGPx/Se(IV) and 
SEPP1/Se(IV) were significantly different between LC and HC groups.

Pediatric Hematologists Report Infrequent Prognosis Discussions in the Routine 
Care of Children with Sickle Cell Disease.

Pecker LH, Silver EJ, Roth M, Manwani D.

A large proportion of the morbidity and almost all of the mortality of sickle 
cell disease (SCD) now occurs in adulthood. Children with SCD underuse 
disease-modifying and curative treatments, in part because of how 
patients/parents understand SCD morbidity and mortality. Whether practitioners 
provide prognostic information to families is unknown. We emailed a 31-item 
survey to 1,149 pediatric hematologist-oncologists and analyzed 96 responses. 
Most said discussing prognosis would change patient/parent willingness to start 
hydroxyurea, but fewer actually discuss prognosis when they want to start 
hydroxyurea (91% vs. 75%, p=.001). Similarly, most said discussing prognosis 
would change adherence to therapy, but fewer actually discuss prognosis to 
motivate adherence (78% vs 31%, p&lt;.001). Most (77%) addressed prognosis when 
the "patient or their parent bring it up." Respondents reporting frequent life 
expectancy discussions were more likely to report a pathway for such discussions 
(p=.017). Pediatric hematologists may not conduct prognostic discussions without 
prompting, although these conversations may be important for shared, informed 
decision-making.

BACKGROUND: older workers experiencing chronic health conditions (CHCs) are more 
likely to retire early. The different pathways through which CHCs stimulate 
retirement preferences, however, remain largely unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: we present a more comprehensive model in which we test the different 
pathways through which four specific CHCs-arthritis, cardiovascular disease, 
sleep disorders and psychological disorders-influence early retirement
