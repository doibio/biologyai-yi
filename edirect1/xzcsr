OBJECTIVE: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an important clinical event with an 
increased frequency due to increased life expectancy, obesity, and alcohol use. 
There are some data about the elevation of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 levels 
in benign and malignant pancreaticobiliary events in the literature, but in AP 
they are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the CA 19-9 level in 
patients with AP and determine its relationship according to the cause.
METHODS: Between 2010-2018, 173 patients evaluated with CA 19-9 levels as well 
as by standard laboratory tests were included in the study. CA 1 9-9 levels and 
laboratory findings were compared in patients with pancreatitis due to gallstone 
(group 1) and metabolic/toxic reasons such as hyperlipidemia, alcohol, or drug 
use (group 2).
RESULTS: There were 114 (66%) patients in the group 1 and 59 (34%) patients in 
the group 2. The majority of patients with high CA 19-9 level were in group 1 
(92.1% vs 6.8%). CA 19-9 level, as well as amylase, lipase, AST, ALT and 
bilirubin levels were found to be statistically higher in patients with AP due 
to gallstone compared to patients with metabolic/toxic AP.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AP due to gallstone, were found to have a high level 
of CA 19-9 at admission. Early stage CA 19-9 levels may contribute to standard 
laboratory tests in the etiology of the disease in patients diagnosed with AP.

The scope of this paper was to analyze the trends, impact on life expectancy and 
effect of the main associated socioeconomic factors with the death rate by 
homicide in Colombia between 2000 and 2014 at the state level, by gender and age 
groups. Standardized mortality rates and years of life lost among those under 85 
years of age were calculated and multivariate regression analysis was performed 
using negative binomial fixed effects regression models with panel data to 
analyze the associated socioeconomic factors with the incidence of homicide. The 
reduction of the death rate by homicide in Colombia was corroborated, which was 
generalized at state level, though it did not occur homogenously. A higher 
mortality risk was found among males, particularly between 15 and 49 years of 
age. Economic growth and inequality were negatively associated with death rates 
by homicide; unemployment was positively associated; and poverty had no effect 
on the mortality rate. Investigating the main associated factors with homicidal 
violence is complex, but is indispensable due to its impact on economic and 
social development, given that it mainly affects the population of productive 
age, with broad public health consequences and at a high cost to healthcare 
services.

Publisher: El objetivo fue analizar la tendencia, impacto en la esperanza de 
vida y efecto de los principales factores socioeconómicos asociados con la 
mortalidad por homicidios en Colombia entre 2000-2014 a nivel departamental, por 
sexo y grupos de edad. Se calcularon tasas estandarizadas de mortalidad, años de 
vida perdidos en menores de 85 años de edad y un análisis de regresión múltiple, 
ocupando modelos de regresión binomial negativa de datos panel de efectos fijos 
para analizar los factores socioeconómicos asociados con la incidencia de 
homicidios. Se corroboró la disminución de la mortalidad por homicidios en 
Colombia, la cual se dio de forma generalizada a nivel departamental, pero no 
fue homogénea. Se observó un mayor riesgo de fallecer en hombres de 15-49 años 
de edad. El crecimiento económico y la desigualdad se asociaron negativamente 
con la tasa de homicidios; el desempleo lo hizo de manera positiva; y la pobreza 
no tuvo un efecto significativo. Investigar los factores asociados con la 
violencia homicida es complejo, pero indispensable debido al impacto que tiene 
en el desarrollo económico y social, ya que afecta mayormente a la población en 
edades productivas, con amplias consecuencias en salud pública y altos costos de 
atención de los servicios de salud.

Background: People with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a life expectancy of <50 
years, so understanding their end-of-life care is critical. Objective: We aimed 
to determine where individuals with SCD were dying and their patterns of care in 
the year preceding death to highlight end-of-life research priorities and 
possible opportunities for intervention. Design: Using the California SCD Data 
Collection Program database (containing administrative data, vital records, and 
Medicaid claims), we examined people with SCD who died between 2006 and 2015 
(cases) at age <80 years and examined their hospital and emergency department 
(ED) utilization in their last year of life. Comparators included living 
controls with SCD matched 1:1 based on age, analysis year, insurance, and 
income. Results: We identified 486 people with SCD (cases) who died at a median 
age of 45 years (SD: 16 years). Most died in the hospital (63%) and ED (15%). In 
their last year of life, people with SCD were hospitalized for an average of 42 
days (SD: 49 days) over five admissions. Inpatient admissions and ED visits were 
stable throughout the year until the month before death when acute care 
utilization sharply increased. In their last year of life, cases had more 
hospitalizations than controls, but similar ED utilization. Conclusions: People 
with SCD are dying acutely at a young age and most die in the hospital and the 
ED. Since clinicians caring for people with SCD currently cannot predict which 
acute events may be life-threatening, a comprehensive palliative approach to 
people with SCD must extend beyond chronic pain management and psychosocial 
support to include advance care planning.

Background: Project ECHO™ (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) is a 
form of online interactive teaching, which has gained international traction. 
This project evaluates the effectiveness of an ECHO-delivered palliative care 
education program for the South Dublin region of Ireland. Our aim was to measure 
project success by quantifying gains in staff confidence. Methods: The 
educational program consisted of 10 interactive sessions over a five-month 
period on palliative care topics ranging from pain management to advance care 
planning. Twenty nursing homes took part in the education program. Of these, a 
subgroup of six nursing homes were randomly selected for assessment. Likert 
scale-based questionnaires assessed staff confidence before and after each 
lecture and assessment was repeated at least six weeks postlecture. Five of the 
10 sessions were assessed in this way. Other characteristics such as staff role 
and years of experience were also collected. Results: Twenty nursing homes and 
353 staff participated in the education sessions. Of the 6 nursing homes chosen 
for assessment, an average of 42 questionnaires were returned per session 
(n = 211), representing 83% of attendees at these 6 selected nursing homes. 
Seventy-seven percent of questionnaires were successfully followed up for six 
weeks. Average confidence increased by 27% pre- to postlecture (6.4 [SD = 1.4] 
to 8.1 [SD = 2.1], p < 0.005). Confidence gains persisted at six weeks; 8.1 of 
10 (SD = 1.4), with no significant drop-off (-0.01/10, p = 0.95). All staff 
groups (nursing vs. non-nursing) exhibited equal confidence gains (nursing gain 
of 27%, non-nursing gain 22%, p = 0.16), and all confidence gains persisted at 
six weeks. Conclusion: This interactive, novel, training program significantly 
improved nursing home staff confidence in managing palliative care situations, 
and this confidence was sustained at least six weeks after the sessions.

INTRODUCTION: Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAS) is a highly 
prevalent disease with serious consequences for the patients' lives. The 
treatment of the condition is mandatory for the improvement of the quality of 
life, as well as the life expectancy of the affected individuals. The most 
frequent treatments provided by dentistry are mandibular advancement devices 
(MAD) and orthognathic surgery with maxillomandibular advancement (MMA). This is 
possibly the only treatment option which offers high probability of cure.
OBJECTIVE: The present article provides a narrative review of OSAS from the 
perspective of 25 years of OSAS treatment clinical experience.
CONCLUSION: MADs are a solid treatment option for primary snoring and mild or 
moderate OSAS. Patients with severe apnea who are non-adherent to CPAP may also 
be treated with MADs. Maxillomandibular advancement surgery is a safe and very 
effective treatment option to OSAS.

INTRODUÇÃO: a Síndrome da Apneia e Hipopneia Obstrutiva do Sono (SAOS) é uma 
doença muito prevalente e que traz importantes consequências para a vida dos 
seus portadores. O tratamento da condição é relevante para a melhora do 
bem-estar geral e da expectativa de vida dos afetados. Os tratamentos 
odontológicos mais frequentes para a SAOS são os dispositivos de avanço 
mandibular (DAMs) e a cirurgia ortognática de avanço maxilomandibular (AMM) - 
essa última, possivelmente, é a única opção de tratamento com alta probabilidade 
de cura do problema.
OBJETIVO: o presente artigo faz uma revisão narrativa da SAOS sob a perspectiva 
de 25 anos de experiência clínica no tratamento da doença.
CONCLUSÃO: os DAMs são uma sólida opção de tratamento para o ronco primário e 
apneias leves ou moderadas. Apneias graves, em pacientes que não se adaptam ou 
se recusam a usar o CPAP, também podem ser tratadas com os DAMs. A cirurgia 
ortognática de AMM é uma alternativa segura e muito eficaz de solução da SAOS.

AIM: For many European countries, including Germany, no valid estimates are 
available on age at diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes. Thus, we aimed to estimate the 
age at diagnosis in Germany.
METHODS: Age at diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes in Germany was estimated based on 
Type 2 diabetes prevalence and incidence and the age distribution of the German 
population. Age- and sex-specific incidence and prevalence in 2014/2015, based 
on claims data from statutory health insurance (n= 69 000 000, ~85% of the 
German population), and the age pyramid for Germany in 2015 were used for the 
calculation. Age at Type 2 diabetes diagnosis was stratified by sex. CIs were 
estimated using bootstrap methods. In addition, the age range in which 50% of 
the population received a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes was calculated (the 
interquartile range).
RESULTS: The mean ± sd age at Type 2 diabetes diagnosis in 2015 was 61.0 ± 13.4 
years (95% CI 60.9-61.0) in men. Women were diagnosed ~2 years later than men 
(mean age 63.4 ± 14.9 years; 95% CI 63.4-63.5). The age range in which 50% of 
the population was diagnosed with diabetes was 53-72 years for men and 54-76 
years for women.
CONCLUSIONS: The sex differences are mainly attributable to a higher incidence 
of Type 2 diabetes in men than women during middle age and the higher absolute 
number of women in the older ages. The early age at diabetes diagnosis compared 
to average life expectancy means that the risk of diabetes-related complications 
is increased.

Period life expectancy is one of the most used summary indicators for the 
overall health of a population. Its levels and trends direct health policies, 
and researchers try to identify the determining risk factors to assess and 
forecast future developments. The use of period life expectancy is often based 
on the assumption that it directly reflects the mortality conditions of a 
certain year. Accordingly, the explanation for changes in life expectancy are 
typically sought in factors that have an immediate impact on current mortality 
conditions. It is frequently overlooked, however, that this indicator can also 
be affected by at least three kinds of effects, in particular in the situation 
of short-term fluctuations: cohort effects, heterogeneity effects, and tempo 
effects. We demonstrate their possible impact with the example of the almost 
Europe-wide decrease in life expectancy in 2015, which caused a series of 
reports about an upsurge of a health crisis, and we show that the consideration 
of these effects can lead to different conclusions. Therefore, we want to raise 
an awareness concerning the sensitivity of life expectancy to sudden changes and 
the menaces a misled interpretation of this indicator can cause.

Cladocerans are constantly exposed to humic substances in nature, yet the 
effects of these substances on their survival and reproduction are not well 
known. Here, the effects of humic substances (20 and 40 mg L-1) (HS) on the life 
history variables of three common cladocerans, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Moina 
macrocopa, and Daphnia pulex were evaluated. The results showed that the effect 
of humic substances on the tested cladocerans is species-specific, affecting 
either survival, reproduction or both. For M. macrocopa, exposed to HS at a 
concentration of 40 mg L-1, the average lifespan and the life expectancy at 
birth were significantly reduced as compared to controls, but for C. dubia and 
D. pulex these parameters were increased. Gross reproductive rate was unaffected 
by the HS level for both D. pulex and M. macrocopa, but it was significantly 
higher for C. dubia. When compared to the corresponding controls, for HS-exposed 
cladocerans, the rate of population increase was significantly reduced in case 
of D. pulex while it was stimulated for both C. dubia and M. macrocopa. It 
appears that humic substances had a slightly stronger influence on survivorship 
than on reproduction of the tested cladocerans.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze breast cancer mortality trends in Brazilian municipalities 
and assess the influence of socioeconomic and demographic factors on mortality 
rates.
METHODS: Age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated for the periods centered 
in 1990, 2000, and 2010 and corrected for ill-defined causes of death. After 
that, panel data regression models were developed for analysis of the 
association between the factors of interest and the mortality rate from breast 
cancer in Brazilian municipalities.
RESULTS: A growing trend was detected in breast cancer mortality in Brazil. 
However, the models showed that the mortality could have decreased (negative 
trend), especially in the Southeast and South regions, if some associated 
factors (such as income, education, longevity, fertility rate, health spending, 
and infrastructure, among others) had remained constant during the study period. 
Breast cancer mortality was positively/significantly associated with longevity 
and negatively/significantly associated with public health spending. Mortality 
was higher in the South and Southeast, in municipalities with more than 500 000 
inhabitants and in those with population below 5 000.
CONCLUSIONS: The growth in per capita income, the increase in life expectancy, 
and the decrease in fertility rates may be associated with high breast cancer 
mortality and a trend towards increased mortality from this cancer in Brazilian 
municipalities.

OBJETIVO. Analisar o comportamento da mortalidade por câncer de mama nos 
municípios brasileiros e avaliar a influência de fatores socioeconômicos e 
demográficos sobre as taxas e mortalidade.
MÉTODOS. Foram calculadas taxas de mortalidade, padronizadas por faixa etária e 
corrigidas por causas mal definidas, centradas em 1990, 2000 e 2010. 
Posteriormente, foram estimados modelos de regressão, com dados em painel, que 
permitiram verificar o grau de associação entre os fatores de interesse e a taxa 
de mortalidade pela doença.
RESULTADOS. Verificou-se uma tendência de crescimento da mortalidade no país. 
Contudo, os modelos indicaram que a mortalidade poderia ter diminuído (tendência 
negativa), principalmente no Sudeste e Sul, caso alguns fatores associados à 
doença (por exemplo, nível de renda, educação, longevidade, taxa de fecundidade, 
gastos em saúde, infraestrutura, entre outros) tivessem permanecido constantes 
durante o período considerado. Observou-se que a mortalidade por câncer de mama 
apresentou associação positiva/significativa com a longevidade e 
negativa/significativa com o nível de gastos públicos em saúde. A mortalidade 
foi maior nas regiões Sul e Sudeste, nos municípios com mais de 500 000 
habitantes e naqueles onde a população é inferior a 5 000.
CONCLUSÕES. O crescimento da renda per capita, a elevação da expectativa de vida 
e a diminuição da taxa de fecundidade podem estar associados a elevadas taxas de 
mortalidade por câncer de mama e a uma tendência de crescimento na mortalidade 
por esse câncer nos municípios brasileiros.

MÉTODOS: Se calcularon las tasas de mortalidad, ajustadas por grupo etario y 
corregidas por causas mal definidas, para los años 1990, 2000 y 2010. 
Posteriormente, se calcularon modelos de regresión, a partir de datos de panel, 
que permitieron verificar el grado de asociación entre distintos factores de 
interés y la tasa de mortalidad por esta enfermedad.
RESULTADOS: Se verificó que había una tendencia al aumento de la mortalidad en 
el país. Sin embargo, los modelos indicaron que la mortalidad podría haber 
disminuido (tendencia negativa), principalmente en el sudeste y el sur, si 
algunos factores asociados (por ejemplo, nivel de ingresos, educación, 
longevidad, tasa de fecundidad, gastos en salud, infraestructura, entre otros) 
hubieran permanecido constantes durante el período en estudio. Se observó que la 
mortalidad por cáncer de mama presentó una asociación positiva y significativa 
con la longevidad, y negativa y significativa con el nivel del gasto público en 
salud. La mortalidad fue mayor en las zonas sur y sudeste, en los municipios con 
más de 500 000 habitantes y en aquellos cuya población es inferior a 5000.
CONCLUSIONES: El aumento de los ingresos per cápita, el incremento de la 
esperanza de vida y la disminución de la tasa de fecundidad pueden estar 
asociados a tasas altas de mortalidad por cáncer de mama y a una tendencia al 
aumento de dicha mortalidad en los municipios brasileños.

Peptides and small protein scaffolds are gaining increasing interest as 
therapeutics. Similarly to full-length antibodies, they can bind a target with a 
high binding affinity and specificity while remaining small enough to diffuse 
into tissues. However, despite their numerous advantages, small biotherapeutics 
often suffer from a relatively short circulating half-life, thus requiring 
frequent applications that ultimately restrict their ease of use and user 
compliance. To overcome this limitation, a large variety of half-life extension 
strategies have been developed in the last decades. Linkage to ligands that 
non-covalently bind to albumin, the most abundant serum protein with a 
circulating half-life of ∼19 days in humans, represents one of the most 
successful approaches for the generation of long-lasting biotherapeutics with 
improved pharmacokinetic properties and superior efficacy in the clinic.

A 2D analysis of correlations between the parameters of the Gompertz-Makeham 
model (or law?) of relationships between aging, mortality, and longevity.

When mortality (μ), aging rate (γ) and age (t) are treated according to the 
Gompertz model μ(t) = μ0eγt (GM), any mean age corresponds to a manifold of 
paired reciprocally changing μ0 and γ. Therefore, any noisiness of data used to 
derive GM parameters makes them negatively correlated. Besides this artifactual 
factor of the Strehler-Mildvan correlation (SMC), other factors emerge when the 
age-independent mortality C modifies survival according to the Gompertz-Makeham 
model μ(t) = C+μ0eγt (GMM), or body resources are partitioned between survival 
and protection from aging [the compensation effect of mortality (CEM)]. 
Theoretical curves in (γ, logμ0) coordinates show how μ0 decreases when γ 
increases upon a constant mean age. Within a species-specific range of γ, such 
"isoage" curves look as nearly parallel straight lines. The slopes of lines 
constructed by applying GM to survival curves modeled according to GMM upon 
changes in C are greater than the isoage slopes. When CEM is modeled, the slopes 
are still greater. Based on these observations, CEM is shown to contribute to 
SMC associated with sex differences in lifespan, with the effects of several 
life-extending drugs, and with recent trends in survival/mortality patterns in 
high-life-expectancy countries; whereas changes in C underlie differences 
between even high-life-expectancy countries, not only between high- and 
low-life-expectancy countries. Such interpretations make sense only if GM is not 
merely a statistical model, but rather reflects biological realities. Therefore, 
GM is discussed as derivable by applying certain constraints to a natural law 
termed the generalized Gompertz-Makeham law.

BACKGROUND: Treatments for multiple myeloma (MM) have been rapidly evolving. 
Newly developed treatment regimens are likely to be more effective but also cost 
more than conventional therapies.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review to compare the cost effectiveness of 
different classes of MM treatment.
METHODS: We searched the PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases 
for studies published during 1990-2018 comparing the cost effectiveness of 
transplant, chemotherapeutic and novel MM treatments. Titles and abstracts were 
independently reviewed for eligibility by two investigators. The quality of the 
included studies was evaluated using the 16-item, validated Quality of Health 
Economics Studies instrument.
RESULTS: Twenty-four publications were included in the systematic review and 
summarized according to treatment regimen and line. For first-line treatment, 
transplant was the most cost-effective option for transplant-eligible MM 
patients [the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $4053-€45,460 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, and $3848-$72,852 per life-year gained 
(LYG)], and the ICER for novel agents compared with conventional chemotherapy 
was $59,076 per QALY and $220,681 per LYG. For second-line treatment, in 
comparisons of novel agent-based regimens, ICERs were inconsistent. However, 
bortezomib-based regimens, lenalidomide plus dexamethasone, and pomalidomide 
plus dexamethasone were each cost effective compared with dexamethasone alone 
(ICERs showed cost saving, £30,153 per QALY gained, and €39,911 per LYG, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: For transplant-eligible MM patients, transplant is a cost-effective 
first-line treatment. More cost-effectiveness analyses comparing novel agents in 
the first-line treatment regimen are warranted to determine which agent or 
regimen is the most cost effective. In the second-line setting, it is unclear 
which novel agent-based regimen is most cost effective, but bortezomib-based 
regimens, lenalidomide plus dexamethasone, and pomalidomide plus dexamethasone 
were each cost effective compared with dexamethasone alone.

BACKGROUND: Current strategies for risk stratification of patients with acute 
myeloid leukemia assign approximately 40% of patients to the intermediate-risk 
group, where uncertainty about optimal therapy still persists.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of a 
HMGA2 prognostic test based on HMGA2+/HMGA2- expression, which improves genetic 
risk stratification in acute myeloid leukemia, and compare this test with the 
current standard of care in Canada.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed from the Canadian National 
Healthcare Service and societal perspective using data from the Quebec Leukemia 
Cell Bank, published literature, and physician surveys. The model includes a 
lifetime horizon assessing the HMGA2 test vs. standard of care.
RESULTS: The HMGA2 test outperformed the standard of care at all time horizons 
culminating with estimated improvements of 1.92 and 3.12 months in leukemia-free 
survival and overall survival, respectively. Costs associated with the HMGA2 
test were consistently lower, except diagnostic costs, routine medical costs, 
and costs related to infections and false positives. From a societal 
perspective, total lifetime costs were $161,358 CAD and $151,908 CAD with the 
standard of care and the HMGA2 test, respectively. The incremental 
quality-adjusted life-year gain was 0.138, which led to dominance over the 
standard of care. Deterministic sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of 
the base-case scenario. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses revealed that for a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 CAD, the probability of cost 
effectiveness was 87.19%.
CONCLUSIONS: The HMGA2 test is estimated to improve leukemia-free survival and 
overall survival outcomes, and yield costs savings from a healthcare system and 
societal perspective.

investment? An analysis of the public health and economic impact of 
improvement in the UK.

OBJECTIVES: Early treatment of HIV-1 infection at all CD4 levels has 
demonstrated clinical and public health benefits. This analysis examined the 
costs, health outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of increased HIV-1 screening and 
early treatment initiation in the UK.
METHODS: A Markov model followed theoretical cohorts of men who have sex with 
men (MSM), heterosexuals, and people who inject drugs (PWID) with initially 
undiagnosed HIV-1 infection over their remaining lifetimes. The analysis 
examined increased HIV-1 screening (resulting in 10-50% improvements in 
diagnosis rates) versus current screening in sexual health services (SHS) and 
other settings, with all individuals initiating treatment within 3 months of 
diagnosis. Health status was modelled by viral load and CD4 cell count as 
individuals progressed to diagnosis and treatment. Individuals accrued 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incurred costs for screening and 
HIV-related clinical management, and were at risk of transmitting HIV-1 
infection to their partners. Input parameter data were taken primarily from 
UK-specific published sources. All outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually.
RESULTS: The model estimated that increased screening and early treatment 
resulted in fewer onward HIV transmissions, more QALYs, and higher total costs. 
For SHS, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for heterosexuals 
(~£22 000/QALY gained) were within typical UK willingness-to-pay thresholds and 
were well below these thresholds for MSM (~£9500/QALY gained) and PWID 
(~£6500/QALY gained). Sensitivity analysis showed that model results were 
robust.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased HIV-1 screening and early treatment initiation may be a 
cost-effective strategy to reduce HIV transmission and improve health for MSM, 
heterosexuals, and PWID in the UK.

BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection (SSI) affects up to 20% of people with a 
primary closed wound after surgery. Wound dressings may reduce SSI.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of a multicentre randomised controlled 
trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dressing 
types or no dressing to reduce SSI in primary surgical wounds.
DESIGN: Phase A - semistructured interviews, outcome measure development, 
practice survey, literature reviews and value-of-information analysis. Phase B - 
pilot RCT with qualitative research and questionnaire validation. Patients and 
the public were involved.
SETTING: Usual NHS care.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients undergoing elective/non-elective abdominal surgery, 
including caesarean section.
INTERVENTIONS: Phase A - none. Phase B - simple dressing, glue-as-a-dressing 
(tissue adhesive) or 'no dressing'.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Phase A - pilot RCT design; SSI, patient experience and 
wound management questionnaires; dressing practices; and value-of-information of 
a RCT. Phase B - participants screened, proportions consented/randomised; 
acceptability of interventions; adherence; retention; validity and reliability 
of SSI measure; and cost drivers.
DATA SOURCES: Phase A - interviews with patients and health-care professionals 
(HCPs), narrative data from published RCTs and data about dressing practices. 
Phase B - participants and HCPs in five hospitals.
RESULTS: Phase A - we interviewed 102 participants. HCPs interpreted 'dressing' 
variably and reported using available products. HCPs suggested 
practical/clinical reasons for dressing use, acknowledged the weak evidence base 
and felt that a RCT including a 'no dressing' group was acceptable. A survey 
showed that 68% of 1769 wounds (727 participants) had simple dressings and 27% 
had glue-as-a-dressing. Dressings were used similarly in elective and 
non-elective surgery. The SSI questionnaire was developed from a content 
analysis of existing SSI tools and interviews, yielding 19 domains and 16 items. 
A main RCT would be valuable to the NHS at a willingness to pay of £20,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year. Phase B - from 4 March 2016 to 30 November 2016, we 
approached 862 patients for the pilot RCT; 81.1% were eligible, 59.4% consented 
and 394 were randomised (simple, n = 133; glue, n = 129; no dressing, n = 132); 
non-adherence was 3 out of 133, 8 out of 129 and 20 out of 132, respectively. 
SSI occurred in 51 out of 281 participants. We interviewed 55 participants. All 
dressing strategies were acceptable to stakeholders, with no indication that 
adherence was problematic. Adherence aids and patients' understanding of their 
allocated dressing appeared to be key. The SSI questionnaire response rate 
overall was 67.2%. Items in the SSI questionnaire fitted a single scale, which 
had good reliability (test-retest and Cronbach's alpha of > 0.7) and diagnostic 
accuracy (c-statistic = 0.906). The key cost drivers were hospital appointments, 
dressings and redressings, use of new medicines and primary care appointments.
LIMITATIONS: Multiple activities, often in parallel, were challenging to 
co-ordinate. An amendment took 4 months, restricting recruitment to the pilot 
RCT. Only 67% of participants completed the SSI questionnaire. We could not 
implement photography in theatres.
CONCLUSIONS: A main RCT of dressing strategies is feasible and would be valuable 
to the NHS. The SSI questionnaire is sufficiently accurate to be used as the 
primary outcome. A main trial with three groups (as in the pilot) would be 
valuable to the NHS, using a primary outcome of SSI at discharge and 
patient-reported SSI symptoms at 4-8 weeks.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Phase A - Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN06792113; Phase B 
- Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN49328913.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research 
(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in 
Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 23, No. 39. See the NIHR Journals Library 
website for further project information. Funding was also provided by the

Plain Language Summary: Wound infections are common after surgery. Some are 
cured with simple treatment, but others may lead to serious problems. Reducing 
the risk of a wound infection is important. We do not know if the type of 
dressing, or not using a dressing, influences the risk of infection. A study 
that allocated patients to receive different dressings (or no dressing) would 
answer this question. We did preliminary research to explore whether or not such 
a study is possible. We interviewed doctors, nurses and patients about their 
views on dressings and a future study. We also described dressings currently 
being used in the NHS and found that simple dressings and tissue adhesive (glue) 
‘as-a-dressing’ are used most frequently. We studied existing evidence and 
interviewed experts to develop a questionnaire, completed by patients, to 
identify wound infections after patients leave hospital and tested its accuracy. 
We also explored taking photographs of wounds. We investigated whether or not a 
major study would be worth the cost and designed a pilot study to test its 
feasibility. The pilot study recruited 394 patients undergoing abdominal 
operations in five NHS hospitals. These patients were allocated to have a simple 
dressing, glue-as-a-dressing or no dressing, and 92% received the allocated 
dressing method. Patients and their doctors and nurses found the dressing 
methods to be acceptable. We showed that the new patient questionnaire 
accurately identified infections. Patients or their carers also found it 
acceptable to photograph their wounds. Our research suggests that a future large 
study would be worth the investment and is possible.

Aberrant immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation offers new prospects to detect 
changes in cell metabolism and by extension, for biomarker discovery in type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, past studies did not analyze the individual 
IgG subclasses in relation to T2DM pathophysiology. We report here original 
findings through a comparison of the IgG subclass-specific fragment 
crystallizable (Fc) glycan biosignatures in 115 T2DM patients with 122 healthy 
controls within the Uyghur population in China. IgG Fc glycosylation profiles 
were analyzed using nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to exclude 
changes attributed to fragment antigen binding N-glycosylation. After correction 
for clinical covariates, 27 directly measured and 4 derived glycan traits of the 
IgG subclass-specific N-glycopeptides were significantly associated with T2DM. 
Furthermore, we observed in T2DM a decrease in bisecting N-acetylglucosamine of 
IgG2 and agalactosylation of IgG4, and an increase in sialylation of IgG4 and 
digalactosylation of IgG2. Classification model based on IgG subclass-specific 
N-glycan traits was able to distinguish patients with T2DM from controls with an 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.927 (95% confidence 
interval 0.894-0.960, p < 0.001). In conclusion, a robust association between 
the IgG subclass-specific Fc N-glycomes and T2DM was observed in the Uyghur 
population sample in China, suggesting a potential for the IgG Fc glycosylation 
as a biomarker candidate for type 2 diabetes. The integration of glycomics with 
other system science biomarkers might offer further hope for innovation in 
diagnosis and treatment of T2DM in the future. Finally, it is noteworthy that 
"Population Glycomics" is an emerging approach to biomarker discovery for common 
complex diseases.

Bleeding from the thoracic aorta is potentially fatal in patients with advanced 
esophageal cancer (AEC). Esophageal malignancy is the third most common cause of 
aortoesophageal fistula, after thoracic aortic aneurysm and ingestion of foreign 
body. The involvement of aortic wall often contraindicates chemoradiotherapy 
(CRT) treatment, thus reducing life expectancy of these patients. Thoracic 
endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is a well-described mini-invasive technique 
that can be also applied for coverage of the aortic lumen in case of invasion by 
esophageal cancer. Only few cases have been published with this atypical 
indication. Between 2016 and 2018, in our tertiary hospital 3 patients affected 
by AEC involving the thoracic aorta were treated by means of prophylactic TEVAR. 
All procedures were uneventful, and all patients were reconsidered fit for 
preoperative or definitive CRT.

Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a group of heritable connective tissue 
disorders with distinct genetic etiologies. Of the 13 currently recognized types 
of EDS, the vascular type EDS (vEDS) is generally considered the most severe and 
is associated with a decreased life expectancy due to spontaneous arterial, 
intestinal, and or uterine rupture. Diagnosis of vEDS is supported by genetic 
testing confirming the presence of pathogenic variations in COL3A1, a type III 
procollagen gene. Management of vEDS is usually conservative with control of 
hemodynamic stress, frequent cardiovascular imaging, and, if indicated, a 
thoughtful endovascular intervention or surgical repair. We present a novel 
frameshift variant in COL3A1 leading to vEDS with multiple vascular 
involvements. Based on our literature review, this variant has not been reported 
and may result in a less severe form of vEDS. Our case report provides insight 
into genetic variants and clinical expression of vEDS.
