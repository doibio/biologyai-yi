population spawned the field of geriatric oncology and the development of brief, 
practical versions of the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) for use in 
busy oncology clinics are in sight. It is time for us to incorporate elements of 
the CGA into practice, to systematically identify older patients at substantial 
risk of toxicity. For frail older women with breast cancer, no therapy or less 
toxic therapies can be considered, some of which are suggested herein. In 
addition, as always in oncology, physicians and patients should look for and 
participate in clinical trials that will define how to treat cancer, especially 
in older patients, in the future.

INTRODUCTION: This article summarizes the main findings of the preterm infant 
sub-study of the Performance, Effectiveness and Costs of Treatment episodes 
(PERFECT) study. We studied effects of birth hospital level and time of birth on 
mortality and morbidity and cost-effectiveness of care of very low gestational 
age (VLGA)/very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included all infants born below 32 weeks or 1501 
g in Finland in 2000-2007. Different cohorts were used depending on the time 
point.
RESULTS: The one-year mortality of live-born VLBW/VLGA infants was higher if 
born in level II versus level III hospitals, or if born during out-of-office 
hours in level II versus office hours in level III hospitals. Two out of three 
VLGA/VLBW subjects did not have any of the prematurity-related morbidities 
studied. The average cost of quality-adjusted life years was €19,245 by four 
years of age; the cost was higher in VLGA/VLBW infants with long-term 
morbidities.
DISCUSSION: Birth in a level III hospital improved survival of VLGA/VLBW 
infants. Results suggest inadequate overnight competence in small hospitals. 
Despite high initial costs, care of VLGA/VLBW infants was already cost-effective 
by four years of age. Cost-effectiveness can be improved by reducing long-term 
morbidities.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
active conservative treatment, compared with standard management, in regaining 
urinary continence at 12 months in men with urinary incontinence at 6 weeks 
after a radical prostatectomy or a transurethral resection of the prostate 
(TURP).
BACKGROUND: Urinary incontinence after radical prostate surgery is common 
immediately after surgery, although the chance of incontinence is less after 
TURP than following radical prostatectomy.
DESIGN: Two multicentre, UK, parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
comparing active conservative treatment [pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) 
delivered by a specialist continence physiotherapist or a specialist continence 
nurse] with standard management in men after radial prostatectomy and TURP.
SETTING: Men having prostate surgery were identified in 34 centres across the 
UK. If they had urinary incontinence, they were invited to enroll in the RCT.
PARTICIPANTS: Men with urinary incontinence at 6 weeks after prostate surgery 
were eligible to be randomised if they consented and were able to comply with 
the intervention.
INTERVENTIONS: Eligible men were randomised to attend four sessions with a 
therapist over a 3-month period. The therapists provided standardised PFMT and 
bladder training for male urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. The 
control group continued with standard management.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of clinical effectiveness was urinary 
incontinence at 12 months after randomisation, and the primary measure of 
cost-effectiveness was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). 
Outcome data were collected by postal questionnaires at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.
RESULTS: Within the radical group (n = 411), 92% of the men in the intervention 
group attended at least one therapy visit and were more likely than those in the 
control group to be carrying out any PFMT at 12 months {adjusted risk ratio (RR) 
1.30 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.53]}. The absolute risk difference 
in urinary incontinence rates at 12 months between the intervention (75.5%) and 
control (77.4%) groups was -1.9% (95% CI -10% to 6%). NHS costs were higher in 
the intervention group [£ 181.02 (95% CI £ 107 to £ 255)] but there was no 
evidence of a difference in societal costs, and QALYs were virtually identical 
for both groups. Within the TURP group (n = 442), over 85% of men in the 
intervention group attended at least one therapy visit and were more likely to 
be carrying out any PFMT at 12 months after randomisation [adjusted RR 3.20 (95% 
CI 2.37 to 4.32)]. The absolute risk difference in urinary incontinence rates at 
12 months between the intervention (64.9%) and control (61.5%) groups for the 
unadjusted intention-to-treat analysis was 3.4% (95% CI -6% to 13%). NHS costs 
[£ 209 (95% CI £ 147 to £ 271)] and societal costs [£ 420 (95% CI £ 54 to £ 
785)] were statistically significantly higher in the intervention group but 
QALYs were virtually identical.
CONCLUSIONS: The provision of one-to-one conservative physical therapy for men 
with urinary incontinence after prostate surgery is unlikely to be effective or 
cost-effective compared with standard care that includes the provision of 
information about conducting PFMT. Future work should include research into the 
value of different surgical options in controlling urinary incontinence.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of pediatric pneumococcal 
vaccination in Spain.
METHODS: A deterministic population-based model in the form of a decision-tree 
with a 1-year time horizon was used to estimate the impact of vaccination with 
Synflorix® or Prevenar13® in children aged less than 2 years in Spain from the 
perspective of the National Health System. Epidemiological data were obtained 
from the hospital discharge minimum data set (MDS) and the literature. Data on 
costs were obtained from national health costs databases. The main outcomes 
measured were the number of cases avoided of invasive pneumococcal disease, 
acute otitis media (AOM) and myringotomies, and hospital admissions for 
pneumonia. All costs were expressed in 2010 euros. Effectiveness was measured as 
the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: The efficacy of Synflorix® in preventing episodes of AOM caused by 
non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae could lead to additional prevention of 
41,513 episodes of AOM, 36,324 antibiotic prescriptions and 382 myringotomy 
procedures and 143 QALYs gained compared with Prevenar13®. The total vaccination 
cost with Synflorix® would result in savings of 22 million euros.
CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal vaccination with Synflorix® in comparison with 
Prevenar13® in children aged less than 2 years old in Spain could achieve a 
higher number of QALYs and a substantial cost offset. Vaccination with 
Synflorix® would be a dominant strategy in terms of cost-effectiveness.

This study explores why progress with tackling health inequalities has varied 
among a group of local authority areas in England that were set targets to 
narrow important health outcomes compared to national averages. It focuses on 
premature deaths from cancers and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and whether the 
local authority gap for these outcomes narrowed. Survey and secondary data were 
used to create dichotomised conditions describing each area. For cancers, ten 
conditions were found to be associated with whether or not narrowing occurred: 
presence/absence of a working culture of individual commitment and champions; 
spending on cancer programmes; aspirational or comfortable/complacent 
organisational cultures; deprivation; crime; assessments of strategic 
partnership working, commissioning and the public health workforce; frequency of 
progress reviews; and performance rating of the local Primary Care Trust (PCT). 
For CVD, six conditions were associated with whether or not narrowing occurred: 
a PCT budget closer or further away from target; assessments of primary care 
services, smoking cessation services and local leadership; presence/absence of a 
few major programmes; and population turnover. The method of Qualitative 
Comparative Analysis was used to find configurations of these conditions with 
either the narrowing or not narrowing outcomes. Narrowing cancer gaps were 
associated with three configurations in which individual commitment and 
champions was a necessary condition, and not narrowing was associated with a 
group of conditions that had in common a high level of bureaucratic-type work. 
Narrowing CVD gaps were associated with three configurations in which a high 
assessment of either primary care or smoking cessation services was a necessary 
condition, and not narrowing was associated with two configurations that both 
included an absence of major programmes. The article considers substantive and 
theoretical arguments for these configurations being causal and as pointing to 
ways of improving progress with tackling health inequalities.

Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.

CONTEXT: Sixty-five percent of people with advanced cancer suffers from loss of 
appetite. Several inflammatory cytokines appear to cause appetite loss in animal 
models. Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug that has been associated with 
improved appetite in those with HIV infections and cancer.
OBJECTIVES: We completed a two-stage Phase II dose titration study of 
thalidomide, the primary purpose of which was to assess appetite response to 
thalidomide in cancer-associated anorexia.
METHODS: Individuals older than 18 years of age with active cancer, loss of 
appetite by numerical rating scale (NRS), life expectancy of at least four 
weeks, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-3 were 
entered into the study. Pretreatment screening included medical history, 
neurologic examination, and symptoms by NRS and categorical scale (CAT). 
Patients received 50mg of thalidomide by mouth at bedtime for two weeks. 
Individuals who did not respond were dose escalated to 100mg at night for two 
weeks. Assessment of appetite, early satiety, fatigue, insomnia, night sweats, 
pain, and quality of life (QOL) occurred at two-week intervals. Toxicity also 
was assessed. The primary outcome was appetite response defined as a two-point 
reduction in the NRS or a one-point improvement in the CAT.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients entered the study; 33 completed 14 days of therapy 
and were analyzed for efficacy and toxicity. Sixty-four percent who completed at 
least two weeks of thalidomide had improved appetite. The CAT scores for 
appetite, insomnia, and QOL improved significantly. The 95% confidence intervals 
did not overlap. Five participants dropped out because of toxicity: two before 
two weeks and three later.
CONCLUSION: Thalidomide reduced multiple symptoms commonly associated with 
cancer-related anorexia and improved QOL. Our findings confirmed and validated a 
previously published single-arm trial. A recent randomized trial demonstrated 
greater benefits when thalidomide is used combined with other agents to treat 
cancer-associated anorexia and cachexia. Thalidomide helped cancer-associated 
anorexia in most patients. It also improved insomnia and QOL in advanced cancer.

Substantial changes are needed to achieve a more targeted and strategic approach 
to investment in the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic that will yield long-term 
dividends. Until now, advocacy for resources has been done on the basis of a 
commodity approach that encouraged scaling up of numerous strategies in 
parallel, irrespective of their relative effects. We propose a strategic 
investment framework that is intended to support better management of national 
and international HIV/AIDS responses than exists with the present system. Our 
framework incorporates major efficiency gains through community mobilisation, 
synergies between programme elements, and benefits of the extension of 
antiretroviral therapy for prevention of HIV transmission. It proposes three 
categories of investment, consisting of six basic programmatic activities, 
interventions that create an enabling environment to achieve maximum 
effectiveness, and programmatic efforts in other health and development sectors 
related to HIV/AIDS. The yearly cost of achievement of universal access to HIV 
prevention, treatment, care, and support by 2015 is estimated at no less than 
US$22 billion. Implementation of the new investment framework would avert 12·2 
million new HIV infections and 7·4 million deaths from AIDS between 2011 and 
2020 compared with continuation of present approaches, and result in 29·4 
million life-years gained. The framework is cost effective at $1060 per 
life-year gained, and the additional investment proposed would be largely offset 
from savings in treatment costs alone.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a relatively rare, but highly aggressive, 
tumor, associated to exposure to asbestos, with a life expectancy between 9 and 
17 months. Chest pain and dyspnea are the most frequent symptoms. The most 
commonly used therapy is surgery accompanied by chemotherapy. Preoperative 
assessment, after chemotherapy, has been done using magnetic resonance imaging 
and computed tomography (CT). However, these techniques cannot predict early 
response to therapy, because of the slow structural change of the tumor. The aim 
of this case report is to review and learn about the growing use of PET-CT 
imaging with (18)F-FDG in the preoperative staging of malignant pleural 
mesothelioma and its influence in selecting the most appropriate type of 
surgery.

BACKGROUND: We wanted to know the effect of comorbidity, age, and gender on the 
outcome after surgical below-knee revascularization for critical chronic limb 
ischemia.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 624 consecutive patients who underwent 
below-knee bypass surgery between January 1996 and December 2005 because of 
chronic peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Patients' characteristics were: 
diabetes mellitus (DM) n = 445 (71%), coronary artery disease (CAD) n = 310 
(49%), dialysis-dependent renal insufficiency (dRI) n = 88 (14%), age >70 years 
n = 279 (44%), male n = 423 (68%), PAD Fontaine's stage III n = 105 (17%), and 
PAD stage 4 n =519 (83%). All patients had Trans Atlantic Inter-Society 
Consensus (TASC) C and D lesions, all were treated with a vein bypass to a 
crural artery n = 354 (57%) and to a pedal artery n = 270 (43%). Kaplan-Meier 
analysis and multivariate analysis were performed.
RESULTS: The early results were as follows. The 30-day major amputation rate was 
n = 43 (7%). CAD, dRI, age, and gender did not influence major amputation rate, 
whereas patients with diabetes had a lower risk of early amputation than those 
without diabetes. (hazard ratio: 0.49, 95% confidence interval: 0.25-0.95, p < 
0.05). The 30-day mortality rate was n = 31 (5%) and was uninfluenced by DM, 
CAD, and gender. Patients with dRI and octogenarians had a high risk of early 
death (dRI: 13.6%, octogenarians 9.4%). The late results were as follows. 
Follow-up rates were: limb salvage n = 596 (95.5%) and survival n = 622 (99.7%). 
The limb salvage rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 79.1%, 72.1%, and 66.4%, 
respectively, and were uninfluenced by DM, CAD, dRI, age, and gender. The 
mortality rates at 1-, 3-, and 5-years were 79%, 63.4%, and 47.3%, respectively. 
Comorbidities such as CAD, dRI, and age of >70 years reduced life expectancy 
significantly. DM did not influence 1, 3 and 5 years of survival. The 5-year 
survival rates as estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis after revascularization 
were: DM, 46%; CAD, 38%; dRI, 19%; and age >70 years, 37%.
CONCLUSION: Advanced age and comorbidities reduce life span but not the chance 
of avoiding major amputation after below-knee bypass surgery for critical limb 
ischemia.

of Medicine, Reno, NV 89502, USA.

The aging population with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) 
deserves appropriate health care and social support. This population poses 
unique medical and social challenges to the multidisciplinary team that provides 
care. In the past, long-term care (LTC) facilities played an essential role in 
the livelihood of this population. The likelihood that the geriatric LTC system 
must prepare for adequately caring for this population is high. This article 
conveys the need to prepare for the inclusion of the growing aging population 
with I/DD into long-term care with the general elderly population in the near 
future.

Center, New York, NY 10065, USA. korcgrob@mskcc.org

This article describes the range of cancer patients in longterm care and 
provides a framework for clinical decision making. The benefits and burdens of 
providing standard therapy to a vulnerable population are discussed. To give 
more specific guidelines for advocates of treatment, skeptics, and others, the 
authors present best estimates of the current burden of cancer in the long-term 
care population and current screening guidelines that apply to the elderly under 
long-term care. Experience-based suggestions are offered for oncologists and 
clinicians involved in long-term care to help them respond to patient and family 
concerns about limitations of cancer care.

Regulation of yeast chronological life span by TORC1 via adaptive mitochondrial 
ROS signaling.

    Cell Metab. 2011 Jun 8;13(6):617-8.

Here we show that yeast strains with reduced target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling 
have greater overall mitochondrial electron transport chain activity during 
growth that is efficiently coupled to ATP production. This metabolic alteration 
increases mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
production, which we propose supplies an adaptive signal during growth that 
extends chronological life span (CLS). In strong support of this concept, 
uncoupling respiration during growth or increasing expression of mitochondrial 
manganese superoxide dismutase significantly curtails CLS extension in tor1Δ 
strains, and treatment of wild-type strains with either rapamycin (to inhibit 
TORC1) or menadione (to generate mitochondrial ROS) during growth is sufficient 
to extend CLS. Finally, extension of CLS by reduced TORC1/Sch9p-mitochondrial 
signaling occurs independently of Rim15p and is not a function of changes in 
media acidification/composition. Considering the conservation of TOR-pathway 
effects on life span, mitochondrial ROS signaling may be an important mechanism 
of longevity regulation in higher organisms.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Laminectomy for lumbar stenosis-associated radiculopathy is 
associated with improvement in pain, disability, and quality of life. However, 
given rising health-care costs, attention has been turned to question the 
cost-effectiveness of lumbar decompressive procedures. The cost-effectiveness of 
multilevel hemilaminectomy for radiculopathy remains unclear.
PURPOSE: To assess the comprehensive medical and societal costs of multilevel 
hemilaminectomy at our institution and determine its cost-effectiveness in the 
treatment of degenerative lumbar stenosis.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective single cohort study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Fifty-four consecutive patients undergoing multilevel 
hemilaminectomy for lumbar stenosis-associated radiculopathy after at least 6 
months of failed conservative therapy were included.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported measures were assessed using an outcomes 
questionnaire that incorporated total back-related medical resource utilization, 
missed work, and improvement in leg pain (visual analog scale for leg pain 
[VAS-LP]), disability (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]), quality of life (Short 
Form-12 [SF-12]), and health state values (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs], 
calculated from EuroQuol 5D [EQ-5D] with US valuation).
METHODS: Over a 2-year period, total back-related medical resource utilization, 
missed work, and improvement in leg pain (VAS-LP), disability (ODI), quality of 
life (SF-12), and health state values (QALYs, calculated from EQ-5D with US 
valuation) were assessed. Two-year resource use was multiplied by unit costs 
based on Medicare national allowable payment amounts (direct cost), and patient 
and caregiver workday losses were multiplied by the self-reported gross-of-tax 
wage rate (indirect cost). Mean total 2-year cost per QALY gained after 
multilevel hemilaminectomy was assessed.
RESULTS: Compared with preoperative health states reported after at least 6 
months of medical management, a significant improvement in VAS-LP, ODI, and 
SF-12 (physical and mental components) was observed 2 years after multilevel 
hemilaminectomy, with a mean 2-year gain of 0.72 QALYs. Mean±standard deviation 
total 2-year cost of multilevel hemilaminectomy was $24,264±10,319 (surgery 
cost, $10,220±80.57; outpatient resource utilization cost, $3,592±3,243; and 
indirect cost, $10,452±9,364). Multilevel hemilaminectomy was associated with a 
mean 2-year cost per QALY gained of $33,700.
CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel hemilaminectomy improved pain, disability, and quality 
of life in patients with lumbar stenosis-associated radiculopathy. Total cost 
per QALY gained for multilevel hemilaminectomy was $33,700 when evaluated 2 
years after surgery with Medicare fees, suggesting that multilevel 
hemilaminectomy is a cost-effective treatment of lumbar radiculopathy.

Effective highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for human 
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) infection has led to marked improvement in 
life-expectancy for those infected with HIV. Despite reductions in the incidence 
of AIDS with effective treatment, patients continue to experience considerable 
morbidity and mortality from non-AIDS illness such as premature cardiovascular 
disease, liver failure and renal failure. These morbidities, particularly 
premature cardiovascular disease, are thought to be related to a combination of 
the effects of an ageing HIV-infected population coupled with long-term effects 
of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART). One of the principle drivers 
behind the well documented increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease in 
HIV-infected patients is dyslipidemia.This review will focus on the clinical 
presentation of HIV and ART-associated dyslipidemia, what is known of its 
patho-physiology, including associations with use of specific antiretroviral 
medications, and suggest screening and management strategies.

Modeling the pulsed light inactivation of microorganisms naturally occurring on 
vegetable substrates.

Pulsed light (PL) is a fast non-thermal method for microbial inactivation. This 
research studied the kinetics of PL inactivation of microorganisms naturally 
occurring in some vegetables. Iceberg lettuce, white cabbage and Julienne-style 
cut carrots were subjected to increasing PL fluences up to 12J/cm(2) in order to 
study its effect on aerobic mesophilic bacteria determined by plate count. Also, 
sample temperature increase was determined by infrared thermometry. Survivors' 
curves were adjusted to several models. No shoulder but tail was observed. The 
Weibull model showed good fitting performance of data. Results for lettuce were: 
goodness-of-fit parameter RMSE=0.2289, fluence for the first decimal reduction 
δ=0.98±0.80J/cm(2) and concavity parameter p=0.33±0.08. Results for cabbage 
were: RMSE=0.0725, δ=0.81±0.23J/cm(2) and p=0.30±0.02; and for carrot: 
RMSE=0.1235, δ=0.39±0.24J/cm(2) and p=0.23±0.03. For lettuce, a log-linear and 
tail model was also suitable. Validation of the Weibull model produced 
determination coefficients of 0.88-0.96 and slopes of 0.78-0.99. Heating was too 
low to contribute to inactivation. A single low-energy pulse was enough to 
achieve one log reduction, with an ultrafast treatment time of 0.5ms. While PL 
efficacy was found to be limited to high residual counts, the achievable 
inactivation level may be considered useful for shelf-life extension.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction due to a spontaneous thrombus in the left 
anterior descending artery in a young HIV-infected patient.

With increasing life expectancy due to highly active antiretroviral therapy 
(HAART), the spectrum of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated morbidity 
and mortality has shifted from opportunistic infections toward associated 
chronic medical conditions. We report on a 26-year-old female patient receiving 
HAART for HIV infection, who developed spontaneous thrombosis of the proximal 
left anterior descending (LAD) artery, resulting in acute ST-elevation 
myocardial infarction. She had none of the conventional risk factors for the 
development of coronary artery disease. Following diagnostic coronary 
angiography that showed a large (16x3.4 mm) spontaneous thrombus in the proximal 
LAD artery, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed with prior 
aspiration of the occluding thrombus and implantation of a bare-metal stent. The 
patient was discharged with instruction of appropriate medical therapy. This 
case highlights the association between immunosuppression with HAART, 
particularly protease inhibitors, and the development of accelerated 
atherosclerosis in patients with HIV infection.

Disability-free life expectancy: comparison of sources and small area estimates 
in England, 2006-08.

Smith MP(1), Olatunde O, White C.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Health expectancies (HEs) at sub-national geographies or by clusters 
of areas defined by relative deprivation are important tools to monitor 
inequalities in health. Previously, analyses have had limited usefulness due to 
a lack of timeliness or local relevance caused by limitations on the frequency 
or coverage of survey data. Here we explore the potential of the Annual 
Population Survey (APS) to provide robust estimates of disability-free life 
expectancy (DFLE) for men and women by clusters of area deprivation, English 
regions and local authority districts (LAs) in the period 2006-08.
METHODS: DFLE estimates for the UK were compared using the prevalence of 
limiting long-standing illness (LLSI) calculated using data from the APS and 
from the General Lifestyle Survey (GLF) covering Great Britain and equivalent 
data from the Continuous Household Survey (CHS) covering Northern Ireland, 
aggregated over the period 2006-08. The further use of APS data for England 
enabled the calculation of estimates of DFLE at age 16 and at age 65 for men and 
women by area deprivation quintiles (each quintile comprises a fifth of areas 
ranked according to their relative deprivation), English regions and LAs in 
order to measure inequality in DFLE between these population groupings.
RESULTS: The prevalence of LLSI and estimates of DFLE at national level were 
broadly comparable using APS and GLF/CHS data. Substantial inequality in DFLE 
was present between clusters of areas defined by relative deprivation and 
between English regions and LAs. The scale of inequality increased markedly with 
each finer geographical scale analysed.
CONCLUSION: The APS is a viable data source to provide LLSI data for use in DFLE 
estimation across a range of areas and clusters of area deprivation. While 
increasingly fine-grained analysis decreases statistical precision, it is 
possible to detect clear differences between areas within regions and in making 
comparisons with the England average. The estimates presented here provide scope 
to set benchmarks for assessing the impact of interventions designed to reduce 
inequality in DFLE beyond the period 2006-08.

As there are only few reliable data concerning mortality of SCI patients, this 
retrospective monocentric cohort study was carried out. Despite essential 
improvements in intensive medical care from the accident scene to clinic life, 
comprehensive rehabilitation, and implementation of a lifelong aftercare system, 
the life expectancy of SCI patients is still reduced. Especially patients with 
high tetraplegia die significantly earlier from pulmonary complications. The 
longer the onset of SCI is survived, the more patients die from age-related 
diseases. In old paraplegic patients, pressure sores are the only major 
SCI-related complication. Successful social reintegration and professional care 
are the most important factors for an expanded lifespan after occurrence of a 
SCI. Hence, the special impact of lifelong treatment of SCI patients 
("comprehensive care") is confirmed.

Abatacept: a biologic immune modulator for rheumatoid arthritis.

Papagoras C(1), Drosos AA.

Author information:
(1)University of Ioannina, Medical School, Rheumatology Clinic, Department of 
Internal Medicine, Ioannina, Greece.

INTRODUCTION: Abatacept is a biologic drug that belongs to the class of T-cell 
co-stimulation modulators and is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA).
AREAS COVERED: This article covers major randomized clinical trials and 
meta-analyses concerning abatacept in the treatment of RA, as identified in a 
Pubmed search. Scientific meeting abstracts describing long-term extension data 
of the identified trials are also included. Efficacy outcomes and the safety 
profile are the focus of this evaluation.
EXPERT OPINION: Abatacept in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other 
synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) has been proven 
effective for the treatment of RA in different groups of patients: with early RA 
and no prior exposure to DMARD; with DMARD-resistant RA; and with RA not 
responding to TNF-α-blocking agents. Significant reductions of disease activity 
are achieved, with 1-year remission rates reaching up to 41% of DMARD-naïve 
patients with early RA receiving a combination of abatacept plus MTX. Abatacept 
treatment has been shown to improve function and quality of life and to suppress 
radiographic progression. No major safety issues have emerged during clinical 
trials and long-term extensions. Therefore, abatacept is a drug with a favorable 
efficacy and safety profile, which may offer substantial benefits to RA 
patients.

[The use of screening methods in diagnosis of disturbances of respiration during 
sleep in patients with cardiac pathology].

[Article in Russian]

Eroshina EV, Kalinkin AL, Sidorenko BA.

Disturbances of respiration during sleep especially those of obstructive 
character are sufficiently widespread phenomena. In addition to worsening of the 
quality of sleep itself they facilitate formation and development of concomitant 
pathology of cardiovascular system, endocrine system, cognitive sphere. This 
results in lowering of quality of life and its duration. At present standard 
method of diagnosis of disturbances of respiration during sleep is 
polysomnographical examination. At the same time more accessible screening 
methods are also actively used with the aim of detection of subjects with high 
probability of respiratory disturbances during sleep. Among them 
cardiorespiratory monitoring, nocturnal pulsoximetry, registration of oro-nasal 
flow during sleep, are questionnaires most widely-spread.

Characterizing predictive models of mortality for older adults and their 
validation for use in clinical practice.

Minne L(1), Ludikhuize J, de Rooij SE, Abu-Hanna A.

Netherlands. L.Minne@amc.uva.nl

OBJECTIVES: To systematically identify and characterize prognostic models of 
mortality for older adults, their reported potential use, and the actual level 
of their (external) validity.
DESIGN: The Scopus database until January 2010 was searched for articles that 
developed and validated new models or validated existing prognostic models of 
mortality or survival in older adults.
SETTING: All domains of health care.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 50 and older.
MEASUREMENTS: Study and model characteristics were summarized, including the 
model's development method and degree of validation, data types used, and 
outcomes.
RESULTS: One hundred three articles describing 193 models in 10 domains and 
mostly originating from the United States were included. These domains were 
mostly secondary or tertiary care settings (54%) such as intensive care (7%) or 
geriatric units (8%). Half of the studies (50%) were not disease specific. Heart 
failure-related diseases (9%) and pneumonia (9%) constituted the major 
disease-specific subgroups. Most studies (67%) reported support of clinical 
individual (treatment) decisions as use of prognostic models, but only 34% were 
externally validated, and only four models (2%) were validated in more than two 
studies. Most studies (68%) developed at least one new model, but they did not 
often go beyond addressing their apparent validation (49%).
CONCLUSION: Although prognostic models are regularly developed to support 
clinical individual decisions and could be useful for this purpose, their use is 
premature. Because clinical credibility and evidence of external validity build 
trust in prognostic models, both require much more consideration to enhance 
model acceptance in the future.

Does excess body fat maintained after the seventh decade decrease life 
expectancy?

Author information:
(1)Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Loma 
Linda University, Loma Linda, California 92350, USA. psingh@llu.edu

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the attenuation in risk of death due to excess 
body fat seen in most studies of older adults may be due to confounding, the 
relationship between adiposity and mortality was examined in adults who never 
smoked, were free of major chronic diseases, and maintained stable weight over 
long periods.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: The Adventist Health Study and Adventist Mortality Study in California.
PARTICIPANTS: Six thousand thirty adults aged 25 to 82 who had never smoked and 
had no history of coronary heart disease, cancer, or stroke.
MEASUREMENTS: During 29 years of follow-up, anthropometric data were collected 
at baseline and 17 years later, and mortality surveillance continued for 12 
years thereafter. Data were analyzed using survival analysis with attained age 
as the time variable.
RESULTS: Instantaneous hazard plots indicated that men with a body mass index 
(BMI) greater than 22.3 kg/m2 and women with a BMI greater than 27.4 kg/m2 had a 
greater mortality risk through the ninth decade than those with lower BMI. For 
men aged 75 to 99 who maintained stable body weight, a BMI greater than 22.3 
kg/m2 was associated with a 3.7-year (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.1-6.3) 
shorter life expectancy and significantly greater mortality (hazard ratio 
(HR)=1.88, 95% CI=1.16-3.04, for BMI=22.3-27.3 kg/m2; HR=2.00, 95% CI=1.01-3.97 
for BMI>27.3 kg/m2; reference, BMI≤22.3 kg/m2). For women aged 75 to 99 who 
maintained stable body weight, a BMI greater than 27.4 kg/m2 was associated with 
a 2.1-year (95% CI=0.5-3.8) shorter life expectancy and significantly greater 
mortality (HR=1.12, 95% CI=0.80-1.58 for BMI<20.6 kg/m2; HR=1.41, 95% 
CI=1.05-1.89 for BMI>27.4 kg/m2; reference, BMI 20.6-27.4 kg/m2).
CONCLUSION: Excess body fat maintained after the seventh decade decreases life 
expectancy but appears to be less lethal in women.

Cost effectiveness of duloxetine in the treatment of fibromyalgia in the United 
States.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of duloxetine when considered as 
an alternative treatment for patients in the United States (US) being treated 
for fibromyalgia pain.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate the economic 
and clinical advantages of duloxetine in controlling fibromyalgia pain symptoms 
over a 2-year time horizon. A base-case treatment sequence was adopted from 
clinical guidelines, based on tricyclic antidepressants, 
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, anticonvulsants, and opioids. 
Treatment response was modeled using changes from baseline in pain severity, and 
response thresholds: full response (at least a 50% change), response (30-49% 
change), and no response (less than a 30% change). Clinical efficacy and 
discontinuation data were taken from placebo- and active-controlled trials 
identified in a systematic literature review and mixed-treatment comparison. 
Utility data were based on EQ-5D data.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Additional symptom-control months (SCMs), defined as the 
amount of time at a response level of 30% or less, and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) over a 2-year time horizon.
RESULTS: For every 1000 patients, first-line duloxetine resulted in an 
additional 665 SCMs and 12.3 QALYs, at a cost of $582,911 (equivalent to 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs] of $877 per SCM and $47,560 per 
QALY). Second-line duloxetine resulted in an additional 460 SCMs and 8.7 QALYs, 
at a cost of $143,752 (equivalent to ICERs of $312 per SMC and $16,565 per 
QALY).
LIMITATIONS: Response data for TCAs are limited to 30% improvement levels, 
reported trials are small, and have low placebo response rates. The model 
necessarily assumes that response rates are independent of placement in the 
treatment sequence.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the introduction of duloxetine into the 
standard treatment sequence for fibromyalgia not only provides additional 
patient benefits, reflected by time spent in pain control, but also is cost 
effective when compared with commonly adopted thresholds.
