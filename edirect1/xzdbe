FN layer before cell seeding also blocked subsequent fibrillar formation. 
Varying the illumination wavelength range between 400 and 640 nm revealed strong 
inhibition across the visible spectrum up to 560 nm, and a decreasing inhibitory 
effect at longer wavelengths. The photo effect also affected unlabeled FN, but 
was enhanced by fluorophore labeling of FN. The inhibitory effect could be 
reduced when reactive oxygen species (ROS) were removed for the cell imaging 
medium. Based on these findings, FN fibrillogenesis could be imaged successfully 
using a labeling dye with a long excitation wavelength (Alexa Fluor 633, 
excitation at 632 nm) and ROS scavengers, such as oxyrase, in the imaging 
medium. Fibrillar remodeling of exposed cell-free FN layers by AFM scanning 
required higher scan forces compared to non-exposed FN, consisting with 
mechanical stiffing of the FN layer after illumination. In agreement with 
changes in FN mechanics, cells spreading on pre-exposed FN showed reduced 
migration speeds, altered focal adhesion arrangement, and changes in 
mechanosensitive signaling pathways, including reduced FAK (Y397) and paxillin 
(Y118) phosphorylation. Pre-exposure of FN to visible light prior to cell 
seeding thus provides a useful tool to delineate mechanosensitive signaling 
pathway related to FN fibrillogenesis. When using FN-coated cell adhesion 
substrates, care should be taken when comparing experimental results obtained on 
non-exposed FN layers in cell culture incubators, or during live-cell 
fluorescence imaging, as FN fibrillogenesis and mechanosensitive cellular 
signaling pathways may be affected differently.

To investigate the effect of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) combined 
with rehabilitation training on patients with acute cerebral infarction and 
motor impairment, seventy-four patients with acute cerebral infarction and 
hemiplegia were randomly and equally divided into two groups, the control group 
and the IPC treatment group. The patients in the control group received 
conventional drug therapy and rehabilitation training, and the patients in the 
treatment group received the IPC treatment in addition to the treatment given in 
the control group. Motor function, the primary outcome, of the two groups was 
evaluated by Fugl-Meyer motor function scores. The Barthel index assessment 
scale was used to evaluate the ability to perform activities of daily living of 
the two groups, as a secondary outcome. All these indicators were collected and 
compared before treatment and at 7 days, 14 days, and 30 days after treatment. 
The incidence of adverse reactions associated with treatment was also recorded. 
At 7, 14, and 30 days after treatment, the Fugl-Meyer scores (27.16 ± 7.37, 
33.41 ± 7.16 and 38.72 ± 7.65) and Barthel scores (47.16 ± 7.37, 52.41 ± 7.16, 
and 56.09 ± 8.32) of the treatment group were also significantly higher than 
those (23.65 ± 3.11, 26.13 ± 3.25, and 28.75 ± 5.92; 44.15 ± 3.11, 46.63 ± 3.25 
and 47.75 ± 4.22) of the control group (all P < 0.05). With the extension of 
follow-up time, both scores were higher. There were no treatment-related adverse 
events in either of the two groups of patients during or after treatment. In 
conclusion, the IPC combined with rehabilitation training can effectively 
improve motor function deficits, the ability to perform activities of daily 
living, and quality of life for patients.

Porous structures on solid surfaces prepared artificially through the water 
droplet template method have the features of easy operation, low cost and 
self-removal of templates, and thus are widely applied in the fields of 
medicine, biomedicine, adsorption, catalysis, and separation, optical and 
electronic materials. Due to their tunable dimensions, abundant selection of 
materials, mechanical stability, high porosity, and enlarged pore surface, the 
formed porous interfaces show specific significance in bio-related systems. In 
this study, recent achievements related to applications of porous interfaces and 
a focus into biological and medical-related systems are summarized. The 
discussion involves the preparation of porous interfaces, and porous 
interface-induced cell behaviors including culture, growth, proliferation, 
adhesion, and differentiation of cells. The inhibitory effect of bacteria and 
separated features of microorganisms supported by porous interfaces, the 
immobilization of biomolecules related to proteins, DNA and enzymes, and the 
controllable drug delivery are also discussed. The summary of recent advances 
pointed out in the study, are suggestive of insights for motivating unique 
potential applications including their extension to porous interfaces in 
biomedical materials.

AIMS: To estimate the prevalence, incidence, mortality, and risk factors for 
atrial fibrillation (AF) in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Following the methodologies used in the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2017, the prevalence, incidence, and mortality of AF were analysed 
by age, sex, year, socio-demographic index (SDI), and location. The percentage 
contributions of major risk factors to age-standardized AF deaths were measured 
by population attributable fractions. In 2017, there were 37.57 million [95% 
uncertainty interval (UI) 32.55-42.59] prevalent cases and 3.05 million (95% UI 
2.61-3.51) incident cases of AF globally, contributing to 287 241 (95% UI 276 
355-304 759) deaths. The age-standardized rates of prevalent cases, incident 
cases, and deaths of AF in 2017 and their temporal trends from 1990 to 2017 
varied significantly by SDI quintile and location. High systolic blood pressure 
was the leading risk factor for AF age-standardized deaths [34.3% (95% UI 
27.4-41.5)] in 2017, followed by high body mass index [20.7% (95% UI 11.5-32.2)] 
and alcohol use [9.4% (95% UI 7.0-12.2)].
CONCLUSION: Our study has systematically and globally assessed the temporal 
trends of AF, which remains a major public heath challenge. Although AF mainly 
occurred in developed countries, the unfavourable trend in countries with lower 
SDI also deserves particular attention. More effective prevention and treatment 
strategies aimed at counteracting the increase in AF burden should be 
established in some countries.

Tuberculous pseudoaneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta is quite rare, 
life-threatening, and fatal if not diagnosed in time. This lesion exposes 
patients to a very high risk of unpredictable rupture. We describe a case of 
tuberculous pseudoaneurysm of the aorta in association with tuberculosis of the 
spine (Pott's spine). A 73-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of back 
pain. Chest roentgenography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a 
descending thoracic aortic pseudoaneurysm with destruction of the fourth and 
fifth thoracic vertebrae (T4-T5). We suspected that the pseudoaneurysm was due 
to direct extension of tuberculous vertebral osteomyelitis. The patient was 
managed with antituberculous chemotherapy. The post-antitubercular therapy 
course was uneventful and he remained well 12 months after completion of 
treatment.

In this work, a novel electrochemical biosensor is developed for facile and 
highly sensitive detection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) based on collaboration of 
dual enzymes for multiple-stages signal amplification. Through ingenious design, 
the specific recognition of target LPS is transformed to the exonuclease III 
(Exo III)-assisted interface DNA cycling collaborated with the terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-catalyzed DNA extension, finally inducing 
significant electrochemical signal concerned with the concentration of LPS. This 
paper mainly discusses the detection principle, optimization of key factors, and 
the analytical performance of the biosensor. With the efficient signal 
amplification, the biosensor shows high sensitivity with a good linearity and a 
low limit of detection of 1 pg mL-1 for LPS. Moreover, the developed biosensor 
can clearly discriminate LPS from interferents and show high specificity for LPS 
detection. This biosensor has also been successfully employed to measure LPS in 
real food samples, suggesting potential opportunity for application in food 
safety detection.

Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) now have an increased life expectancy, due 
to advances in care provided by a multidisciplinary team. The care model has 
expanded over time to include multiple subspecialties. The Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation conducted a survey of Care Center Directors and identified a need for 
pediatric and adult gastroenterologists with expertise in the diagnosis and 
treatment of intestinal, pancreatic and hepatic complications of CF. To address 
this need, the Developing Innovative GastroEnterology Specialty Training 
(DIGEST) program was created. The development, implementation, and early results 
of this training program are reported herein.

A focus in recent decades has involved examining the potential causal impact of 
educational attainment (schooling years) on a variety of disease and 
life-expectancy outcomes. Numerous studies have broadly revealed a link 
suggesting that as years of formal schooling increase so too does health and 
wellbeing; however, it is unclear whether the associations are causal. Here we 
use Mendelian randomization, an instrumental variables technique, with a 
two-sample design, to probe whether more years of schooling are causally linked 
to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 10 of its attendant risk factors. The results 
revealed a protective effect of more schooling years against T2D (odds 
ratio = 0.39; 95% confidence interval: 0.26, 0.58; P = 3.89 × 10-06), which in 
turn might be partly mediated by more years of schooling being protective 
against the following: having a father with T2D, being overweight, having higher 
blood pressure and higher levels of circulating triglycerides, and having lower 
levels of HDL cholesterol. More schooling years had no effect on risk for 
gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome and was associated with a 
decreased likelihood of moderate physical activity. These findings imply that 
strategies to retain adults in higher education may help reduce the risk for a 
major source of metabolic morbidity and mortality.

PURPOSE: Self-regulation in eating is significant for enhancing life expectancy 
of people with cystic fibrosis (CF), but research with this population is 
scarce.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, adults with CF completed a number of 
psychometric scales exploring typical eating behaviours that may increase 
calorific intake including motivations to eat palatable foods and scales that 
may be associated with decreased calorific intake: mindfulness, mindful eating 
and self-compassion.
RESULTS: Findings suggested that motivations to eat palatable foods and eating 
behaviours correlate with higher BMI, while mindfulness, mindful eating and 
self-compassion did not reach significance. Mindfulness and mindful eating 
moderated the relationship between emotional eating and BMI, while 
self-compassion did not moderate this relationship.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to develop healthy and effective means of enhancing 
calorific intake, where this is indicated, adapting mindful eating principles to 
focus on increasing both self-regulation and pleasure in eating while reducing 
emotional eating may be one means of doing this.

Embryo experimentation: is there a case for moving beyond the '14-day rule'.

Castelyn G(1).

grant.castelyn@hdr.mq.edu.au.

Recent scientific advances have indicated that it may be technically feasible to 
sustain human embryos in vitro beyond 14 days. Research beyond this stage is 
currently restricted by a guideline known as the 14-day rule. Since the advances 
in embryo culturing there have been calls to extend the current limit. Much of 
the current debate concerning an extension has regarded the 14-day rule as a 
political compromise and has, therefore, focused on policy concerns rather than 
assessing the philosophical foundations of the limit. While there are relevant 
political considerations, I maintain that the success of extension arguments 
will ultimately depend on the strength of the justifications supporting the 
current 14-day limit. I argue that the strongest and most prevalent 
justifications for the 14-day rule-an appeal to individuation and neural 
development-do not provide adequate support for the limit of 14 days. I instead 
suggest that an alternative justification based on sentience would constitute a 
more defensible basis for embryo protection and that a consideration of such 
grounds appears to support an amendment to the current limit, rather than the 
retention of it. While these conclusions do not establish conclusively that the 
current limit should be extended; they do suggest that an extension may be 
warranted and permissible. As such, this paper offers grounds on which a 
reassessment of the 14-day rule may be justified.

In this study, preparation of a solid-phase microextraction fiber of 
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer in its blends with polystyrene (PS) via 
electrospinning process, on a stainless steel wire has been reported. The 
electrospining enhancement of PDMS solutions in the presence of PS is found due 
to the increase in the viscosity of the mixed solutions. Characteristics of the 
fibers were inspected by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron 
microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The applicability of 
the coating was assessed for headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) of 
some residual solvents (Diethyl Ether, Toluene and Chloroform) from biological 
products (Anti venin and Foot-and-mouth disease vaccine) followed by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry. The effects of extraction time and 
temperature, desorption time and temperature, agitation rate and ionic strength 
on the extraction efficiency were investigated. Under optimized conditions, 
limits of detection in the range of 2-10 µg L-1 and limits of quantification in 
the range of 10-50 µg L-1 were obtained. The method showed linearity in a wide 
range with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.99. In addition, the 
obtained inter-day and intra-day precisions were in the range of 1.57-8.28% and 
4.87-11.72%, respectively. The thermal stability of the fiber was also 
investigated and it was found to be durable at 230 °C for 450 min. Furthermore, 
the proposed method was successfully applied for quantification of chloroform in 
Foot-and-mouth disease vaccine and diethyl ether and toluene in Anti-venin with 
recoveries in the range of 78.84-123.01%.

BACKGROUND: Detection of cystic lesions of the pancreas has outpaced our ability 
to stratify low-grade cystic lesions from those at greater risk for pancreatic 
cancer, raising a concern for overtreatment.
METHODS: We developed a Markov decision model to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of guideline-based management for asymptomatic pancreatic 
cysts. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained and survival were 
calculated for current management guidelines. A sensitivity analysis estimated 
the effect on cost-effectiveness and mortality if overtreatment of low-grade 
cysts is avoided, and the sensitivity and specificity thresholds required of 
methods of cyst stratification to improve costs expended.
RESULTS: "Surveillance" using current management guidelines had an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $171,143/quality adjusted life year compared with no 
surveillance or operative treatment ("do nothing"). An incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for surveillance decreases to $80,707/quality adjusted 
life year if the operative overtreatment of low-grade cysts was avoided. 
Assuming a societal willingness-to-pay of $100,000/quality adjusted life year, 
the diagnostic specificity for high-risk cysts must be >67% for surveillance to 
be preferred over surgery and "do nothing." Changes in sensitivity alone cannot 
make surveillance cost-effective. Most importantly, survival in surveillance is 
worse than "do nothing" for 3 years after cyst diagnosis, although long-term 
survival is improved. The disadvantage is eliminated when overtreatment of 
low-grade cysts is avoided.
CONCLUSION: Current management of pancreatic cystic lesions is not 
cost-effective and may increase mortality owing to overtreatment of low-grade 
cysts. The specificity for risk stratification for high-risk cysts must be 
greater than 67% to make surveillance cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery in 
the older adult population is a matter of debate; although radiation therapy was 
shown to benefit these patients concerning local disease control, the absolute 
benefit was small and potentially negligible. Partial breast irradiation has 
been introduced as an alternative treatment approach for low-risk patients. 
Older adult patients with early breast cancer constitute a unique population 
with regards to prognosis and potential comorbidities, thus minimizing treatment 
to maintain health-related quality of life (HRQoL) without compromising survival 
is extremely important. Estimates of the patient's risk of benefit and/or harm 
with treatment should be performed together with an assessment of baseline 
comorbidities, life expectancy, and care preferences. Published data suggest 
that radiation therapy or endocrine therapy alone resulted in excellent disease 
control in older women with early breast cancer, and that the combination of 
both treatments has less incremental benefit than expected. Conversely, the 
toxicity profile of endocrine therapy is well known, often significantly 
impacting long term HRQoL of these potentially frail patients.
METHODS: Patients older than 70  years receiving breast conserving surgery with 
T1N0, Luminal A-like tumors will be randomized to receive partial breast 
irradiation-alone or endocrine therapy-alone. The main objectives are to 
determine patient reported outcome measures in terms of HRQoL, as assessed by 
the EORTC QLQ-C30 using the global health status of patients, and to demonstrate 
a non-inferior local control rate between arms. Secondary endpoints are 
represented by individual scales from QLQ-C30 and module QLQ-BR45 scores; ELD14 
questionnaire; geriatric COre DatasEt assessment; distant control rate, adverse 
events rates, breast cancer specific, and overall survival.
DISCUSSION: The EUROPA trial is a new randomized trial focused on older adults 
(≥70  years) affected by good prognosis primary breast cancer. Our assumption is 
that postoperative radiation therapy-alone avoids the long-term toxicity of 
endocrine therapy and favorably impacts on HRQoL in this population. In the 
current report we present the trial's background and methods, focusing on 
perspectives in the field of precision medicine.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered with ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier 
NCT04134598 / EUROPA trial.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in devastating effects on function and 
quality of life. The majority of SCIs occur in the cervical region with 
restoration of arm and hand function being the highest priority by patients. 
Current restoration strategies rely on maximizing and optimally redistributing 
residual muscle functions that remain under volitional control. The polio 
epidemic and World Wars led to the development and refinement of tendon 
transfers, which has long been the standard reconstructive approach for the 
upper extremity following SCI. However, the past few decades has seen the 
emergence of nerve transfers from a "salvage" procedure for the management of 
peripheral nerve injuries, to a powerful reconstructive tool following SCI. 
Nerve transfers offer distinct advantages over tendon transfers; however, 
optimal functional recovery frequently benefits from a multi-modality approach 
and must be tailored to specific injury patterns. Extension of nerve transfers 
to the lower body presents additional hurdles such as limited donor nerve 
sources and much longer target distances. In this review, we will discuss the 
evolution of nerve transfers for upper extremity reanimation following cervical 
SCI and discuss advantages over tendon transfers. We will address the progress 
for nerve transfers to restore lower body function, including ambulation and 
bladder control. Finally, we will address future efforts in the field. 
Reconstructive modalities, including nerve and tendon transfers, remain 
underutilized following SCI and it is important that these therapeutic options 
are made known to the research community, medical providers, and patients.

CONTEXT: Advance care planning is essential to enable informed medical decisions 
to be made and to reduce aggressiveness in end-of-life (EOL) care.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore whether a question prompt list (QPL) 
adapted to French language and culture could promote discussions, particularly 
on prognosis and EOL issues, among advanced cancer patients attending outpatient 
palliative care (PC) consultations.
METHODS: In this multicenter randomized study, patients assigned to the 
intervention arm received a QPL to help them prepare for the next consultation 
one month later. The main inclusion criteria were advanced cancer patients 
referred to the PC team with an estimated life expectancy of less than one year. 
The primary endpoint was the number of questions raised, globally and by topic. 
The secondary objectives were the impact of the QPL on psychological symptoms, 
quality of life, satisfaction with care, and coping styles at two months.
RESULTS: Patients (n = 71) in the QPL arm asked more questions (mean 21.8 vs. 
18.2, P = 0.03) than patients in the control arm (n = 71), particularly on PC 
(5.6 vs. 3.7, P = 0.012) and EOL issues (2.2 vs. 1, P = 0.018) but not on 
prognosis (4.3 vs. 3.6, not specified). At two months, there was no change in 
anxiety, depression, or quality of life in either arm; patient satisfaction with 
doctors' technical skills was scored higher (P = 0.024), and avoidance coping 
responses were less frequent (self-distraction, P = 0.015; behavioral 
disengagement, P = 0.025) in the QPL arm.
CONCLUSION: Questions on PC and EOL issues in outpatient PC consultations were 
more frequent, and patient satisfaction was better when a QPL was made available 
before the consultation.

Extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) is an aggressive cancer that 
remains very hard to treat. The life expectancy of a patient diagnosed with this 
disease has not changed over the past three decades. Recently, three large 
clinical studies showed a survival benefit by adding an anti-programmed death 
(ligand) 1 (PD-(L)1 antibody to the current chemotherapy regimen. Although 
significant and important, the benefit seems less than what has been achieved in 
patients with non-small-cell lung cancer treated with chemoimmunotherapy. A 
number of hypotheses have been explored to explain this discrepancy. Here, we 
hypothesise that the current chemotherapy backbone in ES-SCLC does not contain 
the optimal drugs to trigger immunogenic cell death and therefore does not 
induce a synergy between chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 
Thereby, we advocate that doxorubicin treatment instead of etoposide should be 
reconsidered as standard-of-care (SoC) first-line treatment of SCLC.

OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of initiating 
tocilizumab (TCZ) ± methotrexate (MTX) versus initiating MTX as treat-to-target 
treatment strategies over 5 years in early disease-modifying antirheumatic drug 
(DMARD)-naïve rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Data on resource use were collected with questionnaires at baseline, 3, 
6, 12, and 24 months, and yearly thereafter, and were converted to costs using 
Dutch reference prices. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were calculated using 
the EQ5D5L, with utility based on Dutch tariff or estimated by the Health 
Assessment Questionnaire. To account for missing cost data and QALY data and for 
sample uncertainty, first bootstraps (10,000 samples) were obtained. Second, 
single imputation using chained equations nested within these bootstrap samples 
was performed. An economic evaluation was performed for TCZ + MTX and TCZ, 
compared to MTX, as initial treatment in a treat-to-target strategy from a 
healthcare and societal perspective over 5 years. Several sensitivity analyses 
were performed.
RESULTS: Mean differences in QALY were small and not significant (TCZ + MTX vs 
MTX: 0.06, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.13; TCZ vs. MTX: -0.03, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.11). 
Limited savings in indirect nonhealthcare costs and productivity loss costs (for 
TCZ only) were observed, but these did not compensate for the higher medication 
costs. Sensitivity analyses did not materially change these findings, although 
lower-priced TCZ, or reserving TCZ as initial therapy for prognostically 
unfavorable RA patients, improved cost effectiveness considerably but did not 
individually lead to a strategy being cost effective.
CONCLUSION: Based on our analyses, early initiation of TCZ + MTX is not cost 
effective compared to MTX initiation in a step-up treat-to-target treatment 
strategy over 5 years in early RA patients.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advances in medical care and preventive measures have 
contributed to increasing life expectancy. Therefore, it is critical to expand 
our understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological adaptations of the 
hematological system in aging. We highlight and review the findings from recent 
investigations aimed at understanding the effects of aging on megakaryocytes and 
platelets.
RECENT FINDINGS: Biochemical and transcriptomic studies of megakaryocytes and 
platelets from older humans and mice have advanced our understanding of the 
molecular and functional characteristics of megakaryocytes and platelets during 
aging. These studies have led to the identification of metabolic and 
inflammatory pathways associated with the generation of hyperreactive platelets 
that may significantly contribute to the high incidence of thrombosis in aging.
SUMMARY: By increasing our research efforts to understand and identify the 
characteristics of megakaryocytes and platelets in aging, we will increase our 
potential to develop novel therapies aimed at decreasing the incidence of 
aging-associated thrombosis. These efforts will also serve as a foundation to 
better understand the role of megakaryocytes and platelets in other age-related 
hematological conditions with high thrombotic risk such as clonal hematopoiesis 
of indeterminate potential and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

There is limited data on the cost-effectiveness of continuous-flow left 
ventricular assist devices (LVAD) in the United States particularly for the 
bridge-to-transplant indication. Our objective is to study the 
cost-effectiveness of a small intrapericardial centrifugal LVAD compared with 
medical management (MM) and subsequent heart transplantation using the 
respective clinical trial data. We developed a Markov economic framework. 
Clinical inputs for the LVAD arm were based on prospective trials employing the 
HeartWare centrifugal-flow ventricular assist device system. To better assess 
survival in the MM arm, and in the absence of contemporary trials randomizing 
patients to LVAD and MM, estimates from the Seattle Heart Failure Model were 
used. Costs inputs were calculated based on Medicare claim analyses and when 
appropriate prior published literature. Time horizon was lifetime. Costs and 
benefits were appropriately discounted at 3% per year. The deterministic 
cost-effectiveness analyses resulted in $69,768 per Quality Adjusted Life Year 
and $56,538 per Life Year for the bridge-to-transplant indication and $102,587 
per Quality Adjusted Life Year and $87,327 per Life Year for destination 
therapy. These outcomes signify a substantial improvement compared with prior 
studies and re-open the discussion around the cost-effectiveness of LVADs.

Years of life lost due to malignant neoplasms of the digestive system in Poland 
during 10 years of socioeconomic transformation.

Poland.

The aim of the study was to analyse years of life lost due to selected malignant 
neoplasms of the digestive system (colorectum, stomach, and pancreas) in Poland, 
a post-communist country in Central Europe, according to socioeconomic 
variables: sex, age, level of education, marital status, working status, and 
place of residence. The study included a dataset comprising death certificates 
of Polish citizens from 2002 (N = 359 486) and 2011 (N = 375 501). The data on 
deaths caused by malignant neoplasms of the digestive system, that is, coded as 
C15-C26 according to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, was analyzed. The standard expected 
years of life lost meter was used to calculate years of life lost. In 2002, 
malignant neoplasms of the digestive system caused 25 024 deaths among Polish 
citizens (7.0% of all deaths), which translated into a premature loss of 
494 442.1 years of life (129.4 years per 10 000 people). In 2011, the number of 
deaths increased to 26 537 (7.1% of all deaths) and the number of years of life 
lost rose to 499 804.0 (129.7 years per 10 000). The most important causes of 
mortality and years of life lost were colorectal, stomach, and pancreatic 
cancers. In both studied years, the socioeconomic features with an adverse 
effect on years of life lost due to each considered malignant neoplasm of the 
digestive system included male gender, lower than secondary education, widowed 
marital status, economic inactivity, living in urban areas. Years of life lost 
analysis constitutes a valuable part of epidemiological assessment of health 
inequalities in society. It appears that the observed inequalities may have many 
causes; however, further research is needed to better understand their full 
extent.
