BACKGROUND: The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare X-linked recessive 
immunodeficiency disorder, caused by mutations in the WAS protein (WASP) gene 
and characterised by thrombocytopenia, small platelets, eczema, and recurrent 
infections associated with increased risk of autoimmunity and malignancy 
disorders. The gene for WAS has been mapped to the short arm of the X chromosome 
at Xp 11.22-23 and early detection of patients and diagnosis of new mutation 
might reduce related complications and increase their life expectancy.
METHOD AND RESULT: We found a novel mutation by sequence analysis of genomic DNA 
coding of a 9-month old boy suffering from WAS. The mutation was insertion G in 
exon 10 of WASP gene. The consequence of the G insertion is a premature stop 
immediately at amino acid 335 (N335X or p.G334GfsX1) and truncated protein.
CONCLUSION: The mutation analysis is helpful for the diagnosis of WAS patients 
and also expanding the spectrum of WASP mutations for carrier detection and 
prenatal diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement is performed to mitigate 
the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) when anticoagulation is contraindicated or 
ineffective. Technical advances now allow catheter-based filter retrieval. Many 
believe the benefits of retrieval are self-evident, yet retrieval carries an 
inherent complication risk and cost. The purpose of this study was to 
quantitatively weigh the risks and benefits of IVC filter retrieval using formal 
decision analysis.
METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was used to simulate two clinical 
scenarios: to leave a previously placed IVC filter or to retrieve it. Analysis 
was performed during the lifetime of the individual, and outcomes were expressed 
in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The base case is a 60-year-old man with 
a filter placed within 3 months who no longer requires mechanical 
thromboprophylaxis. Potential events included PE, filter complications, and 
death from all other causes during each cycle. Tolls were used to incorporate 
the disutility of short-term treatment for PE and filter complications. For the 
base case and sensitivity analyses, we used utilities and probabilities derived 
from the literature.
RESULTS: In the base case scenario, leaving the filter in place was preferred to 
filter retrieval, yielding 22.3 vs 21.9 QALYs. One-way sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that filter retrieval may be preferable if the utility of living 
with a filter is <0.98. For all probabilities of retrieval and PE mortality, 
leaving the filter in place is preferred.
CONCLUSIONS: Leaving a previously placed IVC filter provides a 0.4 QALY benefit 
over retrieving the filter for the average patient. This decision is sensitive 
to the utility of living with the IVC filter.

BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the increase in life expectancy (LE) globally 
is coupled with a postponement of morbidity and disability. Evidence on trends 
and determinants of disability-free life expectancies (DFLEs) are available in 
high-income countries but less in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This 
study examines the levels of and inequalities in LE, disability and DFLE between 
men and women across different age groups aged 50 years and over in six 
countries with developing economies.
METHODS: This study utilised the cross-sectional data (n=32 724) from the WHO 
Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, 
the Russian Federation and South Africa in 2007-2010. Disability was measured 
with the activity of daily living (ADL) instrument. The DFLE was estimated using 
the Sullivan method based on the standard period life table and ADL-disability 
proportions.
RESULTS: The disability prevalence ranged from 13% in China to 54% in India. The 
prevalence of disability was highest and occurred at younger age in both sexes 
in India. Women were more disadvantaged with higher prevalence of disability 
across all age groups, and the situation was worst among older women in Mexico 
and the Russian Federation. Though women had higher LE, their proportion of 
remaining LE free from disability was lower than men.
CONCLUSIONS: There are inequalities in the levels of disability and DFLE among 
men and women in different age groups among people aged over 50 years in these 
six countries. Countermeasures to decrease intercountry and gender gaps in DFLE, 
including improvements in health promotion and healthcare distribution, with a 
gender equity focus, are needed.

Investing in Health to Create a Third Demographic Dividend.

Fried LP(1).

The world is aging as a result of unprecedented successes worldwide adding 30 
years of life expectancy and presenting great opportunities for all of society, 
but only if we invest effectively. This article, written as a requested 
background article for the World Health Organization 2015 World Report on Aging, 
proposes that creating health into the oldest ages could lay the basis for a 
third demographic dividend resulting from the societal benefits from the 
generative social capital of older adults, on top of the second demographic 
dividend's savings associated with longer lives. The combination would 
contribute to stronger and wealthier societies, greater success of the young, 
and increased societal ability to provide the humane supports needed at the end 
of life, plus a dividend that would endure. We now know that prevention works at 
every age and into the oldest ages. A life-course approach to prevention and 
health promotion is the key investment. The creation of geriatrically 
knowledgeable and integrated public health, medical and social care systems has 
the potential to amplify capabilities and well-being to the end of life. Healthy 
older populations bring both desire for engagement and unique talents. 
Institutions designed to create impactful roles for older adults to contribute 
to the success of the young can activate the societal benefits and further 
enhance health at older ages. Creating a new vision for the opportunities of an 
older age is the first critical step toward experiencing the benefits of our 
longer lives and creating a sustained third demographic dividend.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Social and scientific discourses on healthy ageing and on 
health equity are increasingly available, yet from a global perspective limited 
conceptual and analytical work connecting both has been published. This review 
was done to inform the WHO World Report on Ageing and Health and to inform and 
encourage further work addressing both healthy aging and equity.
DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an extensive literature review on the overlap 
between both topics, privileging publications from 2005 onward, from low-, 
middle-, and high-income countries. We also reviewed evidence generated around 
the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, applicable to ageing and 
health across the life course.
RESULTS: Based on data from 194 countries, we highlight differences in older 
adults' health and consider three issues: First, multilevel factors that 
contribute to differences in healthy ageing, across contexts; second, policies 
or potential entry points for action that could serve to reduce unfair 
differences (health inequities); and third, new research areas to address the 
cause of persistent inequities and gaps in evidence on what can be done to 
increase healthy ageing and health equity.
IMPLICATIONS: Each of these areas warrant in depth analysis and synthesis, 
whereas this article presents an overview for further consideration and action.

Nephropathic cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease 
characterized by accumulation of cystine into lysosomes secondary to mutations 
in the cystine lysosomal transporter, cystinosin. The defect initially causes 
proximal tubular dysfunction (Fanconi syndrome) which in time progresses to 
end-stage renal disease. Cystinotic patients treated with the cystine-depleting 
agent, cysteamine, have improved life expectancy, delayed progression to chronic 
renal failure, but persistence of Fanconi syndrome. Here, we have investigated 
the role of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of the 
autophagy-lysosomal pathway, in conditionally immortalized proximal tubular 
epithelial cells derived from the urine of a healthy volunteer or a cystinotic 
patient. Lack of cystinosin reduced TFEB expression and induced TFEB nuclear 
translocation. Stimulation of endogenous TFEB activity by genistein, or 
overexpression of exogenous TFEB lowered cystine levels within 24 hours in 
cystinotic cells. Overexpression of TFEB also stimulated delayed endocytic cargo 
processing within 24 hours. Rescue of other abnormalities of the lysosomal 
compartment was observed but required prolonged expression of TFEB. These 
abnormalities could not be corrected with cysteamine. Thus, these data show that 
the consequences of cystinosin deficiency are not restricted to cystine 
accumulation and support the role of TFEB as a therapeutic target for the 
treatment of lysosomal storage diseases, in particular of cystinosis.

Failure in O-glycan chain extension exposing Tn antigen (GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr) is 
clinically associated with cancer metastasis. This study provides evidence of a 
functional role for aberrant GalNAc-glycans in cancer cell capture from blood 
flow and/or adhesion to endothelium. Adhesion of breast cancer cells to human 
umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers was modelled under sweeping flow. 
Adhesion of metastatic, GalNAc glycan-rich, MCF7 and ZR 75 1 cells to 
endothelium increased over timepoints up to 1.5 hour, after which it plateaued. 
Adhesion was significantly inhibited (p < 0.001) when cell surface 
GalNAc-glycans were masked, an effect not seen in GalNAc glycan-poor, 
non-metastatic BT 474 cells. Masking irrelevant galactose- and mannose-glycans 
had no inhibitory effect. Imaging of cells post-adhesion over a 24 hour time 
course using confocal and scanning electron microscopy revealed that up to 6 
hours post-adhesion, motile, rounded cancer cells featuring lamellipodia-like 
processes crawled on an intact endothelial monolayer. From 6-12 hours 
post-adhesion, cancer cells became stationary, adopted a smooth, circular 
flattened morphology, and endothelial cells retracted from around them leaving 
cleared zones in which the cancer cells proceeded to form colonies through cell 
division.

Strategic Planning in Population Health and Public Health Practice: A Call to 
Action for Higher Education.

POLICY POINTS: Scarce resources, especially in population health and public 
health practice, underlie the importance of strategic planning. Public health 
agencies' current planning and priority setting efforts are often narrow, at 
times opaque, and focused on single metrics such as cost-effectiveness. As 
demonstrated by SMART Vaccines, a decision support software system developed by 
the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Engineering, new 
approaches to strategic planning allow the formal incorporation of multiple 
stakeholder views and multicriteria decision making that surpass even those 
sophisticated cost-effectiveness analyses widely recommended and used for public 
health planning. Institutions of higher education can and should respond by 
building on modern strategic planning tools as they teach their students how to 
improve population health and public health practice.
CONTEXT: Strategic planning in population health and public health practice 
often uses single indicators of success or, when using multiple indicators, 
provides no mechanism for coherently combining the assessments. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis, the most complex strategic planning tool commonly 
applied in public health, uses only a single metric to evaluate programmatic 
choices, even though other factors often influence actual decisions.
METHODS: Our work employed a multicriteria systems analysis 
approach--specifically, multiattribute utility theory--to assist in strategic 
planning and priority setting in a particular area of health care (vaccines), 
thereby moving beyond the traditional cost-effectiveness analysis approach.
FINDINGS: (1) Multicriteria systems analysis provides more flexibility, 
transparency, and clarity in decision support for public health issues compared 
with cost-effectiveness analysis. (2) More sophisticated systems-level analyses 
will become increasingly important to public health as disease burdens increase 
and the resources to deal with them become scarcer.
CONCLUSIONS: The teaching of strategic planning in public health must be 
expanded in order to fill a void in the profession's planning capabilities. 
Public health training should actively incorporate model building, promote the 
interactive use of software tools, and explore planning approaches that 
transcend restrictive assumptions of cost-effectiveness analysis. The Strategic 
Multi-Attribute Ranking Tool for Vaccines (SMART Vaccines), which was recently 
developed by the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Engineering 
to help prioritize new vaccine development, is a working example of systems 
analysis as a basis for decision support.

Present study examined the influence of high-temperature stress and different 
biochar and phosphorus (P) fertilization treatments on the growth, grain yield 
and quality of two rice cultivars (IR-64 and Huanghuazhan). Plants were 
subjected to high day temperature-HDT (35 °C ± 2), high night temperature-HNT 
(32 °C ± 2), and control temperature-CT (28 °C ± 2) in controlled growth 
chambers. The different fertilization treatments were control, biochar alone, 
phosphorous (P) alone and biochar + P. High-temperature stress severely reduced 
the photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, and increased 
the leaf water potential of both rice cultivars. Grain yield and its related 
attributes except for number of panicles, were reduced under high temperature. 
The HDT posed more negative effects on rice physiological attributes, while HNT 
was more destructive for grain yield. High temperature stress also hampered the 
grain appearance and milling quality traits in both rice cultivars. The 
Huanghuazhan performed better than IR-64 under high-temperature stress with 
better growth and higher grain yield. Different soil fertilization treatments 
were helpful in ameliorating the detrimental effects of high temperature. 
Addition of biochar alone improved some growth and yield parameters but such 
positive effects were lower when compared with the combined application of 
biochar and P. The biochar+P application recorded 7% higher grain yield 
(plant(-1)) of rice compared with control averaged across different temperature 
treatments and cultivars. The highest grain production and better grain quality 
in biochar+P treatments might be due to enhanced photosynthesis, water use 
efficiency, and grain size, which compensated the adversities of high 
temperature stress.

The capacity for regeneration in the injured adult mammalian central nervous 
system (CNS) is largely limited by potent inhibitory barriers. Chondroitin 
sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are major inhibitors of axonal 
regeneration/sprouting and accumulate at lesion sites after CNS trauma. Despite 
extensive research during the two decades since their discovery, the molecular 
mechanisms remain elusive, including intracellular phosphorylation events. 
Collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4) is known to directly regulate 
cytoskeletal dynamics and neurite extension, while phosphorylated CRMP4 loses 
its binding affinity for cytoskeletal proteins. We have previously found that 
spinal cord injury (SCI) induces CRMP4 upregulation and phosphorylation and that 
CRMP4 knockout (Crmp4-/-) mice show behavioral recovery of locomotor function 
after SCI. However, the role of CRMP4 in the recovery of other forms of 
physiological function such as sensation remains largely unknown. We here have 
demonstrated CRMP4 involvement in CSPG-induced inhibitory signaling and 
nociceptive recovery in Crmp4-/- mice after SCI. We cultured dorsal root 
ganglion (DRG) neurons on CSPG-coated dishes; Crmp4 deletion overrode 
CSPG-induced inhibition of axon growth in vitro. CRMP4 levels were increased in 
DRGs in vivo after SCI. Crmp4-/- mice exhibited axonal growth of sensory neurons 
and recovery of nociceptive function after spinal transection. These results 
support Crmp4 deletion as a therapeutic target in the treatment of SCI.

From yeast to human: exploring the comparative biology of methionine restriction 
in extending eukaryotic life span.

Methionine restriction is a widely reported intervention for increasing life 
span in several model organisms. Low circulating levels of methionine are 
evident in the long-lived naked mole-rat, suggesting that it naturally presents 
with a life-extending phenotype akin to that observed in methionine-restricted 
animals. Similarly, long-lived dwarf mice also appear to have altered methionine 
metabolism. The mechanisms underlying methionine-restriction effects on 
life-span extension, however, remain unknown, as do their potential connections 
with caloric restriction, another well-established intervention for prolonging 
life span. Paradoxically, methionine is enriched in proteins expressed in 
mitochondria and may itself serve an important role in the detoxification of 
reactive oxygen species and may thereby contribute to delayed aging. 
Collectively, we highlight the evidence that modulation of the methionine 
metabolic network can extend life span-from yeast to humans-and explore the 
evidence that sulfur amino acids and the concomitant transsulfuration pathway 
play a privileged role in this regard. However, systematic studies in single 
organisms (particularly those that exhibit extreme longevity) are still required 
to distinguish the fundamental principles concerning the role of methionine and 
other amino acids in regulating life span.

The major compounds in Mentha piperita essential oil (EOMP) were menthol 
(33.59%) and iso-menthone (33%). The biopreservative effect of EOMP used alone 
at 0.25 or 0.5% and in combination with the semi-purified bacteriocin BacTN635 
at 500 or 1000AU/g, on minced beef meat was evaluated by microbiological, 
physicochemical and sensory analyses during storage at 4°C for 21days. EOMP used 
alone limited the microbial deterioration of minced meat (P<0.05). Furthermore, 
the combination between EOMP and BacTN635 led to a decrease in TBARS values and 
slowed down the accumulation of MetMb. This combination was more efficient 
(P<0.05) against microflora proliferation and enhanced the sensory acceptability 
extending thus the shelf life of meat beef by approximately 7days. On the basis 
of these results, physicochemical and sensorial parameters could be used for 
constructing regression models to predict overall acceptability. Overall, the 
strongest preservative effect was achieved by using the combination of EOMP at 
0.5% with BacTN535 at 1000AU/g.

[Comparative clinical analysis of histological systems of adrenocortical tumors 
diagnosis].

[Article in Russian]

Bokhyan VY, Stilidi IS, Pavlovskaya AI.

Differential diagnosis of adrenocortical cancer (ACC) and cortical adenoma 
presents certain difficulties since there is no specific histological criterion 
allowing to distinguish tumors of the adrenal cortex with malignant clinical 
course. Currently there are offered several systems, and the most widely spread 
have the index Weiss (IW) and the modified index Weiss (MIW). The accuracy of 
one or another of the proposed systems remains a matter of debate. There was 
analyzed own experience on the use of IW and MIW in the diagnosis of 91 cases of 
the ACC and 13 cases of cortex adenomas of the size at least 5 cm. For the 
diagnosis of large adenomas sensitivity IW was 77%, MIW--100%. For the diagnosis 
of metastatic and non-metastatic ACC--100% and 97%, 100% and 86%, respectively 
(p > 0.05). In multivariate analysis of life expectancy of patients the 
definition of IW and MIW had a prognostic significance. MIW was less subjective, 
more simple and convenient to be used and it showed a great informative value at 
the reclassification of certain "adenomas" into ACC. However to use it on their 
own, without IW, was impractical as MIW had wider gray area and did not reach 
the threshold value in some cases of ACC. For the diagnosis of tumors of the 
adrenal cortex IW remains a standard; when a value was equal of 2 or in cases of 
doubt it was necessary to calculate MIW as well.

The uses of fluorescent reporters derived from green fluorescent protein have 
proved invaluable for the visualisation of biological processes in bacteria 
grown under aerobic conditions. However, their requirement for oxygen has 
limited their application in obligate anaerobes such as Clostridium difficile. 
Fluorescent proteins derived from Light, Oxygen or Voltage sensing (LOV) domains 
have been shown to bridge this limitation, but their utility as translational 
fusions to monitor protein expression and localisation in a strict anaerobic 
bacterium has not been reported. Here we demonstrate the utility of phiLOV in 
three species of Clostridium and its application as a marker of real-time 
protein translation and dynamics through genetic fusion with the cell division 
protein, FtsZ. Time lapse microscopy of dividing cells suggests that Z ring 
assembly arises through the extension of the FtsZ arc starting from one point on 
the circumference. Furthermore, through incorporation of phiLOV into the 
flagella subunit, FliC, we show the potential of bacterial LOV-based fusion 
proteins to be successfully exported to the extracellular environment.

BACKGROUND: Pulsed light (PL) treatments stand as an alternative for the 
shelf-life extension of fresh-cut products. The antimicrobial effects of PL are 
well known; however, its influence on quality attributes needs to be assessed. 
This study was aimed at evaluating the application of PL treatments in 
combination with pectin-based edible coatings enriched with dietary fiber for 
the preservation of fresh-cut apples.
RESULTS: Dipping of fresh-cut apples in ascorbic acid/calcium chloride solution 
prior to pectin coating and PL treatments was effective to minimize browning and 
softening of apple surfaces. Incorporation of fiber in the pectin coating did 
not cause any change in microbial loads and sensory acceptability of apple 
cubes. Pectin-coated PL-treated apple pieces exhibited significantly higher 
antioxidant activity values than fresh and PL control samples. At the end of 
storage, the combination of both treatments resulted in an almost 2 log CFU g-1 
reduction of microbial counts. Sensory attribute scores did not fall below the 
rejection limit throughout 14 days, although the presence of off-odors limited 
the acceptability of the pectin-coated samples.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that PL treatments applied to pectin-coated 
fresh-cut apples may be used to maintain quality attributes, thus conferring 
prebiotic potential and extending the shelf-life of the product. © 2016 Society

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy. 
Although it can affect different organs, the bone compartment stands out both in 
terms of prevalence and clinical impact. Despite the striking advances in MM 
therapy, bone disease can remarkably affect the patient's quality of life. The 
occurrence and extension of bone marrow and extra-medullary involvement should 
be carefully assessed to confirm the diagnosis, to locate and whenever possible 
prevent dreadful complications such as pathological fractures and spinal cord 
compression, and to establish suitable therapeutic measures. Many imaging 
techniques have been proposed for the detection of MM skeletal involvement. With 
the development of more sophisticated imaging tools, it is time to use the right 
technique at the right time. Based on the review of the literature and our own 
experience, this article discusses advantages and disadvantages of the different 
imaging methods in the work-up of MM patients, with particular emphasis on the 
role that PET/CT can play. It is emphasized that whole body low-dose computed 
tomography should be the preferred imaging technique at baseline. However, bone 
marrow infiltration and extra-medullary manifestations are better detected by 
whole body magnetic resonance imaging. Positron emission tomography/computed 
tomography, on the other hand, combines the benefits of the two mentioned 
imaging procedures and is particularly useful not only for the detection of 
osteolytic lesions unrevealed by conventional X-ray, but also in the assessment 
of prognosis and therapeutic response.

Microalbuminuria (MAU) is an early marker of diabetic nephropathy (DN), which 
accounts for a significant reduction in life expectancy of diabetic patients. 
The progression of DN from the appearance of clinical proteinuria to end stage 
renal failure is usually irreversible. Increased levels of urinary albumin 
secretion may represent a more generalized vascular damage. This is the first 
study conducted in Iraq to determine the prevalence and potential risk factors 
of MAU among Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. A cross-sectional study 
was conducted on a systematic random sample of 224 eligible T2DM patients aged 
25-64 years attending a DM clinic in Baghdad. A questionnaire was developed to 
gather basic and clinical data, besides anthropometric measurements, and 
laboratory assessment of lipid profile, HbA1c, serum creatinine, albumin, and 
microalbumin/creatinin in urine. MAU was defined as albumin/creatinine ratio 
30-300 mg/g on two occasions. Only 36 cases (16.1%) had MAU. A statistical 
significant association found between MAU and educational level (P = 0.009), 
family history of hypertension (P = 0.024) and DN (P = 0.013), history of 
hypertension (P = 0.001), duration of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor 
drug intake in hypertensive patients (P = 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (P = 
0.014), and waist to hip ratio (P = 0.006). Logistic regression analyses 
revealed two independent risk factors influencing MAU: diastolic blood pressure 
[odds ratio (OR) = 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.007-1.118] and BMI (OR 
= 1.17, 95% CI: 1.037-1.220). The prevalence of MAU is not low among DM 
patients. Mandatory screening of all DM patients and amelioration of the 
assigned significant risk factors are recommended.

Hemophilia A, which is the most common form of hemophilia, is caused by a 
deficiency of clotting factor VIII. The incidence of hemophilia A is 1:10,000 
people worldwide. The most common complication associated with hemophilia A is 
bleeding into joints, predominantly the knees, ankles, and elbows, which may 
lead to destruction or osteoarthritis of the specific joint. Various degrees of 
disability may follow these initial or recurrent hemorrhages. Subsequent to 
improvements in medical management, patients with hemophilia A currently have a 
life expectancy similar to that of the normal population. However, the 
management of patients with hemophilia A remains a clinical challenge for 
various reasons, including the lack of reliable and cost-effective treatment, 
and the high risk of intra- or post-operative hemorrhages. Large hemorrhages due 
to the phlebotomizing of young patients are very rare. To the best of our 
knowledge, the present case is the first report regarding the occurrence of a 
large hemorrhage due to venipuncture in the elbow of a patient with hemophilia 
A, and discusses the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, and the 
medico-chirurgical treatment of this patient.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the long-term survival, health-related quality of life, 
and quality-adjusted life years of cancer patients admitted to ICUs.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort.
SETTING: Two cancer specialized ICUs in Brazil.
PATIENTS: A total of 792 participants.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The health-related quality of life before ICU 
admission; at 15 days; and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months was assessed with the 
EQ-5D-3L. In addition, the vital status was assessed at 24 months. The mean age 
of the subjects was 61.6 ± 14.3 years, 42.5% were female subjects and half were 
admitted after elective surgery. The mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 
was 47.4 ± 15.6. Survival at 12 and 18 months was 42.4% and 38.1%, respectively. 
The mean EQ-5D-3L utility measure before admission to the ICU was 0.47 ± 0.43, 
at 15 days it was 0.41 ± 0.44, at 90 days 0.56 ± 0.42, at 6 months 0.60 ± 0.41, 
at 12 months 0.67 ± 0.35, and at 18 months 0.67 ± 0.35. The probabilities for 
attaining 12 and 18 months of quality-adjusted survival were 30.1% and 19.1%, 
respectively. There were statistically significant differences in survival time 
and quality-adjusted life years according to all assessed baseline 
characteristics (ICU admission after elective surgery, emergency surgery, or 
medical admission; Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3; cancer extension; cancer 
status; previous surgery; previous chemotherapy; previous radiotherapy; 
performance status; and previous health-related quality of life). Only the 
previous health-related quality of life and performance status were associated 
with the health-related quality of life during the 18-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival, health-related quality of life, and 
quality-adjusted life year expectancy of cancer patients admitted to the ICU are 
limited. Nevertheless, these clinical outcomes exhibit wide variability among 
patients and are associated with simple characteristics present at the time of 
ICU admission, which may help healthcare professionals estimate patients' 
prognoses.

OBJECTIVE: To establishing whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by 
interval debulking surgery (IDS) is superior primary debulking surgery (PDS) in 
terms of clinical outcome as well as peri-operative morbidity in advanced 
epithelial ovarian cancer (AEOC) endowed with high tumour load (HTL).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a single-Institution, superiority, randomised 
phase III trial enrolling supposed AEOC women. Patients considered 
pre-operatively eligible were triaged to staging laparoscopy to assess the 
predictive index (PI) of tumour load. All AEOC women with PI≥8 or≤12 (considered 
as HTL) were included. They were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to undergo either 
PDS followed by systemic adjuvant chemotherapy (arm A, standard), or NACT 
followed by IDS (NACT/IDS) (arm B, experimental). Co-primary outcome measures 
were postoperative complications (graded according to the Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center surgical secondary events grading system) and 
progression free survival (PFS); secondary outcomes were overall survival, and 
quality of life (QoL). QoL was assessed using the EORTC QoL questionnaires. A 
sample size of 110 patients was required for the analysis of the first 
co-primary end-point (major peri-operative morbidity) whereas recruitment is 
still on-going to achieve the statistical power on PFS.
RESULTS: Between October 2011 and November 2014, we registered 280 AEOC. Of the 
110 eligible women, 55 were assigned to arm A and 55 to arm B. Despite different 
extension of surgery, rates of complete residual disease (residual tumour=0 cm) 
were superimposable between the groups (45.5% versus 57.7%; p=0.206). 
Twenty-nine patients (52.7%) in arm A experienced early grade III-IV 
complications versus three patients (5.7%) in IDS (p=0.0001). The most common 
complication was grade III and consisted of symptomatic pleural effusion 
requiring thoracic drainage (17/55 women (30.9%) in arm A versus 1/52 (1.9%) in 
arm B, p=0.0001). Three grade IV (5.4%) (i.e., two re-operations for 
postoperative haemorrhage and one septic multi-organ failure), and two grade V 
(3.6%) (two deaths for acute cardiopulmonary failure) early complications were 
observed in arm A only. Mean QoL scores of several scales/items were shown to 
ameliorate over time in both arms. Emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, 
nausea/vomiting, dyspnoea, insomnia and hair loss were statistically and 
clinically better in NACT/IDS compared to PDS arm.
CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative moderate/severe morbidity as well as QoL scores were 
shown to be more favourable in NACT/IDS arm than PDS in AEOC patients with very 
HTL. Completion of patient enrolment and analysis of survival data will clarify 
whether PDS with such a high rate of severe complications is an acceptable 
treatment in AEOC women with HTL.

Lung transplantation has become an accepted therapy in infants, children and 
adolescents suffering from end-stage lung diseases, an impaired quality of life 
as well as a reduced life expectancy. Within Europe, pediatric lung 
transplantation is largely performed in predominantly adult centers due to a 
relatively low overall case volume. Children do represent a specific and 
challenging cohort facing a transplant procedure, where the selection of 
potential candidates becomes a crucial step to maximize net survival benefit. 
Therefore, interdisciplinary evaluation and early listing in view of current 
indications and contraindications, adequate preoperative education of the child 
and family members, discussion of possibly required bridging procedures in case 
of deterioration, appropriate technical planning of the operation, adherence to 
postoperative medical treatment and follow-up are all crucial steps in this 
demanding puzzle. In this article, the authors review recent advances in the 
field of pediatric lung transplantation and outline challenges in the future.
