burden of ischaemic heart disease and IS was mainly in high SDI locations. The 
burden of DALYs and deaths in CVD was higher in men than women. In addition, the 
number and ASR of DALYs and deaths were highest in those over 80 years old.
CONCLUSION: Metabolic-attributed CVD threatens public health, especially in 
low-SDI locations and among the elderly. Low SDI location should strengthen the 
control of metabolic factors such as high SBP, high BMI, and high LDL-c and 
increase the knowledge of metabolic risk factors for CVD. Countries and regions 
should enhance screening and prevention of metabolic risk factors of CVD in the 
elderly. Policy-makers should use 2019 GBD data to guide cost-effective 
interventions and resource allocation.

BACKGROUND: Across Europe, socioeconomic inequalities in mortality are large and 
persistent. To better understand the drivers of past trends in socioeconomic 
mortality inequalities, we identified phases and potential reversals in 
long-term trends in educational inequalities in remaining life expectancy at age 
30 (e30), and assessed the contributions of mortality changes among the 
low-educated and the high-educated at different ages.
METHODS: We used individually linked annual mortality data by educational level 
(low, middle and high), sex and single age (30+) from 1971/1972 onwards for 
England and Wales, Finland and Italy (Turin). We applied segmented regression to 
trends in educational inequalities in e30 (e30 high-educated minus e30 
low-educated) and employed a novel demographic decomposition technique.
RESULTS: We identified several phases and breakpoints in the trends in 
educational inequalities in e30. The long-term increases (Finnish men, 
1982-2008; Finnish women, 1985-2017; and Italian men, 1976-1999) were driven by 
faster mortality declines among the high-educated aged 65-84, and by mortality 
increases among the low-educated aged 30-59. The long-term decreases (British 
men, 1976-2008, and Italian women, 1972-2003) were driven by faster mortality 
improvements among the low-educated than among the high-educated at age 65+. The 
recent stagnation of increasing inequality (Italian men, 1999) and reversals 
from increasing to decreasing inequality (Finnish men, 2008) and from decreasing 
to increasing inequality (British men, 2008) were driven by mortality trend 
changes among the low-educated aged 30-54.
CONCLUSION: Educational inequalities are plastic. Mortality improvements among 
the low-educated at young ages are imperative for achieving long-term decreases 
in educational inequalities in e30.

OBJECTIVE: Clinical breast cancer decision-making significantly affects life 
expectancy and management of hospital resources. The aims of the present study 
were to estimate the time of survival for breast cancer patients and to identify 
independent factors from healthcare delivery associated with survival rates in a 
specific health area of Northern of Spain.
METHODS: Survival analysis was conducted among a cohort of 2545 patients 
diagnosed with breast cancer between 2006 and 2012 from the population breast 
cancer registry of Asturias-Spain and followed up till 2019. Adjusted Cox 
proportional hazard models were used to identify the independent prognostic 
factors of all-cause from death.
RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate was 80%. Advanced age (>80 years) (hazard 
ratio, HR: 4.35; 95% confidence interval, CI: 3.41-5.54), hospitalization in 
small hospitals (HR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.09-1.97), treatment in oncology wards (HR: 
3.57; 95% CI: 2.41-5.27), and length of stay >30 days (HR: 2.24; 95% CI: 
1.32-3.79) were the main predictors of death. By contrast, breast cancer 
suspected via screening was associated with a lower risk of death (HR: 0.55; 95% 
CI: 0.35-0.87).
CONCLUSION: There is room for improvement in survival rates after breast cancer 
in the health area of Asturias (Northern of Spain). Some healthcare delivery 
factors, and other clinical characteristics of the tumor influence the survival 
of breast cancer patients. Strengthening population screening programs could be 
relevant to increasing survival rates.

Patients suffering from mental disorders are at high risk of developing 
cardiovascular diseases, leading to a reduction in life expectancy. Genetic 
variants can display greater influence on cardiometabolic features in 
psychiatric cohorts compared to the general population. The difference is 
possibly due to an intricate interaction between the mental disorder or the 
medications used to treat it and metabolic regulations. Previous genome wide 
association studies (GWAS) on antipsychotic-induced weight gain included a low 
number of participants and/or were restricted to patients taking one specific 
antipsychotic. We conducted a GWAS of the evolution of body mass index (BMI) 
during early (i.e., ≤ 6) months of treatment with psychotropic medications 
inducing metabolic disturbances (i.e., antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and some 
antidepressants) in 1135 patients from the PsyMetab cohort. Six highly 
correlated BMI phenotypes (i.e., BMI change and BMI slope after distinct 
durations of psychotropic treatment) were considered in the analyses. Our 
results showed that four novel loci were associated with altered BMI upon 
treatment at genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10-8): rs7736552 (near MAN2A1), 
rs11074029 (in SLCO3A1), rs117496040 (near DEFB1) and rs7647863 (in IQSEC1). 
Associations between the four loci and alternative BMI-change phenotypes showed 
consistent effects. Replication analyses in 1622 UK Biobank participants under 
psychotropic treatment showed a consistent association between rs7736552 and BMI 
slope (p = 0.017). These findings provide new insights into metabolic side 
effects induced by psychotropic drugs and underline the need for future studies 
to replicate these associations in larger cohorts.

Patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) have higher rates of relapse 
and pronounced decreases in daily functioning and health-related quality of life 
compared to patients with major depressive disorder who are not 
treatment-resistant, underscoring the need for treatment choices with sustained 
efficacy and long-term tolerability. Adults with TRD who participated in ≥1 of 6 
phase 3 "parent" studies could continue esketamine treatment, combined with an 
oral antidepressant, by enrolling in phase 3, open-label, long-term extension 
study, SUSTAIN-3. Based on their status at parent-study end, eligible 
participants entered a 4-week induction phase followed by an 
optimization/maintenance phase, or directly entered the optimization/maintenance 
phase of SUSTAIN-3. Intranasal esketamine dosing was flexible, twice-weekly 
during induction and individualized to depression severity during 
optimization/maintenance. At the interim data cutoff (01 December 2020), 1148 
participants were enrolled, 458 at induction and 690 at 
optimization/maintenance. Mean (median) cumulative duration of maintenance 
esketamine treatment was 31.5 (37.7) months (totaling 2769 cumulative 
patient-years). Common treatment-emergent adverse events (≥20%) were headache, 
dizziness, nausea, dissociation, somnolence, and nasopharyngitis. Mean 
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score decreased during 
induction, and this reduction persisted during optimization/maintenance (mean 
[SD] change from the baseline to the endpoint of each phase: induction -12.8 
[9.73]; optimization/maintenance +1.1 [9.93]), with 35.6% and 46.1% of 
participants in remission (MADRS total score ≤12) at induction and 
optimization/maintenance endpoints, respectively. Improvement in depression 
ratings generally persisted among participants who remained in maintenance 
treatment, and no new safety signal was identified during long-term treatment 
(up to 4.5 years) using intermittent-dosed esketamine in conjunction with daily 
antidepressant.

BACKGROUND: As populations age, cancer burden becomes increasingly conspicuous. 
This study quantified the cancer burden of the elderly (≥ 60 years) in China, 
based on the China Cancer Registry Annual Report to provide epidemiological 
evidence for cancer prevention and control.
METHODS: Data on cancer cases and deaths among the elderly aged ≥ 60 years were 
collected from the China Cancer Registry Annual Report, 2008-2019. Potential 
years of life lost (PYLL) and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were 
calculated to analyze fatalities and the non-fatal burden. The time trend was 
analyzed using the Joinpoint model.
RESULTS: From 2005 to 2016, the PYLL rate of cancer in the elderly was stable 
between 45.34‰ and 47.62‰, but the DALY rate for cancer decreased at an average 
annual rate of 1.18% (95% CI: 0.84-1.52%). The non-fatal cancer burden in the 
rural elderly was higher than that of the urban elderly. Lung, gastric, liver, 
esophageal, and colorectal cancers were the main cancers causing the cancer 
burden in the elderly, and accounted for 74.3% of DALYs. The DALY rate of lung 
cancer in females in the 60-64 age group increased (annual percentage change 
[APC] = 1.14%, 95% CI: 0.10-1.82%). Female breast cancer was one of the top five 
cancers in the 60-64 age group, with DALY rates that also increased 
(APC = 2.17%, 95% CI: 1.35-3.01%). With increasing age, the burden of liver 
cancer decreased, while that of colorectal cancer rose.
CONCLUSIONS: From 2005 to 2016, the cancer burden in the elderly in China 
decreased, mainly reflected in the non-fatal burden. Female breast and liver 
cancer were a more serious burden in the younger elderly, while colorectal 
cancer burden was mainly observed in the older elderly.

BACKGROUND: Annually 57 million people across the globe require palliative care, 
76% are from low- and-middle income countries. Continuity of palliative care 
contributes to a decline in emergency room visits., decreased hospital deaths, 
improved patient satisfaction, better utilization of services, and cost savings. 
Despite efforts made to develop the palliative care guideline in Ethiopia, the 
service is not yet organized and linked to primary health care. This study aimed 
to explore barriers to the continuum of palliative care from facility to 
household for cancer patients in Addis Ababa.
METHODS: Qualitative exploratory study was conducted with face-to-face 
interviews with a total of 25 participants. The study population was adult 
cancer patients, primary caregivers, healthcare providers, volunteers, and 
nationwide advocates. Data were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and finally 
imported to Open code version 4.02 software for coding and analysis. Thematic 
analysis was guided by Tanahashi's framework.
RESULTS: The key barriers to continuity of palliative care included opioid 
scarcity and turnover and shortage of healthcare workers. A shortfall of 
diagnostic materials, cost of medications, lack of government backing, and 
home-based center's enrollment capacity hampered accessibility. Care providers 
were instruments of cultural barriers in delivering appropriate end-of-life 
care, on the other hand, patients' preference for conventional medicine hindered 
acceptability. Lack of community volunteers, failure of health extension workers 
to link patients, and spatial limits fraught utilization. The lack of defined 
roles and services at several levels and the workload on healthcare 
professionals affected the effectiveness of the nexus.
CONCLUSION: The continuum of palliative care service from health facility to 
household in Ethiopia is yet in its infancy compromised by factors related to 
availability, accessibility, acceptability, utilization, and effectiveness. 
Further research is required to delineate the roles of various actors; the 
health sector should smudge out the continuum of palliation to cope with the 
growing need for palliative care.

Meat Irradiation: A Comprehensive Review of Its Impact on Food Quality and 
Safety.

Technology, Universitas Padjadjaran, Sumedang 45363, Indonesia.

Food irradiation is a proven method commonly used for enhancing the safety and 
quality of meat. This technology effectively reduces the growth of 
microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites. It also increases the 
lifespan and quality of products by delaying spoilage and reducing the growth of 
microorganisms. Irradiation does not affect the sensory characteristics of 
meats, including color, taste, and texture, as long as the appropriate dose is 
used. However, its influence on the chemical and nutritional aspects of meat is 
complex as it can alter amino acids, fatty acids, and vitamins as well as 
generate free radicals that cause lipid oxidation. Various factors, including 
irradiation dose, meat type, and storage conditions, influence the impact of 
these changes. Irradiation can also affect the physical properties of meat, such 
as tenderness, texture, and water-holding capacity, which is dose-dependent. 
While low irradiation doses potentially improve tenderness and texture, high 
doses negatively affect these properties by causing protein denaturation. This 
research also explores the regulatory and public perception aspects of food 
irradiation. Although irradiation is authorized and controlled in many 
countries, its application is controversial and raises concerns among consumers. 
Food irradiation is reliable for improving meat quality and safety but its 
implication on the chemical, physical, and nutritional properties of products 
must be considered when determining the appropriate dosage and usage. Therefore, 
more research is needed to better comprehend the long-term implications of 
irradiation on meat and address consumer concerns.

Burrata is a fresh pasta filata cheese manufactured in Italy. Its demand on the 
worldwide market is constantly growing, and prolonging its shelf-life is an 
important challenge for the Italian dairy industry. In the present study, 
combining a commercial bio-protective starter and modified atmosphere packaging 
(MAP) was evaluated as a strategy to delay the spoilage of product quality. 
Three experimental samples of burrata were produced by experimental trials at 
the industrial level and stored for 28 days under refrigerated conditions. Two 
samples contained the protective starter but were packaged differently (under 
MAP and immersed in water), and one did not contain the starter and was packaged 
under MAP. A sample of burrata without a starter and immersed in water was also 
prepared and used as a control. The combination of MAP and bio-protective 
starter delayed the degradation of lactose and citric acid, used as indices of 
microbial activity. In fact, lower counts of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas 
were observed in this sample. In contrast, control burrata had the highest level 
of total Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) at the end of the storage period, 
because of higher microbial activity. Even though all samples were judged to be 
unacceptable after 28 days from the sensory point of view, the sample with 
bio-protective starter under MAP had the best score after 21 days, obtaining a 
shelf-life extension of about 7 days with respect to control. In conclusion, the 
combination of MAP and protective starter culture could be an easy way to extend 
the shelf-life of burrata stored under correct refrigerated conditions.

The literature has identified poor nutrition as the leading factor in the 
manifestation of many behavioural issues in animals, including aggression, 
hyperalertness, and stereotypies. Literature focused on all species of interest 
consistently reported that although there were no significant differences in the 
richness of specific bacterial taxa in the microbiota of individual subjects 
with abnormal behaviour (termed alpha diversity), there was variability in 
species diversity between these subjects compared to controls (termed beta 
diversity). As seen in humans with mental disorders, animals exhibiting abnormal 
behaviour often have an enrichment of pro-inflammatory and lactic acid-producing 
bacteria and a reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria. It is evident from the 
literature that an association exists between gut microbiota diversity (and by 
extension, the concurrent production of microbial metabolites) and abnormal 
behavioural phenotypes across various species, including pigs, dogs, and horses. 
Similar microbiota population changes are also evident in human mental health 
patients. However, there are insufficient data to identify this association as a 
cause or effect. This review provides testable hypotheses for future research to 
establish causal relationships between gut microbiota and behavioural issues in 
animals, offering promising potential for the development of novel therapeutic 
and/or preventative interventions aimed at restoring a healthy gut-brain-immune 
axis to mitigate behavioural issues and, in turn, improve health, performance, 
and production in animals.

Cancer is a dangerous and sometimes life-threatening disease that can have 
several negative consequences for the body, is a leading cause of mortality, and 
is becoming increasingly difficult to detect. Each form of cancer has its own 
set of traits, symptoms, and therapies, and early identification and management 
are important for a positive prognosis. Doctors utilize a variety of approaches 
to detect cancer, depending on the kind and location of the tumor. Imaging tests 
such as X-rays, Computed Tomography scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans, and 
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans, which may provide precise pictures of 
the body's interior structures to spot any abnormalities, are some of the tools 
that doctors use to diagnose cancer. This article evaluates 
computational-intelligence approaches and provides a means to impact future work 
by focusing on the relevance of machine learning and deep learning models such 
as K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, 
Decision Tree, Deep Neural Network, Deep Boltzmann machine, and so on. It 
evaluates information from 114 studies using Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). 
This article explores the advantages and disadvantages of each model and 
provides an outline of how they are used in cancer diagnosis. In conclusion, 
artificial intelligence shows significant potential to enhance cancer imaging 
and diagnosis, despite the fact that there are a number of clinical issues that 
need to be addressed.

The purpose of this study is to identify and quantify preclinical changes with 
the help of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) within the retinal 
microcirculation of young type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients without clinical signs 
of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and to compare these results with those obtained 
from healthy age-matched subjects. OCTA is currently used for monitoring 
diabetic retinopathy; however, there is no current consensus on which OCTA 
parameter alterations predict the first clinical signs of diabetic retinopathy. 
The main challenge that young patients with T1D face during the course of the 
disease is that they can rapidly progress to the development of DR, especially 
during adolescence. Moreover, they also present an increased risk of rapid 
progression toward advanced stages of DR and vision loss compared to type 2 
diabetes patients, indicating the importance of early diagnosis and 
intervention. The limitations of the currently used screening procedures that 
led to the conceptualization of our study are the difficulties in performing 
fluorescein angiography tests for diagnosing the clinical signs of DR on young 
patients, namely the invasive procedure of dye injection, the risk of allergic 
reactions and the long duration of the examination. Moreover, given the long 
life expectancy of young T1D patients, it is essential to identify the 
preclinical changes in retinal microvasculature before reaching the first 
clinical signs quantifiable by FFA. The clinical study enrolled 119 subjects 
aged between 4 and 30 years old with a mean age of 13 years old, comprising 61 
T1D patients with a mean duration of the disease of 4 years and 8 months and 58 
healthy age-matched subjects for the control group. OCTA scans were performed 
using the RevoNX 130 OCTA device (Optopol) to evaluate the following retinal 
parameters: foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, perimeter and circularity, overall 
foveal thickness, and superficial and deep vessel densities. Statistically 
significant differences between the two groups were identified for the following 
parameters: the FAZ area in the T1D group (0.42 ± 0.17) was larger than the 
control group (0.26 ± 0.080), the FAZ circularity (0.41 ± 0.11) was decreased 
compared to the control group (0.61 ± 0.08) and the FAZ perimeter was larger 
(3.63 ± 0.97) compared to the control group (2.30 ± 0.50). The overall foveal 
thickness was decreased in the T1D group (222.98 ± 17.33) compared to the 
control group (230.64 ± 20.82). The total vessel density of the superficial 
capillary plexus (SCP) on an investigated area of 6 X 6 mm centered around the 
fovea was decreased in the T1D group (37.4164 ± 2.14) compared to the control 
group (38.0241 ± 2.44). Our data suggest that specific imaging biomarkers such 
as FAZ perimeter, area and circularity, decreased overall foveal thickness and 
decreased vessel density in the SCP precede the clinical diagnosis of DR in 
young T1D patients and represent useful parameters in quantifying capillary 
nonperfusion in T1D patients without clinical signs of DR.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the top drug targets 
for promoting health and lifespan extension. Besides rapamycin, only a few other 
mTOR inhibitors have been developed and shown to be capable of slowing aging. We 
used machine learning to predict novel small molecules targeting mTOR. We 
selected one small molecule, TKA001, based on in silico predictions of a high 
on-target probability, low toxicity, favorable physicochemical properties, and 
preferable ADMET profile. We modeled TKA001 binding in silico by molecular 
docking and molecular dynamics. TKA001 potently inhibits both TOR complex 1 and 
2 signaling in vitro. Furthermore, TKA001 inhibits human cancer cell 
proliferation in vitro and extends the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans, 
suggesting that TKA001 is able to slow aging in vivo.

Dementia is a progressive and debilitating neurological disease that affects 
millions of people worldwide. Identifying the minimally invasive biomarkers 
associated with dementia that could provide insights into the disease 
pathogenesis, improve early diagnosis, and facilitate the development of 
effective treatments is pressing. Proteomic studies have emerged as a promising 
approach for identifying the protein biomarkers associated with dementia. This 
pilot study aimed to investigate the plasma proteome profile and identify a 
panel of various protein biomarkers for dementia. We used a high-throughput 
proximity extension immunoassay to quantify 1090 proteins in 122 participants 
(22 with dementia, 64 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 36 controls with 
normal cognitive function). Limma-based differential expression analysis 
reported the dysregulation of 61 proteins in the plasma of those with dementia 
compared with controls, and machine learning algorithms identified 17 stable 
diagnostic biomarkers that differentiated individuals with AUC = 0.98 ± 0.02. 
There was also the dysregulation of 153 plasma proteins in individuals with 
dementia compared with those with MCI, and machine learning algorithms 
identified 8 biomarkers that classified dementia from MCI with an AUC of 0.87 ± 
0.07. Moreover, multiple proteins selected in both diagnostic panels such as 
NEFL, IL17D, WNT9A, and PGF were negatively correlated with cognitive 
performance, with a correlation coefficient (r2) ≤ -0.47. Gene Ontology (GO) and 
pathway analysis of dementia-associated proteins implicated immune response, 
vascular injury, and extracellular matrix organization pathways in dementia 
pathogenesis. In conclusion, the combination of high-throughput proteomics and 
machine learning enabled us to identify a blood-based protein signature capable 
of potentially differentiating dementia from MCI and cognitively normal 
controls. Further research is required to validate these biomarkers and 
investigate the potential underlying mechanisms for the development of dementia.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer, 
with high morbidity and mortality, which seriously threatens the health and life 
expectancy of patients. The traditional methods of treatment by surgical 
ablation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and more recently immunotherapy have not 
given the expected results in HCC. New integrative combined therapies, such as 
photothermal, photodynamic, photoimmune therapy (PTT, PDT, PIT), and smart 
multifunctional platforms loaded with nanodrugs were studied in this review as 
viable solutions in the synergistic nanomedicine of the future. The main aim was 
to reveal the latest findings and open additional avenues for accelerating the 
adoption of innovative approaches for the multi-target management of HCC. 
High-tech experimental medical applications in the molecular and cellular 
research of photosensitizers, novel light and laser energy delivery systems and 
the features of photomedicine integration via PDT, PTT and PIT in 
immuno-oncology, from bench to bedside, were introspected. Near-infrared PIT as 
a treatment of HCC has been developed over the past decade based on novel 
targeted molecules to selectively suppress cancer cells, overcome immune 
blocking barriers, initiate a cascade of helpful immune responses, and generate 
distant autoimmune responses that inhibit metastasis and recurrences, through 
high-tech and intelligent real-time monitoring. The process of putting into 
effect new targeted molecules and the intelligent, multifunctional solutions for 
therapy will bring patients new hope for a longer life or even a cure, and the 
fulfillment of the myth of Prometheus.

Jujube, commonly known as the Chinese date, is a nutritious fruit with medicinal 
importance. Fresh jujube fruits have a shelf life of about ten days in ambient 
conditions that can be extended by drying. However, nutrition preservation 
varies with the drying method and parameters selected. We studied total phenolic 
content (TPC), proanthocyanidins (PA), vitamin C, cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
(cAMP), and antioxidant activities in jujube fruits dried with freeze-drying 
(FD), convective oven drying (OD) at 50 °C, 60 °C, and 75 °C, and sun drying 
(SD) with FD as a control. The cultivars used for this study were 'Capri' and 
'Xiang' from Las Cruces in 2019, and 'Sugarcane', 'Lang', and 'Sherwood' from 
Las Cruces and Los Lunas, New Mexico, in 2020. Freeze-drying had the highest of 
all nutrient components tested, the best estimates of mature jujube fruits' 
nutrient contents. Compared with FD, the majority of PA (96-99%) and vitamin C 
(90-93%) was lost during SD or OD processes. The retention rates of antioxidant 
activities: DPPH and FRAP were higher in OD at 50/60 °C than SD. SD retained a 
higher cAMP level than OD at 50/60 °C in both years. The increase in oven drying 
temperature from 60 °C to 75 °C significantly decreased TPC, PA, antioxidant 
activities, and cAMP.

The main objective of the study was to evaluate and select the superior barley 
genotypes based on grain yield and some pheno-morphological traits using a new 
proposed selection index (SIIG). For this purpose, one-hundred-eight pure and 
four local cultivars (Norouz, Auxin, Nobahar, and WB-97-11) were evaluated as 
reference genotypes in four warm regions of Iran, including Ahvaz, Darab, Zabol, 
and Gonbad, during the 2020-2021 cropping seasons. The results of REML analysis 
showed that the heritability of all traits (except plant height) was higher in 
Gonbad than in other environments, while the lowest values were estimated in 
Ahvaz and Zabol environments. In addition, among the measured traits, the 
thousand kernel weight and grain filling period showed the highest and lowest 
values of heritability (0.83 and 0.01, respectively). The results showed that 
the seed yield of genotypes 1, 108, 3, 86, 5, 87, 19, 16, 15, 56, and 18 was 
higher than the four reference genotypes, and, on the other hand, the SIIG index 
of these genotypes was greater than or equal to 0.60. Based on the SIIG 
discriminator index, 4, 8, 31, and 28 genotypes with values greater than or 
equal to 0.60 were identified as superior for Darab, Ahvaz, Zabol, and Gonbad 
environments, respectively. As a conclusion, our results revealed that the SIIG 
index has ideal potential to identify genotypes with high yield and desirable 
traits. Therefore, the use of this index can be beneficial in screening better 
genotypes in the early stages of any breeding program for any crop.

Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2, LCO) has been widely used in electronic markets 
due to its high energy density and wide voltage range applications. Recently, 
high-voltage (HV, >4.5 V) operation has been required to obey the requirements 
of high energy density and cycle life in several applications such as electric 
vehicles and energy storage. However, the HV operation causes structure 
instability due to the over de-lithiation of LCO, as well as decomposing common 
carbonate solvents, thereby incurring the decay of battery performance. 
Moreover, a distortion of the CoO6 octahedra of LCO during de-lithiation induces 
a rehybridization of the Co 3d and O 2p orbitals. According to above reasons, 
decreasing the Co-O covalent bond promptly triggers high risks that 
significantly limit further use of LCO. In this research, an organic surface 
reinforcement by using bismaleimide-uracil (BU) that electrochemically forms a 
cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on LCO was explored. The results of 
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and battery performance, such as the 
c-rate and cyclability tests, demonstrated that the modified CEI formed from BU 
significantly prevents the distortion of CoO6 octahedra. X-ray photoelectronic 
spectroscopy and in situ XAS indicated less LiF formation and higher bond energy 
of Co-O improved. Finally, the differential scanning calorimetry showed the 
onset temperature of decomposition of LCO was extended from 245 to 270 °C at 
100% state of charge, which is about a 25 °C extension. The exothermic heat of 
LCO decreased by approximately 30% for high-safety use. This research confirms 
that the BU is eligible for high voltage (>4.5 V) LCO and presents outstanding 
electrochemical properties and safety performances.
