panuveitis are a heterogeneous group of inflammatory eye disorders. Management 
includes local and systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and biological 
drugs.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
subcutaneous adalimumab (Humira®; AbbVie Ltd, Maidenhead, UK) and a 
dexamethasone intravitreal implant (Ozurdex®; Allergan Ltd, Marlow, UK) in 
adults with non-infectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis or 
panuveitis.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases and clinical trials registries including 
MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts 
of Reviews of Effects and the World Health Organization's International Clinical 
Trials Registry Platform were searched to June 2016, with an update search 
carried out in October 2016.
REVIEW METHODS: Review methods followed published guidelines. A Markov model was 
developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of dexamethasone and adalimumab, each 
compared with current practice, from a NHS and Personal Social Services (PSS) 
perspective over a lifetime horizon, parameterised with published evidence. 
Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%. Substantial sensitivity analyses 
were undertaken.
RESULTS: Of the 134 full-text articles screened, three studies (four articles) 
were included in the clinical effectiveness review. Two randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs) [VISUAL I (active uveitis) and VISUAL II (inactive uveitis)] 
compared adalimumab with placebo, with limited standard care also provided in 
both arms. Time to treatment failure (reduced visual acuity, intraocular 
inflammation, new vascular lesions) was longer in the adalimumab group than in 
the placebo group, with a hazard ratio of 0.50 [95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.36 to 0.70; p < 0.001] in the VISUAL I trial and 0.57 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.84; 
p = 0.004) in the VISUAL II trial. The adalimumab group showed a significantly 
greater improvement than the placebo group in the 25-item Visual Function 
Questionnaire (VFQ-25) composite score in the VISUAL I trial (mean difference 
4.20; p = 0.010) but not the VISUAL II trial (mean difference 2.12; p = 0.16). 
Some systemic adverse effects occurred more frequently with adalimumab than with 
placebo. One RCT [HURON (active uveitis)] compared a single 0.7-mg dexamethasone 
implant against a sham procedure, with limited standard care also provided in 
both arms. Dexamethasone provided significant benefits over the sham procedure 
at 8 and 26 weeks in the percentage of patients with a vitreous haze score of 
zero (p < 0.014), the mean best corrected visual acuity improvement (p ≤ 0.002) 
and the percentage of patients with a ≥ 5-point improvement in VFQ-25 score 
(p < 0.05). Raised intraocular pressure and cataracts occurred more frequently 
with dexamethasone than with the sham procedure. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for one dexamethasone implant in one eye for a 
combination of patients with unilateral and bilateral uveitis compared with 
limited current practice, as per the HURON trial, was estimated to be £19,509 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The ICER of adalimumab for 
patients with mainly bilateral uveitis compared with limited current practice, 
as per the VISUAL trials, was estimated to be £94,523 and £317,547 per QALY 
gained in active and inactive uveitis respectively. Sensitivity analyses 
suggested that the rate of blindness has the biggest impact on the model 
results. The interventions may be more cost-effective in populations in which 
there is a greater risk of blindness.
LIMITATIONS: The clinical trials did not fully reflect clinical practice. 
Thirteen additional studies of clinically relevant comparator treatments were 
identified; however, network meta-analysis was not feasible. The model results 
are highly uncertain because of the limited evidence base.
CONCLUSIONS: Two RCTs of systemic adalimumab and one RCT of a unilateral, single 
dexamethasone implant showed significant benefits over placebo or a sham 
procedure. The ICERs for adalimumab were estimated to be above generally 
accepted thresholds for cost-effectiveness. The cost-effectiveness of 
dexamethasone was estimated to fall below standard thresholds. However, there is 
substantial uncertainty around the model assumptions. In future work, primary 
research should compare dexamethasone and adalimumab with current treatments 
over the long term and in important subgroups and consider how short-term 
improvements relate to long-term effects on vision.

Objective To compare the efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness of direct 
acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for patients with atrial 
fibrillation.Design Systematic review, network meta-analysis, and cost 
effectiveness analysis. Data sources Medline, PreMedline, Embase, and The 
Cochrane Library.Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Published randomised 
trials evaluating the use of a DOAC, vitamin K antagonist, or antiplatelet drug 
for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.Results 23 
randomised trials involving 94 656 patients were analysed: 13 compared a DOAC 
with warfarin dosed to achieve a target INR of 2.0-3.0. Apixaban 5 mg twice 
daily (odds ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.94), dabigatran 150 mg 
twice daily (0.65, 0.52 to 0.81), edoxaban 60 mg once daily (0.86, 0.74 to 
1.01), and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (0.88, 0.74 to 1.03) reduced the risk of 
stroke or systemic embolism compared with warfarin. The risk of stroke or 
systemic embolism was higher with edoxaban 60 mg once daily (1.33, 1.02 to 1.75) 
and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (1.35, 1.03 to 1.78) than with dabigatran 150 
mg twice daily. The risk of all-cause mortality was lower with all DOACs than 
with warfarin. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily (0.71, 0.61 to 0.81), dabigatran 110 mg 
twice daily (0.80, 0.69 to 0.93), edoxaban 30 mg once daily (0.46, 0.40 to 
0.54), and edoxaban 60 mg once daily (0.78, 0.69 to 0.90) reduced the risk of 
major bleeding compared with warfarin. The risk of major bleeding was higher 
with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily than apixaban 5 mg twice daily (1.33, 1.09 to 
1.62), rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily than apixaban 5 mg twice daily (1.45, 1.19 
to 1.78), and rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily than edoxaban 60 mg once daily 
(1.31, 1.07 to 1.59). The risk of intracranial bleeding was substantially lower 
for most DOACs compared with warfarin, whereas the risk of gastrointestinal 
bleeding was higher with some DOACs than warfarin. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily was 
ranked the highest for most outcomes, and was cost effective compared with 
warfarin.Conclusions The network meta-analysis informs the choice of DOACs for 
prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Several DOACs are of 
net benefit compared with warfarin. A trial directly comparing DOACs would 
overcome the need for indirect comparisons to be made through network 
meta-analysis.Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD 42013005324.

INTRODUCTION: Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP) is a congenital 
malformation that causes significant morbidity in low and middle income 
countries. Amref Health Africa has partnered with Smile Train to provide CLP 
surgeries since 2006.
METHODS: We analyzed anonymized data of 37,274 CLP patients from the Smile Train 
database operated on in eastern and central Africa between 2006 and 2014. Cases 
were analyzed by age, gender, country and surgery type. The impact of cleft 
surgery was determined by measuring averted Disability-Adjusted Life Years 
(DALYs) and delayed averted DALYs. We used mean Smile Train costs to calculate 
cost-effectiveness. We calculated economic benefit using the human capital 
approach and Value of Statistical Life (VSL) methods.
RESULTS: The median age at time of primary surgery was 5.4 years. A total of 
207,879 DALYs were averted at a total estimated cost of US$13 million. Mean 
averted DALYs per patient were 5.6, and mean cost per averted DALY was $62.8. 
Total delayed burden of disease from late age at surgery was 36,352 DALYs. 
Surgical correction resulted in $292 million in economic gain using the human 
capital approach and $2.4 billion using VSL methods.
CONCLUSION: Cleft surgery is a cost-effective intervention to reduce disability 
and increase economic productivity in eastern and central Africa. Dedicated 
programs that provide essential CLP surgery can produce substantial clinical and 
economic benefits.

Psychosocial impact of penile carcinoma.

Penile carcinoma is a rare malignancy with a potential for local invasion and 
regional/distant extension. Penile cancer can be cured in over 80% of cases if 
diagnosed early. However, local treatment, although potentially lifesaving, can 
be mutilating and devastating for the patient's psychological well-being. In 
patients with long-term survival after penile cancer, sexual dysfunction, 
voiding problems and cosmetic penile appearance may adversely affect the 
patient's quality of life. Although there is little data in the literature about 
psychosocial impact of penile carcinoma, organ-preserving treatment seems to 
allow for better quality of life and sexual function and should be offered to 
all patients whenever feasible.

Advancing research in medicine and technology has benefitted the mankind 
immensely with its contribution toward an improved life quality and increased 
life expectancy. The inability of a human body to autoregenerate has resulted in 
an increased demand for newer and healthier tissues and organs. Therefore, the 
restoration of naturally replicated tissue components has become a subject of 
interest for the scientific community lately. There was felt an intense quest 
for promoting strategies that could restore tissue regeneration and fuel the 
field of regenerative medicine. It was then the role of platelets was accounted 
for its wound healing and regenerative effects. Consequently, the use of 
platelet concentrates to improve wound healing, and bone formation was explored, 
which was considered to be possible because platelets contain high quantities of 
growth factors which would be able to stimulate cell proliferation, matrix 
remodeling, and angiogenesis, thereby establishing a new era of research with 
the successful application of innovative medical therapies focused on healing 
damaged tissues or regenerate the affected organs.

PURPOSE: Due to limitations in the ability to identify non-progressive disease, 
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is usually managed similarly to localized 
invasive breast cancer. We used simulation modeling to evaluate the potential 
impact of a hypothetical test that identifies non-progressive DCIS.
METHODS: A discrete-event model simulated a cohort of U.S. women undergoing 
digital screening mammography. All women diagnosed with DCIS underwent the 
hypothetical DCIS prognostic test. Women with test results indicating 
progressive DCIS received standard breast cancer treatment and a decrement to 
quality of life corresponding to the treatment. If the DCIS test indicated 
non-progressive DCIS, no treatment was received and women continued routine 
annual surveillance mammography. A range of test performance characteristics and 
prevalence of non-progressive disease were simulated. Analysis compared 
discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs for test scenarios to 
base-case scenarios without the test.
RESULTS: Compared to the base case, a perfect prognostic test resulted in a 40% 
decrease in treatment costs, from $13,321 to $8005 USD per DCIS case. A perfect 
test produced 0.04 additional QALYs (16 days) for women diagnosed with DCIS, 
added to the base case of 5.88 QALYs per DCIS case. The results were sensitive 
to the performance characteristics of the prognostic test, the proportion of 
DCIS cases that were non-progressive in the model, and the frequency of 
mammography screening in the population.
CONCLUSION: A prognostic test that identifies non-progressive DCIS would 
substantially reduce treatment costs but result in only modest improvements in 
quality of life when averaged over all DCIS cases.

The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of resistance 
training in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The study is a randomized 
controlled trial with 41 patients aged between 18 and 65 years with diagnosis of 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The patients were randomized into the following: 
intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). The IG underwent resistance 
exercise twice a week, for 12 weeks. The CG remained with the conventional drug 
therapy. The outcome measurements were the following: BASFI and HAQ-S for 
functional capacity, one maximum repetition test (1RM) for muscle strength, 
SF-36 questionnaire for general quality of life, and BASDAI and DAS-28 for 
disease activity. The evaluations were done by a blinded evaluator at baseline 
(T0) after 6 (T6) and 12 weeks (T12). At baseline, the groups were homogeneous 
regarding clinical and demographic characteristics. The IG significantly 
improved functional capacity measured by HAQ-S and disease activity measured by 
BASDAI, compared to CG, at week 12. Regarding quality of life, the IG improved 
the domains "pain" and "general health status" compared to CG (p < 0.05). There 
was improvement in muscular strength in almost all exercises in IG, except in 
the exercise for biceps. However, there were statistical differences between 
groups only on exercise "leg extension" in IG compared to CG. Resistance 
training is effective in improving functional capacity, disease activity, and 
quality of life of patients with psoriatic arthritis. The clinical improvements 
were not coupled to significant changes in muscular strength.

Cistanche deserticola has been found to exert protection against aging and 
age-related diseases, but mechanisms underlying its longevity effects remain 
largely unclear. Here, the multicellular model organism Caenorhabditis elegans 
was employed to identify lifespan extending and protective effects against 
β-amyloid (Aβ) induced toxicity by echinacoside (ECH), a phenylethanoid 
glycoside isolated from C. deserticola. Our results showed that ECH extends the 
mean lifespan of worms and increases their survival under oxidative stress. 
Levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and fat accumulation were also 
significantly suppressed by ECH. Moreover, ECH-mediated lifespan extension was 
found to be dependent on mev-1, eat-2, daf-2, and daf-16, but not sir-2.1 or 
hsf-1 genes. Furthermore, ECH triggered DAF-16 nuclear localization and 
upregulated two of its downstream targets, sod-3 and hsp-16.2. In addition, ECH 
significantly improved the survival of CL4176 worms in response to proteotoxic 
stress induced by Aβ protein aggregation. Collectively, these findings suggested 
that reactive oxygen species scavenging, dietary restriction, and 
insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathways could be partly involved 
in ECH-mediated lifespan extension. Thus, ECH may target multiple longevity 
mechanisms to extend lifespan and have a potency to prevent Alzheimer's disease 
progression.

Scientific advances and innovative targeted drugs, especially biologics, have 
revolutionised the treatment of many diseases. In oncology in particular, 
previously acute or lethal conditions have come to be considered chronic as new 
treatments have led to longer life expectancies and a lower rate of years lived 
with disability. These advances, however, come with rising costs in a 
resource-constrained environment. To achieve cost containment, reimbursement for 
in-vitro diagnostics (IVDs) is increasingly coming under pressure because they 
are perceived as a cost factor rather than as a tool to reduce expenditure in 
the long term. In this conceptual paper, we propose four possible interventions 
from an industry perspective that may contribute to increase effectiveness of 
IVD use to counteract increasing healthcare expenditures. These are: (1) 
fostering prevention, screening, early diagnosis and therapy; promoting (2) 
comprehensive and (3) stratified disease management; and (4) using targeted 
treatment alongside companion diagnostics. We conclude that the implementation 
of policies that promote a fee-for-outcome model rather than fee-for-service 
reimbursement can support sustainable healthcare.

AIMS: We aimed to assess the cost effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan compared 
to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) for the treatment of 
individuals with chronic heart failure and reduced-ejection fraction (HFrEF) 
from the perspective of the Swiss health care system.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was implemented as a lifelong 
regression-based cohort model. We compared sacubitril/valsartan with enalapril 
in chronic heart failure patients with HFrEF and New York-Heart Association 
Functional Classification II-IV symptoms. Regression models based on the 
randomised clinical phase III PARADIGM-HF trials were used to predict events 
(all-cause mortality, hospitalisations, adverse events and quality of life) for 
each treatment strategy modelled over the lifetime horizon, with adjustments for 
patient characteristics. Unit costs were obtained from Swiss public sources for 
the year 2014, and costs and effects were discounted by 3%. The main outcome of 
interest was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost 
per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Deterministic sensitivity 
analysis (DSA) and scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were 
performed.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the sacubitril/valsartan strategy showed a 
decrease in the number of hospitalisations (6.0% per year absolute reduction) 
and lifetime hospital costs by 8.0% (discounted) when compared with enalapril. 
Sacubitril/valsartan was predicted to improve overall and quality-adjusted 
survival by 0.50 years and 0.42 QALYs, respectively. Additional net-total costs 
were CHF 10 926. This led to an ICER of CHF 25 684. In PSA, the probability of 
sacubitril/valsartan being cost-effective at thresholds of CHF 50 000 was 99.0%.
CONCLUSION: The treatment of HFrEF patients with sacubitril/valsartan versus 
enalapril is cost effective, if a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF 50 000 per 
QALY gained ratio is assumed.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is an established risk factor for falls and balance 
impairment. This study investigated the incidence of falls, balance-related 
outcomes and risk factors for falls before and after primary total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA). Three hundred seventy-six OA patients scheduled to undergo 
TKA were included. Falls data within the preoperative, first postoperative and 
second postoperative years were collected, balance-related functions were 
assessed using the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL), WOMAC, Falls Efficacy 
Scale International (FES-I), Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC), knee 
extension strength, Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) before 
surgery and 1 and 2 years after surgery. Compared with preoperative values, the 
incidence of falls significantly decreased (14.89%, 6.23% and 3.14% within the 
preoperative, first postoperative and second postoperative years, respectively) 
and the AQoL, WOMAC, FES-I, ABC, knee extension strength, BBS and TUG 
significantly improved after TKA. Logistic regression analysis revealed that 
Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≥ 3 of the contralateral knee was an independent risk 
factor for falls before and after TKA. Conclusively, primary TKA is associated 
with a reduced incidence of falls and improved balance-related functions, and 
the contralateral knee should be considered in the design of fall-prevention 
strategies in patients with OA.

Progress in aging research is constrained by the time requirement of measuring 
lifespans. Even the most rapid model for eukaryotic aging, the replicative 
lifespan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is technically limited to only several 
lifespan measurements each day. Here we report a 384-well plate-based technique 
to measure replicative lifespan, termed High-Life. Using the High-Life 
technique, a single researcher can compare lifespan for more than 1,000 
conditions per day. We validated the technique with long-lived mutant strains 
and the lifespan-extending compound ibuprofen. We also applied this technique to 
screen a small compound library for lifespan extension. Two hits, terreic acid 
and mycophenolic acid, were validated on our single-cell replicator device and 
found to extend mean replicative lifespan by 15% and 20%, respectively. 
Together, we report a technique for high-throughput lifespan measurement, and we 
identify two lifespan-extending compounds. Our technique could be used to 
efficiently drive early-stage discovery of pro-longevity therapeutics.

Over the last century life expectancy has increased dramatically nearly all over 
the world. This dramatic absolute and relative increase of the old aged people 
component of the population has influenced not only population structure but 
also has dramatic implications for the individuals and public health services. 
The aim of the present pilot study was to examine the impact of physical 
well-being assessed by hand grip strength and social factors estimated by social 
contact frequency on health-related quality of life among 22 men and 41 women 
ranging in age between 60 and 94 years. Physical well-being was estimated by 
hand grip strength, data concerning subjective wellbeing and health related 
quality of life were collected by personal interviews based on the WHOQOL-BREF 
questionnaires. Number of offspring and intergenerational contacts were not 
related significantly to health-related quality of life, while social contacts 
with non-relatives and hand grip strength in contrast had a significant positive 
impact on health related quality of life among old aged men and women. Physical 
well-being and in particular muscle strength-estimated by grip strength-may 
increase health-related quality of life and is therefore an important source for 
well-being during old age. Grip strength may be used as an indicator of 
health-related quality of life.

With 1.67 million new cases and 522,000 deaths in the year 2012, breast cancer 
is the most common type of diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of 
cancer death in women around the world. Despite the success of screening 
programs and the development of adjuvant therapies, a significant percentage of 
breast cancer patients will suffer a metastatic disease that, to this day, 
remains incurable and justifies the research of new therapies to improve their 
life expectancy. Among the new therapies that have been developed in recent 
years, the emergence of targeted therapies has been a milestone in the fight 
against cancer. Over the past decade, many studies have shown a causal role of 
protein kinase dysregulations or mutations in different human diseases, 
including cancer. Along these lines, cancer research has demonstrated a key role 
of many protein kinases during human tumorigenesis and cancer progression, 
turning these molecules into valid candidates for new targeted therapies. The 
subsequent discovery and introduction in 2001 of the kinase inhibitor imatinib, 
as a targeted treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia, revolutionized cancer 
genetic pathways research, and lead to the development of multiple 
small-molecule kinase inhibitors against various malignancies, including breast 
cancer. In this review, we analyze studies published to date about novel 
small-molecule kinase inhibitors and evaluate if they would be useful to develop 
new treatment strategies for breast cancer patients.

The elevated methionine (MET) use by cancer cells is termed MET dependence and 
may be the only known general metabolic defect in cancer. Targeting MET by 
recombinant methioninase (rMETase) can arrest the growth of cancer cells in 
vitro and in vivo. We previously reported that rMETase, administrated by 
intra-peritoneal injection (ip-rMETase), could inhibit tumor growth in a 
patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model of a BRAF-V600E mutant 
melanoma. In the present study, we compared ip-rMETase and oral rMETase 
(o-rMETase) for efficacy on the melanoma PDOX. Melanoma PDOX nude mice were 
randomized into four groups of 5 mice each: untreated control; ip-rMETase (100 
units, i.p., 14 consecutive days); o-rMETase (100 units, p.o., 14 consecutive 
days); o-rMETase+ip-rMETase (100 units, p.o.+100 units, i.p., 14 consecutive 
days). All treatments inhibited tumor growth on day 14 after treatment 
initiation, compared to untreated control (ip-rMETase, p<0.0001; o-rMETase, 
p<0.0001; o-rMETase+ip-rMETase, p<0.0001). o-rMETase was significantly more 
effective than ip-rMETase (p = 0.0086). o-rMETase+ip-rMETase was significantly 
more effective than either mono-therapy: ip-rMETase, p = 0.0005; or o-rMETase, p 
= 0.0367. The present study is the first demonstrating that o-rMETase is 
effective as an anticancer agent. The results of the present study indicate the 
potential of clinical development of o-rMETase as an agent for chronic cancer 
therapy and for cancer prevention and possibly for life extension since dietary 
MET reduction extends life span in many animal models.

In insects, lifespan and reproduction are strongly associated with nutrition. 
The ratio and amount of nutrients individuals consume affect their life 
expectancy and reproductive investment. The geometric framework (GF) enables us 
to explore how animals regulate their intake of multiple nutrients 
simultaneously and determine how these nutrients interact to affect life-history 
traits of interest. Studies using the GF on host-generalist tephritid flies have 
highlighted trade-offs between longevity and reproductive effort in females, 
mediated by the protein-to-carbohydrate (P:C) ratio that individuals consume. 
Here, we tested how P and C intake affect lifespan (LS) in both sexes, and 
female lifetime (LEP), and daily (DEP) egg production, in Ceratitis cosyra, a 
host-specialist tephritid fly. We then determined the P:C ratio that C. cosyra 
defends when offered a choice of foods. Female LS was optimized at a 0:1 P:C 
ratio, whereas to maximize their fecundity, females needed to consume a higher 
P:C ratio (LEP = 1:6 P:C; DEP = 1:2.5 P:C). In males, LS was also optimized at a 
low P:C ratio of 1:10. However, when given the opportunity to regulate their 
intake, both sexes actively defended a 1:3 P:C ratio, which is closer to the 
target for DEP than either LS or LEP. Our results show that female C. cosyra 
experienced a moderate trade-off between LS and fecundity. Moreover, the diets 
that maximized expression of LEP and DEP were of lower P:C ratio than those 
required for optimal expression of these traits in host-generalist tephritids or 
other generalist insects.

BACKGROUND: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery (BS) versus 
conservative management (CM) for treating morbid obesity in Spain.
METHODS: We developed a probabilistic Markov model to estimate health outcomes, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY), life years gained (LYG), and costs over 
lifetime and 10-year horizons. Combined common BS procedures were compared with 
CM. Clinical and utility inputs were obtained from the literature and resource 
use and costs from local sources (€2017).
RESULTS: Over the 10-year horizon, BS led to a cost increment of €9,386 and 1.6 
additional QALY (€5,966/QALY). Leading to 0.6 LYG and 4.4 QALY gains and 
€300/patient average cost savings over lifetime, BS could potentially 
significantly reduce diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk over the 
considered horizons. Despite short-term cost reductions, surgery delay may lead 
to significant clinical benefits loss.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to CM, BS is a more effective and less costly alternative 
for treating morbid obesity in Spain.

HIV infection and cancer.

Sutinen J, Leppä S, Tarkkanen M.

Cancers in HIV-infected patients are divided into the AIDS-defining and non-AIDS 
defining cancers. In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy there has been 
a significant decrease in the incidence of AIDS-defining cancers, whereas the 
number of non-AIDS defining cancers is on the rise. This is partly explained by 
the frequent occurrence of conventional risk factors for cancers, but also HIV 
infection itself seems to further increase the risk. If an HIV-infected person 
is diagnosed early enough, his/her life expectancy corresponds to that of the 
general population. Therefore the treatment goal of cancers in HIV-infected 
patients should be the same as for HIV negative subjects. Antiretroviral agents 
have significant drug-drug interactions with many other medicines. These must 
always be taken into account when planning the treatment of HIV-infected 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: Although impairments of long-term recall affect everyday life, they 
may be missed by standard delayed recall tests, which typically assess the 
ability to retain new information within a few minutes, without encompassing the 
consolidation process. We adapted a verbal memory test to evaluate long-term 
memory consolidation in healthy volunteers.
METHOD: A sample of 238 participants (M = 42.23 years old, SD = 16.45) was 
administered an adapted version of the French RL/RI-16 (Van der Linden & the 
members of GREMEM, 2004), the One-Week Free and Cued Selective Reminding 
Test-word version, in which special feature relies on a 30-min and a 
1-week-delayed recall after encoding. We proposed normative data on 4 
indicators, depending on participants' own performance during the test, to 
measure their encoding, storage and consolidation abilities, with a method using 
an ascendant step-by-step linear regression model and a percentile procedure.
RESULTS: Results showed a better performance in women than in men for encoding 
and cueing scores (p < .01 and p < .05, respectively). We also highlighted an 
increase of the forgetting score according to the recall delay after encoding 
(30 min vs. 7 days; Z = 12.49, p < .001), the forgetting percentage 7 days after 
encoding being largely influenced by participants' age and gender (F[2, 236] = 
248.1, p < .001; adjusted R2 = 67%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasized the role of demographic factors on long-term 
memory consolidation. The demographically adjusted normative data we provide for 
the One-Week Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test-word version make it a 
sensitive tool for long-term memory consolidation assessment in clinical and 
forensic practice. (PsycINFO Database Record

BACKGROUND: Aging is a natural part of human life. However, recent discoveries 
indicate that pharmacological approaches used for the improvement and possibly, 
for the delay of the aging process, might shed a new light on this topic. This 
might obviously contribute to the extension of the active life of older people 
and maintenance of their quality of life, which could consequently reduce both 
social and economic burden of each country, especially the developed ones.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to explore pharmacological discoveries 
which may help to the delay or improvement of the aging process. More 
specifically, the authors focus on three anti-aging drugs candidates: metformin, 
rapamycin and resveratrol and one anti-aging component NAD+ precursors whose 
randomized control trials on animals have appeared to provide some efficacy in 
this respect and they seem to be promising in the aging process of human beings.
METHODS: This was done by conducting a literature review of available sources 
describing the issue of aging process with special focus on those anti-aging 
drug candidates.
RESULTS: The results of this study indicate that promising anti-aging candidates 
seem to be metformin, especially as far as cardiovascular or cancer mortality is 
concerned, and NAD+ precursors since they appear to promote better organ 
function, increased physical resistance, disease resistance and prolonged life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSION: There is a call for more longitudinal clinical trials, which would 
prove the efficacy of the promising anti-aging drugs candidates in humans.

Author information:

Hernâni Monteiro 4200-319, Porto, Portugal.

BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), the life 
expectancy and health quality for patients infected with Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus (HIV) have significantly improved. Nevertheless, as a result of not only 
the deleterious effects of the virus itself and prolonged ART, but also the 
effects of aging, cardiovascular diseases have emerged as one of the most common 
causes of death among these patients.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to explore the new insights on the 
spectrum of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in HIV infection, with emphasis on the 
factors that contribute to the atherosclerotic process and its role in the 
development of acute coronary syndrome in the setting of infection.
METHODS: A literature search using PubMed, ScienceDirect and Web of Science was 
performed. Articles up to Mar, 2017, were selected for inclusion. The search was 
conducted using MeSH terms, with the following key terms: [human 
immunodeficiency virus AND (cardiovascular disease OR coronary heart disease) 
AND (antiretroviral therapy AND (cardiovascular disease OR coronary heart 
disease))].
RESULTS: Clinical cardiovascular disease tends to appear approximately 10 years 
before in infected individuals, when compared to the general population. The 
pathogenesis behind the cardiovascular, HIV-associated complications is complex 
and multifactorial, involving traditional CVD risk factors, as well as factors 
associated with the virus itself - immune activation and chronic inflammation - 
and the metabolic disorders related to ART regimens.
CONCLUSION: Determining the cardiovascular risk among HIV-infected patients, as 
well as targeting and treating conditions that predispose to CVD, are now 
emerging concerns among physicians.

BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is an 
interstitial lung disease, which progressively leads to severe disability and
