the other hamstring muscles (p≤0.002).
SUMMARY: We highlight the heterogeneity of hamstring activation patterns in 
different tasks. Hip-extension exercise selectively activates the long 
hamstrings, and the Nordic exercise preferentially recruits the semitendinosus. 
These findings have implications for strategies to prevent hamstring injury as 
well as potentially for clinicians targeting specific hamstring components for 
treatment (mechanotherapy).

Neurite outgrowth is crucial during neuronal development and regeneration, and 
strategies that aim at promoting neuritogenesis are beneficial for 
reconstructing synaptic connections after neuronal degeneration and injury. 
Using a bivalent analogue strategy as a successful approach, the current study 
identifies a series of novel dimeric securinine analogues as potent neurite 
outgrowth enhancers. Compounds 13, 14, 17-19, and 21-23, with different lengths 
of carbon chain of N,N-dialkyl substituting diacid amide linker between two 
securinine molecules at C-15 position, exhibited notable positive effects on 
both neuronal differentiation and neurite extension of neuronal cells. Compound 
14, one of the most active compounds, was used as a representative compound for 
mechanistic studies. Its action on neurite outgrowth was through 
phosphorylation/activation of multiple signaling molecules including 
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt. These findings collectively identify a 
new group of beneficial compounds for neuritogenesis, and may provide insights 
on drug discovery of neural repair and regeneration.

Netherlands: Health System Review.

This analysis of the Dutch health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, healthcare provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. Without doubt, two major reforms 
implemented since the mid-2000s are among the main issues today. The newly 
implemented long-term care reform will have to realize a transition from 
publicly provided care to more self-reliance on the part of the citizens and a 
larger role for municipalities in its organization. A particular point of 
attention is how the new governance arrangements and responsibilities in 
long-term care will work together. The 2006 reform replaced the division between 
public and private insurance by one universal social health insurance and 
introduced managed competition as a driving mechanism in the healthcare system. 
Although the reform was initiated almost a decade ago, its stepwise 
implementation continues to bring changes in the healthcare system in general 
and in the role of actors in particular. In terms of performance, essential 
healthcare services are within easy reach and waiting times have been 
decreasing. The basic health insurance package and compensations for lower 
incomes protect citizens against catastrophic spending. Out-of-pocket payments 
are low from an international perspective. Moreover, the Dutch rate the quality 
of the health system and their health as good. International comparisons show 
that the Netherlands has low antibiotic use, a low number of avoidable 
hospitalizations and a relatively low avoidable mortality. National studies show 
that healthcare has made major contributions to the health of the Dutch 
population as reflected in increasing life expectancy. Furthermore, some 
indicators such as the prescription of generics and length of stay reveal 
improvements in efficiency over the past years. Nevertheless, the Netherlands 
still has one of the highest per capita health expenditures in Europe, although 
growth has slowed considerably after reverting to more traditional sector 
agreements on spending.

This analysis of the Slovene health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. The health of the population has improved 
over the last few decades. While life expectancy for both men and women is 
similar to EU averages, morbidity and mortality data show persistent disparities 
between regions, and mortality from external causes is particularly high. 
Satisfaction with health care delivery is high, but recently waiting times for 
some outpatient specialist services have increased. Greater focus on preventive 
measures is also needed as well as better care coordination, particularly for 
those with chronic conditions. Despite having relatively high levels of 
co-payments for many services covered by the universal compulsory health 
insurance system, these expenses are counterbalanced by voluntary health 
insurance, which covers 95% of the population liable for co-payments. However, 
Slovenia is somewhat unique among social health insurance countries in that it 
relies almost exclusively on payroll contributions to fund its compulsory health 
insurance system. This makes health sector revenues very susceptible to economic 
and labour market fluctuations. A future challenge will be to diversify the 
resource base for health system funding and thus bolster sustainability in the 
longer term, while preserving service delivery and quality of care. Given 
changing demographics and morbidity patterns, further challenges include 
restructuring the funding and provision of long-term care and enhancing health 
system efficiency through reform of purchasing and provider-payment systems.

BACKGROUND: Stepped wedge design (SWD) is a cluster randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) design that sequentially rolls out intervention to all clusters at varying 
time points. Being a relatively new design method, reporting quality has yet to 
be explored, and this review will seek to fill this gap in knowledge.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review are: 1) to assess the quality of SWD 
trial reports based on the CONSORT guidelines or CONSORT extension to cluster 
RCTs; 2) to assess the completeness of reporting of SWD trial abstracts using 
the CONSORT extension for abstracts; 3) to assess the reporting of sample size 
details in SWD trial reports or protocols; 4) to assess the completeness of 
reporting of SWD trial protocols according to SPIRIT guidelines; 5) to assess 
the consistency between the trial registration information and final SWD trial 
reports; and 6) to assess the consistency of what is reported in the abstracts 
and main text of the SWD trial reports. We will also explore factors that are 
associated with the completeness of reporting.
METHODS: We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO 
for all randomized controlled trials utilizing SWD. Details from eligible papers 
will be extracted in duplicate. Demographic statistics obtained from the data 
extraction will be analyzed to answer the primary objectives pertaining to the 
reporting quality of several aspects of a published paper, as well as to explore 
possible temporal trends and consistency between abstracts, trial registration 
information, and final published articles.
DISCUSSION: Findings from this review will establish the reporting quality of 
SWD trials and inform academics and clinicians on their completeness and 
consistency. Results of this review will influence future trials and improve the 
overall quality and reporting of SWD trials.

Composite Tissue Transplant of Hand or Arm: A Health Technology Assessment.

Health Quality Ontario.

Collaborators: Lambrinos A, Xie X, Higgins C, Holubowich C.

BACKGROUND: Injuries to arms and legs following severe trauma can result in the 
loss of large regions of tissue, disrupting healing and function and sometimes 
leading to amputation of the damaged limb. People experiencing amputations of 
the hand or arm could potentially benefit from composite tissue transplant, 
which is being performed in some countries. Currently, there are no composite 
tissue transplant programs in Canada.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature, with no restriction 
on study design, examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hand and 
arm transplant. We assessed the overall quality of the clinical evidence with 
GRADE. We developed a Markov decision analytic model to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of transplant versus standard care for a healthy adult with a 
hand amputation. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated 
using a 30-year time horizon. We also estimated the impact on provincial health 
care costs if these transplants were publicly funded in Ontario.
RESULTS: Compared to pre-transplant function, patients' post-transplant function 
was significantly better. For various reasons, 17% of transplanted limbs were 
amputated, 6.4% of patients died within the first year after the transplant, and 
10.6% of patients experienced chronic rejections. GRADE quality of evidence for 
all outcomes was very low. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, single-hand 
transplant was dominated by standard care, with increased costs ($735,647 CAD 
vs. $61,429) and reduced quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (10.96 vs. 11.82). 
Double-hand transplant also had higher costs compared with standard care 
($633,780), but it had an increased effectiveness of 0.17 QALYs, translating to 
an ICER of $3.8 million per QALY gained. In most sensitivity analyses, ICERs for 
bilateral hand transplant were greater than $1 million per QALY gained. A hand 
transplant program would lead to an estimated annual budget impact of $0.9 
million to $1.2 million in the next 3 years, 2016 to 2018, to treat 3 adults per 
year.
CONCLUSIONS: Composite tissue transplant of the hand or arm may improve a 
patient's ability to function, but because the overall quality of evidence is of 
very low quality, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether benefits 
outweigh harms. Compared with standard care, both single- and double-hand 
transplants are not cost-effective.

Retinal Prosthesis System for Advanced Retinitis Pigmentosa: A Health Technology 
Assessment.

Health Quality Ontario.

Collaborators: Lee C, Tu HA, Weir M, Holubowich C.

BACKGROUND: Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of genetic disorders that involves 
the breakdown and loss of photoreceptors in the retina, resulting in progressive 
retinal degeneration and eventual blindness. The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis 
System is the only currently available surgical implantable device approved by 
Health Canada. It has been shown to improve visual function in patients with 
severe visual loss from advanced retinitis pigmentosa. The objective of this 
analysis was to examine the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, budget 
impact, and safety of the Argus II system in improving visual function, as well 
as exploring patient experiences with the system.
METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the literature for studies 
examining the effects of the Argus II retinal prosthesis system in patients with 
advanced retinitis pigmentosa, and appraised the evidence according to the 
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) 
Working Group criteria, focusing on visual function, functional outcomes, 
quality of life, and adverse events. We developed a Markov decision-analytic 
model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Argus II system compared with 
standard care over a 10-year time horizon. We also conducted a 5-year budget 
impact analysis. We used a qualitative design and an interview methodology to 
examine patients' lived experience, and we used a modified grounded theory 
methodology to analyze information from interviews. Transcripts were coded, and 
themes were compared against one another.
RESULTS: One multicentre international study and one single-centre study were 
included in the clinical review. In both studies, patients showed improved 
visual function with the Argus II system. However, the sight-threatening 
surgical complication rate was substantial. In the base-case analysis, the Argus 
II system was cost-effective compared with standard care only if 
willingness-to-pay was more than $207,616 per quality-adjusted life-year. The 
5-year budget impact of funding the Argus II system ranged from $800,404 to 
$837,596. Retinitis pigmentosa significantly affects people's ability to 
navigate physical and virtual environments. Argus II was described as enabling 
the fundamental elements of sight. As such, it had a positive impact on quality 
of life for people with retinitis pigmentosa.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on evidence of moderate quality, patients with advanced 
retinitis pigmentosa who were implanted with the Argus II retinal prosthesis 
system showed significant improvement in visual function, real-life functional 
outcomes, and quality of life, but there were complications associated with the 
surgery that could be managed through standard ophthalmologic treatments. The 
costs for the technology are high.

and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa.

INTRODUCTION: Due to a higher risk for implant loosening, particularly of the 
distal component, patients with physically demanding lifestyles are infrequently 
considered for total wrist arthroplasty (TWA). A distal radius hemiarthroplasty 
may obviate the need for the strict restrictions recommended for patients 
treated by TWA, thus providing another surgical option for active patients with 
severe wrist arthritis, especially those with articular degeneration of the 
lunate facet of the radius, capitate head, or combination of both, who are not 
typically candidates for traditional motion-preserving procedures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight fresh-frozen cadaver limbs (age range, 43-82 years) 
with no history of rheumatoid arthritis or upper extremity trauma were used. 
Radiodense markers were inserted in the radius and hand. Posteroanterior (PA) 
fluoroscopic images with the wrist in neutral, radial deviation, and ulnar 
deviation, and lateral images with the wrist in neutral, flexion, and extension 
were obtained for each specimen before implantation, after distal radius 
hemiarthroplasty, and after combined hemiarthroplasty and PRC.
RESULTS: On the PA images, the capitate remained within 1.42 and 2.21 mm of its 
native radial-ulnar position following hemiarthroplasty and hemiarthroplasty 
with PRC, respectively. Lateral images showed the capitate remained within 
1.06 mm of its native dorsal-volar position following hemiarthroplasty and 
within 4.69 mm following hemiarthroplasty with PRC. Following hemiarthroplasty, 
capitate alignment changed 2.33 and 2.59 mm compared with its native 
longitudinal alignment on PA and lateral films, respectively. These changes did 
not reach statistical significance. As expected, significant shortening in 
longitudinal alignment was seen on both PA and lateral films for 
hemiarthroplasty with PRC.
CONCLUSION: A distal radius implant hemiarthroplasty with or without a PRC 
provides good static alignment of the wrist in a cadaver model and thus supports 
the concept as potential treatment alternatives for advanced wrist arthritis; 
however, combined hemiarthroplasty with a PRC has more clinical relevance 
because it avoids the risk of proximal carpal row instability and eliminates the 
commonly arthritic radioscaphoid joint.

Understanding the challenges to improve transition to palliative care: An issue 
for the primary malignant brain tumour population.

Sabo B, Johnston G.

Reports highlight the growing unmet need for palliative care as it applies to 
all cancers, yet the system and health care professionals (HCP) appear slow to 
respond. The following discussion paper highlights the current state of 
palliative care within the context of the primary malignant brain tumour (PMBT) 
population and argues for a shift in the current health care system's approach, 
which continues to place greater emphasis on cure over care.
METHODS: An exploration of extant literature over the past 10 years.
RESULTS: The current literature demonstrates that timely referrals to palliative 
care consult teams and access to community-based resources have been associated 
with fewer hospitalizations and visits to emergency departments and a decrease 
in the initiation of invasive, aggressive treatment at end of life. Timely 
referral to palliative care has also been shown to reduce distress, enhance 
quality of life and, in some cases, increase life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Earlier referral to palliative care has yet to become a reality for 
many patients diagnosed with life-limiting illnesses and, in particular, those 
with a PMBT. More research is needed to uncover and challenge the barriers to 
early transition including communication issues among professionals, patients 
and families around palliative care.

BACKGROUND: A deep infection of the surgical site is reported in 0.7% of all 
cases of total hip arthroplasty (THA). This often leads to revision surgery that 
is invasive, painful and costly. A range of strategies is employed in NHS 
hospitals to reduce risk, yet no economic analysis has been undertaken to 
compare the value for money of competing prevention strategies.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the costs and health benefits of strategies that reduce 
the risk of deep infection following THA in NHS hospitals. To make 
recommendations to decision-makers about the cost-effectiveness of the 
alternatives.
DESIGN: The study comprised a systematic review and cost-effectiveness decision 
analysis.
SETTING: 77,321 patients who had a primary hip arthroplasty in NHS hospitals in 
2012.
INTERVENTIONS: Nine different treatment strategies including antibiotic 
prophylaxis, antibiotic-impregnated cement and ventilation systems used in the 
operating theatre.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in the number of deep infections, change in the 
total costs and change in the total health benefits in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs).
DATA SOURCES: Literature searches using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to 
Nursing and Allied Health Literature and the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials were undertaken to cover the period 1966-2012 to identify 
infection prevention strategies. Relevant journals, conference proceedings and 
bibliographies of retrieved papers were hand-searched. Orthopaedic surgeons and 
infection prevention experts were also consulted.
REVIEW METHODS: English-language papers only. The selection of evidence was by 
two independent reviewers. Studies were included if they were interventions that 
reported THA-related deep surgical site infection (SSI) as an outcome. 
Mixed-treatment comparisons were made to produce estimates of the relative 
effects of competing infection control strategies.
RESULTS: Twelve studies, six randomised controlled trials and six observational 
studies, involving 123,788 total hip replacements (THRs) and nine infection 
control strategies, were identified. The quality of the evidence was judged 
against four categories developed by the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence Methods for Development of NICE Public Health Guidance ( 
http://publications.nice.org.uk/methods-for-the-development-of-nice-public-health-guidance-third-edition-pmg4 
), accessed March 2012. All evidence was found to fit the two highest categories 
of 1 and 2. Nine competing infection control interventions [treatments (Ts) 1-9] 
were used in a cohort simulation model of 77,321 patients who had a primary THR 
in 2012. Predictions were made for cases of deep infection and total costs, and 
QALY outcomes. Compared with a baseline of T1 (no systemic antibiotics, plain 
cement and conventional ventilation) all other treatment strategies reduced 
risk. T6 was the most effective (systemic antibiotics, antibiotic-impregnated 
cement and conventional ventilation) and prevented a further 1481 cases of deep 
infection, and led to the largest annual cost savings and the greatest gains to 
QALYs. The additional uses of laminar airflow and body exhaust suits indicate 
higher costs and worse health outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: T6 is an optimal strategy for reducing the risk of SSI following 
THA. The other strategies that are commonly used among NHS hospitals lead to 
higher cost and worse QALY outcomes. Policy-makers, therefore, have an 
opportunity to save resources and improve health outcomes. The effects of 
laminar air flow and body exhaust suits might be further studied if 
policy-makers are to consider disinvesting in these technologies.
LIMITATIONS: A wide range of evidence sources was synthesised and there is large 
uncertainty in the conclusions.

Patients and non-patients tend to attach different utility values to the state 
of suffering from specific illnesses. This observation naturally leads to the 
question whose utility values should be used as the basis in cost-effectiveness 
analysis (CEA). Intuitively, one would presume that patients are better informed 
about the consequences of their illness, and public authorities should, 
therefore, use the patients' utility values in CEA. Contrary to this 
presumption, it has been argued that society at large should determine which 
values are to be used and not the patients because, in the end, it is societal 
resources that are to be allocated. Against this background, we use data from a 
discrete choice experiment (DCE) that was completed by patients of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and non-patients to explore the discrepancies between the two 
groups' utility estimates for typical consequences of RA. Our results indicate 
that both groups attach remarkably similar part-worth utilities to the symptoms 
pain, fatigue, and functional limitations. However, non-patients significantly 
undervalue the ability to work when compared to patients.

BACKGROUND: Atypical meningioma differs from Grade I meningioma in terms of high 
recurrence rate and short life expectancy. We evaluated the clinical course of 
atypical meningioma and investigated prognostic factors affecting its outcomes.
METHOD: We reviewed 45 patients with atypical meningioma who underwent surgical 
intervention between January 2000 and December 2013. The mean age of the 
patients and mean follow-up period was 58.7 years and 81.0 months, respectively. 
Analyses included factors such as patient age, gender, location and size of 
tumor, extent of surgical resection (Simpson Grading System), and MIB-1 labeling 
index (LI). Univariate analysis was used to detect prognostic factors associated 
with recurrence and survival.
RESULTS: The 5-year recurrence-free rate for all 45 patients was 58.4 %; 5- and 
10-year survival rates were 83.2 % and 79.9 %, respectively. In univariate 
analyses, age >60 years, and MIB-1 LI correlated with disease recurrence, 
whereas age >60 years, subtotal surgical resection, MIB-1 LI, and indication for 
radiotherapy correlated with death. MIB-1 LI levels higher than 12.8 % and 
19.7 % predicted recurrence and death, respectively. In our cohort, 26 patients 
received postoperative radiotherapy including conventional radiation (n = 21) or 
gamma knife radiosurgery (n = 5). Postoperative radiotherapy did not decrease 
recurrence rates in our cohort (p = 0.63). Six and two patients who died during 
the study period underwent conventional radiation and radiosurgery, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Age, male gender, extent of surgical resection, and higher MIB-1 LI 
influenced the outcome of atypical meningioma. In our cohort, postoperative 
radiotherapy failed to provide long-term tumor control. Following incomplete 
surgical resection of atypical meningioma in elderly patients, adjuvant 
postoperative radiotherapy may not be an ideal treatment option, particularly

BACKGROUND: The overall life expectancy of women with cystic fibrosis (CF) is 
shorter compared with men with CF without accounting for lung transplant 
recipients. However, it is unclear how donor and recipient gender impact 
long-term outcomes in patients with CF who undergo lung transplantation. The 
purpose of this study was to determine if the gender disadvantage seen in women 
with CF before transplant continues to exist after lung transplant and if this 
is impacted by donor gender.
METHODS: Patients with CF entered in the International Society for Heart and 
Lung Transplantation registry who were at least 18 years old and received a lung 
transplant between January 2000 and December 2012 were included and divided into 
groups based on donor-recipient gender combinations. Kaplan-Meier curves were 
used to determine post-transplant rates of overall survival and bronchiolitis 
obliterans syndrome (BOS)-free survival.
RESULTS: The analysis included 4,971 patients undergoing lung transplantation 
for CF. There was no significant difference in BOS-free survival or overall 
survival rates between genders or between gender-matched vs gender-mismatched 
recipients after lung transplantation. However, women with CF underwent 
transplantation at a younger age and died at an earlier overall age than men 
with CF.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival after lung transplantation and time to the development of 
BOS did not differ based on gender or donor-recipient gender combination. 
However, women with CF continue to demonstrate a poorer overall life expectancy, 
as their pre-transplant disadvantage could not be overcome after lung 
transplantation.

Despite improvement in median life expectancy and overall health, some children 
with cystic fibrosis (CF) progress to end-stage lung or liver disease and become 
candidates for transplant. Transplants for children with CF hold the promise to 
extend and improve the quality of life, but barriers to successful long-term 
outcomes include shortage of suitable donor organs; potential complications from 
the surgical procedure and immunosuppressants; risk of rejection and infection; 
and the need for lifelong, strict adherence to a complex medical regimen. This 
article reviews the indications and complications of lung and liver 
transplantation in children with CF.

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators are 
clinically available personalized medicines approved for some individuals with 
cystic fibrosis (CF) to target the underlying defect of disease. This review 
summarizes strategies used to develop CFTR modulators as therapies that improve 
function and availability of CFTR protein. Lessons learned from dissemination of 
ivacaftor across the CF population responsive to this therapy and future 
approaches to predict and monitor treatment response of CFTR modulators are 
discussed. The goal remains to expand patient-centered and personalized therapy 
to all patients with CF, ultimately improving life expectancy and quality of 
life for this disease.

Diapause (developmental arrest) is characterized by dramatic depression of 
metabolic activity and profoundly extends insect lifespan, similar to the 
Caenorhabditis elegans dauer stage and Drosophila longevity; however, the 
molecular mechanism of low metabolism in insect diapause is unclear. Here, we 
show that HIF-1α expression is significantly increased in diapause-destined 
pupal brains compared to nondiapause-destined pupal brains and that HIF-1α 
negatively regulates mitochondrial biogenesis. HIF-1α mediates this effect by 
inhibiting c-Myc activity via proteasome-dependent degradation of c-Myc. The 
mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which encodes a key factor involved 
in mitochondrial transcription and mitochondrial DNA replication, is activated 
by the binding of c-Myc to the TFAM promoter, thereby inducing transcription. 
Loss of TFAM expression is a major factor contributing to reducing the 
mitochondrial activity. Thus, the HIF-1α-c-Myc-TFAM signaling pathway 
participates in the regulation of mitochondrial activity for insect diapause or 
lifespan extension.

Pediatric organ transplant recipients (POTRs) are at risk of developing 
malignancies due to a combination of immunosuppression, impaired DNA damage 
repair, and infection with oncogenic viruses. The most commonly developed 
malignancies in this population are skin cancers, which include nonmelanoma skin 
cancer, melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and anogenital carcinoma. The literature 
shows that skin cancers account for 13% to 55% of all cancers that occur after 
transplantation. Given the increasing number and life expectancy of POTRs, 
prevention and management of skin cancer in these patients is essential, but 
there is a substantial knowledge gap in our understanding of the differences in 
skin cancer development, prevention, and management between POTRs and adult 
organ transplant recipients (AOTRs), for whom more data are available. 
Substantial differences have been observed in the patterns of malignancy 
development between POTRs and AOTRs, and data specific to pediatric populations 
are needed. The objective of this review is to provide updated information on 
posttransplantation skin cancer development in POTRs, including epidemiologic 
research on transplant patients and disease development, medication management, 
surveillance, and education efforts.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring after cryptogenic 
stroke improves detection of covert atrial fibrillation, but its long-term 
cost-effectiveness is uncertain.
METHODS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of noninvasive ECG monitoring in 
patients aged ≥55 years after a recent cryptogenic stroke and negative 24-hour 
ECG. A Markov model used observed rates of atrial fibrillation detection and 
anticoagulation from a randomized controlled trial (EMBRACE) and the published 
literature to predict lifetime costs and effectiveness (ischemic strokes, 
hemorrhages, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) for 30-day ECG 
(primary analysis) and 7-day or 14-day ECG (secondary analysis), when compared 
with a repeat 24-hour ECG.
RESULTS: Prolonged ECG monitoring (7, 14, or 30 days) was predicted to prevent 
more ischemic strokes, decrease mortality, and improve QALYs. If anticoagulation 
reduced stroke risk by 50%, 30-day ECG (at a cost of USD $447) would be highly 
cost-effective ($2000 per QALY gained) for patients with a 4.5% annual ischemic 
stroke recurrence risk. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to stroke recurrence 
risk and anticoagulant effectiveness, which remain uncertain, especially at 
higher costs of monitoring. Shorter duration (7 or 14 days) monitoring was cost 
saving and more effective than an additional 24-hour ECG; its cost-effectiveness 
was less sensitive to changes in ischemic stroke risk and treatment effect.
CONCLUSIONS: After a cryptogenic stroke, 30-day ECG monitoring is likely 
cost-effective for preventing recurrent strokes; 14-day monitoring is an 
attractive value alternative, especially for lower risk patients. These results 
strengthen emerging recommendations for prolonged ECG monitoring in secondary 
stroke prevention. Cost-effectiveness in practice will depend on careful patient 
selection.

Essentials Anticoagulation in the elderly is still a challenge and suspension of 
warfarin is common. This is an observational study reporting reasons and 
consequences of warfarin suspension. Vascular disease, age, time in therapeutic 
range, and bleedings are associated with suspension. After suspension for 
bleeding or frailty, patients remain at high-risk of death or complications.
SUMMARY: Background Anticoagulation in elderly patients with non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation (NVAF) is still a challenge, and discontinuation of warfarin is 
common. The aim of this study was to analyze the aspects related to warfarin 
discontinuation in a real-world population. Methods This was an observational 
cohort study on very elderly NVAF patients naive to warfarin therapy (VENPAF). 
The included subjects were aged at least 80 years, and started using warfarin 
after a diagnosis of NVAF. Warfarin discontinuation was assessed, and the reason 
reported for discontinuation, the person who decided to stop treatment, 
subsequent antithrombotic therapy and mortality, ischemic and bleeding events 
were collected. Results Over a period of 5 years, warfarin was discontinued in 
148 of 798 patients. Despite similar CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores, the frequencies of 
thromboembolic and major bleeding events were significantly higher (P = 0.01 and 
P = 0.001, respectively) and the time in therapeutic range (TTR) was 
significantly lower (P < 0.001) in patients who discontinued warfarin. 
Independent risk factors for warfarin discontinuation were vascular disease 
(hazard ratio [HR] 2.5, P < 0.001), age ≥ 85 years (HR 1.4, P = 0.04), TTR < 60% 
(HR 1.8, P = 0.001), and bleeding events (HR 2.3, P < 0.001). The main reasons 
for warfarin discontinuation were physician-perceived frailty or low 
life-expectancy (45.9%), bleeding complications (19.6%), and sinus rhythm 
restoration (16.9%). Event and death rates were very high, especially in frail 
patients and in those with bleeding complications. Conclusions Warfarin 
discontinuation is frequent in very elderly patients, and is associated with 
increased risks of death and adverse events. Identification of elderly patients 
who are at high risk of bleeding and the poor quality of anticoagulation during 
warfarin are still unsolved clinical problems.

Drosophila suzukii causes economic damage to berry and stone fruit worldwide. 
Laboratory-generated datasets were standardized and combined on the basis of 
degree days (DD), using Gompertz and Cauchy curves for survival and 
reproduction. Eggs transitioned to larvae at 20.3 DD; larvae to pupae at 
118.1 DD; and pupae to adults at 200 DD. All adults are expected to have died at 
610 DD. Oviposition initiates at 210 DD and gradually increases to a maximum of 
15 eggs per DD at 410 DD and subsequently decreases to zero at 610 DD. These 
data were used as the basis for a DD cohort-level population model. Laboratory 
survival under extreme temperatures when DD did not accumulate was described by 
a Gompertz curve based on calendar days. We determined that the initiation of 
the reproductive period of late dormant field-collected female D. suzukii ranged 
from 50 to 800 DD from January 1. This suggests that D. suzukii females can 
reproduce early in the season and are probably limited by availability of early 
host plants. Finally, we used the DD population model to examine hypothetical 
stage-specific mortality effects of IPM practices from insecticides and 
parasitoids at the field level. We found that adulticides applied during the 
early season will result in the largest comparative population decrease. It is 
clear from model outputs that parasitism levels comparable to those found in 
field studies may have a limited effect on population growth. Novel parasitoid 
guilds could therefore be improved and would be valuable for IPM of D. suzukii.

Biological age is not always concordant with chronological age and the 
departures are of interest for understanding how diseases and environmental 
insults affect tissue function, organismal health, and life expectancy. The 
best-known biological age biomarker is telomere length, but there are more 
accurate biomarkers as the recently developed based in epigenetic, 
transcriptomic, or biochemical changes. The most accurate are the epigenetic 
biomarkers based on specific changes in DNA methylation referred as DNA 
methylation age measures (DmAM). Here, we have developed and validated a new 
DmAM that addresses some limitations of the previously available. The new DmAM 
includes the study in whole blood (WB) of 8 CpG sites selected as the most 
informative on a training set of 390 healthy subjects. The 8 CpG DmAM showed 
better accuracy than other DmAM based in few CpG in an independent validation 
set of 335 subjects. Results were not significantly influenced by sex, smoking, 
or variation in blood cell subpopulations. In addition, the new 8 CpG DmAM was 
amenable to study in a single multiplex reaction done with methylation-sensitive 
single-nucleotide primer extension (MS-SNuPE), a methodology based on 
commercially available reagents and run in capillary electrophoresis sequencers. 
In this way, the high cost of DNA methylation microarrays or of a pyrosequencer, 
which are needed for alternative DmAM, was avoided. Performance of the DmAM with 
MS-SNuPE was assessed in a set of 557 donors, showing high call rate (>97%), low 
CV (<3.3%) and high accuracy (Mean Absolute Deviation = 6.07 years). Therefore, 
the 8 CpG DmAM is a feasible and accurate tool for assessing the epigenetic
