strategy of annual MMR is both more effective and less expensive than strategies 
using self-referral or symptom screening alone, and the addition of sputum PCR 
for rapid MDR-TB detection may be cost-saving over time.

OBJECTIVE: As interest in life quality and expectancy increases, cognitive 
dysfunction is becoming an important topic. Although there are many foreign 
articles on this topic, they require cultural interpretation to be applicable to 
Koreans. The purpose of this study was to assess cognitive function in Korean 
neurosurgical patients.
METHODS: We recruited 214 adult Korean patients with various cerebral 
pathologies and treatments from an outpatient clinic. The male-to-female ratio 
was 88:126, and their ages ranged from 28 to 81 years (mean: 57.9 years). The 
Korean version of the mini-mental status examination (K-MMSE) was adopted as an 
instrument for measuring cognitive function, and a score ≤23 was defined as 
cognitive dysfunction. K-MMSE scores were analyzed considering the patients' 
gender, age, time elapsed since treatments, pathology and treatment modality. A 
serial analysis was performed for 59 patients who completed the K-MMSE more than 
once.
RESULTS: The mean K-MMSE score of 214 patients was 22.3, and 133 patients 
(62.1%) had a score ≤23. Cognitive dysfunction was common regardless of age, 
gender, pathology or treatment modality. Serial analysis revealed K-MMSE score 
improvement in 45 of 59 patients (76.3%). The mean time interval between two 
tests was 11.9 months, and the mean K-MMSE score improvement was 2.7, which was 
statistically significant (P = 0.000). However, many still had cognitive 
impairment.
CONCLUSION: Most Korean neurosurgical patients showed cognitive dysfunction 
despite improvement after several months. Patients with trauma or ischemic 
disease were more vulnerable. More attention should be paid to 
neuropsychological complications such as cognitive dysfunction.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Misago self-expanding 
rapid-exchange nitinol stent system for the treatment of femoropopliteal 
occlusive disease in a prospective multicenter observational trial 
(ClinicalTrials.gov; identifier NCT01118117).
METHODS: Between April and October 2008, the registry enrolled 744 patients (496 
men; 69 ± 10 years) who had symptomatic ≥ 70% stenosis or occlusion of the 
superficial femoral or popliteal arteries treated with the Misago stent. Mean 
length of the 750 lesions was 63.9 mm; 282 (37.6%) vessels were completely 
occluded. Primary study endpoints were the need for target lesion 
revascularization (TLR) and event-free survival rates for the assessment of 
efficacy and safety, respectively. At 6 and 12 months post intervention, 
clinical symptoms of recurrent ischemia and/or claudication, Rutherford 
category, and ankle-brachial index (ABI) at rest were assessed.
RESULTS: In the study period, 945 stents were successfully deployed in the 750 
lesions. The overall TLR rate was 10.1% among 671 (90.3%) patients evaluated at 
1 year [3.1% among 709 (95.3%) patients at 6 months]. Event-free survival at 12 
months was 84.9%. Mean ABIs improved by ≥ 0.1 in three quarters of the patients 
(76.0%) over 12 months. The Rutherford grade improved or remained stable in the 
majority of patients (95.5%) after 1 year. Stent fractures (13 grade 1, 2 grade 
2) in 3.1% of stents examined radiographically (n=484) at 1 year were not 
related to any clinical events. Primary patency was recorded in 574 (87.6%) 
patients evaluated at 1 year post procedure.
CONCLUSION: The Misago rapid-exchange nitinol stent showed promising efficacy 
and safety results, with a low stent fracture rate, in patients with 
femoropopliteal disease, making it a safe and reliable treatment option.

BACKGROUND: In recent years (2000-2007), ambient levels of fine particulate 
matter (PM2.5) have continued to decline as a result of interventions, but the 
decline has been at a slower rate than previous years (1980-2000). Whether these 
more recent and slower declines of PM2.5 levels continue to improve life 
expectancy and whether they benefit all populations equally is unknown.
METHODS: We assembled a data set for 545 U.S. counties consisting of yearly 
county-specific average PM2.5, yearly county-specific life expectancy, and 
several potentially confounding variables measuring socioeconomic status, 
smoking prevalence, and demographic characteristics for the years 2000 and 2007. 
We used regression models to estimate the association between reductions in 
PM2.5 and changes in life expectancy for the period from 2000 to 2007.
RESULTS: A decrease of 10 μg/m in the concentration of PM2.5 was associated with 
an increase in mean life expectancy of 0.35 years (SD = 0.16 years, P = 0.033). 
This association was stronger in more urban and densely populated counties.
CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in PM2.5 were associated with improvements in life 
expectancy for the period from 2000 to 2007. Air pollution control in the last 
decade has continued to have a positive impact on public health.

OBJECTIVE: Twenty years ago, the groundbreaking discovery that rearranged during 
transfection (RET) mutations underlie multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN2) and 
familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC) ushered in the era of personalized 
medicine. MEN2-associated signs, taking time to manifest, can be subtle. This 
study sought to clarify to what extent conventional estimates of 
1:200 000-500 000 underestimate the incidence of RET mutations in the 
population.
DESIGN: Included in this retrospective investigation were 333 RET carriers born 
between 1951 and 2000 and operated on at the largest German surgical referral 
center (286 carriers) or elsewhere (47 carriers).
METHODS: To estimate the incidence of RET mutations, the number of RET carriers 
born in Germany in five decades (1951-1960, 1961-1970, 1971-1980, 1981-1990, and 
1991-2000) was divided by the corresponding number of German live births.
RESULTS: Owing to improved diagnosis and capture of FMTC and MEN2 patients, 
minimum incidence estimates increased over time: overall from 5.0 (1951-1960) to 
9.9 (1991-2000) per million live births and year (P=0.008), and by American 
Thyroid Association/ATA class from 1.7 to 3.7 for ATA class C (P=0.008); from 
1.8 to 2.7 for ATA class A (P=0.017); from 1.5 to 2.2 for ATA class B (P=0.20); 
and from 0 to 1.4 for ATA class D mutations per million live births and year 
(P=0.008). Based on 1991-2000 incidence estimates the prevalence in Germany is 
∼1:80 000 inhabitants.
CONCLUSIONS: The molecular minimum incidence estimate of ≈1:100 000 was two- to 
fivefold greater than conventional estimates of 1:200 000-500 000.

PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a telemedicine diabetic retinopathy 
(DR) screening program in rural Southern India that conducts 1-off screening 
camps (i.e., screening offered once) in villages and to assess the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of different screening intervals.
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis using a Markov model.
PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of 1000 rural diabetic patients aged 40 
years who had not been previously screened for DR and who were followed over a 
25-year period in Chennai, India.
METHODS: We interviewed 249 people with diabetes using the time trade-off method 
to estimate utility values associated with DR. Patient and provider costs of 
telemedicine screening and hospital-based DR treatment were estimated through 
interviews with 100 diabetic patients, sampled when attending screening in rural 
camps (n = 50) or treatment at the base hospital in Chennai (n = 50), and with 
program and hospital managers. The sensitivity and specificity of the DR 
screening test were assessed in comparison with diagnosis using a gold standard 
method for 346 diabetic patients. Other model parameters were derived from the 
literature. A Markov model was developed in TreeAge Pro 2009 (TreeAge Software 
Inc, Williamstown, MA) using these data.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from 
the current teleophthalmology program of 1-off screening in comparison with no 
screening program and the cost-utility of this program at different screening 
intervals.
RESULTS: By using the World Health Organization threshold of cost-effectiveness, 
the current rural teleophthalmology program was cost-effective ($1320 per QALY) 
compared with no screening from a health provider perspective. Screening 
intervals of up to a frequency of screening every 2 years also were 
cost-effective, but annual screening was not (>$3183 per QALY). From a societal 
perspective, telescreening up to a frequency of once every 5 years was 
cost-effective, but not more frequently.
CONCLUSIONS: From a health provider perspective, a 1-off DR telescreening 
program is cost-effective compared with no screening in this rural Indian 
setting. Increasing the frequency of screening up to 2 years also is 
cost-effective. The results are dependent on the administrative costs of 
establishing and maintaining screening at regular intervals and on achieving 
sufficient coverage.

Sowing the seeds of cancer: telomeres and age-associated tumorigenesis.

Pereira B(1), Ferreira MG.

Author information:

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advances in the health system and medical sciences are 
continuously pushing the barrier of life-expectancy. As a consequence, humans 
are being increasingly afflicted by age-associated diseases, such as cancer. The 
challenge now lies in understanding the mechanisms underlying ageing in order to 
reduce the lifetime risk for cancer.
RECENT FINDINGS: In long-lived mammals, telomere length and restriction of 
telomerase activity are important barriers preventing the uncontrolled cell 
division. Absence of telomerase dictates the continuous telomere erosion with 
each cell division, thus restraining the proliferation of incipient tumour 
cells. However, recent findings have revealed the unintended consequences of 
telomere control of cell division. Cells with short telomeres accumulate in 
older individuals increasing the risk of telomere depletion. Loss of telomere 
protection results in tetraploidization and genomic instability characteristic 
of epithelial cancers. Additionally, telomere shortening blocks cell 
proliferation and induces cell senescence. Senescent cells secrete 
proinflammatory factors and reactive oxygen species that increase the likelihood 
of cellular transformation and create the perfect soil for cancer development.
SUMMARY: Telomere shortening thus provides an example of antagonist pleiotropy, 
in which a beneficial characteristic that acts during the reproductive years of 
an organism may, later in life, contain the seed to its demise.

The usefulness of electron beam (E-beam) irradiation to increase the shelf life 
of whole fresh pork loin stored at 4°C has been studied. The shelf life was 
extended from 5 to 11 and 20 days after the application of 1 and 2 kGy, 
respectively. If a temperature abuse situation were to occur during product 
distribution (e.g., increase to 8°C), the shelf life would be extended from 3 to 
8 and 15 days, respectively, after application of the same doses. When 
considering Listeria monocytogenes from a public health point of view, the 
irradiated whole fresh loin may be marketable for periods longer than 2 weeks, 
thus guaranteeing a practically Listeria-free product. Irradiation produced no 
important changes in the rheological characteristics of the meat. Although the 
sensory quality of irradiated meat was scored lower than the control immediately 
after irradiation, after 5 days in storage, irradiated meat scored higher than 
or not different from the control.

Impact on health inequalities of rising prosperity in England 1998-2007, and 
implications for performance incentives: longitudinal ecological study.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the uneven rise in prosperity between 1999 and 
2008 accounted for differential increases in life expectancy in English local 
authorities.
DESIGN: Longitudinal ecological study.
SETTING: 324 local authorities in England, classified by their baseline level of 
deprivation. M: ain outcome measures Multivariable regression was used to 
investigate the association between trends in prosperity between 1998 and 2007 
and trends in life expectancy. Trends in health inequalities were assessed by 
comparing the experience of Spearhead local authorities (the 70 most deprived in 
1998) with the average for all English local authorities.
RESULTS: Those local authorities that experienced the greatest improvement in 
prosperity experienced greater increases in life expectancy. With each 1% 
absolute decline in unemployment, life expectancy increased by 2.2 (95% 
confidence interval 0.5 to 3.8) months in men and by 1.7 (0.4 to 3.1) months in 
women. With each £1000 increase in average household income in a local 
authority, life expectancy increased by 1.4 (0.3 to 2.5) months in men and by 
1.1 (0.2 to 1.9) months in women. The more deprived a local authority was in 
1998, the lower the rate at which life expectancy improved.
CONCLUSION: Decreases in unemployment and increases in average income in an area 
explained, to a large extent, why some local authorities "performed" better than 
others. Health inequalities between Spearhead and all local authorities widened 
during the period of rising prosperity, but they would have widened to an even 
greater extent had unemployment not fallen at a faster rate in more deprived 
areas. With worsening economic trends over the next 10 years, this research 
suggests that increases in life expectancy are likely to be smaller and health 
inequalities may widen at a faster rate than in the previous decade. Allocating 
resources to local authorities on the basis of their "performance" at increasing 
life expectancy is likely to reward more affluent areas rather than 
disadvantaged areas with greater needs, exacerbating the problem.

Long-term aerobic exercise is associated with greater muscle strength throughout 
the life span.

Crane JD(1), Macneil LG, Tarnopolsky MA.

Author information:
(1)Department of Kinesiology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

Aging is associated with a progressive decline in muscle strength, muscle mass, 
and aerobic capacity, which reduces mobility and impairs quality of life in 
elderly adults. Exercise is commonly employed to improve muscle function in 
individuals of all ages; however, chronic aerobic exercise is believed to 
largely impact cardiovascular function and oxidative metabolism, with minimal 
effects on muscle mass and strength. To study the effects of long-term aerobic 
exercise on muscle strength, we recruited 74 sedentary (SED) or highly 
aerobically active (ACT) men and women from within three distinct age groups 
(young: 20-39 years, middle: 40-64 years, and older: 65-86 years) and tested 
their aerobic capacity, isometric grip and knee extensor strength, and dynamic 1 
repetition maximum knee extension. As expected, ACT subjects had greater maximal 
oxygen uptake and peak aerobic power output compared with SED subjects (p < 
.05). Grip strength relative to body weight declined with age (p < .05) and was 
greater in ACT compared with SED subjects in both hands (p < .05). Similarly, 
relative maximal isometric knee extension torque declined with age (p < .05) and 
was higher in ACT versus SED individuals in both legs (p < .05). Absolute and 
relative 1 repetition maximum knee extension declined with age (p < .05) and 
were greater in ACT versus SED groups (p < .05). Knee extensor strength was 
associated with a greater amount of leg lean mass in the ACT subjects (p < .05). 
In summary, long-term aerobic exercise appears to attenuate age-related 
reductions in muscle strength in addition to its cardiorespiratory and metabolic 
benefits.

Biological age (BA) is useful for examining differences in aging rates. 
Nevertheless, little consensus exists regarding optimal methods for calculating 
BA. The aim of this study is to compare the predictive ability of five BA 
algorithms. The sample included 9,389 persons, aged 30-75 years, from National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. During the 18-year follow-up, 1,843 
deaths were counted. Each BA algorithm was compared with chronological age on 
the basis of predictive sensitivity and strength of association with mortality. 
Results found that the Klemera and Doubal method was the most reliable predictor 
of mortality and performed significantly better than chronological age. 
Furthermore, when included with chronological age in a model, Klemera and Doubal 
method had more robust predictive ability and caused chronological age to no 
longer be significantly associated with mortality. Given the potential of BA to 
highlight heterogeneity, the Klemera and Doubal method algorithm may be useful 
for studying a number of questions regarding the biology of aging.

Analysis of media campaign promoting smoking cessation suggests it was 
cost-effective in prompting quit attempts.

Foundation, Washington, D.C., USA. avillanti@legacyforhealth.org

The American Legacy Foundation's national EX® campaign, which ran on radio and 
television in 2008, was designed to promote smoking cessation among adult 
smokers. The incremental societal cost of EX, in 2009 dollars, was $166 million. 
Data from eight designated media market areas studied indicate that in a 
hypothetical nationwide cohort of 2,012,000 adult smokers ages 18-49, EX 
resulted in 52,979 additional quit attempts and 4,238 additional quits and saved 
4,450 quality-adjusted life-years. Incremental cost-utility estimates comparing 
EX to the status quo-that is, the situation that would have existed in the eight 
markets with no campaign and no change in cessation behavior-ranged from a cost 
of $37,355 to $81,301 per quality-adjusted life-year, which suggests that the 
campaign was cost-effective. These findings bolster previous evidence that 
national mass media campaigns for smoking cessation can lower smoking prevalence 
in a cost-effective manner, among both adults and young adults ages 18-24 who 
are smokers.

Simulation of quitting smoking in the military shows higher lifetime medical 
spending more than offset by productivity gains.

Despite the documented benefits of quitting smoking, studies have found that 
smokers who quit may have higher lifetime medical costs, in part because of 
increased risk for medical conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, brought on by 
associated weight gain. Using a simulation model and data on 612,332 adult 
smokers in the US Department of Defense's TRICARE Prime health plan in 2008, we 
estimated that cessation accompanied by weight gain would increase average life 
expectancy by 3.7 years, and that the average lifetime reduction in medical 
expenditures from improved health ($5,600) would be offset by additional 
expenditures resulting from prolonged life ($7,300). Results varied by age and 
sex: For females ages 18-44 at time of cessation, there would be net savings of 
$1,200 despite additional medical expenditures from prolonged life. Avoidance of 
weight gain after quitting smoking would increase average life expectancy by 
four additional months and reduce mean extra spending resulting from prolonged 
life by $700. Overall, the average net lifetime health care cost increase of 
$1,700 or less per ex-smoker would be modest and, for employed people, more than 
offset by even one year's worth of productivity gains. These results boost the 
case for smoking cessation programs in the military in particular, along with 
not selling cigarettes in commissaries or at reduced prices.

Parkinson's disease (PD) has become a major health problem affecting 1.5% of the 
world's population over 65 years of age. As life expectancy has increased so has 
the occurrence of PD. The primary direct consequence of this disease is the loss 
of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum. As the 
intensity of motor dysfunction increases, the symptomatic triad of bradykinesia, 
tremors-at-rest, and rigidity occur. Progressive neurodegeneration may also 
impact non-DA neurotransmitter systems including cholinergic, noradrenergic, and 
serotonergic, often leading to the development of depression, sleep 
disturbances, dementia, and autonomic nervous system failure. L-DOPA is the most 
efficacious oral delivery treatment for controlling motor symptoms; however, 
this approach is ineffective regarding nonmotor symptoms. New treatment 
strategies are needed designed to provide neuroprotection and encourage 
neurogenesis and synaptogenesis to slow or reverse this disease process. The 
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met receptor system is a member of the growth 
factor family and has been shown to protect against degeneration of DA neurons 
in animal models. Recently, small angiotensin-based blood-brain barrier 
penetrant mimetics have been developed that activate this HGF/c-Met system. 
These compounds may offer a new and novel approach to the treatment of 
Parkinson's disease.

OBJECTIVE: In order to compare the cost and to find the cost-effectiveness ratio 
of 0.5 mg/day entecavir versus pegylated interferon in the suppression of the 
viral replication and the quality of life of chronic hepatitis B patients based 
on a previously developed economic evaluation by Spackman y Veenstra, we 
performed, previous data transferability analysis, an adaptation of the model to 
the Venezuelan reality.
METHODS: To adapt the economic evaluation, we assumed the probabilities of 
transition between states, in accordance with the effectiveness reported in the 
original evaluation. The hypothetical cohort was based on the characteristics of 
patients in recent clinical trials. The model results included the cost of each 
treatment alternative, entecavir and pegylated interferon, as well as quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: Entecavir 0.5 mgprovides 18,25 QALYs compared with 18,12 QALYs provided 
by pegylated interferon. The cost per QALY was 5.257 BsF for entecavir compared 
with pegylated interferon whose cost ranges 6.716 y 7.358 BsF per QALY 
CONCLUSIONS: Entecavir 0.5 mg provides a greater amount of QALYs and a better 
cost-effectiveness ratio than pegylated interferon showing extended dominancy 
over this.

Cost-effectiveness of omalizumab for uncontrolled allergic asthma in the 
Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Omalizumab, licensed for patients with uncontrolled persistent 
allergic (IgE mediated) asthma, was found to be cost-effective based upon its 
clinical trial data. Observational studies have been undertaken to determine the 
real life outcomes of using omalizumab in the community.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab based upon 
observational data from the Netherlands and compare to its cost-effectiveness 
using clinical trial data.
METHODS: An observational study (eXpeRience) recruited allergic asthma patients 
eligible for Omalizumab therapy and followed them while on treatment. At 1 year, 
data from the Dutch patients enrolled in eXpeRience were examined to estimate 
the number of exacerbations and resource use while on omalizumab therapy 
compared to the year prior to omalizumab use. Observational data were used in a 
Markov model to calculate the lifetime cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: In the 1 year prior to omalizumab therapy the per-person rate of 
exacerbations was 3.39 compared to 1.07 in the year taking omalizumab. The 
discounted incremental lifetime additional costs for omalizumab were €55,865 for 
1.46 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALY), resulting in €38,371/QALY. 
Using the INNOVATE clinical trial outcomes and current resource use, the prior 
ratio was €34,911/QALY, similar to the observational ratio. As in all 
observational studies, the main limitation is obtaining complete and accurate 
data. Patients with missing exacerbation or response data were excluded from 
this analysis.
CONCLUSION: Non-clinical trial experience with omalizumab supported the finding 
of fewer exacerbations in the allergic asthma population while treated with 
omalizumab, and therapy was found to continue to have an attractive 
cost-effectiveness ratio.

The use of cost-effectiveness analysis for pediatric immunization in developing 
countries.

CONTEXT: Developing countries face critical choices for introducing needed, 
effective, but expensive new vaccines, especially given the accelerated need to 
decrease the mortality of children under age five and the increased immunization 
resources available from international donors. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) 
is a tool that decision makers can use for efficiently allocating expanding 
resources. Its use in developing countries, however, lags behind that in 
industrialized countries.
METHODS: We explored how CEA could be made more relevant to immunization 
policymaking in developing countries by identifying the limitations for using 
CEA in developing countries and the impact of donor funding on the CEA 
estimation. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using formal search 
protocols and hand searching indexed and gray literature sources. We then 
systematically summarized the application of CEA in industrialized and 
developing countries through thematic analysis, focusing on pediatric 
immunization and methodological and contextual issues relevant to developing 
countries.
FINDINGS: Industrialized and developing countries use CEA differently. The use 
of the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) outcome measure and an alternative 
generalized cost-effectiveness analysis approach is restricted to developing 
countries. In pediatric CEAs, the paucity of evaluations and the lack of 
attention to overcoming the methodological limitations pertinent to children's 
cognitive and development distinctiveness, such as discounting and preference 
characterization, means that pediatric interventions may be systematically 
understudied and undervalued. The ability to generate high-quality CEA evidence 
in child health is further threatened by an inadequate consideration of the 
impact of donor funding (such as GAVI immunization funding) on measurement 
uncertainty and the determination of opportunity cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Greater attention to pediatric interventions and donor funding in 
the conduct of CEA could lead to better policies and thus more worthwhile and 
good-value programs to benefit children's health in developing countries.

Projected socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of obesity among 
Australian adults.

JE, Peeters A.

OBJECTIVE: To project prevalence of normal weight, overweight and obesity by 
educational attainment, assuming a continuation of the observed individual 
weight change in the 5-year follow-up of the national population survey, the 
Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle study (AusDiab; 2000-2005).
METHODS: Age-specific transition probabilities between BMI categories, estimated 
using logistic regression, were entered into education-level-specific, 
incidence-based, multi-state life tables. Assuming a continuation of the weight 
change observed in AusDiab, these life tables estimate the prevalence of normal 
weight, overweight and obesity for Australian adults with low (secondary), 
medium (diploma) and high (degree) levels of education between 2005 and 2025.
RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity among individuals with secondary level 
educational attainment is estimated to increase from 23% in 2000 to 44% in 2025. 
Among individuals with a degree qualification or higher, it will increase from 
14% to 30%. If all current educational inequalities in weight change could be 
eliminated, the projected difference in the prevalence of obesity by 2025 
between the highest and lowest educated categories would only be reduced by half 
(to a 6 percentage point difference from 14 percentage points).
CONCLUSION: We predict that almost half of Australian adults with low 
educational status will be obese by 2025. Current trends in obesity have the 
potential to drive an increase in the absolute difference in obesity prevalence 
between educational categories in future years.
IMPLICATIONS: Unless obesity prevention and management strategies focus 
specifically on narrowing social inequalities in obesity, inequalities in health 
are likely to widen.

Trends of gender gaps in life expectancy in Japan, 1947-2010: associations with 
gender mortality ratio and a social development index.

School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.

AIM: This study analyzed the trend of gender gaps in life expectancy (GGLE) in 
Japan between 1947 and 2010, and explored the correlations of GGLE with gender 
mortality ratio and social development indices.
METHODS: Using GGLE and social indices data collected from the official 
websites, we carried out trends analysis of GGLE by calculating segmented 
average growth rates for different periods. We explored the association between 
GGLE and all-cause mortality; and between GGLE and Human Development Index (HDI) 
while controlling for time trend, by computing the generalized additive models 
based on the software R (version 2.15).
RESULTS: Japan's GGLE increased in a fluctuating fashion. Across 53 years, the 
average growth rates varied widely: 0.14% (1947-1956), 1.43% (1956-1974), 1.06% 
(1974-2004) and -0.60% (2004-2010) (overall average 0.87%). The value of GGLE 
peaked to 7.00 years in 2004, and then has slowly declined (6.75 years in 2010). 
Age-adjusted all-cause gender mortality ratio had a statistically positive 
association with GGLE (P<0.01), whereas HDI was found to have no such 
association.
CONCLUSION: The increased trend of GGLE in Japan could be partly explained by 
increased disease-specific mortality ratios (male/female), especially those 
involving chronic bronchitis and emphysema, diseases of the liver, suicide and 
cancer. The recent decline of GGLE might imply that Japanese women have been 
catching up with the lifestyle of men, resulting in similar mortality patterns. 
This calls for gender-sensitive approaches to developing policies and programs 
that will help sustain healthy lifestyles to combat smoking and alcohol intake, 
and social support to prevent suicide.

The CareWell-primary care program: design of a cluster controlled trial and 
process evaluation of a complex intervention targeting community-dwelling frail 
elderly.

Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. f.ruikes@elg.umcn.nl

BACKGROUND: With increasing age and longevity, the rising number of frail elders 
with complex and numerous health-related needs demands a coordinated health care 
delivery system integrating cure, care and welfare. Studies on the effectiveness 
of such comprehensive chronic care models targeting frail elders show 
inconclusive results. The CareWell-primary care program is a complex 
intervention targeting community-dwelling frail elderly people, that aims to 
prevent functional decline, improve quality of life, and reduce or postpone 
hospital and nursing home admissions of community dwelling frail elderly.
METHODS/DESIGN: The CareWell-primary care study includes a (cost-) effectiveness 
study and a comprehensive process evaluation. In a one-year pragmatic, cluster 
controlled trial, six general practices are non-randomly recruited to adopt the 
CareWell-primary care program and six control practices will deliver 'care as 
usual'. Each practice includes a random sample of fifty frail elders aged 70 
years or above in the cost-effectiveness study. A sample of patients and 
informal caregivers and all health care professionals participating in the 
CareWell-primary care program are included in the process evaluation. In the 
cost-effectiveness study, the primary outcome is the level of functional 
abilities as measured with the Katz-15 index. Hierarchical mixed-effects 
regression models/multilevel modeling approach will be used, since the study 
participants are nested within the general practices. Furthermore, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated as costs per QALY gained and as 
costs weighed against functional abilities. In the process evaluation, mixed 
methods will be used to provide insight in the implementation degree of the 
program, patients' and professionals' approval of the program, and the barriers 
and facilitators to implementation.
DISCUSSION: The CareWell-primary care study will provide new insights into the 
(cost-) effectiveness, feasibility, and barriers and facilitators for 
implementation of this complex intervention in primary care.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The CareWell-primary care study is registered in the 
ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration System: NCT01499797.

Targeted cellular ionic calcium chelation by oxalates: Implications for the 
treatment of tumor cells.

Embi A(1), Scherlag BJ, Embi PJ, Menes M, Po SS.

(1)Miami, Florida, USA. abe@embi.net.

BACKGROUND: In malignant melanoma, it has been published that up to 40% of 
cancer patients will suffer from brain metastasis. The prognosis for these 
patients is poor, with a life expectancy of 4 to 6 months. Calcium exchange is 
involved in numerous cell functions. Recently, three types of cellular calcium 
sequestration have been reported in the medical literature. The first describes 
a transgenic mouse model in which an increase of aberrant calcium channels 
triggers hypertrophy and apoptosis. The second provides a protective mechanism 
whereby astrocytes in the brain inhibit apoptosis of tumor cells by moving ionic 
calcium out of the tumor cells thru gap junctions. The third is via calcium 
chelation, which causes cell apoptosis by converting ionic calcium into a 
calcium salt. This process has been shown to operate in atrial myocardial cells, 
thus not allowing the intracellular calcium stores to flow through the myocytes 
intercalated discs. Ideally chemotherapeutic agents would be those that initiate 
apoptosis in tumor cells.
PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that the recent reported 
intracellular calcium sequestration by oxalate chelation, due to its chemical 
process of converting ionic calcium into a calcium salt, may inhibit the 
protective effect of astrocytes on brain tumor metastasized melanoma cells by 
not allowing free calcium to leave the metastatic cells, simultaneously 
apoptosis of tumor and some healthy adjacent cells could occur. This hypothesis 
could be extended to include other cancerous tumors such as skin cancers amongst 
others.
TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: Using the experimental model showing the protective 
mechanism of co-cultured reactive astrocytes and tumor cells treated with 
oxalates could be used to test this hypothesis in vitro. The calcium specific 
von Kossa technique could be used to confirm the presence of chelated 
intracellular calcium architecture of the metastatic cells (which is a sign of 
apoptosis), and extracellular calcium chelation stores of the Astrocytes (which 
has been shown to slow neural conduction).
IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The life expectancy in patients with 
metastasized malignant melanoma brain tumors could be significantly prolonged if 
the chemotherapeutic issue of brain metastasis is overcome. Other cancerous 
tumors can also be treated by this Targeted Chelation Approach. Ionic calcium 
sequestration using naturally occurring calcium chelators, viz., oxalates, could 
accomplish this desired outcome.

The impact of demographic change on the estimated future burden of infectious 
diseases: examples from hepatitis B and seasonal influenza in the Netherlands.

and the Environment, Bilthoven, the Netherlands. scott.mcdonald@rivm.nl

BACKGROUND: For accurate estimation of the future burden of communicable 
diseases, the dynamics of the population at risk - namely population growth and 
population ageing - need to be taken into account. Accurate burden estimates are 
necessary for informing policy-makers regarding the planning of vaccination and 
other control, intervention, and prevention measures. Our aim was to 
qualitatively explore the impact of population ageing on the estimated future 
burden of seasonal influenza and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the 
Netherlands, in the period 2000-2030.
METHODS: Population-level disease burden was quantified using the 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) measure applied to all health outcomes 
following acute infection. We used national notification data, pre-defined 
disease progression models, and a simple model of demographic dynamics to 
investigate the impact of population ageing on the burden of seasonal influenza 
and HBV. Scenario analyses were conducted to explore the potential impact of 
intervention-associated changes in incidence rates.
RESULTS: Including population dynamics resulted in increasing burden over the 
study period for influenza, whereas a relatively stable future burden was 
predicted for HBV. For influenza, the increase in DALYs was localised within YLL 
for the oldest age-groups (55 and older), and for HBV the effect of longer life 
expectancy in the future was offset by a reduction in incidence in the 
age-groups most at risk of infection. For both infections, the predicted disease 
burden was greater than if a static demography was assumed: 1.0 (in 2000) to 
2.3-fold (in 2030) higher DALYs for influenza; 1.3 (in 2000) to 1.5-fold (in 
2030) higher for HBV.
CONCLUSIONS: There are clear, but diverging effects of an ageing population on 
the estimated disease burden of influenza and HBV in the Netherlands. Replacing 
static assumptions with a dynamic demographic approach appears essential for 
deriving realistic burden estimates for informing health policy.

An economic and ecological perspective of ethanol production from renewable agro 
waste: a review.

Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, 475001, India. latikabhatia1@yahoo.co.uk.

Agro-industrial wastes are generated during the industrial processing of 
agricultural products. These wastes are generated in large amounts throughout 
the year, and are the most abundant renewable resources on earth. Due to the 
large availability and composition rich in compounds that could be used in other 
processes, there is a great interest on the reuse of these wastes, both from 
economical and environmental view points. The economic aspect is based on the 
fact that such wastes may be used as low-cost raw materials for the production 
of other value-added compounds, with the expectancy of reducing the production 
costs. The environmental concern is because most of the agro-industrial wastes 
contain phenolic compounds and/or other compounds of toxic potential; which may 
cause deterioration of the environment when the waste is discharged to the 
nature. Although the production of bioethanol offers many benefits, more 
research is needed in the aspects like feedstock preparation, fermentation 
technology modification, etc., to make bioethanol more economically viable.

Mortality trends in patients with diabetes in Taiwan: a nationwide survey in 
2000-2009.

Taiwan.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Medical systems and care for diabetes have changed greatly 
in Taiwan in recent years. This study investigated mortality trends in patients 
with diabetes in Taiwan from 2000 to 2009.
METHODS: We linked the National Health Insurance (NHI) claims database, which 
contains data on 99% of the population of Taiwan, to the National Death Registry 
and Cancer Registry. Patients were classified as having diabetes if they had at 
least one hospital admission or three or more outpatient visits with a diabetes 
diagnostic code in each calendar year. Mortality data from the Collaboration 
Center of Health Information Application were used to estimate age- and 
sex-specific mortality rates, all-cause mortality, and life expectancy (LE).
RESULTS: The mortality of patients with diabetes in Taiwan decreased 
continuously from 2000 to 2009 for both sexes and all age groups; the mortality 
rate was generally higher for men than for women (3.92% vs. 3.29% in 2000; 3.64% 
vs. 3.11% in 2005, and 3.12% vs. 2.71% in 2009, all p < 0.05). Diabetic patients 
had a shorter LE than the entire population, although this difference decreased 
over time. The estimated loss of life due to diabetes was 6.1 years in women and 
5.3 years in men in 2009, when diabetes was diagnosed at the age of 40. The four 
major causes of death were diabetes, malignancies, heart diseases, and 
cerebrovascular diseases.
CONCLUSION: The mortality of diabetic patients in Taiwan decreased from 2000 to 
2009. Although patients with diabetes had a shorter LE than the entire 
population, the difference decreased over time.

Paediatric patients have a higher average risk of developing cancer compared 
with adults receiving the same dose. The longer life expectancy in children 
allows more time for any harmful effects of radiation to manifest, and 
developing organs and tissues are more sensitive to the effects of radiation. 
This publication aims to provide guiding principles of radiological protection 
for referring clinicians and clinical staff performing diagnostic imaging and 
interventional procedures for paediatric patients. It begins with a brief 
description of the basic concepts of radiological protection, followed by the 
general aspects of radiological protection, including principles of 
justification and optimisation. Guidelines and suggestions for radiological
