BACKGROUND: The United States Preventive Services Task Force supports 
individualised decision-making for prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based 
screening in men aged 55-69. Knowing how the potential benefits and harms of 
screening vary by an individual's risk of developing prostate cancer could 
inform decision-making about screening at both an individual and population 
level. This modelling study examined the benefit-harm tradeoffs and the 
cost-effectiveness of a risk-tailored screening programme compared to age-based 
and no screening.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A life-table model, projecting age-specific prostate 
cancer incidence and mortality, was developed of a hypothetical cohort of 4.48 
million men in England aged 55 to 69 years with follow-up to age 90. Risk 
thresholds were based on age and polygenic profile. We compared no screening, 
age-based screening (quadrennial PSA testing from 55 to 69), and risk-tailored 
screening (men aged 55 to 69 years with a 10-year absolute risk greater than a 
threshold receive quadrennial PSA testing from the age they reach the risk 
threshold). The analysis was undertaken from the health service perspective, 
including direct costs borne by the health system for risk assessment, 
screening, diagnosis, and treatment. We used probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
to account for parameter uncertainty and discounted future costs and benefits at 
3.5% per year. Our analysis should be considered cautiously in light of 
limitations related to our model's cohort-based structure and the uncertainty of 
input parameters in mathematical models. Compared to no screening over 35 years 
follow-up, age-based screening prevented the most deaths from prostate cancer 
(39,272, 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 16,792-59,685) at the expense of 94,831 
(95% UI: 84,827-105,630) overdiagnosed cancers. Age-based screening was the 
least cost-effective strategy studied. The greatest number of quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) was generated by risk-based screening at a 10-year absolute 
risk threshold of 4%. At this threshold, risk-based screening led to one-third 
fewer overdiagnosed cancers (64,384, 95% UI: 57,382-72,050) but averted 6.3% 
fewer (9,695, 95% UI: 2,853-15,851) deaths from prostate cancer by comparison 
with age-based screening. Relative to no screening, risk-based screening at a 4% 
10-year absolute risk threshold was cost-effective in 48.4% and 57.4% of the 
simulations at willingness-to-pay thresholds of GBP£20,000 (US$26,000) and 
£30,000 ($39,386) per QALY, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of 
risk-tailored screening improved as the threshold rose.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this modelling study, offering screening to 
men at higher risk could potentially reduce overdiagnosis and improve the 
benefit-harm tradeoff and the cost-effectiveness of a prostate cancer screening 
program. The optimal threshold will depend on societal judgements of the 
appropriate balance of benefits-harms and cost-effectiveness.

Oral cavity cancer is the most frequent malignancy of the head and neck. 
Unfortunately, despite educational interventions for prevention and early 
diagnosis, oral cancer patients are often diagnosed in advanced stages 
associated with poor prognosis and life expectancy. Therefore, there is an 
urgent need to find noninvasive biomarkers to improve early detection of this 
tumor. Liquid biopsy has emerged as a valuable tool in medical oncology which 
provides new horizons for improving clinical decision making. Notably, cell-free 
microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of short non-coding RNAs, are emerging as novel 
noninvasive cancer biomarkers. Here, we provide an overview of the potential 
clinical application of cell-free miRNAs as diagnostic, prognostic, and 
therapeutic biomarkers in oral cancer.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death internationally. We 
aimed to model the impact of CVD preventive double therapy (a statin and 
anti-hypertensive) by clinician-assessed absolute risk level. An established and 
validated multi-state life-table model for the national New Zealand (NZ) 
population was adapted. The new version of the model specifically considered the 
60-64-year-old male population which was stratified by risk using a published 
NZ-specific CVD risk equation. The intervention period of treatment was for five 
years, but a lifetime horizon was used for measuring benefits and costs (a 
five-year horizon was also implemented). We found that for this group offering 
double therapy was highly cost-effective in all absolute risk categories (eg, 
NZ$1580 per QALY gained in the >20% in 5 years risk stratum; 95%UI: Dominant to 
NZ$3990). Even in the lowest risk stratum (≤5% risk in 5 years), the cost per 
QALY was only NZ$25,500 (NZ$28,200 and US$19,100 in 2018). At an individual 
level, the gain for those who responded to the screening offer and commenced 
preventive treatment ranged from 0.6 to 4.9 months of quality-adjusted life 
gained (or less than a month gain with a five-year horizon). Nevertheless, at 
the individual level, patient considerations are critical as some people may 
decide that this amount of average health gain does not justify taking daily 
medication.

CONTEXT: In autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD), exogenous glucocorticoid (GC) 
therapy is an imperfect substitute for physiological GC secretion. Patients on 
long-term steroid replacement have increased morbidity, reduced life expectancy, 
and poorer quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to restore adrenocortical 
steroidogenic function in recent-onset AAD.
DESIGN: An open-label, multicenter trial of immunotherapy and trophic 
stimulation in new-onset AAD was conducted. Serial measurement of serum and 
urine corticosteroids at baseline and throughout a 72-week follow-up period was 
performed.
SETTING: This study was conducted at the.
endocrine departments and clinical research facilities at 5 UK tertiary centers.
PATIENTS: Thirteen participants (9 female, 4 male; age 19-64 years) were 
included with AAD confirmed by high adrenocorticotropin, low circulating 
cortisol (basal < 100 nmol/L or post-tetracosactide < 300 nmol/L), and positive 
serum 21-hydroxylase antibodies.
INTERVENTION: All participants received dual therapy with B-lymphocyte-depleting 
immunotherapy (rituximab 1 g given twice) and repeated depot tetracosactide (1 
mg on alternate days for 12 weeks).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Restoration of normal GC secretion (stimulated cortisol > 
550 nmol/L) at week 48 was the main outcome measure.
RESULTS: Ten of 13 (77%) participants had detectable stimulated serum cortisol 
(26-265 nmol/L) at trial entry. Following intervention, 7 of 13 (54%) had an 
increase in stimulated cortisol measurement, with a peak response of 325 nmol/L 
at week 18 in 1 participant. Increased steroid metabolites, assayed by urine gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry at week 12 and week 48, was detected in 8 of 13 
(62%) individuals, reflecting an increase in endogenous steroidogenesis. Four of 
13 had residual adrenal function at 72 weeks.
CONCLUSION: Combined treatment with rituximab and depot tetracosactide did not 
restore normal adrenal function. Nevertheless, adrenocortical plasticity is 
demonstrated in some patients, and this has the potential to be exploited to 
improve adrenal function.

Botulinum toxin type A (BTA) injection in intrinsic laryngeal musculature may 
result in dysphagia and consequent loss of quality of life (QOL) in a percentage 
of patients. This study aims to evaluate pharyngeal motility as a putative cause 
for this change in swallow quality in light of high-resolution manometry (HRM). 
Twenty patients (95% females, median age 66 years) underwent high-resolution 
manometry before and after BTA injection. Dysphagia was evaluated based on a QOL 
dedicated questionnaire (SWAL-QOL) before and after BTA injection. Pharyngeal 
motility at the topography of the vellum, epiglottis, and upper esophageal 
sphincter (UES) were recorded. Eleven (55%) subjects had worsened QOL after BTA 
injection. In patients with worsened QOL, UES extension decreased (p = 0.005), 
UES residual pressure increased (p = 0.02), UES basal pressure decreased 
(p = 0.04), and velopharynx contraction duration decreased (p = 0.04). UES 
residual pressure increased (p = 0.01), velopharynx peak pressure (p = 0.04) and 
upstroke (p = 0.007) decreased in patients with maintained QOL. There was no 
difference between groups when comparing pre-injection values. UES extension 
(p = 0.01) and UES maximum relaxation time (p = 0.03) was lower in the group 
with worsened QOL after BTA as compared to no change in QOL. Pharyngeal motility 
as measured by HRM was not a predictor for post procedure dysphagia and the 
changes in motility after BTA injection does not seem to be a strong contributor 
to dysphagia.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relative importance of risk factors, treatments, and 
blood counts for the occurrence of vascular complications and their impact on 
life expectancy in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV).
METHODS: Nested case-control study within the Swedish MPN registry. From a 
cohort of 922 ET patients and 763 PV patients, 71 ET and 81 PV cases with 
vascular complications were compared with matched controls.
RESULTS: Incidence of vascular complications was 2.0 and 3.4 events per 100 
patient-years in ET and PV, respectively. At diagnosis, no significant risk 
factor differences were observed between cases and controls in neither of the 
diseases. At the time of vascular event, ET complication cases did not differ 
significantly from controls but in PV, cases had significantly higher WBCs and 
were to a lesser extent treated with anti-thrombotic and cytoreductive therapy. 
Life expectancy was significantly decreased in both ET and PV cases compared 
with controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of vascular complications is high in both ET and PV, and 
these complications have a considerable impact on life expectancy. The 
protective effect of anti-thrombotic and cytoreductive therapy for vascular 
complications in PV underscores the importance of avoiding undertreatment.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is one of the major unresolved health burdens 
accompanying the increase in life expectancy. The great paradigm shift for this 
disease has resulted from finding amyloid deposition and neurobrillary 
degeneration 20 years and 10 years, respectively, prior to onset of the typical 
clinical memory loss symptoms. The advent of AD biomarkers has enabled a 
molecular definition of AD, making the clinical definition almost dispensable. 
Various types of AD biomarkers are available in our country. Each biomarker 
reflects a particular process and stage of the disease. Although costs restrict 
their use, the biomarker analysis may be justified in certain clinical 
scenarios, such as an early onset or an atypical presentation of the disease. 
Today, the usefulness of biomarkers in AD clinical research is beyond question. 
Furthermore, the introduction of biomarkers into medical practice has led to 
significant changes in therapeutic interventions, even in the absence of 
disease-modifying drugs.

Publisher: La enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) es uno de los mayores flagelos aún no 
resueltos que acompañan al aumento de la expectativa de vida. El gran cambio de 
paradigma en los últimos años fue consecuencia de descubrir que el depósito 
amiloideo se presenta hasta 20 años antes, y la degeneración neurofibrilar hasta 
10 años antes, de que aparezca la sintomatología clínica típica de pérdida de 
memoria. La aparición de los biomarcadores permitió reestructurar el concepto de 
la EA, intentándose llegar a una definición molecular de la misma casi 
prescindiendo de la emblemática clínica. Existen distintos tipos de 
biomarcadores de EA disponibles en nuestro país. Cada uno nos habla de un 
proceso y un momento distinto de la enfermedad. Aunque su uso clínico aún se 
encuentra restringido por cuestiones de costos, existen escenarios particulares 
en donde sí se justifica, casi siempre en relación a presentaciones clínicas 
atípicas o de comienzo muy temprano. Sin embargo, hoy en día ya nadie discute 
que son imprescindibles en investigaciones clínicas sobre EA. La incorporación 
de biomarcadores en la práctica médica ha generado cambios significativos en la 
intervención terapéutica de los pacientes, incluso en un contexto en el que 
todavía no hay medicamentos modificadores de la enfermedad.

The proportion of adult population has increased globally and the current 
projections indicate that, by 2050, the group of 60 years and older will 
represent 21.1%. There are now vaccines exclusively designed for adults and 
others that are applied in early life but need to be updated later in life. 
Vaccines for adults are not only based on their respective age group but are 
also linked to risk factors like occupation, life style, health situation, among 
others. At the same time, longevity brings with it a weakening of the immune 
response to vaccines, a process known as immunosenescence representing an 
increasing challenge to adequately protect this age group. For some time, WHO 
has been promoting the term "Vaccination through the life course" allowing for 
an extension of the vaccination vision and taking adults as an integral part 
into the national vaccination programs and calendars. There are several vaccine 
preventable diseases affecting adults, but those associated with influenza virus 
and pneumococcus are the ones that affect the largest age group. Several 
recommendations include, additionally, others to prevent diphtheria, tetanus, 
whooping cough, hepatitis A and B, meningococcus, chickenpox, measles, rubella, 
mumps, herpes zoster, human papilloma virus and others. There are still many 
challenges to overcome in order to fully include adults, particularly health 
personnel, and to make vaccines extensively valued as a prevention tool in order 
to achieve a healthy life.

Publisher: La proporción de población de adultos se ha incrementado globalmente 
y las proyecciones muestran que para el año 2050 los mayores de 60 años 
representarán el 21.1%. Actualmente se dispone de vacunas dirigidas 
exclusivamente a adultos y otras que se aplican en niños pero que se deben 
actualizar a lo largo de la vida. Las vacunas en adultos se administran, no solo 
por el grupo de edad al que pertenecen, sino también por factores como 
ocupación, estilos de vida o estado de salud. Al mismo tiempo, la longevidad 
disminuye la respuesta inmune a las vacunas por el fenómeno de 
inmunosenescencia, lo cual representa un desafío para proteger adecuadamente a 
este grupo. Desde hace varios años la OMS, ha propiciado la utilización del 
término "Vacunación en el curso de la vida" lo cual permite extender la visión 
de la vacunación y considerar al adulto como una parte integral de los planes y 
calendarios de inmunización. Existen varias enfermedades prevenibles por vacunas 
en adultos, pero aquellas asociadas al virus de influenza y al neumococo, son 
las que comprenden el grupo más extenso. Diversas recomendaciones incluyen, 
además de estas vacunas, otras dirigidas a prevenir difteria, tétanos, tos 
convulsa, hepatitis A y B, meningococo, varicela, sarampión, rubéola, 
parotiditis, herpes zóster, virus del papiloma humano y otras enfermedades. Se 
reconocen muchos desafíos a superar para poder incorporar plenamente al adulto, 
incluyendo al personal de salud, y lograr que la vacunación sea una herramienta 
de prevención valorada ampliamente para el desarrollo de una vida saludable.

BACKGROUND: Statistical data on the incidence, mortality, and burden of breast 
cancer and the relevant risk factors are valuable for policy-making. We aimed to 
estimate breast cancer incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) by country, gender, age group, and social-demographic status between 
1990 and 2017.
METHODS: We extracted breast cancer data from the 2017 Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) study from 1990 through 2017 in 195 countries and territories. Data about 
the number of breast cancer incident cases, deaths, DALYs, and the 
age-standardized rates were collected. We also estimated the risk factors 
attributable to breast cancer deaths and DALYs using the comparative risk 
assessment framework of the GBD study.
RESULTS: In 2017, the global incidence of breast cancer increased to 1,960,681 
cases. The high social-development index (SDI) quintile included the highest 
number of breast cancer death cases. Between 2007 and 2017, the ASDR of breast 
cancer declined globally, especially in high SDI and high middle SDI countries. 
The related DALYs were 17,708,600 in 2017 with high middle SDI quintile as the 
highest contributor. Of the deaths and DALYs, alcohol use was the greatest 
contributor in most GBD regions and other contributors included high body mass 
index (BMI) and high fasting plasma glucose.
CONCLUSION: The increasing global breast cancer burden is mainly observed in 
lower SDI countries; in higher SDI countries, the breast cancer burden tends to 
be relieving. Therefore, steps against attributable risk factors should be taken 
to reduce breast cancer burden in lower SDI countries.

The TaqMan-based quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) method and the 
Plate Count (PC) method are both used in combination with primary and secondary 
mathematical modeling, to describe the growth curves of Leuconostoc 
mesenteroides and Weissella viridescens in vacuum-packaged meat products during 
storage under different isothermal conditions. Vacuum-Packaged Morcilla (VPM), a 
typical cooked blood sausage, is used as a representative meat product, with the 
aim of improving shelf-life prediction methods for those sorts of meat products. 
The standard curves constructed by qPCR showed good linearity between the cycle 
threshold (CT) and log10 CFU/g, demonstrating the high precision and the 
reproducible results of the qPCR method. The curves were used for the 
quantification of L. mesenteroides and W. viridescens in artificially inoculated 
VPM samples under isothermal storage (5, 8, 13 and 18 °C). Primally, both the 
qPCR and the PC methods were compared, and a linear regression analysis 
demonstrated a statistically significant linear correlation between the methods. 
Secondly, the Baranyi and Roberts model was fitted to the growth curve data to 
estimate the kinetic parameters of L. mesenteroides and W. viridescens under 
isothermal conditions, and secondary models were used to establish the 
dependence of the maximum specific growth rate on the temperature. The results 
proved that primary and secondary models were adequate for describing the growth 
curves of both methods in relation to both bacteria. In conclusion, the results 
of all the experiments proved that the qPCR method in combination with the PC 
method can be used to construct microbial growth kinetics and that primary and 
secondary mathematical modeling can be successfully applied to describe the 
growth of L. mesenteroides and W. viridescens in vacuum-packaged morcilla and, 
by extension, other cooked meat products with similar characteristics.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF) have a tremendous impact 
worldwide, markedly reducing life-expectancy and quality of life. It is now 
known that each disease represents a risk factor for the other. Moreover, when 
they are combined, the prognosis is significantly worse. Until recently, these 
pathologies have been managed independently. However, their treatment paradigm 
is rapidly changing, with recent cardiovascular outcome trials showing that 
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) are effective in the 
management of both diseases. This article explores the interactions between T2DM 
and HF and the concept of diabetic cardiomyopathy and summarizes recent data 
regarding the effects of SGLT-2i on HF hospitalization and the proposed 
pathophysiological mechanisms involved.

PURPOSE: In recent decades, the life expectancy of HIV-infected patients has 
increased considerably, to the extent that the disease can now be considered 
chronic. In this context of progressive aging, HIV-infected persons have a 
greater prevalence of comorbid conditions. Consequently, they usually take more 
non-antiretroviral drugs, and their drug therapy are more complex. This supposes 
a greater risk of drug interactions, of hospitalization, falls, and death. In 
the last years, deprescribing has gained attention as a means to rationalize 
medication use.
METHODS: Review of the different therapeutic approach that includes optimization 
of polypharmacy and control and reduction of potentially inappropriate 
prescription.
RESULTS: There are several protocols for systematizing the deprescribing 
process. The most widely used tool is the Medication Regimen Complexity Index, 
an index validated in HIV-infected persons. Anticholinergic medications are the 
agents that have been most associated with major adverse effects so, various 
scales have been employed to measure it. Other tools should be employed to 
detect and prevent the use of potentially inappropriate drugs. Prioritization of 
candidates should be based, among others, on drugs that should always be avoided 
and drugs with no justified indication.
CONCLUSIONS: The deprescribing process shared by professionals and patients 
definitively would improve management of treatment in this population. Because 
polypharmacy in HIV-infected patients show that a considerable percentage of 
patients could be candidates for deprescribing, we must understand the 
importance of deprescribing and that HIV-infected persons should be a priority 
group. This process would be highly feasible and effective in HIV-infected 
persons.

BACKGROUND: In association with the rapid lengthening of life expectancy and the 
ever-rising prevalence of obesity, many studies explored in the elderly the 
phenomenon usually defined as the obesity paradox.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This article is a narrative overview of seventy-two 
papers (1999-2019) that investigated the obesity paradox during the aging 
process. Twenty-nine documents are examined more in detail.
RESULTS: The majority of studies suggesting the existence of an obesity paradox 
have evaluated just BMI as an index of obesity. Some aspects are often not 
assessed or are underestimated, in particular body composition and visceral 
adiposity, sarcopenic obesity, and cardio fitness. Many studies support that 
central fat and relative loss of fat-free mass may become relatively more 
important than BMI in determining the health risk associated with obesity in 
older ages.
CONCLUSION: Inaccurate assessments may lead to a systematic underestimation of 
the impact of obesity on morbidity and premature mortality and, consequently, to 
clinical behaviors that are not respectful of the health of elderly patients. 
Knowledge of the changes in body composition and fat distribution will help to 
better understand the relationship between obesity, morbidity, and mortality in 
the elderly.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V, narrative overview.

The CSPPT (China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial) demonstrated a significant 
risk reduction of first stroke in hypertensive patients treated with enalapril 
plus folic acid compared with those with enalapril alone, but the lifetime 
stroke-free survival associated with the treatment is unknown. By establishing 
adjusted models for competing risks and an age-based time scale using data from 
19 053 participants of the CSPPT, we estimated lifetime incremental stroke-free 
survival for enalapril-folic acid versus enalapril alone. Compared with 
enalapril alone, the enalapril plus folic acid treatment projected a mean 
lifetime stroke-free survival gain of 1.75 months, with an interquartile range 
from 0.73 to 2.39 months and the maximum gain up to 12.95 months. Subgroup 
analyses showed greater gain in stroke-free survival in younger, male patients, 
those with lower baseline folate levels, higher baseline systolic blood 
pressure, higher baseline total cholesterol and blood glucose, and with MTHFR 
(methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) C677T CT or TT genotype. Overall, besides 
significant benefit in certain subgroups, enalapril plus folic acid treatment 
for hypertensive patients is associated with a modest gain in lifetime 
stroke-free survival, compared with enalapril alone.

Exercise is a key intervention for improving older adults' physical function and 
life expectancy. Here, we investigated a short-term intervention program 
designed to improve the physical functioning of elderly adults in a 
community-dwelling setting. We examined the effect of a 5-week combined exercise 
and education program on the physical function, social engagement, mobility 
performance, and fear of falling in 42 subjects older than 65 years. Eleven 
subjects dropped out. There was significant improvement in the 30-second chair 
stand test (p < .001) and timed up-and-go test (p < .001) between the baseline 
and the last session. At the end of the intervention, the subjects' social 
engagement was significantly higher than at baseline (p = .022), but this 
improvement was not maintained in the follow-up assessment. These results 
suggest that a combined exercise and education program can improve the physical 
function and social engagement of elderly individuals living in a community 
dwelling.

Control of rheumatoid arthritis with conventional disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs in a tertiary hospital in central South Africa.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a highly prevalent disease with a 
significant impact on morbidity and life expectancy. There is a paucity of 
literature relating to the current state of disease control in South Africa, and 
none on Free State Province.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate control of RA with conventional disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the rheumatology outpatient department of 
Universitas Academic Hospital, Bloemfontein, and to determine the relative 
impact of various factors contributing to the prevention of disease control.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken over a period of 8 months from 
December 2016 to August 2017 in the rheumatology outpatient department of 
Universitas Academic Hospital. Data were collected by means of information 
sheets and questionnaires completed by attending doctors. The information 
pertained to disease activity, possible factors contributing to poor control, 
and relevant demographic data.
RESULTS: Information was collected from 169 patients, and data analysis was 
performed on 161. The results revealed that RA was controlled in 34 patients 
(21.1%). Of the 127 patients with uncontrolled disease, 61 (48.0%) reported 
dispensing issues relating to poor drug availability. Seventy-two (56.7%) of the 
patients with uncontrolled disease were deemed to be on insufficient treatment 
for their disease state, of whom 33 (45.8%) also reported concomitant dispensing 
issues. Other factors such as transport/access problems, administrative issues, 
adverse events and poor compliance/insight contributed to the inadequate control 
of RA to a minor extent. In terms of monthly dispensing, 159 patients (98.8%) 
reported receiving all their DMARDs during the first month. The vast majority of 
these drugs were dispensed from Universitas Hospital. This figure decreased to 
119 patients (73.9%) who received all their DMARDs during the second month, 
mostly from district units. Only 55.3% (n=89) of the patients reported receiving 
all of their DMARDs from their down-referral units.
CONCLUSIONS: Control of RA at this institution is suboptimal compared with 
national and international standards. The main contributors to poor control 
appear to be problems relating to dispensing of medication and inadequate 
escalation of therapy by doctors. Most of the concern with the dispensing of 
medication lies with the poor availability of DMARDs in peripheral unit 
pharmacies. These factors are remediable and should be attended to.

OBJECTIVE: To be fit-for-purpose, oral health-related quality of life 
instruments must possess a range of psychometric properties which had not been 
fully examined in the 16-item Short Form Child Perceptions Questionnaire for 
children aged 11 to 14 years (CPQ11-14 ISF-16). We used advanced statistical 
approaches to determine the CPQ's measurement accuracy, precision, invariance 
and dimensionality and analyzed whether age range could be extended from 8 to 15 
years.
METHODS: Fit to the Rasch model was examined in 6648 8-to-15-year-olds from 
Australia, New Zealand, Brunei, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, 
Germany, United Kingdom, Brazil and Mexico.
RESULTS: In all but two items, the initial five answer options were reduced to 
three or four, to increase precision of the children's selection. Items 10 
(Shy/embarrassed) and 11 (Concerned what others think) showed an 'extra' 
dependency between item scores beyond the relationship related to the underlying 
latent construct represented by the instrument, and so were deleted. Without 
these two items, the CPQ was unidimensional. The three oral symptoms items (4 
Food stuck in teeth, 3 Bad breath and 1 Pain) were required for a sufficient 
person-item coverage. In three out of 14 items (21 %), Europe and South America 
showed regional differences in the patterns of how the answer options were 
selected. No differential item functioning was detected for age.
CONCLUSION: Except for a few modifications, the present analysis supports the 
combination of items, the cross-cultural validity of the CPQ with 14 items and 
the extension of the age range from 8 to 15 years.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The valid, reliable, shortened and age-extended version 
of the CPQ resulting from this study should be used in routine care and clinical 
research. Less items and a wider age range increase its usability. Symptoms 
items are needed to precisely differentiate between children with higher and 
lower quality of life.

The ethics of perinatal care, and the experiences of families who receive such 
care, remains a nascent area of inquiry. It can be hard to see how existing 
"good death" constructs apply to the experiences of fetal patients and their 
families. In this paper, we explore two themes raised by a case at our fetal 
health center: anticipation and accompaniment. In this case, a mother presented 
to our fetal health center; her unborn son, our fetal patient, was diagnosed 
with life-threatening hypoplastic left heart syndrome and endocardial 
fibroelastosis. The parents were told that their son's life expectancy, upon 
birth, was short. For us, this case raised important questions around what sorts 
of things we might, together with the family, anticipate with respect to their 
son's birth and death, and what it meant to really accompany this family on 
their journey. Alongside conventional lessons in the philosophical literature 
and palliative care practice, the process of anticipating together and of mutual 
accompaniment helped us to guide this family to what they ultimately determined 
to be a good death for their son.
