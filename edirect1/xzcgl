INTRODUCTION: The Quality-Adjusted Time Without Symptoms or Toxicity (Q-TWiST) 
has been used to evaluate the clinical benefits and risks of oncology 
treatments. However, limited information is available to interpret and 
contextualize Q-TWiST results.
AREAS COVERED: A systematic review of Q-TWiST literature was conducted to 
provide contextualizing benchmarks for future studies. 51 articles with 81 
unique Q-TWiST comparisons were identified. The mean (95% CI) and median 
absolute Q-TWiST gains for treatment versus control arms were 2.78 (1.82-3.73) 
months and 2.20 months across all cancers, respectively. The mean (median) 
relative Q-TWiST gains were 7.8% (7.2%) across all cancers. Most (88%) studies 
reported positive gains. The percentage of studies with relative Q-TWiST gains 
≥10% (ie, clinically important difference) and ≥15% (ie, clearly clinically 
important difference) were 40.0% and 22.7%, respectively
EXPERT COMMENTARY: The relevance of Q-TWiST in assessing net clinical benefits 
of cancer therapy has not diminished, despite an arguably low number of 
published studies. The interest in such assessment is highlighted by the recent 
emergence of oncology value frameworks. The Q-TWiST should be compelling to 
clinicians as it integrates clinical information (ie, toxicity, 
relapse/progression, and survival) and patient preferences for each of these 
states into a single meaningful index.

BACKGROUND: Prevalence of malnutrition in older hospitalized patients is 30%. 
Malnutrition is associated with poor clinical outcomes in terms of high 
morbidity and mortality and is costly for hospitals. Extended nutrition 
interventions improve clinical outcomes but limited studies have investigated 
whether these interventions are cost-effective.
METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 148 malnourished general medical 
patients ≥60 years were recruited and randomized to receive either an extended 
nutritional intervention or usual care. Nutrition intervention was 
individualized and started with 24 h of admission and was continued for 3 months 
post-discharge with a monthly telephone call whereas control patients received 
usual care. Nutrition status was confirmed by Patient generated subjective 
global assessment (PG-SGA) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was 
measured using EuroQoL 5D (EQ-5D-5 L) questionnaire at admission and at 3-months 
follow-up. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted for the primary outcome 
(incremental costs per unit improvement in PG-SGA) while a cost-utility analysis 
(CUA) was undertaken for the secondary outcome (incremental costs per quality 
adjusted life year (QALY) gained).
RESULTS: Nutrition status and HRQoL improved in intervention patients. Mean per 
included patient Australian Medicare costs were lower in intervention group 
compared to control arm (by $907) but these differences were not statistically 
significant (95% CI: -$2956 to $4854). The main drivers of higher costs in the 
control group were higher inpatient ($13,882 versus $13,134) and drug ($838 
versus $601) costs. After adjusting outcomes for baseline differences and 
repeated measures, the intervention was more effective than the control with 
patients in this arm reporting QALYs gained that were higher by 0.0050 QALYs 
gained per patient (95% CI: -0.0079 to 0.0199). The probability of the 
intervention being cost-effective at willingness to pay values as low as $1000 
per unit improvement in PG-SGA was > 98% while it was 78% at a willingness to 
pay $50,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: This health economic analysis suggests that the use of extended 
nutritional intervention in older general medical patients is likely to be 
cost-effective in the Australian health care setting in terms of both primary 
and secondary outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Surgeries performed for metastatic spinal tumor are mostly 
palliative and are controversial for patients with short life expectancy. We 
investigated whether palliative posterior spinal stabilization surgery with 
postoperative multidisciplinary therapy results in improvement of life prognosis 
and activities of daily living (ADL) in patients with metastatic spinal tumor.
METHODS: The subjects were 55 patients who underwent palliative posterior-only 
instrumentation surgery for metastatic spinal tumor at our hospital between 2012 
and 2015. Postoperative survival, early paralysis improvement, ADL improvement, 
and rate of discharge to home were examined.
RESULTS: The patients included 37 males and 18 females, and the mean age at the 
time of surgery was 66.8 years old. The mean Tokuhashi score was 7.1, the mean 
spinal instability neoplastic score (SINS) was 9.4, and the epidural spinal cord 
compression scale (ESCCS) was grade 3 in 20 patients (36.3%). The mean Barthel 
index for ADL was 48.7. The median postoperative survival time determined using 
the Kaplan-Meier method was 12.0 months (95% confidence interval 2.4-21.5). 
Regarding improvement of paralysis, the modified Frankel scale was improved by 
one grade or more or grade E was maintained in 35 patients (63.6%), whereas 
paralysis aggravated in 2 (3.6%). In surgery, conventional posterior 
decompression and fixation were applied in 31 patients (56.3%), and minimally 
invasive spine stabilization was applied in 24 (43.6%). Postoperative 
chemotherapy was performed in 31 patients (56.3%), radiotherapy was used in 38 
(69.0%), and a bone-modifying agent was administered in 39 (70.2%). Regarding 
ADL, the mean Barthel index improved from 48.5 before surgery to 74.5 after 
surgery. Thirty-seven patients (67.2%) were discharged to home.
CONCLUSIONS: ADL improved and allowed discharge to home, and postoperative 
adjuvant therapy could be administered at a high rate in patients who received 
palliative posterior spinal stabilization surgery. Survival time extended beyond 
the preoperative life expectancy in many patients. Patients with a metastatic 
spinal tumor have short life expectancy and paralysis caused by spinal 
instability and spinal cord compression. However, multidisciplinary therapy 
including palliative posterior spinal stabilization surgery with reduced 
invasiveness and postoperative adjuvant therapy are effective in these patients.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer diagnosis and staging can be difficult in 10-20% 
of patients. Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) adds 
precise anatomical localisation to functional data. The use of PET/CT may add 
further value to the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the incremental diagnostic accuracy and impact of PET/CT 
in addition to standard diagnostic work-up in patients with suspected pancreatic 
cancer.
DESIGN: A multicentre prospective diagnostic accuracy and clinical value study 
of PET/CT in suspected pancreatic malignancy.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with suspected pancreatic malignancy.
INTERVENTIONS: All patients to undergo PET/CT following standard diagnostic 
work-up.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incremental diagnostic value 
of PET/CT in addition to standard diagnostic work-up with multidetector computed 
tomography (MDCT). Secondary outcomes were (1) changes in patients' diagnosis, 
staging and management as a result of PET/CT; (2) changes in the costs and 
effectiveness of patient management as a result of PET/CT; (3) the incremental 
diagnostic value of PET/CT in chronic pancreatitis; (4) the identification of 
groups of patients who would benefit most from PET/CT; and (5) the incremental 
diagnostic value of PET/CT in other pancreatic tumours.
RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2013, 589 patients with suspected pancreatic cancer 
underwent MDCT and PET/CT, with 550 patients having complete data and in-range 
PET/CT. Sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer were 
88.5% and 70.6%, respectively, for MDCT and 92.7% and 75.8%, respectively, for 
PET/CT. The maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax.) for a pancreatic cancer 
diagnosis was 7.5. PET/CT demonstrated a significant improvement in relative 
sensitivity (p = 0.01) and specificity (p = 0.023) compared with MDCT. 
Incremental likelihood ratios demonstrated that PET/CT significantly improved 
diagnostic accuracy in all scenarios (p < 0.0002). PET/CT correctly changed the 
staging of pancreatic cancer in 56 patients (p = 0.001). PET/CT influenced 
management in 250 (45%) patients. PET/CT stopped resection in 58 (20%) patients 
who were due to have surgery. The benefit of PET/CT was limited in patients with 
chronic pancreatitis or other pancreatic tumours. PET/CT was associated with a 
gain in quality-adjusted life-years of 0.0157 (95% confidence interval -0.0101 
to 0.0430). In the base-case model PET/CT was seen to dominate MDCT alone and is 
thus highly likely to be cost-effective for the UK NHS. PET/CT was seen to be 
most cost-effective for the subgroup of patients with suspected pancreatic 
cancer who were thought to be resectable.
CONCLUSION: PET/CT provided a significant incremental diagnostic benefit in the 
diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and significantly influenced the staging and 
management of patients. PET/CT had limited utility in chronic pancreatitis and 
other pancreatic tumours. PET/CT is likely to be cost-effective at current 
reimbursement rates for PET/CT to the UK NHS. This was not a randomised 
controlled trial and therefore we do not have any information from patients who 
would have undergone MDCT only for comparison. In addition, there were issues in 
estimating costs for PET/CT. Future work should evaluate the role of PET/CT in 
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and prognosis and response to therapy in 
patients with pancreatic cancer.

BACKGROUND: The benefit of early integration of palliative care into oncological 
care is suggested to be due to increased psychosocial support. In Belgium, 
psychosocial care is part of standard oncological care. The aim of this 
randomised controlled trial is to examine whether early and systematic 
integration of palliative care alongside standard psychosocial oncological care 
provides added benefit compared with usual care.
METHODS: In this randomised controlled trial, eligible patients were 18 years or 
older, and had advanced cancer due to a solid tumour, an European Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, an estimated life expectancy of 12 
months, and were within the first 12 weeks of a new primary tumour or had a 
diagnosis of progression. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), by block design 
using a computer-generated sequence, either to early and systematic integration 
of palliative care into oncological care, or standard oncological care alone in 
a setting where all patients are offered multidisciplinary oncology care by 
medical specialists, psychologists, social workers, dieticians, and specialist 
nurses. The primary endpoint was change in global health status/quality of life 
scale assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items (EORTC QLQ C30) at 12 weeks. The 
McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL), which includes the additional 
existential wellbeing dimension, was also used. Analysis was by intention to 
treat. This trial is ongoing, but closed for accrual, and is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01865396.
FINDINGS: From April 29, 2013, to Feb 29, 2016, we screened 468 patients for 
eligibility, of whom 186 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the early and 
systematic palliative care group (92 patients) or the standard oncological care 
group (94). Compliance at 12 weeks was 71% (65 patients) in the intervention 
group versus 72% (68) in the control group. The overall quality of life score at 
12 weeks, by the EORTC QLQ C30, was 54·39 (95% CI 49·23-59·56) in the standard 
oncological care group versus 61·98 (57·02-66·95) in the early and systematic 
palliative care group (difference 7·60 [95% CI 0·59-14·60]; p=0·03); and by the 
MQOL Single Item Scale, 5·94 (95% CI 5·50-6·39) in the standard oncological care 
group versus 7·05 (6·59-7·50) in the early and systematic palliative care group 
(difference 1·11 [95% CI 0·49-1·73]; p=0.0006).
INTERPRETATION: The findings of this study show that a model of early and 
systematic integration of palliative care in oncological care increases the 
quality of life of patients with advanced cancer. Our findings also show that 
early and systematic integration of palliative care is more beneficial for 
patients with advanced cancer than palliative care consultations offered on 
demand, even when psychosocial support has already been offered. Through 
integration of care, oncologists and specialised palliative care teams should 
work together to enhance the quality of life of patients with advanced cancer.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a soluble receptor of the 
pro-apoptotic cytokine TRAIL which is thought to contribute to tumour 
development by inhibiting apoptosis or affecting other aspects of tumour 
biology, including cell proliferation and immune response. Although 
immunohistochemical studies suggest that OPG correlates with survival in 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), only scarce data are available on serum OPG 
in CRC patients.
METHODS: In this pilot study, we assessed the prognostic significance of serum 
OPG and CEA (Carcinoembryonic antigen) in 81 patients with UICC (Union for 
International Cancer Control) stage-IV mCRC. OPG was additionally assessed by 
immunohistochemistry in primary tissue samples from 33 patients of the same 
cohort.
RESULTS: Baseline serum OPG correlated with CEA (r=0.36, p=0.0011), but 
independently predicted survival of mCRC patients. Life expectancy was poorer in 
patients with OPG levels above the median concentration of 51ng/ml (median 
overall survival [95% confidence interval] 1.8 years [1.3-3.0] vs. 1.0 [0.7-1.2] 
p=0.013). Patients with high levels of both OPG and CEA had an even poorer life 
expectancy vs. low-OPG/low-CEA patients (0.9 years [0.6-1.5] vs. 3 years 
[1.2-4.4], p=0.015), indicating that CEA and OPG have additive prognostic 
significance. Immunohistochemical analysis of OPG failed to show a correlation 
between OPG staining and survival (p=0.055) or OPG concentration from matched 
serum samples.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study provides evidence of independent prognostic 
significance of serum OPG in patients with advanced mCRC and warrants its 
further prospective validation.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common cause of valvular heart disease with heavy 
disease burden in elderly patients. It is present in almost 7% of patients older 
than 65. The mortality rate increases significantly once it becomes symptomatic 
with average life expectancy of around 1-year. Symptoms include angina, syncope, 
or heart failure. This requires either surgical or transcutaneous replacement. 
Transcutaneous aortic valve replacement (TAVR) use has increased in recent years 
from high risk patients to now even including intermediate risk patients. With 
the increased number of procedures performed, one of the consequences is access 
site complications. These complications can lead to increased hospitalization, 
cost, infections, and eventually worse outcomes. In this manuscript, we provide 
a comprehensive review discussing the consequences, outcomes, frequency, 
predictors and some possible solutions to these complications set forth in these 
studies.

IMPORTANCE: Life expectancy is greatly shortened in patients presenting with 
myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the most common neuromuscular disease. A 
reliable prediction of survival in patients with DM1 is critically important to 
plan personalized health supervision.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a prognostic score to predict 10-year 
survival in patients with DM1.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this longitudinal cohort study, between 
January 2000 and November 2014, we enrolled 1296 adults referred to 4 tertiary 
neuromuscular centers in France for management of genetically proven DM1, 
including 1066 patients in the derivation cohort and 230 in the validation 
cohort. Data were analyzed from December 2016 to March 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Factors associated with survival by multiple 
variable Cox modeling, including 95% confidence intervals, and development of a 
predictive score validated internally and externally. Mean values are reported 
with their standard deviations.
RESULTS: Of the 1296 included patients, 670 (51.7%) were women, and the mean 
(SD) age was 39.8 (13.7) years. Among the 1066 patients (82.3%) in the 
derivation cohort, 241 (22.6%) died over a median (interquartile range) 
follow-up of 11.7 (7.7-14.3) years. Age, diabetes, need for support when 
walking, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, first-degree atrioventricular 
block, bundle-branch block, and lung vital capacity were associated with death. 
Simplified score points were attributed to each predictor, and adding these 
points yielded scores between 0 and 20, with 0 indicating the lowest and 20 the 
highest risk of death. The 10-year survival rate was 96.6% (95% CI, 94.4-98.9) 
in the group with 0 to 4 points, 92.2% (95% CI, 88.8-95.6) in the group with 5 
to 7 points, 80.7% (95% CI, 75.4-86.1) in the group with 8 to 10 points, 57.9% 
(95% CI, 49.2-66.6) in the group with 11 to 13 points, and 19.4% (95% CI, 
8.6-30.1) in the group with 14 points or more. In 230 patients (17.7%) included 
in the validation cohort, the 10-year survival rates for the groups with 0 to 4, 
5 to 7, 8 to 10, 11 to 13, and 14 points or more were 99.3% (95% CI, 95.0-100), 
80.6% (95% CI, 67.1-96.7), 79.3% (95% CI, 66.2-95.1), 43.2% (95% CI, 28.2-66.1), 
and 21.6% (95% CI, 10.0-46.8), respectively. The calibration curves did not 
deviate from the reference line. The C index was 0.753 (95% CI, 0.722-0.785) in 
the derivation cohort and 0.806 (95% CI, 0.758-0.855) in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The DM1 prognostic score is associated with long-term 
survival.

Essential tremor (ET) is currently classified as a syndrome rather than a unique 
disease, primarily involving monosymptomatic action tremor in both hands. 
Different etiologies are presumed to underlie this condition. Currently only 
a few monogenetic conditions are known to present with this syndrome. If 
accompanied by additional symptoms that do not in themselves constitute a new 
syndrome, such as abnormal tandem gait or postures, the syndrome should be 
diagnosed as "ET plus". ET is associated with abnormal rhythmic activation of 
the cerebello-thalamo-cortical tremor circuit. Despite its strong heritability, 
the genetics of ET have not been elucidated as yet. Age-correlated tremor is one 
of the presumed subgroups of ET. Late onset is associated with a shortened life 
expectancy. From a treatment perspective, propranolol and primidone represent 
the drugs of first choice, followed by topiramate. Deep brain stimulation of the 
Vim nucleus of the thalamus is a proven treatment option in severely affected 
patients.

Valvular heart disease (VHD) affects a large number of patients annually. From a 
surgical standpoint, there are two primary options for valve replacement: 
mechanical or bioprosthetic. While there are clear advantages and disadvantages 
to either option, and recent literature does challenge some of the prior dictums 
of valve choice, a handful of absolutes remain true. Mechanical valves provide 
superior durability and freedom from re-operation when compared to their 
bioprosthetic counterparts, at the expense of bleeding or thrombotic 
complications associated with the need for lifelong oral anticoagulation. Unless 
a clear contraindication to oral anticoagulation exists, we recommend implanting 
mechanical valves for patients less than 60 years old and those who are older 
than 65 but maintained on anticoagulation for reasons other than their valvular 
disease. Bioprosthetic valves should be placed in patients who are greater than 
65 years old or those patients who have a postoperative life expectancy of less 
than 10 years. Valve choice in patients between the ages of 60 to 70 is not 
dictated by guidelines and is less clear, with patient preference playing a 
larger role than their age range.

The genetic code expansion strategy has become an elegant method for 
site-specific incorporation of noncanonical amino acids with diverse 
functionalities into proteins of interest in bacteria, yeast, mammalian cells, 
and even animals. This technique allows precise labeling as well as manipulation 
of a given protein to dissect its physiological and/or pathological roles under 
living conditions. Here, we demonstrate the extension of a recently emerged 
pyrrolysine-based genetic code expansion strategy for encoding noncanonical 
amino acids into enteric bacterial pathogens.

BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on the optimal fixation method for patients 
who require a surgical procedure for distal radial fractures. We used 
cost-effectiveness analyses to determine which of 3 modalities offers the best 
value: closed reduction and percutaneous pinning, open reduction and internal 
fixation, or external fixation.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model that projected short-term and long-term 
health benefits and costs in patients undergoing a surgical procedure for a 
distal radial fracture. Simulations began at the patient age of 50 years and 
were run over the patient's lifetime. The analysis was conducted from 
health-care payer and societal perspectives. We estimated transition 
probabilities and quality-of-life values from the literature and determined 
costs from Medicare reimbursement schedules in 2016 U.S. dollars. Suboptimal 
postoperative outcomes were determined by rates of reduction loss (4% for closed 
reduction and percutaneous pinning, 1% for open reduction and internal fixation, 
and 11% for external fixation) and rates of orthopaedic complications. 
Procedural costs were $7,638 for closed reduction and percutaneous pinning, 
$10,170 for open reduction and internal fixation, and $9,886 for external 
fixation. Outputs were total costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
discounted at 3% per year. We considered willingness-to-pay thresholds of 
$50,000 and $100,000. We conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses to evaluate the impact of data uncertainty.
RESULTS: From the health-care payer perspective, closed reduction and 
percutaneous pinning dominated (i.e., produced greater QALYs at lower costs 
than) open reduction and internal fixation and dominated external fixation. From 
the societal perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for closed 
reduction and percutaneous pinning compared with open reduction and internal 
fixation was $21,058 per QALY and external fixation was dominated. In 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, open reduction and internal fixation was 
cost-effective roughly 50% of the time compared with roughly 45% for closed 
reduction and percutaneous pinning.
CONCLUSIONS: When considering data uncertainty, there is only a 5% to 10% 
difference in the frequency of probability combinations that find open reduction 
and internal fixation to be more cost-effective. The current degree of 
uncertainty in the data produces difficulty in distinguishing either strategy as 
being more cost-effective overall and thus it may be left to surgeon and patient 
shared decision-making.

BACKGROUND: The new kidney allocation system (KAS) intends to allocate the top 
20% of kidneys to younger recipients with longer life expectancy. We 
hypothesized that the new KAS would lead to greater allocation of Public Health 
Service (PHS) increased-risk donor organs to younger recipients.
METHODS: Analyses of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data of 
patients who underwent primary deceased kidney transplantation were performed in 
pre- and post-KAS periods.
RESULTS: The allocation of PHS increased-risk kidney allografts in various age 
groups changed significantly after implementation of the new KAS, with an 
increased proportion of younger individuals receiving increased-risk kidneys (7% 
vs 10% in age group 20-29 y and 13% vs 18% in age group 30-39 y before and after 
KAS, respectively; P < .0001). This trend was reversed in recipients 50-59 years 
old, with 31% in the pre-KAS period compared with 26% after KAS (P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The new KAS resulted in a substantial increase in allocation of PHS 
increased-risk kidneys to candidates in younger age groups. Because 
increased-risk kidneys are generally underutilized, future efforts to optimize 
the utilization of these organs should target younger recipients and their 
providers.

Ready-to-eat products have become popular with most of the busy people in modern 
cities. Heat processing combined with vacuum-packaging is one of the most common 
methods to make ready-to-eat products with an extended shelf-life. In this 
study, the influence of heat processing [80 °C (LT) and 98 °C (HT) in water 
bath] on the quality of salted and vacuum-packaged silver carp 
(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) fillets, stored at 20 ± 1 °C, was investigated by 
sensory analysis, biochemical analysis, and microbial diversity. SPME-GC/MS 
indicated the presence of 27 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in fillets, and 
major VOCs were aldehydes and alcohols. Acids tended to increase during storage 
and caused a fetid odor at the end of storage. Culture-dependent method 
indicated that Bacillus dominated the spoiled LT and HT samples. In addition, 
Bacillus was identified as the main spoiler of deteriorated heated fillets by 
high-throughput sequencing. Sphingomonas and Brevibacillus dominated the 
indigenous bacteria of fresh raw fillets. After heat processing, LT samples 
exhibited higher organoleptic quality than HT samples on day 0. HT samples 
showed extended shelf-life at 20 °C storage compared to LT samples.

OBJECTIVES: Studies in several countries have demonstrated the 
cost-effectiveness of population-based screening for glaucoma when targeted at 
high-risk groups such as older adults and with familial history of disease. This 
study conducts a cost-effective analysis of a hypothetical community screening 
and subsequent treatment programme in comparison to opportunistic case finding 
for glaucoma in rural India.
STUDY DESIGN: A hypothetical screening programme for both primary open-angle 
glaucoma and angle-closure disease was built for a population aged between 40 
and 69 years in rural areas of India.
METHODS: A decision analytical model was built to model events, costs and 
treatment pathways with and without a hypothetical screening programme for 
glaucoma for a rural-based population aged between 40 and 69 years in India. The 
treatment pathway included both primary open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure 
disease. The data on costs of screening and treatment were provided by an 
administrator of a tertiary eye hospital in Eastern India. The probabilities for 
the screening and treatment pathway were derived from published literature and a 
glaucoma specialist. The glaucoma prevalence rates were adapted from the Chennai 
Glaucoma Study findings.
RESULTS: An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio value of ₹7292.30 per 
quality-adjusted life-year was calculated for a community-screening programme 
for glaucoma in rural India. The community screening for glaucoma would treat an 
additional 2872 cases and prevent 2190 person-years of blindness over a 10-year 
period.
CONCLUSIONS: Community screening for glaucoma in rural India appears to be 
cost-effective when judged by a ratio of willingness-to-pay thresholds as per 
WHO-CHOICE guidelines. For community screening to be cost-effective, adequate 
resources, such as trained medical personnel and equipment would need to be made 
available.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) elevates the 
cholesterol level and increases the risk of coronary events and death. Early 
detection and treatment reduce this risk. We aimed to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of FH screening in Poland in children, first job takers, and 
after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event, each followed by a cascade 
screening in the relatives of the positively-diagnosed subjects.
METHODS: A decision tree was constructed to model the diagnosis process. We 
considered scenarios with and without genetic testing. A life-time Markov was 
built to investigate the effectiveness (life years gained, LYG; and 
quality-adjusted life years, QALY) and cost (public payer perspective) of 
treatment in FH-affected subjects. The clinical benefits result from early 
treatment reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (and death, in result). 
Model parameters were based on published data and experts' opinions. The costs 
(patients visits, tests, drugs) were estimated from the National Health Fund 
data and other publicly-available sources.
RESULTS: Screening ACS patients below 55/65 years of age in men/women is the 
most cost-effective strategy: the cost of one LYG (QALY) amounts to 100 EUR (110 
EUR). Removing the age limit or using genetic tests reduced cost-effectiveness; 
nonetheless, all strategies remained cost effective: the cost of one LYG or QALY 
was <5040 EUR, much lower than the official threshold of ca. 29,800 EUR/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening for FH is highly cost-effective in Poland. The strategies 
are complementary, and using a combination thereof is recommended.

OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic cancer has a lower morbidity yet higher case fatality 
rates (CFRs) compared with other gastrointestinal cancers. The effects of 
socio-economic components on pancreatic cancer rates have been acknowledged; 
however, the effects of the Human Development Index (HDI) inequality are not. In 
this study, we aimed to determine the contribution of important socio-economic 
components on pancreatic cancer rates using a decomposition approach.
STUDY DESIGN: Global ecological study.
METHODS: Incidence and mortality rates of pancreatic cancer were obtained for 
172 countries from GLOBOCAN and the United Nations Development Program. The 
World Bank database was also used to obtain the HDI and its gradient for 169 
countries. Inequality in pancreatic cancer age-specific incidence and mortality 
rates was calculated according to the HDI using the concentration index (CI). We 
decomposed the CI to determine main contributors of the inequality.
RESULTS: The CI for incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer in both genders 
according to the HDI was 0.26 (95% confidence interval: 0.21-0.30) and 0.25 (95% 
confidence interval: 0.21-0.30), respectively, which indicated more concentrated 
inequality in advantaged countries. About 80% of the inequality sources were 
predicted by socio-economic component in both rates of pancreatic cancer. The 
main contributors to inequality were the mean years of schooling, life 
expectancy at birth, expected years of schooling, and urbanization.
CONCLUSION: Global inequalities exist in pancreatic cancer incidence and 
mortality rates according to the HDI; in addition, inequality was more 
concentrated in countries with higher score of HDI.

OBJECTIVE: Hospice is a favored setting for dignity care. Studies on dignity 
dimension in end-of-life patients are growing. The Patient Dignity Inventory 
(PDI) is a tool that can lead to interesting information on dignity-related 
aspects of suffering. The study aimed to investigate dignity among end-of-life 
cancer patients, by examining the Italian version of the PDI factor structure 
and assessing the relationship between dignity and other patients' psychosocial 
and spiritual variables to improve a patient-centered clinical practice.
METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study. Data were collected using a battery of 
self-administered validated rating scales. The sample included 127 hospice 
patients with a life expectancy of a few weeks and a Karnofsky Performance 
Status ≤40. Factor structure and concurrent validity of PDI and correlations 
between dignity and anxious and depressive symptomatology, quality of life, 
demoralization, personal coping styles, spiritual well-being, and spiritual 
daily experience were analyzed.ResultFactor analysis highlighted a five-factor 
solution, accounting for 60% of the overall variance. The factors were labeled 
Psychological Distress, Social Support, Physical Symptoms and Dependency, 
Existential Distress, and Loss of Purpose/Meaning. Dignity assessment evidenced 
that self-blame coping style, emotional and physical well-being, and depression 
were the loss of dignity significant predictors (R2 = 0.605; p &lt; 
0.01).Significance of resultsThe results point out the intercultural validity of
