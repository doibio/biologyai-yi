Sex differences are an important consideration when researching and establishing 
policies for nutrition and optimal health. For women's health, there are 
important physiologic, neurologic, and hormonal distinctions throughout the 
lifecycle that impact nutritional needs. Distinct from those for men, these 
nutritional needs must be translated into appropriate nutrition policy that aims 
to not only avoid overt nutritional deficiency, but also to promote health and 
minimize risk for chronic disease. Through a series of webinars, scientific 
experts discussed the advances in the understanding of the unique nutritional 
needs, challenges and opportunities of the various life stages for women across 
the life course and identified emerging nutritional interventions that may be 
beneficial for women. Nevertheless, there is concern that existing nutrition 
policy intended for women's health is falling short with examples of programs 
that are focused more on delivering calories than achieving optimal nutrition. 
To be locally effective, targeted nutrition needs to offer different proposals 
for different cultural, socio-economic, and geographic communities, and needs to 
be applicable at all stages of growth and development. There must be adequate 
access to nutritious foods, and the information to understand and implement 
proven nutritional opportunities. Experts provided recommendations for 
improvement of current entitlement programs that will address accessibility and 
other social and environmental issues to support women properly throughout the 
lifecycle.

IMPORTANCE: It has been suggested that Mohs surgery for skin cancer among 
individuals with limited life expectancy may be associated with needless risk 
and discomfort, along with increased health care costs.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate patient- and tumor-specific indications considered by 
clinicians for treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer in older individuals.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, prospective cohort study 
was conducted using data from US private practice and academic centers. Included 
patients were those older than age 85 years presenting for skin cancer surgery 
and referred for Mohs surgery, with reference groups of those younger than age 
85 years receiving Mohs surgery and those older than age 85 years not receiving 
Mohs surgery. Data were analyzed from November 2018 through January 2019.
EXPOSURES: Mohs surgery for nonmelanoma skin cancer.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reason for treatment selection.
RESULTS: Among 1181 patients older than age 85 years referred for Mohs surgery 
(724 [61.9%] men among 1169 patients with sex data; 681 individuals aged >85 to 
88 years [57.9%] among 1176 patients with age data) treated at 22 sites, 1078 
patients (91.3%) were treated by Mohs surgery, and 103 patients (8.7%) received 
alternate treatment. Patients receiving Mohs surgery were more likely to have 
tumors on the face (738 patients [68.5%] vs 26 patients [25.2%]; P < .001) and 
nearly 4-fold more likely to have high functional status (614 patients [57.0%] 
vs 16 patients [15.5%]; P < .001). Of 15 distinct reasons provided by surgeons 
for opting to proceed with Mohs surgery, the most common were patient desire for 
treatment with a high cure rate (712 patients [66.0%]), good or excellent 
patient functional status for age (614 patients [57.0%]), and high risk 
associated with the tumor based on histology (433 patients [40.2%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that older patients who received 
Mohs surgery often had high functional status, high-risk tumors, and tumors 
located on the face. These findings suggest that timely surgical treatment may 
be appropriate in older patients given that their tumors may be aggressive, 
painful, disfiguring, and anxiety provoking.

BACKGROUND: Target-D, a new person-centred e-health platform matching depression 
care to symptom severity prognosis (minimal/mild, moderate or severe) has 
demonstrated greater improvement in depressive symptoms than usual care plus 
attention control. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of Target-D compared to usual care from a health sector and partial societal 
perspective across 3-month and 12-month follow-up.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted alongside the 
Target-D randomised controlled trial; which involved 1,868 participants 
attending 14 general practices in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Data on 
costs were collected using a resource use questionnaire administered 
concurrently with all other outcome measures at baseline, 3-month and 12-month 
follow-up. Intervention costs were assessed using financial records compiled 
during the trial. All costs were expressed in Australian dollars (A$) for the 
2018-19 financial year. QALY outcomes were derived using the Assessment of 
Quality of Life-8D (AQoL-8D) questionnaire. On a per person basis, the Target-D 
intervention cost between $14 (minimal/mild prognostic group) and $676 (severe 
group). Health sector and societal costs were not significantly different 
between trial arms at both 3 and 12 months. Relative to a A$50,000 per QALY 
willingness-to-pay threshold, the probability of Target-D being cost-effective 
under a health sector perspective was 81% at 3 months and 96% at 12 months. From 
a societal perspective, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 30% at 3 
months and 80% at 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Target-D is likely to represent good value for money for health 
care decision makers. Further evaluation of QALY outcomes should accompany any 
routine roll-out to assess comparability of results to those observed in the 
trial. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials 
Registry (ACTRN12616000537459).

Cerebro-Cardiovascular Diseases (PEC2), University Hospital of Dijon, University 
of Burgundy, Dijon, France.

Accurate knowledge of epidemiological features is crucial to facilitate 
healthcare planning, prevention, and management of stroke. This article aims to 
provide an overview of the major advances in descriptive epidemiology of stroke 
over the past forty years, from the pioneering studies to the development of 
quality criteria for the conduct of population-based incidence registries, and 
the implementation of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
(GBD) study. Several current challenges are highlighted, including the 
demographic transition and aging of the population, which are dramatically 
increasing the number of stroke patients each year and the global burden of the 
disease worldwide, thus calling for additional efforts and new paradigms to 
improve prevention and reduce this demographical impact.

INTRODUCTION: In the context of family planning and reproductive health, a 
gender-transformative approach involves helping communities understand and 
challenge the social norms that perpetuate inequalities between men and women, 
and improving women's access to key services.The purpose of this systematic 
review is to synthesise the best available evidence on economic evaluations of 
gender transformative interventions targeted at preventing unintended pregnancy 
and promoting sexual health in adolescents, assess the methodological quality of 
the economic evaluation studies and identify gaps in the evidence.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search the following bibliographic databases for 
economic evaluations that meet our selection criteria; PubMed, Cochrane, 
National Health Service EE database, SCOPUS, CINHAL, Web of Science and 
Paediatric EE Database. We will additionally conduct a grey literature search. 
The search will be conducted for the period 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2021. 
Two independent reviewers will conduct the screening, data extraction and 
quality assessment. We will consider the following outcomes from economic 
evaluations; relative resource use, cost and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio, incremental net benefit ratio or net present value, quality-adjusted 
life-years and disability-adjusted life-years. Quality assessment will be 
conducted using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards 
statement and the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria checklist. Results will 
be reported using summary tables and narratively. Attempts will be made to use 
the Joanna Briggs Institute three-by-three dominance ranking matrix tool to 
compare relevant cost-effectiveness studies.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required because the review 
will not use individual patient data, instead publicly available economic 
evaluation research studies will be used. However, an ethics exemption was 
obtained from the Stellenbosch University Health Research Ethics Committee, 
Reference No: X21/05/012. The results of the systematic review will be published 
in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at a relevant scientific conference.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have highlighted the large extent of inequality in 
adverse COVID-19 health outcomes. Our aim was to monitor changes in overall, and 
inequalities in, COVID-19 years of life lost to premature mortality (YLL) in 
Scotland from 2020 and 2021.
METHODS: Cause-specific COVID-19 mortality counts were derived at age group and 
area deprivation level using Scottish death registrations for 2020 and 2021. YLL 
was estimated by multiplying mortality counts by age-conditional life expectancy 
from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 reference life table. Various measures of 
absolute and relative inequality were estimated for triangulation purposes.
RESULTS: There were marked inequalities in COVID-19 YLL by area deprivation in 
2020, which were further exacerbated in 2021; confirmed across all measures of 
absolute and relative inequality. Half (51%) of COVID-19 YLL was attributable to 
inequalities in area deprivation in 2021, an increase from 41% in 2020.
CONCLUSION: Despite a highly impactful vaccination programme in preventing 
mortality, COVID-19 continues to represent a substantial area of fatal 
population health loss for which inequalities have widened. Tackling systemic 
inequalities with effective interventions is required to mitigate further unjust 
health loss in the Scottish population from COVID-19 and other causes of 
ill-health and mortality.

Ageing and genetic traits can only explain the increasing dementia incidence 
partially. Advanced healthcare services allow dementia patients to survive 
natural selection and pass their genes onto the next generation. 
Country-specific estimates of dementia incidence rates (all ages and 15-49 years 
old), Biological State Index expressing reduced natural selection (Is), ageing 
indexed by life expectancy e(65), GDP PPP and urbanization were obtained for 
analysing the global and regional correlations between reduced natural selection 
and dementia incidence with SPSS v. 27. Worldwide, Is significantly, but 
inversely, correlates with dementia incidence rates for both all ages and 
15-49 years old in bivariate correlations. These relationships remain inversely 
correlated regardless of the competing contributing effects from ageing, GDP and 
urbanization in partial correlation model. Results of multiple linear regression 
(enter) have shown that Is is the significant predictor of dementia incidence 
among all ages and 15-49 years old. Subsequently, Is was selected as the 
variable having the greatest influence on dementia incidence in stepwise 
multiple linear regression. The Is correlated with dementia incidence more 
strongly in developed population groupings. Worldwide, reduced natural selection 
may be yet another significant contributor to dementia incidence with special 
regard to developed populations.

BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been used as the 
standard of care for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Recently, 
dapagliflozin has been shown to reduce diabetic nephropathy when added to the 
standard of care.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the cost effectiveness 
of dapagliflozin added to the standard of care in diabetic nephropathy in the 
United States of America (USA).
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness 
outcomes from the Medicare/Medicaid health coverage perspective. Model inputs 
were derived from the literature. The primary outcomes were total costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to 
determine the robustness of our results. A willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000 per QALY was applied, which is based on previous studies.
RESULTS: Dapagliflozin yielded a lifetime QALY of 2.8. The discounted QALY 
associated with the standard of care was 2.6. The standard of care was the less 
costly treatment with a lifetime cost of $106,150.25 as compared with 
dapagliflozin, which costs $110,689.25. Dapagliflozin demonstrated an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $21,141.51 per additional QALY. The most 
influential parameters of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were the 
adverse drug reaction-related cost of the standard of care and dapagliflozin, 
the acquisition cost, and the adverse drug reaction-related cost of 
dapagliflozin. The effects and costs of the interventions were consistent 
between base-case analyses and the probabilistic model (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio: $19,023.35 [$13,637.8-$27,483.1]).
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin added to the standard of care was cost effective 
relative to the standard of care alone in the USA for patients with diabetic 
nephropathy.

Empirical Analysis of Health Assessment Objective and Subjective Methods on the 
Determinants of Health.

Saint-Denis, France.

BACKGROUND: There are several methods for assessing health status. The aims of 
this study were to investigate the empirical differences between health 
assessment objective and subjective methods, to identify a possible long-term 
relationship between methods and health determinants and the influence of these 
methods on the perceived level of risk according to health determinants.
METHODS: Using data from 1970 to 2018 in the United States, health status was 
assessed by perception of health, absence from work due to self-reported 
illness, life expectancy at birth and mortality rate. Health determinants were 
tobacco and alcohol consumptions, number of physicians per 1,000 persons, stay 
in hospitalization unit, curative care, release of greenhouse gases, per capita 
gross domestic product (GDP) and urbanization. The differences between health 
objective and subjective assessment methods were investigated through a 
Generalized linear model, a structural break date of health methods was 
investigated by Chow test and the long-term relationship between health 
assessment methods and health determinants by Engle and Granger cointegration 
test.
RESULTS: Tobacco consumption was associated with a decrease of life expectancy 
while no long-term causal relationship was found between them. There was a 
positive correlation between alcohol consumption and perception of good health 
with a long-term causal relationship. Although per capita GDP positively 
influenced life expectancy, there was no cointegration between them. The release 
of greenhouse gases was positively correlated with both the absence from work 
due to self-reported illness and the perception of good health. Finally, 
curative care was associated with a decrease of mortality and absence from work 
due to self-reported illness and an increase of life expectancy and perception 
of good health while hospitalization is positively correlated with mortality and 
negatively correlated with life expectancy with a long-term causal relationship. 
Finally, the number of physicians per 1,000 persons was not correlated with 
health assessment methods used.
CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the influence of health assessment methods on 
the determinants of health and the fact that the perceived risk of health 
determinants changes according to the method used. Thus, the impact of health 
assessment methods must be considered in order to prioritize the determinants of

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the short-term effects of partial 
fibular head osteotomy for treating posterolateral tibial plateau fractures.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 25 patients with 
posterolateral tibial plateau fractures who were treated using a partial fibular 
head osteotomy approach. Computed tomography was performed for fracture typing 
and evaluation. The mode of injury, time from injury to surgery, time for 
fracture union, range of motion of the knee, and complications were recorded. 
Knee joint function was evaluated using the Hospital for Special Surgery Mayo 
Score (HSS).
RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 21.5 (range, 12-36) months. Fracture 
united in all patients and the average clinical healing time for fractures was 
11.2 ± 1.9 (range, 8-16) weeks. The mean time from injury to surgery was 
3.1 ± 1.8 (range, 1-10) days. The mean range of flexion was 131.6° ± 12.5° 
(range, 110°-145°). The mean range of extension was 1.4°-4.2° (range, -5°-10°). 
The mean HSS at the final follow-up was 93.5 ± 5.4 (range, 79-100). None of the 
patients exhibited symptoms of common peroneal nerve injury, knee instability, 
or upper tibiofibular joint injury. One patient had a superficial infection and 
was treated with surgical dressing.
CONCLUSION: The partial fibular head osteotomy approach is a feasible 
alternative for treating posterolateral tibial plateau fractures.

RNA-Seq has made significant contributions to various fields, particularly in 
cancer research. Recent studies on differential gene expression analysis and the 
discovery of novel cancer biomarkers have extensively used RNA-Seq data. New 
biomarker identification is essential for moving cancer research forward, and 
early cancer diagnosis improves patients' chances of recovery and increases life 
expectancy. There is an urgency and scope of improvement in both sections. In 
this paper, we developed an autoencoder-based biomarker identification method by 
reversing the learning mechanism of the trained encoders. We devised an 
explainable post hoc methodology for identifying influential genes with a high 
likelihood of becoming biomarkers. We applied recursive feature elimination to 
shorten the list further and presented a list of 17 potential biomarkers that 
are 99.93% accurate in identifying cancer types using support vector machine for 
the UCI gene expression cancer RNA-Seq dataset consisting of five cancerous 
tumor types. Our methodology outperforms all of the state-of-the-art methods, 
confirming the potential of the newly identified biomarkers as well as the 
efficacy of the biomarker identification procedure. Moreover, we have evaluated 
the performance of our methodology using six independent RNA-Seq gene expression 
datasets for several tasks, i.e., classification of tumors from non-tumors, 
detecting the origin of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and predicting if 
metastasis occurs or not. Our methodology achieved stimulating results for these 
tasks as well. The source code of this project is available at

BACKGROUND: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have reduced life expectancy 
compared to the general population. Genetic variation was shown to play a role 
in the heterogeneity of survival for patients with PD, although the underlying 
genetic background remains poorly studied.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to explore the genetic determinants influencing the 
survival of PD.
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association analysis using a Cox 
proportional hazards model in a longitudinal cohort of 1080 Chinese patients 
with PD. Furthermore, we built a clinical-genetic model to predict the survival 
of patients using clinical variables combined with polygenic risk score (PRS) of 
survival of PD.
RESULTS: The cohort was followed up for an average of 7.13 years, with 85 
incidents of death. One locus rs12628329 (RPL3) was significantly associated 
with reduced survival time by ~10.8 months (P = 2.72E-08, β = 1.79, standard 
error = 0.32). Functional exploration suggested this variant could upregulate 
the expression of RPL3 and induce apoptosis and cell death. In addition, adding 
PRS of survival in the prediction model substantially improved survival 
predictability (concordance index [Cindex]: 0.936) compared with the clinical 
model (Cindex: 0.860).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings improve the current understanding of the genetic 
cause of survival of PD and provide a novel target RPL3 for further research on 
PD pathogenesis and potential therapeutic options. Our results also demonstrate 
the potential utility of PRS of survival in identifying patients with shorter 
survival and providing personalized clinical monitoring and treatment. © 2022

BACKGROUND: Professional guidelines in the U.S. do not recommend routine 
screening mammography for women ≥75 years with limited life expectancy and/or 
poor health. Yet, routine mammography remains widely used in older women. We 
examined older women's experiences, beliefs, and opinions about screening 
mammography in relation to aging and health.
METHODS: We performed thematic analysis of transcribed semi-structured 
interviews with 19 women who had a recent screening visit at a mammography 
clinic in New York City (average age: 75 years, 63% Hispanic, 53% ≤high school 
education).
RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: (1) older women typically perceive 
mammograms as a positive, beneficial, and routine component of care; (2) 
participation in routine mammography is reinforced by factors at interpersonal, 
provider, and healthcare system levels; and (3) older women do not endorse 
discontinuation of screening mammography due to advancing age or poor health, 
but some may be receptive to reducing screening frequency. Only a few older 
women reported having discussed mammography cessation or the potential harms of 
screening with their providers. A few women reported they would insist on 
receiving mammography even without a provider recommendation.
CONCLUSIONS: Older women's positive experiences and views, as well as multilevel 
and frequently automated cues toward mammography are important drivers of 
routine screening in older women. These findings suggest a need for synergistic 
patient, provider, and system level strategies to reduce mammography overuse in 
older women.

The European continent has one of the longest life expectancies in the world, 
but still faces a significant challenge to meet the health targets set by the 
Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations for 2030. To improve the 
understanding of the rationale that guides health outcomes in Europe, this study 
assesses the direction and magnitude effects of the drivers that contribute to 
explain life expectancy at birth across 30 European countries for the period 
2008-2018 at macro-level. For this purpose, an aggregated health production 
function is used allowing for spatial effects. The results indicate that an 
increase in the income level, health expenditure, trade openness, education 
attainment, or urbanisation might lead to an increase in life expectancy at 
birth, whereas calories intake or quantity of air pollutants have a negative 
impact on this health indicator. This implies that health policies should look 
beyond economic factors and focus also on social and environmental drivers. The 
results also indicate the existence of significant spillover effects, 
highlighting the need for coordinated European policies that account for the 
synergies between countries. Finally, a foresight analysis is conducted to 
obtain projections for 2030 under different socioeconomic pathways. Results 
reveal significant differences on longevity projections depending on the 
adoption, or not, of a more sustainable model of human development and provides 
valuable insight on the need for anticipatory planning measures to make longer 
life-spans compatible with the maintenance of the welfare state.

BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity, which is associated with significant negative 
outcomes for individuals and health care systems, is increasing in the United 
Kingdom. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the risk factors (including 
health, behavior, and environment) for multimorbidity over time. An 
interdisciplinary approach is essential, as data science, artificial 
intelligence, and engineering concepts (digital twins) can identify key risk 
factors throughout the life course, potentially enabling personalized simulation 
of life-course risk for the development of multimorbidity. Predicting the risk 
of developing clusters of health conditions before they occur would add clinical 
value by enabling targeted early preventive interventions, advancing 
personalized care to improve outcomes, and reducing the burden on health care 
systems.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify key risk factors that predict 
multimorbidity throughout the life course by developing an intelligent agent 
using digital twins so that early interventions can be delivered to improve 
health outcomes. The objectives of this study are to identify key predictors of 
lifetime risk of multimorbidity, create a series of simulated computational 
digital twins that predict risk levels for specific clusters of factors, and 
test the feasibility of the system.
METHODS: This study will use machine learning to develop digital twins by 
identifying key risk factors throughout the life course that predict the risk of 
later multimorbidity. The first stage of the development will be the training of 
a base predictive model. Data from the National Child Development Study, the 
North West London Integrated Care Record, the Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink, and Cerner's Real World Data will be split into subsets for training 
and validation, which will be done following the k-fold cross-validation 
procedure and assessed with the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool 
(PROBAST). In addition, 2 data sets-the Early-Life Data Cross-linkage in 
Research study and the Children and Young People's Health Partnership randomized 
controlled trial-will be used to develop a series of digital twin personas that 
simulate clusters of factors to predict different risk levels of developing 
multimorbidity.
RESULTS: The expected results are a validated model, a series of digital twin 
personas, and a proof-of-concept assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital twins could provide an individualized early warning system 
that predicts the risk of future health conditions and recommends the most 
effective intervention to minimize that risk. These insights could significantly 
improve an individual's quality of life and healthy life expectancy and reduce 
population-level health burdens.

Objectives In recent years, issues related to physical health took on a major 
role in the care of youth who experienced a first episode psychosis (FEP). 
Compared to the general population, people with a psychotic disorder have a 
reduced life expectancy of 15 years, with physical health problems accounting 
for 60 to 70% of that part. With the increased awareness about these issues, 
physical activity is considered as a new prevention and intervention strategy in 
the recovery process for youth with a FEP. The objective of the present article 
is to summarize the different physical health issues in FEP and the impacts of 
physical activity. Methods Narrative review addressing physical health issues, 
the role of antipsychotics, the need for metabolic monitoring, and for 
improvement of lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking, sedentary lifestyle, physical 
inactivity, poor diet) in youth with a FEP. The impact of physical activity on 
physical and mental health, on smoking cessation as well as the interest of 
adventure therapy in the recovery process will be discussed. Finally, we will 
propose motivational strategies and tools to promote physical activity. In the 
different sections, we will support our arguments with the highest levels of 
evidence available (e.g., meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized 
controlled trials, cohort studies, N-of-1) and highlight implications for 
clinical practice. Results Metabolic health problems progress rapidly after the 
initiation of antipsychotic treatment, and inadequate lifestyle habits 
contribute to the development of these problems. In an early intervention 
context, several types of physical activity have shown benefits on physical 
health, psychotic symptoms, functioning and more generally in the recovery 
process. Nevertheless, few patients spontaneously engaged in regular physical 
activity because of low motivation. Physical activity interventions should be 
adapted to the FEP population and several factors taken into consideration such 
as the type of physical activity, its context, intensity, frequency, 
motivational parameters, and support/supervision from health professionals. 
Conclusion From a physical and a psychiatric perspective, the years following 
treatment initiation for FEP are critical. Considering its positive impacts on 
different dimensions of recovery physical activity interventions should be 
integrated into the range of services offered in early intervention services.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is significantly decreased in bipolar disorder (BD). 
This is associated with accelerated cellular aging which can be estimated by 
telomere length (TL). However, specific determinants of shorter TL in BD are 
under-explored. This study examines whether circadian misalignment (i.e. 
mismatch between preferred and actual phase of circadian activity rhythms) is 
associated with shorter TL in BD.
METHODS: Euthymic individuals with BD (n = 101) undertook 21 consecutive days of 
actigraphy recording and completed the Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM) to 
assess phase preference for activities (chronotype). Polymerase chain reaction 
was used to measure TL in blood. Cluster analysis identified circadian 
aligned/misaligned subgroups as defined by preferred (CSM score) and actual 
phases of activity (actigraphically determined onset of active and inactive 
periods). We tested for any associations between TL and clusters, with 
adjustments for between-cluster differences in socio-demographic and illness 
factors.
RESULTS: We identified three clusters: an "Aligned Morning" cluster (n = 31) 
with preferred and actual timing of activity in the morning, an "Aligned 
Evening" cluster (n = 37) with preferred and actual timing of activity in the 
evening and a "Misaligned" cluster (n = 32) with an evening chronotype, but an 
earlier objective onset of active periods. After adjustment for confounders, we 
found that TL was significantly associated with circadian misalignment and older 
age.
CONCLUSIONS: Circadian misalignment may partly explain shorter TL in BD and 
could contribute to accelerated aging in these individuals.
