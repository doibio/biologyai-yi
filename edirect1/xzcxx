for HEV infection in SOT recipients in the UK.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to evaluate the cost-utility of 4 
HEV screening options over the lifetime of 1000 SOT recipients. The current 
baseline of nonsystematic testing was compared with annual screening of all 
patients by polymerase chain reaction (PCR; strategy A) or HEV-antigen (HEV-Ag) 
detection (strategy B) and selective screening of patients who have a raised 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value by PCR (strategy C) or HEV-Ag (strategy D). 
The primary outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY). We adopted the National Health Service (NHS) perspective and discounted 
future costs and benefits at 3.5%.
RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay of £20 000/QALY gained, systematic screening of 
SOT patients by any method (strategy A-D) had a high probability (77.9%) of 
being cost-effective. Among screening strategies, strategy D is optimal and 
expected to be cost-saving to the NHS; if only PCR testing strategies are 
considered, then strategy C becomes cost-effective (£660/QALY). These findings 
were robust against a wide range of sensitivity and scenario analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model showed that routine screening for HEV in SOT patients is 
very likely to be cost-effective in the UK, particularly in patients presenting 
with an abnormal alanine aminotransferase.

Recurrent fluctuations in health states can occur as a result of long-term 
conditions with episodic symptoms or through side effects of cycles of 
treatment. Fluctuations and associated duration of symptoms can be predictable 
(eg, side effects of chemotherapy treatment) or unpredictable (eg, relapse in 
multiple sclerosis). Such recurrent fluctuations in health states can have an 
important impact on a person's health-related quality of life. When symptoms 
vary by time of day, day of the week, or during the month, it is challenging to 
obtain reliable health-related quality of life estimates for use in assessing 
cost-effectiveness of interventions. The adequacy of the quality of life 
estimate will be affected by (1) the standard recall period associated with the 
chosen measure (eg, "health today" EQ-5D, "past 4 weeks" for SF-36/SF-6D) and 
the way that respondents understand and make judgments about these recall 
periods, (2) the chosen time points for assessing health-related quality of life 
in relation to the fluctuations in health, and (3) the assumptions used to 
interpolate between measurement time points and thus calculate the 
quality-adjusted life-years. These issues have not received sufficient 
methodological attention and instead remain poorly accounted for in economic 
analyses. There is potential for these issues to considerably distort treatment 
decisions away from the optimal allocation. This article brings together 
evidence from health economics, psychology, and behavioral economics to explore 
these challenges in depth; presents the solutions that have been applied to 
date; and details a methodological research agenda for measuring 
quality-adjusted life-years in recurrent fluctuating health states.

OBJECTIVES: To map the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis 
Index (WOMAC) onto the EQ-5D-5L in patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis 
(OA).
METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on 758 patients with 
hip or knee OA who completed the EQ-5D-5L and WOMAC questionnaires, of whom 644 
completed them both again 6 months later. Baseline data were used to derive 
mapping functions. Generalized additive models were used to identify to which 
powers the WOMAC subscales should be raised to achieve a linear relationship 
with the response. For the modeling, general linear models (GLM), Tobit models, 
and beta regression models were used. Age, sex, and affected joints were also 
considered. Preferred models were selected based on Akaike and Bayesian 
information criteria, adjusted R2, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean 
squared error (RMSE). The functions were validated with the follow-up data using 
MAE, RMSE, and the intraclass correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: The preferred models were a GLM with Pain2+Pain3+Function+Pain·Function 
as covariates and a beta model with Pain3+Function+Function2+Function3 as 
covariates. The adjusted R2 were similar (0.6190 and 0.6136, respectively). The 
predictive performance of these models in the validation sample was similar and 
both models showed an overprediction for health states worse than death.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, these are the first functions mapping the WOMAC 
onto the EQ-5D-5L in patients with hip or knee OA. They showed an acceptable fit 
and precision and could be very useful for clinicians and researchers when 
cost-effectiveness studies are needed and generic preference-based 
health-related quality of life instruments to derive utilities are not 
available.

Are Current Reporting Standards Used to Describe Health State Utilities in 
Cost-Effectiveness Models Satisfactory?

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to examine current reporting standards of 
health state utilities (HSU) using a review of published cost-effectiveness 
analyses in cardiovascular disease and to explore the impact of variation in 
model inputs used in these on estimated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 
cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: Key health/economics bibliographic databases were searched to identify 
relevant articles published after 2014. Any narrative or values relating to the 
HSU used in the model were extracted and reviewed. The HSUs were systematically 
applied to an existing model to explore the influence of different values on 
QALYs and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: Twenty-four peer-reviewed articles were identified. Only 2 studies 
referred to a literature review for the HSUs. Most (18 of 24) referenced 
previously published economic studies (as opposed to the original source) for at 
least 1 of the HSUs. Only 4 studies referenced the original sources and reported 
all of the HSUs accurately, and several did not provide all the HSUs. Little 
information was provided on the methods used to calculate QALYs, for example, 
the duration of time for acute HSUs, what the baseline HSU was, the method that 
was used to assign HSUs for subsequent different events, or how constant HSUs 
for clinical events were combined with age-adjusted baseline values. The huge 
differences in HSUs used in the studies produced substantial variations in the 
QALYs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios generated from the 
cost-effectiveness model.
CONCLUSION: Current standards are poor, and there is a need for greater 
transparency in reporting the HSUs used in cost-effectiveness models.

Interventional cardiology has made extraordinary advances over recent years, but 
most are still limited to addressing single intracardiac or valvular lesions. 
This debate considers whether complete interventional repair of more complex 
congenital defects might become achievable. Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is 
probably the first candidate where complete interventional repair might be 
achieved-given that various components of the defect have already been 
successfully addressed-albeit as either a palliative intervention (RVOT 
stenting) or to address the sequelae of standard surgery (percutaneous PVR). 
This article considers the challenges that would need to be overcome in terms of 
the morphology of the condition, the age limitations, and the necessary 
technological advancements that would be required-while setting these against 
the benchmark of current surgical outcomes and the parallel progress that is 
being developed in surgical correction. While complete interventional repair of 
ToF may still be beyond current techniques, a hybrid approach between surgeons 
and intentional cardiologists can strive to create a life-long paradigm of care 
that minimizes the need for surgery and focuses on the maintenance of a healthy 
right ventricle, such that patients born with ToF can achieve normal life 
expectancy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the last decade, myocarditis has been increasingly 
recognized as common cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults and heart 
failure overall. The purpose of this review is to discuss hypothesis of 
development of non-infectious myocarditis, to provide a description of the 
immunopathogenesis and the most common mechanisms of autoimmunity in 
myocarditis, and to provide an update on therapeutic options.
RECENT FINDINGS: A new entity of myocarditis is immune checkpoint inhibitor 
(ICI) induced myocarditis. ICIs are used in advanced cancer to "disinhibit" the 
immune system and make it more aggressive in fighting cancer. This novel drug 
class has doubled life expectancy in metastatic melanoma and significantly 
increased progression free survival in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, but 
comes with a risk of autoimmune diseases such as myocarditis resulting from an 
overly aggressive immune system. Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the 
heart with major public health impact. Thorough understanding of its 
immunopathogenesis is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.

The Cost-effectiveness of Eltrombopag for the Treatment of Immune 
Thrombocytopenia in the United States.

PURPOSE: Eltrombopag was evaluated as a second-line treatment for adult chronic 
immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in the 2006 Phase III RAISE (Eltrombopag for 
Management of Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia) randomized, placebo-controlled 
trial. More than 80% of patients reached satisfactory platelet counts within 2 
weeks. However, the economic value of eltrombopag as a second-line treatment for 
ITP remains to be formally assessed. This study aimed to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of treating ITP with a comparable thrombopoietin receptor 
agonist (eltrombopag vs romiplostim).
METHODS: A Markov model was implemented over a lifetime time horizon to estimate 
the benefits and costs of each treatment. The model featured 3 health states 
based on current guidelines: (1) on treatment; (2) treatment 
failure/discontinuation; and (3) mortality. In line with therapeutic goals in 
ITP, model patients could experience 3 events: no bleeding, mild/moderate 
bleeding, or severe bleeding. Data on eltrombopag use were obtained from an 
open-label extension of previous Phase II/III trials, including RAISE. 
Romiplostim data were obtained from Phase III trials and an extension study. 
Lifetime overall survival was extrapolated by using treatment-specific mortality 
rates derived from severe bleeding and natural mortality rates. The costs of 
drugs, routine care, bleeding episodes, adverse events, and mortality were 
represented in the model.
FINDINGS: Eltrombopag-treated patients gained 17.58 life years and 14.68 
quality-adjusted life years, whereas romiplostim-treated patients gained 17.52 
life years and 14.67 quality-adjusted life years. The total lifetime cost of 
eltrombopag treatment was estimated at $1.58 million versus $2.13 million for 
romiplostim. Sensitivity analyses supported base case findings. Deterministic 
sensitivity analysis predicted the greatest sensitivity to the rates of severe 
bleeding, discontinuation, and natural mortality. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis showed that eltrombopag would be an efficient use of resources at a 
$50,000 threshold in 52.8% of cases. In all probabilistic iterations, the total 
cost of eltrombopag treatment was lower than with romiplostim, primarily because 
of lower drug costs.
IMPLICATIONS: Clinical data were applied in an economic analysis, and 
eltrombopag exhibited economic dominance compared with romiplostim, driven 
largely by the reduced costs of primary therapy. This model was limited by a 
lack of specific patient-level data and robust data on the duration of secondary 
therapy, as well as by the fact that utilization values are likely conservative 
estimates for routine care use.

Currently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends one-time 
tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) 
vaccination for all adults 19 years and older. This study is designed to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Tdap vaccination for Tdap-eligible adults 
aged 19 through 85 in the United States. A cost-effectiveness model was 
developed to compute costs and health outcomes associated with pertussis among 
100,000 Tdap-eligible persons of each age cohort. From the societal perspective, 
the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved was evaluated under the 
vaccination scenarios. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to evaluate the 
impacts of changes in key variables. All costs were adjusted to 2018 US$ with an 
annual discount rate of 3% applied to costs and outcomes. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for vaccinating US adults aged 19 to 85 with 
Tdap ranged from $248,000/QALY to $900,000/QALY. The lowest cost per QALY was 
found to be $248,000 for the age 65 cohort, followed by $332,000 for the cohort 
of age 19, and followed by $477,000 for the age 50 cohort. Sensitivity analysis 
showed the most dramatic changes in ICER occurred when changing the 
underreporting factor, vaccine effectiveness and vaccination costs. While Tdap 
vaccination may not be as cost effective as predicted earlier, it remains the 
best available preventive measure against pertussis. Further investigation of 
the true burden of pertussis disease among adults and the effectiveness of Tdap 
vaccination in this population is needed to better estimate the impact of Tdap 
vaccination.

INTRODUCTION: Ixekizumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that selectively 
targets interleukin-17A, is approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis. Our objective was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of 
ixekizumab in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis through 5 years.
METHODS: Data were integrated from the UNCOVER-1 and UNCOVER-2, randomized, 
double-blinded, phase-3 trials. Patients who continuously received the labeled 
ixekizumab dose, were static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) (0,1) 
responders at Week 12 and completed 60 weeks of treatment could enter the 
long-term extension (LTE) period. Patients could escalate to every-2-week dosing 
per investigator opinion. Efficacy and health outcomes included proportion of 
patients achieving Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75/90/100, sPGA 
(0,1) and (0), absolute PASI ≤ 5/ ≤ 3/ ≤ 2/ ≤ 1 and Dermatology Life Quality 
Index (DLQI) (0,1). Results exclude patients who escalated to every-2-week 
dosing. A modified non-responder imputation method was used to account for 
missing data. Supplemental analyses include patients who escalated to 
every-2-week dosing and observed and multiple imputation results. 
Exposure-adjusted safety outcomes are also reported.
RESULTS: Of 206 patients who entered the LTE periods, 172 completed treatment. 
At Week 60, PASI 75/90/100 responses were 94.7%, 85.0% and 62.1%, respectively, 
and at year 5 were 90.3%, 71.3% and 46.3%, respectively. Similarly, meaningful 
responses were achieved for the other efficacy and health measures. Among 
patients with PASI 100 through 5 years, 92% achieved DLQI (0,1), indicating no 
impact of skin disease on quality of life. During the LTE period, 
exposure-adjusted incidence rates were 31.4 per 100 patient-years for 
treatment-emergent adverse events and 6.8 per 100 patient-years for serious 
adverse events. No deaths were reported. No new or unexpected safety findings 
were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate 80 mg ixekizumab maintains long-term 
efficacy and a safety profile consistent with previous data in patients with 
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis through 5 years of treatment.

BACKGROUND: There is little information on the cost and outcome of different 
treatments for femoral neck fractures. This study aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of internal fixation compared with hemiarthroplasty (HA) for 
elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 121 patients ≥ 65 years old were divided into 
internal fixation (n = 58) or HA group (n = 63). Clinical outcome was evaluated 
by the EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) score at 3, 12, and 24 months. The total 
costs including medical and non-medical expense were collected through 
hospitalisation information, cost diaries, and telephone interviews. A 
cost-utility analysis of the total costs in combination with quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) calculated by EQ-5D and survival time was conducted. Results 
were expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: The mean EQ-5D index score in the HA group were higher at the early 
follow-up (p<0.05). At 24 months there were no differences in EQ-5D between the 
2 treatment groups (p>0.05). Over the 2-year period, patients treated with HA 
gained 0.09-0.10 more QALYs than those treated with internal fixation, while the 
mean total costs for internal fixation (CNY 55,676) were significantly lower 
than for HA (CNY 80,297) (P<0.001). ICER indicated that internal fixation may be 
more cost-effective than HA.
CONCLUSION: HA is associated with better outcome than internal fixation in the 
treatment of displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients. However, 
internal fixation may be more cost-effective because of less total cost.

INTRODUCTION: Sexual activity is important for marital quality, especially in 
cervical cancer survivors. Vagina extension following laparoscopic radical 
hysterectomy with bilateral ovarian preservation (VEOP), vagina extension 
following laparoscopic radical hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy (VEBO), 
radical hysterectomy with bilateral ovarian preservation (RHOP), and radical 
hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy (RHBO) are the common surgeries for 
young cervical cancer patients.
AIM: To investigate the effect of the 4 surgical methods on female/male sexual 
activity and marital quality in early-stage cervical cancer survivors.
METHODS: Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted in 205 patients with 
stage Ia1-IIa2 cervical cancer to evaluate the factors that affected male/female 
sexual function and marital quality.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), modified Kupperman 
Index (KI), modified Sexual Life Quality Questionnaire (mSLQQ-QoL), and ENRICH 
marital inventory were used to reflect changes in female/male sexual function 
and marital quality in the 4 groups.
RESULTS: Female/male sexual function and marital quality were both highest in 
the VEOP group and lowest in the RHBO group. The regression results showed that 
ovarian preservation and vaginal extension were associated with female/male 
sexual function and marital quality. Furthermore, when vaginal extension and 
ovarian preservation were replaced by vaginal length, sexual psychological 
change, and hormone level index (KI), respectively; male sexual function was 
associated with vaginal length and sexual psychological change, whereas female 
sexual function and marital quality were only associated with hormone level and 
sexual psychological change. Clinical statistics found that four-fifths of the 
recurrent patients had vaginal extension (P = .042), and 3-quarters of these 
patients had large tumors.
CONCLUSION: Ovarian preservation and vaginal extension are both important for 
male/female sexual activity and marital quality. Vaginal extension may play a 
positive role in female sexual life via psychology and in male sexual life via 
vaginal length. Vaginal extension may not be suitable for patients with large 
masses. Zhang Y, Sun S, Ding J, et al. The Effect of Different Surgical Methods

CONTEXT: Previous studies from the U.S. and Canada report deficiencies in 
informed decision making and a need to improve end-of-life (EoL) care in 
patients undergoing dialysis. However, there is a paucity of literature on these 
issues in Pakistani dialysis patients, who differ from Western patients in 
culture, religion, and available health care services.
OBJECTIVES: To study informed dialysis decision-making and EoL attitudes and 
beliefs in Pakistani patients receiving dialysis.
METHODS: We used convenience sampling to collect 522 surveys (90% response rate) 
from patients in seven different dialysis units in Pakistan. We used an existing 
dialysis survey tool, translated into Urdu, and backtranslated to English. A 
facilitator distributed the survey, explained questions, and orally administered 
it to patients unable to read.
RESULTS: Less than one-fourth of the respondents (23%) felt informed about their 
medical condition, and 45% were hopeful that their condition would improve in 
the future. More than half (54%) wished to know their prognosis, and 80% 
reported having no prognostic discussion. Almost 63% deemed EoL planning 
important, but only 5% recalled discussing EoL decisions with a doctor during 
the last 12 months. Nearly 62% of the patients regretted their decision to start 
dialysis. Patients' self-reported knowledge of hospice (5%) and palliative care 
(7.9%) services was very limited, yet 46% preferred a treatment plan focused on 
comfort and symptom management rather than life extension.
CONCLUSION: Pakistani patients reported a need for better informed dialysis 
decision making and EoL care and better access to palliative care services. 
These findings underscore the need for palliative care training of Pakistani 
physicians and in other developing countries to help address communication and 
EoL needs of their dialysis patients.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common valve disorder in an ageing population in 
western countries, and women, with longer life expectancy, comprise a 
substantial percentage of elderly patients with AS. Compared with men, women 
exhibit distinctive characteristics at the level of stenotic valve leaflets and 
subsequent compensatory responses of the left ventricle to chronic pressure 
overload, and in clinical presentation, consequences and response to 
intervention. Randomised controlled trials of transcatheter aortic valve 
implantation have yielded new evidence of sex differences in both short-term and 
long-term outcomes after intervention. A comprehensive knowledge of the existing 
evidence may inform our understanding of gender differences during assessment 
and treatment of patients with AS. In this paper, we review the available 
evidence regarding sex differences in AS in terms of symptoms, clinical 
presentation, anatomical differences and pathophysiological progression, 
management and outcomes after aortic valve replacement. Implications for further 
research are suggested.

Objective: The positive effect of high socioeconomic position (SEP) on health is 
well established. According Minorities' Diminished Returns (MDRs) theory, 
however, the SEP-health link is smaller for Blacks compared to Whites. Using a 
25-year follow up data of a national sample, this study tested racial 
differences in the effects of marital status on life expectancy among American 
adults. Materials and methods: The data of Americans' Changing Lives (ACL, 1986 
- 2011) were used. The ACL is a nationally representative longitudinal cohort 
study followed 3,361 White or Blacks adults from 1986 to 2011. The predictor of 
interest was marital status in 1986. Confounders included demographic factors 
(age and gender), SEP (education and employment), health behaviors (drinking, 
smoking, and physical activity), and health status (depressive symptoms, chronic 
disease, and self-rated health) all measured at baseline. Race was the moderator 
variable. All-cause mortality was the main dependent variable (outcome). Cox 
proportional hazard modeling was applied for data analysis. Results: In the 
overall sample, individuals who were married at baseline had a lower risk of 
mortality during the 25 years of follow up. Race altered the effect of marital 
status on life expectancy, indicating smaller protective effect for Blacks 
relative to Whites. Race -specific Cox regression models showed an association 
between marital status and life expectancy for White but not Black Americans. 
Conclusion: In line with the MDRs theory, the health gain that follows marital 
status is diminished for Black Americans compared to White Americans. Only 
equalizing SEP across racial groups may not be adequate for eliminating 
racial/ethnic health inequalities. Policies should go beyond SEP and reduce 
societal and structural barriers that disproportionately hinder Blacks from 
translating their SEP indicators to desirable health outcomes.

Objective: Cancer is expected to be the leading cause of death worldwide within 
the 21st century and is the single most important obstacle to extending life 
expectancy. Unfortunately, the most effective approach to combating cancers 
remains a complex and unsolved problem. Siglec-15 is a member of the Siglec 
family and plays a conserved regulatory role in the immune system of 
vertebrates. Previous studies on Siglec-15 have focused on its function in 
osteoclast regulation. The purpose of this study was to explore the significance 
of Siglec-15 mRNA in human cancer mainly based on information obtained from 
online databases. Method: Data were collected from several online databases. 
Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and Virtual Northern, UALCAN Database 
Analysis, Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) analysis, the cBio 
cancer genomics portal, Cancer Regulome tools and data, Kaplan-Meier Plotter 
Analysis and the UCSC Xena website were used to analyze the data. Results: 
Compared with normal tissues, Siglec-15 up-regulation was widely observed in 
tuomrs. Differences in Siglec-15 expression were associated with different 
prognoses. Siglec-15 mutations are widely observed in tumors and interact with 
different genes in different cancer types. Conclusion: Siglec-15 is a potential 
target for the expansion of cancer immunotherapy.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder; despite significant 
improvements in supportive care, SCD continues to cause substantial morbidity, 
mortality, and reduced life expectancy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only widely available curative therapy 
for SCD, which is offered as a standard of care for patients with a matched 
sibling donor (MSD). Donor availability is limited to a minority of patients. 
Thus, αβ/CD3-depleted haploidentical HSCT, as an efficient means for depletion 
of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)-mediating T cells, can be offered as an 
alternative curative therapy, particularly for nonmalignant diseases such as 
SCD. Out of 38 patients with advanced stage SCD, 25 were transplanted with 
CD3/CD19- or T-cell receptor αβ/CD19 T-cell-depleted peripheral stem cell grafts 
(T-haplo-HSCT group), whereas 13 transplanted from MSD (MSD group); both groups 
received an almost identical conditioning regimen. Engraftment was achieved in 
all. However, in the T-haplo-HSCT group, three patients succumbed to an 
uncontrolled cytomegalovirus pneumonitis, a macrophage activation syndrome, and 
a major blood group incompatibility with a late graft failure and multiorgan 
failure. The overall survival was 88% and 100% in T-haplo-HSCT and MSD groups, 
respectively. None of our patients developed a Glucksberg Grade III-IV acute 
GvHD. Four patients (16%) in the T-haplo-HSCT group and two patients (15%) in 
the MSD group developed a steroid-sensitive, mild-to-moderate chronic GvHD that 
resolved within 18 months posttransplant. These results are encouraging and 
demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of T-haplo-HSCT in advanced 
stage SCD in children and adults, thus offering a curative alternative to 
majority of patients.

INTRODUCTION: The clinical and economic impact of cervical cancer consistently 
become a serious burden for all countries, including Indonesia. The 
implementation of HPV vaccination policy for a big country such as Indonesia 
requires a strong commitment from several decision-makers. The aim of this study 
was to provide a comprehensive description on cost-effectiveness and the 
budget-impact of HPV vaccination policy in Indonesia.
METHOD: A cohort Markov model was used to evaluate the cost and the clinical 
impact of HPV vaccination for 10 years old girls in Indonesia. The researchers 
consider two doses of all three available HPV vaccines adjusted with the HPV 
infection profilewith 95% vaccination coverage to estimate the national cervical 
cancer incidence and mortality. The Budget impact analysis explores three 
different scenarios covering (1) Two districts per year expansion, (2) 
oneprovince per year expansion and (3) achieving the National Immunization 
Program in 2024.
RESULTS: Upon fully vaccinating almost 2.3 million 10-year-old girls, 34,723; 
43,414; and 51,522 cervical cancer cases were prevented by Quadrivalent, 
Bivalent and Nonavalent vaccines, consecutively. Furthermore, the highest (591 
cases) and lowest (399 cases) mortality were prevented by Nonavalent and 
Quadrivalent vaccines, respectively. Most of the vaccines were considerably 
cost-effective and only the Bivalent vaccine with the GAVI/UNICEF price which 
will be considered a cost-saving strategy.To provide national coverage of HPV 
vaccination in Indonesia, the government has to provide an annual budget of 
about US$49 million and US$22 million using the government contract price and 
GAVI/UNICEF price, respectively.
CONCLUSION: HPV vaccination shows a cost-effective strategy and the budget 
required to provide this policy is considerably affordable for Indonesia.

In today's era of increased standards of lifestyle and life expectancy, there 
has been a constant demand for supplements by consumers. Nutraceuticals are 
among the supplements in demand. Although there is a big opportunity for the 
nutraceutical business, there are no uniform regulatory requirements in 
different regions. Nations are looking to the nutraceutical sector to help keep 
their populations healthy and safe by introducing certain rules and regulations. 
Generally, developed countries have regulations in place, but there are some 
countries, such as those in the Asia Pacific regions or in Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, that have not yet fine-tuned their 
regulations for nutraceutical products. The ASEAN countries involve highly 
commercialized markets such as Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and the 
Philippines. The overall nutraceutical market of ASEAN countries is growing at a 
compound annual growth rate of ∼8.4%. About 40% of the ASEAN population consumes 
nutraceuticals on a daily basis. ASEAN countries are forming harmonized 
regulations for dietary supplements. This could be a big opportunity for 
manufacturers to introduce their products into the ASEAN market. A special unit 
of the Traditional Medicine and Health Supplements Product Working Group (TMHA 
PWG) helps manufacturers understand the regulatory procedures of these 
countries. Despite countries' own special requirements, manufacturers can follow 
the standards and harmonized guidelines put forth by TMHA PWG. The aim of this 
review is to introduce the regulatory procedure and requirements for 
international business developers to launch any new nutraceutical products into 
the ASEAN market.

OBJECTIVES: The average life expectancy in the United Kingdom is currently 
nearly 80 years for a newborn baby with nearly 15% of the population, by 2040, 
being >75 years old. Hearing impairment is a common disability in the elderly 
individual, and there have been significant drives to support this population to 
lead longer and healthier working lives. We aimed to assess the long-term 
audiological and health-related quality-of-life benefits of cochlear implants 
(CI) in elderly individuals.
METHODS: A retrospective and cross-sectional study of patients who received a CI 
at ≥70 years. Data extracted included speech perception scores, adverse events, 
telephone use, and patient-reported outcome measures using the Glasgow Benefit 
Inventory questionnaire with a minimum of 12 months follow-up.
RESULTS: Sixty-four patients aged ≥70 years received a unilateral CI. A 
significant improvement in speech perception scores in all conditions was noted 
with no significant difference between differing age groups. Glasgow Benefit 
Inventory scores showed a significant positive impact on patients' lives and 
their health status, with no significant difference between the differing age 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Cochlear implantation is a safe and well-tolerated procedure in the 
elderly patients with significant improvements observed in audiological 
performance, health status, and social interactions.

Due largely to the rise in obesity and prolonged life expectancy, endometrial 
cancer (EC) rates have increased by 56% since the early 90s. Women at high risk 
(Lynch Syndrome) have a 12-47% lifetime risk of developing EC and professional 
societies recommend annual surveillance using transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) and 
endometrial biopsy (outpatients hysteroscopy) from the age of 30-35 years with 
hysterectomy from the age of 40 years. In women at low risk, screening is not 
currently advocated. The emerging data from Genome Wide Association studies 
(GWAS) in combination with epidemiological data may refine risk stratification 
in the future. In addition to screening, preventative approaches such as 
intrauterine progesterone may help reduce disease burden in those identified at 
'higher risk'.
