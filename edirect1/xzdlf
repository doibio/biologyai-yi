Flat feet (pes planus) are considered a postural defect caused by the collapse 
of the longitudinal arch, producing complete or near-complete contact of the 
sole of the foot with the ground. Pes planus has been well-studied in clinical 
literature and paleoanthropology but has not been approached extensively in 
bioarchaeology. The main difficulty is related to the diagnosis of this 
pathology based exclusively on bone remains. In this work, we propose a metric 
and morphological method to discriminate flat foot in dry bones. Thus, we 
studied 390 pairs of adult feet in a fair state of preservation from 
archaeological contexts from Spain, Italy, and Oman. Morphological variability, 
angles, and dimensions of both the normal bones and the bones displaying flat 
foot characteristics were analyzed. We found a correlation between the presence 
of flat foot and some morphological and metric features, mainly in the subtalar 
and Chopart joints. These results are expressed through a combination of 
morphological and metric variables, which are useful to discriminate between 
these two groups. No markedly significant differences of flat foot frequencies 
between the Spanish and Italian series were found across centuries. However, we 
noticed a notable increase of the prevalence of flat foot in the contemporary 
collection, possibly due to the consequences of a rise in life expectancy and 
modern styles of footwear.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for patients with degenerative lumbar 
spondylolisthesis (DLS) relative to failed medical management with the 
cost-effectiveness of hip and knee arthroplasty for matched cohorts of patients 
with osteoarthritis.
METHODS: A cohort of patients with DLS undergoing MIS procedures with 
decompression alone or decompression and instrumented fusion between 2008 and 
2014 was matched to cohorts of patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) and knee OA 
undergoing total joint replacement. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were 
calculated from the perspective of the Ontario Ministry of Health, using 
prospectively collected Short Form-6 Dimension utility data. Costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at 3% and sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Sixty-six patients met the inclusion criteria for the DLS cohort (n = 
35 for decompression alone), with a minimum follow-up time of 1 year (mean 1.7 
yr). The mean age of patients in the DLS cohort was 64.76 years, and 45 patients 
(68.2%) were female. For each cohort, utility scores improved from baseline to 
follow-up and the magnitude of the gain did not differ by group. Lifetime ICURs 
comparing surgical with nonsurgical care were Can$7946/QALY, Can$7104/QALY and 
Can$5098/QALY for the DLS, knee OA and hip OA cohorts, respectively. Subgroup 
analysis yielded an increased ICUR for the patients with DLS who underwent 
decompression and fusion (Can$9870/QALY) compared with that for the patients 
with DLS who underwent decompression alone (Can$5045/QALY). The rank order of 
the ICURs by group did not change with deterministic or probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Lifetime ICURs for MIS procedures for DLS are similar to those for 
total joint replacement. Future research should adopt a societal perspective and 
potentially capture further economic benefits of MIS procedures.

Publisher: CONTEXTE: L’objectif de cette étude était de comparer le rapport 
coût–efficacité de la chirurgie minimalement effractive (CME) chez les patients 
atteints de spondylolisthésis lombaire dégénératif (SLD) en lien avec un échec 
de la prise en charge médicale à celui de l’arthroplastie de la hanche et du 
genou pour des cohortes assorties de patients atteints d’arthrose.
MÉTHODES: Une cohorte de patients atteints de SLD soumis à une CME avec 
décompression seule ou décompression avec arthrodèse entre 2008 et 2014 a été 
assortie à des cohortes de patients soumis à une arthroplastie totale pour 
arthrose de la hanche et du genou. Les rapports coût–utilité différentiels 
(RCUD) ont été calculés du point de vue du ministère de la Santé de l’Ontario à 
l’aide des données d’utilité du questionnaire Short Form–6 Dimension recueillies 
de manière prospective. Les coûts et les années de vie ajustées en fonction de 
la qualité (AVAQ) ont été actualisés à un taux de 3 % et des analyses de 
sensibilité ont été effectuées.
RÉSULTATS: Soixante-six patients répondaient aux critères d’inclusion pour la 
cohorte SLD (n = 35, décompression seule), avec un suivi d’une durée minimale de 
1 an (moyenne 1,7 an). L’âge moyen des gens de la cohorte SLD était de 64,76 
ans, et 45 patients (68,2 %) étaient de sexe féminin. Pour chaque cohorte, les 
scores d’utilité se sont améliorés entre les valeurs de départ et les valeurs de 
suivi et l’ampleur du gain n’a pas différé entre les groupes. Les RCUD pour la 
vie entière entre les soins chirurgicaux et non chirurgicaux ont été 7946 
$CA/QALY, 7104 $CA/QALY et 5098 $CA/QALY pour les cohortes SLD, arthrose du 
genou et de la hanche, respectivement. L’analyse de sous-groupes a généré un 
RCUD accru pour les patients atteints de SLD qui ont subi la décompression avec 
arthrodèse (9870 $CA/QALY) comparativement à la décompression seule (5045 
$CA/QALY). Le classement des RCUD par groupe n’a pas changé en fonction des 
analyses de sensibilité déterministes ou probabilistes.
CONCLUSION: Les RCUD pour la vie entière associés à la CME dans les cas de SLD 
sont similaires à ceux de l’arthroplastie totale. Les recherches futures 
devraient adopter une perspective sociétale et refléter davantage les bienfaits 
économiques de la CME.

BACKGROUND: Stimulated by the economic challenges faced by many sub-Saharan 
African countries and the changes in the rotavirus burden across these 
countries, this study aimed to inform the decision of health policy makers of 
eight sub-Saharan countries, who are yet to introduce the rotavirus vaccine as 
of Dec 31, 2020, on the health economic consequences of the introduction of the 
vaccine in terms of the costs and benefits.
METHODS: We did a cost-benefit analysis using a simulation-based 
decision-analytic model for children aged younger than 1 year, who were followed 
up to 259 weeks, in the Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Equatorial 
Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Somalia, and South Sudan. Data were collected and 
analysed between Jan 13, 2020, and Dec 11, 2020. Cost-effectiveness analysis and 
budget impact analysis were done as secondary analyses. Four rotavirus 
vaccinations (Rotarix, Rotateq, Rotavac, and Rotasiil) were compared with no 
vaccination. The primary outcome was disability-adjusted life-years averted, 
converted to monetary terms. The secondary outcomes include rotavirus 
gastroenteritis averted, and rotavirus vaccine-associated intussusception. The 
primary economic evaluation measure was the benefit-cost ratio (BCR).
FINDINGS: For the modelling period, Jan 1, 2021, to Dec 31, 2030, we found that 
the benefits of introducing the rotavirus vaccine outweighed the costs in all 
eight countries, with Chad and the Central African Republic having the highest 
BCR of 19·42 and 11·36, respectively. Guinea had the lowest BCR of 3·26 amongst 
the Gavi-eligible countries. Equatorial Guinea and Gabon had a narrow BCR of 
1·86 and 2·06, respectively. Rotarix was the optimal choice for all the 
Gavi-eligible countries; Rotasiil and Rotavac were the optimal choices for 
Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, respectively.
INTERPRETATION: Introducing the rotavirus vaccine in all eight countries, but 
with caution in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, would be worthwhile. With the 
narrow BCR for Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, cautious, pragmatic, and stringent 
measures need to be employed to ensure optimal health benefits and cost 
minimisation of the vaccine introduction. The final decision to introduce the 
rotavirus vaccine should be preceded by comparing its BCR to the BCRs of other 
health-care projects.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Preclinical ulcerative colitis is poorly defined. We aimed to 
characterize the preclinical systemic inflammation in ulcerative colitis, using 
a comprehensive set of proteins.
METHODS: We obtained plasma samples biobanked from individuals who developed 
ulcerative colitis later in life (n = 72) and matched healthy controls (n = 140) 
within a population-based screening cohort. We measured 92 proteins related to 
inflammation using a proximity extension assay. The biologic relevance of these 
findings was validated in an inception cohort of patients with ulcerative 
colitis (n = 101) and healthy controls (n = 50). To examine the influence of 
genetic and environmental factors on these markers, a cohort of healthy twin 
siblings of patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 41) and matched healthy 
controls (n = 37) were explored.
RESULTS: Six proteins (MMP10, CXCL9, CCL11, SLAMF1, CXCL11 and MCP-1) were 
up-regulated (P < .05) in preclinical ulcerative colitis compared with controls 
based on both univariate and multivariable models. Ingenuity Pathway Analyses 
identified several potential key regulators, including interleukin-1β, tumor 
necrosis factor, interferon-gamma, oncostatin M, nuclear factor-κB, 
interleukin-6, and interleukin-4. For validation, we built a multivariable model 
to predict disease in the inception cohort. The model discriminated 
treatment-naïve patients with ulcerative colitis from controls with 
leave-one-out cross-validation (area under the curve = 0.92). Consistently, 
MMP10, CXCL9, CXCL11, and MCP-1, but not CCL11 and SLAMF1, were significantly 
up-regulated among the healthy twin siblings, even though their relative 
abundances seemed higher in incident ulcerative colitis.
CONCLUSIONS: A set of inflammatory proteins are up-regulated several years 
before a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. These proteins were highly predictive 
of an ulcerative colitis diagnosis, and some seemed to be up-regulated already 
at exposure to genetic and environmental risk factors.

OBJECTIVE: Survival scoring systems for spine metastasis (SPM) were designed to 
help surgical practice. The authors sought to validate the prognostic accuracy 
of the main preoperative scoring systems for SPM.
METHODS: It was hypothesized that true patient survival in SPM was better than 
that predicted using prognosis scores. To investigate this hypothesis, the 
authors designed a French national retrospective study of a prospectively 
collected multicenter database involving 739 patients treated for SPM between 
2014 and 2017.
RESULTS: In this series, the median survival time for all patients from an SPM 
diagnosis was 17.03 ± 1.5 months. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated 
using the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC of Tomita's prognosis score was 
the lowest and poorest (0.4 ± 0.023, range 0.35-0.44), whereas the AUC of the 
Tokuhashi score was the highest (0.825). The Lei score presented an AUC of 0.686 
± 0.022 (range 0.64-0.7), and the Rades score showed a weaker AUC (0.583 ± 
0.020, range 0.54-0.63). Differences among AUCs were all statistically 
significant (p < 0.001). The modified Bauer score and the Rades score had the 
highest rate of agreement in predicting survival, with a weighted Cohen's kappa 
of 0.54 and 0.41, respectively, indicating a moderate agreement. The revised 
Tokuhashi and Lei scores had a fair rate of agreement (weighted Cohen's kappa = 
0.24 and 0.22, respectively). The van der Linden and Tomita scores demonstrated 
the worst performance, with only a "slight" rate of agreement (weighted Cohen's 
kappa = 0.19 and 0.16, respectively) between what was predicted and the actual 
survival.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of prognostic scoring systems in the estimation of survival 
in patients with SPM has become obsolete and therefore underestimates survival. 
Surgical treatment decisions should no longer be based on survival estimations 
alone but must also take into account patient symptoms, spinal instability, and 
quality of life.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness, from the 
perspective of the Australian public healthcare system, of icosapent ethyl in 
combination with statin therapy compared with statin alone for the prevention of 
cardiovascular disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model populated with data from the Reduction of 
Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial was designed to 
predict the effectiveness and costs of icosapent ethyl in combination with 
statins compared with statins alone over a 20-year time horizon. Data inputs for 
costs and utilities were sourced from published sources. The annual costs of 
icosapent ethyl were assumed to be AUD1637 (USD2907) per person. All future 
costs and outcomes were discounted annually by 5%. The main outcome of interest 
was incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in terms of cost per quality adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained and per year of life saved (YoLS). Over a 20-year time 
horizon, compared with statin alone, icosapent ethyl in combination with statin 
was estimated to cost an additional AUD$13,022 per person, but led to 0.338 YoLS 
and 0.289 QALYs gained (all discounted). These equated to incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of AUD45,036 per QALY gained and AUD38,480 per YoLS. 
Sub-analyses for primary and secondary prevention were AUD96,136 and AUD35,935 
per QALY gained, respectively. The results were sensitive to time-horizon, age 
related trends and the acquisition price of icosapent ethyl.
CONCLUSION: Compared with statin alone, icosapent ethyl in combination with 
statin therapy is likely to be cost-effective in the prevention of 
cardiovascular disease assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of AUD50,000 per 
QALY gained, especially in the secondary preventive setting.

Locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are often 
managed with surgery followed by postoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT). With the 
general increase in life expectancy, the proportion of elderly patients with 
HNSCC is expected to grow rapidly. Until now, a deeper understanding of specific 
management strategies for these patients in clinical routine was lacking. In the 
present study, we compared elderly patients (≥70 years, n = 52) and younger 
patients (n = 245) treated with postoperative RCT for HNSCC at our tertiary 
cancer center. All patients were irradiated with modern radiotherapy techniques 
(IMRT/VMAT). Patients ≥70 years of age had more comorbidities. Additionally, 
elderly patients less frequently received concomitant systemic treatment. The 
rates of mucositis and dermatitis were lower in patients ≥70 years. Elderly 
patients had significantly worse overall and progression-free survival. 
Locoregional and distant control were comparable in elderly and younger 
patients. In conclusion, postoperative RCT is a safe and effective treatment 
option in patients ≥70 years. In light of comorbidities and poor overall 
survival rates, benefits and harms of radiotherapy and concomitant systemic 
treatment should be weighed carefully. When exclusively applying up-to-date 
radiotherapy techniques with, at the same time, careful use of concomitant 
systemic therapy, favorable acute toxicity profiles are achieved.

Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant brain malignancy worldwide, with a 
10-year survival of only 0.7%. Aggressive multimodal treatment is not enough to 
increase life expectancy and provide good quality of life for glioblastoma 
patients. In addition, despite decades of research, there are no established 
biomarkers for early disease diagnosis and monitoring of patient response to 
treatment. High throughput sequencing technologies allow for the identification 
of unique molecules from large clinically annotated datasets. Thus, the aim of 
our study was to identify significant molecular changes between short- and 
long-term glioblastoma survivors by transcriptome RNA sequencing profiling, 
followed by differential pathway-activation-level analysis. We used data from 
the publicly available repositories The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; number of 
annotated cases = 135) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA; number of 
annotated cases = 218), and experimental clinically annotated glioblastoma 
tissue samples from the Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine in Ljubljana 
corresponding to 2-58 months overall survival (n = 16). We found one 
differential gene for long noncoding RNA CRNDE whose overexpression showed 
correlation to poor patient OS. Moreover, we identified overlapping sets of 
congruently regulated differential genes involved in cell growth, division, and 
migration, structure and dynamics of extracellular matrix, DNA methylation, and 
regulation through noncoding RNAs. Gene ontology analysis can provide additional 
information about the function of protein- and nonprotein-coding genes of 
interest and the processes in which they are involved. In the future, this can 
shape the design of more targeted therapeutic approaches.

BACKGROUND/AIM: We investigated the oncologic outcomes in elderly patients who 
underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric cancer (EGC) 
by focusing on the impact of comorbidities, sarcopenia, and nutritional status.
METHODS: Between 2005 and 2016, 280 patients aged ≥ 80 years with 289 EGCs 
underwent ESD at a tertiary care center. The short- and long-term survival 
outcomes were assessed. Cox regression analysis was used to identify factors 
associated with survival, including clinicopathologic factors and abdominal 
muscle area measured by computed tomography.
RESULTS: The rates of en bloc, R0, and, curative resection were 99.3%, 90.0%, 
and 69.2%, respectively. The rates of post-ESD bleeding and perforation rates 
were 2.1% and 3.1%, respectively, and no cases showed significant 
life-threatening adverse events. Over a median follow-up period of 70.5 months, 
the 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 89.5% and 77.1%, 
respectively; of the114 patients who died, only four (3.5%) were due to gastric 
cancer. A total of 173 (61.8%) had sarcopenia, and they had lower rates of 
3-year (88.4% vs. 91.4%) and 5-year (73.1% vs. 84.0%; p = 0.046) OS than did 
those without sarcopenia. In multivariable analyses, prognostic nutritional 
index (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90-0.98; p = 
0.002) and Charlson comorbidity index (HR 1.19; 95% CI: 1.03-1.37; p = 0.018) 
were significant factors associated with overall survival.
CONCLUSIONS: ESD was a feasible and safe therapeutic method to use in elderly 
patients, whose long-term survival was significantly associated with nutritional 
status and comorbidities. These results suggest the need for a possible 
extension of the curative criteria for ESD in elderly patients with EGC.

Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) results from autoimmune destruction of insulin producing 
pancreatic ß-cells. This disease, with a peak incidence in childhood, causes the 
lifelong need for insulin injections and necessitates careful monitoring of 
blood glucose levels. However, despite the current insulin therapies, it still 
shortens life expectancy due to complications affecting multiple organs. 
Recently, the incidence of T1D in childhood has increased by 3-5% per year in 
most developed Western countries. The heterogeneity of the disease process is 
supported by the findings of follow-up studies started early in infancy. The 
development of T1D is usually preceded by the appearance of autoantibodies 
targeted against antigens expressed in the pancreatic islets. The risk of T1D 
increases significantly with an increasing number of positive autoantibodies. 
The order of autoantibody appearance affects the disease risk. Genetic 
susceptibility, mainly defined by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II 
gene region and environmental factors, is important in the development of islet 
autoimmunity and T1D. Environmental factors, mainly those linked to the changes 
in the gut microbiome as well as several pathogens, especially viruses, and diet 
are key modulators of T1D. The aim of this paper is to expand the understanding 
of the aetiology and pathogenesis of T1D in childhood by detailed description 
and comparison of factors affecting the progression from the islet autoimmunity 
to T1D in children.

The recent advances in deciphering the human genome allow us to understand and 
evaluate the mechanisms of human genome age-associated transformations, which 
are largely unclear. Genome sequencing techniques assure comprehensive mapping 
of human genetics; however, understanding of gene functional interactions, 
specifically of time/age-dependent modifications, remain challenging. The age of 
the genome is defined by the sum of individual (inherited) and acquired genomic 
traits, based on internal and external factors that impact ontogenesis from the 
moment of egg fertilization and embryonic development. The biological part of 
genomic age opens a new perspective for intervention. The discovery of single 
cell-based mechanisms for genetic change indicates the possibility of 
influencing aging and associated disease burden, as well as metabolism. Cell 
populations with transformed genetic background were shown to serve as the 
origin of common diseases during extended life expectancy (superaging). 
Consequently, age-related cell transformation leads to cancer and cell 
degeneration (senescence). This article aims to describe current advances in the 
genomic mechanisms of senescence and its role in the spatiotemporal spread of 
epithelial clones and cell evolution.

Population development is reflected by sustainable development indicators, among 
them are the indicators describing longevity and healthy aging. Longevity is 
reflected by life expectancy, and healthy aging is reflected by healthy life 
expectancy; high values of these indicators reflect good conditions of living 
for people. Life expectancy and healthy life expectancy analyses are of big 
interest among academics, policymakers, medical researchers, and others in order 
to direct the flow of funds in the most effective way possible to the population 
groups in most need. High life expectancy and low birth rate will lead to aging 
of the population, having profound implications on the school age population, 
politics, healthcare, labor force, social protection, social security issues, 
and public finances. Healthy life expectancy reflects health conditions, 
including the impacts of mortality and morbidity. As cardiovascular disease 
causes more than half of all deaths across Europe, this paper examines the 
influence of cardiovascular disease on longevity and healthy aging across 
Europe. The methodology was chosen so as to test the research hypotheses: (a) 
principal component analysis provided the socio-economic factors that are 
correlated to longevity and healthy aging; (b) regression analysis identified 
the relationship between healthy aging and cardiovascular disease; and (c) 
hierarchical cluster analysis allowed us to find common features of the groups 
of countries according to healthy aging and longevity.

Fitness centres are an obvious arena for performing physical activity for the 
general population but representation of adults with physical disabilities 
(AwPD) is lacking. To increase possibilities for AwPD to exercise in fitness 
centres together with adults without physical disabilities (AwoPD), the aim of 
this study was to identify, synthesise, and compare barriers to, and 
facilitators of, exercising in fitness centres for each group. A scoping review 
was conducted and data extraction of the barriers and facilitators was performed 
independently by two researchers on six categories of contextual factors based 
on the framework of Di Blasi: (1) The fitness centre setting; (2) The fitness 
centre user characteristics; (3) The fitness instructor/staff characteristics; 
(4) The fitness centre user-instructor/management relationship; and (5) The 
fitness/exercise characteristics. An extra category, (6) Other relationships, 
was added. The PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews was used for reporting. Of 
the 102 included papers, only 26 (25%) of the papers were on AwPD, which focused 
mainly on physical barriers (category 1: inaccessible settings). In contrast, 
the remaining 76 papers involving AwoPD focused primarily on facilitators 
(category 2: motivational factors and exercising effects). In categories 3-6, 
the two groups had similar results, as both groups preferred skilled 
instructors, a welcoming and comfortable fitness centre environment, an ability 
to exercise at their preferred type and level, and good social connections. 
Since most data were based on AwoPD, more studies on actual experiences from 
AwPD are needed, to reveal the facilitators/motivational factors for fitness 
centre use.

The outbreak of the novel COVID-19, declared a global pandemic by WHO, is the 
most serious public health threat seen in terms of respiratory viruses since the 
1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. It is surprising that the total number of COVID-19 
confirmed cases and the number of deaths has varied greatly across countries. 
Such great variations are caused by age population, health conditions, travel, 
economy, and environmental factors. Here, we investigated which national factors 
(life expectancy, aging index, human development index, percentage of 
malnourished people in the population, extreme poverty, economic ability, health 
policy, population, age distributions, etc.) influenced the spread of COVID-19 
through systematic statistical analysis. First, we employed segmented growth 
curve models (GCMs) to model the cumulative confirmed cases for 134 countries 
from 1 January to 31 August 2020 (logistic and Gompertz). Thus, each country's 
COVID-19 spread pattern was summarized into three growth-curve model parameters. 
Secondly, we investigated the relationship of selected 31 national factors (from 
KOSIS and Our World in Data) to these GCM parameters. Our analysis showed that 
with time, the parameters were influenced by different factors; for example, the 
parameter related to the maximum number of predicted cumulative confirmed cases 
was greatly influenced by the total population size, as expected. The other 
parameter related to the rate of spread of COVID-19 was influenced by aging 
index, cardiovascular death rate, extreme poverty, median age, percentage of 
population aged 65 or 70 and older, and so forth. We hope that with their 
consideration of a country's resources and population dynamics that our results 
will help in making informed decisions with the most impact against similar 
infectious diseases.

In November 2020, Brazil ranked third in the number of cases of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) and second in the number of deaths due to the disease. 
We carried out a descriptive study of deaths, mortality rate, years of potential 
life lost (YPLL) and excess mortality due to COVID-19, based on SARS-CoV-2 
records in SIVEP-Gripe (Ministry of Health of Brazil) from 16 February 2020, to 
1 January 2021. In this period, there were 98,025 deaths from COVID-19 in 
Brazil. Men accounted for 60.5% of the estimated 1.2 million YPLLs. High YPLL 
averages showed prematurity of deaths. The population aged 45-64 years (both 
sexes) represented more than 50% of all YPLLs. Risk factors were present in 
69.5% of deaths, with heart disease, diabetes and obesity representing the most 
prevalent comorbidities in both sexes. Indigenous people had the lowest number 
of deaths and the highest average YPLL. However, in indigenous people, pregnant 
women and mothers had an average YPLL of over 35 years. The excess mortality for 
Brazil was estimated at 122,914 deaths (9.2%). The results show that the social 
impacts of YPLL due to COVID-19 are different depending on gender, race and risk 
factors. YPLL and excess mortality can be used to guide the prioritization of 
health interventions, such as prioritization of vaccination, lockdowns, or 
distribution of facial masks for the most vulnerable populations.

BACKGROUND: To investigate whether physical performance is independently of 
physical activity (PA) associated with positive and negative dimensions of 
mental well-being in middle-aged women.
METHODS: Data were drawn from the Estrogenic Regulation of Muscle Apoptosis 
(ERMA) study in which women 47 to 55 years were randomly selected from the 
Finnish National Registry. They (n = 909) participated in measurements of 
physical performance (handgrip force, knee extension force, vertical jumping 
height, maximal walking speed, and six-minute walking distance). Both mental 
well-being (the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the 
International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form and the 
Satisfaction with Life Scale) and PA were self-reported. Associations between 
variables were analysed using multivariate linear regression modelling adjusted 
for body height, fat mass %, menopausal status and symptoms, marital status, 
parity, employment status, self-reported mental disorders, and use of 
psycholeptics and psychoanaleptics. PA was then entered into a separate model to 
explore its role in the associations.
RESULTS: In the adjusted models, significant positive associations of six-minute 
walking distance with positive affectivity (B = 0.12, p = 0.002) and life 
satisfaction (B = 0.15, p = 0.033) were observed. No significant associations 
were observed between physical performance and depressive symptoms or negative 
affectivity. PA was positively associated with positive affectivity and life 
satisfaction and negatively with depressive symptoms across all the physical 
performance variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Of the physical performance dimensions, aerobic component was 
associated with positive mental well-being independently of PA level. In 
relation to other physical performance components, the results point to the 
benefits of physical activity for mental well-being.

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Healing abutments and attachments have been used for 
implant-supported removable partial dentures (ISRPDs). However, the effects of 
these abutments and attachments on the clinical outcomes of the implants and 
prostheses are elusive because of the lack of standardized research protocols.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the clinical 
outcomes of mandibular distal extension ISRPDs with healing abutments and 
attachments by analyzing qualified studies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic and manual literature search was conducted 
on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases 
including articles published in English from 1980 to 2020. Publications of 
clinical outcome studies on the mandibular distal extension ISRPDs with healing 
abutments or attachments were screened by inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Clinical outcomes of removable partial dentures (RPDs) and ISRPDs with different 
types of abutments or attachments were compared by using patient-reported 
outcome measures, implant survival rate, masticatory performance, and implant- 
or prosthesis-related complications. Study designs and clinical outcome data 
were extracted and analyzed. The evidence of the selected studies and degree of 
recommendation were made according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based 
Medicine, and the risk of bias of the studies was assessed based on 
Newcastle-Ottawa criteria.
RESULTS: Of 541 articles initially identified after removing duplicate records, 
11 articles were selected by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, by 
inter-viewer agreement, and by hand searching. Nine prospective cohort studies, 
1 retrospective cohort study, and 1 randomized controlled trial were included 
with evidence levels assessed at 1b, 2b, and 2c. The risk of bias varied from 5 
to 8 out of 9. Patient overall satisfaction, oral health-related quality of life 
(OHRQoL) scores, and masticatory ability were significantly improved for ISRPDs 
with either healing abutments, ball, or LOCATOR attachments when compared with 
RPDs. The implant survival rate varied from 92% to 97% at 2 to 10 years for ball 
attachment and was 100% at 1 year for LOCATOR attachment-supported ISRPDs. 
Marginal bone loss (MBL) varied from 0 to 1 mm in all studies, although LOCATOR 
attachments had significantly less MBL compared with ball attachments. The 
maximal pocket depth and bleeding on probing index around implants at 1 year 
were 1.7 to 1.8 mm and 0.1 to 0.3. Loose healing caps were the main mechanical 
complication of implants. There were more prosthetic complications in ISRPDs 
with ball attachments than RPDs at 10-year follow-up, including gold matrix 
loosening, loss of retention, and denture base fractures. No direct comparisons 
were made of patient-reported outcomes or prosthetic complications between ball 
and LOCATOR attachment-supported ISRPDs.
CONCLUSIONS: Healing abutments and attachments (ball or LOCATOR) improved 
patient-reported outcomes and the masticatory function of mandibular distal 
extension ISRPDs. However, insufficient evidence was found to determine the 
relative effectiveness of different attachment systems on the clinical outcomes 
of mandibular distal extension ISRPDs. Abutment loosening was the most frequent 
mechanical complication for healing abutments. More prosthetic complications 
were associated with ball attachment-supported ISRPDs than RPDs. The major 
weaknesses of this systematic review were the relatively moderate level of 
evidence and the publication language, since implant attachments are used in 
many non-English speaking countries.

The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa explores surfaces using 
twitching motility powered by retractile extracellular filaments called type IV 
pili (T4P). Single cells twitch by sequential T4P extension, attachment, and 
retraction. How single cells coordinate T4P to efficiently navigate surfaces 
remains unclear. We demonstrate that P. aeruginosa actively directs twitching in 
the direction of mechanical input from T4P in a process called mechanotaxis. The 
Chp chemotaxis-like system controls the balance of forward and reverse twitching 
migration of single cells in response to the mechanical signal. Collisions 
between twitching cells stimulate reversals, but Chp mutants either always or 
never reverse. As a result, while wild-type cells colonize surfaces uniformly, 
collision-blind Chp mutants jam, demonstrating a function for mechanosensing in 
regulating group behavior. On surfaces, Chp senses T4P attachment at one pole, 
thereby sensing a spatially resolved signal. As a result, the Chp response 
regulators PilG and PilH control the polarization of the extension motor PilB. 
PilG stimulates polarization favoring forward migration, while PilH inhibits 
polarization, inducing reversal. Subcellular segregation of PilG and PilH 
efficiently orchestrates their antagonistic functions, ultimately enabling rapid 
reversals upon perturbations. The distinct localization of response regulators 
establishes a signaling landscape known as local excitation-global inhibition in 
higher-order organisms, identifying a conserved strategy to transduce spatially 
resolved signals.
