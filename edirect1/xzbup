Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder that affects over 5 million people 
worldwide. Current maintenance therapy has been successful in reducing 
complications and enhancing life expectancy; yet subclinical complications 
persist. To date, allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) remains 
the only available curative therapy for sickle cell disease. With declining 
incidences of rejection and transplant- related mortality, disease-free survival 
after human leucocyte antigen-identical sibling transplant exceeds 90%. However, 
the majority of individuals with sickle cell disease do not have an human 
leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling; therefore, research is expanding to 
focus on new approaches to alternative donor transplant. Advances in supportive 
care and conditioning regimens have led to expansion of the pool of donors to 
unrelated donors and haploidentical donors. Challenges remain in improving the 
safety and efficacy of HSCT from alternate donors. Early results from gene 
therapy may provide another curative option in patients with sickle cell 
disease. These approaches show early promise, but larger, longitudinal studies 
are needed to better determine the optimal clinical circumstances for transplant 
in sickle cell disease.

Acceptance, Usability and Health Applications of Virtual Worlds by Older Adults: 
A Feasibility Study.

Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, FL, United States. nc570@nova.edu.

BACKGROUND: Virtual worlds allow users to communicate and interact across 
various environments, scenarios, and platforms. Virtual worlds present 
opportunities in health care to reduce the burden of illness and disability by 
supporting education, rehabilitation, self-management, and social networking. 
The application of virtual worlds to older adults who bear the burden and cost 
of health conditions associated with age has not been evaluated.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the usability, ease of use, and 
enjoyment of a virtual world by older adults, the types of virtual world 
activities that older adults may engage in, and the perceptions of older adults 
regarding the application of virtual worlds in health care.
METHODS: This quasi-experimental pre-post design research was guided by the 
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Participants were recruited from a Lifelong 
Learning Institute (LLI) program at Nova Southeastern University. Participants 
attended four training sessions over a 5-week period in the Second Life (SL) 
virtual world. Subjects were surveyed before and after the training on perceived 
ease of use, attitudes towards technology, behavioral intention to use the 
system, facilitating conditions, effort expectancy, and self-efficacy.
RESULTS: Older adults (N=19) completed the informed consent and attended the 
first training session, and 11 participants (58%, 11/19) completed the full 
training and the post survey. Completers (82%, 9/11) were more likely than 
non-completers (37%, 3/8) to consider themselves technologically savvy (P=.048), 
and to express confidence in being able to use the virtual world (100%, 11/11 vs 
37%, 3/8; P=.002). All completers (100%, 11/11) perceived that SL has 
application in health behaviors and disease and reducing social isolation among 
people who are homebound. Of the completers, 10 (91%, 10/11) responded that they 
enjoyed learning how to use SL. Completers suggested that future trainings 
include more assistants and smaller groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that virtual worlds can be both a 
feasible and an applicable method to promote health among some seniors. Future 
research on virtual worlds with older populations should consider using 
state-of-the art technology including large monitors, providing a minimum of one 
trainer for every two to three participants, and distributing a comprehensive 
training manual at the start of the training to support organization and recall.

London, London, UK.

Analysis of healthy life expectancy is typically based on a binary distinction 
between health and ill-health. By contrast, this paper considers spatial 
modelling of disease free life expectancy taking account of the number of 
chronic conditions. Thus the analysis is based on population sub-groups with no 
disease, those with one disease only, and those with two or more diseases 
(multiple morbidity). Data on health status is accordingly modelled using a 
multinomial likelihood. The analysis uses data for 258 small areas in north 
London, and shows wide differences in the disease burden related to multiple 
morbidity. Strong associations between area socioeconomic deprivation and 
multiple morbidity are demonstrated, as well as strong spatial clustering.

Mounting evidence suggests that population endpoints in risk assessment are far 
more accurate than static assessments. Complete demographic toxicity data based 
on full life tables are eminently useful in predicting population outcomes in 
many applications because they capture both lethal and sublethal effects; 
however, developing these life tables is extremely costly. In this study we 
investigated the efficiency of partial life cycle tests as a substitute for full 
life cycles in parameterizing population models. Life table data were developed 
for three species of Daphniids, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia magna, and D. pulex, 
weekly throughout the life span of these species. Population growth rates (λ) 
and a series of other demographic parameters generated from the complete life 
cycle were compared to those calculated from cumulative weeks of the life cycle 
in order to determine the minimum number of weeks needed to generate an accurate 
population projection. Results showed that for C. dubia and D. pulex, λ values 
developed at >4 weeks (44.4% of the life cycle) were not significantly different 
from λ developed for the full life cycle (9 weeks) of each species. For D. 
magna, λ values developed at >7 weeks (70% of the life cycle) were not 
significantly different from λ developed for the full life cycle (10 weeks). 
Furthermore, these cutoff points for λ were not the same for other demographic 
parameters, with no clear pattern emerging. Our results indicate that for C. 
dubia, D. magna, and D. pulex, partial life tables can be used to generate 
population growth rates in lieu of full life tables. However, the implications 
of differences in cutoff points for different demographic parameters need to be 
investigated further.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare long-term prognosis after 
meningioma surgery in elderly and younger patients as well as to compare 
survival of elderly patients with surgically treated meningioma to survival 
rates for the general population. METHODS Five hundred meningioma patients 
(median follow-up 90 months) who underwent surgery between 1994 and 2009 were 
subdivided into "elderly" (age ≥ 65 years, n = 162) and "younger" (age < 65 
years, n = 338) groups for uni- and multivariate analyses. Mortality was 
compared with rates for the age- and sex-matched general population. RESULTS The 
median age at diagnosis was 71 in the elderly group and 51 years in the younger 
group. Sex, intracranial tumor location, grade of resection, radiotherapy, and 
histopathological subtypes were similar in the 2 groups. High-grade (WHO Grades 
II and III) and spinal tumors were more common in older patients than in younger 
patients (15% vs 8%, p = 0.017, and 12% vs 4%, p = 0.001, respectively). The 
progression-free interval (PFI) was similar in the 2 groups, whereas mortality 
at 3 months after surgery was higher and median overall survival (OS) was 
shorter in older patients (7%, 191 months) than in younger patients (1%, median 
not reached; HR 4.9, 95% CI 2.75-8.74; p < 0.001). Otherwise, the median OS in 
elderly patients did not differ from the anticipated general life expectancy (HR 
1.03, 95% CI 0.70-1.50; p = 0.886). Within the older patient group, PFI was 
lower in patients with high-grade meningiomas (HR 24.74, 95% CI 4.23-144.66; p < 
0.001) and after subtotal resection (HR 10.57, 95% CI 2.23-50.05; p = 0.003). 
Although extent of resection was independent of perioperative mortality, the 
median OS was longer after gross-total resection than after subtotal resection 
(HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.09-6.69; p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS Elderly patients with 
surgically treated meningioma do not suffer from impaired survival compared with 
the age-matched general population, and their PFI is similar to that of younger 
meningioma patients. These data help mitigate fears concerning surgical 
treatment of elderly patients in an aging society.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, an overview of the main characteristics of 
the anaphylaxis in the elderly, a subset of the population with particular 
clinical and physiological features that might influence the presentation and 
management of this entity, is performed.
RECENT FINDINGS: Life expectancy of the population is increasing and so is the 
prevalence of allergic diseases in the elderly, including anaphylaxis. Older 
people present higher risk of fatalities after anaphylaxis, and some 
comorbidities and pharmacological treatments they may use might also increase 
that risk.
SUMMARY: Recognition of the main triggers, the risk factors, and the wide 
variety of presenting symptoms of anaphylaxis is therefore helpful in its 
management, as well as a prompt initiation of the treatment and a complete 
follow-up.

Coplanar extended-field intensity-modulated radiation therapy (EF-IMRT) 
targeting the whole-pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes in patients with advanced 
cervical cancer results in impaired creatinine clearance. An improvement in 
renal function cannot be expected unless low-dose (approximately 10 Gy) kidney 
exposure is reduced. The dosimetric method should be considered during EF-IMRT 
planning to further reduce low-dose exposure to the kidneys. To assess the 
usefulness of non-coplanar EF-IMRT with kidney-avoiding beams to spare the 
kidneys during cervical carcinoma treatment in dosimetric analysis between 
non-coplanar and coplanar EF-IMRT, we compared the doses of the target organ and 
organs at risk, including the kidney, in 10 consecutive patients. To estimate 
the influence of EFRT on renal dysfunction, creatinine clearance values after 
treatment were also examined in 18 consecutive patients. Of these 18 patients, 
10 patients who were included in the dosimetric analysis underwent extended 
field radiation therapy (EFRT) with concurrent chemotherapy, and eight patients 
underwent whole-pelvis radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy to treat 
cervical carcinoma between April 2012 and March 2015 at our institution. In the 
dosimetric analysis, non-coplanar EF-IMRT was effective at reducing low-dose 
(approximately 10 Gy) exposure to the kidneys, thus maintaining target coverage 
and sparing other organs at risk, such as the small bowel, rectum, and bladder, 
compared with coplanar EF-IMRT. Renal function in all 10 patients who underwent 
EFRT, including coplanar EF-IMRT (with kidney irradiation), was low after 
treatment, and differed significantly from that of the eight patients who 
underwent WPRT (no kidney irradiation) 6 months after the first day of treatment 
(P = 0.005). In conclusion, non-coplanar EF-IMRT should be considered in 
patients with advanced cervical cancer, particularly in patients with a long 
life expectancy or with pre-existing renal dysfunction.

Stress has been implicated as a risk factor for the severity and progression of 
sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early life experiences determine stress 
responsivity in later life, and modulate age-dependent cognitive decline. 
Therefore, we examined whether early life experiences influence AD outcome in a 
bigenic mouse model which progressively develops combined tau and amyloid 
pathology (biAT mice).Mice were subjected to either early life stress (ELS) or 
to 'positive' early handling (EH) postnatally (from day 2 to 9). In biAT mice, 
ELS significantly compromised long term survival, in contrast to EH which 
increased life expectancy. In 4 month old mice, ELS-reared biAT mice displayed 
increased hippocampal Aβ levels, while these levels were reduced in EH-reared 
biAT mice. No effects of ELS or EH were observed on the brain levels of APP, 
protein tau, or PSD-95. Dendritic morphology was moderately affected after ELS 
and EH in the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex, while object recognition 
memory and open field performance were not affected. We conclude that despite 
the strong transgenic background, early life experiences significantly modulate 
the life expectancy of biAT mice. Parallel changes in hippocampal Aβ levels were 
evident, without affecting cognition of young adult biAT mice.

This article presents two cases of young women with spontaneous life-threatening 
bleeding events. Both had a history of gastrointestinal rupture or arterial 
dissection. Based on their medical history and genetic testing, Ehlers-Danlos 
syndrome (EDS) IV (vascular type) was diagnosed. In this very rare disorder 
which accounts for only 5 % of all EDS cases, fibroblasts synthesize reduced and 
abnormal procollagen type III. This is caused by mutations in the COL3A1 gene 
coding for type III procollagen. Life expectancy in these patients is 
significantly reduced. In many cases spontaneous arterial ruptures or 
dissections and organ ruptures are the first manifestations of this disease. 
More than 80 % of patients with EDS IV suffer from a severe complication before 
40 years of age. Treatment options are very limited. Most important is to avoid 
invasive procedures (open surgery as well as endovascular interventions) because 
of its high morbidity and mortality. Celiprolol, a cardioselective β‑blocker, 
seems to have a beneficial effect by reducing the incidence of vascular 
complications.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a rare chronically debilitating disease. 
There are few reports on the burden of disease of MS and prevalence in China. 
The authors intended to estimate disease burden and prevalence of MS in Shandong 
Province using available epidemiologic data.
METHODS: Prevalence was calculated using DISMOD II software based on incidence 
extrapolated from hospitalization data, case fatality and remission rate from 
literature as input indexes. Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) was computed 
with epidemiologic indexes estimated by DISMOD II program.
RESULTS: The prevalence of MS was estimated to be 3.7(95 % CI: 1.65-5.8) and 
6.7(95 % CI: 2.7-9.56) cases per 100,000 people for males and for females, 
respectively. The mean age at onset of MS was 36.0(43.0 ± 30.0 years in males 
and 33.7(43.4 ± 29.7) years in females. Duration of the disease was estimated to 
be 34.0 (31.6 ± 21.0) years for males and 39.5(34.9 ± 21.8) years for females. 
The disease burden in disability-adjusted life years was 3316, comprised of 903 
(27.2 %) years of life lost (YLL) and 2413 (72.8 %) years lived with disability 
(YLD).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlighted that population in Shandong Province had a 
high prevalence of MS and the patients had a heavy disease burden. It also 
revealed that the results obtained in this paper would be useful to provide a 
reference for establishing specific healthcare policies for this rare disease in 
Shandong Province.

Processes of Personality Development in Adulthood: The TESSERA Framework.

Wrzus C(1), Roberts BW(2).

Author information:

(2)2 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA.

The current article presents a theoretical framework of the short- and long-term 
processes underlying personality development throughout adulthood. The newly 
developed TESSERA framework posits that long-term personality development occurs 
due to repeated short-term, situational processes. These short-term processes 
can be generalized as recursive sequence of Triggering situations, Expectancy, 
States/State expressions, and Reactions (TESSERA). Reflective and associative 
processes on TESSERA sequences can lead to personality development (i.e., 
continuity and lasting changes in explicit and implicit personality 
characteristics and behavioral patterns). We illustrate how the TESSERA 
framework facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of normative and 
differential personality development at various ages during the life span. The 
TESSERA framework extends previous theories by explicitly linking short- and 
long-term processes of personality development, by addressing different 
manifestations of personality, and by being applicable to different personality 
characteristics, for example, behavioral traits, motivational orientations, or 
life narratives.

OBJECTIVES: To assess frequency of gallbladder polyposis and carcinoma in 
metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD).
METHODS: We evaluated 34 patients with MLD (average age 16.7 years, age range 
2-39 years) screened for gallbladder abnormalities by ultrasound. In the case of 
cholecystectomy, findings at pathology were reviewed.
RESULTS: Only 8 of 34 patients (23%) had a normal gallbladder at ultrasound. 
Gallbladder polyps were visible in 8 patients (23%). Cholecystectomy was 
performed in 11 patients (32%). In these, pathology revealed various 
abnormalities, including hyperplastic polyps, intestinal metaplasia, prominent 
Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, and sulfatide storage.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that gallbladder involvement is the rule 
rather than the exception in MLD. The high prevalence of hyperplastic polyps, a 
known precancerous condition, and one death from gallbladder carcinoma at a 
young age suggest that MLD predisposes to neoplastic gallbladder abnormalities. 
As novel therapies for this patient group are emerging leading to increased life 
expectancy, we recommend screening for gallbladder abnormalities by ultrasound 
in order to prevent early death.

PURPOSE: Although controversial, bariatric surgery is increasingly being 
performed in adolescents. We developed a model to simulate the effect of timing 
of gastric bypass in obese adolescents on quantity and quality of life.
METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was constructed comparing two treatment 
strategies: gastric bypass surgery at age 16 versus delayed surgery in 
adulthood. The model simulated a hypothetical cohort of adolescents with body 
mass index of 45kg/m(2). Model inputs were derived from current literature. The 
main outcome measure was quality and quantity of life, measured using 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: For females, early gastric bypass surgery was favored by 2.02 QALYs 
compared to delaying surgery until age 35 (48.91 vs. 46.89 QALYs). The benefit 
was even greater for males, where early surgery was favored by 2.9 QALYs (48.30 
vs. 45.40 QALYs). The absolute benefit of surgery at age 16 increased; the later 
surgery was delayed into adulthood. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that adult 
surgery was favored only when the values for adverse events were unrealistically 
high.
CONCLUSIONS: In our model, early gastric bypass in obese adolescents improved 
both quality and quantity of life. These findings are useful for surgeons and 
pediatricians when counseling adolescents considering weight loss surgery.

Formaldehyde and formic acid are reactive impurities found in commonly used 
excipients and can be responsible for limiting drug product shelf-life. 
Described here is the use of activated carbon in drug product packaging to 
attenuate formaldehyde-induced and formic acid-induced drug degradation in 
tablets and cross-linking in hard gelatin capsules. Several pharmaceutical 
products with known or potential vulnerabilities to formaldehyde-induced or 
formic acid-induced degradation or gelatin cross-linking were subjected to 
accelerated stability challenges in the presence and absence of activated 
carbon. The effects of time and storage conditions were determined. For all of 
the products studied, activated carbon attenuated drug degradation or gelatin 
cross-linking. This novel use of activated carbon in pharmaceutical packaging 
may be useful for enhancing the chemical stability of drug products or the 
dissolution stability of gelatin-containing dosage forms and may allow for the 
1) extension of a drug product's shelf-life when the limiting attribute is a 
degradation product induced by a reactive impurity, 2) marketing of a drug 
product in hotter and more humid climatic zones than currently supported without 
the use of activated carbon, and 3) enhanced dissolution stability of products 
that are vulnerable to gelatin cross-linking.

BACKGROUND: Partial ileal bypass (PIB) in the National Institutes of 
Health-sponsored Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias (POSCH) 
randomized controlled trial was found to reduce plasma cholesterol, in 
particular low density lipoprotein cholesterol, with concomitant retardation of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and increased life expectancy. 
Glucagon-like peptide-1, related to amelioration of type 2 diabetes, is 
increased over 5-fold after PIB. We hypothesized that PIB, in addition to its 
action on cholesterol metabolism, may also prevent type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: We surveyed by telephone inquiry of former POSCH patients the 30+year 
posttrial incidence of type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, the presence of which was 
a trial exclusion criteria. We were able to contact 17.4% (n = 838) of the 
original POSCH population.
RESULTS: Of 66 control responders, 17 contracted type 2 diabetes (25.8%); of 80 
PIB responders, 8 contracted type 2 diabetes (10%). The difference between 
groups was significant (P = .015 by Fisher exact test) with an odds ratio of 
.320 for the PIB group and an over 2-fold (2.6) increase in the incidence of 
type 2 diabetes in the controls. Including borderline type 2 diabetes 
(prediabetic) patients, these values were 22 of 66 controls (33.3%) and 10 of 80 
PIB patients (12.5%), with an odds ratio of .286 and a P<.004, and again an over 
2-fold (2.7) increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in the control 
patients.
CONCLUSION: PIB appears to afford partial protection from the onset of type 2 
diabetes for over 30 years.

BACKGROUND: The TRA 2°P-TIMI 50 trial showed the addition of vorapaxar to 
standard care (SC) antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined risk of death, 
myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, while exhibiting an increase in 
moderate, but not other bleeding events.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the long-term health benefits and risks 
of vorapaxar as an add-on to SC treatment (lifetime aspirin and up to 12 months 
of clopidogrel) for patients with a prior MI and without a history of 
cerebrovascular disease.
METHODS: In the state transition model we developed, the patients transition 
between states due to recurrent MI, stroke, or death, and are at risk of 
non-fatal bleeding. Risk equations were developed from individual patient-level 
data from the TRA 2°P-TIMI 50 trial to predict long-term cardiovascular (CV) 
outcomes. Additional sources informed inputs for case fatality, bleeding rates 
on SC, risk of non-CV death, and utilities.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, fewer CV events and more bleeding events 
occurred in the vorapaxar (VOR) + SC arm, relative to the SC-only arm. These 
results were ultimately accompanied by an increase in life expectancy and health 
benefits associated with add-on vorapaxar treatment, as the VOR + SC arm yielded 
an average of 8.27 discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with 
an average of 7.96 discounted QALYs in the SC-only arm.
CONCLUSION: This model framework leveraged novel risk equations to make 
long-term projections of CV events in a population at high risk of recurrence. 
Model results suggest vorapaxar is most effective as add-on therapy to SC 
antiplatelet treatment when initiated upon hospital discharge post-MI.

Treatment options for most nervous system tumors remain limited and patients are 
often confronted with significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy. 
However, significant efforts are underway to find more effective therapies for 
patients with primary and secondary brain tumors. As more and more clinical 
trials for nervous system tumors are being conducted, it is increasingly 
important to optimize the conduct of clinical trials in neuro-oncology. One of 
the key aspects in this regard is the development of objective and standardized 
criteria that allow for accurate response assessment in clinical trials and 
prevent the misclassification of responders and non-responders. Such 
misclassification may lead to premature discontinuation of an actually effective 
agent, thereby withholding a potentially active treatment from the patient. 
Conversely, patients may be inappropriately continued on an inactive treatment. 
Moreover, such misclassification may confound the data obtained in such studies 
and may lead to false conclusions with regards to the efficacy of the 
investigated drug. Therefore, reliable response assessment criteria are 
necessary that not only accurately capture radiographic changes but also account 
for treatment-related changes and incorporate the assessment of clinical status 
and quality of life (QoL). The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) 
working group is an international collaboration of neuro-oncologists, medical 
oncologists, radiation oncologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, and 
regulatory groups (among others) commissioned to develop objective and 
tumor-specific response criteria for various tumor subtypes. This article 
reviews the currently available response criteria for high-grade glioma, 
low-grade glioma, and brain metastases and discusses some of the barriers to 
accurate assessment of treatment response in neuro-oncology.

HOOS was developed as an extension of the Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities' Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire for measuring symptoms and 
functional limitations related to the hip(s) of patients with osteoarthritis. To 
determine the validity and reliability of the Thai version of the Hip disability 
and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) vis-à-vis hip osteoarthritis, the 
original HOOS was translated into a Thai version of HOOS, according to 
international recommendations. Patients with hip osteoarthritis (n = 57; 25 
males) were asked to complete the Thai version of HOOS twice: once then again 
after a 3-week interval. The test-retest reliability was analyzed using the 
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Internal consistencies were analyzed 
using Cronbach's alpha, while the construct validity was tested by comparing the 
Thai HOOS with the Thai modified SF-36 and calculating the Spearman's rank 
correlation coefficients. The Thai HOOS produced good reliability (i.e., the ICC 
was greater than 0.9 in all five subscales). All of the Cronbach's alpha showed 
that the Thai HOOS had high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha greater than 
0.8), especially for the pain and ADL subscales (0.89 and 0.90, respectively). 
The Spearman's rank correlation for all five subscales of the Thai HOOS had 
moderate correlation with the Bodily Pain subscale of the Thai SF-36. The pain 
subscale of the Thai HOOS had a high correlation with the Vitality and Social 
Function subscales of the Thai SF-36 (r = 0.55 and 0.54)-with which the symptom 
subscale had a moderate correlation. The Thai version of HOOS had excellent 
internal consistency, excellent test-retest reliability, and good construct 
validity. It can be used as a reliable tool for assessing quality of life for 
patients with hip osteoarthritis in Thailand.

INTRODUCTION: Renal transplantation provides longer life expectancy in patients 
with renal failure. Nonetheless, this improved life expectancy is still shorter 
than that for the general population. The main couse of death in renal 
transplant patients is cardiovascular disease, and chronic allograft nephropathy 
is the most significant cause of graft loss. Genetic polymorphisms of the renin 
angiotensin system have been implicated in both chronic allograft nephropathy 
and fatal cardiovascular diseases.
AIM: The long term goal of the authors was to improve the survival of renal 
transplanted patients. The authors aimed to identify novel biomarkers which 
correlate with the survival of the transplant organ and the recipient with a 
special attention to elements of the renin-angiotensin system.
METHOD: A retrospective clinical trial was performed involving 72 renal 
transplanted patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme I/D genotypes and activity, 
kidney function and morphological properties of the heart were determined.
RESULTS: A significant positive correlation was found between the DD genotype of 
the angiotensin-converting enzíme gene, and the DD genotype predicted severe 
left ventricular hypertrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the I/D genotypes of the 
angiotensin-converting enzyme gene predict not only the expected survival of the 
transplanted organ, but also that of the patient. Patients with the DD genotype 
are more susceptible for transplant failure. These patients should be identified 
and a special attention should be made on their pharmacological treatment 
(renin-angiotensin system inhibition), and their complience should also be 
maintained.

BACKGROUND: Treatment with an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years as up-front 
monotherapy or after tamoxifen therapy is the treatment of choice for 
hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Extending 
treatment with an aromatase inhibitor to 10 years may further reduce the risk of 
breast-cancer recurrence.
METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the 
effect of the extended use of letrozole for an additional 5 years. Our primary 
end point was disease-free survival.
RESULTS: We enrolled 1918 women. After a median follow-up of 6.3 years, there 
were 165 events involving disease recurrence or the occurrence of contralateral 
breast cancer (67 with letrozole and 98 with placebo) and 200 deaths (100 in 
each group). The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 95% (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 93 to 96) with letrozole and 91% (95% CI; 89 to 93) with placebo 
(hazard ratio for disease recurrence or the occurrence of contralateral breast 
cancer, 0.66; P=0.01 by a two-sided log-rank test stratified according to nodal 
status, prior adjuvant chemotherapy, the interval from the last dose of 
aromatase-inhibitor therapy, and the duration of treatment with tamoxifen). The 
rate of 5-year overall survival was 93% (95% CI, 92 to 95) with letrozole and 
94% (95% CI, 92 to 95) with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.97; P=0.83). The annual 
incidence rate of contralateral breast cancer in the letrozole group was 0.21% 
(95% CI, 0.10 to 0.32), and the rate in the placebo group was 0.49% (95% CI, 
0.32 to 0.67) (hazard ratio, 0.42; P=0.007). Bone-related toxic effects occurred 
more frequently among patients receiving letrozole than among those receiving 
placebo, including a higher incidence of bone pain, bone fractures, and 
new-onset osteoporosis. No significant differences between letrozole and placebo 
were observed in scores on most subscales measuring quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The extension of treatment with an adjuvant aromatase inhibitor to 
10 years resulted in significantly higher rates of disease-free survival and a 
lower incidence of contralateral breast cancer than those with placebo, but the 
rate of overall survival was not higher with the aromatase inhibitor than with 
placebo. (Funded by the Canadian Cancer Society and others; ClinicalTrials.gov

Deaths, injuries and disabilities resulting from road traffic injuries (RTIs) 
are a public health major concern. This study aims to calculate the burden of 
RTIs in Kermanshah Province in Iran. In this study to determine the years of 
life lost (YLL) related to RTIs, the National Death Registration and Forensics 
Medicine census data were employed. We use forensic medicine data to calculate 
the incidence of non-fatal injuries and years lost due to disability (YLD). The 
cause of death and non-fatal injuries was classified using ICD-10 codes and 23 
groupes of global burden of diseases (GBD) 2010. The disability-adjusted life 
year (DALY) estimated on the guidelines of the GBD 2010 and age and sex 
structure was taken from the National Statistic Center for the year 2010. 
Overall, 70.8% of the subjects were males. The fatal and non-fatal injury rates 
of RTI were 51.3 and 283.6 per 100,000 persons, respectively. YLLs and YLDs were 
46613 (24.5 per 1000) and 3405 (1.8 per 1000) in both sexes, respectively. The 
disability adjusted life years were 40711 in males, 9306 in females and 50018 in 
both sexes (42.5, 9.8 and 26.3 per 1000, respectively). More than 93% of DALY 
was from YLL (24.5 per 1000), with a small proportion for YLD (1.8 per 1000). 
Accounting for more than 50,000 DALY attributed to RTIs, traffic injuries is a 
major public health and socioeconomic problem in Kermanshah. Designing 
cost-effective interventions based on comprehensive and multi-sectoral 
programmes at the national and provincial levels can save many lives and 
resources that are lost every year. Undoubtedly, establishing a surveillance 
system at the sub-national level and measuring the burden of injuries, as in 
this study, can help policy-makers and planners in lessening the burden of RTIs.

Re-imagining dementia in the fourth age: the ironic fictions of Alice Munro.

Goldman M(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of English, University of Toronto, Canada.

This paper analyses two stories by Alice Munro to explore how her fiction 
interrogates the prevailing social imaginary of the fourth age. Drawing on the 
theory of Gilleard and Higgs, I show how Munro's stories rely on irony and 
surreal imagery to subvert the logic that engenders and normalises the 
opposition between the third and fourth ages, and, by extension, the social 
death of people coping with later-life dementia. Ultimately, I argue that 
Munro's fiction does not so much reveal the Truth about the fourth age, as 
expose the reader's complicity in the construction of the prevailing gothic 
social imaginary.
