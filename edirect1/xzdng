specifics of vaccine performance, distribution programme, and future pandemic 
trends. The principal drivers of the health outcomes are the fitted values for 
the overall transmission scaling parameter and disease natural history 
parameters from other studies, particularly age-specific probabilities of 
infection and symptomatic disease, as well as social contact rates. Other 
parameters are investigated in sensitivity analyses. This study is limited by 
model approximations, available data, and future uncertainty. Because the model 
is a single-population compartmental model, detailed impacts of 
nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as household isolation cannot be 
practically represented or evaluated in combination with vaccine programmes. 
Similarly, the model cannot consider prioritising groups like healthcare or 
other essential workers. The model is only fitted to the reported case and death 
data, which are incomplete and not disaggregated by, e.g., age. Finally, because 
the future impact and implementation cost of NPIs are uncertain, how these would 
interact with vaccination remains an open question.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination can have a considerable health impact and is 
likely to be cost-effective if more optimistic vaccine scenarios apply. 
Preventing severe disease is an important contributor to this impact. However, 
the advantage of prioritising older, high-risk populations is smaller in 
generally younger populations. This reduction is especially true in populations 
with more past transmission, and if the vaccine is likely to further impede 
transmission rather than just disease. Those conditions are typical of many low- 
and middle-income countries.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare and to test the performance of 
all available risk scoring systems (RSSs) designed to predict long-term survival 
rate in asymptomatic candidate patients for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for 
significant carotid artery stenosis.
METHODS: Data on asymptomatic patients who underwent CEA in three high-volume 
centers were prospectively recorded. Through literature research using Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
recommendations, six RSSs were identified for the intent of the study. Primary 
endpoints were 3- and 5-year survival rates after CEA. All items used as 
variables to compose multiple RSSs were applied to every patient in the study 
population. The 3- and 5-year mortality prediction rates for each score were 
assessed by sensitivity, specificity, and predictive negative and positive value 
calculation, as well as univariable Cox proportional hazard models with the 
Harrell C index.
RESULTS: During the study period, 825 CEAs in 825 asymptomatic patients were 
analyzed. All items used in RSSs were available in the dataset, with some 
concerns regarding their definition and application among RSSs. The 3- and 
5-year survival rates of the study cohort were 94.5% and 90.3%, respectively. 
Among the six RSSs analyzed, no RSS demonstrated optimal results in terms of 
mortality rate prediction accuracy, although some scores had good diagnostic and 
risk of death precision.
CONCLUSIONS: RSSs, when used alone, fail to optimally detect postoperative life 
expectancy in asymptomatic CEA patient candidates. Further prospective 
controlled studies are needed to compose and validate RSSs with better 
calibration to predict outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Obesity and type 2 diabetes are two interrelated metabolic disorders 
characterized by insulin resistance and a mild chronic inflammatory state. We 
previously observed that leptin (ob/ob) and leptin receptor (db/db) knockout 
mice display a distinct inflammatory tone in the liver and adipose tissue. The 
present study aimed at investigating whether alterations in these tissues of the 
molecules belonging to the endocannabinoidome (eCBome), an extension of the 
endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system, whose functions are important in the 
context of metabolic disorders and inflammation, could reflect their different 
inflammatory phenotypes.
RESULTS: The basal eCBome lipid and gene expression profiles, measured by 
targeted lipidomics and qPCR transcriptomics, respectively, in the liver and 
subcutaneous or visceral adipose tissues, highlighted a differentially altered 
eCBome tone, which may explain the impaired hepatic function and more pronounced 
liver inflammation remarked in the ob/ob mice, as well as the more pronounced 
inflammatory state observed in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of db/db mice. In 
particular, the levels of linoleic acid-derived endocannabinoid-like molecules, 
of one of their 12-lipoxygenase metabolites and of Trpv2 expression, were always 
altered in tissues exhibiting the highest inflammation. Correlation studies 
suggested the possible interactions with some gut microbiota bacterial taxa, 
whose respective absolute abundances were significantly different between ob/ob 
and the db/db mice.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings emphasize the possibility that bioactive 
lipids and the respective receptors and enzymes belonging to the eCBome may 
sustain the tissue-dependent inflammatory state that characterizes obesity and 
diabetes, possibly in relation with gut microbiome alterations.

BACKGROUND: Altered ventral striatal (vST) activation to reward expectancy is a 
well-established intermediate phenotype for psychiatric disorders, specifically 
schizophrenia (SZ). Preclinical research suggests that striatal alterations are 
related to a reduced inhibition by the hippocampal formation, but its role in 
human transdiagnostic reward-network dysfunctions is not well understood.
METHODS: We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging during reward 
processing in 728 individuals including healthy control subjects (n = 396), 
patients (SZ: n = 46; bipolar disorder: n = 45; major depressive disorder: n = 
60), and unaffected first-degree relatives (SZ: n = 46; bipolar disorder: n = 
50; major depressive disorder: n = 85). We assessed disorder-specific 
differences in functional vST-hippocampus coupling and transdiagnostic 
associations with dimensional measures of positive, negative, and cognitive 
symptoms. We also probed the genetic underpinning using polygenic risk scores 
for SZ in a subset of healthy participants (n = 295).
RESULTS: Functional vST-hippocampus coupling was 1) reduced in patients with SZ 
and bipolar disorder (pFWE < .05, small-volume corrected [SVC]); 2) associated 
transdiagnostically to dimensional measures of positive (pFWE = .01, SVC) and 
cognitive (pFWE = .02, SVC), but not negative, (pFWE > .05, SVC) symptoms; and 
3) reduced in first-degree relatives of patients with SZ (pFWE = .017, SVC) and 
linked to the genetic risk for SZ in healthy participants (p = .035).
CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that reduced vST-hippocampus coupling during 
reward processing is an endophenotype for SZ linked to positive and cognitive 
symptoms, supporting current preclinical models of the emergence of psychosis. 
Moreover, our data indicate that vST-hippocampus coupling is familial and linked 
to polygenic scores for SZ, supporting the use of this measure as an 
intermediate phenotype for psychotic disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Stomach cancer is a serious global public health problem. The 
current burden of stomach cancer and its trends across time and location need to 
be understood to develop effective preventive strategies.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease study. The burden 
of stomach cancer and variations in time and geographical regions were assessed 
according to the age-standardized rate and estimated annual percentage change 
(EAPC) of the incidence and mortality rate between 1991 and 2017. We also 
investigated the associations between the relevant rates and sociodemographic 
index (SDI).
RESULTS: Overall, the age-standardized incidence rate (EAPC = -1.36, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: -1.47 to -1.25), age-standardized mortality rate (EAPC 
= -2.2, 95% CI: -2.29 to -2.12), and age-standardized disability-adjusted life 
years rate (EAPC = -2.52, 95% CI: -2.63 to -2.43) decreased worldwide from 1990 
to 2017. This trend varied across different countries and regions and according 
to sex and age. SDI had a significant negative correlation with the 
age-standardized mortality rate (P < 0.01, r = -0.28) and age-standardized 
disability-adjusted life years rate (P < 0.01, r = -0.31). Similar negative 
correlations were observed between SDI and the EAPC.
DISCUSSION: The observed correlation between SDI and disease burden suggests 
that strategically implementing the screening and eradication of Helicobacter 
pylori, improving the medical level in countries with low SDI, and promoting the 
implementation of tobacco cessation policies would help reduce the disease 
burden of stomach cancer.

Surgical palliation in poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the 
hypopharynx: Case report.

London, UK.

BACKGROUND: Primary neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) are very rare entities 
accounting for 0.49% of all malignancies. Within the head and neck, the most 
common sites are the larynx and paranasal sinuses, while the hypopharynx is 
seldom described.
CASE: We present a patient with a poorly differentiated metastatic NEC of the 
hypopharynx treated palliatively with organ-preserving surgery and 
post-operative chemotherapy, and literature review for well-documented pure 
hypopharyngeal NECs. Our patient died of chest infection during chemotherapy, 
4 months after surgery.
CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment in the presence of 
metastases with 2-year overall survival of 15.7%. Due to the aggressive nature 
of poorly differentiated metastatic NECs, surgical management is seldom 
considered. We report and advocate the successful palliative role of 
organ-preserving, minimally invasive trans-oral LASER micro-surgery and neck 
dissection to control loco-regional head and neck disease, safe-guarding better 
quality of home life, despite limited life expectancy for this condition.

There is interest in the potential of Internet-delivered programs to 
cost-effectively increase access to pain management for people with chronic 
pain. However, few large-scale clinical and economic evaluations have been 
undertaken. Using a randomised controlled trial design, the current study (n = 
659) examined the clinical efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and cost utility of an 
Internet-delivered pain management program for people with mixed chronic pain 
conditions when delivered with optional clinician support. The treatment group 
reported significant improvements in disability, depression, anxiety, average 
pain intensity, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), compared with control, 
and exhibited relatively high levels of treatment engagement and satisfaction. 
Each additional clinical improvement (defined as ≥ 30% improvement) produced by 
the intervention, over control, was associated with a cost of $48, $27, $38, and 
$83 for disability, depression, anxiety, and average pain intensity, 
respectively. Gaining one QALY was associated with a cost of $152 or $11,910 per 
QALY when an 80% probability criterion for cost utility was applied. The program 
itself was associated a relatively small, fixed, cost per patient but was not 
cost saving over the brief intervention period. The findings support the 
clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Internet-delivered programs with "on 
demand" clinician support as a way to increase access to pain management. Key 
limitations of the current study include the use of a waitlist-control group, a 
short follow-up period, and the focus on governmental healthcare costs. Further 
evaluation of these programs is necessary if they are scaled up and offered as 
routine care.

IMPORTANCE: Death rattle, defined as noisy breathing caused by the presence of 
mucus in the respiratory tract, is relatively common among dying patients. 
Although clinical guidelines recommend anticholinergic drugs to reduce the death 
rattle after nonpharmacological measures fail, evidence regarding their efficacy 
is lacking. Given that anticholinergics only decrease mucus production, it is 
unknown whether prophylactic application may be more appropriate.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether administration of prophylactic scopolamine 
butylbromide reduces the death rattle.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial was performed in 6 hospices in the Netherlands. 
Patients with a life expectancy of 3 or more days who were admitted to the 
participating hospices were asked to give advance informed consent from April 
10, 2017, through December 31, 2019. When the dying phase was recognized, 
patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria were randomized. Of the 229 
patients who provided advance informed consent, 162 were ultimately randomized. 
The date of final follow-up was January 31, 2020.
INTERVENTIONS: Administration of subcutaneous scopolamine butylbromide, 20 mg 
four times a day (n = 79), or placebo (n = 78).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the occurrence of a grade 2 
or higher death rattle as defined by Back (range, 0-3; 0, no rattle; 3, rattle 
audible standing in the door opening) measured at 2 consecutive time points with 
a 4-hour interval. Secondary outcomes included the time between recognizing the 
dying phase and the onset of a death rattle and anticholinergic adverse events.
RESULTS: Among 162 patients who were randomized, 157 patients (97%; median age, 
76 years [IQR, 66-84 years]; 56% women) were included in the primary analyses. A 
death rattle occurred in 10 patients (13%) in the scopolamine group compared 
with 21 patients (27%) in the placebo group (difference, 14%; 95% CI, 2%-27%, 
P = .02). Regarding secondary outcomes, an analysis of the time to death rattle 
yielded a subdistribution hazard ratio (HR) of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.20-0.92; P = .03; 
cumulative incidence at 48 hours: 8% in the scopolamine group vs 17% in the 
placebo group). In the scopolamine vs placebo groups, restlessness occurred in 
22 of 79 patients (28%) vs 18 of 78 (23%), dry mouth in 8 of 79 (10%) vs 12 of 
78 (15%), and urinary retention in 6 of 26 (23%) vs 3 of 18 (17%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients near the end of life, prophylactic 
subcutaneous scopolamine butylbromide, compared with placebo, significantly 
reduced the occurrence of the death rattle.

PURPOSE: To examine the cost effectiveness of dietary advice to increase protein 
intake on 6-month change in physical functioning among older adults.
METHODS: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, 276 community-dwelling 
older adults with a habitual protein intake < 1.0 g/kg adjusted body weight 
(aBW)/d were randomly assigned to either Intervention 1; advice to increase 
protein intake to ≥ 1.2 g/kg aBW/d (PROT, n = 96), Intervention 2; similar 
advice and in addition advice to consume protein (en)rich(ed) foods within half 
an hour after usual physical activity (PROT + TIMING, n = 89), or continue the 
habitual diet with no advice (CON, n = 91). Primary outcome was 6-month change 
in 400-m walk time. Secondary outcomes were 6-month change in physical 
performance, leg extension strength, grip strength, body composition, 
self-reported mobility limitations and quality of life. We evaluated cost 
effectiveness from a societal perspective.
RESULTS: Compared to CON, a positive effect on walk time was observed for PROT; 
 - 12.4 s (95%CI,  - 21.8 to  - 2.9), and for PROT + TIMING;  - 4.9 s (95%CI, 
 - 14.5 to 4.7). Leg extension strength significantly increased in PROT 
(+ 32.6 N (95%CI, 10.6-54.5)) and PROT + TIMING (+ 24.3 N (95%CI, 0.2-48.5)) 
compared to CON. No significant intervention effects were observed for the other 
secondary outcomes. From a societal perspective, PROT was cost effective 
compared to CON.
CONCLUSION: Dietary advice to increase protein intake to ≥ 1.2 g/kg aBW/d 
improved 400-m walk time and leg strength among older adults with a lower 
habitual protein intake. From a societal perspective, PROT was considered 
cost-effective compared to CON. These findings support the need for 
re-evaluating the protein RDA of 0.8 g/kg BW/d for older adults.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT03712306). Date of registration: October 2018. Registry name: The (Cost) 
Effectiveness of Increasing Protein Intake on Physical Functioning in Older 
Adults. Trial Identifier: NCT03712306.

Aerobic exercise is a promising intervention to attenuate frailty, but 
preclinical studies have used only male animals. We investigated the impact of 
voluntary aerobic exercise on frailty, biological age (FRailty Inferred 
Geriatric Health Timeline [FRIGHT] clock), predicted life expectancy (Analysis 
of FRAIlty and Death [AFRAID] clock), and mortality in both sexes and determined 
whether exercise was associated with changes in inflammation. Older (21-23 
months) male (n = 12) and female (n = 22) C57Bl/6 mice matched for baseline 
frailty scores were randomized into exercise (running wheel) and sedentary (no 
wheel) groups. Frailty index scores were measured biweekly (13 weeks), and 23 
serum cytokines were measured at midpoint and end point. Exercise levels varied 
between mice but not between the sexes. Exercise had no effect on mortality, but 
it attenuated the development of frailty in both sexes (female = 0.32 ± 0.04 vs 
0.21 ± 0.01; p = .005; male = 0.30 ± 0.02 vs 0.22 ± 0.02; p = .042) and reduced 
frailty in older females after 10 weeks. FRIGHT scores were unaffected by 
exercise but increased with time in sedentary males indicating increased 
biological age. Exercise prevented the age-associated decline in AFRAID scores 
in older females such that exercised females had a longer life expectancy. We 
investigated whether aerobic exercise was associated with changes in systemic 
inflammation. Cytokine levels were not affected by exercise in males, but levels 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines were positively correlated with the frequency of 
exercise in females. Despite increases in systemic inflammation, exercise 
reduced frailty and increased life span in older females. Thus, voluntary 
aerobic exercise, even late in life, has beneficial effects on health in both 
sexes but may be especially helpful in older females.

To explore the role of the small heat shock protein beta 1 (HspB1, also known as 
Hsp25 in rodents and Hsp27 in humans) in longevity, we created a Caenorhabiditis 
elegans model with a high level of ubiquitous expression of the naked mole-rat 
HspB1 protein. The worms showed increased life span under multiple conditions 
and also increased resistance to heat stress. RNAi experiments suggest that 
HspB1-induced life extension is dependent on the transcription factors skn-1 
(Nrf2) and hsf-1 (Hsf1). RNAseq from HspB1 worms showed an enrichment in several 
skn-1 target genes, including collagen proteins and lysosomal genes. Expression 
of HspB1 also improved functional outcomes regulated by SKN-1, specifically 
oxidative stress resistance and pharyngeal integrity. This work is the first to 
link a small heat shock protein with collagen function, suggesting a novel role 
for HspB1 as a hub between canonical heat response signaling and SKN-1 
transcription.

OBJECTIVE: Extension of the posterior upper-most instrumented vertebra (UIV) 
into the upper thoracic (UT) spine allows for greater deformity correction and 
reduced incidence of proximal junction kyphosis (PJK) in adult spinal deformity 
(ASD) patients. However, it may be associated with chronic postoperative 
scapular pain (POSP). The goal of this study was to assess the relationship 
between UT UIV and persistent POSP, describe the pain, and assess its impact on 
patient disability.
METHODS: ASD patients who underwent multilevel posterior fusion were 
retrospectively identified then administered a survey regarding scapular pain 
and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), by telephone. Univariate and 
multivariate analysis were utilized.
RESULTS: A total of 74 ASD patients were included in the study: 37 patients with 
chronic POSP and 37 without scapular pain. The mean age was 70.5 years, and 
63.9% were women. There were no significant differences in clinical 
characteristics, including mechanical complications (PJK, pseudarthrosis, and 
rod fracture) or reoperation between groups. Patients with persistent POSP were 
more likely to have a UT than a lower thoracic UIV (p = 0.018). UT UIV was 
independently associated with chronic POSP on multivariate analysis (p = 0.022). 
ODI score was significantly higher in patients with scapular pain (p = 0.001). 
Chronic POSP (p = 0.001) and prior spine surgery (p = 0.037) were independently 
associated with ODI on multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: A UT UIV is independently associated with increased odds of chronic 
POSP, and this pain is associated with significant increases in patient 
disability. It is a significant clinical problem despite solid radiographic 
fusion and the absence of PJK.

In most macaques, females are philopatric and males migrate from their natal 
ranges, which results in pronounced divergence of mitochondrial genomes within 
and among species. We therefore predicted that some nuclear genes would have to 
acquire compensatory mutations to preserve compatibility with diverged 
interaction partners from the mitochondria. We additionally expected that these 
sex-differences would have distinctive effects on gene flow in the X and 
autosomes. Using new genomic data from 29 individuals from eight species of 
Southeast Asian macaque, we identified evidence of natural selection associated 
with mitonuclear interactions, including extreme outliers of interspecies 
differentiation and metrics of positive selection, low intraspecies polymorphism 
and atypically long runs of homozygosity associated with nuclear-encoded genes 
that interact with mitochondria-encoded genes. In one individual with 
introgressed mitochondria, we detected a small but significant enrichment of 
autosomal introgression blocks from the source species of her mitochondria that 
contained genes which interact with mitochondria-encoded loci. Our analyses also 
demonstrate that sex-specific demography sculpts genetic exchange across 
multiple species boundaries. These findings show that behaviour can have 
profound but indirect effects on genome evolution by influencing how interacting 
components of different genomic compartments (mitochondria, the autosomes and 
the sex chromosomes) move through time and space.

Telomeres, the end fragments of chromosomes, play key roles in cellular 
proliferation and senescence. Here we characterize the genetic architecture of 
naturally occurring variation in leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and identify 
causal links between LTL and biomedical phenotypes in 472,174 well-characterized 
UK Biobank participants. We identified 197 independent sentinel variants 
associated with LTL at 138 genomic loci (108 new). Genetically determined 
differences in LTL were associated with multiple biological traits, ranging from 
height to bone marrow function, as well as several diseases spanning neoplastic, 
vascular and inflammatory pathologies. Finally, we estimated that, at the age of 
40 years, people with an LTL >1 s.d. shorter than the population mean had a 
2.5-year-lower life expectancy compared with the group with ≥1 s.d. longer LDL. 
Overall, we furnish new insights into the genetic regulation of LTL, reveal 
wide-ranging influences of LTL on physiological traits, diseases and longevity, 
and provide a powerful resource available to the global research community.

PURPOSE: Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is clonal fibroblastic proliferation 
that arises in the deep soft tissues, tends to reoccur, and is locally invasive. 
Desmoid-type fibromatosis of paranasal sinuses with intracranial extension is a 
rare condition that is even rarer in a small child. We aim to share with the 
reader our literature review, decision-making, and endoscopic endonasal 
operation procedure that combined gained us favorable results against this 
benign tumor with unpredictable natural history and disease course.
CASE REPORT: We describe the decision-making process in the management of a 
3-year-old boy with a history of sudden vision loss and vomiting. MR showed an 
expansive well-delineated homogeneous tumor in the sphenoid sinus with 
intracranial extension and optic nerves compression. The diagnosis of a sporadic 
form of desmoid-type fibromatosis was made using genetic testing of tumor 
tissue. A total gross removal was carried out with endoscopic endonasal 
microsurgical approach. At a 3-month follow-up, the patient is without any signs 
of recurrance.
CONCLUSION: The treatment of children with desmoid-type fibromatosis requires a 
multidisciplinary approach by clinicians experienced with the management of 
pediatric cancer. While the desmoid-type fibromatosis is a benign, locally 
invasive tumor, observation should be the first step in the management. In case 
of life-threatening or symptomatic cases, operations that preserve function and 
structure should be the first choice for this benign tumor with unpredictable 
natural history and disease course.

Physical inactivity is the leading cause of non-communicable diseases, and 
further research on the cost-effectiveness of interventions that target 
inactivity is warranted. Socioeconomic status is vital in this process. We aim 
to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a cycle-network expansion plan in Oslo 
compared to the status quo by income quintiles. We applied a Markov model using 
a public payer perspective. Health outcomes were measured by quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) gained from the prevention of coronary heart disease, stroke, 
type 2 diabetes, and cancer. We measured equity impact by the concentration 
index and social welfare using the achievement index. We conducted sensitivity 
analyses. The intervention was generally more costly and more effective than the 
status quo. Incremental cost per QALY falls with income quintile, ranging from 
$10,098 in the richest quintile to $23,053 per QALY gained in the poorest 
quintile. The base-case intervention increased health inequality. However, a 
scenario targeting low-income quintiles reduced inequality and increased social 
welfare. In conclusion, the cycle-network expansion is likely to be 
cost-effective, but with equity concerns. If decision makers care about health 
inequalities, the disadvantaged groups could be targeted to produce more 
equitable and socially desirable outcomes instead of a uniform intervention 
across income quintiles.

Dynamic information of intracellular transcripts is essential to understand 
their functional roles. Routine RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) methods only measure 
RNA species at a steady state and do not provide RNA dynamic information. Here, 
we develop addition-elimination mechanism-activated nucleotide transition 
sequencing (AENT-seq) for transcriptome-wide profiling of RNA dynamics. In 
AENT-seq, nascent transcripts are metabolically labeled with 4-thiouridine 
(4sU). The total RNA is treated with N2H4·H2O under aqueous conditions. N2H4·H2O 
is demonstrated to convert 4sU to 4-hydrazino cytosine (C*) based on an 
addition-elimination chemistry. C* is regarded as cytosine (C) during the DNA 
extension process. This 4sU-to-C transition marks nascent transcripts, so it 
enables sequencing analysis of RNA dynamics. We apply our AENT-seq to 
investigate transcript dynamic information of several genes involved in cancer 
progression and metastasis. This method uses a simple chemical reaction in 
aqueous solutions and will be rapidly disseminated with extensive applications.

Background: Accurate prognosis in terminal cancer patients is useful to improve 
their quality of life and also to decide the cessation of fluid administration. 
Nonetheless, few prognostic indicators are available for prediction of such a 
short-term life expectancy. Objectives: The present study aimed at evaluating 
the efficacy of C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin (CRP/Alb) ratio, prognostic 
nutritional index (PNI), fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) 
score in identifying terminal cancer patients who have a life expectancy less 
than two weeks. Design: Retrospective study. Setting/Subjects: Of 483 patients 
who died between April 2019 and March 2020 at a single center in Japan, 102 who 
met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. Measurements: CRP/Alb, 
PNI, FIB-4, and ALBI were calculated from the laboratory data collected 1-13, 
14-27, 28-83, and 168-365 days before death and subjected to statistical 
analyses. Results: CRP/Alb, PNI, FIB-4, and ALBI values were significantly 
associated with the time before death during terminal 365 days. CRP/Alb ≥4.4, 
PNI <30, FIB-4 ≥ 9.4, and ALBI ≥ -1.26 were significantly associated with the 
transition from the first half to the second half of terminal four weeks. Of 
those prognostic indicators, three and four combinations provided significantly 
reliable estimation of a life expectancy less than two weeks. Conclusions: 
CRP/Alb, PNI, FIB-4, ALBI, and their combinations are considered to help 
identify cancer patients who have a life expectancy less than two weeks, which 
is useful to make appropriate end-stage treatment decisions, for example, 
cessation of artificial hydration therapy.
