OBJECTIVES: Increasing life expectancy and decreasing mortality in patients with 
HIV infection are well documented. However, details of how many of the years of 
healthy life are damaged by HIV infection vs. good health have not been 
understood. We conducted this study to provide a comprehensive assessment of the 
levels and trends of the global burden, as measured by disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs), of HIV infection.
METHODS: Data on HIV-related DALY were obtained from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2019. The absolute numbers and age-standardised rates of DALYs due 
to HIV were reported between 1990 and 2019. Estimated annual percentage changes 
in age-standardised rates by sex, region and nation were calculated to quantify 
the temporal trends in HIV burden.
RESULTS: Global HIV infection caused 47.63 million DALYs in 2019, presenting a 
1.28-fold increase from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, years of life lost contributed to 
most of the total DALYs, but the increases in HIV-related years lived with 
disability have outpaced increases in years of life lost. The age-standardised 
rates of HIV-related DALYs in 2019 decreased as the sociodemographic indexes 
increased. The highest age-standardised rates were observed in sub-Saharan 
Africa, and the greatest increments over time were detected in Oceania.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, HIV continues to cause enormous healthy life loss. The 
first and foremost strategy for controlling the HIV burden is still the 
reduction of premature deaths, and much effort needs to be exerted to mitigate 
the harm of comorbidities.

OBJECTIVES: Current treatment protocols in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 
are associated with high remission rates and long life expectancy, enhancing the 
importance of quality of life and prevention of treatment-related complications 
in patient care. As osteoporosis is a frequent complication in patients under 
chemotherapy, we investigated the effect of vitamin K2 (100 mcg menaquinone-7) 
and vitamin D3 (10 mcg calcitriol) on bone metabolism in children with ALL.
METHODS: Twenty-nine consecutive patients recently diagnosed with B precursor 
ALL (B-ALL) and treated according to the Turkish Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 
Berlin Frankfurt Münster 2000 protocol were randomly assigned into study and 
control groups. The study group (n=15, M/F: 8/7, age 1-14.5 years, mean 
6.5 years) received vitamin K2 and vitamin D3 with their chemotherapy, while the 
control group (n=14, M/F 9/5, age 2-17 years, mean 7.1 years) received 
chemotherapy only. Serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, 
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, uncarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC), tartrate 
resistant acid phosphatase 5b, carboxyl terminal procollagen propeptide (PICP), 
osteoprotegerin (OPG), and receptor activator nuclear kappa B ligand (RANKL) 
were measured and bone mineral density (BMD) was determined at baseline and 
first, second, third and sixth months.
RESULTS: The study group had higher serum OPG/RANKL ratio and lower ucOC levels 
compared to the control group at the first month; PICP levels were higher in the 
study group at second and third months.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an early beneficial effect of the combination 
of vitamin K2 and vitamin D3 on BMD in ALL patients especially during the period 
of intensive steroid therapy in the first months.

A high frequency, power, and efficiency diaphragm transducer is described for 
use with thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators. It uses a tube acting in 
compression and extension as the primary spring so that the mechanical resonant 
frequency is around 500 Hz. A high-frequency transducer results in more compact 
and higher power density thermoacoustic engines, refrigerators, and heat pumps. 
The tube spring furthermore constitutes a part of the pressure vessel so that 
the alternator is outside the pressure vessel, thereby simplifying transducer 
construction and reducing mass. The hermetically sealed transducer operates 
entirely without wear or lubricants, leading to a long maintenance-free 
lifetime. We present in situ efficiency measurement results at the full power 
operating frequency and temperature of the transducer. Despite the high 
operating frequency, the transducer efficiency is better than that of other 
transducers previously used in thermoacoustic systems. Accelerated fatigue test 
results on tube spring coupons justify the long-life claims. The exceptional 
stiffness of the primary spring in this transducer leads to the unusual need to 
consider stretch in additional transducer structural components. We present a 
multi-mass, lumped-element, coupled oscillator model of the transducer and 
discuss thermoacoustic system design using this model.

BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an effective procedure for patients 
with end-stage hip osteoarthritis. However, whether or not pre-operatively 
existing functional deficits are persisting several years post-surgery in the 
affected limb has not been thoroughly researched. Therefore, the primary aim of 
this preliminary study was to include patients four to five years after 
undergoing THA and to investigate potential differences between the operated and 
non-operated leg in hip strength, range of motion (ROM), balance, and gait. The 
secondary aim was to compare these values from the operated leg of the patients 
to those of the legs of healthy subjects.
METHODS: Sixteen patients (age: 65.20 ± 5.32 years) following unilateral THA 
(post-operation time: 4.7 ± 0.7 years) and ten, healthy, age-matched control 
subjects (age: 60.85 ± 7.57 years) were examined for maximum isometric hip 
muscle strength, active ROM of the hip joint, balance and gait on both limbs. 
Paired t-tests were used to assess the inter-limb differences in the THA group. 
Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed to compare groups, using age as a 
covariate.
RESULTS: The analysis of inter-limb differences in patients following THA 
revealed significant deficits on the operated side for hip abduction strength 
(p = 0.02), for hip flexion ROM (p < 0.01) and for balance in terms of the 
length of center of pressure (COP) (p = 0.04). Compared to values of the control 
subjects, the patients demonstrated significantly reduced hip strength in 
flexion, extension and abduction (p < 0.05) on the operated leg as well as 
reduced ROM measures in hip flexion, extension and abduction (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The first results of this explorative study indicated that 
inter-limb differences as well as reduced hip strength and hip ROM compared with 
control subjects were still present four to five years after THA. These 
persisting asymmetries and deficits in patients following THA may be one 
explanation for the decrease in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) seen in 
patients over the years after surgery. Further studies are required to replicate 
these findings with a larger sample size.

OBJECTIVES: Low muscular strength is a risk factor for current and future 
adverse health outcomes. However, whether levels of muscular strength persist, 
or track, and if there are distinct muscular strength trajectories across the 
life course is unclear. This study aimed to explore muscular strength 
trajectories between childhood and mid-adulthood.
DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal study.
METHODS: Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study participants had their 
muscular strength (right and left handgrip, shoulder extension and flexion, and 
leg strength measured by hand-held, shoulder and leg-back dynamometers, and a 
combined strength score) assessed in childhood, young adulthood and 
mid-adulthood. The tracking of muscular strength was quantified between 
childhood and mid-adulthood (n=385) and young- and mid-adulthood (n=822). 
Muscular strength trajectory patterns were identified for participants who had 
their muscular strength assessed at least twice across the life course (n=1280).
RESULTS: Levels of muscular strength were persistent between childhood and 
mid-adulthood and between young- and mid-adulthood, with the highest tracking 
correlations observed for the combined strength score (childhood to 
mid-adulthood: r=0.47, p<0.001; young- to mid-adulthood: r=0.72, p<0.001). Three 
trajectories of combined muscular strength were identified across the life 
course; participants maintained average, above average, or below average levels 
of combined muscular strength.
CONCLUSIONS: Weak children are likely to become weak adults in midlife unless 
strategies aimed at increasing muscular strength levels are introduced. Whether 
interventions aimed at increasing muscular strength could be implemented in 
childhood to help establish favourable muscular strength trajectories across the 
life course and in turn, better future health, warrant further attention.

Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined as a reduction in ovarian 
function before the expected age of menopause. POI is known to increase the risk 
of cardiovascular disorders, osteoporosis, cognitive decline, and mood 
disorders, resulting in a reduced quality of life. Appropriate hormone 
replacement for premenopausal women decreases these adverse health risks and 
improves quality of life for women with POI, but does not prolong life 
expectancy. The potential etiologies of POI include chromosomal abnormalities 
and genetic mutations, autoimmune factors, and iatrogenic causes, including 
surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. A major association is suggested 
to exist between reproductive longevity and the DNA damage pathway response 
genes. DNA damage and repair in ovarian granulosa cells is strongly associated 
with POI. Depletion of oocytes with damaged DNA occurs through different cell 
death mechanisms, such as apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis, mediated by the 
phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein 
kinase B (AKT)/forkhead transcription factors 3 (FOXO3) pathway. Mesenchymal 
stem cells (MSCs) are characterized by the ability of self-renewal and 
differentiation and play an important role in the regeneration of injured 
tissues. Transplantation of MSCs has been shown to functionally restore ovarian 
reserve in a POI mouse model. Recent advances in stem cell therapy are likely to 
be translated to new therapeutic options bringing new hope to patients with POI. 
The aim of this review is to summarize the pathogenic mechanisms that involve 
cell death and DNA damage and repair pathways and to discuss the stem cell-based 
therapies as potential therapeutic options for this gynecologic pathology.

Despite frequent associations, deindustrialization features rarely in studies of 
organized crime, and organized crime is at best a spectral presence in studies 
of deindustrialization. By developing an original application of Linkon's 
concept of the "half-life," we present an empirical case for the symbiotic 
relationship between former sites of industry and the emergence of criminal 
markets. Based on a detailed case-study in the west of Scotland, an area long 
associated with both industry and crime, the paper interrogates the 
environmental, social, and cultural after-effects of deindustrialization at a 
community level. Drawing on 55 interviews with residents and service-providers 
in Tunbrooke, an urban community where an enduring criminal market grew in the 
ruins of industry, the paper elaborates the complex landscapes of identity, 
vulnerability, and harm that are embedded in the symbiosis of crime and 
deindustrialization. Building on recent scholarship, the paper argues that 
organized crime in Tunbrooke is best understood as an instance of "residual 
culture" grafted onto a fragmented, volatile criminal marketplace where the 
stable props of territorial identity are unsettled. The analysis allows for an 
extension of both the study of deindustrialization and organized crime, 
appreciating the "enduring legacies" of closure on young people, communal 
identity, and social relations in the twenty-first century.

OBJECTIVES: Important links between dietary patterns and diseases have been 
widely applied to establish nutrition interventions. However, knowledge about 
between-person heterogeneity regarding the benefits of nutrition intervention 
can be used to personalize the intervention and thereby improve health outcomes 
and efficiency. We performed a systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses 
(CEAs) of interventions with a personalized nutrition (PN) component to assess 
their methodology and findings.
METHODS: A systematic search (March 2019) was performed in 5 databases: EMBASE, 
Medline Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar. CEAs 
involving interventions in adults with a PN component were included; CEAs 
focusing on clinical nutrition or undernutrition were excluded. The CHEERS 
checklist was used to assess the quality of CEAs.
RESULTS: We identified 49 eligible studies among 1792 unique records. 
Substantial variation in methodology was found. Most studies (91%) focused only 
on psychological concepts of PN such as behavior and preferences. Thirty-four 
CEAs were trial-based, 13 were modeling studies, and 4 studies were both trial- 
and model-based. Thirty-two studies used quality-adjusted life year as an 
outcome measure. Different time horizons, comparators, and modeling assumptions 
were applied, leading to differences in costs/quality-adjusted life years. 
Twenty-eight CEAs (49%) concluded that the intervention was cost-effective, and 
75% of the incremental cost-utility ratios were cost-effective given a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per quality-adjusted life year.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions with PN components are often evaluated using various 
types of models. However, most PN interventions have been considered 
cost-effective. More studies should examine the cost-effectiveness of PN 
interventions that combine psychological and biological concepts of 
personalization.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the impact of mammography-based screening on the quality 
of life, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted or quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) gained can be used. We aimed to assess whether the use of DALYs 
averted or QALYs gained will lead to different cost-effective screening 
strategies.
METHODS: Using the microsimulation model MISCAN, we simulated different breast 
cancer screening strategies varying in starting age (starting at 45, 47, and 50 
years), stopping age (stopping at 69, 72, and 74 years), and frequency (annual 
[A], biennial [B], combination of both [A + B], and triennial [T]). In total, we 
defined 24 different breast cancer screening strategies, including no screening 
as a reference strategy. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) and compared which strategies were on the efficiency frontiers for DALYs 
and QALYs.
RESULTS: Breast cancer screening averted between 46.00 and 105.58 DALYs and 
gained between 28.69 and 64.50 QALYs per 1000 women. For DALYs there were 5 
strategies on the efficiency frontier (T50-69, T50-74, T45-74, B45-74, and 
A45-74). The same strategies plus one (B45-72) were on the efficiency frontier 
for QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Using DALYs averted instead of QALYs gained to assess the effects 
on quality of life from breast cancer screening in the Dutch population yields 
differences in ICERs, but almost the same strategies were on the efficiency 
frontiers. Whether the choice in outcome measure leads to a difference in 
optimal policy depends on the cost-effectiveness threshold.

OBJECTIVES: Promoting patient involvement in managing co-occurring physical and 
mental health conditions is increasingly recognized as critical to improving 
outcomes and controlling costs in this growing chronically ill population. The 
main objective of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation of the 
Wellness Incentives and Navigation (WIN) intervention as part of a longitudinal 
randomized pragmatic clinical trial for chronically ill Texas Medicaid enrollees 
with co-occurring physical and mental health conditions.
METHODS: The WIN intervention used a personal navigator, motivational 
interviewing, and a flexible wellness expense account to increase patient 
activation, that is, the patient's knowledge, skills, and confidence in managing 
their self-care and co-occurring physical and mental health conditions. 
Regression models were fit to both participant-level quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and total costs of care (including the intervention) controlling for 
demographics, health status, poverty, Medicaid managed care plan, intervention 
group, and baseline health utility and costs. Incremental costs and QALYs were 
calculated based on the difference in predicted costs and QALYs under 
intervention versus usual care and were used to calculate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Confidence intervals were calculated using 
Fieller's method, and sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The mean ICER for the intervention compared with usual care was $12 511 
(95% CI $8971-$16 842), with a sizable majority of participants (70%) having 
ICERs below $40 000. The WIN intervention also produced higher QALY increases 
for participants who were sicker at baseline compared to those who were 
healthier at baseline.
CONCLUSION: The WIN intervention shows considerable promise as a cost-effective 
intervention in this challenging chronically ill population.

METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of cemiplimab versus historical standard of care (SOC). All 
inputs were identified based on a systematic literature review, supplemented by 
expert opinion where necessary. Clinical inputs for cemiplimab were based on 
individual patient data from a cemiplimab phase 2 single-arm trial 
(NCT27060498). For SOC, analysis was based on a pooled analysis of single-arm 
clinical trials and retrospective studies evaluating chemotherapy and epidermal 
growth factor receptor inhibitors (cetuximab, erlotinib, and gefitinib) 
identified via a systematic literature review (6 of the 27 included studies). 
Overall survival and progression-free survival were extrapolated over a lifetime 
horizon. Costs were included for drug acquisition, drug administration, 
management of adverse events, subsequent therapy, disease management, and 
terminal care. Unit costs were based on published 2019 US list prices.
RESULTS: In the base case, cemiplimab versus SOC resulted in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $99 447 per quality adjusted-life year (QALY), where 
incremental costs and QALYs were $372 108 and 3.74, respectively. At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000/QALY, the probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis suggests a 90% probability that cemiplimab is cost-effective compared 
to SOC. Scenario analyses resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
ranging from $90 590 to $148 738.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with historical SOC, cemiplimab is a cost-effective use of 
US payer resources for the treatment of advanced CSCC and is expected to provide 
value for money.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze whether the adoption of a societal perspective would 
alter the results and conclusions of economic evaluations for rare 
disease-related healthcare technologies.
METHODS: A search strategy involving all the active substances considered as 
orphan drugs by the European Medicines Agency plus a list of 76 rare diseases 
combined with economic-related terms was conducted on Medline and the 
Cost-Effectiveness Registry from the beginning of 2000 until November 2018. We 
included studies that considered quality-adjusted life years as an outcome, were 
published in a scientific journal, were written in English, included informal 
care costs or productivity losses, and separated the results according to the 
applied perspective.
RESULTS: We found 14 articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 
Productivity losses were considered in 12 studies, the human capital approach 
being the method most frequently used. Exclusively, informal care was considered 
in 2 articles, being valued through the opportunity cost method. The 14 articles 
selected resulted in 26 economic evaluation estimations, from which incremental 
cost-utility ratio values changed from cost-effective to dominant in 3 
estimates, but the consideration of societal costs only modified the authors' 
conclusion in 1 study.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of societal costs in the economic evaluation of rare 
diseases did not affect the conclusions of the studies except in a single 
specific case. In those studies where the societal perspective was considered, 
we did not find significant changes in the economic evaluation results due to 
the higher costs of treatments and the low quality-adjusted life-years gained.

The emergence of many new food products on the market with need of consumers to 
constantly monitor their quality until consuming, in addition to the necessity 
for reducing food corruption during preservation time, have led to the 
development of some modern packaging technologies such as intelligent packaging 
(IP) and active packaging (AP). The benefits of IP are detecting defects, 
quality monitoring and tracking the packaged food products to control the 
storage conditions from the production stage to the consumption stage by using 
various sensors and indicators such as time-temperature indicators (TTIs), gas 
indicators, humidity sensors, optical, calorimetric and electrochemical 
biosensors. While, AP helps to increase the shelf-life of products by using 
absorbing and diffusion systems for various materials like carbon dioxide, 
oxygen, and ethanol. However, there are some important issues over these 
emerging technologies including cost, marketability, consumer acceptance, safety 
and organoleptic quality of the food and emphatically environmental safety 
concerns. Therefore, future researches should be conducted to solve these 
problems and to prompt applications of IP and AP in the food industry. This 
paper reviews the latest innovations in these advanced packaging technologies 
and their applications in food industry. The IP systems namely indicators, 
barcoding techniques, radio frequency identification systems, sensors and 
biosensor are reviewed and then the latest innovations in AP methods including 
scavengers, diffusion systems and antimicrobial packaging are reviewed in 
detail.

D1R- and D2R-Medium-Sized Spiny Neurons Diversity: Insights Into Striatal 
Vulnerability to Huntington's Disease Mutation.

Integrative Biology (CIBIO), University of Trento, Trento, Italy.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
an aberrant expansion of the CAG tract within the exon 1 of the HD gene, HTT. HD 
progressively impairs motor and cognitive capabilities, leading to a total loss 
of autonomy and ultimate death. Currently, no cure or effective treatment is 
available to halt the disease. Although the HTT gene is ubiquitously expressed, 
the striatum appears to be the most susceptible district to the HD mutation with 
Medium-sized Spiny Neurons (MSNs) (D1R and D2R) representing 95% of the striatal 
neuronal population. Why are striatal MSNs so vulnerable to the HD mutation? 
Particularly, why do D1R- and D2R-MSNs display different susceptibility to HD? 
Here, we highlight significant differences between D1R- and D2R-MSNs 
subpopulations, such as morphology, electrophysiology, transcriptomic, 
functionality, and localization in the striatum. We discuss possible reasons for 
their selective degeneration in the context of HD. Our review suggests that a 
better understanding of cell type-specific gene expression dysregulation within 
the striatum might reveal new paths to therapeutic intervention or prevention to 
ameliorate HD patients' life expectancy.

The tetrapod fauna of the upper Permian Naobaogou Formation of China: 6. 
Turfanodon jiufengensis sp. nov. (Dicynodontia).

The dicynodont fossils from the Naobaogou Formation of Nei Mongol, China are 
abundant and diverse but poorly studied. In this article, one nearly complete 
skeleton and four cranial specimens from the Naobaogou Formation are referred to 
the dicynodontoid genus Turfanodon as a new species, T. jiufengensis. 
Previously, Turfanodon was known only from upper Permian sites in Xinjiang and 
Gansu. The new specimens are referred to Turfanodon based on the following 
characters: snout tall with steeply sloping profile, anterior tip of the snout 
squared off, facial region heavily pitted, nasal bosses present as paired 
swellings near the posterodorsal margin of the external nares, preparietal 
depressed, intertemporal bar long and narrow, premaxilla contacting frontal, 
palatal surface of premaxilla exposed in lateral view, and anterior pterygoid 
keel restricted to the anterior tip of the anterior ramus of the pterygoid. 
Turfanodon jiufengensis is differentiated from the type species, T. bogdaensis, 
by a contact of the lacrimal with the septomaxilla, discrete, raised nasal 
bosses, the dorsal edge of the erupted portion of the canine tusk slightly 
posterior to the anterior orbital margin, an anterior extension of the lacrimal 
distinctly shorter than that of the prefrontal, and a premaxillary dorsal 
surface with a median ridge. The holotype skeleton of T. jiufengensis includes a 
complete axial column with 50 vertebrae (six cervical, 23 dorsal, six sacral, 
and 15 caudal). Turfanodon represents the first confirmed tetrapod genus shared 
by the late Permian faunas of the Junggar and Ordos basins, and appears to be 
the first dicynodont genus distributed across both tropical and temperate zones 
(based on paleoclimate reconstructions). Based on tetrapod fossil content, the 
Naobaogou Formation can be roughly correlated to the Daptocephalus Assemblage 
Zone of South Africa (255-252 Ma in age).

Administration, University of Malaya, 50603 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

University of Malaya, 50603 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

BACKGROUND: We examined whether multidimensional poverty index (MPI) explained 
variations in life expectancy (LE) better than income poverty; and assessed the 
relative importance of MPI indicators in influencing LE.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 62 developing countries were used to run 
several multivariate linear regressions. R2 was used to compare the powers of 
MPI with income-poverties (income poverty gaps [IPG] at 1.9 and 3.1 USD) in 
explaining LE.
RESULTS: Adjusting for controls, both MPI (β =-0.245, P<0.001) and IPG at 3.1 
USD (β=-0.135, P=0.044) significantly correlates with LE, but not IPG at 1.9 USD 
(β=-0.147, P=0.135). MPI explains 12.1% of the variation in LE compared to only 
3.2% explained by IPG at 3.1 USD. The effect of MPI on LE is higher on female 
(β=-0.210, P<0.001) than male (β=-0.177, P<0.001). The relative influence of the 
deprivation indictors on LE ranks as follows (most to least): Asset ownership, 
drinking water, cooking fuel, flooring, child school attendance, years of 
schooling, nutrition, mortality, improved sanitation, and electricity.
CONCLUSION: Interventions to reduce poverty and improve LE should be guided by 
MPI, not income poverty indices. Such policies should be female-oriented and 
prioritized based on the relative influence of the various poverty deprivation 
indicators on LE.

Heart failure (HF) is a common complication or late-stage manifestation of 
various heart diseases. Numerous risk factors and underlying causes may 
contribute to the occurrence and progression of HF. The pathophysiological 
mechanisms of HF are very complicated. Despite accumulating advances in 
treatment for HF during recent decades, it remains an intractable clinical 
syndrome with poor outcomes, significantly reducing the quality of life and 
expectancy of patients, and imposing a heavy economic burden on society and 
families. Although initially classified as antidiabetic agents, sodium-glucose 
co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated reduced the prevalence of 
hospitalization for HF, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death in several 
large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials. These beneficial effects of 
SGLT-2 inhibitors can be attributed to multiple hemodynamic, inflammatory and 
metabolic mechanisms, not only reducing the serum glucose level. SGLT2 
inhibitors have been used increasingly in treatment for patients with HF with 
reduced ejection fraction due to their surprising performance in improving the 
prognosis. In addition, their roles and mechanisms in patients with HF with 
preserved ejection fraction or acute HF have also attracted attention. In this 
review article, we discuss the possible mechanisms and applications of SGLT2 
inhibitors in HF.

BACKGROUND: Tropical Theileriosis caused by Theileria annulata is a tick-borne 
disease which transmitted by the ixodid tick members of the genus Hyalomma. 
Studies on different aspects of disease require to access infective sporozoite 
of parasite which produced by tick vector. This study was carried out to 
establish of T. annulata life cycle to achieve T. annulata infected ticks.
METHODS: Laboratory rabbit and calf were used for rearing of Hyalomma anatolicum 
different instars. Unfed nymphs were fed on T. annulata infected calf. Clinical 
signs, Giemsa stained smears and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methods were 
used for detection of infection in blood and tick specimens. Susceptible calf 
was used for confirmation of sporozoites maturation and infectivity in bioassay 
test.
RESULTS: Hyalomma anatolicum two and three-host strategies of life cycle was 
lasted 90 and 116 days respectively. The PCR confirmed T. annulata infection in 
blood and tick samples. Maturation of T. annulata sporozoites was confirmed in 
bioassy test. First clinical symptom of disease was seen earlier in the case of 
transmission of disease through feeding of live ticks in comparison with blood 
injection method.
CONCLUSION: Complete life cycle of T. annulata was done and confirmed by 
clinical signs, microscopic examination, molecular methods and bioassay test. 
According to published reports to date, this is the first report of 
establishment of H. anatolicum tick infection with T. annulata using susceptible 
calf under controlled conditions in Iran.

Axis-symmetric grooves milled in metallic slabs have been demonstrated to 
promote the transfer of Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) from far- to near-field 
and vice versa, thanks to spin-orbit coupling effects involving Surface Plasmons 
(SP). However, the high absorption losses and the polarization constraints, 
which are intrinsic in plasmonic structures, limit their effectiveness for 
applications in the visible spectrum, particularly if emitters located in close 
proximity to the metallic surface are concerned. Here, an alternative mechanism 
for vortex beam generation is presented, wherein a free-space radiation 
possessing OAM is obtained by diffraction of Bloch Surface Waves (BSWs) on a 
dielectric multilayer. A circularly polarized laser beam is tightly focused on 
the multilayer surface by means of an immersion optics, such that TE-polarized 
BSWs are launched radially from the focused spot. While propagating on the 
multilayer surface, BSWs exhibit a spiral-like wavefront due to the Spin-Orbit 
Interaction (SOI). A spiral grating surrounding the illumination area provides 
for the BSW diffraction out-of-plane and imparts an additional azimuthal 
geometric phase distribution defined by the topological charge of the spiral 
structure. At infinity, the constructive interference results into free-space 
beams with defined combinations of polarization and OAM satisfying the 
conservation of the Total Angular Momentum, based on the incident polarization 
handedness and the spiral grating topological charge. As an extension of this 
concept, chiral diffractive structures for BSWs can be used in combination with 
surface cavities hosting light sources therein.

OBJECTIVES: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is an uncommon progressive 
neurodegenerative disease with no effective cure at present. The initial 
symptoms resemble those of Parkinson's disease; however, the prevalence of PSP 
is about one-tenth that of Parkinson's disease. In many cases, dysphagia is 
severe, and the development of dysphagia is an early predictor of life 
expectancy. The aim of the current study was to define the effects of Lee 
Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD) on swallowing and voice/speech in seven 
patients with PSP.
METHODS: : Each patient underwent swallowing and voice/speech evaluations before 
and after 4 weeks of LSVT. Swallowing motility disorders were defined, temporal
