Cysteamine is currently the only therapy for nephropathic cystinosis. It 
significantly improves life expectancy and delays progression to end-stage 
kidney disease; however, it cannot prevent it. Unfortunately, compliance to 
therapy is often weak, particularly during adolescence. Therefore, finding 
better treatments is a priority in the field of cystinosis. Previously, we found 
that genistein, an isoflavone particularly enriched in soy, can revert part of 
the cystinotic cellular phenotype that is not sensitive to cysteamine in vitro. 
To test the effects of genistein in vivo, we fed 2-month-old wild-type and 
Ctns-/- female mice with either a control diet, a genistein-containing diet or a 
cysteamine-containing diet for 14 months. Genistein (160 mg/kg/day) did not 
affect the growth of the mice or hepatic functionality. Compared with untreated 
mice at 16 months, Ctns-/- mice fed with genistein had lower cystine 
concentrations in their kidneys, reduced formation of cystine crystals, a 
smaller number of LAMP1-positive structures and an overall better-preserved 
parenchymal architecture. Cysteamine (400 mg/kg/day) was efficient in reverting 
the lysosomal phenotype and in preventing the development of renal lesions. 
These preclinical data indicate that genistein ameliorates kidney injury 
resulting from cystinosis with no side effects. Genistein therapy represents a 
potential treatment to improve the outcome for patients with cystinosis.

Update of
    bioRxiv. 2022 Mar 24;:

Phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-seq) allows for unbiased, 
proteome-wide autoantibody discovery across a variety of disease settings, with 
identification of disease-specific autoantigens providing new insight into 
previously poorly understood forms of immune dysregulation. Despite several 
successful implementations of PhIP-seq for autoantigen discovery, including our 
previous work (Vazquez et al., 2020), current protocols are inherently difficult 
to scale to accommodate large cohorts of cases and importantly, healthy 
controls. Here, we develop and validate a high throughput extension of PhIP-seq 
in various etiologies of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including APS1, 
IPEX, RAG1/2 deficiency, Kawasaki disease (KD), multisystem inflammatory 
syndrome in children (MIS-C), and finally, mild and severe forms of COVID-19. We 
demonstrate that these scaled datasets enable machine-learning approaches that 
result in robust prediction of disease status, as well as the ability to detect 
both known and novel autoantigens, such as prodynorphin (PDYN) in APS1 patients, 
and intestinally expressed proteins BEST4 and BTNL8 in IPEX patients. 
Remarkably, BEST4 antibodies were also found in two patients with RAG1/2 
deficiency, one of whom had very early onset IBD. Scaled PhIP-seq examination of 
both MIS-C and KD demonstrated rare, overlapping antigens, including CGNL1, as 
well as several strongly enriched putative pneumonia-associated antigens in 
severe COVID-19, including the endosomal protein EEA1. Together, scaled PhIP-seq 
provides a valuable tool for broadly assessing both rare and common autoantigen 
overlap between autoimmune diseases of varying origins and etiologies.

Diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension are among the five risk factors that 
increase mortality in the world. Both are chronic, non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs), that have a pathophysiological association. Advanced glycation end 
products (AGEs), produced by the lack of glycemic control in diabetic patients, 
interact with their AGE receptors (AGER) resulting in increased arterial 
stiffness, inflammation and endothelial changes - which increases the risk of 
developing hypertension and other complications. We ran a systematic review in 
Pubmed, SciELO, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases using keywords and 
Boolean operators to optimize the search, with the objective of assessing the 
mechanism of non-enzymatic glycation of proteins present in patients with 
diabetes and its correlation with the onset of hypertension, exposing all the 
endothelial and cellular damage caused by AGEs. We found 719 papers, of which 99 
were read in full, and 26 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the 
present review. AGEs should be considered one of the main cardiometabolic risk 
factors. Reducing the AGE-AGER interaction will result in cardiovascular 
protection and increased life expectancy.

Diabetes mellitus e hipertensão arterial estão entre os cinco fatores de risco 
que elevam a mortalidade no mundo. Ambas são doenças crônicas não transmissíveis 
(DCNT) que têm associação fisiopatológica. Os produtos finais de glicação 
avançada (AGEs), produzidos pela falta de controle glicêmico nos pacientes 
diabéticos, interagem com seus receptores para AGEs (RAGE) resultando no aumento 
da rigidez arterial e da inflamação e em alterações endoteliais, fatores que 
intensificam o risco do desenvolvimento da hipertensão e de demais complicações. 
Realizou-se uma revisão sistemática nas bases de dados Pubmed, SciELO, Cochrane 
Library e Web of Science utilizando descritores e operadores booleanos para 
otimizar a busca, com o objetivo de fornecer o mecanismo da glicação não 
enzimática de proteínas presente em pacientes com diabetes e sua correlação com 
o aparecimento da hipertensão, expondo todo o dano endotelial e celular 
ocasionado pelos AGEs. Foram encontrados 719 artigos, dos quais 99 foram lidos 
na íntegra, e 26 atenderam aos critérios de elegibilidade e foram incluídos na 
presente revisão. Os AGEs devem ser considerados um dos principais fatores de 
risco cardiometabólico. A redução da interação AGE-RAGE resultará na proteção 
cardiovascular e no aumento da expectativa de vida.

BACKGROUND: Around 7500 people are diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder 
cancer in the UK annually. Recurrence following transurethral resection of 
bladder tumour is common, and the intensive monitoring schedule required after 
initial treatment has associated costs for patients and the NHS. In photodynamic 
diagnosis, before transurethral resection of bladder tumour, a photosensitiser 
that is preferentially absorbed by tumour cells is instilled intravesically. 
Transurethral resection of bladder tumour is then conducted under blue light, 
causing the photosensitiser to fluoresce. Photodynamic diagnosis-guided 
transurethral resection of bladder tumour offers better diagnostic accuracy than 
standard white-light-guided transurethral resection of bladder tumour, 
potentially reducing the chance of subsequent recurrence.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of photodynamic diagnosis-guided transurethral resection of 
bladder tumour.
DESIGN: This was a multicentre, pragmatic, open-label, parallel-group, 
non-masked, superiority randomised controlled trial. Allocation was by remote 
web-based service, using a 1 : 1 ratio and a minimisation algorithm balanced by 
centre and sex.
SETTING: The setting was 22 NHS hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥ 16 years with a suspected first diagnosis of 
high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, no contraindications to 
photodynamic diagnosis and written informed consent were eligible.
INTERVENTIONS: Photodynamic diagnosis-guided transurethral resection of bladder 
tumour and standard white-light cystoscopy transurethral resection of bladder 
tumour.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary clinical outcome measure was the time to 
recurrence from the date of randomisation to the date of pathologically proven 
first recurrence (or intercurrent bladder cancer death). The primary health 
economic outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained 
at 3 years.
RESULTS: We enrolled 538 participants from 22 UK hospitals between 11 November 
2014 and 6 February 2018. Of these, 269 were allocated to photodynamic diagnosis 
and 269 were allocated to white light. A total of 112 participants were excluded 
from the analysis because of ineligibility (n = 5), lack of non-muscle-invasive 
bladder cancer diagnosis following transurethral resection of bladder tumour 
(n = 89) or early cystectomy (n = 18). In total, 209 photodynamic diagnosis and 
217 white-light participants were included in the clinical end-point analysis 
population. All randomised participants were included in the cost-effectiveness 
analysis. Over a median follow-up period of 21 months for the photodynamic 
diagnosis group and 22 months for the white-light group, there were 86 
recurrences (3-year recurrence-free survival rate 57.8%, 95% confidence interval 
50.7% to 64.2%) in the photodynamic diagnosis group and 84 recurrences (3-year 
recurrence-free survival rate 61.6%, 95% confidence interval 54.7% to 67.8%) in 
the white-light group (hazard ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.28; 
p = 0.70). Adverse event frequency was low and similar in both groups [12 (5.7%) 
in the photodynamic diagnosis group vs. 12 (5.5%) in the white-light group]. At 
3 years, the total cost was £12,881 for photodynamic diagnosis-guided 
transurethral resection of bladder tumour and £12,005 for white light. There was 
no evidence of differences in the use of health services or total cost at 3 
years. At 3 years, the quality-adjusted life-years gain was 2.094 in the 
photodynamic diagnosis transurethral resection of bladder tumour group and 2.087 
in the white light group. The probability that photodynamic diagnosis-guided 
transurethral resection of bladder tumour was cost-effective was never > 30% 
over the range of society's cost-effectiveness thresholds.
LIMITATIONS: Fewer patients than anticipated were correctly diagnosed with 
intermediate- to high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer before 
transurethral resection of bladder tumour and the ratio of intermediate- to 
high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer was higher than expected, reducing 
the number of observed recurrences and the statistical power.
CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic diagnosis-guided transurethral resection of bladder 
tumour did not reduce recurrences, nor was it likely to be cost-effective 
compared with white light at 3 years. Photodynamic diagnosis-guided 
transurethral resection of bladder tumour is not supported in the management of 
primary intermediate- to high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
FUTURE WORK: Further work should include the modelling of appropriate 
surveillance schedules and exploring predictive and prognostic biomarkers.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as ISRCTN84013636.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care 
Research ( NIHR ) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published 
in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 26, No. 40. See the NIHR Journals 
Library website for further project information.

Plain Language Summary: Around 7500 people are diagnosed with early-stage 
bladder cancer in the UK each year. Early bladder cancer is contained within the 
bladder and has not yet invaded the bladder’s muscle wall or spread elsewhere in 
the body. The cancer will return (recur) in around half of people after initial 
treatment and they have to attend hospital for regular check-ups, with costs to 
both them and the NHS. The first step in treating early bladder cancer is 
surgery to remove the tumour. This surgery is normally performed under white 
light. Photodynamic diagnosis is a new technique in which a liquid is put into 
the patient’s bladder before surgery and a blue light is used during the 
operation. This causes the bladder cancer to fluoresce so that it can be seen 
more easily by the surgeon. The Photodynamic versus white-light-guided resection 
of first diagnosis non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer ( PHOTO ) trial aimed to 
find out whether or not using photodynamic diagnosis at initial surgery would 
reduce how often the cancer recurred and whether or not this could reduce the 
cost of treating early bladder cancer. A total of 538 people with early bladder 
cancer who had a medium to high chance of their cancer returning after treatment 
were enrolled in the PHOTO trial. They were included in one of two treatment 
groups, at random: 269 had photodynamic surgery and 269 had standard white-light 
surgery. People in both groups were monitored regularly for any recurrences, 
with further treatment as appropriate. After 3 years, 4 out of 10 people in each 
group had a recurrence of their bladder cancer. We found no difference between 
the treatment groups in the number of people with recurrences. We found no 
evidence of a benefit to patients, and the total costs of photodynamic surgery 
were higher than those of standard white light. We therefore recommend that it 
is no longer used in the treatment of this group of patients.

INTRODUCTION: A major contributor to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
progression and severity is a dysregulated innate and adaptive immune response. 
Interleukin-38 (IL-38) is an IL-1 family member with broad anti-inflammatory 
properties, but thus far little is known about its role in viral infections. 
Recent studies have shown inconsistent results, as one study finding an increase 
in circulating IL-38 in COVID-19 patients in comparison to healthy controls, 
whereas two other studies report no differences in IL-38 concentrations.
METHODS: Here, we present an exploratory, retrospective cohort study of 
circulating IL-38 concentrations in hospitalized COVID-19 patients admitted to 
two Dutch hospitals (discovery n = 148 and validation n = 184) and age- and 
sex-matched healthy subjects. Plasma IL-38 concentrations were measured by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, disease-related proteins by proximity 
extension assay, and clinical data were retrieved from hospital records.
RESULTS: IL-38 concentrations were stable during hospitalization and similar to 
those of healthy control subjects. IL-38 was not associated with rates of 
intensive care unit admission or mortality. Only in men in the discovery cohort, 
IL-38 concentrations were positively correlated with hospitalization duration. A 
positive correlation between IL-38 and the inflammatory biomarker d-dimer was 
observed in men of the validation cohort. In women of the validation 
cohort, IL-38 concentrations correlated negatively with thrombocyte numbers. 
Furthermore, plasma IL-38 concentrations in the validation cohort correlated 
positively with TNF, TNFRSF9, IL-10Ra, neurotrophil 3, polymeric immunoglobulin 
receptor, CHL1, CD244, superoxide dismutase 2, and fatty acid binding protein 
2, and negatively with SERPINA12 and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that IL-38 is not associated with disease 
outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, moderate correlations 
between IL-38 concentrations and biomarkers of disease were identified in one of 
two cohorts. While we demonstrate that IL-38 concentrations are not indicative 
of COVID-19 severity, its anti-inflammatory effects may reduce COVID-19 severity 
and should be experimentally investigated.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to report the burden of bulimia nervosa (BN) in the Middle 
East and North Africa (MENA) region by age, sex, and sociodemographic index 
(SDI), for the period 1990-2019.
METHODS: Estimates of the prevalence, incidence, and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) attributable to BN were retrieved from the Global Burden of 
Disease study 2019, between 1990 and 2019, for the 21 countries in the MENA 
region. The counts and age-standardized rates (per 100,000) were presented, 
along with their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals.
RESULTS: In 2019, the estimated regional age-standardized point prevalence and 
incidence rates of BN were 168.3 (115.0-229.6) and 178.6 (117.0-255.6) per 
100,000, which represented 22.0% (17.5-27.2) and 10.4% (7.1-14.7) increases, 
respectively, since 1990. Moreover, in 2019 the regional age-standardized DALY 
rate was 35.5 (20.6-55.5) per 100,000, which was 22.2% (16.7-28.2) higher than 
in 1990. In 2019, Qatar (58.6 [34.3-92.5]) and Afghanistan (18.4 [10.6-29.2]) 
had the highest and lowest age-standardized DALY rates, respectively. 
Regionally, the age-standardized point prevalence of BN peaked in the 30-34 age 
group and was more prevalent among women. In addition, there was a generally 
positive association between SDI and the burden of BN across the measurement 
period.
DISCUSSION: In the MENA region, the burden of BN has increased over the last 
three decades. Cost-effective preventive measures are needed in the region, 
especially in the high SDI countries.
PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: This study reports the estimated burden of BN in the MENA 
region and shows that its burden has increased over the last three decades.

health outcomes for the BRICS economies. The long-run results of the ARDL-PMG 
infer that CO2 has a significant negative in the life expectancy model while it 
has a significant positive in the death rate model. These findings imply that 
the rise in CO2 emissions reduces life expectancy and increases the death rate 
in BRICS economies. On the other side, the estimates of environmental innovation 
and environmental policy stringency are positively significant in the life 
expectancy model; however, in the death rate model, the estimate of 
environmental innovation is insignificant, and environmental policy stringency 
is negatively significant in the death rate model. In a nutshell, the findings 
imply that CO2 emissions exacerbate health problems, environmental innovations, 
and environmental policy stringency, improving the health status of the people. 
Our findings suggest that the BRICS economies should revisit their environmental 
policies for the betterment of human health.

Fenfluramine, tradename Fintepla®, was appraised within the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) single technology appraisal (STA) process 
as Technology Appraisal 808. Within the STA process, the company (Zogenix 
International) provided NICE with a written submission and a mathematical health 
economic model, summarising the company's estimates of the clinical 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of fenfluramine for patients with Dravet 
syndrome (DS). This company submission (CS) was reviewed by an evidence review 
group (ERG) independent of NICE. The ERG, Kleijnen Systematic Reviews in 
collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Centre, produced an ERG report. 
This paper presents a summary of the ERG report and the development of the NICE 
guidance. The CS included a systematic review of the evidence for fenfluramine. 
From this review the company identified and presented evidence from two 
randomised trials (Study 1 and Study 1504), an open-label extension study (Study 
1503) and 'real world evidence' from a prospective and retrospective study. Both 
randomised trials were conducted in patients up to 18 years of age with DS, 
whose seizures were incompletely controlled with previous anti-epileptic drugs. 
A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to compare fenfluramine with 
cannabidiol plus clobazam. There was no evidence of a difference between any 
doses of fenfluramine and cannabidiol in the mean convulsive seizure frequency 
(CSF) rate during treatment. However, fenfluramine increased the number of 
patients achieving ≥ 50% reduction in CSF frequency from baseline compared to 
cannabidiol. The company used an individual-patient state-transition model (R 
version 3.5.2) to model cost-effectiveness of fenfluramine. The CSF and 
convulsive seizure-free days were estimated using patient-level data from the 
placebo arm of the fenfluramine registration studies. Subsequently, a treatment 
effect of either fenfluramine or cannabidiol was applied. Utility values for the 
economic model were obtained by mapping Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory data 
from the registration studies to EuroQol-5D-3L Youth (EQ-5D-Y-3L). The company 
included caregiver utilities in their base-case, as the severe needs of patients 
with DS have a major impact on parents and caregivers. There were several key 
issues. First, the company included caregiver utilities in the model in a way 
that when patients in the economic model died, the corresponding caregiver 
utility was also set to zero. Second, the model was built in R statistical 
software, resulting in transparency issues. Third, the company assumed the same 
percentage reduction for convulsive seizure days as was estimated for CSF. 
Fourth, during the final appraisal committee meeting, influential changes were 
made to the model that were not in line with the ERG's preferences (but were 
accepted by the appraisal committee). The company's revised and final 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) in line with committee preferences 
resulted in fenfluramine dominating cannabidiol. Fenfluramine was recommended as 
an add-on to other antiepileptic medicines for treating seizures associated with 
DS in people aged 2 years and older in the National Health Service (NHS).

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy and quality of life of people living with HIV have 
been dramatically improved after introducing antiretroviral therapy, and the 
prevalence of non-communicable diseases has increased. Several studies have 
found that hyperglycemia with or without type 2 diabetes was associated with 
poor outcomes in people living with HIV. The study's objective was to determine 
the prevalence of hyperglycemia and assess its impact on mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among people 
living with HIV diagnosed in 2012-2018 and followed through 2020 at the 
Infectious Diseases, AIDS and Clinical Immunology Research Center in Tbilisi, 
Georgia. Primary outcomes of interest included the prevalence of hyperglycemia 
and mortality. Causes of death were classified according to the Coding of Death 
in HIV (CoDe) protocol.
RESULTS: Our study included 2914 people living with HIV. Two hundred and 
forty-two (8.3%) patients had hyperglycemia, with an increasing prevalence by 
age. Three hundred one (9.7%) participants died over the median 3.71 (IQR: 
2.14-5.37) years of follow-up. Among these, 139 (46.2%) were due to AIDS- 
related causes, 123 (40.9%)-were due to non-AIDS causes, and in 39 (12.9%) 
cases, the cause of death could not be determined. Overall, the cohort 
contributed to 11,148 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), translating into a 
mortality rate of 2.70 deaths per 100 PYFU. The mortality rate was significantly 
higher among individuals with hyperglycemia-11.17 deaths per 100 PYFU vs 2.07 
deaths per 100 PYFU among normoglycemic patients(p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia was associated with increased odds of mortality. 
Screening and management of hyperglycemia should be integrated into routine HIV 
clinical services as part of a comprehensive care package.

BACKGROUND: Water is essential for maintaining human life, health, and dignity. 
Untreated water consumption causes 1.8 million deaths annually, over 99.8% of 
which happen in developing nations and 90% of which include children. 
Point-of-use water treatment enables people without reliable access to safe 
drinking water to reduce contamination and minimize microbial risk levels. This 
Systematic Review and Meta-analysis was, therefore, used to identify, select, 
and critically appraise relevant evidence about water treatment practices and 
their associated factors among Ethiopian households.
METHODS: PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, 
ProQuest, and other databases were searched for studies published before May 5, 
2022. The final synthesis included twelve investigations. Microsoft Excel was 
used to extract the data, and STATA 16 was used for the analysis. The Joanna 
Briggs Institute's Critical assessment checklist for prevalence studies was used 
to evaluate the quality of the included studies. Egger's test and funnel plot 
were used to assess publication bias. I2 statistics were calculated to check for 
study heterogeneity. The DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to 
analyze the pooled effect size, odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals across 
studies. Analysis of subgroups was done by publication year and geographic 
region.
RESULTS: Of the 550 identified articles, 12 studies were eligible for analysis 
(n = 4849 participants). The pooled prevalence estimate of point-of-use water 
treatment practice among Ethiopian homes was 36.07% (95% CI: 21.94-50.19, I2 = 
99.5%). Receiving training from Community health workers (OR, 1.7; 95% CI: 
1.33-2.08), female headship (OR, 2.52; 95% CI: 1.60-3.44), and household wealth 
(OR, 1.6; 95% CI: 1.19-2.16) were significantly associated with point-of-use 
water treatment practice.
CONCLUSION: Despite the absence of safely managed water sources, very few homes 
routinely treated their drinking water. Adoption of water treatment practices 
necessitates ongoing communication and assistance from health extension 
personnel. Moreover, program planners must be aware of the many user categories 
that households may fall under to guarantee that ongoing training messages and 
treatment products reach every home.

The burden of osteoarthritis (OA) has increased steadily due to an aging 
population, increasing life expectancy, obesity and lifestyle factors. Total hip 
replacement has become one of the most prevalent and successful operations 
globally and it is projected that demand will continue to grow as the incidence 
of OA continues to increase. Patients undergoing the operation expect 
much-improved function and pain relief but also increasingly need to return to 
work postoperatively, especially given the growing demand for the procedure and 
the encouragement of older people to continue working by most governments in the 
developed world. This review provides an overview of function and employment 
outcomes after hip arthroplasty. Despite the generally good success rate, some 
patients do not attain good functional outcomes and it is important that we 
develop ways to identify these patients preoperatively. We describe the effect 
of demographic, clinical and other factors on functional outcomes, as well as 
trajectories of physical function and pain recovery beyond the first few weeks 
after total hip replacement. Regarding employment outcomes, many people in work 
preoperatively are likely to resume to work after recovery; however, patients 
feel that they lack guidance from clinicians about returning to work 
postoperatively. Our review encompasses factors associated with return to work, 
timing of return to work, and potential temporary or permanent limitations that 
people might experience at work depending on type of employment.

PURPOSE: The recently developed European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology 
(ESTRO)/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 
oligometastatic disease (OMD) classification has not been validated in terms of 
its prognostic significance. This study stratified patients from the phase II 
SABR-5 trial based on ESTRO/EORTC criteria and compared progression-free 
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) to determine the prognostic 
significance of the classification scheme.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The SABR-5 trial was a single arm phase II study 
conducted at the 6 regional cancer centers across British Columbia (BC), Canada, 
where SABR for oligometastases was only offered on trial. Patients with up to 5 
oligometastases (total or not controlled by prior treatment and including 
induced OMD) underwent SABR to all lesions. Patients were 18 years of age or 
older, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2, and life expectancy ≥6 months. 
PFS and OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and differences between 
OMD groups were assessed with log-rank tests. Univariable and multivariable 
analyses were performed using Cox regression modeling.
RESULTS: Between November 2016 and July 2020, 381 patients underwent SABR on 
trial. Median follow-up was 27 months (interquartile range, 18-36). The most 
frequent OMD group was de novo OMD (69%), followed by repeat (16%) and induced 
(13%). OMD groups differed significantly in PFS (P < .001) but not OS 
(P = .069). The OMD classification was an independent predictor of both PFS 
(P = .005) and OS (P = .002). Of the 5 classification factors, only chronicity 
(synchronous, hazard ratio, 0.52; P = .027) and oligoprogression (hazard ratio, 
2.05; P = .004) were independently prognostic for OS.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective cohort, the ESTRO/EORTC classification 
was an independent predictor of PFS and OS and should be used to identify 
specific patient groups for clinical trials. In this trial population, the 
prognostic power is largely attributable to chronicity and oligoprogression. 
Simplification of the framework may be possible in the future and allow for 
greater ease of use; however, further data on underrepresented OMD groups and 
histologies will be required.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate cost-effectiveness and costs of fall prevention 
exercise programmes for older adults.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, National Institute for 
Health Research Economic Evaluation Database, Health Technology Assessment 
database, Tufts Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, Research Papers in 
Economics and EconLit (inception to May 2022).
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION: Economic evaluations (trial-based or 
model-based) and costing studies investigating fall prevention exercise 
programmes versus no intervention or usual care for older adults living in the 
community or care facilities, and reporting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) for fall-related outcomes or quality-adjusted life years (QALY, expressed 
as cost/QALY) and/or intervention costs.
RESULTS: 31 studies were included. For community-dwelling older adults (21 
economic evaluations, 6 costing studies), results ranged from more effective and 
less costly (dominant) interventions up to an ICER of US$279 802/QALY gained and 
US$11 986/fall prevented (US$ in 2020). Assuming an arbitrary willingness-to-pay 
threshold (US$100 000/QALY), most results (17/24) were considered cost-effective 
(moderate certainty). The greatest value for money (lower ICER/QALY gained and 
fall prevented) appeared to accrue for older adults and those with high fall 
risk, but unsupervised exercise appeared to offer poor value for money (higher 
ICER/QALY). For care facilities (two economic evaluations, two costing studies), 
ICERs ranged from dominant (low certainty) to US$35/fall prevented (moderate 
certainty). Overall, intervention costs varied and were poorly reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Most economic evaluations investigated fall prevention exercise 
programmes for older adults living in the community. There is moderate certainty 
evidence that fall prevention exercise programmes are likely to be 
cost-effective. The evidence for older adults living in care facilities is more 
limited but promising.

Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is an X-linked disorder. Several 
male patients with OTCD suffer from severe hyperammonemic crisis in the neonatal 
period, whereas others develop late-onset manifestations, including 
hyperammonemic coma. Females with heterozygous pathogenic variants in the OTC 
gene may develop a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic 
conditions to severe hyperammonemic attacks, owing to skewed lyonization. We 
reported the variants of CPS1, ASS, ASL and OTC detected in the patients with 
urea cycle disorders through a nation-wide survey in Japan. In this study, we 
updated the variant data of OTC in Japanese patients and acquired information 
regarding genetic variants of OTC from patients with OTCD through an extensive 
literature review. The 523 variants included 386 substitution (330 missense, 53 
nonsense, and 3 silent), eight deletion, two duplication, one 
deletion-insertion, 55 frame shift, two extension, and 69 no category (1 
regulatory and 68 splice site error) mutations. We observed a genotype-phenotype 
relation between the onset time (neonatal onset or late onset), the severity, 
and genetic mutation in male OTCD patients because the level of deactivation of 
OTC significantly depends on the pathogenic OTC variants. In conclusion, genetic 
information about OTC may help to predict long-term outcomes and determine 
specific treatment strategies, such as liver transplantation, in patients with 
OTCD.

The lingzhi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum) is well known for its medicinal 
properties and has long played a role in traditional oriental medicine due to 
its health-giving benefits and potential to extend life expectancy. The mushroom 
contains a number of highly bioactive compounds and can also act as an excellent 
source of protein. This research investigated the peptides obtained from the 
protein hydrolysates of lingzhi mushrooms to assess their free radical 
scavenging abilities. These peptides were acquired via different proteases 
(Alcalase, Neutrase, papain, and pepsin-pancreatin) and were tested at a range 
of different concentrations (1.0%, 2.5%, and 5.0% w/v). The highest levels of 
2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), 
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging 
activities were presented by lingzhi mushroom hydrolysate using 2.5% (w/v) 
pepsin-pancreatin after 6 h of digestion. The hydrolysate was then fractionated 
using 10, 5, 3, and 0.65 kDa molecular weight cut-off membranes. The results 
showed that the MW 0.65 kDa fraction had the highest level of free radical 
scavenging activity. Further analysis of this MW 0.65 kDa fraction began with 
another RP-HPLC fractionation technique to obtain three further sub-fractions. 
De novo peptide sequencing using electrospray ionization quadrupole 
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS) was chosen as the optimum 
method for studying the F3 sub-fraction. DRVSIYGWG and ALLSISSF were discovered 
as new peptides with different antioxidant properties. Adenocarcinoma colon 
(Caco-2) cells showed the antioxidant action of these synthesized peptides. This 
activity was linked to peptide concentration. The peptides and their pure 
synthetic counterparts were found to reduce NO generation by RAW 264.7 
macrophages without causing cytotoxicity. The results of gene expression reveal 
that the DRVSIYGWG and ALLSISSF peptides were able to cut the expression of the 
proinflammatory cytokine genes iNOS, IL-6, TNF-α, and COX-2 in the context of 
RAW 264.7 macrophages.
