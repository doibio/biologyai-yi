BACKGROUND: Despite recent therapeutic advances, life expectancy in persons with 
congenital hemophilia A (PwcHA) remains below that of the non-HA population. As 
new therapies are introduced, a uniform approach to the assessment of mortality 
is required for comprehensive evaluation of risk-benefit profiles, timely 
identification of emerging safety signals, and comparisons between treatments.
OBJECTIVES: Develop and test a framework for consistent reporting and analysis 
of mortality across past, current, and future therapies.
PATIENTS/METHODS: We identified known causes of mortality in PwcHA through 
literature review, analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event 
Reporting System (FAERS) database, and expert insights. Leading causes of death 
in general populations are those recognized by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention and the World Health Organization. We developed an algorithm for 
assessing fatalities in PwcHA and used this to categorize FAERS data as a proof 
of concept.
RESULTS: PwcHA share mortality causes with the non-HA population including 
cardiovascular disease, malignancy, infections, pulmonary disease, dementias, 
and trauma/suicide. Causes associated with HA include hemorrhage, thrombosis, 
human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and liver dysfunction. We 
propose an algorithm employing these classes to categorize fatalities and use it 
to classify FAERS fatality data between 01/01/2000 and 03/31/2020; the most 
common causes were hemorrhage (22.2%) and thrombosis (10.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: A conceptual framework for examining mortality in PwcHA receiving 
any hemophilia therapy is proposed to analyze and interpret fatalities, enabling 
consistent and objective assessment. Application of the framework using FAERS 
data suggests a generally consistent pattern of reported mortality across HA 
treatments, supporting the utility of this unified approach.

This study had two objectives: (a) revealing kinetic parameter differences at 
the fingers during a fastball and curveball, and (b) examining timing control 
between the wrist and finger torques. The participants were eight baseball 
pitchers. The kinetics of the wrist and fingers were calculated using an inverse 
dynamics method. The peak torque and work of finger adduction during the 
curveball was significantly larger than that during the fastball. During the 
fastball pitch, the maximal correlation coefficient between the wrist flexion 
torque and finger flexion torque was very high (r = 0.94 ± 0.05). The reasons 
for this result are twofold: (a) the extrinsic finger muscles cross the wrist 
(biarticular muscle) and (b) the wrist flexion torque during the fastball pitch 
acts in the direction of acceleration of the ball. During the curveball pitch, 
we found two typical types of wrist and finger torque control. Furthermore, the 
two pitchers exerted large wrist extension and radial torque, and finger 
adduction torque. Although the other six pitchers hardly exerted these torques, 
they exerted wrist flexion torque predominantly. It was considered that the six 
pitchers selected wrist flexion torque as the control for the fastball and 
curveball pitch to confuse the batter.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common life-shortening genetic condition 
caused by a variant in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR) protein. A class II CFTR variant F508del (found in up to 90% of people 
with CF (pwCF)) is the commonest CF-causing variant. The faulty protein is 
degraded before reaching the cell membrane, where it needs to be to effect 
transepithelial salt transport. The F508del variant lacks meaningful CFTR 
function and corrective therapy could benefit many pwCF. Therapies in this 
review include single correctors and any combination of correctors and 
potentiators.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of CFTR correctors (with or without 
potentiators) on clinically important benefits and harms in pwCF of any age with 
class II CFTR mutations (most commonly F508del).
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders 
Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, reference lists of relevant articles and online 
trials registries. Most recent search: 14 October 2020.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (parallel design) 
comparing CFTR correctors to control in pwCF with class II mutations.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data, assessed 
risk of bias and evidence quality (GRADE); we contacted investigators for 
additional data.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 19 RCTs (2959 participants), lasting between 1 day and 
24 weeks; an extension of two lumacaftor-ivacaftor studies provided additional 
96-week safety data (1029 participants). We assessed eight monotherapy RCTs (344 
participants) (4PBA, CPX, lumacaftor, cavosonstat and FDL169), six dual-therapy 
RCTs (1840 participants) (lumacaftor-ivacaftor or tezacaftor-ivacaftor) and five 
triple-therapy RCTs (775 participants) (elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor or 
VX-659-tezacaftor-ivacaftor); below we report only the data from 
elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor combination which proceeded to Phase 3 trials. 
In 14 RCTs participants had F508del/F508del genotypes, in three RCTs 
F508del/minimal function (MF) genotypes and in two RCTs both genotypes. Risk of 
bias judgements varied across different comparisons. Results from 11 RCTs may 
not be applicable to all pwCF due to age limits (e.g. adults only) or 
non-standard design (converting from monotherapy to combination therapy). 
Monotherapy Investigators reported no deaths or clinically-relevant improvements 
in quality of life (QoL). There was insufficient evidence to determine any 
important effects on lung function. No placebo-controlled monotherapy RCT 
demonstrated differences in mild, moderate or severe adverse effects (AEs); the 
clinical relevance of these events is difficult to assess with their variety and 
small number of participants (all F508del/F508del). Dual therapy Investigators 
reported no deaths (moderate- to high-quality evidence). QoL scores (respiratory 
domain) favoured both lumacaftor-ivacaftor and tezacaftor-ivacaftor therapy 
compared to placebo at all time points. At six months lumacaftor 600 mg or 400 
mg (both once daily) plus ivacaftor improved Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ) 
scores slightly compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 2.62 points (95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 4.59); 1061 participants; high-quality 
evidence). A similar effect was observed for twice-daily lumacaftor (200 mg) 
plus ivacaftor (250 mg), but with low-quality evidence (MD 2.50 points (95% CI 
0.10 to 5.10)). The mean increase in CFQ scores with twice-daily tezacaftor (100 
mg) and ivacaftor (150 mg) was approximately five points (95% CI 3.20 to 7.00; 
504 participants; moderate-quality evidence). At six months, the relative change 
in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % predicted improved with 
combination therapies compared to placebo by: 5.21% with once-daily 
lumacaftor-ivacaftor (95% CI 3.61% to 6.80%; 504 participants; high-quality 
evidence); 2.40% with twice-daily lumacaftor-ivacaftor (95% CI 0.40% to 4.40%; 
204 participants; low-quality evidence); and 6.80% with tezacaftor-ivacaftor 
(95% CI 5.30 to 8.30%; 520 participants; moderate-quality evidence). More pwCF 
reported early transient breathlessness with lumacaftor-ivacaftor, odds ratio 
2.05 (99% CI 1.10 to 3.83; 739 participants; high-quality evidence). Over 120 
weeks (initial study period and follow-up) systolic blood pressure rose by 5.1 
mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 4.1 mmHg with twice-daily 400 mg 
lumacaftor-ivacaftor (80 participants; high-quality evidence). The 
tezacaftor-ivacaftor RCTs did not report these adverse effects. Pulmonary 
exacerbation rates decreased in pwCF receiving additional therapies to ivacaftor 
compared to placebo: lumacaftor 600 mg hazard ratio (HR) 0.70 (95% CI 0.57 to 
0.87; 739 participants); lumacaftor 400 mg, HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.76; 740 
participants); and tezacaftor, HR 0.64 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.89; 506 participants) 
(moderate-quality evidence). Triple therapy Three RCTs of elexacaftor to 
tezacaftor-ivacaftor in pwCF (aged 12 years and older with either one or two 
F508del variants) reported no deaths (high-quality evidence). All other evidence 
was graded as moderate quality. In 403 participants with F508del/minimal 
function (MF) elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor improved QoL respiratory scores 
(MD 20.2 points (95% CI 16.2 to 24.2)) and absolute change in FEV1 (MD 14.3% 
predicted (95% CI 12.7 to 15.8)) compared to placebo at 24 weeks. At four weeks 
in 107 F508del/F508del participants, elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor improved 
QoL respiratory scores (17.4 points (95% CI 11.9 to 22.9)) and absolute change 
in FEV1 (MD 10.0% predicted (95% CI 7.5 to 12.5)) compared to 
tezacaftor-ivacaftor. There was probably little or no difference in the number 
or severity of AEs between elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor and placebo or 
control (moderate-quality evidence). In 403 F508del/F508del participants, there 
was a longer time to protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbation with 
elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor over 24 weeks (moderate-quality evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence that corrector monotherapy 
has clinically important effects in pwCF with F508del/F508del. Both dual 
therapies (lumacaftor-ivacaftor, tezacaftor-ivacaftor) result in similar 
improvements in QoL and respiratory function with lower pulmonary exacerbation 
rates. Lumacaftor-ivacaftor was associated with an increase in early transient 
shortness of breath and longer-term increases in blood pressure (not observed 
for tezacaftor-ivacaftor). Tezacaftor-ivacaftor has a better safety profile, 
although data are lacking in children under 12 years. In this population, 
lumacaftor-ivacaftor had an important impact on respiratory function with no 
apparent immediate safety concerns; but this should be balanced against the 
blood pressure increase and shortness of breath seen in longer-term adult data 
when considering lumacaftor-ivacaftor. There is high-quality evidence of 
clinical efficacy with probably little or no difference in AEs for triple 
(elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor) therapy in pwCF with one or two F508del 
variants aged 12 years or older. Further RCTs are required in children (under 12 
years) and those with more severe respiratory function.

In the treatment of obesity in adults, exercise intervention is recommended and 
some people with obesity even prefer exercise above dietary intervention as a 
single weight-loss strategy. However, evidence is accumulating that the 
long-term body weight and adipose tissue mass loss ​as a result of exercise 
intervention in these individuals is disappointingly small. Although this could 
be related to various clinical reasons, more recent evidence reveals that also 
(patho)physiological abnormalities are involved which cannot be remediated by 
exercise intervention, especially in metabolically compromised patients. As a 
result, the role and importance of exercise intervention in the treatment of 
obesity deserve significant reconsideration to avoid confusion and 
disappointment amongst clinicians, patients and society. Hence, to reduce 
adipose tissue mass and body weight, dietary intervention is much more effective 
than exercise intervention, and is, therefore, of key importance in this 
endeavour. However, dietary interventions must be supplemented by exercise 
training to induce clinically relevant changes in specific cardiovascular or 
metabolic risk factors like blood pressure, blood triglycerides and high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, as well as visceral adipose tissue mass, 
physical fitness, muscle mass and strength, quality of life and life expectancy. 
This allows individuals with obesity to preserve their cardiometabolic health or 
to shift from a metabolically unhealthy phenotype to a metabolically healthy 
phenotype. Signifying the true clinical value of exercise interventions might 
lead to a better understanding and appreciation of the goals and associated 
effects when implemented in the multidisciplinary treatment of obesity, for 
which a proper tailoring of exercise prescription is required.

Waikato, Hamilton.

AIM: To describe the context surrounding the deaths of homeless people in New 
Zealand and to determine the proportion of deaths that could be considered 
amenable to healthcare.
METHOD: We used coroners' findings related to 171 deaths of persons with "no 
fixed abode" at the time of death, from 2008 to 2019. Recent lists of amenable 
mortality from the New Zealand Ministry of Health and the Office of National 
Statistics in the UK were combined to determine the rate of amenable mortality.
RESULTS: The life expectancy of homeless persons identified in this sample was 
30 years shorter than in the housed population, with a mean age of death of 45.7 
years. Deaths occurred mainly alone, in public spaces (56.1%) or in private 
vehicles (14%). Three-quarters (75.8%) of homeless persons died from conditions 
amenable to timely and effective healthcare interventions, mostly from natural 
causes (45.7%) and suicide (41.5%).
CONCLUSION: Homeless people experience considerable challenges when accessing 
the healthcare system, as uncovered by the dramatic rate of amenable mortality. 
Our findings highlight the urgent need to implement specific models of care that 
are designed to meet the social and healthcare needs of homeless persons and 
address the significant health inequalities they experience.

Accelerated whole-body protein catabolism in subjects with type 2 Diabetes 
Mellitus and albuminuria.

BACKGROUND: Albuminuria develops in ~40% of subjects with Type 2 Diabetes 
Mellitus (T2DM), and is often associated with malnutrition, severe comorbidities 
and decreased life expectancy. The association between albuminuria and altered 
whole body protein turnover in T2DM is currently unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whole body protein degradation and synthesis in type 2 
diabetes with and without albuminuria.
METHODS: Fourteen T2DM male subjects, with either increased [AER+] or normal 
[AER-] urinary albumin excretion rate, and eleven age-matched male healthy 
controls, were infused with phenylalanine [Phe] and tyrosine [Tyr] tracers. 
Post-absorptive rates of appearance (Ra) of Phe (= protein degradation) and Tyr, 
Phe hydroxylation to Tyr (Hy) (catabolic pathway), and Phe disposal to protein 
synthesis [PS], were determined.
RESULTS: Phe and Tyr Ra were not different among the groups. However, in T2DM 
[AER+], the fraction of Phe disposal to hydroxylation was ~50% and ~25% greater 
than that of both controls and T2DM [AER-] (p<0.006 and p = 0.17, respectively). 
Conversely, as compared to controls, the fractional Phe disposal to PS was ~10% 
lower in T2DM [AER+] (p<0.006), and not different from that in T2DM [AER-]. As a 
consequence, in T2DM [AER+], the ratio between the fractional Phe disposal to 
hydroxylation and that to PS was ~70% greater (p = 0.005) than that in healthy 
controls, whereas in the T2DM [AER-] this ratio was ~30% greater than in 
controls (p = 0.19).
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the kinetics of the essential amino acid 
phenylalanine, T2DM subjects with increased AER exhibit a catabolic pattern of 
whole body protein turnover.

The incidence of spinal metastasis (SpM) is increasing, and life expectancy for 
patients with malignancy is also rising. The "elderly" represent a population 
with steady growth in SpM proportion. Bracing is associated with lower survival. 
We believe that surgery should be considered, regardless of the patient's age.

Plain Language Summary: Multicentric prospective study. Through this study, we 
aimed to clarify and update the prognostic assessment of elderly with spine 
metastasis (SpM). The incidence SpM is rising, in parallel life expectancy is 
getting longer and the number of elderly patients presenting malignancy is 
increasing. Elderly patients with SpM constitute a growing heterogeneous 
population The patient data used in this study were obtained from a French 
national multicenter database of patients treated for SpM between 2014 and 2017. 
Two hundred and forty-three consecutive patients >70 years’ old were diagnosed. 
Median overall survival (OS) time for elderly patients following the event of 
SpM was 16.3 months. First, we identified significantly worse survival 
prognostic factors for elderly patients with SpM: poor WHO status 3/4: (hazard 
ratio [HR]: 2.245, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.899–2.655; P  < 0.0001), >80 
years (HR: 1.758, 95% CI 1.117–2.765; P  = 0.015) no-ambulatory neurological 
status (Franckel A/B status [HR: 3.219, 95% CI 1.621–6.390; P  < 0.0001)], 
gastrointestinal cancer (HR: 3.530, 95% CI 1.75–7.1; P  < 0.0001), lung cancer 
(HR: 3.452, 95% CI 1.784–6.680; P  < 0.0001), orthopedic brace treatment (HR: 
1.329; 95% CI 1.050–1.683; P  = 0.018), and epiduritis (HR: 1.52, 95% CI 
1.041–2.22; P  = 0.03) were independently poor prognostic factors of survival. 
The only good prognosis factor identified was thyroid cancer (HR: 0.257, 95% CI 
0.07–0.952; P  = 0.04). Prognosis factors concerning the survival of elderly 
patients seem to be the same as those for the general population such as primary 
cancer histology, neurological status, WHO status, and epiduritis. Age >80 years 
also appears to be an independently poor prognosis factor. Our data suggest that 
orthopedic brace treatment is also associated with lower survival. Level of 
Evidence: 2.

This study aimed to clarify whether ossification predisposition influences 
clinical symptoms including pain, restriction of activities of daily living, and 
quality of life in patients with cervical ossification of the posterior 
longitudinal ligament (OPLL). Cervical ossification predisposition potentially 
causes neurologic dysfunction, but the relationship between clinical symptoms 
and radiologic severity of OPLL has not yet been investigated. Data were 
prospectively collected from 16 institutions across Japan. We enrolled 239 
patients with cervical OPLL. The primary outcomes were patient-reported 
outcomes, including visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and other 
questionnaires. Whole-spine computed tomography images were obtained, and 
correlations were investigated between clinical symptoms and radiologic 
findings, including the distribution of OPLL, the sum of the levels where OPLL 
was present (OP-index), and the canal narrowing ratio (CNR) grade. The cervical 
OP-index was Grade 1 in 113 patients, Grade 2 in 90, and Grade 3 in 36. No 
significant correlations were found between radiologic outcomes and VAS pain 
scores. The cervical OP-index was associated with lower extremity function, 
social dysfunction, and locomotive function. The CNR grade was not correlated 
with clinical symptoms, but Grade 4 was associated with lower extremity 
dysfunction. Thickness and extension of ossified lesions may be associated with 
lower extremity dysfunction in cervical OPLL.

BACKGROUND: In August 2018, the US FDA granted accelerated approval for 
nivolumab in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has progressed after 
platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other line of therapy. The 
objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab vs. 
usual care as third-line (3 L) therapy for patients with recurrent SCLC (rSCLC) 
from the health payer perspective. Given the potential for a meaningful fraction 
of treated patients to achieve long-term response to nivolumab, we also assessed 
the impact of using mixture cure modeling (MCM) vs. parametric survival modeling 
on survival estimates and cost-effectiveness from the US Medicare payer 
perspective.
METHODS: We created a partitioned survival decision model to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of 3 L nivolumab vs. usual care in rSCLC, based on observed 
US treatment patterns. Using this approach, we assessed the impact of 
extrapolating long-term survival from the CheckMate 032 trial, using both MCM 
and standard parametric curve fits. Nivolumab survival, resource use, and Grade 
3/4 adverse event rates were derived from CheckMate 032. Usual care survival, 
resource use, and costs were derived from an analysis of patients receiving 3 L 
treatment for rSCLC in the SEER-Medicare registry. We applied 2020 Wholesale 
Acquisition Cost for drugs and 2020 CMS reimbursement for procedures. Utilities 
were derived from the literature. We estimated life years (LY), quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs), and costs over a lifetime horizon.
RESULTS: MCM and parametric survival model extrapolations resulted in 0.43 
versus 0.38 more LYs, 0.34 versus 0.30 more QALYs, and $69,308 versus $61,336 
more expenditure for nivolumab vs. usual care, respectively. The costs per QALY 
gained using mixture cure versus parametric survival modeling were $204,386 and 
$207,431, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Mixture cure modeling was equivalent compared to parametric 
modeling in estimating the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab-based therapy due to 
the small fraction of patients achieving a long-term response with nivolumab 
(12.9%).

BACKGROUND: EQ-5D health state utilities (HSU) are commonly used in health 
economics to compute quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The EQ-5D, which is 
country-specific, can be derived directly or by mapping from self-reported 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scales such as the PROMIS-29 profile. The 
PROMIS-29 from the Patient Reported Outcome Measures Information System is a 
comprehensive assessment of self-reported health with excellent psychometric 
properties. We sought to find optimal models predicting the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk 
from the PROMIS-29 in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany and compared the 
prediction performances with that of a US model.
METHODS: We collected EQ-5D-5L and PROMIS-29 profiles and three samples 
representative of the general populations in the UK (n = 1509), France 
(n = 1501), and Germany (n = 1502). We used stepwise regression with backward 
selection to find the best models to predict the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk from all 
seven PROMIS-29 domains. We investigated the agreement between the observed and 
predicted EQ-5D-5L crosswalk in all three countries using various indices for 
the prediction performance, including Bland-Altman plots to examine the 
performance along the HSU continuum.
RESULTS: The EQ-5D-5L crosswalk was best predicted in France (nRMSEFRA = 0.075, 
nMAEFRA = 0.052), followed by the UK (nRMSEUK = 0.076, nMAEUK = 0.053) and 
Germany (nRMSEGER = 0.079, nMAEGER = 0.051). The Bland-Altman plots show that 
the inclusion of higher-order effects reduced the overprediction of low HSU 
scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Our models provide a valid method to predict the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk 
from the PROMIS-29 for the UK, France, and Germany.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for the treatment of anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) 
recommend maximal safe resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. 
Despite this multimodal treatment approach, patients have a limited life 
expectancy. In the present study, we identified variables associated with 
overall survival (OS) and constructed a model score to predict the OS of 
patients with AA at the time of their primary diagnosis.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 108 patients with newly diagnosed AA. The 
patient and tumor characteristics were analyzed for their impact on OS. 
Variables significantly associated with OS on multivariable analysis were 
included in our score. The final algorithm was based on the 36-month survival 
rates corresponding to each characteristic.
RESULTS: On univariate analysis, age, Karnofsky performance status, isocitrate 
dehydrogenase status, and extent of resection were significantly associated with 
OS. On multivariable analysis all four variables remained significant and were 
consequently incorporated in the score. The total score ranges from 20 to 33 
points. We designated three prognostic groups: A (20-25), B (26-29), and C 
(30-33 points) with 36-month OS rates of 23%, 71%, and 100%, respectively. The 
OS rate at 5 years was 8% in group A, 61% in group B and 88% in group C.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model score predicts the OS of patients newly diagnosed with AA 
and distinguishes patients with a poor survival prognosis from those with a 
greater life expectancy. Independent and prospective validation is needed. The 
upcoming changes of the WHO classification of brain tumors as well as the 
practice changing results from the CATNON trial will most likely require 
adaption of the score.

Introduction  Distal radius fractures (DRFs) are increasingly managed surgically 
among fragility fractures due to prolonged life expectancy and surgical 
advancements. Yet, malnutrition can impact postoperative outcomes and 
complications. We sought to determine the impact of malnutrition on open 
reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of DRFs during the perioperative and 
30-day postoperative periods. Materials and Methods  Using the National Surgical 
Quality Improvement Program database, all patients who underwent ORIF of a DRF 
between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2016, were identified and stratified 
by preoperative serum albumin levels: normal (≥3.5 g/dL; n = 2,546) or 
hypoalbuminemia (<3.5 g/dL; n = 439). Demographical and perioperative data were 
compared. Operative complications were stratified into major and minor 
complications, and data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and 
multivariate regression models. Results  Compared with patients with normal 
levels, a higher proportion of hypoalbuminemia patients had ASA scores > 3 (9.1 
vs. 2%) and a longer mean length of stay (3.16 vs. 0.83 days). Hypoalbuminemia 
patients also had 625% greater odds for developing major complications during 
the 30-day postoperative period (odds ratio = 7.25; 95% confidence interval: 
1.91-27.49). Conclusion  Malnutrition significantly affected outcomes and 
complications of distal radius ORIF. This study highlights the importance of 
prevention and treatment of malnutrition in the setting of fragility fractures.

BACKGROUND: Depression is one of the world's major health problems. Due to its 
high prevalence, it constitutes the first cause of disability among the 
Americas, where only a very low percentage of the population receives the 
adequate evidence-based psychological treatment. Internet-Based Interventions 
(IBIs) are a great alternative to reduce the treatment gap for mental disorders. 
Although there are several studies in low-and middle-income countries proving 
IBIs' feasibility and acceptability, there is still little evidence of the 
effectiveness in diverse social and cultural contexts such as Latin America.
METHODS: Two studies will be described: Study 1 is focused on the cultural 
adaptation of a cognitive-behavioral IBI Smiling is Fun (Botella et al. 2012, 
2015) for Ecuadorian population with depression based on the procedure by 
Salamanca-Sanabria et al. (2018). Study 2 describes the design of a randomized 
controlled trial to test the preliminary efficacy of the culturally adapted 
intervention in a Public Health Care setting. A total of 153 patients with mild 
to moderate degree of depression as assessed with the Mini-International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
(PHQ-9) will be randomly assigned to either an IBI group using only automated 
support by the system; an IBI group including also minimal human support; or a 
waiting list group. The primary outcome (depression) and secondary outcomes 
(e.g., anxiety, affect, quality of life) will be collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 
12 months. Mixed-model analyses with no ad hoc imputations will be conducted.
DISCUSSION: This paper is pioneering in exploring the role of an Internet-based 
culturally adapted intervention for depression in a public care context in 
Ecuador. Results obtained will offer new insights into the viability and 
effectiveness of digital technologies for the psychological treatment of mental 
illnesses in developing countries.

Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of a brief tailored non-pharmacological 
intervention comprising breathing retraining and psychosocial support for 
managing dyspnea in cancer patients. Design: Multicenter, single blinded, 
parallel group, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Four major public 
hospitals, Brisbane, Australia. Participants: One hundred and forty four cancer 
patients, including 81 who received an 8-week tailored intervention and 63 who 
received standard care. Inclusion Criteria: Diagnosis of small or non-small cell 
lung cancer, mesothelioma or lung metastases; completed first line therapy for 
the disease; average dyspnea rating >2 on (0-10) rating scale in past week; 
anticipated life expectancy ≥3 months. Outcomes: The primary outcome measure was 
change in "worst" dyspnea at 8 weeks compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes 
were change in: dyspnea "at best" and "on average"; distress; perceived control 
over dyspnea; functional status, psychological distress; and use of 
non-pharmacological interventions to manage dyspnea at 8 weeks relative to 
baseline. Results: The mean age of participants was 67.9 (SD = 9.6) years. 
Compared to the control group, the intervention group demonstrated a 
statistically significant: (i) improvement in average dyspnea from T1(M = 4.5, 
SE = 0.22) to T3 (M = 3.6, SE = 0.24) vs. (M = 3.8, SE = 0.24) to (M = 4.1, SE = 
0.26); (ii) greater control over dyspnea from T1 (M = 5.7, SE = 0.28) to T3 (M = 
7.5, SE = 0.31) vs. (M = 6.8, SE = 0.32) to (M = 6.6, SE = 0.33); and (iii) 
greater reduction in anxiety from T1 (M = 5.4, SE = 0.43) to T3 (M = 4.5, SE = 
0.45) vs. (M = 4.2, SE = 0.49) to (M = 4.6, SE = 0.50). This study found no 
intervention effect for best and worst dyspnea, distress from breathlessness, 
functional status, and depression over time. Conclusions: This study 
demonstrates efficacy of tailored non-pharmacological interventions in improving 
dyspnea on average, control over dyspnea, and anxiety for cancer patients. 
Clinical Trial Registration: The trial is registered at the Australian New 
Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (http://www.anzctr.org.au). The registration 
number is ACTRN12607000087459.

Vertebral discitis-osteomyelitis is an infection of the intervertebral disk and 
vertebral bodies that may extend to adjacent paraspinal and epidural soft 
tissues. Its incidence is increasing, likely because of improved treatments and 
increased life expectancy for patients with predisposing chronic disease and 
increased rates of IV drug use and intravascular intervention. Because blood 
cultures are frequently negative in patients with vertebral 
discitis-osteomyelitis, biopsy is often indicated to identify a causative 
microorganism for targeted antimicrobial therapy. The reported yield of 
CT-guided percutaneous sampling is 31-91%, which is lower than the reported 
yield of open biopsy of 76-91%. However, the less invasive approach may be 
favored given its relative safety and low cost. If paravertebral fluid 
collections are present, CT-guided aspiration should be performed. If aspiration 
is unsuccessful or no paravertebral fluid collections are present, CT-guided 
percutaneous biopsy should be performed, considering technical factors (e.g., 
anatomic approach, needle selection, and needle angulation) that may improve 
microbiologic yield. Although antimicrobial therapy should be withheld for 1-2 
weeks before biopsy if clinically feasible, biopsy may still be performed 
without stopping antimicrobial therapy if needed. Because of the importance of 
targeted antimicrobial therapy, repeat biopsy should be considered after 72 
hours if initial biopsy does not identify a pathogen.

Introduction: Tricuspid valve (TV) dysfunction treatment experiences exponential 
growth of the interest over the last years. New techniques for percutaneous 
tricuspid valve treatment are either on the market or in the early stages of 
development.Areas covered: Deficiency of uniform guideline-based recommendations 
leads to diverse TV dysfunction treatment options. The current review describes 
the development of surgical techniques for TV dysfunction in Ebstein's anomaly 
and transition to a variety of new technologies. Then, the focus is on the 
potential of percutaneous interventions to reduce the total number of open-heart 
surgeries in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) after TV replacement 
with a bioprosthesis to improve TV function.Expert opinion: TV dysfunction is 
usually a complex combination of anatomical cardiac features in CHD. Compared to 
adults with secondary TV dysfunction, CHD patients usually are younger and have 
experienced several open-heart surgeries at a young age. Therefore, TV 
dysfunction can affect long-term life expectancy and quality of life 
significantly. So far, surgery was the gold standard for TV dysfunction 
treatment. The duration of TV plasty or bioprosthesis is limited, while the risk 
of re-do operations increases with every procedure. Percutaneous TV implantation 
may reduce the total number of open-heart surgeries over a patient's life.
