patients. Seven underwent a temporary tracheostomy. Wide neck exploration 
incisions were performed in all patients as the diagnosis was established after 
imaging findings. In nine cases the anterior-upper mediastinum was affected but 
only in two patients extension of the surgical planes to the mediastinum was 
performed. Four patients developed polyserositis. Nine patients survived and two 
developed multiorgan failure and died.
CONCLUSION: There seem to be no differences between immunocompetent and 
immunocompromised CNF patients, in regards to clinical, imaging and laboratory 
findings as well as their treatment plan.

Eating fresh fruits and vegetables is, undoubtedly, a healthy habit that should 
be adopted by everyone (particularly due to the nutrients and functional 
properties of fruits and vegetables). However, at the same time, due to their 
production in the external environment, there is an increased risk of their 
being infected with various pathogenic microorganisms, some of which cause 
serious foodborne illnesses. In order to preserve and distribute safe, raw, and 
minimally processed fruits and vegetables, many strategies have been proposed, 
including bioprotection. The use of lactic acid bacteria in raw and minimally 
processed fruits and vegetables helps to better maintain their quality by 
extending their shelf life, causing a significant reduction and inhibition of 
the action of important foodborne pathogens. The antibacterial effect of lactic 
acid bacteria is attributed to its ability to produce antimicrobial compounds, 
including bacteriocins, with strong competitive action against many 
microorganisms. The use of bacteriocins, both separately and in combination with 
edible coatings, is considered a very promising approach for microbiological 
quality, and safety for postharvest storage of raw and minimally processed 
fruits and vegetables. Therefore, the purpose of the review is to discuss the 
biopreservation of fresh fruits and vegetables through the use of lactic acid 
bacteria as a green and safe technique.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of 
cancer-related death in women (7%) and the sixth in men (5%) in Italy, with a 
life expectancy of around 5% at 5 years. From 2010, the Italian Association of 
Medical Oncology (AIOM) developed national guidelines for several cancers. In 
this report, we report a summary of clinical recommendations of diagnosis, 
treatment and follow-up of PDAC, which may guide physicians in their current 
practice. A panel of AIOM experts in upper gastrointestinal cancer malignancies 
discussed the available scientific evidence supporting the clinical 
recommendations.

AIMS: To assess how the cost-effectiveness of total hip arthroplasty (THA) and 
total knee arthroplasty (TKA) varies with age, sex, and preoperative Oxford Hip 
or Knee Score (OHS/OKS); and to identify the patient groups for whom THA/TKA is 
cost-effective.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model from a 
United Kingdom NHS perspective, informed by published analyses of patient-level 
data. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of THA and TKA in adults with hip or 
knee osteoarthritis compared with having no arthroplasty surgery during the 
ten-year time horizon.
RESULTS: THA and TKA cost < £7,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained 
at all preoperative scores below the absolute referral thresholds calculated 
previously (40 for OHS and 41 for OKS). Furthermore, THA cost < £20,000/QALY for 
patients with OHS of ≤ 45, while TKA was cost-effective for patients with OKS of 
≤ 43, since the small improvements in quality of life outweighed the cost of 
surgery and any subsequent revisions. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity 
analyses demonstrated that there is little uncertainty around the conclusions.
CONCLUSION: If society is willing to pay £20,000 per QALY gained, THA and TKA 
are cost-effective for nearly all patients who currently undergo surgery, 
including all patients at and above our calculated absolute referral thresholds.

AIMS: To calculate how the likelihood of obtaining measurable benefit from hip 
or knee arthroplasty varies with preoperative patient-reported scores.
METHODS: Existing UK data from 222,933 knee and 209,760 hip arthroplasty 
patients were used to model an individual's probability of gaining meaningful 
improvement after surgery based on their preoperative Oxford Knee or Hip Score 
(OKS/OHS). A clinically meaningful improvement after arthroplasty was defined as 
≥ 8 point improvement in OHS, and ≥ 7 in OKS.
RESULTS: The upper preoperative score threshold, above which patients are 
unlikely to achieve any meaningful improvement from surgery, is 41 for knees and 
40 for hips. At lower scores, the probability of improvement increased towards a 
maximum of 88% (knee) and 95% for (hips).
CONCLUSION: By our definition of meaningful improvement, patients with 
preoperative scores above 41 (OKS) and 40 (OHS) should not be routinely referred 
to secondary care for possible arthroplasty. Using lower thresholds would 
incrementally increase the probability of meaningful benefit for those referred 
but will exclude some patients with potential to benefit. The findings are 
useful to support the complex shared decision-making process in primary care for 
referral to secondary care; and in secondary care for experienced clinicians 
counselling patients considering knee or hip arthroplasty, but should not be 
used in isolation. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2020;102-B(7):941-949.

Oligodendrocyte myelination depends on actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Neural 
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein(N-Wasp) is an actin nucleation factor that 
promotes polymerization of branched actin filaments. N-Wasp activity is 
essential for myelin membrane wrapping by Schwann cells, but its role in 
oligodendrocytes and CNS myelination remains unknown. Here we report that 
oligodendrocytes-specific deletion of N-Wasp in mice of both sexes resulted in 
hypomyelination (i.e., reduced number of myelinated axons and thinner myelin 
profiles), as well as substantial focal hypermyelination reflected by the 
formation of remarkably long myelin outfolds. These myelin outfolds surrounded 
unmyelinated axons, neuronal cell bodies, and other myelin profiles. The latter 
configuration resulted in pseudo-multimyelin profiles that were often associated 
with axonal detachment and degeneration throughout the CNS, including in the 
optic nerve, corpus callosum, and the spinal cord. Furthermore, developmental 
analysis revealed that myelin abnormalities were already observed during the 
onset of myelination, suggesting that they are formed by aberrant and misguided 
elongation of the oligodendrocyte inner lip membrane. Our results demonstrate 
that N-Wasp is required for the formation of normal myelin in the CNS. They also 
reveal that N-Wasp plays a distinct role in oligodendrocytes compared with 
Schwann cells, highlighting a difference in the regulation of actin dynamics 
during CNS and PNS myelination.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Myelin is critical for the 
normal function of the nervous system by facilitating fast conduction of action 
potentials. During the process of myelination in the CNS, oligodendrocytes 
undergo extensive morphological changes that involve cellular process extension 
and retraction, axonal ensheathment, and myelin membrane wrapping. Here we 
present evidence that N-Wasp, a protein regulating actin filament assembly 
through Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin nucleation, plays a critical role in CNS 
myelination, and its absence leads to several myelin abnormalities. Our data 
provide an important step into the understanding of the molecular mechanisms 
underlying CNS myelination.

BACKGROUND: Health 2020 is the regional health policy framework of the World 
Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe. The goals of Health 2020 
are to improve health and well-being, reduce health inequalities and strengthen 
public health. To gain insight into the Health 2020 targets needing extra 
attention in coming years, we assessed progress under Health 2020 in the WHO 
European Region.
METHODS: Quantitative methods were used to assess progress in 50 out of 53 
Member States of the WHO European Region in 2005, 2010 and 2015. The 16 
quantitative Health 2020 indicators were rescaled from 1 to 100, with 1 
indicating poor performance and 100 indicating good performance. The geometric 
mean of all 16 rescaled indicators was taken by Health 2020 target to compose a 
Health 2020 index.
RESULTS: The Health 2020 index (2015) ranged from 82.8 in Sweden to 30.0 in 
Turkmenistan. A clear east-west gradient was observed in the WHO European 
Region, with countries in western parts performing relatively better than 
countries in eastern parts. Indicators with the largest increase between 2005 
and 2015 were premature mortality, mortality external causes, life expectancy 
and infant mortality. However, all quintiles showed a decline on overweight.
CONCLUSIONS: The Health 2020 index gives a relative overview regarding the past 
and present performance on the Health 2020 policy framework of countries in the 
WHO European Region. Although improvements have been observed between 2005 and 
2015, challenges remain to improve health for all in the context of the United 
Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Heart failure is a growing health problem resulting in the decreased life 
expectancy of patients and severely increased the healthcare burden. Penetrating 
research on the pathogenesis and regulation mechanism of heart failure is 
important for treatment of heart failure. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has 
been demonstrated as not only a dynamic organ with biological functions but also 
an inert lipid store with regulating systemic metabolism. EAT mediates 
physiological and pathophysiological processes of heart failure by regulating 
adipogenesis, cardiac remodeling, insulin resistance, cardiac output, and renin 
angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). Moreover, EAT secretes a wide range of 
adipokines, adrenomedullin, adiponectin, and miRNAs through paracrine, 
endocrine, and vasocrine pathways, which involve in various extracellular and 
intracellular mechanism of cardiac-related cells in the progress of 
cardiovascular disease especially in heart failure. Nevertheless, mechanisms and 
roles of EAT on heart failure are barely summarized. Understanding the 
regulating mechanisms of EAT on heart failure may give rise to novel therapeutic 
targets and will open up innovative strategies to myocardial injury as well as 
in heart failure.

Hyperthermophilic archaea with unique biochemical and physiological 
characteristics are important organisms for fundamental research of life science 
and have great potential for biotechnological applications. However, low 
transformation efficiency of foreign DNA molecules impedes developments in 
genetic modification tools and industrial applications. In this study, we 
applied prolonged overlap extension PCR (POE-PCR) to generate multimeric DNA 
molecules and then transformed them into two hyperthermophilic archaea, 
Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1 and Pyrococcus yayanosii A1. This study was the 
first example to demonstrate the enhanced transformation efficiencies of POE-PCR 
products by a factor of approximately 100 for T. kodakarensis KOD1 and 8 for P. 
yayanosii A1, respectively, relative to circular shuttle plasmids. Furthermore, 
directed evolution of a modestly thermophilic enzyme, Methanothermococcus 
okinawensis 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), was 
conducted to obtain more stable ones due to high transformation efficiency of T. 
kodakarensis (i.e. ~3 × 104  CFU per μg DNA). T. kodakarensis harbouring the 
most thermostable MoHMGR mutant can grow in the presence of a thermostable 
antibiotic simvastatin at 85°C and even higher temperatures. This high 
transformation efficiency technique could not only help develop more 
hyperthermophilic enzyme mutants via directed evolution but also simplify 
genetical modification of archaea, which could be novel hosts for industrial 
biotechnology.

Intramedullary Nail Fixation for the Treatment of Pathologic Humeral Shaft 
Fractures.

Colello MJ, Hunter MD, Tanner SL, Porter SE.

The goal of this study was to report the clinical outcomes of pathologic humeral 
shaft fractures treated with reamed or unreamed intramedullary nail fixation in 
an era of longer patient survival. A retrospective review was conducted of all 
patients who underwent intramedullary nail fixation performed by a single 
surgeon for pathologic humeral shaft fractures at a Level I trauma center from 
2009 to 2017. Of the 25 patients who were identified, 9 were excluded. Groups 
were categorized according to whether they underwent reamed or unreamed 
fixation, and they were evaluated for evidence of union, complications, and 
reoperation. Of the patients, 11 underwent an unreamed procedure and 5 underwent 
a reamed procedure. Mean length of follow-up was 51.5 weeks. Of the patients who 
participated, 12 (75%) showed evidence of union and 2 patients (12.5%) showed 
evidence of nonunion, with no statistical difference between the groups. Five 
patients (31.3%) had complications. One nonunion occurred in the reamed group 
and did not require reoperation. In the unreamed group, complications consisted 
of 1 delayed union, 1 nonunion treated with revision intramedullary nail 
fixation, and 2 cases of disease progression that required reoperation. 
Intramedullary nail fixation of pathologic humeral shaft fractures achieves 
rates of union parallel to those seen with fixation in a healthy population. The 
length of follow-up in the current study was longer than the life expectancy 
reported by previous authors, which can be attributed to improvements in the 
treatment of cancer. The current authors argue that unreamed fixation is the 
optimal technique because it yields similar outcomes to a reamed approach and is 
faster and potentially safer. [Orthopedics. 2020;43(5):e389-e398.].

BACKGROUND: Adhesive small bowel obstruction (aSBO) is a potentially recurrent 
disease. Although non-operative management is often successful, it is associated 
with greater risk of recurrence than operative intervention, and may have 
greater downstream morbidity and costs. This study aimed to compare the current 
standard of care, trial of non-operative management (TNOM), and early operative 
management (EOM) for aSBO.
METHODS: Patients admitted to hospital between 2005 and 2014 in Ontario, Canada, 
with their first episode of aSBO were identified and propensity-matched on their 
likelihood to receive EOM for a cost-utility analysis using population-based 
administrative data. Patients were followed for 5 years to determine survival, 
recurrences, adverse events and inpatient costs to the healthcare system. 
Utility scores were attributed to aSBO-related events. Cost-utility was 
presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as 
Canadian dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: Some 25 150 patients were admitted for aSBO and 3174 (12·6 per cent) 
were managed by EOM. Patients managed by TNOM were more likely to experience 
recurrence of aSBO (20·9 per cent versus 13·2 per cent for EOM; P < 0·001). The 
lower recurrence rate associated with EOM contributed to an overall net 
effectiveness in terms of QALYs. The mean accumulated costs for patients managed 
with EOM exceeded those of TNOM ($17 951 versus $11 594 (€12 288 versus €7936) 
respectively; P < 0·001), but the ICER for EOM versus TNOM was $29 881 (€20 454) 
per QALY, suggesting cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: This retrospective study, based on administrative data, documented 
that EOM may be a cost-effective approach for patients with aSBO in terms of 
QALYs. Future guidelines on the management of aSBO may also consider the 
long-term outcomes and costs.

Publisher: ANTECEDENTES: La oclusión de intestino delgado por adherencias 
(adhesive small bowel obstruction, aSBO) es una enfermedad potencialmente 
recidivante. Aunque el tratamiento no quirúrgico es a menudo eficaz, se asocia 
con un mayor riesgo de recidiva que la intervención quirúrgica, y puede provocar 
más adelante morbilidad y costes. El objetivo de este estudio fue comparar un 
Ensayo de Tratamiento No Quirúrgico (Trial of Non-operative Management, TNOM, el 
estándar actual de tratamiento) con Tratamiento Operatorio Precoz (Early 
Operative Management, EOM) para el tratamiento de aSBO. MÉTODOS: Pacientes 
ingresados en el hospital entre 2005-2014 en Ontario, Canadá con un primer 
episodio de aSBO fueron identificados y emparejados por puntaje de propensión 
respecto a la probabilidad de recibir EOM para un análisis de coste-utilidad 
utilizando datos administrativos de base poblacional. Los pacientes fueron 
seguidos durante 5 años para determinar la supervivencia, recidivas, eventos 
adversos, y costes de la hospitalización para el sistema de salud. Las 
puntuaciones de utilidad se atribuyeron a los eventos relacionados con la aSBO. 
El coste-utilidad se presentó como la razón costo efectividad incremental 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, ICER) expresada como dólares por año de 
vida ajustado por calidad (quality-adjusted life-year, QALY).
RESULTADOS: Un total de 25.150 pacientes fueron ingresados por aSBO y 3.174 
(12,6%) fueron tratados con EOM. Los pacientes tratados mediante TNOM tenían más 
probabilidades de presentar una recidiva de la aSBO (20,9% versus 13,2%, P 
< 0,0001). La menor incidencia de recidivas asociada con EOM contribuyó a una 
eficacia neta global en términos de QALYs. Mientras que los costes medios 
acumulados para los pacientes tratados con EOM superaron a los de TNOM ($17,951 
versus $11,594, P < 0,0001), el ICER de EOM versus TNOM fue $29,881/QALY, lo que 
sugiere un coste-eficacia de esta estrategia. CONCLUSIÓN: Este estudio 
retrospectivo basado en datos administrativos evidenció que EOM puede 
representar un abordaje coste-efectivo para pacientes con aSBO en términos de 
QALYs. Las futuras guías clínicas para el tratamiento de la aSBO pueden también 
considerar los resultados a largo plazo y los costes.

BACKGROUND: The opioid epidemic has been associated with an increase in 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) 
have a high burden of hepatitis C disease and could serve as venues to enhance 
testing and treatment.
METHODS: We estimated clinical outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis 
C testing and treatment at US FQHCs using individual-based simulation modeling. 
We used individual-level data from 57 FQHCs to model 9 strategies, including 
permutations of HCV antibody testing modality, person initiating testing, and 
testing approach. Outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALY), hepatitis C cases identified, treated and cured; and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Compared with current practice (risk-based with laboratory-based 
testing), routine rapid point-of-care testing initiated and performed by a 
counselor identified 68% more cases after (nonreflex) RNA testing in the first 
month of the intervention and led to a 17% reduction in cirrhosis cases and a 
22% reduction in liver deaths among those with cirrhosis over a lifetime. 
Routine rapid testing initiated by a counselor or a clinician provided better 
outcomes at either lower total cost or at lower cost per QALY gained, when 
compared with all other strategies. Findings were most influenced by the 
proportion of patients informed of their anti-HCV test results.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine anti-HCV testing followed by prompt RNA testing for 
positives is recommended at FQHCs to identify infections. If using dedicated 
staff or point-of-care testing is not feasible, then measures to improve 
immediate patient knowledge of antibody status should be considered.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COVID-19 pandemic has affected various countries 
differently due to variance in demographics, income level, health 
infrastructure, government response, control and enforcement, and cultural 
traits of different populations. This study aims to identify significant factors 
behind the unequal distribution of identified cases and deaths in different 
countries. Our study's objective is comparative analysis and identification of 
relations between the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, population characteristics, 
and government response.
METHODS: The top 18 countries worst hit by COVID-19 cases were identified. The 
data metrics, such as the number of cases, deaths, fatality rates, tests, 
average life expectancy, and population, were collected and consolidated.
RESULTS: Countries with significant percentage of the older population are 
vulnerable to a high number of deaths due to COVID-19. Developed countries have 
higher per capita testing, whereas testing is less intensive in 
developing/underdeveloped countries. There is a consensus among health experts 
that COVID-19 has higher fatality rates for people above 60, however, with 
further age, this increases exponentially. Countries with higher life expectancy 
are also high-income countries, and the best course of action would be to 
provide specialized support to self-isolate for people of ages 75 and above.
CONCLUSION: The behaviour of disease occurring at a large scale and interaction 
with different populations is studied to understand and differentiate the 
factors and measures that successfully inhibited the pandemic. The study 
benchmarks different countries based on their performance and efforts against 
the pandemic and provides some useful insights on the efficiency of their 
governance and potential to improve & ramp up their programs. The economic 
status and existing healthcare infrastructure as they are the key factors in 
determining the country's ability to contain and minimize the losses from this 
pandemic.

Various survival scoring systems have been developed to help surgeons select the 
best candidates for appropriate therapies in patients with metastatic spinal 
disease. This study aims to discuss the current status and future directions of 
scoring systems for the prediction of survival prognosis in these patients. The 
search terms "spine metastases," "metastatic spinal disease," and "metastatic 
spinal cord compression" were combined with "survival prognosis," "scoring 
system," and "score" to elicit relevant literatures in PubMed and Embase 
databases. As a result, 159 articles were selected from PubMed, and 246 articles 
were extracted from Embase. After reviewing each article, we carefully included 
and analyzed 74 articles about the development and evaluation of scoring systems 
for predicting survival prognosis in spine metastases. In this review, those 
scoring systems were stratified into the historic scoring systems and the modern 
scoring systems on the basis of the proposed time. The historic scoring systems, 
including the original/revised Tokuhashi scoring system, the Bauer scoring 
system, the Tomita scoring system, and the Linden scoring system, and the modern 
scoring systems, such as the Lei scoring system, the Bartels scoring system, the 
Mizumoto scoring system, the Bollen scoring system, the Rades scoring system, 
Oswestry Spinal Risk Index, and the Choi risk calculator, were introduced and 
discussed in this review. Besides, the clinical effectiveness and pitfalls of 
the existing systems and the future directions of the next generation of scoring 
systems were also addressed and discussed. We recommended these scoring systems 
as preferable reference tools to help doctors to select surgical candidates. In 
patients with long-term life expectancy, radical surgery, such as wide or 
marginal excision, can be considered in patients with neurological deficits, 
spine instability, or severe back pain. Besides, with the advancement and 
improvement of medical technologies, surgical procedures are changing, which can 
affect surgical indications such as vertebroplasty, minimal invasive surgery, 
and percutaneous stabilization, which can also be used in patients with spine 
instability or severe back pain, and do not require much recovery; hence, they 
can even be used in patients with relative short-term life expectancy. However, 
the decision about the treatment of patients with metastatic spinal disease is 
so complicated and should never rely on prognostic scores alone. The final 
therapeutic decision should be made by interdisciplinary corporations of 
oncologists, radiologists, and spinal surgeons. Besides, individual intentions 
should be respected.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Psychosocial, and Utility Outcomes of Early 
Mandibular Distraction in Craniofacial Microsomia.

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness, utility outcomes, and most optimal timing of 
mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) in craniofacial microsomia (CFM) 
continue to be a topic of debate, especially in the population of patients with 
mild or nonsignificant functional issues. The objective of this study was to 
quantitatively assess the burden of mandibular asymmetry in CFM, and to 
accurately evaluate the impact of early MDO on patients' perceived quality of 
life and social acceptance, in addition to examining the cost-effectiveness of 
early MDO in CFM.
METHODS: A validated crowdsourcing platform was utilized to recruit 
participants. Psychosocial acceptance and utility outcomes were assessed for 
patients with CFM. Participants were presented with health-state scenarios 
supplemented with pre- and postoperative images. Quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) were subsequently calculated and costs were estimated based on Medicare 
fee schedules using the Current Procedural Terminology codes. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios for early MDO were calculated and plotted against a 
$100,000/QALY threshold.
RESULTS: A total of 463 participants were included in the study. The mean visual 
analog scale score for untreated mandibular hypoplasia in CFM was 0.48 ± 0.24, 
which improved significantly (P < 0.0001) to 0.63 ± 0.20 following early MDO. 
Time trade-off scores for an imaginary surgery leading to perfect health with no 
complications were not statistically different from undergoing early MDO (P = 
0.113). Early mandibular distraction decreased social distance in all 8 social 
situations assessed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios varied by the 
duration of time between early MDO and a potential second intervention, ranging 
from $148,142.09 per QALY gained at an interval of 1 year to $9876.14 per QALY 
gained after 15 years. Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, 
early MDO in CFM becomes cost-effective when patients enjoy an improved 
health-state post-MDO for more than 1.48 years before a potential second 
intervention, if deemed necessary.
CONCLUSION: Early mandibular distraction may lead to tangible positive gains in 
CFM patients based on utility outcome scores, psychosocial acceptance, and 
social distance. Therefore, although further interventions may be needed at 
skeletal maturity, early MDO can improve the psychological well-being of CFM 
patients during their crucial developmental years in a cost-effective manner. 
The incremental cost per QALY gained post-early MDO correlates negatively with 
time until a second potential surgical intervention.

The increasing life expectancy of humans has led to an increase in the number of 
patients with chronic diseases and organ failure. However, the imbalance between 
the supply and the demand for human organs is a serious problem in modern 
transplantology. One of many solutions to overcome this problem is the use of 
xenotransplantation. The domestic pig (Sus scrofa domestica) is currently 
considered as the most suitable for human organ procurement. However, there are 
discrepancies between pigs and humans that lead to the creation of immunological 
barriers preventing the direct xenograft. The introduction of appropriate 
modifications to the pig genome to prevent xenograft rejection is crucial in 
xenotransplantation studies. In this study, porcine GGTA1, CMAH, β4GalNT2, vWF, 
ASGR1 genes were selected to introduce genetic modifications. The evaluation of 
three selected gRNAs within each gene was obtained, which enabled the selection 
of the best site for efficient introduction of changes. Modifications were 
examined after nucleofection of porcine primary kidney fibroblasts with 
CRISPR/Cas9 system genetic constructs, followed by the tracking of indels by 
decomposition (TIDE) analysis. In addition, off-target analysis was carried out 
for selected best gRNAs using the TIDE tool, which is new in the research 
conducted so far and shows the utility of this tool in these studies.

Patients living with brain tumours have the highest average years of life lost 
of any cancer, ultimately reducing average life expectancy by 20 years. 
Diagnosis depends on brain imaging and most often confirmatory tissue biopsy for 
histology. The majority of patients experience non-specific symptoms, such as 
headache, and may be reviewed in primary care on multiple occasions before 
diagnosis is made. Sixty-two per cent of patients are diagnosed on brain imaging 
performed when they deteriorate and present to the emergency department. 
Histological diagnosis from invasive surgical biopsy is necessary prior to 
definitive treatment, because imaging techniques alone have difficulty in 
distinguishing between several types of brain cancer. However, surgery itself 
does not necessarily control tumour growth, and risks morbidity for the patient. 
Due to their similar features on brain scans, glioblastoma, primary central 
nervous system lymphoma and brain metastases have been known to cause 
radiological confusion. Non-invasive tests that support stratification of tumour 
subtype would enhance early personalisation of treatment selection and reduce 
the delay and risks associated with surgery for many patients. Techniques 
involving vibrational spectroscopy, such as attenuated total reflection Fourier 
transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, have previously demonstrated 
analytical capabilities for cancer diagnostics. In this study, infrared spectra 
from 641 blood serum samples obtained from brain cancer and control patients 
have been collected. Firstly, we highlight the capability of ATR-FTIR to 
distinguish between healthy controls and brain cancer at sensitivities and 
specificities above 90%, before defining subtle differences in protein secondary 
structures between patient groups through Amide I deconvolution. We successfully 
differentiate several types of brain lesions (glioblastoma, meningioma, primary 
central nervous system lymphoma and metastasis) with balanced accuracies >80%. A 
reliable blood serum test capable of stratifying brain tumours in secondary care 
could potentially avoid surgery and speed up the time to definitive therapy, 
which would be of great value for both neurologists and patients.

INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disabling disease 
characterized by a symmetrical articular involvement due to ongoing joint 
inflammation, if left insufficiently treated. Local and generalized bone loss is 
one of the main extra-articular complications of RA and leads to an increased 
risk for fragility fractures, which further impair functional ability, quality 
of life, and life expectancy. Therefore, there is an urgent need for good 
fracture risk management in the vulnerable RA patient.
AREAS COVERED: The authors review: the epidemiology and pathophysiology (i.e. 
risk factors) of osteoporosis (OP), fracture, and vertebral fracture risk 
assessment, the effects of anti-rheumatic drugs on bone loss, pharmacological 
treatment of OP in RA including both bisphosphonates (BP) and newer drugs 
including anti-resorptives and osteoanabolic treatment options.
EXPERT OPINION: Patients with active RA have elevated bone resorption and local 
bone loss. Moreover, these patients are at increased risk for generalized bone 
loss, vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. Since general risk factors (such as 
low BMI, fall risk) and RA-related factors play a role, optimal fracture 
prevention in RA patients is based on optimal diagnostics based on both of these 
factors, and on the use of adequate non-medical and medical treatment options.

Improvements in management of cystic fibrosis (CF) through specialist centres in 
the UK have been associated with a step-change in life expectancy. With 
increasing numbers of adult patients there is a need to review health care 
provision to ensure it is sufficient to meet future needs. We used UK CF 
Registry data to project the number of patients aged 16-17 and 18 and older  up 
to 2030, and numbers therefore requiring specialist adult CF care. Survival 
modelling was used to estimate age-specific mortality rates. New-diagnosis rates 
were estimated using diagnoses observed in the Registry and national population 
figures. Uncertainty in projections was captured through 95% prediction 
intervals (PI). The number of adults (aged 18 and older) is expected to increase 
by 28% from 6,225 in 2017 to 7,988 in 2030 (95% PI 7,803-8,169), assuming 
current mortality rates. If mortality rates improve at the rate seen over recent 
years, the projected number increases to 8,579 (95% PI 8,386-8,764). The age 
distribution is also expected to change, with 36% of CF adults being over 40 in 
2030, versus 21% in 2017. There is an urgent requirement to review adult CF 
health care provision, due to both increasing numbers and the changing care 
needs of an older population.

BACKGROUND: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate health index (PHI) have 
been used as biomarkers for prostate cancer detection. In this study, we aimed 
to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PHI for prostate cancer detection in 
Chinese men.
METHOD: We developed a Markov model for Chinese male patient aged 50-75 years 
old. The PSA strategy was to offer TRUS-PB for all patients with elevated PSA of 
4-10 ng/mL. The PHI strategy was to offer PHI for patients with elevated PSA of 
4-10 ng/mL. TRUS-PB would only be offered for patients with PHI >35.0. Model 
inputs were extracted from local data when available. The cost per 
quality-adjusted life years gained for both strategies were calculated. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in relation to the willingness-to-pay 
(WTP) threshold were compared. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis were performed. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves 
were also constructed.
RESULTS: With a Markov model of 25 screening cycles from age 50 to 75 years, the 
mean total costs per man were estimated to be USD 27,439 in the PSA strategy and 
USD 22,877 in the PHI strategy. The estimated effects were estimated to be 15.70 
in the PSA strategy and 16.05 in the PHI strategy. The PHI strategy was 
associated with an expected decrease in cost of USD 4562 and an expected gain of 
0.35 QALY, resulting in an ICER of USD -13056.56. The results were shown to be 
robust upon one-way sensitivity analysis. Upon Monte Carlo simulation, the PHI 
strategy was more cost-effective for 100% of the iterations. The PHI strategy 
demonstrated dominance over the PSA strategy regardless of what WTP threshold we 
use.
CONCLUSIONS: A PHI-based screening strategy may be more cost-effective than a 
PSA-based strategy for prostate cancer detection in Chinese men. These results 
support consideration of a PHI-based approach for prostate cancer in Hong Kong.

Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by absence 
or deficient activity of α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) due to mutations in the 
α-galactosidase A gene (GLA), leading to progressive accumulation of 
globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in tissues and organs including heart, kidney, the 
eyes, vascular endothelium, the nervous system and the skin. Cardiac involvement 
is leading to fatal complications and reduced life expectancy. FD is treatable 
with disease-specific treatment (enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or with 
chaperone therapy). Therefore, the early diagnosis of FD is crucial for reducing 
the morbidity and mortality. Screening of high-risk populations (eg, patients 
with unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), young patients with 
unexplained stroke, and patients with unexplained renal failure proteinuria or 
microalbuminuria) yields good results. The diagnostic algorithm is 
gender-specific. Initially, the measurement of α-Gal A activity is recommended 
in males, and optionally in females. In males with non-diagnostic residual 
activity (5-10%) activity, genetic testing is afterwards done for confirming the 
diagnosis. In fact, diagnosis of FD is not possible without genetic testing for 
both males and females. Globotriaosysphingosine (lyso-Gb3) for identification of 
atypical FD variants and high- sensitive troponin T (hsTNT) for identification 
of cardiac involvement are also important diagnostic biomarkers. The aim of this 
review was to provide an update on diagnosis and screening of patients with FD.
