compounds had favourable free energies comprising - 26.04 kcal/mol for 
Zinc77235130 and - 15.73 kcal/mol for Zinc33330198. Amongst the final two hits, 
Zinc77235130 showed consistency in favourable results across all the tested 
parameters and was thus selected as the lead compound for further experimental 
validation. The identification of this lead compound will form important basis 
for the inhibition of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer therapy.

Air particulate matter (PM) and its harmful effects on human health are of great 
concern globally due to all-cause and cause-specific mortality impacts across 
different population groups. While Europe has made significant progress in 
reducing particulate air pollution-related mortality through innovative 
technologies and policies, many countries in Asia-Pacific region still rely on 
high-polluting technologies and have yet to implement effective policies to 
address this issue, resulting in higher levels of mortality due to air pollution 
in the region. This study has three aims related to quantifying life-years lost 
(LYL) attributable to PM, and further separated into ambient PM and household 
air pollution (HAP): (1) to investigate LYL by causes of death; (2) to compare 
LYL between Asia-Pacific (APAC) and Europe; and (3) to assess LYL across 
different socio-demographic index (SDI) countries. The data used come from the 
Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and Health Effects Institute 
(HEI). Our results show that average LYL due to PM in APAC was greater than in 
Europe, with some Pacific island countries particularly affected by the exposure 
to HAP. Three quarters of LYL came from premature deaths by ischemic heart 
disease and stroke, in both continents. There were significant differences 
between SDI groups for causes of death due to ambient PM and HAP. Our findings 
call for urgent improvement of clean air to reduce indoor and outdoor air 
pollution-related mortality in the APAC region.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation is ideal for children and adolescents with 
chronic end-stage renal disease because it offers better growth, development, 
and quality of life. Donor choice is vitally important in this age group, given 
the long life expectancy of these patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of pediatric patients (<18 years) who 
underwent kidney transplantation from January 1999 to December/2018 was 
performed. Short- and long-term outcomes were compared between living and 
deceased donor transplants.
RESULTS: We included 59 pediatric kidney transplant recipients, 12 from a living 
donor and 47 from a deceased donor. Thirty-six (61.0%) patients were boys, and 5 
(8.5%) had a retransplant. There were no differences between groups on sex, 
race, and weight of the recipient and donor, as well as the age and the etiology 
of the recipient's primary disease. Most recipients received induction 
immunosuppression with basiliximab and maintenance with triple therapy, with no 
differences between groups. Living donor transplants were mostly pre-emptive 
(58.3% vs 4.3%, P < .001) and had fewer HLA mismatches (≤3: 90.9% vs 13.0%, P < 
.001), older donors (38.4 vs 24.3 years, P < .001) and shorter hospital stays 
(8.8 vs 14.1 days, P = .004). There were no statistically significant 
differences regarding medical-surgical complications and graft or patient 
survival. However, we found that at 13 years post-transplant 91.7% of the living 
donor grafts were functioning vs 72.3% of the deceased donor grafts.
CONCLUSION: Our experience points out that a living donor graft in pediatric 
patients is associated with a higher probability of pre-emptive transplant, 
shorter hospital stay, greater HLA compatibility, and increased graft survival.

BACKGROUND: Influenza causes excessive morbidity and mortality among older 
adults. While influenza vaccine provides protection against its infection, the 
vaccination coverage in China among older adults has been very low. Previous 
evidence on the cost-effectiveness of government-sponsored free influenza 
vaccination programs in China was primarily based on literature data, which 
might not always reflect real-world patient populations. The Yinzhou Health 
Information System (YHIS) is a regional database that captures electronic health 
records, insurance claims data, etc. for all residents in Yinzhou district, 
Zhejiang province, China. We will use YHIS to study the effectiveness, 
influenza-related direct medical cost and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of 
the free influenza vaccination program for older adults. In this paper, we 
describe the study design and innovations in detail.
METHODS: We will establish a retrospective cohort of permanent older residents 
aged 65 and over, using YHIS between 2016 and 2021. We will estimate the vaccine 
coverage rate, influenza incidence rate and influenza-related direct medical 
cost from 2016 to 2021. Regression discontinuity will be used to estimate 
vaccine effectiveness for the 2020/2021 season. We will build a decision tree 
model to compare the cost-effectiveness of three influenza vaccination options 
(free trivalent influenza vaccine, free quadrivalent influenza vaccine, and no 
policy) from both societal and health system perspectives. Parameter inputs will 
be gathered from both YHIS and published literature. We will calculate the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with cost and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) discounted at 5 % annually.
DISCUSSION: Our CEA solidifies multiple sources including regional real-world 
data and literature for a rigorous evaluation of the government-sponsored free 
influenza vaccination program. The results will provide real-world evidence from 
real-world data on the cost-effectiveness of a real-world policy. Our findings 
are expected to support evidence-based policy making and to promote health for 
older adults.

In the era that we seek personalization in material things, it is becoming 
increasingly clear that the individualized management of medicine and nutrition 
plays a key role in life expectancy and quality of life, allowing participation 
to some extent in our welfare and the use of societal resources in a rationale 
and equitable way. The implementation of precision medicine and nutrition are 
highly complex challenges which depend on the development of new technologies 
able to meet important requirements in terms of cost, simplicity, and 
versatility, and to determine both individually and simultaneously, almost in 
real time and with the required sensitivity and reliability, molecular markers 
of different omics levels in biofluids extracted, secreted (either naturally or 
stimulated), or circulating in the body. Relying on representative and 
pioneering examples, this review article critically discusses recent advances 
driving the position of electrochemical bioplatforms as one of the winning 
horses for the implementation of suitable tools for advanced diagnostics, 
therapy, and precision nutrition. In addition to a critical overview of the 
state of the art, including groundbreaking applications and challenges ahead, 
the article concludes with a personal vision of the imminent roadmap.

BACKGROUND: Public health policies and healthcare quality play a pivotal role on 
the health outcome level and disparities across sociodemographic groups. 
However, there is little evidence on their role on disparities in life 
expectancy (LE) and life disparity (LD) in low and middle income countries. The 
present study aimed to assess the contributions of avoidable mortality, as a 
measure of inter-sectoral public health policies and healthcare quality, into 
the sex gap in LE (SGLE) and LD (SGLD) in Iran.
METHODS: Latest available data of death causes, according to the ICD codes, for 
Iran was obtained from the WHO mortality database for the period 2015-2016. An 
upper age limit of 75 years was applied to define avoidable causes of death. LD 
was measured as the average years of life lost at birth. The SGLE and SGLD (both 
females minus males) were decomposed by age and cause of death using a 
continuous-change model.
RESULTS: Females, on average, outlived males for 3.8 years (80.0 vs. 76.2 years) 
with 1.9 lower life years lost (12.6 vs. 14.4 years). Avoidable causes accounted 
for 2.5 (67%) and 1.5 (79%) years of the SGLE and SGLD, respectively. Among 
avoidable causes, injury-related deaths followed by ischaemic heart disease had 
the greatest contributions to both SGLE and SGLD. Across age groups, the age 
groups 55-59 and 60-64 accounted for the greatest contributions of avoidable 
causes to SGLE (0.3 years each), while age groups 20-24 and 55-59 had the 
greatest contributions to SGLD (0.15 years each). Lower mortality rates for 
females than males in age groups 50-74 years accounted for about half of the 
SGLE, while age groups 20-29 and 50-64 years accounted for around half of SGLD.
CONCLUSION: More than two third of the SGLE and SGLD in Iran were attributed to 
the avoidable mortality, particularly preventable causes. Our results suggest 
the need for public health policies targeting injuries in young males as well as 
lifestyle risk factors including smoking in middle aged males in Iran.

On the Genuine Relevance of the Data-Driven Signal Decomposition-Based 
Multiscale Permutation Entropy.

Ordinal pattern-based approaches have great potential to capture intrinsic 
structures of dynamical systems, and therefore, they continue to be developed in 
various research fields. Among these, the permutation entropy (PE), defined as 
the Shannon entropy of ordinal probabilities, is an attractive time series 
complexity measure. Several multiscale variants (MPE) have been proposed in 
order to bring out hidden structures at different time scales. Multiscaling is 
achieved by combining linear or nonlinear preprocessing with PE calculation. 
However, the impact of such a preprocessing on the PE values is not fully 
characterized. In a previous study, we have theoretically decoupled the 
contribution of specific signal models to the PE values from that induced by the 
inner correlations of linear preprocessing filters. A variety of linear filters 
such as the autoregressive moving average (ARMA), Butterworth, and Chebyshev 
were tested. The current work is an extension to nonlinear preprocessing and 
especially to data-driven signal decomposition-based MPE. The empirical mode 
decomposition, variational mode decomposition, singular spectrum analysis-based 
decomposition and empirical wavelet transform are considered. We identify 
possible pitfalls in the interpretation of PE values induced by these nonlinear 
preprocessing, and hence, we contribute to improving the PE interpretation. The 
simulated dataset of representative processes such as white Gaussian noise, 
fractional Gaussian processes, ARMA models and synthetic sEMG signals as well as 
real-life sEMG signals are tested.

The ability to count finger and wrist movements throughout the day with a 
nonobtrusive, wearable sensor could be useful for hand-related healthcare 
applications, including rehabilitation after a stroke, carpal tunnel syndrome, 
or hand surgery. Previous approaches have required the user to wear a ring with 
an embedded magnet or inertial measurement unit (IMU). Here, we demonstrate that 
it is possible to identify the occurrence of finger and wrist flexion/extension 
movements based on vibrations detected by a wrist-worn IMU. We developed an 
approach we call "Hand Activity Recognition through using a Convolutional neural 
network with Spectrograms" (HARCS) that trains a CNN based on the 
velocity/acceleration spectrograms that finger/wrist movements create. We 
validated HARCS with the wrist-worn IMU recordings obtained from twenty stroke 
survivors during their daily life, where the occurrence of finger/wrist 
movements was labeled using a previously validated algorithm called HAND using 
magnetic sensing. The daily number of finger/wrist movements identified by HARCS 
had a strong positive correlation to the daily number identified by HAND (R2 = 
0.76, p < 0.001). HARCS was also 75% accurate when we labeled the finger/wrist 
movements performed by unimpaired participants using optical motion capture. 
Overall, the ringless sensing of finger/wrist movement occurrence is feasible, 
although real-world applications may require further accuracy improvements.

Ageing is an inevitable aspect of life and thus successful ageing is an 
important focus of recent scientific efforts. The biological process of ageing 
is mediated through the interaction of genes with environmental factors, 
increasing the body's susceptibility to insults. Elucidating this process will 
increase our ability to prevent and treat age-related disease and consequently 
extend life expectancy. Notably, centenarians offer a unique perspective on the 
phenomenon of ageing. Current research highlights several age-associated 
alterations on the genetic, epigenetic and proteomic level. Consequently, 
nutrient sensing and mitochondrial function are altered, resulting in 
inflammation and exhaustion of regenerative ability.Oral health, an important 
contributor to overall health, remains underexplored in the context of extreme 
longevity. Good masticatory function ensures sufficient nutrient uptake, 
reducing morbidity and mortality in old age. The relationship between 
periodontal disease and systemic inflammatory pathologies is well established. 
Diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease are among the most 
significant disease burdens influenced by inflammatory oral health conditions. 
Evidence suggests that the interaction is bi-directional, impacting progression, 
severity and mortality. Current models of ageing and longevity neglect an 
important factor in overall health and well-being, a gap that this review 
intends to illustrate and inspire avenues for future research.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trastuzumab was introduced in Sweden in 2000 for 
treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and later expanded to 
early breast cancer (EBC). The potential value of this innovative therapy was 
explored in economic evaluations; however, the extent to which these benefits 
were realised remains unknown. This study aims to estimate the lifecycle value 
of trastuzumab by combining randomised trial data with Swedish routine-care 
data.
METHODS: Trastuzumab impact on costs and health outcomes was estimated with 
Markov models for MBC and EBC. Model inputs included progression/recurrence and 
breast cancer-related mortality data from international randomised clinical 
trials, and Sweden-specific non-breast cancer-related mortality, numbers 
treated, and costs and utilities based on data from National Registries and 
literature. Model predictions were validated by observed survival rates from the 
National Breast Cancer Registry.
RESULTS: From 2000 to 2021, 3936 and 11,134 patients with HER2-positive MBC and 
EBC, respectively, were treated with trastuzumab, resulting in 25,844 life years 
and 13,436 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. Cost per QALY gained 
was lower in EBC (Swedish krona [SEK] 285,000/QALY) than MBC (SEK 554,000/QALY). 
The net-monetary value delivered (excluding drug costs) was SEK 13.714 billion, 
and society retained 62% of this. The modelled survival in trastuzumab-treated 
patients with EBC matched closely with actually observed survival in registry 
data.
CONCLUSION: Trastuzumab provided substantial population-level health benefits 
for patients and society, with favourable cost effectiveness in MBC and EBC. 
There is some uncertainty around the magnitude of these benefits, mainly due to 
missing data on health outcomes and number of treated patients with MBC.

Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is one of the most frequent among neuromuscular 
diseases, affecting approximately 1 in 18,000 male births. It is linked to a 
genetic mutation on the X chromosome. In contrast to Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy, for which improved care and management have changed the prognosis and 
life expectancy of patients, few guidelines have been published for management 
of BMD. Many clinicians are inexperienced in managing the complications of this 
disease. In France, a committee of experts from a wide range of disciplines met 
in 2019 to establish recommendations, with the goal of improving care of 
patients with BMD. Here, we present the tools to provide diagnosis of BMD as 
quickly as possible and for differential diagnoses. Then, we describe the 
multidisciplinary approach essential for optimum management of BMD. We give 
recommendations for the initial assessment and follow-up of the neurological, 
respiratory, cardiac, and orthopedic consequences of males who present with BMD. 
Finally, we describe the optimal therapeutic management of these complications. 
We also provide guidance on cardiac management for female carriers.

Sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit motions are basic motions for daily animal life, 
and these motions are used as therapeutic exercises for dogs with functional 
impairments. The sit-to-stand motion is divided into several phases for 
kinesiological assessment in human rehabilitation and physical therapy. However, 
these motions in dogs have not been characterized in detail. We examined canine 
hindlimb kinematic characteristics during sit-to-stand/stand-to-sit motions and 
compared the characteristics with those during walking. In addition, we tried to 
classify phases of the movements based on kinematic characteristics of the 
transition of the range of motion of the hindlimb. We used a three-dimensional 
motion analysis system to evaluate the motions of eight clinically healthy 
beagles. During the sit-to-stand motion, the total range of motion (ROM) in the 
hip joint flexion/extension was half of that of during walking, but the total 
ROM of the hindlimb external/internal rotation relative to the pelvis and 
flexion/extension of the stifle and the tarsal joints were significantly larger 
than those of walking, suggesting that sit-to-stand exercise causes movements of 
hindlimb joints without marked changes in hip joint flexion/extension movement. 
Both sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit motions could not be divided into multiple 
phases only by the transition of the range of motion of the hindlimb.

A simple and rapid colorimetric method for the detection of melamine in milk 
samples is described. Polythymidine oligonucleotide was adsorbed on to the 
surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), protecting it from aggregation. In the 
presence of melamine, polythymidine oligonucleotide combined with melamine 
formed a double-strand DNA-like structure, allowing AuNPs aggregation. In the 
presence of positively charged SYBR Green I (SG I), AuNPs were further 
aggregated. In the presence of melamine and SG I, aggregation of AuNPs was 
synergistic. Thus, in this principle, melamine can be detected visually. Plasmon 
resonance peak changes enabled detection of melamine quantitatively using UV-vis 
spectroscopy. The limit of detection for this colorimetric method was 16 μg L-1 
with a good linear range from 19.5 μg L-1 to 1.25 × 103 μg L-1, and detection 
took only 1 min. The method was successfully applied for detection of melamine 
in milk samples.

OBJECTIVES: Current guidelines recommend tapering biological disease-modifying 
antirheumatoid drugs (bDMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) if the disease is 
under control. However, guidelines on tapering are lacking. Assessing 
cost-effectiveness of different tapering strategies might provide broader input 
for creating guidelines on how to taper bDMARDs in patients with RA. The aim of 
this study is to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness from a societal 
perspective of bDMARD tapering strategies in Dutch patients with RA, namely 50% 
dose reduction (tapering), discontinuation and a 50% dose reduction followed by 
discontinuation (de-escalation).
METHODS: Using a societal perspective, a Markov model with a life-time horizon 
of 30 years was used to simulate 3-monthly transitions between Disease Activity 
28 (DAS28)-defined health states of remission (<2.6), low disease activity 
(2.6<DAS28<3.2) and medium-high disease activity (DAS28>3.2). Transition 
probabilities were estimated through literature search and random effects 
pooling. Incremental costs, incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and incremental net monetary 
benefits for each tapering strategy were compared with continuation. 
Deterministic, probabilistic sensitivity analyses and multiple scenario analyses 
were performed.
RESULTS: After 30 years, the ICERs were €115 157/QALY lost, €74 226/QALY lost 
and €67 137/QALY lost for tapering, de-escalation and discontinuation, 
respectively; mainly driven by bDMARD cost savings and a 72.8% probability of a 
loss in quality of life. This corresponds to a 76.1%, 64.3% and 60.1% 
probability of tapering, de-escalation and discontinuation being cost-effective, 
provided a willingness-to-accept threshold of €50 000/QALY lost.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these analyses, the 50% tapering approach saved the 
highest cost per QALY lost.

BACKGROUND: We investigated the relationship between characteristic geriatric 
symptoms and healthy life expectancy in older adults in Japan. Additionally, we 
determined relationship predictors that would help formulate effective 
approaches toward promoting healthy life expectancy.
METHODS: The Kihon Checklist was used to identify older people at high risk of 
requiring nursing care in the near future. We evaluated the association of 
geriatric symptoms with healthy life expectancy while considering risk factors 
(frailty, poor motor function, poor nutrition, poor oral function, confinement, 
poor cognitive function, and depression). Data from the 2013 and 2019 Japan 
Gerontological Evaluation Studies were used. Healthy life expectancy was 
assessed using the multistate life table method.
RESULTS: Overall, 8,956 individuals were included. For both men and women, 
healthy life expectancy was shorter in the symptomatic group than in the 
asymptomatic group for several domains of the Kihon Checklist. For men, the 
difference between individuals with risk factors and those with no risk factors 
was the maximum for confinement (3.83 years) and the minimum for cognitive 
function (1.51 years). For women, the difference between individuals with risk 
factors and those with no risk factors was the maximum for frailty (4.21 years) 
and the minimum for cognitive function (1.67 years). Healthy life expectancy 
tended to be shorter when the number of risk factors was higher. Specifically, 
the difference between individuals with ≥3 risk factors and those with no risk 
factors was 4.46 years for men and 5.68 years for women.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthy life expectancy was negatively associated with 
characteristic geriatric symptoms, with strong associations with frailty, 
physical functional decline, and depression. Therefore, comprehensive assessment 
and prevention of geriatric symptoms may increase healthy life expectancy.

As an extension of our research on providing a chemical library of side-chain 
fluorinated vitamin D3 analogues, we newly designed and synthesized 
26,27-difluoro-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1) and 
26,26,27,27-tetrafluoro-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (2) using a convergent method 
applying the Wittig-Horner coupling reaction between CD-ring ketones (13, 14) 
and A-ring phosphine oxide (5). The basic biological activities of analogues, 1, 
2, and 26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [HF-25(OH)D3] were 
examined. Although the tetrafluorinated new compound 2 exhibited higher binding 
affinity for vitamin D receptor (VDR) and resistance to CYP24A1-dependent 
metabolism compared with the difluorinated 1 and its non-fluorinated counterpart 
25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], HF-25(OH)D3 showed the highest activity among 
these compounds. Osteocalcin promoter transactivation activity of these 
fluorinated analogues was tested, and it decreased in the order of HF-25(OH)D3, 
2, 1, and 25(OH)D3 in which HF-25(OH)D3 showed 19-times greater activity than 
the natural 25(OH)D3.

It is interesting to identify factors involved in the regulation of the 
encystation of Entamoeba histolytica that differentiate trophozoites into cysts. 
Evolutionarily conserved three amino acid loop extension (TALE) homeodomain 
proteins act as transcription factors and execute a variety of functions that 
are essential for life. A TALE homeodomain (EhHbox) protein-encoding gene has 
been identified in E. histolytica (Eh) that is highly upregulated during heat 
shock, glucose, and serum starvation. Its ortholog, EiHbox1, a putative homeobox 
protein in E. invadens (Ei), is also highly upregulated during the early hours 
of encystation, glucose starvation, and heat shock. They belong to the PBX 
family of TALE homeobox proteins and have conserved residues in the homeodomain 
that are essential for DNA binding. Both are localized in the nucleus during 
encystation and under different stress conditions. The electrophoretic mobility 
shift assay confirmed that the recombinant GST-EhHbox binds to the reported 
TGACAG and TGATTGAT motifs. Down-regulation of EiHbox1 by gene silencing reduced 
Chitin synthase, Jacob, and increased Jessie gene expression, resulting in 
defective cysts and decreased encystation efficiency and viability. Overall, our 
results suggest that the TALE homeobox family has been conserved during 
evolution and acts as a transcription factor to control the differentiation of 
Entamoeba by regulating the key encystation-induced genes.

ABSTRACTThe purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a 
supplementation with specific collagen peptides (SCP) combined with resistance 
training (RT) on changes in structural properties of the patellar tendon. 
Furthermore, tendon stiffness as well as maximal voluntary knee extension 
strength and cross-sectional area (CSA) of the rectus femoris muscle were 
assessed. In a randomized, placebo-controlled study, 50 healthy, moderately 
active male participants completed a 14-week resistance training program with 
three weekly sessions (70-85% of 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) for the knee 
extensors. While the SCP group received 5g of specific collagen peptides daily, 
the other group received the same amount of a placebo (PLA) supplement. The SCP 
supplementation led to a significant greater (p < 0.05) increase in patellar 
tendon CSA compared with the PLA group at 60% and 70% of the patellar tendon 
length starting from the proximal insertion. Both groups increased tendon 
stiffness (p < 0.01), muscle CSA (p < 0.05) and muscular strength (p < 0.001) 
throughout the intervention without significant differences between the groups. 
The current study shows that in healthy, moderately active men, supplementation 
of SCP in combination with RT leads to greater increase in patellar tendon CSA 
than RT alone. Since underlying mechanisms of tendon hypertrophy are currently 
unknown, further studies should investigate potential mechanisms causing the 
increased morphology adaptions following SCP supplementation.Trial registration: 
German Clinical Trials Register identifier: DRKS00029244..

Plain Language Summary: A daily supplementation of 5 g of specific collagen 
peptides during 14 weeks of high-load resistance training increase patellar 
tendon hypertrophy compared to the same training regimen and placebo.The 
resistance training-induced CSA increase, which was most pronounced on proximal 
and medial patellar tendon sites, is uniformly potentiated along the entire 
tendon length by supplementation.Patellar tendon stiffness, CSA of the rectus 
femoris muscle and maximal voluntary knee extension strength increase due to 
training independently from supplementation.Increased tendon CSA as a result of 
a stimulating effect of the supplementation with specific collagen peptides on 
collagen synthesis might be able to decrease tendon stress and support tendon 
healing.

BACKGROUND: Person-centred goal planning is increasingly being incorporated into 
healthcare interventions. People experiencing severe and persistent mental 
illnesses (SPMIs) have high levels of co-occurring health conditions, reducing 
their life expectancy when compared with the general population. As medications 
are commonly used in the treatment of SPMIs, community pharmacists are 
well-placed to support the health and wellbeing of this population.
OBJECTIVES: To examine pharmacists' and service users' experiences of goal 
planning as a component of a community pharmacy-based health intervention for 
people experiencing SPMIs (PharMIbridge intervention).
METHODS: This study utilised a qualitative exploratory approach with an 
interpretive description method. Semistructured interviews were undertaken with 
community pharmacists (n = 16) and service user participants (n = 26) who had 
participated in pharmacist support services for people experiencing SPMIs 
(PharMIbridge intervention).
RESULTS: Four themes relating to goal planning were identified. First, goal 
planning provided purpose and motivation for participation in the intervention. 
Planning realistic goals was important but often challenging. Both pharmacists 
and service users highlighted the relational aspects of goal planning and how 
strong relationships supported positive behaviour change and outcomes. Finally, 
individualised and flexible approaches were important aspects of the 
intervention, ensuring goals were meaningful to service users.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study identified positive outcomes from the 
inclusion of goal-planning processes in a community pharmacy-based health 
intervention. Further research regarding tools, strategies or training that 
could support future goal-planning interventions in primary healthcare is 
needed.
PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The PharMIbridge randomised controlled trial 
research team included lived experience members and was overseen by an expert 
panel that included members with a lived experience of mental illness and 
representatives from key organisations. The training provided to pharmacists was 
co-designed and co-delivered by the researchers and lived experience 
representatives, and pharmacists were supported by lived experience mentors. 
Service user participants were invited to participate in the interviews through 
a number of pathways (e.g., at the completion of the intervention, flyers). 
Those interested were provided with the full study participant information and 
provided with a $30 gift voucher at the conclusion of the interview.

INTRODUCTION: There are genuine concerns that long-term use of anti-retroviral 
drugs may be associated with reproductive complications in females. This study 
aimed to ascertain the effect of highly active anti-retroviral drugs on the 
ovarian reserve and reproductive potential of female Wistar rats and by 
extension to HIV-positive human females.
METHODS: A total of 25 female Wistar rats, weighing between 140g and 162g, were 
randomly allotted into non-intervention and intervention groups, receiving the 
anti-retroviral drugs, Efavirenz (EFV), Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF), 
Lamivudine (3TC), and a fixed-dose combination (FDC). The dosage was 
administered orally at 8 am daily for 4 weeks. Serum concentrations of 
anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising 
hormone (LH), and estradiol were measured using standard biochemical techniques 
(ELISA). Follicular counts were made on fixed ovarian tissue from the sacrificed 
rats.
RESULTS: The mean AMH level for the control group and the EFV, TDF, 3TC, and FDC 
groups were 11.20, 6.75, 7.30, 8.27, and 6.60 pmol/L, respectively. The EFV and
