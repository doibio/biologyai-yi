instrument using mapping coefficients.
RESULTS: The sample size required to detect a 20% difference in the MCID for the 
global rating of improvement was 52 per trial arm, 172 per arm for the 
incontinence-specific HRQOL outcome, and 500 per arm for the generic 
preference-based HRQOL outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: We caution that treatment trials of conditions for which 
improvements are not easy to measure on generic HRQOL instruments will still 
require significantly greater sample size even when mapping functions are used 
to try to gain efficiency.

OBJECTIVES: To develop a model to predict EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire 
(EQ-5D) values from clinical chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
questionnaire (CCQ) scores.
METHODS: We used data from three clinical trials (the Randomized Clinical Trial 
on Effectiveness of Integrated COPD Management in Primary Care [RECODE], the 
Assessment Of Going Home Under Early Assisted Discharge [GO-AHEAD], and the 
Health Status Guided COPD Care [MARCH]). Data were randomly split into an 
estimation sample and a validation sample. The conceptual similarity between 
patient-reported CCQ and preference-based EQ-5D scores was assessed using 
correlation and principal-component analysis. Different types of models were 
estimated with increasing complexity. We selected the final models on the basis 
of mean absolute error and root mean square error when comparing predicted and 
observed values from the same population (internal validity) and from different 
trial populations (external validity). We also developed models for different 
country-specific EQ-5D value sets.
RESULTS: The principal-component analysis showed that the CCQ domains functional 
state and mental state are associated with four dimensions of the EQ-5D. The 
EQ-5D dimension pain/discomfort formed a separate construct on which no CCQ item 
loaded. The mean observed EQ-5D values were not significantly different from the 
mean predicted EQ-5D values in internal validation samples but did significantly 
differ in external validation samples. The models underestimated EQ-5D values in 
milder health states and overestimated them in more severe health states. The 
predictive ability of the models was similar across different EQ-5D value sets.
CONCLUSIONS: The models can predict mean EQ-5D values that are similar to 
observed mean values in a similar population. The overestimating/underestimating 
of the low/high EQ-5D values, however, limits its use in Markov models. 
Therefore, mapping should be used cautiously.

OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the cost-effectiveness of diabetes 
interventions, identify high-value diabetes services, and estimate potential 
gains from increasing their utilization.
METHODS: The study consisted of two steps. First, we reviewed cost-utility 
analyses (CUAs) related to diabetes published through the end of 2012, using the 
Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry (www.cearegistry.org). 
We used logistic regression to examine factors independently associated with 
favorable cost-effective ratios. Second, we used the Humedica electronic medical 
records to estimate potential savings and health benefits gained by shifting 
patients currently receiving low-value services to high-value alternatives.
RESULTS: We identified 196 diabetes CUAs, of which 55% examined pharmaceuticals. 
Most (70%) diabetes CUAs focused on treatment rather than prevention. Most used 
a health care payer perspective and were industry-sponsored. Of the 497 
published cost-utility ratios, 82% examined an intervention recommended by 
diabetes guidelines. Approximately 73% of the interventions were cost-saving or 
below $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Logistic regression analysis 
showed that higher-quality CUAs, CUAs conducted from the US perspective, 
surgical interventions, and guideline-recommended interventions were more likely 
to report favorable ratios. Of the 7907 eligible patients with diabetes in our 
sample, up to 7117 could in principle be shifted to cost-saving treatments, 
reducing costs by $12.5 million and gaining more than 1938 quality-adjusted 
life-years over a lifetime.
CONCLUSIONS: Most diabetes interventions evaluated by CUAs are recommended by 
practice guidelines and may provide good value for money. Our results indicate 
that patients with diabetes and the health care system could potentially benefit 
from shifting to the greater use of high-value services.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is recently one of the major concerns of the public health 
both in the world and Iran. To inform priorities for cancer control, this study 
estimated years of potential life lost (YPLL) and productivity losses due to 
cancer-related premature mortality in Iran in 2012.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The number of cancer deaths by sex for all cancers and 
the ten leading causes of cancer deaths in Iran in 2012 were obtained from the 
GLOBOCAN database. The life expectancy method and the human capital approach 
were used to estimate the YPLL and the value of productivity lost due to 
cancer-related premature mortality.
RESULTS: There were 53,350 cancer-related deaths in Iran. We estimated that 
these cancer deaths resulted in 1,112,680 YPLL in total, 563,332 (50.6%) in 
males and 549,348 (49.4%) in females. The top 10 ranked cancers accounted for 
75% of total death and 70% of total YPLL in the males and 69% for both death and 
YPLL in the females. The largest contributors for YPLL in the two genders were 
stomach and breast cancers, respectively. The total cost of lost productivity 
due to cancer-related premature mortality discounted at 3% rate in Iran, was US$ 
1.93 billion. The most costly cancer for the males was stomach, while for the 
females it was breast cancer. The percentage of the total costs that were 
attributable to the top 10 cancers was 67% in the males and 71% in the females.
CONCLUSIONS: The YPLL and productivity losses due to cancer-related premature 
mortality are substantial in Iran. Setting resource allocation priorities to 
cancers that occur in younger working-age individuals (such as brain and central 
nervous system) and/or cancers with high incidence and mortality rates (such as 
stomach and breast) could potentially decrease the productivity losses and the 
YPLL to a great extent in Iran.

INTRODUCTION: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been shown to be effective 
in treating steroid-refractory dermatomyositis (DM). There remains no evidence 
of its cost-effectiveness in Thailand.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the cost utility of IVIG as a 
second-line therapy in steroid-refractory DM in Thailand.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the relevant costs and health 
benefits for IVIG plus corticosteroids in comparison with immunosuppressant plus 
corticosteroids in steroid-refractory DM from a societal perspective over a 
patient's lifetime. The effectiveness and utility parameters were obtained from 
clinical literature, meta-analyses, medical record reviews, and patient 
interviews, whereas cost data were obtained from an electronic hospital database 
and patient interviews. Costs are presented in $US, year 2012 values. All future 
costs and outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3% per annum. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, the model estimated treatment under IVIG plus 
corticosteroids to be cost saving compared with immunosuppressant plus 
corticosteroids, where the saving of costs and incremental quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) were $US4738.92 and 1.96 QALYs, respectively. Sensitivity 
analyses revealed that probability of response of immunosuppressant plus 
corticosteroids was the most influential parameter on incremental QALYs and 
costs. At a societal willingness-to-pay threshold in Thailand of $US5148 per 
QALY gained, the probability of IVIG being cost effective was 97.6%.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of IVIG plus corticosteroids is cost saving compared with 
treatment with immunosuppressant plus corticosteroids in Thai patients with 
steroid-refractory DM. Policy makers should consider using our findings in their 
decision-making process for adding IVIG to corticosteroids as the second-line 
therapy for steroid-refractory DM patients.

BACKGROUND: The concept of pharmaceutical care is operationalized through 
pharmaceutical professional services, which are patient-oriented to optimize 
their pharmacotherapy and to improve clinical outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a medication review with follow-up (MRF) 
service for older adults with polypharmacy in Spanish community pharmacies 
against the alternative of having their medication dispensed normally.
METHODS: The study was designed as a cluster randomized controlled trial, and 
was carried out over a time horizon of 6 months. The target population was older 
adults with polypharmacy, defined as individuals taking five or more medicines 
per day. The study was conducted in 178 community pharmacies in Spain. 
Cost-utility analysis adopted a health service perspective. Costs were in euros 
at 2014 prices and the effectiveness of the intervention was estimated as 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). In order to analyze the uncertainty of ICER 
results, we performed a non-parametric bootstrapping with 5000 replications.
RESULTS: A total of 1403 older adults, aged between 65 and 94 years, were 
enrolled in the study: 688 in the intervention group (IG) and 715 in the control 
group (CG). By the end of the follow-up, both groups had reduced the mean number 
of prescribed medications they took, although this reduction was greater in the 
IG (0.28 ± 1.25 drugs; p < 0.001) than in the CG (0.07 ± 0.95 drugs; p = 0.063). 
Older adults in the IG saw their quality of life improved by 0.0528 ± 0.20 
(p < 0.001). In contrast, the CG experienced a slight reduction in their quality 
of life: 0.0022 ± 0.24 (p = 0.815). The mean total cost was 
<euro>977.57 ± 1455.88 for the IG and <euro>1173.44 ± 3671.65 for the CG. In 
order to estimate the ICER, we used the costs adjusted for baseline medications 
and QALYs adjusted for baseline utility score, resulting in a mean incremental 
total cost of -<euro>250.51 ± 148.61 (95 % CI -541.79 to 40.76) and a mean 
incremental QALY of 0.0156 ± 0.004 (95 % CI 0.008-0.023). Regarding the results 
from the cost-utility analysis, the MRF service emerged as the dominant 
strategy.
CONCLUSION: The MRF service is an effective intervention for optimizing 
prescribed medication and improving quality of life in older adults with 
polypharmacy in community pharmacies. The results from the cost-utility analysis 
suggest that the MRF service is cost effective.

A massacred village community? Agent-based modelling sheds new light on the 
demography of the Neolithic mass grave of Talheim.

The virtual experiments presented below reveal the counterintuitive 
archaeological demography of the Neolithic mass grave of Talheim and underline 
the importance of distinguishing between the demographic structures of living 
and dead populations, as well as between attritional and catastrophic mortality 
patterns. We utilise a new agent-based modelling approach called Population & 
Cemetery Simulator based on the NetLogo programming language and the Behaviour 
Composer of the modelling4all project, which allows us to extrapolate from dead 
to living populations and vice versa. Contrary to received opinion, we argue 
that the population of the Neolithic mass grave holds specific demographic 
information only, as it represents a pure catastrophic mortality pattern, i.e. a 
living population at a single point in time rather than the population of a 
conventional cemetery. The first experiments illustrate why the published 
demographic data (e.g. mortality, life expectancy, mean age at death) is 
misleading. It is illogical to utilise mortality tables devised for conventional 
(attritional) cemeteries in the case of living populations. Modelled populations 
with the published mortality rates of the massacre site are, furthermore, unable 
to stand up to plausible human demographic circumstances. In the second part, we 
evaluate the actual demographic information content of the Talheim sample. 
Comparative modelling illustrates that the Talheim population appears to be 
similar to possible living populations based on the mortuary record of 
Schwetzingen, an isochronal site of the Linear Pottery Culture (LBK), and 
Bärenthal, a site which dates back to the early medieval period (7th to 10th 
centuries). It is therefore very likely that the Talheim population is a 
representative sample of a living population in the LBK and might even represent 
a massacred village community in its entirety.

New pathogenic insights into rheumatoid arthritis.

Jutley G(1), Raza K, Buckley CD.

University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a heterogeneous chronic 
immune-mediated inflammatory disease, associated with significant morbidity and 
reduced life expectancy. Here, we review recent discoveries; particularly those 
which have attempted to integrate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with 
biological pathways and cell types known to play a role in disease pathology in 
order to expand our current understanding of the pathogenesis of RA. As the role 
of stromal cells in the pathogenesis of RA has been reviewed in detail in 
Current Opinions in Rheumatology, this area will not be covered in this review.
RECENT FINDINGS: Although our understandings of the pathogenic processes that 
drive disease in RA remain incomplete, remarkable advances over the past year 
can be highlighted. GWAS have raised awareness of important new risk loci with 
genes that either are the targets of approved therapies for RA, or involve 
pathways for drugs that could be repurposed from other disease indications such 
as cancer. Furthermore, promising strides have been made in predicting the 
likelihood of developing RA in those at risk using human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA), smoking, and autoantibody status prediction models. These findings give a 
fresh insight into RA pathogenesis and help identify new, or repurpose known 
therapeutic targets from other disease areas.
SUMMARY: The findings discussed in this review underscore the progress made to 
date and the need for future studies, investigating disease mechanisms in RA, 
with particular interest in at-risk RA gene loci, their function in immune and 
stromal cells within the synovium, and how they interact with environmental 
factors to initiate and perpetuate disease.

Cost-effectiveness and budget impact of hepatitis C virus treatment with 
sofosbuvir and ledipasvir in the United States.

Chhatwal J, Kanwal F, Roberts MS, Dunn MA.

BACKGROUND: Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, which have recently been approved for 
treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, are more efficacious and 
safer than the old standard of care (oSOC) but are substantially more expensive. 
Whether and in which patients their improved efficacy justifies their increased 
cost is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of sofosbuvir 
and ledipasvir.
DESIGN: Microsimulation model of the natural history of HCV infection.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature.
TARGET POPULATION: Treatment-naive and treatment-experienced HCV population 
defined on the basis of HCV genotype, age, and fibrosis distribution in the 
United States.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer.
INTERVENTION: Simulation of sofosbuvir-ledipasvir compared with the oSOC 
(interferon-based therapies).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and 5-year spending on antiviral drugs.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Sofosbuvir-based therapies added 0.56 QALY 
relative to the oSOC at an ICER of $55 400 per additional QALY. The ICERs ranged 
from $9700 to $284 300 per QALY depending on the patient's status with respect 
to treatment history, HCV genotype, and presence of cirrhosis. At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY, sofosbuvir-based therapies 
were cost-effective in 83% of treatment-naive and 81% of treatment-experienced 
patients. Compared with the oSOC, treating eligible HCV-infected persons in the 
United States with the new drugs would cost an additional $65 billion in the 
next 5 years, whereas the resulting cost offsets would be $16 billion.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to drug price, drug 
efficacy, and quality of life after successful treatment.
LIMITATION: Data on real-world effectiveness of new antivirals are lacking.
CONCLUSION: Treatment of HCV is cost-effective in most patients, but additional 
resources and value-based patient prioritization are needed to manage patients 
with HCV.

Existing models explaining the evolution of sexual dimorphism in the timing of 
emergence (SDT) in Lepidoptera assume equal mortality rates for males and 
females. The limiting assumption of equal mortality rates has the consequence 
that these models are only able to explain the evolution of emergence of males 
before females, i.e. protandry-the more common temporal sequence of emergence in 
Lepidoptera. The models fail, however, in providing adaptive explanations for 
the evolution of protogyny, where females emerge before males, but protogyny is 
not rare in insects. The assumption of equal mortality rates seems too 
restrictive for many insects, such as butterflies. To investigate the influence 
of unequal mortality rates on the evolution of SDT, we present a generalised 
version of a previously published model where we relax this assumption. We find 
that longer life-expectancy of females compared to males can indeed favour the 
evolution of protogyny as a fitness enhancing strategy. Moreover, the encounter 
rate between females and males and the sex-ratio are two important factors that 
also influence the evolution of optimal SDT. If considered independently for 
females and males the predicted strategies can be shown to be evolutionarily 
stable (ESS). Under the assumption of equal mortality rates the difference 
between the females' and males' ESS remains typically very small. However, 
female and male ESS may be quite dissimilar if mortality rates are different. 
This creates the potential for an 'evolutionary conflict' between females and 
males. Bagworm moths (Lepidoptera: Psychidae) provide an exemplary case where 
life-history attributes are such that protogyny should indeed be the optimal 
emergence strategy from the males' and females' perspectives: (i) Female 
longevity is considerably larger than that of males, (ii) encounter rates 
between females and males are presumably low, and (iii) females mate only once. 
Protogyny is indeed the general mating strategy found in the bagworm family.

BACKGROUND: Early, goal-directed therapy (EGDT) is recommended in international 
guidelines for the resuscitation of patients presenting with early septic shock. 
However, adoption has been limited, and uncertainty about its effectiveness 
remains.
METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic randomized trial with an integrated 
cost-effectiveness analysis in 56 hospitals in England. Patients were randomly 
assigned to receive either EGDT (a 6-hour resuscitation protocol) or usual care. 
The primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days.
RESULTS: We enrolled 1260 patients, with 630 assigned to EGDT and 630 to usual 
care. By 90 days, 184 of 623 patients (29.5%) in the EGDT group and 181 of 620 
patients (29.2%) in the usual-care group had died (relative risk in the EGDT 
group, 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.20; P=0.90), for an 
absolute risk reduction in the EGDT group of -0.3 percentage points (95% CI, 
-5.4 to 4.7). Increased treatment intensity in the EGDT group was indicated by 
increased use of intravenous fluids, vasoactive drugs, and red-cell transfusions 
and reflected by significantly worse organ-failure scores, more days receiving 
advanced cardiovascular support, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. 
There were no significant differences in any other secondary outcomes, including 
health-related quality of life, or in rates of serious adverse events. On 
average, EGDT increased costs, and the probability that it was cost-effective 
was below 20%.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with septic shock who were identified early and 
received intravenous antibiotics and adequate fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic 
management according to a strict EGDT protocol did not lead to an improvement in 
outcome. (Funded by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research

OBJECTIVE: The role of prostate cancer (PC) screening is currently being 
questioned. The objective of the European Randomized Study of Screening for 
Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) was to demonstrate whether PC screening reduced 
mortality from this disease. The results from the Spanish branch of this study 
are presented: all-cause and cancer-specific mortality, the characteristics of 
the detected tumors, primary treatments and progression to advanced disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 18,612 men, between the ages of 45 and 70, were 
invited to participate in the study, excluding those with a life expectancy of 
less than 10 years. The men were randomized to the screening arm (serum 
prostate-specific antigen [PSA] reading) or the control arm (no diagnostic 
tests). Randomized transrectal ultrasound-guided sextant prostate biopsies were 
indicated for the men in the screening arm with PSA levels ≥3ng/ml. The detected 
PCs were identified (stage and primary treatment), as well as the deaths that 
occurred (date and cause of death).
RESULTS: The study was performed with 4276 men (2415 in the screening arm and 
1861 in the control arm). The median age and serum PSA level were 57 years and 
0.90ng/mL, respectively. The median follow-up time was 15.8 years. A total of 
242 PCs were diagnosed, 162 (6.7%) in the screening arm and 80 (4.3%) in the 
control arm (P<.001). Of these, 214 (88.4%) had an organ-confined clinical stage 
at onset (91.4% in the screening arm vs. 82.5% in the control arm; P=.024). A 
total of 112 patients (46.3%) underwent radical prostatectomy, 53 (21.9%) 
underwent prostate radiation therapy, 24 (9.9%) underwent hormone therapy and 47 
(19.4%) were kept under observation. A total of 18 PCs progressed to advanced 
disease (M+ or PSA levels >100ng/mL), with no differences between the study arms 
(P=.938). A total of 618 (14.5%) patients died during follow-up: 340 (14.1%) in 
the screening arm and 278 (14.9%) in the control arm, with no differences 
between the arms in terms of cancer-specific (P=.907) or all-cause (P=.399) 
mortality. The main causes of death were neoplasia (54.0%), cardiovascular 
(17.6%), respiratory (8.7%) and gastrointestinal (4.0%), with no difference 
between study arms. Of the 334 patients who died from neoplasia, only 12 (3.6%) 
died from PC.
CONCLUSIONS: PC screening results in a shifting of the diagnosis towards earlier 
stages. Nevertheless, we have not demonstrated a benefit in terms of overall or 
cancer-specific survival after more than 15 years of follow-up. The low 
mortality from this disease in our community could be one of the main factors 
that explain these results.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Choosing the best surgical treatment for patients with 
spinal metastases remains a significant challenge for spine surgeons. There is 
currently no gold standard for surgical treatments. The Aarhus Spinal Metastases 
Algorithm (ASMA) was established to help surgeons choose the most appropriate 
surgical intervention for patients with spinal metastases.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of 
stratified surgical interventions based on the ASMA, which combines life 
expectancy and the anatomical classification of patients with spinal metastases 
to inform surgical decision making.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a retrospective study based on a prospective 
database.
PATIENT SAMPLE: A consecutive series of 515 spinal metastatic patients who 
underwent surgically treatment from December 1992 to June 2012 in Aarhus 
University Hospital were included prospectively and analyzed in detail 
retrospectively.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival time after surgery was determined for all patients. 
Neurological function was assessed using the Frankel score preoperatively and 
postoperatively (at the time of discharge). Complete outcome data were retrieved 
in 97.5% of this cohort.
METHODS: Patients with spinal metastases were identified from an institutional 
database that prospectively collected data since 1992. Survival status data were 
obtained from a national registry. Neurological function was determined from the 
same institutional database or local Electronic Patient Journal system. Surgeons 
evaluated and classified patients into five surgical groups preoperatively by 
using the revised Tokuhashi score (TS) and the Tomita anatomical classification 
(TC).
RESULTS: The overall median survival time of the cohort was 6.8 (95% confidence 
interval: 6.1-7.9) months. The median survival times in the five surgical groups 
determined by the ASMA were 2.1 (TS 0-4, TC 1-7), 5.1 (TS 5-8, TC 1-7), 12.1 (TS 
9-11, TC 1-7 or TS 12-15, TC 7), 26.0 (TS 12-15, TC 4-6), and 36.0 (TS 12-15, TC 
1-3) months. The 30-day mortality rate was 7.5%. Postoperative neurological 
function was maintained or improved in 469 patients (92.3%). Overall reoperation 
rate was 13.5%, commonly because of postoperative hematoma and new limb 
weakness.
CONCLUSIONS: The ASMA recommends at least two surgical options for a particular 
patient by determining the preoperative life expectancy and anatomical 
classification of the spinal metastases. This algorithm could help spine 
surgeons to discriminate the risks of surgeries. The ASMA provides a tool to 
guild surgeons to evaluate the spinal metastases patients, select potential 
optimal surgery, and avoid life-threatening risks.

BACKGROUND: New hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatments deliver higher cure rates 
with fewer contraindications, increasing demand for treatment and healthcare 
costs. The cost-effectiveness of new treatments is unknown.
METHODS: We conducted a microsimulation of guideline testing followed by 
alternative treatment regimens for HCV among the US population aged 20 and older 
to estimate cases identified, treated, sustained viral response, deaths, medical 
costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of different treatment options expressed as 
discounted lifetime costs and benefits from the healthcare perspective.
RESULTS: Compared to treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PR), and 
a protease inhibitor for HCV genotype (G) 1 and PR alone for G2/3, treatment 
with PR and Sofosbuvir (PRS) for G1/4 and treatment with Sofosbuvir and 
ribavirin (SR) for G2/3 increased QALYs by 555 226, reduced deaths by 80 682, 
and increased costs by $26.2 billion at an ICER of $47 304 per QALY gained. As 
compared to PRS/SR, treating with an all oral regimen of Sofosbuvir and 
Simeprevir (SS) for G1/4 and SR for G2/3, increased QALYs by 1 110 451 and 
reduced deaths by an additional 164 540 at an incremental cost of $80.1 billion 
and an ICER of $72 169. In sensitivity analysis, where treatment with SS 
effectiveness was set to the list price of Viekira Pak and then Harvoni, 
treatment cost $24 921 and $25 405 per QALY gained as compared to PRS/SR.
CONCLUSIONS: New treatments are cost-effectiveness per person treated, but 
pent-up demand for treatment may create challenges for financing.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of noncardia gastric 
adenocarcinoma (NCGA) screening strategies based on new biomarker and endoscopic 
technologies.
DESIGN: Using an intestinal-type NCGA microsimulation model, we evaluated the 
following one-time screening strategies for US men: (1) serum pepsinogen to 
detect gastric atrophy (with endoscopic follow-up of positive screen results), 
(2) endoscopic screening to detect dysplasia and asymptomatic cancer (with 
endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) treatment for detected lesions) and (3) 
Helicobacter pylori screening and treatment. Screening performance, treatment 
effectiveness, cancer and cost data were based on published literature and 
databases. Subgroups included current, former and never smokers. Outcomes 
included lifetime cancer risk and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), 
expressed as cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Screening the general population at age 50 years reduced the lifetime 
intestinal-type NCGA risk (0.24%) by 26.4% with serum pepsinogen screening, 
21.2% with endoscopy and EMR and 0.2% with H. pylori screening/treatment. 
Targeting current smokers reduced the lifetime risk (0.35%) by 30.8%, 25.5%, and 
0.1%, respectively. For all subgroups, serum pepsinogen screening was more 
effective and more cost-effective than all other strategies, although its ICER 
varied from $76,000/QALY (current smokers) to $105,400/QALY (general 
population). Results were sensitive to H. pylori prevalence, screen age and 
serum pepsinogen test sensitivity. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that 
at a $100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, the probability that serum 
pepsinogen screening was preferred was 0.97 for current smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: Although not warranted for the general population, targeting 
high-risk smokers for serum pepsinogen screening may be a cost-effective 
strategy to reduce intestinal-type NCGA mortality.

OBJECTIVE: Reconstruction and long-term stabilization of segmental diaphyseal 
bone defects of the humerus, femur, and tibia.
INDICATIONS: Segmental bone defects due to aggressive benign or primary 
malignant bone tumors, trauma, pathological fractures, osteomyelitis, or failed 
osteosynthesis.
CONTRAINDICATIONS: Acute or chronic local infections, large metadiaphyseal bone 
defects preventing adequate anchorage of the prosthesis, very short life 
expectancy (<3 months).
SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Exposure and resection of the bony defect according to the 
preoperative planning. Reaming of the intramedullary canals proximally and 
distally followed by implantation of the stems (cemented or noncemented). 
Reducing sleeves can be used to bridge the difference in diameter between the 
nail and the spacer. Mounting of the spacer half shell with the threaded holes 
from underneath after adjusting for alignment and rotation. Assembling of the 
other half shell by guided pins to ensure proper alignment. Tightening of the 
clamping screws using a torque screwdriver. Connection of two spacers is 
possible.
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Active physiotherapy and full weight bearing; 
antibiotic prophylaxis.
RESULTS: The results of 14 consecutive patients treated with 15 modular 
intercalary endoprostheses (Osteobridge™, Merete, Berlin, Germany) between 
January 2007 and January 2012 with a mean follow up of 24 ± 12 months (range 
12-51 months) were evaluated retrospectively. One patient had a primary 
malignant bone tumor, while all the other patients underwent resection for 
metastatic disease. The mean age at surgery was 65.9 ± 15.7 years (range 25-83 
years). The mean diaphyseal reconstruction length was 110 ± 50 mm (range 50-190 
mm). Three patients (20%) required revision of the distal stem due to aseptic 
loosening. Evaluation of the functional outcome using the MSTS score by Enneking 
revealed 3 very good (22%), 7 good (50%), 4 fair (28%), and no poor results.

PURPOSE: Although many patients with mycosis fungoides presenting with stage I 
disease enjoy an indolent disease course and normal life expectancy, about 15% 
to 20% of them progress to higher stages and most ultimately succumb to their 
disease. Currently, it is not possible to predict which patients will progress 
and which patients will have a stable disease. Previously, we conducted 
microarray analyses with RT-PCR validation of gene expression in biopsy 
specimens from 60 patients with stage I-IV cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), 
identified three distinct clusters based upon transcription profile, and 
correlated our molecular findings with 6 years of clinical follow-up.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We test by RT-PCR within our prediction model the 
expression of about 240 genes that were previously reported to play an important 
role in CTCL carcinogenesis. We further extend the clinical follow-up of our 
patients to 11 years. We compare the expression of selected genes between 
mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome and benign inflammatory dermatoses that often 
mimic this cancer.
RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that 52 of the about 240 genes can be 
classified into cluster 1-3 expression patterns and such expression is 
consistent with their suggested biologic roles. Moreover, we determined that 17 
genes (CCL18, CCL26, FYB, T3JAM, MMP12, LEF1, LCK, ITK, GNLY, IL2RA, IL26, IL22, 
CCR4, GTSF1, SYCP1, STAT5A, and TOX) are able to both identify patients who are 
at risk of progression and also distinguish mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome 
from benign mimickers.
CONCLUSIONS: This study, combined with other gene expression analyses, prepares 
the foundation for the development of personalized molecular approach toward 
diagnosis and treatment of CTCL.

Educational inequalities in young-adult mortality between the 1990s and the 
2000s: regional differences in Belgium.

BACKGROUND: This study addresses educational inequalities in young-adult 
mortality between the 1990s and the 2000s by comparing trends in the three 
different regions in Belgium stratified by sex. Social inequalities in mortality 
are of major concern to public health but are rarely studied at young ages. 
Substantial health differences have been found between the Flemish (FR) and 
Walloon region (WR) concerning (healthy) life expectancy and avoidable 
mortality, but little is known about regional differentials in young-adult 
mortality, and comparisons with the Brussels-Capital Region (BCR) have thus far 
never been made.
METHODS: Data are derived from record linkage between the Belgian censuses of 
1991 and 2001 and register data on death and emigration for the periods 
01/03/1991-01/03/1999 and 01/10/2001-01/10/2009. Analyses are restricted to 
young adults aged 25 to 34 years at the moment of each of the censuses. Absolute 
(directly standardized mortality rates (ASMRs)) and relative (mortality rate 
ratio using Poisson regression) measures were calculated.
RESULTS: There is a significant drop in young-adult mortality between the 1990s 
and the 2000s in all regions and both sexes, with the strongest decline in the 
BCR (e.g. ASMR of men declined from 165.6 [151.1-180.1] per 100,000 person years 
to 73.8 [88.3-98.3]). The mortality rates remain highest in the WR in the 2000s 
Between the 1990s and the 2000s, a remarkable change in the educational 
distribution occurred as well, with much lower proportions of primary educated 
in all regions in the 2000s in favour of higher proportions in all other 
educational levels, especially in higher education. All educational groups show 
lower mortality over time, except for lower educated men in the FR.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a positive evolution towards lower mortality among the 
young-adult Belgian population. The WR trails behind in this evolution, which 
calls for tailored preventive actions. Educational inequalities are marked in 
all regions and time periods. A more general discussion is needed on the 
responsibility of society in rendering support and capability to enhance the 
state of well-being of those not able to achieve a high social position.

BACKGROUND: Lower estimated glomerular filtration rate is associated with 
reduced life expectancy. Whether this association is modified by the presence or 
absence of albuminuria, another cardinal finding of chronic kidney disease, is 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the life expectancy of middle-aged men 
and women with varying levels of eGFR and concomitant albuminuria.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: A large population-based cohort identified from the provincial 
laboratory registry in Alberta, Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged ≥30 years who had outpatient measures of serum 
creatinine and albuminuria between May 1, 2002 and March 31, 2008.
PREDICTOR: Baseline levels of kidney function identified from serum creatinine 
and albuminuria measurements.
OUTCOMES: all cause mortality during the follow-up.
METHODS: Patients were categorized based on their estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) (≥60, 45-59, 30-44, and 15-29 mL/min/1 · 73 m(2)) as well 
as albuminuria (normal, mild, and heavy) measured by albumin-to-creatinine ratio 
or urine dipstick. The abridged life table method was applied to calculate the 
life expectancies of men and women from age 40 to 80 years across combined eGFR 
and albuminuria categories. We also categorized participants by severity of 
kidney disease (low risk, moderately increased risk, high risk, and very high
