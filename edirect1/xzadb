years of age and a 2003 US birth cohort.
INTERVENTIONS: Hypothetical routine vaccination of adolescents (1 dose at 11 
years of age), toddlers (1 dose at 1 year of age), and infants (3 doses at 2, 4, 
and 6 months of age). Each vaccination scenario was compared with a 
"no-vaccination" scenario.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Meningococcal cases and deaths prevented, cost per case 
prevented, cost per life-year saved, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
saved.
RESULTS: Routine MCV-4 vaccination of US adolescents (11 years of age) would 
prevent 270 meningococcal cases and 36 deaths in the vaccinated cohort over 22 
years, a decrease of 46% in the expected burden of disease. Before program costs 
are counted, adolescent vaccination would reduce direct disease costs by $18 
million and decrease productivity losses by $50 million. At a cost per 
vaccination (average public-private price per dose plus administration fees) of 
$82.50, adolescent vaccination would cost society $633000 per meningococcal case 
prevented and $121000 per life-year saved. Key variables influencing results 
were disease incidence, case-fatality ratio, and cost per vaccination. The 
cost-effectiveness of toddler vaccination is essentially equivalent to 
adolescent vaccination, whereas infant vaccination would be much less 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine MCV-4 vaccination of US children would reduce the burden of 
disease in vaccinated cohorts but at a relatively high net societal cost. The 
projected cost-effectiveness of adolescent vaccination approaches that of 
recently adopted childhood vaccines under conditions of above-average 
meningococcal disease incidence or at a lower cost per vaccination.

Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2005 May 3;142(9):I36.

BACKGROUND: Treatment guidelines recommend drug treatment to prevent fractures 
for some postmenopausal women who have low bone mass (osteopenia) but do not 
have osteoporosis or a history of clinical fractures.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the societal costs and health benefits of alendronate 
drug treatment to prevent fractures in postmenopausal women with osteopenia.
DESIGN: Markov model with 8 health states: no fracture, post-distal forearm 
fracture, post-clinical vertebral fracture, post-radiographic (but clinically 
inapparent) vertebral fracture, post-hip fracture, post-hip and vertebral 
fractures, post-other fracture, and death.
DATA SOURCES: Population-based studies of age-specific fracture rates and costs, 
prospectively measured estimates of disutility after fractures, and the Fracture 
Intervention Trial of alendronate versus placebo to prevent fracture.
TARGET POPULATION: Postmenopausal women 55 to 75 years of age with femoral neck 
T-scores between -1.5 and -2.4.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTIONS: Five years of alendronate therapy or no drug treatment.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: For women with no additional fracture risk 
factors, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained ranged from 70,000 
dollars to 332,000 dollars, depending on age and femoral neck bone density.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: Results were sensitive to changes in fracture 
risk reduction attributable to alendronate and alendronate cost.
LIMITATIONS: Results apply only to postmenopausal white women residing in the 
United States.
CONCLUSION: Alendronate therapy for postmenopausal women with femoral neck 
T-scores better than -2.5 and no history of clinical fractures or other bone 
mineral density-independent risk factors for fracture is not cost-effective, 
assuming U.S. costs of alendronate and currently available estimates of 
alendronate efficacy in osteopenic women.

BACKGROUND: Indications for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy have 
expanded to include cardiopulmonary arrest and support after congenital heart 
surgery. Data from a national registry have reported that cardiac patients have 
the poorest survival of all extracorporeal membrane oxygenation recipients. 
Concerns have been raised about the appropriateness of such an aggressive 
strategy, especially in light of the high costs and potential for long-term 
neurologic disability. We reviewed our experience with salvage cardiac 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to determine the cost-utility, which 
accounts for both costs and quality of life.
METHODS: Medical records of patients with congenital heart disease receiving 
salvage cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between January 2000 and May 
2004 were reviewed. Charges for all medical care after the institution of 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were determined and converted to costs by 
published standards. The quality-of-life status of survivors was determined with 
the Health Utilities Index Mark II.
RESULTS: Salvage cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was instituted in 
32 patients (18 for cardiopulmonary arrest and 14 for cardiac failure after 
heart surgery) at a median age of 2.0 months (range, 4 days to 5.1 years). 
Congenital heart disease was present in 27 (84%). The mean duration of 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was 5.1 +/- 4.1 days. Survival to 
hospital discharge was 50%, including 1 patient bridged to heart 
transplantation. Survival to 1 year was 47%. The mean score of the Health 
Utilities Index for the survivors was 0.75 +/- 0.19 (range, 0.41-1.0). The 
median cost for hospital stay after the institution of extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation was USD 156,324 per patient. The calculated cost-utility for salvage 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in this population was USD 24,386 per 
quality-adjusted life-year saved, which would be considered within the range of 
accepted cost-efficacy (< USD 50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved).
CONCLUSIONS: Salvage cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation results in 
reasonable survival and is justified on a cost-utility basis.

Pharmacological mechanisms contributing to the clinical efficacy of 
levosimendan.

Acute decompensation of chronic heart failure is a direct life-threatening 
situation with short-term mortality approaching 30%. A number of maladaptive 
changes are amplified within the cardiovascular system during the progression of 
chronic heart failure that makes the decompensation phase difficult to handle. 
Levosimendan is a new Ca2+-sensitizer for the treatment of acutely decompensated 
heart failure that has proved to be effective during the decompensation of 
chronic heart failure and acute myocardial infarction. Levosimendan differs from 
other cardiotonic agents that are used for acute heart failure in that it 
utilizes a unique dual mechanism of action: Ca2+-sensitization through binding 
to troponin C in the myocardium, and the opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in 
vascular smooth muscle. In general, these mechanisms evoke positive inotropy and 
vasodilation. Clinical studies suggested long-term benefits on mortality 
following short-term administration. It may, therefore, be inferred that 
levosimendan has additional effects on the cardiovascular system that are 
responsible for the prolongation of survival. Results of preclinical and 
clinical investigations suggest that the combination of levosimendan-induced 
cardiac and vascular changes has favorable effects on the coronary, pulmonary 
and peripheral circulations. Redistribution of the circulating blood offers an 
improved hemodynamic context for the development of a positive inotropic effect 
through Ca2+-sensitization of the contractile filaments, without a proportionate 
increase in myocardial oxygen consumption or the development of arrhythmias. 
Activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, both on sarcolemma and mitochondria, 
may protect against myocardial ischemia, and decreased levels of cytokines may 
prevent the development of further myocardial remodeling. Collectively, these 
effects of levosimendan shift the disturbed cardiovascular parameters towards 
normalization, thereby halting the perpetuation of the vicious cycle of heart 
failure progression. This may contribute to stabilization of the circulation and 
improved life expectancy of patients with chronic heart failure.

Management and long-term follow-up of patients with types III and IV 
laryngotracheoesophageal clefts.

Kawaguchi AL(1), Donahoe PK, Ryan DP.

Author information:
(1)Department of Pediatric Surgery, Mass General Hospital for Children, 
Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.

BACKGROUND: Laryngotracheoesophageal cleft (LTEC) is a rare congenital anomaly 
that occurs when the trachea and esophagus fail to separate during fetal 
development. The 2 most severe forms of LTEC are type III, with extension of the 
cleft from the larynx to the carina, and type IV, with extension of the cleft 
into one or both mainstem bronchi.
METHODS: Over the past 25 years, we have accumulated an experience caring for 9 
patients with severe LTEC, including 4 with type III and 5 with type IV.
RESULTS: Morbidity and mortality from severe LTEC often result from aspiration 
and chronic lung disease. Patients with types III (1/4) and IV (5/5) LTEC have 
an extremely high incidence of microgastria with a shortened esophagus for which 
fundoplication is ineffective. Because gastric feeding often does not initially 
increase stomach volume and may cause severe aspiration, we suggest early 
gastric division with later reconstruction of intestinal continuity in patients 
with microgastria. Postoperative tracheoesophageal fistulas have occurred in 6 
of 9 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Generous interposition of vascularized tissue with a multiple-layer 
closure has helped to prevent further recurrences. Postoperative tracheomalacia 
may be managed with continuous positive airway pressure and may require 
customized endotracheal tubes. Evaluation of respiratory and digestive function, 
school performance, and quality of life for the surviving patients is described.

Classification of systemic sclerosis. Visions and reality.

Systemic sclerosis, scleroderma (SSc) is a disabling condition that shortens 
life expectancy. Disease heterogeneity and difficulties separating SSc from 
SSc-like conditions make classification an important issue. Limited cutaneous 
and diffuse cutaneous SSc, with different severity and survival, have been 
recognized for several years as distinct subsets. Some authors have suggested an 
intermediate cutaneous form with intermediate survival. This issue remains 
unsettled, however. The technique of capillaroscopy is helpful as an adjunct 
diagnostic tool to separate idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon from SSc. Digitized 
video-capillaroscopy is developing as a powerful new method to assess individual 
capillaries over time. Using the simpler techniques of video-capillaroscopy, 
different patterns have been described and named 'early', 'active', 'late' and 
'slow'. The value of nailfold video-capillaroscopy to distinguish different 
subsets or provide prognostic information for use in daily practice remains to 
be assessed. The features of CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud's, oesophagus 
dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasias) are not confined to single subsets 
of SSc. There is no convincing evidence of any advantage for distinguishing the 
limited, intermediate and diffuse forms of SSc rather than only the limited and 
diffuse forms.

In St. Lucia there are increased proportions of elders secondary to decreasing 
fertility and mortality rates and increasing life expectancy. The fact that 
people are living longer is a reflection of social success; however, increasing 
numbers of elders (often with chronic health problems) challenge family, social, 
health, political, and economic systems. Who will provide care and how this care 
will be provided are at the forefront of health and social service planning and 
debate. This paper describes the status of elders in St. Lucia. Expectations as 
well as current care experiences of elders and villagers are described.

BACKGROUND: The indicators of healthy life expectancy measure differences in 
health among various population subgroups more sensitively than do indicators of 
mortality.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze some of the above indicators to 
evaluate the differences among occupational categories in Turin.
METHODS: Mortality tables by occupation were calculated on Turin residents, aged 
18-64 years in 1991, using the Turin Longitudinal Study which combines personal, 
census, and health information for the residents of the city. Longitudinal 
assessments of health expectancy were obtained by means of record-linkage with 
the Cancer Registry, the Diabetes Registry, and hospital discharge records. In 
addition, prevalence estimates of good health, disability, and chronic illness, 
obtained from ISTAT (Central Statistics Institute) investigations in 1999-2000 
were combined with mortality data using Sullivan's algorithm.
RESULTS: Among men there was a systematic disadvantage in almost all indicators 
of health expectancy for some manual occupations, while jobs requiring more 
qualifications were more advantaged. The health profile for women was more 
controversial, with an overall disadvantage among women who were professional 
consultants, although this group showed substantial variability: the legal 
professions had the lowest life and health expectancies, with approximately 3 
years of life less than the health professions, which were among the most 
advantaged.
DISCUSSION: The various indicators gave results which were at times conflicting, 
especially because the information obtained from the available sources had major 
limitations. The development of indicators needs to aim for greater homogeneity 
between mortality and health data to ensure maximum comparability.

Spontaneous rupture of extensor pollicis longus tendon with tophaceous gout 
infiltration.

Hung JY(1), Wang SJ, Wu SS.

(1)Department of Orthopedics, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense 
Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.

INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous rupture of the extensor pollicis longus (EPL) tendon 
has been reported in the literature. Various mechanisms have been proposed to 
account for this problem, but gouty infiltration is a rare mechanism. Here we 
report a patient with a long-standing history of gout who presented with sudden 
loss of interphalangeal extension of the left thumb. Spontaneous rupture of the 
EPL tendon caused by gout was discovered.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The successful treatment done involved surgical 
exploration and extensor indicis proprius tendon transfer. Postoperative thumb 
spica immobilization for 6 weeks was applied.
RESULTS: Pathology disclosed urate crystals deposited within the ruptured EPL 
tendon. The functional recovery is satisfactory at the 1-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Spontaneous rupture of the EPL tendon caused by gout is rare. 
Successful treatment was done with surgical management. Life-long medical 
follow-up to prevent a repeated acute attack can lower the risk of a large 
amount of tophaceous gout infiltration in tendons and may possibly prevent acute 
spontaneous tendon rupture.

Chronic renal failure (CRF) remains a significant problem. Early referral of 
patients reduces cardiovascular risk and allows better quality of life and life 
expectancy. Uremic patients represent a typical example of chronic disease, 
which requires multidisciplinary team involvement and stratification of 
treatment processes. During the evolution of the disease to chronicity, the 
patient requires different clinical approaches that form part of a unique 
treatment process, involving day-to-day management, carried out by the general 
practitioner, as well as the handling of acute events requiring specialized 
clinical management. Early referral essentially requires three steps. The first 
step is therapeutic education, which includes information, sensitiveness, 
training and acceptance of the disease. The second step is the assembling of a 
multidisciplinary team in which the members are able to work together, 
coordinating and managing treatment protocols. These two steps allow the design 
of the third step, disease management, which consists of a methodology based on 
an integrated approach to the dis-ease allowing continuous improvement in 
medical care, in the patient's quality of life and a better use of economic 
resources.

The burden of coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial disease.

Atherothrombosis is a potentially life-threatening generalised disease process 
that affects the coronary, cerebral and peripheral vasculature, with clinical 
manifestations including myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and peripheral 
arterial disease. Atherothrombosis represents a massive clinical and economic 
burden to healthcare, annually accounting for at least 22% of all deaths 
globally. Moreover, the prevalence of atherothrombotic disease is increasing as 
a result of increased longevity resulting in a larger cohort of older 
individuals. Stroke in particular is a major burden, and is the primary cause of 
adult disability, the second most important cause of dementia, and the third 
leading cause of death in industrialised countries. Atherothrombosis is also 
associated with a poor prognosis, significantly reducing life expectancy in the 
60-year-old patient by 8-12 years depending on the vascular event. Moreover, 
this already shortened life expectancy is further and substantially reduced in 
patients with more than one atherothrombotic event. The economic burden of 
atherothrombosis is significant, particularly given its increasing prevalence, 
with the United States spending over US dollars 300 billion on it. There is thus 
a need for effective intervention to prevent or reduce mortality and morbidity. 
Evidence-based medicine using economics, clinical trials data, outcomes 
research, epidemiology and risk stratification are necessary to target treatment 
effectively to patients at greatest risk, in an attempt to reduce the burden of 
atherothrombotic disease.

Residential radon in Canada: an uncertainty analysis of population and 
individual lung cancer risk.

Population Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. 
kbrand@uottawa.ca

Following a comprehensive evaluation of the health risks of radon, the U.S. 
National Research Council (US-NRC) concluded that the radon inside the homes of 
U.S. residents is an important cause of lung cancer. To assess lung cancer risks 
associated with radon exposure in Canadian homes, we apply the new (US-NRC) 
techniques, tailoring assumptions to the Canadian context. A two-dimensional 
uncertainty analysis is used to provide both population-based (population 
attributable risk, PAR; excess lifetime risk ratio, ELRR; and life-years lost, 
LYL) and individual-based (ELRR and LYL) estimates. Our primary results obtained 
for the Canadian population reveal mean estimates for ELRR, PAR, and LYL are 
0.08, 8%, and 0.10 years, respectively. Results are also available and 
stratified by smoking status (ever versus never). Conveniently, the three 
indices (ELRR, PAR, and LYL) reveal similar output uncertainty (geometric 
standard deviation, GSD approximately 1.3), and in the case of ELRR and LYL, 
comparable variability and uncertainty combined (GSD approximately 4.2). 
Simplifying relationships are identified between ELRR, LYL, PAR, and the 
age-specific excess rate ratio (ERR), which suggest a way to scale results from 
one population to another. This insight is applied in scaling our baseline 
results to obtain gender-specific estimates, as well as in simplifying and 
illuminating sensitivity analysis.

Cost-effectiveness of face-to-face smoking cessation interventions: a dynamic 
modeling study.

Feenstra TL(1), Hamberg-van Reenen HH, Hoogenveen RT, Rutten-van MÃ¶lken MP.

Author information:
(1)National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The 
Netherlands.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of five face-to-face smoking 
cessation interventions (i.e., minimal counseling by a general practitioner (GP) 
with, or without nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), intensive counseling with 
NRT, or bupropion, and telephone counseling) in terms of costs per quitter, 
costs per life-year gained, and costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gained.
METHODS: Scenarios on increased implementation of smoking cessation 
interventions were compared with current practice in The Netherlands. One of the 
five interventions was implemented for a period of 1, 10, or 75 years reaching 
25% of the smokers each year. A dynamic population model, the RIVM chronic 
disease model, was used to project future gains in life-years and QALYs, and 
savings of health-care costs from a decrease in the incidence of 11 
smoking-related diseases over a time horizon of 75 years. This model allows the 
repetitive application of increased cessation rates to a population with a 
changing demographic and risk factor mix. Sensitivity analyses were performed 
for variations in costs, effects, time horizon, program size, and discount 
rates.
RESULTS: Compared with current practice, minimal GP counseling was a dominant 
intervention, generating both gains in life-years and QALYs and savings that 
were higher than intervention costs. For the other interventions, incremental 
costs per QALY gained ranged from about 1100 per thousand for telephone 
counseling to 4900 per thousand for intensive counseling with nicotine patches 
or gum for implementation periods of 75 years.
CONCLUSIONS: All five smoking cessation interventions were cost-effective 
compared with current practice, and minimal GP counseling was even cost-saving.

Korea. hoshin@korea.ac.kr

Home health nursing care (HHNC) in Korea has taken on an important role under 
the mandate of the national health care system since 2000. This program was 
developed to verify the possibility of early discharge of hospitalized patients 
and cost containment through a research and development project that was 
conducted with the government from 1994 to 1999. The process of development of 
HHNC provided an opportunity to realize the advancement and changes in the 
system into a consumer-focused structure. This is an important turning point for 
the Korean health care system that suggests certain possibilities for building a 
foundation for further changes in the service delivery structure. The structure, 
which had been limited to a supplier-oriented model, is moving to a 
consumer-oriented structure. Accordingly, the major function and role of nursing 
policy makers in Korea is to develop an agenda and alternatives for 
policy-making in a systematic manner and to present implementation strategies 
clearly.

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, 
Belgium. yolande.lievens@uz.kuleuven.ac.be

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the financial consequences and the impact 
on daily implementation of CHART in lung cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis were 
performed using Markov models, comparing the early and delayed costs and effects 
of CHART for NSCLC over a 4-year time span from a societal viewpoint. The 
outcome estimates were based on the CHART literature, the cost estimates on the 
standard practice of the Leuven University Hospitals, the radiotherapy costs 
being derived from an activity-based costing (ABC) programme developed in the 
department.
RESULTS: The additional societal cost per life-year gained was 9164 Euro, the 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year 11,576 Euro. Sensitivity 
analyses confirmed the robustness of these results, the incremental cost-utility 
ratio remaining well under 20,000 Euro/QALY in all tested circumstances. The 
threshold analyses found the results of the study to be sensitive to the cost of 
CHART and to the quality of life after treatment. More specifically, standard 
treatment would become the optimal treatment if CHART would have a higher cost 
or would result in more long-term side effects.
CONCLUSION: CHART should not be denied to patients with NSCLC on the basis of 
clinical or economic arguments. Other factors such as socio-economical, 
institutional, practical departmental and physician-bound barriers most probably 
explain the lack of implementation into daily practice.

To determine the role of reactive oxygen species in mammalian longevity, we 
generated transgenic mice that overexpress human catalase localized to the 
peroxisome, the nucleus, or mitochondria (MCAT). Median and maximum life spans 
were maximally increased (averages of 5 months and 5.5 months, respectively) in 
MCAT animals. Cardiac pathology and cataract development were delayed, oxidative 
damage was reduced, H2O2 production and H2O2-induced aconitase inactivation were 
attenuated, and the development of mitochondrial deletions was reduced. These 
results support the free radical theory of aging and reinforce the importance of 
mitochondria as a source of these radicals.

PURPOSE: Multivariate prognostic instruments aim to predict risk of recurrence 
among patients with localized prostate cancer. We devised a novel risk 
assessment tool which would be a strong predictor of outcome across various 
levels of risk, and which could be easily applied and intuitively understood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 1,439 men diagnosed between 1992 and 2001 who 
had undergone radical prostatectomy and were followed in the Cancer of the 
Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) database, a 
longitudinal, community based disease registry of patients with prostate cancer. 
Disease recurrence was defined as prostate specific antigen (PSA) 0.2 ng/ml or 
greater on 2 consecutive occasions following prostatectomy or a second cancer 
treatment more than 6 months after surgery. The University of California, San 
Francisco-Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (UCSF-CAPRA) score was 
developed using preoperative PSA, Gleason score, clinical T stage, biopsy 
results and age. The index was developed and validated using Cox proportional 
hazards and life table analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 210 patients (15%) had recurrence, 145 by PSA criteria and 
65 by second treatment. Based on the results of the Cox analysis, points were 
assigned based on PSA (0 to 4 points), Gleason score (0 to 3), T stage (0 to 1), 
age (0 to 1) and percent of biopsy positive cores (0 to 1). The UCSF-CAPRA score 
range is 0 to 10, with roughly double the risk of recurrence for each 2-point 
increase in score. Recurrence-free survival at 5 years ranged from 85% for a 
UCSF-CAPRA score of 0 to 1 (95% CI 73%-92%) to 8% for a score of 7 to 10 (95% CI 
0%-28%). The concordance index for the UCSF-CAPRA score was 0.66.
CONCLUSIONS: The UCSF-CAPRA score is a straightforward yet powerful preoperative 
risk assessment tool. It must be externally validated in future studies.

renal transplantation: experience from the Assessment of Lescol in Renal 
Transplantation trial.

BACKGROUND: Renal-transplant recipients have shortened life expectancy primarily 
because of premature cardiovascular disease. Traditional and nontraditional risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease are prevalent in renal patients. In 
renal-transplant recipients, immunosuppressive therapy can be nephrotoxic and 
aggravate cardiovascular disease risk factors. Renal dysfunction has been 
established as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality in 
different populations. We evaluated the effects of baseline renal-transplant 
function on mortality and cardiovascular and renal endpoints in 1,052 
placebo-treated patients of the Assessment of Lescol in Renal Transplantation 
trial.
METHODS: All renal-transplant recipients were on cyclosporine-based 
immunosuppressive therapy. Follow-up was 5 to 6 years, and endpoints included 
cardiac death, noncardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, major adverse 
cardiac event (MACE), stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and graft loss.
RESULTS: Baseline serum creatinine was strongly and independently associated 
with increased cardiac, noncardiovascular, and all-cause mortality, as well as 
MACE and graft loss. Serum creatinine was not a risk factor for stroke or 
nonfatal myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated baseline serum creatinine in renal-transplant recipients 
is a strong and independent risk factor for all-cause, noncardiovascular and 
cardiac mortality, MACE, and graft loss.

[Lifespan of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension].

[Article in Russian]

Chazova IE, Mironova NA.

AIM: To design a mathematical express model of expected lifespan of patients 
with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 418 case histories of 132 PPH 
patients (81 females, 51 males, age 16-57 years). Ninety one of them were 
hospitalized at least twice. The following characteristics of the patients were 
registered: a PPH form, age at onset, gender, morphological structure of the 
lung, date of the first visit to doctor. Relationship of these factors with 
lifespan was analysed and the express formula of expected lifespan was 
calculated using the multifactorial analysis of variance with standard computer 
statistical programs.
RESULTS: Lifespan was studied for dependence on static factors free of therapy 
effects (gender, age, form of PPH). The presence of a factor named "duration of 
the disease development" (DDD) is suggested. A correlation was found between DDD 
and lifespan in PPH patients explaining survival by 84.5%. The formula of the 
prognosis was derived for patients with known morphological structure of the 
lung in whom the above dependence explains survival by 93.5%.
CONCLUSION: Among effect modifiers, of significance for survival are age, PPH 
form, morphological structure of the lung. An artificial index DDD was used for 
deriving a formula for prognosis of survival for a newly hospitalized PPH 
patient.

Assessing the cost-effectiveness of COX-2 specific inhibitors for arthritis in 
the Veterans Health Administration.

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
cyclooxygenase-2 specific (COX-2) inhibitors (rofecoxib and celecoxib) over 
nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in high-risk 
arthritis patients from the perspective of the Veterans Health Administration 
(VA).
METHODS: This literature-based economic analysis (with data summarized from 
MEDLINE-indexed and other published sources, FDA reports, and data on file at VA 
San Diego Healthcare System) compared rofecoxib and celecoxib to NSAIDS in two 
arthritis patient populations considered at higher risk of developing clinically 
significant upper gastrointestinal events (CSUGIEs): (1) patients of any age 
with previous medical history of perforation/ulcer/bleed (PUB); and (2) patients 
65 years and older (regardless of history of PUB). Two outcome measures were 
reported: (1) incremental cost per CSUGIE averted over 1 year; and (2) 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, considering both 
the mortality and morbidity associated with gastrointestinal (including CSUGIEs) 
and cardiovascular-related adverse events. When possible, costs were modeled to 
reflect the VA perspective. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the 
robustness of the analysis.
RESULTS: Compared to NSAIDS, rofecoxib and celecoxib increased costs but reduced 
the incidence of CSUGIE. Cost per CSUGIE avoided were $7476 and $16,379 (in 
patients with a PUB history) and $14,294 and $18,376 (in patients aged > or = 65 
years) for celecoxib and rofecoxib, respectively. In both populations, celecoxib 
was associated with a cost per QALY less than $50,000. In contrast, rofecoxib 
was found to cost more and result in a net QALY loss, due in particular to the 
increase in the risk of cardiovascular complications, and was therefore 
considered cost-ineffective. Results were most dependent on assumptions about 
the incidence of cardiovascular events and CSUGIE and the COX-2 inhibitors' 
acquisition price.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that COX-2 inhibitors may be cost-effective 
from the perspective of the VA. However, cost-effectiveness appears to depend 
less on the specific characteristics of the high-risk target population 
considered but more on the agent evaluated. Celecoxib appears to be an 
alternative to traditional NSAIDs in the patient populations studied.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long term cost effectiveness of clopidogrel monotherapy 
compared with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin; ASA) monotherapy in patients at 
risk of secondary occlusive vascular events (OVEs) in the UK.
DESIGN: Cost utility analysis based on clinical data from CAPRIE (a multicentre 
randomised controlled trial, involving 19185 patients); long-term effects were 
extrapolated beyond the trial period using a Markov model populated with data 
from UK observational studies. Health economic evaluation carried out from the 
perspective of the UK National Health Service.
PARTICIPANTS: A representative cohort of 1000 UK patients aged 60 years 
(approximate mean age of the CAPRIE population), with the qualifying diagnoses 
of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and peripheral arterial disease, who 
are at risk of secondary OVEs (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke 
or vascular death).
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assumed to receive treatment with either 
clopidogrel (75 mg/day) for 2 years followed by ASA (325 mg/day, average) for 
their remaining lifetime, or ASA alone (325 mg/day, average) for life.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per life year gained and incremental 
cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental cost effectiveness of clopidogrel 
versus ASA in this population is estimated at 18888 pounds per life year gained 
and 21 489 pounds per QALY gained. Multiple deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses suggest the model is robust to variations in a wide range 
of input parameters.
CONCLUSION: Two years of treatment with clopidogrel can be considered a cost 
effective intervention in patients at risk of secondary OVEs in the UK.

BACKGROUND: Hypertension is frequently associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 
(NF1), a common inherited disease that limits life expectancy. No data are 
available on cardiac damage in NF1 patients with hypertension. We evaluated 
cardiac function in NF1 patients with hypertension diagnosed by 24-h ambulatory 
blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), compared with normal children.
METHODS: We studied 73 NF1 patients (41 boys; mean age 12 years) and 30 normal 
children comparable for age and sex, using standard 2D echocardiography, 
standard Doppler and Doppler tissue imaging (DTI). Twelve patients (16%) showed 
24-h systolic blood pressure (SBP) or 24-h diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >95th 
percentile for age and sex. We divided the NF1 group into two subgroups: group 
A, patients with 24-h SBP and DBP </=95th percentile for age and sex, and group 
B, patients with 24-h SBP or DBP >95th percentile for age and sex.
RESULTS: Group B presented a thicker end-diastolic interventricular septum 
(p<0.0001), posterior wall (p=0.02), LVMI (p<0.001) and relative wall thickness 
(p<0.03) than group A and controls. Left atrial dimension in group B was also 
significantly larger. Examination by standard Doppler showed a deceleration and 
isovolumic relaxation time significantly prolonged in group B. DTI parameters 
were significantly higher in NF1 patients than controls. In group B, myocardial 
early diastolic (E(m)) and systolic (S(m)) velocities were significantly lower 
than group A. Myocardial early/late diastolic ratio (E(m)/A(m)) in NF1 patients 
was lower than controls and 19% of group A and 20% of group B showed an 
E(m)/A(m) ratio <1. No healthy subjects presented an E(m)/A(m) ratio <1.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated early cardiac morphologic and functional changes in 
young NF1 patients with hypertension. Because DTI directly studies cardiac 
muscle, it can detect changes induced by hypertension as well as those 
independent of blood pressure.

An epidemic of fear and distrust has infected women (and physicians) after 
publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). The overinflated negative 
data emerging from the oestroprogestinic arm of WHI have frightened women and 
gave rise to the most difficult emotions to cope with. Keywords such as cancer, 
death and hormones combined together, have potentiated an avoidant attitude 
towards hormonal therapy (HT) driven more emotionally than rationally. This 
negative aura has not been dissipated by the positive data from the 
oestrogen-only arm of WHI. This paper will discuss: women's different emotional 
reactions to and coping strategies for HT-related fear after WHI; the 
communication skills physicians should use in focusing on positive messages 
emerging from WHI; predictors of current HT use; the meaning of the higher use 
of HT in postmenopausal highly-educated women and women gynaecologists; the 
importance of increasing healthy life-styles as a taking of responsibility 
towards aging by every woman; shifting from passivity to active sharing of the 
decision making process with the caring physician; and the use of an 
individually tailored HT, when appropriate, as part of an active strategy in the 
pursuit of a longer health expectancy.

Author information:
(1)Department of Epidemiology, University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of 
Public Health, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-2593, USA. gangulim@upmc.edu

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is considered a leading cause of death, but 
few studies have examined the contribution of AD to mortality based on follow-up 
of representative US cohorts.
OBJECTIVE: To examine mortality rates, duration of survival, causes of death, 
and the contribution of AD to the risk of mortality in an aging community-based 
cohort, controlling for other predictors.
DESIGN: Fifteen-year prospective epidemiological study. Mortality rates per 1000 
person-years and the population-attributable risk of mortality were determined. 
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative risk of mortality 
due to AD, adjusting for relevant covariates. Death certificates were abstracted 
for listed causes of death.
SETTING: A largely blue-collar rural community in southwestern Pennsylvania.
PARTICIPANTS: A community-based cohort of 1670 adults 65 years and older at 
study enrollment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mortality.
RESULTS: In the overall cohort, AD was a significant predictor of mortality, 
with a hazard ratio of 1.4 after adjusting for covariates. The 
population-attributable risk of mortality from AD was 4.9% based on the same 
model. Examining the sexes separately, AD increased mortality risk only among 
women. Death certificates of AD subjects were more likely to list dementia/AD, 
other brain disorders, pneumonia, and dehydration, and less likely to include 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer disease was responsible for 4.9% of the deaths in this 
elderly cohort. Alzheimer disease increased the risk of mortality 40% in the 
cohort as a whole and separately in women but not in men. The mean (SD) duration 
of survival with AD was 5.9 (3.7) years, and longer with earlier age at onset.

Micronutrient requirements in older women.

Chernoff R(1).

Author information:

Healthcare System, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA. chernoffronni@uams.edu

The nutritional requirements of older women is an area of great interest because 
the extended life expectancy leads to an increase in women living into their 
80s, 90s, and longer. The recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) and dietary 
reference intakes (DRIs) are not specific for women living to advanced ages, and 
little research has been conducted specifically on the micronutrient needs of 
elderly women. Older adults are at greater risk for nutritional deficiencies 
than are younger adults due to physiologic changes associated with aging, acute 
and chronic illnesses, prescription and over-the-counter medications, financial 
and social status, and functional decline. Among the significant age-associated 
changes in nutrient requirements, the need for energy decreases and the 
requirements for protein increase with age. Among the micronutrients, the 
significant ones that may be associated with deficiencies in elderly women 
include vitamin B-12, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, calcium, iron, zinc, and 
other trace minerals. In old and very old women, these are micronutrients of 
interest but there is a great need for research to determine appropriate 
recommendations. The importance of these selected nutrients and the reasons for 
the likelihood of deficiency are discussed briefly. However, there is little 
specific information regarding micronutrient requirements for elderly women. One 
reason for this is the difficulty in conducting reliable and valid studies due 
to the heterogeneity of older adults and their unique rate of aging associated 
with their health status, limited income, disability, and living situation.
