the Spanish one. However, health care professionals are self-employed, and there 
are co-payments. In spite of co-payments, Italians have one of the highest 
average life expectancy, and they support a universal and publicly funded 
health-care system.

We have long accepted that exercise is 'good for us'; that - put more rigorously 
- moderate exercise is associated with not just aerobic fitness but also reduced 
morbidity and reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease and even 
malignancies. Caloric restriction (moderate hunger) and our exposure to dietary 
phytochemicals are also emerging as stresses which are 'good for us' in the same 
sense. This review focuses on an important extension of this concept: that 
stress localized within the body (e.g. in a limb) can induce resilience in 
tissues throughout the body. We describe evidence for the efficacy of two 
'remote' protective interventions - remote ischemic conditioning and remote 
photobiomodulation - and discuss the mechanisms underlying their protective 
actions. While the biological phenomenon of remote tissue conditioning is only 
partially understood, it holds promise for protecting critical-to-life tissues 
while mitigating risks and practical barriers to direct conditioning of these 
tissues.

Dry eye disease (DED) is a common disease that can impair quality of life 
significantly. Its prevalence increases with advancing age, and the economic 
burden of the disease on both a patient and the society is increasing with 
elongation of life expectancy. The diagnosis and treatment of DED are often 
difficult due to the discordance between symptoms and signs of the disease. 
Recent studies have suggested the role of neurological or psychological factors 
in the development of dry eye symptoms and discrepancy of the symptoms and 
signs, particularly in elderly patients. In this review, the authors discuss the 
association of DED with various psychiatric and neurological disorders. In 
addition to psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, stress, 
posttraumatic stress disorder and sleep disorders, medications for the 
psychiatric disorders have association with DED. Neurological disorders, such as 
neuropathic pain, chronic pain syndrome, peripheral neuropathy and several 
central nervous system disorders, are related to DED. Treatment of DED, combined 
with psychiatric or neurological disorders, is also discussed. Attention should 
be paid to the DED patients with discordant symptoms and signs, and 
unsatisfactory response to conventional treatment for associated psychiatric or 
neurological disorders, as well as an integrated treatment approach, could be 
helpful for these patients.

The Japanese have the highest life expectancy in the world while the United 
States (U.S.) has relatively low life expectancy. Furthermore, the Americans 
have relatively poorer health compared to the Japanese. Examination of the 
treatment of specific conditions such as hypertension in these two countries may 
provide insights into how the health care system contributes to the relative 
health in these two countries. In this study, we focus on the treatment of 
hypertension, as this is the most common condition requiring therapeutic 
interventions in seniors. This study examines hypertension diagnoses and 
controls in nationally representative samples of the older populations (68 
years-or-older) of Japan and the U.S. Data come from two nationally 
representative samples: the Nihon University Japanese Longitudinal Study of 
Aging (NUJLSOA) (n=2,309) and the U.S. Health and Retirement (HRS) Study 
(n=3,517). The overall prevalence of hypertension is higher in Japan than the 
U.S. Undiagnosed hypertension is about four times higher in Japan than in the 
U.S., while the control of blood pressure is more than four times higher in the 
U.S. than in Japan. Thus, the use of antihypertensive medication is much more 
frequent and more effective in the U.S. The medical care system seems to be more 
effective in controlling hypertension in the U.S. than in Japan. This may be due 
to the more aggressive diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in the U.S.

BACKGROUND: The RACAT (Rheumatoid Arthritis Comparison of Active Therapies) 
trial found triple therapy to be noninferior to etanercept-methotrexate in 
patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of etanercept-methotrexate versus 
triple therapy as a first-line strategy.
DESIGN: A within-trial analysis based on the 353 participants in the RACAT trial 
and a lifetime analysis that extrapolated costs and outcomes by using a decision 
analytic cohort model.
DATA SOURCES: The RACAT trial and sources from the literature.
TARGET POPULATION: Patients with active RA despite at least 12 weeks of 
methotrexate therapy.
TIME HORIZON: 24 weeks and lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal and Medicare.
INTERVENTION: Etanercept-methotrexate first versus triple therapy first.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The within-trial analysis found that 
etanercept-methotrexate as first-line therapy provided marginally more QALYs but 
accumulated substantially higher drug costs. Differences in other costs between 
strategies were negligible. The ICERs for first-line etanercept-methotrexate and 
triple therapy were $2.7 million per QALY and $0.98 million per QALY over 24 and 
48 weeks, respectively. The lifetime analysis suggested that first-line 
etanercept-methotrexate would result in 0.15 additional lifetime QALY, but this 
gain would cost an incremental $77 290, leading to an ICER of $521 520 per QALY 
per patient.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Considering a long-term perspective, an initial 
strategy of etanercept-methotrexate and biologics with similar cost and efficacy 
is unlikely to be cost-effective compared with using triple therapy first, even 
under optimistic assumptions.
LIMITATION: Data on the long-term benefit of triple therapy are uncertain.
CONCLUSION: Initiating biologic therapy without trying triple therapy first 
increases costs while providing minimal incremental benefit.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by progressive cognitive impairments and chronic inflammation that 
affects over 30 million people all over the world. Most of the Alzheimer's 
patients also suffer from psychosis, aggression, agitation, depression, anxiety, 
and many other behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Unfortunately, 
the currently available anti-AD drugs provide modest symptomatic relief, and 
they do not reverse the neurodegeneration. Therefore, the average life 
expectancy after diagnosis is between six and ten years. Research data suggest 
that multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) give an opportunity to prevent, halt, 
or reverse the progression of AD, and reduce the symptoms of the disease. The 
aim of this review is to update the most recent reports on the development of 
MTDLs affecting serotonergic neurotransmission as potential drugs for both 
symptomatic and disease-modifying therapy of AD. Multifunctional modulators of 
serotonergic system exerted procognitive, antipsychotic, antidepressant, and/or 
anxiolytic properties in preclinical studies. Some of them revealed their 
potential as modulators of tau phosphorylation or amyloid beta aggregation with 
neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and/or antioxidant properties. Among them, 
lumateperone - an inhibitor of serotonin transporter with a high affinity for 
serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors is currently being tested in clinical 
trials in patients with dementia, bipolar depression, or schizophrenia. The high 
therapeutic potential of MTDLs as anti-AD drugs seems to be the result of their 
involvement in multiple neurotransmitter systems and intracellular signaling 
pathways.

HEADROOM BEYOND THE QUALITY- ADJUSTED LIFE-YEAR: THE CASE OF COMPLEX PEDIATRIC 
NEUROLOGY.

OBJECTIVES: The headroom method was introduced for the very early evaluation of 
the potential value of new technologies. It allows for establishing a ceiling 
price for technologies to still be cost-effective by combining the maximum 
effect a technology might yield, the maximum willingness-to-pay (WTP) for this 
effect, and potential downstream expenses and savings. Although the headroom 
method is QALY-based, not all innovations are expected to result in QALY gain.
METHODS: This study explores the feasibility and usefulness of the headroom 
method in the evaluation of technologies that are unlikely to result in QALY 
gain. This will be illustrated with the diagnostic trajectory of complex 
pediatric neurology (CPN).
RESULTS: Our headroom analysis showed a large room for improvement in the 
current diagnostic trajectory of CPN in terms of diagnostic yield. Combining 
this with a maximum WTP value for an additional diagnosis and the potential 
downstream expenses and savings, resulted in a total headroom of €15,028. This 
indicates that a new technology in this particular diagnostic trajectory, might 
be cost-effective as long as its costs do not exceed €15,028.
CONCLUSIONS: The headroom method seems a useful tool in the very early 
evaluation of medical technologies, also in cases when immediate QALY gain is 
unlikely. It allows for allocating healthcare resources to those technologies 
that are most promising. It should be kept in mind, however, that the headroom 
assumes an optimistic scenario, and for that reason cannot guarantee future 
cost-effectiveness. It might be most useful for ruling out those technologies 
that are unlikely to be cost-effective.

Terminal sialic acids on N-glycan of recombinant human erythropoietin are very 
important for in vivo half-life, as this glycoprotein has three N-glycosylation 
sites. N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases I, II, IV, and V (i.e. Mgat1, Mgat2, 
Mgat4, and Mgat5) catalyze the formation of a glycan antennary structure. These 
enzymes display different reaction kinetics for a common substrate and generally 
show low expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Therefore, genetic 
control of Mgat expression is an effective method to increase sialic acid 
contents by enhancing glycan antennarity. To produce highly sialylated 
albumin-erythropoietin (Alb-EPO), we co-overexpressed the Mgat1 and Mgat4 genes 
in CHO cells and determined the optimal ratio of Mgat1:Mgat4 gene expression. 
All transfected cell lines showed increased gene expression of Mgat4, including 
Mgat1 overexpressing cell line. Sialic acid content of Alb-EPO was highest in 
co-transfected cells with excess Mgat4 gene, and these cells showed a higher 
tri- and tetra-antennary structure than control cells. Based on these results, 
we suggest that co-transfection of the Mgat1 and Mgat4 genes at a ratio of 2:8 
is optimal for extension of antennary structures. Also, regulation of Mgat gene 
expression in the glycan biosynthesis pathway can be a novel approach to 
increase the terminal sialic acids of N-glycans.

Therapeutic Use of Filgrastim for Established Febrile Neutropenia Is Cost 
Effective Among Patients With Solid Tumors and Lymphomas.

PURPOSE: With the emergence of biosimilar filgrastim to the market, there is a 
gradual decrease in the listed price of the originator product of filgrastim 
over the years, and this could have an impact on the cost-effectiveness of 
filgrastim in the treatment of febrile neutropenia (FN). A cost-effectiveness 
analysis would allow clinicians to make informed decision when considering the 
therapeutic filgrastim among low-risk FN patients. This study aims to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of adding therapeutic filgrastim to antibiotics in the 
treatment of established FN among patients with solid tumors and lymphomas.
METHODS: A decision tree model was created to compare two treatment options for 
established FN as follows: (1) antibiotics alone (standard care) and (2) 
antibiotics with therapeutic filgrastim (comparator). The target population was 
a hypothetical cohort of adult cancer patients with solid tumors or lymphomas 
hospitalized with FN in Singapore. The analysis was performed from a hospital's 
perspective over a 21-day time horizon. The main outcome measures included 
costs, quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER). One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results.
FINDINGS: Compared with antibiotics alone, the treatment strategy of antibiotics 
with therapeutic filgrastim was a dominant choice, incurring a cost saving of 
US$125 per patient (comparator versus standard care: US$9110 versus US$9235) and 
additional health benefit of 0.0007 QALY gained per patient (comparator versus 
standard care: 0.0450 versus 0.0443). Model results were robust against the 
parameter variations in the one-way sensitivity analyses, but increasing the 
cost of filgrastim beyond US$87 per injection would increase the ICER to 
>US$50,000/QALY. Furthermore, the strategy of antibiotics with therapeutic 
filgrastim was the preferred choice (dominant or cost-effective) in 83.7% of the 
model iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$50,000/QALY.
IMPLICATIONS: From a hospital's perspective, the therapeutic filgrastim, in 
conjunction with antibiotics, in the treatment of FN is cost effective. This 
provides evidence to support the routine use of filgrastim for the treatment of 
FN among adult cancer patients with solid tumors and lymphomas.

Once considered a pediatric disease with a poor prognosis, individuals born with 
cystic fibrosis (CF) today can expect to live well into adulthood. The 
implementation of multidisciplinary care, novel treatments and newborn screening 
has resulted in the rapid evolution in the demographics of the CF population. 
The purpose of this review is to highlight the evolving epidemiology and 
demographics of the CF population internationally.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic autosomal recessive disorder affecting 
around 75,000 individuals worldwide. It is a multi-system disease but the main 
morbidity and mortality is caused by chronic lung disease. Due to newborn 
screening, a multidisciplinary approach to care and intensive symptomatic 
treatment, the prognosis has dramatically improved over the last decades and 
there are currently more adults than children in many countries. However, CF is 
still a very severe disease with a current median age of life expectancy in the 
fourth decade of life. The disease is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene which encodes the CFTR protein, 
a protein kinase A-activated ATP-gated anion channel that regulates the 
transport of electrolytes such as chloride and bicarbonate. More than 2000 
mutations have been reported, although not all of these have functional 
consequences. An enormous research effort and progress has been made in 
understanding the consequences of these mutations on the CFTR protein structure 
and function, and this has led to the approval of two new drug therapies that 
are able to bind to defective CFTR proteins and partially restore their 
function. They are mutation-specific therapies and available at present for 
specific mutations only. They are the first personalized medicine for CF with a 
possible disease-modifying effect. A pipeline of other compounds is under 
development with different mechanisms of action. It is foreseeable that new 
combinations of compounds will further improve the correction of CFTR function. 
Other strategies including premature stop codon read-through drugs, antisense 
oligonucleotides that correct the basic defect at the mRNA level or gene editing 
to restore the defective gene as well as gene therapy approaches are all in the 
pipeline. All these strategies are needed to develop disease-modifying therapies 
for all patients with CF.

OBJECTIVES: EGFR and KRAS genes are routinely tested in lung carcinomas with 
therapeutic implications. However the current testing methods require complex 
infrastructures and the delay for diagnosis remains often rather long, 
especially for initiating an appropriate treatment in patients with advanced 
stage tumor and short life expectancy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated the Idylla™ fully automated molecular 
diagnostic system in routine conditions in 79 lung adenocarcinomas and 14 other 
non-small cell lung carcinomas, mostly in advanced stages (III or IV: 85%). 
Tests were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (n=83) or fresh (n=10) 
material, including cytological (n=24) and small biopsy (n=20) samples. In 
prospective cases (n=82), the most likely mutated gene (EGFR in non or 
occasional smokers and KRAS in smokers) was tested first; the second gene being 
only tested in case of negativity.
RESULTS: The system did not require complex training. Mutational status was 
obtained in few hours after making the histological diagnosis and on the day of 
the patient's sampling by analyzing fresh material. The sequential testing 
strategy avoided 15 EGFR and 15 KRAS tests that would have been negative. 
Compared with reference methods, global specificity and sensitivity were both 
100% for EGFR mutations, and 89.1% and 91.7% for KRAS mutations, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that such easy-to-use systems can permit 
pathologists to integrate a reliable EGFR/KRAS status in their initial 
pathologic report, and could be useful complementary tools to the current 
molecular diagnostic methods, with regard to prompt therapeutic management of 
lung cancer patients.

Widespread prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing notably increased the number 
of prostate cancer (PCa) diagnoses. However, about 30% of these patients have 
low-risk tumors that are not lethal and remain asymptomatic during their 
lifetime. Overtreatment of such patients may reduce quality of life and increase 
healthcare costs. Active surveillance (AS) has become an accepted alternative to 
immediate treatment in selected men with low-risk PCa. Despite much progress in 
recent years toward identifying the best candidates for AS in recent years, the 
greatest risk remains the possibility of misclassification of the cancer or 
missing a high-risk cancer. This is particularly worrisome in men with a life 
expectancy of greater than 10-15 years. The Prostate Cancer Research 
International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) study showed that, in addition to age 
and PSA at diagnosis, both PSA density (PSA-D) and the number of positive cores 
at diagnosis (two compared with one) are the strongest predictors for 
reclassification biopsy or switching to deferred treatment. However, there is 
still no consensus upon guidelines for placing patients on AS. Each institution 
has its own protocol for AS that is based on PRIAS criteria. Many different 
variables have been proposed as tools to enrol patients in AS: PSA-D, the 
percentage of freePSA, and the extent of cancer on biopsy (number of positive 
cores or percentage of core involvement). More recently, the Prostate Health 
Index (PHI), the 4 Kallikrein (4K) score, and other patient factors, such as 
age, race, and family history, have been investigated as tools able to predict 
clinically significant PCa. Recently, some reports suggested that epigenetic 
mapping differs significantly between cancer patients and healthy subjects. 
These findings indicated as future prospect the use of epigenetic markers to 
identify PCa patients with low-grade disease, who are likely candidates for AS. 
This review explores literature data about the potential of epigenetic markers 
as predictors of clinically significant disease.

The long blood circulation time of albumin has been clinically utilized as a 
half-life extension technology for improved drug performance. The availability 
of one free thiol for site-selective chemical conjugation offers an alternative 
approach to current genetic fusion and association-based products. This special 
report highlights important factors for successful conjugation that allows the 
reader to design and evaluate next-generation albumin conjugates. Albumin type, 
available conjugation chemistries, linker length, animal models and influence of 
conjugation on albumin pharmacokinetics and drug activity are discussed.

This document updates the colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations of 
the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force of Colorectal Cancer (MSTF), which represents 
the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological 
Association, and The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. CRC 
screening tests are ranked in 3 tiers based on performance features, costs, and 
practical considerations. The first-tier tests are colonoscopy every 10 years 
and annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended 
as the cornerstones of screening regardless of how screening is offered. Thus, 
in a sequential approach based on colonoscopy offered first, FIT should be 
offered to patients who decline colonoscopy. Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended 
as tests of choice when multiple options are presented as alternatives. A 
risk-stratified approach is also appropriate, with FIT screening in populations 
with an estimated low prevalence of advanced neoplasia and colonoscopy screening 
in high prevalence populations. The second-tier tests include CT colonography 
every 5 years, the FIT-fecal DNA test every 3 years, and flexible sigmoidoscopy 
every 5 to 10 years. These tests are appropriate screening tests, but each has 
disadvantages relative to the tier 1 tests. Because of limited evidence and 
current obstacles to use, capsule colonoscopy every 5 years is a third-tier 
test. We suggest that the Septin9 serum assay (Epigenomics, Seattle, Wash) not 
be used for screening. Screening should begin at age 50 years in average-risk 
persons, except in African Americans in whom limited evidence supports screening 
at 45 years. CRC incidence is rising in persons under age 50, and thorough 
diagnostic evaluation of young persons with suspected colorectal bleeding is 
recommended. Discontinuation of screening should be considered when persons up 
to date with screening, who have prior negative screening (particularly 
colonoscopy), reach age 75 or have <10 years of life expectancy. Persons without 
prior screening should be considered for screening up to age 85, depending on 
age and comorbidities. Persons with a family history of CRC or a documented 
advanced adenoma in a first-degree relative age <60 years or 2 first-degree 
relatives with these findings at any age are recommended to undergo screening by 
colonoscopy every 5 years, beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the 
youngest affected relative or age 40, whichever is earlier. Persons with a 
single first-degree relative diagnosed at ≥60 years with CRC or an advanced 
adenoma can be offered average-risk screening options beginning at age 40 years.

A health economic analysis was undertaken based on the 1-year database from a 
randomized study of rabbit anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin (rATG) versus 
basiliximab, in kidney transplantation using resource utilization data and cost 
estimates from three German hospitals. A three-state Markov model was applied to 
estimate cost-effectiveness to 10 years post-transplant. Total mean treatment 
cost per patient to year 1 post-transplant was €62 075 vs. €59 767 for rATG 
versus basiliximab (P < 0.01). rATG therapy was associated with similar 
treatment costs to basiliximab by year 2, and a predicted cumulative treatment 
cost saving of €4 259 under rATG versus basiliximab by year 10 post-transplant. 
The mean number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient by year 1 was 
0.809 vs. 0.802 in the rATG and basiliximab cohorts, respectively (P = 0.38), 
with cumulative QALYs of 6.161 and 6.065 per patient by year 10. By year 2, the 
cumulative cost per QALY was slightly lower under rATG (€35 378) than 
basiliximab (€35 885), progressing to a saving of €1 041 under rATG for the 
cumulative cost per QALY by year 10. In conclusion, this model indicates that 
rATG induction provides a modest increase in QALYs with lower long-term costs 
than basiliximab in deceased-donor high-risk kidney transplant patients.

Restoring Maximum Vertical Browsing Reach in Sauropod Dinosaurs.

Paul GS(1).

Author information:
(1)3109 N. Calvert St. Side, Baltimore, Maryland.

The ongoing controversy centered on neck posture and function in sauropod 
dinosaurs is misplaced for a number of reasons. Because of an absence of 
pertinent data it is not possible to accurately restore the posture and range of 
motion in long necked fossil animals, only gross approximations are possible. 
The existence of a single "neutral posture" in animals with long, slender necks 
may not exist, and its relationship to feeding habits is weak. Restorations of 
neutral osteological neck posture based on seemingly detailed diagrams of 
cervical articulations are not reliable because the pictures are not 
sufficiently accurate due to a combination of illustration errors, and 
distortion of the fossil cervicals. This is all the more true because fossil 
cervical series lack the critical inter-centra cartilage. Maximum vertical reach 
is more readily restorable and biologically informative for long necked 
herbivores. Modest extension of 10° between each caudal cervical allowed high 
shouldered sauropods to raise the cranial portion of their necks to vertical 
postures that allowed them to reach floral resources far higher than seen in the 
tallest mammals. This hypothesis is supported by the dorsally extended 
articulation of the only known co-fused sauropod cervicals. Many sauropods 
appear to have been well adapted for rearing in order to boost vertical reach, 
some possessed retroverted pelves that may have allowed them to walk slowly 
while bipedal. A combination of improved high browsing abilities and sexual 
selection probably explains the unusually long necks of tall ungulates and super 
tall sauropods. Anat Rec, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Anat Rec,

Despite the worldwide high prevalence of total joint arthroplasty (TJA), life 
expectancy of prosthesis remains limited by mechanical and chemical constraint 
which promote wear debris production, surrounding tissues damage and finally 
prosthesis loosening. Such results could be amplified by 
neuro-myoelectrostimulation (NMES; widely used to reduce neuromuscular deficits 
observed following TJA surgery). It was previously described in an in vivo 
experiment that interactions between NMES and Ti6Al4V implant are deleterious 
for both implant and surrounding muscles. The purpose of the present study was 
to compare the biocompatibility of four common orthopedic biomaterials, two 
metallic (Ti6Al4V, CrCo) and two nonmetallic (PEEK, Al2 O3 ) alloys, fixed on 
rat tibial crest in which the surrounding muscles were electrostimulated. Muscle 
cell death rate was not found significantly increased, with or without 
electrical stimulation for nonmetallic implants. Contrary to Ti6Al4V alloy, the 
CrCo implant did not induce destruction of the surrounding muscle. However, cell 
viability decreased for both metallic alloys when NMES was applied but within a 
greater significant extent for Ti6Al4V implant. Otherwise, when NMES was 
applied, implant-to-bone adhesion significantly decreased for Ti6Al4V while no 
significant difference was found for PEEK, Al2 O3 , and CrCo. Statistical 
analyses reveal also a lesser adhesion strength for Ti6Al4V compared with CrCo 
when NMES was applied. Selecting the most suitable material in term of 
biocompatibility remains a major concern and non-metallic materials seems to be 
more appropriated in regard to electrical currents used for post TJA care. ©

The scale and the signs of population aging in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), 
having expressed gender differences, have been defined. In the course of the 
analysis it have been revealed that the decline in mortality and life expectancy 
growth, migratory outflow of young population, reducing the number of children 
led to an increase in the number of older persons. It was found that the 
increase and redistribution of the dependency rate on the working population in 
the direction of older people acts as a consequence of the aging process. The 
survey of the employment behaviour of the elderly population of the Republic 
showed that the main activity motives of elderly are instrumental and social.

снижение смертности и рост продолжительности жизни, миграционный отток молодого 
населения, уменьшение числа детей вызывают рост численности лиц пожилого 
возраста. Показано, что последствием процесса старения выступают повышение и 
перераспределение демографической нагрузки на трудоспособное население в сторону 
пожилых людей. Результаты обследования трудового поведения пожилого населения 
республики показали, что основными мотивами трудовой активности пожилых являются 
инструментальный и социальный.

In order to improve outcomes, identification of the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genes has become crucial in 
advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of the present study is to 
analyse time trends and frequency of testing, factors affecting testing as well 
as prevalence of mutations in the Swiss population. We analysed EGFR and ALK 
testing in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed metastasised non-squamous 
NSCLC in the catchment area of the cancer registry Eastern Switzerland in the 
years 2008-2014. We analysed prevalence of mutations and studied 
clinicopathological characteristics and survival of tested and non-tested 
patients and of patients with and without mutations. Among 718 patients 
identified, 11% (51/447) harboured an EGFR mutation in the exons 18, 19 or 21 
and further 12% (31/265) showed a positive test result for ALK rearrangements. 
In non-smokers the proportions of mutations were 31% and 23% respectively. 
Testing rates increased over time and reached 79% in 2014. We observed 
significantly lower testing rates and poorer survival in elderly, patients with 
limited life expectancy and patients treated at hospitals not involved in 
clinical research. Outcomes can be further improved in a considerable proportion 
of patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC.

Physical characteristics, muscle strength, and predicted aerobic power were 
compared in two circumpolar populations aged 20-49 years at different stages in 
acculturation to a "modern" sedentary life-style: the Inuit of Igloolik (110 
males, 80 females tested in 1989-90) and the nGanasan of Volochanka (29 males, 
25 females tested in 1992-3). Both populations show short stature but normal 
body mass. Skinfold thicknesses (average of triceps, subscapular, and 
suprailiac) of the male Inuit (mean 10-11 mm, rising with age to 15 mm) are now 
much greater than in previous surveys, reflecting adoption of a mechanized, 
sedentary life-style. Recent estimates from Siberia suggest continuing 
substantial daily energy expenditures by the men but not the women of this 
region, and averaged values for the three skinfolds in the nGanasan males (mean 
7-8 mm) are still low. In women, both Inuit (mean skinfolds 15 mm, rising to 29 
mm with age) and nGanasan (mean 19 mm, rising to 25 mm) are now relatively 
obese. Compared to the nGanasan, male Inuit have greater handgrip force 
(probably due to snowmobile operation), but poorer knee extension strength 
(probably because they now do little walking through snow). In contrast, older 
nGanasan women have less knee extension strength than the Inuit (probably 
because the latter still carry babies on their backs). The aerobic power of both 
Inuit and nGanasan (mean of 48, declining with age to 38-40ml/[kg.min] in males, 
mean of 38-45 declining with age to 33-37 ml/[kg.min] in females) still 
corresponds to that of a moderately active urban population. © 1995 Wiley-Liss,

Hospital, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Venous thromboembolism is the formation of a blood clot in the vein. It mainly 
consists of 2 life-threatening conditions-deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary 
embolism. Deep venous thrombosis is a potentially dangerous condition with grave 
sequelae, the worst of which is pulmonary embolism. Venous thromboembolism can 
also lead to multiple other conditions with significant morbidity and mortality 
that include extension of thrombi, pulmonary hypertension, recurrence, and 
postthrombotic syndrome. An update on the epidemiology, etiology, and 
pathogenesis of venous thromboembolism will be reviewed in this article.

Structural dissimilarity sampling (SDS) has been proposed as an enhanced 
conformational sampling method for reproducing the structural transitions of a 
given protein. SDS consists of cycles of two steps: (1) Selections of initial 
structures with structural dissimilarities by referring to a measure. (2) 
Conformational resampling by restarting short-time molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations from the initial structures. In the present study, an efficient 
measure is proposed as a dynamically self-guiding selection to accelerate the
