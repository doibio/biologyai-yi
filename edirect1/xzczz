MD=1.0, p=0.025, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.9). The anchoring bias intervention reduced 
screening intention (MD=0.8, p=0.044, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.0) and cancer anxiety 
(MD=0.3, p=0.002, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.4) across all conditions.
CONCLUSION: Older adults may reduce their screening intention without reporting 
increased cancer anxiety when clinicians use a more confronting strategy 
communicating they may not live long enough to benefit and add an explicit 
explanation why the recommendation has changed.

OBJECTIVES: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and stress-predominant mixed 
urinary incontinence (MUI) are common conditions that can have a negative impact 
on the quality of life of patients and serious cost implications for healthcare 
providers. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
nine different surgical interventions for treatment of SUI and 
stress-predominant MUI from a National Health Service and personal social 
services perspective in the UK.
METHODS: A Markov microsimulation model was developed to compare the costs and 
effectiveness of nine surgical interventions. The model was informed by 
undertaking a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and network 
meta-analysis. The main clinical parameters in the model were the cure and 
incidence rates of complications after different interventions. The outcomes 
from the model were expressed in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained. In addition, expected value of perfect information (EVPI) 
analyses were conducted to quantify the main uncertainties facing 
decision-makers.
RESULTS: The base-case results suggest that retropubic mid-urethral sling 
(retro-MUS) is the most cost-effective surgical intervention over a 10-year and 
lifetime time horizon. The probabilistic results show that retro-MUS and 
traditional sling are the interventions with the highest probability of being 
cost-effective across all willingness-to-pay thresholds over a lifetime time 
horizon. The value of information analysis results suggest that the largest 
value appears to be in removing uncertainty around the incidence rates of 
complications, the relative treatment effectiveness and health utility values.
CONCLUSIONS: Although retro-MUS appears, at this stage, to be a cost-effective 
intervention, research is needed on possible long-term complications of all 
surgical treatments to provide reassurance of safety, or earlier warning of 
unanticipated adverse effects. The value of information analysis supports the 
need, as a first step, for further research to improve our knowledge of the 
actual incidence of complications.

Homcology is a project that represents both an opportunity for patients who may 
benefit from chemotherapy so far, but present physical and social problems that 
prevent day-hospital access, and a model of "no-profit" contribution to the 
Public Health System. Our medical oncology department conducted the project from 
May 2014 to January 2019. We included frail patients (G-8 < 14), with advanced 
disease, treated with oral, subcutaneous, or parenteral biological agents, with 
limitations to day-hospital access, comorbidities, and at least 6-month life 
expectancy. A multidisciplinary team included three oncologists, four nurses, an 
anesthetist, a psychologist, and a physiotherapist. Satisfaction was evaluated 
with FAMCARE scale. A total of 188 patients (median age of 73 years, 38-87) were 
enrolled. Ninety percent of patients presented with metastatic disease and a 
median G-8 score of 8.8 (3-13.5). All of them received anticancer treatment and 
concomitant supportive care; 24 patients received two or more lines of 
treatment. The median duration of taking care was 175 days (7-1200). A median 
number of 254 (195-325) nursing and 164 (139-190) medical visits were performed 
a year, with an average of 1.9 and 1.2 visits a month per patient respectively. 
The median number of in-line patients was 20 (17-25). Hospitalization occurred 
in 18% of cases. One-third of them died at home. The others were referred to 
hospice. Our experience shows that the integration of home cancer treatment and 
supportive care is effective. Hospitalization rate is lower than data reported 
in the literature. Results need to be confirmed in prospective pharmacoeconomics 
studies.

Inevitable use of plastic materials in our day-to-day life has led to the entry 
of microplastic into aquatic environments, which are plastics less that than 
5 mm. Microplastic is of great concern in recent years due to its impact on 
humans and aquatic organisms since they absorb organic contaminants and 
pathogens from the surrounding media due to higher surface and volume ratio. 
This is the first study attempted to study the distribution and source of 
microplastic contamination in Red Hills Lake which is one of the freshwater 
systems supplying water to the North of Chennai city. Thirty-two sediment 
samples and six water samples were collected covering an area 18.21 km2. The 
presence of microplastic was analyzed in water and sediment as per the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) protocol. The mean concentration 
of microplastic in water samples was 5.9 particles/L and 27 particles/kg in 
sediment. In both sediments and water, the most commonly found microplastic 
types are as follows: fibers (37.9%), fragments (27%), films (24%), and pellets 
(11.1%). Based on the FTIR, the common types of microplastic were of 
high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene, and 
polystyrene. Further samples were evaluated for surface elemental composition in 
order to understand whether heavy metals get adhered to the surface of 
microplastic using energy-dispersive X-ray. Our results indicated the presence 
of microplastic in water and sediments which will lead to further study of 
microplastic presence in biota and microplastic pollution in freshwater systems.

Cardiometabolic diseases are the main contributor of reduced life expectancy in 
patients with schizophrenia. It is now widely accepted that antipsychotic 
treatment plays an important role in the development of obesity and its 
consequences. However, some intrinsic mechanisms need to be taken into 
consideration. One of these mechanisms might be related to impaired hormonal 
regulation of appetite in this group of patients. In this narrative review, we 
aimed to dissect impairments of appetite-regulating hormones attributable to 
intrinsic mechanisms and those related to medication effects. Early hormonal 
alterations that might be associated with intrinsic mechanisms include low 
levels of leptin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) together with elevated 
insulin levels in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients. However, evidence 
regarding low GLP-1 levels in FEP patients is based on one large study. In turn, 
multiple-episode schizophrenia patients show elevated levels of insulin, leptin 
and orexin A together with decreased levels of adiponectin. In addition, 
patients receiving olanzapine may present with low ghrelin levels. Post mortem 
studies have also demonstrated reduced number of neuropeptide Y neurons in the 
prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia. Treatment with certain 
second-generation antipsychotics may also point to these alterations. Although 
our understanding of hormonal regulation of appetite in schizophrenia has 
largely been improved, several limitations and directions for future studies 
need to be addressed. This is of particular importance since several novel 
pharmacological interventions for obesity and diabetes have already been 
developed and translation of these developments to the treatment of 
cardiometabolic comorbidities in schizophrenia patients is needed.

BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome is associated with an increased risk of colorectal 
cancer and with a broader spectrum of cancers, especially endometrial cancer. In 
2011, our group reported long-term cancer outcomes (mean follow-up 55·7 months 
[SD 31·4]) for participants with Lynch syndrome enrolled into a randomised trial 
of daily aspirin versus placebo. This report completes the planned 10-year 
follow-up to allow a longer-term assessment of the effect of taking regular 
aspirin in this high-risk population.
METHODS: In the double-blind, randomised CAPP2 trial, 861 patients from 43 
international centres worldwide (707 [82%] from Europe, 112 [13%] from 
Australasia, 38 [4%] from Africa, and four [<1%] from The Americas) with Lynch 
syndrome were randomly assigned to receive 600 mg aspirin daily or placebo. 
Cancer outcomes were monitored for at least 10 years from recruitment with 
English, Finnish, and Welsh participants being monitored for up to 20 years. The 
primary endpoint was development of colorectal cancer. Analysis was by intention 
to treat and per protocol. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 
number ISRCTN59521990.
FINDINGS: Between January, 1999, and March, 2005, 937 eligible patients with 
Lynch syndrome, mean age 45 years, commenced treatment, of whom 861 agreed to be 
randomly assigned to the aspirin group or placebo; 427 (50%) participants 
received aspirin and 434 (50%) placebo. Participants were followed for a mean of 
10 years approximating 8500 person-years. 40 (9%) of 427 participants who 
received aspirin developed colorectal cancer compared with 58 (13%) of 434 who 
received placebo. Intention-to-treat Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed 
a significantly reduced hazard ratio (HR) of 0·65 (95% CI 0·43-0·97; p=0·035) 
for aspirin versus placebo. Negative binomial regression to account for multiple 
primary events gave an incidence rate ratio of 0·58 (0·39-0·87; p=0·0085). 
Per-protocol analyses restricted to 509 who achieved 2 years' intervention gave 
an HR of 0·56 (0·34-0·91; p=0·019) and an incidence rate ratio of 0·50 
(0·31-0·82; p=0·0057). Non-colorectal Lynch syndrome cancers were reported in 36 
participants who received aspirin and 36 participants who received placebo. 
Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses showed no effect. For all Lynch 
syndrome cancers combined, the intention-to-treat analysis did not reach 
significance but per-protocol analysis showed significantly reduced overall risk 
for the aspirin group (HR=0·63, 0·43-0·92; p=0·018). Adverse events during the 
intervention phase between aspirin and placebo groups were similar, and no 
significant difference in compliance between intervention groups was observed 
for participants with complete intervention phase data; details reported 
previously.
INTERPRETATION: The case for prevention of colorectal cancer with aspirin in 
Lynch syndrome is supported by our results.

INTRODUCTION: The issues and concerns that emerge in the families of burn 
patients have received minimal attention.
OBJECTIVE: To map out what is known about the challenges facing the family 
members of burn patients.
METHODS: The review followed the PRISMA Extension guidelines for scoping reviews 
and the review approach by Arksey and O'Malley to synthesize the available 
evidence. Twenty-six (26) papers from various database searches were identified 
and included in the review. The citation retrieval and retention methods are 
reported in a PRISMA statement.
RESULTS: Although most of the studies included parents (n=21), the evidence 
suggests that the shared concerns of family members include taking on new roles, 
and psychosocial and financial issues. Uniquely, parents had to endure blame, 
shame and guilt; partners/spouses were faced with difficulties in 
re-establishing an emotional connection with the patient; siblings 
simultaneously expressed jealousy and feelings of being outsiders; and children 
with a burn parent had to deal with feelings of exclusion from the care delivery 
process. Aside from these individuals, friends, neighbours and in-laws may also 
assume a caregiving role, with grandparents playing a supporting role. Family 
members are unprepared for their roles, as they are forced into them suddenly. 
Although distress may occur among family members, its determinants, severity, 
pattern and recovery process remain unclear.
CONCLUSION: A burn is a family injury that creates the need for family-centred 
care. Future studies need to explore the nature of psychological distress, 
family members' recovery pathways, and how family members can prepare for their 
roles in the period after discharge.

Betalain-rich extracts have been used for many years by their nutraceutical 
potential. However, the study of their bioactivities has always been hampered by 
their difficult obtention. To explain their mode of action, seventeen pure 
betalains were tested in vivo using the animal model C. elegans. Four betalains, 
named indicaxanthin, indoline carboxylic acid-betacyanin, 
phenylalanine-betaxanthin, and dopaxanthin, behaved as extraordinary in vivo 
antioxidants and anti-aging compounds, by increasing the lifespan of C. elegans 
up to 16.82%, 16.65%, 16.53%, and 12.93%, respectively. The first microarrays 
performed with betalains and biological confirmation with different mutant 
strains showed that this life extension is due to a reduction of oxidative 
stress and the activation of the transcription factors DAF-16/FOXO and 
SKN-1/Nrf2. They are involved in longevity and oxidative stress resistance 
pathways and lead to overexpression of HSPs genes, involved in resistance to 
cancer and Alzheimer's, opening novel research lines in the search for effective 
plant-based treatments.

BACKGROUND: The cost effectiveness of combining vascularized lymph node transfer 
(VLNT) with autologous breast reconstruction has not been established. Herein we 
describe the use of Markov modeling to evaluate the cost utility of VLNT with 
delayed autologous breast reconstruction for patients with breast cancer related 
lymphedema (BCRL).
METHODS: We conducted a cost effectiveness analysis using a Markov model with 
microsimulation. The characteristics and associated life expectancy of the 
hypothetical patients were derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results database. Costs of were derived from the publicly available sources and 
health economics literature. The utilities were based on the best available 
literature. The relative effectiveness of VLNT was derived from a meta-analysis 
of the literature. A specific strategy is considered attractive if the estimate 
of incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) is less than the amount decision 
makers are willing to pay for an additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gain. A baseline willingness to pay of $50,000 USD per additional QALY was used 
for analysis.
RESULTS: The base case situation demonstrated an overall ICER of $13898.76/QALY 
for adding VLNT to delayed autologous abdominally based breast reconstruction in 
the situation where lymphedema is already present, which suggests it is 
cost-effective at the chosen willingness to pay.
DISCUSSION: This cost-utility simulation demonstrates that it is cost effective 
to combine delayed breast reconstruction with VLNT in patients with existing 
lymphedema. This could have implications for the application of the evolving 
technique of VLNT in the treatment of different subpopulations of breast cancer 
patients, and future clinical research.

INTRODUCTION: The aim was to assess cost-effectiveness of including pneumococcal 
vaccination for elderly in a national vaccination programme in Sweden, comparing 
health-effects and costs of pneumococcal related diseases with a vaccination 
programme versus no vaccination.
METHOD: We used a single-cohort deterministic decision-tree model to simulate 
the current burden of pneumococcal disease in Sweden. The model accounted for 
invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and pneumonia caused by pneumococci. Costs 
included in the analysis were those incurred when treating pneumococcal disease, 
and acquisition and administration of the vaccine. Health effects were measured 
as quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The time-horizon was set to five years, 
both effects and costs were discounted by 3% annually. Health-effects and costs 
were accumulated over the time-horizon and used to create an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio. The 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) was used 
in the base-case analysis. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV13 
was included in sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: A vaccination programme using PPV23 would reduce the burden of 
pneumococcal related disease significantly, both when vaccinating a 65-year-old 
cohort and a 75-year-old cohort. IPD would decrease by 30% in the 65-year-old 
cohort, and by 29% in the 75-year-old cohort. The corresponding figures for CAP 
(communicable acquired pneumonia) are 19% and 15%. The cost per gained QALY was 
estimated to EUR 94,000 for vaccinating 65-year-olds and EUR 29,500 for 
75-year-olds. With one dose PCV13 given instead of PPV23, the cost per gained 
QALY would increase by around 400% for both cohorts. The results were robust in 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Introducing a vaccination programme against pneumococcal disease for 
65-year-olds in Sweden is unlikely to be cost-effective, whereas it for 
75 year-olds and using PPV23 can be considered good value for money. Our model 
indicates that vaccine price needs to be reduced by 55% for vaccination of 
65-year-olds to be cost-effective, given a threshold of EUR 50,000.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative condition, 
most widely characterized by the selective vulnerability of motor neurons and 
the poor life expectancy of afflicted patients. Limited disease-modifying 
therapies currently exist, which only further attests to the substantial 
heterogeneity associated with this disease. In addition to established 
prognostic factors like genetic background, site of onset, and age at onset, 
wide consensus on the role of neuroinflammation as a disease exacerbator and 
driver has been established. In lieu of this, the emerging literature on 
chitinases in ALS is particularly intriguing. Individual groups have reported 
substantially elevated chitotriosidase (CHIT1), chitinase-3-like-1 (CHI3L1), and 
chitinase-3-like-2 (CHI3L2) levels in the cerebrospinal, motor cortex, and 
spinal cord of ALS patients with multiple-and often conflicting-lines of 
evidence hinting at possible links to disease severity and progression. This 
mini-review, while not exhaustive, will aim to discuss current evidence on the 
involvement of key chitinases in ALS within the wider framework of other 
neurodegenerative conditions. Implications for understanding disease etiology, 
developing immunomodulatory therapies and biomarkers, and other translational 
opportunities will be considered.

Pediatrics, among all the branches of medicine, is a sector not particularly 
affected by a high number of claims. Nevertheless, the economic value of the 
compensation is significantly high, for example, in cases of children who 
suffered multiple disabilities following perinatal lesions with a long life 
expectancy. In Italy, most of the claims for compensation concern surgical 
pathologies and infections. Among these latter, the dominant role is taken by 
respiratory tract infections. In this context, the purpose of this manuscript is 
to present a case series of infant deaths in different emergency-related 
facilities (ambulances, emergency rooms) denounced by relatives. Following these 
complaints, the autopsy was performed, and subsequent histological examinations 
revealed the presence of typical and pathognomonic histological findings of 
acute viral bronchiolitis, whose morphological appearance is poorly reported in 
the literature. The analysis of these cases made it possible to highlight the 
following conclusions: the main problems in diagnosing sudden death causes, 
especially in childhood, are the rapidity of death and the scarce correlation 
between the preexistent diseases and of the cause of death itself. For all these 
reasons, the autopsy, either clinical or medicolegal, is mandatory in cases of 
sudden unexpected infant death to manage claim requests because only the 
histological examinations performed on samples collected during the autopsy can 
reveal the real cause of death.

BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of patients who survive traumatic injury 
continue to suffer impaired functional status and increased mortality long after 
discharge. However, despite the need to improve long-term outcomes, trauma 
registries in the USA do not collect data on outcomes or care processes after 
discharge. One of the main barriers is the lack of consensus regarding the 
optimal outcome metrics.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the methodology of a scoping review evaluating current 
evidence on the available measures for tracking functional and patient-reported 
outcomes after injury. The aim of the review was to identify and summarize 
measures that are being used to track long-term functional recovery and 
patient-reported outcomes among adults after injury.
METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Embase will be performed using the 
search terms for the population (adult trauma patients), type of outcomes 
(long-term physical, mental, cognitive, and quality of life), and measures 
available to track them. Studies identified will be reviewed and assessed for 
relevance by at least two reviewers. Data will be extracted and summarized using 
descriptive statistics and a narrative synthesis of the results. This protocol 
is being reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) 
guidelines.
DISSEMINATION: This scoping review will provide information regarding the 
currently available metrics for tracking functional and patient-reported 
outcomes after injury. The review will be presented to a multi-disciplinary 
stakeholder group that will evaluate these outcome metrics using an online 
Delphi approach to achieve consensus as part of the development of the National 
Trauma Research Action Plan (NTRAP). The results of this review will be 
presented at relevant national surgical conferences and published in 
peer-reviewed scientific journals.

BACKGROUND: Deprescribing is of particular importance in older adults with 
limited life expectancy since this population group is highly susceptible to the 
potential harms of inappropriate medications.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to explore attitudes towards 
deprescribing among older adults with limited life expectancy and their 
relatives.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted in the MEDLINE and EMBASE 
databases from inception to October 2019. Inclusion criteria were studies 
specifically describing attitudes towards deprescribing among older adults 
(≥ 65 years) with limited life expectancy and/or their relatives regardless of 
study type. Results were analyzed, inspired by the Joanna Briggs Institute's 
method for synthesis of qualitative data.
RESULTS: A total of 842 studies were identified and screened; 84 were full-text 
assessed for eligibility and 7 were ultimately included. Two studies 
investigated the attitudes of older adults with limited life expectancy and 
their relatives towards deprescribing of statins and donepezil, respectively, 
while the five remaining studies related to attitudes towards deprescribing in 
general. Four main themes were identified: (1) the well-being of older adults 
with limited life expectancy; (2) involvement of older adults and their 
relatives in deprescribing; (3) the role of health care professionals in 
deprescribing; and (4) medication-related factors affecting deprescribing. 
Within each of these themes, several subthemes were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Attitudes towards deprescribing among older adults with limited 
life expectancy and their relatives vary and highlight several barriers and 
enablers to the deprescribing process. Several of these factors must be 
addressed to successfully implement deprescribing initiatives in this patient 
group.

BACKGROUND: Clinical evidence supports the use of genetic counselling and 
BRCA1/2 testing for women at risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. 
Currently, screen-and-treat strategies are not reimbursed in the Brazilian 
Unified Healthcare System (SUS). The aim of this modelling study was to evaluate 
the cost effectiveness of a gene-based screen-and-treat strategy for BRCA1/2 in 
women with a high familial risk followed by preventive interventions compared 
with no screening.
METHODS: Adopting the SUS perspective, a Markov model with a lifelong time 
horizon was developed for a cohort of healthy women aged 30 years that fulfilled 
the criteria for BRCA1/2 testing according to the National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network (NCCN) guideline. For women who tested positive, preventive options 
included intensified surveillance, risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy and 
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The Markov model comprised the health states 
'well', 'breast cancer', 'death' and two post-cancer states. Outcomes were the 
incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and the incremental 
costs per life-year gained (LYG). Data were mainly obtained by a literature 
review. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to 
assess the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: In the base case, the screen-and-treat strategy resulted in additional 
costs of 3515 Brazilian reais (R$) (US$1698) and a gain of 0.145 QALYs, compared 
with no screening. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was R$24,263 
(US$21,724) per QALY and R$27,258 (US$24,405) per LYG. Applying deterministic 
sensitivity analyses, the ICER was most sensitive to the probability of a 
positive test result and the discount rate. In the probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, a willingness to pay of R$25,000 per QALY gained for the 
screen-and-treat strategy resulted in a probability of cost effectiveness of 
80%.
CONCLUSION: Although there is no rigorous cost-effectiveness threshold in 
Brazil, the result of this cost-effectiveness analysis may support the inclusion 
of BRCA1/2 testing for women at high-risk of cancer in the SUS. The ICER 
calculated for the provision of genetic testing for BRCA1/2 approximates the 
cost-effectiveness threshold proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for 
low- and middle-income countries.

BACKGROUND: Access to community palliative care 'out-of-hours' - defined as care 
provided after the normal hours of work - is advocated globally. Healthcare 
assistants, who provide care under the direction of a qualified professional, 
are increasingly employed to help deliver such care, yet there is a little 
understanding regarding their role, responsibilities or contribution.
AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the roles, responsibilities and 
contributions of healthcare assistants in out-of-hours community palliative 
care.
DESIGN: Scoping review.
DATA SOURCES: Five bibliographic databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO 
and Scopus) and grey literature were searched using a predefined search 
strategy. The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews 
statement.
RESULTS: The search yielded six papers using quantitative, qualitative and mixed 
methods. Results highlighted a lack of recognition of the role and contribution 
of healthcare assistants. A concurrent theme was that healthcare assistants 
continually monitored and responded to patient's and family's physical and 
emotional needs; there was also self-reported evidence indicating patient and 
family benefit, such as maintaining a sense of normality and support to remain 
at home.
DISCUSSION: This review highlighted a dearth of evidence relating to the 
healthcare assistant role in out-of-hours palliative care. Limited evidence 
suggests they play a role, but that it is hidden and undervalued. Such 
invisibility will have a significant impact on the planning and delivery of 
out-of-hours palliative care. Future research is needed on role development for 
the benefit of patients and caregivers.

This work begins with the difference between sex and gender, then show that the 
contrasts in the field of health between men and women can be explained: by the 
construction of gender of consultants and health service providers, by the 
structure of the services themselves of health (which also reflects gender 
constructions), and by the reproduction of gender patterns through education and 
research. The work shows the need to include a gender perspective in health 
research.

Publisher: Este trabajo inicia con la diferencia entre sexo y género, para 
mostrar que los contrastes en el campo de la salud entre hombres y mujeres 
pueden explicarse por la construcción de género de consultantes y de proveedores 
de servicios de salud, por la estructura de los propios servicios de salud (que 
refleja también construcciones de género) y por la reproducción de patrones de 
género a través de la educación y la investigación. El trabajo muestra la 
necesidad de incluir la perspectiva de género en la investigación en salud.

The mesentery is the organ in which all abdominal digestive organs develop, and 
which maintains these in systemic continuity in adulthood. Interest in the 
mesentery was rekindled by advancements of Heald and Hohenberger in colorectal 
surgery. Conventional descriptions hold there are multiple mesenteries centrally 
connected to the posterior midline. Recent advances first demonstrated that, 
distal to the duodenojejunal flexure, the mesentery is a continuous collection 
of tissues. This observation explained how the small and large intestines are 
centrally connected, and the anatomy of the associated peritoneal landscape. In 
turn it prompted recategorisation of the mesentery as an organ. Subsequent work 
demonstrated the mesentery remains continuous throughout development, and that 
abdominal digestive organs (i.e. liver, spleen, intestine and pancreas) develop 
either on, or in it. This relationship is retained into adulthood when abdominal 
digestive organs are directly connected to the mesentery (i.e. they are 
'mesenteric' in embryological origin and anatomical position). Recognition of 
mesenteric continuity identified the mesenteric model of abdominal anatomy 
according to which all abdominal abdomino-pelvic organs are organised into 
either a mesenteric or a non-mesenteric domain. This model explains the 
positional anatomy of all abdominal digestive organs, and associated 
vasculature. Moreover, it explains the peritoneal landscape and enables 
differentiation of peritoneum from the mesentery. Increased scientific focus on 
the mesentery has identified multiple vital or specialised functions. These vary 
across time and in anatomical location. The following review demonstrates how 
recent advances related to the mesentery are re-orientating the study of human 
biology in general and, by extension, clinical practice.
