In Europe, there were almost twice as many patents granted for medical 
technology (13,795) compared to pharmaceuticals (7441) in 2018. It is important 
to ask how to integrate such an amount of innovations into routine clinical 
practice and how to measure the value it brings to the healthcare system. Given 
the novelty of digital health interventions (DHI), one can even question whether 
the quality-adjusted life years (QALY) approach developed for pharmaceuticals 
can be used or whether we need to develop a new DHI's value assessment 
framework. We conducted a systematic literature review of published DHIs' 
assessment guidelines. Each publication was analyzed with a 12-items checklist 
based on a EUnetHTA core model enriched with additional criteria such as 
usability, interoperability, and data security. In total, 11 value assessment 
guidelines were identified. The review revealed that safety, clinical 
effectiveness, usability, economic aspects, and interoperability were most often 
discussed (seven out of 11). More than half of the guidelines addressed 
organizational impact, data security, choice of comparator, and technical 
considerations (six out of 11). The unmet medical needs (three out of 11), along 
with the ethical (two out of 11) and legal aspects (one out of 11), were given 
the least attention. No author provided an analytical framework for the 
calculation of clinical and economic outcomes. We elicited five recommendations 
for the choice of DHI's value criteria and a methodological suggestion for the 
pricing and reimbursement framework. Our conclusions lead to the need for a new 
DHI's value assessment framework instead of a QALY approach.

PURPOSE: MicroRNAs are small single-strand noncoding RNAs that can be 
deregulated in a variety of cancers. Over the past few years, multiple markers 
have been discovered in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Among these, miRNAs 
seem to have important roles in the pathogenesis of CLL. The development and 
validation of miRNA-expression patterns as biomarkers should have a significant 
impact in cancer diagnosis, therapeutic success, and increasing the life 
expectancy of patients. In this study, to specify the utility of circulatory 
miRNA expression as noninvasive and useful biomarkers for CLL, we analyzed the 
dysregulation of seven miRNAs: miR30d, miR25-3p, miR19a-3p, miR133b, miR451a, 
miR145, and miR144 in CLL-patient sera.
METHODS: Thirty untreated patients with flow-cytometry confirmation of CLL were 
chosen. Serum samples were collected from 30 newly diagnosed CLL patients. 
Fifteen healthy samples were taken for comparison as controls. RNA was extracted 
using Trizol. RNA from CLL patient specimens was compared to controls with 
real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Seven miRNAs were differently expressed between CLL and normal 
specimens using the comparative 2-ΔΔCt method. miRNAs 133b, 25-3p, 451a, 145, 
19a-3p, and 144 were overexpressed in sera obtained from CLL patients, and 
miRNA-30d was underexpressed in patient samples. Among these seven miRNAs, 
miR19a-3p and miR25-3p showed the most deregulation in CLL patients.
CONCLUSION: Real-time PCR is an applied means to perform high-throughput 
investigation of serum-RNA samples. We assessed the expression of seven miRNAs 
in CLL patients by this method. The results demonstrated that the use of 
miRNA-expression profiling may have an impressive role in the diagnosis of CLL. 
In addition, miRNA 19a-3p and 25-3p are known oncogenes with therapeutic and 
potential biomarkers.

Evolutionary Strategies for Body Size.

Little MA(1).

York, Binghamton, NY, United States.

Humans show marked variation in body size around the world, both within and 
among populations. At present, the tallest people in the world are from the 
Netherlands and the Balkan countries, while the shortest populations are central 
African Pygmies. There are genetic, genetic plasticity, developmental, and 
environmental bases for size variation in Homo sapiens from the recent past and 
the present. Early populations of Homo species also have shown considerable size 
variation. Populations from the present and the past are also marked by sexual 
dimorphism, which, itself, shows group variation. There is abundant evidence for 
the effects of limited food and disease on human growth and resultant adult body 
size. This environmental influence has been reflected in "secular trends" (over 
a span of years) in growth and adult size from socioeconomic prosperity or 
poverty (availability of resources). Selective and evolutionary advantages of 
small or large body size also have been documented. Heritability for human 
height is relatively great with current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
identifying hundreds of genes leading to causes of growth and adult size 
variation. There are also endocrinological pathways limiting growth. An example 
is the reduced tissue sensitivity to human growth hormone (HGH) and insulin-like 
growth factor (IGF-1) in Philippine and African hunter-gatherer populations. In 
several short-statured hunter-gatherer populations (Asian, African, and South 
American), it has been hypothesized that short life expectancy has selected for 
early maturity and truncated growth to enhance fertility. Some island 
populations of humans and other mammals are thought to have been selected for 
small size because of limited resources, especially protein. The high-protein 
content of milk as a staple food may contribute to tall stature in East African 
pastoral peoples. These and other evolutionary questions linked to life history, 
male competition, reproduction, and mobility are explored in this paper.

Qatar.

Recent research efforts provided compelling evidence of genome-wide DNA 
methylation alterations in aging and age-related disease. It is currently well 
established that DNA methylation biomarkers can determine biological age of any 
tissue across the entire human lifespan, even during development. There is 
growing evidence suggesting epigenetic age acceleration to be strongly linked to 
common diseases or occurring in response to various environmental factors. DNA 
methylation based clocks are proposed as biomarkers of early disease risk as 
well as predictors of life expectancy and mortality. In this review, we will 
summarize key advances in epigenetic clocks and their potential application in 
precision health. We will also provide an overview of progresses in epigenetic 
biomarker discovery in Alzheimer's, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. 
Furthermore, we will highlight the importance of prospective study designs to 
identify and confirm epigenetic biomarkers of disease.

Melanoma is a frequent neoplasm in young adult males in reproductive age, 10% of 
them degenerating into regional and/or distant metastases (MM). The use of BRAF 
inhibitors (BRAFi) vemurafenib and dabrafenib is effective in MM patients 
harboring BRAF V600E/K/D mutations. Despite the increased life expectancy in MM 
patients treated with BRAFi, concerns are raised by the possible side effects 
and increased risk of gonado- and/or genotoxicity associated with these drugs. 
However, these aspects are currently under-investigated. Here we report the 
different fertility outcome in two cases of MM patients, harboring BRAF V600E 
mutation, that received vemurafenib and dabrafenib respectively. The first 
patient, 36 years at recruitment in 2015 and seeking fatherhood, had an history 
of relapsing melanoma since 2002 and undergone to numerous interventions and 
chemotherapy cycles. In November 2011, following detection of BRAF V600E 
mutation, a daily treatment with vemurafenib (1,440 mg) was prescribed with 
preventive gamete cryopreservation. BRAFi was effective in the clinical 
stabilization of the disease. In 2015, semen evaluation at follow-up showed 
sperm parameters within the normal range and no signs of alteration of either 
sperm function or sperm-DNA. On these bases, no contraindications for fatherhood 
were given. After a month of free intercourses, the 38-year-old partner achieved 
spontaneous pregnancy with a regular course, normal male fetal karyotype and a 
full term birth. The second patient, 39 years at recruitment in 2018 and seeking 
fatherhood, had an history of melanoma since 2012. In 2018, following the 
evidence of disease relapse and detection of the BRAF V600E mutation, treatment 
with dabrafenib/trametinib (300 mg/day/2 mg/day) was initiated together with 
preventive gamete cryopreservation. In 2019, semen evaluation at follow up 
showed sperm count and motility below the reference values, associated with 
increased indexes of sperm aneuploidies and sperm DNA fragmentation. 
Accordingly, access to assisted reproduction technique with cryopreserved 
spermatozoa was suggested. Differently from dabrafenib that was associated to 
damage to spermatogenesis, high-dose vemurafenib showed no association with 
gonadotoxicity and genotoxicity in humans, even at high doses. Although further 
confirmation are required, our data represent a valued cue in oncofertility 
counseling to MM patients in addition to preventive cryopreservation.

Hemophilia A is a rare genetic disorder involving a deficiency of clotting 
factor VIII. Coagulation factor replacement therapy has prolonged the life 
expectancy of patients with hemophilia, but recurrent hemarthrosis of major 
joints is often a common occurrence. Therefore, orthopaedic adult reconstructive 
surgeons increasingly encounter hemophilic arthropathy in young adults and 
consider treating with total joint arthroplasty. In this report, the authors 
describe a patient with hemophilia A and severe knee osteoarthritis, who was 
subsequently treated with primary total knee arthroplasty. This rare case is an 
opportunity to explore a variety of unique clinical scenarios specific to 
patients with hemophilia, including the maintenance of optimal factor VIII 
levels through clotting factor infusions and prevention of a venous 
thromboembolic event.

BACKGROUND: Average female life expectancy in Japan is approximately 90 years. 
Occasionally, we encounter stroke patients older than 90 years.
AIMS: To determine the clinical features and outcomes associated with cerebral 
infarction in patients aged ≥ 90 years.
METHODS: We examined 289 consecutive patients (163 males, 129 females; mean age 
77.5 years) diagnosed with cerebral infarction. We divided them into four groups 
according to age in years: middle (< 65), pre-old (65-74), old (75-89), and 
super old (≥ 90). We divided the super old group into mild symptoms (NIHSS ≤ 5) 
and severe symptoms (NIHSS > 5) and examined outcomes.
RESULTS: Statistically significant associations were observed between female 
sex, cardiogenic infarction, and high complication rates and super old age. 
NIHSS and mRS scores at 30-day post-stroke were higher in the super old group. 
In some cases, complications led to poor prognoses. Eighty-seven percent of 
patients with mild symptoms (NIHSS ≤ 5) recovered to mRS 0-2 similar to the 
younger age group. None of the patients with severe symptoms (NIHSS > 5) 
recovered to mRS 0-2.
DISCUSSION: We investigated the clinical outcomes following cerebral infarction 
in patients aged 90 years or older and found that mild symptoms were 
consistently associated with good prognoses, regardless of patients' age.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the super old group had more severe symptoms and poorer 
outcomes than younger age groups. However, patients with mild symptoms tended to 
have better prognoses and returned to daily life similar to the younger age 
group.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition worsens health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the 
prognosis of patients with advanced cancer. This study aimed to assess the 
clinical benefits of parenteral nutrition (PN) over oral feeding (OF) for 
patients with advanced cancer cachexia and without intestinal impairment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective multicentric randomized controlled 
study, patients with advanced cancer and malnutrition were randomly assigned to 
optimized nutritional care with or without supplemental PN. Zelen's method was 
used for randomization to facilitate inclusions. Nutritional and performance 
status and HRQoL using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer QLQ-C15-PAL questionnaire were evaluated at baseline and monthly until 
death. Primary endpoint was HRQoL deterioration-free survival (DFS) defined as a 
definitive deterioration of ≥10 points compared with baseline, or death.
RESULTS: Among the 148 randomized patients, 48 patients were in the experimental 
arm with PN, 63 patients were in the control arm with OF only, and 37 patients 
were not included because of early withdrawal or refused consent. In an intent 
to treat analysis, there was no difference in HRQoL DFS between the PN arm or OF 
arm for the three targeted dimensions: global health (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-1.94; p = .18), physical functioning (HR, 
1.58; 95% CI, 1.06-2.35; p = .024), and fatigue (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.80-1.77; p 
= .40); there was a negative trend for overall survival among patients in the PN 
arm. In as treated analysis, serious adverse events (mainly infectious) were 
more frequent in the PN arm than in the OF arm (p = .01).
CONCLUSION: PN improved neither HRQoL nor survival and induced more serious 
adverse events than OF among patients with advanced cancer and malnutrition. 
Clinical trial identification number. NCT02151214 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: 
This clinical trial showed that parenteral nutrition improved neither quality of 
life nor survival and generated more serious adverse events than oral feeding 
only among patients with advanced cancer cachexia and no intestinal impairment. 
Parenteral nutrition should not be prescribed for patients with advanced cancer, 
cachexia, and no intestinal failure when life expectancy is shorter than 3 
months. Further studies are needed to assess the useful period with a potential 
benefit of artificial nutrition for patients with advanced cancer.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is widely used; 
however, its appropriateness is unknown. We sought to investigate the 
appropriateness of TAVR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We assigned appropriateness ratings to patients undergoing 
TAVR for severe aortic stenosis between October 2013 and May 2017 at 14 Japanese 
hospitals participating in the optimized transcatheter valvular 
intervention-transcatheter aortic valve implantation registry according to the 
US appropriate use criteria for treating severe aortic stenosis. To account for 
the influence of uncaptured variables on appropriate use criteria ratings, we 
initially assigned them to a best-case scenario where they were assumed to 
classify a case to the most appropriate clinical scenario and then to a 
worst-case scenario where assumed least appropriate. Overall proportion of TAVRs 
classified as appropriate, maybe appropriate, or rarely appropriate was 
assessed. In addition, extent of hospital-level variation in rarely appropriate 
procedures was evaluated. Of 2036 TAVRs (median age [25th, 75th]: 85.0 years 
[81.0-88.0]; 70.5% female the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of 
Mortality score: 6.2% [4.4-8.9]), in the best-case scenario, 177 (8.7%) were not 
successfully mapped, and 1580 (77.6%) were classified as appropriate, 180 (8.8%) 
as maybe appropriate, 99 (4.9%) as rarely appropriate, respectively. In the 
worst-case scenario, the rate of rarely appropriate increased to 6.8%. The 
majority of rarely appropriate TAVRs was performed in patients with moderate to 
severe dementia (defined as mini-mental status examination of ≤17), bicuspid 
aortic valve, or anticipated life expectancy <1 year. There was substantial 
variation in the proportion of rarely appropriate TAVR across hospitals (median 
rate of rarely appropriate: 4.9% [3.8-6.6] in the best-case scenario, P<0.001; 
6.5% [5.6-8.6] in the worst-case scenario, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, the proportion of rarely appropriate TAVRs 
ranged from 4.9% to 6.8% with substantial institutional variation. Our study 
elucidates common clinical scenarios deemed rarely appropriate and clarifies the 
potential targets of quality improvement. Registration: URL:

BACKGROUND: Considering the limitations in both uncovered self-expandable 
metallic stents (USEMS) and covered self-expandable metallic stents (CSEMS), it 
is difficult to make a general recommendation for their application in 
percutaneous decompression of malignant biliary obstruction (MBO).
PURPOSE: To compare percutaneous transhepatic CSEMSs versus USEMSs for the 
palliative treatment of MBO in terms of technical success, clinical success, 
stent patency, patient survival, complications, and stent dysfunction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective randomized study included 66 patients 
with unresectable MBO. CSEMSs were inserted in 31 patients (26 men, 5 women; 
mean age = 63.8 ± 7.96 years) and USEMSs were inserted in 35 patients (26 men, 9 
women; mean age = 62.3 ± 11.7 years).
RESULTS: Mean primary stent patency duration was 138 ± 92.7 days in CSEMSs 
versus 150 ± 77.9 days in USEMSs (P = 0.578). Tumor overgrowth occurred 
exclusively in one patient with CSEMS (P = 0.470) and tumor ingrowth exclusively 
in two patients with USEMS (P = 0.494). Stent migration occurred in two patients 
with CSEMSs versus one patient with USEMSs (P = 0.579). Hemobilia occurred in 
five patients with CSEMSs versus three patients with USEMSs while bile leakage 
occurred in one patient in each group despite the larger introducer sheath 
caliber with CSEMSs (9 F vs. 6-7 F). There was no significant difference 
regarding patient survival (P = 0.969).
CONCLUSION: In our cohort of patients with rather poor life expectancy, there 
was no significant difference between covered and uncovered stents for the 
palliative treatment of MBO. However, considering the higher cost of CSEMs and 
the larger introducer diameter necessary for their placement, USEMSs can be 
preferred.

BACKGROUND: Despite its role as an effective intervention to improve the 
long-term health of patients with cardiovascular disease and existence of 
national guidelines on timeliness, many health services still fail to offer 
cardiac rehabilitation in a timely manner after referral. The impact of this 
failure on patient health and the additional burden on healthcare providers in 
an English setting is quantified in this article.
METHODS: Two logistic regressions are conducted, using the British Heart 
Foundation National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation dataset, to estimate the 
impact of delayed cardiac rehabilitation initiation on the level of uptake and 
completion. The results of these regressions are applied to a decision model to 
estimate the long-term implications of these factors on patient health and 
National Health Service expenditure.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that the failure of 43.6% of patients in England to 
start cardiac rehabilitation within the recommended timeframe results in a 15.3% 
reduction in uptake, and 7.4% in completion. These combine to cause an average 
lifetime loss of 0.08 years of life expectancy per person. Scaled up to an 
annual cohort this implies 10,753 patients not taking up cardiac rehabilitation 
due to the delay, equating to a loss of 3936 years of life expectancy. We 
estimate that an additional £12.3 million of National Health Service funding 
could be invested to alleviate the current delay.
CONCLUSIONS: The current delay in many patients starting cardiac rehabilitation 
is causing quantifiable and avoidable harm to their long-term health; policy and 
research must now look at both supply and demand solutions in tackling this 
issue.

Objectives: The approval in more than 50 countries of baricitinib, an oral Janus 
Kinase inhibitor for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), warrants a 
framework for corresponding economic evaluations. To develop a comprehensive 
economic model assessing the cost-effectiveness of baricitinib for the treatment 
of moderately-to-severely active RA patients in comparison to other relevant 
treatments, considering the natural history of the disease, real world treatment 
patterns, and clinical evidence from the baricitinib trials.Methods: A 
systematic literature review of previously developed models in RA was conducted 
to inform the model structure, key modeling assumptions and data inputs. 
Consultations with rheumatologists were undertaken to validate the modeling 
approach and underlying assumptions.Results: A discrete event simulation model 
was developed to international best practices with flexibility to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of baricitinib over a lifetime in a variety of markets. The 
model incorporates treatment sequencing to adequately reflect treatment pathways 
in clinical practice. Outcomes assessed include cost and quality-adjusted life 
years, allowing for a full incremental analysis of cost-effectiveness of 
competing treatments and treatment sequences.Conclusion: The economic model 
developed provides a robust framework for future analyses assessing the 
cost-effectiveness of baricitinib for the treatment of RA in specific country 
settings.

Objective: This economic evaluation aims to provide a preliminary assessment of 
the cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) compared with argon 
plasma coagulation (APC) when used to treat APC-refractory gastric antral 
vascular ectasia (GAVE) in symptomatic patients.Methods: A Markov model was 
constructed to undertake a cost-utility analysis for adults with persistent 
symptoms secondary to GAVE refractory to first line endoscopic therapy. The 
economic evaluation was conducted from a UK NHS and personal social services 
(PSS) perspective, with a 20-year time horizon, comparing RFA with APC. Patients 
transfer between health states defined by haemoglobin level. The clinical 
effectiveness data were sourced from expert opinion, resource use and costs were 
reflective of the UK NHS and benefits were quantified using Quality Adjusted 
Life Years (QALYs) with utility weights taken from the literature. The primary 
output was the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), expressed as cost 
per QALY gained.Results: Over a lifetime time horizon, the base case ICER was 
£4840 per QALY gained with an 82.2% chance that RFA was cost-effective at a 
threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained. The model estimated that implementing RFA 
would result in reductions in the need for intravenous iron, endoscopic 
intervention and requirement for blood transfusions by 27.1%, 32.3% and 36.5% 
respectively. Compared to APC, RFA was associated with an estimated 36.7% fewer 
procedures.Conclusions: RFA treatment is likely to be cost-effective for 
patients with ongoing symptoms following failure of first line therapy with APC 
and could lead to substantive reductions in health care resource.

In the southeastern United States, Armillaria root rot (ARR) is caused by 
Desarmillaria tabescens and has become the primary cause of premature mortality 
in peach orchards. Most rootstocks used in commercial orchards are susceptible 
and management options are limited. A postinfection practice known as 
root-collar excavation (RCE), which involves permanent removal of the soil from 
the base of the trunk, has been shown to improve yields and prolong the 
productive life of symptomatic trees. However, symptomatic trees already have an 
advanced infection at the base of the trunk. This study evaluated the efficacy 
of preventative RCE on the progression of tree mortality in two orchards that 
were planted in infested replant sites. To provide convincing data for growers, 
the study was carried out in a commercial orchard and an experimental orchard 
for 8 years. Furthermore, representative enterprise budgets and net present 
value (NPV) analysis were utilized to compare the profitability of the two 
approaches. Trees were planted shallow on berms (45 by 90 cm) to facilitate RCE 
with hoes and AirSpade 2 years later. Tree mortality in the RCE treatment of the 
experimental orchard was first observed in year 6 and increased 8% on average 
per year thereafter. In contrast, tree mortality in the "Grower Standard" 
treatment was first observed in year 4 and increased 12.7% on average per year 
thereafter. At the commercial orchard, tree mortality in the RCE treatment was 
first observed in year 7 and increased 1.9% on average thereafter, while tree 
mortality in the Grower Standard treatment first appeared in year 5 and 
increased 4.3% on average thereafter. The delayed onset of ARR-associated tree 
mortality and the lower annual tree mortality rate in the RCE treatment led to 
higher NPVs in both locations. There were no negative effects on yield or fruit 
quality. However, the new planting system can create horticultural challenges, 
including the formation of a proper berm, uneven ground around the tree 
interfering with tree care and harvest, increased erosion due to channeling of 
rainwater, and increased rootstock suckering. The RCE is a valid option for 
southeastern growers needing to manage high ARR disease pressure on replant 
sites or on sites only recently cleared from ARR-infected forest land.

BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is among the most severe chronic 
lung diseases and predominantly affects premature infants. There is a general 
understanding of BPD's significant impact on the short-term outcomes however 
there is little evidence on long-term outcomes. Our study estimates the lifetime 
clinical outcomes, quality of life, and healthcare costs of BPD and associated 
complications.
METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model to estimate lifetime clinical and 
economic burden of BPD among extreme preterm infants (≤28 weeks gestational age 
at birth) and validated it against the best available Canadian data. We further 
estimate the cumulative incidence of major complications associated with BPD, 
differentiated by BPD severity and gestational age category.
RESULTS: We find, on average, patients with BPD and resulting complications will 
incur over CAD$700,000 in lifetime health systems costs. We also find the 
average life expectancy of BPD patients to be moderately less than that of the 
general population and significant reductions in quality-adjusted life year due 
to major complications. Healthcare utilization and quality of life measures vary 
dramatically according to BPD severity, suggesting significant therapeutic 
headroom for interventions that can prevent or mitigate the effects of BPD for 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study adds a significant expansion of existing evidence by 
presenting the lifetime burden of BPD based on key patient characteristics. 
Given the extreme cost burden at the earliest stage of life and lifetime 
negative impact on quality of life, there is larger headroom for investment in 
prevention and mitigation of severe BPD than is currently available.

How lifespan and the rate of aging are set is a key problem in biology. Small 
RNAs are conserved molecules that impact diverse biological processes through 
the control of gene expression. However, in contrast to miRNAs, the role of 
endo-siRNAs in aging remains unexplored. Here, by combining deep sequencing and 
genomic and genetic approaches in Caenorhabditis elegans, we reveal an 
unprecedented role for endo-siRNA molecules in the maintenance of proteostasis 
and lifespan extension in germline-less animals. Furthermore, we identify an 
endo-siRNA-regulated tyrosine phosphatase, which limits the longevity of 
germline-less animals by restricting the activity of the heat shock 
transcription factor HSF-1. Altogether, our findings point to endo-siRNAs as a 
link between germline removal and the HSF-1 proteostasis and longevity-promoting 
somatic pathway. This establishes a role for endo siRNAs in the aging process 
and identifies downstream genes and physiological processes that are regulated 
by the endo siRNAs to affect longevity.

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder caused by mutations of the 
FBN1 gene encoding fibrillin-1, which leads to overexpression of transforming 
growth factor-β, increased hyaluronan deposition, and matrix metalloproteinase 
activity in the media of the aorta and other muscular arteries. Marfan syndrome 
patients present with connective tissue laxity and aneurysmal changes to 
muscular arteries. Successful medical and surgical intervention has prolonged 
the life expectancy of MFS patients, which can allow atypical presentations of 
the syndrome to manifest. We present a case of a 49-year-old man with MFS who 
developed an ulnar artery aneurysm that was treated by excision and vein 
grafting.

BACKGROUND: New developments in medications for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) 
can be of great benefit to patients, but unfortunately these medicines also 
increase expenditures. Cost-utility analyses (CUAs) are needed to allocate 
health resources properly, and health utility values are required to calculate 
quality-adjusted life years in those CUAs.
OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to measure health utility values for 
several MBC-related health states and certain breast cancer treatment-related 
grade 3/4 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). In addition, we examined whether 
different methods and respondents' characteristics would influence the utility 
values elicited.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. The visual analogue scale (VAS) 
and time trade-off (TTO) methods were used to measure health utilities. Four MBC 
and nine ADR health states were selected for evaluation based on literature 
review and expert opinion. Information about respondents' demographic and 
clinical characteristics were collected to examine the relationship between 
utilities and participant characteristics.
RESULTS: A total of 102 patients participated in this study. The TTO-elicited 
values were higher than the VAS-derived scores except for two MBC-related health 
states. Among the MBC health states assessed, the TTO preference score ranged 
from 0.04 (palliative MBC) to 0.62 (responding MBC). For grade 3/4 ADRs, the 
mean TTO-derived utility values ranged from 0.35 (nausea/vomiting) to 0.79 
(fatigue). The ranking of the preference scores derived from the VAS was similar 
to that of the TTO-elicited scores.
CONCLUSION: This study obtained health state utility values for MBC and grade 
3/4 ADRs using both the TTO and the VAS, which provides useful data for future 
CUAs.

BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy worldwide means more people will develop 
dementia. Despite the rapid growth in older Bangladeshi immigrants living in the 
UK, there is little evidence of how community members understand and view the 
process of ageing and dementia. However, Bangladeshis have a higher risk of 
developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease, both of which are important 
indicators of dementia development in old age. This study aimed to explore and 
analyse the perception and knowledge of, and attitudes towards, ageing and 
dementia among the Bangladeshi community.
METHODS: A qualitative research approach guided two separate focus group 
discussions held with Bangladeshi adults in Portsmouth, UK. A topic guide was 
used alongside two vignettes depicting either early- or late-stage dementia to 
stimulate discussion. The data were recorded, transcribed, and analysed 
thematically using NVivo qualitative software.
RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: (1) knowledge and perceptions of dementia; 
(2) perceived causes of dementia; and (3) perceptions of stigma about dementia. 
Lack of knowledge and understanding of dementia was evident, but the stigma 
about dementia was non-existent. This study fills a research gap by providing 
qualitative research examining knowledge about and attitudes towards dementia 
among a Bangladeshi community in England.
CONCLUSION: Future research must highlight the importance of raising dementia 
awareness among, and providing information about dementia caregiving to, 
Bangladeshi community members, as well as providing religiously sensitive 
healthcare services.

It is widely acknowledged that in order to promote public health and prevent 
diseases, a wide range of scientific disciplines and sectors beyond the health 
sector need to be involved. Evidence-based interventions, beyond preventive 
health interventions targeting disease risk factors and interventions from other 
sectors, should be developed and implemented. Investing in these preventive 
health policies is challenging as budgets have to compete with other 
governmental expenditures. The current study aimed to identify, compare and rank 
cost-effective preventive interventions targeting metabolic, environmental, 
occupational and behavioral risk factors. To identify these interventions, a 
literature search was performed including original full economic evaluations of 
Western country interventions that had not yet been implemented in the 
Netherlands. Several workshops were held with experts from different 
disciplines. In total, 51 different interventions (including 13 cost saving 
interventions) were identified and ranked based on their incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and potential averted disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs), resulting in two rankings of the most cost-effective 
interventions and one ranking of the 13 cost saving interventions. This 
approach, resulting in an intersectoral ranking, can assist policy makers in 
implementing cost-effective preventive action that considers not only the health 
sector, but also other sectors.

This paper examines the impact of trade openness and foreign direct investment 
(FDI) on life expectancy using time series data over the period of 1972-2013. We 
have applied structural break unit root as well as cointegration tests to 
examine integrating properties of the variables and cointegration among the 
variables. The causal linkage between the variables has been tested by applying 
the VECM Granger causality. The empirical evidence confirms the presence of
