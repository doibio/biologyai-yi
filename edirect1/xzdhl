INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy is a public health metric used to assess 
mortality. We describe life expectancy calculations for US counties and present 
methodologic considerations compared with years of potential life lost before 
age 75 (YPLL-75) and premature age-adjusted mortality (PAAM), 2 commonly used 
length-of-life metrics.
METHODS: We used death data from the National Center for Health Statistics for 
2015-2017 and other health measures from the 2019 County Health Rankings & 
Roadmaps. We calculated life expectancy from birth at the county level using an 
abridged life table and the Chiang method of variance. Studentized residuals 
identified counties with discordant life expectancy and YPLL-75 or PAAM values. 
Correlations tested associations of life expectancy with key health measures 
(eg, smoking, child poverty, uninsured).
RESULTS: Among 3073 US counties, life expectancy ranged from 62.4 to 98.0 years, 
with a mean of 77.4 years. Life expectancy was strongly and negatively 
correlated with YPLL-75 (r = -0.91) and PAAM (r = -0.95) at the county level. 
Life expectancy was also associated with other key health metrics, such as 
smoking, employment, and education rates, where an improvement in the health 
factor indicated improvement in the respective length-of-life measure. Counties 
with discordant life expectancy and YPLL-75 or PAAM values had differing age 
structures.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Commonly used length-of-life metrics in population health 
settings are differentiated by methodological matters, such as computation 
complexity, data availability, and differential risk among age groups, 
especially among the very old or very young. The choice of metric should 
consider these factors, in addition to practical concerns, such as the 
communication needs of the audience.

Seafood is a highly perishable food product due to microbiological, chemical, 
and enzymatic reactions, which are the principal causes of their rapid quality 
deterioration. Therefore, ever-increasing consumers' demand for high-quality 
seafood along with a negative perception of synthetic preservatives creates 
opportunities for natural preservatives such as microalgae extracts. They are 
potential alternatives to reduce microbial growth, increase oxidative stability, 
and protect the sensorial properties of seafood. Research has shown that the 
inclusion of microalgae extracts into the aquatic animal's diet could enhance 
their meat quality and increase production. This review focuses on the direct 
application of various microalgae extracts as seafood preservative, and their 
functional properties in seafood, such as antioxidant and antimicrobial 
activities. Besides, the potential nutritional application of microalgae 
extracts as an alternative in aqua-feed and their impact on seafood quality 
(indirect application) are also presented. The safety aspects and regulatory 
issues of products from microalgae are highlighted.

BACKGROUND: Chile has one of the longest life expectancies of Latin America. The 
country is characterised by an important macroeconomic growth and persisting 
socioeconomic inequalities. This study analyses socioeconomic differences in 
life expectancy (LE) and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) among Chilean 
older people.
METHODS: The sample of the Social Protection Survey, a longitudinal study, was 
analysed. Five waves, from 2004 to 2016, were considered. The indicator was 
disability, defined as having difficulties to perform at least one basic 
activity of daily living. Type of health insurance was used to determine 
socioeconomic position (SEP). Total LE and DFLE were estimated with multistate 
life table models.
RESULTS: At age 60, men in the higher SEP could expect to live 3.7 years longer 
(22.2; 95% CI 19.6-24.8) compared to men of the same age in the medium SEP 
(18.4; 95% CI 17.4-19.4), and 4.9 years longer than men of the same age in the 
lower SEP (17.3; 95% CI 16.4-18.2). They also had a DFLE (19.4; 95% CI 
17.1-21.7) 4 (15.4; 95% CI 14.6-16.1) and 5.2 (14.2; 95% CI 13.4-14.9) years 
longer, compared to the same groups. Women aged 60 years in the higher SEP had a 
LE (27.2; 95% CI 23.7-30.8) 4.6 (22.7; 95% CI 21.9-23.5) and 5.6 (21.6; 
20.6-22.6) years longer, compared to women in the medium and the lower SEP. The 
difference in DFLE, for the same age and groups was 4.9 and 6.1 years, 
respectively (high: 21.4; 95% CI 19.5-23.3; medium: 16.5; 95% CI 15.8-17.1; low: 
15.3; 95% CI 14.6-16.0). Socioeconomic differences in LE and DFLE were observed 
among both sexes until advanced age.
DISCUSSION: Socioeconomic inequalities in LE and DFLE were found among Chilean 
older men and women. Older people in the highest SEP live longer and healthier 
lives.
CONCLUSION: A reform to the Chilean health system should be considered, in order 
to guarantee timely access to care and benefits for older people who are not in 
the wealthiest group.

BACKGROUND: Many pregnant people find no bridge to ongoing specialty or primary 
care after giving birth, even when clinical and social complications of 
pregnancy signal need. Black, indigenous, and all other women of color are 
especially harmed by fragmented care and access disparities, coupled with 
impacts of racism over the life course and in health care.
METHODS: We launched the initiative "Bridging the Chasm between Pregnancy and 
Health across the Life Course" in 2018, bringing together patients, advocates, 
providers, researchers, policymakers, and systems innovators to create a 
National Agenda for Research and Action. We held a 2-day conference that blended 
storytelling, evidence analysis, and consensus building to identify key themes 
related to gaps in care and root causes of inequities. In 2019, more than 70 
stakeholders joined six working groups to reach consensus on strategic 
priorities based on equity, innovation, effectiveness, and feasibility.
FINDINGS: Working groups identified six key strategic areas for bridging the 
chasm. These include: 1) progress toward eliminating institutional and 
interpersonal racism and bias as a requirement for accreditation of health care 
institutions, 2) infrastructure support for community-based organizations, 3) 
extension of holistic team-based care to the postpartum year and beyond, with 
integration of doulas and community health workers on the team, 4) extension of 
Medicaid coverage and new quality and pay-for-performance metrics to link 
maternity care and primary care, 5) systems to preserve maternal narratives and 
data across providers, and 6) alignment of research with women's lived 
experiences.
CONCLUSIONS: The resulting agenda presents a path forward to remedy the 
structural chasms in women's health care, with key roles for advocates, 
policymakers, researchers, health care leaders, educators, and the media.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare, invariably fatal 
childhood premature aging disorder caused by a pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing 
defect in the LMNA gene. We used combined in vitro screening and in vivo 
validation to systematically explore the effects of target sequence, backbone 
chemistry and mechanism of action to identify optimized antisense 
oligonucleotides (ASOs) for therapeutic use in HGPS. In a library of 198 ASOs, 
the most potent ASOs targeted the LMNA exon 12 junction and acted via non-RNase 
H-mediated mechanisms. Treatment with an optimized lead candidate resulted in 
extension of lifespan in a mouse model of HGPS. Progerin mRNA levels were 
robustly reduced in vivo, but the extent of progerin protein reduction differed 
between tissues, suggesting a long half-life and tissue-specific turnover of 
progerin in vivo. These results identify a novel therapeutic agent for HGPS and 
provide insight into the HGPS disease mechanism.

The members of the avidin protein family are well known for their high affinity 
towards d-biotin and their structural stability. These properties make avidins a 
valuable tool for various biotechnological applications. In the present study, 
two avidin-like biotin-binding proteins (named streptavidin C1 and C2) from 
Streptomyces cinnamonensis were newly identified while exploring antifungal 
proteins against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum. Streptavidin C1 reveals 
a low correlation (a sequence identity of approximately 64%) with all known 
streptavidins, whereas streptavidin C2 shares a sequence identity of 
approximately 94% with other streptavidins. Here, the crystal structures of 
streptavidin C1 in the mature form and in complex with biotin at 2.1 and 2.5 Å 
resolution, respectively, were assessed. The overall structures present similar 
tetrameric features with D 2 symmetry to other (strept)avidin structures. 
Interestingly, the long C-terminal region comprises a short α-helix (C-Lid; 
residues 169-179) and an extension C-terminal peptide (ECP; residues 180-191) 
which stretches into the biotin-binding sites of the same monomer. This ECP 
sequence (-180VTSANPPAS188-) is a newly defined biotin-binding site, which 
reduces the ability to bind to (strept)avidin family proteins. The novel 
streptavidin C1 could help in the development of an engineered tetrameric 
streptavidin with reduced biotin-binding capacity as well as other biomaterial 
tools.

Heart transplantation has extended the lives of many patients with end-stage 
heart failure. Although beset with the arduous aftermaths of immunosuppression, 
those who survived live meaningful lives similar to that of the general 
population. In this series, heart transplantation has led to a considerable 
extension of life span of >31-34 years. Development of cardiac allograft 
vasculopathy is a major concern in the long-term follow-up of transplant 
patients. Immunosuppressive drugs have a major impact on the development and 
progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy and the main cause of cardiac 
allograft loss after the first post-transplantation year. Post-transplant 
neoplasia remains a challenging long-term problem for patients after orthotopic 
heart transplantation. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease appears to be 
largely the result of the effectiveness of current agents used for long-term 
immunosuppression, and the neoplasms typically harbor the Epstein Barr virus 
genome, which is presumed to play a major role in neoplastic transformation. 
Post-transplantation, new diseases may occur or there may be worsening of 
pre-existing diseases. By the end of the 5th year, all suffered from 
hypertension. Renal insufficiency developed within 5 years after 
transplantation, and 10% have a creatinine value of >2.5 mg/dL. Hyperlipidemia, 
mostly hypercholesterolemia occurs especially in patients on tacrolimus or 
everolimus. Quality of life is not impaired despite somatic problems. In this 
period >31 years post-post-orthotopic heart transplantation, they even reported 
a surprising increase in their emotional well-being. The 10 patients are active 
and satisfied with their daily lives. They regard their own life as meaningful, 
have good families and active social relations. Nonetheless, it is burdened by 
chronic allograft vasculopathy and immunosuppression sequelae, the main limiting 
factors for survival, which needed to be constantly addressed throughout their 
lifetime. This brief report provides an insight into the challenges and burden 
patients living >31 years with transplanted hearts are confronted with.

BACKGROUND: Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have a growing and largely 
unaddressed neurosurgical burden. Cambodia has been an understudied country 
regarding the neurosurgical pathologies and case volume. Rapid infrastructure 
development with noncompliance of safety regulations has led to increased 
numbers of traumatic injuries. This study examines the neurosurgical caseload 
and pathologies of a single government institution implementing the first 
residency program in an effort to understand the neurosurgical needs of this 
population.
METHODS: This is a longitudinal descriptive study of all neurosurgical 
admissions at the Department of Neurosurgery at Preah Kossamak Hospital (PKH), a 
major government hospital, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, between September 2013 and 
June 2018.
RESULTS: 5490 patients were admitted to PKH requiring neurosurgical evaluation 
and care. Most of these admissions were cranial injuries related to road traffic 
accidents primarily involving young men compared to women by approximately 4:1 
ratio. Spinal pathologies were more evenly distributed in age and gender, with 
younger demographics more commonly presenting with traumatic injuries, while the 
older with degenerative conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased attention and efforts over the past decade, 
Cambodia's neurosurgical burden mirrors that of other LMICs, with trauma 
affecting most patients either on the road or at the workplace. Currently, 
Cambodia has 34 neurosurgeons to address the growing burden of a country of 15 
million with an increasing life expectancy of 69 years of age, stressing the 
importance of better public health policies and urgency for building capacity 
for safe and affordable neurosurgical care.

BACKGROUND: Human capital is an effective variable on the health condition of a 
society and its changing changes health expenditure as the proxy of health. This 
study aimed to investigate the relationship between human capital determinants 
and health expenditure.
METHODS: An empirical model was used with 7 variables included gender parity 
(GPI) index, literacy rate, life expectancy at birth, GDP per capita, physician 
per capita, and hospital's bed as the independent variable and health 
expenditure as depended variable. After unit root test of data by using 
Zivot-Andrews method, the model was estimated by ordinary least square (OLS) 
method.
RESULT: GPI had the negative and significant impact on health expenditure. 
Literacy had the positive and significant impact on depended variable. In 
addition, GDP per capita and life expectancy had positive and significant on 
health expenditure. Hospital bed and physician per capita did not have the 
significant relationship with health expenditure. The value of R-squared and 
Durbin-Watson statistic were 0.99 and 1.95 respectively, which showed good model 
fit.
CONCLUSION: literacy rate and GPI index as the proxy of human capital had the 
different impact on health expenditure. The first had positive and the latter 
had negative. GDP per capita had the positive impact that showed health was a 
normal good.

Background: COVID-19 is responsible for increasing deaths globally. As most 
people dying with COVID-19 are older with underlying long-term conditions 
(LTCs), some speculate that YLL are low. We aim to estimate YLL attributable to 
COVID-19, before and after adjustment for number/type of LTCs, using the limited 
data available early in the pandemic. Methods: We first estimated YLL from 
COVID-19 using WHO life tables, based on published age/sex data from COVID-19 
deaths in Italy. We then used aggregate data on number/type of LTCs in a 
Bayesian model to estimate likely combinations of LTCs among people dying with 
COVID-19. We used routine UK healthcare data from Scotland and Wales to estimate 
life expectancy based on age/sex/these combinations of LTCs using Gompertz 
models from which we then estimate YLL. Results: Using the standard WHO life 
tables, YLL per COVID-19 death was 14 for men and 12 for women. After adjustment 
for number and type of LTCs, the mean YLL was slightly lower, but remained high 
(11.6 and 9.4 years for men and women, respectively). The number and type of 
LTCs led to wide variability in the estimated YLL at a given age (e.g. at ≥80 
years, YLL was >10 years for people with 0 LTCs, and <3 years for people with 
≥6). Conclusions: Deaths from COVID-19 represent a substantial burden in terms 
of per-person YLL, more than a decade, even after adjusting for the typical 
number and type of LTCs found in people dying of COVID-19. The extent of 
multimorbidity heavily influences the estimated YLL at a given age. More 
comprehensive and standardised collection of data (including LTC type, severity, 
and potential confounders such as socioeconomic-deprivation and care-home 
status) is needed to optimise YLL estimates for specific populations, and to 
understand the global burden of COVID-19, and guide policy-making and 
interventions.

AIMS: To investigate secular trends in severe periodontitis incidence, 
prevalence and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates in China, India, 
Japan, South Korea and Thailand from 1990 to 2017.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the "Global Burden of Disease 
Study" 2017. The annual percentage change and average annual percentage change 
were calculated using Joinpoint regression analysis. The independent age, period 
and cohort effects were estimated by age-period-cohort analysis.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2017, the overall age-standardized incidence, prevalence 
and DALY rates increased in China, Japan and India, while decreasing in South 
Korea and Thailand. The highest incidence, prevalence and DALY rates were in 
India. By APC analysis, the age effect presented increase in 20-59 years in 
China, Japan and South Korea, 20-54 years in India and 20-64 years in Thailand; 
the period effect showed progressive increases in five countries, with the most 
significant increase shown in China; the cohort effect showed monotonic 
decreases with birth cohort in five countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe periodontitis poses a serious burden in Asian countries, 
especially China and India. We suggest raising people's awareness of periodontal 
health and providing professional interventions in these countries, especially 
for high-risk groups, such as younger people aged ≤65 years.

BACKGROUND: The aging process has great impact on body composition, such as the 
increase of adipose tissue in abdominal region, and the decrease of lean body 
mass, due to skeletal muscle loss. A reduction in muscle mass is associated to 
high risk of fractures and falls, loss of mobility, and increased number of 
hospitalizations. Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a biological 
substance derived from leucine metabolism, with anabolic and anticatabolic 
properties. Some HMB effects are tissue repair stimulation and protein 
anabolism.
AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the effects of HMB supplementation on body 
composition and muscle strength in elderly, as well as to identify the efficient 
dosages to reach these effects.
METHODS: This review included studies that evaluated muscle mass and muscle 
strength, associated or not with physical exercise and diet in elderly people. 
Only studies published from 2008 to 2019 were selected for analysis.
RESULTS: Six articles were included in the review. The used doses varied from 
1.5 to 3 g. In 5 studies, HMB supplementation was associated with calcium; only 
1 study did not use the oral administration route. Two studies used 4 g of 
maltodextrin as a vehicle; 1 used HMB with a hypercaloric and hyperproteic 
supplement; 1 associated HMB with lysine and arginine; and 1 with arginine and 
glutamine. Supplementation of 3 g of HMB has shown to be most beneficial in 
improving strength and body composition in people over 65 years, especially in 
bed rest and untrained conditions.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that HMB has a positive effect on body 
composition and strength, especially in bedridden or sedentary elderly, due to 
its anticatabolic properties.

BACKGROUND: Although included in surveillance programmes for colorectal cancer 
(CRC) metastases, elderly patients are susceptible to declines in health and 
quality of life that may render them unsuitable for further surveillance. 
Deciding when to cease surveillance is challenging.
METHODS: There are no publications focused on surveillance of elderly patients 
for CRC metastases. A systematic review of studies reporting treatment outcomes 
for CRC metastases in elderly patients was performed to assess the risk-benefit 
balance of the key objectives of surveillance; detecting and treating CRC 
metastases.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight eligible studies reported outcomes for surgery and 
chemotherapy in the elderly. Liver resections and use of chemotherapy, including 
biologics, are more conservative and have poorer outcomes in the elderly 
compared with younger patients. Selected studies demonstrated poorer 
quality-of-life (QoL) following surgery and chemotherapy. Studies of ablation in 
elderly patients are limited.
DISCUSSION: The survival benefit of treating CRC metastases with surgery or 
chemotherapy decreases with advancing age and QoL may decline in the elderly. 
The relatively lower efficacy and detrimental QoL impact of multimodal therapy 
options for detected CRC metastases in the elderly questions the benefit of 
surveillance in some elderly patients. Care of elderly patients should thus be 
customized based on their preference, formal geriatric assessment, natural 
life-expectancy, and the perceived risk-benefit balance of treating recurrent 
CRC metastases. Clinicians may consider surveillance cessation in patients aged 
75 years and above if geriatric assessment is unsatisfactory, patients decline 
surveillance, or patient fitness deteriorates catastrophically.

of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore, MD. Email: sgale@rx.umaryland.edu.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe disease with poor prognosis 
and shortened life expectancy. Treatment has traditionally involved the 
sequential use of endothelin receptor agonists, prostacyclin therapies, and 
nitric oxide pathway modulators, which each have distinct mechanisms of action 
leading to pulmonary vasodilation, and improvement in exercise capacity, 
hemodynamic measures, and clinical outcomes for patients with PAH. This article 
provides a review of goals of therapy in PAH, determinants of prognosis and 
levels of patient risk, and additional factors that guide treatment decision 
making. Recent research in combination therapies has created a paradigm shift in 
the treatment of PAH and will be reviewed. Additionally, recent updates to the 
American College of Chest Physicians guidelines will be reviewed along with the 
updated evidence-based treatment algorithm. Finally, trial data will be 
evaluated for the recently developed agent selexipag and improved treprostinil 
delivery formulations that may provide enhanced convenience.

Linkers that enable the site-selective synthesis of chemically modified proteins 
are of great interest to the field of chemical biology. Homogenous bioconjugates 
often show advantageous pharmacokinetic profiles and consequently increased 
efficacy in vivo. Cysteine residues have been exploited as a route to 
site-selectively modify proteins, and many successfully approved therapeutics 
make use of cysteine directed conjugation reagents. However, commonly used 
linkers, including maleimide-thiol conjugates, are not stable to the low 
concentrations of thiol present in blood. Furthermore, only a few 
cysteine-targeting reagents enable the site-selective attachment of multiple 
functionalities: a useful tool in the fields of theranostics and therapeutic 
blood half-life extension. Herein, we demonstrate the application of the 
pyridazinedione motif to enable site-selective attachment of three 
functionalities to a protein bearing a single cysteine residue. Extending upon 
previously documented dual modification work, here we demonstrate that by 
exploiting a bromide leaving group as an additional reactive point on the 
pyridazinedione scaffold, a thiol or aniline derivative can be added to a 
protein, post-conjugation. Thiol cleavability appraisal of the resultant C-S and 
C-N linked thio-bioconjugates demonstrated C-S functionalized linkers to be 
cleavable and C-N functionalized linkers to be noncleavable when incubated in an 
excess of glutathione. The plug-and-play trifunctional platform was exemplified 
by attaching clinically relevant motifs: biotin, fluorescein, a polyethylene 
glycol chain, and a model peptide. This platform provides a rare opportunity to 
combine up to three functionalities on a protein in a site-selective fashion. 
Furthermore, by selecting the use of a thiol or an amine for functionalization, 
we provide unique control over linker cleavability toward thiols, allowing this 
novel linker to be applied in a range of physiological environments.

The contribution of social participation to differences in life expectancy and 
healthy years among the older population: A comparison between Chile, Costa Rica 
and Spain.

We study the health trajectories of the population aged over 60, comparing 
between one European and two Latin American countries (Spain, Chile and Costa 
Rica) which have similar longevity patterns. Our focus is on functional 
limitation and mortality risks, considering differences by gender, education and 
social participation. Data come from national panel surveys (EPS, CRELES, 
SHARE). Multistate modelling is used to estimate transition probabilities 
between two health states: healthy to unhealthy, unhealthy to healthy as well as 
the transition to death from healthy or unhealthy states, to estimate the 
duration of stay in a specific state (computing healthy and unhealthy life 
expectancies) and the effect of the selected covariates. Results show that older 
Costa Ricans have the smallest gender gap in life expectancy but women have a 
lower healthy life expectancy compared to those in Chile and Spain. 
Participation in social activities leads to higher healthy life expectancy among 
the elderly in Costa Rica and Spain, whilst there were no relevant educational 
differences observed in longevity in the analysed countries. To conclude: 
despite the different patterns observed in health transitions and survival 
across the three countries, social participation is associated with greater 
health and longevity among people of old age, with little effect coming from 
educational attainment. Public policies should therefore be aimed at reducing 
unhealthy life years and dependency at advanced ages by promoting more 
engagement in social activities, especially among vulnerable groups who are more 
likely to experience impairment from a younger age.

Over the course of developing and applying a new real-time PCR assay for the 
detection of the newly described apple chlorotic fruit spot viroid (ACFSVd), 
slight modifications of the reverse transcription (RT) step were found to 
improve significantly the detection limit of the assay. To prove this 
hypothesis, three different one-step RT-qPCR kits for the detection of three 
plant viroids and three plant viruses were compared. The results showed both 
extension of the RT reaction time from 10 or 15 min-30 min or the increase in 
reaction temperature from 49 to 52 °C for the cDNA synthesis step results in a 
10 times higher sensitivity for potato spindle tuber viroid and apple scar skin 
viroid one-step RT-qPCR assay and 45 higher sensitivity for ACFSVd one-step 
RT-qPCR assay. No variation in the detection limit was observed when the 
modifications were tested on tomato brown rugose fruit virus, plum pox virus and 
tomato ringspot virus assays. This finding is highly valuable for the 
investigation of viroids in general and could contribute to enhance sensitivity 
in their detection and to benefit regulatory outcomes for national plant 
protection organisations.

As life expectancy improves and the number of people suffering from various 
diseases increases, the need for developing effective personalized disease 
models is rapidly rising. The development of organoid technology has led to 
better recapitulation of the in vivo environment of organs, and can overcome the 
constraints of existing disease models. However, for more precise disease 
modeling, engineering approaches such as microfluidics and biomaterials, that 
aid in mimicking human physiology, need to be integrated with the organoid 
models. In this review, we introduce key elements for disease modeling and 
recent engineering advances using both liver and lung organoids. Due to the 
importance of personalized medicine, we also emphasize patient-derived cancer 
organoid models and their engineering approaches. These organoid-based disease 
models combined with microfluidics, biomaterials, and co-culture systems will 
provide a powerful research platform for understanding disease mechanisms and 
developing precision medicine; enabling preclinical drug screening and drug 
development. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The development of organoid technology

Alzheimer's disease and dementia are common, highly disabling conditions 
frequently requiring residential care. This exploratory proof-of-concept study 
aimed to determine if the specialised Music Engagement Program (MEP) was 
sustainable, acceptable, and effective in improving quality of life, emotional 
wellbeing, and depression symptoms in this population. Sixteen residents, six 
staff members, and three family and community members took part in the 
evaluation of the MEP for people living with dementia in a residential aged-care 
nursing home in Canberra, Australia. Multiple methods were used. Quantitative 
evaluation assessed residents' depression symptoms (Cornell scale) at pre- and 
post-intervention, and emotional wellbeing pre- and post-session. Qualitative 
interviews with staff, and family and community members addressed the MEP's 
acceptability and potential sustainability. Results showed residents' mean 
depression scores were reduced from pre- to post-intervention (p = .039; dz = 
0.72). Interviews established multiple benefits for residents including improved 
mood, calmness, and reduced aggression. However, staff did not believe it was 
feasible to continue the MEP sessions beyond the trial period without an 
external facilitator, citing potential difficulties in adhering to internal 
activities due to time constraints. This pilot study provides encouraging 
preliminary evidence for the MEP's acceptability and potential effectiveness for 
improving depression and wellbeing in this group.
