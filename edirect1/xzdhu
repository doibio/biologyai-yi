The USA leads the world in healthcare spending but trails dozens of countries in 
life expectancy. Government spending may reduce overall mortality by 
redistributing resources from the rich to the poor. We linked mortality data 
from 2006 to 2015 to municipal and state government spending in 149 of the 
largest American cities. We modeled the association of mortality with city and 
state government spending per capita in 2005 using weighted linear regression. A 
10% increase in state government expenditures was associated (P = 0.008) with a 
1.4% (95%CI: 0.4-2.4%) reduction in mortality in American cities. Total city 
government expenditures were not associated with mortality (P > 0.10). However, 
among Whites, increases in city government spending were associated with a 
reduction in mortality of 4.8% (2.1-7.5%), but among Blacks and Asians, 
increased city government spending was associated with respective mortality 
increases of 1.7% (0.6-2.9%) and 5.1% (2.1-6.2%). State government spending is 
associated with reduced mortality in American cities. City government spending 
appears to benefit White longevity and hurt non-White longevity.

In this study, after washing, changes in the quality characteristics of chicken 
eggs coated with apricot, almond, and sour cherry tree resins were examined 
during two different temperatures (4 °C and 22 °C) storage for 60 days. While 
air cell height, weight loss, albumen and yolk pH and a* (redness) values 
increased in all samples during storage, Haugh unit, albumen and yolk index, 
shell fracture and vitelline membrane strength, albumen and yolk L* (lightness) 
and b* (yellowness) values decreased (P < 0.05). The lowest weight loss (0.54 g) 
and air cell height (2.89 mm), highest Haugh unit (73.95 HU), albumen index 
(8.81%), and yolk index (40.37%) were found in the samples coated with sour 
cherry wood resin stored at 4 °C. The shell breakage and vitelline membrane 
strength of the coated samples were determined to be higher than the control 
samples and the samples stored after washing. Higher weight loss, air cell 
height, and pH values, while lower Haugh unit, Albumen and yolk index were found 
in samples stored at 22 °C (P < 0.05). At the end of storage, the maximum 
increase in the counts of total aerobic mesophilic and psychrophilic bacteria 
was found in the albumin and egg yolk of washed samples stored at ambient 
temperature. As a result, the coating materials prepared with the resin of 
apricot, almond, and sour cherry trees were suitable for eggshell's shelf life 
extension. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The consumers demand the eggs be in their 
freshest condition, but the currently available storage conditions are not 
sufficient to maintain freshness in many regions of Turkey. The physical, 
chemical and, microbiological qualities of the eggs coated with wood resins were 
determined to be superior compared to other samples. Because resins have good 
barrier properties, it is recommended to conduct extensive studies on their 
applicability in different products.

PURPOSE: To explore the lived experiences of people ageing with neuromuscular 
disease (NMD).
INTRODUCTION: NMD refers to several chronic types of hereditary and progressive 
NMDs. Owing to advances in rehabilitation and treatment, life expectancy has 
increased for some subtypes, resulting in life continuing into adulthood and 
even old age; however, knowledge of people's lived experiences with NMD is 
sparse.
METHODS: A qualitative study using a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach 
inspired by Ricoeur was conducted. Fifteen persons with NMD were interviewed in 
2018. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) 
checklist was used.
RESULTS: Four themes were identified: "A time-framed paradox of striving for 
independent dependency arises as age increases", "Ageing means entering no man's 
land", "Exercising is caught between shrinking surplus of physical energy and 
demands of everyday life" and "Ending work life is a jumble of relief, concern 
and altered self-perception".
CONCLUSION: The pathway to old age with NMD encompasses several transitions, all 
potentially including the risk of getting lost. Physical changes, changes in 
legislation, experiences of uncertainty regarding where one socially belongs and 
how to balance reduced physical strength in everyday life are indicated as key 
areas that affect ageing life with NMD.Implications for 
rehabilitationRehabilitation professionals should address ageing with NMD from a 
life course perspective and not with a singled minded focus on chronological 
age.A biopsychosocial focus is needed to prevent gaps and pave the pathway to 
old age with NMD.The experiences of multiple transitions when ageing with NMD 
should be in focus.

BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis is a common treatment for patients with end-stage renal 
failure. Long-term hemodialysis will lead to a series of complications and 
reduce the quality of life of patients. At present, routine nursing is only 
limited to in-hospital patients, whereas continuous nursing is an extension of 
hospital nursing work, which can solve the follow-up health problems of some 
patients and meet the health needs of patients in their daily life. A number of 
clinical studies have shown that continuous nursing can improve the quality of 
life of hemodialysis patients, but there is a lack of evidence-based medicine. 
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the effect of continuous 
nursing on the quality of life of hemodialysis patients through systematic 
evaluation.
METHOD: The Cochrance Library, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, VP 
Information Chinese Journal Service Platform (VIP), and Wanfang will be searched 
by computer. In addition, Baidu academic and Google academic are searched 
manually, and all randomized controlled trials on the effects of continuous 
nursing on the quality of life of hemodialysis patients are collected. The 
retrieval time is of the establishment of the database to January 31, 2021. Two 
evaluators screens, extract and evaluate the literature, and the data are 
analyzed by RevMan5.3 software.
RESULT: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of continuous 
nursing on the quality of life of hemodialysis patients by the MOS item short 
from health survey, exercise of self-care agency, and the incidence of 
complications.
CONCLUSION: This study will provide reliable evidence for the application of 
continuous nursing in hemodialysis patients.

BACKGROUND: Standard influenza vaccines are produced using egg-based 
manufacturing methods. Through the process, the resulting egg-adapted viral 
strains may differ from the selected vaccine strain. Cell-derived influenza 
vaccine manufacturing prevents egg-adaptation of the antigen which can improve 
vaccine effectiveness. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent 
cell-derived influenza vaccine (QIVc) versus an egg-based quadrivalent influenza 
vaccine (QIVe) in preventing seasonal influenza from German societal and payer 
perspectives.
METHODS: Adapted version of the individual-based dynamic 4Flu transmission model 
was combined with a decision-tree to calculate the impact of QIVc versus QIVe on 
influenza over 20 seasons in Germany. Egg-adaptation, resulting in lower 
effectiveness of QIVe versus QIVc towards the H3N2 influenza strain, is sourced 
from a US retrospective study and assumed in 100% (base case) or 55% 
(conservative scenario) of years. Influenza-related probabilities of outpatient 
visits, hospitalizations, productivity loss, and mortality, with associated 
(dis)utilities/costs, were extracted from literature. Costs and outcomes were 
discounted 3.0%/year.
RESULTS: Replacing QIVe with QIVc in subjects aged ≥ 9 years can annually 
prevent 167,265 symptomatic cases, 51,114 outpatient visits, 2,091 
hospitalizations, and 103 deaths in Germany. The annual number of 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) increased by 1,628 and healthcare costs 
decreased by €178 M from societal perspective. From payer perspective, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €2,285 per QALY. Scenario analyses 
confirmed results robustness.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of QIVc compared to QIVe, in the German Immunization 
Program, could significantly prevent outpatient visits and hospitalizations and 
would enable substantial savings from a societal perspective.

BACKGROUND: To manage patellofemoral joint disorders, a complete understanding 
of the in vivo patellofemoral kinematics is critical. However, as one of the 
parameters of joint kinematics, the location and orientation of the 
patellofemoral finite helical axis (FHA) remains unclear. The purpose of this 
study is to quantify the location and orientation of the patellar FHA, both in 
vivo and non-invasively at various flexion angles, and evaluate the relationship 
of the FHA and the trans-epicondylar axis (TEA).
METHODS: The magnetic resonance (MR) images of 18 unilateral knees were 
collected at full extension, 30°, 60°, 90°, and maximum angle of knee flexion. 
Three-dimensional models of the knee joint at different flexion angles were 
created using the MR images, and then used to calculate the patellar tracking 
and FHA with a spline interpolation algorithm. By using a coordinate system 
based on the TEA, the FHA tracking was quantified. Six parameters concerning the 
location and orientation of the patellar FHA were analysed.
RESULTS: The average patellar FHA drew an L-shaped tracking on the midsagittal 
plane moving from the posteroinferior to the anterosuperior side of the TEA with 
knee flexion. Before 90° flexion, the patellar rotational radius decreased 
slightly, with an average value of 5.65 ± 1.09 cm. During 20° to 90° knee 
flexion, the average angle between the patellar FHA and the TEA was 
approximately 10° and that between the FHA and the coronal plane was maintained 
at about 0°, while that between the FHA and the level plane fluctuated between 
- 10° and 10°.
CONCLUSIONS: This study quantitatively reported the continuous location and 
direction of the patellar FHA during knee flexion. The patellar FHA was close to 
but not coincident with the femoral TEA both in location and orientation, and 
the patellar rotational radius decreased slightly with knee flexion. These 
findings could provide a clear direction for further studies on the difference 
in patellofemoral FHA among various types of patellofemoral disorders, and 
provide a foundation for the application of FHA in surgical evaluation, 
preoperative planning and prosthesis design, thereby assisting in the diagnosis 
and treatment of patellofemoral disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke 
often fails due to poor adherence among patients to evidence-based prevention 
recommendations. The proper formatting of messages portraying CVD and stroke 
risks and interventional benefits may promote individuals' perception and 
motivation, adherence to healthy plans and eventual success in achieving risk 
control. The main objective of this study is to determine whether risk and 
intervention communication strategies (gain-framed vs loss-framed and long-term 
vs short-term contexts) and potential interaction thereof have different effects 
on the optimisation of adherence to clinical preventive management for the 
endpoint of CVD risk reduction among subjects with at least one CVD risk factor.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This trial is designed as a 2×2 factorial, 
observer-blinded multicentre randomised controlled study with four parallel 
groups. Trial participants are aged 45-80 years and have at least one CVD risk 
factor. Based on sample size calculations for primary outcome, we plan to enrol 
15 000 participants. Data collection will occur at baseline, 6 months and 1 year 
after randomisation. The primary outcomes are changes in the estimated 10-year 
CVD risk, estimated lifetime CVD risk and estimated CVD-free life expectancy 
from baseline to the 1-year follow-up.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study received approval from the Ethical 
Committee of West China Hospital, Sichuan University and will be disseminated 
via peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

The ethics and politics of addressing health inequalities.

Practice, Leeds, UK medsbra@leeds.ac.uk.

Social determinants of health are responsible for a large proportion of disease 
which disproportionately affects deprived population groups, resulting in 
striking disparities in life expectancy and quality of life. Even systems with 
universal access to healthcare (such as the UK's NHS) can only mitigate some 
consequences of health inequalities. Instead substantial societal measures are 
required both to reduce harmful exposures and to improve standards of housing, 
education, work, nutrition and exercise. The case for such measures is widely 
accepted among healthcare professionals but, in wider discourse, scepticism has 
remained about the role of government and society in improving life chances 
along with the belief that responsibility for health and wellbeing should rest 
with individuals themselves. The stark inequalities exposed by the coronavirus 
pandemic could be an opportunity to challenge this thinking. This paper argues 
that doctors should do more to persuade others of the need to address health 
inequalities and that to achieve this, it is important to understand the ethical 
and philosophical perspectives that are sceptical of such measures. An approach 
to gaining greater support for interventions to address health inequalities is 
presented along with reflections on effective political advocacy which is 
consistent with physicians' professional values.

The incidence of thyroid carcinoma has been increasing worldwide. This is 
interpreted as an increase in the incidental detection of papillary thyroid 
microcarcinomas (PTMCs). However, mortality has not changed, suggesting 
overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Prospective clinical trials of active 
surveillance for low-risk PTMC (T1aN0M0) have been conducted in two Japanese 
institutions since the 1990s. Based on the favorable outcomes of these trials, 
active surveillance has been gradually adopted worldwide. A task force on the 
management of PTMC in adults organized by the Japan Thyroid Association 
therefore conducted a systematic review and has produced the present position 
paper based on the scientific evidence concerning active surveillance. This 
paper indicates evidence for the increased incidence of PTMC, favorable surgical 
outcomes for low-risk PTMC, recommended criteria for diagnosis using fine needle 
aspiration cytology, and evaluation of lymph node metastasis (LNM), 
extrathyroidal extension (ETE) and distant metastasis. Active surveillance has 
also been reported with a low incidence of disease progression and no subsequent 
recurrence or adverse events on survival if conversion surgery was performed at 
a slightly advanced stage. Active surveillance is a safe and valid strategy for 
PTMC, because it might preserve physical quality of life and reduce 10-year 
medical costs. However, some points should be noted when performing active 
surveillance. Immediate surgery is needed for PTMC showing high-risk features, 
such as clinical LNM, ETE or distant metastasis. Active surveillance should be 
performed under an appropriate medical team and should be continued for life.

After four decades of China's family planning policy, the shrinking family size 
and increasing life expectancy pose special challenges for the one-child 
generation in terms of providing care for aging parents. The current study 
explored young adults' responses to such pressure by examining their concerns 
about elder care, attitudes toward nursing homes, and living arrangement after 
marriage in a sample of 473 Chinese working young adults from six cities in 
China (46.9% males, Mage = 25.1 years, 47.8% only children). Results showed that 
although most of the young adults reported to have thought about the issue of 
parents' elder care, the majority did not worry a lot about it. Only children 
expressed similar levels of worrying as those with siblings did. However, 
educational level, rather than sibling status, was systematically related to 
concerns about parents' elder care and attitudes toward nursing homes. People 
with higher education tended to worry less about elder care, and were less 
likely to consider placing parents in nursing homes as a violation of filial 
piety. Analyses of the married sub-sample (n = 140) revealed that only children 
were more likely to co-reside with parents after marriage than those with 
siblings. And the main reason for co-residence was that the younger generation 
needed their parents' help for childcare, rather than to better take care of 
their parents. Implications for parents' elder care among Chinese only children 
were discussed.

LESSONS LEARNED: The use of sodium levofolinate (Na-Lev) is safe in combination 
with continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil in patients with gastrointestinal tumors 
treated with the FOLFIRI regimen. A comparison with calcium levofolinate 
(Ca-Lev) showed a similar toxicity profile. The advantages of Na-Lev over Ca-Lev 
might be the faster drug preparation and the shorter time of drug 
administration.
BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to compare the safety profiles of 
sodium levofolinate (Na-Lev) and calcium levofolinate (Ca-Lev) in combination 
with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the FOLFIRI regimen and to measure the 
organizational impact of the introduction of Na-Lev on drug production and 
administration.
METHODS: The study opened in November 2015 and closed in August 2019. Patients 
with gastrointestinal cancers who were candidates for treatment with the FOLFIRI 
regimen were included in this nonrandomized study. Age ≥18 years, life 
expectancy >3 months, adequate bone marrow reserve, adequate hepatic and renal 
function, and an ECOG performance status of 0-2 were required. Patients in the 
Ca-Lev arm received a 2-hour infusion of Ca-Lev followed by 5-FU, whereas those 
in the Na-Lev arm received Na-Lev and 5-FU administered in a single 48-hour 
pump.
RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled, 30 in each arm. Patient characteristics 
were balanced. Grade (G)1-2 adverse events occurred in 18 (60.0%) and 19 (63.4%) 
patients of Na-Lev and Ca-Lev cohorts, respectively, whereas G3-4 adverse events 
occurred in 12 (40.0%) and 11 (36.6%) patients, respectively. The use of Na-Lev 
enabled us to save approximately 13 minutes for drug preparation and 2 hours for 
treatment administration, per patient per cycle.
CONCLUSION: Na-Lev showed a reassuring toxicity profile and a favorable impact 
on drug preparation and administration.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of secretion machinery proteins is a crucial regulatory 
mechanism for exocytosis. However, the participation of protein tyrosine 
phosphatases (PTPs) in different exocytosis stages has not been defined. Here we 
demonstrate that PTP-MEG2 controls multiple steps of catecholamine secretion. 
Biochemical and crystallographic analyses reveal key residues that govern the 
interaction between PTP-MEG2 and its substrate, a peptide containing the 
phosphorylated NSF-pY83 site, specify PTP-MEG2 substrate selectivity, and 
modulate the fusion of catecholamine-containing vesicles. Unexpectedly, 
delineation of PTP-MEG2 mutants along with the NSF binding interface reveals 
that PTP-MEG2 controls the fusion pore opening through NSF independent 
mechanisms. Utilizing bioinformatics search and biochemical and electrochemical 
screening approaches, we uncover that PTP-MEG2 regulates the opening and 
extension of the fusion pore by dephosphorylating the DYNAMIN2-pY125 and 
MUNC18-1-pY145 sites. Further structural and biochemical analyses confirmed the 
interaction of PTP-MEG2 with MUNC18-1-pY145 or DYNAMIN2-pY125 through a distinct 
structural basis compared with that of the NSF-pY83 site. Our studies thus 
provide mechanistic insights in complex exocytosis processes.

BACKGROUND: The Fracture Screening and Prevention Program (FSPP), a fracture 
liaison service (FLS), was implemented in the province of Ontario, Canada, in 
2007 to prevent recurrent fragility fractures and to improve post-fracture care. 
The objective of this analysis was to determine the cost-effectiveness of the 
current model of the FSPP compared with usual care (no program) from the 
perspective of the universal public health-care payer (Ontario Ministry of 
Health and Long-Term Care [MOHLTC]), over the lifetime of older adults who 
presented with a fragility fracture of the proximal part of the femur, the 
proximal part of the humerus, or the distal part of the radius and were not 
taking medications to prevent or slow bone loss and reduce the risk of fracture 
(bone active medications).
METHODS: We developed a state-transition (Markov) model to conduct a 
cost-effectiveness analysis of the FSPP in comparison with usual care. The model 
simulated a cohort of patients with a fragility fracture starting at 71 years of 
age. Model parameters were obtained from published literature and from the FSPP. 
Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs in 2018 Canadian dollars were 
predicted over a lifetime horizon using a 1.5% annual discount rate. Health 
outcomes included subsequent proximal femoral, vertebral, proximal humeral, and 
distal radial fractures. Scenario and subgroup analyses were reported.
RESULTS: The FSPP had lower expected costs ($277 less) and higher expected 
effectiveness (by 0.018 QALY) than usual care over the lifetime horizon. 
Ninety-four percent of the 10,000 Monte Carlo simulated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) demonstrated lower costs and higher 
effectiveness of the FSPP.
CONCLUSIONS: The FSPP appears to be cost-effective compared with usual care over 
a lifetime for patients with fragility fracture. This information may help to 
quantify the value of the FSPP and to assist policy-makers in deciding whether 
to expand the FSPP to additional hospitals or to initiate similar programs where 
none exist.

BACKGROUND: Identifying pain-related response patterns and understanding 
functional mechanisms of symptom formation and recovery are important for 
improving treatment.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to replicate pain-related avoidance-endurance response 
patterns associated with the Fear-Avoidance Model, and its extension, the 
Avoidance-Endurance Model, and examined their differences in secondary measures 
of stress, action control (i.e., dispositional action vs. state orientation), 
coping, and health.
METHODS: Latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted on self-report data from 
536 patients with chronic non-specific low back pain at the beginning of an 
inpatient rehabilitation program. Measures of stress (i.e., pain, life stress) 
and action control were analyzed as covariates regarding their influence on the 
formation of different pain response profiles. Measures of coping and health 
were examined as dependent variables.
RESULTS: Partially in line with our assumptions, we found three pain response 
profiles of distress-avoidance, eustress-endurance, and low-endurance responses 
that are depending on the level of perceived stress and action control. 
Distress-avoidance responders emerged as the most burdened, dysfunctional 
patient group concerning measures of stress, action control, maladaptive coping, 
and health. Eustress-endurance responders showed one of the highest levels of 
action versus state orientation, as well as the highest levels of adaptive 
coping and physical activity. Low-endurance responders reported lower levels of 
stress as well as equal levels of action versus state orientation, maladaptive 
coping, and health compared to eustress-endurance responders; however, equally 
low levels of adaptive coping and physical activity compared to 
distress-avoidance responders.
CONCLUSIONS: Apart from the partially supported assumptions of the 
Fear-Avoidance and Avoidance-Endurance Model, perceived stress and dispositional 
action versus state orientation may play a crucial role in the formation of 
pain-related avoidance-endurance response patterns that vary in degree of 
adaptiveness. Results suggest tailoring interventions based on behavioral and 
functional analysis of pain responses in order to more effectively improve 
patients quality of life.

Prostate cancer differently affects different regions of the world, displaying 
higher rates in more developed areas. After the implementation of 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, several studies described rising rates 
globally, but it is possible that indolent lesions are being detected given the 
lack of changes in mortality data. The Brazilian government recommends against 
PSA screening in the male population regardless of age, but the Urology Society 
issued a report recommending that screening should start at 50 years old for 
certain men and for those aged ≥75 years with a life expectancy exceeding 10 
years. In this study, we examined the incidence and mortality rates of invasive 
prostate cancer over time in the Sergipe state of Brazil. The databases of the 
Aracaju Cancer Registry and Mortality Information System were used to calculate 
age-standardized rates for all prostate tumors (International Classification of 
Diseases 10th edition: C61 and D07.5) in the following age ranges: 20-44, 45-54, 
and ≥65 years. We identified 3595 cases of cancer, 30 glandular intraepithelial 
high-grade lesions, and 3269 deaths. Using the Joinpoint Regression Program, we 
found that the incidence of prostate cancer dramatically increased over time 
until the mid-2000s for all age groups, after which the rates declined. Prostate 
cancer mortality rates increased until 2005, followed by a non-significant 
annual percent change of 22.0 in 2001-2005 and a stable rate thereafter. We 
noticed that the increases and decreases of the incidence rates of prostate 
cancer were associated with the screening recommendations. Meanwhile, the 
increased mortality rates did not appear to be associated with decreased PSA 
testing; instead, they were linked to the effects of age and improvements in 
identification of the cause of death. Thus, we do not believe a PSA screening 
program would benefit the population of this study.

In insect-pollinated crops, gene flow is affected by numerous factors including 
crop characteristics, mating system, life history, pollinators, and planting 
management practices. Previous studies have concentrated on the impact of 
distance between genetically engineered (GE) and conventional fields on 
adventitious presence (AP) which represents the unwanted presence of a GE gene. 
Variables other than distance, however, may affect AP. In addition, some AP is 
often present in the parent seed lots used to establish conventional fields. To 
identify variables that influence the proportion of AP in conventional alfalfa 
fields, we performed variable selection regression analyses. Analyses based on a 
sample-level and a field-level analysis gave similar, though not identical 
results. For the sample-level model, distance from the GE field explained 66% of 
the variance in AP, confirming its importance in affecting AP. The area of GE 
fields within the pollinator foraging range explained an additional 30% of the 
variation in AP in the model. The density of alfalfa leafcutting bee domiciles 
influenced AP in both models. To minimize AP in conventional alfalfa seed 
fields, management practices should focus on optimizing isolation distances 
while also considering the size of the GE pollen pool within the pollinator 
foraging range, and the foraging behavior of pollinators.

INTRODUCTION: Sjögren's syndrome (SjS) causes malfunction of the salivary and 
lacrimal glands. Consequently, patients suffer from xerostomia and 
keratoconjunctivitis sicca. This can further affect the voice and swallowing 
function resulting in an impaired quality of life. Aim of this study is the 
systematic evaluation of the impact on voice and swallowing-related quality of 
life in patients with SjS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: SjS patients were classified according to the 
American-European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria; antibodies to Ro (SS-A) or La 
(SS-B) antigens were detected, ESSPRI was completed. We used the following 
quality of life questionnaires: EORTC QLQ H&N 35, Anderson Dysphagia Inventory 
(ADI) and Voice Handicap Index (VHI). Patients additionally received a detailed 
phoniatric examination (auditory perception, videostroboscopy, acoustic 
analysis, Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI), aerodynamics measurements).
RESULTS: Almost all the 54 patients (96.3%) had a limited quality of life due to 
their swallowing problems and 48% due to their voice problems. Both values 
correlated significantly with the degree of xerostomia. In the phoniatric 
examination, 77.8% had an increased DSI and two-thirds had abnormalities in 
videostroboscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: A reasonable impairment of quality of life in patients with SjS due 
to the limitations in voice and swallowing function was observed. As SjS does 
not limitate life expectancy, preservation of quality of life is important. 
Detection of voice and swallowing problems as potential reasons for quality of 
life impairment should be detected and, if diagnosed, treated accordingly.

BACKGROUND: During the German division, two culturally very similar populations 
were exposed to very disparate socioeconomic conditions, which converged again 
after 1989. The impact of healthcare and life circumstances on mortality 
differences can better be estimated when cultural explanations are widely 
neglectable.
OBJECTIVES: For the first time, we analyse harmonised cause-of-death data 
explicitly by age. Hereby, we can show which ages or birth cohorts were 
particularly affected by German division and reunification in their mortality 
and to which causes of death this is attributable.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We harmonised the German cause-of-death statistics by 
applying an internationally standardised harmonisation process to account for 
differences and breaks in cause-of-death coding practices. We analysed the data 
using decomposition methods.
RESULTS: During the 1980s, east-west disparities were increasing as progress in 
the reduction of cardiovascular mortality was much stronger in West Germany, 
notably at older ages. After 1989, East Germany was able to catch up to the west 
in many areas. This is especially true for elderly persons and women, while 
east-west disparities are still visible today, particularly among male adult 
cohorts (1950-1970) strongly affected by the East German transition crisis.
CONCLUSIONS: The lower life expectancy of the East German population in the late 
1980s was primarily caused by a slower pace of the cardiovascular revolution. 
The remaining present-day disparities are rather an aftermath of the East German 
transition crisis than direct aftereffects of the division.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Durch die deutsche Teilung wurden 2 
kulturell sehr ähnliche Bevölkerungen sehr unterschiedlichen sozioökonomischen 
Bedingungen ausgesetzt, die sich nach 1989 wieder anglichen. Der Einfluss von 
Gesundheitsversorgung und Lebensumständen auf Sterblichkeitsunterschiede kann 
besser erfasst werden, wenn kulturelle Erklärungen weitgehend ausgeblendet 
werden können.
ZIEL DER ARBEIT: Die Arbeit wertet harmonisierte Todesursachendaten erstmals 
detailliert nach Alter aus. Hierdurch kann aufgezeigt werden, welche Alter bzw. 
Geburtsjahrgänge besonders stark durch die deutsche Teilung und 
Wiedervereinigung in ihrer Mortalität beeinflusst wurden und auf welche 
Todesursachen dies zurückzuführen ist.
MATERIAL UND METHODEN: Die deutschen Todesursachenstatistiken wurden einem 
international standardisierten Harmonisierungsverfahren unterzogen, um 
Unterschieden und Brüchen in der Todesursachencodierung Rechnung zu tragen. Die 
Daten wurden mit Dekompositionsmethoden analysiert.
ERGEBNISSE: In den 1980er-Jahren stiegen die Ost-West-Unterschiede stark an, da 
Westdeutschland gerade in höheren Altern deutlich höhere Rückgänge bei der 
kardiovaskulären Mortalität erzielen konnte. Nach 1989 konnte Ostdeutschland in 
vielen Bereichen zum Westen aufholen. Dies gilt besonders für ältere Personen 
und Frauen, während gerade bei den stark von der ostdeutschen 
Transformationskrise betroffenen männlichen Geburtsjahrgängen (1950–1970) noch 
heute Ost-West-Unterschiede sichtbar sind.
DISKUSSION: Die geringere Lebenserwartung der ostdeutschen Bevölkerung Ende der 
1980er-Jahre war primär durch Rückstände bei der kardiovaskulären Revolution 
bedingt. Die noch heute bestehenden Unterschiede sind eher Spätfolgen der 
ostdeutschen Transformationskrise als direkte Spätfolgen der Teilung.
