the UK National Health Service (NHS)/personal social services (PSS) and societal 
perspectives over 1 year.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of OST vs no OST was evaluated by first replicating 
and then expanding an existing UK health technology assessment model. The 
expanded model included the impact of OST on infection rates of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.
RESULTS: Versus no OST, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for BMT 
and MMT were £13,923 and £14,206 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), 
respectively, from a NHS/PSS perspective. When total costs (NHS/PSS and 
societal) are considered, there are substantial savings associated with adopting 
OST; these savings are in excess of £14,032 for BMT vs no OST and £17,174 for 
MMT vs no OST over 1 year. This is primarily driven by a reduction in victim 
costs. OST treatment also impacted other aspects of criminality and healthcare 
resource use.
LIMITATIONS: The model's 1-year timeframe means long-term costs and benefits, 
and the influence of changes over time are not captured.
CONCLUSIONS: OST can be considered cost-effective vs no OST from the UK NHS/PSS 
perspective, with a cost per QALY well below the UK's willingness-to-pay 
threshold. There were only small differences between BMT and MMT. The 
availability of two or more cost-effective options is beneficial to retaining 
patients in OST programs. From a societal perspective, OST is estimated to save 
over £14,032 and £17,174 per year for BMT and MMT vs no OST, respectively, due 
to savings in victim costs. Further work is required to fully quantify the 
clinical and health economic impacts of different OST formulations and their 
societal impact over the long-term.

INTRODUCTION: Hypertension is a major risk factor of cardiovascular diseases 
which are the leading causes of deaths from chronic non-communicable diseases in 
Ethiopia. However, little is documented in the issue. Therefore, this study 
aimed to assess the prevalence, associated factors, awareness, treatment and 
control of hypertension among adults 18 years old or above in Aksum town, Tigray 
region, North Ethiopia.
METHODS: A sequential quantitative-qualitative study was conducted among adults 
aged 18 years and above in Aksum town. A multi stage sampling procedure was used 
to select the study participants for the quantitative study whilst convenience 
sampling technique was used for the qualitative part. A pre-tested and 
structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data, and an interview 
guide was used to collect the qualitative data. The logistic regression model 
was fitted to identify factors independently associated with hypertension using 
SPSS Version 20. P-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 
For the qualitative data, iterative hearing of the discussions verbatim 
interpretation was followed by categorizing similar ideas into themes and 
finally triangulated with the quantitative results.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of hypertension was 16.5% (95% CI: 13.4, 20.0). 
Awareness, treatment and control of hypertension were 43%, 2.1% and 18.2%, 
respectively. Being unable to read and write [AOR = 4.73, 95% CI:1.11, 20.23], 
not consuming fruit [AOR = 4.31, 95% CI:1.74, 10.66], being physically inactive 
[AOR = 20.11, 95% CI:8.75, 6.20], not knowing physical inactivity is a risk 
factor of hypertension [AOR = 3.57, 95% CI: 1.69, 7.69] and being 
overweight/obese [AOR = 9.2, 95% CI:4.54, 18.67] were significantly associated 
with hypertension. Remarkably, all identified hypertensive cases were linked to 
the nearby hospital for confirmation of diagnosis, care and follow-up and all of 
them were found to be hypertensive. This suggests that implementing primary 
health care approach integrated with the urban health extension package may be 
effective in the prevention and control of hypertension in poor settings.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: Prevalence of hypertension among adults was very 
high, but awareness, treatment and control of hypertension was very low. Being 
unable to read and write, not consuming fruit, being physically inactive, 
overweight/obesity and not knowing physical inactivity is a risk factor for 
hypertension were independently associated with hypertension. Policy makers need 
to consider integrating prevention and control of hypertension with health 
extension package. Appropriate information, education and communication 
strategies should also be designed and implemented to avoid unhealthy lifestyles 
and promote healthy practices.

Live to 70 Years and Older or Suffer in Silence: Understanding Health Insurance 
Status Among the Elderly Under the NHIS in Ghana.

Economic Research , University of Ghana , Accra , Ghana.

Ghana has introduced a National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). Embedded in the 
NHIS is a policy to exempt poor and vulnerable groups from premiums and user 
fees. There has been some debate as to why the start-off age for exemption among 
the elderly is 70 years. Ghana has a shorter life expectancy than middle- and 
high-income countries and its current age of retirement is 60 years. This study 
explores the financial and social implications of continuing to charge premiums 
to people aged 60 to 69 years. Based on the analysis of data from a 
representative household survey, it is recommended that the exemption policy 
should be expanded to include all vulnerable elderly persons, regardless of age.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes is associated closely with an increased risk of 
cardiovascular events, including diastolic dysfunction and heart failure that 
leads to a shortening of life expectancy. It is therefore extremely valuable to 
evaluate the impact of antidiabetic agents on cardiac function. However, the 
influence of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors on cardiac function is 
controversial and a major matter of clinical concern. We therefore evaluated the 
effect of sitagliptin on echocardiographic parameters of diastolic function in 
patients with type 2 diabetes as a sub-analysis of the PROLOGUE study.
METHODS: Patients in the PROLOGUE study were assigned randomly to either add-on 
sitagliptin treatment or conventional antidiabetic treatment. Of the 463 
patients in the overall study, 115 patients (55 in the sitagliptin group and 60 
in the conventional group) who had complete echocardiographic data of the ratio 
of peak early diastolic transmitral flow velocity (E) to peak early diastolic 
mitral annular velocity (e') at baseline and after 12 and 24 months were 
included in this study. The primary endpoint of this post hoc sub-analysis was a 
comparison of the changes in the ratio of E to e' (E/e') between the two groups 
from baseline to 24 months.
RESULTS: The baseline-adjusted change in E/e' during 24 months was significantly 
lower in the sitagliptin group than in the conventional group (-0.18 ± 0.55 vs. 
1.91 ± 0.53, p = 0.008), irrespective of a higher E/e' value at baseline in the 
sitagliptin group. In analysis of covariance, sitagliptin treatment was 
significantly associated with change in E/e' over 24 months (β = -9.959, 
p = 0.001), independent of other clinical variables at baseline such as blood 
pressure, HbA1c, and medications for diabetes. Changes in other clinical 
variables including blood pressure and glycemic parameters, and 
echocardiographic parameters, such as cardiac structure and systolic function, 
were comparable between the two groups. There was also no significant difference 
in the serum levels of N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide and 
high-sensitive C-reactive protein between the two groups during the study 
period.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding sitagliptin to conventional antidiabetic regimens in 
patients with T2DM for 24 months attenuated the annual exacerbation in the 
echocardiographic parameter of diastolic dysfunction (E/e') independent of other 
clinical variables such as blood pressure and glycemic control. Trial

Physical activity evaluation in children with congenital heart disease.

Voss C(1), Harris KC(1).

Author information:
(1)Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, University of British 
Columbia, British Columbia, Canada.

Significant advances in the management of children with congenital heart disease 
(CHD) have resulted in marked improvements in survival and life expectancy. 
Thus, there is an increased emphasis on promoting physical activity to optimise 
healthy development and long-term cardiovascular health. Evaluation of physical 
activity levels as part of ongoing clinical care is recommended to facilitate 
physical activity counselling and/or exercise prescription. Physical activity is 
a complex health behaviour that is challenging to evaluate. We provide an 
overview of techniques for measuring physical activity in children with CHD with 
a focus on how to do this in the clinical context. Accelerometers are devices 
that objectively assess intensity and duration of physical activity under free 
living conditions. They enable evaluation against physical activity guidelines, 
but are costly and require advanced technical expertise. Pedometers are a 
simple-to-use and cost-effective alternative, but an outcome metric of daily 
step count limits classification against guidelines. Commercial wearable 
activity trackers offer an appealing user experience and can provide valid 
estimates in children. Furthermore, activity trackers enable remote monitoring 
of physical activity levels, which may facilitate exercise prescription and 
activity counselling. Questionnaires are the most cost-effective and 
time-effective method, but recall error in younger children is a consideration. 
Routine exercise testing in children with CHD provides important insight into 
functional status but should not be viewed as a proxy measure of habitual 
physical activity. Understanding the spectrum and role of physical activity 
measurement tools is important for clinicians focused on optimising 
cardiovascular health in children with CHD.

Aim. Inflammation is important in heart failure (HF). The role of the immune 
receptor toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in HF is not understood and not 
investigated in diastolic HF. We investigated the role of TLR9 in a murine 
diastolic HF model caused by cardiomyocyte SERCA2a excision. Methods and 
Results. We crossed SERCA2a KO and TLR9 KO mice to generate four mouse lines. 
Tamoxifen-induced cardiomyocyte SERCA2a gene excision was carried out in mice, 
causing diastolic HF. After 7.6 weeks, cardiac functions and dimensions were 
analyzed by echocardiography and heart tissues were processed. HF mice depleted 
of TLR9 demonstrated reduced survival compared to SERC2a KO mice, with a median 
life expectancy of 58 days compared to 63 days. Both HF groups displayed 
increased left atrium size, lung weight, fetal gene expressions, 
monocyte/macrophage infiltration, and fibrosis. However, there were no 
significant differences between the groups. Conclusion. In mice with SERCA2a 
KO-induced diastolic HF, the absence of TLR9 reduced median life expectancy. The 
cause remains elusive, as all investigated HF parameters were unaltered. Still, 
these findings support a salutary role of TLR9 in some subsets of HF conditions 
and underline the importance for future studies on the mechanisms of TLR9 in 
diastolic HF.

For patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCAD), either after 
hospitalization for acute cardiac events or in the chronic phase, comprehensive 
treatment programs should be devoted to: (i) reducing mortality and major 
adverse cardiovascular events, (ii) reducing the ischemic burden and related 
symptoms, and (iii) increasing exercise capacity and quality of life.Heart rate 
(HR) has demonstrated to have prognostic value and patients beyond the limit of 
70 bpm display increased risk of all the above adverse outcomes, even after 
adjustment for parameters such as the extension of myocardial infarction and the 
presence of heart failure. It is well known that a sustained HR elevation may 
contribute to the pathogenesis of SCAD, being the likelihood of developing 
ischemia, plaque instability, trigger for arrhythmias, increased vascular 
oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction the mechanisms resulting in this 
effect. Moreover, high HR could promote chronotropic incompetence, leading to 
functional disability and reduced quality of life.Despite the strong 
relationship between HR and prognosis, there is heterogeneity among current 
guidelines in considering HR as a formal therapeutic target for secondary 
prevention in SCAD, as far as the cut-off limit. This expert opinion document 
considered major trials and observational registries in the modern treatment era 
with beta-blockers and ivabradine, suggesting that an adequate HR control could 
represent a target for (i), (ii), and (iii) therapeutic goals in SCAD patients 
with systolic dysfunction (with major evidence for reduced left ventricular 
ejection fraction <40%), and a target for (ii) and (iii) goals in SCAD patients 
with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. The defined cut-off limit is 
70 bpm. To date, there is room for improvement of HR control, since in 
contemporary SCAD patients HR values <70 bpm are present in less than half of 
cases, even in the vulnerable phase after an acute coronary syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: to estimate the burden of cardiovascular diseases in Santa Catarina 
State, Brazil.
METHODS: this is an ecological study with the nine health macroregions of the 
state as units of analysis; the number of years of life lost, the number of 
years lived with disability and the number disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) for 2009 were estimated.
RESULTS: a total of 358,777 DALYs were estimated, with a rate of 5,852 
DALYs/100,000 inhabitants, 51.1% in males; age groups with the highest rates 
were 45-59, 60-69, and 70-79 years; diseases that most contributed to the DALYs 
were ischemic heart diseases and cerebrovascular diseases; health regions with 
the highest DALYs rates were Planalto Norte, Sul and Serra Catarinense.
CONCLUSION: the high burden of cardiovascular diseases in Santa Catarina shows 
the need to intensify actions of health promotion and prevention in all regions 
of the state.

IMPORTANCE: Examining life expectancy by county allows for tracking geographic 
disparities over time and assessing factors related to these disparities. This 
information is potentially useful for policy makers, clinicians, and researchers 
seeking to reduce disparities and increase longevity.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate annual life tables by county from 1980 to 2014; describe 
trends in geographic inequalities in life expectancy and age-specific risk of 
death; and assess the proportion of variation in life expectancy explained by 
variation in socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic 
risk factors, and health care factors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Annual county-level life tables were 
constructed using small area estimation methods from deidentified death records 
from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and population counts 
from the US Census Bureau, NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database. Measures of 
geographic inequality in life expectancy and age-specific mortality risk were 
calculated. Principal component analysis and ordinary least squares regression 
were used to examine the county-level association between life expectancy and 
socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, 
and health care factors.
EXPOSURES: County of residence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Life expectancy at birth and age-specific mortality 
risk.
RESULTS: Counties were combined as needed to create stable units of analysis 
over the period 1980 to 2014, reducing the number of areas analyzed from 3142 to 
3110. In 2014, life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 79.1 (95% 
uncertainty interval [UI], 79.0-79.1) years overall, but differed by 20.1 (95% 
UI, 19.1-21.3) years between the counties with the lowest and highest life 
expectancy. Absolute geographic inequality in life expectancy increased between 
1980 and 2014. Over the same period, absolute geographic inequality in the risk 
of death decreased among children and adolescents, but increased among older 
adults. Socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk 
factors, and health care factors explained 60%, 74%, and 27% of county-level 
variation in life expectancy, respectively. Combined, these factors explained 
74% of this variation. Most of the association between socioeconomic and 
race/ethnicity factors and life expectancy was mediated through behavioral and 
metabolic risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Geographic disparities in life expectancy among US 
counties are large and increasing. Much of the variation in life expectancy 
among counties can be explained by a combination of socioeconomic and 
race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care 
factors. Policy action targeting socioeconomic factors and behavioral and 
metabolic risk factors may help reverse the trend of increasing disparities in 
life expectancy in the United States.

Single-chain fragment variable-fragment crystallizable antibody constructs 
(scFv-Fc) are homodimeric proteins representing valuable alternatives to 
heterotetrameric full-length IgG molecules to study protein properties and 
product-dependent cellular behavior. In contrast to naturally occurring 
antibodies, these artificial molecules are assembled from functional antibody 
domains to reduce molecule complexity and enhance antibody expression levels. 
The scFv-Fc format retains critical antibody functions such as antigen binding 
affinity and antibody effector functions. Here, we present a protocol to convert 
the full-length anti-HIV-1 IgG1 antibody 2F5 into a scFv-Fc construct. Variable 
and constant regions are amplified by conventional PCR reactions and assembled 
by a single overlap-extension PCR reaction. The amplified product is then cloned 
into a mammalian expression vector suitable for high-titer transient gene 
expression. This workflow can be applied to any antibody sequence by adapting 
the specific primer sequences to the antibody of choice.

INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Indigenous Australians experience a significant gap in 
life expectancy compared with non-Indigenous Australians. Indigenous communities 
have high-smoking prevalence and low engagement with cessation therapies. This 
qualitative research, conducted in an urban Australian Indigenous community, 
explored smokers' views on smoking, quitting and engagement with current 
nicotine replacement therapies. Opinions on acceptability of tobacco harm 
reduction were sought. We explored the acceptability of novel nicotine products, 
that is, new or unfamiliar products, including non-therapeutic options, such as 
e-cigarettes.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Focus groups and individual interviews with adult Indigenous 
daily smokers (n = 27) were used. Current and novel nicotine products were 
displayed and demonstrated. Discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed and 
analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Participants expressed interest in trying existing and novel nicotine 
products. Short-to-medium term use of nicotine replacement therapy for quitting 
was generally acceptable; views on long-term use were mixed. Interest in use of 
tobacco substitutes depended on their perceived effectiveness, providing a 
'kick' and 'relieving stress'. Desirable qualities for tobacco substitutes were 
identified with gender differences and product preferences noted. The unpleasant 
taste of existing products is a barrier to both short-term and long-term use.
DISCUSSION: We found substantial interest in trying some existing and novel 
nicotine products, mostly for short-term use. A number of attributes were 
identified that would make nicotine products potentially acceptable as a 
long-term substitute.
CONCLUSIONS: Some participants were interested in long-term substitution if 
acceptable products were available. Improvements in current products and access 
to novel products are needed if tobacco harm reduction is to be acceptable.

BACKGROUND: The thumb plays a critical role for manual tasks during the 
activities of daily life and the incidence of neurological or musculoskeletal 
disorders affecting the voluntary movements of the thumb is high in the elderly. 
There is currently no tool to assess repetitive motor sequencing of the thumb 
during ageing.
OBJECTIVES: To report a novel procedure (the Click Test) assessing the effects 
of ageing on fast motor sequencing of the thumb.
METHOD: Healthy subjects (n = 252; mean age +/- SD: 49.76 +/- 19.97 years; 
range: 19-89 years; F/M: 151/101) were asked to perform fast repeated 
flexion/extension movements of the thumb using a mechanical counter.
RESULTS: Motor performances (assessed by the number of clicks during 3 time 
periods: 15, 30 and 45 sec), significantly decreased as a function of age for 
both the dominant (age effect; p< 0.0001 for 15, 30 and 45 sec) and the 
non-dominant hand (p<0.0001 for 15, 30 and 45 sec). The number of clicks was 
significantly higher in males (gender effect; p<0.001) and was higher on the 
dominant side as compared to the non-dominant side (handedness effect: p<0.001). 
The Click Test is characterized by high repeatability (coefficients of variation 
from 3.20 to 4.47%), excellent intra-rater reliability (intra-class coefficients 
ICC ranging from 0.89 to 0.98), high inter-rater reproducibility (Pearson's 
product correlation ranging from 0.85 to 0.96), high internal consistency 
(Cronbach alpha coefficient=0.95) and is highly correlated in terms of relative 
performances with the box and block test and the 9-hole peg test (positive 
linear correlation with the results of the box and block test: p<0.001 for 15, 
30 and 45 sec for both the dominant and the non-dominant hand; negative linear 
correlation with the results of the 9-hole peg test: p<0.001 for 15, 30 and 45 
sec for both the dominant and the non-dominant hand).
CONCLUSION: The Click Test is an entirely novel and very low cost tool to 
reliably discriminate the ageing effects upon the performances during fast 
repetitive motor sequencing of the thumb. The potential clinical and research 
applications for motor functions are multiple, especially in acute and chronic 
neurological disorders affecting the thumb as well as in the field of 
rheumatology and orthopedics.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is devastating. Because of 
its silent nature, the disease is often only diagnosed once it has reached an 
advanced, frequently inoperable stage. To date, we have no biomarkers that 
facilitate earlier diagnosis, leaving sufficient time for curative therapy that 
effectively lowers the very high mortality rate of this cancer entity. Because 
of this, the life expectancy of patients with PDAC is low (i.e. ≤ 6% five-year 
survival rates). New data, including particular genetic signatures and features 
of the stromal architecture of PDAC tumors, may better explain their 
aggressiveness, their relatively long-lasting painless expansion, and why 
chemotherapy so frequently fails. The typical tumor-induced stromal desmoplasia 
is characterized by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), decreased immune 
surveillance, cancer-associated neural remodeling, and a very low vascular 
density. This stromal microenvironment generates hypoxia, nutrient deficiency, 
immune suppression, and chemoresistance. The combination of factors results in a 
vicious disease that begins with the long-lasting, asymptomatic development of a 
large tumor mass, followed by a delayed diagnosis with a high percentage of 
inoperable states, exhibiting a poor response to all conservative therapeutic 
options, including radiation, and which ends with metastasis resulting in a 
rapid fatal outcome.
OBJECTIVE: In this article, we review coherences on genetic, cellular, 
immunological, Nano medical and stromal characteristics of PDAC tissue, and 
discuss metabolic abnormalities associated with and/or preceding the tumor 
progression rate.
CONCLUSION: A more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms can 
improve the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients suffering from 
this devastating type of cancer.

Starting well before Independence in 1948, and over the ensuing six decades, 
Israel has built a robust, relatively efficient public system of health care, 
resulting in good health statistics throughout the life course. Because of the 
initiative of people living under the British Mandate for Palestine (1922-48), 
the development of many of today's health services predated the state's 
establishment by several decades. An extensive array of high-quality services 
and technologies is available to all residents, largely free at point of 
service, via the promulgation of the 1994 National Health Insurance Law. In 
addition to a strong medical academic culture, well equipped (albeit crowded) 
hospitals, and a robust primary-care infrastructure, the country has also 
developed some model national projects such as a programme for community quality 
indicators, an annual update of the national basket of services, and a strong 
system of research and education. Challenges include increasing privatisation of 
what was once largely a public system, and the underfunding in various sectors 
resulting in, among other challenges, relatively few acute hospital beds. 
Despite substantial organisational and financial investment, disparities persist 
based on ethnic origin or religion, other socioeconomic factors, and, regardless 
of the country's small size, a geographic maldistribution of resources. The 
Ministry of Health continues to be involved in the ownership and administration 
of many general hospitals and the direct payment for some health services (eg, 
geriatric institutional care), activities that distract it from its main task of 
planning for and supervising the whole health structure. Although the 
health-care system itself is very well integrated in relation to the country's 
two main ethnic groups (Israeli Arabs and Israeli Jews), we think that health in 
its widest sense might help provide a bridge to peace and reconciliation between 
the country and its neighbours.

Israel is a high-income country with an advanced health system and universal 
health-care insurance. Overall, the health status has improved steadily over 
recent decades. We examined differences in morbidity, mortality, and risk 
factors for selected non-communicable diseases (NCDs) between subpopulation 
groups. Between 1975 and 2014, life expectancy in Israel steadily increased and 
is currently above the average life expectancy for the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development countries. Nevertheless, life expectancy has 
remained lower among Israeli Arabs than Israeli Jews, and this gap has recently 
widened. Age-adjusted mortality as a result of heart disease, stroke, or 
diabetes remains higher in Arabs, whereas age-adjusted incidence and mortality 
of cancer were higher among Jews. The prevalence of obesity and low physical 
activity in Israel is considerably higher among Arabs than Jews. Smoking 
prevalence is highest for Arab men and lowest for Arab women. Health 
inequalities are also evident by the indicators of socioeconomic position and in 
subpopulations, such as immigrants from the former Soviet Union, ultra-Orthodox 
Jews, and Bedouin Arabs. Despite universal health coverage and substantial 
improvements in the overall health of the Israeli population, substantial 
inequalities in NCDs persist. These differences might be explained, at least in 
part, by gaps in social determinants of health. The Ministry of Health has 
developed comprehensive programmes to reduce these inequalities between the 
major population groups. Sustained coordinated multisectoral efforts are needed 
to achieve a greater impact and to address other social inequalities.

Although Israel is still young in years, with relatively high birth rates and 
older people (individuals aged 65 years or older) constituting only about 11% of 
its population, the absolute number of older people is growing rapidly. Life 
expectancy is high, and increasing numbers of people are living to advanced old 
age (older than 85 years). A wide spectrum of geriatric care is provided within 
a universal system providing health services to all citizens. Community and 
institutional care is available, and many innovative programmes are being 
developed. The unique demographic characteristics of the ageing society in 
Israel reflect cultural and multiethnic diversity, in addition to a high rate of 
immigration of older people. To meet the growing challenges, address 
disparities, and search for innovation will require planning and development of 
adequate services at the highest level.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study reviews the clinical characteristics of 
patients with diabetic foot ulcer treated in a Multidisciplinary Diabetic Foot 
Unit (MDFU) and analyzes the mortality and factors associated with its survival.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from all patients who attended the MDFU for the first 
time for a diabetic foot ulcer during the 2008-2014 period were analized. The 
patients were followed until their death or until June 30, 2016, for up to 8 
years.
RESULTS: A total of 345 patients were included, with a median age (P25-P75) of 
71 (61.5-80) years, and 321 (93%) had type 2 diabetes. They were characterized 
as patients with inadequate glycemic control, 48% had HbA1c ≥ 8% and high 
prevalence of chronic complications: 60.2% retinopathy, 43.8% nephropathy and 
47.2% ischemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease. A total of 126 
(36.5%) patients died and 69 (54.8%) were due to cardiovascular disease. 
Survival measured by Kaplan-Meier declined over time to 69, 60 and 45% at 3, 5 
and 7 years respectively. Cox's multivariate regression analysis showed the 
following variables associated with mortality, HR (95% CI): age 1.08 
(1.05-1.11); previous amputation 2.24 (1.34-3.73); active smoking 2.10 
(1.12-3.97); cerebrovascular disease 1.75 (1.05-2.92); renal dysfunction 
1.65 (1.04-2.61) and ischemic heart disease 1.60 (1.01-2.51).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetic foot ulcer are characterized by high 
morbidity and mortality, with cardiovascular disease being the most frequent 
cause of death. It is necessary to pay more attention to this risk group, 
tailoring objectives and treatments to their situation and life expectancy.

Body mass index (BMI) is a powerful predictor of death, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) 
and cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Over the last few decades, we 
have witnessed a global rise in adult obesity of epidemic proportions. 
Similarly, there has been a parallel increase in the incidence of atrial 
fibrillation (AF), itself a significant cause of cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality. This may be partly attributable to advances in the treatment of 
coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure (HF) improving life expectancy, 
however, epidemiological studies have demonstrated an independent association 
between obesity, diabetes and AF, suggesting possible common pathophysiological 
mechanisms and risk factors. Indeed, cardiac remodeling, haemodynamic 
alterations, autonomic dysfunction, and diastolic dysfunction have been reported 
in obese and diabetic cohorts. Moreover, diabetic cardiomyopathy is 
characterized by an adverse structural and functional cardiac phenotype, which 
may predispose to the development of AF. In this review, we discuss the 
pathophysiological and mechanistic relationships between obesity, diabetes and 
AF, and some of the challenges posed in the management of this high-risk group 
of individuals.

PURPOSE: To review the data sources of health-state utility values (HSUVs), as 
well as their elicitation and use, in 140 breast cancer-related cost-utility 
analyses (CUAs), and to provide a critical appraisal of these.
METHODS: A checklist was developed to guide the process of the critical 
appraisal. It is divided into three parts: the data source (three questions), 
elicitation method (four questions), and use (ten questions) of HSUVs in CUAs. 
Two independent reviewers performed the data extraction. A consensus was reached 
in case of disagreements. Data sources were categorized as "original study," 
"derived from the literature," or "other."
RESULTS: The data source of HSUVs was always specified. When HSUVs were derived 
from the literature (90% of cases), the authors referred to a median number of 
two references as data sources. The critical appraisal of the elicitation of 
HSUVs in CUAs revealed considerable variability in terms of the quality of the 
reporting of the data source selection of HSUV. More details were provided by 
authors when HSUVs were elicited from an original study rather than derived from 
the literature. The use of HSUVs elicited from an original study was generally 
better described in terms of the checklist than were those derived from the 
literature.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the developed checklist, we were able to highlight the 
challenges that authors are facing when trying to adequately report HSUV used in 
CUAs. Our proposed checklist offers a good starting point for encouraging more 
explicit and comprehensive reporting of HSUVs in CUAs.

INTRODUCTION: In the United Kingdom, over 83,000 primary total hip 
arthroplasties (THAs) were performed last year, of which 20% are in patients 
under the age of 60 years. These patients generally have a longer life 
expectancy and a higher activity level than an older cohort, which may
