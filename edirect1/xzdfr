INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a progressive disorder associated with age, which is 
characterized by deterioration of individuals' cognitive functions such as the 
ability to perform routine tasks. With the increase of human life expectancy, 
the prevalence of dementia patients will reach 152 million in 2050. 
Unfortunately, there is no treatment available to cure dementia or alter the 
course of its progression. However, there is an area of support for patients and 
caregivers to assist daily living. Technological devices and applications are 
increasingly advancing, exploiting sensory data for dementia patients and 
homecare using smartphones to permit monitoring of their activities.
AIM: This paper uses the labeled dataset besides comparing the 3-classification 
algorithm to evaluate whether or not the algorithms deployed can classify the 
activities with high accuracy.
RESULTS: A public data is used to classify human activities into one of the six 
activities, BigML platform is used to build machine learning models. Results 
show that machine learning algorithms can achieve high accuracy. The activity 
recognition algorithms are highly accurate using ridged regression and deep 
neural networks, with almost all activities being recognized correctly over 98% 
of the time.
CONCLUSION: An application of smartphones can be utilized for human activities 
monitoring by proposing a high level for dementia patients and homecare 
monitoring services. Using this service, the patients only need to carry the 
smartphone, and their caregivers simply need to use the application that 
monitors their patients' activities.

Rica.

Costa Rica has long been a country of special interest in the Americas and in 
global health because of its good health. The United Nations Development 
Programme ranks countries according to their level of human development based on 
life expectancy, education and national income. Although Costa Rica is ranked at 
63 and classified as 'High', in terms of health it belongs in the 'Very High' 
group. In 2018 mean life expectancy for the 'Very High' countries was 79.5, 
while in Costa Rica it was 80. In 2018, under five mortality was 8.8/1000 live 
births, lower than countries ranked in the 'Very High' human development group. 
Expected years of schooling in Costa Rica is 15.4, closer to the average, 16.4 
years, of the 'Very High' human development group than the average of the 'High' 
group. The country is much healthier than would be predicted by its national 
income; rather, other features of society's development are likely to have 
played a key role in the development of good health. These include (i) the 
decision to cease investment in national defence, which freed up money to invest 
in health, education and the welfare of the population; (ii) the decision to 
create a universal health system financed by the State, employers and workers in 
the 1940s; and (iii) the educational system, that generated opportunities to 
lift important sectors of the population out of poverty, allowing them to have 
basic sanitary conditions that increase their possibilities to live longer and 
in better conditions. Despite these advances, inequalities in terms of income 
and social conditions persist, presenting challenges in the field of health, 
particularly for lower-income populations and those of African and indigenous 
descent. These inequalities must be addressed using decisions based on 
scientific evidence, a greater use of disaggregated data to reveal progress in 
addressing these inequalities, and with a broader articulation of the health 
sector with policies that act on the social determinants of health.

Publisher: Costa Rica es un país de especial interés en las Américas y en la 
salud mundial debido a su buena salud. El Programa de las Naciones Unidas para 
el Desarrollo clasifica a los países según su nivel de desarrollo humano con 
base en la esperanza de vida, la educación y el ingreso nacional. Aunque Costa 
Rica está clasificada en el puesto 63 y clasificada dentro del grupo ‘Alto’, en 
términos de salud pertenece al grupo ‘Muy alto’. En 2018 la esperanza de vida 
media de los países del grupo ‘Muy alto’ era de 79,5 años, mientras que en Costa 
Rica era de 80. En 2018, la mortalidad en menores de cinco años era de 8,8/1000 
nacidos vivos, inferior a la de los países clasificados en el grupo de 
desarrollo humano ‘Muy alto’. Los años de escolaridad esperados en Costa Rica 
son 15,4, más cercanos al promedio, 16,4 años, del grupo de desarrollo humano 
‘Muy alto’ que el promedio del grupo ‘Alto’. El país es mucho más saludable de 
lo que podría predecirse por su ingreso nacional; más bien, es probable que 
otras características del desarrollo de la sociedad hayan desempeñado un papel 
fundamental en el desarrollo de la buena salud. Entre ellas figuran: (i) la 
decisión de dejar de invertir en la defensa nacional, que liberó dinero para 
invertir en salud, educación y bienestar de la población; (ii) la decisión de 
crear un sistema de salud universal financiado por el Estado, los empleadores y 
los trabajadores en el decenio de 1940; y (iii) el sistema educativo, que generó 
oportunidades para sacar de la pobreza a importantes sectores de la población, 
permitiéndoles disponer de condiciones sanitarias básicas que aumentan sus 
posibilidades de vivir más y en mejores condiciones. A pesar de estos avances, 
persisten desigualdades en términos de ingresos y condiciones sociales, lo que 
plantea desafíos en el ámbito de la salud, en particular para las poblaciones de 
menores ingresos y las de ascendencia africana e indígena. Estas desigualdades 
deben abordarse mediante decisiones basadas en pruebas científicas, un mayor uso 
de datos desagregados que revelen los progresos realizados para hacer frente a 
esas desigualdades, y una mayor articulación del sector de la salud con las 
políticas que actúan sobre los determinantes sociales de la salud.

BACKGROUND: Women are twice as likely as men to develop knee osteoarthritis 
(OA), and with it experience greater losses of physical function and disability. 
A change in the mechanical environment of the joint is a key initiating factor 
for knee OA. Differences in morphology, joint injury risk, and hormonal shifts 
in mid-life are often considered factors which increase OA risk for women. 
Pregnancy, a time of significant hormonal, morphological, and biomechanical 
change, has received comparably less attention. If morphological and 
biomechanical changes persist postpartum, this could increase OA risk for parous 
(childbearing) women.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Are lower limb gait mechanics different between healthy 
nulliparous (non-childbearing) and parous (childbearing) women?
METHODS: Twenty-eight self-reported not pregnant female participants (14 parous, 
14 nulliparous) were recruited for the study. Nulliparous participants had never 
given birth to a child. Parous participants had given birth to at least one 
full-term infant (37-42 weeks) without complications between one to five years 
before data collection. Motion capture of participants' preferred, fast, and set 
(1.4 m/s) walking speeds was conducted. Repeated measures ANOVA were performed 
to test for significant group differences in joint kinematics and kinetics.
RESULTS: There was a significant main effect of group indicating a larger knee 
flexion angle at toe off (p = 0.0002), smaller knee extension moment at heel 
strike (p = 0.0006), smaller first peak knee flexion moment (p = 0.040), and 
smaller peak hip adduction moment for the parous group compared to the 
nulliparous group (p = 0.003). Static Q-angle did not differ between groups.
SIGNIFICANCE: Alteration in mechanics from the habitual loading pattern are 
thought to increase risk of OA. Smaller knee moments in post-partum women could 
alter the mechanical stimulus to cartilage, and should be investigated in 
conjunction with cartilage health measures to determine the link with OA 
initiation.

Due to extension of life expectancy, millions of people suffer nowadays from 
bone and dental malfunctions that can only be treated by different types of 
implants. However, these implants tend to fail due to bacterial infection and 
lack of integration with the remaining tissue. Here, we demonstrate a new 
concept in which we use specifically designed peptides, in a "Lego-like" manner 
to endow multiple preprogrammed functions. We developed a bifunctional 
peptide-based coating that simultaneously rejects the adhesion of infecting 
bacteria and attracts cells that build the new connecting tissue. The peptide 
design contains fluorinated phenylalanine that mediates the self-assembly of the 
peptide into a coating that resists bacterial adhesion. It also includes an 
Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif that attracts mammalian cells. The whole compound is 
attached to the surface using a third unit, the amino acid 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). This novel, yet very simple approach is 
significantly advantageous for practical use and synthesis. More importantly, 
this peptide design can serve as a general platform for generating functional 
coatings.

Urinary incontinence (UI) is a major social problem for older adults and leads 
to a decline in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), mental health, and 
physical activity. This study assessed the prevalence and symptoms of UI among 
older adults discharged from the hospital in Japan and investigated the 
association of UI symptoms with physical activity, HRQoL, and subjective 
well-being (SWB). By an international consultation, the Incontinence 
Questionnaire Short Form (ICIQ-SF) that assesses UI severity, was developed. 
Self-administered questionnaires were used to assess physical activity, HRQoL, 
SWB, and social demographic characteristics of the participants. In total, 145 
participants (valid response rate, 48%; mean age, 78.6 ± 7.6 years) were 
included in the analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
performed to identify significant factors associated with the presence of UI. 
Significant decreases in physical activity, HRQoL, and SWB were observed in 
patients with UI compared with those without UI (p < 0.05). Multivariate 
analysis revealed that age, number of reported conditions, and decreased SWB 
were associated with UI (p < 0.05). UI was associated with less physical 
activity and decreased mental health status in older adults (especially 
decreased SWB). Health-promoting measures for older adults with UI are essential 
for maintaining their well-being and extending healthy life expectancy.

Fish and fishery products are among the food commodities of high commercial 
value, high-quality protein content, vitamins, minerals and unsaturated fatty 
acids, which are beneficial to health. However, seafood products are highly 
perishable and thus require proper processing to maintain their quality and 
safety. On the other hand, consumers, nowadays, demand fresh or fresh-like, 
minimally processed fishery products that do not alter their natural quality 
attributes. The present article reviews the results of studies published over 
the last 15 years in the literature on: (i) the main spoilage mechanisms of 
seafood including contamination with pathogens and (ii) innovative processing 
technologies applied for the preservation and shelf life extension of seafood 
products. These primarily include: high hydrostatic pressure, natural 
preservatives, ozonation, irradiation, pulse light technology and retort pouch 
processing.

People with type 1 diabetes have an increased risk of developing microvascular 
complications, which have a negative impact on the quality of life and reduce 
life expectancy. Numerous studies in animals with experimental diabetes show 
that c-peptide supplementation exerts beneficial effects on diabetes-induced 
damage in peripheral nerves and kidneys. There is substantial evidence that 
c-peptide counteracts the detrimental changes caused by hyperglycemia at the 
cellular level, such as decreased activation of endothelial nitric oxide 
synthase and sodium potassium ATPase, and increase in formation of 
pro-inflammatory molecules mediated by nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer 
of activated B cells: cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, vascular 
endothelial growth factor, and transforming growth factor beta. However, despite 
positive results from cell and animal studies, no successful c-peptide 
replacement therapies have been developed so far. Therefore, it is important to 
improve our understanding of the impact of c-peptide on the pathophysiology of 
microvascular complications to develop novel c-peptide-based treatments. This 
article aims to review current knowledge on the impact of c-peptide on diabetic 
neuro- and nephropathy and to evaluate its potential therapeutic role.

OBJECTIVE: Diabetes imposes a heavy burden on both health and productivity. In 
this study, we sought to estimate the potential productivity gains associated 
with the prevention of type 2 diabetes over the next 10 years in Australia.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Dynamic life table models were constructed to 
estimate years of life lived and productivity-adjusted life-years (PALYs) lived 
by Australians aged 20-69 years over the period from 2020 to 2029. The models 
distinguished people with and without type 2 diabetes. PALYs were ascribed a 
financial value equivalent to gross domestic product (GDP) per full-time worker 
in Australia (∼200,000 Australian dollars [AUD]). The model simulation was first 
undertaken assuming currently expected trends in the incidence of type 2 
diabetes and then repeated assuming hypothetically that the incidence was 
reduced. The difference between the modeled outputs reflected the impact of new 
cases of type 2 diabetes on productivity as well as the potential benefits of 
prevention. An annual 5% discount rate was applied to all outcomes.
RESULTS: Over the next decade, 140 million years of life and 87 million PALYs 
will be lived by Australians of working age, contributing AUD 18.0 trillion to 
the country's GDP. A 10% reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes would 
result in a gain of 2,510 PALYs and AUD 532 million in GDP.
CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the health and economic impact of type 2 
diabetes and the gains that could be potentially achieved from the 
implementation of effective prevention strategies. However, cost-effectiveness 
evaluations of these prevention strategies are needed.

Cachexia is a severe complication of cancer that adversely affects the course of 
the disease, with currently no effective treatments. It is characterized by a 
progressive atrophy of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, resulting in weight 
loss, a reduced quality of life, and a shortened life expectancy. Although the 
cachectic condition primarily affects the skeletal muscle, a tissue that 
accounts for ~40% of total body weight, cachexia is considered a multi-organ 
disease that involves different tissues and organs, among which the cardiac 
muscle stands out for its relevance. Patients with cancer often experience 
severe cardiac abnormalities and manifest symptoms that are indicative of 
chronic heart failure, including fatigue, shortness of breath, and impaired 
exercise tolerance. Furthermore, cardiovascular complications are among the 
major causes of death in cancer patients who experienced cachexia. The lack of 
effective treatments for cancer cachexia underscores the need to improve our 
understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Increasing evidence links the 
wasting of the cardiac and skeletal muscles to metabolic alterations, primarily 
increased energy expenditure, and to increased proteolysis, ensuing from 
activation of the major proteolytic machineries of the cell, including 
ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and autophagy. This review aims at providing an 
overview of the key mechanisms of cancer cachexia, with a major focus on those 
that are shared by the skeletal and cardiac muscles.

Smoking has a substantial impact on deaths from non-communicable chronic 
diseases (NCDs). Quantitatively measuring the impact of tobacco control on 
population health is of great theoretical and practical importance, for 
governments to make health policy decisions. Focusing on premature deaths, we 
predicted the deaths by 2030 from major NCDs caused by smoking among people aged 
30-69 years in Sichuan Province, Southwest China. We extracted data for 
1990-2015 from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 and calculated the 
population attributable fraction, to estimate the proportion of deaths caused by 
smoking. Four different tobacco control standards were used to estimate 2030 
projections for the prevalence of smoking and premature mortality. If smoking 
prevalence were reduced by 30% from 2015 levels, premature mortality could be 
expected to decline by 24.4% in 2030, achieving 81.3% of the World Health 
Organization target for reducing premature mortality by 30%. Compared with the 
continuation of historical trends, the strongest tobacco control policy scenario 
would reduce premature mortality by 6.6%, prevent 23,600 deaths, reduce 
mortality by 7.8%, and increase life expectancy at birth by 0.3 years. Smoking 
bans represent an important action toward achieving national health goals.

Hormesis is any kind of biphasic dose-response when low doses of some agents are 
beneficial while higher doses are detrimental. Radiation hormesis is the most 
thoroughly investigated among all hormesis-like phenomena, in particular in 
biogerontology. In this review, we aimed to summarize research evidence 
supporting hormesis through exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR). 
Radiation-induced longevity hormesis has been repeatedly reported in 
invertebrate models such as C. elegans, Drosophila and flour beetles and in 
vertebrate models including guinea pigs, mice and rabbits. On the contrary, 
suppressing natural background radiation was repeatedly found to cause 
detrimental effects in protozoa, bacteria and flies. We also discussed here the 
possibility of clinical use of LDIR, predominantly for age-related disorders, 
e.g., Alzheimer's disease, for which no remedies are available. There is 
accumulating evidence that LDIR, such as those commonly used in X-ray imaging 
including computer tomography, might act as a hormetin. Of course, caution 
should be exercised when introducing new medical practices, and LDIR therapy is 
no exception. However, due to the low average residual life expectancy in old 
patients, the short-term benefits of such interventions (e.g., potential 
therapeutic effect against dementia) may outweigh their hypothetical delayed 
risks (e.g., cancer). We argue here that assessment and clinical trials of LDIR 
treatments should be given priority bearing in mind the enormous economic, 
social and ethical implications of potentially-treatable, age-related disorders.

widening inequalities in disability-free LE (DFLE) by socioeconomic status (SES) 
in many countries. We use longitudinal data to better understand trends in DFLE 
and years independent (IndLE) by SES, and how underlying transitions contribute.
METHODS: The Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS I and II) are large 
population-based studies of those aged ≥65 years in three English centres 
(Newcastle, Nottingham, Cambridgeshire), with baseline around 1991 (CFAS I, 
n = 7635) and 2011 (CFAS II, n = 7762) and 2-year follow-up. We defined 
disability as difficulty in activities of daily living (ADL), dependency by 
combining ADLs and cognition reflecting care required, and SES by area-level 
deprivation. Transitions between disability or dependency states and death were 
estimated from multistate models.
RESULTS: Between 1991 and 2011, gains in DFLE at age 65 were greatest for the 
most advantaged men and women [men: 4.7 years, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 
3.3-6.2; women: 2.8 years, 95% CI 1.3-4.3]. Gains were due to the most 
advantaged women having a reduced risk of incident disability [relative risk 
ratio (RRR):0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.8], whereas the most advantaged men had a greater 
likelihood of recovery (RRR: 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.2) and reduced disability-free 
mortality risk (RRR: 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.6]. Risk of death from disability 
decreased for least advantaged men (RRR: 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.9); least advantaged 
women showed little improvement in transitions. IndLE patterns across time were 
similar.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevention should target the most disadvantaged areas, to narrow 
inequalities, with clear indication from the most advantaged that reduction in 
poor transitions is achievable.

OBJECTIVE: To predict the probability of a benefit from 2 contrasting exercise 
programs for women with a new diagnosis of mild knee osteoarthritis, and to 
estimate the short- and long-term effects of aquatic resistance training (ART) 
and high-impact aerobic land training (HLT) compared with a control.
METHODS: Original data sets from 2 previously conducted randomized controlled 
trials were combined and used in a Bayesian meta-analysis. Group differences in 
multiple response variables were estimated. Variables included cardiorespiratory 
fitness, dynamic maximum leg muscle power, maximal isometric knee extension and 
flexion force, pain, other symptoms, and quality of life. The statistical model 
included a latent commitment variable for each female participant.
RESULTS: ART had a 55-71% probability of benefits in the outcome variables, and 
as the main effect, the intervention outperformed the control in 
cardiorespiratory fitness, with a probability of 71% immediately after the 
intervention period. HLT had a 46-63% probability of benefits after intervention 
with the outcome variables, but differently from ART; the positive effects of 
physical performance fade away during the follow-up period. Overall, the 
differences between groups were small, and the variation in the predictions 
between individuals was high.
CONCLUSION: Both interventions had benefits, but ART has a slightly higher 
probability of long-term benefits on physical performance. Because of high 
individual variation and no clear advantage of one training method over the 
other, personal preferences should be considered in the selection of the 
exercise program to ensure highest commitment to training.

PURPOSE: Diabetic macular oedema (DMO), a complication of diabetes, causes 
vision loss and blindness. Corticosteroids are usually used as a second-line 
treatment. The aim of this study was to analyse the cost-effectiveness of 
dexamethasone implants compared to cheaper and more frequently applied 
triamcinolone injections.
METHODS: Markov-modelling, which incorporated both eyes, was used for economic 
evaluation. The model consisted of five health states based on visual acuity, 
illustrating the progression of DMO. A cycle length of five months was chosen 
for dexamethasone and four months for triamcinolone. Time horizons of two and 
five years were applied. Transition probabilities and health state utilities 
were sourced from previous studies. The perspective used in this analysis was 
the hospital perspective. The health care costs were acquired from Kuopio 
University Hospital in Finland.
RESULTS: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio ICER with 3% discount rate was €56 591/QALY for a two-year follow-up and 
-€1 110 942/QALY for a five-year follow-up. In order to consider dexamethasone 
as cost-effective over a 2-year time horizon, the WTP needs to be around 
€55 000/QALY. Over the five-year follow-up, triamcinolone is clearly a dominant 
treatment. Sensitivity analyses support the cost-effectiveness of dexamethasone 
over a 2-year time horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: Since the sensitivity analyses support the results, dexamethasone 
would be a cost-effective treatment during the first two years with WTP 
threshold around €55 000/QALY, and triamcinolone would be a convenient treatment 
after that. This recommendation is in line with the guidelines of EURETINA.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), encompassing Crohn's 
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic and disabling disorders. 
Prospective disease-modification trials to prevent disease progression are 
eagerly awaited. However, disease progression is not clearly defined. The 
objective of the Selecting End PoInts foR Disease-ModIfication Trials (SPIRIT) 
initiative was to achieve international expert consensus on the endpoints to be 
used in future IBD-disease modification trials.
METHODS: This initiative under the auspices of the International Organization 
for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD) began with a systematic 
literature search to evaluate the current evidence on the definition of disease 
progression in IBD. On October 22, 2019, a consensus meeting took place during 
the United European Gastroenterology Week (UEGW) Congress in Barcelona, during 
which predefined proposed statements were discussed in a plenary session and 
voted on anonymously. Agreement was defined as at least 75% of participants 
voting for any one statement.
RESULTS: The group agreed that the ultimate therapeutic goal in both CD and UC 
is to prevent disease impact on patient's life (health-related quality of life, 
disability, fecal incontinence), midterm complications (encompass bowel damage 
in CD, IBD-related surgery and hospitalizations, disease extension in UC, 
extraintestinal manifestations, permanent stoma, short bowel syndrome), and 
long-term complications (gastrointestinal and extraintestinal dysplasia or 
cancer, mortality).
CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations on which goals to achieve in disease-modification 
trials for preventing disease progression in patients with IBD are proposed by 
the SPIRIT consensus. However, these recommendations will require validation in 
actual clinical studies before implementation in disease-modification trials.

PURPOSE: To report uveal melanoma (UM) metastasis to the contralateral ocular 
and periocular structures.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen patients with UM metastasis to the contralateral ocular 
and periocular structures were included.
METHODS: Clinical records were reviewed retrospectively.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The development and time to onset of contralateral ocular 
and periocular metastasis, systemic metastasis, and death.
RESULTS: Of the 13 000 treated UM patients, 13 patients were diagnosed with UM 
metastasis to the contralateral ocular and periocular structures. Mean patient 
age at primary UM diagnosis was 60 years (median, 60 years; range, 37-87 years). 
The primary uveal melanoma was in the choroid (n = 11) or ciliary body (n = 2) 
and was treated with brachytherapy (n = 11), proton beam radiotherapy (n = 1), 
or enucleation (n = 1). Systemic metastasis developed in 11 patients (85%) at a 
mean of 66 months (median, 34 months; range, 12-216 months) after diagnosis of 
the primary UM. All 11 patients (100%) showed liver metastasis and 8 patients 
(62%) also showed extrahepatic metastasis. The sites of metastasis to the 
contralateral ocular or periocular structures included the choroid in 4 patients 
(31%), the orbit in 7 patients (54%), and the eyelid in 2 patients (15%). One 
patient with eyelid metastasis demonstrated concurrent conjunctival nodule. Mean 
time to diagnosis of contralateral ocular or periocular metastasis was 94 months 
(median, 48 months; range, 9-375 months). Contralateral choroidal metastasis was 
multifocal in 3 of 4 patients (75%). Of 7 patients with orbital metastasis, 5 
showed extraocular muscle involvement with restricted ocular motility. Treatment 
for contralateral choroidal metastasis included brachytherapy (n = 2), 
transpupillary thermotherapy (n = 1), and observation (n = 1). Treatment for 
contralateral periocular (orbit or eyelid) metastasis was excision (n = 5), 
external beam radiotherapy (n = 2), and observation (n = 2). Of 13 patients, 
death was documented in 11 patients at a mean of 17 months (median, 9 months; 
range, 3-54 months) as a result of systemic UM metastasis (n = 10) or unrelated 
cause (n = 1).
CONCLUSIONS: Metastasis resulting from UM to the contralateral ocular and 
periocular structures is rare and generally occurs in patients with disseminated 
metastasis. Orbital tissue is the most common site of involvement, and these 
patients have short life expectancy.

Nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) are the most common neoplasms worldwide. Their 
incidence has been continually rising. This is due to several risk factors such 
as chronic sun exposure, longer life expectancy, sun-damaged skin, genetic 
predisposition, and immunosuppression. NMSCs are curable cancers if detected 
early and treated appropriately. Clinical examination is the first step towards 
their diagnosis, with accuracy depending on clinician expertise. Dermoscopy has 
become an irreplaceable diagnostic procedure for clinical examination and 
improving diagnostic accuracy of skin cancers. However, skin biopsy with 
histopathological analysis remains the gold standard in establishing a definite 
diagnosis. Repeated biopsies, however, are not acceptable in patients with 
multiple suspicious lesions and are often redundant in cases of lesions that are 
challenging to identify, as they are often benign. Several medical imaging 
technologies are available as additional tools for noninvasive examination of 
NMSCs and include reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), high-frequency 
ultrasound (HFUS), optical coherence tomography (OCT), Raman spectroscopy, 
fluorescence polarization, and others. These methods enable clinicians to 
establish more rapid and accurate diagnoses without the need for invasive 
biopsies and to achieve optimal treatment for NMSC. RCM an HFUS are discussed 
along with their clinical applications.

Studies show that raising the minimum wage in a US state above the federal 
minimum wage can reduce infant mortality rates in those states. Some states have 
raised their minimum wage in recent decades, while many others did not, and have 
prohibited local authorities from doing so by enacting preemption laws. This 
study investigates how the recent emergence of state preemption laws that remove 
local authority to raise the minimum wage has affected infant mortality rates. 
Using county- and state- level data spanning 2001 through 2018, this study 
models infant mortality rates as a function of minimum wage levels, controlling 
for confounders. The estimated model, combined with information on the timing, 
location, and level of preempted minimum wages, is then used to estimate the 
number of infant deaths that occurred in 2018 that could be attributed to state 
preemption of local minimum wage increases. In the 9 largest (pop. > 250,000) 
metro counties most directly affected by state preemption, we estimate that in 
2018, 25 infant deaths were attributable to preemption. This equates to a 5.4% 
reduction in these counties' infant mortality rate. When considering all large 
metro counties in preemption states, as many as 605 infant deaths could be 
attributed to preemption. State preemption laws that remove local authority to 
enact health-promoting legislation, such as minimum wage increases, are a 
significant threat to population health. The growing tide of these laws, 
particularly since 2010, may be contributing to recent troubling trends in US 
life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes represents a continuing healthcare challenge, and 
choosing cost-effective treatments is crucial to ensure that healthcare 
resources are used efficiently. The present analysis assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus empagliflozin 25 mg 
for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate 
glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy from a healthcare payer perspective 
in the UK.
METHODS: Outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE 
Diabetes Model. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects of 
initiation of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg were based on 
an indirect comparison conducted using patient-level data, as there is currently 
no head-to-head clinical trial comparing these therapies. Modelled patients 
received treatments until glycated haemoglobin exceeded 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), at 
which point patients initiated basal insulin. The analysis captured pharmacy 
costs and costs of diabetes-related complications, expressed in 2019 pounds 
sterling (GBP). Projected outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually. Scenario 
analyses were prepared to assess uncertainty around projected outcomes.
RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated with increases in life 
expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.12 years and 0.23 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, compared with empagliflozin 
25 mg. Projected improvements in quality and duration of life resulted from a 
reduced cumulative incidence and a delayed time to onset of diabetes-related 
complications. Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with increased pharmacy 
costs, but this was partially offset by avoided costs of treating complications. 
Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with an increase in costs of GBP 1017 per 
patient, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 4439 per QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSION: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was projected to be a cost-effective 
treatment option from a healthcare payer perspective compared with empagliflozin 
25 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK setting.

BACKGROUND: Yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius) is a broadleaf host plant suitable 
for rearing the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood). Here, 
the possibility of using yacon as an alternative host plant for production of 
the parasitoid, Encarsia formosa Gahan, one of the most important natural 
enemies of whiteflies, was explored. Data on the demographic characteristics, 
parasitism rate, and host-feeding rate were collected and analyzed using the 
TWOSEX-MSChart, CONSUME-MSChart, and TIMING-MSChart computer programs, and then 
contrasted with comparable data from the more commonly utilized host plant, 
tobacco.
RESULTS: Higher fecundity (F) (190.13 eggs/female) and more oviposition days (Od 
) (16.60 days) were observed in E. formosa when yacon was used as the host plant 
for rearing T. vaporariorum, compared with when tobacco was used (F = 150.13 
eggs/female, Od = 15.27 days). The intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate 
of increase (λ), and net reproduction rate (R0 ) were significantly higher in E. 
formosa parasitizing T. vaporariorum reared on yacon compared with those 
parasitizing tobacco-reared T. vaporariorum. Furthermore, the net host-feeding 
rate (C0 = 40.87 prey/parasitoid), net killing rate (Z0 = 239.73 
prey/parasitoid), and finite killing rate ( υ  = 0.2560/day) for E. formosa on 
yacon-reared whiteflies were significantly higher than those from tobacco-reared 
whiteflies.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that yacon is more suitable than tobacco as a 
host plant for mass-rearing E. formosa for biological control programs to manage 
whiteflies. An innovative application of the multinomial theorem for calculating 
the exact probability of bootstrap samples in life table research was also 
introduced. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

Cochlear implants are currently the most effective treatment for profound 
sensorineural hearing loss. However, their therapeutic effect is limited by the 
survival and proper physiological function of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), 
which are targeted by the cochlear implant. It is therefore critical to explore
