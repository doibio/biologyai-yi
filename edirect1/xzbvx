Ageing represents an extremely current issue globally, and involves especially 
European populations. It is estimated that in Europe by the year 2025, about a 
third of the population will be over 60 years of age, hence the imperative for 
"healthy ageing". Vaccinations in seniors, in contrast with paediatric 
vaccinations, are very often neglected even by health care workers. This article 
aims to provide an evidence-based guide to establish vaccinations in seniors as 
one of the pillars of Public Health in the future.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurologic disorder with significant 
impacts on quality of life, life expectancy, and economic burden. Although there 
are no fully restorative treatments yet available, several animal and 
small-scale clinical studies have highlighted the therapeutic potential of 
cellular interventions for SCI. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-which are 
conventionally isolated from the bone marrow-recently emerged as promising 
candidates for treating SCI and have been shown to provide trophic support, 
ameliorate inflammatory responses, and reduce cell death following the 
mechanical trauma. Here we evaluated the human skin as an alternative source of 
adult MSCs suitable for autologous cell transplantation strategies for SCI. We 
showed that human skin-derived MSCs (hSD-MSCs) express a range of neural markers 
under standard culture conditions and are able to survive and respond to 
neurogenic stimulation in vitro. In addition, using histological analysis and 
behavioral assessment, we demonstrated as a proof-of-principle that hSD-MSC 
transplantation reduces the severity of tissue loss and facilitates locomotor 
recovery in a rat model of SCI. Altogether, the study provides further 
characterization of skin-derived MSC cultures and indicates that the human skin 
may represent an attractive source for cell-based therapies for SCI and other 
neurological disorders. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the 
mechanisms by which hSD-MSCs elicit tissue repair and/or locomotor recovery.

BACKGROUND: Controversies exist about the optimal palliative management for 
patients with metastatic antropyloric adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was 
to analyse the clinical outcome for patients with gastric outlet obstruction 
syndrome and metastatic antropyloric adenocarcinoma, who underwent endoscopic 
stenting or open gastrojejunostomy, in a prospective not randomised study.
MATERIAL: The clinical course and costs for 70 patients who had endoscopic 
stenting and for 30 patients who had in the same period a gastrojejunostomy for 
gastric outlet obstruction syndrome due to metastatic adenocarcinoma of the 
antropyloric region were prospectively analysed.
RESULTS: Hospital stay and time to resume oral feeding was shorter in patients 
who had endoscopic stenting (p < 0.05). Overall costs for endoscopic stenting 
were lower than those for gastrojejunostomy (11,000 versus 21,000 euros). 
Comparing patients who survived more than 6 months, costs between endoscopic 
stenting and gastrojejunostomy were similar (21,000 versus 22,000 euros).
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic placement of metallic stents offers an effective therapy 
in patients with advanced primay adenocarcinoma of the antropyloric region and 
poor general conditions. In patients with longer life expectancy, surgical 
gastroenterostomy has still a major role. In contrast to previous reports, costs 
for endoscopic stenting are similar to those of gastrojejunostomy in patients 
with longer life expectancy. Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy has the theoretical 
advantage to reduce these costs with a less invasive procedure. Results for 
endoscopic stenting have improved significantly in recent years.

BACKGROUND: In phase 1 trials, an important entry criterion is life expectancy 
predicted to be more than 90 days, which is generally difficult to predict. The 
Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) prognostic score that is determined by lactate 
dehydrogenase level, albumin level, and number of metastatic sites of disease 
was developed to help project patient outcomes. There have been no systematic 
analyses to evaluate the utility of the RMH prognostic score for esophagogastric 
cancer patients.
METHODS: All nonpediatric phase 1 oncology trials sponsored by the National 
Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program that began between 2001 and 
2013 were considered in this review.
RESULTS: Of 4722 patients with solid tumors, 115 patients were eligible for our 
analysis; 54 (47 %) with cancer of the esophagus, 14 (12 %) with cancer of the 
esopagogastric junction, and 47 (41 %) with stomach cancer. Eighty-six patients 
(75 %) had a good RMH prognostic score (0 or 1) and 29 patients (25 %) had a 
poor RMH prognostic score (2 or 3). Disease control rates were significantly 
different between patients with good and poor RMH prognostic scores (49 % vs 
17 %; two-sided Fisher's exact test P = 0.004). The median treatment duration 
and overall survival for good and poor RMH prognostic score patients were 
significantly different (median treatment duration 2.1 months vs 1.2 months 
respectively, P = 0.016; median overall survival 10.9 months vs 2.1 months 
respectively, P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, age (60 years or older), 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (2 or greater), and the 
RMH prognostic score (2 or 3) were significant predictors of poor survival.
CONCLUSIONS: The RMH prognostic score is a strong tool to predict the prognosis 
of esophagogastric cancer patients who might participate in a phase 1 trial.

Kidney supportive care describes multiple interventions for patients with 
advanced CKD that focus on improving the quality of life and addressing what 
matters most to patients. This includes shared decision making and aligning 
treatment plans with patient goals through advance care planning and providing 
relief from pain and other distressing symptoms. Kidney supportive care is an 
essential component of quality care throughout the illness trajectory. However, 
in the context of limited health care resources, evidence of its 
cost-effectiveness is required to support decisions regarding appropriate 
resource allocation. We review the literature and outline the evidence gaps and 
particular issues associated with measuring the costs, benefits, and 
cost-effectiveness of kidney supportive care. We find evidence that the dominant 
evaluative framework of a cost per quality-adjusted life year may not be 
suitable for evaluations in this context and that relevant outcomes may include 
broader measures of patient wellbeing, having care aligned with treatment 
preferences, and family satisfaction with the end of life care experience. To 
improve the evidence base for the cost-effectiveness of kidney supportive care, 
large prospective cohort studies are recommended to collect data on both 
resource use and health outcomes and should include patients who receive 
conservative kidney management without dialysis. Linkage to administrative 
datasets, such as Medicare, Hospital Episode Statistics, and the Pharmaceutical 
Benefits Scheme for prescribed medicines, can provide a detailed estimate of 
publicly funded resource use and reduce the burden of data collection for 
patients and families. Longitudinal collection of quality of life and functional 
status should be added to existing cohort or kidney registry studies. 
Interventions that improve health outcomes for people with advanced CKD, such as 
kidney supportive care, not only have the potential to improve quality of life, 
but also may reduce the high costs associated with unwanted hospitalization and 
intensive medical treatments.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly prevalent endocrine metabolic 
disorder and is presently considered a family pathology. It is associated with 
obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Racial, ethnic and 
environmental factors may be important in determining the clinical 
manifestations of this syndrome. Polycystic ovary syndrome is an exclusion 
diagnosis and, therefore, should be distinguished from the physiological changes 
typical for the age and from other hyperandrogenic disorders. Early diagnosis is 
important since this syndrome is associated with reproductive, oncologic and 
metabolic risks. Interestingly, the clinical features of this disorder may 
change throughout the lifespan of a PCOS woman, starting from adolescence to 
postmenopausal age. During the first decades of life the main features are in 
the reproductive area, while later in life metabolic abnormalities are more 
evident. While the assessment of insulin resistance is not part of the diagnosis 
of PCOS, it has been demonstrated that this metabolic component appears early in 
life and persists over time. Moreover during puberty and pregnancy, insulin 
resistance is exacerbated. Pregnancy represents an important stage, as the 
offspring of these patients may be reprogrammed and inherit some of the 
metabolic and reproductive features of their mothers. In the present review, we 
will focus on several metabolic aspects of the PCOS condition at different 
stages of life in a Chilean population.

BACKGROUND: Although pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have been available 
for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by Streptococcus 
pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) for over a decade, their adoption into national 
immunization programmes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is still 
limited. Economic evaluations (EEs) play a crucial role in support of 
evidence-informed decisions.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to provide a critical summary of EEs of 
PCVs and identify key drivers of EE findings in LMICs.
METHODS: We searched Scopus, ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Embase and Cochrane 
Central from their inception to 30 September 2015 and limited the search to 
LMICs. The search was undertaken using the search strings 'pneumococc* AND 
conjugat* AND (vaccin* OR immun*)' AND 'economic OR cost-effectiveness OR 
cost-benefit OR cost-utility OR cost-effectiveness OR cost-benefit OR 
cost-utility' in the abstract, title or keyword fields. To be included, each 
study had to be a full EE of a PCV and conducted for an LMIC. Studies were 
extracted and reviewed by two authors. The review involved standard extraction 
of the study overview or the characteristics of the study, key drivers or 
parameters of the EE, assumptions behind the analyses and major areas of 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: Out of 134 records identified, 22 articles were included. Seven studies 
used a Markov model for analysis, while 15 studies used a decision-tree analytic 
model. Eighteen studies performed a cost-utility analysis (CUA), with 
disability-adjusted life-years, quality-adjusted life-years or life-years gained 
as a measure of health outcome, while four studies focused only on 
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). Both CEA and CUA findings were provided by 
eight studies. Herd effects and serotype replacement were considered in 10 and 
13 studies, respectively. The current evidence shows that both the 10-valent and 
13-valent PCVs are probably cost effective in comparison with the 7-valent PCV 
or no vaccination. The most influential parameters were vaccine efficacy and 
coverage (in 16 of 22 studies), vaccine price (in 13 of 22 studies), disease 
incidence (in 11 of 22 studies), mortality from IPD and pneumonia (in 8 of 22 
studies) and herd effects (in 4 of 22 studies). The findings were found to be 
supportive of the products owned by the manufacturers.
CONCLUSION: Our review demonstrated that an infant PCV programme was a 
cost-effective intervention in most LMICs (in 20 of 22 studies included). The 
results were sensitive to vaccine efficacy, price, burden of disease and 
sponsorship. Decision makers should consider EE findings and affordability 
before adoption of PCVs.

OBJECTIVE: To measure efficiency gains in health sector over the years 1995 to 
2013 in OECD, EU, non-member European countries.
METHODS: An output-oriented DEA model with variable return to scale, and 
residuals estimated by regression equations were used to estimate efficiencies 
of health systems. Slacks for health care outputs and inputs were calculated by 
using DEA multistage method of estimating country efficiency scores.
RESULTS: Better health outcomes of countries were related with higher 
efficiency. Japan, France, or Sweden were found to be peer-efficient countries 
when compared to other developed countries like Germany and United States. 
Increasing life expectancy beyond a certain high level becomes very difficult to 
achieve. Despite declining marginal productivity of inputs on health outcomes, 
some developed countries and developing countries were found to have lowered 
their inefficiencies in the use of health inputs. Although there was no 
systematic relationship between political system of countries and health system 
efficiency, the objectives of countries on social and health policy and the way 
of achieving these objectives might be a factor increasing the efficiency of 
health systems.
CONCLUSIONS: Economic and political stability might be as important as health 
expenditure in improving health system goals. A better understanding of the 
value created by health expenditures, especially in developed countries, will 
require analysis of specific health interventions that can increase value for 
money in health. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic biomarkers of aging (the "epigenetic clock") have the 
potential to address puzzling findings surrounding mortality rates and incidence 
of cardio-metabolic disease such as: (1) women consistently exhibiting lower 
mortality than men despite having higher levels of morbidity; (2) racial/ethnic 
groups having different mortality rates even after adjusting for socioeconomic 
differences; (3) the black/white mortality cross-over effect in late adulthood; 
and (4) Hispanics in the United States having a longer life expectancy than 
Caucasians despite having a higher burden of traditional cardio-metabolic risk 
factors.
RESULTS: We analyzed blood, saliva, and brain samples from seven different 
racial/ethnic groups. We assessed the intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration of 
blood (independent of blood cell counts) and the extrinsic epigenetic aging 
rates of blood (dependent on blood cell counts and tracks the age of the immune 
system). In blood, Hispanics and Tsimane Amerindians have lower intrinsic but 
higher extrinsic epigenetic aging rates than Caucasians. African-Americans have 
lower extrinsic epigenetic aging rates than Caucasians and Hispanics but no 
differences were found for the intrinsic measure. Men have higher epigenetic 
aging rates than women in blood, saliva, and brain tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: Epigenetic aging rates are significantly associated with sex, 
race/ethnicity, and to a lesser extent with CHD risk factors, but not with 
incident CHD outcomes. These results may help elucidate lower than expected 
mortality rates observed in Hispanics, older African-Americans, and women.

Malignant eccrine poroma is a rare malignancy of the eccrine sweat glands, 
occurring most frequently on the lower extremities. It affects both sexes 
equally usually in the 6(th) to 7(th) decade of life. Metastasis to regional 
lymph nodes may occur in 20% that may be fatal in 60% cases. Its aggressive 
nature, rarity of occurrence, and unusual presentations make it very important 
to be evaluated properly by the clinician. We hereby report a case of a 
75-year-old female presenting with two exophytic tumors over her vulva with 
local extension. On histopathological examination, it was diagnosed as malignant 
eccrine poroma. On magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvic region, metastatic 
extension in regional lymph nodes was found. She was treated by radical 
vulvectomy with bilateral inguinal and femoral lymph node dissection followed by 
radiotherapy.

Widowhood has been increasingly encountered because of increasing longevity of 
women, often characterized by social stigmatization and poor physical and mental 
health. However, applied research to overcome its adversity has been quite 
limited. The goal of this study is to explore the role of physical activity in 
improving the health of widows.A cohort of 446,582 adults in Taiwan who 
successively participated in a comprehensive medical screening program starting 
in 1994, including 232,788 women, was followed up for mortality until 2008. Each 
individual provided detailed health history, and extensive lab tests results.The 
number of widows increased with time trend. Every other woman above age 65 was a 
widow (44%). Widows were less active, more obese, and smoked and drank more, had 
sleep problems, were more depressed with taking sedatives or psychoactive drugs, 
leading to more suicides. In the global development of health policies by World 
Health Organization (WHO), physical activity is one of the main factors to 
reverse poor health. The poor health of inactive widow was mitigated when 
becoming fully active in this study. Exercise not only reduced the observed 18% 
increase in all-cause mortality, but also gained 4 years and as much as 14% 
mortality advantage over the married but inactive. More importantly, becoming 
physically active energized their mental status, improved sleep quality and 
quantity, reduced depressions and the need for psychoactive drugs, and increased 
socialization circles.Widows, a rapidly growing and socially stigmatized group, 
suffered from social and financial inequality and tended to develop poorer 
health. Sustained physical activity could be one of the ways for them to 
overcome and reverse some of the physical and mental adversities of widowhood, 
and improve their quality and quantity of life.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) prevalence and mortality rates remain 
especially high in many parts of Africa. While effective prevention and 
treatment exist, coverage rates of the various interventions are low. Little is 
known about the comparative cost-effectiveness of different RHD interventions in 
limited resource settings. We developed an economic evaluation tool to assist 
ministries of health in allocating resources and planning RHD control programs.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a Markov model of the natural 
history of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and RHD, taking transition probabilities 
and intervention effectiveness data from previously published studies and expert 
opinion. Our model estimates the incremental cost-effectiveness of scaling up 
coverage of primary prevention (PP), secondary prevention (SP) and heart valve 
surgery (VS) interventions for RHD. We take a healthcare system perspective on 
costs and measure outcomes as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), 
discounting both at 3%. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses are 
also built into the modeling tool. We illustrate the use of this model in a 
hypothetical low-income African country, drawing on available disease burden and 
cost data. We found that, in our hypothetical country, PP would be cost saving 
and SP would be very cost-effective. International referral for VS (e.g., to a 
country like India that has existing surgical capacity) would be cost-effective, 
but building in-country VS services would not be cost-effective at typical 
low-income country thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our cost-effectiveness analysis tool is designed to 
inform priorities for ARF/RHD control programs in Africa at the national or 
subnational level. In contrast to previous literature, our preliminary findings 
suggest PP could be the most efficient and cheapest approach in poor countries. 
We provide our model for public use in the form of a Supplementary File. Our 
research has immediate policy relevance and calls for renewed efforts to scale 
up RHD prevention.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend supervised exercise therapy (SET) as 
the preferred initial treatment for patients with intermittent claudication. The 
availability of SET programmes is, however, limited and such programmes are 
often not reimbursed. Evidence for the long-term cost-effectiveness of SET 
compared with endovascular revascularization (ER) as primary treatment for 
intermittent claudication might aid widespread adoption in clinical practice.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to determine the incremental costs, 
incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of SET versus ER for a hypothetical cohort of patients 
with newly diagnosed intermittent claudication, from the Dutch healthcare 
payer's perspective. In the event of primary treatment failure, possible 
secondary interventions were repeat ER, open revascularization or major 
amputation. Data sources for model parameters included original data from two 
RCTs, as well as evidence from the medical literature. The robustness of the 
results was tested with probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Considering a 5-year time horizon, probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
revealed that SET was associated with cost savings compared with ER (-€6412, 95 
per cent credibility interval (CrI) -€11 874 to -€1939). The mean difference in 
effectiveness was -0·07 (95 per cent CrI -0·27 to 0·16) QALYs. ER was associated 
with an additional €91 600 per QALY gained compared with SET. One-way 
sensitivity analysis indicated more favourable cost-effectiveness for ER in 
subsets of patients with low quality-of-life scores at baseline.
CONCLUSION: SET is a more cost-effective primary treatment for intermittent 
claudication than ER. These results support implementation of supervised 
exercise programmes in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: In response to the rising threat of resistance to first-line 
antibiotics for gonorrhea, international guidelines recommend dual antimicrobial 
therapy. However, some countries continue to recommend monotherapy. We assess 
the cost-effectiveness of dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin 
compared with monotherapy with ceftriaxone, for control of gonorrhea among men 
who have sex with men in the Netherlands.
METHODS: We developed a transmission model and calculated the numbers of new 
gonorrhea infections, consultations at health care specialists, tests, and 
antibiotic doses. With these numbers, we calculated costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALY) with each treatment; and the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of dual therapy compared to monotherapy. The impact of gonorrhea on 
human immunodeficiency virus transmission was not included in the model.
RESULTS: In the absence of initial resistance, dual therapy can delay the spread 
of ceftriaxone resistance by at least 15 years, compared to monotherapy. In the 
beginning, when there is no resistance, dual therapy results in high additional 
costs, without any QALY gains. When resistance spreads over time, the additional 
costs of dual therapy decline, the gained QALYs increase, the ICER drops off 
and, after 50 years, falls below &OV0556;20,000 per QALY gained. If azithromycin 
resistance is initially prevalent, resistance to the first-line treatment rises 
almost equally fast with both treatment strategies and the ICER remains 
extremely high.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with ceftriaxone monotherapy, dual therapy with 
ceftriaxone and azithromycin can considerably delay the spread of ceftriaxone 
resistance, but may only be cost-effective in the long run and in the absence of 
initial resistance.

OBJECTIVE: Bleeding in ACS patients is an independent marker of adverse 
outcomes. Its prognostic impact is even worse in elderly population. Current 
bleeding risk scores include chronological age but do not consider biologic 
vulnerability. No studies have assessed the effect of frailty on major bleeding. 
The aim of this study is to determine whether frailty status increases bleeding 
risk in patients with ACS.
METHODS: This prospective and observational study included patients aged 
≥75years admitted due to type 1 myocardial infarction. Exclusion criteria were 
severe cognitive impairment, impossibility to measure handgrip strength, 
cardiogenic shock and limited life expectancy due to oncologic diseases. The 
primary endpoint was 30-day major bleeding defined as a decrease of ≥3g/dl of 
haemoglobin or need of transfusion.
RESULTS: A total of 190 patients were included. Frail patients (72, 37.9%) were 
older, with higher comorbidity features and with a higher CRUSADE score at 
admission. On univariate analysis, frailty predicted major bleeding during 
30-day follow-up despite less frequent use of a P2Y12 inhibitor (66.2% vs 83.6%, 
p=0.007) and decreased catheterisation rate (69.4% vs 94.1%, p<0.001). Major 
bleeding was associated with increased all-cause mortality at day 30 (18.2% vs 
2.5%, p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, frailty was an independent predictor 
for major bleeding.
CONCLUSION: Frailty phenotype, as a marker of biological vulnerability, is an 
independent predictor of major bleeding in elderly patients with ACS. Frailty 
can play an important role in bleeding risk stratification and objective indices 
should be integrated into routine initial evaluation of these patients.

BACKGROUND: During the last decades many successful efforts have been made in 
order to increase life expectancy in ovarian cancer (OC) patients. However, just 
a few studies have investigated the impact of OC on quality of life (QoL) and 
sexual function in OC cases during treatment.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the QoL and sexual function of 
OC patients during chemotherapy (CT).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine subjects were enrolled and filled in the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-OV28, 
Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) 
questionnaires. The results were evaluated globally and consequently stratified 
into several groups: single surgery versus multiple surgeries, age ≤48 years 
versus >48 years, and first-line CT versus multiple lines of CT.
RESULTS: Menopause-related symptoms, body image and attitude toward the disease 
were significantly worse during first-line CT (p = 0.018, p = 0.029 and p = 
0.006, respectively). Sexual outcomes resulted in better scores in younger 
patients in all questionnaires (FSFI: p = 0.001; FSDS: p = 0.048; specific EORTC 
QLQ-OV28 items: p = 0.022). Scores concerning body image, attitude toward the 
disease and CT-associated symptoms resulted worse in patients after the first 
surgery (p = 0.017, p = 0.002 and p = 0.012, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that OC has a detrimental impact on QoL and 
intimacy, particularly in younger patients, during the first course of CT and 
after the first cytoreductive surgery.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of bladder ultrasonography, 
clinical history, and urodynamic testing in guiding treatment decisions in a 
secondary care setting for women failing first line conservative treatment for 
overactive bladder or urgency-predominant mixed urinary incontinence.
DESIGN: Model-based economic evaluation from a UK National Health Service (NHS) 
perspective using data from the Bladder Ultrasound Study (BUS) and secondary 
sources.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision tree and a 5-year time 
horizon based on the outcomes of cost per woman successfully treated and cost 
per Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY). Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses, and a value of information analysis are also undertaken.
RESULTS: Bladder ultrasonography is more costly and less effective test-treat 
strategy than clinical history and urodynamics. Treatment on the basis of 
clinical history alone has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
£491,100 per woman successfully treated and an ICER of £60,200 per QALY compared 
with the treatment of all women on the basis of urodynamics. Restricting the use 
of urodynamics to women with a clinical history of mixed urinary incontinence 
only is the optimal test-treat strategy on cost-effectiveness grounds with ICERs 
of £19,500 per woman successfully treated and £12,700 per QALY compared with the 
treatment of all women based upon urodynamics. Conclusions remained robust to 
sensitivity analyses, but subject to large uncertainties.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment based upon urodynamics can be seen as a cost-effective 
strategy, and particularly when targeted at women with clinical history of mixed 
urinary incontinence only. Further research is needed to resolve current 
decision uncertainty.

Canine leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania infantum and is 
transmitted by Phlebotominae vectors. Despite numerous publications on the 
subject, some essential aspects of the epidemiology are not yet sufficiently 
clear. We proposed a stochastic model with the aim of identifying some important 
gaps in the current knowledge of leishmaniasis, such as the frequency of vector 
infection or a dog's life expectancy depending on their purpose and their health 
status. We only found that the purpose was a significant factor. Furthermore, we 
detected relationships among age, gender and habitat with the dogs' purposes 
that can affect the calculation of the overall seroprevalence of the analysed 
sample. The development of this model will allow us to discard potential 
confounding factors as gender, age, purpose or habitat.

The number of people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) reached to almost 
40 million, half of which are under antiretroviral treatment (ART). Although the 
introduction of this therapy significantly improved the life span and quality of 
PLWHA, metabolic complications of these people remains to be an important issue. 
These metabolic complications include hyperlipidemia, abnormal fat 
redistribution and diabetes mellitus, which are defined as lipodystrophy 
syndrome. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a neuropeptide secreted from 
intestinal L cells and recently developed GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) 
stimulate insulin secretion, improve weight control and reduce cardiovascular 
outcomes. This class of drugs may be a valuable medication in the treatment of 
HIV-associated metabolic adverse effects and extend the life expectancy of 
patients infected with HIV.

Long-term survival following open repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Englund R(1), Katib N(2).

Author information:

(2)Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand.

BACKGROUND: Long-term results for patients being managed for ruptured compared 
to elective abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are unclear. We hypothesize that 
patients who survive 30 days or more following repair of ruptured AAA (RAAA) 
performed by open technique have a life expectancy no different to those 
patients surviving 30 days or more following elective AAA repair, or compared to 
a general age-matched population.
METHODS: Between 1987 and December 2014, 620 consecutive patients were treated 
by the principal author for aortic aneurysmal disease. Two subgroups were 
selected from this population, elective open abdominal repair (215) and RAAA 
open repair (105). Comparable age-matched life curves with the general 
population were used from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for each patient 
according to gender, age and date of presentation. Statistical comparison was by
