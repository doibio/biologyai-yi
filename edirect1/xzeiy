modelling was conducted to compare from the healthcare perspective the 
healthcare costs of OHCA patients with the CRS being activated but no responders 
attended (CRS-NV) versus the CRS being activated with attendance of ≥1 
responder(s) (CRS-V).
RESULTS: The total average healthcare costs per patient are €42,533. The yearly 
operating costs for the CRS are approximately €1.5 million per year in the 
Netherlands. The early modelling of costs and effects showed that the 
incremental healthcare costs per patient thus were €4,131 in the CRS-V versus 
the CRS-NV group (€25,184 in the CRS-V group and €21,053 in the CRS-NV group). 
Incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was 5 per 100 patients (16 per 
100 patients in the CRS-V group versus 11 per 100 patients in the CRS-NV group). 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was €79,662 per QALY for the 
CRS-V group.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that patients in the CSR-V group had additional 
health care costs of €4,131 per patient compared to patients in the CRS-NV 
group. This increase is caused by patients surviving more often, who then 
continue to utilise health services, which results in a (logic) increase in 
healthcare costs. For future research, accurate and up-to-date data on 
effectiveness and costs of the CRS needs to be collected.

Bisphosphonates (BPs) are medications widely used in clinical practice to treat 
osteoporosis and reduce fragility fractures. Its beneficial effects on bone 
tissue have been consolidated in the literature for the last decades. They have 
a high affinity for bone hydroxyapatite crystals, and most bisphosphonates 
remain on the bone surface for a long period of time. Benefits of long-term use 
of BPs: Large and important trials (Fracture Intervention Trial Long-term 
Extension and Health Outcomes and Reduced Incidence with Zoledronic acid Once 
Yearly-Pivotal Fracture Trial) with extended use of alendronate (up to 10 years) 
and zoledronate (up to 6 years) evidenced significant gain of bone mineral 
density (BMD) and vertebral fracture risk reduction. Risks of long-term use of 
BPs: The extended use of antiresorptive therapy has drawn attention to two 
extremely rare, although severe, adverse events. That is, atypical femoral 
fracture and medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw are more common in 
patients with high cumulative doses and longer duration of therapy. BPs have 
demonstrated safety and effectiveness throughout the years and evidenced 
increased BMD and reduced fracture risks, resulting in reduced morbimortality, 
and improved quality of life. These benefits overweight the risks of rare 
adverse events.

A severe global health concern is the rising incidence and mortality rate of 
colorectal cancer (CRC). Chemotherapy, which is typically used to treat CRC, is 
known to have limited specificity and can have noticeable side effects. A 
paradigm shift in cancer treatment has been brought about by the development of 
targeted therapies, which has led to the appearance of pharmacological agents 
with improved efficacy and decreased toxicity. Epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2), and BRAF are among the molecular targets covered in this 
review that are used in targeted therapy for CRC. The current discussion also 
covers advancements in targeted therapeutic approaches, such as antibody-drug 
conjugates, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) 
T-cell therapy. A review of the clinical trials and application of these 
particular therapies in treating CRC is also done. Despite the improvements in 
targeted therapy for CRC, problems such as drug resistance and patient selection 
remain to be solved. Despite this, targeted therapies have offered fresh 
possibilities for identifying and treating CRC, paving the way for the 
development of personalized medicine and extending the life expectancy and 
general well-being of CRC patients.

The aim of this paper is to track the whereabouts of basic old-age insurance 
(BOI) contribution subsidies. Little research has paid attention to the 
misalignment between the implementation objects of subsidy policies and the 
actual beneficiaries. In recent years, local governments in China have followed 
a contribution subsidy policy to help persons with disabilities (PWDs) with 
lower life expectancies. This study applied an actuarial model to calculate the 
leakage rate of the BOI contribution subsidy. The primary data are from the life 
tables of the entire population and PWDs in K province in China in 2015. It was 
found that, under different booking interest rates, 35.27%-61.26% of the 
contribution subsidy for PWDs in the individual account will be inherited by 
their heirs, and under different discount rates, 18.21%-68.74% in the pooling 
account will be enjoyed by non-disabled participants. The policy of BOI 
contribution subsidy for PWDs failed to account for the shorter average life 
expectancy and the lower average income of PWDs and would result in a welfare 
loss for PWDs. Therefore, it was suggested that it should be replaced by a 
non-contributory pension policy for PWDs.

BACKGROUND: Compared with the general cancer population, people living with HIV 
(PLWH) and cancer are less likely to receive treatment and have significantly 
elevated cancer-specific mortality for many common cancer types. Physician 
recommendations drive the cancer therapy that patients receive, yet there is 
limited information assessing how cancer treatment decisions are made for people 
living with HIV and cancer. We sought to understand oncologist decision-making 
in PLWH and cancer by eliciting barriers, facilitators, and recommendations for 
enhancing care delivery.
SETTING: Participants were recruited between May 2019 and May 2021 from one 
academic medical center in the western United States (n = 13), another in the 
southeastern United States (n = 7), and community practices nationwide (n = 5).
METHODS: Using an inductive qualitative approach, we conducted in-depth 
interviews with 25 oncologists from two academic medical centers and community 
practices.
RESULTS: Facilitators of cancer care delivery included readily available 
information regarding HIV status and stage, interdepartmental communication, and 
antiviral therapy adherence. Barriers included a lack of formal education on HIV 
malignancies, perceptions of decreased life expectancy, fear of inadvertent 
disclosure, and drug-drug interactions. Recommendations included improved 
provider communication, patient social and mental health resources, and 
continuing education opportunities.
CONCLUSION: The study revealed drivers of cancer treatment decision-making, 
highlighting physician-reported barriers and facilitators, and recommendations 
to support treatment decision-making. This is the first known study examining 
oncologists' perceptions of caring for PLWH. Given that cancer is a leading 
cause of death among PLWH, there is an urgent need to improve care and outcomes.

The development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a significant 
factor that reduces life expectancy among patients with prostate cancer. 
Previously, it is reported that CDK4/6 inhibitors can overcome the resistance of 
CRPC to BET inhibitors by destabilizing BRD4, suggesting that the combination of 
CDK4/6 inhibitors and BET inhibitors is a promising approach for treating CRPC. 
In this study, candidates that affect the combined antitumor effect of CDK4/6 
inhibitors and BET inhibitors on CRPC is aimed to examine. The data demonstrates 
that CBX3 is abnormally upregulated in CDK4/6 inhibitors-resistant cells. CBX3 
is almost positively correlated with the cell cycle in multiple malignancies and 
is downregulated by BET inhibitors. Mechanistically, it is showed that CBX3 is 
transcriptionally upregulated by BRD4 in CRPC cells. Moreover, it is 
demonstrated that CBX3 modulated the sensitivity of CRPC to CDK4/6 inhibitors by 
binding with RB1 to release E2F1. Furthermore, it is revealed that PLK1 
phosphorylated CBX3 to enhance the interaction between RB1 and CBX3, and 
desensitize CRPC cells to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Given that BRD4 regulates CBX3 
expression and PLK1 affects the binding between RB1 and CBX3, it is proposed 
that a dual BRD4/PLK1 inhibitor can increase the sensitivity of CRPC cells to 
CDK4/6 inhibitors partially through CBX3.

Non-homogeneity in the efficiency evaluation of health systems.

Dlouhý M(1).

Author information:
(1)Faculty of Statistics and Informatics, Prague University of Economics and 
Business, Prague, Czech Republic. dlouhy@vse.cz.

BACKGROUND: An international comparison of health system performance is a 
popular tool of health policy analysis. However, the efficiency evaluation of 
health systems is a practical example of an international comparison in which 
non-homogeneity is expected. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the 
efficiency of health systems by models in which a degree of non-homogeneity 
among countries is considered.
METHODS: We study the problem of non-homogeneity of health systems in the 
theoretical framework of the data envelopment analysis (DEA), which is a popular 
method of efficiency evaluation with hundreds of applications from various 
fields. DEA assume the homogeneity of production units and the homogeneity of 
the environment in which the production units operate. Hence, we compiled a 
summary of 14 recommendations on how to deal with the non-homogeneity in the DEA 
models. The analysed sample includes 38 OECD member countries. The data are from 
the year 2019.
RESULTS: As an example, we evaluated the health system efficiency of the Czech 
Republic. We used the DEA models with the neighbourhood measure of distance and 
the constraint limiting the comparison of countries with different levels of 
economic development. The health system inputs were the numbers of physicians, 
nurses, and hospital beds. In the production of the intermediate outputs (doctor 
consultations, inpatient care discharges), the Czech Republic should look at 
Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. In the production of health outcomes (life 
expectancy), the peer countries are France, Italy and Switzerland.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the DEA analysis are only indicative because no 
single analytical method can determine whether a health system is better or 
worse than others. We need to combine different methods, and DEA is one of them. 
We consider DEA as an exploratory method, not a method providing definitive 
answers.

BACKGROUND: Nephrolithiasis is not a well-documented condition in children with 
spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). It is possible that this condition was 
underestimated before the era of nusinersen because of a much shorter life 
expectancy. We present our observational data on nephrolithiasis and its 
possible risk factors in children with type 1 SMA.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 20 children with genetically 
confirmed type 1 SMA. Thirteen patients (aged 9 to 55 months) who underwent 
urinary tract ultrasonography were included in the study. Medical records were 
retrospectively reviewed for demographic and clinical characteristics, 
ultrasound results, and metabolic abnormalities.
RESULTS: Seven children (54%) had nephrolithiasis; 5 had multiple stones and two 
had a single stone. Two patients had microlithiasis (<3 mm), three had a stone 
in the size of 3 to 5 mm, and one had a stone in the size of more than 8 mm. Two 
patients with nephrolithiasis had urinary tract abnormalities. Patients with 
nephrolithiasis were more likely to have a history of urinary tract infections 
(UTIs) (P = 0.048) and higher urine specific gravity (P = 0.014) than patients 
without nephrolithiasis. Five of seven children with nephrolithiasis had a urine 
metabolic evaluation; all had hypercalciuria, three had hyperuricosuria, but 
none had hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, or hypomagnesemia.
CONCLUSION: Children with SMA type 1 are at an increased risk for 
nephrolithiasis. Hypercalciuria and high urine specific gravity appear to be the 
most common risk factors for the occurrence of nephrolithiasis. In addition, UTI 
is more common in patients with type 1 SMA with nephrolithiasis.

AIM: To analyze the trends in ambient fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) 
and the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of diabetes attributable to it 
from 1990 to 2019 by region, country, and socio-economic development status.
METHODS: The main data, including the summary exposure value (SEV) of ambient 
PM2.5 and the ASMR of diabetes due to ambient PM2.5, was collected from the 
Global Burden of Disease 2019 database. The socio-demographic index (SDI) was 
employed for assessing a particular region or country's degree of socio-economic 
development. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to assess the changes of 
ambient PM2.5 and ASMR of diabetes attributable to it.
RESULTS: Globally, the SEV of ambient PM2.5 increased from 15.65 μg/m3 in 1990 
to 26.22 μg/m3 in 2019, with an annual average percent change (AAPC) of 1.788 
(95 % CI 1.687-1.889) μg/m3. The ASMR of diabetes attributable to ambient PM2.5 
increased from 1.57 per 100,000 population in 1990 to 2.47 per 100.000 
population in 2019 (AAPC = 1.569 [95 % CI 1.42-1.718]). Most regions and 
countries had an increase of SEV of ambient PM2.5 and ASMR of diabetes 
attributable to ambient PM2.5. The largest increase of SEV of ambient PM2.5 was 
observed in South Asia (AAPC = 3.556 [95 % CI 3.329-3.875]), while the largest 
increase of ASMR of diabetes was in Central Asia (AAPC = 5.170 [95%CI 
4.696-5.647]). Moreover, the increase of SEV of ambient PM2.5 and ASMR of 
diabetes attributable to it were positively associated with SDI in low SDI 
countries (SDI < 0.46), whereas the opposite result was observed when 
SDI ≥ 0.46.
CONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2019, the population's exposure to ambient PM2.5 and 
ASMR of diabetes attributable to it increased generally, especially in 
low-middle SDI regions. Ambient PM2.5 remains a threat to global health. Greater 
investment in ambient PM2.5 and the mortality attributable to it are needed.

Tissue engineering is an advanced and potential biomedical approach to treat 
patients suffering from lost or failed an organ or tissue to repair and 
regenerate damaged tissues that increase life expectancy. The biopolymers have 
been used to fabricate smart hydrogels to repair damaged tissue as they imitate 
the extracellular matrix (ECM) with intricate structural and functional 
characteristics. These hydrogels offer desired and controllable qualities, such 
as tunable mechanical stiffness and strength, inherent adaptability and 
biocompatibility, swellability, and biodegradability, all crucial for tissue 
engineering. Smart hydrogels provide a superior cellular environment for tissue 
engineering, enabling the generation of cutting-edge synthetic tissues due to 
their special qualities, such as stimuli sensitivity and reactivity. Numerous 
review articles have presented the exceptional potential of hydrogels for 
various biomedical applications, including drug delivery, regenerative medicine, 
and tissue engineering. Still, it is essential to write a comprehensive review 
article on smart hydrogels that successfully addresses the essential challenging 
issues in tissue engineering. Hence, the recent development on smart hydrogel 
for state-of-the-art tissue engineering conferred progress, highlighting 
significant challenges and future perspectives. This review discusses recent 
advances in smart hydrogels fabricated from biological macromolecules and their 
use for advanced tissue engineering. It also provides critical insight, 
emphasizing future research directions and progress in tissue engineering.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Various total disc replacement (TDR) designs have been 
compared to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with favorable short 
and long-term outcomes in FDA-approved investigational device exemption (IDE) 
trials. The unique design of M6-C, with a compressible viscoelastic nuclear core 
and an annular structure, has previously demonstrated favorable clinical 
outcomes through 24 months.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of the M6-C 
compressible artificial cervical disc and compare to ACDF at 5 years.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, concurrently and historically 
controlled, FDA-approved IDE clinical trial.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Subjects with one-level symptomatic degenerative cervical 
radiculopathy were enrolled and received M6-C (n = 160) or ACDF (n = 189) 
treatment as part of the IDE study. Safety outcomes were evaluated at 5 years 
for all subjects. The primary effectiveness endpoint was available at 5 years 
for 113 M6-C subjects and 106 ACDF controls.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint of this analysis was composite clinical 
success (CCS) at 60 months. Secondary endpoints were function and pain (Neck 
Disability Index, VAS), physical quality of life (SF-36, SF-12), safety, 
neurologic, and radiographic assessments.
METHODS: Propensity score subclassification was used to control for selection 
bias and match baseline covariates of the control group to the M6-C subjects. 
Sixty-month CCS rates were estimated for each treatment group using a 
generalized linear model controlling for propensity score.
RESULTS: At 5 years post-operatively, the M6-C treatment resulted in 82.3% CCS 
while the ACDF group showed 67.0% CCS (superiority p = 0.013). Secondary 
endpoints indicated that significantly more M6-C subjects achieved VAS neck and 
arm pain improvements and showed maintained or improved physical functioning on 
quality of life measures compared to baseline assessments. The M6-C group 
maintained flexion-extension motion, with significantly greater increases from 
baseline disc height and disc angle than observed in the control group. The 
rates of M6-C subsequent surgical interventions (SSI; 3.1%) and definitely 
device- or procedure-related serious adverse events (SAE failure; 3.1%) were 
similar to ACDF rates (SSI = 5.3%, SAE failure = 4.8%; p > 0.05 for both).
CONCLUSIONS: Subjects treated with the M6-C artificial disc demonstrated 
superior 5-year achievement of clinical success when compared to ACDF controls. 
In addition, significantly more subjects in the M6-C group showed improved pain 
and physical functioning scores than observed in ACDF subjects, with no 
difference in re-operation rates or safety outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a heterogeneous group 
of disorders associated with decreased fetal movement, with a prevalence between 
1/3000 and 1/5200 live births. Typical features of AMC include multiple joint 
contractures present at birth, and can affect all joints of the body, from the 
jaw, and involving the upper limbs, lower limbs and spine. The jaws may be 
affected in 25 % of individuals with AMC, with limited jaw movement and mouth 
opening. Other oral and maxillofacial deformities may be present in AMC, 
including cleft palate, micrognathia, periodontitis and delayed teething. To our 
knowledge, oral and maxillofacial abnormalities have not been systematically 
assessed in individuals with AMC. Therefore, this scoping review was conducted 
to identify, collect, and describe a comprehensive map of the existing knowledge 
on dental and maxillofacial involvement in individuals with AMC.
METHODOLOGY: A scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping 
Reviews guidelines. The PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews were followed and 
databases were searched for empirical articles in English and French published 
until October 2022. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and ERIC 
databases. Two authors independently reviewed the articles and extracted the 
data.
RESULTS: Of a total of 997 studies that were identified, 96 met the inclusion 
criteria and were subsequently included in this scoping review. These 96 studies 
collectively provided insights into 167 patients who exhibited some form of oral 
and/or maxillofacial involvement. Notably, 25 % of these patients were within 
the age range of 0-6 months. It is worth highlighting that only 22 out of the 96 
studies (22.9 %), had the primary objective of evaluating dental and/or 
maxillofacial deformities. Among the patients studied, a prevalent pattern 
emerged, revealing that severe anomalies such as micrognathia (56 %), 
high-arched palate (29 %), cleft palate (40 %), limited mouth opening (31 %), 
and dental anomalies (28 %) were frequently observed. Importantly, many of these 
patients were found to have more than one of these anomalies. Even though these 
maxillofacial impairments are known to be associated with dental problems (e.g., 
cleft palate is associated with oligodontia, hypodontia, and malocclusion), 
their secondary effects on the dental phenotype were not reported in the 
studies.
CONCLUSION: Our findings have uncovered a notable deficiency in existing 
literature concerning dental and maxillofacial manifestations in AMC. This 
underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and the undertaking of 
extensive prospective cohort studies focused on AMC. These studies should assess 
the oral and maxillofacial abnormalities that can impact daily functioning and 
overall quality of life.

PURPOSE: Frailty was indicated to be closely related to older adults' 
lifestyles, especially in nutrition-related factors (such as balanced diet and 
oral functions), physical factors, and social factors in our previous study. 
Here, we developed an "Eleven-Check" (EC) questionnaire containing the 
aforementioned three factors. This study tested whether the EC questionnaire can 
estimate frailty in community-dwelling older adults.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sample comprised 1,523 independent older 
adults. The primary outcome of frailty was assessed using the Cardiovascular 
Health Study index. The secondary outcome of sarcopenia was assessed by the 
criteria of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019. The EC questionnaire 
comprised 11 dichotomous factors related to nutrition-related (diet and oral 
functions), physical, and social factors.
RESULTS: Frailty prevalence was 8.5 % (76.1 ± 5.8y, 45.1 % women). The accuracy 
of the EC questionnaire for frailty was optimal when the total scores of 4/5 
were used as the threshold. Compared to the low-risk group (<5), the high-risk 
group (≥5) had a significant association between frailty with an adjusted odds 
ratio (aOR) of 4.68 (95 %CI, 3.10-7.05). Moreover, the high-risk group also had 
a significant association with sarcopenia, with an aOR of 1.82 (1.27-2.61).
CONCLUSIONS: For community-dwelling older adults, the EC questionnaire was able 
to simply screen frailty and sarcopenia status. Further, it might raise older 
adults' self-awareness from a multifaceted perspective in their daily life to 
prevent steady decline and frailty sustainably in a community setting.

OBJECTIVE: Aging becomes the most predominant risk factor for all age-associated 
pathological conditions with the increase of life expectancy and the aggravation 
of social aging. Slowing down the speed of aging is considered an effective way 
to improve health, but so far, effective anti-aging methods are relatively 
lacking.
METHODS: Anemonin (ANE) was screened from eight existing small-molecule 
compounds by cell viability assay. The function of ANE was determined by the 
analysis of cell proliferation, β -galactosidase (SA-β -Gal) activity, cell 
cycle, SASP secretion, NAD+/NADH ratio, and other aging-related indicators. The 
targets of ANE were predicted by Drug Target Prediction System (DTPS) and Swiss 
Targe Prediction System. The effect of ANE on PARP-1-NAD+-SIRT1 signaling 
pathway was assessed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, PARP1, NAD+ and SIRT1 activity detection.
RESULTS: ANE can delay cell senescence; PARP1 is one of the targets of ANE and 
plays a crucial role in ANE anti-aging; ANE release more NAD+ by inhibiting 
PARP1 activity, thereby conversely promoting the function of SIRT1 and delay 
cell senescence.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that ANE can delay cellular senescence through 
the PARP1-NAD+-SIRT1 signaling pathway, which may be considered as an effective 
anti-aging strategy.

BACKGROUND: Injectable cabotegravir was superior to daily oral tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine for HIV prevention in two clinical 
trials. Both trials had the primary aim of establishing the HIV prevention 
efficacy of long-acting injectable cabotegravir pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) 
compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine daily oral PrEP. 
Long-acting PrEP was associated with diagnostic delays and integrase 
strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI) resistance. This report presents findings from 
the first unblinded year of the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 083 study.
METHODS: The HPTN 083 randomised controlled trial enrolled HIV-uninfected 
cisgender men and transgender women at elevated HIV risk who have sex with men, 
from 43 clinical research sites in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the USA. 
Inclusion criteria included: a negative HIV serological test at the screening 
and study entry, undetectable HIV RNA levels within 14 days of study entry, age 
18 years or older, overall good health as determined by clinical and laboratory 
evaluations, and a creatinine clearance of 60 mL/min or higher. Participants 
were randomly allocated to receive long-acting injectable cabotegravir or daily 
oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine PrEP. After study 
unblinding, participants remained on their original regimen awaiting an 
extension study. HIV infections were characterised retrospectively at a central 
laboratory. Here we report the secondary analysis of efficacy and safety for the 
first unblinded year. The primary outcome was incident HIV infection. Efficacy 
analyses were done on the modified intention-to-treat population using a Cox 
regression model. Adverse events were compared across treatment groups and time 
periods (blinded vs unblinded). This trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02720094.
FINDINGS: Of the 4488 participants who contributed person-time to the blinded 
analysis, 3290 contributed person-time to the first unblinded year analysis 
between May 15, 2020, and May 14, 2021. Updated HIV incidence in the blinded 
phase was 0·41 per 100 person-years for long-acting injectable cabotegravir PrEP 
and 1·29 per 100 person-years for daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus 
emtricitabine PrEP (hazard ratio [HR] 0·31 [95% CI 0·17-0·58], p=0·0003). HIV 
incidence in the first unblinded year was 0·82 per 100 person-years for 
long-acting PrEP and 2·27 per 100 person-years for daily oral PrEP (HR 0·35 
[0·18-0·69], p=0·002). Adherence to both study products decreased after study 
unblinding. Additional infections in the long-acting PrEP group included two 
with on-time injections; three with one or more delayed injections; two detected 
with long-acting PrEP reinitiation; and 11 more than 6 months after their last 
injection. Infection within 6 months of cabotegravir exposure was associated 
with diagnostic delays and INSTI resistance. Adverse events were generally 
consistent with previous reports; incident hypertension in the long-acting PrEP 
group requires further investigation.
INTERPRETATION: Long-acting injectable cabotegravir PrEP retained high efficacy 
for HIV prevention in men and transgender women who have sex with men during the 
first year of open-label follow-up, with a near-identical HR for HIV risk 
reduction between long-acting injectable cabotegravir and daily oral tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine PrEP during the first year after 
unblinding compared with the blinded period. Extended follow-up further defined 
the risk period for diagnostic delays and emergence of INSTI resistance.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a simulation study to quantify the health inequality 
impact of a cancer therapy given cancer and treatment characteristics using the 
distributional cost-effectiveness framework.
METHODS: The following factors were varied in 10,000 simulations: lifetime risk 
of the disease, median overall survival (OS) with standard of care (SOC), 
difference in OS between Non-Hispanic (NH)-Black and NH-White patients 
(prognostic effect), treatment effect of the new therapy relative to SOC, 
whether the treatment effect differs between NH-Black and NH-White patients 
(effect-modification), health utility, drug costs, and pre- and post-progression 
costs. Based on these characteristics the incremental population net health 
benefits were calculated for the new therapy and applied to a United States 
distribution of quality-adjusted life expectancy at birth (QALE). The health 
inequality impact was quantified as the difference in the degree of inequality 
in the "post new therapy" versus "pre new therapy" QALE distributions.
RESULTS: For cancer types characterized by relatively large lifetime risk, large 
median OS with SOC, large treatment effect, and large effect-modification, the 
direction of the impact of the new therapy on inequality is easy to predict. 
When effect-modification is minor or absent, which is a realistic scenario, the 
direction of the inequality impact is difficult to predict. Larger incremental 
drug costs have a worsening effect on health inequality.
CONCLUSION: The findings provide a guide to help decision-makers and other 
stakeholders make an initial assessment whether a new therapy with known 
treatment effects for a specific tumor type can have a positive or negative 
health inequality impact.
