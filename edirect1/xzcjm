Medical progress, the improvement of general living conditions, and an increase 
in life expectancy have led to an increase in the general prevalence of 
oncologic disease. More importantly, more and more patients survive cancer or 
live with the disease for long periods of time. While the battle for 
survivorship is continuously being fought, improving patients' quality of life 
has come to the fore. Psychosocial issues may modulate the course of the 
disease, but mainly have a deep impact on patients' physical and mental 
wellbeing. Psycho-oncology has risen as a relatively new interdisciplinary field 
with the aim of addressing these issues and providing support for patients 
confronting numerous challenges throughout the different stages of the disease. 
In this article, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of body-mind 
interactions in cancer and an outline of the broad spectrum of psycho-oncologic 
care, with a special focus on the treatment of pain, fatigue, sexual issues, and 
fear of progression.

Publisher: El progreso de la medicina, la mejora de las condiciones de vida en 
general y el aumento en la expectativa de vida han llevado a un incremento en la 
prevalencia de la enfermedad oncológica. Más importante aún es que, más y más 
pacientes sobreviven al cáncer o viven con la enfermedad por largos períodos de 
tiempo. Mientras que la batalla por la supervivencia se libra continuamente, la 
mejora en la calidad de vida de los pacientes ha pasado a primer plano. Los 
aspectos psicosociales pueden modular el curso de la enfermedad, pero tienen 
principalmente un profundo impacto en el bienestar físico y mental de los 
pacientes. La psico-oncología ha surgido hace poco como un campo 
interdisciplinario con el objetivo de abordar estos temas y dar soporte a los 
pacientes para que enfrenten numerosos desafíos a través de las diferentes 
etapas de la enfermedad. En este artículo se entrega una visión general del 
conocimiento actual de las interacciones cuerpo-mente en cáncer y un perfil del 
amplio espectro de los cuidados psico-oncológicos, con un foco especial en el 
tratamiento del dolor, la fatiga, temas sexuales y el temor al avance de la 
enfermedad.

Depression and diabetes.

Switzerland.

The comorbidity of mental and physical disorders is a major challenge for health 
care worldwide. Its prevalence is increasing and is likely to continue to grow 
due to the increase in life expectancy and a variety of other reasons. The 
comorbidity of depression and diabetes can be seen as a prototypical example of 
mental/physical comorbidity. The prevalence of both conditions is growing, and 
depression is twice as frequent in people with diabetes compared with those 
without diabetes. Health services are by and large inadequately prepared to deal 
with comorbid depression and diabetes, and the increasing specialization (and 
fragmentation) of medicine will probably make things worse. This paper reviews 
the epidemiology and risk factors of the comorbidity of depression and diabetes 
and describes areas that should be given attention in order to reduce problems 
arising as a result of the comorbidity of these two conditions.

Publisher: La comorbilidad de los trastornos mentales y físicos constituye un 
gran desafío para la atención de salud en todo el mundo. Su prevalencia está

depresión y diabetes puede ser vista como un ejemplo prototípico de la 
comorbilidad física/mental. La prevalencia de ambas condiciones está creciendo, 
y la depresión es dos veces más frecuente en personas con diabetes en 
comparación con las no-diabéticas. En general, los servicios de salud no están 
preparados para enfrentar adecuadamente la depresión y la diabetes comórbidas, y 
el aumento de la espetialización (y fragmentación) de la medicina probablemente 
empeorará las cosas. Este artículo revisa la epidemiología y los factores de 
riesgo de la comorbilidad de depresión y diabetes, y describe áreas en las que 
hay que poner atención para reducir los problemas que surgen como resultado de 
la comorbilidad de estas dos condiciones.

Mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit marked differences in life 
expectancy depending on their genotype and sex. The assessment of frailty could 
provide a measure of healthspan to facilitate comparisons between different AD 
models. We used a validated mouse frailty index (FI) assessment tool to explore 
genotype and sex differences in lifespan and healthspan of 3xTg-AD mice and 
their B6129F2 wild-type (WT) controls. This tool is based on an approach 
commonly used in people and quantifies frailty by counting the accumulation of 
age-related health deficits. The number of deficits in an individual divided by 
the total number measured yields an FI score theoretically between 0 and 1, with 
higher scores denoting more frailty. Male 3xTg-AD mice aged 300-600 days had 
higher FI scores (Mean FI = 0.21 ± 0.03) than either male WT (Mean FI = 0.15 ± 
0.01) or female 3xTg-AD mice (Mean FI = 0.10 ± 0.01), and the elevated frailty 
scores were accompanied by parallel increases in mortality. Frailty increased 
exponentially with age, and higher rates of deficit accumulation elevated 
mortality risk in all groups of mice. When mice were stratified by FI score, 
frailty predicted mortality, at least in females. Therefore, the mouse clinical 
FI provides a valuable tool for evaluating healthspan in mouse models of AD with 
different lifespans.

the case of elderly patients with cognitive impairment among general 
practitioners (GPs) in The Netherlands: a qualitative study].

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with cognitive impairment have a limited life 
expectancy and are often acutely admitted to the hospital. Hospitalization can 
negatively affect their quality of life. More knowledge on considerations prior 
to these referrals is needed to improve care for these patients.
AIM: The aim of this research is to describe the aspects that can relate to the 
process of referring to the hospital in the acute situation by GPs in the case 
of elderly patients with cognitive impairment.
METHOD: Semi-structured interviews with 21 GPs from The Netherlands were 
conducted and afterwards transcribed verbatim. From these transcripts categories 
were extracted by using 131 focused codes according to the grounded theory.
RESULTS: Twelve categories were constructed. Six categories relate to whether it 
is desirable to treat or refer. These are the illness itself, the patient's 
wishes, the condition of the patient, the patient's burden, the possibilities in 
the hospital, and the vision of the GP. Six categories relate to the options 
available to the GP. These include medical options, care options, available time 
and information, the support available to the GP, and referrals without 
involvement of the GP.
CONCLUSION: The referral of elderly patients with cognitive impairment is 
a complex process that is influenced by different types of factors. With these 
findings, specialists in hospitals, GPs, and policy makers can improve the 
quality of care for this group.

Are mind wandering rates an artifact of the probe-caught method? Using 
self-caught mind wandering in the classroom to test, and reject, this 
possibility.

Mind wandering (MW) reports often rely on individuals responding to specific 
external thought probes. Researchers have used this probe-caught method almost 
exclusively, due to its reliability across a wide range of testing situations. 
However, it remains an open question whether the probe-caught MW rates in more 
complex settings converge with those for simpler tasks, because of the rather 
artificial and controlled nature of the probe-caught methodology itself, which 
is shared across the different settings. To address this issue, we measured MW 
in a real-world lecture, during which students indicated whether they were mind 
wandering by simply catching themselves (as one would normally do in real life) 
or by catching themselves and responding to thought probes. Across three 
separate lectures, self-caught MW reports were stable and unaffected by the 
inclusion of MW probes. That the probe rates were similar to those found in 
prior classroom research and did not affect the self-caught MW rates strongly 
suggests that the past consistency of probe-caught MW rates across a range of 
different settings is not an artifact of the thought-probe method. Our study 
also indicates that the self-caught MW methodology is a reliable way to acquire 
MW data. The extension of measurement techniques to include students' 
self-caught reports provides valuable information about how to successfully and 
naturalistically monitor MW in lecture settings, outside the laboratory.

AIMS: The association of vascular dysfunction and amyloid beta deposition 
attracted attentions for its relationship with cognitive decline. Previous 
studies show the correlation between the declined cardiac function and the 
cognitive impairment. In the present study, we analysed the association between 
cognitive functions and cardiac parameters in community-dwelling people with 
preserved ejection fraction without heart failure.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects were 108 Japanese community-dwelling middle-aged 
and older adults with preserved ejection fraction (25 men and 83 women; mean age 
74.7 years). Cardiac functional parameters at rest were assessed with B-type 
natriuretic peptide and echocardiography. The cardiopulmonary exercise test was 
used to test these parameters during exercise. Cognitive function was assessed 
with the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J). Other 
indices were assessed biochemically, physiologically, and physically. There were 
significant correlations between MoCA-J score and age (r = -0.388), peak oxygen 
uptake (VO2 , r = 0.201), peak VO2 /heart rate (HR, r = 0.243), peak VO2 /weight 
(r = 0.244), peak metabolic equivalents (r = 0.244), usual walking speed 
(r = -0.200), and the Timed Up and Go test (r = -0.230). Multiple linear 
regression analysis showed peak VO2 /HR was an independent determinant of MoCA-J 
score after adjusting for potential confounders (B = 0.424). After 6 months of 
exercise training with 64 subjects, we found that the per cent change of peak 
VO2 /HR was related to the per cent change of MoCA-J score (r = 0.296).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that peak VO2 /HR (an index of stroke 
volume at peak exercise) might be associated with cognitive impairment based on 
the vascular cascade hypothesis.

Changes in life expectancy due to avoidable and non-avoidable deaths in 
Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, 2000-2011.

The objective of this study was to analyze the level and trend of avoidable 
deaths and non-avoidable deaths and their contribution to the change in life 
expectancy in Latin America by studying the situations in Argentina, Chile, 
Colombia and Mexico between the years 2000 and 2011, stratified by sex and 
5-year age groups. The information source used in this study was the mortality 
vital statistics, and the population data were obtained from censuses or 
estimates. The proposal by Nolte & McKee (2012) was used to calculate the 
standardized mortality rates and the influence from avoidable and non-avoidable 
causes in the change in life expectancy between 0 and 74 years. In Argentina, 
Chile and Colombia, all the rates declined between the years 2000 and 2011, 
whereas in Mexico, the avoidable deaths and non-avoidable deaths rates increased 
slightly for men and decreased for women. In all the countries, the 
non-avoidable death rates were higher than the avoidable death rates, and the 
rates were higher for men. The largest contributions to changes in life 
expectancy were explained by the non-avoidable deaths for men in all countries 
and for women in Argentina; in contrast, in Chile, Colombia and Mexico, the 
gains in years of life expectancy for women were mainly a result of avoidable 
causes. The results suggest there have been reductions in mortality from these 
causes that have resulted in gains in years of life expectancy in the region. 
Despite these achievements, differences between countries, sex and age groups 
are still present, without any noticeable progress in the reduction of these 
inequalities until now.

OBJECTIVES: To compare unassisted and CAD-assisted detection and time efficiency 
of radiologists in reporting lung nodules on CT scans taken from patients with 
extra-thoracic malignancies using a Cloud-based system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three radiologists searched for pulmonary nodules in 
patients with extra-thoracic malignancy who underwent CT (slice 
thickness/spacing 2 mm/1.7 mm) between September 2015 and March 2016. All 
nodules detected by unassisted reading were measured and coordinates were 
uploaded on a cloud-based system. CAD marks were then reviewed by the same 
readers using the cloud-based interface. To establish the reference standard all 
nodules ≥ 3 mm detected by at least one radiologist were validated by two 
additional experienced radiologists in consensus. Reader detection rate and 
reporting time with and without CAD were compared. The study was approved by the 
local ethics committee. All patients signed written informed consent.
RESULTS: The series included 225 patients (age range 21-90 years, mean 62 
years), including 75 patients having at least one nodule, for a total of 215 
nodules. Stand-alone CAD sensitivity for lesions ≥ 3 mm was 85% (183/215, 95% 
CI: 82-91); mean false-positive rate per scan was 3.8. Sensitivity across 
readers in detecting lesions ≥ 3 mm was statistically higher using CAD: 65% (95% 
CI: 61-69) versus 88% (95% CI: 86-91, p<0.01). Reading time increased by 11% 
using CAD (296 s vs. 329 s; p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: In patients with extra-thoracic malignancies, CAD-assisted reading 
improves detection of ≥ 3-mm lung nodules on CT, slightly increasing reading 
time.
KEY POINTS: • CAD-assisted reading improves the detection of lung nodules 
compared with unassisted reading on CT scans of patients with primary 
extra-thoracic tumour, slightly increasing reading time. • Cloud-based CAD 
systems may represent a cost-effective solution since CAD results can be 
reviewed while a separated cloud back-end is taking care of computations. • 
Early identification of lung nodules by CAD-assisted interpretation of CT scans 
in patients with extra-thoracic primary tumours is of paramount importance as it 
could anticipate surgery and extend patient life expectancy.

Impact of mapped EQ-5D utilities on cost-effectiveness analysis: in the case of 
dialysis treatments.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of EQ-5D data mapped 
from SF-12 in terms of estimating cost effectiveness in cost-utility analysis 
(CUA). The comparability of SF-6D (derived from SF-12) was also assessed.
METHODS: Incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated based on two Markov models 
assessing the cost effectiveness of haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis 
(PD) using utility values based on EQ-5D-5L, EQ-5D using three direct-mapping 
algorithms and two response-mapping algorithms (mEQ-5D), and SF-6D. Bootstrap 
method was used to estimate the 95% confidence interval (percentile method) of 
incremental QALYs and ICERs with 1000 replications for the utilities.
RESULTS: In both models, compared to the observed EQ-5D values, mEQ-5D values 
expressed much lower incremental QALYs (range - 14.9 to - 33.2%) and much higher 
ICERs (range 17.5 to 49.7%). SF-6D also estimated lower incremental QALYs 
(- 29.0 and - 14.9%) and higher ICERs (40.9 and 17.5%) than did the observed 
EQ-5D. The 95% confidence interval of incremental QALYs and ICERs confirmed the 
lower incremental QALYs and higher ICERs estimated using mEQ-5D and SF-6D.
CONCLUSION: Compared to observed EQ-5D, EQ-5D mapped from SF-12 and SF-6D would 
under-estimate the QALYs gained in cost-utility analysis and thus lead to higher 
ICERs. It would be more sensible to conduct CUA studies using directly collected 
EQ-5D data and to designate one single preference-based measure as reference 
case in a jurisdiction to achieve consistency in healthcare decision-making.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at increased 
risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, and preventive care guidelines 
in IBD favor annual skin examinations. Here we estimate the cost-effectiveness 
of annual melanoma screening in IBD.
METHODS: Melanoma screening was defined as receiving annual total body skin 
examinations starting at age 40 from a dermatologist. Screening was compared to 
US background total body skin examination rates performed by primary care 
practitioners. A Markov model was used to estimate intervention costs and 
effectiveness. Future costs and effectiveness were discounted at 3% per year 
over a lifetime horizon. Strategies were compared using a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Annual melanoma screening cost an average of $1961 per patient, while 
no screening cost $81 per patient. Melanoma screening was more effective, 
gaining 9.2 QALYs per 1000 persons, at a cost of $203,400/QALY gained. Screening 
every other year was the preferred strategy, gaining 6.2 QALYs per 1000 persons 
and costing $143,959/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses suggested the relative 
risk of melanoma in IBD, melanoma progression, and screening costs were most 
influential with clinically plausible variation, leading to scenarios costing 
< $100,000/QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested screening 
every other year was cost-effective in 17.4% of iterations.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening for melanoma in IBD patients was effective but expensive. 
Screening every other year was the most cost-effective strategy. Studies to 
identify IBD patients at the highest risk of developing melanoma may assist in 
targeting a prevention program in the most cost-effective manner.

Spirotetramat is a pesticide with bidirectional systemicity in both xylem and 
phloem. Currently, researches show that spirotetramat has definite toxicity to 
aquatic organism. This paper aims to study the environmental behaviors of 
spirotetramat in water, in the hope of providing guidance for security 
evaluation of spirotetramat. The researches in this paper showed that under 
lighting condition, the half-life period of spirotetramat in water was 
13.59 days. In water, spirotetramat could be degraded into B-enol and B-keto. As 
seen from the residual concentrations of two products, B-enol was the dominant 
degradation product. Under different temperatures, the hydrolysis products of 
spirotetramat remain B-enol and B-keto. The temperature has little effect on the 
residual concentration of spirotetramat in water. The residual concentration of 
B-enol in water gradually increased with the extension of time but B-keto had no 
significant change. In the buffer solution of different pH values, the 
degradation rate of spirotetramat was significantly enhanced with the increase 
of solution pH value. The hydrolysis products of spirotetramat in buffer 
solution of different pH values were still B-enol and B-keto, and pH exerted 
certain influence on the residual concentration of B-enol in water. The 
hydrolysis conversion of spirotetramat has theoretical and practical 
significance for the safe and reasonable usage of it, as well as for the further 
evaluation of spirotetramat's ecological risk in water.

Aging is a complex multifactorial process, a prominent component being the 
senescence of the immune system. Consequently, immune-related diseases develop, 
including atherosclerosis, cancer, and life-threatening infections, which impact 
on health and longevity. Rejuvenating the aged immune system could mitigate 
these diseases, thereby contributing to longevity and health. Currently, an 
appealing option for rejuvenating the immune system is heterochronous autologous 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haHSCT), where healthy autologous bone 
marrow/peripheral blood stem cells are collected during the youth of an 
individual, cryopreserved, and re-infused when he or she has reached an older 
age. After infusion, young hematopoietic stem cells can reconstitute the 
compromised immune system and improve immune function. Several studies using 
animal models have achieved substantial extension of the life span of animals 
treated with haHSCT. Therefore, haHSCT could be regarded as a potential 
procedure for preventing age-related immune defects and extending healthy 
longevity. In this review, the pros, cons, and future feasibility of this 
approach are discussed.

microRNAs regulate diverse biological processes such as development and aging by 
promoting degradation or inhibiting translation of their target mRNAs. In this 
study, we have found that the miR-58 family microRNAs regulate lifespan in C. 
elegans. Intriguingly, members of the miR-58 family affect lifespan differently, 
sometimes in opposite directions, and have complex genetic interactions. The 
abundances of the miR-58 family miRNAs are up-regulated in the long-lived daf-2 
mutant in a daf-16-dependent manner, indicating that these miRNAs are effectors 
of insulin signaling in C. elegans. We also found that miR-58 is regulated by 
insulin signaling and partially required for the lifespan extension mediated by 
reduced insulin signaling, germline ablation, dietary restriction, and mild 
mitochondrial dysfunction. We further identified the daf-21, ins-1, and isw-1 
mRNAs as endogenous targets of miR-58. Our study shows that miRNAs function in 
multiple lifespan extension mechanisms, and that the seed sequence is not the 
dominant factor defining the role of a miRNA in lifespan regulation.

BACKGROUND: Therapies may be more efficacious when targeting a patient 
subpopulation with specific attributes, thereby enhancing the cost-effectiveness 
of treatment. In the CRYSTAL study, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC) were treated with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI or FOLFIRI alone until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxic effects or withdrawal of consent.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if stratified use of cetuximab based on genetic 
biomarker detection improves cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: We used individual patient data from CRYSTAL to compare the 
cost-effectiveness, cost per life-year (LY) and cost per quality-adjusted LY 
(QALY) gained of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone in three cohorts of 
patients with mCRC: all randomised patients (intent-to-treat; ITT), tumours with 
no detectable mutations in codons 12 and 13 of exon 2 of the KRAS protein ('KRAS 
wt') and no detectable mutations in exons 2, 3 and 4 of KRAS and exons 2, 3 and 
4 of NRAS ('RAS wt'). Survival analysis was conducted using RStudio, and a 
cost-utility model was modified to allow comparison of the three cohorts.
RESULTS: The deterministic base-case ICER (cost per QALY gained) was £130,929 in 
the ITT, £72,053 in the KRAS wt and £44,185 in the RAS wt cohorts for cetuximab 
plus FOLFIRI compared with FOLFIRI alone. At a £50,000 willingness-to-pay 
threshold, cetuximab plus FOLFIRI has a 2.8, 20 and 63% probability of being 
cost-effective for the ITT, KRAS wt and RAS wt cohorts, respectively, versus 
FOLFIRI alone.
CONCLUSION: Screening for mutations in both KRAS and NRAS may provide the most 
cost-effective approach to patient selection.

BACKGROUND: Treatments for metastatic pancreatic cancer include monotherapy with 
gemcitabine (GEM); combinations of GEM with oxaliplatin (OX + GEM), cisplatin 
(CIS + GEM), capecitabine (CAP + GEM), or nab-paclitaxel (NAB-P + GEM); and the 
non-GEM combination FOLFIRINOX. Combination therapies have yielded better 
survival outcomes than GEM alone. A sponsor-independent economic evaluation of 
these regimens has not been conducted for USA.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost utility and cost 
effectiveness of these regimens from the payer perspective for USA.
METHODS: A three-state Markov model (progression-free, progressed disease, 
death) simulating the total costs and health outcomes (quality-adjusted 
life-years; life-years) was developed to estimate the incremental cost-utility 
and cost-effectiveness ratios. FOLFIRINOX clinical data were obtained from trial 
and indirect estimates were obtained from network meta-analyses. Lifetime 
horizon and 3%/year discount rates were used.
RESULTS: FOLFIRINOX was the most expensive regimen and GEM the least costly 
regimen. Compared to GEM, all but one (CIS + GEM) regimen were found to be more 
effective in quality-adjusted life-years and life-years. Compared to GEM, the 
incremental cost-utility ratios for CAP + GEM, OX-GEM, NAB-P + GEM, and 
FOLFIRINOX, were US$180,503, US$197,993, US$204,833, and US$265,718 per 
additional quality-adjusted life-year, respectively; and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were US$88,181, US$87,620, US$135,683, and US$167,040 
per additional life-year, respectively. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
confirmed the base-case analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This sponsor-independent economic evaluation for USA found that 
OX + GEM, CAP + GEM, FOLFIRINOX, and NAB-P + GEM, but not CIS + GEM, were more 
expensive but also more effective than GEM alone in terms of quality-adjusted 
life-years and life-years gained. The NAB-P + GEM regimen appears to be the most 
cost effective in USA at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
US$200,000/quality-adjusted life-year.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a serious inherited disorder, which 
greatly increases individuals' risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adult 
life. However, medical treatment and lifestyle adjustments can fully restore 
life expectancy. Whilst European guidance advises that where there is a known 
family mutation genetic testing is undertaken in early childhood, the majority 
of the at-risk population remain untested and undiagnosed. To date, only a small 
number of studies have explored parents' and children's experiences of testing 
and treatment for FH, and little is known about interactions between health 
professionals, parents, and children in clinic settings. In this study, in-depth 
interviews were undertaken with parents who had attended a genetics and/or lipid 
clinic for FH with their children (n = 17). A thematic analysis revealed four 
main themes: undertaking early prevention, postponing treatment, parental 
concerns, and the importance of the wider family context. The majority of 
parents supported genetic testing for FH in childhood. However, although some 
were very supportive of following early treatment recommendations, others 
expressed reluctance. Importantly, some parents were concerned that 
inappropriate information had been shared with their children and wished that 
more time had been given to discuss how, when, and what to tell in advance. 
Future research is needed to explore the long-term outcomes for children who 
undertake genetic testing and early treatment for FH and to trial interventions 
to improve the engagement, follow-up, and support of children who are at risk, 
or diagnosed, with this disorder.

Agricultural production must increase to feed a growing and wealthier 
population, as well as to satisfy increasing demands for biomaterials and 
biomass-based energy. At the same time, deforestation and land-use change need 
to be minimized in order to preserve biodiversity and maintain carbon stores in 
vegetation and soils. Consequently, agricultural land use needs to be 
intensified in order to increase food production per unit area of land. Here we 
use simulations of AgMIP's Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI) 
phase 1 to assess implications of input-driven intensification (water, 
nutrients) on crop yield and yield stability, which is an important aspect in 
food security. We find region- and crop-specific responses for the simulated 
period 1980-2009 with broadly increasing yield variability under additional 
nitrogen inputs and stabilizing yields under additional water inputs 
(irrigation), reflecting current patterns of water and nutrient limitation. The 
different models of the GGCMI ensemble show similar response patterns, but model 
differences warrant further research on management assumptions, such as variety 
selection and soil management, and inputs as well as on model implementation of 
different soil and plant processes, such as on heat stress, and parameters. 
Higher variability in crop productivity under higher fertilizer input will 
require adequate buffer mechanisms in trade and distribution/storage networks to 
avoid food price volatility.

INTRODUCTION: Policy makers increasingly need to prioritise between competing 
health technologies or patient populations. When aiming to align allocation 
decisions with societal preferences, knowledge and operationalisation of such 
preferences is indispensable. This study examines the distribution of three 
views on healthcare priority setting in the Netherlands, labelled "Equal right 
to healthcare", "Limits to healthcare", and "Effective and efficient 
healthcare", and their relationship with preferences in willingness to trade-off 
(WTT) exercises.
METHODS: A survey including four reimbursement scenarios was conducted in a 
representative sample of the adult population in the Netherlands (n = 261). 
Respondents were matched to one of the three views based on their agreement with 
14 statements on principles for resource allocation. We tested for WTT 
differences between respondents with different views and applied logit 
regression models for examining the relationship between preferences and 
background characteristics, including views.
RESULTS: Nearly 65% of respondents held the view "Equal right to healthcare", 
followed by "Limits to healthcare" (22.5%), and "Effective and efficient 
healthcare" (7.1%). Most respondents (75.9%) expressed WTT in at least one 
scenario and preferred gains in quality of life over life expectancy, maximising 
gains over limiting inequality, treating children over elderly, and those with 
adversity over those with an unhealthy lifestyle. Various background 
characteristics, including the views, were associated with respondents' 
preferences.
CONCLUSIONS: Most respondents held an egalitarian view on priority setting, yet 
the majority was willing to prioritise regardless of their view. Societal views 
and preferences concerning healthcare priority setting are related. However, 
respondents' views influence preferences differently in different reimbursement 
scenarios. As societal views and preferences are heterogeneous and may conflict, 
aligning allocation decisions with societal preferences remains challenging and 
any decision may be expected to receive opposition from some group in society.

Prostate cancer: Basics on clinical appearance, diagnostics and treatment.

[Article in English, German]

Groeben C, Wirth MP.

With an incidence of approximately 60,000 per year prostate cancer is the most 
common malignant neoplasm in men with a relatively low mortality rate and a high 
mean age of primary diagnosis of about 70 years. The disease remains usually 
clinically occult over a long period of time and generally manifests primarily 
in a locally advanced or metastasized stage. Due to screening using the PSA 
level (prostate specific antigen) in blood serum, diagnosis and therapy nowadays 
are oftentimes possible at an early stage. The prostate carcinoma is classified 
using risk groups based on the level of PSA, the local tumor spread and the 
histological degree of differentiation (Gleason score). If no metastases are 
detected during staging a local curative therapy is indicated, provided that the 
patient is eligible for this due to age, comorbidity and life expectancy. 
Depending on the risk group of the patient, radical prostatectomy, percutaneous 
radiotherapy, brachytherapy or active surveillance are available as curative 
therapy concepts. Focal therapies such as HIFU, electrovaporization or 
cryotherapy are currently considered to be experimental. If metastases are 
already present at primary diagnosis, palliative, systemic therapy can be 
performed with an androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy. At an advanced
