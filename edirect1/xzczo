functioning organs. One goal is to achieve an immunosuppression-free state to 
improve quality of life, reduce complications and toxicities, and eliminate the 
cost of lifelong antirejection therapy. Innovative strategies include 
decellularization to fabricate acellular scaffolds that will be used as a 
template for organ manufacturing, three-dimensional printing and interspecies 
blastocyst complementation. Induced pluripotent stem cells are an innovation in 
stem cell technology which mitigate both the ethical concerns associated with 
embryonic stem cells and the limitation of other progenitor cells, which lack 
pluripotency. Regenerative medicine technologies hold promise in a wide array of 
fields and applications, such as promoting regeneration of native cell lines, 
growth of new tissue or organs, modelling of disease states, and augmenting the 
viability of existing ex vivo transplanted organs.
CONCLUSION: The future of organ bioengineering relies on furthering 
understanding of organogenesis, in vivo regeneration, regenerative immunology 
and long-term monitoring of implanted bioengineered organs.

BACKGROUND: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complication of cirrhosis of the 
liver causing neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Clinical manifestations of overt 
HE result in increased health care resource utilization and effects on patient 
quality of life. While lactulose has historically been the mainstay of treatment 
for acute HE and maintenance of remission, there is an unmet need for additional 
therapeutic options with a favorable adverse event profile. Compared with 
lactulose alone, rifaximin has demonstrated proven efficacy in complete reversal 
of HE and reduction in the incidence of HE recurrence, mortality, and 
hospitalizations. Evidence suggests the benefit of long-term prophylactic 
therapy with rifaximin; however, there is a need to assess the economic impact 
of rifaximin treatment in patients with HE.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of rifaximin ± lactulose 
versus lactulose monotherapy in patients with overt HE.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed in Excel with 4 health states (remission, 
overt HE, liver transplantation, and death) to predict costs and outcomes of 
patients with HE after initiation of maintenance therapy with rifaximin ± 
lactulose to avoid recurrent HE episodes. Cost-effectiveness of rifaximin was 
evaluated through estimation of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) or life-year (LY) gained. Analyses were conducted over a lifetime 
horizon. One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to assess uncertainty in results.
RESULTS: The rifaximin ± lactulose regimen provided added health benefits 
despite an additional cost versus lactulose monotherapy. Model results showed an 
incremental benefit of $29,161 per QALY gained and $27,762 per LY gained with 
rifaximin ± lactulose versus lactulose monotherapy. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses demonstrated that the rifaximin ± lactulose regimen was cost-effective 
~99% of the time at a threshold of $50,000 per QALY/LY gained, which falls 
within the commonly accepted threshold for incremental cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical benefit of rifaximin, combined with an acceptable 
economic profile, demonstrates the advantages of rifaximin maintenance therapy 
as an important option to consider for patients at risk of recurrent HE.

INTRODUCTION: As life expectancy increases, a growing percentage of older 
individuals with age-related diseases such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia are 
expected. Patients with both conditions, i.e. patient with osteosarcopenia, are 
suggested to have a higher risk of fall and fracture compared to individuals 
with either condition.
AIM: To investigate the potential relationship between low bone mineral density 
(BMD) and muscle dysfunction in a Danish cohort of older home-dwelling 
individuals. Furthermore, to examine the prevalence of osteosarcopenia and 
alterations in prevalence depending on cut-off values chosen.
METHOD: Measures of BMD, relative appendicular lean mass and hand grip strength 
were assessed in 529 individuals aged 65+ from the population-based 
cross-sectional Copenhagen Sarcopenia Study (CSS). Osteoporosis was diagnosed 
according to the World Health Organization guidelines. Sarcopenia was diagnosed 
in accordance with the guidelines from the European Working Group on Sarcopenia 
in Older People (EWGSOP2) with application of cut-off values from the EWGSOP2 
paper compared to cut-off values derived from a local cohort (CSS).
RESULTS: 19.2% had osteoporosis (66 women and 35 men), whereas 2.7% (6 women and 
8 men) and 4.2% (7 women and 15 men) had sarcopenia with application of EWGSOP2 
and CSS cut-off values, respectively. Using the EWGSOP2 cut-off values, 1.5% (4 
women and 4 men) were diagnosed with osteosarcopenia compared to 1.4% (4 women 
and 3 men) using CSS cut-off values. In the osteoporosis sub-population, 8% 
(EWGSOP2) and 7% (CSS) had sarcopenia and within the sarcopenia sub-population, 
61.5% (EWGSOP2) and 33.3% (CSS) had osteoporosis. At all sites, BMD was lower 
among individuals with sarcopenia and sarcopenia increased the risk of 
osteoporosis (odds ratios: EWGSOP2: 7.3 (p < 0.001) and CSS: 2.2 (ns)).
CONCLUSION: Osteosarcopenia was present in 1.5% of a group of healthy 
home-dwelling older individuals. Notably, individuals with sarcopenia had lower 
BMD and a higher risk of osteoporosis, whereas the opposite (prevalence of 
sarcopenia in individuals with osteoporosis) was not as frequent. Our data 
indicate that screening for sarcopenia and osteoporosis should be performed 
simultaneously in older individuals at high risk of falls and fractures. 
However, further studies with outcome-related results are needed to identify 
optimal measures of osteosarcopenia and cut-off values for sarcopenia.

The management of mitral valve dysfunction in the setting of substantial mitral 
annular calcification (MAC) remains controversial and is one of the most 
challenging problems in mitral valve surgery. The physiopathology of severe MAC 
is related to a combination of progressive, degenerative and active calcium 
deposition in the annulus that is often multifactorial, but largely attributable 
to aging and chronic disease conditions. Given the fact that overall life 
expectancy in the elderly population are increasing, it is imperative to 
understand contemporary and future therapeutic options since this MAC is likely 
going to be a frequent problem faced by the next generation of cardiac surgeons. 
This review provides a relevant synthesis of existing literature and aims to 
assess the efficacy of existing therapeutic choices for patients with mitral 
valve dysfunction and 'big' MAC with a goal of minimizing postoperative 
complications (e.g. left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, prosthetic 
paravalvular leak, valve embolization, and stroke) that can be achieved via a 
multidisciplinary heart team approach.

rheumatic heart disease.

Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) still affects more patients globally than 
degenerative valve disease. The vast majority of these patients live in low- to 
middle-income countries. Once symptomatic, they will need heart valve surgery. 
Unfortunately, prosthetic valves perform poorly in these patients given their 
young age, the high incidence of multi-valve disease, late diagnoses and often 
challenging socio-economic circumstances. Notwithstanding the fact that better 
valve designs would ideally be available, ill-informed decision making processes 
between bioprosthetic and mechanical valves are contributing to the poor 
results. In the absence of multicentred, randomised clinical trials, comparing 
the current generations of bioprostheses with mechanical valves across all age 
groups Western guidelines tend to be uncritically applied. As a consequence, 
mechanical valves are being implanted into patients who are often not able to 
deal with anticoagulation while bioprosthetic valves may be overly shunned for 
fear of reoperations. Almost sixty years after the advent of cardiac surgery 
heart valve prostheses have eventually undergone improvements and several 
potentially disruptive developments are on the horizon. Until they materialise, 
however, choices between contemporary valve prostheses need to be made on the 
basis of individual risk and life-expectancy rather than an uncritical 
implementation of guidelines that were derived for very different patients and 
under distinctly different conditions. Given the fast expansion of cardiac 
surgery in middle-income countries and a growing number of independently 
operating centres in low-income countries a critical appraisal of facts 
underlying the choice of heart valve prostheses for patients with RHD seems 
opportune.

The transport sector, including air transport, represents an important source of 
air pollution. The present article deals with the current situation regarding 
greenhouse gas emissions in the air in 27 European Union (EU-27) member states. 
Every member state is characterized by selected parameters that determine the 
unique nature of a particular country (e.g., population, area, life expectancy, 
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, etc.). In addition to these parameters, 
there were also other parameters which were monitored as they characterize the 
amount of greenhouse gas emissions and the impact of aviation on these 
emissions. The main purpose of the article is to compare the European Union 
member states on the basis of 15 examined parameters. The identification of 
similarities between the EU-27 member states with regard to the selected 
parameters was carried out by applying principal component analysis (PCA) and 
hierarchical cluster analysis. The average linkage method was applied to create 
a dendrogram representing the similarities between the examined member states. 
The value of the cophenetic correlation coefficient CC = 0.923 confirmed the 
correct application of the average linkage method. The cluster analysis outputs 
were five similarity-based homogeneous groups (clusters) into which the 27 
member states were divided on the basis of the examined variables.

AIMS: Life expectancy has increased in Israel during recent decades. However, 
compared to the majority, mostly Jewish population, life expectancy remains low 
among Israeli Arabs minority, and cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause 
of death. We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes between Israeli Arab 
and non-Arab patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A national survey accessed data of 7055 patients (1251, 18% 
Arabs) hospitalized with ACS. Compared to non-Arab, Arab patients were younger 
at ACS presentation (59 ± 11 vs. 65 ± 12 years, p < 0.01), more likely male (81% 
vs. 77%, p = 0.01), and with higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (47% vs. 
34%, p < 0.01) and smoking history (57% vs. 34%, p < 0.001). Among patients with 
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) ACS, the mean time from first medical 
contact to the hospital was similar for Arab and non-Arab patients (133 and 
137 min, respectively). After adjustment for age, gender, time from first 
medical contact to hospital arrival, diabetes, hypertension and renal failure, 
1-year survival was lower among Arab patients (93.4% vs. 95.1%, p = 0.027), and 
5-year survival was not statistically different (84.0% vs. 86.8%, p = 0.059). 
The survival differences were mostly derived from reduced survival at 1 and 
5 years of STEMI Arab patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Israeli Arabs present with ACS at a younger age than non-Arabs and 
have higher prevalence of smoking and diabetes at presentation. Adjusted 1-year 
survival was lower among Arab patients. Access to medical care and in-hospital 
practices during ACS were similar for Arabs and non-Arabs. The findings 
highlight the impact of risk factors on the early presentation of ACS and the 
need for a robust risk reduction program for Israeli Arabs.

INTRODUCTION: Increased life expectancy in patients with end-stage renal failure 
undergoing dialysis and the high prevalence of the chronic renal disease 
highlight the need to investigate the patients' quality of life.
AIM: To investigate sleep disorders and the level of health-related quality of 
life in hemodialysis patients with chronic renal failure.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: The sample of the study consisted of 420 hemodialysis 
patients. The Kidney Disease and Quality of Life™ Short Form questionnaire was 
used to assess the quality of life of patients, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index was used to investigate sleep disorders.
RESULTS: The physical and mental health of the responders were found to be 36.9 
and 39.6, respectively, while the burden and effects of chronic renal disease 
were found to be 40 and 44.9, respectively. There were strong positive 
correlations between the overall health assessment and the emotional well-being 
(r = 0.743), the physical function (r = 0.730), the burden of renal disease 
(0.626), the energy/fatigue (0.643), the social function (0.639), and the pain 
(0.595). The patients' quality of sleep was found poor (7.62). The major 
correlation was observed between the total score and the dimension of the sleep 
latency (0.681), followed by the sleep disturbances (0.624).
CONCLUSIONS: The HRQOL of hemodialysis patients with CKD-FS remains poor, 
interacting with important functions such as sleep, vitality, cognition, and 
sexual function.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO 2002), people's life expectancy 
worldwide is continuously growing, and on the one hand, that is one of the 
greatest triumphs of humanity to date. But at the same time, it is also one of 
the most important challenges as the aging of the population raises economic and 
social requirements in all countries.

PURPOSE: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of three strategies for the 
adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer in women age 70 years or older: an 
aromatase inhibitor (AI-alone) for 5 years, a 5-fraction course of accelerated 
partial-breast irradiation using intensity-modulated radiation therapy 
(APBI-alone), or their combination.
METHODS: We constructed a patient-level Markov microsimulation from the societal 
perspective. Effectiveness data (local recurrence, distant metastases, 
survival), and toxicity data were obtained from randomized trials when possible. 
Costs of side effects were included. Costs were adjusted to 2019 US dollars and 
extracted from Medicare reimbursement data. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) 
were calculated using utilities extracted from the literature.
RESULTS: The strategy of AI-alone ($12,637) was cheaper than both APBI-alone 
($13,799) and combination therapy ($18,012) in the base case. All approaches 
resulted in similar QALY outcomes (AI-alone 7.775; APBI-alone 7.768; combination 
7.807). In the base case, AI-alone was the cost-effective strategy and dominated 
APBI-alone, while combined therapy was not cost-effective when compared to 
AI-alone ($171,451/QALY) or APBI-alone ($107,932/QALY). In probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses, AI-alone was cost-effective at $100,000/QALY in 50% of 
trials, APBI-alone in 28% and the combination in 22%. Scenario analysis 
demonstrated that APBI-alone was more effective than AI-alone when AI compliance 
was lower than 26% at 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on a Markov microsimulation analysis, both AI-alone and 
APBI-alone are appropriate options for patients 70 years or older with early 
breast cancer with small cost differences noted. A prospective trial comparing 
the approaches is warranted.

Neurodegenerative diseases lead to the death of nerve cells in the brain or the 
spinal cord. A wide range of diseases are included within the group of 
neurodegenerative disorders, with the most common ones being dementia, 
Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. Millions of older people are suffering 
from such pathologies. The global increase of life expectancy unavoidably leads 
to a consequent increase in the number of people who will be at some degree 
affected by neurodegenerative-related diseases. At this moment, there is no 
effective therapy or treatment that can reverse the loss of neurons. A growing 
number of studies highlight the value of the consumption of medical foods, and 
in particular olive oil, as one of the most important components of the 
Mediterranean diet. A diet based on extra virgin olive oil seems to contribute 
toward the lowering of risk of age-related pathologies due to high phenol 
concentration. The link of a polyphenol found in extra virgin olive oil, namely, 
tyrosol, with the protein tyrosinase, associated to Parkinson's disease is 
underlined as a paradigm of affiliation between polyphenols and 
neurodegenerative disorders.

In recent years, popular culture has been graced with countless news announcing 
novel developments in genome editing. While many experiments are still in their 
early stages, genome editing seems very promising. Often betraying a 
sensationalist and triumphant tone, news coverage focuses on the potentials that 
these developments will have for the advancement of the human species, i.e., the 
eradication of disease, the extension of life, the improvement of the body and 
its appearance, etc. The future looks hopeful and unproblematic according to 
these accounts. On the opposite end of the spectrum, some may wonder whether 
these developments pose a potential worsening of the human condition: Are these 
developments safe? What are the ethical implications? Who will benefit from 
these developments? Given today's social divisions and cultural conflicts, these 
voices predict a rather unpromising future and warn against the pursue of 
innovation at any cost.

Background: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a debilitating and highly 
prevalent condition in the UK. The condition is associated with a significant 
economic burden for affected patients and society. Current treatment options for 
SUI include minimally invasive therapies, medication and surgical intervention 
for the most serious cases. Electrical Muscle Stimulator with Multipath 
technology is a recently developed device for the treatment of SUI that relies 
on neuromuscular external electrical stimulation (NEES) technology. The clinical 
efficacy of the device has been proven in previous studies, but existing 
evidence surrounding its economic viability is limited.Objectives: To assess the 
cost-utility of the Electrical Muscle Stimulator with Multipath technology 
Therapy device for the treatment of SUI amongst women in a UK setting.Methods: 
An economic model was developed to consider the cost-utility (cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) of Electrical Muscle Stimulator with 
Multipath technology compared with current practice. A Markov model was 
developed, with costs and health effects estimated over the lifetime of the 
patient in the base-case analysis. The model was developed to reflect the 
treatment pathways typically followed by patients with SUI in the UK. Parameter 
uncertainty was explored in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.Results: Base-case results indicate that Electrical Muscle Stimulator 
with Multipath technology results in cost savings and QALY gains over the 
patient's lifetime. In the "cure" analysis, the intervention is £250 less costly 
and leads to a 0.03 QALY gain per patient, while in the "improvement analysis", 
the intervention is £327 less costly and leads to a 0.13 QALY gain per patient. 
Results from the probabilistic sensitivity analyses show that the likelihood of 
Electrical Muscle Stimulator with Multipath technology being cost-effective is 
greater than 74% across all willingness-to-pay thresholds in the two analyses 
presented.Conclusions: Electrical Muscle Stimulator with Multipath technology is 
a potentially cost-effective treatment option for patients with SUI who have 
failed first-line treatment. It could reduce costs to the health care service 
and improve quality-of-life for selected patients over their lifetime.

BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence about the effectiveness of rehabilitation 
in meeting the longer-term needs of stroke patients and their carers.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an 
extended stroke rehabilitation service (EXTRAS).
DESIGN: A pragmatic, observer-blind, parallel-group, multicentre randomised 
controlled trial with embedded health economic and process evaluations. 
Participants were randomised (1 : 1) to receive EXTRAS or usual care.
SETTING: Nineteen NHS study centres.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a new stroke who received early supported discharge 
and their informal carers.
INTERVENTIONS: Five EXTRAS reviews provided by an early supported discharge team 
member between 1 and 18 months post early supported discharge, usually over the 
telephone. Reviewers assessed rehabilitation needs, with goal-setting and 
action-planning. Control treatment was usual care post early supported 
discharge.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was performance in extended 
activities of daily living (Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living 
Scale) at 24 months post randomisation. Secondary outcomes at 12 and 24 months 
included patient mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), health status 
(Oxford Handicap Scale), experience of services and adverse events. For carers, 
secondary outcomes included carers' strain (Caregiver Strain Index) and 
experience of services. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using resource 
utilisation costs (adaptation of the Client Service Receipt Inventory) and 
quality-adjusted life-years.
RESULTS: A total of 573 patients (EXTRAS, n = 285; usual care, n = 288) with 194 
carers (EXTRAS, n = 103; usual care, n = 91) were randomised. Mean 24-month 
Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale scores were 40.0 (standard 
deviation 18.1) for EXTRAS (n = 219) and 37.2 (standard deviation 18.5) for 
usual care (n = 231), giving an adjusted mean difference of 1.8 (95% confidence 
interval -0.7 to 4.2). The mean intervention group Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale scores were not significantly different at 12 and 24 months. 
The intervention did not improve patient health status or carer strain. EXTRAS 
patients and carers reported greater satisfaction with some aspects of care. The 
mean cost of resource utilisation was lower in the intervention group: -£311 
(95% confidence interval -£3292 to £2787), with a 68% chance of EXTRAS being 
cost-saving. EXTRAS was associated with 0.07 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 
0.12) additional quality-adjusted life-years. At current conventional thresholds 
of willingness to pay for a quality-adjusted life-year, there is a 90% chance 
that EXTRAS is cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: EXTRAS did not improve stroke survivors' performance in extended 
activities of daily living but did improve their overall satisfaction with 
services. Given the impact on costs and quality-adjusted life-years, there is a 
high chance that EXTRAS could be considered cost-effective.
FUTURE WORK: Further research is required to identify whether or not 
community-based interventions can improve performance of extended activities of 
daily living, and to understand the improvements in health-related quality of 
life and costs seen by provision of intermittent longer-term specialist review.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN45203373.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research 
(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in 
Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 24, No. 24. See the NIHR Journals Library 
website for further project information.

Plain Language Summary: Early supported discharge enables stroke patients with 
mild or moderate disability to be discharged earlier than usual from hospital to 
continue rehabilitation at home. Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated 
that early supported discharge leads to increased independence for stroke 
survivors, and that early supported discharge is cost-effective. Early supported 
discharge is usually provided for up to 6 weeks and patients with ongoing 
physical, psychological or social needs are then referred to other services. In 
the UK, provision of longer-term rehabilitation is often limited. Lack of 
research evidence has meant that service development in this aspect of stroke 
care has lagged behind service development for acute care. This clinical trial 
evaluated an extended stroke rehabilitation service (EXTRAS) that started when 
early supported discharge ended. Stroke survivors and their carers were randomly 
assigned to receive EXTRAS or usual NHS care. EXTRAS involved five 
rehabilitation reviews conducted over 18 months by an early supported discharge 
team member, usually over the telephone. Each review consisted of an assessment 
of current needs, goal-setting and action-planning, and sought to improve 
patients’ abilities and confidence to undertake extended activities of daily 
living (mobility, kitchen and domestic tasks, and leisure activities). There 
were no specific assessments or actions for carers but it was important to 
evaluate the impact that the new service had on carers. Patients and carers were 
followed up for 2 years and information was collected about their activities, 
mood, quality of life and services received. EXTRAS did not improve stroke 
survivors’ performance in extended activities of daily living. However, patients 
who received EXTRAS reported less anxiety and less depression than those who 
received usual care, and patients and carers were more satisfied with some 
aspects of their care. EXTRAS did not improve carers’ quality of life or stress. 
Health economic analyses suggest that EXTRAS improved patients’ quality of life 
and may be good value for money. Further research is needed to identify other 
treatments to address the longer-term consequences of stroke.

Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with reduced risk 
of age-related functional declines and chronic diseases, primarily attributed to 
their bioactive phytochemicals. Apples and blueberries are rich in 
phytochemicals with a wide range of biological activities and health benefits. 
Our previous research has shown the combination of apple peel extracts (APE) and 
blueberry extracts (BE) can synergistically promote the lifespan of 
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The objectives of this study were to 
determine whether the extension of lifespan was involved in regulation of 
oxidative stress, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of action. The 
results showed that the combination of APE and BE could synergistically 
ameliorate oxidative stress by improving antioxidant enzyme activities and 
enhancing resistance to paraquat. Meanwhile, treatment with APE plus BE could 
down-regulate the overexpression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and affect the 
expression of antioxidant related genes, including sod-3, cat-1, ctl-1, skn-1, 
mev-1 and isp-1. However, administration with APE plus BE abolished the 
extension of the lifespan of skn-1(zu135) mutants, and inhibited the expression 
of skn-1 downstream genes, including gcs-1, gst-4 and gst-7. In addition, 
supplementation with APE plus BE could promote the migration of SKN-1 into the 
nucleus, which eliminated improvement to ROS and paraquat. In conclusion, the 
combination of APE and BE could synergistically protect against oxidative stress 
in C. elegans via the SKN-1/Nrf2 pathway. This study provided the theoretical 
basis to explore the combination of phytochemicals in the prevention of aging 
regulated by oxidative stress.

INTRODUCTION: Bangladesh has a history of endemic malaria transmission, with 
17.5 million people at risk. The objective of this study was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of universal childhood malaria vaccination in Chittagong Hill 
Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh with newly developed RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccines.
METHODS: A decision model was been developed using Microsoft® Excel to examine 
the potential impact of future vaccination in Bangladesh. We estimated the 
economic and health burden due to malaria and the cost-effectiveness of malaria 
vaccination from the health system and societal perspective. The primary 
outcomes include the incremental cost per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) 
averted, incremental cost per case averted, and the incremental cost per death 
averted.
RESULTS: Introducing childhood malaria vaccination in CHT in Bangladesh for a 
single birth cohort could prevent approximately 500 malaria cases and at least 
30 deaths from malaria during the first year of vaccination. The cost per DALY 
averted of introducing the malaria vaccine compared to status quo is US$ 2,629 
and US$ 2,583 from the health system and societal perspective, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of malaria vaccination in CHT region is estimated to 
be a cost-effective preventive intervention and would offer substantial future 
benefits particularly for young children vaccinated today. Policies should, 
thus, consider the operational advantages of targeting these populations, 
particularly in the CHT area, with the vaccine along with other malaria control 
initiatives.

The increase in life expectancy with the advent of highly effective 
antiretroviral therapy poses challenges in terms of toxicity and drug 
interactions. Exogenous Cushing syndrome by interaction between ritonavir and 
inhaled fluticasone in children diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus 
infection and chronic pulmonary pathology is rare. So far, there are 20 cases 
reported. Three pediatric cases are reported, with a diagnosis of human 
immunodeficiency virus infection and chronic pulmonary pathology who presented 
exogenous Cushing syndrome with inhaled fluticasone at usual doses due to drug 
interaction between it and ritonavir. The patients resolved the clinical picture 
after 2-4 months of fluticasone suspension and remain asymptomatic in the 
follow-up.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening children born at 
extremely low birth weight (ELBW) for hepatoblastoma using serial serum 
alpha-fetoprotein measurements.
STUDY DESIGN: We created a decision tree to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
screening children born at ELBW between 3 and 48 months of age compared with 
current standard of care (no screening). Our model used discounted lifetime 
costs and monetary benefits in 2018 US dollars, based on estimates in the 
published literature. The effects of uncertainty in model parameters were also 
assessed using univariate sensitivity analyses, in which we changed the values 
for one parameter at a time to assess the effect on the estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: For the estimated 55 699 children born at ELBW in the US each year, 
this screening is associated with 77.7 additional quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) at a cost of $8.7 million. This results in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of about $112 000/QALY, which is considered cost 
effective from a US societal perspective. For children diagnosed with 
hepatoblastoma, our model finds that the screening regimen is associated with a 
10.1% increase in survival, a 4.18% increase in expected QALYs, and a $245 184 
decrease in expected cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening ELBW children for hepatoblastoma between 3 and 48 months 
of age dominates the alternative and is cost effective from a societal 
perspective.
