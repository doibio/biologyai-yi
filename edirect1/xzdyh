BACKGROUND: With the prolonging of human life expectancy and subsequent 
population aging, osteoporosis (OP) has become an important public health issue.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand the global public search interests and 
dynamic trends in "osteoporosis" using the data derived from Google Trends.
METHODS: An online search was performed using the term "osteoporosis" in Google 
Trends from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2019, under the category "Health." 
Cosinor analysis was used to test the seasonality of relative search volume 
(RSV) for "osteoporosis." An analysis was conducted to investigate the public 
search topic rising in RSV for "osteoporosis."
RESULTS: There was a descending trend of global RSV for "osteoporosis" from 
January 2004 to December 2014, and a slowly increasing trend from January 2015 
to December 2019. Cosinor analysis showed significant seasonal variations in 
global RSV for "osteoporosis" (P=.01), with a peak in March and a trough in 
September. In addition, similar decreasing trends of RSV for "osteoporosis" were 
found in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and Canada from January 2004 to 
December 2019. Cosinor test revealed significant seasonal variations in RSV for 
"osteoporosis" in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, UK, and USA (all 
P<.001). Furthermore, public search rising topics related to "osteoporosis" 
included denosumab, fracture risk assessment tool, bone density, osteopenia, 
osteoarthritis, and risk factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided evidence about the public search interest and 
dynamic trends in OP using web-based data, which would be helpful for public 
health and policy making.

Inverse Lansing Effect: Maternal Age and Provisioning Affecting Daughters' 
Longevity and Male Offspring Production.

Anderson CE, Malek MC, Jonas-Closs RA, Cho Y, Peshkin L, Kirschner MW, Yampolsky 
LY.

AbstractMaternal age effects on offspring life history are known in a variety of 
organisms, with offspring of older mothers typically having lower life 
expectancy (the Lansing effect). However, there is no consensus on the 
generality and mechanisms of this pattern. We tested predictions of the Lansing 
effect in several Daphnia magna clones and observed clone-specific magnitude and 
direction of the maternal age effect on offspring longevity. We also report 
ambidirectional, genotype-specific effects of maternal age on the propensity of 
daughters to produce male offspring. Focusing on two clones with contrasting 
life histories, we demonstrate that maternal age effects can be explained by 
lipid provisioning of embryos by mothers of different ages. Individuals from a 
single-generation maternal age reversal treatment showed intermediate life span 
and intermediate lipid content at birth. In the clone characterized by the 
"inverse Lansing effect," neonates produced by older mothers showed higher 
mitochondrial membrane potential in neural tissues than their counterparts born 
to younger mothers. We conclude that an inverse Lansing effect is possible and 
hypothesize that it may be caused by age-specific maternal lipid provisioning 
creating a calorically restricted environment during embryonic development, 
which in turn reduces fecundity and increases life span in offspring.

Ambrosia artemisiifolia and Ambrosia trifida are annual invasive plants that 
cause serious harm to agriculture, animal husbandry, and human health. Based on 
the important characteristic of high-density, cluster distribution of their 
populations, it is speculated that its autotoxins have an effect on density 
regulation. This study explored the regulation of autotoxicity on intraspecific 
density. We used water extracts from two plants to compare and verify the 
autotoxicity of seed germination, analysed the components of autotoxins. The 
results showed that A. artemisiifolia and A. trifida had significant 
autotoxicity, and the highest inhibition rates on seed germination were 27.21% 
and 77.94%, respectively; ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry analysis revealed that chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric 
acid, and vanillin were the main autotoxins of the two plants. After the seeds 
were washed with water, the germination recovery rate of seeds increased with 
the increased of inhibition degree of autotoxins treatment. Therefore, this 
study verified the autotoxicity of A. artemisiifolia and A. trifida, which can 
promote and inhibit the seed germination of A. artemisiifolia and A. trifida to 
regulate intraspecific competition.

PURPOSE: Investigate the survival and risk factors that affect the survival of 
aged patients in a palliative care center (PCC).
METHODS: A total of 180 inpatients (aged ≥ 65 years) who were admitted to a PCC 
from January 2018 to March 2020 were included. Information regarding patients' 
demographic characteristics, chronic diseases, length of hospital stay, 
nutrition provided at the first hospital stay, pressure wound, pain, and 
laboratory results were evaluated.
RESULTS: The patients 50% were women (n = 90). The mean age, mean comorbidity, 
and mean follow-up duration was 77.6 years, 3.4, and 115 days (median: 29 days), 
respectively. The mean NRS2002 score of patients was 4.0 ± 1.0 and the risk of 
malnutrition was 93%. The mortality rate of the patients was 91.7%. The life 
expectancy of patients without malignancy was higher than those with malignancy 
(p < 0.001). Enteral nutrition (EN) via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy 
(PEG) was associated with up to two-fold increase in the survival rates of 
patients with PCC (p = 0.049, HR: 2.029). High neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio 
(p = 0.002, HR: 1.017) and high ferritin (p = 0.001, HR: 1.000) and C-reactive 
protein (CRP) levels (p < 0.001, HR: 1.006) were adverse risk factors affecting 
life expectancy. Malignity reduced the survival rate of aged patients with PCC 
by 40% (p = 0.008).
CONCLUSION: EN via PEG was found to be a positive factor affecting survival 
rates of older adult patients in palliative care, whereas malignity, high 
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, high CRP and ferritin levels, and prolonged 
hospital stays were negative risk factors.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Pituitary apoplexy is a very rare cause of sudden 
and severe headache with a neuro-ophthalmic deficit during pregnancy due to 
hemorrhage or infarction in the pituitary gland. Delayed identification can be 
life-threatening to both mother and baby.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old nulliparous female without any prior 
comorbidities in her 21 weeks of gestation presented with complaints of severe 
headache, vomiting, decreased vision, and altered sensorium for five days. On a 
low index of suspicion of pituitary apoplexy, she was managed in the line of 
impending eclampsia at a local center. On presentation to our center; the 
neurological deficit had progressed. CT head showed massive pituitary apoplexy 
with sellar and suprasellar extension. She underwent emergency right pterional 
craniotomy and resection of the tumor with hematoma evacuation but lost her life 
on her 2nd postoperative day.
DISCUSSION: In the context of pregnancy, the diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy can 
get tricky and overlap with other common conditions such as preeclampsia or 
eclampsia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive investigation 
to confirm the diagnosis. Corticotropic deficiency with adrenal insufficiency is 
a potentially life-threatening disorder for both mother and the fetus if left 
untreated. The choice between conservative management and surgical approach 
depends on the neuro-ophthalmic signs, MRI findings, and gestational week.
CONCLUSION: Pituitary apoplexy should be a differential diagnosis of acute 
severe headache in pregnancy which when suspected should be investigated 
promptly. Early identification and multi-disciplinary team management are 
imperative for better outcomes.

Although floating farming, a climate-smart practice, is a response to climate 
change challenges facing agriculture in wetland areas, the adoption of floating 
agriculture in Bangladesh wetland areas (also known as Haor) is slow. The 
purpose of our study was to identify the factors that motivate and barriers that 
inhibit the adoption of floating agriculture in the Haor region in Bangladesh's 
Kishoreganj district. To achieve our purpose, we used Roger's five-stage 
innovation-decision theory. We collected data from a sample of 120 Haor rural 
farmers using a quantitative questionnaire answered via a personal interview. We 
used a binary logistic regression to identify the factors that predict farmers' 
motivational actions in adopting floating agriculture. In addition, we rank 
ordered the data to identify the obstacles that prohibit farmers from 
implementing floating agriculture. The results demonstrate that education, 
training related to floating agriculture, credit received, communication 
behavior, trialability and observability, and complexity in practicing floating 
agriculture motivate farmers to adopt floating agriculture. The results also 
show that climatic factors (e.g., high waves and excessive rainfall, aquatic 
plant scarcity) and non-climatic factors (e.g., inadequate demonstration plots, 
conflict, and political power abuse) inhibit adoption of floating agriculture. 
Our study provides suggestions for increasing farmers' adoption of floating 
agriculture in wetland areas.

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate whether applying an adapted 
person-centered prescription (PCP) model reduces the total regular medications 
in older people admitted in a subacute hospital at the end of life (EOL), 
improving pharmacotherapeutic indicators and reducing the expense associated 
with pharmacological treatment.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. The trial was registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05454644).
SETTING: A subacute hospital in Basque Country, Spain.
SUBJECTS: Adults ≥65 years (n = 114) who were admitted to a geriatric 
convalescence unit and required palliative care.
INTERVENTION: The adapted PCP model consisted of a systematic four-step process 
conducted by geriatricians and clinical pharmacists. Relative to the original 
model, this adapted model entails a protocol for the tools and assessments to be 
conducted on people identified as being at the EOL.
MEASUREMENTS: After applying the adapted PCP model, the mean change in the 
number of regular drugs, STOPPFrail (Screening Tool of Older Persons' 
Prescriptions in Frail adults with limited life expectancy) criteria, drug 
burden index (DBI), drug-drug interactions, medication regimen complexity index 
(MRCI) and 28-days medication cost of chronic prescriptions between admission 
and discharge was analyzed. All patients were followed for 3 months after 
hospital discharge to measure the intervention's effectiveness over time on 
pharmacotherapeutic variables and the cost of chronic medical prescriptions.
RESULTS: The number of regular prescribed medications at baseline was 9.0 ± 3.2 
in the intervention group and 8.2 ± 3.5 in the control group. The mean change in 
the number of regular prescriptions at discharge was -1.74 in the intervention 
group and -0.07 in the control group (mean difference = 1.67 ± 0.57; p = 0.007). 
Applying a PCP model reduced all measured criteria compared with pre-admission 
(p < 0.05). At discharge, the mean change in 28-days medication cost was 
significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control group 
(-34.91€ vs. -0.36€; p < 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Applying a PCP model improves pharmacotherapeutic indicators and 
reduces the costs associated with pharmacological treatment in hospitalized 
geriatric patients at the EOL, continuing for 3 months after hospital discharge. 
Future studies must investigate continuity in the transition between hospital 
care and primary care so that these new care models are offered transversally 
and not in isolation.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer, especially in underdeveloped areas, poses a great 
threat to human health. In view of this, we stratified the age and social 
demographic index (SDI) based on the epidemiological development trend and 
attributable risk of cervical cancer in countries and regions around the world.
METHODS: According to the data statistics of the global burden of disease 
database (GBD) in the past 30 years, we adopted the annual percentage change 
(EAPCs) to evaluate the incidence trend of cervical cancer, that is, incidence 
rate, mortality, and disability adjusted life expectancy (DALY). Meanwhile, we 
investigated the potential influence of SDI on cervical cancer's epidemiological 
trends and relevant risk factors for cervical cancer-related mortality.
RESULTS: In terms of incidence rate and mortality, the high SDI areas were 
significantly lower than those of low SDI areas. The incidence and mortality in 
women aged 20 to 39 were relatively stable, whereas an upward trend existed in 
patients aged 40 to 59. The global cervical cancer incidence rate increased from 
335642 in 1990 to 565541 in 2019 (an increase of 68.50%, with an average annual 
growth rate of 2.28%), while the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) showed a 
slight downward trend of 14.91/100000 people (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 
13.37-17.55) in 1990 to 13.35/100,000 persons (95% UI, 11.37-15.03) in 2019. The 
number of annual deaths at a global level increased constantly and there were 
184,527 (95% UI, 164,836-218,942) deaths in 1990 and 280,479 (95% UI, 
238,864-313,930) deaths in 2019, with an increase of 52.00%(average annual 
growth rate: 1.73%). The annual age-standardized disability adjusted annual life 
rate showed a downward trend (decline range: 0.95%, 95% confidence interval 
[CI], from -1.00% to - 0.89%). In addition, smoking and unsafe sex were the main 
attributable hazard factors in most GBD regions.
CONCLUSIONS: In the past three decades, the increase in the global burden of 
cervical cancer is mainly concentrated in underdeveloped regions (concentrated 
in low SDI). On the contrary, in countries with high sustainable development 
index, the burden of cervical cancer tends to be reduced. Alarmingly, ASIR in 
areas with low SDI is on the rise, which suggests that policy makers should pay 
attention to the allocation of public health resources and focus on the 
prevention and treatment of cervical cancer in underdeveloped areas, so as to 
reduce its incidence rate, mortality, and prognosis.

Lung cancer represents one of the most common neoplasms and the main cause of 
cancer‑associated death worldwide. Its relationship with different risk factors 
such as tobacco, which is its main etiological factor, has been clearly 
established and despite the numerous advances achieved in the diagnosis, 
treatment and follow‑up of these patients, the life expectancy of these patients 
is notably limited. Furthermore, its treatment is not exempt from comorbidities 
and frequently it neither provides optimal control of the disease nor improve 
the quality of life of these patients. Despite the possibility of performing 
screening tests in patients at risk, their implementation in daily clinical 
practice is complex and most of them are diagnosed at an advanced stage of their 
disease where systemic radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatments slightly improve 
their prognosis. Lung adenocarcinoma is the most representative type of lung 
cancer, with specific epidemiological, molecular and clinical features. Thus, a 
growing number of studies are being conducted to find potential therapeutic 
targets based on the study of different molecular pathways, improving the 
outcome for these patients. In addition, a broad spectrum of serological, 
immunohistochemical and genetic markers are being evaluated for use in the 
screening and follow‑up of these patients in daily clinical practice, but unlike 
for other tumors, they are currently not implemented in the early diagnosis of 
the disease. Therefore, the aim of the present review was to summarize the main 
advances that have occurred in the development of serological and histological 
markers and their therapeutic implications in patients diagnosed with lung 
adenocarcinoma, explaining the limitations that have been observed and analyzing 
the future perspectives in the clinical management of this disease.

The long-term effects of school education on further education: a longitudinal 
view on motivation and behaviour in youth and adulthood.

Sandau M(1).

(1)University of Potsdam, Germany.

As school learning should enable people to self-determine their own lives, its 
long-lasting relevance for participation in further education is an essential 
outcome. Contemporary adult education research shows that beliefs and memories 
from one's school years have an impact on the motivation to pursue further 
education in working life. However, almost no longitudinal research exists that 
investigates the long-term forces behind adults' motivation to educate 
themselves. Hence, the present study examined whether students' learning-related 
behaviour, cognitions and emotions that developed in their school years are 
related to the subjective value they place on further education, their 
expectations of success in solving further learning tasks, and thus the 
likelihood of participating in further education. Corresponding structural 
equation analyses on data from the German panel study LifE (n = 1,110) revealed 
that the learning behaviour, ability self-concept and test anxiety at the age of 
12, along with their individual change between the ages of 12 and 16, are 
associated in different ways with the attainment value and subjective costs 
placed on further education and expectations of success at the age of 35. In 
contrast, no influence of youth characteristics on the likelihood of 
participating in further education could be found. The findings indicate that 
especially the development of learning-related cognitions and emotions in 
secondary school is sustainably related to the individual's success expectancy 
and achievement value of further education. Long-term dependencies should be 
further investigated with regard to academic domains and socio-economic 
pathways.

INTRODUCTION: Improvements in treatment strategies have led to increased life 
expectancy of persons with haemophilia (PWH). Consequently, age-related 
comorbidities become increasingly relevant.
AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of age-related comorbidities, mortality, health 
service utilisation and predictors of hospitalisation in PWH compared to the 
general population.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using linked 
administrative data. Men with haemophilia were identified in Alberta, Canada 
(2012-2019) with a validated case definition and were age-matched with male 
population controls. We calculated the prevalence of major comorbidities, 
all-cause mortality, and examined health service utilisation including Emergency 
Department visits and hospitalisations. Logistic regression was applied to 
identify predictors of hospitalisation.
RESULTS: We identified 198 and 329 persons with moderately severe haemophilia 
and mild/moderate, respectively. Moderately severe haemophilia had a higher risk 
of death (standardised mortality ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.4-6.3) compared to the general population. PWH had a significantly higher 
prevalence of hypertension, liver diseases and malignancies than controls. 
Moderately severe haemophilia was associated with significantly higher rates of 
hospitalisations (52.5% vs. 14.5%), Emergency Department visits (89.1% vs. 
62.7%) and intensive care admissions (8.9% vs. 2.3%). Age > 65 years (adjusted 
odds ratio [aOR] 6.8) and presence of multiple comorbidities (aOR 3.9) were 
significant predictors of hospitalisations among PWH.
CONCLUSION: Despite advanced care, haemophilia is associated with higher acute 
care utilisation than the general population, highlighting the substantial 
burden of illness on patients and the health care system.

OBJECTIVES: The burden of neurological disorders is increasing worldwide, 
including Asia. The purpose of this study was to determine the burden of 
neurological disorders between 1990 and 2019 in Asia using the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) Sociodemographic Index.
DESIGN, SETTING, OUTCOME AND PARTICIPANTS: The GBD Study is updated every year 
and the most recent version provides the burden of diseases according to age, 
gender and region from 1990 to 2019. The burden of neurological disorders was 
evaluated as incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs), years of life lost and years lived with disability.
RESULTS: In 2019, DALYs of neurological diseases were 64.4 million in South-East 
Asia (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 45.2 to 94.2) and 85.0 million in Western 
Pacific regions (95% UI 63.0 to 118.5). Stroke, migraine, Alzheimer's disease 
and other dementias had the highest DALYs in the WHO South-East Asia and WHO 
Western Pacific regions in 2019. DALYs of stroke, Alzheimer's disease and other 
dementias, Parkinson's disease, brain and central nervous system cancer, 
multiple sclerosis, migraine and tension-type headache increased in both regions 
in 2019 compared with 1990. Infectious diseases such as tetanus, meningitis and 
encephalitis decreased in both regions. DALYs of idiopathic epilepsy and motor 
neuron disease increased in the WHO South-East Asia region and decreased in the 
WHO Western Pacific region.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the burden of neurological diseases in 
Asia. To reduce the burden of neurological diseases, strategies suitable for 
each country's real healthcare needs and challenges are needed; this study can 
serve as the cornerstone of these strategies.

Conduct disorder is one of the least widely recognized and studied psychiatric 
disorders. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the burden of conduct 
disorder at the global, regional, and national levels based on the Global Burden 
of Disease (GBD) 2019 estimates. Globally, the age-standardized prevalence rates 
(ASPRs) of conduct disorder slightly increased from 1990 to 2019 with an 
estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) at 0.147. Males had a higher burden 
than females, but females had a greater increment in ASPRs than males over time. 
In 2019, the highest ASPR of conduct disorder was observed in Western Europe, 
followed by Eastern Europe, with the lowest one found in East Asia, then South 
Asia. However, the most significant increment in ASPRs was observed in 
high-income North America, followed by East Asia, and South Asia. The EAPCs at 
the national level were negatively associated with the ASPRs in 1990. The burden 
of conduct disorder continues to increase globally, especially in high-income 
North America, East Asia, and South Asia, and should have more attention focused 
on it.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the relationships between 
family factors and outcomes for children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome 
(HLHS).
STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was ancillary to the Pediatric Heart 
Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction Extension Study to examine family 
factors including parental mental health, quality of life (QOL), family 
resources, function and management, and their relationships to child 
psychosocial outcomes (adaptive behavior, internalizing and externalizing 
behaviors and health-related quality of life [HRQOL]) at 6 years of age.
RESULTS: Participants were parents (115 mothers, 71 fathers) of children with 
HLHS. Parents reported anxiety, QOL and family resources that were worse than 
the general population; 33% reported family dysfunction. There were no 
meaningful differences between reports from mothers and fathers. Parental 
perception of better child health was associated with better family management 
of the condition (P < .05). Several family management factors explained a 
moderate amount of variance in adaptive behavior (ΔR2 = 0.08-0.14), adaptive 
skills (ΔR2 = 0.19-0.21), and HRQOL scores (ΔR2 = 0.04-0.18); little variance 
was explained in internalizing problems (ΔR2 = 0.02-0.03) (all P < .05) above 
and beyond demographic and clinical variables.
CONCLUSIONS: HLHS has a significant impact on both children and families. 
Relationships between child and family characteristics may impose risk or 
protection. Improved understanding of these associations should guide counseling 
and tailored interventions.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a risk 
prediction model for the prediction of long-term mortality for patients with 
severe asymptomatic de novo carotid stenosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy 
(PREMY2SE-CEA).
METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from a dedicated database of 
consecutive patients who had undergone elective CEA for severe (>70% using the 
NASCET [North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial] criteria) 
asymptomatic carotid stenosis at two Italian University Hospitals from 2008 
through 2016. Internal validation of the score was performed after random 
sampling in a 3:1 fashion. The primary end point of the PREMY2SE-CEA risk score 
was the 5-year mortality.
RESULTS: Of the 1214 patients, 901 were included in the derivation cohort and 
313 in the validation cohort. Using multivariable logistic regression with 
backward elimination, a parsimonious model was derived. A risk score 
incorporating eight risk factors was generated and found to be highly predictive 
of long-term mortality in the derivation (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.28-1.41; P < .001) and validation (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.21-1.37; 
P <.001) cohorts. The discrimination power in the receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis was C = 0.775 (95% CI, 0.74-.80), and the 
optimism-corrected area under the curve in the bootstrapped samples was 0.761 
(P < .001). A strong correlation was found between the predicted and actual 
mortality rates in the validation cohort (r = 0.71; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we have described the development, 
evaluation, and validation of a risk prediction model (PREMY2SE-CEA) for 
long-term mortality after CEA in asymptomatic patients. Physicians could use the 
PREMY2SE-CEA risk scoring tool to complement their estimates of life expectancy 
and prompt selective consideration of prophylactic CEA to improve the long-term 
benefits of interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Despite current standard of care (SoC), there is an unmet need for 
the treatment of active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The study assessed 
the cost-effectiveness of Acthar® Gel (repository corticotropin injection) 
versus SoC treatment in patients with active, moderate-to-severe SLE from the US 
payer and societal perspectives over 2 and 3 years.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness model was developed using a probabilistic 
cohort-level state-transition approach. Patients received Acthar Gel in an 
exacerbation state, and the outcomes were assessed at the end of a 3-month cycle 
for response achievement based on the probability of treatment success with 
Acthar Gel. Patients may sustain the response or experience an exacerbation. For 
the base case scenario, moderate-to-severe SLE was defined as British Isles 
Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-2004 ≥ 20 or SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 
(SLEDAI-2K) ≥ 10 and clinical response was based on SLE responder index (SRI)-4. 
Clinical response, productivity loss, and utility were derived from a phase 4 
SLE trial; cost and disutility estimates were sourced from the literature.
RESULTS: From a payer perspective, Acthar Gel versus SoC resulted in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $133,110 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) and $94,818 per QALY over 2 and 3 years, respectively. From a 
societal perspective, Acthar Gel versus SoC results in an ICER of $70,827 per 
QALY and $32,525 per QALY over 2 and 3 years, respectively. Results from the 
sensitivity and scenario analyses are consistent with those of the base case 
model.
CONCLUSIONS: Acthar Gel is a cost-effective, value-based treatment option for 
appropriate patients with moderate-to-severe SLE at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $150,000 over 2-3 years from the US payer and societal 
perspectives. Acthar Gel results in the reduction of direct medical and indirect 
costs.

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs, i.e., abuse, neglect, household 
dysfunction) represent a potential risk factor for a wide range of long-lasting 
diseases and shorter life expectancy. We recently described a 1-week residential 
group program, based on mindfulness training, artistic expression and EMDR group 
therapy, that significantly reduced PTSD-related symptoms and increased 
attention/awareness-related outcomes in adolescent girls with multiple ACEs in a 
randomized controlled study. Since epigenetic mechanisms (i.e., DNA methylation) 
have been associated with the long-lasting effects of ACEs, the present report 
extends these prior findings by exploring genome-wide DNA methylation changes 
following the program. Saliva samples from all participants (n = 44) were 
collected and genomic DNA was extracted prior (T1) and following (T2) the 
intervention. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using the MethylationEPIC 
beadchip array (Illumina) revealed 49 differentially methylated loci (DML; p 
value < 0.001; methylation change > 10%) that were annotated to genes with roles 
in biological processes linked to early childhood adversity (i.e., neural, 
immune, and endocrine pathways, cancer and cardiovascular disease). DNA 
sequences flanking these DML showed significant enrichment of transcription 
factor binding sites involved in inflammation, cancer, cardiovascular disease, 
and brain development. Methylation changes in SIRT5 and TRAPPC2L genes showed 
associations with changes in trauma-related psychological measures. Results 
presented here suggest that this multimodal group program for adolescents with 
multiple victimization modulates the DNA methylome at sites of potential 
relevance for health and behavioral disorders associated with ACEs.

OBJECTIVE: This research assesses the impact of an outcome-based payment 
arrangement (OBA) linking complete remission (CR) to survival as a means of 
maintaining cost-effectiveness for a chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) 
therapy in young patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
METHODS: A partitioned survival model (PSM) was used to model the 
cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel versus blinatumomab in ALL from the 
Australian healthcare system perspective. A decision tree modeled different OBAs 
by funneling patients into a series of PSMs based on response. Outcomes were 
informed by individual patient data, while costs followed Australian treatment 
practices. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were combined to 
calculate a single incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), reported in US 
dollars (2022) at a discount rate of 5% on costs and outcomes.
RESULTS: For the base case, incremental costs and benefit were $379,595 and 4.27 
QALYs, giving an ICER of $88,979. The ICER was most sensitive to discount rate 
($57,660-$75,081), "cure point" ($62,718-$116,206) and extrapolation method 
($76,018-$94,049). OBAs had a modest effect on the ICER when response rates 
varied. A responder-only payment was the most effective arrangement for 
maintaining the ICER ($88,249-$89,434), although this option was associated with 
the greatest financial uncertainty. A split payment arrangement (payment on 
infusion followed by payment on response) reduced variability in the ICER 
($82,650-$99,154) compared with a single, upfront payment ($77,599-$107,273).
CONCLUSION: OBAs had a modest impact on reducing cost-effectiveness uncertainty. 
The value of OBAs should be weighed against the additional resources needed to 
administer such arrangements, and importantly overall cost to government.

Progressive obstructive pulmonary disease is the primary life-shortening 
complication in people with Cystic Fibrosis (CF); improvement in life expectancy 
has led to increased prevalence of non-pulmonary complications. Patients with CF 
are considered to be at low risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). We report 
here a case series of six patients with CF with and without known cystic 
fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) who had acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
requiring coronary stent placement. This was a heterogeneous group of patients, 
without a clear pattern of consistent risk factors. Interestingly, most patients 
in this cohort had low LDL. In this review, we discuss risk factors of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) that may apply to the CF population. While CAD is 
rare in people with CF, it does occur. We postulate that the risk will grow with 
increased longevity and the increased prevalence of co-morbidities such as 
obesity and dyslipidemia.
