OBJECTIVE: to evaluate productivity targets achievement (PTA) in Dental 
Specialty Centers (DSCs) from Maranhão State, Brazil.
METHODS: this was an ecologic study using secondary data; an indicator for PTA 
was created for each subgroup of procedures.
RESULTS: 25 DSCs were evaluated; the PTA was higher for basic procedures (n=19), 
followed by endodontics (n=11), oral surgery (n=9) and periodontics (n=8); the 
best results were obtained at DSCs type II; higher PTA was associated with 
financial anticipation (basic procedures) and higher Human Development Index, 
life expectancy and social exclusion rate (endodontics); lower PTA was 
associated with larger population (endodontics/oral surgery), adherence to the 
Pact for Health (periodontics/endodontics), larger number of specialties 
(periodontics) and bigger DSC (oral surgery).
CONCLUSION: most DSCs did not achieve productivity targets, except for basic 
procedures; socioeconomic and health management characteristics of the 
municipalities were associated with the PTA; the DSCs characteristics explained 
little about the PTA.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: Gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy and second 
leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Chemotherapy options for patients who 
fail first-line treatment are limited. Thus the objective of this study was to 
assess the cost-effectiveness of second-line treatment options for patients with 
advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of six possible second-line treatment options for patients 
with advanced gastric cancer who have failed previous chemotherapy: irinotecan, 
docetaxel, paclitaxel, ramucirumab, paclitaxel plus ramucirumab, and palliative 
care.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The model was performed from a third-party 
payer's perspective to compare lifetime costs and health benefits associated 
with studied second-line therapies. Costs included only relevant direct medical 
costs. The model assumed chemotherapy cycle lengths of 30 days and a maximum 
number of 24 cycles. Systematic review of literature was performed to identify 
clinical data sources and utility and cost data. Quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. The 
primary outcome measure for this analysis was the ICER between different 
therapies, where the incremental cost was divided by the number of QALYs saved. 
The ICER was compared with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold that was set at 
$50,000/QALY gained, and an exploratory analysis using $160,000/QALY gained was 
also used. The model's robustness was tested by using 1-way sensitivity analyses 
and a 10,000 Monte Carlo simulation probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). 
Irinotecan had the lowest lifetime cost and was associated with a QALY gain of 
0.35 year. Docetaxel, ramucirumab alone, and palliative care were dominated 
strategies. Paclitaxel and the combination of paclitaxel plus ramucirumab led to 
higher QALYs gained, at an incremental cost of $86,815 and $1,056,125 per QALY 
gained, respectively. Based on our prespecified WTP threshold, our base case 
analysis demonstrated that irinotecan alone is the most cost-effective regimen, 
and both paclitaxel alone and the combination of paclitaxel and ramucirumab were 
not cost-effective (ICER more than $50,000). Both 1-way sensitivity analyses and 
PSA demonstrated the model's robustness. PSA illustrated that paclitaxel plus 
ramucirumab was extremely unlikely to be cost-effective at a WTP threshold less 
than $400,000/QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Irinotecan alone appears to be the most cost-effective second-line 
regimen for patients with gastric cancer. Paclitaxel may be cost-effective if 
the WTP threshold was set at $160,000/QALY gained.

Identifying mutations that cause cystic fibrosis (CF) is important for making an 
early, unambiguous diagnosis, which, in turn, is linked to better health and a 
greater life expectancy. In patients of African descent, a molecular diagnosis 
is often confounded by the fact that the majority of investigations undertaken 
to identify causative mutations have been conducted on European populations, and 
CF-causing mutations tend to be population specific. We undertook a survey of 
published data with the aim of identifying causative CF mutations in patients of 
African descent in the Americas. We found that 1,584 chromosomes had been tested 
in only 6 countries, of which 876 alleles (55.3%) still remained unidentified. 
There were 59 mutations identified. Of those, 41 have been shown to cause CF, 17 
have no associated functional studies, and one (R117H) is of varying clinical 
consequence. The most common mutations identified in the patients of African 
descent were: ΔF508 (29.4% identified in the United States, Colombia, Brazil, 
and Venezuela); 3120 + 1G>A (8.4% identified in Brazil, the United States, and 
Colombia); G85E (3.8% identified in Brazil); 1811 + 1.6kbA>G (3.7% identified in 
Colombia); and 1342 - 1G>C (3.1% identified in the United States). The majority 
of the mutations identified (81.4%) have been described in just one country. Our 
findings indicate that there is a need to fully characterize the spectrum of CF 
mutations in the diaspora to improve diagnostic accuracy for these patients and 
facilitate treatment.

BACKGROUND: Aboriginal Australians are at high risk of cardiovascular, metabolic 
and renal diseases, resulting in a marked reduction in life expectancy when 
compared to the rest of the Australian population. This is partly due to 
recognized environmental and lifestyle risk factors, but a contribution of 
genetic susceptibility is also likely.
METHODS: Using results from a comprehensive survey of one community (N = 1350 
examined individuals), we have tested for familial aggregation of plasma 
glucose, arterial blood pressure, albuminuria (measured as urinary albumin to 
creatinine ratio, UACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and 
quantified the contribution of variation at four candidate genes (ACE; TP53; 
ENOS3; MTHFR).
RESULTS: In the subsample of 357 individuals with complete genotype and 
phenotype data we showed that both UACR (h2 = 64%) and blood pressure (sBP 
h2 = 29%, dBP, h2 = 11%) were significantly heritable. The ACE 
insertion-deletion (P = 0.0009) and TP53 codon72 polymorphisms (P = 0.003) 
together contributed approximately 15% of the total heritability of UACR, with 
an effect of ACE genotype on BP also clearly evident.
CONCLUSIONS: While the effects of the ACE insertion-deletion on risk of renal 
disease (especially in the setting of diabetes) are well recognized, this is 
only the second study to implicate p53 genotype as a risk factor for albuminuria 
- the other being an earlier study we performed in a different Aboriginal 
community (McDonald et al., J Am Soc Nephrol 13: 677-83, 2002). We conclude that 
there are significant genetic contributions to the high prevalence of chronic 
diseases observed in this population.

BACKGROUND: The complexity of schizophrenia lies in the combination of 
psychiatric, somatic and social needs requiring care. The aim of the study was 
to compare perceived needs between groups with absence/presence of metabolic 
syndrome (MetS) and to analyze the relationship between needs, health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) and MetS in people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective 
disorder.
METHODS: A "real-world" cross-sectional study was set up with a comprehensive 
framework including the following, needs for care (Camberwell Assessment of Need 
Interview [CAN]), HRQoL (Euro Qol-5D Questionnaire), sociodemographic data, 
lifestyle habits, psychopathology (Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale 
[PANSS]), global functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning Scale [GAF]), 
anthropometric measurements and blood test results were assessed for an 
outpatient sample (n = 60).
RESULTS: The mean number of needs (given by CAN) was identified for both groups. 
Patients with MetS rated a higher number of needs compared to the group without 
this condition. Mobility problems (given by EQ-5D) were negatively associated 
with the number of total and unmet needs. For participants with MetS, HRQoL was 
related to the number of needs and unmet needs. For people with MetS, positive 
symptomatology score (given by PANSS) was related to the number of needs and met 
needs and general symptomatology was associated with total, met and unmet needs. 
For individuals without MetS, the global functioning score (given by GAF) was 
significantly inversely related with total, met and unmet needs.
CONCLUSIONS: Needs and HRQoL, as well as general symptomatology, were related 
only in patients with MetS. This has implications for treatment planning at the 
individual and organizational levels. An analysis of both physical and mental 
needs could provide a starting point for the extension of facilities in the 
health care system in order to reach the goal of improving quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Air pollution exposure has been associated with an increase in 
mortality rates, but few studies have focused on life expectancy, and most 
studies had restricted spatial coverage. A limited body of evidence is also 
suggestive for a beneficial association between residential exposure to 
greenness and mortality, but the evidence for such an association with life 
expectancy is still very scarce.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of exposure to air pollution and 
greenness with mortality and life expectancy in Spain.
METHODS: Mortality data from 2148 small areas (average population of 20,750 
inhabitants, and median population of 7672 inhabitants) covering Spain for years 
2009-2013 were obtained. Average annual levels of PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and O3 were 
derived from an air quality forecasting system at 4×4km resolution. The 
normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to assess greenness in 
each small area. Air pollution and greenness were linked to standardized 
mortality rates (SMRs) using Poisson regression and to life expectancy using 
linear regression. The models were adjusted for socioeconomic status and lung 
cancer mortality rates (as a proxy for smoking), and accounted for spatial 
autocorrelation.
RESULTS: The increase of 5μg/m3 in PM10, NO2 and O3 or of 2μg/m3 in PM2.5 
concentration resulted in a loss of life in years of 0.90 (95% credibility 
interval CI: 0.83, 0.98), 0.13 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.17), 0.20years (95% CI: 0.16, 
0.24) and 0.64 (0.59, 0.70), respectively. Similar associations were found in 
the SMR analysis, with stronger associations for PM2.5 and PM10, which were 
associated with an increased mortality risk of 3.7% (95% CI: 3.5%, 4.0%) and 
5.7% (95% CI: 5.4%, 6.1%). For greenness, a protective effect on mortality and 
longer life expectancy was only found in areas with lower socioeconomic status.
CONCLUSIONS: Air pollution concentrations were associated to important 
reductions in life expectancy. The reduction of air pollution should be a 
priority for public health.

INTRODUCTION: Since the initial description of HIV and AIDS, monumental efforts 
have been made both in the developed and developing countries to devise 
strategies and medications to control the disease. The advent of highly active 
antiretroviral therapy has now meant that the diagnosis of HIV is no longer a 
life-sentence and compliant patients with HIV can expect life expectancy similar 
to their noninfected peers. Consequently new challenges have arisen in the 
management of benign conditions.
AIM: To provide an overview of the key conditions and issues that HIV/AIDS 
patients may present with to an andrological service.
METHODS: Using PubMed, we screened the literature for studies on common 
andrological conditions specifically pertaining to HIV and AIDS.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The urological manifestations of HIV/AIDS in men have 
been summarized in an attempt to provide a useful guide for sexual health 
practitioners dealing with HIV-positive men.
RESULTS: As a result of advancements in pharmaceuticals, life expectancy of men 
infected with HIV has improved almost to that of the general population in 
developed countries. Therefore, clinicians are faced with non-life-threatening 
urological problems that affect the quality of life of men with HIV. The 
majority of these problems can be managed easily, by adapting a 
"patient-centered" approach, instead of "disease-centered" algorithms.
CONCLUSION: With improved survival and understanding, patients with HIV/AIDS can 
and do expect to enjoy a healthy sex life. With appropriate counseling around 
safe sex and careful management with consideration for disease-specific issues 
as well as the influence of medical therapy, patients can achieve a good quality 
of life.

Evolving Use of Natriuretic Peptides as Part of Strategies for Heart Failure 
Prevention.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) remains one of the major cardiovascular 
challenges to the Western world. Once established, HF is characterized by 
compromised life expectancy and quality of life with considerable dependence on 
hospital care for episodic clinical deterioration. Much is understood about the 
risk factors that predispose to the development of HF. With such a broad range 
of factors, it is clear that there is a large population at risk, potentially in 
excess of 25% of the adult population. Therein lies the major challenge at the 
outset of our efforts to prevent HF. With such a large population at risk, how 
do we develop an effective prevention strategy?
CONTENT: HF prevention requires a multimodal approach. In this review, we focus 
primarily on the role of natriuretic peptide (NP) as a tool in a prevention 
strategy.
SUMMARY: Prevention of HF is a major public health challenge, underlined by the 
concerning epidemiological trends, the associated costs, and the continued 
difficulty to find effective therapies for the growing number of patients with 
preserved systolic function HF. Population-based approaches focusing on 
lifestyle and risk factor control have made some impact but not to a 
satisfactory level and also tend to result in a uniform approach across a 
population with different risk profiles. Individualizing risk is therefore 
required, with emerging data indicating that NP-guided risk stratification and 
intervention can reduce downstream incident HF and other cardiovascular events.

Medical morbidity and mortality conferences: past, present and future.

George J(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Elderly Medicine, Cumberland Infirmary, Carlisle, UK.

Morbidity and mortality conferences (MMCs) have three potential aims-to improve 
patient safety by reducing adverse events and preventable deaths, to improve 
overall quality of care as part of the hospital governance structure and as 
educational learning events. At present, medical MMCs vary widely in format and 
attendance from hospital to hospital. The evidence for MMCs actually reducing 
adverse events and preventing avoidable deaths is disappointing. There is better 
evidence for their educational role. The majority of medical deaths in hospitals 
are frail older people with poor life expectancy in whom inadequate care is more 
likely to be due to errors of omission rather than commission. Medical MMCs 
should be multidisciplinary and led by a senior clinician to encourage 
discussion and reflection in a 'blame-free' environment. They should be learning 
events for both clinicians and the organisation as a whole with a structure to 
support this.

The human lifespan has traversed a long evolutionary and historical path, from 
short-lived primate ancestors to contemporary Japan, Sweden, and other longevity 
frontrunners. Analyzing this trajectory is crucial for understanding biological 
and sociocultural processes that determine the span of life. Here we reveal a 
fundamental regularity. Two straight lines describe the joint rise of life 
expectancy and lifespan equality: one for primates and the second one over the 
full range of human experience from average lifespans as low as 2 y during 
mortality crises to more than 87 y for Japanese women today. Across the primate 
order and across human populations, the lives of females tend to be longer and 
less variable than the lives of males, suggesting deep evolutionary roots to the 
male disadvantage. Our findings cast fresh light on primate evolution and human 
history, opening directions for research on inequality, sociality, and aging.

BACKGROUND: There are an increasing number of studies using simulation models to 
conduct cost-effectiveness analyses for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between improvements in glycosylated 
haemoglobin (HbA1c) and simulated health outcomes in type 2 diabetes 
cost-effectiveness studies.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted on MEDLINE and EMBASE to collect 
cost-effectiveness studies using type 2 diabetes simulation models that reported 
modelled health outcomes of blood glucose-related interventions in terms of 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) or life expectancy (LE). The data extracted 
included information used to characterise the study cohort, the intervention's 
treatment effects on risk factors and model outcomes. Linear regressions were 
used to test the relationship between the difference in HbA1c (∆HbA1c) and 
incremental QALYs (∆QALYs) or LE (∆LE) of intervention and control groups. The 
ratio between the ∆QALYs and ∆LE was calculated and a scatterplot between the 
ratio and ∆HbA1c was used to explore the relationship between these two.
RESULTS: Seventy-six studies were included in this research, contributing to 124 
pair of comparators. The pooled regressions indicated that the marginal effect 
of a 1% HbA1c decrease in intervention resulted in an increase in life-time 
QALYs and LE of 0.371 (95% confidence interval 0.286-0.456) and 0.642 (95% CI 
0.494-0.790), respectively. No evidence of heterogeneity between models was 
found. An inverse exponential relationship was found and fitted between the 
ratio (∆QALY/∆LE) and ∆HbA1c.
CONCLUSION: There is a consistent relationship between ∆HbA1c and ∆QALYs or ∆LE 
in cost-effectiveness analyses using type 2 diabetes simulation models. This 
relationship can be used as a diagnostic tool for decision makers.

BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments with duration (DCETTO) can be used to 
estimate utility values for preference-based measures, such as the EQ-5D-5L. For 
self-completion, the health dimensions are presented in a standard order. 
However, for valuation, this may result in order effects. Thus, it is important 
to understand whether health state dimension ordering affects values. The aim of 
this study was to examine the importance of dimension ordering on DCE values 
using EQ-5D-5L.
METHODS: A choice experiment presenting two health profiles and a third 
immediate death option was developed. A three-arm study was used, with the same 
120 choice sets presented online across each arm (n = 360 per arm). Arm 1 
presented the standard EQ-5D-5L dimension order, arm 2 randomised order between 
respondents, and arm 3 randomised within respondents. Conditional logit 
regression was used to assess model consistency, and scale parameter testing was 
used to assess model poolability.
RESULTS: There were minor inconsistencies across each arm, but the magnitudes of 
the coefficients produced were generally consistent. Arm 3 produced the largest 
range of utility values (1 to -0.980). Scale parameter testing suggested that 
the models did not differ, and the data could be pooled. Follow-up questions did 
not suggest variation in terms of difficulty.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the level of randomisation used in DCE 
health state valuation studies does not significantly impact values, and 
dimension order may not be as important as other study design issues. The 
results support past valuation studies that use the standard order of 
dimensions.

INTRODUCTION: We estimated the cost effectiveness of different cognitive 
screening tests for use by General Practitioners (GPs) to detect cognitive 
impairment in England.
METHODS: A patient-level cost-effectiveness model was developed using a 
simulated cohort that represents the elderly population in England (65 years and 
older). Each patient was followed over a lifetime period. Data from published 
sources were used to populate the model. The costs include government funded 
health and social care, private social care and informal care. Patient health 
benefit was measured and valued in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Base-case analyses found that adopting any of the three cognitive tests 
(Mini-Mental State Examination, 6-Item Cognitive Impairment Test or GPCOG 
(General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition)) delivered more QALYs for 
patients over their lifetime and made savings across sectors including 
healthcare, social care and informal care compared with GP unassisted judgement. 
The benefits were due to early access to medications. Among the three cognitive 
tests, adopting the GPCOG was considered the most cost-effective option with the 
highest Incremental Net Benefit (INB) at the threshold of £30 000 per QALY from 
both the National Health Service and Personal Social Service (NHS PSS) 
perspective (£195 034 per 1000 patients) and the broader perspective that 
includes private social care and informal care (£196 251 per 1000 patients). 
Uncertainty was assessed in both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses indicate that the use of any of the three cognitive 
tests could be considered a cost-effective strategy compared with GP unassisted 
judgement. The most cost-effective option in the base-case was the GPCOG.

INSTRUCTION: Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis can be a life-threatening 
complication after liver transplantation (LT). Although this complication is 
usually related to technical problems associated with vascular anastomosis, we 
report a case of IVC thrombosis which developed from a ligated large 
mesenteric-caval shunt.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 35-year-old man underwent LT from a brain-dead donor for 
primary sclerosing cholangitis. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) before LT 
showed a huge collateral vessel of the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) draining 
into the infra-renal IVC directly. To obtain sufficient portal vein (PV) flow, 
the dilated IMV collateral was ligated. A routine Doppler ultrasound study on 
post-operative day 1 showed thrombus inside the infra-hepatic IVC. Enhanced CT 
showed that this thrombus originated from a ligated collateral vessel of the IMV 
and extended into the IVC. He was hemodynamically stable and liver function was 
consistently stable. The size of IVC thrombus slowly reduced and he is currently 
in good condition without any symptoms.
DISCUSSION: To obtain adequate PV flow, ligation of a major PSS at the time of 
LT has been suggested. However, where it should be occluded has not been 
discussed. We should occlude a mesenteric-caval shunt not only at the upper 
side, but at the IVC side, based on findings from the current case.
CONCLUSION: To obtain appropriate PV flow toward a liver graft, occlusion of 
portosystemic shunts during LT is recommended. However, the position of ligation 
should be carefully considered to avoid extension of thrombus to major vessels.

Multimorbidity and Burden of Disease.

Brown TT, Guaraldi G.

With effective antiretroviral therapy, HIV has become a chronic disease, and 
life expectancy among HIV-infected persons is approaching that of HIV-uninfected 
persons. Despite this success, epidemiologic evidence suggests that the burden 
of multiple aging-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, liver 
disease, metabolic abnormalities, chronic kidney disease, cognitive dysfunction, 
and osteoporosis, is higher in HIV-infected persons compared to their 
HIV-uninfected peers. These comorbid diseases tend to cluster in a single 
person, leading to multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Emerging evidence suggests 
that multimorbidity among HIV-infected persons results in functional decline, 
reduced quality of life, and increased mortality. In this review, we examine the 
epidemiology, risk factors, etiologies, and potential consequences of 
multimorbidity in aging HIV-infected persons. With aggressive risk factor 
management for comorbidities and less toxic antiretroviral medications, the 
burden of multimorbidity in HIV-infected persons can be reduced.

Should you screen nursing home residents for cancer?

When considering screening for early cancer detection physicians should 
anticipate how they plan to follow up a screen detected cancer. Geriatric 
oncology research has developed validated functional assessments to estimate the 
balance of risk and benefit for treating cancers in the elderly. Robust elderly 
can benefit from treatment and therefore might benefit from screening. However 
the majority of elderly in long term residential care (LTC, or "the nursing 
home") would not benefit from cancer screening. The 1.4 million elderly people 
who reside in U.S. nursing homes represent the oldest and frailest segment of 
the aged population. On average, LTC residents have less than 5years estimated 
remaining life expectancy (RLE.) E.U. figures are similar. The majority have 
multiple functional deficits that would result in geriatric oncology screening 
scores in the frail range, at very high risk for severe toxicity from standard 
chemotherapy or extensive surgery. Therefore screening for asymptomatic cancer 
is not likely to benefit and has the potential to harm elderly nursing home 
residents.

The establishment and maintenance of axonal patterning is crucial for neuronal 
function. To identify the molecular systems that operate locally to control 
axonal structure, it is important to manipulate molecular functions in 
restricted subcellular areas for a long period of time. Microfluidic devices can 
be powerful tools for such purposes. In this study, we demonstrate the 
application of a microfluidic device to clarify the function of local Ca2+ 
signals in axons. Membrane depolarization significantly induced axonal 
branch-extension in cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Local 
application of nifedipine using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidic 
device demonstrated that Ca2+ entry from the axonal region via L-type 
voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCC) is required for branch extension. 
Furthermore, we developed a method for locally controlling protein levels by 
combining genetic techniques and use of a microfluidic culture system. A vector 
for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fused to a destabilizing domain 
derived from E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecDHFR) is introduced in neurons 
by electroporation. By local application of the DHFR ligand, trimethoprim (TMP) 
using a microfluidic device, we were able to manipulate differentially the level 
of fusion protein between axons and somatodendrites. The present study revealed 
the effectiveness of microfluidic devices to address fundamental biological 
issues at subcellular levels, and the possibility of their development in 
combination with molecular techniques.

BACKGROUND: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an inherited autosomal 
dominant disease presenting with recurrent bleeding episodes and iron deficiency 
anemia due to vascular malformations. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is 
associated with an increased risk of stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding and 
pulmonary hypertension and life expectancy is significantly reduced. Excess 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in the 
pathophysiology of the disease.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report about a male patient with hereditary 
hemorrhagic telangiectasia presenting with pulmonary and central nervous system 
involvement experiencing repetitive nosebleeds, necessitating frequent local 
cauterization and transfusion of more than 100 units of packed red blood cells. 
After initiation of temporary therapy with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab at 
a dosage of 1 mg/kg body weight every 2 weeks, the nose bleeding episodes and 
the epistaxis severity score significantly decreased and long-lasting 
transfusion independence was achieved. Reinitiation of low-dose bevacizumab 
after relapse again proved effective without any documented therapy-related 
adverse events. In comparison to other reported anti-VEGF antibody protocols in 
hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, our treatment approach proved to be 
cost-efficient.
CONCLUSION: Intermittent low-dose therapy with bevacizumab represents an 
effective and cost-efficient treatment option for transfusion-dependent patients 
with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

Going beyond life expectancy in assessments of health systems' performance: life 
expectancy adjusted by perceived health status.

International comparisons of health systems data have been used to guide health 
policy. Health systems performance is generally evaluated on how different 
factors contribute to mortality and longevity. Fewer studies scrutinize the 
factors that determine morbidity in different countries, partly because 
indicators that assess morbidity on a country level are not as widely available 
as mortality and longevity data. We introduce a new health status indicator able 
to combine mortality and morbidity in a single composite measure for each 
country and gender at a point in time (LEAPHS), yielding the average number of 
years that men (women) can expect to live in "good" (or better) health. Using 
the Sullivan method we combine the mortality risk, calculated for specific age 
and gender groups, with perceived health status for the same age and gender 
groups, and we estimate how medical care and various socio-economic, 
environmental and structural, lifestyle, and technological factors affect LEAPHS 
and life expectancy at birth for a large panel of thirty OECD countries. We find 
that some variables (alcohol consumption, urbanization) have a significant 
effect on both LEAPHS and life expectancy, while one variable (the number of 
hospitals) has a significant effect for both genders on life expectancy only. 
However, the effects of many other variables (health expenditure per capita, 
health expenditure per capita squared, GDP growth, and technology) were only 
significant predictors for LEAPHS. This leads us to conclude that LEAPHS is able 
to capture the impact of some health determinants not captured by life 
expectancy at birth. While we believe this new measure may be useful for health 
economists and statisticians doing cross-country analyses, further comparisons 
with other measures may be useful.

BACKGROUND: Recently, awareness of the cumulative radiation exposure for 
pediatric oncology patients has been increasing, together with increased 
survival rates and longer life expectancy. The aim of our study was to quantify 
the amount of ionising radiation from imaging modalities of pediatric oncology 
patients.
METHODS: Eighty-eight patients who were diagnosed with childhood cancer and 
followed up for 5 years between 2004-2014 in our center were included in the 
study. Patients' medical files were reviewed retrospectively for imaging history 
in the first 5 years after diagnosis. Total estimated effective doses from 
radiologic imaging modalities were determined. Also, the basic demographic data, 
histologic type, stage, and outcomes of disease were collected for all patients.
RESULTS: The individual total estimated effective doses ranged from 8.73 to 167 
mSv, with a median of 62.92 mSv. Computed tomography was the greatest 
contributor of total effective doses. The doses ranged 21.45-113.20 mSv (median: 
62.92 mSv) in Hodgkin lymphoma, 12.53-167.10 mSv (median: 52 mSv) in non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, 4.13-172.98 mSv (median: 52 mSv) in neuroblastoma, 31-149.89 mSv 
(median: 63.10 mSv) in Wilms' tumor, 11.50-73.72 mSv (median: 36.90 mSv) in germ 
cell tumor, 26.46-125.86 mSv (median: 80.90 mSv) in other solid tumor and 
0.02-13.31 mSv (5.25 mSv) in brain tumor subgroup. Twenty-two children (25%) 
died with progressive disease during the 5-year follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: Similar to previous studies, the total estimated effective doses in 
children with cancer have been found various according to diagnosis, stage and 
clinical course. To clarify the harmfull effects of radiation burden, 
prospective studies should be conducted in children with cancer.
