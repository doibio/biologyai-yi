RESULTS: At baseline, 92% of patients/caregivers reported changes in cognition 
or mood. Neurological examinations and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale 
scores were largely normal; however, on many tests of memory and language, 
nearly half of individuals showed deficits. After surgery, 45% had no deficits 
on neurological examination, whereas 55% had only transient or mild 
difficulties. Follow-up neuropsychological testing found most performances 
stable to improved, particularly in language, although some patients showed 
declines on memory tasks.
CONCLUSION: Most LGG patients in this series presented with normal neurological 
examinations and cognitive screening, but showed subjective cognitive and mood 
concerns and cognitive decline on neuropsychological testing, suggesting the 
importance of comprehensive evaluation. After awake mapping, language tended to 
be preserved, but memory demonstrated decline in some patients. These results 
highlight the importance of establishing a cognitive baseline before surgical 
resection and further suggest that awake mapping techniques provide reasonable 
language outcomes in individuals with LGG in eloquent regions.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: As life expectancy has increased, the number of elderly 
patients who need long-term care has grown rapidly. Mortality in patients with 
colitis in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) is increasing. We intend to 
investigate the main causes of colitis in LTCFs compared to those of colitis in 
local communities, and to identify the clinical features and risk factors of 
patients with colitis in LTCFs.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed epidemiology, medical conditions, 
laboratory values, diagnoses, and clinical courses of elderly patients aged ≥65 
who were admitted to the Ewha Womans University hospital with colitis between 
January 2007 and July 2012.
RESULTS: Patients with colitis in LTCFs (n=20) were compared with elderly 
patients with colitis in local communities (n=154). Fifty-five percent of 
colitis in LTCFs was caused by Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), 30% was 
due to ischemic colitis, and 15% was due to non-specific colitis. Non-specific 
colitis was the most common (63%) in the community group. Clinical outcomes were 
also significantly different between both groups: higher mortality (10.0% vs. 
0.64%, P=0.021), higher requirement for intensive care units care (50.0% vs. 
18.8%, P<0.01) in LTCFs group. In univariate analysis, the most significant risk 
factor for death in patients in LTCFs was decreased mental faculties.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients in LTCFs showed worse clinical outcomes and a much higher 
prevalence of CDI compared to patients from local communities. We suggest early 
and active evaluation, such as endoscopic examination, for differential 
diagnosis in patients in LTCFs.

Aging has become an important topic for scientific research because life 
expectancy and the number of men and women in older age groups have increased 
dramatically in the last century. This is true in most countries of the world 
including the Republic of Korea and the United States. From a rehabilitation 
perspective, the most important associated issue is a progressive decline in 
functional capacity and independence. Sarcopenia is partly responsible for this 
decline. Many changes underlying the loss of muscle mass and force-generating 
capacity of skeletal muscle can be understood at the cellular and molecular 
levels. Muscle size and architecture are both altered with advanced adult age. 
Further, changes in myofibers include impairments in several physiological 
domains including muscle fiber activation, excitation-contraction coupling, 
actin-myosin cross-bridge interaction, energy production, and repair and 
regeneration. A thorough understanding of these alterations can lead to the 
design of improved preventative and rehabilitative interventions, such as 
personalized exercise training programs.

Situs inversus totalis is a rare condition affecting intra abdominal and intra 
thoracic organs. Situs inversus usually remains asymptomatic. Life expectancy is 
normal in the absence of rare cardiac abnormalities. Left sided gallbladder can 
occur even without situs inversus totalis. Cholelithiasis is not more common in 
patients with situs inversus than the general population. However, these 
patients may pose a diagnostic difficulty. An ultrasound scan can confirm the 
presence of gallstones and the left-sided gallbladder. Here we present the case 
of a 40-year female with this diagnosis who was diagnosed on abdominal scanning 
and underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for left sided cholelithiasis.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of lobectomy on 
life expectancy in healthy smokers and consider the implications for lung cancer 
screening.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study that provided a minimum 
of 15 years of follow-up, we analyzed lung cancer survival, all-cause survival, 
and fatality (1-survival) of 261 persons with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer 
who underwent lobectomy at Portland Providence Medical Center between 1978 and 
1994. We: (1) compared 5-year disease-free fatality (non-lung-cancer fatality) 
with lung cancer fatality; and (2) based on actuarial data that demonstrated 
life expectancy equivalence of the healthiest smokers (whom we assumed would be 
comparable with subjects judged eligible for lobectomy) in the US population, we 
compared their long-term, disease-free survival (our primary end point) with 
actuarial expectations by computing the Kaplan-Meier survival function of the 
differences between lifetimes since surgery in disease-free persons versus 
matched, expected remaining lifetimes in the US population.
RESULTS: (1) Five-year disease-free fatality (16.1%) was 58% as high as 5-year 
lung cancer fatality (27.6%); (2) disease-free survival was reduced by 6.9-years 
(95% confidence interval, 5.5-8.3), 41% of actuarial life expectancy (17 years). 
The divergence from expected survival took place largely after 6 years of 
follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Lobectomy materially diminishes long-term disease-free survival in 
the healthiest smokers--persons judged healthy enough to tolerate major surgery 
and to have sufficient pulmonary reserve to sustain loss of one-fifth of their 
lung tissue. In screened populations, diminished survival in overdiagnosed 
persons will offset, to an undetermined extent, the mortality benefit imparted 
by preemption of advanced lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is a common cause of disability and mortality among the 
elderly. Declining incidence trends have been observed in Sweden. Still, this 
condition remains a significant public health problem since Sweden has one of 
the highest incidences worldwide. Yet, no Swedish lifetime risk or survival 
trends have been presented. By examining how hip fracture incidence, 
post-fracture survival, as well as lifetime risk have developed between 1995 and 
2010 in Sweden, this study aims to establish how the burden hip fractures pose 
on the elderly changed over time, in order to inform initiatives for 
improvements of their health.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The entire Swedish population 60 years-old and above was 
followed between 1987 and 2010 in the National Patient Register and the Cause of 
Death Register. Annual age-specific hip fracture cumulative incidence was 
estimated using hospital admissions for hip fractures. Three-month and one-year 
survival after the first hip fracture were also estimated. Period life table was 
used to assess lifetime risk of hip fractures occurring from age 60 and above, 
and the expected mean age of the first hip fracture.
RESULTS: The age-specific hip fracture incidence decreased between 1995 and 2010 
in all ages up to 94 years, on average by 1% per year. The lifetime risk 
remained almost stable, between 9% and 11% for men, and between 18% and 20% for 
women. The expected mean age of a first hip fracture increased by 2.5 years for 
men and by 2.2 years for women. No improvements over time were observed for the 
3-month survival for men, while for women a 1% decrease per year was observed. 
The 1-year survival slightly increased over time for men (0.4% per year) while 
no improvement was observed for women.
CONCLUSIONS: The age-specific hip fracture incidence has decreased over time. 
Yet the lifetime risk of a hip fracture has not decreased because life 
expectancy in the population has increased in parallel. Overall, survival after 
hip fracture has not improved.

BACKGROUND: Surgical delivery varies 200-fold across countries. No direct 
correlation exists, however, between surgical delivery and health outcomes, 
making it difficult to pinpoint a goal for surgical scale-up. This report 
determines the amount of surgery that would be delivered worldwide if the world 
aligned itself with countries providing the best health outcomes.
METHODS: Annual rates of surgical delivery have been published previously for 
129 countries. Five health outcomes were plotted against reported surgical 
delivery. Univariate and multivariate polynomial regression curves were fit, and 
the optimal point on each regression curve was determined by solving for 
first-order conditions. The country closest to the optimum for each health 
outcome was taken as representative of the best-performing health system. 
Monetary inputs to and surgical procedures provided by these systems were scaled 
to the global population.
RESULTS: For 3 of the 5 health outcomes, optima could be found. Globally, 315 
million procedures currently are provided annually. If global delivery mirrored 
the 3 best-performing countries, between 360 million and 460 million cases would 
be provided annually. With population growth, this will increase to 
approximately half a billion cases by 2030. Health systems delivering these 
outcomes spend approximately 10% of their GDP on health.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to provide empirical evidence for the 
surgical output that an ideal health system would provide. Our results project 
ideal delivery worldwide of approximately 550 million annual surgical cases 
by 2030.

Cost-effectiveness of DTG + ABC/3TC versus EFV/TDF/FTC for first-line treatment 
of HIV-1 in the United States.

OBJECTIVE: Data from the SINGLE trial demonstrated that 88% of treatment-naïve 
HIV-1 patients treated with dolutegravir and abacavir/lamivudine (DTG + ABC/3TC) 
achieved viral suppression at 48 weeks compared with 81% of patients treated 
with efavirenz/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (EFV/TDF/FTC). It is 
unclear how this difference in short-term efficacy impacts long-term 
cost-effectiveness of these regimens. This study sought to evaluate long-term 
cost-effectiveness of DTG + ABC/3TC vs EFV/TDF/FTC from a US payer perspective.
METHODS: This study is an individual discrete-event simulation which tracked the 
disease status and treatment pathway of HIV-1 patients. The model simulated 
treatment over a lifetime horizon by tracking change in patients' CD4 count, 
clinical events occurrence (opportunistic infections, cancer, and cardiovascular 
events), treatment switch, and death. The model included up to four lines of 
treatment. Baseline patient characteristics, efficacy, and safety of 
DTG + ABC/3TC and EFV/TDF/FTC were informed by data from the SINGLE trial. The 
efficacy of subsequent treatment lines, clinical event risks, mortality, cost, 
and utility inputs were based on literature and expert opinion. Outcomes were 
lifetime discounted medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Compared with EFV/TDF/FTC, DTG + ABC/3TC increased lifetime costs by 
$19,153 and per person survival by 0.12 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of 
$158,890/QALY. ICERs comparing DTG + ABC/3TC to EFV/TDF/FTC remained above the 
traditional, US willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained in all 
scenarios, and above $100,000 or $150,000/QALY gained in most scenarios.
LIMITATIONS: Due to data limitations, the treatment patterns, CD4 count during 
viral rebound and treatment switch, viral rebound after trial end, and long-term 
adverse event-related treatment discontinuation were based on assumptions, 
presented to and approved by clinical experts.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with EFV/TDF/FTC, DTG + ABC/3TC resulted in higher cost 
and only slightly increased QALYs over a lifetime, with an ICER that exceeded 
the standard cost-effectiveness threshold. This indicates that the incremental 
benefit in effectiveness associated with DTG + ABC/3TC may not be worth the 
incremental increase in costs.

Patients with recurrence of high-grade glioma (HGG) after bevacizumab (BEV) have 
an extremely poor prognosis. Etirinotecan pegol (EP) is the first long-acting 
topoisomerase-I inhibitor designed to concentrate in and provide continuous 
tumor exposure throughout the entire chemotherapy cycle. Here we report results 
of a Phase 2, single arm, open-label trial evaluating EP in HGG patients who 
progressed after BEV. Patients age >18 with histologically proven anaplastic 
astrocytoma or glioblastoma (GB) who previously received standard 
chemo-radiation and recurred after BEV were eligible. A predicted life 
expectancy >6 weeks and KPS ≥ 50 were required. The primary endpoint was PFS at 
6-weeks. Secondary endpoint was overall survival from first EP infusion. 
Response was assessed by RANO criteria. Single agent EP was administered IV 
every 3 weeks at 145 mg/m2. Patients did not receive BEV while on EP. 20 
patients (90 % GB) were enrolled with a median age of 50 and median KPS of 70. 
Three patients with GB (16.7 % of GB) had partial MRI responses. 6-week PFS was 
55 %. Median and 6-month PFS were 2.2 months (95 % CI 1.4-3.4 months) and 11.2 % 
(95 % CI 1.9-28.9 %) respectively. Median overall survival from first EP 
infusion was 4.5 months (95 % CI 2.4-5.9). Only one patient had grade 3 toxicity 
(diarrhea with dehydration) attributable to EP. Hematologic toxicity was mild. 
Three patients had confirmed partial responses according to RANO criteria. These 
clinical data combined with a favorable safety profile warrant further clinical 
investigation of this agent in HGG.

PURPOSE: Decisions on the type of adjuvant treatment in older breast cancer 
patients are challenging. Side effects of chemotherapy have to be weighed 
against life expectancy, comorbidities, functional status, and frailty on the 
basis of studies usually excluding patients over 69 years. To aid this decision, 
we analyzed a database of 6000 unselected patients and of those evaluated 
elderly primary breast cancer patients with hormone receptor-negative tumors 
from 1963 until 2003 in respect of survival data depending on adjuvant 
treatment.
METHODS: A total of 131 elderly (i.e., >65 years) patients were observed 
retrospectively for a median of 72 months. Patients received breast-conserving 
therapy or mastectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and endocrine 
therapy. Data were collected from a hospital-intern database.
RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 72 years. Mostly, tumors were small (81 % 
T1, 17 % T2) but of unfavorable grading (40 % G2, 35 % G3). Lymph nodes were 
positive in 42 %. Mastectomy was performed in 65 %. While 42 % of patients 
received radiotherapy, only 10 % were treated with chemotherapy. Patients with 
G2 and G3 tumors (p = 0.027), younger women (p = 0.012), and patients with 
positive lymph node status (p < 0.0001) more likely received chemotherapy. 
Recurrence-free survival was longer in patients without chemotherapy (37 vs. 29 
months, p = 0.234). Overall survival was non-significantly shorter in patients 
who received chemotherapy (59 vs. 81 months, p = 0.131).
CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with 
improved survival, presumably caused by an a priori poor prognosis of these 
patients. For an aging society more data are urgently needed to help selecting 
and personalizing adjuvant treatment within subgroups of breast cancer in older 
women.

PURPOSE: To assess the incremental, comparative effectiveness (patient value 
gain) and cost effectiveness (financial value gain) associated with 0.3-mg 
intravitreal ranibizumab injection therapy versus sham therapy for diabetic 
macular edema (DME).
DESIGN: Value-Based Medicine (Center for Value-Based Medicine, Flourtown, PA) 
14-year, cost-utility analysis using patient preferences and 2012 United States 
real dollars.
PARTICIPANTS: Published data from the identical Ranibizumab Injection in 
Subjects with Clinically Significant Macular Edema with Center Involvement 
Secondary to Diabetes Mellitus (RISE and RIDE) clinical trials.
METHODS: An incremental cost-utility analysis was performed using societal and 
third-party insurer cost perspectives. Costs and outcomes were discounted with 
net present value analysis at 3% per annum.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incremental comparative effectiveness was measured 
in: (1) quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain and (2) percent patient value 
(quality-of-life) gain. Cost effectiveness was quantified with the cost-utility 
ratio (CUR) measured as $/QALY.
RESULTS: The 14-year, incremental patient value gain conferred by intravitreal 
ranibizumab therapy for diabetic maculopathy was 0.9981 QALY, equating to an 
11.6% improvement in quality of life. The direct, ophthalmic medical cost for 
ranibizumab therapy in 1 eye was $30 116, whereas for 2 eyes it was $56 336. The 
direct, nonophthalmic, medical costs saved from decreased depression, injury, 
skilled nursing facility admissions, nursing home admissions, and other 
vision-associated costs totaled $51 758, resulting in an overall direct medical 
cost of $4578. The net mean societal cost for bilateral ranibizumab therapy was 
-$30 807. Of this total, decreased caregiver costs accrued a $31 406 savings 
against the direct medical costs, whereas decreased wage losses accrued a $3978 
savings. The third-party insurer CUR for bilateral ranibizumab therapy was 
$4587/QALY. The societal cost perspective for bilateral therapy was -$30 
807/QALY, indicating that ranibizumab therapy dominated sham therapy because it 
conferred both a positive QALY gain of 0.9981 and a financial value gain 
(positive financial return on investment) of $30 807 referent to the direct 
ophthalmic medical costs expended.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal ranibizumab therapy for the treatment of DME confers 
considerable patient (human) value gain. It also accrues financial value to 
patients, public and private insurers, and society.

BACKGROUND: To plan for pensions and health and social services, future 
mortality and life expectancy need to be forecast. Consistent forecasts for all 
subnational units within a country are very rare. Our aim was to forecast 
mortality and life expectancy for England and Wales' districts.
METHODS: We developed Bayesian spatiotemporal models for forecasting of 
age-specific mortality and life expectancy at a local, small-area level. The 
models included components that accounted for mortality in relation to age, 
birth cohort, time, and space. We used geocoded mortality and population data 
between 1981 and 2012 from the Office for National Statistics together with the 
model with the smallest error to forecast age-specific death rates and life 
expectancy to 2030 for 375 of England and Wales' 376 districts. We measured 
model performance by withholding recent data and comparing forecasts with this 
withheld data.
FINDINGS: Life expectancy at birth in England and Wales was 79·5 years (95% 
credible interval 79·5-79·6) for men and 83·3 years (83·3-83·4) for women in 
2012. District life expectancies ranged between 75·2 years (74·9-75·6) and 83·4 
years (82·1-84·8) for men and between 80·2 years (79·8-80·5) and 87·3 years 
(86·0-88·8) for women. Between 1981 and 2012, life expectancy increased by 8·2 
years for men and 6·0 years for women, closing the female-male gap from 6·0 to 
3·8 years. National life expectancy in 2030 is expected to reach 85·7 
(84·2-87·4) years for men and 87·6 (86·7-88·9) years for women, further reducing 
the female advantage to 1·9 years. Life expectancy will reach or surpass 81·4 
years for men and reach or surpass 84·5 years for women in every district by 
2030. Longevity inequality across districts, measured as the difference between 
the 1st and 99th percentiles of district life expectancies, has risen since 
1981, and is forecast to rise steadily to 8·3 years (6·8-9·7) for men and 8·3 
years (7·1-9·4) for women by 2030.
INTERPRETATION: Present forecasts underestimate the expected rise in life 
expectancy, especially for men, and hence the need to provide improved health 
and social services and pensions for elderly people in England and Wales. Health 
and social policies are needed to curb widening life expectancy inequalities, 
help deprived districts catch up in longevity gains, and avoid a so-called grand 
divergence in health and longevity.

BACKGROUND: Prolonged sitting is linked to various deleterious health outcomes. 
The alterability of the sitting time (ST)-health relationship is not fully 
established however and warrants study within populations susceptible to high 
ST.
METHODS: We assessed the mortality rates of post-menopausal women from the 
Women's Health Initiative (WHI) observational study, a 15-year prospective study 
of post-menopausal women aged 50-79 years, according to their change in ST 
between baseline and year six. A total of 77 801 participants had information at 
both times on which to be cross-classified into the following: (i) high ST at 
baseline and follow-up; (ii) low ST at baseline and follow-up; (iii) increased 
ST and (iv) decreased ST. Cox regression was used to assess the relationship 
between all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality with change in ST.
RESULTS: At the end of follow-up, there were 1855 deaths. Compared with high ST 
maintainers, low ST maintainers had a 51 and 48% lower risk of all-cause and 
cancer mortality, respectively. Reducing sitting also resulted in a protective 
rate of 29% for all-cause and 27% for cancer mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight not only the benefit of maintaining minimal 
ST, but also the utility of decreasing ST in older women, if current levels are 
high.

INTRODUCTION: Elderly patients with coexisting frailty and multiple 
comorbidities frequently present to the emergency department (ED). Because 
non-cardiovascular comorbidities and declining health status may affect their 
life expectancy, management of these patients should start in the ED. This study 
evaluated the role of Gold Standards Framework (GSF) criteria for identifying 
patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) approaching end of life.
METHODS: All consecutive patients admitted to the ED and hospitalised with a 
diagnosis of ACS between May 2012 and July 2012 were included. According to GSF 
criteria, patients were labelled as positive GSF status when they met at least 
one general criterion and two heart disease criteria; furthermore, traditional 
cardiovascular risk scores (the Global Registry for Acute Coronary Events 
(GRACE) score and the Age, Creatinine and Ejection Fraction (ACEF) score) were 
calculated and WHOQOL-BREF was assessed. Mortality and repeat hospitalisation 
due to cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes were evaluated at 3-month 
and 12-month follow-up.
RESULTS: From a total of 156 patients with ACS enrolled, 22 (14%) had a positive 
GSF. A positive GSF was associated with higher rate of non-cardiovascular events 
(22.7% vs 6.7%; p=0.03) at 3 months and higher rates of both cardiovascular and 
non-cardiovascular events (36% vs 16.4%; p=0.04 and 27.3% vs 6.7%; p=0.009, 
respectively) at 12 months. In multivariate analysis, an in-hospital GRACE score 
was a predictor of cardiovascular events, while a positive GSF independently 
predicted non-cardiovascular events.
CONCLUSIONS: The GSF score independently predicts non-cardiovascular events in 
patients presenting with ACS and may be used along with traditional 
cardiovascular risk scores in choosing wisely the most appropriate treatment. 
The present results need to be externally validated on larger samples.

Demography and conservation of the Mediterranean fin whale (Balaenoptera 
physalus): what clues can be obtained from photo-identification data.

Rossi A, Panigada S, Arrigoni M, Zanardelli M, Cimmino C, Marangi L, Manfredi P, 
Santangelo G.

Long-lived and slow reproducing species, such as cetaceans, are among the most 
critical conservation units: a demographic approach can be very useful for their 
management and conservation. In the present work, we examined, by demographic 
tools, the most exhaustive photo-identification database available for the 
Mediterranean fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) population, recorded by Tethys 
Research Institute between 1990 and 2007 in the Western Ligurian Sea. A total of 
31,782 km were covered and 548 fin whale sightings were recorded. The occurrence 
of the target species was uneven across the years and months: an anomalous 
reduction of sightings occurred between 2001 and 2004. Moreover, the target 
species is likely to concentrate in the study area in the summer months and 
probably moves to other areas in the early autumn. Using the 
photo-identification technique, 431 different individuals were photo-identified, 
but only 318 of them were sized: 6 calves (≤ 10 meters), 33 immature (10-15 m), 
261 adolescent-adult (> 15 m) and 18 olds (≥ 20 m). For the first time the site 
of the fin whale sub-population in the Pelagos Sanctuary was obtained by 
photo-identification and mark-recapture techniques. These techniques were used 
to estimate the site of the sub-population composed by individuals > 15 meters 
as 539 fin whales (95% confidence interval = 345-732) over the period 1990-1999. 
The number of calves was likely underestimated, as the sighting period (late 
spring-summer) was shifted with respect to the peak of births (late autumn). To 
fill this gap of knowledge we propose a simple mathematical model for the yearly 
dynamics of calves. After correcting the number of calves, a static life history 
table for the period 1990-2007 was set out. Our results highlight the highest 
survival proportions between calf and immature (61.1%) and the minimum between 
adolescent-adult and old (2.5%) vital stages. The overall life expectancy is 
estimated to be 6.3 years while the life expectancy of individuals entering the 
adolescent-adult stage is 14.3 years. This paper aims at providing a 
contribution for improving the conservation efforts and the demographic 
knowledge on fin whales in the Pelagos Sanctuary.

Potential long-term risks associated with maternal aging (the role of the 
mitochondria).

Wilding M(1).

Author information:

The mean age at which women create families in Western society is increasing. 
This is in spite of the fact that reproduction in later life is subject to 
various difficulties, such as the lower probability of conception in relation to 
maternal age, the increase in spontaneous pregnancy loss, and higher obstetric 
risk. In this review of recent data, we suggest that a fourth effect, the 
decrease in lifespan of children in relation to the age of conception of the 
mother, can be added to the list. We discuss this effect in relation to the 
transmission of the mitochondria exclusively through the female germ line and 
the effect of age on this organelle. Data from our own studies and the animal 
literature as a whole suggest that this effect could be due to the transmission 
of damaged mitochondrial DNA, and further indicate that the effect is more 
widespread than previously considered.

Associations of multiple chronic health conditions with active life expectancy 
in the United States.

(1)a Department of Public Health Sciences , University of North Carolina at 
Charlotte , Charlotte , NC , USA.

PURPOSE: To estimate associations of eight common health conditions with life 
expectancy (LE) and disabled life expectancy (DLE), the percentage of life 
disabled in an activity of daily living.
METHODS: Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics represented Americans ages 
55+ (1999-2011, n = 2118, mean baseline age 63.3, 19 447 person-years). We 
estimated probabilities of death and disability with multinomial logistic Markov 
models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity and education. We used the 
probabilities to create large populations with microsimulations, each individual 
having a known monthly disability status, age 55 through death. We calculated LE 
and DLE for the populations, repeating each microsimulation 100 times for 
confidence intervals.
RESULTS: Nearly half (48.8%) of the participants had two or more conditions, 
24.7% had three or more, 11.5% had four or more. Having any one condition 
significantly reduced LE. For example, white women lived to age 87.3 (95% 
confidence interval 86.5-88.1) with no conditions, 75.8 (70.9-80.7) with heart 
disease. Multiple conditions did not further reduce LE but often increased DLE, 
which for white women was 12.2% (11.1-13.2) with no conditions, 39.1% 
(28.3-49.8) with heart disease and 47.0% (46.9-47.1) with heart disease, 
diabetes and hypertension.
CONCLUSION: The increasing prevalence of multiple chronic conditions may 
substantially increase disability. Implications for Rehabilitation The growing 
number of individuals with multiple chronic conditions will greatly increase the 
prevalence of disability in later life. It is important for rehabilitation 
science, practice and policy to address this emerging epidemiological 
transition. Rehabilitation is especially important for people with pre-diabetes, 
developing heart disease or early stages of other cardiovascular-related 
diseases as avoiding the development of multiple chronic diseases through 
increased activity may greatly reduce disability and mortality.

INTRODUCTION: The completeness of cytoreduction has been considerated as 
fundamental in increasing the life expectancy in patients with peritoneal 
carcinosis (PC) in gastric cancer. However no definitive data about the real 
effect of complete cytoreduction (CC) have still been published. Moreover the 
PCI cut-off to attempt CC with a reasonable risk-benefit ratio still lacks.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis of trials of 
complete vs incomplete cytoreduction in patients with peritoneal carcinosis from 
GC was performed.
RESULTS: Nine trials have been included (748 patients: 417 with CC0-CC1 and 324 
with CC2-CC3 cytoreduction). 1, 2, 3 and 5 years survival is favorable to 
CC0-CC1 (Risk Ratio: 2.41, 8.18, 8.66, and 7.96 respectively). CC0 vs. CC1 
survival benefit at 1 and 3 years: RR 2.28 and 6.36 respectively, favoring CC0. 
1, 2, 3 and 5 years survival changes significantly above and below a PCI of 12.
CONCLUSIONS: 1, 2, 3 and 5-year overall survival is increased by CC0-CC1 
cytoreduction in patients with PC from gastric origin. Moreover CC0 increases 
the 1 and 3 years survival when compared to CC1 cytoreduction.

PURPOSE: Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) with a BRCA1-like profile may 
benefit from high dose alkylating chemotherapy (HDAC). This study examines 
whether BRCA1-like testing to target effective HDAC in TNBC patients can be more 
cost-effective than treating all patients with standard chemotherapy. 
Additionally, we estimated the minimum required prevalence of BRCA1-like and the 
required positive predictive value (PPV) for a BRCA1-like test to become 
cost-effective.
METHODS: Our Markov model compared 1) the incremental costs; 2) the incremental 
number of respondents; 3) the incremental number of Quality Adjusted Life Years 
(QALYs); and 4) the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of treating TNBC 
women with personalized HDAC based on BRCA1-like testing vs. standard 
chemotherapy, from a Dutch societal perspective and a 20-year time horizon, 
using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, we performed one-way 
sensitivity analysis (SA) to all model parameters, and two-way SA to prevalence 
and PPV. Data were obtained from a current trial (NCT01057069), published 
literature and expert opinions.
RESULTS: BRCA1-like testing to target effective HDAC would presently not be 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €80.000/QALY (€81.981/QALY). 
SAs show that PPV drives the ICER changes. Lower bounds for the prevalence and 
the PPV were found to be 58.5% and 73.0% respectively.
CONCLUSION: BRCA1-like testing to target effective HDAC treatment in TNBC 
patients is currently not cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of 
€80.000/QALY, but it can be when a minimum PPV of 73% is obtained in clinical 
practice. This information can help test developers and clinicians in decisions 
on further research and development of BRCA1-like tests.

Assessing the Long-Term Impact of Treating Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-Infected 
People Who Inject Drugs in the UK and the Relationship between Treatment Uptake 
and Efficacy on Future Infections.

OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains high amongst 
people who inject drugs (PWID) and accounts for the majority of newly acquired 
infections. This study aims to quantify the value of treatment amongst PWID with 
more efficacious treatments and at increased uptake rates, with respect to the 
avoidance of future infections and subsequent long-term complications of HCV.
METHODS: A dynamic HCV transmission and disease progression model was developed, 
incorporating acute and chronic infection and their long-term complications 
(decompensated cirrhosis, cancer, liver transplant and mortality), with the 
potential for HCV transmission to other PWID prior to successful treatment. The 
model was populated with prevalence and therapy data from a UK setting. 
Scenarios of current standard of care (SoC) treatment efficacy and uptake were 
compared to anticipated sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of 90-100% and 
increased uptake over varied horizons.
RESULTS: SoC led to modest reductions in prevalence; >5% after 200 years. New 
treatments achieving 90% SVR could reduce prevalence below 5% within 60 years at 
current uptake rates or within 5 years if all patients are treated. Amongst 
4,240 PWID, chronic HCV infections avoided as a result of increasing treatment 
uptake over the period 2015-2027 ranged from 20-580 and 34-912 with SoC and 90% 
SVR rates respectively. The reduction in downstream HCV infections due to 
increasing treatment uptake resulted in an approximate discounted gain of 300 
life-years (from avoiding reduced life expectancy from HCV infection) and a gain 
of 1,700 QALYs (from avoiding the disutility of HCV infection and related 
complications), with a projected £5.4 million cost saving.
CONCLUSION: While improved SVR profiles led to reductions in modelled 
prevalence, increased treatment uptake was the key driver of future infections 
avoided. Increased treatment among PWID with new more efficacious therapies 
could significantly change the future dynamics, cost and health burden of 
HCV-related disease.

Does Reproductive Investment Decrease Telomere Length in Menidia menidia?

Given finite resources, intense investment in one life history trait is expected 
to reduce investment in others. Although telomere length appears to be strongly 
tied to age in many taxa, telomere maintenance requires energy. We therefore 
hypothesize that telomere maintenance may trade off against other life history 
characters. We used natural variation in laboratory populations of Atlantic 
silversides (Menidia menidia) to study the relationship between growth, 
fecundity, life expectancy, and relative telomere length. In keeping with 
several other studies on fishes, we found no clear dependence of telomere length 
on age. However, we did find that more fecund fish tended to have both reduced 
life expectancy and shorter telomeres. This result is consistent with the 
hypothesis that there is a trade-off between telomere maintenance and 
reproductive output.

We examined whether dispositional optimism relates to change in global quality 
of life (QOL) as a function of either chronological age or years to impending 
death. We used a sample of 2,096 deceased postmenopausal women from the Women's 
Health Initiative clinical trials who were enrolled in the 2005-2010 Extension 
Study and for whom at least 1 global QOL and optimism measure were analyzed. 
Growth curve models were examined. Competing models were contrasted using model 
fit criteria. On average, levels of global QOL decreased with both higher age 
and closer proximity to death (e.g., M(score) = 7.7 eight years prior to death 
vs. M(score) = 6.1 one year prior to death). A decline in global QOL was better 
modeled as a function of distance to death (DtD) than as a function of
