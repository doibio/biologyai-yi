Extant interurban research in life expectancy greatly suffers from an 
underestimation of the role of place. Place is often conceptualized as a level 
of geography; this view ignores categorical differences between types of places. 
In addition, despite advances in theory and research that support their use, 
many important place-based factors remain under-utilized as control variables. 
We use multivariate analyses of life expectancy for the top and bottom quartiles 
of household income by sex in 148 US counties to compare the strengths of 
seventeen diverse variables. We find that cities' built, natural, and social 
environments play strong roles in life expectancy disparity among cities; many 
place-based variables consistently compare in strength to well-known control 
variables such as race, education, and behaviors. Furthermore, we find that 
place impacts men and women differently, even within the same income quartile. 
Indeed, some factors are associated with higher life expectancy in some 
demographic groups, and lower life expectancy in others. Researchers can protect 
against omitted variable bias when investigating public health outcomes by using 
a wider range of control variables. Researchers should also use better measures 
of place, and consider selecting specific cases to study.

OBJECTIVE: Surgery for low-grade gliomas (LGGs) aims to achieve maximal tumor 
removal and maintenance of patients' functional integrity. Because extent of 
resection is one of the factors affecting the natural history of LGGs, surgery 
could be extended further than total resection toward a supratotal resection, 
beyond tumor borders detectable on FLAIR imaging. Supratotal resection is highly 
debated, mainly due to a lack of evidence of its feasibility and safety. The 
authors explored the intraoperative feasibility of supratotal resection and its 
short- and long-term impact on functional integrity in a large cohort of 
patients. The role of some putative factors in the achievement of supratotal 
resection was also studied.
METHODS: Four hundred forty-nine patients with a presumptive radiological 
diagnosis of LGG consecutively admitted to the neurosurgical oncology service at 
the University of Milan over a 5-year period were enrolled. In all patients, a 
policy was adopted to perform surgery according to functional boundaries, aimed 
at achieving a supratotal resection whenever possible, without any patient or 
tumor a priori selection. Feasibility, general safety, and tumor or patient 
putative factors possibly affecting the achievement of a supratotal resection 
were analyzed. Postsurgical patient functional performance was evaluated in five 
cognitive domains (memory, language, praxis, executive functions, and fluid 
intelligence) using a detailed neuropsychological evaluation and quality of life 
(QOL) examination.
RESULTS: Total resection was feasible in 40.8% of patients, and supratotal 
resection in 32.3%. The achievement of a supratotal versus total resection was 
independent of age, sex, education, tumor volume, deep extension, location, 
handedness, appearance of tumor border, vicinity to eloquent sites, surgical 
mapping time, or surgical tools applied. Supratotal resection was associated 
with a long clinical history and histological grade II, suggesting that 
reshaping of brain networks occurred. Although a consistent amount of apparently 
MRI-normal brain was removed with this approach, the procedure was safe and did 
not carry additional risk to the patient, as demonstrated by detailed 
neuropsychological evaluation and QOL examination. This approach also improved 
seizure control.
CONCLUSIONS: Supratotal resection is feasible and safe in routine clinical 
practice. These results show that a long clinical history may be the main factor 
associated with its achievement.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: After a kidney transplantation, all efforts are 
focused on graft function. However, cardiovascular and neurologic complications 
might lead to decreased quality of life and shortened life expectancy. Early 
recognition of related symptoms might be critical to successfully manage these 
complications.
METHODS AND PATIENTS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 
patients who had undergone kidney transplantation in a tertiary center between 
January 2014 and December 2017. Demographic data and past medical history were 
systematically gathered. Symptoms related to cardiac or neurologic disorders and 
final diagnoses were recorded.
RESULTS: One hundred eighty-six patients were evaluated by a cardiologist or a 
neurologist in the early post-operative period or long-term follow-up. Chest 
pain (n = 17; 9.1%) and palpitations (n = 13; 7.0%) were the most prevalent 
symptoms. Coronary artery disease was diagnosed in 70.6% (n = 12) of the 
patients presenting with chest pain. All of the patients were treated 
successfully, with either antianginal drugs or percutaneous angioplasty. Atrial 
fibrillation was diagnosed in 53.9% (n = 7) of the patients presenting with 
palpitations. Headache was the most prevalent chronic neurologic symptom (n = 
16; 8.6%). Transient ischemic attack occured in 7 patients (3.8%) and 5 (2.7%) 
patients experienced ischemic stroke.
CONCLUSION: Kidney transplantation is associated with short- and long-term 
cardiac and neurologic complications. Our findings underscore the crucial role 
of questioning symptoms that might be related to severe disorders. Asymptomatic 
patients with high risk factors must also be under scope. Attending physicians 
should have a low threshold for referring these patients to cardiologists and 
neurologists.

Cutaneous melanoma (CM) causes more deaths than any other skin tumor, and 
incidence and mortality rates have risen in recent years, especially in patients 
of advanced age. There are differences in the biological behavior of CM tumors 
in the elderly as well as differential management of the disease, evidently 
influenced by such factors as limited life expectancy, the high incidence of 
concomitant conditions in older patients, and issues of quality of life 
unrelated to CM itself. We review relevant current literature on the 
epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, and immunology of CM as well as research 
on the clinical features, prevention, and management of these tumors in the 
elderly.

PURPOSE: Sacubitril/valsartan, the first-in-class angiotensin receptor 
neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), is a possible treatment option for chronic heart 
failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The aim of this study 
was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan use in South 
Korea for treating patients with HFrEF compared with that of enalapril, an 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and with angiotensin receptor blockers 
(ARBs).
METHODS: A Markov model was designed to estimate the lifetime cost-effectiveness 
of treatment for patients with HFrEF. Cohorts in the alive-state incurred a 
monthly risk of hospitalization because of deteriorated HF, adverse events 
(AEs), or death. Transition probabilities of sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril 
were estimated by using data from the PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of 
ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart 
Failure) trial. The effectiveness of ARBs (eg, reduction in mortality and 
hospitalization rates) was assumed to be identical to that of enalapril, 
according to the results of the meta-analysis. However, there was no comparative 
evidence for AEs. We therefore conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis and 
adjusted the incidence rate of AEs for ARBs. The utility for estimating 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was elicited by the survey of the general 
South Korean population by using EuroQol-5 dimensions. We calculated the medical 
costs, including medication, monitoring, hospitalization, AEs, and terminal 
care, from the health care sector perspective. Costs and effectiveness were 
discounted by 5%. One-way sensitivity analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis were conducted to determine the model robustness.
FINDINGS: The total cost per patient for sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril was 
$25,832 and $18,295, respectively. Sacubitril/valsartan was associated with an 
∼8- month longer life expectancy compared with enalapril and a QALY gain of 
0.59. As a result, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 
sacubitril/valsartan versus enalapril was $12,722 per QALY. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of sacubitril/valsartan versus ARB was $11,970 with an 
incurred cost of $18,741 for the ARB group. The main results and those of 
various sensitivity analyses were lower than a threshold of $20,000.
IMPLICATIONS: From a health care sector perspective, sacubitril/valsartan is a 
cost-effective treatment for HFrEF compared with enalapril and ARBs. This 
finding could be helpful for cardiologists or decision makers in reaching 
cost-effective choices regarding the treatment selection process.

BACKGROUND: German post-mortem organ donation rates have been declining since 
2010. Several transplantation scandals led to a negative portrayal of organ 
donation in the media. Spain, the UK and the Netherlands achieved a rise in 
organ donation rates while retaining organ donation legislation.
METHODS: A systematic review of publications focusing on (1) organ donation 
legislation, (2) data on post-mortem organ donation rates and (3) measures to 
increase post-mortem organ donation rates in Europe was conducted in November 
2017 in PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Quality parameters of the World 
Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO) were studied to analyze national 
health services, frequent causes of death and life expectancy.
RESULTS: Quality parameters of national health services were similar in all 
countries. The Netherlands and Germany have an opt in system. An increase of 
37.4% in post-mortem organ donation rates from 2008 to 2015 in the UK was 
accomplished through the establishment of a donation task force, adopting parts 
of the Spanish model, while maintaining an opt in system. Spain has the highest 
organ donation rate worldwide (39.7 per million persons in 2015). The 
implementation of transplantation coordinators and the change in legislation in 
Germany in 2012 has so far shown no effect. Public awareness of organ donation 
in the Netherlands increased following various information campaigns.
CONCLUSION: Donation after cardiac death (DCD), expanded donor criteria, 
increasing public awareness and introduction of an organ donor register should 
be discussed as measures to increase organ donation rates in Germany.

AIMS: The benefit an individual can expect from preventive therapy varies based 
on risk-factor burden, competing risks, and treatment duration. We developed and 
validated the LIFEtime-perspective CardioVascular Disease (LIFE-CVD) model for 
the estimation of individual-level 10 years and lifetime treatment-effects of 
cholesterol lowering, blood pressure lowering, antithrombotic therapy, and 
smoking cessation in apparently healthy people.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Model development was conducted in the Multi-Ethnic Study 
of Atherosclerosis (n = 6715) using clinical predictors. The model consists of 
two complementary Fine and Gray competing-risk adjusted left-truncated 
subdistribution hazard functions: one for hard cardiovascular disease 
(CVD)-events, and one for non-CVD mortality. Therapy-effects were estimated by 
combining the functions with hazard ratios from preventive therapy trials. 
External validation was performed in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities 
(n = 9250), Heinz Nixdorf Recall (n = 4177), and the European Prospective 
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Netherlands (n = 25 833), and Norfolk 
(n = 23 548) studies. Calibration of the LIFE-CVD model was good and 
c-statistics were 0.67-0.76. The output enables the comparison of short-term vs. 
long-term therapy-benefit. In two people aged 45 and 70 with otherwise identical 
risk-factors, the older patient has a greater 10-year absolute risk reduction 
(11.3% vs. 1.0%) but a smaller gain in life-years free of CVD (3.4 vs. 
4.5 years) from the same therapy. The model was developed into an interactive 
online calculator available via www.U-Prevent.com.
CONCLUSION: The model can accurately estimate individual-level prognosis and 
treatment-effects in terms of improved 10-year risk, lifetime risk, and 
life-expectancy free of CVD. The model is easily accessible and can be used to 
facilitate personalized-medicine and doctor-patient communication.

OBJECTIVES: Provide normative values for cervical range of motion and describe 
trends in school age rugby union players.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: National 3 level club.
PARTICIPANTS: 59 school age rugby union players across under 8 (n = 8), under 9 
(n = 9), under 10 (n = 15), under 13 (n = 13) and under 15 (n = 15) categories.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cervical range of motion using a cervical range of motion 
device (CROM) to determine values for active range of motion.
RESULTS: This study established mean ranges of motion for each age group. Pooled 
mean ranges with standard deviations for each direction were, flexion 66° (±11), 
extension 73° (±17), left rotation 69° (±9), right rotation 74° (±10), left 
lateral flexion 53° (±10) and right lateral flexion 49° (±12). No statistically 
significant differences were observed between the age groups, however, downward 
trends in lateral flexion were observed as age increased. School age rugby 
players had greater range of motion than senior playing counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant differences in ranges of motion were 
observed between the age groups of under 8 through to under 15. However, 
downward trends in some ranges of motion highlight the need for age specific 
monitoring for potential adaptations to continued playing and comparison to age 
matched non-rugby players. Inclusion of other risk factors such as head 
re-positioning sense should also be evaluated to help guide injury risk 
reduction strategies.

Regulatory sequences or erroneous incorporations during DNA transcription cause 
RNA polymerase backtracking and inactivation in all kingdoms of 
life. Reactivation requires RNA transcript cleavage. Essential transcription 
factors (GreA and GreB, or TFIIS) accelerate this reaction. We report four 
cryo-EM reconstructions of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase representing the 
entire reaction pathway: (1) a backtracked complex; a backtracked complex with 
GreB (2) before and (3) after RNA cleavage; and (4) a reactivated, 
substrate-bound complex with GreB before RNA extension. Compared with 
eukaryotes, the backtracked RNA adopts a different conformation. RNA polymerase 
conformational changes cause distinct GreB states: a fully engaged GreB before 
cleavage; a disengaged GreB after cleavage; and a dislodged, loosely bound GreB 
removed from the active site to allow RNA extension. These reconstructions 
provide insight into the catalytic mechanism and dynamics of RNA cleavage and 
extension and suggest how GreB targets backtracked complexes without interfering 
with canonical transcription.

BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is associated with shortened life 
expectancy in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The 
contribution of pulmonary vascular dysfunction to RV dysfunction in HFpEF is not 
well understood.
METHODS: We investigated rest and exercise invasive pulmonary hemodynamics, 
ventilation, and gas exchange in 67 patients with HFpEF (of whom 28 had an 
abnormal pulmonary vascular response during exercise referred to as HFpEF+PVR 
group and 39 had a normal pulmonary vascular response during exercise referred 
to as HFpEF group) and in 21 matched control subjects.
RESULTS: Both groups of patients with HFpEF had a markedly decreased peak oxygen 
consumption (Vo2), decreased oxygen delivery, and impaired chronotropic 
response. Single beat analysis of RV pressure waveforms was used to compute the 
end-systolic elastance (Ees) and pulmonary arterial elastance (Ea). Right 
ventricular-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) coupling was measured as the ratio of 
Ees/Ea. Exercise was associated with a preserved Ees response but a decreased 
Ees/Ea in patients with HFpEF with a normal PVR response, indicating partially 
preserved RV contractile reserve. In HFpEF+PVR, exercise-induced increase in Ees 
was markedly reduced, resulting in decreased Ees/Ea and RV-PA uncoupling. 
Patients with HFpEF+PVR with an exercise-induced decrease in Ees/Ea had lower 
pulmonary artery compliance, lower peak Vo2, and lower stroke volume than 
patients with HFpEF.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that RV-PA uncoupling is common in HFpEF and is caused 
by both intrinsic RV contractile impairment and afterload mismatch. Resting and 
dynamic RV-PA uncoupling in HFpEF is driven by an increase in RV pulsatile 
rather than resistive afterload. However, with the additive effects of increased 
RV resistive afterload, RV-PA uncoupling worsens dynamically during exercise.

OBJECTIVE: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory 
disease. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of secukinumab, an 
interleukin-17A inhibitor, versus other biologics in PsA from the Argentinean 
social security perspective.
METHODS: A semi-Markov model evaluated subcutaneous (sc) treatment with 
secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg against other sc treatments such as adalimumab, 
certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, ustekinumab, and intravenous 
treatment infliximab in biologic-naïve (with or without moderate to severe 
psoriasis) and biologic-experienced PsA patients over a lifetime horizon. 
Response to treatments was determined using the PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) at 
12 weeks. Model inputs were derived from randomized controlled trials, network 
meta-analyses, published literature, and other Argentinean sources. Model 
outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios. Sensitivity analyses and alternative scenarios with a 
higher cost option were also conducted.
RESULTS: Among biologic-naïve PsA patients without psoriasis, secukinumab 150 mg 
provided the highest QALYs (7.18) versus all sc biologics at the lowest cost 
($3 755 678 Argentine peso), thus dominating them. Among biologic-naïve PsA 
patients with psoriasis and biologic-experienced PsA patients, secukinumab 300 
mg provided highest QALYs (6.99 and 7.53, respectively), dominated infliximab, 
and was cost-effective versus other sc biologics. Deterministic sensitivity 
analyses indicated sensitivity of results to variation in PsARC rates, drug 
acquisition costs, Health Assessment Questionnaire change, and utilities. A 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed maximum net monetary benefits with 
both secukinumab doses. Results from an alternative scenario analysis were 
similar to base-case analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: For both biologic-naïve and experienced PsA patients, secukinumab 
is either a dominant or cost-effective treatment option compared with other 
biologics in Argentina.

Rivers, as the most prominent component of water resources, have a key role to 
play in increasing the life expectancy of living creatures. The essential 
characteristics of water pollutants can be described by water quality indices 
(WQIs). Hence, a ferocious demand for obtaining an accurate prediction of WQIs 
is of high importance for perception of pollutant patterns in natural streams. 
Field studies conducted on different rivers indicated that there is no general 
relationship to yield water quality parameters with a permissible level of 
accuracy. Over the past decades, several artificial intelligence (AI) models 
have been employed to predict more precise estimation of WQIs rather than 
conventional models. In this way, through the current study, multivariate 
adaptive regression spline (MARS) and least square-support vector machine 
(LS-SVM), as machine learning methods, were used to predict indices of the 
five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). To 
improve the proposed approaches, 200 series of field data, collected from Karoun 
River southwest of Iran, pertain to the nine independent input parameters, 
namely electrical conductivity (EC), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium 
(Mg2+), orthophosphate ([Formula: see text]), nitrite ([Formula: see text]), 
nitrate nitrogen ([Formula: see text]), turbidity, and pH. The performances of 
the LS-SVM and MARS techniques were quantified in both training and testing 
stages by means of several statistical parameters. Furthermore, the results of 
the proposed AI models were compared with those obtained using artificial neural 
network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and multiple 
regression equations. Results of the present research work indicated that the 
proposed artificial intelligence techniques, as machine learning classifiers, 
were found to be efficient in order to predict water quality parameters.

Adjuvant trastuzumab chemotherapy in early breast cancer: meta-analysis of 
randomised trials and cost-effectiveness analysis.

Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has a large financial impact on the average cost of 
breast cancer treatment. This study reassessed the cost-effectiveness of listing 
the drug on the subsidised Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
METHODS: Using a continuous-time, discrete-event microsimulation model, we 
examined the effect of 1-year trastuzumab on the total number of 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted among Australian women with human 
epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) positive early breast cancer. Target 
population was women aged 30&ndash;100 years and newly diagnosed with the 
disease in 2003. The model adjusted for tumour size and followed the women up 
until death or age 100 years. Uncertainty was examined in univariate and 
probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was A$132,537 (95% 
confidence interval 91,172&ndash;200,485) per DALY averted. Results were 
sensitive to restriction of trastuzumab to high-risk (large tumour) and/or 
high-benefit (young) patients. Suitable combinations of tumour size and age 
restrictions would improve the cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab. Specifically, 
restricting trastuzumab to women aged 40 years or younger with tumour sizes 40+ 
mm reduced the ICER to A$35,290 per DALY averted.
CONCLUSION: Trastuzumab for HER2-positive early breast cancer had a high ICER. 
It is unclear why the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listing does not use 
restrictions to improve the cost-effectiveness of the drug.

Valuing Health: Evolution, Revolution, Resistance, and Reform.

A number of methods have sought to determine the value of interventions and 
services that promote health, even when no agreement exists on the proper way to 
determine and define "value." Previous valuation efforts began simply by 
counting deaths or measuring life expectancy, slowly evolving to the widespread 
use of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) as the de facto normative standard for 
medical interventions. Users of CEA recognize that the method is incomplete. 
Further, no meaningful agreement exists on how best to apply CEA in decision 
settings because of either inadequacies in the CEA framework or lack of 
consensus on how to use it in a setting with budget constraints. Yet efforts to 
value health still predominantly use (and continue to recommend) this limited 
framework. Is this owing to a lack of new ideas and motivation, resistance to 
change, or an aversion to embrace more comprehensive systems approaches? We 
argue that tools of systems engineering can advance our capabilities, but they 
have had only limited use in health policy. We identify some reasons and 
specifically highlight the promise of systems-analytic platforms-such as 
multicriteria decision support systems-and the need to make them more accessible 
for different uses in real situations with real consequences. We also explore 
the need for comparative testing of different multicriteria approaches 
(including direct comparisons with CEA) to learn when and by how much the 
recommendations differ and what the consequences might be.

Combining Health and Outcomes Beyond Health in Complex Evaluations of Complex 
Interventions: Suggestions for Economic Evaluation.

In this journal there has been considerable discussion regarding the development 
of tools for valuing the multiple attributes that arise from complex 
interventions with benefits beyond health. Nevertheless, unlike the rigorous 
underpinnings of cost-utility analysis, much of this work has been taking place 
in fragmented research communities and without theoretical underpinnings, 
leading to a call for better and more comprehensive frameworks. We discuss the 
challenges faced by economic evaluation using as our example a "social 
prescribing" intervention, a novel health intervention based on the social model 
of health. We suggest a mixed-methods approach to uncover important attributes 
and then combine tools from health economics and economics to provide measures 
of benefit in a common money numeraire. This approach provides the theoretical 
underpinnings necessary for deliberate, transparent, and structured 
decision-making processes. It also enables the correct allocation of costs 
within complex payment systems. We suggest that, because of the complexities of 
randomized controlled trials, interventions should be introduced in a way that 
allows the application of causal analysis for evaluation. In the short term, 
such evaluations may be challenging and expensive. Nevertheless, as has happened 
with health economics evaluation and the quality-adjusted life-year, when a 
common set of attributes is agreed upon, the expense will fall and these methods 
can become embedded in interventions with diffuse outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Health inequalities can be partially addressed through the range of 
treatments funded by health systems. Nevertheless, although health technology 
assessment agencies assess the overall balance of health benefits and costs, no 
quantitative assessment of health inequality impact is consistently undertaken.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the inequality impact of technologies recommended under 
the NICE single technology appraisal process from 2012 to 2014 using an 
aggregate distributional cost-effectiveness framework.
METHODS: Data on health benefits, costs, and patient populations were extracted 
from the NICE website. Benefits for each technology were distributed to social 
groups using the observed socioeconomic distribution of hospital utilization for 
the targeted disease. Inequality measures and estimates of cost-effectiveness 
were compared using the health inequality impact plane and combined using social 
welfare indices.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven interventions were evaluated. Fourteen interventions were 
estimated to increase population health and reduce health inequality, 8 to 
reduce population health and increase health inequality, and 5 to increase 
health and increase health inequality. Among the latter 5, social welfare 
analysis, using inequality aversion parameters reflecting high concern for 
inequality, indicated that the health gain outweighs the negative health 
inequality impact.
CONCLUSIONS: The methods proposed offer a way of estimating the health 
inequality impacts of new health technologies. The methods do not allow for 
differences in technology-specific utilization and health benefits, but require 
less resources and data than conducting full distributional cost-effectiveness 
analysis. They can provide useful quantitative information to help policy makers 
consider how far new technologies are likely to reduce or increase health 
inequalities.

The "Reference Case" was developed to facilitate comparability among published 
cost-effectiveness analyses intended to contribute to decisions about the broad 
allocation of healthcare resources. Although the societal perspective is 
recommended for Reference Case analyses, empirical estimations rarely adequately 
represent the patient perspective, and more often, healthcare system or payer 
perspectives are used. In this commentary, we discuss the evolution of the 
Reference Case over the past 20 years and how it now needs to further evolve. 
This should begin with a patient-informed societal perspective. A realignment of 
the societal perspective to better include patient perspectives in CEA creates a 
conduit for patient inclusion. Engaging patients to both derive patient-informed 
value elements and prioritize value elements using stated preference methods 
will lead to patient inclusion in the societal perspective and a 
patient-informed Reference Case analysis.

Multivariable and Structural Uncertainty Analyses for Cost-Effectiveness 
Estimates: Back to the Future.

Mauskopf J(1).

Author information:
(1)RTI Health Solutions, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA. Electronic address: 
jmauskopf@rti.org.

BACKGROUND: In this commentary, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the journal 
Value in Health, I present a brief overview and illustration of the evolution 
over the past 20 years of the methodological literature providing guidelines for 
multivariable and structural uncertainty analysis for cost-effectiveness 
estimates.
METHODS: To illustrate the impact of the guidelines for uncertainty analyses, I 
show how the inclusion of multivariable and structural uncertainty analyses in 
cost-effectiveness analyses published in Value in Health changed over the past 
20 years using publications from 1999/2000, 2007 and 2017.
RESULTS: The commentary is organized in three sections: past, focusing on the 
development and use of methods for multivariable uncertainty analysis; present, 
focusing on the growing awareness of the need for structural uncertainty 
analysis, suggested frameworks for structural uncertainty analysis and how it is 
currently implemented; and future, considering different methods for combining 
multivariable and structural uncertainty analyses over the next decades.
CONCLUSIONS: I conclude by suggesting how the continued evolution of uncertainty 
analyses in published studies and health technology assessment submissions can 
best take into account an important goal of cost-effectiveness analyses: to 
provide useful information to decision makers.

PURPOSE: As a second-line endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive and 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) metastatic breast 
cancer, palbociclib has demonstrated significant efficacy in prolonging 
progression-free survival when added to a regimen containing fulvestrant. The 
objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of palbociclib 
from the perspectives of the United States and China.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate lifetime costs, overall 
life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed to predict the uncertainty of the model developed. The 
time horizon was 10 years, and the perspective was that of the payer.
FINDINGS: Within a 10-year time horizon, the palbociclib-containing strategy 
provided an additional 0.568 QALY, with an ICER of 88,854 USD/QALY, in the 
United States. When palbociclib cost 30%, 20%, and 10% of the current price, the 
ICERs were 185,526, 42,193, and 98,860 USD/QALY, respectively. In China, the 
ICER was 182,779 USD/QALY. When palbociclib cost 30%, 20%, and 10% of the 
current price, the ICERs were 79,558, 64,812, and 50,066 USD/QALY, respectively. 
In order to meet 50% probability of cost-effectiveness, the estimated price 
would have to be 32.52 USD/100 mg at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 58,480 
USD/QALY (3 × per-capita domestic product of Beijing, China).
IMPLICATIONS: Adding palbociclib to a regimen of fulvestrant is unlikely to be 
cost-effective as a second-line endocrine therapy for HR+/HER2- metastatic 
breast cancer (MBC) with at the current price in the United States and China. 
For widely meeting the treatment demands of patients, it may be a better option 
to decrease the price or provide more patients with a financial assistance 
program for palbociclib both in the United States and in China.

BACKGROUND: Currently, the decision to resurface the patella is often made 
irrespective of the presence of patellar arthritis. The purpose of this study is 
to utilize the existing literature to assess cost-utility of routinely vs 
selectively resurfacing the patella.
METHODS: Prospective randomized studies of patella resurfacing vs 
non-resurfacing in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were identified through 
literature review. Data from these studies represented probabilities of varied 
outcomes following TKA dependent upon patella resurfacing. Using previously 
validated utility scores from the McKnee modified Health Utilities Index, 
endpoint utility values were provided for each potential outcome.
RESULTS: Literature review yielded a total of 14 studies with 3,562 patients 
receiving 3,823 TKAs, of which 1,873 (49.0%) patellae were resurfaced. 
Persistent postoperative anterior knee pain occurred in 20.9% vs 13.2% (P < 
.001) and patella reoperation was performed in 3.7% vs 1.6% (P < .001) of 
unresurfaced and resurfaced patella, respectively. In studies excluding those 
with arthritic patellae, the incidence of anterior knee pain was equivalent 
between groups and reoperation decreased to 1.2% vs 0% (P = .06). Patella 
resurfacing provided marginally improved quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) for 
both selective and indiscriminate patella resurfacing. When including all 
studies, the incremental cost per QALY was $3,032. However, when analyzing only 
those studies with nonarthritic patellae, the incremental cost per QALY to 
resurface the patella increased to $183,584.
CONCLUSION: Patellar resurfacing remains a controversial issue in TKA. Utilizing 
data from new prospective randomized studies, this analysis finds that routinely 
resurfacing arthritis-free patellae in TKA are not cost-effective.

The role of tumor suppressor p53 in metabolism and energy regulation, and its 
implication in cancer and lifestyle-related diseases.

Medicine, Chiba, Japan.

The tumor suppressor gene p53 is mutated in approximately more than 50% of human 
cancers. p53 is also referred to as the "cellular gatekeeper" or "guardian of 
the genome" because it protects the body from spreading mutated genome induced 
by various stress. When the cells receives stimuli such as DNA damage, oncogene 
activation, oxidative stress or undernutrition, p53 gives rise to a number of 
cellular responses, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, cellular senescence 
and metabolic adaptation. Related to energy metabolisms, it has been reported 
that p53 reduces glycolysis and enhances mitochondrial respiration. p53 is also 
involved in the regulation of other cellular metabolism and energy production 
systems: amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism,
