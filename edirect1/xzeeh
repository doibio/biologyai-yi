posttest (feasibility markers, t-tests).
RESULTS: Enrolled participants (N = 28; 80% of those eligible) completed 
baseline (N = 28; 100% of sample) and posttests (N = 25; 89.3%). Video lesson 
(58.0%) and homework (70.9%) completion were fair to good. Satisfaction (M = 
8.85/10; SD = 2.35), credibility (M = 7.07/10; SD = 1.44), and expectancy (M = 
6.68/10; SD = 2.10) were good to excellent. Participation was associated with 
statistically significant pre-to-post positive changes in quality of life (QoL; 
Physical, Psychological, Social, and Environmental,; p < 0.05) and emotional 
distress (depression, anxiety, and stress; p < 0.05). Pain intensity and 
interference did not improve significantly (p > 0.05) after participation.
CONCLUSIONS: NF-Web demonstrates initial feasibility, acceptability, and signals 
of improvement. Results support future trials to ascertain efficacy.
INNOVATION: Web-based programs may be valuable for individuals with rare illness 
who prefer to learn skills on their own timeline, have barriers to live video 
participation, and who also have apprehensions about interacting with others 
during treatment.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the standard of care 
in symptomatic older patients with severe aortic stenosis regardless of surgical 
risk. With the development of newer generation transcatheter bioprostheses, 
improved delivery systems, better preprocedure planning with imaging guidance, 
increased operator experience, shorter hospital length of stay, and low short- 
and mid-term complication rates, TAVI is gaining popularity among younger 
patients at low or intermediate surgical risk. Long-term outcomes and durability 
of transcatheter heart valves have become substantially important for this 
younger population due to their longer life expectancy. The lack of standardized 
definitions of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction and disagreement about how to 
account for the competing risks made comparison of transcatheter heart valves 
with surgical bioprostheses challenging until recently. In this review, the 
authors discuss the mid- to long-term (≥ 5 years) clinical outcomes observed in 
the landmark TAVI trials and analyze the available long-term durability data 
emphasizing the importance of using standardized definitions of bioprosthetic 
valve dysfunction.

Managing acute innominate artery (IA) dissection associated with severe stenosis 
is challenging due to its rarity, possible complex dissection patterns, and 
compromised blood flow to the brain and upper extremities. This report describes 
our treatment strategy for this challenging disease using the kissing stent 
technique. A 61-year-old man had worsening of an acute IA dissection secondary 
to an extension of a treated aortic dissection. Four possible treatment 
strategies for kissing stent placement were proposed based on different 
approaches (open surgical or endovascular) and accesses (trans-femoral, 
trans-brachial, or trans-carotid access). We chose to place two stents 
simultaneously via a percutaneous retrograde endovascular approach through the 
right brachial artery and a combined open surgical distal clamping of the common 
carotid artery with a retrograde endovascular approach through the carotid 
artery. This hybrid approach strategy highlights the three key points for 
maintaining safety and efficacy: (1) good guiding catheter support is obtainable 
through retrograde, rather than antegrade, access to the lesion, (2) concomitant 
cerebral and upper extremity reperfusion is guaranteed by placing kissing stents 
into the IA, and (3) peri-procedural cerebral emboli are prevented by surgical 
exposure of the common carotid artery with distal clamping.

23311, Saudi Arabia.

Synchronous bilateral breast cancer is a rare clinical entity. And due to both 
an improved prognosis and growing life expectancy on early detection, we have 
brought interest in case of patient with synchronous breast cancer. This study 
reports a case of synchronous bilateral breast cancer in an asymptomatic 
70-year-old woman with a positive family history of breast cancer. This woman 
was diagnosed through radiological screenings, including mammograms, 
ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On histopathologic 
examination of the core biopsy, the left breast mass was a Nottingham grade I 
invasive carcinoma of no particular type. The right breast mass was a Nottingham 
grade I invasive carcinoma with a mucinous component. After lumpectomies 
ultrasonography of the surgical specimens confirmed a small biopsy-proven 
invasive ductal cancer hypoechoic mass in the left breast, with an irregular 
margins and proven mucinous cancer mass in the right breast. The case was 
finally diagnosed as synchronous bilateral breast cancer of different pathologic 
types (ductal and mucinous).

INTRODUCTION: The fifth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) 
classification of central nervous system (CNS) tumors released in 2021 formally 
defines pediatric-type diffuse gliomas. However, there is still little 
understanding of pediatric-type diffuse gliomas, and even less attention has 
been paid to adult patients. Therefore, this study describes the clinical 
radiological, survival, and molecular features of adult patients with 
pediatric-type glioma.
METHODS: Adult patients who underwent surgery from January 2011 to January 2022, 
classified as pediatric-type glioma, were included in this study. Clinical, 
radiological, histopathological, molecular pathological, and survival data were 
collected for analysis.
RESULTS: Among 596 adult patients, 20 patients with pediatric-type glioma were 
screened, including 6 with diffuse astrocytoma, MYB- or MYBL1-altered, 2 with 
diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered, and 12 with diffuse pediatric-type 
high-grade glioma, H3-wildtype and IDH-wildtype. Pediatric high-grade glioma 
(pHGG) frequently showed tumor enhancement, peritumoral edema, and intratumoral 
necrosis. Adult patients with pHGG showed a longer life expectancy than adult 
patients with glioblastoma. Common molecular alterations included chromosome 
alterations and CDKN2A/B, PIK3CA, and PTEN, while altered KMT5B and MET were 
found to affect the overall survival.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated adult patients with pediatric-type glioma. 
Notably, our research aims to expand the current understanding of adult patients 
with pediatric-type diffuse gliomas. Furthermore, personalized therapies 
consisting of targeted molecular inhibitors for MET and VEGFA may exhibit 
beneficial effects in the corresponding population.

BACKGROUND: Loss of life expectancy (LOLE) may provide more intuitive 
information on the impact of cancer than relative survival over a fixed time 
horizon (e.g., 5-year relative survival). We aimed to assess the evolution of 
the LOLE using a nationwide, population-based cohort including patients 
diagnosed with one of 17 most frequent solid malignancies.
METHODS: From the Netherlands Cancer Registry, we selected adult patients 
diagnosed with one of the 17 most frequent solid malignancies in the Netherlands 
during 1989-2019, with survival follow-up until 2022. We used flexible 
parametric survival models to estimate the LOLE at diagnosis and the LOLE after 
surviving several years post-diagnosis (conditional LOLE; CLOLE) by cancer type, 
calendar year, age, sex, and disease stage.
FINDINGS: For all cancers combined, the LOLE consistently decreased from 1989 to 
2019. This decrease was most pronounced for males with prostate cancer (e.g., 
from 6.9 [95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7-7.1] to 2.7 [95% CI, 2.5-3.0] for 
65-year-olds) and females with breast cancer (e.g., from 6.6 [95% CI, 6.4-6.7] 
to 1.9 [95% CI, 1.8-2.0] for 65-year-olds). The LOLE among patients with cancers 
of the head and neck or the central nervous system remained constant over time. 
Overall, the CLOLE showed that the life years lost among patients with cancer 
decreased with each additional year survived post-diagnosis. For example, the 
LOLE at diagnosis for 65-year-old females diagnosed with breast cancer in 2019 
was 1.9 [95% CI, 1.8-2.0] compared with 1.7 [95% CI, 1.6-1.8], 1.0 [95% CI, 
0.9-1.1], and 0.5 [95% CI, 0.5-0.6] when surviving one, five, and ten years 
post-diagnosis, respectively. Estimates for other combinations of patient and 
tumour characteristics are available in a publicly available web-based 
application.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggested that the evolution of LOLE substantially 
varies across cancer type, age, and disease stage. LOLE estimates help patients 
better understand the impact of their specific cancer diagnosis on their life 
expectancy.

Telomere maintenance requires extension of the G-rich telomeric repeat strand by 
telomerase and fill-in synthesis of the C-rich strand by Polα/Primase. Telomeric 
Polα/Primase is bound to Ctc1-Stn1-Ten1 (CST), a single-stranded DNA-binding 
complex. Like mutations in telomerase, mutations affecting CST-Polα/Primase 
result in pathological telomere shortening and cause a telomere biology 
disorder, Coats plus (CP). We determined cryogenic electron microscopy 
structures of human CST bound to the shelterin heterodimer POT1/TPP1 that reveal 
how CST is recruited to telomeres by POT1. Phosphorylation of POT1 is required 
for CST recruitment, and the complex is formed through conserved interactions 
involving several residues mutated in CP. Our structural and biochemical data 
suggest that phosphorylated POT1 holds CST-Polα/Primase in an inactive 
auto-inhibited state until telomerase has extended the telomere ends. We propose 
that dephosphorylation of POT1 releases CST-Polα/Primase into an active state 
that completes telomere replication through fill-in synthesis.

We report systematic variability in the psychometric properties of a brief 
personality inventory during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing 
upon recent discussions about the universality vs cultural relativism of 
personality measures, we review and comparatively test theories predicting 
systematic variability in personality measurement across cultures using an 
established brief personality measure applied to population samples in 16 
nations during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 35,052). We found 
systematic variation in factor replicability and effective dimensionality. In 
line with previous theorizing, factors replicated better in contexts with 
greater niche diversity. Examining possible drivers underlying this association, 
the investigation of the individual components in the niche construction index 
suggested that life expectancy and to a lesser degree economic complexity are 
associated with greater personality structure differentiation. Population-level 
indicators of acute threat due to COVID-19 did not show credible effects. These 
patterns suggest that a) investigation of personality structure in population 
samples can provide useful insights into personality dynamics, b) 
socioecological factors have a systematic impact on survey responses, but c) we 
also need better theorizing and research about both personality and culture to 
understand how niche construction dynamics operate.

China.

Background: Radical prostatectomy is the preferred therapeutic option for 
patients with localized prostate adenocarcinoma whose life expectancy is greater 
than 10 years. But for elderly patients, this may not be the best option. In 
clinical work, we have observed that palliative transurethral resection of 
prostate (pTURP) combined with intermittent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) 
has achieved significant good results in the treatment of elderly patients with 
localized prostate adenocarcinoma. Methods: Retrospective analysis was conducted 
on 30 elderly patients aged 71 to 88 years who were hospitalized for urinary 
retention from March 2009 to March 2015. These patients were diagnosed as 
localized prostate adenocarcinoma with stage T1 to T2 and benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH) through MRI and prostate biopsy. Fifteen cases (group A) were 
given pTURP and intermittent ADT after surgery. Fifteen cases (group B) were 
given sustained ADT. Serum total prostate specific antigen (TPSA), testosterone, 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), prostate acid phosphatase (PAP), International 
Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Quality of Life (QOL) score, maximum urinary flow 
rate (Qmax), average urinary flow rate (Qave), prostate volume and post-void 
residual urine (PVR) data were followed up for 5 years, and the differences 
between the two groups were compared. Results: The 5-year cumulative survival 
rate of group A was 100%. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression-free 
survival was 60.00%. The average duration of intermittent ADT was 23.93 months. 
Prostate volume reduction was significantly. The dysuria in all patients was 
significantly improved. Nine patients had TPSA lower than 4 ng/ml and had no 
local progression and metastasis. At the same time the 5-year cumulative 
survival rate of group B was 80%. PSA progression-free survival was 26.67%. Six 
cases of dysuria improved. There was no significant difference in serum TPSA, 
ALP and PAP between the two groups in five years (P>0.05). Serum testosterone, 
IPSS score, QOL score, prostate volume, Qmax, Qave, and PVR were significantly 
different between the two groups in five years (P<0.05). Conclusion: pTURP for 
elderly patients with localized prostate adenocarcinoma and BPH combined with 
intermittent ADT is an effective treatment. It is able to solve dysuria. The 
overall ADT time is short. The risk of progression to castrated resistant 
prostate cancer is low. Some of them have achieved tumor-free survival.

BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have the potential 
to alter the natural history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and they should be 
included in cost-effectiveness analyses of screening for CKD.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of adding population-wide 
screening for CKD.
DESIGN: Markov cohort model.
DATA SOURCES: NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), U.S. 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data, cohort studies, and randomized 
clinical trials, including the DAPA-CKD (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse 
Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease) trial.
TARGET POPULATION: Adults.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care sector.
INTERVENTION: Screening for albuminuria with and without adding SGLT2 inhibitors 
to the current standard of care for CKD.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), all discounted at 3% annually.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: One-time CKD screening at age 55 years had an 
ICER of $86 300 per QALY gained by increasing costs from $249 800 to $259 000 
and increasing QALYs from 12.61 to 12.72; this was accompanied by a decrease in 
the incidence of kidney failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplant of 0.29 
percentage points and an increase in life expectancy from 17.29 to 17.45 years. 
Other options were also cost-effective. During ages 35 to 75 years, screening 
once prevented dialysis or transplant in 398 000 people and screening every 10 
years until age 75 years cost less than $100 000 per QALY gained.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: When SGLT2 inhibitors were 30% less effective, 
screening every 10 years during ages 35 to 75 years cost between $145 400 and 
$182 600 per QALY gained, and price reductions would be required for screening 
to be cost-effective.
LIMITATION: The efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors was derived from a single 
randomized controlled trial.
CONCLUSION: Screening adults for albuminuria to identify CKD could be 
cost-effective in the United States.

Because of the unique biology of sickle cell disease (SCD) as well as the 
societal disadvantages and racial inequities suffered by these patients, 
individuals with SCD have not benefited from the same remarkable advances in 
care and therapeutics as those with other hematologic disorders. Life expectancy 
of individuals with SCD is shortened by ∼20 years even with optimal clinical 
care, and infant mortality continues to be a major concern in low-income 
countries. As hematologists, we must do more. The American Society of Hematology 
(ASH) and the ASH Research Collaborative have instituted a multipronged 
initiative to improve the lives of individuals living with this disease. Here, 
we describe 2 components of this ASH initiative, the Consortium on Newborn 
Screening in Africa (CONSA) to improve the early diagnosis of infants in 
low-resource countries and the SCD Clinical Trial Network to accelerate the 
development of more effective therapeutics and care for those with this 
disorder. The combination of SCD-focused initiatives, ASH Research 
Collaborative, CONSA, and Sickle Cell Clinical Trials Network has enormous 
potential to dramatically alter the course of SCD worldwide. We believe that the 
timing is ripe to embark on these critical and worthwhile initiatives and 
improve the lives of individuals with this disease.

BACKGROUND: The role of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in children with 
primary intracranial atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) remains 
controversial, and real-world data with large sample size are still lacking. 
This study aims to estimate the survival benefit of PORT in pediatric patients 
with resected AT/RT.
METHODS: Using Seer database, we collected 246 eligible intracranial AT/RT 
patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2016 for our analysis. Propensity score 
matching (PSM) analysis was employed to minimize selection bias for evaluation 
of the PORT efficacy. Multivariate Cox regression was conducted to determine the 
factors related to the outcome. Interaction tests were further performed between 
PORT and the prognostic variables. After identifying the significant prognostic 
factors, we further developed a novel prediction model to predict the life 
expectancy of these patients, as well as the potential benefit from PORT.
RESULTS: We found that PORT was significantly related to the improved survival 
after adjusting for other prognosticators in both the entire and PSM-matched 
cohort. Significant interactions of PORT with age at diagnosis and tumor 
extension were also observed. On basis of the prognostic indictors identified by 
L1-penalized lasso Cox regression analysis, a novel nomogram model was 
successfully established and externally validated.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that PORT was significantly associated with the 
improved survival in pediatric AT/RT patients, and the greater survival benefit 
from PORT could be achieved in patients <3 years old or with locoregional 
tumors. The novel prediction model was developed to provide help in clinical 
practice and in the design of related trials.

BACKGROUND: Orthotopic xenograft studies promote the development of 
targeted/personalized therapies to improve the still poor life expectancy of 
glioblastoma patients.
NEW METHOD: We implemented an atraumatic access to glioblastoma with cerebral 
Open Flow Microperfusion (cOFM) by implantation of xenograft cells in rat brain 
with intact blood brain barrier (BBB) and subsequent development of a xenograft 
glioblastoma at the interface between the cOFM probe and surrounding brain 
tissue. Human glioma U87MG cells were implanted at a well-defined position into 
immunodeficient Rowett nude rat´s brain via cOFM (cOFM group) and syringe 
(control group). Characteristics of the mature tumors from both groups were 
assessed.
RESULTS: For the first time xenograft cells were successfully introduced into 
rat brain with intact BBB using cOFM, and the tumor tissue developing around the 
cOFM probe was unaffected by the presence of the probe. Thereby an atraumatic 
access to the tumor was created. The success rate of glioblastoma development in 
the cOFM group was high (>70%). The mature cOFM-induced tumors (20-23 days after 
cell-implantation) resembled the syringe-induced ones and showed typical 
features of human glioblastoma.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: Examining xenograft tumor microenvironment with 
currently available methods inevitably causes trauma that could affect the 
reliability of obtained data.
CONCLUSION: This novel atraumatic access to human glioblastoma in rat brain 
provides the possibility to collect interstitial fluid from functional tumor 
tissue in vivo without trauma generation. Thereby, reliable data can be 
generated promoting drug research, biomarker identification, and enabling 
investigation of the BBB of an intact tumor.

Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is a 
polyphagous insect pest that causes serious damage to various food crops in 
storage. This study aimed to investigate the life-history and demographic 
parameters of P. interpunctella on 5 varieties of date palm fruits (Phoenix 
dactylifera L.), including Dayri, Estemaran, Fersi, Halavi, and Zahedi under 
laboratory conditions. Data were analyzed and compared using the age-stage, 
2-sex life table. Plodia interpunctella completed its development on all date 
varieties. The shortest and longest pre-adult periods were recorded on Zahedi 
(38.47 days) and Estemaran (44.65 days) varieties, respectively. The net 
reproductive rates (R0) were 82.51, 59.05, 63.61, 102.27, and 114.86 offspring 
on Dayri, Estemaran, Fersi, Halavi, and Zahedi varieties, respectively. The 
intrinsic rate of increase (r) were 0.098, 0.085, 0.089, 0.109, and 0.113 day-1 
on Dayri, Estemaran, Fersi, Halavi, and Zahedi varieties, respectively. The 
female fecundity ranged from 133.4 to 259.24 eggs on Estemaran and Zahedi 
varieties, respectively. The highest mean generation time (T) was obtained on 
Estemaran (47.984 days), and the lowest value of this parameter was obtained on 
Zahedi (41.722 days) variety. The results indicated that Zahedi and Halavi 
varieties were the susceptible hosts for P. interpunctella. In contrast, the 
Estemaran and Fersi were the most resistant varieties against P. interpunctella, 
which can be used for integrated management programs to decrease the damage of 
this pest.

Postharvest senescence and disease development can reduce the nutritional value 
of fresh jujube fruit. Herein, four different disease-controlling agents 
(chlorothalonil, CuCl2, harpin and melatonin) were separately applied to fresh 
jujube fruit, and all improved postharvest quality (evaluated by disease 
severity, antioxidant accumulation and senescence) relative to controls. Disease 
severity was drastically inhibited by these agents, in the order 
chlorothalonil > CuCl2 > harpin > melatonin. However, chlorothalonil residues 
were detected even after storage for 4 weeks. These agents increased the 
activities of defense enzymes including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, polyphenol 
oxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase, as well as 
accumulation of antioxidant compounds such as ascorbic acid, glutathione, 
flavonoids and phenolics, in postharvest jujube fruit. The enhanced antioxidant 
content and antioxidant capacity (evaluated by Fe3+ reducing power) was ordered 
melatonin > harpin > CuCl2 > chlorothalonil. All four agents significantly 
delayed senescence (evaluated by weight loss, respiration rate and firmness), 
with the effect ordered CuCl2 > melatonin > harpin > chlorothalonil. Moreover, 
treatment with CuCl2 also increased copper accumulation ~ threefold in 
postharvest jujube fruit. Among the four agents, postharvest treatment with 
CuCl2 could be considered most appropriate for improving postharvest jujube 
fruit quality under low temperature conditions without sterilization.

Due to the high prevalence of low bone mineral density in North Africa and 
Middle East region, estimating its attributable burden would help to a better 
understanding of this neglected condition for policymakers and health 
researchers. This study presented the number of attributable deaths has doubled 
from 1990 to 2019.
PURPOSE: This study provides the latest estimates of the burden of low bone 
mineral density (BMD) from 1990 to 2019 in North Africa and Middle East (NAME) 
region.
METHODS: The data were extracted from the global burden of disease (GBD) 2019 
study to estimate epidemiological indices such as deaths, disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs), and summary exposure value (SEV). SEV is a measure of the 
exposure of the population to a risk factor that considers the amount of 
exposure by the level of risk.
RESULTS: Our findings showed that in 1990-2019, the number of deaths and DALYs 
attributable to low BMD had almost doubled in the region and caused 20,371 (95% 
uncertainty intervals: 14,848-24,374) deaths and 805,959 (630,238-959,581) DALYs 
in 2019. However, DALYs and death rates showed a decreasing trend after age 
standardization. Saudi Arabia had the highest, and Lebanon had the lowest 
age-standardized DALYs rates in 2019, with rates of 434.2 (329.6-534.3) and 90.3 
(70.6-112.1) per 100,000, respectively. The highest burden attributable to low 
BMD was in the 90-94 and over 95 age groups. Also, there was a decreasing trend 
in age-standardized SEV to low BMD for both sexes.
CONCLUSION: Despite the decreasing trend of age-standardized burden indices, 
considerable amounts of deaths and DALYs were attributable to low BMD, 
especially in the elderly population, in the region in 2019. As the positive 
effects of proper interventions will be detectable in the long term, robust 
strategies and comprehensive stable policies are the ultimate solutions to 
achieving desired goals.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Globally, pancreatic cancer is recognized as one of the most 
lethal types of cancers. We report the burden of pancreatic cancer and its 
attributable risk factors in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, 
from 1990 to 2019, by age, sex, and socio-demographic index.
METHODS: Publicly available data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study 
were used to report the incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) attributable to pancreatic cancer, as counts and age-standardized rates 
with 95% uncertainty intervals.
RESULTS: In 2019, pancreatic cancer had an age-standardized incidence rate of 
5.3 and a death rate of 5.5 (per 100 000) in MENA, which have increased by 97.5% 
and 93.4%, respectively, since 1990. There were 563.6 thousand DALYs 
attributable to pancreatic cancer in 2019, with an age-standardized DALY rate of 
123.0, which has increased by 84.9% since 1990. The highest number of incident 
cases was found in the 60-64 and 65-69 age groups, among male and female, 
respectively. In addition, the MENA/global DALY ratios were higher in all age 
groups for both sexes in 2019, than they were in 1990. There was a positive 
association between socio-demographic index and the burden of pancreatic cancer. 
Smoking, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body mass index were responsible 
for 19.2%, 9.3%, and 9.3% of the attributable DALYs in 2019, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a clear and substantial increase in the burden of 
pancreatic cancer in the MENA region. Prevention programs should be implemented 
in the region that target these three risk factors.

A three-dimensional skeleton, π-fused [4.3.3]propellane, was constructed and 
derivatized by selective π-extension at the two naphthalene units. The obtained 
propellanes existed as stereoisomers different in spatial arrangement, one of 
which displayed a chiroptical response originating from through-space 
interactions between 5-azachrysenes in a skew position.

This observational study examines and estimates the trends and impact of 
population ageing on rural aged care needs in Australia. With its universal 
health system and subsidised aged care system, Australia is among those 
countries with a long life expectancy. Being a geographically large country with 
a relatively small and dispersed population presents challenges for equitable 
access to aged care service provision. While this is widely acknowledged, there 
is little empirical evidence to demonstrate the magnitude and location of the 
aged care service provision gaps in the next decade. We performed time series 
analyses on administrative data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the 
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare GEN databases. The Aged Care Planning 
Regions (ACPR) were classified according to geographical remoteness using the 
Modified Monash Model scale. There is currently a shortfall of 2000+ places in 
residential aged care in rural and remote areas of Australia based on 2021 data. 
By 2032, population ageing will mean that an additional 3390 residential care 
places and around 3000 home care packages will be required in rural and remote 
communities alone. Geographical disparities in aged care exist in Australia and 
continue to worsen, requiring immediate action.

In recent years, the elderly has become a rapidly growing proportion of the 
world's population as life expectancy is extending. Immunosenescence and 
inflammaging contribute to the increased risk of chronic non-communicable and 
acute infectious diseases. Frailty is highly prevalent in the elderly and is 
associated with an impaired immune response, a higher propensity to infection, 
and a lower response to vaccines. Additionally, the presence of uncontrolled 
comorbid diseases in the elderly also contributes to sarcopenia and frailty. 
Vaccine-preventable diseases that threaten the elderly include influenza, 
pneumococcal infection, herpes zoster, and COVID-19, which contribute to 
significant disability-adjusted life years lost. Previous studies had shown that 
conventional vaccines only yielded suboptimal protection that wanes rapidly in a 
shorter time. This article reviews published papers on several vaccination 
strategies that were developed for the elderly to solve these problems: more 
immunogenic vaccine formulations using larger doses of antigen, stronger vaccine 
adjuvants, recombinant subunit or protein conjugated vaccines, newly developed 
mRNA vaccines, giving booster shots, and exploring alternative routes of 
administration. Included also are several publications on senolytic medications 
under investigation to boost the immune system and vaccine response in the 
elderly. With all those in regard, the currently recommended vaccines for the 
elderly are presented.
