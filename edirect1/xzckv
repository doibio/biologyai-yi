collected information on how well the participant had recovered 6 months after 
injury. This information was provided either by the participant themself (if 
they were able) and/or a person close to them by completing the Glasgow Outcome 
Scale - Extended (GOSE) questionnaire. Telephone follow-up was carried out by a 
blinded independent clinician.
INTERVENTIONS: The primary intervention to reduce ICP in the hypothermia group 
after randomisation was induction of hypothermia. Core temperature was initially 
reduced to 35 °C and decreased incrementally to a lower limit of 32 °C if 
necessary to maintain ICP at < 20 mmHg. Rewarming began after 48 hours if ICP 
remained controlled. Participants in the standard-care group received usual care 
at that centre, but without hypothermia.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the GOSE [range 1 (dead) 
to 8 (upper good recovery)] at 6 months after the injury as assessed by an 
independent collaborator, blind to the intervention. A priori subgroup analysis 
tested the relationship between minimisation factors including being aged < 45 
years, having a post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) motor score of < 2 
on admission, having a time from injury of < 12 hours and patient outcome.
RESULTS: We enrolled 387 patients from 47 centres in 18 countries. The trial was 
closed to recruitment following concerns raised by the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee in October 2014. On an intention-to-treat basis, 195 
participants were randomised to hypothermia treatment and 192 to standard care. 
Regarding participant outcome, there was a higher mortality rate and poorer 
functional recovery at 6 months in the hypothermia group. The adjusted common 
odds ratio (OR) for the primary statistical analysis of the GOSE was 1.54 [95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 2.31]; when the GOSE was dichotomised the OR 
was 1.74 (95% CI 1.09 to 2.77). Both results favoured standard care alone. In 
this pragmatic study, we did not collect data on adverse events. Data on serious 
adverse events (SAEs) were collected but were subject to reporting bias, with 
most SAEs being reported in the hypothermia group.
CONCLUSIONS: In participants following TBI and with an ICP of > 20 mmHg, 
titrated therapeutic hypothermia successfully reduced ICP but led to a higher 
mortality rate and worse functional outcome.
LIMITATIONS: Inability to blind treatment allocation as it was obvious which 
participants were randomised to the hypothermia group; there was biased 
recording of SAEs in the hypothermia group. We now believe that more adequately 
powered clinical trials of common therapies used to reduce ICP, such as 
hypertonic therapy, barbiturates and hyperventilation, are required to assess 
their potential benefits and risks to patients.

BACKGROUND: Strengthening the health of the young people and adolescents is a 
priority task for the health care system. The posture, as a habitual position of 
the body of a person standing at ease, is formed in the course of the child's 
physical development including the development of the static-dynamic functions. 
The problems of rehabilitation of the school-age children arising from the 
necessity to correct impaired posture, including scoliosis, are associated with 
their life activity and the socio-economic status. The majority of the 
school-age children spending a lot of time watching TV and playing computer 
games instead of going in for sports, keep a sedentary lifestyle, do not eat 
rationally, and experience a deficit of vitamins. These factors contribute to 
the formation of a weak muscular corset and, as a consequence, lead to the 
development of an impaired posture. In terms of physical nature, vibration is a 
mechanical oscillatory motion that repeats itself at certain intervals. The 
vibrational process of a vibrational impact may exert an appreciable biological 
effect on the human body; therefore, vibration is extensively used to correct 
the initial manifestations of the disturbances in the development of posture and 
strengthen the back muscles.
AIM: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of the 
vibrational effect produced by the simulator on the state of the back muscles in 
the 12-13 years old children presenting with the early signs of scoliosis.
METHODS: A total of 40 girls at the age of 12-13 years suffering from 1st degree 
left-sided thoracic spine scoliosis and referred for the rehabilitative 
treatment were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of scoliosis was established 
during a medical examination. The angle of curvature determined as described by 
V.D. Chaklin was 5-10°. The control group was comprised of 20 schoolgirls 
engaged in a special rehabilitation program within the framework of the 
therapeutic physical training (TPT) for 45 minutes three times a week. The main 
study group consisted of the schoolgirls who performed exercises on the 
simulator in addition to the special TPT rehabilitation program. When on the 
vibrating platform in the starting position on all fours, the girls performed 
the following exercises: (a) exercises with the extension and flexion of the 
back ('kitty'); (b) the 'boat' exercise made on a special cushion with the 
retraction of the abdomen, and (c) exercises on a balance with the lifting of 
the left arm and right leg (or vice versa). The duration of the course was 36 
rehabilitation classes. Each lesson lasted 30 minutes.
RESULTS: The above rehabilitative treatment made it possible to achieve a 
significant strengthening of the back muscles with increasing their endurance, 
the improved mobility of the joints of the upper extremities and of the spine 
joints in the girls of the main group in comparison with those comprising the 
control group.
CONCLUSION: The additional and special corrective exercises with the use of the 
vibration platform performed by the girls with first degree scoliosis greatly 
contributed to the enhancement of the muscle strength, increased mobility of the 
spine and the joints of the upper extremities. This allows to conclude that the 
use of the vibration effect produced by physical exercises on the power plate 
simulator may provide an efficient tool for the correction of the initial signs 
of scoliosis and the strengthening of the spine muscles.

Publisher: Обоснование. Укрепление здоровья молодых людей и подростков является 
приоритетной задачей здравоохранения. Осанка как привычное положение тела 
непринужденно стоящего человека формируется в процессе физического развития 
ребенка и развития у него статико-динамических функций. Проблемы реабилитации 
детей школьного возраста, связанные с нарушением осанки, в том числе и со 
сколиозом, обусловлены особенностью их жизнедеятельности и 
социально-экономическим положением. Большинство детей школьного возраста 
проводят много времени у экранов телевизора и компьютера, не занимаются спортом, 
ведут малоподвижный образ жизни, нерационально питаются и имеют дефицит 
витаминов. Это обусловливает формирование слабого мышечного корсета и, как 
следствие, приводит к развитию нарушения осанки. Вибрационное воздействие по 
своей физической природе представляет собой механическое колебательное движение, 
повторяющееся через определенное время. Колебательный процесс вибрационного 
воздействия, оказывая биологическое действие на организм, может быть эффективен, 
поэтому его широко применяют для коррекции начальных проявлений осанки и 
укрепления мышц спины. Цель исследования - оценить влияние вибрационного 
воздействия тренажера на состояние мышц спины у детей 12-13 лет с начальными 
проявлениями сколиоза. Методы. В исследовании приняли участие 40 девочек 12-13 
лет с левосторонним сколиозом I степени грудного отдела позвоночника, 
направленные на реабилитацию. Диагноз 'сколиоз' был выявлен при медицинском 
обследовании. Угол искривления по В.Д. Чаклину составлял 5-10°. Все девочки были 
разделены на 2 группы: основную и контрольную. Контрольную группу составили 20 
школьниц, занимающихся по специальной реабилитационной программе лечебной 
физической культуры (ЛФК) 3 раза в неделю по 45 мин. В основную группу вошли 
школьницы, которые дополнительно с занятиями по специальной реабилитационной 
программе ЛФК занимались на тренажере. Находясь на виброплатформе, в исходном 
положении на четвереньках выполнялись упражнения 'кошечка' (разгибание и 
сгибание спины), 'лодочка' (на специальной подушке с втягиванием живота) и 
упражнения на баланс с приподниманием левой руки и правой ноги или наоборот. 
Длительность курса составляла 36 реабилитационных занятий. Каждое занятие 
длилось 30 мин. Результаты. Достоверное укрепление мышц спины, повышение их 
выносливости, увеличение подвижности суставов верхних конечностей и позвоночника 
у девочек основной группы в сравнении с контрольной группой. Заключение. 
Дополнительное выполнение специальных корригирующих упражнений на виброплатформе 
девочками со сколиозом I степени способствовало повышению мышечной силы, 
увеличению подвижности позвоночника и суставов верхних конечностей. Это 
позволяет сделать вывод, что использование вибрационного воздействия тренажера 
выступает как средство коррекции начальных проявлений сколиоза и укрепления мышц 
позвоночника.

AIMS: The aims of this study were to quantify health state utility values 
(HSUVs) after a tibial fracture, investigate the effect of complications, to 
determine the trajectory in HSUVs that result in these differences and to 
quantify the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) experienced by patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is an analysis of 2138 tibial fractures enrolled in 
the Fluid Lavage of Open Wounds (FLOW) and Study to Prospectively Evaluate 
Reamed Intramedullary Nails in Patients with Tibial Fractures (SPRINT) trials. 
Patients returned for follow-up at two and six weeks and three, six, nine and 12 
months. Short-Form Six-Dimension (SF-6D) values were calculated and used to 
calculate QALYs.
RESULTS: Compared with those who did not have a complication, those with a 
complication treated either nonoperatively or operatively had lower HSUVs at all 
times after two weeks. The HSUVs improved in all patients with the passage of 
time. However, they did not return to the remembered baseline preinjury values 
nor to US age-adjusted normal values by 12 months after the injury.
CONCLUSION: While the acute fracture and complications may have resolved 
clinically, the detrimental effect on a patient's quality of life persists up to 
12 months after the injury. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2018;100-B:1227-33.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In patients with cervical dystonia, abobotulinumtoxinA 
solution for injection (ASI) has been shown to be similarly effective to 
freeze-dried abobotulinumtoxinA in reducing Toronto Western Spasmodic 
Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) total scores. In this secondary analysis, 
quality of life data as evaluated with the Cervical Dystonia Impact Profile 
(CDIP-58) are presented.
METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, active and placebo-controlled 
study followed by an open-label extension (NCT01261611). In the double-blind 
phase, patients were randomized (3:3:1) to one cycle of ASI 500 U (n = 156), 
abobotulinumtoxinA 500 U (n = 159) or placebo (n = 54). Following the 
double-blind phase, all patients received open-label ASI for up to four cycles.
RESULTS: The CDIP-58 total scores were significantly improved at week 4 of the 
double-blind phase in both the ASI 500 U and abobotulinumtoxinA 500 U groups 
versus placebo [least squares mean change from baseline of -9.5 (-11.51, -7.45) 
and -11.2 (-13.2, -9.26) vs. -0.9 (-4.04, 2.14), respectively; both P < 0.0001 
vs. placebo]. All CDIP-58 domains contributed to this improvement and benefits 
were maintained across open-label treatment. Positive correlations were observed 
between CDIP-58 total score and all three TWSTRS domains (R = 0.42-0.62) and for 
all CDIP-58 subscales with the TWSTRS total score and domains (R = 0.23-0.60).
CONCLUSIONS: Repeat ASI injections are similarly effective to abobotulinumtoxinA 
in improving patient-reported outcomes of health-related quality of life. 
Positive correlations were found between TWSTRS total and domain scores and 
CDIP-58 total and domain scores.

BACKGROUND: The assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is 
important for health outcomes research, disease modeling studies and comparisons 
of different healthcare interventions. Yet, only a few tools are available to 
assess HRQoL in 0-1-year-old infants. Furthermore, there is a need for an 
instrument able to assess HRQoL with a single, standardized, overall score in 
the first year of life. Here we described the development of the Infant 
health-related Quality of life Instrument (IQI), a generic, preference-based 
instrument that can be administered through a mobile application for assessing 
HRQoL in 0-1-year-old infants.
METHODS: A multi-step development process began by extracting candidate health 
concepts from relevant measures identified by two literature searches. Next, 
three panels, with experts from Asia, Europe, New Zealand and United States of 
America, and two surveys, with primary caregivers in New Zealand, Singapore, and 
the United Kingdom, evaluated the relevance of the candidate health concepts, 
organized them into attributes based on their similarities, explored alternative 
attributes and generated response scales. Additional interviews assessed the 
cross-cultural interpretability, parents' understanding of health attributes, 
and the usability of the mobile application.
RESULTS: The final list of 7 health attributes included in the IQI consisted of 
sleeping, feeding, breathing, stooling/poo, mood, skin, and interaction. The 
users' experiences with the mobile application were generally positive.
CONCLUSIONS: The IQI is the first generic, preference-based, instrument designed 
to assess overall HRQoL in 0-1-year old infants. It is short and 
easy-to-administer through a mobile application. Moreover, close attention was 
paid to the opinions of the infants' primary caregivers during the instrument 
and mobile application development process.

Rapid population growth and wide host range make Habrobracon hebetor Say 
(Hymenoptera: Braconidae) highly suitable for biological control programs. To 
improve performance of the reared wasps in biological control programs we 
conducted a series of experiments on the effect of mating and carbohydrate 
feeding on life-history traits of this parasitoid. Mating caused a significant 
cost to fecundity, host paralysis and parasitism ability of H. hebetor. Mated 
wasps produced 30.98 and 23.2% less progeny than virgin wasps in unfed and fed 
treatments, respectively. Carbohydrate feeding increased survival only in the 
absence of host larvae. Virgin wasps produced only male offspring while the sex 
ratio produced by mated females was close to 50/50 for both fed and unfed wasps. 
Virgin wasps demonstrated an aggressive parasitism behavior and significantly 
higher paralysis and parasitism rates compared to mated wasps. Virgin wasps fed 
with carbohydrate found significantly more hosts than unfed wasps. To conclude, 
mating disruption in H. hebetor resulted in an aggressive parasitism behavior in 
the laboratory, which may also occur in the field. Therefore mating disruption 
is expected to improve the efficacy of these parasitoids in biocontrol. 
Carbohydrate feeding only improved searching ability and host allocation and 
could be applied in situations where hosts are highly dispersed.

BACKGROUND: Removal of the fallopian tubes at the time of hysterectomy or 
interval sterilization has become routine practice to prevent ovarian cancer. 
While emerging as a strategy, uptake of this procedure at the time of cesarean 
delivery for pregnant women seeking permanent sterilization has not been widely 
adopted due to perceptions of increased morbidity and operative difficulty with 
a lack of available data in this setting.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing 
strategies for long-term sterilization and ovarian cancer risk reduction at the 
time of cesarean delivery, including bilateral tubal ligation, opportunistic 
salpingectomy, and long-acting reversible contraception.
STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness model was constructed 
for pregnant women undergoing cesarean delivery who desired permanent 
sterilization in the US population, comparing 3 strategies: (1) bilateral tubal 
ligation, (2) bilateral opportunistic salpingectomy, and (3) postpartum 
long-acting reversible contraception. This theoretic cohort consisted of 110,000 
pregnant women desiring permanent sterilization at the time of cesarean delivery 
and ovarian cancer prevention at an average of 35 years who were monitored for 
an additional 40 years based on an average US female life expectancy of 75 
years. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. 
Effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life years. Secondary outcomes 
included: the number of ovarian cancer cases and deaths, procedure-related 
complications, and unintended and ectopic pregnancies. The 1-, 2-, and 3-way and 
Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The 
willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000.
RESULTS: Both bilateral tubal ligation and bilateral opportunistic salpingectomy 
with cesarean delivery have favorable cost-effectiveness ratios. In the base 
case analysis, salpingectomy was more cost-effective with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $23,189 per quality-adjusted life year compared to 
tubal ligation. Long-acting reversible contraception after cesarean was not 
cost-effective (ie, dominated). Although salpingectomy and tubal ligation were 
both cost-effective over a wide range of cost and risk estimates, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio analysis was highly sensitive to the 
uncertainty around the estimates of salpingectomy cancer risk reduction, risk of 
perioperative complications, and cost. Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis estimated that tubal ligation had a 49% chance of being the preferred 
strategy over salpingectomy. If the true salpingectomy risk of perioperative 
complications is >2% higher than tubal ligation or if the cancer risk reduction 
of salpingectomy is <52%, then tubal ligation is the preferred, more 
cost-effective strategy.
CONCLUSION: Bilateral tubal ligation and bilateral opportunistic salpingectomy 
with cesarean delivery are both cost-effective strategies for permanent 
sterilization and ovarian cancer risk reduction. Although salpingectomy and 
tubal ligation are both reasonable strategies for cesarean patients seeking 
permanent sterilization and cancer risk reduction, threshold analyses indicate 
that the risks and benefits of salpingectomy with cesarean delivery need to be 
better defined before a preferred strategy can be determined.

OBJECTIVES: To show how prediction models can be incorporated into decision 
models, to allow for personalized decisions, and to assess the value of this 
approach using the management of the neck in early-stage oral cavity squamous 
cell carcinoma as an example.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In a decision model, three approaches were compared: a 
"population-based" approach in which patients undergo the strategy that is 
optimal for the population; a "perfectly predicted" approach, in which each 
patient receives the optimal strategy for that specific patient; and a 
"prediction model" approach in which each patient receives the strategy that is 
optimal based on prediction models. The average differences in costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the population between these approaches 
were studied.
RESULTS: The population-based approach resulted on average in 4.9158 QALYs with 
€8,675 in costs, per patient. The perfectly predicted approach yielded 0.21 more 
QALYs and saved €1,024 per patient. The prediction model approach yielded 0.0014 
more QALYs and saved €152 per patient compared with the population-based 
approach.
CONCLUSION: The perfectly predicted approach shows that personalized care is 
worthwhile. However, current prediction models in the field of oral cavity 
squamous cell carcinoma have limited value. Incorporating prediction models into 
decision models appears to be a valuable method to assess the value of 
personalized decision making.

Low-grade glioma (LGG) usually occurs in young patients who enjoy an active 
family, social, and professional life. Because awake surgery for patients with 
LGG has resulted in significant improvement in both functional and oncological 
outcomes and because the surgery per se is not very expensive, it is currently 
performed in many countries worldwide. Nonetheless, in addition to the necessity 
of tailoring the surgical strategy to the patient (e.g., neurological and 
cognitive status) and tumor (e.g., brain location and volume) characteristics, 
the legal, cultural, and socioeconomic parameters could also play a key role in 
the therapeutic strategy. These include clear information to the patient and 
relatives during the first meeting, the adapted selection of tasks for awake 
mapping, and active collaboration of the patient throughout the resection and 
during the early postoperative rehabilitation. In the present study, our goal 
was to analyze these socioenvironmental aspects, which have been neglected for 
many decades, in LGG management, with a special emphasis on epilepsy and the 
awake procedure. These criteria are relevant with respect to the diagnosis, 
surgery, functional remediation, and long-term follow-up for patients who now 
benefit from a longer life expectancy. However, although such factors are 
essential to resume an active life, including returning to work, they vary 
greatly across countries. Therefore, they should be considered more 
systematically to allow for greater reproducibility of results of awake surgery 
worldwide.

In 2014, 42% of all HIV diagnoses in the East of England were diagnosed late. 
Individuals unaware of their HIV status will not benefit from lifesaving and 
infectious-limiting antiretroviral therapy, and they remain at risk of decreased 
life expectancy and onward transmission of HIV. We sought to identify risk 
factors associated with late HIV diagnosis in the East of England to inform 
future HIV testing and prevention strategies relevant to the local population. 
Data on all HIV infected individuals aged ≥16 years and diagnosed between 2008 
and 2014 in the East of England were obtained from the national HIV and AIDS 
Reporting System. Late diagnosis was defined as CD4 cell count below 350 
cells/mm3 within 91 days of diagnosis. Logistic regression investigated risk 
factors for late HIV diagnosis. A total of 2469 people were included; 1342 (54%) 
were late HIV diagnoses. In multivariable analysis risk factors for late 
diagnosis were: age ≥30 years, originating from WHO regions of South-East Asia 
or Europe (excluding UK), heterosexual orientation and being diagnosed as an 
inpatient or by a general practitioner. The odds of late diagnosis significantly 
reduced every year (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90-0.99, p = 0.042). Despite this 
year-on-year reduction continued high rates suggest future HIV testing and 
prevention strategies should be informed by local regional epidemiology to allow 
those at greatest risk to be targeted appropriately.

BACKGROUND: Blended physiotherapy, in which physiotherapy sessions and an online 
application are integrated, might support patients in taking an active role in 
the management of their chronic condition and may reduce disease related costs. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a blended 
physiotherapy intervention (e-Exercise) compared to usual physiotherapy in 
patients with osteoarthritis of hip and/or knee, from the societal as well as 
the healthcare perspective.
METHODS: This economic evaluation was conducted alongside a 12-month cluster 
randomized controlled trial, in which 108 patients received e-Exercise, 
consisting of physiotherapy sessions and a web-application, and 99 patients 
received usual physiotherapy. Clinical outcome measures were quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) according to the EuroQol (EQ-5D-3 L), physical functioning 
(HOOS/KOOS) and physical activity (Actigraph Accelerometer). Costs were measured 
using self-reported questionnaires. Missing data were multiply imputed and 
bootstrapping was used to estimate statistical uncertainty.
RESULTS: Intervention costs and medication costs were significantly lower in 
e-Exercise compared to usual physiotherapy. Total societal costs and total 
healthcare costs did not significantly differ between groups. No significant 
differences in effectiveness were found between groups. For physical functioning 
and physical activity, the maximum probability of e-Exercise being 
cost-effective compared to usual physiotherapy was moderate (< 0.82) from both 
perspectives. For QALYs, the probability of e-Exercise being cost-effective 
compared to usual physiotherapy was 0.68/0.84 at a willingness to pay of 10,000 
Euro and 0.70/0.80 at a willingness to pay of 80,000 Euro per gained QALY, from 
respectively the societal and the healthcare perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: E-Exercise itself was significantly cheaper compared to usual 
physiotherapy in patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis, but not 
cost-effective from the societal- as well as healthcare perspective. The 
decision between both interventions can be based on the preferences of the 
patient and the physiotherapist.

The frequency and geographic extension of microalgae and gelatinous zooplankton 
blooms seem to have been increasing worldwide over recent decades. In 
particular, the harmful dinoflagellate Ostreopsis cf. ovata and the Schyphozoan 
jellyfish Aurelia sp. are two of the most frequent and long lasting species 
forming blooms in the Mediterranean Sea. A kind of interaction among any of 
their life cycle stages (i.e. planula-polyp-ephyrae vs Ostreopsis cells) can 
likely occur, although in this area there are no data available on the 
co-occurrence of these species. The aim of this study was to investigate, for 
the first time, the potential noxious effect of O. cf. ovata on different life 
stages of Aurelia sp. (polyps and ephyrae), testing several concentrations of 
whole algal culture. Rsults of toxicity bioassay highlighted that ephyrae, but 
not polyps, are affected by this harmful dinoflagellate and comparisons among 
other model organisms show that Aurelia sp. ephyrae are the most sensitive model 
organism tested so far (EC50-24h=10.5cells/mL). These findings suggest an 
interesting scenario on the interaction of these two bloom forming species in 
the natural marine environment.

BACKGROUND: Substantial disparities in life expectancy exist between Chicago's 
77 defined community areas, ranging from approximately 69 to 85 years. Prior 
work in New York City and Boston has shown that community-level racial and 
economic segregation as measured by the Index of Concentration at the Extremes 
(ICE) is strongly related to premature mortality. This novel metric allows for 
the joint assessment of area-based income and racial polarisation. This study 
aimed to assess the relationships between racial and economic segregation and 
economic hardship with premature mortality in Chicago.
METHODS: Annual age-adjusted premature mortality rates (deaths <65 years) from 
2011 to 2015 were calculated for Chicago's 77 community areas. ICE measures for 
household income (<US$25 000 vs ≥US$100 000), race (black vs non-Hispanic 
white), combined ICE measure incorporating income and race, and hardship index 
were calculated from 2015 American Community Survey 5-year estimates.
RESULTS: Average annual premature mortality rates ranged from 94 (95% CI 61 to 
133) deaths per 100 000 population age <65 to 699 (95% CI 394 to 1089). Compared 
with the highest ICE quintiles, communities in the lowest quintiles had 
significantly higher rates of premature mortality (ICEIncomerate ratio 
(RR)=3.06, 95% CI 2.51 to 3.73; ICERaceRR=3.07, 95% CI 2.62 to 3.58; 
ICEIncome+RaceRR=3.27, 95% CI 2.84 to 3.77). Similarly, compared with 
communities in the lowest hardship index quintile, communities in the highest 
quintile had significantly higher premature mortality rates (RR=2.79, 95% CI 
2.18 to 3.57).
CONCLUSIONS: The strong relationships observed between ICE measures and 
premature mortality-particularly the combined ICE metric encompassing race and 
income-support the use of ICE in public health monitoring.

Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator gene (CFTR) that affects the respiratory system. Current 
treatment is palliative, but there is a gene therapy under investigation which 
involves inserting a functional CFTR gene into affected cells. Given the 
clinical variety of the disease, it is necessary to characterize key indicators 
in its evolution (e.g., the number of functional alveolar sacs and its 
relationship with a healthy lung function), to anticipate its advancement. A 
dynamic model was used to evaluate the evolution of cystic fibrosis over time. 
We considered the application of conventional medical treatments and evaluated 
the benefits of the application of an experimental gene therapy that would 
reverse lung damage. Without treatment the life expectancy of the patient is 
low, but it is increased with the application of conventional treatments, being 
the progressive loss of the lung function inevitable. Simulating the application 
of a gene therapy, the life expectancy of patients would not be limited, given 
the recovery of all altered cellular processes. With this model we can make 
predictions that demonstrate the need for a curative treatment, in addition to 
presenting the evolution of pathology in a specific clinical setting. Graphical

A cluster-randomized controlled trial, WorkUp, was conducted for working-aged 
patients at risk of sick leave or on short-term sick leave due to acute/subacute 
neck and/or back pain in Sweden. The purpose of WorkUp was to facilitate 
participants to stay at work or in case of sick leave, return-to-work. The aim 
of this study was to study whether the WorkUp trial was cost-effective. Patients 
in the intervention and reference group received structured evidence-based 
physiotherapy, while patients in the intervention group also received a work 
place dialogue with the employer as an add-on. The participants, 352 in total, 
were recruited from 20 physiotherapeutic units in primary healthcare in southern 
Sweden. The economic evaluation was performed both from a healthcare and a 
societal perspective with a 12-month time frame with extensive univariate 
sensitivity analyses. Results were presented as incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICER) with outcomes measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and 
proportion working for at least 4 weeks in a row without reported sick leave at 
12-month follow-up. From the healthcare perspective, the ICER was €23,606 (2013 
price year) per QALY gain. From the societal perspective the intervention was 
dominating, i.e.. less costly and more effective than reference care. Bootstrap 
analysis showed that the probability of the intervention to be cost-effective at 
€50,000 willingness-to-pay per QALY was 85% from the societal perspective. 
Structured evidence-based physiotherapeutic care together with workplace 
dialogue is a cost-effective alternative from both a societal and a healthcare 
perspective for acute/subacute neck and/or back pain patients.Trial registration

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and incidence of psoriasis and psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA) over time in Ontario, Canada.
METHODS: We performed a population-based study of Ontario health administrative 
data, using validated case definitions for psoriasis and PsA. We computed the 
crude and age- and sex-standardized cumulative prevalence and incidence of 
psoriasis from 2000 to 2015.
RESULTS: Among the 10,774,802 individuals ages ≥20 years residing in Ontario in 
2015, we identified 273,238 patients with psoriasis and 18,655 patients with 
PsA, equating to cumulative prevalence estimates of 2.54% and 0.17%, 
respectively. Correcting the prevalence estimates for imperfect sensitivity and 
specificity resulted in similar estimates. The male:female ratio was 
approximately 1.0 for both conditions. For psoriasis, the age- and 
sex-standardized cumulative prevalence increased from 1.74% in 2000 to 2.32% in 
2015. For PsA, the age- and sex-standardized cumulative prevalence increased 
from 0.09% in 2008 to 0.15% in 2015. Between 2008 and 2015, annual incidence 
rates for psoriasis decreased, whereas those for PsA remained relatively stable.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence and incidence of psoriasis and PsA in Ontario are 
similar to those observed in Europe and the US. The steady increase in the 
prevalence of psoriasis and PsA over the past decade may be due to a combination 
of population aging, population growth, and increasing life expectancy.

Bacillus subtilis 1JN2 can serve as an effective biocontrol agent against 
Ralstonia wilt on tomato, but the efficiency of control depends on the levels of 
heavy metals in the rhizosphere soil. Here, we investigated how the heavy metal 
Cd2+ affects the biocontrol efficacy of B.subtilis 1JN2 on Ralstonia wilt. We 
found that low Cd2+ content of 2 mM or lower had no effects on the biofilm 
formation of 1JN2, while media containing 3 mM or higher Cd2+ levels inhibited 
biofilm formation. Interestingly, high concentration of Cd2+ (5 mM) showed 
inhibition of B.subtilis 1JN2 cell growth. We next tested the effects of Cd2+ on 
the colonization of 1JN2 by supplementing artificial Cd2+ in the tomato 
rhizosphere in a greenhouse setting. We found that 3 mM Cd2+ in the tomato 
rhizosphere inhibited the colonization of B.subtilis 1JN2, Only 103 CFU/mL 1JN2 
was detected one week post treated with 107 CFU/mL but 105 CFU/mL could be 
detected without Cd2+ in the soil. The presence of Cd2+ had no effect on the 
colonization of Ralstonia solanacearum on tomato, but the biocontrol efficacy 
against Ralstonia wilt by 1JN2 decreased 54.2% when the soil contained 3 mM Cd2+ 
compared to the control without Cd2+. Taken together, we found that the failure 
of biofilm formation of Bacillus subtilis 1JN2 that affected by Cd2+ lead to the 
decrease of its biocontrol efficacy against Ralstonia wilt on tomato.
