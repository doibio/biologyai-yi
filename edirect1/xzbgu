This study aims to estimate the number of life years gained with quitting 
smoking in Italian smokers of both sexes, by number of cigarettes smoked per day 
(cig/day) and age at cessation. All-cause mortality tables by age, sex and 
smoking status were computed, based on Italian smoking data, and the survival 
curves of former and current smokers were compared. The more cig/day a man/woman 
smokes, and the younger his/her age of quitting smoking, the more years of life 
he/she gains with cessation. In fact, cessation at age 30, 40, 50, or 60 years 
gained, respectively, about 7, 7, 6, or 5, and 5, 5, 4, or 3 years of life, 
respectively, for men and women that smoked 10-19 cig/day. The gain in life 
years was higher for heavy smokers (9 years for >20 cig/day) and lower for light 
smokers (4 years for 1-9 cig/day). Consistently with prospective studies 
conducted worldwide, quitting smoking increases life expectancy regardless of 
age, gender and number of cig/day. The estimates of the number of years of life 
that could be gained by quitting smoking, when computed specifically for a 
single smoker, could be used by physicians and health professionals to promote a 
quit attempt.

The survival function is often of chief interest in epidemiologic studies of 
time to an event. We develop methods for evaluating center-specific survival 
outcomes through a ratio of survival functions. The proposed method assumes a 
center-stratified additive hazards model, which provides a convenient framework 
for our purposes. Under the proposed methods, the center effects measure is cast 
as the ratio of subject-specific survival functions under two scenarios: the 
scenario in which the subject is treated at center [Formula: see text]; and that 
wherein the subject is treated at a hypothetical center with survival function 
equal to the population average. The proposed measure reduces to the ratio of 
baseline survival functions, but is invariant to the choice of baseline 
covariate level. We derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators, 
and assess finite-sample characteristics through simulation. The proposed 
methods are applied to national kidney transplant data.

Negative religious coping as a correlate of suicidal ideation in patients with 
advanced cancer.

Trevino KM(1), Balboni M, Zollfrank A, Balboni T, Prigerson HG.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between 
negative religious coping (NRC) and suicidal ideation in patients with advanced 
cancer, controlling for demographic and disease characteristics and risk and 
protective factors for suicidal ideation.
METHODS: Adult patients with advanced cancer (life expectancy ≤6 months) were 
recruited from seven medical centers in the northeastern and southwestern USA 
(n = 603). Trained raters verbally administered the examined measures to 
patients upon study entry. Multivariable logistic regression analyses regressed 
suicidal ideation on NRC controlling for significant demographic, disease, risk, 
and protective factors.
RESULTS: Negative religious coping was associated with an increased risk for 
suicidal ideation (OR, 2.65 [95% CI, 1.22, 5.74], p = 0.01) after controlling 
for demographic and disease characteristics, mental and physical health, 
self-efficacy, secular coping, social support, spiritual care received, global 
religiousness and spirituality, and positive religious coping.
CONCLUSIONS: Negative religious coping is a robust correlate of suicidal 
ideation. Assessment of NRC in patients with advanced cancer may identify 
patients experiencing spiritual distress and those at risk for suicidal 
ideation. Confirmation of these results in future studies would suggest the need 
for interventions targeting the reduction of NRC to reduce suicidal ideation 
among advanced cancer patients.

Rheumatoid arthritis during pregnancy and postnatal catch-up growth in the 
offspring.

OBJECTIVE: Active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during pregnancy and the presence of 
rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) are 
associated with lower birth weight of the child. Moreover, treatment of the 
mothers with prednisone may shorten the gestational age at birth. Rapid catch-up 
in weight for length during the first year of life has been related to a worse 
cardiovascular and metabolic profile in early adulthood. This study was 
therefore undertaken to assess the influence of RA disease activity, medication 
use, and presence of RF or ACPAs during pregnancy on the growth of the child in 
the first year of life.
METHODS: Among 180 children born to mothers with RA, the tempo of catch-up in 
weight during the first year of life was studied. Independent variables were the 
extent of RA disease activity (according to the Disease Activity Score in 28 
joints [DAS28]), medication use, and presence of RF or ACPAs during pregnancy.
RESULTS: Of 167 children with available data, 52 (31%) showed catch-up in weight 
in the first year of life, of whom 90% (47 of 52) showed rapid catch-up. An 
elevated DAS28 score in the mother was associated with rapid catch-up in weight 
of the offspring, independent of maternal medication use or the presence of RF 
or ACPAs during pregnancy (odds ratio 1.44 [95% confidence interval 1.07-1.95] 
per 1-point increase in the DAS28). Use of medications during pregnancy had no 
influence on postnatal growth.
CONCLUSION: Elevated RA disease activity during pregnancy should be avoided 
because it is associated with rapid postnatal catch-up in weight, a risk factor 
for a worse cardiovascular and metabolic profile in adults. Medication for RA 
during pregnancy, including prednisone, had no effect on growth. Continuation or 
extension of medication will not only improve maternal health during pregnancy, 
but could be beneficial for the future health of the unborn child.

INTRODUCTION: RP (radical prostatectomy) technique continues the major treatment 
option for men with potential cure and life expectancy exceeding 10 years. The 
aim of the study is to assess the impact of PSM on BR (biochemical relapse), to 
identify PSM risk factors, to clarify the factors involved in BR in the absence 
of PSM.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consultation of 171 medical-records from patients 
submitted to RRP (radical retropubic prostatectomy) between 
January/2000-December/2005. Mean-age: 64 yr. Mean - PSA (positive surgical 
margin): 11.88 ng/ml. Clinical staging: 67.8% cT1, 32.2% cT2. GS: ≤6 (66.1%), =7 
(21.1%), 8-10 (12.3%). PS: pT0 1.2%, pT2 50.3%, pT3a 36.3%, pT3b 12.9%, pT4 
0.6%. pathological Gleason score: ≤6 39.2%, =7 40.9%, 8-10 19.3%. RB definition 
was PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml. Adjusted Odds-Ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 
estimated through univariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: There were PSM in 46 specimens, 28 had single PSM and 18 multiple PSM 
(≥2). BR occurred in 57 patients (33.3%), with an average time after surgery of 
23.5 months - 26 patients had PSM and 31 had not. Statistical significant 
results for BR in variables PSA, PS and PSM. Quadruples if PSM (p <0.0001), 
triples in single PSM (p = 0.01) and is 6x higher in multiple PSM (p = 0.001). 
Regarding factors that influence the presence of PSM, only PS ≥pT3a reach 
statistical significance (p <0.0001). Patients with BR but without PSM (54.38%), 
variables statistically significant were: initial PSA >10, (p = 0.029) and 
pathological Gleason score ≥8 with a risk nearly 4x higher than pathological 
Gleason score ≤6 (p = 0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: Statistical risk analysis concluded that the presence of PSM in RRP 
is strongly influenced by PS ≥pT3a. The presence of PSM and their number 
increase significantly the risk of BR compared to other factors. In the absence 
of PSM, the factors that seem to be crucial and with greater impact on BR are 
initial PSA>10 and pathological Gleason score ≥8.

Living kidney donation is an important option for patients with end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD), and has improved life expectancy and quality for patients 
otherwise requiring maintenance dialysis or deceased-donor transplantation. 
Given the favorable outcomes of live donation and the shortage of organs to 
transplant, individuals with potentially unfavorable demographic and clinical 
characteristics are increasingly being permitted to donate kidneys. While this 
trend has successfully expanded the live donor pool, it has raised concerns as 
to which acceptance criteria are safe. This review aims to summarize the 
existing literature on the outcomes of transplantation from medically complex, 
living kidney donors, including both donor and recipient outcomes when 
available.

A 67-year-old male presented with a gradually progressive low back pain of 2 
years duration. The patient was leading a retired life and there was no history 
of chronic fever or significant trauma. There was no radiation of pain or any 
features suggestive of claudication. There was no history of any comorbidity. 
The pain was aggravated with extension of the spine and relieved with flexion. 
There was no swelling or neurological deficit, but muscle spasm was present. 
Radiographs of the spine revealed degenerative changes in the lumbosacral spine, 
along with articulation of spinous processes at in lumbar spine at all levels 
level suggestive of Baastrup's disease, commonly known as "kissing spine". 
Routine blood investigations were within normal limits. The patient was managed 
conservatively. He was given a week's course of analgesics and muscle relaxants 
and then started on spinal flexion exercises, with significant improvement being 
noted at 6 months follow up.

Malathion is a common pesticide used to control insects in agricultural, 
domestic and industrial sectors in different parts of the world. In this work we 
evaluated the effects of sublethal concentrations of malathion on the 
survivorship and reproductive variables of two cladoceran species Daphnia pulex 
and Diaphanosoma birgei using standard life table demography method. Based on 
preliminary tests, we selected four sublethal concentrations of malathion for 
each cladoceran species. For D. pulex, the malathion concentrations were 0. 225, 
0.45, 0.9 and 1.8ng I(-1) and for D. birgei, these were 0.0281, 0.0562, 0.1125, 
0.225ng I(-1). Our results showed that in general, Daphnia pulex was less 
sensitive than Diaphanosoma birgei to malathion. The average lifespan of Daphnia 
pulex in controls was about 19 days while under similar conditions, that of D. 
birgei was about 21 days. For either cladoceran species, increased pesticide 
concentration resulted in decreased survival; this was more evident in the 
treatment containing the highest concentration of malathion (0.225 ng l(-1)) for 
D. birgei. Fecundity of D. pulex and D. birgei also decreased with increase in 
the concentration of malathion. For a given cladoceran species, compared to 
controls, the gross reproductive, net reproductive rates and the population 
growth rate significantly decreased due to malathion. Compared to the 
survivorship variables (age-specific survival, life expectancy and average 
lifespan), the reproductive parameters (gross reproductive rate, net 
reproductive rate and the rate of population increase) of the two cladoceran 
species were decreased by the pesticide.

BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a condition affecting 8.5 million 
individuals in the United Kingdom (UK). Although many treatment options are 
available, there is a need for a less-invasive treatment for individuals with 
mild to moderate knee OA. The purpose of the present study was to determine 
whether the KineSpring System is a more effective treatment for knee OA when 
compared to other standard treatments, taking into consideration cost-utility 
ratios.
METHODS: Data was collected for the UK population breakdown. A literature search 
provided data on conservative and surgical treatment costs and functional 
outcome scores. The KineSpring System outcome scores were obtained from two 
trials. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and cost-utility ratios were 
calculated for each treatment option, assuming a lifetime durability as well as 
10-year durability.
RESULTS: Assuming lifetime durability, the cost-utility ratios of surgical 
treatment, total knee arthroplasty (TKA), the KineSpring System, and 
conservative treatments, compared to no treatment are £1,303±22/QALY, 
£821±175/QALY, £796±73/QALY and £11,096±1188/QALY, respectively. Assuming a 
treatment durability of 10 years, the cost-utility ratio of surgical treatment, 
TKA, the KineSpring System, and conservative treatments, compared to no 
treatment are £4,153±95 per QALY, £2,698±768 per QALY, £2,848±345 per QALY, and 
£10,624±1528 per QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the KineSpring System is a 
cost-effective treatment for knee OA and is comparable to current 
standard-of-care treatments. Further research is needed to assess the long-term 
outcomes associated with the KineSpring System.

RESULTS: Assuming lifetime durability, the cost-utility ratios of total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA), unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), high tibial 
osteotomy (HTO), the KineSpring System, and conservative treatments, compared to 
no treatment were €2348±70 per QALY, €2040±61 per QALY, €2281 ± 68 per QALY, 
€1669±268 per QALY, and €11,688±2185 per QALY, respectively. Assuming a 
treatment durability of 10 years, the cost-utility ratio of TKA, UKA, HTO, the 
KineSpring System and conservative treatments, compared to no treatment were 
€4,884±323 per QALY, €4243±280 per QALY, €4,744 ±313 per QALY, €3757±1353 per 
QALY, and €10,575±4414 per QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Compared to current standard-of-care treatments, the KineSpring 
System has a favorable cost-utility ratio, making it an effective treatment 
option and a suitable cost-saving alternative. The KineSpring System is 
associated with lower cost and increased QALYs. Future research is needed to 
further examine the long-term outcomes associated with the KineSpring System.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the independent effect of waist circumference on mortality 
across the entire body mass index (BMI) range and to estimate the loss in life 
expectancy related to a higher waist circumference.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We pooled data from 11 prospective cohort studies with 
650,386 white adults aged 20 to 83 years and enrolled from January 1, 1986, 
through December 31, 2000. We used proportional hazards regression to estimate 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association of waist circumference with 
mortality.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 9 years (maximum, 21 years), 78,268 
participants died. After accounting for age, study, BMI, smoking status, alcohol 
consumption, and physical activity, a strong positive linear association of 
waist circumference with all-cause mortality was observed for men (HR, 1.52 for 
waist circumferences of ≥110 vs <90 cm; 95% CI, 1.45-1.59; HR, 1.07 per 5-cm 
increment in waist circumference; 95% CI, 1.06-1.08) and women (HR, 1.80 for 
waist circumferences of ≥95 vs <70 cm; 95% CI, 1.70-1.89; HR, 1.09 per 5-cm 
increment in waist circumference; 95% CI, 1.08-1.09). The estimated decrease in 
life expectancy for highest vs lowest waist circumference was approximately 3 
years for men and approximately 5 years for women. The HR per 5-cm increment in 
waist circumference was similar for both sexes at all BMI levels from 20 to 50 
kg/m(2), but it was higher at younger ages, higher for longer follow-up, and 
lower among male current smokers. The associations were stronger for heart and 
respiratory disease mortality than for cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: In white adults, higher waist circumference was positively 
associated with higher mortality at all levels of BMI from 20 to 50 kg/m(2). 
Waist circumference should be assessed in combination with BMI, even for those 
in the normal BMI range, as part of risk assessment for obesity-related 
premature mortality.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is increasing, with more elderly people categorized 
as obese. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of laparoscopic 
adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) on patients aged ≥ 70 years.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients aged ≥ 70 years who 
underwent LAGB at our university hospital between 2003 and 2011. The data 
included age, weight, body mass index (BMI), and percentage excess weight loss 
(%EWL) obtained before and after gastric banding. Operative data, length of 
stay, postoperative complications, and resolution of co-morbid conditions were 
also analyzed.
RESULTS: Fifty-five patients aged ≥ 70 years (mean 73 years) underwent gastric 
banding between 2003 and 2012. Mean preoperative weight and BMI were 123 
kilograms and 45 kg/m(2), respectively. On average, each patient had 4 
co-morbidities preoperatively, with hypertension (n = 49; 86%), dyslipidemia (n 
= 40; 70%), and sleep apnea (n = 31; 54%) being the most common. Mean operating 
room (OR) time was 49 minutes, with all patients discharged within 24 hours. 
There was 1 death at 4 years from myocardial infarction, no intensive care unit 
admissions, and no 30-day readmissions. Mean %EWL at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years was 
36 (± 12.7), 40 (± 16.4), 42 (± 19.2), 41 (± 17.1), 50 (± 14.9), and 48 (± 
22.6), respectively. Follow-up rates ranged from 55/55 (100%) at 6 months to 7/9 
(78%) of eligible patients at 5 years and 2/2 (100%) at 8 years. Complications 
included 1 band slip at year 5, 1 band removed for intolerance, and 1 port site 
hernia. The resolution of hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, lower back 
pain, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes was 27%, 28%, 35%, 31%, and 35%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: LAGB as a primary treatment for obesity in carefully selected 
patients aged ≥ 70 can be well tolerated and effective with moderate resolution 
of co-morbid conditions and few complications.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an infrequent 
autosomal dominant disease characterised by the appearance of viii nerve 
schwannomas, meningiomas and ocular abnormalities. Incidence of 1:25,000 and 
prevalence above 1:80,000 are estimated in general. The objectives of our study 
were to determine current prevalence of NF2 in the Community of Cantabria and 
the province of Las Palmas, and its head and neck manifestations.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a population-based, retrospective study in 3 
tertiary hospitals.
RESULTS: The study population showed prevalence of 1:600,000 in the Community of 
Cantabria and 1:280,000 in the province of Las Palmas. The most frequently 
diagnosed tumour was acoustic neuroma (n=15), followed by trigeminal neurinoma 
(n=2) and vagus (n=1).
CONCLUSIONS: Cases of NF2 are infrequent in Cantabria and Las Palmas, lower than 
that reported in the literature. The most frequently described head and neck 
tumour in the literature is acoustic neuroma, followed by schwannoma of cranial 
nerves v and x. Other tumours such as nasal, laryngeal, chorda tympani or 
cranial nerve vii schwannomas are also described. The most frequent ENT 
manifestation is hearing loss, especially unilateral, followed by cervical mass, 
tinnitus and headache. Early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management in 
specialised centres could improve life expectancy and quality of life for these 
patients.

INTRODUCTION: Extended duration anticoagulation with rivaroxaban for an 
additional 6-12 months can reduce recurrent venous thromboembolic events (VTE) 
compared to placebo by ~82%, but at the detriment of increased bleeding. We 
sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of extended duration prophylaxis of 
recurrent VTE with rivaroxaban.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of extended duration rivaroxaban, 20mg daily, compared to 
placebo using a Medicare perspective, a one-monthcycle length and a 40-year time 
horizon. The model assumed a cohort of 58-year-old patients who had already 
completed an initial 6-12 months of anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or a 
vitamin K antagonist; and whom prescribers had clinical equipoise with respect 
to the need for continued anticoagulation. Data sources included 
EINSTEIN-Extension and other published studies of VTE. Outcomes included direct 
treatment costs (in 2013US$), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: Extended duration rivaroxaban resulted in higher treatment costs 
($22,645 vs. $22,083) but yielded greater QALYs (16.167 vs. 16.134) as compared 
to placebo; corresponding to an ICER of $17,030/QALY gained. Our model was most 
sensitive to the baseline risk of bleeding and recurrent VTE, the hazard ratio 
of developing a recurrent event while on rivaroxaban and time horizon. Monte 
Carlo Simulation suggested rivaroxaban would be cost-effective in 66% of 10,000 
iterations, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: Despite the cost of rivaroxaban and an increased risk of bleeding, 
extending VTE treatment for an additional 6-12 months with rivaroxaban was found 
cost-effective compared to the placebo over a 40-year time horizon.

BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced heart failure may receive a left ventricular 
assist device (LVAD) as part of a bridge-to-transplant (BTT) strategy. The 
United Kingdom National Health Service (UK NHS) has financed a BTT program in 
which the predominant LVADs used have been the HeartMate II (HM II; Thoratec, 
Pleasanton, CA) and HeartWare (HW; HeartWare International, Inc. Framingham, 
MA). We aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of the use of these within the 
NHS program.
METHODS: Individual patient data from the UK NHS Blood and Transplant Data Base 
were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and competing outcomes methodologies. Outcomes 
were time to death, time to heart transplant (HT), and cumulative incidences of 
HT, death on LVAD support, and LVAD explantation. A semi-Markov multistate 
economic model was built to assess cost-effectiveness. The perspective was from 
the NHS, discount rates were 3.5%. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) and incremental cost (2011 prices in GB£) per QALY (ICER) for HW vs HM 
II.
RESULTS: Survival was better with HW support than with HM II. Cumulative 
incidence of HT was low for both groups (11% at ~2 years). HW patients accrued 
4.99 lifetime QALYs costing £258,913 ($410,970), HM II patients accrued 3.84 
QALYs costing £231,871 ($368,048); deterministic and probabilistic ICERs for HW 
vs HM II were £23,530 ($37,349) and £20,799 ($33,014), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients In the UK BTT program who received the HW LVAD had a 
better clinical outcome than those who received the HM II, and the HW was more 
cost-effective. This result needs to be reassessed in a randomized controlled 
trial comparing the 2 devices.

The prevention or delay of the onset of age-related diseases prolongs survival 
and improves quality of life while reducing the burden on the health care 
system. Activation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, 
improves metabolism and confers protection against physiological and cognitive 
disturbances in old age. SRT1720 is a specific SIRT1 activator that has health 
and lifespan benefits in adult mice fed a high-fat diet. We found extension in 
lifespan, delayed onset of age-related metabolic diseases, and improved general 
health in mice fed a standard diet after SRT1720 supplementation. Inhibition of 
proinflammatory gene expression in both liver and muscle of SRT1720-treated 
animals was noted. SRT1720 lowered the phosphorylation of NF-κB pathway 
regulators in vitro only when SIRT1 was functionally present. Combined with our 
previous work, the current study further supports the beneficial effects of 
SRT1720 on health across the lifespan in mice.

BACKGROUND: Low dose X-irradiation (IR) from computer tomography (CT) can 
generate free radicals, which can damage biologically relevant molecules and 
ultimately lead to cancer. These effects are especially concerning for children 
owing to their higher radiosensitivity and longer life expectancy than adults. 
The lipid phase micronutrients (LPM) coenzyme Q10, carotenoids, E vitamers, and 
vitamin A are potent radical scavengers that can act as intracellular 
antioxidants.
METHODS: We investigated changes in circulating levels of these LPM in 17 
children (0.25-6 y) undergoing medically indicated CT scans involving relatively 
low IR doses. Blood was drawn before and 1h after CT scans and analyzed using 
HPLC with electrochemical and UV/VIS detection.
RESULTS: We found significant decreases (p<0.05) in post-CT plasma levels in 
several LPM which suggests that these LPM can serve as biodosimeters and may 
protect against damage from IR during clinical procedures such as CT. The 
strongest predictors for pre- to post-CT changes for many LPM were their 
baseline levels.
CONCLUSION: Future larger studies are warranted to confirm our findings and to 
test whether high circulating antioxidant levels protect against IR damage in 
vivo with an ultimate goal of establishing prophylactic modalities for 
CT-induced IR damage.

Routine real-time cost-effectiveness monitoring of a web-based depression 
intervention: a risk-sharing proposal.

Naveršnik K(1), Mrhar A.

BACKGROUND: A new health care technology must be cost-effective in order to be 
adopted. If evidence regarding cost-effectiveness is uncertain, then the 
decision maker faces two choices: (1) adopt the technology and run the risk that 
it is less effective in actual practice, or (2) reject the technology and risk 
that potential health is forgone. A new depression eHealth service was found to 
be cost-effective in a previously published study. The results, however, were 
unreliable because it was based on a pilot clinical trial. A conservative 
decision maker would normally require stronger evidence for the intervention to 
be implemented.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate how to facilitate service 
implementation by shifting the burden of risk due to uncertainty to the service 
provider and ensure that the intervention remains cost-effective during routine 
use.
METHODS: We propose a risk-sharing scheme, where the service cost depends on the 
actual effectiveness of the service in real-life setting. Routine efficacy data 
can be used as the input to the cost-effectiveness model, which employs a 
mapping function to translate a depression specific score into quality-adjusted 
life-years. The latter is the denominator in the cost-effectiveness ratio 
calculation, required by the health care decision maker. The output of the model 
is a "value graph", showing intervention value as a function of its observed 
(future) efficacy, using the €30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
threshold.
RESULTS: We found that the eHealth service should improve the patient's outcome 
by at least 11.9 points on the Beck Depression Inventory scale in order for the 
cost-effectiveness ratio to remain below the €30,000/QALY threshold. The value 
of a single point improvement was found to be between €200 and €700, depending 
on depression severity at treatment start. Value of the eHealth service, based 
on the current efficacy estimates, is €1900, which is significantly above its 
estimated cost (€200).
CONCLUSIONS: The eHealth depression service is particularly suited to routine 
monitoring, since data can be gathered through the Internet within the service 
communication channels. This enables real-time cost-effectiveness evaluation and 
allows a value-based price to be established. We propose a novel pricing scheme 
where the price is set to a point in the interval between cost and value, which 
provides an economic surplus to both the payer and the provider. Such a business 
model will assure that a portion of the surplus is retained by the payer and not 
completely appropriated by the private provider. If the eHealth service were to 
turn out less effective than originally anticipated, then the price would be 
lowered in order to achieve the cost-effectiveness threshold and this risk of 
financial loss would be borne by the provider.

Group, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.

For centuries, the general consensus has been that vigorous, competitive 
exercise was harmful and shortened life expectancy. Recent data from prospective 
cohort studies conducted on marathon runners, professional cyclists, and Olympic 
athletes indicate, however, that regular intense endurance-exercise training has 
protective benefits against cardiovascular disease and premature death. There 
are still important questions to be answered, such as what is the optimal dose, 
in terms of both duration and intensity of training or competition, beyond which 
the health benefits of regular exercise stabilize or might even potentially 
disappear.

The results from randomized clinical trials are often adopted slowly. This 
practice potentially prevents many people from benefiting from more effective 
care. Provide a framework for analyzing clinical trial results to determine 
whether and when early adoption of novel interventions is appropriate. The 
framework includes the evaluation of three components: confidence in trial 
results, impact of early, and late adoption if trial results are reversed or 
sustained. The adverse impact of early adoption, and the opportunity cost of 
late adoption are determined using Markov modeling to simulate the impact of 
early and late adoption in terms of quality of life years and resources gained 
or lost. We applied the framework to the TARGIT-A randomized clinical trial 
comparing intraoperative radiation (IORT) to standard external beam radiation 
(EBRT) and considered these results in the context of trials comparing endocrine 
therapy with and without radiation therapy in postmenopausal women. Confidence 
in the TARGIT-A trial 4 year results is high because the peak hazard for local 
recurrence in the trial is between 2 and 3 years. This is consistent with most 
trials, and no second peak has been observed in similar patient populations, 
suggesting that the TARGIT-A trial results are stable. The interventions offer 
approximately equivalent life expectancy. If IORT local recurrences rate were as 
high as 10 % at 10 years (which is higher than expected), we would project only 
0.002 fewer expected life years (less than 1 day) compared to EBRT if IORT is 
adopted early. However, there is a $1.7 billion opportunity cost of waiting an 
additional 5 years to adopt IORT in low risk, hormone-receptor-positive, 
postmenopausal women. EBRT costs an additional $1467 in indirect costs per 
patient. Applying an evaluative framework for the adoption of clinical trial 
results to the TARGIT-A IORT therapy trial results in the assessment that the 
trial results are stable, early adoption would lead to minimal adverse impact, 
and substantially less resource use. Both IORT and no radiation are reasonable 
strategies to adopt.

Health care expenditures and longevity: is there a Eubie Blake effect?

It is still an open question whether increasing life expectancy as such causes 
higher health care expenditures (HCE) in a population. According to the "red 
herring" hypothesis, the positive correlation between age and HCE is exclusively 
due to the fact that mortality rises with age and a large share of HCE is caused 
by proximity to death. As a consequence, rising longevity-through falling 
mortality rates-may even reduce HCE. However, a weakness of many previous 
empirical studies is that they use cross-sectional evidence to make inferences 
on a development over time. In this paper, we analyse the impact of rising 
longevity on the trend of HCE over time by using data from a pseudo-panel of 
German sickness fund members over the period 1997-2009. Using (dynamic) panel 
data models, we find that age, mortality and 5-year survival rates each have a 
positive impact on per-capita HCE. Our explanation for the last finding is that 
physicians treat patients more aggressively if the results of these treatments 
pay off over a longer time span, which we call "Eubie Blake effect". A 
simulation on the basis of an official population forecast for Germany is used 
to isolate the effect of demographic ageing on real per-capita HCE over the 
coming decades. We find that, while falling mortality rates as such lower HCE, 
this effect is more than compensated by an increase in remaining life expectancy 
so that the net effect of ageing on HCE over time is clearly positive.

Recent trials have highlighted the comparable mortality benefits and durability 
of the results for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and high surgical 
risk managed with either transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or 
surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). Various national guidelines and 
international regulatory bodies have approved TAVR, thereby leading to potential 
wide usage and dissemination of this technique worldwide. Quality-of-life 
outcomes, in spite of being an important measure of success and acceptability of 
the procedure, have not been publicized as extensively. For high risk patients 
with severe AS, implementation of TAVR has resulted in comparable survival, but 
different and novel adverse events compared with AVR. We present an updated 
review focusing on the quality-of-life outcomes and issues with this new and 
important procedural approach.

Despite improvements in bioprosthetic valve function, increased human 
life-expectancy has led to a growing number of bioprosthetic valve deterioration 
cases requiring reoperation. We report 2 cases of primary tissue failure of a 
bioprosthetic valve, which were treated by mitral valve replacement using the 
valve-on-valve method. The reasons for the reoperations were a severely 
calcified valve annulus, and severe adhesion of a previous bioprosthetic valve. 
We removed only the leaflets of the bioprosthetic valve and sutured a 
Carbomedics OptiForm valve onto the sewing cuff of the previous bioprosthesis. 
No complications, including major cardiac events, were noted during the 
follow-up.
