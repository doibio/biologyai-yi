BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence in the literature on the long-term 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatments for Acute Severe Ulcerative 
Colitis (ASUC). The study aimed to perform decision analytic model-based 
long-term cost-utility analysis (CUA) of infliximab versus ciclosporin for 
steroid-resistant ASUC investigated in CONSTRUCT pragmatic trial.
METHODS: A decision tree (DT) model was developed using two-year health effect, 
resource use and costs data from CONSTRUCT trial to estimate relative 
cost-effectiveness of two competing drugs from the United Kingdom (UK) National 
Health Services (NHS) perspective. Using short-term trial data, a Markov model 
(MM) was then developed and evaluated over further 18 years. Both DT and MM were 
combined to investigate cost-effectiveness of infliximab versus ciclosporin for 
ASUC patients over 20-year time horizon, with a rigorous multiple deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to address uncertainty in results.
RESULTS: The decision tree mirrored trial-based results. Beyond 2-year trial 
follow-up, Markov model predicted a decrease in colectomy rate, but it remained 
slightly higher for ciclosporin. NHS costs and quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs) over base-case 20 year time horizon were £26,793 and 9.816 for 
ciclosporin and £34,185 and 9.106 for infliximab, suggesting ciclosporin 
dominates infliximab. Ciclosporin had 95% probability of being cost-effective at 
a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold value up to £20,000.
CONCLUSION: Using data from a pragmatic RCT, the cost-effectiveness models 
produced incremental net health benefit in favour of ciclosporin relative to 
infliximab. Results from long-term modelling indicated that ciclosporin remains 
dominant compared with infliximab for the treatment of NHS ASUC patients, 
however, these need to be interpreted cautiously.

BACKGROUND: Fear of firework noises and other loud, sudden noises (noise 
reactivity) is a significant problem for many dogs and may have a negative 
effect on both welfare and, in severe cases, the life expectancy of dogs. A wide 
range of behavior traits, including fear-related behaviors, have high 
heritability estimates in dogs. The aim of this study was to estimate genomic 
heritability for fear of fireworks and loud noises in dogs.
RESULTS: A genomic heritability estimate was performed based on genome-wide SNPs 
from standard poodles with records of fear of fireworks and noise reactivity. 
The study was based on questionnaires answered by owners, who also volunteered 
to return a cheek swab from their dog for DNA analyses. SNP-based heritability 
was estimated to be 0.28 for firework fear and 0.16 for noise reactivity. We 
also identified an interesting region on chromosome 17 that was weakly 
associated with both traits.
CONCLUSIONS: We have estimated low to medium genomic heritabilities for fear of 
fireworks and noise reactivity in standard poodles. We have also identified an 
interesting region on chromosome 17, which harbors genes that have been shown to 
be involved in different psychiatric traits with anxiety components in humans. 
The region was associated with both traits; however, the association was weak 
and need further verification from other studies.

Plain Language Summary: The prevalence of fear of fireworks and loud noises is 
very high in many dog ​​breeds and can be a serious problem for both the dogs 
and the owners. A genetic study of fear of fireworks and fear of other loud 
noises was conducted on standard poodles. The study was based on owner 
questionnaires, where the dog owners scored their dogs’ degree of fearfulness 
from 1 (not fearful) to 5 (very fearful). We estimated genomic heritabilities of 
28% for fear of fireworks and 15% for noise reactivity. We also identified a 
region on chromosome 17 with a possible association with the two traits. This 
genomic region contains genes of interest in human anxiety-related disorders. 
Genomic studies in dog breeds where the individuals with and without 
fear-associated phenotypes can be clearly distinguished, based on owner records, 
may provide opportunities for the implementation of methods for genomic 
selection for those fear-associated traits. The results of this study may be 
helpful for standard poodle breeders in their selection of breeding animals, 
which ultimately will contribute to better animal welfare.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with schizophrenia have shortened life expectancy due to 
greater cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Due to sparse data, index study was 
planned to assess the CVD risk factors, vascular age (VA), and hematological 
parameters in patients with schizophrenia and the concordance between Framingham 
Risk Score (FRS) for lipids and body mass index (BMI) (FRSLIPIDS and FRSBMI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with schizophrenia (n = 53) were evaluated for 
the presence of metabolic syndrome (MS) using the modified NCEP ATP III 
criteria, along with their functionality, illness severity, physical activity 
and nutritional score, FRSLIPIDS and FRSBMI, and hematological parameters.
RESULTS: Prevalence of MS was 39.6%; in addition, 47% of patients were at risk 
for developing MS as they fulfilled one or two components of MS criteria and 56% 
of patients were obese. BMI, obesity, and RBC count were found as significant 
correlates for MS. CVD risk (FRS) median score (3.10) was comparable for BMI and 
lipid criteria along with significant correlation for FRSLIPIDS and FRSBMI (r = 
0.555, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: VA and 10-year CVD risk (FRS for BMI and lipid criteria) represent 
easier way to communicate with the patients and caregivers and also to guide for 
comprehensive treatment plan, appropriate nutrition, physical activity, and 
cardiometabolic screening.

Maintenance therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has changed the 
treatment paradigm of metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC). The JAVELIN Bladder 
100 trial established avelumab, one of several ICIs in use today, as a 
life-prolonging maintenance therapy for patients with advanced urothelial 
carcinoma. Platinum-based chemotherapy is most often used in the first-line 
treatment of mUC, and while response rates approach about 50%, disease control 
is usually short-lived upon completion of the standard three to six cycles of 
chemotherapy. Much progress has been made in recent years in the second-line 
space and beyond with the use of ICIs, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in eligible patients at the time of disease 
progression post-platinum-based chemotherapy. However, many patients with 
progressive mUC after first-line chemotherapy suffer from rapid progression of 
disease, treatment toxicity with subsequent lines of therapy, and a limited life 
expectancy. Until the results of the JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial were presented in 
2020, there were no maintenance strategies proven to be beneficial over best 
supportive care after disease control is achieved with first-line platinum-based 
chemotherapy. To date, standard of care frontline treatment of metastatic 
urothelial cancer remains to be four to six cycles of platinum-based 
chemotherapy followed by maintenance avelumab. This review summarizes the 
current evidence available on maintenance therapies in mUC, as well as several 
highly anticipated clinical trials that we hope will result in further progress 
in the management of this aggressive cancer and improve patient outcomes.

USA.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), also known as medically 
refractory epilepsy, is a disorder of high prevalence and negatively impacts a 
patients quality of life, neurodevelopment, and life expectancy. Pediatric 
epilepsy surgery has been conducted since the late 1800s, and randomized 
controlled trials have demonstrated the marked effectiveness of surgery on 
seizure reduction and the potential for cure. Despite the strong evidence for 
pediatric epilepsy surgery, there is also strong evidence describing its 
underutilization. The objective of this narrative review is to describe the 
history, strength, and limitations in the evidence of surgery for pediatric drug 
resistant epilepsy.
METHODS: This narrative review was conducted utilizing standard search engines 
to include the relevant articles on the topic of surgery for drug resistant 
epilepsy in children, with main keywords including surgery in pediatric epilepsy 
and drug-refractory epilepsy.
KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: The first components describe the historical 
perspective of pediatric epilepsy surgery and the evidence that highlight the 
strengths and limitations of epilepsy surgery. We then highlight the importance 
of presurgical referral and evaluation, followed by a section detailing the 
surgical options for children with DRE. Lastly, we provide a perspective on the 
future of pediatric epilepsy surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supports the role for surgery in pediatric medically 
refractory epilepsy in seizure frequency reduction, improved curative rates, and 
improvements in neurodevelopment and quality of life.

Life expectancy for persons with hemophilia has increased over recent decades 
due to advances in treatment practice and patient care. Those with hemophilia 
are now more likely to be affected by conditions associated with aging, such as 
myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic/ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism, and intracranial hemorrhage. Here, we describe the results 
of a literature search designed to summarize current data on the prevalence of 
the above selected bleeding and thrombotic events in persons with hemophilia vs 
the general population. A total of 912 articles published between 2005 and 2022 
were identified in a search of BIOSIS Previews, Embase, and MEDLINE databases 
conducted in July 2022. Case studies, conference abstracts, review articles, 
studies focusing on hemophilia treatments or surgical outcomes, and studies 
examining patients with inhibitors only were excluded. After screening, 83 
relevant publications were identified. The prevalence of bleeding events was 
consistently higher in hemophilia populations vs reference populations 
(hemorrhagic stroke, 1.4%-5.31% vs 0.2%-0.97%; intracranial hemorrhage, 
1.1%-10.8% vs 0.04%-0.4%). Serious bleeding events showed a high rate of 
mortality with standardized mortality ratios for intracranial hemorrhage ranging 
from 3.5 to 14.88. Although 9 studies reported lower prevalence of arterial 
thrombosis (myocardial infarction/stroke) in hemophilia vs general populations, 
5 studies reported higher or comparable prevalence in hemophilia. Prospective 
studies are therefore needed to understand the prevalence of bleeding and 
thrombotic events in hemophilia populations, particularly with the observed 
increases in life expectancy and availability of novel treatments.

Meat and meat products are important foods in the human diet, but there are 
concerns about their quality and safety. The discovery of carcinogenic and 
genotoxic N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) in processed meat products has had serious 
negative impacts on the meat industry. In order to clarify the relationship 
between the use of nitrite or nitrate and the safety of meat or meat products, 
we reviewed NOCs in meat and meat products, the origin and safety implications 
of NOCs, effects of nitrite and nitrate on meat quality, national regulations, 
recent publications concerning the using of nitrite and nitrate in meat or meat 
products, and reduction methods. By comparing and analyzing references, (1) we 
found antioxidant, flavor improvement and shelf-life extension effects were 
recently proposed functions of nitrite and nitrate on meat quality, (2) the 
multiple functions of nitrite and nitrate in meat and meat products couldn't be 
fully replaced by other food additives at present, (3) we observed that the 
residual nitrite in raw meat and fried meat products was not well monitored, (4) 
alternative additives seem to be the most successful methods of replacing 
nitrite in meat processing, currently. The health risks of consuming processed 
meat products should be further evaluated, and more effective methods or 
additives for replacing nitrite or nitrate are needed.

Background Heart failure is a public health issue worldwide. However, no 
comprehensive study on the global burden of heart failure and its contributing 
causes has been reported. The present study aimed to quantify the burden, 
trends, and inequalities of heart failure globally. Methods and Results Heart 
failure data were extracted from the Global Burden of Diseases 2019 study. The 
number of cases, age-standardized prevalence, and years lived with disability in 
different locations from 1990 to 2019 were presented and compared. Joinpoint 
regression analysis was performed to assess trends in heart failure from 1990 to 
2019. In 2019, the global age-standardized prevalence and years lived with 
disability rates for heart failure were 711.90 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 
591.15-858.29) and 63.92 (95% UI, 41.49-91.95) per 100 000 population, 
respectively. In general, the age-standardized rate decreased globally at an 
average annual percentage change of 0.3% (95% UI, 0.2-0.3). However, the rate 
increased at an average annual percentage change of 0.6% (95% UI, 0.4-0.8) from 
2017 to 2019. Several nations and territories demonstrated an increased trend 
from 1990 to 2019, especially in less-developed countries. Ischemic heart 
disease and hypertensive heart disease accounted for the highest proportion of 
heart failure in 2019. Conclusions Heart failure remains a major health problem, 
with increased trends possible in the future. Efforts for prevention and control 
of heart failure should focus more on less-developed regions. It is essential to 
prevent and treat primary diseases such as ischemic heart disease and 
hypertensive heart disease for the control of heart failure.

INTRODUCTION: Skin rejuvenation techniques have gained substantial popularity 
due to increased life expectancy over recent years. Platelet-rich fibrin matrix 
(PRFM) is the new generation of platelet aggregate products that have surfaced 
in recent years to treat skin aging.
OBJECTIVES: We intend to use PRF to correct periorbital wrinkles in 15 
volunteers and evaluate its effectiveness in this study.
METHODS: To evaluate the efficacy of PRFM intervention, eight men and women over 
the age of thirty entered our study. Blood samples were taken and were 
immediately centrifuged at 700rpm for 5 minutes. PRFM was extracted from the 
plasma and injected at the sub-dermis site in periorbital areas. The initial 
severity of periorbital wrinkles was determined by Visioface 1000D, and obtained 
data were delivered to the statistical unit for statistical analysis. Scoring 
and evaluation were based on tissue volume and depth and were measured before 
and twelve weeks after injection. Adverse effects were also taken into 
consideration.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated noticeable improvement in deep, fine, and 
small wrinkles, periocular hyperpigmentation, and overall skin freshness of the 
injection site. The subjects had swelling in the injection site for up to one 
day after the injection, which resolved without complications.
CONCLUSIONS: PRFM was observed to have potential in skin rejuvenation, 
demonstrating promising outcomes in terms of safety and long-term effects in 
improving skin condition.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Neurodevelopmental assessment enables the 
identification of infant developmental disorders in the first months of life. 
Thus, the appropriate therapy can be initiated promptly, increasing the chances 
for correct motor function. Posture asymmetry is one of the crucial aspects 
evaluated during the diagnosis. Available diagnostic methods are mainly based on 
qualitative assessment and subjective expert opinion. Current trends in 
computer-aided diagnosis focus mostly on analyzing infants' spontaneous movement 
videos using artificial intelligence methods, based primarily on limbs movement. 
This study aims to develop an automatic method for determining the infant's 
positional asymmetry in a video recording using computer image processing 
methods.
METHODS: We made the first attempt to determine positional preferences in a 
recording automatically. We proposed six quantitative features describing trunk 
and head position based on pose estimation. As a result of our algorithm, we 
estimate the percentage of each trunk position in a recording using known 
machine learning methods. The training and test sets were created from 51 
recordings collected during our research and 12 recordings from the benchmark 
dataset evaluated by five of our experts. The method was assessed using the 
leave-one-subject-out cross-validation method for ground truth video fragments 
and different classifiers. Log loss for multiclass classification and ROC AUC 
were determined to evaluate the results for both our and benchmark datasets.
RESULTS: In a classification of the shortened side, the QDA classifier yields 
the most accurate results, gaining the lowest log loss of 0.552 and AUC of 
0.913. The high accuracy (92.03) and sensitivity (93.26) confirm the method's 
potential in screening for asymmetry.
CONCLUSIONS: The method allows obtaining quantitative information about 
positional preference, a valuable extension of basic diagnostics without 
additional tools and procedures. In combination with an analysis of limbs 
movement, it may constitute one of the elements of a novelty computer-aided 
infants' diagnosis system in the future.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 represents the most severe condition of the 
spectrum of SMA 5q. In the absence of therapeutic interventions, patients do not 
achieve any motor milestone and their life expectancy does not exceed two years 
of age. To date, three disease-modifying drugs have been approved for SMA type 
I. These treatments have radically changed the natural history of the disease, 
improving motor, respiratory and bulbar functions. In recent years huge amount 
of data have been collected worldwide related to motor, respiratory and 
swallowing function outcome in treated patients, whereas the neurocognitive 
profile of treated patients has been poorly explored. Here we report the 
neurocognitive development profile of a cohort of SMA type I children treated 
with a disease modifying therapy. We also describe the burden and resilience as 
well as the coping strategies of their caregivers. Our finding show a global 
developmental delay in most patients and defects in gross motor functions 
contribute most to lower the general development quotient of Griffiths III, 
whereas the scores obtained on evaluating learning and language abilities scales 
suggest a positive trend in the developmental trajectory of general 
neurocognitive abilities. Some parents reported anxiety and stress but overall 
they were resilient (and had good coping strategies towards the burden of care 
for their child. These results reinforce the importance of routinely assessing 
the neurocognitive aspects in SMA type I patients and to offer an early 
intervention to favor the psychosocial development of these children.

AIMS: To assess the trends in calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) epidemiology, 
with an emphasis on CAVD mortality, leading risk factors, and their associations 
with age, period, and birth cohort.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Prevalence, disability-adjusted life years, and mortality 
were derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. The age-period-cohort 
model was employed to study the detailed trends of CAVD mortality and its 
leading risk factors. Globally, CAVD showed unsatisfactory results from 1990 to 
2019, with the CAVD deaths of 127 000 in 2019. CAVD mortality was substantially 
reduced in high socio-demographic index (SDI) countries [-1.45%, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) (-1.61 to -1.30)], mildly increased in high-middle SDI countries 
[0.22%, 95% CI (0.06-0.37)], and unchanged in other SDI quintiles. There was a 
noticeable transition in CAVD deaths from younger to older populations globally. 
The CAVD mortality increased exponentially with age, and the male had higher 
mortality than the female before 80 years old. Favourable period [0.69, 95% CI 
(0.66-0.72)] and birth effects [0.30, 95% CI (0.22-0.43)] were mainly observed 
in high SDI countries, while unfavourable effects were mostly noticed in 
high-middle SDI countries. High systolic blood pressure was the leading risk 
factor of CAVD deaths globally, and it showed favourable trends in high SDI 
regions.
CONCLUSION: Although CAVD mortality reduction was observed globally, 
unfavourable period, and cohort effects were found in many countries. Increase 
of mortality rate among the population ≥85 years was the common challenge across 
all SDI quintiles, stressing the necessity to further improve health care for 
CAVD patients worldwide.

BACKGROUND: Because of the high incidence of major perioperative adverse events, 
spine surgery in dialysis patients should be recommended carefully after 
consideration of its risks and benefits. However, the benefits of spine surgery 
in dialysis patients remain unclear because of the lack of long-term outcomes. 
The purpose of this study is to elucidate the long-term outcomes of spine 
surgery in dialysis patients, focusing on activities of daily living (ADLs), 
life expectancy, and risk factors for postoperative mortality.
METHODS: Data for 65 dialysis patients who underwent spine surgery at our 
institution and were followed up for a mean duration of 6.2 years were 
retrospectively reviewed. ADLs, number of surgeries, and survival times were 
recorded. The postoperative survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method, and risk factors for postoperative mortality were investigated using a 
generalized Wilcoxon test and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model.
RESULTS: Compared with preoperative ADLs, ADLs significantly improved at 
discharge after surgery and at the final follow-up. However, 16 of the 65 
patients (24.6%) underwent multiple surgeries, and 34 (52.3%) died during the 
follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the survival rate after 
spine surgery was 95.4% at 1 year, 86.2% at 3 years, 69.6% at 5 years, 59.7% at 
7 years, and 28.7% at 10 years, and the overall median survival time was 99 
months. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that a dialysis period of 
≥10 years was a signiﬁcant risk factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Spine surgery in dialysis patients improved and maintained ADLs in 
the long term and did not shorten life expectancy. However, dialysis patients 
undergoing spine surgery require multiple surgeries more frequently, and a 
dialysis period of ≥10 years is a significant risk factor for postoperative 
mortality.

STUDY DESIGN: Economic evaluation study.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the long-term cost-effectiveness of clean 
intermittent catheterization (CIC) compared with suprapubic catheters (SPC) and 
indwelling urethral catheters (UC) among individuals with neurogenic lower 
urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) related to spinal cord injury (SCI) from a 
public healthcare perspective.
SETTING: University affiliated hospital in Montreal, Canada.
METHODS: A Markov model with Monte Carlo simulation was developed with a cycle 
length of 1 year and lifetime horizon to estimate the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Participants were assigned to treatment 
with either CIC or SPC or UC. Transition probabilities, efficacy data, and 
utility values were derived from literature and expert opinion. Costs were 
obtained from provincial health system and hospital data in Canadian Dollars. 
The primary outcome was cost per QALY. Probabilistic and one-way deterministic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: CIC had a lifetime mean total cost of $ 29,161 for 20.91 QALYs. The 
model predicted that a 40-year-old person with SCI would gain an additional 1.77 
QALYs and 1.72 discounted life-years gained if CIC were utilized instead of SPC 
at an incremental cost savings of $330. CIC confer 1.96 QALYs and 3 discounted 
life-years gained compared to UC with an incremental cost savings of $2496. A 
limitation of our analysis is the lack of direct long-term comparisons between 
different catheter modalities.
CONCLUSIONS: CIC appears to be a dominant and more economically attractive 
bladder management strategy for NLUTD compared with SPC and/or UC from the 
public payer perspective over a lifetime horizon.

BACKGROUND: Euthanasia is the last resort for those living with untreatable and 
terminable diseases which cause pain and suffering. However, the concept of 
euthanasia resulted in many dilemmas and controversy around life extension and 
death.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of 
final year pharmacy and law students concerning euthanasia.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among all final 
year law and pharmacy undergraduate students. The data were collected using 
self-administered structured questionnaire and analyzed by SPSS version 22. 
Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the influence of 
socio-demographic characteristics of participant's on acceptance of euthanasia.
RESULT: 72 (61.5%) of the students were declared that euthanasia is 
administration of lethal drugs to a patient at the explicit request of that 
patient. Majority 87 (74.4%) of the students knew that euthanasia is active 
shortening of the dying process. Most participants 95(81.2%) awared that there 
is no legalized euthanasia in Ethiopia. On the other hand, 47(40.2%) believed 
the patient has the right to choose to end his/her own life. Around 45% had the 
view that euthanasia should be legalized in some circumstances. Only 27.3% 
(n = 32) of the respondents endorsed legalization of euthanasia in Ethiopia. 35 
(29.9%) said euthanasia should be performed. The acceptance of euthanasia was 
greater for pharmacy students compared to law students [adjusted odds ratio 
(AOR) = 3.490; 95% CI 1.346-9.049; p = 0.010] and lower for Muslim students 
compared to Orthodox students (AOR = 0.186; 95% CI 0.044-0.783; p = 0.022).
CONCLUSION: The final year law and pharmacy students were aware of euthanasia. 
However, majority of students did not reveal favorable attitude toward 
euthanasia and its acceptance was low. Participants' field of study and religion 
were significantly affect acceptance of euthanasia As the current study limited 
to pharmacy and law students, the authors suggest that future studies should 
involve various segments of societies to investigate more about euthanasia in 
Ethiopia.

Current and Novel Therapeutical Approaches of Classical Homocystinuria in 
Childhood With Special Focus on Enzyme Replacement Therapy, Liver-Directed 
Therapy and Gene Therapy.

Classical homocystinuria is a hereditary defect of the enzyme cystathionine beta 
synthase, which is produced in the liver. If this enzyme fails, the synthesis 
pathway of cysteine from methionine is interrupted, leading to the accumulation 
of homocysteine in the blood plasma and homocysteine in the urine. After birth, 
the children are unremarkable except for the characteristic laboratory findings. 
Symptoms rarely appear before the second year of life. The most common symptom 
is a prolapse of the crystalline lens. This finding is seen in 70% of untreated 
10-year-old affected individuals. As the earliest symptom, psychomotor 
retardation occurs in the majority of patients already during the first two 
years of life. Limiting factors in terms of life expectancy are thromboembolism, 
peripheral arterial disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. These symptoms 
are due to the damage to the vessels caused by the elevated amino acid levels. 
About 30% suffer a thromboembolic event by the age of 20, about half by the age 
of 30. This review focus on present and new therapeutical approaches like the 
role of enzyme replacement with presentation of different novel targets in 
research like pegtibatinase, pegtarviliase, CDX-6512, erymethionase, chaperones, 
proteasome inhibitors and probiotic treatment with SYNB 1353. Furthermore, we 
analyze the role of liver-directed therapy with three dimensional (3D) 
bioprinting, liver bioengineering of liver organoids in vitro and liver 
transplantation. The role of different gene therapy options to treat and cure 
this extremely rare disease in childhood will be discussed.

The complexity of the care environment, the emergent nature, and the severity of 
patient injury make conducting clinical trauma research challenging. These 
challenges hamper the ability to investigate potentially life-saving research 
that aims to deliver pharmacotherapeutics, test medical devices, and develop 
technologies that may improve patient survival and recovery. Regulations 
intended to protect research subjects impede scientific advancements needed to 
treat the critically ill and injured and balancing these regulatory priorities 
is challenging in the acute setting. This scoping review attempted to 
systematically identify what regulations are challenging in conducting trauma 
and emergency research. A systematic search of PubMed was performed to identify 
studies published between 2007 and 2020, from which 289 articles that address 
regulatory challenges in conducting research in emergency settings were 
included. Data were extracted and summarized using descriptive statistics and a 
narrative synthesis of the results. The review is reported in accordance with 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension 
for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Most articles identified were 
editorial/commentary (31%) and published in the USA (49%). Regulatory factors 
addressed in the papers were categorized under 15 regulatory challenge areas: 
informed consent (78%), research ethics (65%), institutional review board (55%), 
human subjects protection (54%), enrollment (53%), exception from informed 
consent (51%), legally authorized representative (50%), patient safety (41%), 
community consultation (40%), waiver of informed consent (40%), recruitment 
challenges (39%), patient perception (30%), liability (15%), participant 
incentives (13%), and common rule (11%). We identified several regulatory 
barriers to conducting trauma and emergency research. This summary will support 
the development of best practices for investigators and funding agencies.

Many fungi live as mycelia, which are networks of hyphae. Mycelial networks are 
suited for the widespread distribution of nutrients and water. The logistical 
capabilities are critical for the extension of fungal survival areas, nutrient 
cycling in ecosystems, mycorrhizal symbioses, and virulence. In addition, signal 
transduction in mycelial networks is predicted to be vital for mycelial function 
and robustness. A lot of cell biological studies have elucidated protein and 
membrane trafficking and signal transduction in fungal hyphae; however, there 
are no reports visualizing signal transduction in mycelia. This paper, by using 
the fluorescent Ca2+ biosensor, visualized for the first time how calcium 
signaling is conducted inside the mycelial network in response to localized 
stimuli in the model fungus Aspergillus nidulans. The wavy propagation of the 
calcium signal inside the mycelium or the signal blinking in the hyphae varies 
depending on the type of stress and proximity to the stress. The signals, 
however, only extended around 1,500 μm, suggesting that the mycelium has a 
localized response. The mycelium showed growth delay only in the stressed areas. 
Local stress caused arrest and resumption of mycelial growth through 
reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking. To elucidate 
the downstream of calcium signaling, calmodulin, and calmodulin-dependent 
protein kinases, the principal intracellular Ca2+ receptors were 
immunoprecipitated and their downstream targets were identified by mass 
spectrometry analyses. Our data provide evidence that the mycelial network, 
which lacks a brain or nervous system, exhibits decentralized response through 
locally activated calcium signaling in response to local stress.

There are few recent and methodologically robust life expectancy (LE) tables for 
dogs or cats. This study aimed to generate LE tables for these species with 
clinical records from >1,000 Banfield Pet hospitals in the USA. Using Sullivan's 
method, LE tables were generated across survey years 2013-2019, by survey year, 
and for subpopulations defined by sex, adult body size group (purebred dogs 
only: toy, small, medium, large and giant), and median body condition score 
(BCS) over life. The deceased population for each survey year comprised animals 
with a recorded date of death in that year; survivors had no death date in that 
year and were confirmed living by a veterinary visit in a subsequent year. The 
dataset totaled 13,292,929 unique dogs and 2,390,078 unique cats. LE at birth 
(LEbirth) was 12.69 years (95% CI: 12.68-12.70) for all dogs, 12.71 years 
(12.67-12.76) for mixed-breed dogs, 11.18 years (11.16-11.20) for cats, and 
11.12 (11.09-11.14) for mixed-breed cats. LEbirth increased with decreasing dog 
size group and increasing survey year 2013 to 2018 for all dog size groups and 
cats. Female dogs and cats had significantly higher LEbirth than males: 12.76 
years (12.75-12.77) vs. 12.63 years (12.62-12.64), and 11.68 years (11.65-11.71) 
vs. 10.72 years (10.68-10.75), respectively. Obese dogs (BCS 5/5) had a 
significantly lower LEbirth [11.71 years (11.66-11.77)] than overweight dogs 
(BCS 4/5) [13.14 years (13.12-13.16)] and dogs with ideal BCS 3/5 [13.18 years 
(13.16-13.19)]. The LEbirth of cats with BCS 4/5 [13.67 years (13.62-13.71)] was 
significantly higher than cats with BCS 5/5 [12.56 years (12.45-12.66)] or BCS 
3/5 [12.18 years (12.14-12.21)]. These LE tables provide valuable information 
for veterinarians and pet owners and a foundation for research hypotheses, as 
well as being a stepping-stone to disease-associated LE tables.
