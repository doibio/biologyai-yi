INTRODUCTION: Brain metastases (BM) are associated with dismal prognosis as they 
cause significant morbidity and affect the quality of life of patients. 
Management of BM depends on the following factors: age, patient performance, 
size and the number of lesions, location of the tumor, comorbidities, primary 
tumor type, and extracranial disease burden. In the present study, the pattern 
of occurrence, clinical characteristics, treatment outcome of brain metastases, 
and factors, tumor characteristics, and treatment that may impact BM patients' 
overall survival were analyzed.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical records of 116 patients with 
histologically proven primary site solid tumors with brain metastases was done 
in the present study. Clinicoradiological and pathological parameters were 
documented. The relationship between variables and outcome was assessed by 
univariate analysis using the Cox proportional regression model to reach a 
significance of p < 0.05, to determine independent predictors of overall 
survival.
RESULTS: One hundred sixteen patients of BM from various solid malignancies were 
included. Age ranged from 18 to 81 years (median 53.5). One hundred four 
patients received WBRT with a dose range of 8-40Gy/1-15fr, 7 received SRS with a 
dose of 18-24Gy depending on the size of the metastatic lesion, and 2 received 
SRT 27-33Gy/3fr. At the time of final analysis, 47 patients with BM had expired, 
60 were lost to follow-up, and 9 were alive. Median survival was 8.25 (0.5-32.5 
months) months. Female gender (χ2 = 8.423; p = 0.015), RPA I (χ2 = 9.353; p = 
0.05), and metachronous BM (χ2 = 3.793; p = 0.03) were associated with better 
survival. Patients with age 41-50 years, adenocarcinoma lung histology, and 
supratentorial location survived more than 2 years but did not show any 
statistical significance.
CONCLUSION: Brain metastases portend a very dismal prognosis. Certain 
clinicoradiological and pathologic factors have been identified to affect 
survival. More prospective multicentric trials, with a larger sample size, need 
to be conducted to assess the benefit of radiation in patients with limited life 
expectancy and identify prognostic and predictive factors for survival.

The aim was to illuminate the difference in incidence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of gastric cancer (GC) between the United 
States of America (US) and China. The multiple management was analyzed with 
stratification to explore an effective survival improvement strategy. The Global 
Burden of Disease Study data was analyzed to assess GC morbidity, mortality and 
DALYs from 1990 to 2019 in the US and China. The age-period-cohort model was 
established to generate estimation of metrics. Verification was completed and 
stratified analysis of the multiple management was performed by accessing data 
of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database in 1992 to 2019. 
Continuous downtrends in GC incidence, mortality and DALYs from 1990 to 2019 and 
persistent uptrends in 1-, 3-year survival from 1992 to 2019 were observed in 
the US population. In the Chinese population, the overall trends of incidence, 
mortality and DALYs decreased with a fluctuating manner. The lower overall 
survival rates were observed in elderly, unmarried patients, distant disease and 
poor grade, as well as patients lacking of medical treatment (P < .05). In 
stratified analyses, single local therapy decreased and the other modalities 
increased over time across different stages. Moreover, combined treatment and 
single systemic therapy decreased, but single local and conservative therapy 
increased with age. The study quantified the incidence, GC-specific mortality 
and DALYs in the US and China and estimated stage profiles, 1- and 3-year 
survival in the US. The heavy burden on later-onset GC (>70) and potential 
increase on early-onset GC (<40) needed to be addressed. Combined modalities and 
single chemotherapy were becoming more widely used over time, however, their 
uses decreased with age because of poor physical fitness. Our findings provide 
new insights into management tailoring appropriately to specific subgroups 
contributes to the increasing survival rate.

BACKGROUND: Population aging refers to the increase in number and percentage of 
older population aged 60 yr and above, and at the same time, decreasing in 
number and percentage of the young population aged 15 yr old and below. Starting 
in developed countries, population aging has now become a distinctive 
demographic phenomenon in developing countries. Nowadays developing countries 
have become the home to the largest proportion of older people in the world. 
This paper aimed to analyze the impact of population aging in Malaysia.
METHODS: We employed a secondary data analysis related to the impact of 
population aging in Malaysia. In analyzing the data, the paper detailed, 
segmented, coded and, formulated the text into themes through a thematic 
approach. The themes that emerged from the data were family changes, migration 
of youth, support and care, health problems, financial security as well as 
housing problems. These emerged themes mapped the shared patterns of the impacts 
of the population aging.
RESULTS: With the increasing of the older population in Malaysia, there are 
various impacts of population aging emerged, particularly in terms of family 
changes, youth migration to cities, support and care, health, financial security 
and housing. The discussion in this article is revolved around these impacts.
CONCLUSION: The growth of older people and the impact emerging from it has 
certain policy implications for the government of the country. Thus, the 
government needs to prepare for adequate policies and resources for future older 
people.

BACKGROUND: The Ayurveda therapy is often used as an adjunct to conventional 
allopathic treatments for management of chronic disorders including life 
threatening infections such as post COVID-19 Mucormycosis (PCM).
AIMS/OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study is to evaluate the role of adjunct 
Ayurveda therapy (AAT + CAT) over conventional Allopathic therapy (CAT) in the 
prevention of progression of oral/orbital/neural extension of PCM.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A non-randomised parallel group interventional study was 
on a sample of 92 cases of PCM, sorted into two groups i.e. group A (n = 46; 
AAT + CAT) and group B (n = 46; CAT/controls). The group A received AAT 
(lab-tested standardised regimen) while simultaneously receiving conventional 
antifungal measures (or CAT). The outcomes assessed were clinical symptomatic 
grading score, Nasal endoscopic examination for patency of sinuses, Progression 
or extension of disease from sinuses to maxilla, orbit and brain, need of 
additional surgical interventions and antifungal medication after study period, 
adverse drug reactions and mortality.
RESULTS: The group A (AAT + CAT)) had shown extension free PCM in 86.96% 
(n = 40) as opposed to 41.3% (n = 19) in group B (CAT), No surgical 
interventions were needed in 89.13% (n = 41) in group A vs. 60.87% (n = 28) in 
group B. Around 69.5% (n = 32) in group A vs. 4.37% (n = 2) in group B did not 
need antifungal medication. The safety of both arms of the therapy has been 
determined by liver function and renal profile which are with in normal range in 
both groups.
CONCLUSION: Adjunct Ayurveda therapy (given along with routine medical therapy) 
for PCM showed a better cure and reduced disease progression after a trial 
period of 45 days and in the extended observational period of three months. 
AAT + CAT regimen is not only therapeutically effective, but also safe and 
economical option to consider for PCM.

Nature has evolved a variety of mechanisms to build epithelial trees of diverse 
architectures within different organs and across species. Epithelial trees are 
elaborated through branch initiation and extension, and their morphogenesis ends 
with branch termination. Each of these steps of the branching process can be 
driven by the actions of epithelial cells themselves (epithelial-intrinsic 
mechanisms) or by the cells of their surrounding tissues (epithelial-extrinsic 
mechanisms). Here, we describe examples of how these mechanisms drive each stage 
of branching morphogenesis, drawing primarily from studies of the lung, kidney, 
salivary gland, mammary gland, and pancreas, all of which contain epithelial 
trees that form through collective cell behaviors. Much of our understanding of 
epithelial branching comes from experiments using mice, but we also include 
examples here from avian and reptilian models. Throughout, we highlight how 
distinct mechanisms are employed in different organs and species to build 
epithelial trees. We also highlight how similar morphogenetic motifs are used to 
carry out conserved developmental programs or repurposed to support novel ones. 
Understanding the unique strategies used by nature to build branched epithelia 
from across the tree of life can help to inspire creative solutions to problems 
in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of surgical 
fixation with Kirschner (K-)wire ersus moulded casting after manipulation of a 
fracture of the distal radius in an operating theatre setting.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted based on data collected from the 
Distal Radius Acute Fracture Fixation Trial 2 (DRAFFT2) multicentre randomized 
controlled trial in the UK. Resource use was collected at three, six, and 12 
months post-randomization using trial case report forms and 
participant-completed questionnaires. Cost-effectiveness was reported in terms 
of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from an NHS and 
personal social services perspective. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
examine the robustness of cost-effectiveness estimates, and decision uncertainty 
was handled using confidence ellipses and cost-effectiveness acceptability 
curves.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, surgical fixation with K-wire was more 
expensive (£29.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) -94.85 to 154.15)) and generated 
lower QALYs (0.007 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.016)) than moulded casting, but this 
difference was not statistically significant. The probability of K-wire being 
cost-effective at a £20,000 per QALY cost-effectiveness threshold was 24%. The 
cost-effectiveness results remained robust in the sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that surgical fixation with K-wire is unlikely 
to be a cost-effective alternative to a moulded cast in adults, following 
manipulation of a fracture of the distal radius in a theatre setting.Cite this

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate health-adjusted life expectancy 
(HALE) by demographic characteristics (sex, educational achievement, and 
residential area) according to the lifestyle classifications of the Yonsei 
Lifestyle Profile-BREF (YLP-BREF).
METHODS: This study included 569 participants aged 55 years or older living in 
Korea. The YLP-BREF domains were physical activity, activity participation, and 
nutrition.
RESULTS: Females had a longer HALE (mean±standard deviation, 8.90±5.06 years) in 
the physical activity domain, while males had a longer HALE in the nutrition 
domain (9.44±5.91 years). People living in rural areas had longer HALE in 
physical activity (12.02±5.60 years), activity participation (8.58±4.21 years), 
and nutrition (11.33±6.43 years). There were no significant differences 
according to sex or residential area. High school graduates showed the longest 
HALE (physical activity: 10.38± 6.89; activity participation: 7.64±4.29; 
nutrition: 9.59±6.40 years). There was a significant difference in educational 
achievement.
CONCLUSIONS: As people age, the demand for a healthy lifestyle increases. This 
study attempted to calculate HALE by demographic characteristics according to 
lifestyle. The results of this study will help inform future research directions 
for providing a healthy lifestyle.

China.

Background: Lateral lymph node (LLN) metastasis is a poor prognostic factor for 
rectal cancer patients. However, the effect of LLNs without malignant 
characteristics on the prognosis of rectal cancer patients has been uncertain. 
Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic-assisted low anterior 
resection were included. Patients with MRI-detected LLNs, but without malignant 
characteristics, were compared with patients with no MRI-detected LLNs. Results: 
The local recurrence rate was higher in the LLN-present group than in the 
LLN-absent group (9.8% vs 2.5%; p = 0.056). The overall survival of patients 
with no MRI-detected LLNs was significantly better than that of patients with 
MRI-detected LLNs (p = 0.021). Conclusion: The presence of LLNs, even without 
malignant features, may lead to worse local control and overall survival.

Plain Language Summary: Lymph node metastasis in the pelvic sidewall of patients 
with rectal cancer is a serious disease that affects the patient's life 
expectancy. At present, the assessment of lateral lymph node (LLN) metastasis 
relies mainly on MRI. Currently, there is no consensus on whether small lymph 
nodes without malignant features detected by MRI affect patient prognosis. 
Therefore, the authors designed this study to compare the survival of patients 
with small LLNs detected by MRI with that of patients without LLNs. The authors 
found that the presence of LLNs, even without malignant features, may lead to 
worse local control and overall survival. Therefore, for patients with 
MRI-detected LLNs, LLN dissection should be conducted by experienced surgeons to 
improve patient prognosis.

Regina Elena 324, 00161, Rome, Italy. tiziana.filardi@uniroma1.it.

PURPOSE: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease which leads to high 
morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Although relevant gains have been 
made towards evidence-based diabetes care, patients with T2D still experience 
diabetes complications and excess mortality risk, owing to multiple 
contributors, including non-clinical factors. The aim of this paper is to 
provide an overview of the main social determinants of vulnerabilities, which 
are known to have a relevant impact on T2D outcomes.
RESULTS: As chronic diseases are under the influence of social inequalities, 
medicine and sociology are intertwined in the attempt to understand, explain and 
address them. There is robust evidence about a clear relationship between social 
determinants of health (SDOH), such as socio-economic status (occupation, 
education, income), and the likelihood of developing T2D and its complications. 
Furthermore, the uncontrolled widespread of T2D in urban areas, mainly among 
suburban communities, suggests that cities might act as amplifiers of SDOH, 
enhancing inequalities in health care and, therefore, life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: In light of the strong association between socio-cultural aspects 
and T2D outcomes, a global action is needed to raise awareness about disparities 
in diabetes prevention and treatment to reduce the burden of the disease.

The sluggish progress concerning SDG-9 and SDG 13 has made South Asia an 
epicentre of household and ambient greenhouse gases emissions. Furthermore, the 
regional progress concerning attainment of SDG-3 is considerably low. The major 
research objectives are twofold. First, to explore the impact of GHGs emissions 
from agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing sector on disaggregated life 
expectancy. Second, to examine the mitigating impact of renewable energy use, 
trade integration, and human capital development for practice policy 
recommendations. These research objectives are realized by employing recently 
advanced cross-sectional auto regressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) model on 
panel data of five South Asian countries such as Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, 
Nepal, and Sri Lanka from 1990 to 2019. The estimation outcome reveals that the 
emissions from transportation, manufacturing, and agricultural sectors 
significantly deteriorate healthy life expectancy of male and female healthy 
life expectancy in South Asia with different intensity. Especially, we find that 
long-run impact of GHG is more profound on male healthy life expectancy than 
female life expectancy. The result further shows that renewable energy and human 
capital substantially improve healthy life expectancy, whereas the effects of 
trade integration are insignificant. The finding of moderating variables shows 
that renewable energy, human capital development, and trade integration have 
high potential to reduce GHGs emissions. The findings of this study urge South 
Asia for investments in human capital development and renewable energy along 
with fostering regional integration to decrease GHG and improve healthy life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) has risen as a global 
issue of public health, with an in-creasing prevalence and more severe clinical 
prognosis. This study aimed to estimate the association between use of fish oil 
and mortality among patients with CMM.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective study based on UK Biobank, participants 
with ≥2 of cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs, including coronary heart disease 
[CHD], diabetes, hypertension, and stroke in this study) at recruitment were 
included. Use of fish oil was derived from touchscreen questionnaires at 
baseline. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were accessed via electronic 
health-related records. Kaplan-Meier curves and flexible parametric 
Royston-Parmar proportion-hazard models were fitted to assess the as-sociations 
of fish-oil use with all-cause, cardiovascular mortality, and related life 
expectancy alterations. Among 30 068 participants from UK Biobank (67.9% men; 
mean age 61.75 years), 5357 deaths were reported during 12.03 years of 
follow-up. For patients with CMM, use of fish oil was associated with a 17% 
lower risk of all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.78-0.88, 
P < 0.001), and 19% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality (95% CI 0.72-0.90, 
P < 0.001) in multivariable-adjusted models. At 45 years old, using fish oil was 
associated with 1.66 years of life expectancy gained.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with CMM, use of fish oil was associated with a 
significantly reduced risk of all-cause, cardiovascular mortality, and prolonged 
life expectancy.

The pH-selective interaction between the immunoglobulin G (IgG) fragment 
crystallizable region (Fc region) and the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is 
critical for prolonging the circulating half-lives of IgG molecules through 
intracellular trafficking and recycling. By using directed evolution, we 
successfully identified Fc mutations that improve the pH-dependent binding of 
human FcRn and prolong the serum persistence of a model IgG antibody and an 
Fc-fusion protein. Strikingly, trastuzumab-PFc29 and aflibercept-PFc29, a model 
therapeutic IgG antibody and an Fc-fusion protein, respectively, when combined 
with our engineered Fc (Q311R/M428L), both exhibited significantly higher serum 
half-lives in human FcRn transgenic mice than their counterparts with wild-type 
Fc. Moreover, in a cynomolgus monkey model, trastuzumab-PFc29 displayed a 
superior pharmacokinetic profile to that of both trastuzumab-YTE and 
trastuzumab-LS, which contain the well-validated serum half-life extension Fcs 
YTE (M252Y/S254T/T256E) and LS (M428L/N434S), respectively. Furthermore, the 
introduction of two identified mutations of PFc29 (Q311R/M428L) into the model 
antibodies enhanced both complement-dependent cytotoxicity and 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity, which are triggered by 
the association between IgG Fc and Fc binding ligands and are critical for 
clearing cancer cells. In addition, the effector functions could be turned off 
by combining the two mutations of PFc29 with effector function-silencing 
mutations, but the antibodies maintained their excellent pH-dependent human FcRn 
binding profile. We expect our Fc variants to be an excellent tool for enhancing 
the pharmacokinetic profiles and potencies of various therapeutic antibodies and 
Fc-fusion proteins.

BACKGROUND: The sterile insect technique (SIT), which involves area-wide 
inundative releases of sterile insects to suppress the reproduction of a target 
species, has proven to be an effective pest control method. The technique 
demands the continuous release of sterilized insects in quantities that ensure a 
high sterile male:wild male ratio for the suppression of the wild population 
over succeeding generations.
METHODS: For these releases, it is important to determine several ecological and 
biological population parameters, including the longevity of the released males 
in the field, the dispersal of the released males and the wild pest population 
size. The Lee County Mosquito Control District initiated a study in a 47-ha 
portion of Captiva Island (Florida, USA), an island with a total area of 230 ha, 
to define biological SIT parameters for Aedes aegypti (L.), an invasive 
disease-vectoring mosquito known to be difficult to control due to a combination 
of daytime biting activity, use of cryptic breeding habitats that are difficult 
to target with conventional night-time ultra-low volume methods, and emerging 
resistance to commonly used insecticides. Another goal was to assess patterns of 
dispersal and survival for laboratory-reared sterile Ae. aegypti males released 
over time in the pilot site. These parameters will be used to evaluate the 
efficacy of a SIT suppression program for Ae. aegypti on Captiva Island.
RESULTS: Over the course of seven mark-release-recapture studies using single- 
and multiple-point releases, 190,504 sterile marked males were released, for 
which the recapture rate was 1.5% over a mean period of 12 days. The mean 
distance traveled by sterile males of the local strain of Ae. aegypti that has 
colonized Captiva Island was 201.7 m from the release point, with an observed 
maximum traveled distance of 404.5 m. The released sterile mosquitoes had a 
probability of daily survival of 0.67 and an average life expectancy 
of ~ 2.46 days.
CONCLUSIONS: These data together with the population size estimate and 
sterile:wild ratio provide a solid basis for planning the SIT operational phase 
which is aimed at mosquito population suppression.

BACKGROUND: Despite the gain in life expectancy that people living with HIV 
(PLHIV) have had in the past few years, the disease is accompanied by an 
increase in the prevalence of noninfectious chronic diseases. PLHIV have a 
higher prevalence of osteoporosis, fracture, diabetes mellitus, and insulin 
resistance than the general population. It is unknown if insulin resistance is 
associated with osteoporosis and fractures in PLHIV. Our study aimed to assess 
the association between insulin resistance and osteoporosis in PLHIV.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in southern Brazil. PLHIV ages 
50 years or older on antiretroviral treatment were included. Insulin resistance 
was considered present when the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin 
Resistance (HOMA-IR) was higher than expected for the Brazilian population 
(>2.7). The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index was also calculated.
RESULTS: Of the 101 PLHIV who agreed to participate, 84 underwent insulin and 
bone mineral density measurements. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 19%. The 
frequency of insulin resistance calculated by HOMA-IR was 68.2%. Participants 
with osteoporosis had lower body mass index (BMI) and triglyceride values than 
those without it. HOMA-IR [4.8(6.6) vs 8.68(9.6), P = 0.013] and TyG [5.0(0.3) 
vs 5.2 (0.4), P = 0.029]. The association between the total femur t-score 
disappeared after correction for BMI in the linear regression model. There was 
no association between vertebral fractures and insulin resistance.
CONCLUSION: In our study, PLHIV with osteoporosis have lower insulin resistance 
than PLHIV without it. However, this finding appears to be related to lower BMI. 
The association between insulin resistance and bone in PLHIV appears to be 
somewhat similar to that of the general population.

Synthetic glycoconjugates are used in the development of vaccines and the design 
of inhibitors for glycan-protein interactions. The in vivo persistence of 
synthetic glycoconjugates is an important factor in their efficacy, especially 
when prolonged interactions with specific cell types may be required. In this 
study, we applied a strategy for non-covalent association of an active compound 
with serum proteins for extension of glycoconjugate half-life in serum. The 
small molecule, AG10, has previously been used to extend the half-life of small 
molecules through its high affinity for transthyretin (TTR), a serum protein. 
Using a tetravalent polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based scaffold we developed a 
synthetic strategy for glycoconjugates that allowed for controlled addition of 
multiple tags, such as a TTR affinity tag or fluorophore. We designed a version 
of AG10 modified at the pyrazole core, named GD10, amenable to our conjugation 
strategy and introduced to glycoconjugates using a tri-functional linker. This 
approach allowed for attachment of GD10 and fluorophore tags, as well as 
carbohydrate antigens. We then tested the influence of the GD10 tag on 
glycoconjugate half-life in vivo using a mouse model. Our results suggest that 
the combination of the GD10 tag and the PEG scaffold extended the half-life of 
glycoconjugates by as much as 10-fold when compared to proteins of similar 
molecular weight. The GD10 tag was able to extend the half-life of similar 
glycoconjugates by as much as 2-fold. We observed a role for the terminal 
saccharide residue of the carbohydrate antigen and confirmed that conjugates 
were able to penetrate multiple compartments in vivo including bone marrow, 
lymph nodes, and other organs. The introduction of the GD10 tag did not obstruct 
the ability of conjugates to interact with lectin receptors. We conclude that 
serum protein binders can be used to extend the persistence of glycoconjugates 
in vivo.

BACKGROUND: The elderly have an increased risk of developing visual impairment 
(VI). Due to the increase in life expectancy of individuals in Sub-Saharan 
Africa, the population of the elderly is projected to increase. It is thus 
postulated that the prevalence of VI will increase which is currently unknown in 
Uganda.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and risk factors for VI among the elderly 
at Mulago National Referral Hospital eye clinic in Uganda.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in 2020 with consecutive 
enrolment of patients aged 60 years and above. Obtaining history was followed by 
systemic and ocular examination. Statistical analysis was performed to determine 
the prevalence and factors associated with VI.
RESULTS: Of 346 elderly participants examined, 174 (50.3%) were males and median 
age was 67 (IQR 63-74). Prevalence of VI was 32.1%. Cataract was the leading 
cause of blindness 54.1%, followed by refractive error (21.6%), glaucoma 
(11.7%), and corneal opacities (5.4%). Age (adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR): 
1.05, 95% CI (1.02, 1.06)), history of diabetes mellitus (aPR 1.46, 95%CI (1.04, 
2.05)), history of hypertension (aPR 1.46, 95%CI (1.10, 1.93)), having completed 
primary level of education (aPR 0.74, 95%CI (0.55, 0.98)) and secondary level of 
education (aPR 0.47, 95%CI (0.30,0.73)), presence of a cataract at examination 
(aPR: 2.28, 95%CI (1.66, 3.13)) were statistically significantly associated with 
VI.
CONCLUSION: In Mulago hospital, the prevalence of VI among the elderly is high 
with majority of the causes being correctable. We recommend that efforts towards 
early case identification of causes of VI among the elderly should be a 
priority.

With the topical focus on the prevention of and countermeasures for frailty, 
scattered studies have subdivided its social elements and aspects as "social 
frailty." While the concepts and definition of "social frailty" are yet to be 
established, the purpose of using the term is to capture the attention of 
professionals using the social aspects of frailty to support older adults. The 
goal is to increase healthy life expectancy by recognizing that social factors 
are unlikely to pose a risk of functional decline in isolation, but may increase 
such a decline when combined with other factors. At feasible scopes of 
intervention, ways to address these factors should be pursued. Although social 
aspects are often expressed by frail people, or social factors with complex 
processes that can cause functional decline, there is no unified definition or 
indicator of social frailty. Further research and discussion are needed to 
clarify its academic significance and usefulness for disability prevention. 
Recognizing this, when the Japanese Socio-Gerontological Society's Study 
Committee on "Social Frailty" published its recommendations, it suggested that 
when using the term "social frailty" we should specify the significance of its 
use; consider the comprehensiveness of frailty; be mindful of the 
interrelationship of social activities and other social aspects; and consider 
environmental conditions such as a person's values, preferences and life course, 
social norms, systems, and government policies. High-risk individuals may need 
multidisciplinary approaches delivered by various professionals, including 
clinicians, in realizing a life in line with their unique values and 
preferences. In such cases, it is necessary to understand the background and 
process that led to frailty, from physical, psychological, and social 
perspectives, referring to the abovementioned four points. The introduction of 
social aspects as one of the assessment frameworks can significantly bridge the 
gap between medical care and the community. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2022; 22:

Electron Impact Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (EI-GC-MS) and High 
Resolution Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HR-LC-MS) have been used in 
the analysis of products arising from the trichloroethoxycarbonylation of 
fentanyl and acetylfentanyl in urine and plasma matrices. The method involves 
the initial extraction of both synthetic opioids separately from the matrices 
followed by detection of the unique products that arise from their reaction with 
2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl chloride (Troc-Cl), namely Troc-norfentanyl and 
Troc-noracetylfentanyl. The optimized protocol was successfully evaluated for 
its efficacy at detecting these species formed from fentanyl and acetylfentanyl 
when present at low and high levels in urine (fentanyl: 5 and 10 ng/mL and 
acetylfentanyl: 20 and 100 ng/mL) and plasma (fentanyl: 10 and 20 ng/mL and 
acetylfentanyl: 50 and 200 ng/mL), values that reflect levels reported in 
overdose victims. The HR-LC-MS method's LOQ (limit of quantitation) for the 
Troc-norfentanyl and Troc-noracetylfentanyl products was determined to be ~10 
ng/mL for both species. Even though the superiority in the detection of these 
species by HR-LC-MS over EI-GC-MS, the latter method proved to be important in 
the detection of the second product from the reaction, namely 2-phenylethyl 
chloride that is crucial in the determination of the original opioid. This 
observation highlights the importance of using complimentary analytical 
techniques in the analysis of a sample, whether biological or environmental in 
nature. The method herein serves as a complementary, qualitative confirmation 
for the presence of a fentanyl in collected urine, plasma and by extension other 
biological samples amenable to the common extraction procedures described for 
opioid analysis. More importantly, the method's main strength comes from its 
ability to react with unknown fentanyls to yield products that can be not only 
detected by EI-GC-MS and HR-LC-MS but can then be used to retrospectively 
identify an unknown fentanyl.

Accurately counting the human cost of the COVID-19 at both the national and 
regional level is a policy priority. The Russian Federation currently reports 
one of the higher COVID-19 mortality rates in the world; but estimates of 
mortality differ significantly. Using a statistical method accounting for 
changes in the population age structure, we present the first national and 
regional estimates of excess mortality for 2021; calculations of excess 
mortality by age, gender, and urban/rural status for 2020; and mean remaining 
years of life expectancy lost at the regional level. We estimate that there were 
351,158 excess deaths in 2020 and 678,022 in 2021 in the Russian Federation; 
and, in 2020, around 2.0 years of life expectancy lost. While the Russian 
Federation exhibits very high levels of excess mortality compared to other 
countries, there is a wide degree of regional variation: in 2021, excess deaths 
expressed as a percentage of expected deaths at the regional level range from 
27% to 52%. Life expectancy loss is generally greater for males; while excess 
mortality is greater in urban areas. For Russia as whole, an average person who 
died due to the pandemic in 2020 would have otherwise lived for a further 14 
more years (and as high as 18 years in some regions), disproving the widely held 
view that excess mortality during the pandemic period was concentrated among 
those with few years of life remaining-especially for females. At a regional 
level, less densely populated, more remote regions, rural regions appear to have 
fared better regarding excess mortality and life expectancy loss-however, a part 
of this differential could be owing to measurement issues. The calculations 
demonstrate more clearly the true degree of the human cost of the pandemic in 
the Russian Federation.
