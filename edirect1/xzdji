BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia is an important age-related disease which 
can lead to an increased risk of mortality, falls, fractures, and poor quality 
of life. So, timely detection can be effective in reducing the burden of 
disease. The aim of this study was to identify the most cost-effective strategy 
for sarcopenia screening in Iran.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov transition model over a life-time 
horizon based on natural history. Compared strategies included Sarcopenia 
scoring assessment models (SarSA-Mod), European working group on sarcopenia in 
older people (EWGSOP), Mini sarcopenia risk assessment (MSRA) and SARC-F. 
Parameters values were extracted from primary data and the literature, and the 
costs and Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated for each strategy. 
Sensitivity analysis of uncertain parameters was also performed to determine the 
robustness of the model. Analysis was performed using 2020 version of TreeAge 
Pro software.
RESULTS: All four screening strategies increased life time QALYs. After removing 
dominated strategy, the incremental cost per QALY gained for sarcopenia 
screening varied from $1875.67 for EWGSOP to $1898.33 for MSRA. Our base-case 
analysis showed that the most cost-effective strategy was EWGSOP and 2nd best 
was SarSA-Mod with $43,414.3 and $42,663.3 net monetary benefits given one GDP 
per capita ($5520.311) as willingness to pay, respectively. Sensitivity analysis 
of model parameters also showed robustness of results.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study, as the first economic evaluation of 
sarcopenia screening, showed that the EWGSOP strategy is more cost-effective 
than other strategies.

OBJECTIVES: Currently, there are no approved treatments for early disease stages 
of COVID-19 and few strategies to prevent disease progression after infection 
with SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) or camostat mesylate administered within 
72 h of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult individuals with pre-existing 
risk factors at higher risk of getting seriously ill with COVID-19. Camostat 
mesylate acts as an inhibitor of the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2 and 
prevents the virus from entering the cell. CP represents another antiviral 
strategy in terms of passive immunization. The working hypothesis to be tested 
in the RES-Q-HR study is that the early use of CP or camostat mesylate reduces 
the likelihood of disease progression to (modified) WHO stages 4b-8 in 
SARS-CoV-2-positive adult patients at high risk of moderate or severe COVID-19 
progression.
TRIAL DESIGN: This study is a 4-arm (parallel group), multicenter, randomized 
(2:2:1:1 ratio), partly double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) or camostat mesylate with control or 
placebo in adult patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and high risk for 
progression to moderate/severe COVID-19. Superiority of the intervention arms 
will be tested.
PARTICIPANTS: The trial is conducted at 10-15 tertiary care centers in Germany. 
Individuals aged 18 years or above with ability to provide written informed 
consent with SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by PCR within 3 days or less before 
enrolment and the presence of at least one SARS-CoV-2 symptom (such as fever, 
cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, fatigue, smell/and or taste 
disorder, diarrhea, abdominal symptoms, exanthema) and symptom duration of not 
more than 3 days. Further inclusion criteria comprise: Presence of at least one

convalescent plasma for COVID-19 23. Concomitant proven influenza A infection 
24. Patients with organ or bone marrow transplant in the three months prior to 
screening visit INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomized to 
the following 4 groups: 1) Convalescent plasma (CP), 2 units at 
screening/baseline visit (day 0) or day 1; CP is defined by the presence of 
neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with titers ≥ 1:160; individuals with 
body weight ≥ 150 kg will receive a third unit of plasma on day 3 2) Camostat 
mesylate (200 mg per capsule, one capsule taken each in the morning, afternoon 
and evening on days 1-7) 3) Standard of care (SOC, control for CP) 4) Placebo 
(identical in appearance to camostat mesylate capsules, one capsule taken each 
morning, afternoon and evening on days 1-7; for camostat mesylate control group) 
Participants will be monitored after screening/baseline on day 3, day 5, day 8, 
and day 14. On day 28 and day 56, telephone visits and on day 90, another 
outpatient visit are scheduled. Adverse events and serious adverse events will 
be monitored and reported until the end of the study. An independent data safety 
monitoring committee will review trial progression and safety.
MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint of the study is the cumulative number of 
individuals who progress to or beyond category 4b on the modified WHO COVID-19 
ordinal scale (defined as hospitalization with COVID-19 pneumonia and additional 
oxygen demand via nasal cannula or mask) within 28 days after randomization.
RANDOMIZATION: Participants will be randomized using the Alea-Tool ( 
aleaclinical.com ) in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to the treatment arms (1) CP, (2) camostat 
mesylate, (3) standard of care (SoC), and (4) placebo matching camostat 
mesylate. Randomization will be stratified by study center.
BLINDING (MASKING): The camostat mesylate treatment arm and the respective 
placebo will be blinded for participants, caregivers, and those assessing 
outcomes. The treatment arms convalescent plasma and standard of care will not 
be blinded and thus are open-labeled, unblinded.
NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): Overall, n = 994 participants will be 
randomized to the following groups: n = 331 to convalescent plasma (CP), n = 331 
to camostat mesylate, n = 166 to standard of care (SoC), and n = 166 to placebo 
matching camostat mesylate.
TRIAL STATUS: The RES-Q-HR protocol (V04F) was approved on the 18 December 2020 
by the local ethics committee and by the regulatory institutions PEI/BfARM on 
the 2 December 2020. The trial was opened for recruitment on 26 December 2020;

BACKGROUND: Depression is a highly prevalent mental disorder with major public 
health effects globally. It impairs the quality of life and reduces the ability 
to work and function, leading to increasing costs of sick leaves and disability 
pensions. Current treatment strategies focus on biological and psychological 
pathways while understating the role of lifestyle factors. Epidemiological 
studies have shown convincing evidence of an inverse relationship between diet 
quality and depression. However, only limited data are available on the 
therapeutic effects of diet quality improvement on depression. Using a 
randomized controlled trial design, our primary aim is to investigate the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a behavioral nutrition group 
intervention compared to a social support intervention in the treatment of 
depression.
METHODS: Participants (N=144, aged 20-65 years) with a diagnosis of moderate or 
severe depression recruited in collaboration with outpatient care units will be 
randomized into two arms: Food for Mind (FM) nutrition intervention (n=72) or 
Bring Good Mood (BGM) social support control group (n=72). Both arms will be 
provided with 6 group sessions over an 8-week period. FM involves improving diet 
quality by applying strength-based behavioral nutrition counseling and 
activities facilitated by a registered dietitian. The control arm comprises a 
befriending protocol. During the interventions, all participants will continue 
their treatment for depression as usual. Longitudinal data are collected at 
baseline, at 8 weeks, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Depressive symptoms, 
diet quality, eating behavior, ability to work and function, and quality of life 
are assessed by self-reported questionnaires. A treatment expectancy 
questionnaire will be administered at baseline and an acceptability 
questionnaire at 8 weeks. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale 
is used as the primary endpoint at 1 year. The results will be analyzed with 
linear mixed-effects models. Economic evaluation includes both 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis. Two incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios will be calculated to evaluate the incremental cost per QALY and the 
incremental cost per improvement in CES-D.
DISCUSSION: If the intervention proves to be cost-effective and acceptable, it 
be can be implemented in healthcare to support the treatment of depression.

Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 were used to report the burden 
of migraine in 204 countries and territories during the period 1990 to 2019, 
through a systematic analysis of point prevalence, annual incidence, and years 
lived with disability (YLD). In 2019, the global age-standardised point 
prevalence and annual incidence rate of migraine were 14,107.3 (95% Uncertainty 
Interval [UI] 12,270.3-16,239) and 1142.5 (95% UI 995.9-1289.4) per 100,000, an 
increase of 1.7% (95% UI 0.7%-2.8%) and 2.1% (95% UI 1.1%-2.8%) since 1990, 
respectively. Moreover, the global age-standardised YLD rate in 2019 was 525.5 
(95% UI 78.8-1194), an increase of 1.5% (95% UI -4.4% to 3.3%) since 1990. The 
global point prevalence of migraine in 2019 was higher in females and increased 
by age up to the 40 to 44 age group, then decreased with increased age. Belgium 
(22,400.6 [95% UI: 19,305.2-26,215.8]), Italy (20,337.7 [95% UI: 
17,724.7-23,405.8]), and Germany (19,436.4 [95% UI: 16,806.2-22,810.3]) had the 
3 highest age-standardised point prevalence rates for migraine in 2019. In 
conclusion, there were large intercountry differences in the burden of migraine, 
and this burden increased significantly across the measurement period. These 
findings suggest that migraine care needs to be included within the health 
system to increase population awareness regarding the probable risk factors and 
treatment strategies especially among young adults and middle-aged women, as 
well as to increase the data on migraines.

C-terminal peptidase (Ctp) cleaves the C-terminal extension of the D1 precursor 
(pD1) to form mature D1. Among the three homologs CtpA, CtpB, and CtpC in 
photosynthetic organisms only the first is capable of processing pD1 while the 
roles of CtpB and CtpC remain elusive. Phylogenetic analysis of Ctps from 
photosynthetic organisms revealed that CtpA has diverged early from CtpB and 
CtpC during evolution implying distinct roles for the Ctps. Analysis of 
Arabidopsis Ctp-deficient mutants revealed that pD1 processing was not affected 
in atctpb, atctpc, or atctpbatctpc mutants, demonstrating that AtCtpA, not 
AtCtpB or AtCtpC, is responsible for cleaving the pD1 C-terminal extension. 
Ectopic expression of CtpAs from Synechococcus elongatus, Chlamydomonas 
reinhardtii, and Physcomitrella patens in atctpa rescued the lethal phenotype of 
the mutant indicating that SeCtpA, CrCtpA, and PpCtpA could process pD1 in 
Arabidopsis. Enzyme activity assays showed that PpCtpA and CrCtpA could convert 
pD1 into mature D1 in vitro. In contrast, expressing CtpB or CtpC from 
Arabidopsis, C. reinhardtii, or P. patens in atctpa did not rescue its D1 
maturation deficiency, and enzyme activity assays also showed that neither CtpB 
nor CtpC could process pD1 in vitro. Taken together, we conclude that the 
function of pD1 processing by CtpA is conserved in photosynthetic organisms. It 
is possible that among other factors CtpA developed this function to initiate 
the formation of the oxygenic D1/D2 type PSII complex during evolution whereas 
CtpB or CtpC have other roles that are still unclear.

safety of ribociclib plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) [with 
goserelin] for pre-/perimenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive and 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer. This 
analysis evaluated the cost effectiveness of ribociclib plus NSAI vs NSAI 
monotherapy and tamoxifen monotherapy from the perspective of the Canadian 
healthcare system.
METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as incremental costs 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for ribociclib plus an NSAI vs an 
NSAI and vs tamoxifen was estimated using a semi-Markov cohort model developed 
in Microsoft Excel with a 15-year time horizon and states for progression-free 
survival, post-progression survival, and dead. Survival distributions for 
progression-free survival, post-progression survival, and time to 
discontinuation as well as health-state utilities were estimated using data from 
MONALEESA-7. Direct costs of advanced breast cancer treatment were based on 
Canadian-specific values from published sources. Costs ($CAN 2019) and QALYs 
were discounted at 1.5% annually.
RESULTS: Ribociclib plus an NSAI was estimated to yield gains of 1.42 life-years 
and 1.17 QALYs vs an NSAI, and 2.61 life-years and 2.12 QALYs vs tamoxifen, at 
incremental costs of $209,701 and $220,836, respectively. In probabilistic 
analyses, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ribociclib plus an NSAI 
was estimated to be $178,872 per QALY gained vs an NSAI and $104,400 per QALY 
gained vs tamoxifen. Results of deterministic analyses were similar (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of $177,245 and $103,316 vs NSAI and tamoxifen, 
respectively). Results were sensitive to parametric distributions used for 
projecting progression-free survival and the time horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: At its current list price, ribociclib used in combination with NSAI 
is likely to be co-effective relative to an NSAI alone or tamoxifen alone if the 
willingness-to-pay threshold is less than approximately $178,000 per QALY. These 
results have informed deliberations regarding reimbursement and access to this 
treatment in Canada and may be useful for decision makers in other settings.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer is a growing threat to human health. Few studies have 
explored trends of thyroid cancer and relationships with social development 
factors. In this study, we explored the trend and relationship based on GBD.
METHODS: By using GBD study, we obtained detailed data of thyroid cancer. 
Incidence, mortality and DALY were used to assess epidemiological 
characteristics. ASR and EAPC were used to estimate the trend.
RESULTS: Globally, the incidence significantly increased from 1990 to 2017, 
especially in high-income regions. Males and middle SDI region demonstrated a 
higher increase of age-standardized incidence rates. Unlike incidence trend, 
mortality trend showed a minor increase, and even showed a decreasing trend in 
some regions such as Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the DALY trend 
also demonstrated a slightly increase with an EAPC of 0.77 (95% CI 0.73-0.81). 
More significant increase of DALY was found in males, middle SDI region and 
high-income Asia Pacific. The incidence of thyroid cancer peaked in middle-aged 
people, while the mortality and DALY peaked in elder-aged. Moreover, the 
proportion of thyroid cancer deaths contributable to high BMI was highest in 
developed countries and middle-aged people.
CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid cancer is a public health problem worldwide. Over-diagnosis 
might be partly responsible for its rising trend. It remains us to revise the 
guidelines to avoid unnecessary burdens. Moreover, we should pay attention to 
the risk factors of thyroid cancer. More targeted measures should be formulated 
to improve potential environmental and lifestyle-related factors which might 
contribute to rising trend of thyroid cancer.

OBJECTIVES: Most Medicaid beneficiaries with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are not 
treated with direct-acting agents because of budget constraints, but they 
experience costly complications after becoming Medicare eligible. Maryland's 
"total coverage" proposal could receive a credit from Medicare to offset 
Medicaid investments in treatments that could lead to Medicare savings. This 
study analyzes the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of total coverage for 
HCV treatments sponsored by state Medicare and Medicaid.
STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model simulated patients going through the care continuum 
of HCV. The model simulated 3 pathways: standard coverage with a 50% probability 
of screening for HCV and 20% probability of treatment; risk-stratified total 
coverage with assumed 80% probability of screening and 60% treatment rate; and 
total coverage with assumed 80% probability of screening 
and 100% treatment rate.
METHODS: The model calculated US$ and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to 
produce an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio evaluated at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. The budget impact for the state 
of Maryland was calculated in terms of per member per year.
RESULTS: Total coverage and risk-stratified coverage saved $158 per patient and 
$178 per patient, respectively, compared with standard care at an increased 
effectiveness of 0.05 and 0.02 QALYs over 25 years. Total coverage and 
risk-stratified total coverage would save $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, 
respectively, after 25 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Medicare-Medicaid partnerships to pay for all HCV treatments today 
represent good value and a low budget impact. States with trouble covering HCV 
treatments should consider using this model to plan coverage decisions.

IMPORTANCE: The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is updating its 2016 
colorectal cancer screening recommendations.
OBJECTIVE: To provide updated model-based estimates of the benefits, burden, and 
harms of colorectal cancer screening strategies and to identify strategies that 
may provide an efficient balance of life-years gained (LYG) from screening and 
colonoscopy burden to inform the USPSTF.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Comparative modeling study using 3 
microsimulation models of colorectal cancer screening in a hypothetical cohort 
of 40-year-old US individuals at average risk of colorectal cancer.
EXPOSURES: Screening from ages 45, 50, or 55 years to ages 70, 75, 80, or 85 
years with fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), multitarget stool DNA testing, 
flexible sigmoidoscopy alone or with FIT, computed tomography colonography, or 
colonoscopy. All persons with an abnormal noncolonoscopy screening test result 
were assumed to undergo follow-up colonoscopy. Screening intervals varied by 
test. Full adherence with all procedures was assumed.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Estimated LYG relative to no screening (benefit), 
lifetime number of colonoscopies (burden), number of complications from 
screening (harms), and balance of incremental burden and benefit (efficiency 
ratios). Efficient strategies were those estimated to require fewer additional 
colonoscopies per additional LYG relative to other strategies.
RESULTS: Estimated LYG from screening strategies ranged from 171 to 381 per 1000 
40-year-olds. Lifetime colonoscopy burden ranged from 624 to 6817 per 1000 
individuals, and screening complications ranged from 5 to 22 per 1000 
individuals. Among the 49 strategies that were efficient options with all 3 
models, 41 specified screening beginning at age 45. No single age to end 
screening was predominant among the efficient strategies, although the 
additional LYG from continuing screening after age 75 were generally small. With 
the exception of a 5-year interval for computed tomography colonography, no 
screening interval predominated among the efficient strategies for each 
modality. Among the strategies highlighted in the 2016 USPSTF recommendation, 
lowering the age to begin screening from 50 to 45 years was estimated to result 
in 22 to 27 additional LYG, 161 to 784 additional colonoscopies, and 0.1 to 2 
additional complications per 1000 persons (ranges are across screening 
strategies, based on mean estimates across models). Assuming full adherence, 
screening outcomes and efficient strategies were similar by sex and race and 
across 3 scenarios for population risk of colorectal cancer.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This microsimulation modeling analysis suggests that 
screening for colorectal cancer with stool tests, endoscopic tests, or computed 
tomography colonography starting at age 45 years provides an efficient balance 
of colonoscopy burden and life-years gained.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that use of intravascular ultrasound 
(IVUS) guidance during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated 
with improved clinical outcomes compared with angiography guidance alone. 
However, concern regarding the cost-effectiveness of IVUS has limited use of 
this technology worldwide. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of IVUS-guided PCI compared with angiography-guided PCI in 
patients undergoing drug-eluting stent implantation.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was constructed to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of IVUS to angiography guidance from the Australian 
healthcare system perspective. Procedure-related morbidity and mortality were 
estimated from the literature. Costs were obtained from Australian sources. The 
population of interest was all-comers undergoing PCI with drug-eluting stent. 
Outcomes of interest included costs, life-expectancy, and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) for both treatment groups.
RESULTS: In the base case, IVUS guidance was cost-effective compared with 
angiography guidance alone. With 5% annual discounting, IVUS was associated with 
increased lifetime costs of Australian dollars (AUD) $823 (USD $597) per person 
and benefits of 0.04 life years and 0.05 QALYs compared with angiography, 
yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AUD $17 539 (USD $12 730) 
per QALY gained. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses, with IVUS being 
cost-effective in 99% of 10 000 Monte Carlo iterations assuming a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of AUD $50 000 per QALY gained. In a worst-case 
scenario analysis, IVUS remained the cost-effective option, with an ICER of AUD 
$36 651 (USD $26 601) per QALY gained. Exploratory subgroup analysis revealed 
that cost-effectiveness may be greatest among patients with left main and 
complex coronary lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of IVUS guidance during PCI is likely to be cost-effective 
compared with angiography guidance alone among patients undergoing drug-eluting 
stent implantation.

Temporal trends of total liver cancer have been well reported in China, 
especially the trends caused by hepatitis B (HBV); however, the trends of liver 
cancer attributable to specific etiologies have rarely been reported in China. 
Thus, this study aims to describe the temporal trends in the incidence, 
mortality and DALYs of total and etiology-specific liver cancer in China from 
1990 to 2019. We extracted the incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) of total and etiology-specific liver cancer in China from 1990 to 
2019 from global disease burden (GBD) 2019. We plotted the trends in the 
age-standardized rates for incidence, mortality, and DALYs using locally 
weighted regression (LOESS)-smoothed data from 1990 to 2019. The 
age-standardized rate for the incidence of liver cancer was analyzed with an 
age-period-cohort method. The age-standardized rates for incidence, death, and 
DALYs decreased by -58.8%, -63.8%, and -65.6%, respectively, between 1990 and 
2019. The age-standardized rates of incidence, mortality, and DALYs of total 
liver cancer showed similar temporal patterns, presenting an overall decline, 
with the average annual percentage change (AAPC) ranging from -3.3% to -3.8%. 
People in the period before 2007 had a higher risk, and people after 2007 had a 
lower risk. The cohort risk ratios (RRs) showed decreasing patterns, with the 
most rapid decline observed in the 1910 to 1960 cohorts. Our study generally 
revealed favorable decreasing trends for total and etiology-specific liver 
cancer in China from 1990 to 2019. Despite the overall decline in liver cancer 
due to heavy alcohol use and obesity from 1990 to 2019, there have been apparent 
upward trends since 2006. Planned population-wide interventions targeting heavy 
alcohol use and obesity may mitigate the increasing trends in liver cancer 
attributable to alcohol use and NASH.

PURPOSE: The long-term survival of uveal melanoma patients in the US is not 
known. We compared long-term survival estimates using relative survival, excess 
absolute risk (EAR), Kaplan-Meier (KM), and competing risk analyses.
SETTING: Population based cohort study.
STUDY POPULATION: Pooled databases from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results data (SEER, SEER-9+SEER-13+SEER-18).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Overall Survival (OS), Metastasis Free Survival (MFS) and 
relative survival, computed directly or estimated via a model fitted to excess 
mortality.
RESULTS: There were 10678 cases of uveal melanoma spanning a period of 42 years 
(1975-2016). The median age at diagnosis was 63 years (range 3-99). Over half 
the patients were still alive at the end of 2016 (53%, 5625). The KM estimates 
of MFS were 0.729 (0.719, 0.74), 0.648 (0.633, 0.663), and 0.616 (0.596, 0.636) 
at 10, 20, and 30 years, respectively. The cumulative probabilities of melanoma 
metastatic death at 10, 20 and 30 years were 0.241 (0.236, 0.245), 0.289 (0.283, 
0.294), and 0.301 (0.295, 0.307). In the first 5 years since diagnosis of uveal 
melanoma, the proportion of deaths attributable to uveal melanoma were 1.3 with 
rapid fall after 10 years. Death due to melanoma were rare beyond 20 years. 
Relative survival (RS) plateaued to ~60% across 20 to 30 years. EAR parametric 
modeling yielded a survival probability of 57%.
CONCLUSIONS: Relative survival methods can be used to estimate long term 
survival of uveal melanoma patients without knowing the exact cause of death. RS 
and EAR provide more realistic estimates as they compare the survival to that of 
a normal matched population. Death due to melanoma were rare beyond 20 years 
with normal life expectancy reached at 25 years after primary therapy.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease, yet life 
expectancy has recently increased, shifting the focus to disease management and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Identification of clinical factors, such 
as weight status and CF-related diabetes (CFRD), that are associated with HRQoL 
can inform clinicians about the patient's health perception. The goal of this 
systematic review was two prong: identify the association of pediatric weight 
status and HRQoL and determine how CFRD status impacts HRQoL.
METHODS: A systematic review of published research was conducted following the 
methodology in the Cochrane Handbook on Systematic Reviews for Interventional 
Studies. Results were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses. Risk of bias was assessed using the 
National Heart Lung & Blood Institute tool. A meta-analysis was not performed 
due to variability of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, differences in outcome 
reporting, and insufficient primary outcome data to pool.
RESULTS: Nine studies met inclusion criteria (n = 6 explored weight status and 
n = 3 studied CFRD), for a total of 1585 subjects (CFRD cases = 87). Pediatric 
weight status was positively associated with HRQoL, most commonly the Body Image 
and Eating Disturbance domains. CFRD was negatively associated with HRQoL, 
specifically the Treatment Burden and Weight domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the limited data available, improved pediatric weight 
status appears to increase HRQoL while a CFRD diagnosis appears to decrease 
HRQoL. More research is needed to fully understand the role of these clinical 
factors on HRQoL, especially with life expectancy increasing among those with 
CF.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the health characteristics and current treatment choices 
of male stress urinary incontinence (mSUI) patients to inform patient-centered 
decision-making.
METHODS: We identified a cohort of mSUI patients aged ≥65 at UCSF and San 
Francisco VA. Using retrospective chart review and telephone interviews, we 
ascertained demographics, incontinence characteristics, Charlson Comorbidity 
Index (score ≥ 4 indicates significant morbidity), frailty with Timed Up and Go 
(TUG) test, functional dependence with activities of daily living (ADL), 
calculated life expectancy, and assessed mental health and quality of life 
(QOL). Bivariate analysis evaluated associations between subject characteristics 
and ultimate treatment type (conservative vs surgery; sling vs sphincter). 
Logistic multivariable models evaluating treatment choice were also constructed.
RESULTS: The 130 participants had a mean age of 75 and a mean incontinence score 
of 14.2 representing moderately bothersome incontinence. Nearly 80% had 
significant morbidity, three-quarters had >50% 10-year mortality risk, 10% 
needed help with 1 + ADL and 22% had a TUG >10 seconds indicating frailty. The 
mean physical and mental QOL scores were similar to the general population. 
Anxiety and depression were reported by 3.9% and 10%. In univariate and 
multivariable analysis, only incontinence characteristics were associated with 
conservative vs surgical treatment choice (P < .01).
CONCLUSION: Multi-morbidity, functional dependence, frailty, and limited life 
expectancy are common among older men with mSUI, yet current treatment choices 
appear to be driven by incontinence characteristics. As such, mSUI surgery 
should be considered among men across the spectrum of health and life 
expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: Selecting optimal hemodialysis access in elderly patients remains 
challenging, particularly in those requiring new options after failed initial 
access. We sought to describe the outcomes of redo hemodialysis access in 
elderly patients.
METHODS: All patients aged ≥65 undergoing hemodialysis access placement from 
2014-2019 were retrospectively identified in the electronic medical record. 
Characteristics and outcomes of those with initial versus redo access were 
compared. Patency was depicted utilizing Kaplan-Meier methods, with censoring at 
loss to follow-up or death, and unadjusted Cox regression.
RESULTS: Overall, 211 elderly patients undergoing 257 procedures were included 
in the study. Of these, 116 (45.1%) were redo access procedures. There were no 
demographic or comorbidity differences between the two groups with the exception 
of central venous stenosis which was more common in the redo cohort (27.2% vs. 
6.4%, P < 0.001). 91.5% of initial, vs. 60.3% of redo, procedures were 
arteriovenous fistulas (P < 0.001). Distribution of fistula type differed 
between the two groups with first time and redo procedures of 25.5% vs. 6.9% 
radiocephalic, 28.4% vs. 7.8% brachiocephalic, and 35.5% vs. 37.1% 
brachiobasilic respectively (P < 0.001). At 12 and 24 months, 63.6% and 44.0% of 
first-time accesses remained patent vs. 51% and 29.0% of redo accesses (HR 1.37, 
95% CI 1.05-1.80, P = 0.02). However, there was no difference in primary patency 
between redo grafts and fistulas (48.7% fistulas vs. 55.0% grafts at 12 months, 
P = 0.47).
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate acceptable outcomes of redo access in 
elderly patients. There is no evidence from this study that prosthetic grafts 
are preferential, suggesting elderly patients with meaningful life expectancy 
who require redo access should be offered autogenous options when possible.
