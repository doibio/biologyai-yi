BACKGROUND/AIMS: Most countries with high hepatitis B (HB) virus endemicity and 
most high-income countries have introduced immunization programmes against this 
infection. However, several low-income countries with intermediate HB endemicity 
have not done so. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of universal 
childhood HB immunization in such countries using India as an example, since 
available data on this aspect are limited.
METHODS: Marginal cost of every life-year and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gained with universal HB vaccination was calculated using a Markov model. Two 
types of analyses (including and excluding expenditure on treatment of long-term 
complications of HB infection) were done. Several sensitivity analyses and 
Monte-Carlo simulation were performed.
RESULTS: Universal immunization reduced the HB carrier rate by 71%, and 
increased the number of years and QALY lived by a birth-cohort by 0.173 years 
(61.072 vs. 60.899 years) and 0.213 years (61.056 vs. 60.843 years), 
respectively. Marginal costs were US$16.27 per life-year gained and US$13.22 per 
QALY gained, much lower than annual per capita income. One-way sensitivity 
analysis and Monte-Carlo simulation confirmed the robustness of the conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal HB immunization is highly cost-effective in low-income 
countries with intermediate endemicity rates.

BACKGROUND: Catheter-related bloodstream infections are costly and associated 
with substantial morbidity and mortality. Trials suggest that central venous 
catheters impregnated with minocycline/rifampin, although more expensive, are 
clinically superior to chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine impregnated catheters. 
It remains unclear whether minocycline/rifampin catheters are cost-effective for 
all high-risk patients or only those requiring longer-term catheterization.
METHODS: We developed a series of decision models with patient-level clinical 
trial data to determine whether minocycline/rifampin catheters are 
cost-effective for patients requiring various durations of catheterization. We 
calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for patients catheterized for 
durations ranging from 1 to 25 days.
RESULTS: The data were too sparse to estimate cost-effectiveness for patients 
catheterized less than 8 days. The probability that minocycline/rifampin 
catheters were cost-effective compared with chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine 
catheters in patients catheterized for 8 days was 91%. The probability that the 
minocycline/rifampin catheters in patients catheterized 13 days or longer 
resulted in cost savings was more than 95%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that central venous catheters coated with 
minocycline/rifampin are cost-effective for patients catheterized for at least 1 
week and lead to overall cost savings when patients are catheterized for 2 weeks 
or longer. Policies for the use of antimicrobial catheters in high-risk patients 
should reflect patients' expected duration of catheterization.

Hepatocellular carcinoma: gardening strategies and bridges to transplantation.

Gores GJ(1).

Author information:
(1)Transplant Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.

BACKGROUND: Survival after liver transplantation for early hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) is worsened by the increasing dropout rate while waiting for a 
donor.
AIMS: To assess the cost effectiveness of adjuvant therapy while waiting for 
liver transplantation in HCC patients.
METHOD: Using a Markov model, a hypothetical cohort of cirrhotic patients with 
early HCC was considered for: (1) adjuvant treatment-resection was limited to 
Child-Pugh's A patients with single tumours, and percutaneous treatment was 
considered for Child-Pugh's A and B patients with single tumours unsuitable for 
resection or with up to three nodules < 3 cm; and (2) standard management. 
Length of waiting time ranged from six to 24 months.
RESULTS: Surgical resection increased the transplantation rate (>10%) and 
provided gains in life expectancy of 4.8-6.1 months with an acceptable cost (US 
dollars 40,000/ year of life gained) for waiting lists > or = 1 year whereas it 
was not cost effective (US dollars 74,000/life of year gained) for shorter 
waiting times or high dropout rate scenarios. Percutaneous treatment increased 
life expectancy by 5.2-6.7 months with a marginal cost of approximately US 
dollars 20,000/year of life gained in all cases, remaining cost effective for 
all waiting times.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant therapies for HCC while waiting for liver transplantation 
provide moderate gains in life expectancy and are cost effective for waiting 
lists of one year or more. For shorter waiting times, only percutaneous 
treatment confers a relevant survival advantage.

Treatment options for patients with acute myeloid leukemia with a matched 
sibling donor: a decision analysis.

BACKGROUND: The role of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in the 
consolidation of young adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with matched 
sibling donors (MSD) is controversial. Although BMT is associated with increased 
event free survival compared with intensive chemotherapy (CT) consolidation, BMT 
also is associated with increased treatment-related mortality and likely 
decreased quality of life and life expectancy in patients who do not develop 
recurrent disease.
METHODS: The authors used decision analysis to compare three strategies for 
maximizing quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in patients with AML in first 
remission with an MSD: BMT All, BMT None (consolidation CT only), or BMT in 
high-risk patients, as defined by baseline cytogenetic testing (Test strategy). 
A second decision-analysis tree was then constructed that compared BMT with CT 
specifically for patients with intermediate cytogenetics.
RESULTS: Using expected QALYs as the outcome measure, the Test, BMT All, and BMT 
None strategies were associated with 20.10 QALYs, 19.63 QALYs, and 18.38 QALYs, 
respectively. Thus, the Test strategy, with CT for low-risk patients and BMT for 
intermediate risk and high-risk patients, was expected to be the optimal 
strategy. In the intermediate cytogenetic decision analysis, although the 
expected QALY for BMT recipients was higher compared with CT recipients (19.78 
QALYs vs. 18.75 QALYs), because of uncertainty in variable estimates, the 
optimal choice was less clear.
CONCLUSIONS: CT consolidation is a reasonable option for patients with AML who 
have favorable cytogenetics, even if an MSD is available. This model provides a 
framework from which patients with AML and their physicians can make decisions 
about consolidation therapy.

[Extension of life-span of normal human fibroblasts by reconstitution of 
telomerase activity].

[Article in Chinese]

Most of normal human somatic cells can divide only a finite number of times and 
inevitably become senescent. Telomerase is an enzyme that imparts replicative 
immortality by maintaining the length of the telomeres when expressed in 
reproductive and cancer cells. Cells that are mortal do not express the 
telomerase. Recently it was reported that the life-span of the normal human 
cells could be successfully extended by introduction of telomerase into these 
cells. We have found, in the previous work, that fibroblasts exhibited an 
osteogentic potential, and therefore, can be considered as a type of "seed 
cells" in tissue engineering for bone repairing and reconstruction. But this 
potential was impaired by the limitation in life-span and proliferative capacity 
of the normal fibroblasts. In the present work, plasmid pGRN145 bearing a cDNA 
insert of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) was introduced into the 
fibroblasts with osteogenic potential by electroporation. The stable hTERT+ 
fibroblast clones was established and cultured for long-term in a medium 
containing hygromycin-B. The exogenous hTERT mRNA expression and telomerase 
activity were detected. The hTERT+ fibroblasts showed shorter population 
doubling time and no beta-galactosidase stain, which indicated a stronger 
proliferative capacity and fewer signs of cell senescence, compared to their 
hTERT- counterpart. These evidenced that the life-span of hTERT+ fibroblasts was 
extended. The assays for DNA euploidy by flow cytometry and chromosome karyotype 
by cytogenetic technique showed no signs of heteroploidy, providing the data for 
cell carcinogenesis and utilization safety. The results of the present study 
suggested that the introduction of hTERT could make the life-span of normal 
fibroblast extended without causing their malignant transformation, and such 
type of "longevous" fibroblasts might be clinically useful in tissue engineering 
for bone repairing and reconstruction.

A follow-up study to investigate the efficacy of initial treatment of lentigo 
maligna with surgical excision.

Osborne JE(1), Hutchinson PE.

Recurrence rates following conventional surgery for lentigo maligna (LM) are 
reported to be between 7% and 15%. However, the studies are few, contain small 
numbers of patients and have relatively short follow-up. The principle aim of 
this study was to determine the efficacy of conventional surgery for LM in a 
large unbiased sample of all LM presenting in a defined geographical area. All 
LM cases occurring in Leicestershire between 1987 and 1996 were identified. Data 
were gathered from case notes, general practitioners and the Office for National 
Statistics (for any mortality data) and patients were invited to attend for 
examination. There were 89 evaluable patients treated with primary excision, 
representing the largest reported series to date. There was a false positive 
rate for diagnostic biopsy for LM (when the correct diagnosis was lentigo 
maligna melanoma, LMM) of 5% (95% confidence interval, CI: 1% to 14%). The 
initial excision was histologically incomplete in 9% (4% to 17%) of cases. In 
completely excised lesions (n=81) the observed recurrence rate was 20% (CI: 12% 
to 30%) at a mean follow-up of 42 months, which is similar to previous reports. 
However, Kaplan-Meier analysis yielded an estimated probability of recurrence of 
31% (CI: 19% to 50%); time to relapse was up to 66 months. The age and sex of 
the patient and the site of the lesion were not associated with outcome, but, 
surprisingly, smaller lesions were associated with incomplete excision and 
recurrence. Fifteen current lesions were excised with similar success rates: the 
incomplete re-excision rate was 7% (CI: 0.2% to 32%) and the recurrence rate was 
31% (CI: 12% to 83%) at 28 months. The estimated rate of transformation to LMM 
after initial surgical treatment was 1.5% (CI: 0.3% to 8%), and LMM was not the 
cause of death in any patient. These recurrence rates following complete primary 
excision and re-excision following recurrence were high compared with general 
expectations, which is largely the result of the method of analysis and the long 
follow-up. The high rate calls into question the accuracy of the routine 
histological assessment of clearance. The development of LMM was rare following 
surgery.

Defining the Neutral Zone of sheep intervertebral joints during dynamic motions: 
an in vitro study.

University of Technology, GPO Box 2434, Qld 4001, Brisbane, Australia.

OBJECTIVE: To make an experimental assessment of the Neutral Zone of 
intervertebral joints during dynamic spinal motion in flexion/extension, lateral 
bending and axial rotation and to develop a criterion for its definition.
DESIGN: Dynamic mechanical testing of sheep intervertebral joints with a 
six-degree of freedom robotic facility under position control.
BACKGROUND: The Neutral Zone is defined as a region of no or little resistance 
to motion in the middle of an intervertebral joint's range of movement. Previous 
studies have used quasi-static loading regimes that do not model physiological 
activity. This study simulated physiological movements using a robotic testing 
facility to address this issue.
METHODS: Five spines from mature sheep were used and three motion segments were 
tested from each spine. The robotic facility enabled the testing regime to be 
defined for each individual joint based on its geometry. The joints were tested 
by cycling through the full range of physiological movement in 
flexion/extension, lateral bending and axial rotation.
RESULTS: A Neutral Zone was found to exist during dynamic movements only in 
flexion/extension. The results suggested that a Neutral Zone does not exist in 
lateral bending or axial rotation. The zygapophysial joints were shown to be 
significant in determining the mechanics of the intervertebral joints as their 
removal increased the Neutral Zone in all cases. A new criterion for defining 
the size of the Neutral Zone during dynamic motion was proposed and its 
implications for spinal movements in life discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: A Neutral Zone exists in flexion/extension during dynamic movements 
of intervertebral joints and is a feature of the natural range of joint motion. 
This has important implications for the muscular control of the spine consisting 
of several intrinsically lax joints stacked on one another.
RELEVANCE: The existence of a Neutral Zone is a feature of the natural range of 
joint motion and requires complex control of intervertebral joints by the spinal 
muscles. Defining the biomechanical response throughout the physiological range 
of motion (RoM) is important in understanding possible injury and rehabilitation 
mechanisms.

Comment on
    Haematologica. 2003 Jan;88(1):1-4.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Polycythemia vera (PV) is unusual in young patients, 
so that little information is available on long-term clinical evolution in this 
particular group. The aim of this study was to define the long-term risk of 
thrombosis, acute leukemia (AL) and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) 
in young PV patients.
DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1975 to 2000, 70 PV patients aged less than 50 years 
were followed for a median time of 14 years (range 2-26). About three quarters 
were treated with pipobroman. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression were 
used for survival analysis. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 
calculated using Italian age/sex specific mortality rates.
RESULTS: The risk of thrombosis increased during the observation period, 
reaching a plateau of 14% at 10 years and was markedly higher in individuals 
with a previous history of thrombosis (p=0.0023). No patient had progression 
into AL or MMM before the 9th year of follow-up. Subsequently, five patients 
(7%) developed AL and five (7%) MMM, with a 20-year cumulative risk of 15% and 
10%, respectively. Overall survival at 20 years was 62%, with nine patients 
dying of progression into AL or MMM, four of vascular events, one of lung 
cancer, and four of non-PV-related causes. The SMR was 5.3, indicating a 
mortality significantly higher than that of the general population (p<0.000).
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This long-term retrospective cohort study shows 
that although the median survival of young patients with PV exceeds 23 years, 
their life expectancy is markedly lower than that of the general population 
because of disease evolution into AL or MMM.

Surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in elderly cirrhotic patients: 
personal experience.

Policlinico 155, 00161 Rome, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Due to the longer life expectancy of the world's population, the 
number of elderly cirrhotic patients undergoing surgery for hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) is increasing. Our study evaluates the benefits of hepatic 
resections for HCC in cirrhotic patients aged over 65, analysing the early and 
long-term surgical results.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively considered a series of 46 patients 
receiving hepatic resection for HCC. The clinicopathological data and surgical 
outcome of 14 (30.4%) patients aged 65 or older (group I) were evaluated and 
compared to the 32 (69.6%) younger than 65 (group II).
RESULTS: No operative mortality was recorded in either group. The hospital 
mortality rate was 7.1% (1 out of 14) in group I and 9.4% (3 out of 32) in group 
II (p = 1.00). Hospital morbidity did not differ significantly in the two groups 
(21.4% vs 34.4%; p = 0.50). At follow-up (median 34 months, interquartile range: 
12-63) 3 patients from group I (21.4%) and 16 patients from group II (50%) 
experienced tumor recurrence (p = 0.14). The five-year disease-free survival 
rate for group I and group II was 71.4% vs 28.2%, respectively (p = 0.05). The 
overall 5-year survival rate for group I and group II was, respectively, 77.4% 
vs 41.8%, (p = 0.3).
CONCLUSION: Elderly cirrhotic patients with HCC can benefit from hepatic 
resection as well as younger patients; age by itself should not be considered a 
contraindication to surgery.

A new estimate of Ukrainian population losses during the crises of the 1930s and 
1940s.

Ukraine experienced two very acute demographic crises during the Soviet era: the 
1933 famine and the Second World War. While different estimates of total losses 
have been produced previously, we have tried here to distinguish the specific 
impact of the crises on mortality from their impact on fertility and migration. 
Taking into account all existing sources of registered data and estimates, a 
painstaking reconstruction of annual demographic changes has been produced and 
complete annual life tables have been computed for the years 1926-59. Life 
expectancy at birth fell to a level as low as 10 years for females and 7 for 
males in 1933 and plateaued around 25 for females and 15 for males in the period 
1941-44.

Changes in functional limitation and survival among older Taiwanese, 1993, 1996, 
and 1999.

Zimmer Z(1), Martin LG, Chang MC.

Author information:
(1)Population Council, New York, USA.

Using data from the Survey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly in Taiwan, 
we investigate changes in difficulties in walking and climbing stairs, tasks 
that represent basic lower-body movements less likely to be influenced by 
changes in environment and social roles than are activities and instrumental 
activities of daily living. Results are shown for unadjusted prevalence rates 
and rates adjusted for changes in population composition. The findings indicate 
that Taiwan does not appear to be experiencing the improvements in functioning 
witnessed recently in the United States. Prevalence of functional limitation 
increased between 1993 and 1996 and between 1996 and 1999. One possible reason 
is the change in old-age survival, which appears to have benefited those who 
have functional limitations, especially in a severe form. The Universal Health 
Insurance programme, established in 1995, may have increased access to care and 
thus the survival of those in poorest health.

Applying Lee-Carter under conditions of variable mortality decline.

The Lee-Carter method of mortality forecasting assumes an invariant age 
component and most applications have adopted a linear time component. The use of 
the method with Australian data is compromised by significant departures from 
linearity in the time component and changes over time in the age component. We 
modify the method to adjust the time component to reproduce the age distribution 
of deaths, rather than total deaths, and to determine the optimal fitting period 
in order to address non-linearity in the time component. In the Australian case 
the modification has the added advantage that the assumption of invariance is 
better met. For Australian data, the modifications result in higher forecast 
life expectancy than the original Lee-Carter method and official projections, 
and a 50 per cent reduction in forecast error. The model is also expanded to 
take account of age-time interactions by incorporating additional terms, but 
these are not readily incorporated into forecasts.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the treatment and health care costs of HIV infection or 
AIDS in France during the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
DESIGN: We used a clinical database of HIV-infected patients to calculate the 
resource use and cost of care for different stages of HIV infection. Costs were 
incorporated into a computer-based, probabilistic simulation model of the 
natural history and treatment of HIV infection to estimate the lifetime cost of 
treating patients with HIV disease.
SETTING: A northern France HIV clinical cohort.
PARTICIPANTS: 1232 HIV-infected patients followed from January 1994 through July 
1998.
RESULTS: In the absence of an AIDS-defining event, the average total cost of 
care ranged from 670 euros (1 euro=US $1.19) per person-month in the highest CD4 
stratum (>500/microl) to 1060 euros per person-month in the lowest CD4 stratum 
(< or = 50/microl). The mean cost of care was estimated at 3370 euros per 
person-month during the initial months around the occurrence of an AIDS-defining 
event; at 1750 euros per person-month during the period spanning from 2 months 
after the diagnosis of specific AIDS-defining event to 1 month prior to death; 
and at 13010 euros per person-month in the final month prior to death. If 
clinical management of HIV infection began at a CD4 cell count of 378/microl, as 
in this cohort, the discounted lifetime cost of treating an HIV-infected French 
patient was estimated at 214000 euros. The undiscounted costs were 309000 euros 
over a projected life expectancy of 16.4 years.
CONCLUSION: The cost of HIV disease varies widely depending upon the stage of 
illness. These estimates of stage-specific and lifetime costs of HIV care will 
assist health policy planners in assessing the burden of disease in the era of 
HAART and projecting future resource requirements.

OBJECTIVE: Evidence concerning whether sleep disturbances in older adults 
predict mortality is mixed. However, data are limited to self-reported sleep 
problems and may be confounded with other comorbidities. We examined whether 
electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep parameters predicted survival time 
independently of known predictors of all-cause mortality.
METHODS: A total of 185 healthy older adults, primarily in their 60s through 
80s, with no history of mental illness, sleep complaints, or current cognitive 
impairment, were enrolled in one of eight research protocols between October 
1981 and February 1997 that included EEG sleep assessments. At follow-up (mean 
[SD] = 12.8 [3.7] years after baseline, range = 4.1-19.5), 66 individuals were 
positively ascertained as deceased and 118 remained alive (total N = 184).
RESULTS: Controlling for age, gender, and baseline medical burden, individuals 
with baseline sleep latencies greater than 30 minutes were at 2.14 times greater 
risk of death (p =.005, 95% CI = 1.25-3.66). Those with sleep efficiency less 
than 80% were at 1.93 times greater risk (p =.014, CI = 1.14-3.25). Individuals 
with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep percentages in the lowest 15% or highest 15% 
of the total sample's distribution (percentage of REM <16.1 or >25.7) were at 
1.71 times greater risk (p =.045, CI = 1.01-2.91). Percentage of slow-wave sleep 
was associated with time to death at the bivariate level, but not after 
controlling for potential confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with specific EEG sleep characteristics have an excess 
risk of dying beyond that associated with age, gender, or medical burden. The 
findings suggest that interventions to optimize and protect older adults' sleep 
initiation, continuity, and quality may be warranted.

OBJECTIVE: In light of recent studies suggesting the existence of associations 
between low concentrations of cholesterol and various psychiatric disorders, we 
decided to explore relationships between cholesterol levels and relapse rates in 
a group of cocaine addicts who had undergone inpatient detoxification.
METHODS: The total cholesterol levels of 38 non-opiate-dependent and 
non-alcohol-dependent cocaine addicts were determined while they were 
hospitalized. Drug use was subsequently assessed 3, 6, and 12 months after 
patients were discharged from the hospital.
RESULTS: Comparisons of the cholesterol levels (obtained during hospitalization) 
of relapsers and nonrelapsers by analyses of covariance with age and weight as 
covariates revealed significantly lower cholesterol values in patients who 
relapsed at 3 months (p =.046), 6 months (p =.030), and 12 months (p =.019) 
after discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed an association between a low total cholesterol 
level and relapse rates in detoxified cocaine addicts. Reasons for the 
predictive value of low cholesterol levels for relapse for up to 1 year after 
cholesterol measurements were made are unclear. These data are preliminary and 
in need of replication.

Challenging but essential targets for genuine anti-ageing drugs.

De Grey AD.

Contrary to what one might conclude from the popular press, anti-ageing drugs do 
not yet exist, in the sense in which the term 'drug' is normally used. Since a 
drug is assumed to be effective against its target human pathology and since the 
vast majority of deaths in the developed world are from ageing-related causes, 
it is inappropriate to describe something as an anti-ageing drug unless one has 
good reason to believe that it will appreciably extend the life expectancy of 
those in the developed world who receive it. A drug that rejuvenates aspects of 
the aged body but does not increase life expectancy is an antifrailty drug, not 
an anti-ageing one. This distinction is critical for decision makers in the drug 
discovery sphere because, while the market for antifrailty drugs (even unproven 
ones) is large, that for genuine anti-ageing drugs - which, as the author 
explains, are now foreseeable - will certainly be far larger. In this article, 
the author surveys the main aspects of age-related degeneration that are 
believed to be essential targets for genuine anti-ageing drugs - that is, 
without whose amelioration human life expectancy probably cannot be greatly 
increased - and some promising strategies for the design of such drugs.

BACKGROUND: The performance of coronary bypass surgery without cardiopulmonary 
bypass ("off pump") may reduce perioperative morbidity and costs, but it is 
uncertain whether the outcome is similar to that involving the use of 
cardiopulmonary bypass ("on pump").
METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized trial, we randomly assigned 139 patients 
with predominantly single- or double-vessel coronary disease to on-pump surgery 
and 142 to off-pump surgery. Cardiac outcome and cost effectiveness were 
determined one year after surgery. The uncertainty surrounding the 
cost-effectiveness ratio (cost differences per quality-adjusted year of life 
gained) was addressed by bootstrapping.
RESULTS: At one year, the rate of freedom from death, stroke, myocardial 
infarction, and coronary reintervention was 90.6 percent after on-pump surgery 
and 88.0 percent after off-pump surgery (absolute difference, 2.6 percent; 95 
percent confidence interval, - 4.6 to 9.8). Graft patency in a randomized 
subgroup of patients was 93 percent after on-pump surgery and 91 percent after 
off-pump surgery (absolute difference, 2.0 percent; 95 percent confidence 
interval, - 6.5 to 10.4). On-pump surgery was associated with $1,839 in 
additional direct costs per patient ($14,908 vs. $13,069--a difference of 14.1 
percent) and an increase in quality-adjusted years of life of 0.83 as compared 
with 0.82 (difference, 0.01 year; 95 percent confidence interval, - 0.03 to 
0.04). Off-pump surgery was more cost effective than on-pump surgery in 95 
percent of bootstrap estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: In low-risk patients, there was no difference in cardiac outcome at 
one year between those who underwent on-pump bypass surgery and those who 
underwent off-pump surgery. Off-pump surgery was more cost effective.

Agnathan fish hold a key position in vertebrate evolution, especially regarding 
the origin of the head and neural-crest-derived tissue. In contrast to 
amphioxus, lampreys and other vertebrates possess a complex brain and placodes 
that contribute to well-developed eyes, as well as auditory and olfactory 
systems. These sensory sytems were arguably a trigger to subsequent vertebrate 
diversifications. However, although they are known from skeletal impressions in 
younger Palaeozoic agnathans, information about the earliest records of these 
systems has been largely wanting. Here we report numerous specimens of the Lower 
Cambrian vertebrate Haikouichthys ercaicunensis, until now only known from the 
holotype. Haikouichthys shows significant differences from other fossil 
agnathans: key features include a small lobate extension to the head, with eyes 
and possible nasal sacs, as well as what may be otic capsules. A notochord with 
separate vertebral elements is also identifiable. Phylogenetic analysis 
indicates that this fish lies within the stem-group craniates. Although 
Haikouichthys somewhat resembles the ammocoete larva of modern lampreys, this is 
because of shared general craniate characters; adult lampreys and hagfishes (the 
cyclostomes if monophyletic) are probably derived in many respects.

Objectivity in priority setting tools in reproductive health: context and the 
DALY.

Melbourne, Australia. pascale@unimelb.edu.au

The Disability Adjusted Life-Year (DALY) heralded a new age in the development 
of an evidence base for priority setting and resource allocation. The DALY was 
intended to represent sound measurement of the incidence and prevalence of 
conditions in a process by which burden of disease would be determined, health 
conditions prioritised and interventions evaluated. However, in the reification 
of objectivity, sight was lost of critical aspects of health and disease, namely 
that they are not independent of the context in which they occur. This is 
powerfully illustrated by many reproductive health conditions. Priority setting 
and resource allocation exercises need to take into account both objective 
measures and contextually relevant factors. Based on comparative data that 
highlights the effect of the development gradient on the burden of disease, this 
paper discusses the implications of context in the assessment of population 
health and priority setting, with a focus on reproductive health.

Medicine, Lithuania. kaleda@kaunas.omnitel.net

Health is a sensitive mirror of social circumstances. This paper looks at the 
situation of women's health in Lithuania in the context of the social, political 
and economic transition in the country following independence in 1990, and 
reforms to the health system. Data since 1990 show that considerable social and 
demographic inequalities in the health of women exist in Lithuania, with 
low-educated women and those living in rural areas in the most unfavourable 
situation, including in relation to reproductive health. Reproductive health 
issues have received some recognition in recent years, with the main attention 
and resources directed to the development of a Maternal and Child Health 
Programme, especially perinatal care and the organisation of neonatology 
services, which has resulted in a notable decrease in maternal, perinatal and 
infant mortality. Services for family planning, abortion, infertility, cervical 
and breast cancer, and violence against women are under-developed. 
Non-governmental organizations are beginning to be formed to advocate for 
increased resources and services for reproductive health. Improvements in the 
health status of Lithuanian women can be expected if attention is paid to social 
determinants of health.

The burden of affective disorders includes costs and the pain and suffering of 
affected individuls. Burden can be perceived from social and private 
perspectives. Although no ideal measure of burden exists, ample evidence 
documents the extensive cost and other negative impacts of affective disorders. 
Affective disorders are associated with disruptive family relations, higher 
health care costs for comorbid conditions, elevated rates of suicide, and lower 
productivity. Reserch should focus on improving measures of burden in general 
and on quantifying burden from the standpoint of diverse population groups.

Marriage among unwed mothers: whites, blacks and Hispanics compared.

Park, USA. graefe@pop.psu.edu

CONTEXT: Much of the debate over welfare reauthorization centers on whether 
marriage promotion should play a key role. Few studies, however, have tracked 
the marriage and divorce histories of unwed mothers, including minority women, 
who are often the main targets of welfare reform.
METHODS: Data from the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth were used to 
estimate the hazards of the transition to marriage for women who delayed 
childbearing until marriage and for teenagers and older women who had a 
nonmarital first birth, and of the transition to divorce among the ever-married. 
Life-table estimates calculated with these estimated transition hazards show the 
cumulative proportions married and divorced, by race and ethnicity, for women 
who had a nonmarital first birth and for those who did not. RESULTS Nonmarital 
childbearing reduces the likelihood of marriage. Some 82% of white women, 62% of 
Hispanics and 59% of blacks who had a nonmarital first birth had married by age 
40; the corresponding proportions among those who avoided nonmarital 
childbearing were 89%, 93% and 76%, respectively. There is no evidence to 
suggest that the negative effect of nonmarital childbearing on marriage is 
caused by other observed or unobserved differences between unwed mothers and 
women who remain childless until marriage. Nonmarital childbearing raises the 
likelihood of divorce among unwed mothers who eventually marry, a finding that 
also varies by race and ethnicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Marriage promotion policies should focus on lowering rates of 
nonmarital childbearing. Reductions in nonmarital childbearing, however, may not 
eliminate long-standing discrepancies in marriage rates between black and white 
women.

    Gastroenterology. 2003 Oct;125(4):1268-70; discussion 1270.

BACKGROUND: Once-in-a-lifetime screening for Barrett esophagus has been proposed 
for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but there is little 
evidence of its cost-effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: 1) To determine the cost-effectiveness of screening high-risk groups 
for Barrett esophagus and providing surveillance to patients with Barrett 
esophagus and dysplasia or to all patients with Barrett esophagus and 2) to 
compare the results with the cost-effectiveness of no screening or surveillance.
DESIGN: A decision analytic model was developed to examine no screening or 
surveillance and screening and surveillance for Barrett esophagus with dysplasia 
only or Barrett esophagus without dysplasia every 2 to 5 years. Low- or 
high-grade dysplasia received surveillance every 6 or 3 months, respectively.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature and the Health Care Financing Administration.
TARGET POPULATION: 50-year-old white men with symptoms of GERD.
TIME HORIZON: 50 years of age until 80 years of age or death.
PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer.
OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Screening with surveillance limited to patients 
with Barrett esophagus with dysplasia required $10 440 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) saved compared to no screening or surveillance. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of surveillance every 5 years in patients with Barrett 
esophagus without dysplasia compared to surveillance of patients with Barrett 
esophagus with dysplasia was $596 000 per QALY saved.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The annual incidence of adenocarcinoma must 
exceed 1 case per 54 patient-years of follow-up (1.9%) for surveillance of 
Barrett esophagus without dysplasia every 5 years to yield an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio less than $50 000 per QALY saved.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening 50-year-old men with symptoms of GERD to detect 
adenocarcinoma associated with Barrett esophagus is probably cost-effective. 
However, subsequent surveillance of patients with Barrett esophagus but no 
dysplasia, even at 5-year intervals, is an expensive practice.

NICE methodological guidelines and decision making in the National Health 
Service in England and Wales.

Health Economics and Policy Analysis, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, 
Canada.

The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) responds to requests by 
the Department of Health for guidance on the use of selected new and established 
technologies in the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales. This 
paper asks whether the NICE methodological guidelines help NHS decision makers 
meet the objectives of maximum health improvements from NHS resources and an 
equitable availability of technologies. The analytical basis of the guidelines 
is a comparison of the costs and consequences of new and existing methods of 
dealing with particular conditions using the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio. We explain why information on the costs and consequences of a particular 
technology in isolation is insufficient to address issues of efficiency of 
resource use. We argue that to increase efficiency, decision makers need 
information on opportunity costs. We show that in the absence of such 
information decision makers cannot identify the efficient use of resources. 
Finally we argue that economics provides valid methods for identifying the 
maximisation of health improvements for a given allocation of resources and we 
describe an alternative practical approach to this problem. Drawing on the 
experience of Ontario, Canada where an approach similar to that proposed by NICE 
has been in use for almost a decade, and recent reports about the consequences 
of NICE decisions to date, we conclude that instead of increasing the efficiency 
or equity of the use of NHS resources, NICE methodological guidelines may lead 
to: uncontrolled increases in NHS expenditures without evidence of any increase 
in total health improvements; increased inequities in the availability of 
services; and concerns about the sustainability of public funding for new 
technologies.

Unusual intraparenchymal growth patterns of malignant pleural mesothelioma.

Cardiff, UK.

AIMS: Malignant pleural mesothelioma is known to mimic morphologically a number 
of diverse reactive and neoplastic conditions. We describe three unusual 
intraparenchymal growth patterns of malignant mesothelioma seen in a series of 
200 malignant pleural mesotheliomas. The diagnostic pitfalls associated with 
these findings are described and their potential medico-legal implications are 
highlighted.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study group comprised 200 malignant pleural 
mesotheliomas. In each case diagnosis was morphologically confirmed with 
ancillary immunohistochemistry using a broad panel of both mesothelial and 
epithelial markers. The patterns of intraparenchymal growth were documented and 
grouped as: direct subpleural; lymphangitic; and other. The 200 malignant 
pleural mesotheliomas comprised 118 epithelioid, 57 biphasic and 25 sarcomatoid, 
subtyped according to the WHO classification. Direct subpleural invasion was 
seen in 42 cases, lymphangitic spread in 27 cases. Other less well-defined 
intraparenchymal patterns included three sarcomatoid subtype malignant 
mesotheliomas exhibiting an intra-alveolar growth pattern mimicking epithelioid 
haemangioendothelioma. One epithelioid subtype malignant mesothelioma contained 
an intraparenchymal tumour nodule microscopically comprising lepidic spread of 
neoplastic cells over maintained alveolar structures mimicking 
bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. One epithelioid subtype malignant mesothelioma 
morphologically had areas in which alveoli were distended by discohesive 
epithelioid neoplastic cells with no interstitial invasion. The appearances 
mimicked desquamative interstitial pneumonia. Immunohistochemistry played an 
important role in the definitive diagnosis of each unusual parenchymal tumour 
deposit. In 126 malignant mesotheliomas no invasion of the subjacent lung 
parenchyma was identified.
CONCLUSIONS: An awareness of the unusual parenchymal growth pattern in malignant 
mesothelioma is important to prevent misdiagnosis of other entities. In the 
medico-legal setting, the presence of epithelioid haemangioendothelioma or 
bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (in the absence of asbestosis) may be deemed to 
impact upon the patient's anticipated life expectancy and thereby would decrease 
the compensation settlement.
