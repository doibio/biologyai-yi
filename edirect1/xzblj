average follow-up of five years.
METHODS: The following data of 64 patients were retrospectively evaluated: 
fracture type, type and duration of surgical therapy, range of motion of the 
knee and ankle and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score. 
QoL was evaluated with the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire; pain 
intensity, patient satisfaction and impairments of daily, professional and sport 
activities with a ten point visual analogue scale.
RESULTS: QoL, even in cases with successfully completed treatment, was 
significantly reduced compared with the normal general population. Pain 
intensity and limited ankle dorsal extension, despite the absence of 
intra-articular fractures, were significantly correlated with inferior QoL.
CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasises the long-term negative impact of tibial 
nonunions on patient QoL, even after successful surgical treatment.

The Welfare Cost of Homicides in Brazil: Accounting for Heterogeneity in the 
Willingness to Pay for Mortality Reductions.

This paper estimates the health dimension of the welfare cost of homicides in 
Brazil incorporating age, gender, educational, and regional heterogeneities. We 
use a marginal willingness to pay approach to assign monetary values to the 
welfare cost of increased mortality due to violence. Results indicate that the 
present discounted value of the welfare cost of homicides in Brazil corresponds 
to roughly 78% of the GDP or, in terms of yearly flow, 2.3%. The analysis also 
shows that reliance on aggregate data to perform such calculations can lead to 
biases of around 20% in the estimated social cost of violence.

BACKGROUND: despite evidence on what works in falls prevention, falls in older 
people remain an important public health problem.
AIMS: the purpose of this study was to model the impact and cost-effectiveness 
of a public health falls prevention programme, from the perspective of the 
health funder.
METHODS: a decision analytic Markov model compared the health benefits in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs of treatment and residential aged 
care with and without a population heath falls prevention programme. Different 
intervention costs, uptake levels and programme effectiveness were modelled in 
sensitivity analyses. Uncertainty was explored using univariate and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: widespread rollout of a public health fall prevention programme could 
result in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $A28,931 per QALY 
gained, assuming a programme cost of $700 per person and at a fall prevention 
risk ratio of 0.75. This ICER would be considered cost-effective at a threshold 
value of $A50,000 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses for programme cost and 
effectiveness indicated that the public health programme produced greater health 
outcomes and was less costly than no programme when programme costs were $A500 
or lower and risk ratio for falls was 0.70 or lower. At a cost of $A2,500, the 
public health falls prevention programme ceases to be a cost-effective option.
CONCLUSION: serious consideration should be given to implementation of a public 
health programme of falls prevention as a cost-effective option that enables 
population-wide access to the intervention strategies.

National Blindness and Visual Impairment Study Group.

BACKGROUND: In Nigeria, urbanisation and increasing life expectancy are likely 
to increase the incidence of non-communicable diseases. As the epidemic of 
diabetes matures, visual loss from diabetic retinopathy (DR) will increase 
unless mechanisms for early detection and treatment improve, and health systems 
respond to the growing burden of non-communicable diseases.
METHODS: A nationally-representative population-based sample of 13,591 
participants aged ≥40 years selected by 
multistage-stratified-cluster-random-sampling with 
probability-proportional-to-size procedures were examined in 305 clusters in 
Nigeria between January 2005 to June 2007. All were asked about history of 
diabetes and underwent basic eye examination. Visual acuity (VA) was measured 
using logMAR E-chart. Participants with VA<6/12 and/or DR detected underwent 
detailed eye examination including dilated retinal examination and retinal 
photography. Systematic sampling of 1-in-7 gave a subsample (n=1759) examined in 
detail regardless of VA; and had random blood glucose (RBG) testing. Images were 
graded by Moorfields Eye Hospital Reading Centre. Participants were defined as 
having diabetes if they were previously diagnosed or RBG>11.1mmol/l or had DR. 
Data in the subsample were used to estimate the prevalence and to analyse risk 
factors for diabetes and DR using multivariable logistic regression. Additional 
information on the types of DR was obtained from participants not in the 
subsample.
RESULTS: In the subsample, 164 participants were excluded due to missing data; 
and 1,595 analysed. 52/1,595 had diabetes, a prevalence of 3.3% (95%CI 
2.5-4.3%); and 25/52(48%) did not know. Media opacity in 8/52 precluded retinal 
examination. 9/44(20.5%) had DR. Higher prevalence of diabetes was associated 
with urban residence (Odds ratio [OR]1.87) and overweight/obesity (OR3.02/4.43 
respectively). Although not statistically significant, DR was associated with 
hypertension (OR3.49) and RBG>15.0mmol/L (OR8.10). Persons with diabetes had 3 
times greater odds of blindness. Of 11,832 other participants in the study 
sample, 175(1.5%) had history of diabetes; 28 had DR. Types of DR (total=37) 
included 10.8% proliferative, 51.4% macular oedema.
CONCLUSION: The age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes in Nigeria was 3.25% (95%CI 
2.50-4.30) and over 10% of people with diabetes aged ≥40 years had 
sight-threatening-DR. These data will enable the development of better public 
health strategies for the control of diabetes and planning services for DR to 
prevent vision loss.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to estimate the 2-year life expectancy (2YLE) 
(estimated survival rate >50% at 2 years) in patients with critical limb 
ischemia (CLI) using the risk score based on predictors of all-cause mortality 
within 2 years.
BACKGROUND: It has been reported that 2YLE is one of the important factors in 
the decision making of the revascularization strategy. However, little is known 
about the probability and the prognostic factors of a 2YLE.
METHOD: This study was performed as a multicenter retrospective analysis. 
Between March 2004 and December 2011, 995 CLI patients with follow-up period 
>730 days undergoing endovascular therapy (EVT) were identified and analyzed.
RESULTS: Within 2 years, 412 patients (41%) died, and a cardiovascular cause 
accounted for 47% of deaths. On multivariate analysis, the independent 
prognostic factors were age 65 to 79 years (odds ratio [OR]: 1.9), 80 years of 
age or older (OR: 3.7), body mass index (BMI) 18.0 to 19.9 kg/m(2) (OR: 1.5), 
BMI <18.0 kg/m(2) (OR: 2.9), nonambulatory status (OR: 2.4), hemodialysis (OR: 
2.1), cerebrovascular disease (OR: 1.6), left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF) of 40% to 49% (OR: 1.8), LVEF <40% (OR: 2.6), Rutherford class 5 (OR: 
1.9), and Rutherford class 6 (OR: 3.4). The 2-year survival rate in each risk 
score was calculated based on each OR (full score: 15 points). After that, 2YLE 
was estimated based on the survival rate in each risk score, the probability of 
a 2YLE of ≥8 points indicated a <50% probability of 2-year survival.
CONCLUSIONS: The independent prognostic factors for the 2YLE were age, BMI, 
nonambulatory status, hemodialysis, cerebrovascular disease, LVEF, and tissue 
loss. A 2YLE score of ≥8 points indicated a <50% probability of 2-year survival. 
This score seemed to be helpful for identifying CLI patients with a poor 
prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Current American Heart Association guidelines recommend carotid 
revascularization for asymptomatic patients on the basis of life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the rates and predictors of 5-year survival in elderly 
patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis who underwent either carotid 
artery stent placement (CAS) or carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
METHODS: The rates of 5-year survival were determined by use of Kaplan-Meier 
survival methods in a representative sample of fee-for-service Medicare 
beneficiaries ≥65 years of age who underwent CAS or CEA for asymptomatic carotid 
artery stenosis with postprocedural follow-up of 3.4 ± 1.7 years. Cox 
proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the relative risk of all-cause 
mortality for patients in the presence of selected comorbidities, including 
ischemic heart disease, chronic renal failure, and atrial fibrillation, after 
adjustment for potential confounders such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and 
procedure type.
RESULTS: A total of 22,177 patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis 
were treated with either CAS (n = 2144) or CEA (n = 20,033). The overall 
estimated 5-year survival rate (±SE) was 95.3 ± 0.00149; it was 95.5% and 93.8% 
in patients treated with CEA and CAS, respectively. After adjustment for 
potential confounders, relative risk of all-cause 5-year mortality was 
significantly higher among patients with atrial fibrillation (relative risk, 
1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.1) and those with chronic renal failure 
(relative risk, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-2.6).
CONCLUSION: Risks and benefits must be carefully weighed before carotid 
revascularization in elderly patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis 
who have concurrent atrial fibrillation or chronic renal failure.

Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome without the characteristic facial features: a 
case report.

As a type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), vascular EDs (vEDS) is typified by a 
number of characteristic facial features (eg, large eyes, small chin, sunken 
cheeks, thin nose and lips, lobeless ears). However, vEDs does not typically 
display hypermobility of the large joints and skin hyperextensibility, which are 
features typical of the more common forms of EDS. Thus, colonic perforation or 
aneurysm rupture may be the first presentation of the disease. Because both 
complications are associated with a reduced life expectancy for individuals with 
this condition, an awareness of the clinical features of vEDS is important. 
Here, we describe the treatment of vEDS lacking the characteristic facial 
attributes in a 24-year-old healthy man who presented to the emergency room with 
abdominal pain. Enhanced computed tomography revealed diverticula and 
perforation in the sigmoid colon. The lesion of the sigmoid colon perforation 
was removed, and Hartmann procedure was performed. During the surgery, the 
control of bleeding was required because of vascular fragility. Subsequent 
molecular and genetic analysis was performed based on the suspected diagnosis of 
vEDS. These analyses revealed reduced type III collagen synthesis in cultured 
skin fibroblasts and identified a previously undocumented mutation in the gene 
for a1 type III collagen, confirming the diagnosis of vEDS. After eliciting a 
detailed medical profile, we learned his mother had a history of extensive 
bruising since childhood and idiopathic hematothorax. Both were prescribed oral 
celiprolol. One year after admission, the patient was free of recurrent 
perforation. This case illustrates an awareness of the clinical characteristics 
of vEDS and the family history is important because of the high mortality from 
this condition even in young people. Importantly, genetic assays could help in 
determining the surgical procedure and offer benefits to relatives since this 
condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

Does government oversight improve access to nursing home care? Longitudinal 
evidence from US counties.

Author information:

Gains in life expectancy around the world have increasingly placed pressure on 
governments to ensure that the elderly receive assistance with activities of 
daily living. This research examines the impact of government oversight of 
Medicaid payment policies on access to nursing home care services in the United 
States. Variation in price levels induced by a federal policy shift in 1997 is 
used to identify the effect of Medicaid reimbursements on the number of nursing 
homes and beds available. Court rulings prior to the policy change are used to 
categorically define a range of oversight treatments at the state level. 
Difference-in-differences estimates indicate a significant decline in access to 
nursing home care services for individuals living in states in which courts 
consistently ruled that Medicaid reimbursements did not meet the minimum 
standard implied by federal law. The findings suggest that nursing home care 
services were made more accessible through a combination of legislative and 
judicial oversight of Medicaid payment policies.

BACKGROUND: To analyze and compare the economic outcomes of adjuvant 
chemotherapy with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (referred to as the XELOX 
strategy) and of S-1 (the S-1 strategy) for gastric cancer patients after D2 
gastrectomy.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the lifetime disease course 
associated with stage II or III gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy. The 
lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), associated costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated. The clinical data were derived 
from the results of pilot studies. Direct costs were estimated from the 
perspective of the Chinese healthcare system, and the utility data were measured 
from end-point observations of Chinese patients. Sensitivity analyses were used 
to explore the impact of uncertainty on the model's outcomes.
RESULTS: The combined adjuvant chemotherapy strategy with XELOX yielded the 
greatest increase in QALYs over the course of the disease (8.1 QALYs compared 
with 7.8 QALYs for the S-1 strategy and 6.2 for surgery alone). The incremental 
cost per QALY gained using the XELOX strategy was significantly lower than that 
for the S-1 strategy ($3,502 vs. $6,837, respectively). The results were 
sensitive to the costs of oxaliplatin and the hazard ratio of relapse-free 
survival.
CONCLUSION: The observations reported herein suggest that adjuvant therapy with 
capecitabine plus oxaliplatin is a highly cost-effective strategy and more 
favorable treatment option than the S-1 strategy in patients with stage II or 
III gastric cancer who have undergone D2 gastrectomy.

Biological therapies for the treatment of severe psoriasis in patients with 
previous exposure to biological therapy: a cost-effectiveness analysis.

BACKGROUND: Biologic therapies have revolutionised the care of patients with 
psoriasis, although they come at significant extra cost. Guidance on their use 
in the UK National Health Service (NHS) has so far focused on patients who are 
"biologic naive", yet a minority of patients have poor response and require 
further treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential cost effectiveness of sequential biologic 
therapies in patients with psoriasis who have been exposed to previous biologic 
therapy.
METHODS: A two-part model with a 10-year time horizon was built to model an 
initial 13.5-week "trial" phase and a longer-term "treatment" period with annual 
Markov cycles. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) response rates from 
subgroup analyses of three randomised placebo-controlled trials evaluating 
biologic agents were considered. A meta-analysis of these data provided 
probabilities of achieving PASI response (50/75/90) in the short term, and 
published evidence and assumptions were used to predict outcomes over the longer 
term. Benefits were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs 
(2013-14) to the UK NHS included drugs, administration, monitoring, and 
hospitalisation. Costs and benefits were discounted 3.5 % per annum. Cost 
effectiveness of sequential biologic therapy was measured using an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared to best supportive care (BSC). 
Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of 
alternative assumptions on the results.
RESULTS: Results indicate that over 10 years, switching to a second biologic 
following intolerance to or failure of a first is likely to generate more QALYs 
than BSC, but at a higher cost. Base case results suggest the ICER of the second 
biologic compared to BSC is £17,681 per QALY; however, sensitivity analyses 
indicate that changes in the efficacy of BSC, drug costs, dropout rates, and 
rates of hospitalisation have a significant impact, causing the ICER to range 
from less than £10,000 to over £50,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Further biologic therapy for patients with psoriasis who have 
previously been treated with biologic therapy may be cost effective, although 
there is considerable uncertainty in the results. Future studies should be 
designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of biologic therapies in this 
subgroup with particular attention given to short-term and longer-term 
responses.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX(®)) for the management 
of urinary incontinence in adults with neurogenic detrusor overactivity: a UK 
perspective.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX(®), 
200 units [200 U]) for the management of urinary incontinence (UI) in adults 
with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) due to subcervical spinal cord 
injury or multiple sclerosis that is not adequately managed with anticholinergic 
drugs (ACHDs).
PERSPECTIVE: UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective.
METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed, which compared 
onabotulinumtoxinA + best supportive care (BSC) with BSC alone (comprising 
behavioural therapy and pads, alone or in combination with clean intermittent 
catheterization and possibly with ACHDs). Non-responders were eligible for 
invasive procedures. Health states were defined according to the reduction in UI 
episodes. Efficacy data and estimates of resource utilization were pooled from 
468 patients on onabotulinumtoxinA in two phase III clinical trials. Drug costs 
(2013) and administration costs (NHS Reference Costs 2011-2012) were obtained 
from published sources. The time horizon of the model was 5 years, and costs and 
benefits were discounted at 3.5%. Scenario, one-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were conducted to explore uncertainties around the 
assumptions.
RESULTS: In the base case, treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA + BSC over 5 years 
was associated with an increase in costs of £1,689 and an increase in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 0.4, compared with BSC alone, resulting 
in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £3,850 per QALY gained. 
Sensitivity analyses showed that utility values had the greatest influence on 
model results. PSA suggests that onabotulinumtoxinA + BSC had a 100 % 
probability of being cost effective at a willingness to pay of <£20,000.
CONCLUSION: For adult patients with NDO who are not adequately managed with 
ACHDs, onabotulinumtoxinA + BSC appears to be a cost-effective use of resources 
in the UK NHS.

BACKGROUND: Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) and intestinal transplantation (ITx) 
are the 2 treatment options for irreversible intestinal failure (IF).
OBJECTIVE: This study simulated the disease course of irreversible IF and both 
of these treatments--HPN and ITx--to estimate the cost-effectiveness of ITx.
DESIGN: We simulated IF treatment in adults as a discrete event model with 
variables derived from the Dutch Registry of Intestinal Failure and Intestinal 
Transplantation, the Intestinal Transplant Registry, hospital records, the 
literature, and expert opinions. Simulated patients were enrolled at a rate of 
40/mo for 10 y. The maximum follow-up was 40 y. Survival was simulated as a 
probabilistic function. ITx was offered to 10% of patients with <12 mo of 
remaining life expectancy with HPN if they did not undergo ITx. Costs were 
calculated according to Dutch guidelines, with discounting. We evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of ITx by comparing models conducted with and without ITx and 
by calculating the cost difference per life-year gained [incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)].
RESULTS: The average survival was 14.6 y without ITx and 14.9 y with ITx. HPN 
costs were €13,276 for treatment introduction, followed by €77,652 annually. The 
costs of ITx were ∼€73,000 during the first year and then €13,000 annually. The 
ICER was €19,529 per life-year gained.
CONCLUSION: Our simulations show that ITx slightly improves survival of patients 
with IF in comparison with HPN at an additional cost of €19,529 per life-year 
gained.

BACKGROUND: Centralized silos of genomic data are architecturally easier to 
initially design, develop and deploy than distributed models. However, as 
interoperability pains in EHR/EMR, HIE and other collaboration-centric life 
sciences domains have taught us, the core challenge of networking genomics 
systems is not in the construction of individual silos, but the interoperability 
of those deployments in a manner embracing the heterogeneous needs, terms and 
infrastructure of collaborating parties. This article demonstrates the 
adaptation of BitTorrent to private collaboration networks in an authenticated, 
authorized and encrypted manner while retaining the same characteristics of 
standard BitTorrent.
RESULTS: The BitTorious portal was sucessfully used to manage many concurrent 
domestic Bittorrent clients across the United States: exchanging genomics data 
payloads in excess of 500GiB using the uTorrent client software on Linux, OSX 
and Windows platforms. Individual nodes were sporadically interrupted to verify 
the resilience of the system to outages of a single client node as well as 
recovery of nodes resuming operation on intermittent Internet connections.
CONCLUSIONS: The authorization-based extension of Bittorrent and accompanying 
BitTorious reference tracker and user management web portal provide a free, 
standards-based, general purpose and extensible data distribution system for 
large 'omics collaborations.

BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication of critical 
illness with important clinical consequences. The Prophylaxis for 
ThromboEmbolism in Critical Care Trial (PROTECT) is a multicenter, blinded, 
randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of the two most common 
pharmocoprevention strategies, unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular 
weight heparin (LMWH) dalteparin, in medical-surgical patients in the intensive 
care unit (ICU). E-PROTECT is a prospective and concurrent economic evaluation 
of the PROTECT trial.
METHODS/DESIGN: The primary objective of E-PROTECT is to identify and quantify 
the total (direct and indirect, variable and fixed) costs associated with the 
management of critically ill patients participating in the PROTECT trial, and, 
to combine costs and outcome results to determine the incremental 
cost-effectiveness of LMWH versus UFH, from the acute healthcare system 
perspective, over a data-rich time horizon of ICU admission and hospital 
admission. We derive baseline characteristics and probabilities of in-ICU and 
in-hospital events from all enrolled patients. Total costs are derived from 
centers, proportional to the numbers of patients enrolled in each country. 
Direct costs include medication, physician and other personnel costs, diagnostic 
radiology and laboratory testing, operative and non-operative procedures, costs 
associated with bleeding, transfusions and treatment-related complications. 
Indirect costs include ICU and hospital ward overhead costs. Outcomes are the 
ratio of incremental costs per incremental effects of LMWH versus UFH during 
hospitalization; incremental cost to prevent a thrombosis at any site (primary 
outcome); incremental cost to prevent a pulmonary embolism, deep vein 
thrombosis, major bleeding event or episode of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia 
(secondary outcomes) and incremental cost per life-year gained (tertiary 
outcome). Pre-specified subgroups and sensitivity analyses will be performed and 
confidence intervals for the estimates of incremental cost-effectiveness will be 
obtained using bootstrapping.
DISCUSSION: This economic evaluation employs a prospective costing methodology 
concurrent with a randomized controlled blinded clinical trial, with a 
pre-specified analytic plan, outcome measures, subgroup and sensitivity 
analyses. This economic evaluation has received only peer-reviewed funding and 
funders will not play a role in the generation, analysis or decision to submit 
the manuscripts for publication.

BACKGROUND: Up-to-date evidence on levels and trends for age-sex-specific 
all-cause and cause-specific mortality is essential for the formation of global, 
regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 
2013 (GBD 2013) we estimated yearly deaths for 188 countries between 1990, and 
2013. We used the results to assess whether there is epidemiological convergence 
across countries.
METHODS: We estimated age-sex-specific all-cause mortality using the GBD 2010 
methods with some refinements to improve accuracy applied to an updated database 
of vital registration, survey, and census data. We generally estimated cause of 
death as in the GBD 2010. Key improvements included the addition of more recent 
vital registration data for 72 countries, an updated verbal autopsy literature 
review, two new and detailed data systems for China, and more detail for Mexico, 
UK, Turkey, and Russia. We improved statistical models for garbage code 
redistribution. We used six different modelling strategies across the 240 
causes; cause of death ensemble modelling (CODEm) was the dominant strategy for 
causes with sufficient information. Trends for Alzheimer's disease and other 
dementias were informed by meta-regression of prevalence studies. For 
pathogen-specific causes of diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections we used a 
counterfactual approach. We computed two measures of convergence (inequality) 
across countries: the average relative difference across all pairs of countries 
(Gini coefficient) and the average absolute difference across countries. To 
summarise broad findings, we used multiple decrement life-tables to decompose 
probabilities of death from birth to exact age 15 years, from exact age 15 years 
to exact age 50 years, and from exact age 50 years to exact age 75 years, and 
life expectancy at birth into major causes. For all quantities reported, we 
computed 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We constrained cause-specific 
fractions within each age-sex-country-year group to sum to all-cause mortality 
based on draws from the uncertainty distributions.
FINDINGS: Global life expectancy for both sexes increased from 65.3 years (UI 
65.0-65.6) in 1990, to 71.5 years (UI 71.0-71.9) in 2013, while the number of 
deaths increased from 47.5 million (UI 46.8-48.2) to 54.9 million (UI 53.6-56.3) 
over the same interval. Global progress masked variation by age and sex: for 
children, average absolute differences between countries decreased but relative 
differences increased. For women aged 25-39 years and older than 75 years and 
for men aged 20-49 years and 65 years and older, both absolute and relative 
differences increased. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy 
showed the prominent role of reductions in age-standardised death rates for 
cardiovascular diseases and cancers in high-income regions, and reductions in 
child deaths from diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and neonatal causes 
in low-income regions. HIV/AIDS reduced life expectancy in southern sub-Saharan 
Africa. For most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and 
age-standardised death rates fell whereas for most non-communicable causes, 
demographic shifts have increased numbers of deaths but decreased 
age-standardised death rates. Global deaths from injury increased by 10.7%, from 
4.3 million deaths in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates 
declined over the same period by 21%. For some causes of more than 100,000 
deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 
2013, including HIV/AIDS, pancreatic cancer, atrial fibrillation and flutter, 
drug use disorders, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and sickle-cell anaemias. 
Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes, and malaria 
are still in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The 
most important pathogens are rotavirus for diarrhoea and pneumococcus for lower 
respiratory infections. Country-specific probabilities of death over three 
phases of life were substantially varied between and within regions.
INTERPRETATION: For most countries, the general pattern of reductions in age-sex 
specific mortality has been associated with a progressive shift towards a larger 
share of the remaining deaths caused by non-communicable disease and injuries. 
Assessing epidemiological convergence across countries depends on whether an 
absolute or relative measure of inequality is used. Nevertheless, 
age-standardised death rates for seven substantial causes are increasing, 
suggesting the potential for reversals in some countries. Important gaps exist 
in the empirical data for cause of death estimates for some countries; for 
example, no national data for India are available for the past decade.

OBJECTIVES: Economic evaluation is becoming more common and important as new 
biologic therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are developed. While much has 
been published about how to design cost-utility models for RA to conduct these 
evaluations, less has been written about the sources of data populating those 
models. The goal is to review the literature and to provide recommendations for 
future data collection efforts.
METHODS: This study reviewed RA cost-utility models published between January 
2006 and February 2014 focusing on five key sources of data (health-related 
quality-of-life and utility, clinical outcomes, disease progression, course of 
treatment, and healthcare resource use and costs). It provided recommendations 
for collecting the appropriate data during clinical and other studies to support 
modeling of biologic treatments for RA.
RESULTS: Twenty-four publications met the selection criteria. Almost all used 
two steps to convert clinical outcomes data to utilities rather than more direct 
methods; most did not use clinical outcomes measures that captured absolute 
levels of disease activity and physical functioning; one-third of them, in 
contrast with clinical reality, assumed zero disease progression for 
biologic-treated patients; little more than half evaluated courses of treatment 
reflecting guideline-based or actual clinical care; and healthcare resource use 
and cost data were often incomplete.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, it is recommended that future studies 
collect clinical outcomes and health-related quality-of-life data using 
appropriate instruments that can convert directly to utilities; collect data on 
actual disease progression; be designed to capture real-world courses of 
treatment; and collect detailed data on a wide range of healthcare resources and 
costs.
