factors associated with face-to-face interventions; 4) assessing short-term 
(days), long-term (months), and cumulative effects of expectancy interventions; 
and 5) investigating possible mechanisms of change. Randomization and expectancy 
interventions can be realized by the app (e.g., after the clinic/lab visit). As 
a result, studies can be blinded without the possibility for the clinician to 
influence study outcomes. Possible app-based expectancy interventions include, 
for example, verbal suggestions and imagery exercises, although a large number 
of possible interventions (e.g., hypnosis) could be evaluated using this 
innovative approach.

PURPOSE: Obesity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Weight 
loss due to gastric bypass (GBP) surgery improves clinical outcomes and may be a 
cost-effective intervention. To estimate the cost-effectiveness of GBP compared 
to clinical treatment in severely obese individuals with and without diabetes in 
the perspective of the Brazilian public health system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare costs and 
outcomes of gastric bypass in an open approach to clinical treatment. Health 
states were living with diabetes, remission of diabetes, non-fatal and fatal 
myocardial infarction, and death. We also included the occurrence of 
complications related to surgery and plastic surgery after the gastric bypass 
surgery. The direct costs were obtained from primary data collection performed 
in three public reference centers for obesity treatment. Utility values also 
derived from this cohort, while transition probabilities came from the 
international literature. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate 
uncertainties. The model considered a 10-year time horizon and a 5% discount 
rate.
RESULTS: Over 10 years, GBP increased quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and 
costs compared to clinical treatment, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Int$1820.17/QALY and Int$1937.73/QALY in 
individuals with and without diabetes, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed 
that utility values and direct costs of treatments were the parameters that 
affected the most the ICERs.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that GBP is a cost-effective intervention for 
severely obese individuals in the Brazilian public health system perspective, 
with a better result in individuals with diabetes.

The recent advances in pharmaceutical industry in the area of drug delivery and 
development have resulted into wide variety of biomolecules, particularly 
peptides and proteins, to palliate the treatment for severe diseases. The 
rampant development of peptides and proteins in industry mandate the 
understanding of their characteristic nature and developability. Despite their 
therapeutic potential, peptides and proteins pose complex challenges in drug 
delivery and require scientist to contemplate to achieve suitable delivery 
system. As most of the commercial products for proteins and peptides are 
available as a parenteral delivery and freeze drying process is one commonly 
used technique, it is imperative to understand the complex steps of development 
for better and faster product development. This review provides an overview of 
the stability and formulation development for peptides and proteins. The most 
common route for protein delivery, parenteral, has been focused on parenteral 
solution and lyophilization as formulation strategy. Additionally, new drug 
delivery and half-life extension approaches will further the reach of this 
unique class of molecules. Efforts are underway to explore the area with new 
technologies and development.

When the primary outcome is difficult to collect, a surrogate endpoint is 
typically used as a substitute. It is possible that for every individual, the 
treatment has a positive effect on the surrogate, and the surrogate has a 
positive effect on the primary outcome, but for some individuals, the treatment 
has a negative effect on the primary outcome. For example, a treatment may be 
substantially effective in preventing the stroke for everyone, and lowering the 
risk of stroke is universally beneficial for life expectancy; however, the 
treatment may still cause death for some individuals. We define such paradoxical 
phenomenon as the individual surrogate paradox. The individual surrogate paradox 
is proposed to capture the treatment effect heterogeneity, which is unable to be 
described by either the surrogate paradox based on average causal effect or that 
based on distributional causal effect. We investigate the existing surrogate 
criteria in terms of whether the individual surrogate paradox could manifest. We 
find that only the strong binary surrogate can avoid such paradox without 
additional assumptions. Utilizing the sharp bounds, we propose novel criteria to 
exclude the individual surrogate paradox. Our methods are illustrated in an 
application to determine the effect of the intensive glycemia on the risk of 
development or progression of diabetic retinopathy.

Robots.

Stretchability and durability are imperative features for many electronic skins 
of soft robots, particularly those involving high deformability, cyclic gaits, 
confined space traverse, rough terrain navigation, and frequent human-robot 
interaction. This article reports on the design, fabrication, and 
characterization of highly stretchable and durable interconnections based on 
conductive knitted fabrics for the skins of soft robots. The core-spun yarn 
containing an ultrafine metal wire (core diameter: 50 μm) fabricated using a 
newly developed vortex spinning technology is employed as the conductive trace 
and is integrated into rib-knitted fabrics together with two types of elastic 
composite yarns-an elastic filament yarn and an elastic vortex core-spun yarn, 
respectively. Owing to the structures and properties of the yarns and fabrics, 
the electrical resistance of the fabrics remains stable at a maximum strain of 
425% in unidirectional tensile test and a maximum average membrane strain of 
300% in three-dimensional deformation. The fabrics exhibit a fatigue life 
greater than 1,200,000 loading cycles at 20% tensile strain and 10,000 abrasion 
cycles. Application of the fabrics is demonstrated by covering an origami 
paper-fabric composite-based soft extension actuator with the fabric. 
Performance of the developed conductive knitted fabrics indicates that they have 
potential to find application in the electronic skins of soft robots.

Mastocytosis is a hematopoietic neoplasm defined by abnormal expansion and focal 
accumulation of clonal tissue mast cells in various organ-systems. The disease 
exhibits a complex pathology and an equally complex clinical behavior. The 
classification of the World Health Organization (WHO) divides mastocytosis into 
cutaneous forms, systemic variants, and localized mast cell tumors. In >80% of 
patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM), a somatic point mutation in KIT at 
codon 816 is found. Whereas patients with indolent forms of the disease have a 
normal or near-normal life expectancy, patients with advanced mast cell 
neoplasms, including aggressive SM and mast cell leukemia, have a poor prognosis 
with short survival times. In a majority of these patients, multiple somatic 
mutations and/or an associated hematologic neoplasm, such as a myeloid leukemia, 
may be detected. Independent of the category of mastocytosis and the serum 
tryptase level, patients may suffer from mediator-related symptoms and/or 
osteopathy. Depending on the presence of co-morbidities, the symptomatology in 
such patients may be mild, severe or even life-threatening. Most relevant 
co-morbidities in such patients are IgE-dependent allergies, psychiatric, 
psychological or mental problems, and vitamin D deficiency. The diagnosis and 
management of mastocytosis is an emerging challenge in clinical practice and 
requires vast knowledge, a multidisciplinary approach, and personalized medicine 
procedures. In this article, the current knowledge about mastocytosis is 
reviewed with special emphasis on the multidisciplinary aspects of the disease 
and related challenges in daily practice.

The quality of life expectancy estimates is one key consideration for an 
investor in life settlements. The predominant metric for assessing this quality 
is the so-called A-to-E ratio, which relies on a comparison of the actual to the 
predicted number of deaths. In this article, we explain key issues with this 
metric: In the short run, it is subject to estimation uncertainty for small and 
moderately sized portfolios; and, more critically, in the long run, it converges 
to 100% even if the underwriting is systematically biased. As an alternative, we 
propose and discuss a set of new metrics based on the difference in (temporary) 
life expectancies. We examine the underwriting quality of a leading U.S. life 
expectancy provider based on this new methodology.

BACKGROUND: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) have a reduced life 
expectancy and quality of life (QoL), owing to advanced age and the presence of 
multiple comorbidities. Currently, there is no AS-specific QoL measurement tool, 
which prevents an accurate assessment of how this chronic condition and its 
treatment affect patients. The Toronto Aortic Stenosis Quality of Life 
Questionnaire (TASQ) was developed in order to address this deficiency.
METHODS: The present trial protocol was designed to enable validation of the 
TASQ, which has been produced in five languages (English, French, German, 
Italian and Spanish) to increase usability. Patients with severe AS who are 
undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic 
valve implantation (TAVI) will be asked to complete the TASQ and, for 
comparative purposes, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and the 
general health-related QoL Short Form-12 questionnaire. The questionnaires will 
be completed prior to the intervention, at discharge, as well as at 30 days and 
3 months follow-up. A total of 290 patients will be recruited across one 
Canadian and nine European centres. Overall, the protocol validation aims to 
include 120 patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI (TF-TAVI), 120 undergoing SAVR 
and up to 50 being treated medically. The primary objective of the registry is 
to validate the TASQ in five different languages. The secondary objective is to 
assess the utility of the TASQ for assessing differences in QoL outcome between 
patients undergoing TF-TAVI, SAVR or medical management for their AS.
DISCUSSION: Validation and roll-out of the TASQ will enable clinicians to 
capture an accurate assessment of how AS and its management affects the QoL of 
patients and will help them to determine the most appropriate treatment strategy 
for individual patients.

AIMS: The aims of this systematic scoping review were to characterize the extent 
to which diabetes prevention programs have focused on rural populations in North 
America and where possible, identify efficacious program components.
METHODS: The review was guided by the PRISMA statement and five steps for 
scoping studies. Searches were conducted in August 2017 in Tucson, Arizona. Two 
teams of three independently screened full texts, excluding prior reviews, 
systematic reviews, and opinion pieces. Two authors abstracted data, which were 
reviewed by other team members.
RESULTS: Of the 12,840 articles identified, 12 met all criteria. Nine studies 
were based in the USA and three were Canadian. Demographics reflected high 
enrollment of underrepresented minorities, adults, and females. Methodological 
rigor was low; most studies were single-arm interventions evaluated using 
pre-/post-measures. Weight was measured across all studies, although biological, 
behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes were inconsistently assessed. Eight 
studies reported significant changes in primary outcomes. Duration and intensity 
were variable; delivery was led by trained volunteers or health professionals. 
Seven studies reported recruitment, retention, and adherence data.
CONCLUSIONS: Surprisingly, few rural diabetes prevention studies have been 
published. Published programs were notable for lack of youth and/or family 
involvement, integrated prevention and treatment programs, and heavy reliance on 
self-reported outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The TOWER and INO-VATE-ALL trials demonstrated the 
efficacy and safety of blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin (inotuzumab), 
respectively, versus standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy in adults with relapsed 
or refractory (R/R) B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The 
cost effectiveness of blinatumomab versus inotuzumab has not previously been 
examined.
METHODS: Cost effectiveness of blinatumomab versus inotuzumab in R/R B-cell 
precursor ALL patients with one or no prior salvage therapy from a United States 
(US) payer perspective was estimated using a partitioned survival model. Health 
outcomes were estimated based on published aggregate data from INO-VATE-ALL and 
individual patient data from TOWER weighted to match patients in INO-VATE-ALL 
using matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). Analyses were conducted 
using five approaches relating to use of anchored versus unanchored comparisons 
of health outcomes and, for the anchored comparisons, the reference treatment to 
which treatment effects on health outcomes were applied. Estimates from TOWER 
including the probabilities of complete remission and allogeneic stem-cell 
transplant (allo-SCT), overall and event-free survival, utilities, duration of 
therapy, and use of subsequent therapies were MAIC adjusted to match 
INO-VATE-ALL. Costs of treatment, adverse events, allo-SCT, subsequent 
therapies, and terminal care were from published sources. A 50-year time horizon 
and 3% annual discount rate were used.
RESULTS: Incremental costs for blinatumomab versus inotuzumab ranged from 
US$7023 to US$36,244, depending on the approach used for estimating relative 
effectiveness. Incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) ranged from 0.54 
to 1.78. Cost effectiveness for blinatumomab versus inotuzumab ranged from 
US$4006 to US$20,737 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Blinatumomab is estimated to be cost effective versus inotuzumab in 
R/R B-cell precursor ALL adults who have received one or no prior salvage 
therapy from a US payer perspective.

Erratum in
    Drugs. 2019 Aug 23;:

Damoctocog alfa pegol (Jivi®) is approved in the USA, EU, Japan and Canada for 
the treatment and prophylaxis of previously treated patients aged ≥ 12 years 
with haemophilia A. Formulated with a 60 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety, 
damoctocog alfa pegol is an intravenously (IV) administered recombinant factor 
VIII (rFVIII) product with a longer terminal half-life than non-PEGylated FVIII 
and rFVIII products. In the multinational phase II/III PROTECT VIII trial, 
prophylaxis with damoctocog alfa pegol reduced the likelihood of bleeding in 
previously treated patients aged ≥ 12 years with severe haemophilia A, with 
dosing schedules ranging from twice weekly to once every 7 days. Interim data 
from the ongoing extension phase indicated that the reduced annualized bleeding 
rates (ABRs) were maintained for up to 5.2 years of prophylaxis with damoctocog 
alfa pegol. Damoctocog alfa pegol was also effective in treating bleeding 
episodes and in providing haemostatic control during surgery. Damoctocog alfa 
pegol was generally well tolerated in adult and adolescent patients with severe 
haemophilia A, with most adverse events considered to be unrelated to treatment. 
There were no new or confirmed cases of FVIII inhibitor development and anti-PEG 
antibodies, observed in some patients, were of low titre and transient. 
Damoctocog alfa pegol extends the available treatment options in previously 
treated adults and adolescents with haemophilia A, offering the possibility of 
up to once-weekly administration for suitable patients.

BACKGROUND: State-specific disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are seldom 
calculated. Understanding the health and disease trends in groups of states is 
useful for finding the heterogeneity of disease epidemiology in the country.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess dengue burden in Kerala 
state, using DALY.
METHODS: DALY was computed using the DALY package of R. Incidence was derived 
using reported and estimated dengue cases for 2006-2016. Mortality was 
calculated using reported deaths. We computed DALYs using the mortality 
estimates for the South-East Asia region (SEAR) also. Sensitivity and scenario 
analyses were done.
RESULTS: The highest estimated relative DALY for dengue is 7.22 (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 6.66-7.72) per lakh population. The DALY obtained using the 
mortality rates of SEAR ranged from 19.89 (95% CI: 8.44-29.45) per lakh 
population to 28.56 (95% CI: 17.04-38.05). We observed a cyclical pattern of 
increase in DALY every 2-3 years. The DALY in lower age groups is lesser. DALY 
in females was higher than males.
CONCLUSIONS: The dengue-related DALY for the state of Kerala is lower than that 
of the global burden of disease due to lower mortality rates. Mortality 
reduction becomes the key to reducing burden, especially in areas of low 
incidence. The study also forms the benchmark for evaluating and implementing 
cost-effective measures for dengue control in the state.

Objectives: This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan 
versus enalapril in patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction (HFrEF).Methods: We used a previously developed Markov model 
calibrated with patient-level data from the PARADIGM-HF trial, adapted to the 
Portuguese setting. The model considers two health states (alive or dead) and 
uses regression analyzes to estimate hospitalizations and deaths over time. A 
panel of experts estimated resource consumption in the outpatient setting. To 
estimate resource consumption with hospitalizations, the National Health Service 
Diagnosis Related Groups database was used. Unit costs were based on national 
legislation, and on the Infomed database. The model considers a societal 
perspective, a time horizon of 30-years, and a 5% annual discount rate. 
Sensitivity analyses assessed the robustness of results.Results: 
Sacubitril/valsartan increases life expectancy by 0.5 life-years, corresponding 
to 0.4 incremental quality adjusted life-years (QALY) versus enalapril. The 
estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is 22,702€/QALY. 
Sensitivity analysis shows that results are robust, but sensitive to the 
parameter estimates of the cardiovascular survival curve.Conclusion: 
Sacubitril/valsartan is a cost-effective therapeutic option in the treatment of 
Portuguese patients with HFrEF and translate into significant health gains and 
increased life expectancy versus the current standard of care.

BACKGROUND: Adopting a healthy lifestyle is associated with prolonged life 
expectancy. The main modifiable lifestyle-related risk factors are hazardous 
alcohol drinking, smoking, excess body weight and lack of physical activity. Our 
aim was to estimate the impact of unfavourable lifestyle factors on 
abnormalities in laboratory tests reflecting liver status, inflammation and 
lipid metabolism in a population-based cross-sectional study.
METHODS: The study included 22,273 participants (10,561 men, 11,712 women) aged 
25-74 years from the National FINRISK Study. Data on alcohol use, smoking, body 
weight, and physical activity were recorded from structured interviews. The risk 
scores for the various life style factors were established on a 0-8 scale and 
used to stratify the population in classes to allow estimates of their joint 
effects. Serum liver enzymes (GGT, ALT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipid 
profiles were measured using standard laboratory techniques.
RESULTS: Consistent dose-response relationships were observed between the number 
of unfavourable risk factors and serum levels of GGT, ALT, CRP, cholesterol, 
HDL, LDL and triglycerides (p < 0.0005 for linear trend in all comparisons). 
When compared with those with zero risk factors, the multivariable-adjusted odds 
ratios (ORs) for abnormalities in all biomarkers were significantly higher in 
those with a sum of risk score two or more. The most striking increases in ORs 
in the group with the highest numbers of risk factors were observed among men in 
serum GGT: 26.6 (12.4-57.0), ALT: 40.3 (5.3-307.8), CRP: 16.2 (7.8-33.7) and 
serum triglycerides: 14.4 (8.6-24.0).
CONCLUSIONS: The data support the view that the presence of unfavourable life 
style risk factors is associated with distinct abnormalities in laboratory tests 
for liver function, inflammation and lipid status. Such biomarkers may prove to 
be of value in the assessment of interventions aimed at reducing unfavourable 
risk factors and in helping individuals in long-term maintenance of lifestyle 
modifications.

BACKGROUND: The long-term effectiveness of group continence promotion delivered 
via community organisations on female urinary incontinence, falls and healthy 
life expectancy remains unknown.
METHODS: A pragmatic cluster randomised trial was conducted among 909 women aged 
65-98 years with urinary incontinence, recruited from 377 community 
organisations in the UK, Canada and France. A total of 184 organisations were 
randomised to an in-person 60-min incontinence self-management workshop (461 
participants), and 193 to a control healthy ageing workshop (448 participants). 
The primary outcome was self-reported incontinence improvement at 1-year. Falls 
and gains in health utility were secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: A total 751 women, mean age 78.0, age range 65-98 completed the trial 
(83%). At 1-year, 15% of the intervention group versus 6.9% of controls reported 
significant improvements in urinary symptoms, (difference 8.1%, 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) 4.0-12.1%, intracluster correlation 0.04, number-needed-to-treat 
13) and 35% versus 19% reported any improvement (risk difference 16.0%, 95% CI 
10.4-21.5, number-needed-to-treat 6). The proportion of fallers decreased from 
42% to 36% in the intervention group (-8.0%, 95% CI -14.8 - -1.0) and from 44% 
to 34% in the control group (-10.3%, 95% CI -17.4 - -3.6), no difference between 
groups. Both intervention and control groups experienced a gain in health 
utility (0.022 points (95% CI 0.005-0.04) versus 0.035 (95% CI 0.017-0.052), 
respectively), with no significant difference between groups.
CONCLUSION: Community-based group continence promotion achieves long-term 
benefits on older women's urinary symptoms, without improvement in falls or 
healthy life expectancy compared with participation in a healthy ageing 
workshop.

All-cause and cause-specific mortality in Scotland 1981-2011 by age, sex and 
deprivation: a population-based study.

BACKGROUND: Average life expectancy has stopped increasing for many countries. 
This has been attributed to causes such as influenza, austerity policies and 
deaths of despair (drugs, alcohol and suicide). Less is known on the inequality 
of life expectancy over time using reliable, whole population, data. This work 
examines all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates in Scotland to assess the 
patterning of relative and absolute inequalities across three decades.
METHODS: Using routinely collected Scottish mortality and population records we 
calculate directly age-standardized mortality rates by age group, sex and 
deprivation fifths for all-cause and cause-specific deaths around each census 
1981-2011.
RESULTS: All-cause mortality rates in the most deprived areas in 2011 (472 per 
100 000 population) remained higher than in the least deprived in 1981 (422 per 
100 000 population). For those aged 0-64, deaths from circulatory causes more 
than halved between 1981 and 2011 and cancer mortality decreased by a third 
(with greater relative declines in the least deprived areas). Over the same 
period, alcohol- and drug-related causes and male suicide increased (with 
greater absolute and relative increases in more deprived areas). There was also 
a significant increase in deaths from dementia and Alzheimer's disease for those 
aged 75+.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite reductions in mortality, relative (but not absolute) 
inequalities widened between 1981 and 2011 for all-cause mortality and for 
several causes of death. Reducing relative inequalities in Scotland requires 
faster mortality declines in deprived areas while countering increases in 
mortality from causes such as drug- and alcohol-related harm and male suicide.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Carriers of pathogenic variants in CDH1 have a high risk of 
hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Guidelines recommend prophylactic 
total gastrectomy (PTG) at age 20-30 years, although there is controversy over 
the optimal age. We developed a simulation model to analyze the effects of PTG 
at different ages on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), cancer mortality, and 
life expectancy.
METHODS: We used a Markov model of HDGC progression associated with pathogenic 
variants in CDH1 to simulate outcomes of hypothetical cohorts with different 
ages at time of PTG (ages 20-79 years). Model inputs including health state 
transition probabilities, mortality and complication rates, quality of life 
utility values, and endoscopic surveillance sensitivity were derived from 
publications. The primary outcome, used to determine the optimal strategy, was 
age at which PTG yielded the highest QALYs. Secondary outcomes were cancer 
mortality and unadjusted life-years.
RESULTS: Our model found that for men, the optimal age for PTG is 39 years, 
resulting in 32.01 incremental QALYs, 58.81 life-years (biologic age, 72.81 
years), and lifetime cancer mortality of 8.5%. Incorporating endoscopic 
surveillance prior to PTG decreased cancer mortality to 6.7%, but had lower 
QALYs (31.59). PTG at age 30 reduced cancer mortality to 3.2%, with 31.45 
incremental QALYs. For women, the optimal age for PTG was calculated to be 30 
years, with 33.09 incremental QALYs, 66.17 life-years (biologic age, 80.17 
years), and lifetime cancer mortality of 1.6%. Addition of endoscopic 
surveillance did not decrease the risk of HDGC mortality in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a Markov model of HDGC progression associated with pathogenic 
variants in CDH1 to simulate outcomes, we found the optimal ages for PTG to be 
39 years for men and 30 years for women, when QALYs are the primary endpoint. 
These ages for PTG are older than those of current recommendations.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of Cladribine Tablets in the 
treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) with high disease activity 
compared with fingolimod, from the perspective of the National Health System 
(NHS) in Spain.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed. The annual transition probabilities, were 
adjusted to patients with RMS with high disease activity. The effect of the 
treatments compared on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was modeled 
by hazard ratios for the confirmed progression of disability. The annual relapse 
rate and the probability of suffering adverse reactions were obtained from a 
meta-analysis and the literature. The derived costs were calculated from Spanish 
unit costs. The utilities were obtained from the CLARITY clinical trial and the 
literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyzes were performed.
RESULTS: Cladribine tablets was the dominant treatment: lower costs (-86,536 €) 
and more effective (+1.11 quality-adjusted life years - QALYs) compared to 
fingolimod. The probability that Cladribine Tablets was cost-effective compared 
to fingolimod ranged between 94.6% and 96.1% for willingness to pay from € 
20,000 to € 30,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Cladribine Tablets is a cost-effective treatment, compared to 
fingolimod, for the treatment of RMS with high disease activity.
EXPERT OPINION: According to the present study, compared to fingolimod, 
treatment with Cladribine Tablets of relapsing multiple sclerosis with high 
disease activity is an option that could generate savings for the Spanish 
National Health System, with a considerable gain in QALYs. Cladribine Tablets is 
considered cost-effective and dominant (less costs and more effectiveness) than 
fingolimod treatment option in this population.

Objective: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of five different tumour 
necrosis factor inhibitor tapering strategies in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and stable low disease activity, using a modelling design.Method: 
Using Markov models based on data from the DRESS and STRASS randomized 
controlled trials, and the Nijmegen RA cohort, five tapering strategies for 
etanercept and adalimumab were tested against continuation: 1, four-step 
tapering (DRESS strategy); 2, five-step tapering; 3, tapering without 
withdrawal; 4, use of a stricter flare criterion; and 5, use of a theoretical 
predictor for successful tapering. We also examined how well a biomarker should 
be able to predict in order for strategy 5 to become cost-effective compared to 
the other strategies.Results: All examined tapering strategies were cost saving 
(range: EUR 5128 to 7873) but yielded more short-lived flares compared to 
continuation. The change in utilities compared to continuation was minimal and 
not clinically relevant (range: -0.005 to 0.007 quality-adjusted life-years). 
Strategy 1 was cost-effective compared to all other strategies [highest 
incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB)]. However, there was a large overlap in 
credible intervals, especially between strategies 1 and 2. Scenario analyses 
showed that 50% reduction of drug prices would result in the highest iNMB for 
strategy 2. A biomarker only becomes cost-effective when it is inexpensive and 
has a sensitivity and specificity of at least 84%.Conclusion: Because our study 
showed a comparable iNMB for tapering in four or five steps (including 
discontinuation), we recommend a choice between these strategies, based on 
shared decision making.

AIM: To estimate the health gain, health system costs and cost-effectiveness of 
cataract surgery when expedited as a falls prevention strategy (reducing the 
waiting time for surgery by 12 months) and as a routine procedure.
METHODS: An established injurious falls model designed for the New Zealand (NZ) 
population (aged 65+ years) was adapted. Key parameters relating to cataracts 
were sourced from the literature and the NZ Ministry of Health. A health system 
perspective with discounting at 3% was used.
RESULTS: Expedited cataract surgery for 1 year of incident cases was found to 
generate a total 240 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (95% uncertainty 
interval (UI) 161 to 360) at net health system costs of NZ$2.43 million (95% UI 
2.02 to 2.82 million) over the remaining lifetimes of the surgery group. This 
intervention was cost-effective by widely accepted standards with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of NZ$10 600 (US$7540) (95% UI NZ$6030 to NZ$15 
700) per QALY gained. The level of cost-effectiveness did not vary greatly by 
sex, ethnicity and previous fall history, but was higher for the 65-69 age group 
compared with the oldest age group of 85-89 years (NZ$7000 vs NZ$14 200 per QALY 
gained). Comparing cataract surgery with no surgery, the ICER was even more 
favourable at NZ$4380 (95% UI 2410 to 7210) per QALY. Considering only the 
benefits for vision improvement and excluding the benefits of falls prevention, 
it was still favourable at NZ$9870 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Expedited cataract surgery appears very cost-effective. Routine 
cataract surgery is itself very cost-effective, and its value appears largely 
driven by the falls prevention benefits.

Institute, Rockville, Maryland.

BACKGROUND: We investigated differences in net cancer survival (survival 
observed if the only possible cause of death was the cancer under study) 
estimated using new approaches for relative survival (RS) and cause-specific 
survival (CSS).
METHODS: We used SEER data for patients diagnosed in 2000 to 2013, followed-up 
through December 31, 2014. For RS, we used new life tables accounting for 
geography and socio-economic status. For CSS, we used the SEER cause of death 
algorithm for attributing cancer-specific death. Estimates were compared by 
site, age, stage, race, and time since diagnosis.
RESULTS: Differences between 5-year RS and CSS were generally small. RS was 
always higher in screen-detectable cancers, for example, female breast (89.2% 
vs. 87.8%) and prostate (98.5% vs. 93.7%) cancers; differences increased with 
age or time since diagnosis. CSS was usually higher in the remaining cancer 
sites, particularly those related to specific risk factors, for example, cervix 
(70.9% vs. 68.3%) and liver (20.7% vs. 17.1%) cancers. For most cancer sites, 
the gap between estimates was smaller with more advanced stage.Conclusion: RS is 
the preferred approach to report cancer survival from registry data because 
cause of death may be inaccurate, particularly for older patients and long-term 
survivors as comorbidities increase challenges in determining cause of death. 
However, CSS proved to be more reliable in patients diagnosed with localized 
disease or cancers related to specific risk factors as general population life 
tables may not capture other causes of mortality.
