Recent publications have argued that there are potentially serious consequences 
for researchers in recognising distinct genera in the terminal fusarioid clade 
of the family Nectriaceae. Thus, an alternate hypothesis, namely a very broad 
concept of the genus Fusarium was proposed. In doing so, however, a significant 
body of data that supports distinct genera in Nectriaceae based on morphology, 
biology, and phylogeny is disregarded. A DNA phylogeny based on 19 orthologous 
protein-coding genes was presented to support a very broad concept of Fusarium 
at the F1 node in Nectriaceae. Here, we demonstrate that re-analyses of this 
dataset show that all 19 genes support the F3 node that represents Fusarium 
sensu stricto as defined by F. sambucinum (sexual morph synonym Gibberella 
pulicaris). The backbone of the phylogeny is resolved by the concatenated 
alignment, but only six of the 19 genes fully support the F1 node, representing 
the broad circumscription of Fusarium. Furthermore, a re-analysis of the 
concatenated dataset revealed alternate topologies in different phylogenetic 
algorithms, highlighting the deep divergence and unresolved placement of various 
Nectriaceae lineages proposed as members of Fusarium. Species of Fusarium s. 
str. are characterised by Gibberella sexual morphs, asexual morphs with thin- or 
thick-walled macroconidia that have variously shaped apical and basal cells, and 
trichothecene mycotoxin production, which separates them from other fusarioid 
genera. Here we show that the Wollenweber concept of Fusarium presently accounts 
for 20 segregate genera with clear-cut synapomorphic traits, and that fusarioid 
macroconidia represent a character that has been gained or lost multiple times 
throughout Nectriaceae. Thus, the very broad circumscription of Fusarium is 
blurry and without apparent synapomorphies, and does not include all genera with 
fusarium-like macroconidia, which are spread throughout Nectriaceae (e.g., 
Cosmosporella, Macroconia, Microcera). In this study four new genera are 
introduced, along with 18 new species and 16 new combinations. These names 
convey information about relationships, morphology, and ecological preference 
that would otherwise be lost in a broader definition of Fusarium. To assist 
users to correctly identify fusarioid genera and species, we introduce a new 
online identification database, Fusarioid-ID, accessible at www.fusarium.org. 
The database comprises partial sequences from multiple genes commonly used to 
identify fusarioid taxa (act1, CaM, his3, rpb1, rpb2, tef1, tub2, ITS, and LSU). 
In this paper, we also present a nomenclator of names that have been introduced 
in Fusarium up to January 2021 as well as their current status, types, and 
diagnostic DNA barcode data. In this study, researchers from 46 countries, 
representing taxonomists, plant pathologists, medical mycologists, quarantine 
officials, regulatory agencies, and students, strongly support the application 
and use of a more precisely delimited Fusarium (= Gibberella) concept to 
accommodate taxa from the robust monophyletic node F3 on the basis of a 
well-defined and unique combination of morphological and biochemical features. 
This F3 node includes, among others, species of the F. fujikuroi, F. 
incarnatum-equiseti, F. oxysporum, and F. sambucinum species complexes, but not 
species of Bisifusarium [F. dimerum species complex (SC)], Cyanonectria 
(F. buxicola SC), Geejayessia (F. staphyleae SC), Neocosmospora (F. solani SC) 
or Rectifusarium (F. ventricosum SC). The present study represents the first 
step to generating a new online monograph of Fusarium and allied fusarioid 
genera (www.fusarium.org).

INTRODUCTION: quality of life and life expectancy of people are improved when 
preventive health care services are utilized because these identify treatable 
health problems and puts life-threatening diseases in check. Morbidity and 
mortality associated with age-related chronic disease among the older adults is 
on the increase, therefore, this study aims at determining preventive health 
care services utilization among older adults in rural communities in Anambra 
State.
METHODS: a cross sectional design adopted for this study was carried out on 
older adults from the ages of 65 years and above in rural communities in Anambra 
State from October 2019 to January 2020. Data were collected through 
researcher-administered structured questionnaire. Data were analysed using 
univariable and multivariable regression analysis.
RESULTS: a total of 1944 older adults participated with an overall cluster 
percentage of 40.6% older adults utilizing investigated preventive health care 
services. The results of the multivariable analysis indicates that the following 
factors were associated with utilization of preventive healthcare services: male 
gender (aOR: 0.443, 95%CI: 0.281 - 5.472, p=0.47), level of education; primary 
(aOR: 1.536, 95%CI: 1.201 - 5.261, p=0.00), secondary (aOR: 4.516, 95%CI: 3.192 
- 6.242, p=0.00), and tertiary (aOR: 3.407, 95%CI: 3.199 - 5.666, p=0.00)], 
income of N50,000-N100,000 (aOR: 2.754, 95%CI: 1.066 - 10.766, p=0.01), and 
N100,000 and above (aOR: 4.233, 95%CI: 1.846 - 12.811, p=0.00)], and health 
insurance [aOR: 0.691, 95%CI: 0.422 - 1.945, p=0.03].
CONCLUSION: preventive health care services were under-utilized. Creating 
awareness on the importance of utilizing preventive health care services is 
highly recommended since most age-related chronic diseases once established may 
last a lifetime and affect quality of life and wellbeing.

Under extreme conditions and in palliative settings, shared decision making with 
the patient is vital; narrative decisions beyond evidence could be considered. 
If there is a chance of symptom palliation, extended surgery should not be 
avoided merely because of the limited life expectancy.

Factors Associated with Delayed Menopause in Iran: Findings from Fasa Cohort 
Study, a Branch of Persian Cohort Study.

Sciences, Fasa, Iran.

BACKGROUND: The investigation of middle-aged women's mental and physical health 
measures should be focused on menopause-a predictable physiological phenomenon 
in their lives. The prevalence of a majority of chronic diseases increases after 
this period. This study aimed to determine the risk factors of delayed menopause 
(climacterium tardum).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current cross-sectional research was conducted on 
1930 menopausal women who were referred to the cohort study of Fasa University 
of Medical Sciences, Fars Province, Iran, during 2014-2015. The data were 
extracted from the database, and then the variables were checked for accuracy. 
Finally, the data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The study population included 1930 menopausal women with the mean age 
of 57.98 ± 5.8 years. Of these, 1555 (80.6%) were married, and the rest were 
single and widowed. The mean age at menarche was 13.7 ± 1.64 years. 
Additionally, 1726 women (89.4%) had experienced natural menopause, whereas the 
rest had experienced delayed menopause. The results of the multivariate analysis 
indicated that delayed menopause was associated with marital status, education 
level, age at menarche, occupation, abortion, and use of contraceptive methods. 
However, no significant relationship was found between delayed menopause and 
smoking, duration of lactation, duration of using contraceptive pills, and 
number of childbirths.
CONCLUSION: Considering the increased life expectancy among women, delayed 
menopause, and its risk factors should be taken into account. Although genetic 
factors play key roles in age at the onset of menopause, the role of 
sociodemographic factors such as marital status and pregnancy should not be 
ignored.

Accidental carbon monoxide poisoning (ACOP) is the most common occupational 
toxic disease, but related data are scarce or non-existent in many countries. 
This article investigates the global burden of ACOP based on the Global Burden 
of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019) and the World Bank database. In our study, 
numbers and age-standardized rates of ACOP prevalence, incidence, deaths, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and 
years of life lost (YLLs) were analyzed at global, regional, and national level. 
Besides, the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of age-standardized rates 
were calculated by generalizing the linear model. Age, sex, and 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI) are included to access their internal relevance. 
Globally, in 2019, there were approximately 0.97 million ACOP incidence cases 
(95% CI 0.66 million to 1.4 million), and 41,142 (95% UI 32,957 to 45,934) 
people died from it. Compared with 1990, the morbidity and mortality of ACOP in 
2019 are on a downward trend. By sexes, from 1990 to 2019, females have higher 
morbidity and lower mortality. This correlation enables us to evaluate the level 
and status of public health services in various countries. We also evaluated the 
correlation between ACOP and economic parameters and use newly released machine 
learning tool-AutoGluon to predict the epidemiology of ACOP. The results of this 
study can be used by the health authorities to consider the burden of ACOP that 
could be addressed with preventive and therapeutic measures.

The increasing concern of consumers about food quality and safety and their 
rejection of chemical additives has promoted the breakthrough of the 
biopreservation field and the development of studies on the use of beneficial 
bacteria and their metabolites as potential natural antimicrobials for shelf 
life extension and enhanced food safety. Control of foodborne pathogens in meat 
and meat products represents a serious challenge for the food industry which can 
be addressed through the intelligent use of bio-compounds or biopreservatives. 
This article aims to systematically review the available knowledge about 
biological strategies based on the use of lactic acid bacteria to control the 
proliferation of undesirable microorganisms in different meat products. The 
outcome of the literature search evidenced the potential of several strains of 
lactic acid bacteria and their purified or semi-purified antimicrobial 
metabolites as biopreservatives in meat products for achieving longer shelf life 
or inhibiting spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, especially when combined with 
other technologies to achieve a synergistic effect.

BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent, chronic 
gastrointestinal disorder that imposes a substantial socioeconomic burden. 
Peppermint oil is a frequently used treatment for IBS, but evidence about 
cost-effectiveness is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess cost-effectiveness of small-intestinal release 
peppermint oil versus placebo in IBS patients.
METHODS: In a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial, 
cost-effectiveness was evaluated from a societal perspective. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were expressed as (1) incremental costs per 
Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY), and (2) incremental costs per successfully 
treated patient, that is per abdominal pain responder (according to FDA 
definitions), both after an eight-week treatment period with placebo versus 
peppermint oil. Cost-utility and uncertainty were estimated using non-parametric 
bootstrapping. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The analysis comprised 126 patients (N = 64 placebo, N = 62 
small-intestinal release peppermint oil). Peppermint oil was a dominant 
treatment compared to placebo in 46% of bootstrap replications. Peppermint oil 
was also more effective but at higher cost in 31% of replications. The 
net-benefit acceptability curve showed that peppermint oil has a 56% probability 
of being cost-effective at a conservative willingness-to-pay threshold of 
€10.000/QALY. Peppermint oil was also a dominant treatment per additional 
successfully treated patient according to FDA definitions, that is in 51% of 
replications. In this case, the acceptability curve showed an 89% probability of 
being cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IBS, small-intestinal release peppermint oil 
appears to be a cost-effective treatment although there is uncertainty 
surrounding the ICER. When using abdominal pain responder as outcome measure for 
the ICER, peppermint oil has a high probability of being cost-effective. The use 
of peppermint oil, which is a low-cost treatment, can be justified by the modest 
QALY gains and slightly higher proportion of abdominal pain responders. More 
research and long-term data are necessary to confirm the cost-effectiveness of 
peppermint oil. NCT02716285.

The Brazilian Amazon is far from being a homogeneous area. There are various 
forms of occupation and livelihood in the area that have in common a daily life 
deeply marked by interaction with the natural environment. Highlighting some 
elements of Boaventura de Souza Santos' social theory, this paper discusses how 
the problem of a linear timeline and the dominant scale in hegemonic thinking 
has served to leave the Amazonian territories outside the scope of inclusion in 
public health planning. It further points out that in order to engender 
'post-abyssal' thinking in the SUS for the region inevitably requires the 
redefinition of the economic role of the region and an inclusive social 
development framework with the Brazilian Amazon, and not irrespective of it. 
Lastly, the possibility that the local SUS should be based on a three-pronged 
approach, not exclusively urban-centered, which considers its territorial 
extension, population density and the ways in which access to health services 
takes place.

Publisher: A Amazônia brasileira não é um espaço homogêneo, nela subsistem 
diversas formas de ocupação que em comum têm cotidianos profundamente marcados 
pela interação com o meio natural. Destacando alguns elementos da teoria social 
de Boaventura de Souza Santos, o artigo discute como o problema do tempo linear 
e da escala dominante no pensamento hegemônico vem servindo para invisibilizar 
os territórios amazônicos na organização das ações públicas de saúde. Aponta 
ainda que consolidar um SUS pós-abissal na região passa inevitavelmente por uma 
repactuação do papel econômico e desenvolvimento social inclusivo com a 
Amazônia, e não apesar dela. Por fim, reflete se a construção do SUS local 
deveria se basear em um tripé, não exclusivamente urbano-centrado, que considere 
sua extensão territorial, densidade populacional e vias pelas quais os fluxos de 
acesso aos serviços de saúde acontecem.

BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study has generated a wealth of 
data on death and disability outcomes in Europe. It is important to identify the 
disease burden that is attributable to risk factors and, therefore, amenable to 
interventions. This paper reports the burden attributable to risk factors, in 
deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), in the 28 European Union (EU) 
countries, comparing exposure to risks between them, from 2007 to 2017.
METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study, using secondary data from the GBD 2017 
Results Tool. For the EU-28 and each country, attributable (all-cause) 
age-standardized death and DALY rates, and summary exposure values are reported.
RESULTS: In 2017, behavioural and metabolic risk factors showed a higher 
attributable burden compared with environmental risks, with tobacco, dietary 
risks and high systolic blood pressure standing out. While tobacco and air 
quality improved significantly between 2007 and 2017 in both exposure and 
attributable burden, others such as childhood maltreatment, drug use or alcohol 
use did not. Despite significant heterogeneity between EU countries, the EU-28 
burden attributable to risk factors decreased in this period.
CONCLUSION: Accompanying the improvement of population health in the EU-28, a 
comparable trend is visible for attributable burden due to risk factors. Besides 
opportunities for mutual learning across countries with different disease/risk 
factors patterns, good practices (i.e. tobacco control in Sweden, air pollution 
mitigation in Finland) might be followed. On the opposite side, some concerning 
cases must be highlighted (i.e. tobacco in Bulgaria, Latvia and Estonia or drug 
use in Czech Republic).

This paper quantifies the net impact (direct and indirect effects) of the 
pandemic on the United States population in 2020 using three metrics: excess 
deaths, life expectancy, and total years of life lost. The findings indicate 
there were 375,235 excess deaths, with 83% attributable to direct, and 17% 
attributable to indirect effects of COVID-19. The decrease in life expectancy 
was 1.67 years, translating to a reversion of 14 years in historical life 
expectancy gains. Total years of life lost in 2020 was 7,362,555 across the USA 
(73% directly attributable, 27% indirectly attributable to COVID-19), with 
considerable heterogeneity at the individual state level.

The disadvantages of mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthesis in the 
long-term may not play an important role if the shorter life expectancy of older 
patients is taken into account. This study aims to evaluate whether mitral valve 
replacement in the elderly is associated with similar outcome compared to repair 
in the short- and long-term. All patients aged 70 years and older undergoing 
minimally invasive mitral valve surgery were studied retrospectively. Primary 
outcome was 30-day complication rate, secondary outcome was long-term survival 
and freedom from re-operation. 223 Patients underwent surgery (124 replacement 
and 99 repair) with a mean age of 76.4 ± 4.2 years. 30-Day complication rate 
(replacement 73.4% versus repair 67.7%; p=.433), 30-day mortality (replacement 
4.0% versus repair 1.0%; p=.332) and 30-day stroke rate (replacement 0.0% versus 
repair 1.0%; p=.910) were similar in both groups. Multivariable cox regression 
revealed higher age, diabetes and left ventricular dysfunction as predictors for 
reduced long-term survival, while a valve replacement was no predictor for 
reduced survival. Sub analysis of patients with degenerative disease showed no 
difference in long-term survival after propensity weighting (HR 1.4; 95%CI 0.84 
- 2.50; p=.282). The current study reveals that mitral valve repair and 
replacement in the elderly can be achieved with good short- and long-term 
results. Long-term survival was dependent on patient related risk factors and 
not on the type of operation (replacement versus repair).

Advances in the treatment and management of cystic fibrosis (CF) have led to a 
substantial increase in patient life expectancy, thus facilitating healthier 
lives and labour force participation. This review aimed to address the impact of 
CF on the occupational functioning of patients. A significant proportion of 
patients were reported to retain a job on a full- or part-time schedule. Less 
physically demanding occupations were most frequently performed, perhaps due to 
CF-related inability to sustain a heavy workload. Disease severity parameters 
(e.g., lung function measurements, or personal, psycho-social, or economic 
conditions) have been reported as determinant or co-determinant factors for the 
development of work-related disability. Although further research is necessary, 
our results may be useful to inform interdisciplinary CF healthcare management, 
including the assessment of work function, and to define career counselling 
plans and workplace risk assessment and management strategies to support the 
personal, social and professional lives of patients.

In recent years, the life expectancy of Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients has 
substantially improved, but this cancer remains incurable with increasing 
incidence in the developed world. Most MM patients will eventually relapse due 
to residual drug-resistant cancerous cells that survive treatment, commonly 
referred to as minimal residual disease (MRD). Methods to improve MRD detection 
in MM patients are generating considerable interest as a means of monitoring 
patients' response to treatment. In clinical laboratories, these methods 
currently require bone marrow aspirates which are invasive and frequently miss 
detection of localised disease due to the spatial heterogeneity of disease 
infiltration. By simplifying serial sampling and allowing for the detection of 
extramedullary disease, a blood-based method could significantly impact 
treatment duration and intensity and minimise chemotherapy-induced toxicity. 
This review will describe the current blood-based techniques available to detect 
MRD in MM and compare their potential to evaluate patient prognosis and drive 
therapeutic decisions.

Considering the shorter life expectancy and poorer prognosis of metastatic 
epidural spinal cord compression patients, anterior reconstruction and fusion 
may be unnecessary. This study aimed to investigate the outcomes of palliative 
surgery for metastatic epidural spinal cord compression with neurological 
deficit among patients who underwent posterior decompression and instrumentation 
without fusion or anterior reconstruction. This single-center retrospective 
review included all patients aged > 18 years with thoracic or lumbar spinal 
metastasis who were surgically treated for metastatic spinal cord compression 
without fusion or anterior reconstruction at the Department of Orthopaedic 
Surgery, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 
Thailand during July 2015 to December 2017. Data from preoperation to the 1-year 
follow-up, including demographic and clinical data, Frankel classification, pain 
scores, complication, revision surgery, health-related quality-of-life scores, 
and survival data, were collected and analyzed. A total of 30 patients were 
included. The mean age was 59.83 ± 11.73 years, and 20 (66.7%) patients were 
female. The mean operative time was 208.17 ± 58.41 min. At least one Frankel 
grade improvement was reported in 53.33% of patients. The pain visual analog 
scale, the EuroQOL five-dimension five-level utility score, and the Oswestry 
Disability Index were all significantly improved at a minimum of 3 months after 
surgery. No intraoperative mortality or instrument-related complication was 
reported. The mean survival duration was 11.4 ± 8.97 months. Palliative 
non-fusion surgery without anterior reconstruction may be considered as a 
preferable choice for treating spinal metastasis patients with spinal cord 
compression with neurological deficits.

Dip coating with pullulan and chitosan in combination with lemon peel 
polyphenols (LPP) was attempted for shelf life extension of raw poultry meat. 
Control samples demonstrated bacterial lag phase and shelf life of 1.3 and 
1 day, respectively at 4 °C. Meat samples coated with pullulan or chitosan in 
combination with 1% LPP led to an increased bacterial lag phase; thereby 
extending the shelf life of meat by 6 and 14 days, respectively. Significant 
(p < 0.05) reduction in lipid peroxidation in comparison with control was also 
observed due to dip treatment. Treated samples maintained values of < 1 mg kg-1 
malondialdehyde for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances during the entire 
storage period. No significant (p > 0.05) change in colour, weight loss and pH 
of treated samples during storage was noted. Dip coated samples maintained 
acceptable sensory quality during the entire storage period. This study 
indicates that use of LPP for shelf life extension of raw meat could be a 
practical proposition.

PURPOSE: The 2018 Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS) showed 
Nigeria's progress toward the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets: 47% of HIV-positive 
individuals knew their status; of these, 96% were receiving antiretroviral 
therapy (ART); and of these, 81% were virally suppressed. To improve 
identification of HIV-positive individuals, Nigeria developed an Enhanced 
Community Case-Finding Package (ECCP). We describe ECCP implementation in nine 
states and assess its effect.
METHODS: ECCP included four core strategies (small area estimation [SAE] of 
people living with HIV [PLHIV], map of HIV-positive patients by residence, HIV 
risk-screening tool [HRST], and index testing [IT]) and four supportive 
strategies (alternative healthcare outlets, performance-based incentives for 
field testers, Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes, and 
interactive dashboards). ECCP was deployed in nine of 10 states prioritized for 
ART scale-up. Weekly program data (October 2019-March 2020) were tracked and 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the total 774 LGAs in Nigeria, using SAE, 103 (13.3%) high-burden 
LGAs were identified, in which 2605 (28.0%) out of 9,294 hotspots were 
prioritized by mapping newly identified PLHIV by residential addresses. Over 22 
weeks, among 882,449 individuals screened using HRST, 723,993 (82.0%) were 
eligible and tested for HIV (state range, 43.7-90.4%), out of which 20,616 were 
positive. Through IT, an additional 3,724 PLHIV were identified. In total, 
24,340 PLHIV were identified and 97.4% were linked to life-saving antiretroviral 
therapy. The number of newly identified PLHIV increased 17-fold over 22 weeks 
(week 1: 89; week 22: 1,632). Overall mean HIV positivity rate by state was 3.3% 
(range, 1.8-6.4%).
CONCLUSION: Using ECCP in nine states in Nigeria increased the number of PLHIV 
in the community who knew their status, allowing them to access life-saving care 
and decreasing the risk of HIV transmission.
