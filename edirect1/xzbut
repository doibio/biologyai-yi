2012 in rural areas, respectively, it was 3.74 and increased to 3.98. Regardless 
of the place of residence the women fell ill 3.5 times more frequently. The 
lowest morbidity rate, both in rural and urban areas, was recorded in the 
Lubuskie Province, the largest in Świętokrzyskie Province. The the most probable 
explanation of the highest morbidity rate in the latter province is a worse 
access to a rheumatologist: in this province there is the lowest number of 
inhabitants per one employed rheumatologist.
CONCLUSION: In Poland, the number of RA sufferers is increasing, which is 
probably a result of increasing life expectancy. In Poland, also exists a 
differences in morbidity between urban and rural inhabitants. Differences may 
also derive from undiagnosed cases of the disease.

Despite overall gains in life expectancy at birth among Los Angeles County 
residents, significant disparities persist across population subgroups. The 
purpose of this study was to quantify the potential sex- and 
race/ethnicity-specific gains in life expectancy had we been able to fully or 
partially eliminate the leading causes of death in Los Angeles County. Complete 
annual life tables for local residents were generated by applying the same 
method used for the National Center of Health Statistics US life tables 
published in 1999. Based on 2010 Los Angeles County mortality records, sex- and 
race/ethnicity-specific potential gains in life expectancy were calculated using 
scenarios of 10, 20, 50, and 100 % elimination of 12 major causes of death. 
Coronary heart disease, the leading cause of death, was found to be most 
impactful on life expectancy. Its hypothetical full elimination would result in 
life expectancy gains ranging from 2.2 years among white females to 3.7 years 
among black males. Gains from complete elimination of lung cancer and stroke 
ranked second, with almost an additional year of life for each gender. However, 
marked disparities across racial/ethnic groups were noted from the elimination 
of several other causes of death, such as homicide, from which the gain among 
black males exceeded 13 times more than their white counterparts. By 
differentially targeting specific causes of death in disease prevention, not 
only can findings of this study aid in efficiently narrowing racial/ethnic 
disparities, they can also provide a quantitative means to identify and rank 
priorities in local health policymaking.

This article is dedicated to an under-researched area, the demographic 
development and social welfare for the most elderly (aged ≥80 years) in The 
People's Republic of China. Based on national censuses conducted over the last 
six decades in China this study examined the development of the most elderly 
population in comparison with groups of younger elderly people. It is argued 
that population growth among the most elderly in China has occurred with 
unparalleled speed, a phenomenon referred to as second order aging. This study 
demonstrated that the proportion of individuals aged ≥80 years has increased 
more rapidly than any other age group among elderly people. Particular attention 
has been given to the issue of social security and social welfare for the most 
elderly based on the non-contributory old age allowances provided by various 
regions and provinces. A national unified program of social security for the 
most elderly in the population is still not in sight.

[Considerations of screening and brief intervention among high-risk drinkers in 
Japan: from the perspectives of feasibility and cost-effectiveness].

[Article in Japanese]

Taguchi Y, Yoshimoto H, Ikeda S.

One of the alcohol-related goals in Japan's health promotion campaign called 
Health Japan 21 (secondary term) is to reduce the number of high-risk drinkers 
(20 years old or above) who consume 40g or more pure alcohol/day in men and 20g 
or more in women by year 2022. To achieve this goal, a further expansion of 
screening and brief intervention (SBI) in the medical setting is essential. In 
this research, realistic and cost-effective SBI scenarios in Japan were 
investigated based on international systematic review and clinicians' opinions 
from a semi-structured interview. Several SBI scenarios were built with 2 levels 
of intervention based on the AUDIT scores of 8-15 (brief advice) and 16-19 
(brief advice and counseling, continuous intervention), and a simulation was 
conducted by applying different probabilities and success rates into the 
scenarios. Information associated with preparation and implementation of SBI at 
the 2 levels was also estimated and annual costs of SBI per drinker were 
calculated. It was found that approximately 2,390,000 and 530,000 high-risk 
drinkers require brief and extensive interventions, respectively. Furthermore, 
incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained were calculated 
at 723,415 yen for brief intervention and 944,762 yen for extensive 
intervention, suggesting cost-effectiveness of SBI in Japan. Given the limited 
national healthcare budget and operational challenges such as time to provide 
SBI especially in the primary care setting in Japan, roles of healthcare 
providers and wider use of information technology were discussed with some 
suggestions. Furthermore, lighter and more frequent interventions at various 
levels and not only at the medical setting but also at multiple social settings 
(such as workplace and among family and friends) were discussed to increase the 
cost-effectiveness of SBI and to keep the number of high-risk drinkers who have 
successfully reduced their alcohol consumption.

BACKGROUND: Primary total knee replacement is a common operation that is 
performed to provide pain relief and restore functional ability. Inpatient 
physiotherapy is routinely provided after surgery to enhance recovery prior to 
hospital discharge. However, international variation exists in the provision of 
outpatient physiotherapy after hospital discharge. While evidence indicates that 
outpatient physiotherapy can improve short-term function, the longer term 
benefits are unknown. The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to evaluate 
the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a 6-week 
group-based outpatient physiotherapy intervention following knee replacement.
METHODS/DESIGN: Two hundred and fifty-six patients waiting for knee replacement 
because of osteoarthritis will be recruited from two orthopaedic centres. 
Participants randomised to the usual-care group (n = 128) will be given a 
booklet about exercise and referred for physiotherapy if deemed appropriate by 
the clinical care team. The intervention group (n = 128) will receive the same 
usual care and additionally be invited to attend a group-based outpatient 
physiotherapy class starting 6 weeks after surgery. The 1-hour class will be run 
on a weekly basis over 6 weeks and will involve task-orientated and 
individualised exercises. The primary outcome will be the Lower Extremity 
Functional Scale at 12 months post-operative. Secondary outcomes include: 
quality of life, knee pain and function, depression, anxiety and satisfaction. 
Data collection will be by questionnaire prior to surgery and 3, 6 and 12 months 
after surgery and will include a resource-use questionnaire to enable a 
trial-based economic evaluation. Trial participation and satisfaction with the 
classes will be evaluated through structured telephone interviews. The primary 
statistical and economic analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat 
basis with and without imputation of missing data. The primary economic result 
will estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained from 
this intervention from a National Health Services (NHS) and personal social 
services perspective.
DISCUSSION: This research aims to benefit patients and the NHS by providing 
evidence on the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of outpatient 
physiotherapy after knee replacement. If the intervention is found to be 
effective and cost-effective, implementation into clinical practice could lead 
to improvement in patients' outcomes and improved health care resource 
efficiency.

The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a family of lysosomal storage disorders 
characterized by deficient activity of enzymes that degrade glycosaminoglycans 
(GAGs). Skeletal disease is common in MPS patients, with the severity varying 
both within and between subtypes. Within the spectrum of skeletal disease, 
spinal manifestations are particularly prevalent. Developmental and degenerative 
abnormalities affecting the substructures of the spine can result in compression 
of the spinal cord and associated neural elements. Resulting neurological 
complications, including pain and paralysis, significantly reduce patient 
quality of life and life expectancy. Systemic therapies for MPS, such as 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy, have 
shown limited efficacy for improving spinal manifestations in patients and 
animal models. Therefore, there is a pressing need for new therapeutic 
approaches that specifically target this debilitating aspect of the disease. In 
this review, we examine how pathological abnormalities affecting the key 
substructures of the spine - the discs, vertebrae, odontoid process and dura - 
contribute to the progression of spinal deformity and symptomatic compression of 
neural elements. Specifically, we review current understanding of the underlying 
pathophysiology of spine disease in MPS, how the tissues of the spine respond to 
current clinical and experimental treatments, and discuss future strategies for 
improving the efficacy of these treatments.

The mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of inherited metabolic diseases caused by 
deficiencies in enzymes involved in the sequential degradation of 
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) leading to substrate accumulation in various tissues 
and organs. GAG accumulation can cause growth retardation and progressive damage 
to respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, nervous, gastrointestinal, 
auditory, and visual systems. In the past, few people with severe phenotypic 
mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) reached adulthood. However, better methods for 
diagnosis, multi-disciplinary care, and new therapies have extended lifespan, 
leading to an increasing number of patients surviving beyond childhood. The 
growing number of adult MPS patients poses significant challenges for clinicians 
who may not be familiar with the clinical manifestations of MPS. In addition, as 
new interventions have changed the natural history of these disorders, it is 
difficult to anticipate both the impact on life expectancy and other 
complications that may occur as these patients age. Because the MPS disorders 
are multi-organ diseases, their management requires a coordinated 
multi-disciplinary approach. Here we discuss the unique pattern of medical 
issues and multi-organ involvement in adult patients with MPS and identify the 
challenges that are associated with management of MPS. This review is based on 
information from an expert investigator meeting with MPS specialists held 
October 2-4, 2014 in Dublin, Ireland, as well as on current literature searches 
focusing on MPS and adults.

Chitosan (Ch) coating incorporated with black pepper essential oil (Ch+BPEO) was 
studied to extend the shelf life of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) during 
refrigerated storage at 4 ± 1°C. The chemical composition of BPEO was 
characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Antibacterial 
properties of BPEO were determined by disk diffusion agar, MIC, and MBC. Ch (2% 
[wt/vol]) and Ch+BPEO (2% [wt/vol] Ch with 1.5% [vol/vol] BPEO) were used for 
common carp fillet coating. The samples were analyzed periodically for chemical 
(pH, total volatile basic nitrogen) and microbiological (aerobic plate count, 
psychrophilic bacteria count, lactic acid bacteria, and Enterobacteriaceae 
bacterial counts) characteristics during 16 days. The GC-MS results indicated 
that main components in BPEO were carene, caryophyllene, limonene, β-pinene, and 
α-pinene. The samples coated with Ch and Ch+BPEO resulted in lower pH and total 
volatile basic nitrogen values in comparison with the control. The 
microbiological analysis of fish fillets during refrigerated storage clearly 
indicated that Ch+BPEO coating significantly reduced the fish fillet microbial 
load. The aerobic plate count, psychrophilic bacteria count, lactic acid 
bacteria count, and Enterobacteriaceae bacterial count of samples coated with 
Ch+BPEO were reduced approximately 4.1, 3.9, 2.3, and 2.8 log CFU/g, 
respectively, at the end of the storage period. Finally, Ch and Ch+BPEO 
effectively improved the quality of fish fillet during refrigerated storage and 
extended the shelf life of fish fillets from 8 to 16 days.

BACKGROUND: The objective of focal brachytherapy (BT) is to provide effective 
prostate cancer control for low-risk disease but with reduced genitourinary, 
gastrointestinal and sexual side effects in a cost-effective way.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe a phase II study examining 
technical and dosimetric feasibility and toxicity, quality of life changes, and 
local control with post-treatment biopsy outcomes in men with early stage low 
volume prostate cancer treated with focal iodine-125 seed BT.
METHODS: The study design is a prospective, multicenter trial with a planned 
sample size of 20 patients including men with a minimum age of 60 years, a life 
expectancy estimated to be greater than 10 years, with low or low-tier 
intermediate risk prostate cancer, unilateral disease on the biopsy, and a 
Gleason score of ≤3+4 and <25% cores involved. The investigations specific for 
the study are multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (Mp-MRI) baseline, at 
20 and 36 months to rule out high grade disease and a transperineal mapping 
biopsy (baseline and at 36 months) for more accurate patient selection. The 
hemigland region will receive 144 Gy. Standard normal tissue constraints will be 
considered as for a whole gland (WG) implant. Dosimetric parameters will be 
evaluated at day 30 after the implant. Toxicity and quality of life will be 
evaluated with international validated questionnaires focusing on urinary, 
rectal, sexual domain, and general health-related quality of life. The patients 
will complete this assessment at baseline and then approximately every 6 months 
after the implant up to 10 years.
RESULTS: To date, one patient is involved in the trial. He underwent the 
pre-implant investigations which found bilateral disease. Therefore, a standard 
seed implant was performed. If the results from this trial provide evidence that 
the treatment is safe, feasible, and improves toxicity, funding will be sought 
to conduct a large, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
CONCLUSIONS: This protocol is designed to show feasibility in delivering 
hemigland focal therapy with seed BT. It may answer crucial questions and obtain 
data which will enable downstream decisions on focal low dose rate (LDR) 
prostate BT.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is increasing in Europe, yet a substantial 
proportion of adults still die prematurely before the age of 70 years. We sought 
to estimate the joint and relative contributions of tobacco smoking, 
hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity, alcohol and poor diet towards risk 
of premature death.
METHODS: We analysed data from 264,906 European adults from the EPIC prospective 
cohort study, aged between 40 and 70 years at the time of recruitment. Flexible 
parametric survival models were used to model risk of death conditional on risk 
factors, and survival functions and attributable fractions (AF) for deaths prior 
to age 70 years were calculated based on the fitted models.
RESULTS: We identified 11,930 deaths which occurred before the age of 70. The AF 
for premature mortality for smoking was 31 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 
31-32 %) and 14 % (95 % CI, 12-16 %) for poor diet. Important contributions were 
also observed for overweight and obesity measured by waist-hip ratio (10 %; 95 % 
CI, 8-12 %) and high blood pressure (9 %; 95 % CI, 7-11 %). AFs for physical 
inactivity and excessive alcohol intake were 7 % and 4 %, respectively. 
Collectively, the AF for all six risk factors was 57 % (95 % CI, 55-59 %), being 
35 % (95 % CI, 32-37 %) among never smokers and 74 % (95 % CI, 73-75 %) among 
current smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: While smoking remains the predominant risk factor for premature 
death in Europe, poor diet, overweight and obesity, hypertension, physical 
inactivity, and excessive alcohol consumption also contribute substantially. Any 
attempt to minimise premature deaths will ultimately require all six factors to 
be addressed.

The aim of this EP Wire was to assess the management, indications, and 
techniques for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac 
resynchronization therapy (CRT) device replacement in Europe. A total of 24 
centres in 14 European countries completed the questionnaire. All centres were 
members of the European Heart Rhythm Association Electrophysiology Research 
Network. Replacement procedures were performed by electrophysiologists in 52% of 
the centres, by cardiologists in 33%, and both in the remaining centres. In the 
majority of centres, the procedures were performed during a short 
hospitalization (<2 days; 61.2%), or on an outpatient basis (28%). The 
overwhelming majority of centres reported that they replaced ICDs at the end of 
battery life. Only in a small subset (<10%) of patients with ICD for primary 
prevention and without ventricular tachycardia (VT) since implantation, ICD was 
not replaced. In inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes, 80% of the centres 
always replaced the ICD at the end of battery life. After VT ablation, only few 
centres (9%) explanted or downgraded the device that was previously implanted 
for secondary prevention, but only in those patients without new VT episodes. 
Patient's life expectancy <1 year was the most commonly reported reason (61%) to 
downgrade from a CRT-D to a CRT-P device. While warfarin therapy was continued 
in 47% of the centres, non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants were discontinued 
without bridging 24 h prior to replacement procedures in 60%. Finally, in 65% of 
the centres, VT induction and shock testing during ICD and CRT-D replacement 
were performed only in the case of leads with a warning or with borderline 
measurements. This survey provides a snapshot of the perioperative management, 
indications, and techniques of ICD and CRT device replacement in Europe. It 
demonstrates some variations between participating centres, probably related to 
local policies and to the heterogeneity of the ICD population.

Multiple studies suggest that females are affected by Alzheimer disease (AD) 
more severely and more frequently than males. Other studies have failed to 
confirm this and the issue remains controversial. Difficulties include 
differences in study methods and male versus female life expectancy. Another 
element of uncertainty is that the majority of studies have lacked 
neuropathological confirmation of the AD diagnosis. We compared clinical and 
pathological AD severity in 1028 deceased subjects with full neuropathological 
examinations. The age of dementia onset did not differ by gender but females 
were more likely to proceed to very severe clinical and pathological disease, 
with significantly higher proportions having a Mini-Mental State Examination 
score of 5 or less and Braak stage VI neurofibrillary degeneration. Median 
neuritic plaque densities were similar in females and males with AD but females 
had significantly greater tangle density scores. In addition, we found that 
AD-control brain weight differences were significantly greater for females, even 
after adjustment for age, disease duration, and comorbid conditions. These 
findings suggest that when they are affected by AD, females progress more often 
to severe cognitive dysfunction, due to more severe neurofibrillary 
degeneration, and greater loss of brain parenchyma.

Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have a very short life expectancy if they 
receive no surgical intervention. A relatively new surgical technique termed 
"Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy" 
(ALPPS) has been employed for inducing rapid hypertrophy of the future liver 
remnant for patients waiting for hepatectomy. As portal vein embolization may 
not result in satisfactory hypertrophy before tumor progression occurs, ALPPS 
can be an alternative for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Herein we describe an ALPPS procedure with tumor thrombectomy for a patient who 
had a small left liver lobe and a large hepatocellular carcinoma involving the 
whole right liver lobe and the middle hepatic vein and extending into the 
inferior vena cava. In the first-stage operation, the right portal vein was 
controlled and divided with a Hemolock. The right hepatic artery was well 
protected. Hepatic transection was performed with a 1-cm margin from the tumor. 
The middle hepatic vein trunk was preserved. Ten days afterwards, there was 
significant hypertrophy of the left lateral section of the liver, and the 
second-stage operation was conducted. Extended right hepatectomy and tumor 
thrombectomy were performed under sternotomy and total vascular exclusion. The 
patient had good recovery and was free of disease 10 months after the operation. 
ALPPS may be a good treatment option even for patients with advanced disease if 
carried out at high-volume centers.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of the average American with diabetes has 
increased, but the quality of health and functioning during those extra years 
are unknown. We aimed to investigate the net effect of recent trends in diabetes 
incidence, disability, and mortality on the average age of disability onset and 
the number of healthy and disabled years lived by adults with and without 
diabetes in the USA. We assessed whether disability expanded or was compressed 
in the population with diabetes and compared the findings with those for the 
population without diabetes in two consecutive US birth cohorts aged 50-70 
years.
METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal analysis, we analysed data for two 
cohorts of US adults aged 50-70 years from the Health and Retirement Study, 
including 1367 people with diabetes and 11 414 without diabetes. We assessed 
incident disability, remission from disability, and mortality between 
population-based cohort 1 (born 1931-41, follow-up 1992-2002) and cohort 2 (born 
1942-47, follow up 2002-12). Disability was defined by mobility loss, difficulty 
with one or more instrumental activities of daily living, and difficulty with 
one or more activities of daily living. We entered age-specific probabilities 
representing the two birth cohorts into a five-state Markov model to estimate 
the number of years of disabled and disability-free life and life-years lost by 
age 70 years.
FINDINGS: In people with diabetes, compared with cohort 1 (n=1067), cohort 2 
(n=300) had more disability-free and total years of life, later onset of 
disability, and fewer disabled years. Simulations of the Markov models suggest 
that in men with diabetes aged 50 years, this difference between cohorts 
amounted to a 0·8-2·3 year delay in disability across the three metrics 
(mobility, 63·0 [95% CI 62·3-63·6] to 64·8 [63·6-65·7], p=0·01; instrumental 
activities of daily living, 63·5 [63·0-64·0] to 64·3 [63·0-65·3], p=0·24; 
activities of daily living, 62·7 [62·1-63·3] to 65·0 [63·5-65·9], p<0·0001) and 
1·3 fewer life-years lost (ie, fewer remaining life-years up to age 70 years; 
from 2·8 [2·5-3·2] to 1·5 [1·3-1·9]; p<0·0001 for all three measures of 
disability). Among women with diabetes aged 50 years, this difference between 
cohorts amounted to a 1·1-2·3 year delay in disability across the three metrics 
(mobility, 61·3 [95% CI 60·5-62·1] to 63·2 [61·5-64·5], p=0·0416; instrumental 
activities of daily living, 63·0 [62·4-63·7] to 64·1 [62·7-65·2], p=0·16; 
activities of daily living, 62·3 [61·6-63·0] to 64·6 [63·1-65·6], p<0·0001) and 
0·8 fewer life-years lost by age 70 years (1·9 [1·7-2·2] to 1·1 [0·9-1·5]; 
p<0·0001 for all three measures of disability). Parallel improvements were 
gained between cohorts of adults without diabetes (cohort 1, n=8687; cohort 2, 
n=2727); within both cohorts, those without diabetes had significantly more 
disability-free years than those with diabetes (p<0·0001 for all comparisons).
INTERPRETATION: Irrespective of diabetes status, US adults saw a compression of 
disability and gains in disability-free life-years. The decrease in disability 
onset due to primary prevention of diabetes could play an important part in 
achieving longer disability-free life-years.

Orius strigicollis (Poppius) is an anthocorid bug with high foraging ability on 
thrips as well as on mites, and the bug has been considered as a potential 
biological control agent in Taiwan. Life table and predation studies of O. 
strigicollis fed on Cadra cautella (Walker) and Tetranychus urticae (Koch) eggs 
were conducted at 25 ± 1°C. Data were analyzed and compared using TWOSEX-MSChart 
and CONSUME-MSChart software. O. strigicollis fed on eggs of C. cautella, a 
substitute prey, showed significantly higher survival rate and developmental 
rate than individuals fed on their natural prey, T. urticae eggs. The fecundity 
of O. strigicollis fed on C. cautella eggs was, on average, 13.2 times higher 
than that of those fed on T. urticae eggs, despite of the fact that during the 
entire nymphal stage, the consumption rate of O. strigicollis on T. urticae eggs 
was ca. 9 times higher than on almond moth eggs The conversion rate (i.e., 
number of prey eggs needed to produce one predator egg) for this predatory bug 
reared on T. urticae eggs and almond moth eggs were 604.6 and 6.0, respectively, 
indicating that almond moth eggs served as an effective alternative prey for 
ensuring the predator's reproduction. This is the first study pertaining to the 
population parameters and predation rates of O. strigicollis using the age-stage 
two-sex approach to describe differences between O. strigicollis populations 
reared on natural and alternative preys. This information may be useful in mass 
rearing programs and field application involving this biological control agent.

Vertebral Augmentation Involving Vertebroplasty or Kyphoplasty for 
Cancer-Related Vertebral Compression Fractures: A Systematic Review.

Health Quality Ontario.

Collaborators: Pron G, Holubowich C, Kaulback K.

BACKGROUND: Cancers that metastasize to the spine and primary cancers such as 
multiple myeloma can result in vertebral compression fractures or instability. 
Conservative strategies, including bed rest, bracing, and analgesic use, can be 
ineffective, resulting in continued pain and progressive functional disability 
limiting mobility and self-care. Surgery is not usually an option for cancer 
patients in advanced disease states because of their poor medical health or 
functional status and limited life expectancy. The objectives of this review 
were to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous image-guided 
vertebral augmentation techniques, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, for 
palliation of cancer-related vertebral compression fractures.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search for studies on vertebral 
augmentation of cancer-related vertebral compression fractures published from 
January 1, 2000, to October 2014; abstracts were screened by a single reviewer. 
For those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were 
obtained. Owing to the heterogeneity of the clinical reports, we performed a 
narrative synthesis based on an analytical framework constructed for the type of 
cancer-related vertebral fractures and the diversity of the vertebral 
augmentation interventions.
RESULTS: The evidence review identified 3,391 citations, of which 111 clinical 
reports (4,235 patients) evaluated the effectiveness of vertebroplasty (78 
reports, 2,545 patients) or kyphoplasty (33 reports, 1,690 patients) for 
patients with mixed primary spinal metastatic cancers, multiple myeloma, or 
hemangiomas. Overall the mean pain intensity scores often reported within 48 
hours of vertebral augmentation (kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty), were 
significantly reduced. Analgesic use, although variably reported, usually 
involved parallel decreases, particularly in opioids, and mean pain-related 
disability scores were also significantly improved. In a randomized controlled 
trial comparing kyphoplasty with usual care, improvements in pain scores, 
pain-related disability, and health-related quality of life were significantly 
better in the kyphoplasty group than in the usual care group. Bone cement 
leakage, mostly asymptomatic, was commonly reported after vertebroplasty and 
kyphoplasty. Major adverse events, however, were uncommon.
CONCLUSIONS: Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty significantly and rapidly 
reduced pain intensity in cancer patients with vertebral compression fractures. 
The procedures also significantly decreased the need for opioid pain medication, 
and functional disabilities related to back and neck pain. Pain palliative 
improvements and low complication rates were consistent across the various 
cancer populations and vertebral fractures that were investigated.

INTRODUCTION: Pathological bilateral femoral neck fracture due to renal 
osteodystrophy is rare. This is a report of a chronic renal failure patient who 
had sustained bilateral intra-capsular displaced fracture neck of femur 
following an episode of convulsion and the difficulties encountered in early 
diagnosis and treatment. The pathophysiology of renal osteodystrophy and the 
treatment of hip fractures in patients with renal failure are also discussed.
CASE REPORT: A 23 years old male patient admitted with h/o dysuria, pyuria and 
loss of appetite since 3 months. He was a known case of chronic renal failure 
and reflux nephropathy. On investigating, patient's renal parameters were high 
and he was started with haemodialysis. The next day patient had c/o bilateral 
hip pain and inability to move bilateral lower limbs following an episode of 
seizure. Radiograph of pelvis showed vertical sub capital fractures of bilateral 
neck of femur. In this patient, considering his age, general condition & 
prognosis, an elective surgery in the form of bilateral uncemented modular 
bipolar hemiarthroplasty was done.
CONCLUSION: Overall risk of hip fracture among patients with chronic renal 
failure is considerably higher than in the general population, independent of 
age and gender. Simultaneous spontaneous bilateral fractures of the femoral neck 
are rare and a delayed diagnosis is usual. The study of etiological factors of 
these fractures is essential to guide us in choosing the treatment of choice. 
Obviously patient's age, life expectancy as well as renal co morbidity has an 
influence over deciding treatment and outcome.

INTRODUCTION: Infantile Systemic Hyalinosis (ISH) is a rare and fatal genetic 
disorder with mutations in Capillary morphogenesis gene-2 CMG2 / Human anthrax 
toxin receptor gene-2 ANTXR2 resulting in spindle cell proliferation, altered 
collagen metabolism with extensive deposition of amorphous eosinophilic PAS 
positive hyaline material in the connective tissues of various organs. The 
common presenting features would be progressive stiffness of multiple joints, 
skin lesions, multiple episodes of protracted infections, prolonged diarrhoea 
and failure to thrive. ISH is a rapidly progressive painful disorder of infancy 
with a very short life expectancy.
CASE PRESENTATION: 3 months old identical twins born to a 5th degree 
consanguinous couple were brought with complaints of excessive cry, deformity of 
all four limbs, recurrent episodes of respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea 
since birth. Evaluation of both the probands revealed facial dysmorphism with 
perinasal nodules, gingival hypertrophy, fixed deformities of multiple joints 
bilaterally, umbilical hernia, fleshy perianal nodules and pigmented patches 
over knuckles and ankle. A clinical diagnosis of ISH was suspected and confirmed 
by detection of homozygous c.277_278insATTATTT (or p.L93Yfs*14) in exon 3 of the 
ANTXR2 gene. The probands were managed symptomatically and parents were 
counselled regarding prenatal diagnosis in future pregnancies.
CONCLUSION: IHS is commonly misdiagnosed as Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita 
and is often mismanaged with manipulation of the stiff joints and invasive 
surgical procedures. Prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus biopsy is possible 
once causative mutation in a family is identified. Invasive surgical 
interventions for histopathological analysis can be avoided as clinical features 
are most often classical and genetic analysis is confirmatory. Management is 
conservative and symptomatic. We report this case of identical twins with 
features of ISH in view of its rarity as timely clinical suspicion can avoid 
painful and invasive procedures for diagnosis and management.

BACKGROUND: Eplerenone has been demonstrated as being cost effective for the 
treatment of patients with systolic heart failure (HF) and mild symptoms in 
several jurisdictions; however, its cost effectiveness is unknown in the context 
of Alberta, Canada.
METHODS: We used a discrete-event simulation model to compare costs and outcomes 
between standard care and standard care plus eplerenone for the treatment of HF 
with mild symptoms. We used Alberta data (whenever possible) together with a 
healthcare perspective, a lifetime horizon, and 3 % annual discount rate for 
analyses.
RESULTS: Clinically, eplerenone prevented HF hospitalizations, atrial 
fibrillations, and cardiovascular (CV) deaths, but incurred more adverse events 
and device implantations than standard care. The remaining life of patients 
receiving eplerenone was 7.08 versus 5.83 years for those receiving standard 
care. Eplerenone gained 1.25 life-years and 1.18 quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), with an incremental cost of $Can7200. Therefore, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $Can5700 per life-year gained and $Can6100 
per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the most cited ICER threshold is $Can50,000, the use of 
eplerenone as an adjunct to standard care for treating patients with systolic HF 
and mild symptoms is cost effective in the context of Alberta. Eplerenone would 
cost the Alberta health system about $Can4.6 million a year in drug costs.
