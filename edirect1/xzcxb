Greenfield IVC filter placement (2007-2014) were retrospectively studied. 
Greenfield filters were placed permanently in those with venous thromboembolism 
and an expected lifelong contraindication to anticoagulation or life 
expectancy <6 months. Patients' demographic data, procedural characteristics, 
and imaging studies were reviewed and factors associated with perforation rates 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 190 follow-up CT imaging studies were available for review. 
In total, filter-associated IVC thrombus (n = 10 [10.7%]) and pulmonary embolism 
breakthrough (n = 4 [4.3%)] were documented by contrast-enhanced CT. Perforation 
was evident in 18 patients (19.4%) with an average indwelling time of 256 days. 
No symptomatic perforation and no strut fracture were documented. There was no 
significant difference in perforation rate with respect to age of the patient 
(P = .61), sex (P = 1.00), or history of malignant disease (P = .40). The filter 
perforation rate and number of perforating struts were significantly higher in 
patients with longer indwelling time (>90 days) than in patients with shorter 
indwelling time (<90 days; P < .01). Caval cross-sectional areas of patients who 
experienced IVC filter perforations at >90 days were significantly smaller than 
those of nonperforated patients (284 vs 358 mm2; P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Stainless steel Greenfield filters remain a relatively safe option 
for patients requiring permanent mechanical filtration.

Application of technologies has an important role in agricultural development. 
Identifying and assessing the impacts of agricultural technologies is necessary. 
This study aimed at assessing the impacts of laser levelling economically, 
socially, environmentally, and technically in the viewpoint of the agricultural 
experts and identifying factors determining their perception of the impacts. The 
study samples (151 experts) were selected using multi-stage random sampling in 
Fars Province, Iran. The results revealed that experts considered uniform 
distribution of water, using conservation tillage, facilitating agricultural 
activities, decreased water consumption and decrease of water wasting as the 
most important technical impacts of laser levelling technology. The most 
environmentally important impacts were the decrease of soil erosion and 
retention of crop residues. Experts stated the most significant social impacts 
as improvement in villages living conditions and sense of belonging to rural 
areas. Besides, an increase of income and reduction of inputs costs were among 
the economic impacts of laser levelling technology. According to the results, 
attitude towards water and soil resources conservation and environmental beliefs 
had the highest direct effect on individual perception toward impacts. Practical 
recommendations have been presented based on the results of the study.

Men treated for prostate cancer with curative intent face a recurrence rate of 
up to 53% at 10 years. 68Ga-PSMA imaging is a new technique that can more 
accurately stage cancer recurrences and facilitate personalised treatment. We 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI for staging men with 
prostate cancer biochemical recurrence. A cost-effectiveness analysis using a 
decision-analytic model with Markov chains was constructed. 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI 
was compared with usual care in staging of men with suspected prostate cancer 
recurrence. Men with biochemical recurrence from a study in Brisbane, Australia 
(n = 30) provided key estimates for the model. The primary outcomes were health 
system costs and years of life (survival) over 10 years. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to address uncertainty in 
model estimates. On average, a strategy of 68Ga-PSMA was expected to cost AU$56 
961(US$39 426) and produce 7.48 life years compared with AU$64 499 (US$44 667) 
and 7.41 life years in usual care. Therefore, 68Ga-PSMA was potentially cost 
saving (- AU$7 592 95% UI - $24 846, $7 825) (- US$5 258) and slightly more 
effective 0.07 life years (95% UI - 0.01, 0.16). The likelihood that 68Ga-PSMA 
strategy was cost-effective at acceptable thresholds was 87%. The findings were 
sensitive to the lesion detection rate of the 68Ga-PSMA strategy (52-75%) and 
the cost of follow up in usual care (AU$1 947 to $2 635). In this exploratory 
economic evaluation, using 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI to detect prostate cancer 
recurrence appears to be cost-effective relative to usual care.

Sickle cell trait (SCT) is the carrier state for sickle cell disease that 
results from the HBB rs334 missense mutation (p.Glu6Val) in the β-globin chain 
of haemoglobin. While not associated with any impact on life expectancy, it has 
been established that SCT is associated with an increased risk of both venous 
thromboembolism (and in particular, pulmonary embolism) and chronic kidney 
disease. It is largely unknown what short- or long-term effect, if any, 
pregnancy has upon the risk or outcomes of these disorders. In addition, SCT has 
been linked with various adverse outcomes in pregnancy, ranging from maternal 
complications such as elevated risk of bacteriuria to potentially 
life-threatening entities such as pre-eclampsia and prematurity. In these 
scenarios also, no clear association with SCT has been established. Given the 
high worldwide prevalence of SCT, further studies addressing these issues are 
warranted.

Introduction: Miscarriage is a stressful life event with negative consequences 
that can last into the subsequent gestation, increasing women's risk for 
psychological symptoms. Less clear in literature is whether having a living 
child may buffer the psychological impact of miscarriage on subsequent 
pregnancies.Objective: explore levels of depression, anxiety and fear of 
delivery in women with and without a previous miscarriage, taking into 
consideration the presence of a living child.Method: 208 women (M = 34.68) were 
recruited during the third trimester of gestation. The sample was composed of 
159 women without a previous miscarriage (72.3% primiparae and 27.7% multiparae) 
and 49 women with a history of miscarriage (53.1% primiparae and 46.9% 
multiparae). Participants filled out a battery of questionnaires aimed at 
assessing anxiety, depression, and fear of delivery.Results: Primiparae reported 
higher levels of fear of childbirth than multiparae. Moreover, women without a 
history of previous perinatal loss showed lower levels of depression and fear of 
childbirth than women with a previous perinatal loss.Conclusions: Data highlight 
the importance of developing specific support groups, for primiparae, due to 
their great emotional vulnerability, and for women with past miscarriage, to 
help them cope in adaptive ways with a new pregnancy.

Estimating Social Variation in the Health Effects of Changes in Health Care 
Expenditure.

Background. A common aim of health expenditure is to reduce unfair inequalities 
in health. Although previous research has attempted to estimate the total health 
effects of changes in health expenditure, little is known about how changes 
affect different groups in the population. Methods. We propose a general 
framework for disaggregating the total health effects of changes in health 
expenditure by social groups. This can be performed indirectly when the estimate 
of the total health effect has first been disaggregated by a secondary factor 
(e.g., disease area) that can be linked to social characteristics. This is 
illustrated with an application to the English National Health Service. Evidence 
on the health effects of expenditure across 23 disease areas is combined with 
data on the distribution of disease-specific hospital utilization by age, sex, 
and area-level deprivation. Results. We find that the health effects from NHS 
expenditure changes are produced largely through disease areas in which 
individuals from more deprived areas account for a large share of health care 
utilization, namely, respiratory and neurologic disease and mental health. We 
estimate that 26% of the total health effect from a change in expenditure would 
accrue to the fifth of the population living in the most deprived areas, 
compared with 14% to the fifth living in the least deprived areas. Conclusions. 
Our approach can be useful for evaluating the health inequality impacts of 
changing health budgets or funding alternative health programs. However, it 
requires robust estimates of how health expenditure affects health outcomes. Our 
example analysis also relied on strong assumptions about the relationship 
between health care utilization and health effects across population groups.

Adults' Cognitive Testing.

As life expectancy increases, aging has become a major health challenge, 
resulting in a huge effort to better discriminate between normal and 
pathological cognitive decline. It is thus essential that cognitive tests and 
their administration are as fair as possible. However, an important source of 
bias during cognitive testing comes from negative aging stereotypes that can 
impair the memory performance of older adults and inflate age differences on 
cognitive tasks. The fear of confirming negative aging stereotypes creates an 
extra pressure among older adults which interferes with their intellectual 
functioning and leads them to perform below their true abilities. Here, we 
present a protocol that highlights simple but efficient interventions to 
alleviate this age-based stereotype threat effect. The first study showed that 
simply informing older participants about the presence of younger participants 
(threat condition) led older adults to underperform on a standardized memory 
test compared with younger participants, and that this performance difference 
was eliminated when the test was presented as age-fair (reduced-threat 
condition). The second study replicated these findings on short cognitive tests 
used to screen for predementia in clinical settings and showed that teaching 
older adults about stereotype threat inoculated them against its effects. These 
results provide useful recommendations about how to improve older adults' memory 
assessment both in Iab studies and in clinical settings.

OBJECTIVE: EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) and Short-Form Six-Dimensions (SF-6D) are widely 
used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years in cost-utility analysis. The 
choice of the instrument could influence the results of cost-utility analysis. 
Our objective was to compare the psychometric properties of the EQ-5D and SF-6D 
in a postoperative Spanish population, as well as assess their 
interchangeability in a cost-utility analysis.
DESIGN: Ambispective study.
SETTING: Tertiary public hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: 275 Spanish patients who had undergone surgery for lumbar disc 
herniation.
INTERVENTION(S): Patients completed EQ-5D-3L and Short-Form 36 (SF-36v2) 
questionnaires. Internal consistency, floor and ceiling effects, agreement, and 
construct validity (convergent validity, including dimension-to-dimension 
correlations, and "known groups" validity) were assessed. The Spanish tariffs 
were applied.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cronbach's α coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation 
coefficient, Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, intraclass correlation 
coefficient and Bland-Altman plot.
RESULTS: Main findings were: (a) lack of agreement between EQ-5D and SF-6D 
utilities (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient: 0.664 [95% CI: 
0.600-0.720]; the Bland-Altman plot showed a mean difference of 0.0835 and wide 
limits of agreement [- 0.2602-0.4272]). (b) Lack of correlation between domains 
that theoretically measure similar aspects of quality of life, with the 
exception of "pain" domain.
CONCLUSIONS: The preference-based EQ-5D and SF-6D instruments showed valid 
psychometric properties to assess generic outcome in a Spanish population who 
had undergone surgery for lumbar disc herniation; however, utility scores 
derived from the measures were different. Thus, these two instruments cannot be 
used interchangeably to perform a cost-utility analysis, and they should both be 
included in sensitivity analyses.

OBJECTIVES: Many older adults with limited life expectancy and/or advanced 
dementia (LLE/AD) are potentially overtreated for diabetes and may benefit from 
deintensification. Our aim was to examine the incidence and predictors of 
diabetes medication deintensification in older Veterans with LLE/AD who were 
potentially overtreated at admission to Veterans Affairs (VA) nursing homes 
(community living centers [CLCs]).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using linked VA and Medicare 
clinical/administrative data and Minimum Data Set assessments.
SETTING: VA CLCs.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6960 Veterans with diabetes and LLE/AD admitted to VA 
CLCs in fiscal years 2009 to 2015 with hemoglobin (Hb)A1c measured within 
90 days of admission.
MEASUREMENTS: We evaluated treatment deintensification (discontinuation or dose 
reduction for a consecutive 7-day period) among residents who were potentially 
overtreated (HbA1c ≤7.5% and receiving hypoglycemic medications). Competing risk 
models assessed 90-day cumulative incidence of deintensification.
RESULTS: More than 40% (n = 3056) of Veteran CLC residents with diabetes were 
potentially overtreated. The cumulative incidence of deintensification at 
90 days was 45.5%. Higher baseline HbA1c values were associated with a lower 
likelihood of deintensification (e.g., HbA1c 7.0-7.5% vs <6.0%; adjusted risk 
ratio [aRR] = .57; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .50-.66). Compared with 
non-sulfonylurea oral agents (e.g., metformin), other treatment regimens were 
more likely to be deintensified (aRR = 1.31-1.88), except for basal insulin (aRR 
= .59; 95% CI = .52-.66). The only resident factor associated with increased 
likelihood of deintensification was documented end-of-life status (aRR = 1.12; 
95% CI = 1.01-1.25). Admission from home/assisted living (aRR = .85; 95% CI = 
.75-.96), obesity (aRR = .88; 95% CI = .78-.99), and peripheral vascular disease 
(aRR = .90; 95% CI = .81-.99) were associated with decreased likelihood of 
deintensification.
CONCLUSION: Deintensification of treatment regimens occurred in less than 
one-half of potentially overtreated Veterans and was more strongly associated 
with low HbA1c values and use of medications with high risk for hypoglycemia, 
rather than other resident characteristics. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:736-745, 2020.

Cost-Effectiveness Model Shows Superiority of Wireless Spinal Cord Stimulation 
Implantation Without a Separate Trial.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of wireless spinal cord 
stimulation (Wireless SCS) with single stage "direct to permanent" implantation 
vs. screening with temporary electrodes and an external pulse generator followed 
by implantation of a system for long-term use (IPG SCS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created a cost model that takes a 2019 United States 
(U.S.) payer perspective and is based on IPG SCS cost models for subjects with 
chronic back and/or leg pain. Our six-month decision tree includes the screening 
trial period (success ≥50% relief) and leads to various levels of pain relief 
with or without complications for IPG SCS and Wireless SCS and without 
complications for conventional medical management (CMM). Every three months in 
the follow-on 15-year Markov model (with costs and quality-adjusted life years 
discounted 3.5% annually), subjects remain stable or transition to deteriorated 
health or death. Subjects who fail SCS receive CMM. After 60 Markov cycles, a 
100,000-sample simulation reveals the impact of maximum willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
from $10,000 to $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year on net monetary benefit 
(NMB). Sensitivity analyses considered the impact of the Wireless SCS screening 
success rate, Wireless SCS device cost, and IPG SCS device longevity.
RESULTS: Compared with IPG SCS, Wireless SCS offers higher clinical 
effectiveness at a lower cost and a higher NMB for our WTP thresholds and is, 
thus, dominant. Wireless SCS is also cost-effective compared with CMM. Results 
remain robust with 1) Wireless SCS screening success rates as low as 85% 
(dominant), 2) the cost of the Wireless SCS devices as high as $55,000 
(cost-effective), and 3) IPG SCS devices lasting 12 years (dominant).
CONCLUSIONS: In this model, compared with IPG SCS or with CMM, Wireless SCS is a 
superior strategy.

York Medical College, Vaslhalla, NY, USA.

Introduction: Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for 
cardiovascular events and mortality in the world.Areas covered: An extensive 
literature review of articles and clinical trials on PUBMED on the topic of 
hypertension in the elderly from 1976 through January 2020 was conducted. This 
review article discusses clinical trials on treatment of hypertension in the 
elderly, the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart 
Association (AHA) hypertension guidelines, the 2018 European Society of 
Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines, and the treatment of 
hypertension and of resistant hypertension in the elderly.Expert opinion: The 
2017 ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines recommend treatment of noninstitutionalized 
ambulatory community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older with an average 
systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or higher with lifestyle measures plus 
antihypertensive drug to lower the blood pressure to less than 130/80 mm Hg. For 
elderly adults with hypertension and a high burden of comorbidities and limited 
life expectancy, clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-based 
approach to assess risk/benefit is reasonable for decisions about the intensity 
of SBP lowering and the choice of antihypertensive drugs to use for treatment.

Early life adversity and insecure attachment style are known risk factors for 
perinatal depression. The biological pathways linking these experiences, 
however, have not yet been elucidated. We hypothesized that overlap in patterns 
of DNA methylation in association with each of these phenomena could identify 
genes and pathways of importance. Specifically, we wished to distinguish between 
allostatic-load and role-transition hypotheses of perinatal depression. We 
conducted a large-scale analysis of methylation patterns across 5 × 106 
individual CG dinucleotides in 54 women participating in a longitudinal 
prospective study of perinatal depression, using clustering-based criteria for 
significance to control for multiple comparisons. We identified 1580 regions in 
which methylation density was associated with childhood adversity, 3 in which 
methylation density was associated with insecure attachment style, and 6 in 
which methylation density was associated with perinatal depression. Shorter 
telomeres were observed in association with childhood trauma but not with 
perinatal depression or attachment insecurity. A detailed analysis of 
methylation density in the oxytocin receptor gene revealed similar patterns of 
DNA methylation in association with perinatal depression and with insecure 
attachment style, while childhood trauma was associated with a distinct 
methylation pattern in this gene. Clinically, attachment style was strongly 
associated with depression only in pregnancy and the early postpartum, whereas 
the association of childhood adversity with depression was time-invariant. We 
concluded that the broad DNA methylation signature and reduced telomere length 
associated with childhood adversity could indicate increased allostatic load 
across multiple body systems, whereas perinatal depression and attachment 
insecurity may be narrower phenotypes with more limited DNA methylation 
signatures outside the CNS, and no apparent association with telomere length or, 
by extension, allostatic load. In contrast, the finding of matching DNA 
methylation patterns within the oxytocin receptor gene for perinatal depression 
and attachment insecurity is consistent with the theory that the perinatal 
period is a time of activation of existing attachment schemas for the purpose of 
structuring the mother-child relationship, and that such activation may occur in 
part through specific patterns of methylation of the oxytocin receptor gene.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study health status' time trends in the European Union 
(EU) during 1990-2017 and its enlargements' impact.
METHODS: Using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease 2017 study and 
calculating age-sex-standardized rates, we have described time trends and 
analysed the differences between EU groups regarding the state of health. 
Interrupted time-series analyses were also performed in order to assess the 
enlargement impact in the EU state of health.
RESULTS: All age-sex-standardized rates (mortality, years of life lost, years 
lived with disability and disability-adjusted life years) declined (annualized 
rates of change of - 1.7%, - 1.52%, - 0.06% and - 1.01%, respectively) between 
1990 and 2017 (except between 2014 and 2015). For EU-28, life expectancy and 
healthy life expectancy increased 5.9 and 4.6 years, respectively. With the 
EU-25 and EU-27 enlargements, all age-sex-standardized rates and life 
expectancies worsened (with statistical significance). The EU-28 enlargement 
revealed the same tendency, contrasting with the EU-15 one.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the EU health status is improving, despite changes in its 
composition over the years. However, the average EU state of health declined 
with the 2004, 2007 and 2013 EU enlargements.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate objective treatment success and subjective 
patient-reported outcomes in patients with radiation-induced urethral strictures 
undergoing single-stage urethroplasty.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Monocentric study of patients who underwent single-stage 
ventral onlay buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty for a radiation-induced 
stricture between January 2009 and December 2016. Patients were characterized by 
descriptive analyses. Kaplan-Meier estimates were employed to plot 
recurrence-free survival. Recurrence was defined as any subsequent urethral 
instrumentation (dilation, urethrotomy, urethroplasty). Patient-reported 
functional outcomes were evaluated using the validated German extension of the 
Urethral Stricture Surgery Patient-Reported Outcome Measure (USS PROM).
RESULTS: Overall, 47 patients were available for final analyses. Median age was 
70 (IQR 65-74). Except for two, all patients had undergone pelvic radiation 
therapy for prostate cancer. Predominant modality was external beam radiation 
therapy in 70% of patients. Stricture recurrence rate was 33% at a median 
follow-up of 44 months (IQR 28-68). In 37 patients with available USS PROM data, 
mean six-item LUTS score was 7.2 (SD 4.3). Mean ICIQ sum score was 9.8 (SD 5.4). 
Overall, 53% of patients reported daily leaking and of all, 26% patients 
underwent subsequent artificial urinary sphincter implantation. Mean IIEF-EF 
score was 4.4 (SD 7.1), indicating severe erectile dysfunction. In 38 patients 
with data regarding the generic health status and treatment satisfaction, mean 
EQ-5D index score and EQ VAS score was 0.91 (SD 0.15) and 65 (SD 21), 
respectively. Overall, 71% of patients were satisfied with the outcome.
CONCLUSION: The success rate and functional outcome after BMGU for 
radiation-induced strictures were reasonable. However, compared to existing 
long-term data on non-irradiated patients, the outcome is impaired and patients 
should be counseled accordingly.

BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy for people with an intellectual 
disability (ID) is resulting in more persons with cancer and a greater need for 
end-of-life (EoL) care. There is a need for knowledge of health care utilisation 
over the last year of life to plan for resources that support a high quality of 
care for cancer patients with ID. Therefore, the aims of the study were to 
compare (1) health care utilisation during the last year of life among cancer 
patients with ID and cancer patients without ID and (2) the place of death in 
these two groups.
METHODS: The populations were defined using national data from the period 
2002-2015, one with ID (n = 15 319) and one matched 5:1 from the general 
population (n = 72 511). Cancer was identified in the Cause of Death Register, 
resulting in two study cohorts with 775 cancer patients with ID (ID cohort) and 
2968 cancer patients from the general population (gPop cohort).
RESULTS: Cancer patients with ID were less likely than those without ID to have 
at least one visit in specialist inpatient (relative risk 0.90, 95% confidence 
interval 0.87-0.93) and outpatient (0.88, 0.85-0.91) health care, during their 
last year of life. Those with ID were more likely to have no or fewer return 
visits than the patients in the gPop cohort (5 vs. 11, P < 0.001), also when 
stratifying on sex and median age at death. Most cancer patients with ID died in 
group homes or in their own homes and fewer in hospital (31%) as compared with 
cancer patients in the gPop cohort (55%, 0.57, 0.51-0.64).
CONCLUSIONS: Older cancer patients with ID were less likely to be assessed or 
treated by a specialist. This may suggest that people with ID have unaddressed 
or untreated distressing symptoms, which strongly contributes to a decreased 
quality of EoL care and a poor quality of life. There is a need to acquire 
further knowledge of the EoL care and to focus on adapting and evaluating 
quality indicators for older cancer patients with ID.

BACKGROUND: Data on the incidence, mortality, and other burden of oral cancer as 
well as their secular trends are necessary to provide policy-makers with the 
information needed to allocate resources appropriately. The purpose of this 
study was to use the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 results to estimate the 
incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for oral cancer 
from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: We collected detailed data on oral cancer from 1990 to 2017 from the 
GBD 2017. The global incidence, mortality, and DALYs attributable to oral cancer 
as well as the corresponding age-standardized rates (ASRs) were calculated. The 
estimated annual percentage changes in the ASRs of incidence (ASRI) and 
mortality (ASRM) and age-standardized DALYs of oral cancer were also calculated 
according to regions and countries to quantify the secular trends in these 
rates.
RESULTS: We tracked the incidence, mortality, and DALYs of oral cancer in 195 
countries/territories over 28 years. Globally, the incidence, mortality, and 
DALYs of oral cancer increased by about 1.0-fold from 1990 to 2017. The ASRI of 
oral cancer showed a similar trend, increasing from 4.41 to 4.84 per 100,000 
person-years during the study period. The ASRM remained approximately stable at 
about 2.4 per 100,000 from 1990 to 2017, as did the age-standardized DALYs, at 
about 64.0 per 100,000 person-years. ASRI was highest in Pakistan 
(27.03/100,000, 95% CI = 22.13-32.75/100,000), followed by Taiwan China, and 
lowest in Iraq (0.96/100,000, 95% CI = 0.86-1.06/100,000). ASRM was highest in 
Pakistan (16.85/100,000, 95% CI = 13.92-20.17/100,000) and lowest in Kuwait 
(0.51/100,000, 95% CI = 0.45-0.58/100,000).
CONCLUSIONS: The ASRI of oral cancer has increased slightly worldwide, while the 
ASRM and age-standardized DALY have remained stable. However, these 
characteristics vary between countries, suggesting that current prevention 
strategies should be reoriented, and much more targeted and specific strategies 
should be established in some countries to forestall the increase in oral 
cancer.

Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis (HSS) complicates portal hypertension, leading to 
life-threatening variceal bleeding. Variceal bleeding is associated with 
increased portal vein diameter (PVD). Beta-blockers prevent variceal bleeding. 
It is unclear whether beta-blockers such as propranolol can reduce PVD in HSS. 
We aimed to explore the effect of propranolol on PVD in HSS. A longitudinal 
study was conducted at the University Teaching Hospital, Zambia, as an extension 
of a clinical trial of rifaximin undertaken to test the hypothesis that 
rifaximin could reduce bacterial translocation in HSS. We randomized 85 adults 
to either rifaximin and standard care, or propranolol-based standard care only 
for 42 days. We then followed up all the patients on propranolol up to day 180. 
We used ultrasound to measure PVD at baseline and day 180. The primary outcome 
was reduction in PVD. Beta-blockade and splenic size reduction were secondary 
outcomes. Portal vein diameter reduced after 180 days of propranolol therapy 
from median 12 mm (interquartile range (IQR): 11-14) to median 10 mm (IQR: 9-13) 
(P < 0.001). The pulse rate reduced from baseline median 70 beats/minute (IQR: 
66-80) to 65 beats/minute (IQR: 60-70) by day 180 (P = 0.006). Hemoglobin levels 
improved from baseline median 8 g/dL (IQR: 6-11) to 12 g/dL (10-14) (P < 0.001). 
Splenic size remained unchanged. Propranolol led to the reduction in PVD over 
180 days. This suggests that ultrasound could be useful in monitoring response 
and compliance to beta-blockers, especially in resource-constraint areas where 
portal hypertension measurement facilities are unavailable.

Resveratrol, a phytoalexin, is a natural polyphenol synthesized exclusively by 
plants in response to environmental stresses. However, the molecule has also 
many exogenous bioactivities in animal cells. These bioactivities may lead to 
anti-cancer and cardio-protective health benefits. Because cellular responses to 
the treatment with resveratrol include the changes of expression patterns, 
functional genomics is an attractive tool to study them. In recent and today's 
experimental practice, this mostly means microarray profiling of gene expression 
(using RNAs isolated from bulk tissues). Herein, we review such published 
studies undertaken in the context of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). CVDs are a 
number one public health problem in developed countries, outweighing in 
magnitude even cancer. In particular, we review the studies of resveratrol in 
several animal models relevant to CVDs. These models included: normal and 
pre-mature aging in mice, as well as atherogenic diet in mice / pigs / non-human 
primates. Additionally, there were few clinical studies published in the context 
of the comorbidities of atherosclerosis in humans (e.g. obesity, diabetes, 
hypertension). For the purposes of these studies, three types of samples were 
most commonly profiled with microarrays: the liver, the skeletal muscle, and 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Resveratrol-induced changes of gene 
expression typically mimicked those associated with calorie restriction and 
lifespan extension. They also opposed changes induced by the atherogenic diet. 
We conclude by discussing few experimental factors that were relatively 
neglected thus far, but which could be interesting to investigate in the future. 
These factors include sex and the exact formulation of resveratrol (plant 
extract, or synthetic chemical).

The increasing extension in life expectancy of human beings in developed 
countries is accompanied by a progressively greater rate of degenerative 
diseases associated with lifestyle and aging, most of which are still waiting 
for effective, not merely symptomatic, therapies. Accordingly, at present, the 
recommendations aimed at reducing the prevalence of these conditions in the 
population are limited to a safer lifestyle including physical/mental exercise, 
a reduced caloric intake, and a proper diet in a convivial environment. The 
claimed health benefits of the Mediterranean and Asian diets have been confirmed 
in many clinical trials and epidemiological surveys. These diets are 
characterized by several features, including low meat consumption, the intake of 
oils instead of fats as lipid sources, moderate amounts of red wine, and 
significant amounts of fresh fruit and vegetables. In particular, the latter 
have attracted popular and scientific attention for their content, though in 
reduced amounts, of a number of molecules increasingly investigated for their 
healthy properties. Among the latter, plant polyphenols have raised remarkable 
interest in the scientific community; in fact, several clinical trials have 
confirmed that many health benefits of the Mediterranean/Asian diets can be 
traced back to the presence of significant amounts of these molecules, even 
though, in some cases, contradictory results have been reported, which 
highlights the need for further investigation. In light of the results of these 
trials, recent research has sought to provide information on the biochemical, 
molecular, epigenetic, and cell biology modifications by plant polyphenols in 
cell, organismal, animal, and human models of cancer, metabolic, and 
neurodegenerative pathologies, notably Alzheimer's and Parkinson disease. The 
findings reported in the last decade are starting to help to decipher the 
complex relations between plant polyphenols and cell homeostatic systems 
including metabolic and redox equilibrium, proteostasis, and the inflammatory 
response, establishing an increasingly solid molecular basis for the healthy 
effects of these molecules. Taken together, the data currently available, though 
still incomplete, are providing a rationale for the possible use of natural 
polyphenols, or their molecular scaffolds, as nutraceuticals to contrast aging 
and to combat many associated pathologies.

Globally, traditional food security fears have been supplemented by concerns 
about food system sustainability that link current agricultural production 
practices to damages of environmental ecosystems and the world's climate, thus 
threatening the natural resource base of future generations. This paper aims at 
creating a better understanding of the evolution of diet sustainability from 
1961 to 2013. Data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations were used to investigate the situation for the world as a whole as well 
as for its macro-regions Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe and Oceania. We 
define diet sustainability by (a) the share of daily per capita calorie intake 
derived from vegetable/plant products and (b) the variety of vegetable/plant 
products consumed, measured by the Simpson diversity index. Moreover, total 
calorie consumption is considered. Then the correlations between diet 
sustainability and (a) macro-regional life expectancy rates and (b) food system 
greenhouse gas emissions are calculated. The results show that diet 
sustainability has not changed much during the last 50 years. Moreover, the 
nexus between diets and health and climate outcomes is not fully evident at the 
macro-regional level. Therefore, Malthus 2.0, i.e., scientific food pessimism, 
should be avoided. In particular, the limitations of dietary contributions to 
human and planetary health ought to be more widely acknowledged.
