People with schizophrenia are at greater risk of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, 
dyslipidaemia and hypertension than the general population. This results in an 
increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and reduced life expectancy, 
over and above that imposed by their mental illness through suicide. Several 
levels of evidence from data linkage analyses to clinical trials demonstrate 
that treatment-related metabolic disturbances are commonplace in this patient 
group, and that the use of certain second-generation antipsychotics may compound 
the risk of developing the metabolic syndrome and CVD. In addition, smoking, 
poor diet, reduced physical activity and alcohol or drug abuse are prevalent in 
people with schizophrenia and contribute to the overall CVD risk. Management and 
minimization of metabolic risk factors are pertinent when providing optimal care 
to patients with schizophrenia. This review recommends a framework for the 
assessment, monitoring and management of patients with schizophrenia in the UK 
clinical setting.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost effectiveness of screening for Chlamydia 
trachomatis compared with a policy of no organised screening in the United 
Kingdom.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation using a transmission dynamic mathematical model.
SETTING: Central and southwest England.
PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical population of 50,000 men and women, in which all 
those aged 16-24 years were invited to be screened each year.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost effectiveness based on major outcomes averted, 
defined as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, or 
neonatal complications.
RESULTS: The incremental cost per major outcome averted for a programme of 
screening women only (assuming eight years of screening) was 22,300 pounds 
(33,000 euros; $45,000) compared with no organised screening. For a programme 
screening both men and women, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio was 
approximately 28,900 pounds. Pelvic inflammatory disease leading to hospital 
admission was the most frequently averted major outcome. The model was highly 
sensitive to the incidence of major outcomes and to uptake of screening. When 
both were increased the cost effectiveness ratio fell to 6200 pound per major 
outcome averted for screening women only.
CONCLUSIONS: Proactive register based screening for chlamydia is not cost 
effective if the uptake of screening and incidence of complications are based on 
contemporary empirical studies, which show lower rates than commonly assumed. 
These data are relevant to discussions about the cost effectiveness of the 
opportunistic model of chlamydia screening being introduced in England.

Alzheimer's disease represents a growing health problem because of the ongoing 
increase in life expectancy. Therefore understanding the molecular alterations 
responsible for neurodegeneration has become imperative in order to develop 
efficient strategies for the therapy. Mounting evidence suggests that the 
essential metal ion copper is intriguingly connected with the established 
molecular markers of Alzheimer's disease and that copper homeostasis is 
disturbed in affected individuals, leading to oxidative stress and 
neurodegeneration. This review summarizes the mechanisms of copper trafficking 
in cells and describes the relationship between copper, the amyloid precursor 
protein and beta-amyloid. Since one of the main goals of the research on 
Alzheimer's disease is the identification of blood markers to aid diagnosis and 
monitor the effects of therapeutic approaches, the results obtained in a series 
of studies on copper in the blood of Alzheimer's disease patients recently 
carried out in our laboratories are described.

BACKGROUND: Abnormalities in taste and smell functioning occur with elevated 
frequency in both older adults and patients with cancer. With the predicted 
increase in both of these populations in the coming decades, it is imperative to 
evaluate potential interventions that are designed to help older cancer patients 
compensate for the additive burden of this disease and its treatment on 
age-related taste and smell losses.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to determine if providing 
instruction and products for flavor enhancement of foods to elderly cancer 
patients in addition to nutritional information would improve their nutritional 
status, and, by extension, functional and immune status as well as quality of 
life.
DESIGN: One hundred and seven subjects enrolled in the study. Fifty-four 
subjects were in the experimental group that received flavor enhancement plus 
nutritional information; fifty-three control subjects received only nutritional 
information. Subjects were evaluated 1 month, 3 months, and 8 months after 
beginning chemotherapy. At every session, subjects completed taste and smell 
assessments as well as questionnaires related to nutritional status, activities 
of daily living, and quality of life. Blood samples were also obtained to 
determine immune parameters.
RESULTS: At the eight-month time point, experimental subjects had better scores 
on the mini nutritional assessment (MNA) and the physical function assessment of 
the quality of life questionnaire. Also at eight months, self-reported taste and 
smell perception for experimental subjects was better than that of controls as 
well as better than at earlier time points. Tests that assessed quantity and 
quality of food intake, as well as a number of immune parameters declined over 
time and did not differ significantly between groups.
CONCLUSION: The combination of flavor enhancement, chemosensory education, and 
nutritional information for elderly cancer patients improved their nutritional 
assessment on the MNA and physical function over time. On the whole, 
experimental subjects perceived themselves to be better functioning at eight 
months than did their control counterparts.

BACKGROUND: The manner of measuring the outcome of cervical myelopathy must be 
patient-oriented and have sufficient reliability and validity. The current 
Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scoring system for cervical myelopathy is 
widely used but has not met this requirement. The first- and second-round 
surveys established 24 items for inclusion on a new questionnaire for cervical 
myelopathy. The purpose of this study (the third-round survey A) was to confirm 
the reproducibility of patient responses to the selected questions.
METHODS: A total of 201 patients with cervical myelopathy and with no change of 
symptoms between the two interviews were included. Each patient was interviewed 
twice using the same questionnaire at an interval of 4 weeks. The reliability of 
the questionnaire was evaluated by determining the extension of the weighted 
kappa coefficients.
RESULTS: The weighted kappa coefficient for each item was >0.4, confirming that 
the test-retest reliability was acceptable.
CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed JOA Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation 
Questionnaire was proven to have sufficient reliability.

Limited correlation between the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and 
EuroQol in rheumatoid arthritis: questionable validity of deriving quality 
adjusted life years from HAQ.

Education Centre, King's College, Cutcombe Road, London SE5 9RS, UK.

OBJECTIVES: There is growing emphasis on the cost-effectiveness of treating 
rheumatoid arthritis. Few trials directly record the health utility measures, 
like EuroQol, needed for economic analyses. Consequently linear regression 
methods have been used to transform Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) scores 
into utility measures. The authors examined whether this is justified.
METHODS: The authors compared HAQ and EuroQol in cross-sectional and treatment 
change observational studies of rheumatoid arthritis patients; they also 
measured SF-36 and Nottingham Health Profiles.
RESULTS: In the cross-sectional study, HAQ and EuroQol scores were moderately 
inversely correlated (Spearman rank correlation, r = 0.76). HAQ showed a 
Gaussian distribution whereas EuroQol was bimodal. In the treatment change 
study, changes in HAQ and EuroQol were unrelated (r = 0.08); the changes showed 
similar Gaussian and bimodal distributions.
CONCLUSIONS: Not all patient-based measures are analogous, and evidence of 
clinical equivalence, especially in treatment response, is needed before data 
transformation is considered. Specifically, as HAQ and EuroQol are demonstrably 
not equivalent, economic evaluations of treatment cost effectiveness should not 
be based on EuroQol data transformed from HAQ. The use of such transformed data 
by regulatory bodies which determine drug availability means that the issue is 
no longer only of academic interest but a real clinical concern.

Differential mortality in Iran.

a.lopez@sph.uq.edu.au.

BACKGROUND: Among the available data provided by health information systems, 
data on mortality are commonly used not only as health indicators but also as 
socioeconomic development indices. Recognizing that in Iran accurate data on 
causes of death were not available, the Deputy of Health in the Ministry of 
Health and Medical Education (MOH&ME) established a new comprehensive system for 
death registration which started in one province (Bushehr) as a pilot in 1997, 
and was subsequently expanded to include all other provinces, except Tehran 
province. These data can be used to investigate the nature and extent of 
differences in mortality in Iran. The objective of this paper is to estimate 
provincial differences in the level of mortality using this death registration 
system.
METHODS: Data from the death registration system for 2004 for each province were 
evaluated for data completeness, and life tables were created for provinces 
after correction for under-enumeration of death registration. For those 
provinces where it was not possible to adjust the data on adult deaths by using 
the Brass Growth Balance method, adult mortality was predicted based on adult 
literacy using information from provinces with reliable data.
RESULTS: Child mortality (risk of a newborn dying before age 5, or 5q0) in 2004 
varied between 47 per 1000 live births for both sexes in Sistan and Baluchistan 
province, and 25 per 1000 live births in Tehran and Gilan provinces. For adults, 
provincial differences in mortality were much greater for males than females. 
Adult mortality (risk of dying between ages 15 and 60, or 45q15) for females 
varied between 0.133 in Kerman province and 0.117 in Tehran province; for males 
the range was from 0.218 in Kerman to 0.149 in Tehran province. Life expectancy 
for females was highest in Tehran province (73.8 years) and lowest in Sistan and 
Baluchistan (70.9 years). For males, life expectancy ranged from 65.7 years in 
Sistan and Baluchistan province to 70.9 years in Tehran.
CONCLUSION: Substantial differences in survival exist among the provinces of 
Iran. While the completeness of the death registration system operated by the 
Iranian MOH&ME appears to be acceptable in the majority of provinces, further 
efforts are needed to improve the quality of data on mortality in Iran, and to 
expand death registration to Tehran province.

The burden of malaria in Sudan: incidence, mortality and disability--adjusted 
life--years.

Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan. drsafa@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: Estimating the burden of malaria in Sudan is important for 
evidence-based planning of malaria control. Estimates of malaria burden in terms 
of DALYs (Disability Adjusted Life Years) were not developed locally. This study 
synthesized information from different sources to calculate malaria incidence, 
mortality and DALYs lost in Sudan in 2002.
METHODS: A search for local studies and reports providing epidemiological data 
on malaria in Sudan was conducted. Preliminary estimates of incidence rate, case 
fatality rate and mortality rate were developed from the data found. The 
preliminary estimates were processed in the disease modelling computer software, 
DisMod II, to produce internally consistent mortality and incidence rates, which 
were used to calculate DALYs lost due to malaria.
RESULTS: Malaria incidence in Sudan was estimated to be about 9 million episodes 
in 2002 and the number of deaths due to malaria was about 44,000. 2,877,000 
DALYs were lost in Sudan in 2002 due to malaria mortality, episodes, anaemia and 
neurological sequelae. Children under five years of age had the highest burden. 
Males had the highest incidence and mortality, but females lost more DALYs.
CONCLUSION: Formal health system data underestimated malaria burden. The burden 
estimates can be useful in informing decision making, although uncertainty 
around them needs to be quantified. Epidemiological research is needed to fill 
data gaps and update the estimates.

Accurate prognoses are important in the care of patients with advanced cancer to 
assist clinicians in their decision making, and to help patients set their goals 
and priorities. Several studies have demonstrated that doctors are inaccurate 
and overly optimistic when predicting the survival of patients with advanced and 
terminal cancer. To improve prognostic accuracy, clinicians can use a number of 
factors that have proven to be associated with life expectancy: performance 
status, some signs and symptoms and some laboratory markers. Prognostic scores 
including most of the factors are also developed. Patients and their families 
can benefit from realistic prognostic information in a simple and empathetic 
manner.

Life expectancy for patients with breast carcinoma has changed in Europe over 
the last two decades. In Italy, the overall survival rate is about 77% at 5 
years. When considering the situation in Sicily, the EUROCARE 2 study examined 
survival data from the Ragusa Cancer Registry, showing that the curves are worse 
than in other regions of Italy. Starting from these considerations we decide to 
evaluate whether these data from the Ragusa Cancer Registry corresponded to 
Palermo data. So we analysed data from 575 consecutive patients with breast 
cancer, treated in our Breast Unit from 1990 to 2003 according to the St. Gallen 
Recommendations and followed for a median period of 5 years. The prognostic role 
of age, tumour size, nodal status, TNM, stage, grading and hormonal receptors 
(OR, PR) were analysed and survival curves at 5 and 10 years were produced using 
the actuarial survival methods. All causes of death were considered. The median 
follow-up was 33 months. The Log rank test and univariate cox proportional model 
were used to demonstrate the association between prognostic factors and outcome. 
When considering T and N status, the curves showed an inverse correlation 
between survival and increases in these parameters. Overall survival was 92.9% 
at 5 years and 81.4% at 10 years for T1, 78.4% at 5 years and 61.4% at 10 years 
for T2 and 40.8% for T3-T4 at 5 and 10 years. Overall survival for NO was 92.1% 
and 78.2%, respectively, at 5 and 10 years, but decreased to 72.0% and 59.9% at 
5 and 10 years for N1. In N2 patients we found that only about 50% of patients 
were still alive at 5 and 10 years, while for N3 patients the figures were 57.2% 
and 40%, respectively.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Greater life-expectancy has led to an increase in 
the incidence of severe aortic stenosis, which accounts for a significant 
proportion of the workload of cardiology departments. With the imminent arrival 
of percutaneous aortic valve prostheses, it is important to know how effective 
surgery currently is in octogenarians.
METHODS: The study included all patients aged >or=80 years with severe aortic 
stenosis who underwent cardiac catheterization prior to aortic valve replacement 
between May 1996 and May 2006. The percentage of patients who underwent surgery, 
outcomes at 30 days, long-term survival, and predictors of mortality were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 137 patients evaluated, 104 (75.9%) underwent surgery, while 33 
did not due to a low ejection fraction or severe chronic bronchitis, or because 
the patient's family did not give consent. The patients' mean age was 81.7 (1.5) 
years, 61.5% were female, 18.4% had diabetes, 7.8% had had a previous 
infarction, and 32.7% had coronary disease. Three patients (2.9%) had a 
perioperative myocardial infarction, six (5.8%) had a stroke, and six (5.8%) had 
a permanent pacemaker. Four patients (3.8%) died during the first 30 days. The 
survival rates at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 years were 90 (2.9), 81 (4.2), 78 (4.8), 
75 (5.3), 65 (7.2) and 60 (8.2)%, respectively. The following predictors of 
long-term mortality were identified: creatinine level, emergency surgery, and 
reintervention because of bleeding. Some 76.3% of patients remained in New York 
Heart Association functional class I-IV.
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve replacement can be performed successfully in patients 
aged >or=80 years with severe aortic stenosis; the complication rate was low, 
and the survival rate and long-term results were good. Predictors of mortality 
in this series were the creatinine level, emergency surgery, and reintervention 
because of bleeding.

Rights, responsibilities and NICE: a rejoinder to Harris.

Claxton K(1), Culyer AJ.

Author information:
(1)Centre for Health Economics, University of York, Heslington, York, UK.

Harris' reply to our defence of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence's 
(NICE) current cost-effectiveness procedures contains two further errors. First, 
he wrongly draws a conclusion from the fact that NICE does not and cannot 
evaluate all possible uses of healthcare resources at any one time and generally 
cannot know which National Health Service (NHS) activities would be displaced or 
which groups of patients would have to forgo health benefits: the inference is 
that no estimate is or can be made by NICE of the benefits to be forgone. This 
is a non-sequitur. Second, he asserts that it is a flaw at the heart of the use 
of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as an outcome measure that comparisons 
between people need to be made. Such comparisons do indeed have to be made, but 
this is not a consequence of the choice of any particular outcome measure, be it 
the QALY or anything else.

A response is given to the claim by Claxton and Culyer, who stated that the 
policies of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) do 
not evaluate patients rather than treatments. The argument is made that the use 
of values such as quality of life and life-years is ethically dubious when used 
to choose which patients ought to receive treatments in the National Health 
Service (NHS).

Comparison of the EuroQol and short form 6D in Singapore multiethnic Asian knee 
osteoarthritis patients scheduled for total knee replacement.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the EuroQol (EQ-5D) and Short Form 6D (SF-6D) among 
multiethnic Asian patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) scheduled for total 
knee replacement in Singapore.
METHODS: Patients were asked to complete questionnaires including the EQ-5D, 
Short Form 36, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index 
(WOMAC), and Lequesne knee index. EQ-5D and SF-6D utility scores were calculated 
using the scoring algorithms developed from the UK general population. Agreement 
between the 2 instruments was assessed by comparing their score distributions, 
means, medians, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and a Bland-Altman 
plot. Correlations of the EQ-5D and SF-6D with WOMAC and Lequesne knee index 
scores were also examined.
RESULTS: A consecutive sample of 258 knee OA patients (127 English-speaking and 
131 Chinese-speaking) participated. The mean +/- SD EQ-5D utility score was 0.49 
+/- 0.31 (range -0.25-1.00) and the mean SF-6D utility score was 0.63 +/- 0.12 
(range 0.32-0.89). In a hypothetical example, this 0.14-point difference in mean 
utility scores yielded a difference of $10,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
in cost-effectiveness ratios. The score distribution was bimodal for the EQ-5D 
and normal for the SF-6D. This poor agreement was also demonstrated by the 
Bland-Altman plot and the low ICC (range 0.18-0.54). Correlations of the WOMAC 
and Lequesne index with the EQ-5D were higher than with the SF-6D.
CONCLUSION: Using different preference-based health-related quality of life 
instruments may yield different utility scores, which could have a great impact 
on QALY estimates. This highlights the importance of selecting appropriate 
instruments for economic evaluation. Additional research is needed to determine 
which instrument (the EQ-5D or the SF-6D) should be used in OA patients.

OBJECTIVE: The number of individuals ages >or=100 years in the US is expected to 
increase considerably in the future along with the need for arthroplasties. This 
report focuses on the poorly studied epidemiology and mortality outcomes of 
arthroplasty among these individuals.
METHODS: We describe the epidemiology of knee and hip arthroplasties among 
centenarians using data from a large hospital discharge database in the US (the 
Nationwide Inpatient Sample) during the period 1993 through 2002. We used 
nonagenarians as the comparison group with adjustment for differences in the 
prevalence of congestive heart failure, neurologic diseases such as dementia and 
stroke, renal and hepatic diseases, obesity, anemia, malignancy, coagulopathy, 
and depression and other psychiatric illnesses. Cox regression models were used 
to study the mortality outcomes following arthroplasty.
RESULTS: Overall, there were 679 hip arthroplasties and 7 knee arthroplasties 
among centenarians in this database. The corresponding figures for nonagenarians 
were 33,975 and 2,050, respectively. A vast majority (83%) of hip arthroplasty 
recipients were women. Risk-adjusted mortality estimates following arthroplasty 
for centenarians were higher than for nonagenarians (hazard ratio 1.46, 95% 
confidence interval 1.10-1.95). However, this was similar to differences in 
overall in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio 1.36, 95% confidence interval 
1.32-1.40) between these 2 age categories.
CONCLUSION: In the US population, hip and knee arthroplasty are very rarely 
performed among centenarians. Our in-hospital mortality data suggest that 
arthroplasties should not be denied to centenarians solely because of short-term 
postoperative life expectancy estimates.

indices in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the relationship between preference-based measures, 
EuroQol (EQ-5D) and SF-6D, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) 
disability index (DI) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to 
characterize components that are predictors of health utility.
METHODS: Patients with RA participating in 2 studies in the UK (n = 151) and 
Canada (n = 319) completed the HAQ, EQ-5D, and Short Form 36 (SF-36). The SF-36, 
a generic measure of quality of life, was converted into the preference-based 
SF-6D. From these results we developed models of the relationship between the 
HAQ and SF-6D and EQ-5D using various regression analyses.
RESULTS: The optimal model developed for the EQ-5D entered levels for each item 
as independent variables (model 5). A root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.18 
suggested relatively good predictive ability. For the SF-6D, RMSEs were lower 
(0.09), suggesting better predictions than for the EQ-5D, but models with more 
explanatory variables did not improve results (model 2 or 4 optimal). The models 
were able to predict actual SF-6D and EQ-5D across the range of the HAQ DI.
CONCLUSION: Our approach enabled calculations of quality-adjusted life years 
from existing trials where only the HAQ was measured. All aspects of the HAQ may 
not be reflected in the preference-based measures, and this method is suboptimal 
to direct measurement of health state utility in clinical trials. Given this 
limitation, our approach provides an alternative for researchers who need 
health-state utility values, but had not included a preference-based measure in 
their clinical study because of resource constraints or a desire to limit 
patient burden.

Although there is little direct information or prospective cohort study on the 
incidence and prevalence of critical limb ischemia (CLI), it can be calculated 
that the incidence of CLI is approximately 500 to 1,000 per million per year in 
Western countries and 100 to 200 in Japan. The most important risk factor for 
the development of CLI is diabetes as well as age, cigarette smoking, lipid 
abnormalities, and low ankle brachial pressure index. Without pharmacotherapy or 
interventions, approximately 40% of CLI patients will lose their leg within 6 
months, whereas up to 20% will die. As most generally have widespread 
atherothrombosis in various organs such as ischemic heart disease, 
cerebrovascular disease, and renal dysfunction, patients with CLI have 20% 
mortality in the first year. The early hospital mortality rate after amputation 
is high and the long-term survival rate of amputees is low. An attempt to 
perform optimal revascularization to keep the level of amputation below the knee 
is mandatory to prevent above-knee amputation resulting in poor life expectancy 
and loss of full mobility.

The market for neuropharmaceuticals is potentially one of the largest sectors of 
the global pharmaceutical market owing to the increase in average life 
expectancy and the fact that many neurological disorders have been largely 
refractory to pharmacotherapy. The brain is a delicate organ that can 
efficiently protect itself from harmful compounds and precisely regulate its 
microenvironment. Unfortunately, the same mechanisms can also prove to be 
formidable hurdles in drug development. An improved understanding of the 
regulatory interfaces that exist between blood and brain may provide novel and 
more effective strategies to treat neurological disorders.

Increased life expectancy in patients with homozygous beta-thalassaemia 
consequently increases the risk for neoplastic diseases. This study was 
conducted to assess the levels of five common tumour markers in thalassaemic 
patients and to investigate possible correlations to demographical, clinical and 
laboratory data. Eighty-five patients (44 female and 41 male) with homozygous 
beta-thalassaemia (mean age = 27.92 +/- 12.5), on regular blood transfusions and 
adequate chelation treatment, and 60 sex and age- matched healthy controls were 
enrolled in the study. Blood samples for the determination of carcinoma antigen 
(CA) 15.3, CA 125, CA 19.9, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and alpha-fetoprotein 
(a-FP) were collected from every subject. Results showed that 69% of the 
thalassaemic patients had abnormal levels of CA 15.3, whereas only sporadic 
cases had increased levels of CA 125 and CA 19.9. On the contrary, all controls 
had normal levels of CA 15.3, CA 19.9 and CA 125. CEA and a-FP were within 
reference ranges both in the thalassaemic and in the control group. Levels of CA 
15.3 were significantly lower in patients aged less than 20 years compared to 
older patients. Male patients had significantly increased levels of CA 15.3 
compared to female patients. Relatively recent studies show an increased 
expression of CA 15.3 on progenitor cells of the erythroid lineage and increased 
amounts of circulating progenitor cells even in well-transfused thalassaemic 
patients. However, it seems that there are also other factors contributing to 
this phenomenon. In conclusion, our results indicate that CA 15.3 seems to be an 
unreliable marker of occult malignancy in patients with beta-thalassaemia. 
However, more studies are needed to support these preliminary results.

82 patients with adenolymphoma of parotid gland treated with surgery in 
Department of Oncological Surgery Cancer Center, Gliwice in the period of 
1986-2004 were retrospectively analyzed. They were about 22% of all patients 
with parotid gland tumors operated in that period. In almost 70% of cases 
partial parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation was performed as a 
treatment of choice. In that group DFS was over 95%. Local recurrence occurred 
in less then 5%, only in cases with multiple tumor in histopathological 
examinations. Quality of life parameters were also analyzed. In the analysis 
complications rate increased with the extension of surgical treatment. It 
revealed in the postoperative cosmetic defect evaluation. Partial resection of 
the parotid gland could be useful method of surgical treatment of adenolymphoma 
selected cases. It allows to achieve the same results as classic parotidectomy 
with lower risk of significant complications. In analyzed group the local 
recurrence was always combined with multi lesional growth of the tumor.

OBJECTIVES: To assess whether omission of postoperative radiotherapy in women 
with 'low-risk' axillary node negative breast cancer (T0-2) treated by 
breast-conserving surgery and endocrine therapy improves quality of life and is 
more cost-effective.
DESIGN: A randomised controlled clinical trial, using a method of minimisation 
balanced by centre, grade of cancer, age, lymphatic/vascular invasion and 
preoperative endocrine therapy, was performed. A non-randomised cohort was also 
recruited, in order to complete a comprehensive cohort study.
SETTING: The setting was breast cancer clinics in cancer centres in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 years or more were eligible provided that their 
cancers were considered to be at low risk of local recurrence, were suitable for 
breast-conservation surgery, were receiving endocrine therapy and were able and 
willing to give informed consent.
INTERVENTIONS: The standard treatment of postoperative breast irradiation or the 
omission of radiotherapy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality of life was the primary outcome measure, together 
with anxiety and depression and cost-effectiveness. Secondary outcome measures 
were recurrence rates, functional status, treatment-related morbidity and 
cosmesis. The principal method of data collection was by questionnaire, 
completed at home with a research nurse at four times over 15 months.
RESULTS: The hypothesised improvement in overall quality of life with the 
omission of radiotherapy was not seen in the EuroQol assessment or in the 
functionality and symptoms summary domains of the European Organisation for 
Research in the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) scales. Some differences were 
apparent within subscales of the EORTC questionnaires, and insights into the 
impact of treatment were also provided by the qualitative data obtained by 
open-ended questions. Differences were most apparent shortly after the time of 
completion of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy was then associated with increased 
breast symptoms and with greater fatigue but with less insomnia and endocrine 
side-effects. Patients had significant concerns about the delivery of 
radiotherapy services, such as transport, accommodation and travel costs 
associated with receiving radiotherapy. By the end of follow-up, patients 
receiving radiotherapy were expressing less anxiety about recurrence than those 
who had not received radiotherapy. Functionality was not greatly affected by 
treatment. Within the randomised controlled trial, the Barthel Index 
demonstrated a small but significant fall in functionality with radiotherapy 
compared with the no radiotherapy arm of the trial. Results from the 
non-randomised patients did not confirm this effect, however. Cosmetic results 
were better in those not receiving radiotherapy but this did not appear to be an 
important issue to the patients. The use of home-based assessments by a research 
nurse proved to be an effective way of obtaining high-quality data. Costs to the 
NHS associated with postoperative radiotherapy were calculated to be of the 
order of 2000 pounds per patient. In the follow-up in this study, there were no 
recurrences, and the quality of life utilities from EuroQol were almost 
identical.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there are no differences in overall quality of life scores 
between the patients treated with and without radiotherapy, there are several 
dimensions that exhibit significant advantage to the omission of irradiation. 
Over the first 15 months, radiotherapy for this population is not a 
cost-effective treatment. However, the early postoperative outcome does not give 
a complete answer and the eventual cost-effectiveness will only become clear 
after long-term follow-up. Extrapolations from these data suggest that 
radiotherapy may not be a cost-effective treatment unless it results in a 
recurrence rate that is at least 5% lower in absolute terms than those treated 
without radiotherapy. Further research is needed into a number of areas 
including the long-term aspects of quality of life, clinical outcomes, costs and 
consequences of omitting radiotherapy.

Is surveillance an option for the treatment of small renal masses?

Van Poppel H(1), Joniau S.

Author information:
(1)Department of Urology, University Hospital, K.U. Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.

OBJECTIVES: To review the natural history and biological potential of small 
renal masses in order to evaluate whether surveillance is an option for 
treatment of small renal masses.
METHODS: Literature search of MEDLINE and additional references from 
non-MEDLINE-indexed publications concerning surveillance of small renal masses.
RESULTS: Because approximately 26-33% of observed small renal masses do not show 
radiographic growth, it has been suggested that a brief period of active 
surveillance may be feasible for selected renal masses, with treatment limited 
to tumours showing growth. Even though tumour growth might be absent or slow, a 
proportion of these tumours will express significant malignant behaviour. The 
biological behaviour of a tumour cannot be unambiguously predicted at present. 
Surveillance of small renal masses should only be considered in elderly and/or 
infirm patients with competing health risks, in those with limited life 
expectancy, and in those for whom surgery is not an option. In all other 
patients, active surveillance can be considered in the context of a study 
protocol only. In the majority of the patients, nephron-sparing surgery remains 
the gold standard treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance should only be considered as an alternative to surgery 
for the treatment of small renal masses in selected patients. It should always 
be combined with close follow-up imaging and should be allowed only when the 
patient and the urologist accept the calculated risk. Long-term, prospective 
studies are needed to provide a more accurate assessment of the natural history 
and metastastic potential of small renal masses.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate our experience 
in urgent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with acute neurological 
symptoms comparing them with results obtained in stable symptomatic patients in 
a case-control study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 1996 to December 2005, 3336 consecutive CEAs 
were performed at our department. In 70 cases CEA was carried out in patients 
with acute neurological deficit; in all these patients, clinical presentations 
were recent (<24 h) or crescendo (defined as two or more episodes in 24 h, with 
complete recovery after each episode) TIAs (group 1). The control group was 
randomly obtained from our historical database and consisted of 352 stable 
symptomatic patients operated on in the same period (group 2). Early (30-day) 
results in the two groups were compared by chi(2) and Fisher exact tests; 
follow-up data were analysed by life-table analysis (Kaplan-Meier test) and 
results in subgroups were compared by means of log-rank test.
RESULTS: Considering mortality and any neurological morbidity, the patients of 
group 1 showed a cumulative rate of death and neurological complication 
significantly higher than those in group 2 (5.4% and 0.3%, respectively; 
P=0.005); however, when analysing 30-day disabling strokes and deaths, the 
patients of group 1 had a cumulative complication rate of 1.4%, whereas in group 
2 the corresponding figure was 0.3% (P=n.s.). In patients of group 1, univariate 
analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis for 30-day risk of 
stroke and death did not show any influence of comorbidities, clinical status, 
anatomical and surgical features. Estimated cumulative 36-month survival was 
significantly better in group 2 than in group 1. Considering the absence of 
ipsilateral stroke at 36 months, there were no differences between the two 
groups; however, analysing the estimated absence of any neurological events, 
both ipsilateral and contralateral, at 36 months, patients of group 1 had a 
higher risk than those of group 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Urgent CEA in patients with recent/crescendo TIA and appropriate 
carotid artery lesion, carries good early and long-term results, which, however, 
remain slightly poorer than those obtained in symptomatic patients with a stable 
neurological status.

The aim of the current study was to analyse postoperative complications and 
survival after video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) talc pleurodesis for 
malignant pleural effusion. All patients with morphologically proven malignant 
pleural effusion who underwent VATS talc pleurodesis from November 1995 to 
November 2002 were included in retrospective analysis. VATS was performed in 
general anaesthesia and 5 g of asbestos-free talc was insufflated into the 
pleural cavity. Postoperative pleural drainage was used until fluid output was 
less than 100 ml/24 h. Ninety-eight patients (28 male and 70 female) with mean 
age 59.6 (range 18-82) years were included. Thirteen patients had a bilateral
