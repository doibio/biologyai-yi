BACKGROUND: Panic disorder (PD) is associated with impaired functioning and 
reduced quality of life. In the Netherlands, almost 2% of the population 
experiences clinically relevant panic symptoms without meeting the diagnostic 
criteria for PD, which is referred to as subthreshold PD (STHPD). Evidence 
suggests that subthreshold mental disorders may have a similar impact on quality 
of life and functioning in comparison with full-blown mental disorders, which 
draws attention to the need for interventions for STHPD. These interventions are 
currently not systematically provided in clinical practice. This study aims to 
investigate the population cost-effectiveness of adding a CBT-based early 
intervention for adults with STHPD to the existing health care for people with 
PD in the Netherlands.
METHODS: A health-economic Markov model was constructed in order to compare 
quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) and societal costs of adding an early 
intervention to usual care for PD. The model compares usual care with an 
alternative program in which usual care is supplemented with a CBT-based early 
intervention. Input parameters for the model were derived from national sources 
and published literature where possible, and based on expert opinion otherwise. 
Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate 
the uncertainty of the model input parameters.
RESULTS: On average, the added CBT-based early intervention was dominant in 
comparison with usual care, meaning that the early intervention yielded more 
QALYs at lower costs. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per QALY, the 
cost-effectiveness probability of the added early intervention was 98%. 
Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that offering an early intervention in addition 
to usual care for PD is potentially cost-effective, but it should be further 
investigated to what extent trial results can be extrapolated to the level of 
the population before such interventions are implemented on a large scale.

PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term outcomes of endovascular aneurysm repair 
(EVAR) and open surgical repair (OSR) of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm in 
octogenarian patients and to compare them with the overall expected survival 
based on a sex- and age-matched German population.
METHODS: A total of 177 patients (median age 82 years; 149 men) ≥80 years old 
(range 80-92) who underwent primary elective repair of an infrarenal aortic 
aneurysm (≥5 cm) between 1998 and 2015 were identified in a database search. Two 
groups of patients were formed based on the type of procedure: 131 EVAR patients 
(median age 83 years; 114 men) and 46 OSR patients (median age 82 years; 35 
men).
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 5 years for the OSR group and 4.5 years for 
the EVAR group. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no significant difference in 
survival between the EVAR and OSR groups at 78 months. The observed survival of 
all study patients was not statistically different from the expected survival of 
a sex- and age-matched German population, which was true separately for women 
and men.
CONCLUSION: The patients in this study seemed to reach normal life expectancy in 
comparison to the age- and sex-matched general population with a similar 
cumulative survival in both study groups over 5 years of follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is increasingly applied in patients 
with multiple brain metastases and is expected to have less adverse effects in 
cognitive functioning than whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Effective 
treatment with the least negative cognitive side effects is increasingly 
becoming important, as more patients with brain metastases live longer due to 
more and better systemic treatment options. There are no published randomized 
trials yet directly comparing GKRS to WBRT in patients with multiple brain 
metastases that include objective neuropsychological testing.
METHODS: CAR-Study B is a prospective randomised trial comparing cognitive 
outcome after GKRS or WBRT in adult patients with 11-20 newly diagnosed brain 
metastases on a contrast-enhanced MRI-scan, KPS ≥70 and life expectancy of at 
least 3 months. Randomisation by the method of minimization, is stratified by 
the cumulative tumour volume in the brain, systemic treatment, KPS, histology, 
baseline cognitive functioning and age. The primary endpoint is the 
between-group difference in the percentage of patients with significant memory 
decline at 3 months. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, local 
control, development of new brain metastases, cognitive functioning over time, 
quality of life, depression, anxiety and fatigue. Cognitive functioning is 
assessed by a standardised neuropsychological test battery. Assessments 
(cognitive testing, questionnaires and MRI-scans) are scheduled at baseline and 
at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months after treatment.
DISCUSSION: Knowledge gained from this trial may be used to inform individual 
patients with BM more precisely about the cognitive effects they can expect from 
treatment, and to assist both doctors and patients in making (shared) individual 
treatment decisions. This trial is currently recruiting. Target accrual: 23 
patients at 3-months follow-up in both groups.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Netherlands Trials Register number NTR5463. 
ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT02953717 , first received October 27, 
2016, 8 patients were enrolled in this study on 31 July 2017.

Advanced age is not only a major risk factor for a range of disorders within an 
aging individual but may also enhance susceptibility for disease in the next 
generation. In humans, advanced paternal age has been associated with increased 
risk for a number of diseases. Experiments in rodent models have provided 
initial evidence that paternal age can influence behavioral traits in offspring 
animals, but the overall scope and extent of paternal age effects on health and 
disease across the life span remain underexplored. Here, we report that old 
father offspring mice showed a reduced life span and an exacerbated development 
of aging traits compared with young father offspring mice. Genome-wide 
epigenetic analyses of sperm from aging males and old father offspring tissue 
identified differentially methylated promoters, enriched for genes involved in 
the regulation of evolutionarily conserved longevity pathways. Gene expression 
analyses, biochemical experiments, and functional studies revealed evidence for 
an overactive mTORC1 signaling pathway in old father offspring mice. 
Pharmacological mTOR inhibition during the course of normal aging ameliorated 
many of the aging traits that were exacerbated in old father offspring mice. 
These findings raise the possibility that inherited alterations in longevity 
pathways contribute to intergenerational effects of aging in old father 
offspring mice.

There are powerful demographic, political, and environmental trends shaping 
women's health. Increases in life expectancy, literacy, and empowerment are 
fueling expansions in education and advocacy. Research and development focuses 
on women's health and fertility across an expanded age spectrum. There is also a 
cultural emphasis on antiaging and aesthetics. In parallel, the digital 
revolution is changing how health care is accessed by and delivered to women. A 
women's journey through menopause is at the crossroads of these transformations. 
Medical and social platforms encourage women to embrace menopause as a pivotal 
life stage. Yet, many women are reticent to discuss "the transition" due to 
embarrassment about its symptoms, lack of awareness of its physical 
manifestations, or fear of aging. We introduce a patient-centric framework to 
support patient-provider engagement on menopause: prevention, anxiety, 
urogenital symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and education. Although not 
comprehensive, PAUSE represents an acronym and reminder to focus a portion of 
the medical interaction on menopause.

Absence of neoplastic disease in the organ-recipient is required in order to 
allow organ transplantation. Due to its rarity, no data regarding management of 
patients with Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and end-stage renal 
failure candidates for kidney transplantation are available. A 36 year-old man 
was referred to the present hospital with MEN1, with a neuroendocrine pancreatic 
tumor and primary hyperparathyroidism and associated Alport syndrome with end 
stage renal failure. The present study aimed to establish the eligibility of the 
patient for a kidney transplantation. The neuroendocrine tumor had been treated 
with duodenopancreatectomy two years earlier and hyperparathyroidism by 
parathyroidectomy. The review of the literature did not provide data regarding 
the eligibility for kidney transplantation of patients harboring a 
neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor in the context of MEN1. Due to the end-stage 
renal failure, neuroendocrine markers were unreliable and the investigation 
therefore relied on imaging studies, which were unremarkable. Young age, 
low-grade tumor, low expression of Ki67, absence of metastatic lymph nodes, 
onset in the setting of a MEN1 were all positive prognostic factors of the 
neuroendocrine tumor. Normal serum calcium ruled out persistent primary 
hyperparathyroidism. Overall, hemodyalisis is known to significantly reduce life 
expectancy. Benefits of kidney transplantation overcome the risk of 
neuroendocrine tumor recurrence in a young patient bearing MEN1.

Concomitant radiochemotherapy followed by six cycles of temozolomide (= short 
term) is considered as standard therapy for adults with newly diagnosed 
glioblastoma. In contrast, open-end administration of temozolomide until 
progression (= long-term) is proposed by some authors as a viable alternative. 
We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of long-term temozolomide therapy 
for patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma compared to standard therapy. A 
Markov model was constructed to compare medical costs and clinical outcomes for 
both therapy types over a time horizon of 60 months. Transition probabilities 
for standard therapy were calculated from randomized controlled trial data by 
Stupp et al. The data for long-term temozolomide therapy was collected by 
matching a cohort treated in the Department of Neurosurgery at Jena University 
Hospital. Health utilities were obtained from a previous cost utility study. The 
cost perspective was based on health insurance. The base case analysis showed a 
median overall survival of 17.1 months and a median progression-free survival of 
7.4 months for patients in the long-term temozolomide therapy arm. The 
cost-effectiveness analysis using all base case parameters in a time-dependent 
Markov model resulted in an incremental effectiveness of 0.022 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
€351,909/QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed that parameters with the most 
influence on ICER were the health state utility of progression in both therapy 
arms. Although open-ended temozolomide therapy is very expensive, the ICER of 
this therapy is comparable to that of the standard temozolomide therapy for 
patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma.

OBJECTIVE: Policymakers increasingly require scientific evidence on both health 
and economic consequences of different nutritional patterns. The aim of this 
study was to assess health and economic effects of Mediterranean and 
soy-containing diets. Selected countries were Belgium and the United Kingdom.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of these plant-based food patterns was assessed in 
comparison with a "conventional" diet using an age- and sex-dependent prediction 
model. The model allowed the prediction of health outcomes and related health 
care costs for the food patterns over 20 y. A societal perspective was applied 
for cost calculation and health outcomes were expressed in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: For Belgium, a soy-containing diet is estimated to lead to 202 QALYs 
and 107 QALYs per 1000 women and men, respectively, whereas societal savings of 
€2 146 000 and €1 653 000 are predicted. For the United Kingdom, a gain of 159 
QALYs and 100 QALYs per 1000 women and men, respectively, is estimated, as are a 
prediction of savings of £1 580 000 and £1 606 000. For the Mediterranean diet 
in the corresponding estimates for Belgium are 184 QALYs and 148 QALYs per 1000 
women and men, respectively, and savings of €1 618 000 and €1 595 000. For the 
United Kingdom, these are 122 QALYs and 110 QALYs per 1000 women and men, 
respectively, and savings of £1 155 000 and £1 046 000, respectively.
CONCLUSION: A wider implementation of plant-based eating would lead to large net 
economic gains for society and improved health outcomes for the population.

The development of proteasome inhibitors contributed to the dramatic life 
expectancy improvement observed in myeloma patients over the past decades. 
Ixazomib is a boron-containing selective and reversible proteasome inhibitor 
that demonstrated antimyeloma activity with excellent safety profile. Ixazomib 
is the first orally available proteasome inhibitor approved in combination with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of myeloma patients who 
received at least one prior therapy. The present review addresses the current 
knowledge regarding the clinical use of ixazomib in relapsed myeloma patients.

Canada.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal 
dominant inherited disease characterized by telangiectasia and arteriovenous 
malformations (AVMs). To date, five genetic types of HHT and one combined 
juvenile polyposis syndrome and HHT are known. Clinical and genetic screening of 
patients suspected with HHT is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and to 
prevent complications associated with HHT. The aim of this article is to give an 
overview of the evidence and to formulate a recommendation for clinicians 
concerning screening for HHT.
RECENT FINDINGS: Complications of HHT such as stroke, brain abscess and 
intracranial hemorrhage are caused by pulmonary and cerebral AVMs (CAVMs) and 
can often be prevented by screening and treatment when possible. Screening and 
treatment of these AVMs will result in an increased life expectancy comparable 
with that of the general population as opposed to unscreened and untreated HHT 
patients.
SUMMARY: Screening of HHT patients and their first-degree relatives is 
recommended to prevent severe complications including stroke, brain abscess and 
intracranial hemorrhage.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Air pollution is established as an independent risk factor 
for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Ambient particulate matter (PM), a principal 
component of air pollutant, has been considered as a main culprit of the adverse 
effects of air pollution on human health.
RECENT FINDINGS: Extensive epidemiological and toxicological studies have 
demonstrated particulate air pollution is positively associated with the 
development of CVDs. Short-term PM exposure can trigger acute cardiovascular 
events while long-term exposure over years augments cardiovascular risk to an 
even greater extent and can reduce life expectancy by a few years. Inhalation of 
PM affects heart rate variability, blood pressure, vascular tone, blood 
coagulability, and the progression of atherosclerosis. The potential molecular 
mechanisms of PM-caused CVDs include direct toxicity to the cardiovascular 
system or indirect injury by inducing systemic inflammation and oxidative stress 
in circulation. This review mainly focuses on the acute and chronic effects of 
ambient PM exposure on the development of cardiovascular diseases and the 
possible mechanisms for PM-induced increases in cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality. Additionally, we summarized some appropriate interventions to 
attenuate PM air pollution-induced cardiovascular adverse effects, which may 
promote great benefits to public health.

In most countries, surprisingly little is known on how national healthcare 
spending is distributed across diseases. Single-disease cost-of-illness studies 
cover only a few of the diseases affecting a population and in some cases lead 
to untenably large estimates. The objective of this study was to decompose 
healthcare spending in 2011, according to Swiss National Health Accounts, into 
21 collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive major disease categories. 
Diseases were classified following the Global Burden of Disease Study. We first 
assigned the expenditures directly mapping from National Health Accounts to the 
21 diseases. The remaining expenditures were assigned based on diagnostic codes 
and clues contained in a variety of microdata sources. Expenditures were 
dominated by non-communicable diseases with a share of 79.4%. Cardiovascular 
diseases stood out with 15.6% of total spending, followed by musculoskeletal 
disorders (13.4%), and mental and substance use disorders (10.6%). Neoplasms 
(6.0% of the total) ranked only sixth, although they are the leading cause of 
premature death in Switzerland. These results may be useful for the design of 
health policies, as they illustrate how healthcare spending is influenced by the 
epidemiological transition and increasing life expectancy. They also provide a 
plausibility check for single cost-of-illness studies. Our study may serve as a 
starting point for further research on the drivers of the constant growth of 
healthcare spending.

BACKGROUND: This study explored the cumulative incidence of anemia after 
gastrectomy in patients with early-stage gastric cancer and evaluated the 
relationship between postgastrectomy anemia and nutritional factors during 
long-term follow-up.
METHODS: The medical records of patients with stage I gastric cancer who 
underwent curative gastrectomy between January 2006 and December 2013 were 
reviewed retrospectively. Hematologic parameters like hemoglobin, iron, 
ferritin, and vitamin B12 level were obtained prior to and after surgery with 
other nutritional parameters such as total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, 
triglyceride, calcium, and phosphate. Postoperative follow-up was conducted at 6 
months after surgery and then annually for 5 years.
RESULTS: Among 566 patients who did not have anemia preoperatively, 240 (42.4%) 
experienced anemia at least once during the 5 years after gastrectomy. These 240 
patients (the anemia group) showed lower preoperative levels of hemoglobin, 
iron, ferritin, and triglyceride than those of the patients who did not 
experience anemia (the normal group). Total gastrectomy, advanced T stage, and 
lymph node metastasis were significantly more common in the anemia group 
compared with the normal group. During long-term follow-up, the anemia group 
showed significantly lower serum levels of nutritional markers, especially 
triglycerides, compared with the normal group. The overall survival rate was 
significantly lower in the anemia group than in the normal group.
CONCLUSIONS: Anemia was common among gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy. 
Total gastrectomy and advanced T stage were identified as independent risk 
factors for postgastrectomy anemia. In addition, anemia might be associated with 
nutritional problems and a poor prognosis. Thus, regular monitoring and 
appropriate management of postgastrectomy anemia are important for early-stage 
gastric cancer patients with a long life expectancy.

Income inequality has been clearly associated with reduced population health. A 
body of evidence suggests that a strong primary care system may mitigate this 
negative association. The aim of this study is to assess the strength of the 
primary care system's effect on the inverse association between income 
inequality and health in Europe. Health is operationalised using four 
cross-sectional outcomes: self-rated health, life expectancy, mental well-being, 
and infant mortality. Strength of the primary care system is measured using the 
framework of the Primary Health Care Activity Monitor Europe, and income 
inequality by the Gini coefficient. Multiple regression models with interaction 
terms were used. The results confirm that especially the structure and 
continuity dimension of primary care strength can buffer the inverse association 
between income inequality and health. European policymakers should therefore 
focus on strengthening primary care systems in order to reduce inequity in 
health.

The objective of this research was to optimize antioxidant potential of 
hydrolyzed protein using Flavourzyme assisted hydrolysis of turkey meat and 
compare the antioxidant activity of hydrolysates from turkey meat, chicken, and 
beef. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine the optimal 
Flavourzyme hydrolysis conditions for preparation of hydrolysate from turkey 
meat, which were at a temperature of 50.09°C, pH of 5.42, and processing time of 
1.08 hours. For comparison, antioxidant activities of the hydrolysate from 
turkey meat, chicken, and beef under the optimum conditions were determined 
using reducing power, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) 
(ABTS) radical cation, hydroxyl radical, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 
(DPPH) radical scavenging activities. The antioxidant activity of turkey meat 
and chicken meat was significantly higher than that of beef (P < 0.05). 
Therefore Flavourzyme could be regarded as an effective hydrolytic enzyme for 
preparation of antioxidant hydrolysate from turkey meat, indicating the 
potential use of it as a functional food ingredient with shelf-life extension 
purposes.

[Which drugs in Hemato-Oncology are Unnecessary or Inappropriate for Use in the 
Elderly?].

[Article in German]

Goede V, Hallek M.

There is a vast amount of drugs and therapeutic regimens available today to 
treat hemato-oncological diseases. This offers new opportunities to close known 
gaps of undertreatment in older individuals with cancer, but also increases the 
risk of overtreatment in this patient group. Currently available criteria (drug 
listings) for potentially inadequate prescribing in the elderly are not matured 
enough to serve hemato-oncologists as a guidance when trying to identify 
unnecessary or inappropriate cancer medication in routine clinical practice. In 
some clinical situations (e. g., decision-making for adjuvant treatment), online 
tools that allow for a rough prediction of remaining life expectancy (without or 
with cancer) as well as chemotherapy toxicity could help to detect risks of 
overtreatment in individual patients, however. Avoiding chemotherapy in distinct 
therapeutic situations has become possible for some hematological and solid 
tumors due to a growing number of novel targeted (i. e. non-cytostatic) drugs. 
This development appears of particular benefit for elderly patients. The present 
review discusses tools that generally could support the identification of 
overtreatment in older patients with such diseases. Drug examples are presented 
for some common hemato-oncological entities.

[Type 2 Diabetes Diabetes in Older Adults: Example for Patient-Centered Drug 
Therapy].

[Article in German]

Müller-Wieland D.

Diabetes in older adults has a high prevalence and is frequently associated with 
comorbidities of the cardiovascular system, dysfunction of cognition as well as 
depression and impaired mobility or increased frailty. Furthermore, impaired 
renal function, heart failure, risk for hypoglycemia and polypharmacy has to be 
considered in the decision about the diabetes treatment strategy. The goal of 
blood glucose management is driven by patient relevant issues and patient 
self-esteem, quality of life defined by the patient, preservation of physical 
and social mobility rather than potential long-term effects on reduction of 
cardio- and microvascular events in the future, which is limited by 
patient-inherent reduced life expectancy of the aged individual. Therefore, 
long-term diabetes medication should avoid hypoglycemia and prevent acute 
hyperglycemia or short-term complications on morbidity and clinical course of 
geriatric syndromes associated with regular blood glucose levels above 200 mg/dl 
(11.1 mmol/l). The therapy should be safe, easy to handle for the patient and 
possibly affect co-morbidities positively. However, there are limited data 
available about efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of drugs in patients over 
75 years of age or older. Since more than 5 % of the population in Germany is 
older than 80 years means that more than 1 million of these individuals suffer 
from diabetes. It is time to ask for data in these elderly subpopulations by 
policy makers in health care.

BACKGROUND: Depression is viewed as a major and increasing public health issue, 
as it causes high distress in the people experiencing it and considerable 
financial costs to society. Efforts are being made to reduce this burden by 
preventing depression. A critical component of this strategy is the ability to 
assess the individual level and profile of risk for the development of major 
depression. This paper presents the cost-effectiveness of a personalized 
intervention based on the risk of developing depression carried out in primary 
care, compared with usual care.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analyses are nested within a multicentre, clustered, 
randomized controlled trial of a personalized intervention to prevent 
depression. The study was carried out in 70 primary care centres from seven 
cities in Spain. Two general practitioners (GPs) were randomly sampled from 
those prepared to participate in each centre (i.e. 140 GPs), and 3326 
participants consented and were eligible to participate. The intervention 
included the GP communicating to the patient his/her individual risk for 
depression and personal risk factors and the construction by both GPs and 
patients of a psychosocial programme tailored to prevent depression. In 
addition, GPs carried out measures to activate and empower the patients, who 
also received a leaflet about preventing depression. GPs were trained in a 10- 
to 15-h workshop. Costs were measured from a societal and National Health care 
perspective. Qualityadjustedlife years were assessed using the EuroQOL five 
dimensions questionnaire. The time horizon was 18 months.
RESULTS: With a willingness-to-pay threshold of €10,000 (£8568) the probability 
of cost-effectiveness oscillated from 83% (societal perspective) to 89% (health 
perspective). If the threshold was increased to €30,000 (£25,704), the 
probability of being considered cost-effective was 94% (societal perspective) 
and 96%, respectively (health perspective). The sensitivity analysis confirmed 
these results.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with usual care, an intervention based on personal 
predictors of risk of depression implemented by GPs is a cost-effective strategy 
to prevent depression. This type of personalized intervention in primary care 
should be further developed and evaluated.

INTRODUCTION: Although autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is the most 
common hereditary kidney disease, available data tend to be limited to after 
initiation of renal replacement therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To ascertain an overview of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney 
disease within the health area of Granada in southern Spain.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2007 to December 2016, we collected clinical, 
family and demographic information about all patients with autosomal dominant 
polycystic kidney disease, irrespective of whether or not they were treated with 
RRT, in the Granada health area. The computer software SPSS 15.0 and GenoPro 
were used.
RESULTS: 50.6% of the 1,107 diagnosed patients were men. 99.1% were Caucasian 
and 4-6 generations/family were studied. The geographical distribution was 
heterogeneous. There was no family history in 2.43%. The mean age of diagnosis 
was 34.0±17.80 years and the diagnosis was made after having offspring in 57.7% 
of cases. The main reason for diagnosis was family history (46.4%). The mean age 
of initiation of renal replacement therapy was 54.2±11.05 years. 96.3% of the 
deceased had some degree of renal failure at the time of death. The mean age of 
death was 60.9±14.10 years, the main cause of death being unknown in 33.5% of 
cases, followed by cardiovascular (27.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Cases and families were concentrated in certain geographical areas 
and a significant number of individuals were undiagnosed prior to cardiovascular 
death or diagnosed late after reproduction. Given that there is currently no 
curative treatment, the primary prevention strategy of preimplantation genetic 
diagnosis should play a leading role.
