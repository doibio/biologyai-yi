BACKGROUND: Despite being comparatively egalitarian welfare states, the Nordic 
countries have not been successful in reducing health inequalities. Previous 
studies have suggested that smoking and alcohol contribute to this pattern. Few 
studies have focused on variations in alcohol-related and smoking-related 
mortality within the Nordic countries. We assess the contribution of smoking and 
alcohol to differences in life expectancy between countries and between income 
quintiles within countries.
METHODS: We collected data from registers in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden 
comprising men and women aged 25-79 years during 1995-2007. Estimations of 
alcohol-related mortality were based on underlying and contributory causes of 
death on individual death certificates, and smoking-related mortality was based 
on an indirect method that used lung cancer mortality as an indicator for the 
population-level impact of smoking on mortality.
RESULTS: About 40%-70% of the between-country differences in life expectancy in 
the Nordic countries can be attributed to smoking and alcohol. Alcohol-related 
and smoking-related mortality also made substantial contributions to income 
differences in life expectancy within countries. The magnitude of the 
contributions were about 30% in Norway, Sweden and among Finnish women to around 
50% among Finnish men and in Denmark.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking and alcohol consumption make substantial contributions to 
both between-country differences in mortality among the Nordic countries and 
within-country differences in mortality by income. The size of these 
contributions vary by country and sex.

BACKGROUND: Global warming is going to affect both agricultural production and 
carbon storage in soil worldwide. Given the complexity of the 
soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, in situ experiments of climate warming are 
necessary to predict responses of plants and emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) 
from soils. Arrays of infrared (IR) heaters have been successfully applied in 
temperate and tropical agro-ecosystems to produce uniform and large increases in 
canopy surface temperature across research plots. Because this method had not 
yet been tested in the Arctic where consequences of global warming on GHG 
emission are expected to be largest, the objective of this work was to test 
hexagonal arrays of IR heaters to simulate a homogenous 3 °C warming of the 
surface, i.e. canopy and visible bare soil, of five 10.5-m2 plots in an Arctic 
meadow of northern Norway.
RESULTS: Our results show that the IR warming setup was able to simulate quite 
accurately the target + 3 °C, thereby enabling us to simulate the extension of 
the growing season. Meadow yield increased under warming but only through the 
lengthening of the growing season. Our research also suggests that, when 
investigating agricultural systems on the Arctic, it is important to start the 
warming after the vegetation is established,. Indeed, differential emergence of 
meadow plants impaired the homogeneity of the warming with patches of bare soil 
being up to 9.5 °C warmer than patches of vegetation. This created a pattern of 
soil crusting, which further induced spatial heterogeneity of the vegetation. 
However, in the Arctic these conditions are rather rare as the soil exposed by 
snow melt is often covered by a layer of senescent vegetation which shelters the 
soil from direct radiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent continuous warming can be obtained on average with IR 
systems in an Arctic meadow, but homogenous spatial distribution requires that 
the warming must start after canopy closure.

A high-throughput anti-aging drug screen was developed that simultaneously 
measures senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and proliferation. 
Applied to replicatively pre-aged fibroblasts, this screen yielded violuric acid 
(VA) and 1-naphthoquinone-2-monoxime (N2N1) as its top two hits. These lead 
compounds extended the replicative life spans of normal and progeroid human 
cells in a dose-dependent manner and also extended the chronological life spans 
of mice and C. elegans. They are further shown here to function as redox 
catalysts in oxidations of NAD(P)H. They thus slow age-related declines in 
NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H ratios. VA participates in non-enzymatic electron transfers from 
NAD(P)H to oxidized glutathione or peroxides. N2N1 transfers electrons from 
NAD(P)H to cytochrome c or CoQ10 via NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 1 (NQO1). 
Our results indicate that pharmacologic manipulation of NQO1 activity via redox 
catalysts may reveal mechanisms of senescence and aging.

BACKGROUND: Many cohort studies have reported associations between PM2.5 and the 
hazard of dying, but few have used formal causal modeling methods, estimated 
marginal effects, or directly modeled the loss of life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to directly estimate the effect of PM2.5 on the 
distribution of life span using causal modeling techniques.
METHODS: We derived nonparametric estimates of the distribution of life 
expectancy as a function of PM2.5 using data from 16,965,154 Medicare 
beneficiaries in the Northeastern and mid-Atlantic region states (129,341,959 
person-years of follow-up and 6,334,905 deaths). We fit separate inverse 
probability-weighted logistic regressions for each year of age to estimate the 
risk of dying at that age given the average PM2.5 concentration at each 
subject's residence ZIP code in the same year, and we used Monte Carlo 
simulations to estimate confidence intervals.
RESULTS: The estimated mean age at death for a population with an annual average 
PM2.5 exposure of 12 μg/m3 (the 2012 National Ambient Air Quality Standard) was 
0.89 y less (95% CI: 0.88, 0.91) than estimated for a counterfactual PM2.5 
exposure of 7.5 μg/m3. In comparison, life expectancy at 65 y of age increased 
by 0.9 y between 2004 and 2013 in the United States. We estimated that 23.5% of 
the Medicare population would die before 76 y of age if exposed to PM2.5 at 12 
μg/m3 compared with 20.1% if exposed to an annual average of 7.5 μg/m3.
CONCLUSIONS: We believe that this is the first study to directly estimate the 
effect of PM2.5 on the distribution of age at death using causal modeling 
techniques to control for confounding. We find that reducing PM2.5 
concentrations below the 2012 U.S. annual standard would substantially increase 
life expectancy in the Medicare population. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3130.

BACKGROUND: Neurodevelopmental and alcohol-induced changes in decision-making 
have been proposed to critically influence impulsive behaviour in adolescents.
OBJECTIVE: This study tested the influence of acute alcohol administration on 
impulsive choice in adolescents.
METHODS: Fifty-four males aged 18-19 years were tested in a single-blind 
placebo-controlled cross-over design. During alcohol administration (infusion 
resulting in an arterial blood alcohol concentration of 80 mg%) and placebo 
condition (saline infusion), participants performed a task battery providing 
estimates of delay discounting, probability discounting for gains, for losses 
and loss aversion, and also rated subjectively experienced alcohol effects. 
Additionally, baseline alcohol consumption (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification 
Test, blood phosphatidylethanol levels), motives (Drinking Motive Questionnaire, 
Alcohol Expectancy Questionnaire and Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale), 
family history and self-report measures of impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness 
Scale, Substance Use Risk Profile Scale) were provided.
RESULTS: No overall effects of treatment on choice behaviour were found. 
However, individual differences were observed. In the alcohol condition, more 
impulsive choice tendencies for delay discounting were associated with higher 
subjectively experienced alcohol effects. Further, higher risk aversion for 
probabilistic gains and higher loss aversion during alcohol condition were 
related to higher levels of real-life alcohol consumption and a family history 
of alcohol problems, respectively. Finally, the time to make a decision was 
substantially shortened for choices involving negative prospects.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to common beliefs, acute alcohol intoxication did not 
generally incite impulsive decision-making. It rather appears that 
alcohol-induced behavioural changes in adolescents vary considerably depending 
on prior experiences and subjective effects of alcohol.

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of newer drug-eluting stents (DES) such as 
biodegradable-polymer or polymer-free stents with shorter dual antiplatelet 
therapy (DAPT) duration is unknown. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
treatment with newer DES that may allow for shorter DAPT duration.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment 
with newer DES platforms followed by 1 or 3 months of DAPT compared with 
standard second-generation DES followed by 6 or 12 months of DAPT in patients 
with stable coronary disease. A Markov model simulated distinct health states 
over a lifetime. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and one-way sensitivity 
analyses were performed. A high-risk bleeding scenario was also evaluated.
RESULTS: Among patients with typical bleeding risk, second-generation DES and 6 
months of DAPT was less expensive and resulted in marginally higher 
quality-adjusted life years compared with other strategies. A newer DES platform 
and 3 months of DAPT was preferred when the risk of fatal bleeding was two times 
greater than baseline, or when bleeding increased long-term mortality by a 
factor of 1.5. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, second-generation DES 
and 6 months of DAPT was preferred in 58% of iterations, whereas in a high-risk 
bleeding patient scenario, a newer DES and 3 months of DAPT was preferred in 52% 
of iterations.
CONCLUSION: A DES that allows 3 months of DAPT without increasing stent-related 
events is likely to be cost-effective among patients at elevated risk of 
bleeding, but not in patients with average bleeding risk.

PURPOSE: Bladder cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. 
Data on the bladder cancer burden are valuable for policy-making. We aimed to 
estimate the burden of bladder cancer by country, age group, gender and 
sociodemographic status between 1990 and 2016.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from vital registration systems and cancer 
registries were the input to estimate the bladder cancer burden. Mortality was 
estimated in an ensemble model approach, incidence was estimated by dividing 
mortality by the mortality-to-incidence ratio and prevalence was estimated using 
the mortality-to-incidence ratio as a surrogate for survival. We modeled the 
years lived with disability using disability weights of bladder cancer sequelae. 
Years of life lost were calculated by multiplying the number of deaths by age by 
the standard life expectancy at that age. Disability adjusted life-years were 
calculated by summing the years lived with disability and the years of life 
lost. Moreover, we also estimated the burden attributable to bladder cancer risk 
factors, smoking and high fasting plasma glucose using the comparative risk 
assessment framework of the Global Burden of Disease study.
RESULTS: In 2016 there were 437,442 incident cases (95% UI 426,709-447,912) of 
bladder cancer with an age standardized incidence rate of 6.69/100,000 (95% UI 
6.52-6.85). Bladder cancer led to 186,199 deaths (95% UI 180,453-191,686) in 
2016 with an age standardized rate of 2.94/100,000 (95% UI 2.85-3.03). Bladder 
cancer was responsible for 3,315,186 disability adjusted life-years (95% UI 
3,193,248-3,425,530) in 2016 with an age standardized rate of 49.45/100,000 (95% 
UI 47.68-51.11). Of bladder cancer deaths 26.84% (95% UI 19.78-33.91) and 7.29% 
(95% UI 1.49-16.19) were due to smoking and high fasting glucose, respectively, 
in 2016.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of bladder cancer incident cases is growing 
globally, the age standardized incidence and number of deaths are decreasing, as 
mirrored by a decreasing smoking contribution.

Upsurge of Homicides and Its Impact on Life Expectancy and Life Span Inequality 
in Mexico, 2005-2015.

Research, Rostock, Germany. Hiram Beltrán-Sánchez is with the Department of 
Community Health Sciences at the Fielding School of Public Health and California 
Center for Population Research, University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA).

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the effect of the upsurge of violence on life expectancy 
and life span inequality in Mexico after 2005.
METHODS: We calculated age- and cause-specific contributions to changes in life 
expectancy and life span inequality conditional on surviving to age 15 years 
between 1995 and 2015. We analyzed homicides, medically amenable conditions, 
diabetes, ischemic heart diseases, and traffic accidents by state and sex.
RESULTS: Male life expectancy at age 15 years increased by more than twice in 
1995 to 2005 (1.17 years) than in 2005 to 2015 (0.55 years). Life span 
inequality decreased by more than half a year for males in 1995 to 2005, whereas 
in 2005 to 2015 the reduction was about 4 times smaller. Homicides for those 
aged between 15 and 49 years had the largest effect in slowing down male life 
expectancy and life span inequality. Between 2005 and 2015, three states in the 
north experienced life expectancy losses while 5 states experienced increased 
life span inequality.
CONCLUSIONS: Ten years into the upsurge of violence, Mexico has not been able to 
reduce the homicide levels to those before 2005. Life expectancy and life span 
inequality stagnated since 2005 for young men at the national level. In some 
states, males live shorter lives than in 2005, on average, and experience higher 
uncertainty in their eventual death.

Environmental Sciences and Engineering, University of North Carolina at Chapel

OBJECTIVES: To use dynamic visualizations of mortality risk functions over both 
calendar year and age as a way to estimate and visualize patterns in US life 
spans.
METHODS: We built 49 synthetic cohorts, 1 per year 1968 to 2016, using National 
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mortality and population data. Within each 
cohort, we estimated age-specific probabilities of dying from any cause 
(all-cause analysis) or from a particular cause (cause-specific analysis). We 
then used Kaplan-Meier (all-cause) or Aalen-Johansen (cause-specific) estimators 
to obtain risk functions. We illustrated risk functions using time-lapse 
animations.
RESULTS: Median age at death increased from 75 years in 1970 to 83 years in 
2015. Risk by age 100 years of cardiovascular mortality decreased (from a risk 
of 55% in 1970 to 32% in 2015), whereas risk attributable to other (i.e., 
nonrespiratory and noncardiovascular) causes increased in compensation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings were consistent with the trends published in the NCHS 
2015 mortality report, and our dynamic animations added an efficient, 
interpretable tool for visualizing US mortality trends over age and calendar 
time.

Fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) is a devastating bacterial disease in apple that 
results in severe economic losses. Epidemics are becoming more common as 
susceptible cultivars and rootstocks are being planted, and control is becoming 
more difficult as antibiotic-resistant strains develop. Resistant germplasm 
currently being utilized by breeding programs tend to have small fruit size and 
poor flavor characteristics. Malus sieversii, a progenitor species of domestic 
apple, is notable for its relatively large, palatable fruit and some accessions 
have been reported to be resistant to fire blight. In this study, nearly 200 
accessions of M. sieversii and appropriate controls were inoculated with E. 
amylovora in both Washington and West Virginia to identify fire blight resistant 
accessions. Twelve accessions were identified with resistance comparable to 
highly resistant and resistant controls. Several accessions exhibited a unique 
resistance response, not previously reported in domestic apple (M. × domestica), 
characterized by low incidence of infection but high severity once infection was 
initiated. Several of these M. sieversii accessions will be used as parents in 
future crosses in the Washington State University apple breeding program.

Small grain cereals have served as the basis for staple foods, beverages, and 
animal feed for thousands of years. Wheat, barley, oats, rye, triticale, rice, 
and others are rich in calories, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and 
minerals. These cereals supply 20% of the calories consumed by people worldwide 
and are therefore a primary source of energy for humans and play a vital role in 
global food and nutrition security. Global production of small grains increased 
linearly from 1960 to 2005, and then began to decline. Further decline in 
production is projected to continue through 2050 while global demand for these 
grains is projected to increase by 1% per annum. Currently, wheat, barley, and 
oat production exceeds consumption in developed countries, while in developing 
countries the consumption rate is higher than production. An increasing demand 
for meat and livestock products is likely to compound the demand for cereals in 
developing countries. Current production levels and trends will not be 
sufficient to fulfill the projected global demand generated by increased 
populations. For wheat, global production will need to be increased by 60% to 
fulfill the estimated demand in 2050. Until recently, global wheat production 
increased mostly in response to development of improved cultivars and farming 
practices and technologies. Production is now limited by biotic and abiotic 
constraints, including diseases, nematodes, insect pests, weeds, and climate. 
Among these constraints, plant-parasitic nematodes alone are estimated to reduce 
production of all world crops by 10%. Cereal cyst nematodes (CCNs) are among the 
most important nematode pests that limit production of small grain cereals. 
Heavily invaded young plants are stunted and their lower leaves are often 
chlorotic, forming pale green patches in the field. Mature plants are also 
stunted, have a reduced number of tillers, and the roots are shallow and have a 
"bushy-knotted" appearance. CCNs comprise a number of closely-related species 
and are found in most regions where cereals are produced.

Cost-Utility Analysis of Molar Single Implant Versus Fixed Dental Prosthesis.

Teranishi Y, Arai K, Baba S.

PURPOSE: To calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
prosthetic treatment of a single missing intermediate molar by performing 
cost-utility analysis on implants, insurance fixed dental prostheses (IFDPs), 
and private fixed dental prostheses (PFDPs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transition probability (based on the results of past 
research) and the Markov model were used for cost-utility analysis, and Monte 
Carlo simulations were performed for sensitivity analysis. The utility values 
for various types of missing teeth were collected in September 2017, and dental 
prosthetic treatment was performed in general members of the Japanese 
population, distributed by sex and age. The time trade-off (TTO) method, which 
is an index scale (0-1), was used for measuring the utility values.
RESULTS: The utility value was the highest when measured at the state in which 
implant treatment was performed and the lowest when measured in the untreated 
missing-tooth state. This model showed that compared to FDPs, implant treatment 
resulted in higher quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). However, the estimated 
cost over 30 years was lower for IFDPs. The results also showed that PFDPs were 
in a more extended, dominant state than both IFDPs and implants. The 
implant-to-IFDP ICER was €2,454.37.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that implants can be used to obtain higher 
utility values in comparison to IFDPs and PFDPs. The ICER threshold for 1 QALY 
in Japan is approximately €37,037 to €44,444, and the implant-to-IFDP ICER was 
found to be below that found in this study. Accordingly, it appears that 
implants offer superior cost-effectiveness.

Recent medical advancements have led to new modes of treatment for non-surgical 
weight loss, including several new medications. Our aim was to conduct an 
incremental cost-effectiveness analysis for all commercially available, 
evidence-based non-surgical weight loss interventions for people with excess 
weight. We identified interventions through a systematic review of randomized 
controlled trials that reported weight loss 12 months from baseline. We then 
meta-analysed the results, sourced costs and performed an incremental 
cost-effectiveness analysis from the payer perspective. Cost-effectiveness was 
presented in terms of cost per kilogram lost and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY) gained. We further performed sensitivity analyses on costs and duration 
of benefits, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Ten interventions were 
identified for inclusion: six pharmaceutical products (Alli, Xenical, Qsymia, 
Contrave, Belviq and Saxenda), two lifestyle modification programmes (Weight 
Watchers Meetings and Online), one food replacement and lifestyle programme 
(Jenny Craig) and one intragastric balloon system (Orbera). At an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $30 071 per additional QALY gained, only Weight 
Watchers Meetings was cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses revealed that for the 
medications to become incrementally cost-effective, costs would have to decrease 
by as much as 91%. Results are highly dependent on duration that benefits are 
maintained. Despite several newly available interventions, Weight Watchers 
Meetings is currently the only evidence-based, commercially available, 
cost-effective option for non-surgical weight loss. Other interventions, 
specifically medications, are more effective but priced too high to be 
cost-effective.

Strawberry production in Florida and South Carolina is affected by two major 
diseases, anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) and Botrytis fruit rot (BFR), caused by 
Colletotrichum acutatum and Botrytis cinerea, respectively. The effective 
management of both diseases traditionally relied on weekly fungicide 
applications. However, to improve timing and reduce the number of fungicide 
sprays, many growers follow the Strawberry Advisory System (StAS), a decision 
support system for forecasting fungicide applications based on environmental 
conditions and previously developed models. The objective of this study was to 
perform a meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of the StAS for AFR and 
BFR management compared with a calendar-based spray program. Thirty-nine trials 
were conducted from 2009 to 2014 in Florida and South Carolina commercial 
strawberry fields. Meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the treatment effects 
on four effect sizes, all based on the difference in response variables for StAS 
and the calendar-based treatments in each trial. The mean difference in BFR 
incidence, AFR incidence, yield, and number of marketable fruit between the two 
treatments was not significantly different from 0 (P < 0.05). However, the 
number of fungicide applications per season was reduced by a median of seven 
when using the StAS, a 50% reduction in sprays compared with the calendar-based 
approach. Effect sizes were not influenced by location or the favorability of 
the environment for disease development. These findings indicate that use of 
StAS in commercial fields is effective in controlling fruit rot diseases with no 
reduction in yield while substantially reducing fungicide applications.

Field trials were conducted from 2010 to 2013 at four locations in Illinois to 
evaluate the impact of cover crops (cereal rye [Secale cereal], brown mustard 
[Brassica juncea], winter canola [B. napus], and winter rapeseed [B. napus]) on 
soybean [Glycine max] stands and yield, diseases, pathogen populations, and soil 
microbial communities. Cover crops were established in the fall each year and 
terminated the following spring either by using an herbicide (no-till farms), by 
incorporation (organic farm), or by an herbicide followed by incorporation 
(research farm). Although shifts in soilborne pathogen populations and microbial 
community structure were not detected, cover crops were found to induce general 
soil suppressiveness in some circumstances. Cereal rye and rapeseed improved 
soybean stands in plots inoculated with Rhizoctonia solani and decreased levels 
of soybean cyst nematode in the soil. Cereal rye increased soil suppressiveness 
to R. solani and Fusarium virguliforme, as measured in greenhouse bioassays. 
Cereal rye significantly improved yield when Rhizoctonia root rot was a problem.

This study determined and evaluated the estrogenic potentials on hepatic 
vitellogenin gene (vtg1) of adult male zebrafish which were exposed to low level 
concentrations (ng/L-μg/L levels) of individual and binary mixtures of 
17β-estradiol (E2), bisphenol A (BPA) and nonylphenol (NP) through the use of 
reduced life expectancy (RLE) model and molecular docking analysis. The order of 
in vivo estrogenic potentials of individual and binary exposure of E2, BPA and 
NP was as follows: E2+BPA＞E2＞E2+NP＞BPA＞BPA + NP >>>NP. Binary mixtures of E2, 
BPA and NP had weak synergistic effects under the exposure concentration ranges. 
With the expression of hepatic vtg1 gene, the hepatic toxicity was analyzed by 
using the RLE model. All plots of the linear RLE model had negative slopes 
indicating that EC50 was negatively correlated with the natural logarithm of 
exposure time (lnET50). The RLE model analyses can be useful to evaluate the 
exposure time effects of zebrafish by using EC50 as toxicity endpoint. Molecular 
docking analysis revealed that the interaction potential of E2 (Binding 
energy: -10.1 kcal/mol) for the zebrafish ERα-LBD was the most potent (stable), 
followed by BPA (-8.0 kcal/mol) and NP (-6.8 kcal/mol). Molecular docking 
analysis can be useful to understand interactive effects of E2, BPA and NP.

Indonesia. Email: susiari_k@ugm.ac.id

Obesity is one of the risk factor of non-communicable diseases, one of them is 
cancer. It may lead to the escalation of mortality. Indonesia is the top 10 
country with the highest prevalence of cancer burden due to obesity. The chance 
of cancer caused by obesity is estimated epidemiologic descriptive and 
prevalence-based estimation with obesity attributable cancer mortality and 
Premature Mortality Cost as indicators. Obesity-related cancer mortality is 
calculated by multiplying Obesity Attributable Fractions (OAFs) rate by cancer 
death rate, which OAFs rate obtained by calculating obesity prevalence data and 
relative risk of each disease. Premature Mortality Cost was calculated by 
multiplying obesity-related cancer mortality, life expectancy, and Indonesian 
average income. The highest total mortality’s rate for obesity-related cancer 
and overweight-related cancer are colon cancer (929 deaths), ovarian cancer (599 
deaths), and pancreatic cancer (190 deaths). The highest value of Premature 
Mortality Cost are IDR 61,118 million for ovarian cancer, IDR 56,651 million for 
colon cancer, and IDR 15,472 million for pancreatic cancer. The estimation of 
cancer burden due to obesity shall be done to help the government determines the 
health programs and decrease the number of cancer burden due to obesity in 
Indonesia.

OBJECTIVE: Scoring algorithms for the EQ-5D-3L are constructed subject to a 
large degree of uncertainty (a credible interval width of 0.152, which is 
significant in comparison to the reported minimal important differences). The 
purpose of this work is to explore modeling techniques that will reduce the 
extent of this uncertainty.
METHODS: We used the US valuation study data. A Bayesian approach was used to 
calculate predicted utilities and credible intervals. A spatial Gaussian 
correlation structure was used to model correlation among health states (HS), 
thus allowing directly valued HS to contribute to the predicted utility of 
nearby unvalued HS. Leave-one-out cross-validation was used to compare model 
performances.
RESULTS: The average posterior standard deviation was 0.039 for the unvalued 
health states and 0.011 for the valued health states. Using cross-validation, 
the US D1 model had 31% coverage probability. Models with independent and 
Gaussian correlation had coverage probabilities of 95% and 93%, respectively. 
Moreover, the Gaussian correlation structure resulted in a 25.6% reduction in 
mean squared error (SE) and 13.2% reduction in mean absolute error (AE) compared 
to the independent correlation structure (mean SE of 0.00131 v. 0.00176 and mean 
AE of 0.02818 v. 0.03248).
CONCLUSION: Uncertainty was substantially lower for the directly valued HS 
compared to unvalued HS, suggesting direct valuation of as many health states as 
possible. Incorporation of a spatial correlation significantly reduced 
uncertainty. Hence, we suggest incorporating this when constructing scoring 
algorithms.

Harvest.

Four protectant fungicides applied as midseason cover sprays were quantitatively 
assessed for their ability to reduce brown rot caused by Monilinia fructicola 
during the preharvest fruit ripening periods in the 2012 through 2015 growing 
seasons. No fungicides were applied during bloom or during the preharvest 
period. Treatment programs consisted of captan, sulfur, ziram, and thiram 
applications beginning at early shuck-split stage and ending with the final 
cover spray at 23 to 26 days before harvest. The incidence of brown rot at 
harvest was determined by examining 41 to 91 fruit for symptoms of rot on each 
of four replicate trees for each treatment. The incidence of sporulating blossom 
blight cankers was assessed during the preharvest period at 8, 15, and 22 days 
after the final cover spray. An in vivo bioassay was also conducted at 7, 14, 
and 21 days after the final cover spray to ascertain the level of fungicide 
residue during the preharvest period. The bioassay uses conidia germination as a 
quantitative indicator of effective residue. Results of the harvest assessment 
showed that captan cover sprays significantly reduced brown rot incidence in all 
years of the study. Furthermore, results of the bioassay demonstrated that 
fungicide residue was the mechanism by which this control occurred. None of the 
other fungicide cover spray programs contributed significantly to brown rot 
control at harvest in any year, and bioassay results showed insufficient residue 
to inhibit conidial germination. Antisporulant activity against blossom blight 
cankers was not observed for any fungicide program, indicating that reducing 
inoculum production from this source was not a mechanism for brown rot control. 
The captan and sulfur programs provided very good control of peach scab 
incidence and severity, caused by Fusicladium carpophilum, while the ziram and 
thiram programs failed to control this disease. These findings demonstrated that 
captan cover sprays can contribute significantly to control of brown rot at 
harvest, thereby augmenting the efficacy and consistency of management by 
preharvest fungicide programs. Furthermore, any reduction of the M. fructicola 
population by the captan cover sprays should reduce selection pressure against 
the site-specific fungicides commonly used during the preharvest period, thereby 
prolonging their useful life for brown rot control.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis is the most common inflammatory neurological 
disease in young adults. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic method of quantifying various effects 
of a given condition by demographic variables and geography. In this systematic 
analysis, we quantified the global burden of multiple sclerosis and its 
relationship with country development level.
METHODS: We assessed the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis from 1990 to 2016. 
Epidemiological outcomes for multiple sclerosis were modelled with DisMod-MR 
version 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression framework widely used in GBD 
epidemiological modelling. Assessment of multiple sclerosis as the cause of 
death was based on 13 110 site-years of vital registration data analysed in the 
GBD's cause of death ensemble modelling module, which is designed to choose the 
optimum combination of mathematical models and predictive covariates based on 
out-of-sample predictive validity testing. Data on prevalence and deaths are 
summarised in the indicator, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), which was 
calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years of life lived with 
a disability. We used the Socio-demographic Index, a composite indicator of 
income per person, years of education, and fertility, to assess relations with 
development level.
FINDINGS: In 2016, there were 2 221 188 prevalent cases of multiple sclerosis 
(95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2 033 866-2 436 858) globally, which corresponded 
to a 10·4% (9·1 to 11·8) increase in the age-standardised prevalence since 1990. 
The highest age-standardised multiple sclerosis prevalence estimates per 100 000 
population were in high-income North America (164·6, 95% UI, 153·2 to 177·1), 
western Europe (127·0, 115·4 to 139·6), and Australasia (91·1, 81·5 to 101·7), 
and the lowest were in eastern sub-Saharan Africa (3·3, 2·9-3·8), central 
sub-Saharan African (2·8, 2·4 to 3·1), and Oceania (2·0, 1·71 to 2·29). There 
were 18 932 deaths due to multiple sclerosis (95% UI 16 577 to 21 033) and 
1 151 478 DALYs (968 605 to 1 345 776) due to multiple sclerosis in 2016. 
Globally, age-standardised death rates decreased significantly (change -11·5%, 
95% UI -35·4 to -4·7), whereas the change in age-standardised DALYs was not 
significant (-4·2%, -16·4 to 0·8). YLLs due to premature death were greatest in 
the sixth decade of life (22·05, 95% UI 19·08 to 25·34). Changes in 
age-standardised DALYs assessed with the Socio-demographic Index between 1990 
and 2016 were variable.
INTERPRETATION: Multiple sclerosis is not common but is a potentially severe 
cause of neurological disability throughout adult life. Prevalence has increased 
substantially in many regions since 1990. These findings will be useful for 
resource allocation and planning in health services. Many regions worldwide have 
few or no epidemiological data on multiple sclerosis, and more studies are 
needed to make more accurate estimates.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and safety of three non-tumour necrosis 
factor (TNF) α inhibitors (rituximab, abatacept, and tocilizumab) in the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
DESIGN: Population based prospective study.
SETTING: 53 university and 54 non-university clinical centres in France.
PARTICIPANTS: 3162 adults (>18 years) with rheumatoid arthritis according to 
1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria, enrolled in one of the three 
French Society of Rheumatology registries; who had no severe cardiovascular 
disease, active or severe infections, or severe immunodeficiency, with follow-up 
of at least 24 months.
INTERVENTION: Initiation of intravenous rituximab, abatacept, or tocilizumab for 
rheumatoid arthritis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was drug retention without failure at 
24 months. Failure was defined as all cause death; discontinuation of rituximab, 
abatacept, or tocilizumab; initiation of a new biologic or a combination of 
conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs; or increase in 
corticosteroid dose >10 mg/d compared with baseline at two successive visits. 
Because of non-proportional hazards, treatment effects are presented as life 
expectancy difference without failure (LEDwf), which measures the difference 
between average duration of survival without failure.
RESULTS: Average durations of survival without failure were 19.8 months for 
rituximab, 15.6 months for abatacept, and 19.1 months for tocilizumab. Average 
durations were greater with rituximab (LEDwf 4.1, 95% confidence interval 3.1 to 
5.2) and tocilizumab (3.5, 2.1 to 5.0) than with abatacept, and uncertainty 
about tocilizumab compared with rituximab was substantial (-0.7, -1.9 to 0.5). 
No evidence was found of difference between treatments for mean duration of 
survival without death, presence of cancer or serious infections, or major 
adverse cardiovascular events.
CONCLUSION: Among adults with refractory rheumatoid arthritis followed-up in 
routine practice, rituximab and tocilizumab were associated with greater 
improvements in outcomes at two years compared with abatacept.
