The current chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management aims to 
improve the patients' quality of life and healthy life expectancy; however, few 
studies have evaluated the level of satisfaction with the patients' current 
respiratory status in COPD patients and their families. This study aimed to 
examine the level of patient and family satisfaction with the patients' current 
respiratory status and to identify the clinical factors closely linked to 
dissatisfaction.This multicenter, cross-sectional study included 454 outpatients 
with COPD and 296 family members. Patients and families were allocated to the 
satisfied and dissatisfied groups based on their satisfaction with the patients' 
current respiratory status. Patients' health status, dyspnoea, appetite, 
respiratory function, and mood disorders were assessed.Among the participants of 
this study, 67% of patients and 60% of their families were dissatisfied with the 
patients' current respiratory status. The COPD assessment test (CAT) was the 
most sensitive marker of dissatisfaction compared to other clinical factors 
(p < 0.01). The statistical cut-off value of CAT for predicting patient 
dissatisfaction was 11. CAT reflected patient dissatisfaction independent of 
age, sex, dyspnoea, appetite, mood disorders, body mass index, and respiratory 
function (odds ratio: CAT; 1.12 (1.07-1.19): p < 0.01).Many patients and 
families are dissatisfied with the patients' respiratory status, and the 
patients' CAT score is useful to predict dissatisfaction. Our findings are 
consistent with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 
indicating that treatment should be enhanced in patients with a CAT score ≥10. 
Furthermore, treatment strategies targeting CAT may contribute to an improved 
patient satisfaction.

generalized anxiety disorder: an open trial on clinical outcomes and putative 
mechanisms.

Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Very little is known concerning the efficacy of psychosocial 
treatments for patients with insomnia disorder co-morbid with generalized 
anxiety disorder (GAD).
AIM: The aim was to examine the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for 
insomnia (CBT-I) for patients with insomnia disorder co-morbid with GAD.
METHOD: Given the limited, previous research on therapies for patients with 
insomnia disorder co-morbid with GAD, an open trial design was used. Twenty-four 
patients with insomnia disorder and GAD were administered CBT-I across 10 weeks. 
Across the study period to 6 months follow-up, the participants completed 
measures indexing insomnia, anxiety, worry, depression, functional impairment, 
quality of life, treatment perception (credibility, expectancy and 
satisfaction), adverse events and putative mechanisms.
RESULTS: Moderate to large effect sizes for CBT-I were observed for insomnia 
symptoms. In terms of insomnia severity, approximately 61% of the patients 
responded to CBT-I and 26-48% remitted. Moderate to large effect sizes were also 
demonstrated for GAD symptoms, depression, functional impairment and quality of 
life. Roughly one-third of the participants reported an adverse event during 
CBT-I. Five of the seven putative mechanisms were significantly reversed in the 
expected direction, i.e. all four cognitive process measures and time in bed.
CONCLUSIONS: This open trial indicates that CBT-I is an efficacious intervention 
for patients with insomnia disorder co-morbid with GAD. The results highlight 
the need for further research using a randomized controlled trial design with 
analyses of mechanisms of change.

Objectives　The purpose of this study was to identify the changes in trends of 
leading diseases that require long-term care within a 5-year period in an area 
with a rapidly growing aging population.Methods　Data were obtained from newly 
registered primary insured individuals for long-term care insurance in Sapporo 
Minami Ward. There were 2,538 participants in FY2018 and 4,089 in FY2013 and 
FY2014.　Disorders diagnosed by a primary doctor were categorized into groups 
using a long-term care questionnaire survey from the Comprehensive Survey of 
Living Conditions. The difference in the frequency of diseases between the 
survey years was examined using a chi-square test.Results　In men, there was no 
significant change in the frequency of diseases that require long-term care 
within the 5-year period. In women, the frequency of cerebrovascular diseases 
significantly reduced (7.8% for FY2013 and 2014 vs. 5.6% for FY2018; P=0.008) 
and fractures and falls significantly increased (9.5% vs. 13.8%; 
P=0.001).　Regarding the diseases in the severe-level category of long-term care 
insurance, malignancy was the most frequent disorder in men, followed by stroke. 
In women, the frequency of fractures and falls increased (10.5% vs. 17.7%; 
P=0.002) and subsequently became the most frequently occurring disorder. 
Similarly, the frequency of fractures and falls increased significantly (9.2% 
vs. 12.5%; P=0.004) in the mild-level long-term care insurance 
category.Conclusion　For women, fractures and falls increased within the 5-year 
period, indicating the need to introduce a prompt preventive program. 
Lifestyle-related diseases such as malignancy and cerebrovascular diseases have 
become the main reason for shortening a healthy lifespan. This finding 
highlights the importance of preventing lifestyle-related diseases.

Raising tobacco prices effectively reduces smoking, the main risk factor for 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Using the Health Impact Assessment 
tool "DYNAMO-HIA", this study quantified the reduction in COPD burden that would 
occur in Italy, England and Sweden over 40 years if tobacco prices were 
increased by 5%, 10% and 20% over current local prices, with larger increases 
considered in secondary analyses. A dynamic Markov-based multi-state simulation 
modelling approach estimated the effect of changes in smoking prevalence states 
and probabilities of transitioning between smoking states on future smoking 
prevalence, COPD burden and life expectancy in each country. Data inputs 
included demographics, smoking prevalences and behaviour and COPD burden from 
national data resources, large observational cohorts and datasets within 
DYNAMO-HIA. In the 20% price increase scenario, the cumulative number of COPD 
incident cases saved over 40 years was 479,059 and 479,302 in Italy and England 
(populous countries with higher smoking prevalences) and 83,694 in Sweden 
(smaller country with lower smoking prevalence). Gains in overall life 
expectancy ranged from 0.25 to 0.45 years for a 20 year-old. Increasing tobacco 
prices would reduce COPD burden and increase life expectancy through smoking 
behavior changes, with modest but important public health benefits observed in 
all three countries.

RESEARCH BACKGROUND: In the current scenario of milk production in developing 
and developed countries, several factors influence the shelf-life of raw milk 
and add significant numbers of microbial contaminants that drastically lower the 
initial microbial quality leading to milk spoilage by the time it reaches the 
processing units.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The present study was undertaken to investigate the 
biopreservative efficacy of reuterin system along with different combinations of 
bacteriocins in controlling the initial microflora of raw milk at farm level. 
Lactobacillus reuteri strain LR47, having effective antimicrobial activity, was 
shortlisted from our previous study and further characterized for reuterin 
production and tested in raw milk system.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary testing of the cell-free supernatant from 
L. reuteri LR47 demonstrated significant growth inhibition of the majority of 
the tested bacterial indicators of milk spoilage. Further genetic analysis of 
the L. reuteri LR47 revealed the presence of two genes (pduC and dhaB) involved 
in the utilization of glycerol to produce reuterin via two different pathways. 
The strain LR47 was also found to possess comparatively higher capacity to 
convert glycerol into reuterin when checked through colorimetric assay. In the 
raw milk biopreservation experiment with reuterin alone or in combination with 
bacteriocins, the highest level of growth suppression in the total bacterial 
load and coliform counts was observed in the sample that was treated with a 
combination of reuterin, nisin and pediocin. The treatment combining these three 
natural biopreservatives at specific concentrations was able to maintain the 
initial microbial quality and extend the shelf-life of raw milk by 6 h at 37 °C 
based on the microbial counts and physicochemical properties, viz. pH and 
titratable acidity. In conclusion, the results confirm that the use of reuterin 
in combination with bacteriocins is a promising approach for temporary control 
of the raw milk microflora and extension of its shelf-life until further 
processing.
NOVELTY AND SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: This study demonstrates for the first time 
the use of reuterin for the extension of shelf-life of raw milk as an 
alternative treatment method.

Cost-effectiveness of syringe service programs, medications for opioid use 
disorder, and combination programs in hepatitis C harm reduction among opioid 
injection drug users: a public payer perspective using a decision tree.

University School of Pharmacy, Richmond, VA.

BACKGROUND: The hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence rate among injection drug 
users (IDUs) in North America is 55.2%, with 1.41 million individuals estimated 
to be HCV-antibody positive. Studies have shown the effectiveness of syringe 
service programs (SSPs) alone, medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) alone, 
or SSP+MOUD combination in reducing HCV transmission among opioid IDUs. 
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of SSP alone, MOUD alone, and SSP 
+ MOUD combination in preventing HCV cases among opioid IDUs in the United 
States. METHODS: We used a decision tree analysis model based on published 
literature and publicly available data. Effectiveness was presented as the 
number of HCV cases avoided per 100 opioid IDUs. A micro-costing approach was 
undertaken and included both direct medical and nonmedical costs. 
Cost-effectiveness was assessed from a public payer perspective over a 1-year 
time horizon. It was expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
and an incremental cost savings per HCV case avoided per 100 opioid IDUs 
compared with cost savings with "no intervention." Costs were standardized to 
2019 U.S. dollars. RESULTS: The incremental cost savings per HCV case avoided 
per 100 opioid IDUs compared with no intervention were as follows: SSP + MOUD 
combination = $347,573; SSP alone = $363,821; MOUD alone = $317,428. The ICER 
for the combined strategy was $4,699 compared with the ICER for the SSP group. 
Sensitivity analysis showed that the results of the base-case cost-effectiveness 
analysis were sensitive to variations in the probabilities of injection-risk 
behavior for the SSP and SSP + MOUD combination groups, probability of no HCV 
with no intervention, and costs of MOUD and HCV antiviral medications. 
CONCLUSIONS: The SSP + MOUD combination and SSP alone strategies dominate MOUD 
alone and no intervention strategies. SSP had the largest incremental cost 
savings per HCV case avoided per 100 opioid IDUs compared with the no 
intervention strategy. Public payers adopting the SSP + MOUD combination 
harm-reduction strategy instead of SSP alone would have to pay an additional 
$4,699 to avoid an additional HCV case among opioid IDUs. Although these 
harm-reduction programs will provide benefits in a 1-year time frame, the 
largest benefit may become evident in the years ahead. DISCLOSURES: This

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients who receive high-dose aminoglycosides 
can acquire inner ear damage and subsequent hearing loss. There is no current 
standard protocol for assessing ototoxicity in CF centers in the United States. 
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist-implemented 
routine hearing screening for ototoxicity among pediatric patients using a 
clinically validated tablet audiometer to allow for earlier detection of hearing 
loss in an exploratory analysis. METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was 
developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing routine screening 
with monthly cycles over a 3-year time horizon. The model measured the 
difference in promptly detected hearing loss, delayed detected hearing loss, and 
undetected hearing loss, compared with current screening practices. Model inputs 
were obtained through a comprehensive literature review. Primary model outcomes 
included total health care costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained 
with a 3% yearly discount. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to evaluate model uncertainty. RESULTS: In a 
hypothetical cohort of 100 patients, routine screening using a tablet audiometer 
increased promptly detected hearing loss by 8 patients. There was an incremental 
gain of 3.2 QALYs at an increased cost of $333,826 compared with current 
screening practices. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of $103,771 per QALY. In the 1-way sensitivity analysis, the ICER ranged 
between $64,345 and $258,830 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Using a tablet audiometer 
for routine hearing screening appears to be a cost-effective option at a 
$150,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold when only considering the 
immediate benefits gained. This analysis did not examine the long-term effects 
of early detection in language development for pediatric patients. DISCLOSURES:

There is no uniform standard of treatment for patients with hip fusion and 
accompanying symptomatic osteoarthritis of the ipsilateral knee. Fusion takedown 
is associated with an increased risk of complications, and often the results are 
not satisfactory for patients. Therefore, each case should be considered 
individually. We present a case report regarding a 70-year-old patient with hip 
fusion as a result of tuberculosis at a young age who underwent hip fusion 
takedown with total hip arthroplasty followed by total knee arthroplasty as a 
second step. The 70-year-old patient with end-stage renal failure and hip fusion 
as a complication of tuberculosis in adolescence complained of increasing pain 
in the left knee. After taking into account his comorbidities and discussing 
with the patient possible treatment options and their limitations, he was 
qualified for 2-step surgery involving hip replacement and total knee 
replacement spaced 5 months apart. At the last follow-up visit the patient did 
not report any pain, with a hip joint mobility of 110° flexion and -10° 
extension and internal and external rotation of 35° each. The range of knee 
flexion was 110°. On a VAS scale, the patient's quality of life was rated 85/100 
vs. 30/100 preoperatively. In patients with hip fusion, satisfactory results can 
be achieved with 2-stage hip and knee replacement, even despite significant 
co-morbidities. However, this requires careful intraoperative planning and 
management of patient expectations.

IMPORTANCE: There is currently no guidance on how to approach surveillance 
mammography for older breast cancer survivors, particularly when life expectancy 
is limited.
OBJECTIVE: To develop expert consensus guidelines that facilitate tailored 
decision-making for routine surveillance mammography for breast cancer survivors 
75 years or older.
EVIDENCE: After a literature review of the risk of ipsilateral and contralateral 
breast cancer events among breast cancer survivors and the harms and benefits 
associated with mammography, a multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to 
develop consensus guidelines on surveillance mammography for breast cancer 
survivors 75 years or older. Using an iterative consensus-based approach, input 
from clinician focus groups, and critical review by the International Society 
for Geriatric Oncology, the guidelines were refined and finalized.
FINDINGS: The literature review established a low risk for ipsilateral and 
contralateral breast cancer events in most older breast cancer survivors and 
summarized the benefits and harms associated with mammography. Draft mammography 
guidelines were iteratively evaluated by the expert panel and clinician focus 
groups, emphasizing a patient's risk for in-breast cancer events, age, life 
expectancy, and personal preferences. The final consensus guidelines recommend 
discontinuation of routine mammography for all breast cancer survivors when life 
expectancy is less than 5 years, including those with a history of high-risk 
cancers; consideration to discontinue mammography when life expectancy is 5 to 
10 years; and continuation of mammography when life expectancy is more than 10 
years. Individualized, shared decision-making is encouraged to optimally tailor 
recommendations after weighing the benefits and harms associated with 
surveillance mammography and patient preferences. The panel also recommends 
ongoing clinical breast examinations and diagnostic mammography to evaluate 
clinical findings and symptoms, with reassurance for patients that these 
practices will continue.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: It is anticipated that these expert guidelines will 
enhance clinical practice by providing a framework for individualized 
discussions, facilitating shared decision-making regarding surveillance 
mammography for breast cancer survivors 75 years or older.

We have investigated the effects that iron limitation provokes in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae exponential cultures. We have demonstrated that one primary response 
is the induction of bulk autophagy mediated by TORC1. Coherently, Atg13 became 
dephosphorylated whereas Atg1 appeared phosphorylated. The signal of iron 
deprivation requires Tor2/Ypk1 activity and the inactivation of Tor1 leading to 
Atg13 dephosphorylation, thus triggering the autophagy process. Iron 
replenishment in its turn, reduces autophagy flux through the AMPK Snf1 and the 
subsequent activity of the iron-responsive transcription factor, Aft1. This 
signalling converges in Atg13 phosphorylation mediated by Tor1. Iron limitation 
promotes accumulation of trehalose and the increase in stress resistance leading 
to a quiescent state in cells. All these effects contribute to the extension of 
the chronological life, in a manner totally dependent on autophagy activation.

Accumulating evidence indicates that some pituitary cell types are organized in 
complex networks in both mammals and fish. In this study, we have further 
investigated the previously described cellular extensions formed by the medaka 
(Oryzias latipes) luteinizing hormone gonadotropes (Lh cells). Extensions, 
several cell diameters long, with varicosity-like swellings, were common both in 
vitro and in vivo. Some extensions approached other Lh cells, while others were 
in close contact with blood vessels in vivo. Gnrh further stimulated extension 
development in vitro. Two types of extensions with different characteristics 
could be distinguished, and were classified as major or minor according to size, 
origin and cytoskeleton protein dependance. The varicosity-like swellings 
appeared on the major extensions and were dependent on both microtubules and 
actin filaments. Immunofluorescence revealed that Lhβ protein was mainly located 
in these swellings and at the extremity of the extensions. We then investigated 
whether these extensions contribute to network formation and clustering, by 
following their development in primary cultures. During the first two days in 
culture, the Lh cells grew long extensions that with time physically attached to 
other cells. Successively, tight cell clusters formed as cell somas that were 
connected via extensions migrated towards each other, while shortening their 
extensions. Laser photolysis of caged Ca2+ showed that Ca2+ signals originating 
in the soma propagated from the soma along the major extensions, being 
particularly visible in each swelling. Moreover, the Ca2+ signal could be 
transferred between densely clustered cells (sharing soma-soma border), but was 
not transferred via extensions to the connected cell. In summary, Lh 
gonadotropes in medaka display a complex cellular structure of 
hormone-containing extensions that are sensitive to Gnrh, and may be used for 
clustering and possibly hormone release, but do not seem to contribute to 
communication between cells themselves.

ABSTRACT: Potato, the third most important food crop worldwide, is rich in 
nutrients but low in protein. In contrast, milk is rich in protein. Yogurt 
produced through the cofermentation of potatoes and milk is a highly nutritious 
food. The quality and shelf life of yogurt are important topics in the dairy 
industry. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of the addition 
of essential oil (EO) on the shelf life and quality of potato yogurt. The 
antimicrobial effects of several EOs, the effect of perilla leaf EO (PLEO) 
concentration on potato yogurt, and the volatile flavor components of PLEO and 
PLEO potato yogurt were evaluated. The effects of storage time and temperature 
on the pH, microbial counts, and sensory characteristics of PLEO potato yogurt 
also were analyzed to establish a shelf-life model. PLEO had an antimicrobial 
effect and was the appropriate EO for use in the potato yogurt. A total of 69 
compounds were detected in PLEO, and limonene was the main compound. PLEO had an 
effect on the pH, sensory characteristics, and viable bacterial counts of potato 
yogurt during storage. The optimal concentration of added PLEO was 0.04%. PLEO 
had considerable influence on volatile flavor components, and the consumer 
acceptance of 0.04% PLEO potato yogurt was higher than that of potato yogurt 
without PLEO in the later stage of storage. The shelf life of potato yogurt with 
PLEO was 6 days longer than that of the control yogurt. PLEO also improved the 
concentrations of active terpene substances in potato yogurt. The prediction 
models based on pH and sensory scores at 5°C were established as A = A0e0.00323t 
and A = A0e0.00355t, respectively. Comparison of the accuracy factor and the 
deviation factor of the models revealed that the sensory prediction model was 
more accurate than the pH prediction model. The results of this study provide 
theoretical and data support for the industrial development of yogurt with EOs, 
including extension and prediction of its shelf life.

INTRODUCTION: The ageing of baby boomers is expected to confront addiction care 
with new challenges. This cohort had greater exposure to psychoactive substances 
in youth than earlier cohorts. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether 
Berlin addiction care is confronted with a sustained change in its clientele 
initiated by the baby boomers.
METHODS: Using data from Berlin outpatient addiction care facilities, we 
contrasted type of primary substance use disorder and number of comorbid 
substance use disorders in baby boomers with an earlier and a later cohort. To 
isolate cohort effects, two-level random intercept regression models were 
applied in the overlapping age groups of the baby boomer cohort with each of the 
other cohorts.
RESULTS: Compared with the earlier cohort, alcohol use disorder lost importance 
whereas illicit substance use disorder gained importance in the baby boomers. 
Baby boomers presented a higher number of comorbid substance use disorders than 
the earlier cohort. Comparing baby boomers with the later cohort, these 
relationships pointed in the opposite direction.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient addiction care faces a sustained change 
to more illicit and comorbid substance use disorders. With increasing life 
expectancy and the ageing of baby boomers marked by higher substance use than 
previous cohorts, older clients, who had been under-represented in outpatient 
addiction care, will gain relevance. Hence, addiction care has to adapt its 
offers to appropriately meet the changing needs of its clientele.

AIMS: Alterations in excitability represent an early hallmark in Amyotrophic 
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Therefore, deciphering the factors that impact motor 
neuron (MN) excitability offers an opportunity to uncover further 
aetiopathogenic mechanisms, neuroprotective agents, therapeutic targets, and/or 
biomarkers in ALS. Here, we hypothesised that the lipokine lysophosphatidic acid 
(lpa) regulates MN excitability via the G-protein-coupled receptor lpa1 . Then, 
modulating lpa1 -mediated signalling might affect disease progression in the ALS 
SOD1-G93A mouse model.
METHODS: The influence of lpa-lpa1 signalling on the electrical properties, Ca2+ 
dynamic and survival of MNs was tested in vitro. Expression of lpa1 in cultured 
MNs and in the spinal cord of SOD1-G93A mice was analysed. ALS mice were 
chronically treated with a small-interfering RNA against lpa1 (siRNAlpa1 ) or 
with the lpa1 inhibitor AM095. Motor skills, MN loss, and lifespan were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: AM095 reduced MN excitability. Conversely, exogenous lpa increased MN 
excitability by modulating task1 'leak' potassium channels downstream of lpa1 . 
Lpa-lpa1 signalling evoked an excitotoxic response in MNs via voltage-sensitive 
calcium channels. Cultured SOD1-G93A MNs displayed lpa1 upregulation and 
heightened vulnerability to lpa. In transgenic mice, lpa1 was upregulated mostly 
in spinal cord MNs before cell loss. Chronic administration of either siRNAlpa1 
or AM095 reduced lpa1 expression at least in MNs, delayed MN death, improved 
motor skills, and prolonged life expectancy of ALS mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that stressed lpa-lpa1 signalling contributes 
to MN degeneration in SOD1-G93A mice. Consequently, disrupting lpa1 slows down 
disease progression. This highlights LPA1 signalling as a potential target 
and/or biomarker in ALS.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of new 
anticoagulants and warfarin in the prevention of stroke in Chinese patients with 
atrial fibrillation (AF).
METHODS: The Markov model was constructed to compare patients' quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) using drug cost, the cost of the examination after taking a 
drug, and the incremental cost of other treatments. Both dabigatran (110 and 
150 mg, twice a day) and rivaroxaban (20 mg, once a day) were compared with 
warfarin (3-6 mg, once a day). Willingness to pay, three times the 2018 China 
GDP per capita (9481.88 $), was the cost-effect threshold in our study.
RESULTS: The total cost were was 5317.31$, 29673.33$, 23615.49$, and 34324.91$ 
for warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran 110 mg bid, and dabigatran 150 mg bid, 
respectively. The QALYs for each of the four interventions were 11.07 years, 
15.46 years, 12.4 years, and 15 years, respectively. The cost-effectiveness 
analysis of the three new oral anticoagulants and warfarin showed that the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 5548.07$/QALY when rivaroxaban 
was compared with warfarin. Rivaroxaban was the most cost-effective choice and 
warfarin was the least.
CONCLUSIONS: In Chinese patients with AF, although warfarin is cheaper, 
rivaroxaban has a better cost-effectiveness advantage from an economic point of 
view.

BACKGROUND: Oral cancer is among the most common malignant tumors worldwide, and 
it has become an increasingly important public health problem in China. This 
study systematically assesses the current state of oral cancer in China from 
1990 to 2017, providing new information and perspectives for oral health 
researchers and public health policy makers.
METHODS: Based on the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2017 (GBD 2017), we evaluated the incidence rates, mortality and 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates for oral cancer in China and their 
changing trends between 1990 and 2017, making comparisons by gender and age. We 
also assessed the DALY rates associated with oral cancer at the provincial level 
for 33 provinces and their trends over time.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2017, the number of new cases and the age-standardized 
incidence rate for oral cancer in China increased by 280.0% and 79.7%, 
respectively; the number of deaths and the age-standardized mortality rose by 
196.8% and 29.0%, respectively; and the number of DALYs and the age-standardized 
DALY rate increased by 149.1% and 21.0%, respectively. The incidence rates for 
oral cancer rose after 30 years of age and peaked at 65-69 years; the mortality 
for oral cancer rose after 50 years of age and peaked at 65-69 years; and the 
DALY rates for oral cancer rose after 45 years of age and peaked at 65-69 years. 
The incidence rates, mortality and DALY rates for oral cancer in males were 
significantly higher than those in females and showed an upward trend, while 
there was a decrease or no significant change in females. The DALY rates 
increased in 21 provinces and decreased in 12 provinces, with the largest growth 
in Henan Province and the largest decline in Hong Kong Province.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of oral cancer in China continues to increase 
continuously. More prevention, control and intervention measures should be taken 
and increased attention paid to common risk factors is essential for the 
prevention of oral cancer.

The quality adjusted life year (QALY) as a basis of valuing additional 
expenditure on health is widely accepted. Although early in the COVID-19 
pandemic, several commentators called for a similar approach in resolving 
trade-offs between economic activity and reducing the burden of COVID-19, this 
has not occurred. The value of a QALY has not been used to deny all 
intervention, as the rule of rescue attests. Further, while there was no other 
way of managing the pandemic, there were other means available to mitigate the 
economic losses. Now that vaccine programs have commenced in several countries, 
it is interesting to consider whether economic evaluation should now be applied. 
However, the recognised complexities of the evaluation of vaccines, plus the 
challenge of measuring opportunity costs in the face of an economic recession 
and the severity of the consequences of an outbreak even though the probability 
of transmission is exceedingly low, mean its use will be restricted. COVID-19 
has changed everything, even the way we should think about economic evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Data on kidney cancer burden are valuable for health-related policy 
making.
OBJECTIVE: To report the results of the Global Burden of Disease 2017 study on 
global kidney cancer burden estimates grouped by gender, age, region, country or 
territory, and sociodemographic index (SDI) from 1990 to 2017.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study is based on the Global Burden of 
Disease database.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We report here detailed estimates 
and temporal trends of the burden estimates of kidney cancer from 1990 to 2017, 
stratified by gender and age, in 195 countries and territories. We further 
evaluated the relationship between these estimates and the SDI, a composite 
indicator of income per person, years of education, and fertility as a 
measurement of the socioeconomic level of a country/region. The percentage 
change and estimated annual percentage change of incidence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated to quantify temporal 
trends.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Globally, age-standardized incidence rates, 
age-standardized death rates, and DALYs of kidney cancer in males exhibited an 
increase of 0.387%/yr, 0.345%/yr, and 0.046%/yr, respectively, from 1990 to 
2017. This trend was mainly due to the increase in middle and low-middle SDI 
quintile countries. However, in females, decreasing trends of -0.324%/yr, 
-0.330%/yr, and -0.669%/yr, respectively, were observed. These trends were 
mainly due to the decrease in high, high-middle, and middle SDI quintile 
countries. Study limitations included differences in data collection practices, 
coding systems, and quality of data sources.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden estimate pattern of kidney cancer trends varies widely 
between genders and throughout the world. Low-middle and middle SDI quintile 
countries face the highest burden estimates, especially for males. Efforts to 
increase health care investment are needed in these countries.
PATIENT SUMMARY: The global burden estimate of kidney cancer trends increased in 
males; however, it decreased in females.

ABT-806 is a tumor-specific antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR). This study assessed safety, biodistribution, and 
pharmacokinetics of 111In-radiolabeled ABT-806 (ABT-806i) and effects of 
repeated doses of ABT-806 on receptor occupancy. Methods: Eligible patients had 
advanced tumors likely to express EGFR/EGFRvIII; adequate performance status and 
organ function; and measurable disease by RECIST 1.1. In cohort 1, 6 patients 
received a bolus administration of ABT-806i and underwent SPECT followed by
