INTRODUCTION: The aim of our analysis was to assess the real-world 
cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab in addition to taxane treatment versus taxane 
monotherapy for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer compared with the 
cost-effectiveness based on the efficacy results from a trial.
METHODS: A state transition model was built to estimate costs, life years (LYs) 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for both treatments. Two scenarios were 
examined: a real-world scenario and a trial-based scenario in which transition 
probabilities were primarily based on a real-world cohort study and the E2100 
trial, respectively. In both scenarios, costs and utility parameter estimates 
were extracted from the real-world cohort study. Moreover, the Dutch health care 
perspective was adopted.
RESULTS: In both the real-world and trial scenarios, bevacizumab-taxane is more 
expensive (incremental costs of €56,213 and €52,750, respectively) and more 
effective (incremental QALYs of 0.362 and 0.189, respectively) than taxane 
monotherapy. In the real-world scenario, bevacizumab-taxane compared to taxane 
monotherapy led to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €155,261 
per QALY gained. In the trial scenario, the ICER amounted to €278,711 per QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSION: According to the Dutch informal threshold, bevacizumab in addition 
to taxane treatment was not considered cost-effective for HER2-negative 
metastatic breast cancer both in a real-world and in a trial scenario.

CONTEXT: Acromegaly is a rare disease associated with chronic multisystem 
complications. National registries have been created in several countries.
DESIGN: The French Registry contains data on acromegaly epidemiology, management 
and comorbidities recorded over more than three decades, retrospectively until 
1999 and prospectively from 1999 to 2012.
RESULTS: Data could be analyzed for 999 of the 1034 patients included in the 
registry (46% males). Disease control, defined as IGF-I normalization (adjusted 
for age and sex), was achieved in 75% of patients at the last follow-up visit. 
Half the patients with uncontrolled disease had IGF-I levels below 1.5 times the 
upper limit of normal (ULN). The proportion of patients with surgically cured 
disease did not change markedly over time, whereas the proportion of patients 
with uncontrolled disease fell and the proportion of patients with medically 
controlled disease rose. Cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory and 
rheumatologic comorbidities and their outcomes were recorded for most patients, 
and no noteworthy overall deterioration was noted over time. Cancer occurred in 
10% of patients, for a standardized incidence ratio of 1.34 (95% CI: 0.94-1.87) 
in men and 1.24 (0.77-1.73) in women. Forty-one patients died during follow-up, 
for a standardized mortality ratio of 1.05 (0.70-1.42). Most deaths were due to 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with acromegaly now have successful 
disease control thanks to the multistep management. The incidence of 
comorbidities following diagnosis of acromegaly is very low. Life expectancy is 
now close to that of the general population, probably owing to better management 
of the GH/IGF-I excess and comorbidities.

Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPK) are key enzymes involved in the 
intracellular nucleotide maintenance in all living organisms, especially in 
trypanosomatids which are unable to synthesise purines de novo. Four putative 
NDPK isoforms were identified in the Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, 1909 genome but 
only two of them were characterised so far. In this work, we studied a novel 
isoform from T. cruzi called TcNDPK3. This enzyme presents an atypical 
N-terminal extension similar to the DM10 domains. In T. cruzi, DM10 sequences 
targeted other NDPK isoform (TcNDPK2) to the cytoskeleton, but TcNDPK3 was 
localised in glycosomes despite lacking a typical peroxisomal targeting signal. 
In addition, TcNDPK3 was found only in the bloodstream trypomastigotes where 
glycolytic enzymes are very abundant. However, TcNDPK3 mRNA was also detected at 
lower levels in amastigotes suggesting regulation at protein and mRNA level. 
Finally, 33 TcNDPK3 gene orthologs were identified in the available 
kinetoplastid genomes. The characterisation of new glycosomal enzymes provides 
novel targets for drug development to use in therapies of trypanosomatid 
associated diseases.

Sciences , Kerman , Iran.

INTRODUCTION: Gender inequality means unequal distribution of wealth, power, and 
benefits among women and men. The gender inequality index (GII) measures the 
lost human development in three important dimensions: reproductive health, 
political empowerment, and economic status. The first purpose of this study was 
to calculate the index for provinces of Iran, and the second purpose was to 
survey the appropriateness of that, for comparing different regions, through 
regression estimations.
METHODOLOGY: In this study, GII has been calculated for Iran between the years 
2006-2011 and provinces have been ranked based on it. Then, a panel composed of 
30 sections was estimated for five years to determine the most important factor 
affecting level of index. Some changes have been made to analyze values of the 
index and the ranking of provinces.
RESULTS: Based on panel model, share of parliamentary seats was the most 
effective factor for determination of the index. After applying adjustments, 
some differences were seen in the ranking of provinces and general level of 
index.
CONCLUSION: Weighing of dimensions of the index and considering an overall 
variable, such as life expectancy in the field of health, will give a more 
accurate comparison of the GII among different regions though concurrent 
attention to non-discriminatory cultural dimensions of political participation 
of women; therefore, making more analyses possible for a more correct comparison 
of the extensive geographical regions, such as countries.

Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Promotes Aggressiveness of Chordoma.

Gulluoglu S, Sahin M, Tuysuz EC, Yaltirik CK, Kuskucu A, Ozkan F, Sahin F, Ture 
U, Bayrak OF.

Chordomas are rare tumors of the spine and skull base that are locally 
destructive and resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with a poor 
prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Chordoma patients have a long life 
expectancy with high mortality from the disease. Cancer stem cells, which are 
known to exist in chordomas, have extensive proliferative and self-renewal 
potential and are responsible for maintaining tumor heterogeneity along with 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has 
multiple functions in stem cell biology, the immune response, and cancer, and is 
potentially a key molecule that allows cancer stem cells to self-renew. The 
purpose of this study was to determine whether LIF increases the aggressive 
traits of chordoma cells and leads to a poor prognosis in patients. Chordoma 
cell lines were treated with LIF, and functional tests were done. Twenty skull 
base chordoma samples were checked for levels of LIF and a correlation with 
clinicopathological features. The whole transcriptome microarray was used to 
observe changes in gene expression. We observed increased migration, invasion, 
tumorosphere formation, colony formation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and 
chemoresistance accompanied by a dramatic elevation in inflammatory gene 
networks and pathways in chordomas. The expression of LIF was associated with 
tumor size and a poorer overall survival. Microarray and quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction assessments suggest that LIF can facilitate 
tumor-promoting inflammation. Results indicate that LIF plays a role in 
maintaining cancer stem cells in chordomas.

BACKGROUND: Efforts to reduce the burden of illness and personal suffering 
associated with depression in older adults have focused on those with more 
severe depressive syndromes. Less attention has been paid to those with mild 
disorders/subthreshold depression, but these patients also suffer significant 
impairments in their quality of life and level of functioning. There is 
currently no clear evidence-based guidance regarding treatment for this patient 
group.
OBJECTIVES: To establish the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a 
low-intensity intervention of collaborative care for primary care older adults 
who screened positive for subthreshold depression.
DESIGN: A pragmatic, multicentred, two-arm, parallel, individually randomised 
controlled trial with a qualitative study embedded within the pilot. 
Randomisation occurred after informed consent and baseline measures were 
collected.
SETTING: Thirty-two general practitioner (GP) practices in the north of England.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 705 participants aged ≥ 75 years during the pilot phase 
and ≥ 65 years during the main trial with subthreshold depression.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants in the intervention group received a low-intensity 
intervention of collaborative care, which included behavioural activation 
delivered by a case manager for an average of six sessions over 7-8 weeks, 
alongside usual GP care. Control-arm participants received only usual GP care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was a self-reported measure 
of depression severity, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items PHQ-9 score at 
4 months post randomisation. Secondary outcome measures included the European 
Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, Short Form questionnaire-12 items, Patient Health 
Questionnaire-15 items, Generalised Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale, 
Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale two-item version, a medication questionnaire 
and objective data. Participants were followed up for 12 months.
RESULTS: In total, 705 participants were randomised (collaborative care n = 344, 
usual care n = 361), with 586 participants (83%; collaborative care 76%, usual 
care 90%) followed up at 4 months and 519 participants (74%; collaborative care 
68%, usual care 79%) followed up at 12 months. Attrition was markedly greater in 
the collaborative care arm. Model estimates at the primary end point of 4 months 
revealed a statistically significant effect in favour of collaborative care 
compared with usual care [mean difference 1.31 score points, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.95 score points; p < 0.001]. The difference equates to a 
standard effect size of 0.30, for which the trial was powered. Treatment 
differences measured by the PHQ-9 were maintained at 12 months' follow-up (mean 
difference 1.33 score points, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.10 score points; p = 0.001). 
Base-case cost-effectiveness analysis found that the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was £9633 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). On 
average, participants allocated to collaborative care displayed significantly 
higher QALYs than those allocated to the control group (annual difference in 
adjusted QALYs of 0.044, 95% bias-corrected CI 0.015 to 0.072; p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative care has been shown to be clinically effective and 
cost-effective for older adults with subthreshold depression and to reduce the 
proportion of people who go on to develop case-level depression at 12 months. 
This intervention could feasibly be delivered in the NHS at an acceptable 
cost-benefit ratio. Important future work would include investigating the 
longer-term effect of collaborative care on the CASPER population, which could 
be conducted by introducing an extension to follow-up, and investigating the 
impact of collaborative care on managing multimorbidities in people with 
subthreshold depression.

Trans-catheter aortic valve implantation: Contemporary practice and the future.

Aldalati O, MacCarthy P, Dworakowski R(1).

rdworakowski@nhs.net.

With increasing life expectancy, the epidemic of valvular heart disease, 
especially aortic stenosis (AS), is becoming more prevalent. Transcatheter 
aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an alternative therapy for 
patients with significant aortic valve disease. It offers a less invasive 
procedure in comparison to surgical aortic valve replacement (sAVR) and an 
attractive substitute from the patient's perspective. The evidence for TAVI in 
inoperable and high risk surgical patients is now established and in the 
intermediate risk group has been accumulating rapidly and is looking favourable 
for TAVI. However, the full 'TAVI story' is still unfolding. Technological 
advances in devices and delivery systems are evolving with the aim to improve 
the function and durability of TAVI and to simplify the procedure while 
enhancing safety. The incidence of vascular injury and pacemaker requirement 
post TAVI remains an issue and further development in this regard is therefore 
of utmost importance, particularly as lower risk and potentially younger 
patients are treated. Moreover, the evidence concerning long-term durability of 
the TAVI prostheses continues to accumulate. Whilst TAVI is proving to be an 
invaluable tool for inoperable and high risk patients, more trial evidence is 
needed before it encompases lower risk populations and moreover, its use as a 
first line treatment worldwide in most healthcare systems is limited by the 
costs associated with the prosthesis.

OBJECTIVES: The accurate and early diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS) is important for extending the life expectancy of patients. However, 
previous studies that have assessed the diagnostic sensitivities of the Awaji 
criteria (AC) and the revised El Escorial criteria (rEEC) in patients with ALS 
have been inconsistent, most of them were consensual regarding the advantage of 
Awaji over conventional criteria. Our study sought to compare the roles of AC 
and rEEC in the diagnosis of ALS.
METHODS: Data from a total of 294 consecutive patients with ALS were collected 
between January 2014 and August 2015 in the Peking Union Medical College 
Hospital. The clinical and electrophysiological records of 247 patients were 
eventually analyzed. The primary outcome measures were the sensitivities of the 
AC and rEEC for the diagnosis of ALS.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of probable or definite ALS as diagnosed with the AC 
(78%) was greater than that of the rEEC (36%, P <0.001). Following the 
application of the AC, 103 of the 147 patients categorized as probable 
ALS-laboratory supported from the rEEC were upgraded to probable or definite 
ALS, and 44 were downgraded to possible ALS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that the AC exhibited greater diagnostic 
sensitivity than the rEEC in a Chinese ALS population. The use of the AC should 
be considered in clinical practice.

IMPORTANCE: Disability secondary to skin conditions is substantial worldwide. 
The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 includes estimates of global morbidity 
and mortality due to skin diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To measure the burden of skin diseases worldwide.
DATA SOURCES: For nonfatal estimates, data were found by literature search using 
PubMed and Google Scholar in English and Spanish for years 1980 through 2013 and 
by accessing administrative data on hospital inpatient and outpatient episodes. 
Data for fatal estimates were based on vital registration and verbal autopsy 
data.
STUDY SELECTION: Skin disease data were extracted from more than 4000 sources 
including systematic reviews, surveys, population-based disease registries, 
hospital inpatient data, outpatient data, cohort studies, and autopsy data. Data 
metrics included incidence, prevalence, remission, duration, severity, deaths, 
and mortality risk.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted by age, time period, case 
definitions, and other study characteristics. Data points were modeled with 
Bayesian meta-regression to generate estimates of morbidity and mortality 
metrics for skin diseases. All estimates were made with 95% uncertainty 
intervals.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years lived 
with disability, and years of life lost from 15 skin conditions in 188 
countries.
RESULTS: Skin conditions contributed 1.79% to the global burden of disease 
measured in DALYs from 306 diseases and injuries in 2013. Individual skin 
diseases varied in size from 0.38% of total burden for dermatitis (atopic, 
contact, and seborrheic dermatitis), 0.29% for acne vulgaris, 0.19% for 
psoriasis, 0.19% for urticaria, 0.16% for viral skin diseases, 0.15% for fungal 
skin diseases, 0.07% for scabies, 0.06% for malignant skin melanoma, 0.05% for 
pyoderma, 0.04% for cellulitis, 0.03% for keratinocyte carcinoma, 0.03% for 
decubitus ulcer, and 0.01% for alopecia areata. All other skin and subcutaneous 
diseases composed 0.12% of total DALYs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Skin and subcutaneous diseases were the 18th leading

Severe functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) is frequent and carries a poor 
prognosis when left untreated. The strategy in symptomatic patients should be 
decided by a Heart Team who will choose between valve surgery, transcatheter 
intervention, heart transplantation or palliative medical therapy. The field of 
application of transcatheter tricuspid valve therapy will certainly focus on 
inoperable or high-risk patients first, especially those with FTR occurring late 
after left-sided valve surgery. If surgery is contraindicated because of 
multiple comorbidities interventions which are likely to be "futile" should be 
avoided. Conversely, if life expectancy is acceptable, it is attractive to 
envisage percutaneous intervention. Thus, there is a clinical need for 
transcatheter tricuspid valve therapies when surgery is not an option. 
Controlled clinical studies are necessary to show the safety profile and the 
performance of the new transcatheter procedures and define their potential role.

BACKGROUND: NICE guidelines state cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a 
front-line psychological treatment for people presenting with depression in 
primary care. Counselling for Depression (CfD), a form of Person-Centred 
Experiential therapy, is also offered within Improving Access to Psychological 
Therapies (IAPT) services for moderate depression but its effectiveness for 
severe depression has not been investigated. A full-scale randomised controlled 
trial to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of CfD is required.
METHODS: PRaCTICED is a two-arm, parallel group, non-inferiority randomised 
controlled trial comparing CfD against CBT. It is embedded within the local IAPT 
service using a stepped care service delivery model where CBT and CfD are 
routinely offered at step 3. Trial inclusion criteria comprise patients aged 
18 years or over, wishing to work on their depression, judged to require a step 
3 intervention, and meeting an ICD-10 diagnosis of moderate or severe 
depression. Patients are randomised using a centralised, web-based system to CfD 
or CBT with each treatment being delivered up to a maximum 20 sessions. Both 
interventions are manualised with treatment fidelity tested via supervision and 
random sampling of sessions using adherence/competency scales. The primary 
outcome measure is the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 collected at baseline, 6 
and 12 months. Secondary outcome measures tap depression, generic psychological 
distress, anxiety, functioning and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness is 
determined by a patient service receipt questionnaire. Exit interviews are 
conducted with patients by research assessors blind to treatment allocation. The 
trial requires 500 patients (250 per arm) to test the non-inferiority hypothesis 
of -2 PHQ-9 points at the one-sided, 2.5% significance level with 90% power, 
assuming no underlying difference and a standard deviation of 6.9. The primary 
analysis will be undertaken on all patients randomised (intent to treat) 
alongside per-protocol and complier-average causal effect analyses as 
recommended by the extension to the CONSORT statement for non-inferiority 
trials.
DISCUSSION: This large-scale trial utilises routinely collected outcome data as 
well as specific trial data to provide evidence of the comparative efficacy and 
cost-effectiveness of Counselling for Depression compared with Cognitive 
Behaviour Therapy as delivered within the UK government's Improving Access to 
Psychological Therapies initiative.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease with a range of abdominal 
manifestations including those involving the liver, pancreas, and kidneys. 
Recent advances in management of the respiratory complications of the disease 
has led to a greater life expectancy in patients with CF. Subsequently, there is 
increasing focus on the impact of abdominal disease on quality of life and 
survival. Liver cirrhosis is the most important extrapulmonary cause of death in 
CF, yet significant challenges remain in the diagnosis of CF related liver 
disease. The capacity to predict those patients at risk of developing cirrhosis 
remains a significant challenge. We review representative abdominal imaging 
findings in patients with CF selected from the records of two academic health 
centres, with a view to increasing familiarity with the abdominal manifestations 
of the disease. We review their presentation and expected imaging findings, with 
a focus on the challenges facing diagnosis of the hepatic manifestations of the 
disease. An increased familiarity with these abdominal manifestations will 
facilitate timely diagnosis and management, which is paramount to further 
improving outcomes for patients with cystic fibrosis.

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas are rare tumors accounting for 
1-2% of pancreatic exocrine neoplasms. This entity was first described by Dr. 
Frantz in 1959 and was defined by the World Health Organization in 1996 as 
"solid pseudopapillary tumor." It is most often a benign neoplasm, but 10-15% of 
the cases are malignant. Over the past decades, the incidence of this tumor is 
increasing. However, many surgeons are still unfamiliar with this neoplasm and 
its unique characteristics, which can lead to pitfalls in the diagnosis and 
treatment. The correct diagnosis of SPNP is of utmost importance since it has a 
low malignant potential and with the appropriate treatment, patients have a long 
life expectancy. There are many genetic alterations, involving various signaling 
pathways that have been associated with SPNP and are very important in 
diagnosing the tumor. The cornerstone of SPNP treatment includes surgical 
excision of the tumor, preserving as much pancreatic tissue as possible. We 
review the information in the literature regarding more organ-preserving 
techniques and possible clinical features that might indicate a malignant 
potential, thus demanding a more radical intraoperative excision.

BACKGROUND: We showed that ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt and lumboperitoneal 
(LP) shunt surgeries are beneficial for patients with idiopathic normal pressure 
hydrocephalus (iNPH) in the Study of Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus on 
Neurological Improvement (SINPHONI; a multicenter prospective cohort study) and 
in SINPHONI-2 (a multicenter randomized trial). Although therapeutic efficacy is 
important, cost-effectiveness analysis is equally valuable.
METHODS: Using both a set of assumptions and using the data from SINPHONI and 
SINPHONI-2, we estimated the total cost of treatment for iNPH, which consists of 
medical expenses (e.g., operation fees) and costs to the long-term care 
insurance system (LCIS) in Japan. Regarding the natural course of iNPH patients, 
10% or 20% of patients on each modified Rankin Scale (mRS) show aggravation 
(aggravation rate: 10% or 20%) every 3 months if the patients do not undergo 
shunt surgery, as described in a previous report. We performed 
cost-effectiveness analyses for the various scenarios, calculating the 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and the incremental cost-effective ratio 
(ICER). Then, based on the definition provided by a previous report, we assessed 
the cost-effectiveness of shunt surgery for iNPH.
RESULTS: In the first year after shunt surgery, the ICER of VP shunt varies from 
29,934 to 40,742 USD (aggravation rate 10% and 20%, respectively) and the ICER 
of LP shunt varies from 58,346 to 80,392 USD (aggravation rate 10% and 20%, 
respectively), which indicates that the shunt surgery for iNPH is a 
cost-effective treatment. In the 2nd postoperative year, the cost to the LCIS 
will continue to decrease because of the lasting improvement of the symptoms due 
to the surgery. The total cost for iNPH patients will show a positive return on 
investment in as soon as 18 months (VP) and 21 months (LP), indicating that 
shunt surgery for iNPH is a cost-effective treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Because the total cost for iNPH patients will show a positive 
return on investment within 2 years, shunt surgery for iNPH is a cost-effective 
treatment and therefore recommended. The SINPHONI-2 study was registered with 
the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials registry: 
UMIN000002730) SINPHONI was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT00221091.

Determination of the pK(a) of the N-terminal amino group of ubiquitin by NMR.

Ubiquitination regulates nearly every aspect of cellular life. It is catalysed 
by a cascade of three enzymes and results in the attachment of the C-terminal 
carboxylate of ubiquitin to a lysine side chain in the protein substrate. Chain 
extension occurs via addition of subsequent ubiquitin molecules to either one of 
the seven lysine residues of ubiquitin, or via its N-terminal α-amino group to 
build linear ubiquitin chains. The pKa of lysine side chains is around 10.5 and 
hence E3 ligases require a mechanism to deprotonate the amino group at 
physiological pH to produce an effective nucleophile. In contrast, the pKa of 
N-terminal α-amino groups of proteins can vary significantly, with reported 
values between 6.8 and 9.1, raising the possibility that linear chain synthesis 
may not require a general base. In this study we use NMR spectroscopy to 
determine the pKa for the N-terminal α-amino group of methionine1 of ubiquitin 
for the first time. We show that it is 9.14, one of the highest pKa values ever 
reported for this amino group, providing a rational for the observed need for a 
general base in the E3 ligase HOIP, which synthesizes linear ubiquitin chains.

A late presentation of Loeys-Dietz syndrome associated with an aortic root 
aneurysm.

Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is characterised by a mutation in the transforming 
growth factor beta receptor, and is strongly associated with aortic aneurysms 
and rupture. Most cases of LDS present in the second decade of life, with the 
average life expectancy being 37 years. We report a case of suspected LDS (owing 
to significant family history of the disorder) that presented in the seventh 
decade of life. Our patient had aortic root dilation and was initially believed 
to have Marfan syndrome. However, subsequent tests were negative. On further 
investigation of her family history, it was revealed that she had a strong 
positive family history of aortic rupture and aneurysms associated with 
genetically confirmed atypical LDS. By reporting this case, we aim to highlight 
the importance of considering inherited connective tissue disorders when a 
patient presents with aortic aneurysms or dissections associated with a strong 
family history of aortic pathology.

Russia.

AIM: To assess an impact of indicators of social stress on demographic processes 
in regions of the Russian Federation using statistical methods.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data of Rosstat «Regions of Russia» and «Health care 
in Russia» were used as information base. Indicators of about 80 subjects of the 
Russian Federation (without autonomous areas) for the ten-year period 
(2005-2014) have been created in the form of the database consisting of the 
following blocks: medico-demographic situation, level of economic development of 
the territory and wellbeing of the population, development of social 
infrastructure, ecological and climatic conditions, scientific researches and 
innovations. In total, there were about 70 indicators. Panel data for 80 regions 
of Russia in 10 years, which combine both indicators of spatial type 
(cross-section data), and information on temporary ranks (time-series data), 
were used. Various models of regression according to the panel data have been 
realized: the integrated model of regression (pooled model), regression model 
with the fixed effects (fixed effect model), regression model with random 
effects (random effect model).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Main demographic indicators (life expectancy, birth 
rate, mortality from the external reasons) are to a great extent connected with 
socio-economic factors. Social tension (social stress) caused by transition to 
market economy plays an important role. The integral assessment of the impact of 
the average per capita monetary income, incidence of alcoholism and alcoholic 
psychoses, criminality, sales volume of alcoholic beverages per capita and 
marriage relations on demographic indicators is presented. Results of modeling 
allow to define the priority directions in the field of development of mental 
health and psychotherapeutic services in the regions of the Russian Federation.

The free-radical theory of aging was proposed more than 50 years ago. As one of 
the most popular mechanisms explaining the aging process, it has been 
extensively studied in several model organisms. However, the results remain 
controversial. The mitochondrial version of free-radical theory of aging 
proposes that mitochondria are both the primary sources of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) and the primary targets of ROS-induced damage. One critical ROS is 
hydrogen peroxide, which is naturally degraded by catalase in peroxisomes or 
glutathione peroxidase within mitochondria. Our laboratory developed 
mice-overexpressing catalase targeted to mitochondria (mCAT), peroxisomes 
(pCAT), or the nucleus (nCAT) in order to investigate the role of hydrogen 
peroxide in different subcellular compartments in aging and age-related 
diseases. The mCAT mice have demonstrated the largest effects on life span and 
healthspan extension. This chapter will discuss the mCAT phenotype and review 
studies using mCAT to investigate the roles of mitochondrial oxidative stresses 
in various disease models, including metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis, 
cardiac aging, heart failure, skeletal muscle pathology, sensory defect, 
neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. As ROS has been increasingly recognized 
as essential signaling molecules that may be beneficial in hormesis, stress 
response and immunity, the potential pleiotropic, or adverse effects of mCAT are 
also discussed. Finally, the development of small-molecule 
mitochondrial-targeted therapeutic approaches is reviewed.
