OBJECTIVE: Cost-effectiveness analysis of a 6-month treatment of apixaban (10 
mg/12h, first 7 days; 5 mg/12h afterwards) for the treatment of the first event 
of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of recurrences, versus 
low-molecular-weight heparins/vitamin K antagonists treatment (LMWH/VKA).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A lifetime Markov model with 13 health states was used for 
describing the course of the disease. Efficacy and safety data were obtained 
from AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT clinical trials; health outcomes were measured as 
life years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The chosen 
perspective of this analysis has been the Spanish National Health System (NHS). 
Drugs, management of VTE and complications costs were obtained from several 
Spanish data sources (€, 2014). A 3% discount rate was applied to health 
outcomes and costs. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (SA) were 
performed in order to assess the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: Apixaban was the most effective therapy with 7.182 LYG and 5.865 QALY, 
versus 7.160 LYG and 5.838 QALYs with LMWH/VKA. Furthermore, apixaban had a 
lower total cost (€13,374.70 vs €13,738.30). Probabilistic SA confirmed 
dominance of apixaban (led to better health outcomes with less associated costs) 
in 89% of the simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban 5 mg/12h versus LMWH/VKA was an efficient therapeutic 
strategy for the treatment and prevention of recurrences of VTE from the NHS 
perspective.

Publisher: Objetivo: Analizar la relación coste-efectividad de 6 meses de 
tratamiento con apixaban (10 mg/12 h, 7 primeros días; 5 mg/12 h después) para 
el primer evento de tromboembolismo venoso (TEV) y prevención de recurrencias, 
frente a heparinas de bajo peso molecular/antagonistas de vitamina K (HBPM/ 
AVK). Material y métodos: Se ha empleado un modelo de Markov con 13 estados de 
salud que describen la evolución de la enfermedad a lo largo de la vida de los 
pacientes. Los datos de eficacia y seguridad se han obtenido de los ensayos 
clínicos AMPLIFY y AMPLIFY- EXT, calculándose los años de vida ganados (AVG) y 
los años de vida ajustados por calidad (AVAC) de las opciones terapéuticas 
evaluadas. En este análisis se adoptó la perspectiva del Sistema Nacional de 
Salud (SNS). El coste de la medicación, de las complicaciones y del manejo del 
TEV se obtuvo de distintas fuentes españolas (€, 2014). Se aplicó una tasa de 
descuento anual del 3% a costes y beneficios en salud. Se realizaron análisis de 
sensibilidad univariante y probabilístico (ASP) para evaluar la robustez de los 
resultados. Resultados: Apixaban generó mejores resultados en salud con 7,182 
AVG y 5,865 AVAC, frente a 7,160 AVG y 5,838 AVAC para HBPM/AVK, y con menor 
coste total (13.374,70 € versus 13.738,30 €). El ASP confirmó la dominancia de 
apixaban (produce mejores resultados con menores costes asociados) en el 89% de 
las simulaciones. Conclusiones: Apixaban 5 mg/12 h versus HBPM/AVK fue una 
estrategia eficiente para el SNS en el tratamiento y prevención de recurrencias 
de TEV.

The E3805 (CHAARTED) study found that docetaxel combined with 
androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly improved overall survival of 
patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. This study aims to 
determine whether docetaxel combined with ADT is a cost-effective strategy for 
advanced prostate cancer in China. According to the E3805 study, two groups 
(docetaxel + ADT and ADT alone) and three health states [progression-free 
survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD) and death] were analysed in a Markov 
model. All medical costs were calculated from the Chinese societal perspective. 
Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) were applied as the primary outcome. Overall, the addition of docetaxel 
was estimated to increase the cost by $12 816.93, with a gain of 0.48 QALY. 
Additionally, for patients with high-volume disease, the increased cost and 
effectiveness were $14 627.75 and 0.69 QALYs in docetaxel + ADT group versus the 
ADT alone group, and the ICER was $21 199.63 per QALY. These ICERs are far more 
than the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $20 301 per 
QALY in China. In spite of longer survival time, docetaxel combined with ADT is 
not a recommended cost-effective treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive 
prostate cancer in the Chinese setting.

Bayesian networks are probabilistic models that represent complex distributions 
in a modular way and have become very popular in many fields. There are many 
methods to build Bayesian networks from a random sample of independent and 
identically distributed observations. However, many observational studies are 
designed using some form of clustered sampling that introduces correlations 
between observations within the same cluster and ignoring this correlation 
typically inflates the rate of false positive associations. We describe a novel 
parameterization of Bayesian networks that uses random effects to model the 
correlation within sample units and can be used for structure and parameter 
learning from correlated data without inflating the Type I error rate. We 
compare different learning metrics using simulations and illustrate the method 
in two real examples: an analysis of genetic and non-genetic factors associated 
with human longevity from a family-based study, and an example of risk factors 
for complications of sickle cell anemia from a longitudinal study with repeated 
measures.

INTRODUCTION: Osteoarthritis (OA), as one of the leading causes of disability, 
decreases the quality of life for those suffering from the disease and creates a 
substantial financial burden. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid (HA) can provide 
relief from the symptoms of OA and multiple HA products are prescribed. The 
purpose of this study is to examine the single payer cost-effectiveness of 
various HA products in the treatment of knee OA.
METHODS: A single payer economic evaluation was conducted comparing Synvisc(®) 
(Sanofi, USA), Durolane(®) (Bioventus, USA), Hyalgan(®) (Fidia Pharma Inc., 
USA), Supartz™ (Bioventus, USA), and Euflexxa(®) (Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc., 
USA). Utility scores for HA products were obtained by extracting Western Ontario 
and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index pain, stiffness and function from 
randomized controlled trials and converting them to health utilities index mark 
3 scores. The cost of a treatment included the cost of the HA injection, cost of 
a knee injection procedure and cost of a doctor's visit for each required 
injection. Cost-utility in 2015 USD per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) saved 
was calculated for each HA product, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
were calculated to compare the effectiveness of HA products to one another and 
to conventional care.
RESULTS: When compared to conventional care, all investigated HA products were 
cost-effective, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained. 
The HA product Euflexxa had the most favorable cost-utility ratio 
($5785.52/QALY) when compared to all other HA brands.
CONCLUSION: The present study showed several HA products to be cost-effective in 
comparison to conventional care, with Euflexxa having the most favorable 
cost/QALY gained ratio compared to the other HA products.

Excess deaths from cardiovascular disease are a major contributor to the 
significant reduction in life expectancy experienced by people with 
schizophrenia. Important risk factors in this are smoking, alcohol misuse, 
excessive weight gain and diabetes. Weight gain also reinforces service users' 
negative views of themselves and is a factor in poor adherence with treatment. 
Monitoring of relevant physical health risk factors is frequently inadequate, as 
is provision of interventions to modify these. These guidelines review issues 
surrounding monitoring of physical health risk factors and make recommendations 
about an appropriate approach. Overweight and obesity, partly driven by 
antipsychotic drug treatment, are important factors contributing to the 
development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in people with schizophrenia. 
There have been clinical trials of many interventions for people experiencing 
weight gain when taking antipsychotic medications but there is a lack of clear 
consensus regarding which may be appropriate in usual clinical practice. These 
guidelines review these trials and make recommendations regarding appropriate 
interventions. Interventions for smoking and alcohol misuse are reviewed, but 
more briefly as these are similar to those recommended for the general 
population. The management of impaired fasting glycaemia and impaired glucose 
tolerance ('pre-diabetes'), diabetes and other cardiovascular risks, such as 
dyslipidaemia, are also reviewed with respect to other currently available 
guidelines.These guidelines were compiled following a consensus meeting of 
experts involved in various aspects of these problems. They reviewed key areas 
of evidence and their clinical implications. Wider issues relating to primary 
care/secondary care interfaces are discussed but cannot be resolved within 
guidelines such as these.

➤Advances in combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) in recent years have 
transformed HIV infection into a chronic disease when treatment is available, 
increasing a patient's life expectancy and the chances that orthopaedic surgeons 
will encounter such patients in their clinical practice.➤Musculoskeletal 
manifestations in patients with HIV infection are common and sometimes are the 
initial presentation of the disease. Knowledge about neoplasms and associated 
conditions affecting muscle, bones, and joints is essential for successful 
management.➤Since the advent of cART, total joint arthroplasty has been shown to 
be a safe procedure; however, perioperative infection is still a small risk in 
patients with uncontrolled viral loads or CD4 counts of <400 cells/mm(3).➤With 
regard to trauma surgery, the rates of early and late infection around implants, 
as well as union rates, are comparable with those in the HIV-negative 
population; however, there is an increased risk of pulmonary, renal, and 
infectious or septic complications in the polytrauma setting.➤Factors such as 
CD4 count, nutritional status, cART therapy, viral load count, and other 
comorbidities (hemophilia, infection among intravenous drug users, etc.) should 
be considered when treating these patients in order to optimize their clinical 
outcomes.

Combined Cytological and Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals a Nitric Oxide 
Signaling Pathway Involved in Cold-Inhibited Camellia sinensis Pollen Tube 
Growth.

Nitric oxide (NO) as a signaling molecule plays crucial roles in many abiotic 
stresses in plant development processes, including pollen tube growth. Here, the 
signaling networks dominated by NO during cold stress that inhibited Camellia 
sinensis pollen tube growth are investigated in vitro. Cytological analysis show 
that cold-induced NO is involved in the inhibition of pollen tube growth along 
with disruption of the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) gradient, increase in ROS content, 
acidification of cytoplasmic pH and abnormalities in organelle ultrastructure 
and cell wall component distribution in the pollen tube tip. Furthermore, 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs)-related to signaling pathway, such as NO 
synthesis, cGMP, Ca(2+), ROS, pH, actin, cell wall, and MAPK cascade signal 
pathways, are identified and quantified using transcriptomic analyses and 
qRT-PCR, which indicate a potential molecular mechanism for the above 
cytological results. Taken together, these findings suggest that a complex 
signaling network dominated by NO, including Ca(2+), ROS, pH, RACs signaling and 
the crosstalk among them, is stimulated in the C. sinensis pollen tube in 
response to cold stress, which further causes secondary and tertiary 
alterations, such as ultrastructural abnormalities in organelles and cell wall 
construction, ultimately resulting in perturbed pollen tube extension.

Exocytosis involves the fusion of intracellular secretory vesicles with the 
plasma membrane, thereby delivering integral membrane proteins to the cell 
surface and releasing material into the extracellular space. Importantly, 
exocytosis also provides a source of lipid moieties for membrane extension. The 
tethering of the secretory vesicle before docking and fusion with the plasma 
membrane is mediated by the exocyst complex, an evolutionary conserved octameric 
complex of proteins. Recent findings indicate that the exocyst complex also 
takes part in other intra-cellular processes besides secretion. These various 
functions seem to converge toward defining a direction of membrane growth in a 
range of systems from fungi to plants and from neurons to cilia. In this review 
we summarize the current knowledge of exocyst function in cell polarity, 
signaling and cell-cell communication and discuss implications for plant and 
animal health and disease.

BACKGROUND: To assess the cost-effectiveness of ceritinib vs alternatives in 
patients who discontinue treatment with crizotinib in anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase-positive (ALK+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from a Canadian public 
healthcare perspective.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states (stable, 
progressive, and death) was developed. Comparators were chosen based on reported 
utilization from a retrospective Canadian chart study; comparators were 
pemetrexed, best supportive care (BSC), and historical control (HC). HC 
comprised of all treatment alternatives reported. Progression-free survival and 
overall survival for ceritinib were estimated using data reported from 
single-arm clinical trials (ASCEND-1 [NCT01283516] and ASCEND-2 [NCT01685060]). 
Survival data for comparators were obtained from published clinical trials in a 
NSCLC population and from a Canadian retrospective chart study. Parametric 
models were used to extrapolate outcomes beyond the trial period. Drug 
acquisition, administration, resource use, and adverse event (AE) costs were 
obtained from databases. Utilities for health states and disutilities for AEs 
based on EQ-5D were derived from literature. Incremental costs per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained were estimated. Univariate and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Over 4 years, ceritinib was associated with 0.86 QALYs and total direct 
costs of $89,740 for the post-ALK population. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) was $149,117 comparing ceritinib vs BSC, $80,100 vs pemetrexed, and 
$104,436 vs HC. Additional scenarios included comparison to docetaxel with an 
ICER of $149,780 and using utility scores reported from PROFILE 1007, with a 
reported ICER ranging from $67,311 vs pemetrexed to $119,926 vs BSC. Due to 
limitations in clinical efficacy input, extensive sensitivity analyses were 
carried out whereby results remained consistent with the base-case findings.
CONCLUSION: Based on the willingness-to-pay threshold for end-of-life cancer 
drugs, ceritinib may be considered as a cost-effective option compared with 
other alternatives in patients who have progressed or are intolerant to 
crizotinib in Canada.

Preferences for improvements in attributes associated with basal insulin: a time 
trade-off and willingness-to-pay survey of a diabetic and non-diabetic 
population in Sweden.

Lund University , Lund , Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: Apart from improved health outcomes, treatment convenience per se may 
have a value to individuals. This is sometimes referred to as process utility 
and can be estimated in terms of willingness-to-pay (WTP) or quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). Previous research has produced multiple studies on QALY 
gains and WTP estimates of insulin-related attributes. There are, however, 
significant variations between studies, and it is not clear to what extent the 
value is a reflection of the true preferences or a consequence of the 
methodological approach. The aim of this study is to estimate the preferences 
for treatment attributes associated with basal insulin (administration 
frequency, administration flexibility, and treatment-induced weight gain) using 
both QALYs-elicited using time trade-off (TTO) and WTP-among a sample of the 
Swedish general population and among a sample of the Swedish diabetes 
population.
METHODS: Data was collected using web-based surveys which were distributed to 
members of internet panels. The WTP survey presented five hypothetical scenarios 
with an offer to pay the incremental cost to receive basal insulin with improved 
attributes. The TTO survey presented six hypothetical scenarios where the 
respondent could choose between living for the rest of his/her life with 
diabetes and receiving treatment with a basal insulin with certain attributes or 
live for a shorter time with full health. The scenarios were combined with 
either a basal or a basal-bolus treatment regimen. Results from the TTO analysis 
were translated into monetary estimates using a threshold value of SEK500,000 
per QALY.
RESULTS: In total, 2012 responses were included. The ratings of the attributes 
were almost identical, irrespective of method for the general population, while 
it differed to some extent for the diabetes population. The methods produced the 
same value for flexibility, but the estimates generated with the TTO approach 
were higher for one less injection and avoided weight gain. The general 
population assigned a higher utility gain to convenience attributes, while the 
diabetes population assigned a higher utility gain to avoiding weight gain.
LIMITATIONS: About a quarter of the respondents did not accept the scenario in 
the WTP survey, i.e. protesters.
CONCLUSIONS: The ranking of the attributes was generally independent of 
evaluation method, but the TTO method resulted in similar or higher values 
compared to the WTP method.

Increased incidence of upper cervical metastases and higher life expectancy 
resulted in higher operative rates in patients. The purpose of this study was to 
explore the methods and the clinical outcomes of palliative surgery for cervical 
spinal metastases.A systematic review of a 15-case series of upper cervical 
metastases treated with palliative surgery was performed. All cases underwent 
palliative surgery, including anterior tumor resection and internal fixation in 
3 cases, posterior tumor resection and internal fixation in 10 cases, and 
combined anterior and posterior tumor resection and internal fixation in 2 
cases. Patients were followed-up clinically and radiologically after the 
operation, and visual analog scale (VAS) and activities of daily living scores 
were calculated. In addition, a literature review was performed and patients 
with upper cervical spine metastases were analyzed.The mean follow-up period was 
12.5 months (range, 3-26 months) in this consecutive case series. The pain was 
substantially relieved in 93.3% (14/15) of the patients after the operation. The 
VAS and Japanese Orthopedic Association scores showed improved clinical 
outcomes, from 7.86 ± 1.72 and 11.13 ± 2.19 preoperatively to 2.13 ± 1.40 and 
14.26 ± 3.03 postoperatively, respectively. The mean survival time was 9.5 
months (range, 5-26 months). Dural tear occurred in 1 patient. Wound infections, 
instrumentation failure, and postoperative death were not observed. Among our 
cases and other cases reported in the literature, 72% of the patients were 
treated with simple anterior or posterior operation, and only 12% of the 
patients (3/25) underwent complex combined anterior and posterior 
operation.Metastatic upper cervical spine disease is not a rare occurrence. 
Balancing the perspective of patients on palliative surgery concerning the 
clinical benefits of operation versus its operative risks can assist the 
decision for surgery.

Hemophilia A is a hereditary X-linked recessive disease caused by mutations in 
the gene encoding factor VIII (FVIII), occurring in 1 out of 10,000 persons. 
Life expectancy and quality of life have dramatically improved recently in 
patients with hemophilia. Chronic kidney disease and need for renal replacement 
therapy in these patients are rare. The development of inhibitors to FVIII is 
the most serious complication of hemophilia and makes treatment of bleeds very 
challenging. We describe here a 28-year-old male patient with severe hemophilia 
A with presence of factor VIII inhibitor, who had end stage renal disease. 
Central venous access device was inserted along with infusion of factor eight 
inhibitor bypass activity before and after the procedure. He is currently on 
thrice weekly hemodialysis and doing well for 6 months without bleeding 
episodes. To our knowledge, hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitor managed with 
hemodialysis has not been reported so far.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an incurable, unpredictable but typically 
progressive neurological condition. It is the most common cause of neurological 
disability in young adults. Within 15 years of diagnosis, approximately 50 % of 
affected people are unable to walk unaided, and over time an estimated 25 % 
depend on a wheelchair. Typically, people with such limited mobility are 
excluded from clinical trials. Severely impaired people with MS spend much of 
their day sitting, often with limited ability to change position. In response, 
secondary complications can occur including: muscle wasting, pain, reduced skin 
integrity, spasms, limb stiffness, constipation, and associated psychosocial 
problems such as depression and lowered self-esteem. Effective self-management 
strategies, which can be implemented relatively easily and cheaply within 
people's homes, are needed to improve or maintain mobility and reduce sedentary 
behaviour. However this is challenging, particularly in the latter stages of 
disease. Regular supported standing using standing frames is one potential 
option.
METHODS/DESIGN: SUMS is a pragmatic multi-centre randomised controlled trial 
evaluating use of Oswestry standing frames with blinded outcome assessment and 
full economic evaluation. Participants will be randomly allocated (1:1) to 
either a home-based, self-management standing programme (with advice and 
support) along with their usual care or to usual care alone. Those in the 
intervention group will be asked to stand for a minimum of 30 min three times 
weekly over 20 weeks. Each participant will be followed-up at 20 and 36 weeks 
post baseline. The primary clinical outcome is motor function, assessed using 
the Amended Motor Club Assessment. The primary economic endpoint is 
quality-adjusted life years. The secondary outcomes include measures of 
explanatory physical impairments, key clinical outcomes, and health-related 
quality of life. An embedded qualitative component will explore participant's 
and carer's experiences of the standing programme.
DISCUSSION: This is the first large scale multi-centre trial to assess the 
clinical and cost effectiveness of a home based standing frame programme for 
people who are severely impaired by MS. If demonstrated to be effective and 
cost-effective, we will use this evidence to develop recommendations for a 
health service delivery model which could be implemented across the United 
Kingdom.

Fifteen-minute consultation: approach to management of respiratory problems in 
children with neurodisability.

Kansra S(1), Ugonna K(1).

UK.

Children with neurodisability have an increased prevalence of respiratory 
symptoms and morbidity. Several underlying physiological impairments and 
coexistent problems, like aspiration, make these children vulnerable to 
respiratory difficulties. The management of these respiratory problems is aimed 
at improving the quality of life, reducing the risk of exacerbations and further 
lung damage. This is based on identifying and, where possible, modifying 
physiological impairments, managing any exacerbating factors and proactive 
treatment of any complications. Even though increased life expectancy is now 
possible, an ever-increasing dependence on technology can interfere with quality 
of life and decisions to escalate to these treatments should be individualised.

Biofertilizers can help improve soil quality, promote crop growth, and sustain 
soil health. The photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris strain PS3 
(hereafter, PS3), which was isolated from Taiwanese paddy soil, can not only 
exert beneficial effects on plant growth but also enhance the efficiency of 
nutrient uptake from applied fertilizer. To produce this elite microbial isolate 
for practical use, product development and formulation are needed to permit the 
maintenance of the high quality of the inoculant during storage. The aim of this 
study was to select a suitable formulation that improves the survival and 
maintains the beneficial effects of the PS3 inoculant. Six additives (alginate, 
polyethylene glycol [PEG], polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 [PVP], glycerol, glucose, and 
horticultural oil) were used in liquid-based formulations, and their capacities 
for maintaining PS3 cell viability during storage in low, medium, and high 
temperature ranges were evaluated. Horticultural oil (0.5 %) was chosen as a 
potential additive because it could maintain a relatively high population and 
conferred greater microbial vitality under various storage conditions. 
Furthermore, the growth-promoting effects exerted on Chinese cabbage by the 
formulated inoculants were significantly greater than those of the unformulated 
treatments. The fresh and dry weights of the shoots were significantly 
increased, by 10-27 and 22-40 %, respectively. Horticultural oil is considered a 
safe, low-cost, and easy-to-process material, and this formulation would 
facilitate the practical use of strain PS3 in agriculture.

Older Cancer Patient.

: Inappropriate medication use and polypharmacy are extremely common among older 
adults. Numerous studies have discussed the importance of a comprehensive 
medication assessment in the general geriatric population. However, only a 
handful of studies have evaluated inappropriate medication use in the geriatric 
oncology patient. Almost a dozen medication screening tools exist for the older 
adult. Each available tool has the potential to improve aspects of the care of 
older cancer patients, but no single tool has been developed for this 
population. We extensively reviewed the literature (MEDLINE, PubMed) to evaluate 
and summarize the most relevant medication screening tools for older patients 
with cancer. Findings of this review support the use of several screening tools 
concurrently for the elderly patient with cancer. A deprescribing tool should be 
developed and included in a comprehensive geriatric oncology assessment. 
Finally, prospective studies are needed to evaluate such a tool to determine its 
feasibility and impact in older patients with cancer.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The prevalence of polypharmacy increases with 
advancing age. Older adults are more susceptible to adverse effects of 
medications. "Prescribing cascades" are common, whereas "deprescribing" remains 
uncommon; thus, older patients tend to accumulate medications over time. Older 
patients with cancer are at high risk for adverse drug events, in part because 
of the complexity and intensity of cancer treatment. Additionally, a cancer 
diagnosis often alters assessments of life expectancy, clinical status, and 
competing risk. Screening for polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate 
medications could reduce the risk for adverse drug events, enhance quality of 
life, and reduce health care spending for older cancer patients.

Oral cavity cancer remains one of the most common cancers worldwide, with an 
increased incidence in young adults, although there has been lately a decrease 
tendency in the incidence of this form of cancer. Lingual localization has a 
very high mortality and tends to be more aggressive becoming frequently 
metastatic at the regional lymph nodes. The purpose of this study is to 
investigate the immunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin 18 (CK18) and the 
reactivity to GDF5 (CDMP-1), called the morphogenetic protein-1, 
cartilage-derived, in lingual squamous cell carcinoma and the correlation 
between the immunoreactivity of this panel of antibodies, and the clinical 
stage, the degree of differentiation and the invasion pattern. In this regard, 
we studied the immunohistochemical behavior of these markers in 15 cases of 
lingual squamous cell carcinoma. In our study, we observed the correlation of 
CK18 and GDF5 expression with the clinical stage, differentiation degree and 
invasion pattern, the highest levels of immunoreactivity being recorded in 
poorly differentiated forms, in high-level invasion patterns and in the most 
advanced stages. The markers used can become therapeutic targets, which could 
help increase the quality of life and life expectancy for these patients.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women, being also the 
leading cause of cancer death among female population, including in Romania. 
Resistance to therapy represents a major problem for cancer treatment. Current 
cancer treatments are both expensive and induce serious side effects; therefore 
ineffective therapies are both traumatic and pricy. Characterizing predictive 
markers that can identify high-risk patients could contribute to 
dedicated/personalized therapy to improve the life quality and expectancy of 
cancer patients. Moreover, there are some markers that govern specific tumor 
molecular features that can be targeted with specific therapies for those 
patients who are most likely to benefit. The identification of stem cells in 
both normal and malignant breast tissue have lead to the hypothesis that breast 
tumors arise from breast cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), and that these cells 
influence tumor's response to therapy. CSCs have similar self-renewal properties 
to normal stem cells, however the balance between the signaling pathways is 
altered towards tumor formation In this review, we discuss the molecular aspects 
of breast CSCs and the controversies regarding their use in the diagnosis and 
treatment decision of breast cancer patients.

Neurological conditions are among the leading causes of disability in the 
Canadian population and are associated with a large public health burden. An 
increase in life expectancy and a declining birth rate has resulted in an aging 
Canadian population, and the proportion of age-adjusted mortality due to 
non-communicable diseases has been steadily increasing. These conditions are 
frequently associated with chronic disability and an increasing burden of care 
for patients, their families and caregivers. The National Population Health 
Study of Neurological Conditions (NPHSNC) aims to improve knowledge about 
neurological conditions and their impacts on individuals, their families, 
caregivers and health care system. The Systematic Review of Determinants of 
Neurological Conditions, a specific objective within the NPHSNC, is a compendium 
of systematic reviews on risk factors affecting onset and progression of the 
following 14 priority neurological conditions: Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brain tumours (BT), cerebral palsy (CP), 
dystonia, epilepsy, Huntington's disease (HD), hydrocephalus, multiple sclerosis 
(MS), muscular dystrophies (MD), neurotrauma, Parkinson's disease (PD), spina 
bifida (SB), and Tourette's syndrome (TS). The burden of neurological disease is 
expected to increase as the population ages, and this trend is presented in 
greater detail for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease because the incidence of 
these two common neurological diseases increases significantly with age over 65 
years. This article provides an overview of burden of neurological diseases in 
Canada to set the stage for the in-depth systematic reviews of the 14 priority 
neurological conditions presented in subsequent articles in this issue.

BACKGROUND: Ivabradine is a heart rate-lowering agent approved to reduce the 
risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure. This study assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of adding ivabradine to background therapy in the United 
States from the perspective of a commercial or Medicare Advantage payer.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A cost-effectiveness, cohort-based Markov model using a 
state transition approach tracked a cohort of heart failure patients with heart 
rate ≥70 beats per minute in sinus rhythm who were treated with 
ivabradine+background therapy or background therapy alone. Model inputs, 
including adjusted hazard ratios, rates of hospitalization and mortality, 
adverse events, and utility-regression equations, were derived from a large US 
claims database and SHIFT (Systolic Heart failure treatment with the If 
inhibitor ivabradine Trial). In the commercial population, ivabradine+background 
therapy was associated with a cost savings of $8594 versus the cost of 
background therapy alone over a 10-year time horizon, primarily because of 
reduced hospitalization. Ivabradine was associated with an incremental benefit 
of 0.24 quality-adjusted life years over a 10-year time horizon. In the Medicare 
Advantage population, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ivabradine 
was estimated to be $24 920/quality-adjusted life years.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness model suggests that for a commercial 
population, the addition of ivabradine to background therapy was associated with 
cost savings and improved clinical outcomes. For a Medicare Advantage 
population, the analysis indicates that the clinical benefit of ivabradine can 
be achieved at a reasonable cost.
