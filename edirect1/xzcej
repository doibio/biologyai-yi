provides an overview of the role and the development of CSPBMs, and presents a 
description of existing CSPBMs in the literature. The article also provides an 
overview of the psychometric properties of CSPBMs in comparison with generic 
preference-based measures (generic PBMs), and considers the advantages and 
disadvantages of CSPBMs in comparison with generic PBMs. CSPBMs typically 
include dimensions that are important for that condition but may not be 
important across all patient groups. There are a large number of CSPBMs across a 
wide range of conditions, and these vary from covering a wide range of 
dimensions to more symptomatic or uni-dimensional measures. Psychometric 
evidence is limited but suggests that CSPBMs offer an advantage in more accurate 
measurement of milder health states. The mean change and standard deviation can 
differ for CSPBMs and generic PBMs, and this may impact on incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios. CSPBMs have a useful role in HTA where a generic PBM 
is not appropriate, sensitive or responsive. However, due to issues of 
comparability across different patient groups and interventions, their usage in 
health technology assessment is often limited to conditions where it is 
inappropriate to use a generic PBM or sensitivity analyses.

BACKGROUND: Inappropriate prescribing is a well-known clinical problem in 
nursing home residents, but few interventions have focused on reducing 
inappropriate medication use.
OBJECTIVE: To examine successful discontinuation of inappropriate medication use 
and to improve prescribing in nursing home residents.
DESIGN: Pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial, with clustering by elder 
care physicians and their wards. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01876095).
SETTING: 59 Dutch nursing home wards for long-term care.
PATIENTS: Residents with a life expectancy greater than 4 weeks who consented to 
treatment with medication.
INTERVENTION: Multidisciplinary Multistep Medication Review (3MR) consisting of 
an assessment of the patient perspective, medical history, critical appraisal of 
medications, a meeting between the treating elder care physician and the 
pharmacist, and implementation of medication changes.
MEASUREMENTS: Successful discontinuation of use of at least 1 inappropriate drug 
(that is, without relapse or severe withdrawal symptoms) and clinical outcomes 
(neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive function, and quality of life) after 4 
months of follow-up.
RESULTS: Nineteen elder care physicians (33 wards) performed the 3MR, and 16 
elder care physicians (26 wards) followed standard procedures. A total of 426 
nursing home residents (233 in the intervention group and 193 in the control 
group) were followed for an average of 144 days (SD, 21). In an analysis of all 
participants, use of at least 1 inappropriate medication was successfully 
discontinued for 91 (39.1%) residents in the intervention group versus 57 
(29.5%) in the control group (adjusted relative risk, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.02 to 
1.75]). Clinical outcomes did not deteriorate between baseline and follow-up.
LIMITATIONS: The 3MR was done only once. Some withdrawal symptoms or relapses 
may have been missed.
CONCLUSION: The 3MR is effective in discontinuing inappropriate medication use 
in frail nursing home residents without a decline in their well-being.

With ageing, bone tissue undergoes significant compositional, architectural and 
metabolic alterations potentially leading to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is the 
most prevalent bone disorder, which is characterised by progressive bone 
weakening and an increased risk of fragility fractures. Although this metabolic 
disease is conventionally associated with ageing and menopause, the predisposing 
factors are thought to be established during childhood and adolescence. In light 
of this, exercise interventions implemented during maturation are likely to be 
highly beneficial as part of a long-term strategy to maximise peak bone mass and 
hence delay the onset of age- or menopause-related osteoporosis. This notion is 
supported by data on exercise interventions implemented during childhood and 
adolescence, which confirmed that weight-bearing activity, particularly if 
undertaken during peripubertal development, is capable of generating a 
significant osteogenic response leading to bone anabolism. Recent work on human 
ageing and epigenetics suggests that undertaking exercise after the fourth 
decade of life is still important, given the anti-ageing effect and health 
benefits provided, potentially occurring via a delay in telomere shortening and 
modification of DNA methylation patterns associated with ageing. Exercise is 
among the primary modifiable factors capable of influencing bone health by 
preserving bone mass and strength, preventing the death of bone cells and 
anti-ageing action provided.

Previous research has suggested that fear of harm to the patient-physician 
relationship is an important barrier to conversations about cost of care. 
However, few experimental studies have investigated the effects of cost of care 
conversations on the patient-physician relationship, particularly from the 
patient's perspective. In the current research, we take an experimental approach 
to investigate patients' attitudes and preferences for a hypothetical physician 
who discusses cost versus one who does not. Across three studies, using data 
from both the general population and cancer patients, we find that people prefer 
a hypothetical physician who discusses cost over one who does not (Pilot Study, 
Studies 1 and 2). In addition, we find that people use cost information to 
inform their hypothetical treatment decisions without changing their attitudes 
toward the physician who includes this information (Study 1). Finally, we 
examine how and when cost information compares to more traditional medical 
information (e.g., side effects; Study 2). We discuss the implications of this 
research for cost communications and the patient-physician relationship, 
highlighting that cost conversations may not be as harmful as previously 
thought.

Historical coral growth assessed by sclerochronology records provides an 
environmental retrospective and future perspective on the maintenance of 
coral-reef ecosystems. Three growth parameters, extension rate, skeletal 
density, and calcification rate were evaluated over the past two decade's 
interval (1988-2013) in different gender of two massive corals Pavona gigantea 
and Porites panamensis. The species P. gigantea calcified two-times faster 
(0.84 ± 0.29 g cm-2 yr-1) than P. panamensis (0.36 ± 0.15 g cm-2 yr-1); and male 
colonies presents13-58% higher calcification rates than females. Annual growth 
parameters do not show significant trends over the period 1988-2013, but 
significant, growth disruption associated with ENSO events. The data presented 
here suggest that P.gigantea and P.panamensis from the area have developed 
phenotypic plasticity to a wide range of environmental condition; the life 
history of both species is reflected in their calcification rates during both 
optimal and non-optimal conditions over the last two decades. Massive species 
develop denser structures that provide a permanent habitat to many marine 
species and contributes to the long-term maintenance of coral reef communities 
in the eastern tropical Pacific.

Prostate cancer is a disease of the elderly men. Prostate cancer in the elderly 
men is often poorly managed and under-treated. The digital rectal examination is 
an effective screening test for elderly prostate cancer patients. In order to 
choose the appropriated therapeutic option, evaluation of life-expectancy is 
essential to offer an optimal individualized treatment. It is essential to take 
into account the patients' aspirations before starting any diagnostic and 
therapeutic approach. Therapeutic options should be adapted in elderly prostate 
cancer patients according to their comorbidities and needs. Elderly patients 
should be included in clinical trials specifically designed for this population.

Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is known to be involved in antiviral 
response as well as regulation of functional and developmental processes in 
lymphomyeloid cell lineages in mammals. In this study, the gene of IRF4a and its 
two transcript variants (named IRF4a1 and -2) were cloned from turbot, 
Scophthalmus maximus, the tissue distributions and in vivo immune responsive 
expression patterns of the two transcripts were subsequently examined. The 
Scophthalmus maximus (Sm)IRF4a gene is 8367 nucleotide (nt) in length, 
consisting of eight exons and seven introns. The SmIRF4a1 transcript is 3185 nt 
long, containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 1401 nt that encodes a 
polypeptide of 466 amino acids (aa). The SmIRF4a2 transcript is 2265 nt long and 
identical with the SmIRF4a1 from position 1 to 1171, containing an ORF of 
1164 nt that encodes a truncated protein of 387 aa as a result of a frame shift 
in exon 6 which introduces a premature stop codon. The deduced aa sequence of 
SmIRF4a1 posses a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a nuclear localization signal (NLS), 
a serine-rich domain (SRD) and an IRF association domain (IAD), while SmIRF4a2 
lacks the C-terminal 52 residues of the IAD and the downstream C-terminal 
extension, instead, they are replaced by a 8-aa segment although the three 
upstream domains are intact. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed a 
broad tissue expression for both SmIRF4a1 and -2 with the former showing a 
significantly higher expression in all examined tissues except skin. Expressions 
of two transcript variants after stimulation with polyinosinic:polycytidylic 
acid [poly(I:C)] and turbot reddish body iridovirus (TRBIV) were tested in 
gills, spleen, head kidney and muscle. A two-wave of induced expression pattern 
was observed for both transcripts with either stimulus treatment during a 7-day 
time course. SmIRF4a2 responded more promptly to the stimuli and showed a higher 
level of inducibility in the early phase while SmIRF4a1 was strongly detected in 
the later phase. These data suggest an important role of SmIRF4a2 in the fast 
immune response under a background of SmIRF4a1-dominant antiviral response in 
the IRF4a system of turbot.

Stockton-on-Tees has the highest geographical inequalities in health in England 
with the life expectancy at birth gap between the most and deprived 
neighbourhoods standing at over 17 years for men and 11 years for women. In this 
study, we provide the first detailed empirical examination of this geographical 
health divide by: estimating the gap in physical and general health (as measured 
by EQ. 5D, EQ. 5D-VAS and SF8PCS) between the most and least deprived areas; 
using a novel statistical technique to examining the causal role of 
compositional and contextual factors and their interaction; and doing so in a 
time of economic recession and austerity. Using a stratified random sampling 
technique, individual-level survey data was combined with secondary data sources 
and analysed using multi-level models with 95% confidence intervals obtained 
from nonparametric bootstrapping. The main findings indicate that there is a 
significant gap in health between the two areas, and that compositional level 
material factors, contextual factors and their interaction appear to be the 
major explanations of this gap. Contrary to the dominant policy discourse in 
this area, individual behavioural and psychosocial factors did not make a 
significant contribution towards explaining health inequalities in the study 
area. The findings are discussed in relation to geographical theories of health 
inequalities and the context of austerity.

Stress and cancer are two complex situations involving different biological and 
psychological mechanisms. Their relationship have long been studied, and there 
is evidence of the impact stress has on both, development and disease 
progression. Furthermore, early stress has been studied as an important factor 
associated to this relationship, since its impacts on the immune, endocrine and 
cognitive development throughout life is already known. Therefore, understanding 
early stress as a first wave of stress in life is necessary in order to explore 
a possible second wave hit model. From this perspective, we believe that breast 
cancer can be understood as a second wave of stress during development and that, 
in addition to the first wave, can cause important impacts on the response to 
cancer treatment, such as increased chances of disease progression and distinct 
behavioral responses. In this article we propose a second wave hit hypothesis 
applied to breast cancer and its implications on the immune, endocrine and 
cognitive systems, through mechanisms that involve the HPA axis and subsequent 
activations of stress responses.

OBJECTIVE: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disease 
affecting the Caucasian population, with a birth incidence ranging between 
1:2,500 and 1:1,800. It is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane regulator 
gene which is localized on 7 chromosomes. Renal disease is reported as a 
relatively rare complication in adult patient with CF. We evaluated proteinuria 
and chronic renal failure (CRF) in a population of patients with CF.
METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in a referral center for CF at 
University of Messina in Italy. We identified all patients with renal disease, 
characterized by proteinuria and/or CRF, during the period 2007 to 2012 and 
reviewed their medical records to assess influence on renal disease of genotype, 
number of pulmonary exacerbation, pancreatic insufficiency, pulmonary function, 
CF-related diabetes, and antibiotics courses.
RESULTS: From a population of 77 adult patients with CF, we identified 9 
patients with proteinuria (11.7%), and 11 patients (14.28%) with CRF. Mean age 
was 35.6 (+5.1 standard deviation) years, 55% were female and 33% had diabetes 
mellitus. Renal biopsy was performed in 3 patients because of nephrotic syndrome 
in 1 patient and proteinuria with renal failure in the other 2 patients. Renal 
amyloidosis was disclosed in 2, whereas IgA nephropathy in 1 patient. The ΔF508 
mutation in homozygosis was present in 44% of patients with proteinuria (vs. 27% 
of our CF population, relative risk 2.07), whereas genotype ΔF508/N1303K in 22%. 
ΔF508 allele mutation was present in 77.7% of proteinuric patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a higher prevalence of renal disease in patients 
with CF, than was previously described. The main reason may be related to 
increased life expectancy because of better management. Moreover, patients with 
ΔF508 homozygosis had higher risk of proteinuria.

Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) is a well-known 
tumor suppressor that acts as a dual-specificity phosphatase and is frequently 
mutated in human cancer. Our previous work has demonstrated that PTEN also plays 
a vital role in type I interferon responses and antiviral innate immunity. 
Recently, a translational variant of PTEN with a long N-terminal extension 
(PTEN-L) has been discovered that is secreted into the extracellular environment 
and enters recipient cells, where it exerts a phosphatase function antagonistic 
to PI3K/Akt signaling and tumorigenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that 
PTEN-L promotes type I interferon responses and antiviral innate immunity during 
viral infection in a phosphatase activity-dependent manner. Compared with 
canonical PTEN, PTEN-L also exerts its antiviral function when it is applied 
exogenously in protein form. This finding was confirmed in cell cultures and 
mouse infection models. Furthermore, PTEN-L enhances the responses of both type 
I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines, thus suggesting that PTEN-L might 
possess additional functions compared with those of PTEN. Thus, the antiviral 
function of PTEN-L may open an avenue for the use of PTEN-L in antiviral 
therapy, particularly in patients with PTEN-deficient tumors.

Vaccine is the one of the greatest inventions of modern medicine that has 
contributed most to the relief of human misery and the exciting increase in life 
expectancy. In 1796, an English country physician, Edward Jenner, discovered 
that inoculating mankind with cowpox can protect them from smallpox (Riedel S, 
Edward Jenner and the history of smallpox and vaccination. Proceedings (Baylor 
University. Medical Center) 18(1):21, 2005). Based on the vaccination worldwide, 
we finally succeeded in the eradication of smallpox in 1977 (Henderson, Vaccine 
29:D7-D9, 2011). Other disabling and lethal diseases, like poliomyelitis and 
measles, are targeted for eradication (Bonanni, Vaccine 17:S120-S125, 
1999).Although vaccine development and administration are tremendously 
successful and cost-effective practices to human health, no vaccine is 100% safe 
for everyone because each person reacts to vaccinations differently given 
different genetic background and health conditions. Although all licensed 
vaccines are generally safe for the majority of people, vaccinees may still 
suffer adverse events (AEs) in reaction to various vaccines, some of which can 
be serious or even fatal (Haber et al., Drug Saf 32(4):309-323, 2009). Hence, 
the double-edged sword of vaccination remains a concern.To support integrative 
AE data collection and analysis, it is critical to adopt an AE normalization 
strategy. In the past decades, different controlled terminologies, including the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (Brown EG, Wood L, Wood S, 
et al., Drug Saf 20(2):109-117, 1999), the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) (NCI, The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE). Available from: http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html . Access 
on 7 Oct 2015), and the World Health Organization (WHO) Adverse Reactions 
Terminology (WHO-ART) (WHO, The WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology - WHO-ART. 
Available from: https://www.umc-products.com/graphics/28010.pdf ), have been 
developed with a specific aim to standardize AE categorization. However, these 
controlled terminologies have many drawbacks, such as lack of textual 
definitions, poorly defined hierarchies, and lack of semantic axioms that 
provide logical relations among terms. A biomedical ontology is a set of 
consensus-based and computer and human interpretable terms and relations that 
represent entities in a specific biomedical domain and how they relate each 
other. To represent and analyze vaccine adverse events (VAEs), our research 
group has initiated and led the development of a community-based ontology: the 
Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE) (He et al., J Biomed Semant 5:29, 2014). The 
OAE has been found to have advantages to overcome the drawbacks of those 
controlled terminologies (He et al., Curr Pharmacol Rep :1-16. 
doi:10.1007/s40495-016-0055-0, 2014). By expanding the OAE and the 
community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) (He et al., VO: vaccine ontology. In The 
1st International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO-2009). Nature 
Precedings, Buffalo. http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3552/version/1 ; J 
Biomed Semant 2(Suppl 2):S8; J Biomed Semant 3(1):17, 2009; Ozgur et al., J 
Biomed Semant 2(2):S8, 2011; Lin Y, He Y, J Biomed Semant 3(1):17, 2012), we 
have also developed the Ontology of Vaccine Adverse Events (OVAE) to represent 
known VAEs associated with licensed vaccines (Marcos E, Zhao B, He Y, J Biomed 
Semant 4:40, 2013).In this book chapter, we will first introduce the basic 
information of VAEs, VAE safety surveillance systems, and how to specifically 
query and analyze VAEs using the US VAE database VAERS (Chen et al., Vaccine 
12(10):960-960, 1994). In the second half of the chapter, we will introduce the 
development and applications of the OAE and OVAE. Throughout this chapter, we 
will use the influenza vaccine Flublok as the vaccine example to launch the 
corresponding elaboration (Huber VC, McCullers JA, Curr Opin Mol Ther 
10(1):75-85, 2008). Flublok is a recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine 
indicated for active immunization against disease caused by influenza virus 
subtypes A and type B. On January 16, 2013, Flublok was approved by the FDA for 
the prevention of seasonal influenza in people 18 years and older in the USA. 
Now, more than 3 years later, an exploration of the reported AEs associated with 
this vaccine is urgently needed.

The Evolution of Human Life Expectancy and Intelligence in Hunter-Gatherer 
Economies.

The economics of hunting and gathering must have driven the biological evolution 
of human characteristics, since hunter-gatherer societies prevailed for the two 
million years of human history. These societies feature huge intergenerational 
resource flows, suggesting that these resource flows should replace fertility as 
the key demographic consideration. It is then theoretically expected that life 
expectancy and brain size would increase simultaneously, as apparently occurred 
during our evolutionary history. The brain here is considered as a direct form 
of bodily investment, but also crucially as facilitating further indirect 
investment by means of learning-by-doing.

BACKGROUND: While early involvement and integration of palliative care with 
oncology can positively impact quality of life and survival of patients with 
advanced cancer, there is a dearth of information regarding this integration in 
sub-Saharan Africa.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the rate and factors predicting specialist 
palliative referrals among cancer patients in Uganda.
DESIGN: We examined the rate of referrals of cancer patients to palliative 
specialists via a chart review, while also surveying and interviewing doctors at 
the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI) about their approaches to palliative care.
SETTING: All adult patients at the UCI who died in a 20-month interval from 2014 
to 2015. All UCI doctors were approached for the survey and 25 (96%) 
participated. Seven of these doctors were also individually interviewed.
MEASUREMENTS: Number of referrals to palliative specialists and qualitative 
responses to questions about end-of-life care management.
RESULTS: Sixty-six (11.1%) of 595 patients were referred to palliative care 
specialists. Patients with worse ECOG performance statuses were more likely to 
be referred to palliative specialists (odds ratio 2.23, p = 0.03); no other 
factors were predictive of a referral. Median number of days lived after 
referral was 5 days (interquartile range 2-13). Doctors explained the low 
referral rate and short life expectancy after referral by limited palliative 
resources and a reticence to have end-of-life management conversations with 
patients due to cultural taboos.
CONCLUSION: Despite recognized benefits of palliative collaboration, doctors at 
the UCI seldom refer patients to palliative care specialists due to limited 
staffing, cultural barriers, and difficult interservice communication.

BACKGROUND: Early-stage breast cancer is among the most prevalent and costly 
malignancies treated in the American health care system. Adjuvant radiotherapy 
after lumpectomy represents a substantial portion of breast cancer expenditures. 
The relative value of novel radiotherapeutic approaches such as intraoperative 
radiotherapy (IORT) and hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) 
compared with conventionally fractionated whole breast irradiation (CF-WBI) is 
unknown. Therefore, we used prospectively collected outcomes from randomized 
clinical trials (RCTs) to compare the cost-effectiveness of these approaches.
METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic model that followed women who were 
treated with lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer. Recurrence, mortality, 
complication rates, and utilities (five-year radiation-associated quality of 
life scores), were extracted from RCTs. Costs were based on Medicare 
reimbursement rates. Cost-effectiveness from societal and health care sector 
perspectives was estimated considering two scenarios-the first assumes that 
radiation-associated disutility persists five years after treatment, and the 
second assumes that disutility discontinues. Lifetime outcomes were summarized 
using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: HF-WBI dominated CF-WBI (ie, resulted in higher quality-adjusted 
life-years [QALYs] and lower cost) in all scenarios. HF-WBI also had a greater 
likelihood of cost-effectiveness compared with IORT; under a societal 
perspective that assumes that radiation-associated disutility persists, HF-WBI 
results in an ICER of $17 024 per QALY compared with IORT with a probability of 
cost-effectiveness of 80% at the $100 000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. 
If radiation-associated disutility is assumed to discontinue, the ICER is lower 
($11 461/QALY), resulting in an even higher (83%) probability of relative 
cost-effectiveness. The ICER was most sensitive to the probability of metastasis 
and treatment cost.
CONCLUSIONS: For women with early-stage breast cancer requiring adjuvant 
radiotherapy, HF-WBI is cost-effective compared with CF-WBI and IORT.

It is not standard practice to treat patients with acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection. However, as the incidence of HCV in the United States continues to 
rise, it may be time to re-evaluate acute HCV management in the era of 
direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents. In this study, a microsimulation model was 
developed to analyze the trade-offs between initiating HCV therapy in the acute 
versus chronic phase of infection. By simulating the lifetime clinical course of 
patients with acute HCV infection, we were able to project long-term outcomes 
such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. We found that treating 
acute HCV versus deferring treatment until the chronic phase increased QALYs by 
0.02 and increased costs by $483 in patients not at risk of transmitting HCV. 
The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $19,991 per QALY, 
demonstrating that treatment of acute HCV was cost-effective using a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. In patients at risk of 
transmitting HCV, treating acute HCV became cost-saving, increasing QALYs by 
0.03 and decreasing costs by $3,655.
CONCLUSION: Immediate treatment of acute HCV with DAAs can improve clinical 
outcomes and be highly cost-effective or cost-saving compared with deferring 
treatment until the chronic phase of infection. If future studies continue to 
demonstrate effective HCV cure with shorter 6-week treatment duration, then it 
may be time to revisit current HCV guidelines to incorporate recommendations 
that account for the clinical and economic benefits of treating acute HCV in the 
era of DAAs. (Hepatology 2018;67:837-846).

Services, Washington, DC.

DESCRIPTION: In April 2017, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the 
U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) approved a joint clinical practice guideline 
for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: The VA/DoD Evidence-Based Practice Work Group convened a joint VA/DoD 
guideline development effort that included a multidisciplinary panel of 
practicing clinician stakeholders and conformed to the Institute of Medicine's 
tenets for trustworthy clinical practice guidelines. The guideline panel 
developed key questions in collaboration with the ECRI Institute, which 
systematically searched and evaluated the literature through June 2016, 
developed an algorithm, and rated recommendations by using the GRADE (Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: This synopsis summarizes key features of the guideline in 7 
areas: patient-centered care and shared decision making, glycemic biomarkers, 
hemoglobin A1c target ranges, individualized treatment plans, outpatient 
pharmacologic treatment, glucose targets for critically ill patients, and 
treatment of hospitalized patients.

Exploration of unsupervised feature selection methods to predict chronological 
age of individuals by utilising CpG dinucleotics from whole blood.

Sarac F, Seker H, Bouridane A.

Identification of the age of individuals from epigenetic biomarkers can reveal 
vital information for criminal investigation, disease prevention, and extension 
of life. DNA methylation changes are highly associated with chronological age 
and the process of disease development. Computational methods such as 
clustering, feature selection and regression can be utilised to construct 
quantitative model of aging. In this study, we utilised 473034 CpG biomarkers 
from whole blood of 656 individuals aged 19 to 101 to construct predictive 
models and we treat the development of this age predictive model as extremely 
high-dimensional regression problem that is relatively understudied. Unlike 
semi-supervised and supervised feature selection methods, unsupervised feature 
selection methods are generally good at removing irrelevant features that can 
act as noise. In this study, along with the entire feature set, four different 
unsupervised feature selection methods (USFSMs) are therefore considered for the 
quantitative prediction of human ages. Since USFSMs are independent of any 
predictive method, support vector regression is then used to evaluate the 
prediction performances of the unsupervised feature selection methods. We 
proposed a novel k-means based unsupervised feature selection method to predict 
human ages by utilising CpG dinucleotides. Experimental results have validated 
the effectiveness of the proposed method as the optimum number of the CpG 
dinucleotides is found to be only 41 that corresponds to only 0.0087% of the 
entire feature space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that 
presents exploration and comprehensive comparison of USFSMs in very high 
dimensional regression problems, particularly in epigenetic biomedical domain 
for the prediction of chronological age from changes in DNA methylation.

Cardiac safety profile for Random Complex Waveforms.

Pratt H, Andrews C, Panescu D, Lake B.

INTRODUCTION: A rigorous method for assessing the Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) 
risk of a Random Complex Waveform (RCW) has not been previously available. 
Real-life hazardous events motivated us to develop such method. An RCW is 
observable and recordable. It consists of multiple different components randomly 
added one to the other. Assessment for VF risk exists for non-random waveforms, 
particularly VF thresholds for 50/60 Hz alternating currents, but not for RCWs.
METHODS: We developed a method which considers exposure to a segment of an RCW. 
It transforms complex segment exposure to values which can be compared with AC 
root-mean-square (rms) magnitude/duration curves, for determination of VF risk. 
Human contact could occur for any given time duration within the segment. The 
current of most risk is the greatest found for all possible instances of that 
duration. This is termed the "Probable Current" (PC) for that duration. All 
possible exposure durations in the waveform segment are considered, giving a set 
of PCs, thus allowing the plotting of a PC curve. The PC set is compared with a 
criterion for VF risk, termed the Justified Current (JC) curve.
RESULTS: The theory is presented. Demonstrations and examples are given. Code is 
shown for generating the PC curve.
CONCLUSION: VF risk can be found for an RCW using the rigorous algorithm 
presented.
SIGNIFICANCE: The VF for RCWs has not been considered previously. A rigorous 
statement of a method for VF risk assessment allows extension from regular 
waveforms to RCWs.

Objective: To comprehensively analyze the disease burden of drowning in the 
Chinese population both at the national and provincial levels in 1990 and 2013, 
to provide reference for the development of strategies regarding drowning 
prevention. Methods: Both methods related to unified measurement framework and 
standardized estimation on Global Burden of Disease in 2013, were used. Data on 
deaths caused by injuries were from the following sources which include: Disease 
Surveillance Points, the National Maternal and Child Health Surveillance 
Network, the Death Registration Reporting System of Chinese Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention, Death Registration System and death information from 
Macau and Hong Kong areas of China. Injury-related incidence data was from the 
National Injury Surveillance System and literature review. Parameters as 
death/death rate, years of life lost due to premature mortality 
(YLL)/standardized YLL rate, years living with disability (YLD)/standardized YLD 
rate and disability-adjusted of life years (DALY)/standardized DALY were used to 
analyze the disease burden and changing trend on drowning at both the national 
and all the provincial levels. Results: In 2013, the number of deaths due to 
drowning was63 619 in China, with the standardized mortality rate as 5.29 per 
100 000, accounting for 8.0% of the total injury deaths. Drowning was the fourth 
leading cause of injury death in the whole population and the first leading 
cause of injury death among children aged <5 and 5-14 years old in 2013, with 
YLL of drowning as 3.49 million person years, YLD as 0.04 million person years, 
and DALY as 3.53 million person years. Compared with data from 1990, the rates 
on standardized mortality, standardized YLL, standardized YLD and standardized 
DALY of drowning all declined in 2013. The five provinces/districts/cities with 
the highest rates of drowning were Xinjiang (10.08 per 100 000), Jiangxi (8.44 
per 100 000), Anhui (7.92 per 100 000), Guizhou (7.77 per 100 000) and Sichuan 
(7.68 per 100 000). Standardized mortality of drowning reduced in all provinces 
in 2013. Conclusions: Disease burden of drowning in the Chinese population, 
especially in children, declined significantly in 2013, comparing to 1990. 
However, drowning remains a serious proble, with children and males in 
particular, in China. Research regarding prevention on drowning is in great need 
in the western and central areas where drowning mortalities appeared high.

Publisher: 目的： 了解1990年与2013年中国及各省份人群的溺水疾病负担及变化情况，为制定溺水预防控制策略和措施提供参考依据。 方法： 
运用2013年全球疾病负担研究的测量框架及标准化估算方法，使用来自于全国疾病监测点系统、全国妇幼卫生监测网、中国CDC死因登记报告信息系统、中国澳门地区和香港地区的伤害死亡数据和来自于全国伤害监测系统及文献回顾的伤害发生数据，采用死亡数/率、过早死亡损失寿命年（YLL）/标化YLL率、伤残损失寿命年（YLD）/标化YLD率、伤残调整寿命年（DALY）/标化DALY率等指标，分析描述中国及各省份人群的溺水疾病负担及变化情况。 
结果： 2013年中国人群溺水死亡人数为63 
619，标化死亡率为5.29/10万，占伤害总死亡的8.0%，位列总人群伤害死因第四位，是<5岁及5~14岁儿童首位伤害死因。2013年中国人群溺水造成的YLL为349.08万人年、YLD为4.13万人年、DALY为353.22万人年。与1990年相比，2013年中国人群溺水的标化死亡率、标化YLL率、标化YLD率、标化DALY率均下降。2013年人群溺水标化死亡率最高的5个省份依次为新疆（10.08/10万）、江西（8.44/10万）、安徽（7.92/10万）、贵州（7.77/10万）、四川（7.68/10万），与1990年比较，2013年各省份人群的溺水标化死亡率均下降。 
结论： 
与1990年相比，2013年中国人群尤其是儿童的溺水疾病负担明显下降，但相比国际和其他国家的溺水死亡水平，中国的溺水问题仍然较为严重。儿童人群和男性人群应是我国溺水预防的优先目标人群，西部和中部地区是我国溺水高死亡地区，亟待开展溺水预防研究和项目。.

Objective: To analyze the disease burden of violence in the Chinese population, 
in 1990 and 2013. Methods: Indicators including mortality rate, years of life 
lost due to premature mortality (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and 
disability-adjusted of life years (DALY) related to violence, were extracted 
from the Global Burden of Disease 2013 and used to describe the burden of 
disease caused by violence in the Chinese population. Data related to 
corresponding parameters on disease burden of violence in 1990 and 2013 were 
described. Results: In 2013, a total of 20 500 people died of violent events, 
with the death rate as 1.44 per 100 000, in China. DALY caused by violence was 
1.08 million person years in 2013. DALY caused by sharp violence was 0.47 
million person years, with 0.09 million person years lost due to firearm 
violence. Disease burden caused by violence appeared higher in males than in 
females. When comparing with data from the 1990s, reductions were seen by 67.35% 
on the standardized death rate of violence, by 68.07% on the DALY attributable 
to violence, and by 70.47% on the standardized DALY rate attributable to 
violence, respectively, in 2013. Disease burden of violence among young adults 
and elderly was among the highest. When comparing with data from the 1990, DALY 
in 2013 decreased among all the age groups except for the 70-year-old showed an 
increase of 9.36%. The standardized DALY rate in 2013 showed a declining trend 
in all the age groups, mostly in the 0-4-year-old group. The standardized DALY 
rates caused by sharp violence or firearm decreased by75.11% and 83.20% in the 
0-4-year-old group. Conclusion: In recent years, the disease burden caused by 
violence showed a decreasing trend but appeared higher in males however with the 
increase of DALY in the elder population.

利用2013年全球疾病负担中国研究结果，采用死亡率、过早死亡损失寿命年（YLL）、伤残损失寿命年（YLD）和伤残调整寿命年（DALY）等指标，对中国人群暴力疾病负担情况进行描述，并与1990年相应指标进行对比，描述中国暴力疾病负担的变化情况。 
结果： 
2013年中国人群暴力死亡2.05万人，死亡率为1.44/10万；暴力造成的DALY损失为108.3万人年，其中锐器伤暴力造成的DALY损失为47.50万人年，火器伤暴力造成的DALY损失为9.03万人年，其他原因暴力造成的DALY损失为51.60万人年。男性暴力造成的DALY损失高于女性。与1990年相比，暴力标化死亡率下降67.35%，暴力DALY绝对值下降68.07%，暴力年龄标化DALY率下降70.47%；分年龄组结果显示，青壮年和老年人群的暴力疾病负担最为严重，与1990年相比，2013年≥70岁老年人的DALY绝对值上升9.36%，其中锐器伤暴力DALY上升17.65%；暴力标化DALY率在各个年龄段均呈现下降趋势，下降幅度最大的是0~4岁，其中，锐器伤暴力DALY率在0~4岁年龄段下降幅度为75.11%，火器伤暴力DALY率在0~4岁年龄段下降83.20%。 
结论： 现阶段暴力造成的疾病负担下降，男性人群疾病负担高于女性，老年人的暴力疾病负担出现上升，且以锐器伤暴力为主，须采取针对性的防控措施。.

Objective: To explore the disease burden of road injuries in China. Methods: The 
results of Global Burden of Disease 2013 including death rate, 
disability-adjusted of life years (DALY), years of life lost due to premature 
mortality (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), were used to describe the 
burden caused by road injuries in 2013 and the trends from 1990 to 2013, in 
China. Results: In 2013, there were 313 676 deaths caused by traffic accidents 
in China. Death rate, rates on DALY, YLL and YLD were 22.52 per 100 000, 1 
076.54 per 100 000, 971.21 per 100 000 and 105.34 per 100 000, respectively. 
Rates on deaths, YLL and YLD appeared higher in males, pedestrians than in 
females and other types of road travelers. Burden of injuries caused by traffic 
accidents was seen higher in those aged 15 to 49-year-old. From 1990 to 2013, 
the overall death rate on road injuries increased by 0.54 per 100 000 in China, 
with an increase of 2.34 per 100 000 and 0.81 per 100 000, respectively in males 
and pedestrians. The rates on DALY, YLL and YLD decreased by 164.21 per 100 000, 
115.06 per 100 000 and 49.06 per 100 000, respectively. Conclusions: During the 
past 20 years, achievements had been made on road injury prevention and control, 
with the decrease of disease burden caused by road accidents. Males, young 
adults and pedestrians should be called for more attention to prevent road 
injuries.

Publisher: 目的： 了解我国道路伤害流行状况。 方法： 
利用2013年全球疾病负担数据，采用死亡率、伤残调整寿命年（DALY）、过早死亡损失寿命年（YLL）和伤残损失寿命年（YLD）等疾病负担指标，对我国1990年与2013年间道路伤害疾病负担变化情况进行描述。 
结果： 2013年我国因道路伤害死亡313 676人，死亡率、DALY率、YLL率、YLD率分别为22.52/10万、1 
076.54/10万、971.21/10万和105.34/10万。男性道路伤害死亡率、YLL率和YLD率均高于女性；行人的道路伤害死亡率、YLL率和YLD率均高于其他类型道路使用者；15~49岁人群道路伤害疾病负担高于其他年龄组。与1990年相比，2013年我国人群道路伤害死亡率升高了0.54/10万，男性道路伤害死亡率升高了2.34/10万，行人死亡率升高了0.81/10万；我国人群道路伤害DALY率、YLL率和YLD率分别降低了164.21/10万、115.06/10万和49.06/10万。 
结论： 过去20年，我国道路伤害防控工作已经取得了一定成效，道路伤害疾病负担总体呈下降趋势。男性、青壮年、行人是未来我国道路伤害防控工作需要关注的重点人群。.
