Southern root-knot nematode [SRKN, Meloidogyne incognita (Kofold & White) 
Chitwood] is a plant-parasitic nematode challenging to control due to its short 
life cycle, a wide range of hosts, and limited management options, of which 
genetic resistance is the main option to efficiently control the damage caused 
by SRKN. To date, a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapped on chromosome 
(Chr.) 10 plays an essential role in resistance to SRKN in soybean varieties. 
The confidence of discovered trait-loci associations by traditional methods is 
often limited by the assumptions of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) always acting independently as well as the phenotype following a Gaussian 
distribution. Therefore, the objective of this study was to conduct machine 
learning (ML)-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) utilizing Random 
Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to unveil novel regions 
of the soybean genome associated with resistance to SRKN. A total of 717 
breeding lines derived from 330 unique bi-parental populations were genotyped 
with the Illumina Infinium BARCSoySNP6K BeadChip and phenotyped for SRKN 
resistance in a greenhouse. A GWAS pipeline involving a supervised feature 
dimension reduction based on Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) and SNP 
detection based on classification accuracy was proposed. Minor effect SNPs were 
detected by the proposed ML-GWAS methodology but not identified using 
Bayesian-information and linkage-disequilibrium Iteratively Nested Keyway 
(BLINK), Fixed and Random Model Circulating Probability Unification (FarmCPU), 
and Enriched Compressed Mixed Linear Model (ECMLM) models. Besides the genomic 
region on Chr. 10 that can explain most of SRKN resistance variance, additional 
minor effects SNPs were also identified on Chrs. 10 and 11. The findings in this 
study demonstrated that overfitting in GWAS may lead to lower prediction 
accuracy, and the detection of significant SNPs based on classification accuracy 
limited false-positive associations. The expansion of the basis of the genetic 
resistance to SRKN can potentially reduce the selection pressure over the major 
QTL on Chr. 10 and achieve higher levels of resistance.

The purpose of this project was to update competencies for spiritual care 
professionals specializing in palliative and bereavement care in Canada. Phase 
one feedback was obtained from 11 clients: six inpatients with greater than two 
weeks of life expectancy using interviews and five bereaved family members in a 
focus group. Results were analyzed for congruence or discordance with draft 
competencies. In phase two, 22 spiritual care experts reached a consensus on 
nine competencies using a modified Delphi survey. Two limitations were the small 
sample size and cultural and religious homogeneity of participants.

BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis, a chronic and degenerative joint disease, is 
more common among the growing elderly population. With the increasing life 
expectancy and obesity, the significance of knee osteoarthritis for public 
health has become more evident.
AIM: This study was carried out to investigate the relationship between the 
functional status of individuals with knee osteoarthritis and their quality of 
life.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The population of the study consisted of individuals with 
1-4 s level of knee osteoarthritis diagnosed over the age of 50 who attended the 
physical therapy and rehabilitation polyclinic at Atatürk University hospital. 
The study was carried out with 129 individuals with knee osteoarthritis without 
sample selection. The data were collected using a demographic questionnaire and 
The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and analyzed with SPSS 
22.00 statistical package program using frequency, percentage, t-test, 
Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, and Dunnett T3 post hoc test.
RESULTS: According to the results, the KOOS Function and Daily Life scores 
showing the functional status of the participants were 46.61 ± 16.17. The 
Function and Sports/Leisure Activities subscale scores were 29.49 ± 23.73, and 
the mean scores of the Quality of Life subscale were 34.15 ± 18.11. A positive 
significant relationship was determined between the functional status and the 
quality of life in the individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: As the functional status of individuals improves, the quality of 
life increases too.

AIMS: The Parkinson's KinetiGraph (PKG) is a wrist-worn movement recording 
system that collates continuous, objective, data during daily activities in 
people with Parkinson's disease (PD) providing a report for clinicians. This 
study explores the cost-effectiveness of adding the PKG to routine PD 
assessments.
METHODS: A de novo Markov model of three health states: uncontrolled, controlled 
and death compared PKG plus routine assessment by a Movement Disease Specialist 
(MDS) versus routine assessment. Uncontrolled and controlled states were based 
on the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale 
(MDS-UPDRS) II and III scores. The transition between health states was 
dependent on improvement in MDS-UPDRS II and III, and transition to death state 
on all cause-mortality and PD-specific relative mortality risk. Markov cycle 
length was yearly beyond year 1 and lifetime horizon 22 years.
LIMITATIONS: PKG evidence incorporated in this analysis is based on findings 
from one clinical trial. Health state utilities were mapped and the probability 
of patients progressing from uncontrolled to controlled health state at the 
second visit and beyond was derived from a bootstrap method which assumed a 
normal distribution for MDS-UPDRS.
RESULTS: The addition of the PKG to usual PD assessments is a cost-effective 
intervention. PKG plus routine assessment is associated with lower total costs 
compared to routine assessment (£141,950 versus £159,312) and improved 
quality-adjusted life years (7.88 versus 7.61), resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of -£64,978.99 and a net monetary benefit of £22,706.37 
using a £20,000 threshold. Results were robust across sensitivity and scenario 
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Management of PD involves monitoring and evaluation of symptoms to 
assess disease progression and ensure appropriate treatment choices. Adding the 
PKG to clinical assessment in routine care allows for improved and objective 
identification of PD motor symptoms which can be used in clinical decision 
making to improve patient outcomes.

Plain Language Summary: Hospital doctors caring for people with Parkinson's 
disease (PwP) regularly monitor and assess their patients’ symptoms, relying on 
patient recall and patient-completed diaries to find out about current symptoms, 
which can be unreliable. The Parkinson's KinetiGraph (PKG) is a wrist-worn 
device that collects continuous information on movement in PwP. A report is then 
provided to the patient's Consultant helping them to understand the PwP's 
symptoms and make decisions about changing medication to improve symptom 
control.An economic model compared asking patients to wear a PKG device for 6 
days before their check-up appointment with their Consultant with usual check-up 
without the PKG. Information from a clinical trial exploring the use of PKG 
provided data on Movement Disorder Society – Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating 
Scale (MDS-UPDRS) II and III scores, which were used in the model to predict 
improvements in quality of life and whether PwP had controlled or uncontrolled 
disease.The model showed that addition of PKG to usual check-ups is a 
cost-effective approach. Use of the PKG reduced costs (£141,950 versus £159,312 
for usual check-ups) and had a positive impact on quality and quantity of life 
as measured by quality adjusted life years (7.88 versus 7.61).This study shows 
that adding the PKG to routine check-ups allows Consultants to accurately assess 
movement (or motor) symptoms in PwP, which can then be used to ensure optimal 
mediation choice and improve patient outcomes.

Governments regularly have to decide whether new vaccines should be adopted in 
their national immunization program. These choices imply complex trade-offs of 
epidemiological, medical and socio-economic criteria. We investigated how the 
population in Flanders (Belgium) wants their government to set vaccine-funding 
priorities. In December 2019, we executed a discrete choice experiment in a 
sample of the Flemish population (N = 1636). In total, we analysed 16 360 
choices between vaccines competing for funding, described in terms of eight 
characteristics. Using a panel mixed logit model, we quantified the relative 
importance of each characteristic and investigated differences in preferences 
across respondent groups. The observed vaccine priorities were different from 
those that would be identified through cost-effectiveness analysis. People 
valued the health impact from infectious diseases differently than their weight 
expressed in QALYs would suggest. Mortality and frequently occurring mild 
illness were valued higher, whereas lasting morbidity received lower weight. 
Contribution of the vaccine to disease eradication and uncertainty in vaccine 
effectiveness were both highly influential factors. Health equity impact was 
also important whereas the economic impact of the disease did not matter at all. 
Our results can be used to incorporate public values into vaccine 
decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Inclisiran is a novel, cholesterol-lowering therapy, with a long 
duration of effect, administered every 6 months (subcutaneously by a healthcare 
professional). In the ORION-10 trial in US patients with atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in addition to maximum tolerated statins, with or 
without ezetimibe, inclisiran demonstrated statistically significant reductions 
in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of up to 51%. This is the first 
peer-reviewed publication to investigate the price at which inclisiran is cost 
effective in the US.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the maximum price at which 
inclisiran is cost effective in addition to standard of care, in US patients 
with ASCVD, versus standard of care alone, at different willingness-to-pay 
thresholds.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A lifetime Markov model from the US health 
system perspective, including 15 health states, was used to evaluate the cost 
effectiveness of inclisiran. The following states were separated by time from a 
previous cardiovascular event (0-1 years, 1-2 years, 2+ years ['stable']): 
initial, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Additional states 
included revascularization and death (cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular 
causes). Baseline risk of cardivoascular events were from US database sources or 
published literature. Reductions in LDL-C from inclisiran were from the ORION-10 
trial. LDL-C reduction was used to adjust baseline risk of cardiovascular 
events, based on established relationships between 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C 
and decreases in cardiovascular events, from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists 
studies. The population included adults with a history of ASCVD, and LDL-C 
≥ 70 mg/dL, despite maximum tolerated doses of statin therapy.
INTERVENTIONS: Inclisiran as an adjunct to standard of care, compared with 
standard of care alone.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The threshold price of inclisiran.
RESULTS: Inclisiran as an adjunct to standard of care resulted in threshold 
annual inclisiran prices of $6383, $9973, and $13,563 at willingness-to-pay 
thresholds of $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, 
respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a threshold of 
$100,000 per QALY, inclisiran had a 100% probability of being cost effective, 
with an annual price below $9000. At the publicly available price of $3250 per 
dose, inclisiran was found to have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio just 
above the $50,000 per QALY threshold, of $51,686.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study identified the price at which inclisiran 
is cost effective for the US health system, at generally accepted 
willingness-to-pay thresholds.

Bees are important pollinators in wild and agricultural ecosystems, and 
understanding the factors driving their global declines is key to maintaining 
these pollination services. Learning, which has been a focus of previous 
ecotoxicological studies in bees, may play a key role in driving colony fitness. 
Here we move beyond the standard single-stressor approach to ask how multiple 
stressors, an agrochemical (sulfoxaflor, a relatively new insecticide) and a 
parasite (Crithidia bombi, a prevalent gut parasite of bumblebees), impact 
learning in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We developed a modified version of 
the classic proboscis extension reflex assay to assess the combined effects of 
acute oral sulfoxaflor exposure and infection by C. bombi on olfactory learning 
of bumblebee workers. We found no evidence that either sulfoxaflor, C. bombi, or 
their combination had any significant effect on bumblebee olfactory learning, 
despite their known negative impacts on other aspects of bumblebee health. This 
suggests that losses in cognitive ability, as measured here, are unlikely to 
explain the impacts of sulfoxaflor and its interactions with other stressors on 
bumblebees. Our novel methodology provides a model system within which to test 
interactive effects of other key stressors on bee health.

Pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (PPP) can lead to life-threatening 
complications. The objective of this study is to report clinical and genetic 
spectrum, prognostic factors and management options. A retrospective study was 
designed including eight PPP patients. Clinical data were collected, and 
performed genetic and statistical analysis to identify factors associated with 
fetal complications, resistance to treatment and post-partum flare extension. A 
systematic review of the literature was also carried out. Eight Tunisian 
patients, with a mean age of 23 ± 3.3 years, were included. They presented 14 
flares (F) during pregnancies and one flare after delivery. Additional GPP 
flares outside pregnancy periods were noted in 2/8 of patients. The mean 
duration of PPP flares was 16.66 ± 7.8 weeks. The first flare occurred at a 
gestational age of 26 ± 5 weeks. Only 2/8 studied patients presented a 
homozygous mutation c.80 T > C (p.L27P) in IL36RN gene. Used treatments were 
topical steroids (n = 12F), systemic steroids (n = 5F), ciclosporin (n = 1F), 
UVB (n = 1F) and acitretin (in post-partum n = 6F). Complications were 
oligoamnios (n = 2), intra-uterine growth retardation (n = 1), fetal death in 
utero (n = 1), prematurity (n = 3), low weight at birth (n = 2). A significant 
association was found between (i) occurrence of fetal complications and early 
gestational age at the onset (p = 0.036), (ii) resistance to topical steroids 
and body surface affected area (p = 0.008), (iii) presence of mutation 
c.80 T > C in PPP flares and low serum levels of calcium (p = 0.01). Our 
systematic review of the literature identified 39 patients with 41 flares of 
PPP. Only 7/39 patients presented a causative mutation in IL36RN and CARD14 
genes. PPP is characterized by a phenotypic heterogeneity and can be associated 
to IL36RN mutations. Its early onset can be associated with fetal complications. 
Systemic steroids and cyclosporine remain the most used therapies.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the burden of osteoarthritis (OA) in India from 1990 to 
2019.
DESIGN: Data from Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) 2019 were used. The burden of OA -knee OA, hip OA, hand OA, and other OA- 
was estimated for India and its states from 1990 to 2019 through a systematic 
analysis of prevalence, incidence, years lived with disability (YLD), and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) using methods reported in GBD 2019 study.
RESULT: Around 23.46 million individuals in India had OA in 1990; this increased 
to 62.35 million in 2019. The age-standardised prevalence of OA increased from 
4,895 (95% uncertainty interval (UI):4,420-5,447) in 1990-5313 
(95%UI:4,799-5,898) in 2019, per 100,000 persons. Similarly, DALYs due to OA 
increased from 0.79 million (95%UI:0.40-1.55) to 2.12 million (95%UI:1.07-4.23); 
while age-standardised DALYs increased from 164 (95%UI:83-325) to 180 
(95%UI:91-361) per 100,000 persons from 1990 to 2019. OA was the 20th most 
common cause of YLDs in India in 2019, accounting for 1.48% (95%UI:0.88-2.78) of 
all YLDs; increasing from 23rd most common cause in 1990 
(1.25%(95%UI:0.74-2.34)). Knee OA was the most common form of OA, followed by 
hand OA. The prevalence, incidence, and DALYs for OA and knee OA were 
consistently higher in females than males.
CONCLUSION: The burden and impact of OA in India are substantial and is 
increasing. Adopting suitable control and preventive community measures to 
reduce modifiable risk factors (obesity, injuries, occupational stress) are 
needed to reduce the current and future burden of OA in India.

PURPOSE: Cholecystectomy is the gold standard treatment for gallbladder disease. 
As life expectancy increases, awareness of cholecystitis treatment in the 
elderly changes. The safety and feasibility of cholecystectomy in octogenarians 
have been proven in many studies. Surgical treatment for cholecystitis should be 
considered in octogenarians and even nonagenarians. In this study, we aimed to 
assess the outcomes of cholecystectomy in octogenarians and nonagenarians with 
acute cholecystitis.
METHODS: A total of 393 patients aged 80 to 89 years (352 octogenarians) and 90 
to 99 years (41 nonagenarians) diagnosed with acute cholecystitis underwent 
cholecystectomy between March 2012 and June 2020. All patients were classified 
according to the Tokyo guidelines. The evaluated parameters included demographic 
data, surgical outcomes, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 
classification, and Tokyo guidelines.
RESULTS: All 393 patients were analyzed and divided into two groups according to 
age; octogenarians (83.57 ± 2.64 years) and nonagenarians (92.98 ± 3.15 years). 
The survival rate was 97.7% for octogenarians and 97.6% for nonagenarians. 
Laparoscopic surgery was performed more in both groups (96.8% in octogenarians 
and 92.7% in nonagenarians) than open surgery (3.2% in octogenarians and 7.3% in 
nonagenarians). The operation time of the nonagenarian group (74.63 ± 30.83 
minutes) was shorter than the octogenarian group (75.85 ± 34.63 minutes). The 
incidences of postoperative complications in the octogenarian and nonagenarian 
groups were as follows pneumonia, 5.7% and 7.3%; bleeding, 1.7% and 2.4%; 
gastrointestinal symptoms, 6.0% and 2.4%; and bile leakage, 0.6% and 2.4%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Cholecystectomy is a safe and efficient procedure for the treatment 
of acute cholecystitis in both octogenarians and nonagenarians.

OBJECTIVE: In order to explore the effect of rehabilitation training based on 
automatic extraction algorithm on knee anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction 
under arthroscopy.
METHODS: 81 patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury were randomly 
divided into observation group (42 cases) and control group (39 cases). The 
control group was given routine nursing, while the observation group was given 
rehabilitation training guidance based on automatic extraction algorithm. 
Lysholm score, HSS score, and range of motion of knee joint extension and 
flexion were used to evaluate the knee joint function before and after operation 
in the two groups. The quality of life of the two groups was evaluated by the 
concise health survey scale. The results showed that 50% of deep venous 
thrombosis occurred on the first day and 30% on the second day after operation. 
There was no significant difference in preoperative Lysholm score, HSS score, 
and knee flexion activity between the observation group and the control group (P 
> 0.01). After 1-month, 5-month, and 1-year follow-up, the effective rate of 
knee function recovery in the observation group was significantly better than 
that in the control group. Lysholm score, HSS score, and knee extension and 
flexion activity were significantly different from those in the control group (P 
< 0.01). The postoperative SF-36 quality of life score of the observation group 
was significantly higher than that of the control group, indicating that the 
quality of life of the observation group was significantly better than that of 
the control group. Therefore, early postoperative rehabilitation training 
guidance based on automatic extraction algorithm can improve local blood 
circulation and improve knee function and reduce pain, so as to promote the 
early recovery of patients.

BACKGROUND: Digital Health Interventions (DHIs) refers to the utilization of 
digital and mobile technology to support the health system in service delivery. 
Over the recent years, advanced computing, genomics, and artificial intelligence 
are considered part of digital health. In the context of the World Health 
Organization (WHO) global strategy 2020-2025, digital health is defined as "the 
field of knowledge and practice associated with the development and use of 
digital technologies to improve health." The scoping review protocol details the 
procedure for developing a comprehensive list of DHIs in Sub-Saharan Africa and 
documenting their roles in strengthening health systems.
METHOD AND ANALYSIS: A scoping review will be done according to the Joanne 
Briggs institute reviewers manual and following the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) checklist and explanation. The protocol has been registered at the 
Open Science Framework (OSF) database at https://osf.io/5kzq7. The review will 
include DHIs conceptualized/developed/designed, adapted, piloted, deployed, 
scaled up, and addressing health challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa. We will 
retrieve data from the global DHI repository-the WHO Digital Health Atlas (DHA)- 
and supplement it with information from the WHO eHealth Observatory, eHealth 
Survey (2015), and eHealth country profiles report. Additional searches will be 
conducted in four (4) electronic databases: PubMed, HINARI-Reasearch4Life, 
Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. The review will also include gray 
literature and reference lists of selected studies. Data will be organized in 
conceptual categories looking at digital health interventions' distinct function 
toward achieving health sector objectives.
DISCUSSION: Sub-Saharan Africa is an emerging powerhouse in DHI innovations with 
rapid expansion and evolvement. The enthusiasm for digital health has 
experienced challenges including an escalation of short-lived digital health 
interventions, duplication, and minimal documentation of evidence on their 
impact on the health system. Efficient use of resources is important when 
striving toward the use digital health interventions in health systems 
strengthening. This can be achieved through documenting successes and lessons 
learnt over time.
CONCLUSION: The review will provide the evidence to guide further investments in 
DHIs, avoid duplication, circumvent barriers, focus on gaps, and scale-up 
successful interventions.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies revealed that the elderly and those with 
comorbidities are most affected by COVID-19, but it is important to investigate 
shared genetic mechanisms between COVID-19 risk and aging.
METHODS: We conducted a multi-instrument Mendelian Randomization analysis of 
multiple lifespan-related traits and COVID-19. Aging clock models were applied 
to the subjects with different COVID-19 conditions in the UK-Biobank cohort. We 
performed a bivariate genomic scan for age-related COVID-19 and Mendelian 
Randomization analysis of 389 immune cell traits to investigate their effect on 
lifespan and COVID-19 risk.
RESULTS: We show that the genetic variation that supports longer life is 
significantly associated with the lower risk of COVID-19 infection and 
hospitalization. The odds ratio is 0.31 (P = 9.7 × 10-6) and 0.46 
(P = 3.3 × 10-4), respectively, per additional 10 years of life. We detect an 
association between biological age acceleration and future incidence and 
severity of COVID-19 infection. Genetic profiling of age-related COVID-19 
infection indicates key contributions of Notch signaling and immune system 
development. We reveal a negative correlation between the effects of immune cell 
traits on lifespan and COVID-19 risk. We find that lower B-cell CD19 levels are 
indicative of an increased risk of COVID-19 and decreased life expectancy, which 
is further validated by COVID-19 clinical data.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that the factors that accelerate aging lead 
to an increased COVID-19 risk and point to the importance of Notch signaling and 
B cells in both. Interventions that target these factors to reduce biological 
age may reduce the risk of COVID-19.

Millet bran, a by-product obtained during millet processing is rich in 
nutrients, fiber, antioxidants and phyto-nutrients, but remains underutilized. 
Consumption of bakery products have increased significantly among all age 
groups. Majority of the bakery products are calorie dense and lack nutrients. 
There are limited studies on utilization of minor millet brans and bran rich 
fractions (BRF) in development of bakery products. Thus, present study aimed at 
formulating designer buns and muffins using foxtail and kodo millet BRF 
respectively. It was observed that buns prepared with 20% foxtail and muffins 
prepared with 30% kodo BRF showed better acceptability. The nutritional profile 
of BRF enriched buns and muffins had significant increase in dietary fibre 
(2.73% and 2.79%), iron, calcium, zinc, antioxidant capacity and phytonutrient 
content. A reduction was observed in the available carbohydrates in both buns 
(51.11-47.85 g/100 g) and muffins (46.76-43.87 g/100 g). Buns and muffin 
exhibited moderate glycemic index (57.71, 56.42) and glycemic load (19.32, 
14.85) respectively. Shelf life of buns and muffins was 3 and 7 days 
respectively at room temperature. In both the products moisture, water activity 
and microbial plate count increased during storage whereas sensory acceptability 
decreased. The study indicates that addition of minor millet BRF in baked 
products enhanced nutritional content and reduced glycemic index thereby 
exhibiting its potential as a functional ingredient in food processing.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the value of combining percutaneous 
transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGD) with gallbladder-preserving 
cholecystolithotomy (GPC) in high-risk patients with acute calculous 
cholecystitis.
METHODS: Clinical data from 74 high-risk patients with acute calculous 
cholecystitis, admitted to our hospital between October 2018 and September 2021, 
were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients underwent PTGD, and 59 of them 
underwent delayed cholecystectomy, while 14 patients were subjected to GPC 8-12 
weeks after the PTGD; one patient, whose life expectancy was fewer than 6 
months, was not treated for gallstones after PTGD.
RESULTS: In all 74 patients, symptom remission was achieved after the PTGD 
therapy, and the incidence of catheter-related complications was 10.8%. Among 
the 59 patients who underwent delayed cholecystectomy (DC) after PTGD, there was 
a complication incidence of 6.8%. Of the 14 patients who underwent GPC after the 
PTGD, 13 patients were subjected to the removal of drainage tubes, 1 patient 
received cholecystostomy catheter draining externally, and two patients (14.3%) 
had complications. There were no perioperative deaths.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage, combined with GPC, 
is a safe and effective treatment that is suitable for high-risk patients with 
acute calculous cholecystitis who cannot receive DC. This combined method allows 
for early acute cholecystitis to settle, helps to remove gallstones at a later 
stage, and solves the problem of long-term tube drainage after PTGD.

The emerging importance of tackling sleep-diet interactions in lifestyle 
interventions for weight management.

Sleep habits are directly related to risk of obesity, and this relationship may 
be partly mediated through food choices and eating behaviour. Short sleep 
duration, impaired sleep quality and suboptimal sleep timing are all implicated 
in weight gain and adverse cardiometabolic health, at least partly mediated 
through their associations with diet quality. Short-term sleep restriction leads 
to increased energy intake, and habitually short sleepers report dietary intakes 
that indicate a less healthy diet compared with adequate sleepers. Evidence is 
emerging that sleep extension interventions in short sleepers may reduce intake 
of sugars and overall energy intake. Poor sleep quality, night shift work 
patterns and social jetlag are also associated with lower diet quality and 
consumption of energy-dense foods. Incorporating sleep advice into weight 
management interventions may be more effective than energy-restricted diets and 
exercise advice alone. However, there are a lack of intervention studies that 
aim to lengthen sleep, improve sleep quality or adjust irregular sleep timing to 
investigate the impact on dietary intakes and eating behaviour in participants 
aiming to lose weight or maintain weight loss. Finally, future research should 
take account of individual characteristics such as age, sex, life stage and 
changing working practices when designing combined lifestyle interventions 
including sleep behaviour change for health and well-being.

Rozechai River is one of the tributaries of Urmia Lake (the nrthwest of Iran), 
which has experienced severe pollution and water level fluctuations in the 
coastal zone over the past four decades. The present study aimed to assess the 
ecological risk for aquatic life and human health. Research methods were 
designed for applying the sediment quality guidelines (LEL, PEL, SEL), sediment 
quality indices (Cf, Cd, Er, RI), and enrichment factor (EF) based on the 
concentration of toxic metals in sediments. Event-based geochronology of the 
sediment column showed that the high stands in the water level of the Urmia Lake 
(> 1274 m) occurred in 1983, 1989, and 1995. Thus, As, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cr, and Ni 
reached a moderate to considerable enrichment under the oxidation and alkaline 
condition. Consequently, a moderated level of ecological risk index (RI) was 
predominant between 1983 and 1999. The uppermost 35 cm of the sediment column 
was deposited during a severe drought period to which H2S bearing water and 
reducing status contributed. In such conditions, the low ecological risk was 
resulted in the basin due to the lower rate of the toxic metal influx. The 
industrial, urban, and agricultural wastewaters contributed to the release of 
toxic metals and the dominance of moderate to considerable enrichment, which led 
to a moderate ecological risk at the coastal zone of the Rozechai River. The 
sediment column of the deltaic area has experienced a mean sedimentation rate of 
1.66 cm year-1 since 1982.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Durvalumab and atezolizumab are approved as 
first-line therapy in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. Although 
cost-effectiveness analyses compared these immunotherapy drugs with standard 
chemotherapy-alone regimens, no head-to-head cost-effectiveness comparisons for 
these treatments exist. The aim of the present analysis is to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of durvalumab and atezolizumab as first-line therapy for 
extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer from the US payers' perspective.
METHODS: This study is based on two placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trials: 
CASPIAN and IMpower133. A Markov model was developed to simulate the three 
health states: progression-free survival, progressed disease, and death in 
patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. Transition probabilities 
were estimated from the clinical trial survival curves and extended with 
life-time modelling. Health utilities and direct costs of adverse event 
treatment were included. Main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) using quality-adjusted life-years saved (QALYS). Sensitivity 
analysis was performed to assess the impact of variables on the ICER.
RESULTS: Durvalumab group has a cost of $187,503 with an effectiveness of 1.08 
while atezolizumab has a cost of $160,219 and an effectiveness of 0.932. 
Durvalumab is not cost-effective compared to atezolizumab with an ICER of 
$165,182 QALYS, which is over the willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000. The 
model was most sensitive to durvalumab cost and the cost of treating durvalumab 
adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS: With the ICER of durvalumab treatment group being very close to 
$150,000, setting a higher willingness-to-pay threshold or decreasing the drug 
cost through contract pricing can increase the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab 
compared to atezolizumab.
