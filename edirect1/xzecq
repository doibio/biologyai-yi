enhance the immune response following SBRT targeting oligometastatic lesions. 
Our purpose is to demonstrate, via a randomized 2:1 phase II trial, that SBRT (3 
fractions) with durvalumab in oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
patients would improve progression-free survival in patients with prostate 
cancer with up to 5 metastases compared to patients who exclusively received 
SBRT.
METHODS: This is a multicentric randomized phase II study in French academic 
hospitals. Patients with prostate cancer and up to 5 metastases (lymph node 
and/or bone) were randomized into a 2:1 ratio between Arm A (experimental 
group), corresponding to durvalumab and SBRT to the metastases, and Arm B 
(control group), corresponding to SBRT alone to the metastases. The study aims 
to accrue a total of 96 patients within 3 years. The primary endpoint is 
two-year progression-free survival and secondary endpoints include androgen 
deprivation therapy-free survival, quality of life, toxicity, prostate cancer 
specific survival, overall survival, and immune response.
DISCUSSION: The expected benefit for the patients in the experimental arm is 
longer life expectancy with acceptable toxicity. We also expect our study to 
provide data for better understanding the synergy between immunotherapy and 
radiotherapy in oligometastatic prostate cancer.

Longitudinal studies of infants' brains are essential for research and clinical 
detection of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, for infant brain MRI scans, 
effective deep learning-based segmentation frameworks exist only within small 
age intervals due to the large image intensity and contrast changes that take 
place in the early postnatal stages of development. However, using different 
segmentation frameworks or models at different age intervals within the same 
longitudinal data set would cause segmentation inconsistencies and age-specific 
biases. Thus, an age-agnostic segmentation model for infants' brains is needed. 
In this paper, we present "Infant-SynthSeg", an extension of the 
contrast-agnostic SynthSeg segmentation framework applicable to MRI data of 
infants at ages within the first year of life. Our work mainly focuses on 
extending learning strategies related to synthetic data generation and 
augmentation, with the aim of creating a method that employs training data 
capturing features unique to infants' brains during this early-stage 
development. Comparison across different learning strategy settings, as well as 
a more-traditional contrast-aware deep learning model (nnU-net) are presented. 
Our experiments show that our trained Infant-SynthSeg models show consistently 
high segmentation performance on MRI scans of infant brains throughout the first 
year of life. Furthermore, as the model is trained on ground truth labels at 
different ages, even labels that are not present at certain ages (such as 
cerebellar white matter at 1 month) can be appropriately segmented via 
Infant-SynthSeg across the whole age range. Finally, while Infant-SynthSeg shows 
consistent segmentation performance across the first year of life, it is 
outperformed by age-specific deep learning models trained for a specific narrow 
age range.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the widespread use 
of steroids as a life-saving measure. In patients with preexisting diabetes, the 
therapeutic use of steroids coupled with poorly controlled sugar has led to a 
surge of mucormycosis. We report a rare case of orbital apex syndrome secondary 
to mucormycosis post-COVID-19. A 43-year-old female with poorly controlled 
diabetes mellitus presented with right eye complete ptosis one week 
post-recovery from COVID-19 infection. During COVID-19 hospitalization, she 
received a course of dexamethasone. The visual acuity of the right eye was 6/60. 
She had complete ophthalmoplegia and diplopia in all gazes. There was a positive 
relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) and reduced optic nerve function test 
in the right eye. MRI showed right ethmoid sinusitis with possible extension to 
the right orbit and the presence of right perineural optic nerve enhancement. 
The nasal scope revealed fungal-like thick mucopurulent discharge at the middle 
meatus. She was clinically diagnosed with rhino-orbital mucormycosis and was 
started on antifungal for six weeks. Her overall condition improved with 6/6 
visual acuity and minimum residual ophthalmoplegia. In conclusion, 
corticosteroid treatment for COVID-19 infection in diabetic patients causes poor 
glycemic control and immunosuppression that can lead to secondary infections 
such as rhino-orbital mucormycosis.

BACKGROUND: Loiasis (Loa loa filariasis) is considered a benign disease and is 
currently not included in the World Health Organization's (WHO's) list of 
Neglected Tropical Diseases, despite mounting evidence suggesting significant 
disease burden in endemic areas. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to 
assess the mortality associated with L. loa microfilaremia in the Southwestern 
Republic of Congo.
METHODS: The cohort included 3329 individuals from 53 villages screened for 
loiasis in 2004. We compared mortality rates in 2021 for individuals initially 
diagnosed as with or without L. loa microfilariae 17 years earlier. Data were 
analyzed at the community level to calculate crude mortality rates. Survival 
models were used to estimate the effect of L. loa microfilaremia on mortality in 
the population.
RESULTS: At baseline, prevalence of microfilaremia was 16.2%. During 17.62 years 
of cohort follow-up, 751 deaths were recorded, representing a crude mortality 
rate of 15.36 (95% CI, 14.28-16.50) per 1000 person-years. Median survival time 
was 58.5 (95% CI, 49.7-67.3) years and 39.2 (95% CI, 32.6-45.8) years for 
amicrofilaremic and microfilaremic indiviudals, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in life expectancy was associated with L. 
loa microfilaremia, confirming previous observations from Cameroon. This adds to 
the evidence that loiasis is not a benign disease and deserves to be included in 
the WHO's list of Neglected Tropical Diseases.

Atrial fibrillation: Primary prevention, secondary prevention, and prevention of 
thromboembolic complications: Part 2.

Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, once 
thought to be benign as long as the ventricular rate was controlled, is 
associated with significant cardiac morbidity and mortality. Increasing life 
expectancy driven by improved health care and decreased fertility rates has, in 
most of the world, resulted in the population aged ≥65 years growing more 
rapidly than the overall population. As the population ages, projections suggest 
that the burden of AF may increase more than 60% by 2050. Although considerable 
progress has been made in the treatment and management of AF, primary 
prevention, secondary prevention, and prevention of thromboembolic complications 
remain a work in progress. This narrative review was facilitated by a search of 
MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, 
meta-analyses, and other clinically relevant studies. The search was limited to 
English-language reports published between 1950 and 2021. Atrial fibrillation 
was searched using the terms primary prevention, hyperthyroidism, 
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, catheter ablation, surgical ablation, hybrid 
ablation, stroke prevention, anticoagulation, left atrial occlusion and atrial 
excision. Google and Google scholar as well as bibliographies of identified 
articles were reviewed for additional references. In these two manuscripts, we 
discuss the current strategies available to prevent AF, then compare 
non-invasive and invasive treatment strategies to diminish AF recurrence. In 
addition, we examine the pharmacological, percutaneous device and surgical 
approaches to prevent stroke as well as other types of thromboembolic events.

Intergenerational Patterns in Offending: Lessons from the Rochester 
Intergenerational Study-ASC Division of Developmental and Life Course 
Criminology David P. Farrington Lecture, 2019.

PURPOSE: In recent years, criminology has seen an increase in the number of 
3-generation, prospective studies of offending. The most fundamental question 
posed by these studies is whether, and to what extent, parental involvement in 
adolescent delinquency increases the risk of offending by their offspring. There 
are several important substantive and methodological challenges that need to be 
confronted in assessing the intergenerational effect including the examination 
of moderating influences that can change the level of intergenerational 
continuity and methodological issues as definitional elasticity-the impact on 
the level of intergenerational continuity that is likely to be observed based on 
a) how offending is defined and b) how the inherent heterogeneity in offending 
is taken into accounted.
METHODS: To examine these issues I use data from the Rochester Intergenerational 
Study (RIGS), an extension of the original Rochester Youth Development Study 
(RYDS). RYDS began data collection in 1988 with a sample of 1000 adolescents and 
one of their parents. The intergenerational study began in 1999 by adding a 
third generation member - the oldest biological child of the initial adolescent 
participants - and following them over time with 19 annual assessments.
RESULTS: Overall, there is a significant positive association between a parent's 
involvement in adolescent delinquency and the likelihood that their offspring 
will also be involved in delinquency. That overall relationship, however, masks 
substantial internal variability. The significance and size of the 
intergenerational effect varies by such factors as the level of ongoing contact 
between fathers and their children and the child's gender. It is also influenced 
by methodological considerations such as definitional elasticity. Under some 
definitions of delinquent behavior, a robust relationship between the parent's 
delinquency and the child's is observed while under other definitions there is 
no significant relationship.
CONCLUSION: There is, as of now, no clear and consistent answer to the question 
of whether or not children follow in the footsteps of their parents with respect 
to delinquency. The field of intergenerational study, which is still relatively 
new, needs to confront more directly and systematically how both substantive and 
methodological issues that can influence estimates of the intergenerational 
effect.

Excess Deaths in the United States Compared to 18 Other High-Income Countries.

The U.S. is exceptional among high-income countries for poor survival outcomes. 
Understanding the distribution of excess deaths by age, sex, and cause of death, 
is essential for bringing U.S. mortality in line with international peers. We 
use 2016 data from the World Health Organization Mortality Database and the 
Human Mortality Database to calculate excess deaths in the U.S. relative to each 
of 18 high-income comparison countries. The U.S. experiences excess mortality in 
every age and sex group, and for 16 leading causes of death. For example, the 
U.S. could potentially prevent 884,912 deaths by achieving the lower mortality 
rates of Japan, the comparison country yielding the largest number of excess 
deaths, which would be comparable to eliminating all deaths from heart disease, 
unintentional injuries, and diabetes mellitus. In contrast, the U.S. could 
potentially prevent just 176,825 deaths by achieving the lower mortality rates 
of Germany, the comparison country yielding the smallest number of excess 
deaths, which would be comparable to eliminating all deaths from chronic lower 
respiratory diseases and assault (homicide). Existing research suggests that 
policies that improve social conditions and health behaviors are more likely to 
bring U.S. mortality in line with peer countries than policies that support 
health care access or new biomedical technologies. Achieving the death rates of 
peer countries could result in mortality reductions comparable to eliminating 
leading causes of death.

Cuba and Denmark represent states with different welfare models that have 
reached the same level of life expectancy. The purpose was to investigate and 
compare mortality changes in the two countries. Systematically collected 
information on population numbers and deaths for the entire Cuban and Danish 
populations was the basis of life table data used to quantify differences in the 
change in age-at-death distributions since 1955, age-specific contributions to 
differences in life expectancy, lifespan variation, and other changes in 
mortality patterns in Cuba and Denmark. Life expectancy in Cuba and Denmark 
converged until 2000, when the increase in life expectancy for Cuba slowed down. 
Since 1955, infant mortality has fallen in both countries but mostly in Cuba. 
Both populations experienced compression of mortality as lifespan variation 
decreased markedly, primarily due to postponement of early deaths. Given the 
different starting point in the mid-1900s and living conditions for Cubans and 
Danes, health status achieved among Cubans is striking. A rapidly ageing 
population is challenging both countries, but Cuban health and welfare are 
further burdened by a deteriorating economy in recent decades.

IMPORTANCE: For older adults with frailty syndrome, reducing polypharmacy may 
have utility as a safety-promoting treatment option.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of family conferences on medication and 
clinical outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with frailty receiving 
polypharmacy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cluster randomized clinical trial was 
conducted from April 30, 2019, to June 30, 221, at 110 primary care practices in 
Germany. The study included community-dwelling adults aged 70 years or older 
with frailty syndrome, daily use of at least 5 different medications, a life 
expectancy of at least 6 months, and no moderate or severe dementia.
INTERVENTIONS: General practitioners (GPs) in the intervention group received 3 
training sessions on family conferences, a deprescribing guideline, and a 
toolkit with relevant nonpharmacologic interventions. Three GP-led family 
conferences for shared decision-making involving the participants and family 
caregivers and/or nursing services were subsequently held per patient at home 
over a period of 9 months. Patients in the control group received care as usual.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the number of 
hospitalizations within 12 months, as assessed by nurses during home visits or 
telephone interviews. Secondary outcomes included the number of medications, the 
number of European Union list of the number of potentially inappropriate 
medication (EU[7]-PIM) for older people, and geriatric assessment parameters. 
Both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The baseline assessment included 521 individuals (356 women [68.3%]; 
mean [SD] age, 83.5 [6.17] years). The intention-to-treat analysis with 510 
patients showed no significant difference in the adjusted mean (SD) number of 
hospitalizations between the intervention group (0.98 [1.72]) and the control 
group (0.99 [1.53]). In the per-protocol analysis including 385 individuals, the 
mean (SD) number of medications decreased from 8.98 (3.56) to 8.11 (3.21) at 6 
months and to 8.49 (3.63) at 12 months in the intervention group and from 9.24 
(3.44) to 9.32 (3.59) at 6 months and to 9.16 (3.42) at 12 months in the control 
group, with a statistically significant difference at 6 months in the 
mixed-effect Poisson regression model (P = .001). After 6 months, the mean (SD) 
number of EU(7)-PIMs was significantly lower in the intervention group (1.30 
[1.05]) than in the control group (1.71 [1.25]; P = .04). There was no 
significant difference in the mean number of EU(7)-PIMs after 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cluster randomized clinical trial with older 
adults taking 5 or more medications, the intervention consisting of GP-led 
family conferences did not achieve sustainable effects in reducing the number of 
hospitalizations or the number of medications and EU(7)-PIMs after 12 months.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a multicenter, prospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: This study tests the hypothesis that the elimination of lower limb 
compensation in patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD) will significantly 
increase the magnitude of sagittal malalignment.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: ASD affects a significant proportion of the elderly 
population, impairing functional sagittal alignment and inhibiting the overall 
quality of life. To counteract these effects, patients with ASD use their spine, 
pelvis, and lower limbs to create a compensatory posture that allows for 
standing and mobility. However, the degree to which each of the hips, knees, and 
ankles contributes to these compensatory mechanisms has yet to be determined.
METHODS: Patients undergoing corrective surgery for ASD were included if they 
met at least one of the following criteria: complex surgical procedure, 
geriatric deformity surgery, or severe radiographic deformity. Preoperative 
full-body x-rays were evaluated, and age and pelvic incidence -adjusted 
normative values were used to model spine alignment based upon three positions: 
compensated (all lower extremity compensatory mechanisms maintained), partially 
compensated (removal of ankle dorsiflexion and knee flexion, with maintained hip 
extension), and uncompensated (ankle, knee, and hip compensation set to the age 
and pelvic incidence norms).
RESULTS: A total of 288 patients were included (mean age 60 yr, 70.5% females). 
As the model transitioned from the compensated to uncompensated position, the 
initial posterior translation of the pelvis decreased significantly to an 
anterior translation versus the ankle (P.Shift: 30 to -7.6 mm). This was 
associated with a decrease in pelvic retroversion (pelvic tilt: 24.1-16.1), hip 
extension (SFA: 203-200), knee flexion (knee angle: 5.5-0.4), and ankle 
dorsiflexion (ankle angle: 5.3-3.7). As a result, the anterior malalignment of 
the trunk significantly increased: sagittal vertical axis (65-120 mm) and G-SVA 
(C7-ankle from 36 to 127 mm).
CONCLUSIONS: Removal of lower limbs compensation revealed an unsustainable 
truncal malalignment with two-fold greater SVA.

OBJECTIVES: This study carried out a systematic literature review of economic 
evaluations of varicella vaccination programmes from the earliest publication to 
the present day, including programmes in the workplace and in special risk 
groups as well as universal childhood vaccination and catch up programmes.
METHODS: Articles published from 1985 until 2022 were sourced from 
PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, NHSEED and Econlit. Eligible economic 
evaluations, which included posters and conference abstracts, were identified by 
two reviewers who scrutinised each other's selections at both title and abstract 
and full report stages. The studies are described in terms of their 
methodological characteristics. Their results are aggregated by type of 
vaccination programme and the nature of the economic outcome.
RESULTS: A total of 2575 articles were identified of which 79 qualified as 
economic evaluations. A total of 55 studies focused on universal childhood 
vaccination, 10 on the workplace and 14 on high risk groups. Twenty-seven 
studies reported estimates of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained, 16 reported benefit-cost ratios, 20 reported cost-effectiveness 
outcomes in terms of incremental cost per event or life saved and 16 reported 
cost-cost offset results. Most studies of universal childhood vaccination 
reported an increase in overall costs to health services, but often a reduction 
in cost from a societal perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence surrounding the cost-effectiveness of varicella 
vaccination programmes remains sparse with contrasting conclusions in some 
areas. Future research should particularly aim to encompass the impact of 
universal childhood vaccination programmes on herpes zoster among adults.

Combination therapy of zoledronic acid (ZOL) plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) was 
found to reduce bone metastasis risk and improve overall survival for 
treatment-naïve postmenopausal women (PMW) with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) 
early breast cancer (EBC), when compared with AI alone. The objective of this 
study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding ZOL to AI in treating PMW 
with HR+ EBC in China. A 5-state Markov model was constructed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of adding ZOL to AI for PMW-EBC (HR+) over a lifetime horizon 
from the perspective of Chinese healthcare provider. Data used were obtained 
from previous reports and public data. The primary outcomes of this study were 
direct medical cost, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the presented 
model. Over a lifetime horizon, adding ZOL to AI was projected to yield a gain 
of 1.286 LYs and 1.099 QALYs compared with AI monotherapy, which yielded ICER 
$11 140.75 per QALY with an incremental cost of $12 247.36. The one-way 
sensitivity analysis indicated that the cost of ZOL was the most influential 
factor in our study. The probability that adding ZOL to AI was cost-effective at 
a threshold of $30 425 per QALY in China was 91.1%. ZOL is likely to be 
cost-effective in reducing bone metastasis risk and improving overall survival 
for PMW-EBC (HR+) in China.

This study focuses on the concepts of subjective age and subjective 
nearness-to-death (views-of-aging) and examines the association between 
individuals' chronological age, self, and others' perceptions of these variables 
and mental health. A total of 267 participants aged 40-95 M = 64.33 provided 
sociodemographic information and filled out scales assessing self and others' 
views-of-aging, depressive symptoms, and their well-being. After controlling for 
covariates, age was not related to the dependent variables, whereas young/far 
from death self, and perceived others' views-of-aging was related to better 
mental health. The interaction between young age and young/far from death 
perceived others', but not self, views-of-aging was associated with lower 
depressive symptoms and higher well-being. Finally, the interaction between 
young/far from death self and perceived others' views-of-aging was associated 
with lower depressive symptoms but not with well-being. These findings provide 
an initial glance at the complex relations between two types of personal 
views-of-aging and emphasize the importance of how individuals appraise others' 
perceptions of their own aging process and life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Major psychiatric disorders are associated with lower life 
expectancy primarily due to comorbid illnesses and suboptimal access to health 
care. Large-scale contemporary data in the United States on in-hospital 
mortality of patients with major psychiatric disorder and sepsis are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the short-term outcomes of hospitalized patients with 
major psychiatric disorders and septic shock.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient 
Sample database from 2016 to 2019 to identify septic shock hospitalizations in 
patients with versus without major psychiatric disorder (defined as 
schizophrenia and affective disorders). Baseline variables and in-hospital 
mortality trends were compared between the 2 groups.
RESULTS: Out of 1,653,255 hospitalizations with septic shock identified between 
2016 and 2019, 16.2% had a diagnosis of major psychiatric disorder as defined 
above. After adjusting for various patient-level and hospital-level demographics 
and coexisting clinical conditions in a multivariable logistic regression, the 
odds of in-hospital mortality in patients with any major psychiatric disorder 
were 0.71 times that of those without a diagnosis of psychiatric illness (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.73; P < 0.001). Similarly, when the disorders 
were divided into 2 categories for subanalysis, those with schizophrenia had 38% 
lower odds of dying compared to those without schizophrenia (adjusted odds 
ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.58-0.66; P < 0.001). Those with affective disorders had 
25% lower odds of in-hospital mortality than those without a diagnosis of an 
affective disorder (adjusted odds ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.73-0.77; P < 0.001). 
The adjusted mean length of stay for those diagnosed with major psychiatric 
disorder was 0.38 days longer than those without significant psychiatric illness 
(95% CI, 0.28-0.49; P < 0.001). On the other hand, the mean hospitalization 
charges were $10,516 less for patients with a major psychiatric disorder 
compared to those without (95% CI, -$11,830 to -$9,201; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with major psychiatric disorder and septic 
shock had lower risk of short-term mortality. Further studies are needed to 
examine the reasons behind this lower in-hospital mortality risk.

The sharp decrease in the cost of RNA-sequencing and the rapid improvement in 
computational analysis of eco-toxicogenomic data have brought new insights into 
the adverse effects of chemicals on aquatic organisms. Yet, transcriptomics is 
generally applied qualitatively in environmental risk assessments, hampering 
more effective exploitation of this evidence through multidisciplinary studies. 
In view of this limitation, a methodology is here presented to quantitatively 
elaborate transcriptional data in support to environmental risk assessment. The 
proposed methodology makes use of results from the application of Gene Set 
Enrichment Analysis to recent studies investigating the response of Mytilus 
galloprovincialis and Ruditapes philippinarum exposed to contaminants of 
emerging concern. The degree of changes in gene sets and the relevance of 
physiological reactions are integrated in the calculation of a hazard index. The 
outcome is then classified according to five hazard classes (from absent to 
severe), providing an evaluation of whole-transcriptome effects of chemical 
exposure. The application to experimental and simulated datasets proved that the 
method can effectively discriminate different levels of altered transcriptomic 
responses when compared to expert judgement (Spearman correlation coefficient of 
0.96). A further application to data collected in two independent studies of 
Salmo trutta and Xenopus tropicalis exposed to contaminants confirmed the 
potential extension of the methodology to other aquatic species. This 
methodology can serve as a proof of concept for the integration of "genomic 
tools" in environmental risk assessment based on multidisciplinary 
investigations. To this end, the proposed transcriptomic hazard index can now be 
incorporated into quantitative Weight of Evidence approaches and weighed, with 
results from other types of analysis, to elucidate the role of chemicals in 
adverse ecological effects.

OBJECTIVE: Rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and 
prednisone, once every 3 weeks (R-CHOP21) is commonly used in non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma (NHL), but accompanied by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) as a 
fatal treatment complication. This study aims to estimate the specific 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PCP prophylaxis in NHL undergoing 
R-CHOP21.
DESIGN: A two-part decision analytical model was developed. Prevention effects 
were determined by systemic review of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web 
of Science from inception to December 2022. Studies reporting results of PCP 
prophylaxis were included. Enrolled studies were quality assessed with 
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Costs were derived from the Chinese official websites, 
and clinical outcomes and utilities were obtained from published literature. 
Uncertainty was evaluated through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses (DSA and PSA). Willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set as US$31 
315.23/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) (threefold the 2021 per capita Chinese 
gross domestic product).
SETTING: Chinese healthcare system perspective.
PARTICIPANTS: NHL receiving R-CHOP21.
INTERVENTIONS: PCP prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevention effects were pooled as relative risk (RR) with 
95% CI. QALYs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of four retrospective cohort studies with 1796 participants 
were included. PCP risk was inversely associated with prophylaxis in NHL 
receiving R-CHOP21 (RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.67; p=0.01). Compared with no 
prophylaxis, PCP prophylaxis would incur an additional cost of US$527.61, and 
0.57 QALYs gained, which yielded an ICER of US$929.25/QALY. DSA indicated that 
model results were most sensitive to the risk of PCP and preventive 
effectiveness. In PSA, the probability that prophylaxis was cost-effective at 
the WTP threshold was 100%.
CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis for PCP in NHL receiving R-CHOP21 is highly effective 
from retrospective studies, and routine chemoprophylaxis against PCP is 
overwhelmingly cost-effective from Chinese healthcare system perspective. Large 
sample size and prospective controlled studies are warranted.

OBJECTIVE: Older male and female adults differ in key characteristics such as 
disease-specific life expectancy, health behaviours and clinical presentations 
and non-communicable disease multimorbidity (NCD-MM). Therefore, examining the 
sex differences in NCD-MM among older adults is vital, as this issue is 
understudied in low-income and middle-income country (LMIC) contexts such as 
India, and has been growing in the past few decades.
DESIGN: Large scale nationally representative cross-sectional study.
SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI 2017-2018) 
had data on 27 343 men and 31 730 women aged 45+, drawn from a sample of 59 073 
individuals across India.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: We operationalised NCD-MM based on 
prevalence of the presence of two or more long-term chronic NCD morbidities. 
Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis along with multivariate statistics 
were used.
RESULTS: Women aged 75+ had a higher prevalence of multimorbidity as compared 
with men (52.1% vs 45.17%). NCD-MM was more common among widows (48.5%) than 
widowers (44.8%). The female-to-male ratios of ORs (RORs) for NCD-MM associated 
with overweight/obesity and prior history of chewing tobacco were 1.10 (95% CI: 
1.01 to 1.20) and 1.42 (95% CI: 1.12 to 1.80), respectively. The female-to-male 
RORs show that the odds of NCD-MM were greater in formerly working women (1.24 
(95% CI: 1.06 to 1.44)) relative to formerly working men. The effect of 
increasing NCD-MM on limitations in activities of daily living and instrumental 
ADL was greater in men than women but reversed for the hospitalisation.
CONCLUSIONS: We found significant sex differences in NCD-MM prevalence among 
older Indian adults, with various associated risk factors. The patterns 
underlying these differences warrant greater study, given existing evidence on 
differential longevity, health burdens and health-seeking patterns all of which 
operate in a larger structural context of patriarchy. Health systems in turn 
must respond to NCD-MM mindful of these patterns and aim to redress some of the 
larger inequities they reflect.

Policy, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The short-form 6-dimension (SF-6D) is a preference-based measure 
designed to calculate quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Preference-based 
measures are standardized multidimensional health state classifications with 
preference or utility weights elicited from a sample of the population. There is 
a concern that valuations may differ between countries because of differences in 
culture, thus invalidating the use of values obtained from one country to 
another.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of elicitation methods and modeling 
strategies in SF-6D studies and to present a general comparison of dimensions' 
ordering among different countries.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of studies that developed value sets 
for the SF-6D. The data search was conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Embase, 
and Scopus up to 8 September 2022. Quality of studies was assessed with the 
CREATE checklist. Methodological differences were identified, and the 
dimensions' ordering of the selected studies was analyzed by cultural and 
economic factors.
RESULTS: From a total of 1369 entries, 31 articles were selected. This 
corresponded to 12 different countries and regions and 17 different surveys. 
Most studies used the standard gamble method to elicit health state preferences. 
Anglo-Saxon countries gave more importance to pain, while other countries have 
physical functioning as the highest dimension. As the economic level increases, 
people care less about physical functioning but more about pain and mental 
health.
CONCLUSIONS: Value sets for the SF-6D are different from one country to another 
and there is a need to develop value sets for more countries to consider 
cultural and economic differences.

BACKGROUND: In Chicago in 2018, the average life expectancy (ALE) for NH Blacks 
was 71.5 years, 9.1 fewer years than for NH Whites (80.6 years). Inasmuch as 
some causes of death are increasingly recognized products of structural racism, 
in urban areas, such causes may have potential for reducing racial inequities 
through public health intervention. Our purpose is to allocate racial inequities 
in ALE in Chicago to differentials in cause-specific mortality.
METHODS: Using multiple decrement processes and decomposition analysis, we 
examine cause-specific mortality in Chicago to determine the causes of death 
that contribute to the gap in life expectancy between NH Blacks and NH Whites.
RESULTS: Among females, the racial difference in ALE was 8.21 years; for males, 
it was 10.53 years. We find that cancer and heart disease mortality account for 
3.03 years or 36% of the racial gap in average life expectancy among females. 
Differences in homicide and heart disease mortality rates comprised over 45% of 
the disparity among males.
CONCLUSIONS: Strategies for improving inequities in life expectancy should
