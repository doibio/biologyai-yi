most characteristic features of information processing in human cognition. CP is 
considered as the result of the integration of the top-down processing including 
background knowledge and verbal labeling and the bottom-up processing such as 
physical characteristics of the sensory signal. However, the underlying 
mechanisms governing the integration remain unclear. To address this issue, we 
focused on the temporal characteristics of CP of facial expression. In the 
current study, we investigated the contributions of temporal factors in CP 
processes, using facial expression recognition tasks as an example of CP. 
Participants completed an identification task and a discrimination task, 
well-established tasks for evaluating CP of facial expressions, with variable 
temporal parameters, that is, duration of stimulus presentation and delay time 
(interval between stimulus and response). The results demonstrated that the 
emotionally ambiguous stimuli are categorized more distinctively with the 
extension of delay length, not of stimulus duration. In contrast, the category 
boundary for facial expressions shifted toward "happy" with extention in 
stimulus duration, not in delay length. This dissociation between the impact of 
stimulus duration and delay suggests that there are two processes contributing 
to CP of facial emotion; one process may reflect the internal processing 
associated with the length of the delay period including verbal labeling of the 
stimuli, and the other process may reflect the temporal summation of stimulus 
inputs, associated with stimulus duration. These findings suggest that paying 
more attention to temporal factors in CP could be useful for further study of 
the mechanisms underlying CP.

A number of anterior reconstruction options are available in patients managed 
for symptomatic metastatic spinal column disease. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) 
has been traditionally used as a reconstruction option in patients with limited 
life expectancy as an anterior fusion is not expected. In this article, we 
present the outcome of a 13-year follow-up of a long anterior reconstruction 
using PMMA of the upper thoracic spine in a myelopathic female secondary to a 
compressive breast metastasis affecting the upper 4 thoracic vertebrae. We 
discuss the use of PMMA in spinal oncological surgery and review the evidence 
pertinent to its use.

White pine blister rust (WPBR, Cronartium ribicola) is a fungal pathogen and a 
threat to whitebark pines (Pinus albicaulis). It has a complex life cycle that 
requires two hosts, a white pine and an alternate host, typically a currant or 
gooseberry (Ribes spp.). WPBR is transmitted between hosts by means of two types 
of airborne spores whose average dispersal distances differ by several orders of 
magnitude. In this paper, we introduce a discrete-time model based on the life 
cycle of WPBR. We then extend this model to include a continuous spatial domain, 
disease-induced mortality in the pines, and a latency period. After each 
extension, we find the pathogen's asymptotic speed of invasion analytically 
using exponential transforms and the method of steepest descent. Our results 
show that invasion speeds are strongly reduced by the latency period in the pine 
host. In addition, these speeds are highly dependent on the carrying capacity 
and infectiousness of each host type. If these parameters are sufficiently 
small, high mortality in pines may stop the spread of WPBR completely.

Physician estimates of patients' survival times have historically been 
inaccurate. In particular, physicians have often been overly optimistic in their 
predictions. Our review begins by documenting some of the literature addressing 
these concerns and proceeds to a discussion of prognostic models that have been 
created to aid physicians in providing more accurate estimates. We then discuss 
new findings showing survival to be influenced by particular treatment factors. 
Given such findings, currently existing prognostic models are now incomplete. 
However, with the abundance of evidence-based treatment options in a wide 
variety of patient populations, we propose that radiation oncologists need no 
longer rely so heavily on the precise prognostic capacity of survival models. 
Patients of different age demographics and survival prognoses benefit from 
palliative radiation treatment. More specifically, our report documents studies 
which show that for uncomplicated bone metastases, a single 8 Gy fraction of 
radiation is an equally effective tool for palliation regardless of whether a 
patient will have a short or long duration of survival. In addition we discuss 
evidence-based treatment options for patients with complicated bone metastases, 
lung and brain metastases. Further research is required to incorporate treatment 
factors in future survival prediction models.

BACKGROUND: To judge whether an intervention offers value for money, the 
incremental costs per gained quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) need to be 
compared with some relevant threshold, which ideally reflects the monetary value 
of health gains. Literature suggests that this value may depend on the equity 
context in which health gains are produced, but the value of a QALY in relation 
to equity considerations has remained largely unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the social marginal 
willingness to pay (MWTP) for QALY gains in different equity subgroups, using a 
discrete choice experiment (DCE). Both severity of illness (operationalized as 
proportional shortfall) and fair innings (operationalized as age) were 
considered as grounds for differentiating the value of health gains.
METHODS: We obtained a sample of 1205 respondents, representative of the adult 
population of the Netherlands. The data was analysed using panel mixed 
multinomial logit (MMNL) and latent class models.
RESULTS: The panel MMNL models showed counterintuitive results, with more severe 
health states reducing the probability of receiving treatment. The latent class 
models revealed distinct preference patterns in the data. MWTP per QALY was 
sensitive to severity of disease among a substantial proportion of the public, 
but not to the age of care recipients.
CONCLUSION: These findings emphasize the importance of accounting for preference 
heterogeneity among the public on value-laden issues such as prioritizing health 
care, both in research and decision making. This study emphasises the need to 
further explore the monetary value of a QALY in relation to equity 
considerations.

Hierarchical regression for analyses of multiple outcomes.

Richardson DB, Hamra GB, MacLehose RF, Cole SR, Chu H.

In cohort mortality studies, there often is interest in associations between an 
exposure of primary interest and mortality due to a range of different causes. A 
standard approach to such analyses involves fitting a separate regression model 
for each type of outcome. However, the statistical precision of some estimated 
associations may be poor because of sparse data. In this paper, we describe a 
hierarchical regression model for estimation of parameters describing 
outcome-specific relative rate functions and associated credible intervals. The 
proposed model uses background stratification to provide flexible control for 
the outcome-specific associations of potential confounders, and it employs a 
hierarchical "shrinkage" approach to stabilize estimates of an exposure's 
associations with mortality due to different causes of death. The approach is 
illustrated in analyses of cancer mortality in 2 cohorts: a cohort of 
dioxin-exposed US chemical workers and a cohort of radiation-exposed Japanese 
atomic bomb survivors. Compared with standard regression estimates of 
associations, hierarchical regression yielded estimates with improved precision 
that tended to have less extreme values. The hierarchical regression approach 
also allowed the fitting of models with effect-measure modification. The 
proposed hierarchical approach can yield estimates of association that are more 
precise than conventional estimates when one wishes to estimate associations 
with multiple outcomes.

Cancer serum biomarkers based on aberrant post-translational modifications of 
glycoproteins: Clinical value and discovery strategies.

Due to the increase in life expectancy in the last decades, as well as changes 
in lifestyle, cancer has become one of the most common diseases both in 
developed and developing countries. Early detection remains the most promising 
approach to improve long-term survival of cancer patients and this may be 
achieved by efficient screening of biomarkers in biological fluids. Great 
efforts have been made to identify specific alterations during oncogenesis. 
Changes at the cellular glycosylation profiles are among such alterations. The 
"glycosylation machinery" of cells is affected by malignant transformation due 
to the altered expression of glycogens, leading to changes in glycan 
biosynthesis and diversity. Alterations in the post-translational modifications 
of proteins that occur in cancer result in the expression of antigenically 
distinct glycoproteins. Therefore, these aberrant and cancer-specific 
glycoproteins and the autoantibodies that are produced in response to their 
presence constitute targets for cancer biomarkers' search. Different strategies 
have been implemented for the discovery of cancer glycobiomarkers and are herein 
reviewed, along with their potentialities and limitations. Practical issues 
related with serum analysis are also addressed, as well as the challenges that 
this area faces in the near future.

PURPOSE: This study compared single-fraction to multi-fraction short-course 
radiation therapy (RT) for symptomatic metastatic epidural spinal cord 
compression (MESCC) in patients with limited survival prognosis.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 121 patients who received 8 Gy Ã 1 fraction 
were matched (1:1) to 121 patients treated with 4 Gy Ã 5 fractions for 10 
factors including age, sex, performance status, primary tumor type, number of 
involved vertebrae, other bone metastases, visceral metastases, interval between 
tumor diagnosis and MESCC, pre-RT ambulatory status, and time developing motor 
deficits prior to RT. Endpoints included in-field repeated RT (reRT) for MESCC, 
overall survival (OS), and impact of RT on motor function. Univariate analyses 
were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test for in-field reRT 
for MESCC and OS and with the ordered-logit model for effect of RT on motor 
function.
RESULTS: Doses of 8 Gy Ã 1 fraction and 4 Gy Ã 5 fractions were not 
significantly different with respect to the need for in-field reRT for MESCC 
(P=.11) at 6 months (18% vs 9%, respectively) and 12 months (30% vs 22%, 
respectively). The RT regimen also had no significant impact on OS (P=.65) and 
post-RT motor function (P=.21). OS rates at 6 and 12 months were 24% and 9%, 
respectively, after 8 Gy Ã 1 fraction versus 25% and 13%, respectively, after 4 
Gy Ã 5 fractions. Improvement of motor function was observed in 17% of patients 
after 8 Gy Ã 1 fraction and 23% after 4 Gy Ã 5 fractions, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences with respect to need for 
in-field reRT for MESCC, OS, and motor function by dose fractionation regimen. 
Thus, 8 Gy Ã 1 fraction may be a reasonable option for patients with survival 
prognosis of a few months.

We report the long-term morbidity and mortality of 105 pediatric patients who 
developed chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). According to the consensus 
criteria of the National Institutes of Health, the global severity of cGVHD was 
mild in 26 patients (25%), moderate in 30 patients (29%), and severe in 49 
patients (47%). Patients with severe cGVHD had a significantly lower cumulative 
incidence of cGVHD remission and higher probability of continuing cGVHD at 
8Â years from cGVHD diagnosis compared with those with mild or moderate cGVHD. 
The 10-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality in severe cGVHD 
patients was significantly higher and the probability of disease-free survival 
was significantly lower than those among patients with mild and moderate cGVHD. 
Of the 59 patients who survived for more than 5Â years, 20 (34%) (4 with moderate 
and 16 with severe cGVHD) had persistent functional impairment caused by cGVHD 
with a Karnofsky/Lansky performance score of 90% in 3 patients, 80% in 4 
patients, and below 70% in 13 patients at the time of relapse, death, or last 
follow-up. Better therapeutic strategies are needed to lower the incidence of 
severe cGVHD, considering the longer life expectancy of pediatric HSCT 
survivors.

Diseases Burden of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Attributable to 
Ground-Level Ozone in Thailand: Estimates Based on Surface Monitoring 
Measurements Data.

BACKGROUND: Ambient ozone (O3) pollution has increased globally since 
preindustrial times. At present, O3 is one of the major air pollution concerns 
in Thailand, and is associated with health impacts such as chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of our study is to estimate the burden 
of disease attributed to O3 in 2009 in Thailand based on empirical evidence.
METHODS: We estimated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to O3 
using the comparative risk assessment framework in the Global Burden of Diseases 
(GBD) study. We quantified the population attributable fraction (PAF), 
integrated from Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based spatial 
interpolation, the population distribution of exposure, and the 
exposure-response coefficient to spatially characterize exposure to ambient O3 
pollution on a national scale. Exposure distribution was derived from GIS-based 
spatial interpolation O3 exposure model using Pollution Control Department 
Thailand (PCD) surface air pollution monitor network sources. Relative risk (RR) 
and population attributable fraction (PAF) were determined using health impact 
function estimates for O3.
RESULT: PAF (%) of COPD attributable to O3 were determined by region: at 
approximately, Northern=2.1, Northeastern=7.1, Central=9.6, Eastern=1.75, 
Western=1.47 and Southern=1.74. The total COPD burden attributable to O3 for 
Thailand in 2009 was 61,577 DALYs. Approximately 0.6% of the total DALYs in 
Thailand is male: 48,480 DALYs; and female: 13,097 DALYs.
CONCLUSION: This study provides the first empirical evidence on the health 
burden (DALYs) attributable to O3 pollution in Thailand. Varying across regions, 
the disease burden attributable to O3 was 0.6% of the total national burden in 
2009. Better empirical data on local specific sites, e.g. urban and rural areas, 
alternative exposure assessment, e.g. land use regression (LUR), and a local 
concentration-response coefficient are required for future studies in Thailand.

Intramedullary spinal cord metastases: an increasingly common diagnosis.

Germany.

OBJECT Intramedullary spinal cord metastases (ISCM) represent a small proportion 
of intramedullary tumors. However, with the lifespans of patients with malignant 
tumors increasing, incidents of ISCM are on the rise. Due to threateningly 
severe disabilities in patients, accompanied by limited life expectancy, every 
attempt should be made to treat these tumors the same way as metastases 
elsewhere in the CNS, with the goal of complete removal of the ISCM and 
preservation of neurological functions. The object of this study is to 
retrospectively analyze the experiences of 22 patients who were surgically 
treated for ISCM over a 22-year period. METHODS Hospital charts of 22 patients, 
who were surgically treated for ISCM between 1992 and 2014, were reviewed 
retrospectively. Demographic data, histopathological diagnoses of primary 
cancer, chronological sequence of the disease, and neurological status using the 
simplified McCormick functional classification were collected and reanalyzed. 
RESULTS The most frequent histology was metastasis of lung cancer, followed by 
brain and breast cancers. The time span from primary cancer diagnosis to the 
development of symptomatic spinal metastases ranged from 0 to 285 months, with a 
mean interval of 38 months. The leading presenting sign was dysesthesia (77% of 
the population), followed by paresis (68%). Only 5 patients (23%) showed urinary 
retention. Initial performance status represented by the McCormick Scale was on 
average 2.47. Total or near-total removal was achieved in 87% of cases. Compared 
with the clinical status 1-2 days after surgery, there was an improvement in the 
McCormick Scale grade at the last follow-up from 2.47 to 2.12 (p = 0.009). 
Likewise, an improvement was detected when comparing the preoperative status 
with the last follow-up (from 2.45 to 2.12; p = 0.029). The mean survival time 
after surgery was 11.6 months. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that surgery 
for intramedullary metastases-with all of the challenges of a rare and 
potentially risky procedure-can be beneficial to patients with advanced stages 
of cancer. Surgery can be performed with minimal new morbidity and results in 
maintaining neurological performance status.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy in sickle cell disease (SCD) has resulted 
in greater recognition of the consequences of repeated intravascular 
vaso-occlusion and chronic haemolysis to multiple organ systems.
AIM: To report the long-term consequences of liver dysfunction in SCD.
METHODS: A cohort of SCD patients was prospectively evaluated at the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. The association of mortality with 
liver enzymes, parameters of liver synthetic function and iron overload was 
evaluated using Cox regression.
RESULTS: Exactly, 247 SCD patients were followed up for 30 months of whom 22 
(9%) died. After controlling for predictors, increased direct bilirubin (DB), 
ferritin, alkaline phosphatase and decreased albumin were independently 
associated with mortality. In a multivariable model, only high DB and ferritin 
remained significant. Ferritin correlated with hepatic iron content and total 
blood transfusions but not haemolysis markers. Forty patients underwent liver 
biopsies and 11 (28%) had fibrosis. Twelve of 26 patients (48%) had portal 
hypertension by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements. All 
patients with advanced liver fibrosis had iron overload; however, most patients 
(69%) with iron overload were without significant hepatic fibrosis. Ferritin did 
not correlate with left ventricular dysfunction by echocardiography. DB 
correlated with bile acid levels suggesting liver pathology. Platelet count and 
soluble CD14 correlated with HVPG indicating portal hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: Ferritin and direct bilirubin are independently associated with 
mortality in sickle cell disease. Ferritin likely relates to transfusional iron 
overload, while direct bilirubin suggests impairment of hepatic function, 
possibly impairing patients' ability to tolerate systemic insults.

Metastasis fingers (acral metastasis) are finding a poor prognosis. Past medical 
history should be questioned and metastasis from primary tumor should be kept in 
mind in patients with pain, swelling, and hyperemia in fingers. Successful 
surgical treatment on acral metastasis does not extend the life expectancy; 
however, it reduces the patient's pain during his terminal period, saves the 
functions of the limb, and increases life comfort.

Naturalization of central European plants in North America: species traits, 
habitats, propagule pressure, residence time.

The factors that promote invasive behavior in introduced plant species occur 
across many scales of biological and ecological organization. Factors that act 
at relatively small scales, for example, the evolution of biological traits 
associated with invasiveness, scale up to shape species distributions among 
different climates and habitats, as well as other characteristics linked to 
invasion, such as attractiveness for cultivation (and by extension propagule 
pressure). To identify drivers of invasion it is therefore necessary to 
disentangle the contribution of multiple factors that are interdependent. To 
this end, we formulated a conceptual model describing the process of invasion of 
central European species into North America based on a sequence of "drivers." We 
then used confirmatory path analysis to test whether the conceptual model is 
supported by a statistical model inferred from a comprehensive database 
containing 466 species. The path analysis revealed that naturalization of 
central European plants in North America, in terms of the number of North 
American regions invaded, most strongly depends on residence time in the invaded 
range and the number of habitats occupied by species in their native range. In 
addition to the confirmatory path analysis, we identified the effects of various 
biological traits on several important drivers of the conceptualized invasion 
process. The data supported a model that included indirect effects of biological 
traits on invasion via their effect on the number of native range habitats 
occupied and cultivation in the native range. For example, persistent seed banks 
and longer flowering periods are positively correlated with number of native 
habitats, while a stress-tolerant life strategy is negatively correlated with 
native range cultivation. However, the importance of the biological traits is 
nearly an order of magnitude less than that of the larger scale drivers and 
highly dependent on the invasion stage (traits were associated only with native 
range drivers). This suggests that future research should explicitly link 
biological traits to the different stages of invasion, and that a failure to 
consider residence time or characteristics of the native range may seriously 
overestimate the role of biological traits, which, in turn, may result in 
spurious predictions of plant invasiveness.

In the modern medical era, more diverse and effective treatment options have 
translated to increased life expectancy. With this increased life span comes 
increased age-associated disease and the dire need to understand underlying 
causes so that therapies can be designed to mitigate the burden to health and 
the economy. Aging exacts a seemingly inevitable multisystem deterioration of 
function that acts as a risk factor for a variety of age-related disorders, 
including those that devastate organs of limited regenerative potential, such as 
the brain. Rather than studying the brain and mechanisms that govern its aging 
in isolation from other organ systems, an emerging approach is to understand the 
relatively unappreciated communication that exists between the brain and 
systemic environment. Revisiting classical methods of experimental physiology in 
animal models has uncovered surprising regenerative activity in young blood with 
translational implications for the aging liver, muscle, brain, and other organs. 
Soluble factors present in young or aged blood are sufficient to improve or 
impair cognitive function, respectively, suggesting an aging continuum of 
brain-relevant systemic factors. The age-associated plasma chemokine CCL11 has 
been shown to impair young brain function while GDF11 has been reported to 
increase the generation of neurons in aged mice. However, the identities of 
specific factors mediating memory-enhancing effects of young blood and their 
mechanisms of action are enigmatic. Here we review brain rejuvenation studies in 
the broader context of systemic rejuvenation research. We discuss putative 
mechanisms for blood-borne brain rejuvenation and suggest promising avenues for 
future research and development of therapies.

Priority Setting, Cost-Effectiveness, and the Affordable Care Act.

Persad G.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) may be the most important health law statute in 
American history, yet much of the most prominent legal scholarship examining it 
has focused on the merits of the court challenges it has faced rather than 
delving into the details of its priority-setting provisions. In addition to 
providing an overview of the ACA's provisions concerning priority setting and 
their developing interpretations, this Article attempts to defend three 
substantive propositions. First, I argue that the ACA is neither uniformly 
hostile nor uniformly friendly to efforts to set priorities in ways that promote 
cost and quality. Second, I argue that the ACA does not take a single, unified 
approach to priority setting; rather, its guidance varies depending on the 
aspect of the healthcare system at issue (Patient Centered Outcomes Research 
Institute, Medicare, essential health benefits) and the factors being excluded 
from priority setting (age, disability, life expectancy). Third, I argue that 
cost-effectiveness can be achieved within the ACA's constraints, but that doing 
so will require adopting new approaches to cost-effectiveness and priority 
setting. By limiting the use of standard cost-effectiveness analysis, the ACA 
makes the need for workable rivals to cost-effectiveness analysis a pressing 
practical concern rather than a mere theoretical worry.

BACKGROUND: Bleeding negatively impacts quality of life in patients with 
unresectable advanced gastric cancer and has the potential to be lethal. When 
blood transfusion and endoscopic hemostasis are unsuccessful to stop bleeding, 
radiation to stomach is selected in patients with unsuitable condition for 
surgery. We performed a retrospective cohort study to clarify the utility of 
radiotherapy in treating gastric bleeding, particularly for patients with 
limited life expectancy.
METHODS: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of palliative radiotherapy in 
patients with advanced gastric cancer between January 2007 and December 2012 in 
Aichi Cancer Center Hospital. All patients had gastric bleeding requiring blood 
transfusion. We defined hemostasis as an increase in hemoglobin level to more 
than 7.0 g/dL together with the cessation of melena or hematemesis for at least 
1 week.
RESULTS: During the study period, 313 advanced gastric cancer patients treated 
in our institution. Of these 17 patients received gastric radiotherapy to stop 
bleeding. Two patients were excluded from analysis due to combined treatment of 
intravascular embolization. Eleven out of 15 patients (73 %) had undergone two 
or more previous chemotherapy regimens. Ten patients (67 %) had an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 3 and 14 patients (93 %) were 
in palliative prognostic index group B or C. The median total planned radiation 
dose was 30 Gy in 10 fractions. At a median interval of 2 days after initiation 
of radiotherapy, 11 patients (73 %) achieved hemostasis; rebleeding was observed 
in four patients (36 %). The median hemoglobin level before radiotherapy was 
significantly increased from 6.0 to 9.0 g/dL (p < 0.0001). The median volume of 
red blood cell transfusion was significantly decreased from 1120 to 280 mL (p = 
0.007). The median rebleeding-free survival interval was 27 days, with a median 
overall survival of 63 days. The cause of death was bleeding in 1 patient (7 %) 
and cancer progression without bleeding in 12 patients (80 %). There were no 
severe adverse events attributable to radiotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Palliative radiotherapy for gastric bleeding achieves hemostasis 
within a short time frame. This appears to be a useful treatment option, 
especially for patients with end-stage, unresectable advanced gastric cancer.

BACKGROUND: There is momentum internationally to improve coordination of complex 
care pathways. Robust evaluations of such interventions are scarce. This paper 
evaluates the cost-utility of cancer care coordinators for stage III colon 
cancer patients, who generally require surgery followed by chemotherapy.
METHODS: We compared a hospital-based nurse cancer care coordinator (CCC) with 
'business-as-usual' (no dedicated coordination service) in stage III colon 
cancer patients in New Zealand. A discrete event microsimulation model was 
constructed to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs from a 
health system perspective. We used New Zealand data on colon cancer incidence, 
survival, and mortality as baseline input parameters for the model. We specified 
intervention input parameters using available literature and expert estimates. 
For example, that a CCC would improve the coverage of chemotherapy by 33% 
(ranging from 9 to 65%), reduce the time to surgery by 20% (3 to 48%), reduce 
the time to chemotherapy by 20% (3 to 48%), and reduce patient anxiety 
(reduction in disability weight of 33%, ranging from 0 to 55%).
RESULTS: Much of the direct cost of a nurse CCC was balanced by savings in 
business-as-usual care coordination. Much of the health gain was through 
increased coverage of chemotherapy with a CCC (especially older patients), and 
reduced time to chemotherapy. Compared to 'business-as-usual', the cost per QALY 
of the CCC programme was $NZ 18,900 (â $US 15,600; 95% UI: $NZ 13,400 to 
24,600). By age, the CCC intervention was more cost-effective for colon cancer 
patients < 65 years ($NZ 9,400 per QALY). By ethnicity, the health gains were 
larger for MÄori, but so too were the costs, meaning the cost-effectiveness was 
roughly comparable between ethnic groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Such a nurse-led CCC intervention in New Zealand has acceptable 
cost-effectiveness for stage III colon cancer, meaning it probably merits 
funding. Each CCC programme will differ in its likely health gains and costs, 
making generalisation from this evaluation to other CCC interventions difficult. 
However, this evaluation suggests that CCC interventions that increase coverage 
of, and reduce time to, effective treatments may be cost-effective.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health issue in indigenous 
populations in the Arctic. These diseases have emerged concomitantly with 
profound social changes over the past 60 years. The aim of this study was to 
summarize the literature on CVD risk among Arctic Inuit. Literature on 
prevalence, incidence, and time trends for CVD and its risk factors in Arctic 
Inuit populations was reviewed. Most evidence supports a similar incidence of 
coronary heart disease and a higher incidence of cerebrovascular disease among 
Arctic Inuit than seen in western populations. Factors that may increase CVD 
risk include aging of the population, genetic susceptibility, and a rapid 
increase in obesity, diabetes, and hypertension in parallel with decreasing 
physical activity and deterioration of the lipid profile. In contrast, and of 
great importance, there has been a decrease in smoking and alcohol intake (at 
least documented in Greenland), and contaminant levels are declining. Although 
there have been marked socioeconomic and dietary changes, it remains unsolved 
and to some extent controversial how this may have influenced cardiovascular 
risk among Arctic Inuit. The increase in life expectancy, in combination with 
improved prognosis for patients with manifest CVD, will inevitably lead to a 
large increase in absolute numbers of individuals affected by CVD in Arctic 
Inuit populations, exacerbated by the rise in most CVD risk factors over the 
past decades. For preventive purposes and for health care planning, it is 
crucial to carefully monitor disease incidence and trends in risk factors in 
these vulnerable Arctic populations.

BACKGROUND: The objective of our study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness (CE) 
study of combined everolimus (EVE) and exemestane (EXE) versus the common 
clinical practice in Greece for the treatment of postmenopausal women with 
HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer (BC) progressing on nonsteroidal aromatase 
inhibitors (NSAI). The combinations of bevacizumab (BEV) plus paclitaxel (PACL) 
and BEV plus capecitabine (CAPE) were selected as comparators.
METHOD: A Markov model, consisting of three health states, was used to describe 
disease progression and evaluate the CE of the comparators from a third-party 
payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. Efficacy and safety data as well as 
utility values considered in the model were extracted from the relevant 
randomized Phase III clinical trials and other published studies. Direct medical 
costs referring to the year 2014 were incorporated in the model. A probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for uncertainty and variation in 
the parameters of the model. Primary outcomes were patient survival 
(life-years), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total direct costs and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER).
RESULTS: The discounted quality-adjusted survival of patients treated with EVE 
plus EXE was greater by 0.035 and 0.004 QALYs, compared to BEV plus PACL and BEV 
plus CAPE, respectively. EVE plus EXE was the least costly treatment in terms of 
drug acquisition, administration, and concomitant medications. The total 
lifetime cost per patient was estimated at â¬55,022, â¬67,980, and â¬62,822 for EVE 
plus EXE, BEV plus PACL, and BEV plus CAPE, respectively. The probabilistic 
analysis confirmed the deterministic results.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that EVE plus EXE may be a dominant alternative 
relative to BEV plus PACL and BEV plus CAPE for the treatment of HR+/HER2- 
advanced BC patients failing initial therapy with NSAIs.

Research Institute, Karaj, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Our previous in vivo studies confirmed that ICD-85, as an anticancer 
agent, was able to prevent further growth of breast tumors and expand the life 
expectancy of mice with breast cancer.
METHODS: Blood collection was carried out before, 1, 3, and 6 hours after ICD-85 
injection. Sera were used to determinate the cardio and hepatic enzymes levels, 
including ALT, AST, LDH, CPK, and Ck-MB. Coagulation factors such as PT and PTT 
were also assayed. ECGs of all rabbits were recorded during the experiment.
RESULTS: ECG results showed that the injection of 50 and 100 Âµg/kg ICD-85 into 
healthy rabbits has no significant effect on heart function while the injection 
of 150 to 200 Âµg/kg ICD-85 caused ECG wave changes and mild bradycardia without 
toxic effects on heart. After ICD-85 injection (concentrations below 100 Âµg/kg), 
no significant increase was observed in liver and cardiac enzymes (ALT, AST, 
LDH, CPK, and CK-MB). However, the concentration of 150 Âµg/kg and above caused a 
rise in the enzymes. Comparison of the PT and PTT before and after ICD-85 
injection showed no significant clotting time at any concentrations below 200 
Âµg/kg.
CONCLUSION: Based on the results obtained in the present study as well as our 
previous reports, ICD-85 at concentrations below 100 Âµg/kg seems to have no 
significant effect on the serum enzymes as indicators of hepatotoxicity and 
cardiotoxicity in healthy rabbits. However, to confirm this conclusion, more 
detailed surveys on heart and liver is needed to be carried out.
