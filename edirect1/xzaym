INTRODUCTION: According to the international literature disease burden of 
schizophrenia is substantial, however data from Eastern Central Europe is 
scarce. Our aim was to assess the quality of life and costs of patients with 
schizophrenia in Hungary.
METHODS: A cross sectional questionnaire survey was performed in 3 hospital 
based psychiatry centres involving patients with schizophrenia. Demographics, 
disease severity (Clinical Global Impression, CGI), functional ability (Global 
Assessment of Functioning, GAF) and general health status (EQ-5D) was assessed. 
Health care utilisation and aids were surveyed for the past 12 months. Costing 
was performed from the societal perspective and human capital approach was 
applied.
RESULTS: Altogether 78 patients (female 43.6%) were involved with a mean age of 
44.2 (SD=13.1) years, disease duration was >10 years at 49 (62.8%) cases, 66 
(84.6%) patients were disability pensioners. Distribution between CGI 3-4-5-6 
levels were 12 (16%), 33 (43%), 21 (28%), 10 (13%) patients, respectively, mean 
GAF was 52.6 (SD=13.9). The average EQ-5D score was 0.64 (SD=0.3) and it was 
significantly worse than the age-matched general population's score in Hungary 
(p < 0.01). Mean yearly cost was 13 878 Euros/patient (conversion 1 Euro=280.6 
HUF), the rate of direct medical,direct non-medical and indirect costs was 
28.5%, 5.4% and 66.1%, respectively. Among direct costs hospitalisation and drug 
costs were dominant. Total cost correlates with disease severity (CGI).
CONCLUSION: Schizophrenia leads to notable deterioration in health related 
quality of life and induce high costs to society, mainly due to the productivity 
loss of the patients. Nevertheless disease related costs in Hungary are lower 
than in economically more developed European countries. Our study offers basic 
data about disease burden of schizophrenia in Hungary to support clinical and 
health policy decision making.

It is the lifetime that matters: public preferences over maximising health and 
reducing inequalities in health.

Science, London, UK.

Scarce healthcare resources can be allocated in many ways. The National 
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK focuses on the size of 
the benefit relative to costs, yet we know that there is support among 
clinicians and the general public for reducing inequalities in health. This 
paper shows how the UK general public trade-off these sometimes competing 
objectives, and the data we gather allow us to show the weight given to 
different population groups, for example, 1 extra year of life in full health to 
someone who would otherwise die at the age of 60 years is worth more than twice 
as much as an additional year of life to someone who would otherwise die at the 
age of 70 years. Such data can help inform the rationing decisions faced by all 
healthcare systems around the world.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and it is the 
third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Once diagnosed with the 
disease, only 30-40% of patients are deemed eligible for curative intention with 
treatment modalities including surgical resection, liver transplantation, and 
chemoembolization. Eventually, most patients will receive some forms of 
chemotherapy in hope of prolonging life. Sorafenib is the first molecular 
inhibitor to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced HCC. It is a 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, targeting multiple molecular pathways. Prior to the 
arrival of sorafenib, doxorubicin was routinely used as a single drug for 
advanced HCC, but has shown inefficacy, with a response rate of about 15-20%. 
Other chemotherapy agents, such as epirubicin, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, 
etoposide and their combinations, demonstrate even lower efficacy. While being 
considered an advance over conventional chemotherapy, sorafenib only improves 
life expectancy approximately by 3 months over placebo. With that in mind, 
continuous efforts have been put into finding new targets and molecular pathways 
for possible new drug development. In this article, we summarize the current 
literature over the past year on chemotherapy treatment of advanced HCC.

Impact of chronologic age in the elderly with gastric cancer.

Lee SR(1), Kim HO, Yoo CH.

Author information:

School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

PURPOSE: Although the incidence of gastric cancer has declined in the general 
population, it is the second most frequent cause of death due to malignancy in 
the world with its incidence in the elderly increasing as a result of increased 
life expectancy. This present study tried to find the optimal treatment for 
patients aged 75 years or older with gastric cancer through comparison of the 
clinicopathological characteristics, surgical outcomes, and identifying 
prognostic factors of survival.
METHODS: Elderly patients who underwent gastric resection for gastric cancer 
from January, 1999 to February, 2009 (n = 470) were divided into two groups: 
very elderly patients, 75 years or older (n = 95), and younger elderly patients, 
between 65 and 74 years old (n = 365).
RESULTS: Distinct characteristics of very elderly patients included more 
frequent underlying disease, deeper invasion, and more frequent lymph node 
metastasis. There were significant differences in overall survival between the 
two groups at stages III-B and IV. However, postoperative hospital stays, 
postoperative morbidity, mortality and early stage did not differ between 
curatively resected patients in the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Due to improved postoperative care, gastrectomy of gastric cancer is 
the treatment of choice in very elderly patients. Therefore, early diagnosis 
through regular medical screening and curative gastrectomy with lymph node 
dissection should be performed in very elderly gastric cancer patients.

Economic evaluation of anti-epileptic drug therapies with specific focus on 
teratogenic outcomes.

Jentink J(1), Boersma C, de Jong-van den Berg LT, Postma MJ.

Author information:
(1)University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Anti-epileptic drugs are known to be teratogenic, yet many women do 
need to continue the anti-epileptic drug use during pregnancy.
OBJECTIVES: To perform an economic evaluation of the anti-epileptic drug choice 
in young women who potentially wish to become pregnant. In particular, to 
estimate the impact of teratogenicity on the costs per quality adjusted life 
year (QALY).
METHODS: A decision-tree model is used to calculate the costs per QALY, taking 
into account the malformation risk in offspring due to the exposure to 
carbamazepine, lamotrigine or valproic acid, based on the European birth cohort 
of 2007. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed using Monte Carlo 
simulation.
RESULTS: Valproic acid is dominated by carbamazepine after rank ordering on 
costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness of lamotrigine vs carbamazepine was 
estimated at €175,534 per QALY. Although valproic acid was dominated by 
carbamazepine in terms of costs and related effects, it is clinically relevant 
to compare lamotrigine with valproic acid. In particular, treatment options are 
dependent on several individual and clinical characteristics and these agents 
are therefore not always considered as interchangeable for all specified 
populations. The incremental cost-effectiveness for lamotrigine vs valproic acid 
was estimated at €13,370 per QALY. With assuming a willingness to pay threshold 
of €50,000 per QALY, results from the probabilistic analysis resulted in an 
acceptance level for lamotrigine vs carbamazepine and lamotrigine vs valproic 
acid of 4% and 99%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Based on epidemiological data it is advised to whenever possible 
avoid valproic acid during pregnancy. Both carbamazepine and lamotrigine are 
estimated to be cost-effective treatment options vs valproic acid if focused on 
teratogenicity.

OBJECTIVES: A cost-effectiveness model for rivaroxaban evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis with rivaroxaban (a once-daily, orally 
administered Factor Xa inhibitor) vs enoxaparin in the prevention of venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) after total hip replacement (THR) and total knee 
replacement (TKR). This Canadian analysis was conducted using the Ontario 
Ministry of Health perspective over a 5-year time horizon. The model combined 
clinical data and builds upon existing economic models.
METHODS: The model included both acute VTE (represented as a decision tree) and 
long-term complications (represented as a Markov process with 1-year cycles) 
phases. The model allowed VTE event rates, quality-adjusted life expectancy and 
direct medical costs to be estimated over a 5-year time horizon, based on 
current approved practice patterns in Canada. A number of one-way sensitivity 
analyses were performed on the baseline assumptions, including a comparison of 
rivaroxaban with dalteparin, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed to address any uncertainty concerning model inputs.
RESULTS: When comparing equal durations of therapy, rivaroxaban dominated 
enoxaparin in the prevention of VTE events in patients undergoing THR and TKR, 
providing more benefit at a lower cost. Rivaroxaban was cost-effective when 
comparing 35 days' prophylaxis with 14 days' prophylaxis with enoxaparin 
following THR. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that 
the results of the economic analysis were robust to variations in key inputs. 
Rivaroxaban remained dominant during one-way sensitivity analyses comparing 
rivaroxaban with dalteparin after THR or TKR.
LIMITATIONS: Although clinical trial data were used in the prophylaxis module, 
assumptions and values used in the post-prophylaxis and long-term complication 
(LTC) modules were based on several different literature sources; it was not 
always possible to source Canadian data.
CONCLUSIONS: This economic analysis suggests that the use of rivaroxaban for the 
prophylaxis of VTE after THR or TKR in Canada was cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory failure due to thyroid compression or invasion of 
the tracheal lumen is a surgical emergency requiring urgent management. The aim 
of this paper is to describe a series of six patients treated successfully in 
the emergency setting with total thyroidectomy due to ingravescent dyspnoea and 
asphyxia, as well as review related data reported in literature.
METHODS: During 2005-2010, of 919 patients treated by total thyroidectomy at our 
Academic Hospital, 6 (0.7%; 4 females and 2 men, mean age: 68.7 years, range 
42-81 years) were treated in emergency. All the emergency operations were 
performed for life-threatening respiratory distress. The clinical picture at 
admission, clinical features, type of surgery, outcomes and complications are 
described. Mean duration of surgery was 146 minutes (range: 53-260).
RESULTS: In 3/6 (50%) a manubriotomy was necessary due to the extension of the 
mass into the upper mediastinum. In all cases total thyroidectomy was performed. 
In one case (16.7%) a parathyroid gland transplantation and in another one 
(16.7%) a tracheotomy was necessary due to a condition of tracheomalacia. Mean 
post-operative hospital stay was 6.5 days (range: 2-10 days). Histology revealed 
malignancy in 4/6 cases (66.7%), showing 3 primitive, and 1 secondary tumors. 
Morbidity consisted of 1 transient recurrent laryngeal palsy, 3 transient 
postoperative hypoparathyroidism, and 4 pleural effusions, treated by medical 
therapy in 3 and by drains in one. There was no mortality.
CONCLUSION: On the basis of our experience and of literature review, we strongly 
advocate elective surgery for patients with thyroid disease at the first signs 
of tracheal compression. When an acute airway distress appears, an emergency 
life-threatening total thyroidectomy is recommended in a high-volume centre.

Can cost-effectiveness analysis integrate concerns for equity? Systematic 
review.

Author information:

Canada. mira.johri@umontreal.ca

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to promote approaches to health technology 
assessment (HTA) that are both evidence-based and values-based. We conducted a 
systematic review of published studies describing formal methods to consider 
equity in the context of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA).
METHODS: Candidate studies were identified through an unrestricted search of the 
Pub Med and EMBASE databases. The search closed on January 20, 2011. We 
identified additional studies by consulting experts and checking article 
bibliographies. Two authors independently reviewed each candidate study to 
determine inclusion and extracted data from studies retained for review. In 
addition to documenting methods, data extraction identified implicit and 
explicit notions of fairness. Data were synthesized in narrative form. Study 
quality was not assessed.
RESULTS: Of the 695 candidate articles, 51 were retained for review. We 
identified three broad methods to facilitate quantitative consideration of 
equity concerns in economic evaluation: integration of distributional concerns 
through equity weights and social welfare functions, exploration of the 
opportunity costs of alternative policy options through mathematical 
programming, and multi-criteria decision analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Several viable techniques to integrate equity concerns within CEA 
now exist, ranging from descriptive approaches to the quantitative methods 
studied in this review. Two obstacles at the normative level have impeded their 
use in decision making to date: the multiplicity of concepts and values 
discussed under the rubric of equity, and the lack of a widely accepted 
normative source on which to ground controversial value choices. Clarification 
of equity concepts and attention to procedural fairness may strengthen use of 
these techniques in HTA decision making.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of early vs late reconstruction of iatrogenic bile 
duct injuries.

BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding the optimal timing of repair after 
iatrogenic bile duct injuries (BDI). Several studies advocate late repair (≥6 
weeks after injury) with mandatory drainage and resolution of inflammation. 
Others indicate that early repair (<6 weeks after injury) produces comparable or 
superior clinical outcomes. Additionally, although most studies have reported 
inferior outcomes with primary surgeon repair, this practice continues. With 
disparate published recommendations and rising health care costs, decision 
analysis was used to examine the cost-effectiveness of BDI repair.
STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model was developed to evaluate primary surgeon repair 
(PSR), late repair by a hepatobiliary surgeon (LHBS), and early repair by a 
hepatobiliary surgeon (EHBS). Baseline values and ranges were collected from the 
literature. Sensitivity analsyses were conducted to test the strength of the 
model and variability of parameters.
RESULTS: The model demonstrated that EHBS was associated with lower costs, 
earlier return to normal activity, and better quality of life. Specifically, 1 
year after repair, PSR yielded 0.53 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) 
($120,000/QALY) and LHBS yielded 0.74 QALYs ($74,000/QALY); EHBS yielded 0.82 
QALYs ($48,000/QALY). Sensitivity analyses supported these findings at 
clinically meaningful probabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: This cost-effectiveness model demonstrates that early repair by a 
hepatobiliary surgeon is the superior strategy for the treatment of BDI in 
properly selected patients. Although there is little clinical difference between 
early and late repair, there is a great difference in cost and quality of life. 
Ideally, costs and quality of life should be considered in decisions regarding 
strategies of repair of injured bile ducts.

Minding the gap: changes in life expectancy in the Baltic States compared with 
Finland.

Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 15-17 Tavistock Place, London WC1H 9SH, UK.

BACKGROUND: In the 20 years since the three Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania, have been independent, they have converged progressively with a 
Western neighbours, politically economically and socially. In contrast, the 
health gap has widened.
METHODS: Trends in life expectancy in the three Baltic States were compared with 
Finland and were decomposed by age for the years 1994, 1999, 2004 and 2009 and 
by cause of death for year 2009. 1994 was when life expectancy fell to its 
lowest level since the three countries regained independence.
RESULTS: From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, the gap in life expectancy between 
the three Baltic States and Finland widened, especially for men. It then 
narrowed progressively, except Lithuania where it widened again after 1999. 
Decomposition by age reveals that the narrowing gap has been driven largely by 
reduced mortality at working ages, partly counteracted by a relative failure to 
improve at older ages, especially in Lithuania. Decomposition by cause of death 
identifies diseases of the circulatory system as the largest contributor to the 
gap, with the contribution largest at older ages. However, cancer deaths, 
especially among men, are also important as are deaths from external causes 
among younger men.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the gaps in life expectancy between the Baltic States and 
Finland have reduced, improvements, especially in Latvia and Lithuania, have 
been fragile. There is a clear need to act on the leading causes of the 
persisting gap with Finland, in particular through action on hazardous drinking 
and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Center, 6-11-1, Omori Nishi, Ota-ku, Tokyo 143-8541, Japan.

Background and Aims. For distal malignant biliary obstruction in cases with 
short life expectancy, occlusion of plastic stents (PSs) does not usually occur 
before death, and the application of such a procedure is considered adequate 
from the viewpoint of cost-effectiveness. Methods and Setting. A new 
commercially available DLS with side holes, a conventional DLS, and, uncovered 
self-expanding metal stents (SEMSs) were retrospectively evaluated in patients 
with jaundice due to unresectable distal malignant biliary obstruction. Results. 
A total of 64 patients received endoscopic biliary stenting (23 patients with 
the new DLS, 24 patients with conventional DLS, and 17 patients with uncovered 
SEMS) from December 2002 to August 2009. Median patency time was found to be 198 
days for the new DLS group and 99 days for the conventional DLS group, revealing 
a significant difference between devices. There was, however, no significant 
difference in median patency time between the new DLS and the uncovered SEMS 
(198 days versus 344 days). Conclusion. The new DLS is efficient and safe and 
may be considered the first choice for unresectable distal malignant obstruction 
in cases with short life expectancy.

Week 96 outcomes of patients with less treatment experience versus more 
treatment experience receiving etravirine in the DUET trials.

BACKGROUND: The disease profile of treatment-experienced HIV-1 patients (TEPs) 
looks different today compared with that of 5 years ago. Because less highly 
treated DUET patients may more closely resemble today's TEPs, we conducted a 
post hoc efficacy and safety analysis of the pooled 96-week DUET data stratified 
by level of treatment experience.
METHODS: TEPs with HIV-1 were randomised to etravirine (ETR) 200mg twice daily 
(bid) or placebo bid with a background regimen for 48 weeks (plus optional 
48-week extension). TEPs were categorized using 10 demographic and disease 
characteristics that in prior studies of treatment-experienced subjects had been 
associated with virologic response; patients meeting ≥5 criteria were 
categorized as less TEP.
RESULTS: 183 patients (men, 87.4%) who received ETR were less TEP and 413 
patients (men, 91.0%) were more TEP. At baseline, more TEPs had more advanced 
disease, more previous antiretroviral (ARV) exposures and fewer options for 
active ARVs. At Week 96, for patients receiving ETR, response rates for the less 
TEP group and more TEP group were 68.3% and 52.8%, respectively. Incidence of 
adverse events (AEs) was similar between groups. A greater proportion of 
nonresponders in the more TEP group discontinued due to AEs (9.0% vs 5.5%) and 
virologic failure (18.9% vs 5.5%) compared with the less TEP group.
CONCLUSION: Less TEPs had higher virologic response rates with ETR compared with 
more TEPs. Because the less TEP population from DUET more closely resembles TEPs 
with HIV-1 today, data from this subgroup may provide valuable information for 
real-life treatment decisions.

This paper examines the gender-related features of the health crisis in Russia 
which has produced the largest gender gap in life expectancy in the world. 
Stress and negative health lifestyles are the two most likely causes of the 
long-term adverse longevity pattern in Russia. However, this development cannot 
be clarified by a simple cause and effect explanation. This is because gender 
roles and gender-based normative behaviour, along with class influences, 
intervened to help shape outcomes. Men and women responded to the crisis along 
gender lines, with stress the best single explanation for a stunted longevity 
for females and negative health lifestyles accounting for much of the premature 
mortality among males.

The efficacy of self-expanding metal stents for colorectal obstruction with 
unresectable stage IVB colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acute colorectal obstruction with stage IVB colorectal cancer 
has a poor prognosis and short life expectancy. The effectiveness of 
self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) has been demonstrated in colorectal cancer 
patients with obstruction. However, little is known about the palliative 
efficacy of stent placement inpatients with unresectable colorectal cancer.
METHODOLOGY: The medical records of patients who received SEMS for stage IVB 
colorectal cancer with acute colorectal obstruction between March 2004 and July 
2010 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 24 patients with unresectable 
Stage IVB colorectal cancer with acute colorectal obstruction were enrolled in 
this study.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients received SEMS placement during the study period. 
The mean age of the patients was 63.0 years (range 35-84 years). Fifteen 
patients were male and nine were female. The most common obstructive lesion was 
in the sigmoid colon (70.8%), including the sigmoid-descending and rectosigmoid 
junctions. Un-covered SEMS were used in 62.5% of patients. On the first attempt, 
the technical success rate of SEMS was 95.8%. The estimated duration of primary 
stent patency and overall survival periods after SEMS were 332.0 and 231.8 days, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: SEMS insertion may be a useful therapeutic choice for acute 
colorectal obstruction in patients with unresectable stage IVB colorectal 
cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To review the operative morbidity and the overall length of survival 
following medialization thyroplasty for unilateral vocal cord paralysis (UVCP) 
due to advanced extralaryngeal malignancy.
DESIGN: Retrospective review.
SETTING: Tertiary care laryngology practice.
METHOD: All cases of medialization thyroplasty over a 3-year period were 
reviewed. Only patients who had UVCP due to advanced extralaryngeal malignancy 
were included. Any cases from iatrogenic causes or for any other reason were 
excluded. Survival days were calculated from the date of the thyroplasty.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Survival days postmedialization thyroplasty.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. Two distinct groups 
within this cohort were identified: (1) those suffering from advanced lung 
cancer and (2) those with metastatic cancer of another origin (ie, breast, renal 
cell, esophageal). There were 11 patients in the lung cancer group and 10 in the 
other group. Average survival was 538 days in the lung cancer group and 668 days 
in the other group. The procedure was well tolerated, with only one 
postoperative complication, which was a minor wound infection.
CONCLUSION: For patients suffering from advanced malignancy, medialization 
thyroplasty is a safe procedure and an excellent modality for voice palliation.

INTRODUCTION: With the increase in life expectancy, more and more resectable 
periampullary tumours are being diagnosed in the geriatric population. Despite 
the decrease in post-operative mortality, there continues to be a debate on the 
risk-benefit of cephalic duodenopancreatectomy (CPD) in the elderly.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse the morbidity and mortality of CPD in patients over 70 
years-old.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
PATIENTS: A total of 54 duodenopancreatectomies were performed between January 
2005 and December 2010. Two groups of patients were compared: Group 1 
(patients>70 years-old, n: 24), and Group 2 (patients<70 years-old, n: 30). The 
morbidity and mortality, transfusion, reinterventions, mean hospital stay, and 
survival were analysed.
RESULTS: The>70 years group included more ASA 2 and 3 patients (P=.010), and had 
a higher number of previous medical problems per patient (P=.037). The 
post-operative mortality was higher in the older age group, although the 
difference was not significant (8.3 vs 3.3%). There were also no significant 
differences in post-operative morbidity (45.8 v. 46.6%), reintervention rate 
(16.6 vs 13.3%), length of hospital stay (18 vs 13%), and survival at 6 and 12 
months (84 and 72% vs 90 and 86%).
CONCLUSIONS: Age, in itself, does not seem to be a contraindication for CPD, but 
the elderly do have a higher risk of complications due to the physiological 
changes associated with ageing. The disparity of results demonstrates the need 
for more population studies at national level that may give an overall view of 
morbidity and mortality in CPD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: An important input to decision-making and health 
planning is a consistent and comparative description of the population health 
status. The purpose of this study was to describe the burden of disease in the 
Region of Valencia (Spain).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated and 
divided into years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). 
Using death registry data and Valencian population estimates in 2008, we 
calculated the number of deaths and YLLs. YLDs were based on age- and 
sex-specific data for countries of the EURO-A subregional level (which includes 
the Region of Valencia) from the Global Burden of Disease study. The results 
were stratified by age group, sex and underlying cause of death. The DALY values 
were used to rank the leading conditions of disease burden.
RESULTS: In 2008, the total number of DALYs lost was about 551 thousands (53% in 
men). The main categories of DALYs lost were neuropsychiatric conditions (30%; 
167 thousands), malignant tumors (15%; 85 thousands), cardiovascular diseases 
(13%; 72 thousands) and sense organ diseases (8%; 46 thousands). Depression (8% 
of DALYs; 47 thousands), dementias (8%; 42 thousands), ischaemic heart disease 
(5%; 27 thousands), hearing loss (4%; 22 thousands), stroke (4%; 20 thousands) 
and lung cancer (3%; 19 thousands) were the leading specific causes of disease 
burden.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide for the first time ever information on the burden of 
disease in the Valencian population. At this local level, the use of DALYs can 
help to monitor the population health status and guide the debates on rational 
priority-setting.

Genetics, life span, health span, and the aging process in Caenorhabditis

School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA. heidi.tissenbaum@umassmed.edu

As a tool for measuring the aging process, life span has been invaluable in 
dissecting the genes that modulate longevity. Studies over the past few decades 
have identified several hundred genes that can modify life span in model 
organisms such as yeast, worms, and flies. Yet, despite this vast amount of 
research, we still do not fully understand how the genes that affect life span 
influence how an organism ages. How does modulation of the genes that affect 
life span contribute to the aging process? Does life-span extension result in 
extension of healthy aging? Here, we will focus primarily on the insulin/IGF-1 
signaling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans because members of this pathway have 
been shown to be associated with extended life span across phylogeny, from worms 
to humans. I discuss how this connects to the aging process, age-associated 
disease, and the potential to increase healthy aging in addition to lengthening 
life span.

PURPOSE: Frequent exacerbations which are both costly and potentially 
life-threatening are a major concern to patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), despite the availability of several treatment options. 
This study aimed to assess the lifetime costs and outcomes associated with 
alternative treatment regimens for patients with severe COPD in the UK setting.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to predict lifetime 
costs, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of various combinations of a long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), a long-acting beta agonist (LABA), an inhaled 
corticosteroid (ICS), and roflumilast in a fully incremental analysis. Patients 
willing and able to take ICS, and those refusing or intolerant to ICS were 
analyzed separately. Efficacy was expressed as relative rate ratios of COPD 
exacerbation associated with alternative treatment regimens, taken from a mixed 
treatment comparison. The analysis was conducted from the UK National Health 
Service (NHS) perspective. Parameter uncertainty was explored using one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Based on the results of the fully incremental analysis a 
cost-effectiveness frontier was determined, indicating those treatment regimens 
which represent the most cost-effective use of NHS resources. For ICS-tolerant 
patients the cost-effectiveness frontier suggested LAMA as initial treatment. 
Where patients continue to exacerbate and additional therapy is required, LAMA + 
LABA/ICS can be a cost-effective option, followed by LAMA + LABA/ICS + 
roflumilast (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] versus LAMA + LABA/ICS: 
£16,566 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained). The ICER in 
ICS-intolerant patients, comparing LAMA + LABA + roflumilast versus LAMA + LABA, 
was £13,764/QALY gained. The relative rate ratio of exacerbations was identified 
as the primary driver of cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: The treatment algorithm recommended in UK clinical practice 
represents a cost-effective approach for the management of COPD. The addition of 
roflumilast to the standard of care regimens is a clinical and cost-effective 
treatment option for patients with severe COPD, who continue to exacerbate 
despite existing bronchodilator therapy.

Ethical framework for medication discontinuation in nursing home residents with 
limited life expectancy.

Tjia J(1), Givens J.

Worcester, MA 01605, USA. jennifer.tjia@umassmed.edu

A recent editorial by health economist Victor Fuchs summarized the current 
challenges with health care delivery in this way: “Most physicians want to 
deliver ‘appropriate’ care. Most want to practice ‘ethically’, but it is 
difficult to know what is ‘appropriate’ and what is ‘ethical’. This 
characterization is particularly true for medication use and deprescribing in 
elderly NH residents with limited life expectancy. Medical ethics sets 4 key 
principles (beneficence, nonmaleficence, patient autonomy, and justice) to guide 
practice. However, decisional conflicts will continue between providers and 
patients, and physicians will continue to struggle with the dilemma of balancing 
the primacy of patient welfare, values, and beliefs against the desire for 
promising, but often minimally beneficial and harmful, medications that threaten 
limited clinical resources. Despite these challenges, physicians should be able 
to perform systematic medication reviews and monitor discontinuation trials in 
their NH patients for whom this is consistent with their goals of care.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation for small-cell lung cancer: how, when and for 
whom?

Socha J(1), Kępka L.

Author information:
(1)Regional Oncology Center, Czestochowa, Poland.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) reduces the incidence of brain metastases 
and improves overall survival in both limited disease (LD) and extensive disease 
(ED) small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), in complete and good responders to initial 
chemo(radio)therapy. In LD-SCLC, a standard dose of 25 Gy given in ten fractions 
is recommended, whereas in ED-SCLC a shorter schedule of 20 Gy in five fractions 
could be used. The issues of acute neurotoxicity (NT) and the potential impact 
of PCI on quality of life are of particular concern in ED-SCLC patients, as 
their expected survival is short. In LD-SCLC late neurologic sequelae may worsen 
quality-adjusted life expectancy for long-term survivors, as the pronounced 
effect of NT becomes apparent after several years. Some novel potential 
approaches to reduce the PCI-related late NT have recently been investigated. 
Despite the growing incidence of lung cancer in elderly people, there are no 
established standards of treatment for this subset of the population.

A situs inversus with dextrocardia (DC) is a rare condition in adults. Usually, 
patients have structurally normal hearts and normal life expectancy. The 
incidence of coronary artery disease in this setting is similar to that in the 
general population. Coronary revascularization may present potential 
difficulties related to the unusual anatomy. Although the radial artery is a 
safe and effective site of access for coronary interventions, some anatomical 
variations may make this procedure more complicated. We describe two cases of 
patients with situs viscerum inversus and acute myocardial infarction who 
underwent successful transradial percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We 
will show that coronary angioplasty with stent application via the radial 
approach in patients with DC is feasible and effective also in emergency and 
urgent care.

In people with intellectual disability (ID), impaired sleep is common. Life 
expectancy has increased in this group, and it is known that in general 
population sleep deteriorates with aging. Therefore the aims of this systematic 
review were to examine how sleep problems are defined in research among adults 
and older people with ID, and to collect information on the prevalence, 
associated factors and treatment of sleep problems in this population. PubMed, 
EMBase, PsycINFO and Web of Science were searched for studies published between 
January 1990 and August 2011. All empirical studies covering sleep problems in 
adults with ID were included, and assessed on quality (level of evidence), using 
a slightly modified version of the SIGN-50 methodology checklist for cohort 
studies. Of 50 studies that were included for systematic review, one was of high 
quality, 14 were well conducted, 14 were well conducted but with a high risk of 
bias, and 21 were non-analytical. The reported estimated prevalence rates of 
sleep problems in adults with ID ranged from 8.5% to 34.1%. A prevalence of 9.2% 
was reported for significant sleep problems. Sleep problems were associated with 
the following factors: challenging behavior; respiratory disease; visual 
impairment; psychiatric conditions; and using psychotropic, antiepileptic and/or 
antidepressant medication. Little information was found on older people 
specifically. Two studies reported treatment effects on sleep problems in larger 
populations; their findings suggest that non-pharmaceutical interventions are 
beneficial. Research on the prevalence, associated factors and treatment of 
sleep problems in adults and older people with ID has mainly focused on 
subjectively derived data. The definitions used to describe a sleep problem are 
not uniform, and associations are mainly described as correlations. In order to 
give recommendations for clinical practice further research is needed, involving 
objective measurements and multivariate analysis.

Cost-utility analysis is used to inform the allocation of healthcare resources, 
using the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as the outcome measure. We report 
the development of an epilepsy-specific QALY measure (NEWQOL-6D) derived from 
the NEWQOL measure of health-related quality of life. Firstly, psychometric and 
Rasch analyses established the dimension structure of NEWQOL and generated a 
reduced health state classification system including one item per dimension. 
Secondly, health states generated by the classification system were valued using 
Time Trade Off, and the results were modeled to generate a utility score for 
every health state. A classification system with 6 dimensions (worry about 
attacks; depression; memory; concentration; stigma; control) was produced, and 
generalized least squares regression was used to generate utility scores for 
every health state. This study is the first attempt to derive an 
epilepsy-specific QALY measure, and the utility values can be used in the 
economic evaluation of emerging technologies for epilepsy.

Obesity, Metabolism, and Diabetes (PROMD), Montréal, Québec, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The median life expectancy of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has 
increased dramatically over the last few years and we now observe a subset of 
patients with a body mass index (BMI) exceeding 25 kg/m(2). The aim of this 
study was to characterize these individuals and to identify factors associated 
with higher BMI.
METHODS: This is a cross sectional study including 187 adult CF subjects. 
Percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1s (%FEV(1)), blood lipid profiles 
as well as fasting glucose and insulin levels were evaluated. Subjects also had 
an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the area under the curve (AUC) for 
glucose and insulin was calculated. CF subjects were then stratified according 
to the following BMI categories: underweight: BMI≤18.5 kg/m(2); normal weight: 
18.5 kg/m(2)<BMI<25 kg/m(2); and overweight or obese: BMI≥25 kg/m(2).
RESULTS: Overweight subjects were older and less likely to have enzyme 
supplementation compared to the other two groups. Furthermore, this group 
exhibits higher levels of fasting insulin, total and LDL-cholesterol as well as 
insulin AUC. Further analyses demonstrated that BMI correlated with %FEV(1), 
fasting insulin, insulin AUC, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and the ratio 
of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol and that %FEV(1), insulin AUC and 
LDL-cholesterol were independent associated with BMI.
DISCUSSION: Overweight CF subjects have higher fasting insulin and insulin AUC 
as well as total and LDL-cholesterol. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that 
LDL-cholesterol, insulin AUC are independently associated with BMI in a 
population of adult CF subjects.

Methylmercury in mosquitoes around a large coal-fired power plant in central 
Ohio.

Dayton, Ohio, USA.

Emissions from coal-fired power plants are the major anthropogenic source of 
mercury (Hg) in the environment. Because emitted Hg can be deposited near the 
source, concerns arise about the effects of coal-burning facilities on levels of 
toxic methylmercury (MeHg) in biota near such sources. We investigated the 
potential impact of a large Hg-emitting (450 kg in 2005) coal-fired power 
station in Conesville, Ohio, on MeHg levels in adult mosquitoes near the plant. 
In July 2010, mosquitoes were sampled at 23 locations within a 60-km radius of 
the plant and at three reference sites distant from major combustion sources of
