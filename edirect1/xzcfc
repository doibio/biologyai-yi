its efficacy may be limited by age of initiation. Decreased plasticity of GFRα-1 
expression following exercise may limit its efficacy to reverse motor decline.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI), despite specialized 
rehabilitation and good health care, have a reduced life expectancy. Infectious 
diseases, such as pneumonias, infected pressure sores and urinary tract 
infections (UTI) have been identified as the leading causes of mortality. We 
hypothesise that a premature onset of immune frailty occurs in SCI, possibly 
caused also by recurrent urinary tract infections.A cross sectional study was 
performed comparing blood and urine samples between able bodied controls 
(n = 84) and persons with spinal cord injury (n = 85). The results were grouped 
according to age (below and above 60 years). Assessed were the abundancies of 
immune cells, the concentration of soluble biomarkers, the in vitro functioning 
of lymphocytes as well as phenotypic exhaustion of T-cells in blood and urine. 
Further, the leucocyte telomere length and the cytomegalovirus (CMV) serological 
status were compared between the groups.
RESULTS: We observed in people with SCI lower proportions of naïve T-cells, more 
memory T-cells, reduced T-cell proliferation and higher CMV prevalence compared 
to age-matched controls. SCI participants older than 60 years had a higher 
prevalence of UTI compared with SCI persons younger than 60 years.
CONCLUSION: The immune system of people with SCI shows traits of an increased 
immunological strain and a premature onset of immune frailty. The role of UTI in 
the onset of immune frailty remains to be elucidated as we did not see 
significantly higher abundancies of circulating UTI-bacteria specific T-cell 
clones in persons with SCI. We assume that any impact of UTI on the immune 
system might be compartmentalized and locally restricted to the urinary tract.

As the largest developing country in the world, China is now facing one of the 
severest air pollution problems. The objective of this section is to evaluate 
the disease burden and corresponding economic loss attributable to ambient air 
pollution in China. We reviewed a series of studies by Chinese or foreign 
investigators focusing on the disease burden and economic loss in China. These 
studies showed both the general air pollution and haze episodes have resulted in 
substantial disease burden in terms of excess number of premature deaths, 
disability-adjusted life-year loss, and years of life lost. The corresponding 
economic loss has accounted for an appreciable proportion of China's national 
economy. Overall, the disease burden and health economic loss due to ambient air 
pollution in China is greater than in the remaining parts of the world, for one 
of the highest levels of air pollution and the largest size of exposed 
population. Consideration of both health and economic impacts of air pollution 
can facilitate the Chinese government to develop environmental policies to 
reduce the emissions of various air pollutants and protect the public health.

PURPOSE: House dust mites (HDM) are major allergens that cause allergic rhinitis 
(AR). Allergen-specific subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) has been shown to be 
clinically beneficial in many clinical trials. Such trials, however, are not 
reflective of all patient populations. The aim of this study was to describe the 
efficacy and safety of SCIT in routine clinical practice in Korean adults with 
AR sensitized to HDM.
METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 304 patients with AR treated at an 
allergy clinic of a tertiary hospital using SCIT with aluminum 
hydroxide-adsorbed allergen extract targeting HDM alone or with pollens for at 
least 1 year from 2000 to 2012. Patients with asthma were excluded. Rates of 
remission, defined as no further requirement of maintenance medication, over 
time were determined by means of life tables and extension of survival analysis. 
Specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels to HDM were categorized into 6 classes.
RESULTS: The mean time until achieving remission was 4.9±0.1 years, and the 
cumulative incidence of remission from AR was 76.6%. Severe AR (odds ratio [OR], 
0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.69; P=0.001), specific IgE levels to 
HDM ≥17.5 kU/L (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.01-3.37; P=0.045), and duration of 
immunotherapy ≥3 years (OR, 7.37; 95% CI, 3.50-15.51; P<0.001) were identified 
as significant predictors of clinical remission during SCIT for patients with AR 
sensitized to HDM. Overall, 73 patients (24.0%) experienced adverse reactions to 
SCIT, and only 1 case of anaphylaxis (0.3%) developed.
CONCLUSIONS: SCIT with HDM was found to be effective and safe for patients with 
AR. Specific IgE levels to HDM and a duration of SCIT ≥3 years may be predictors 
of clinical responses to SCIT in AR patients.

BACKGROUND: Hysterectomy is the commonest major gynaecological surgery. Although 
there are many approaches to hysterectomy, which depend on clinical criteria, 
certain patients may be eligible to be operated in any of the several available 
approaches. However, most comparative studies on hysterectomy are between two 
approaches. There is also a relative absence of data on long-term outcomes on 
quality of life and pelvic organ function. There is no single study which has 
considered quality of life, pelvic organ function and cost-effectiveness for the 
three main types of hysterectomy. Therefore, the objective of this study is to 
provide evidence on the optimal route of hysterectomy in terms of 
cost-effectiveness by way of a three-armed randomized control study between 
non-descent vaginal hysterectomy, total laparoscopic hysterectomy and total 
abdominal hysterectomy.
METHODS: A multicentre three-armed randomized control trial is being conducted 
at the professorial gynaecology unit of the North Colombo Teaching Hospital, 
Ragama, Sri Lanka and gynaecology unit of the District General Hospital, Mannar, 
Sri Lanka. The study population is women needing hysterectomy for non-malignant 
uterine causes. Patients with a uterus > 14 weeks, previous pelvic surgery, 
those requiring incontinence surgery or pelvic floor surgery, any medical 
illness which caution/contraindicate laparoscopic surgery and who cannot read 
and write will be excluded. The main exposure variable is non-descent vaginal 
hysterectomy and total laparoscopic hysterectomy. The control group will be 
patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy. The primary outcome is time to 
recover following surgery, which is the earliest time to resume all of the usual 
activities done prior to surgery. In total, 147 patients (49 per arm) are needed 
to have 80% power at α-0.01 considering a loss to follow-up of 20% to detect a 
7-day difference between the three routes; TLH versus TAH versus NDVH. The 
economic evaluation will take a societal perspective and will include direct 
costs in relation to allocation of healthcare resources and indirect costs which 
are borne by the patient. A micro-costing approach will be adopted to calculate 
direct costs from the time of presentation to the gynaecology clinic up to 
6 months after surgery. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) will be 
obtained by calculating the incremental costs divided by the incremental effects 
(time to recover and QALYs gained) for the intervention groups (NDVH and TLH) 
over the standard care (TAH) group.
DISCUSSION: The cost of the procedure, quality of life and pelvic organ function 
following the three main routes of hysterectomy are important to clinicians and 
healthcare providers, both in developed and developing countries.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in the Sri Lanka clinical trials 
registry (SLCTR/2016/020) and the International Clinical Trials Registry 
Platform ( U1111-1194-8422 ) on 26 July 2016.

Objective Life expectancy of psychiatric patients is markedly shorter compared 
to the general population, likely partly due to smoking or misuse of other 
substances. We investigated prevalence and correlates of substance use among 
psychiatric patients. Methods Within the Helsinki University Psychiatric 
Consortium Study, data were collected on substance use (alcohol, smoking, and 
illicit drugs) among patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder 
(n = 113), bipolar (n = 99), or depressive disorder (n = 188). Clinical 
diagnoses of substance use were recorded, and information on smoking, hazardous 
alcohol use, or misuse of other substances was obtained using questionnaires. 
Results One-fourth (27.7%) of the patients had clinical diagnoses of substance 
use disorders. In addition, in the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, 
43.1% had hazardous alcohol use and 38.4% were daily smokers. All substance use 
was more common in men than in women. Bipolar patients had the highest 
prevalence of alcohol use disorders and hazardous use, whereas those with 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were more often daily smokers. In 
regression analyses, self-reported alcohol consumption was associated with 
symptoms of anxiety and borderline personality disorder and low 
conscientiousness. No associations emerged for smoking. Conclusions The vast 
majority of psychiatric care patients have a diagnosed substance use disorder, 
hazardous alcohol use, or smoke daily, males more often than females. Bipolar 
patients have the highest rates of alcohol misuse, schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective disorder patients of smoking. Alcohol use may associate with 
symptoms of anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and low conscientiousness. 
Preventive and treatment efforts specifically targeted at harmful substance use 
among psychiatric patients are necessary.

BACKGROUND: Implementing community water fluoridation involves costs, but these 
need to be considered against the likely benefits. We aimed to assess the 
cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness of water fluoridation in New Zealand (NZ) in 
terms of expenditure and quality-adjusted life years.
METHODS: Based on published studies, we determined the risk reduction effects of 
fluoridation, we quantified its health benefits using standardised dental 
indexes, and we calculated financial savings from averted treatment. We analysed 
NZ water supplies to estimate the financial costs of fluoridation. We devised a 
method to represent dental caries experience in quality-adjusted life years.
RESULTS: Over 20 years, the net discounted saving from adding fluoride to 
reticulated water supplies supplying populations over 500 would be NZ$1401 
million, a nine times pay-off. Between 8800 and 13,700 quality-adjusted life 
years would be gained. While fluoridating reticulated water supplies for large 
communities is cost-effective, it is unlikely to be so with populations smaller 
than 500.
CONCLUSIONS: Community water fluoridation remains highly cost-effective for all 
but very small communities. The health benefits-while (on average) small per 
person-add up to a substantial reduction in the national disease burden across 
all ethnic and socioeconomic groups.

Increased life expectancy, ageing and the accumulation of chronic pathologies 
leads to a certain functional dependence. The term 'frailty' is used to refer to 
the state of 'predependence' in elderly people. It is therefore important to 
detect and prevent frailty and provide frail elderly people with the adapted 
care. Training caregivers to recognise signs of frailty is essential.

Coordinated locomotor muscle activity is generated by the spinal central pattern 
generators (CPGs), which are modulated by peripheral and supraspinal inputs. The 
CPGs would consist of multiple motor modules generating basic muscle activity, 
which are distributed rostrocaudally along the spinal cord. To activate the 
motor modules in proper sequence, rostrocaudally traveling waves of activation 
in the spinal cord are important mechanisms in the CPGs. The traveling waves of 
activation have been observed in nonhuman vertebrates. However, they have not 
yet been confirmed during human locomotion. Although, rostrocaudal wave-like 
activations in the spinal cord were observed during walking in humans in a 
previous study, the propagation shifted rostrally toward the upper lumbar 
segments at foot contact. Here, using an air stepping task to remove the 
foot-contact interactions, we examined whether the traveling wave mechanism 
exists in the human spinal circuits based on the activation sequence of motor 
modules and their topography. We measured electromyographic activity of lower 
leg muscles during the air-stepping task. Then, we extracted motor modules 
(i.e., basic patterns of sets of muscle activations: muscle synergies) from the 
measured muscle activities using nonnegative matrix factorization method. Next, 
we reconstructed motoneuron (MN) activity from each module activity based on 
myotomal charts. We identified four types of motor modules from muscle 
activities during the air-stepping task. Each motor module represented different 
sets of synergistic muscle activations. MN clusters innervating each motor 
module were sequentially activated from the rostral to caudal region in the 
spinal cord, from the initial flexion to the last extension phase during 
air-stepping. The rostrocaudally sequential activation of MN clusters suggests 
the possibility that rostrocaudally traveling waves exist in human locomotor 
spinal circuits. The present results advance the understanding of human 
locomotor control mechanisms, and provide important insights into the evolution 
of locomotor networks in vertebrates.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy is important to inform a number of clinical 
decisions in primary care but its communication is challenging for clinicians.
METHODS: This qualitative interview study with 40 community-dwelling older 
adults explored their perspectives on how and when to discuss life expectancy in 
primary care.
RESULTS: Most participants did not want to discuss life expectancy longer than 1 
year but were open to being offered discussion by clinicians. Suggestions 
included using health decline as trigger for discussion and discussing with 
family members instead of patient.
DISCUSSION: Although older adults have varied preferences for the timing and 
content of life expectancy discussions in primary care, it was generally 
acceptable for clinicians to offer the opportunity for this type of discussion.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of preferred intensity exercise 
programme for young people with depression compared with a treatment as usual 
control group.
DESIGN: A 'within trial' cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis conducted 
alongside a randomised controlled trial. The perspective of the analysis was the 
UK National Health Service and social services.
SETTING: The intervention was provided in a community leisure centre setting.
PARTICIPANTS: 86 young people aged 14-17 years attending Tier 2 and Tier 3 CAMHS 
(Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) outpatient services presenting 
with depression.
INTERVENTIONS: The intervention comprised 12 separate sessions of circuit 
training over a 6-week period. Sessions were supervised by a qualified exercise 
therapist. Participants also received treatment as usual. The comparator group 
received treatment as usual.
RESULTS: We found improvements in the Children's Depression Inventory-2 (CDI-2) 
and estimated cost-effectiveness at £61 per point improvement in CDI-2 for the 
exercise group compared with control. We found no evidence that the exercise 
intervention led to differences in quality-adjusted life years (QALY). QALYs 
were estimated using the EQ-5D-5L (5-level version of EuroQol-5 dimension).
CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that exercise can be an effective intervention 
for adolescents with depression and the current study shows that preferred 
intensity exercise could also represent a cost-effective intervention in terms 
of the CDI-2.

Medicine, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China.

OBJECTIVE: Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is one of the Philadelphia negative 
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). The main clinical features are obvious 
physical symptoms and symptomatic splenomegaly. It may be converse to leukemia 
and has a shortened life expectancy. Nowadays, the therapy for PMF is aimed at 
maintaining comfort and there is no curative treatment. PMF with myelodysplastic 
syndrome (MDS), called MDS/MPN-u, is rare and the treatment is complex. In this 
study, we want to discuss an effective treatment for MDS/MPN via a case report 
and literature review.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A female patient was diagnosed with MDS/MPN through bone 
marrow cytology, immunology, cell genetics, molecular biology, and pathology. 
She received thalidomide and prednisone as initial treatment. Ten months later, 
the first-line therapy had failed, she presented with clinically relevant 
pancytopenia and increased blasts in bone marrow. Because decitabine is one of 
the first-line treatments for MDS and the patient was frail, she received 
low-dose decitabine as second-line therapy. Decitabine was administered at 15 
mg/m2 once a week for 3 weeks, in a 4 week cycle. If there was improvement the 
treatment interval was prolonged.
RESULT: After one cycle, the blasts in bone marrow were decreased to 0.5%. After 
four cycles, she felt comfortable and hematological improvement was achieved. 
The treatment interval was prolonged. After eight cycles, the spleen reduced to 
2 cm under the rib, and she achieved complete hematological remission. After ten 
cycles, the mutation of JAK2/V617F expression was decreased from 60.63% to 
0.01%. During the therapy, the patient presented with grade III-IV hematological 
toxicity after the first two cycles, but there were no side effects after 
subsequent cycles.
CONCLUSION: Our research showed that low-dose decitabine may be an effective 
treatment for MDS/MPN, especially in improving physical symptoms and achieving 
hematological remission. Besides, it may be possible to reverse positive JAK2 
mutation.

Cardiac angiosarcoma is a rare but lethal tumor that is difficult to diagnose 
and treat, due to its rapid local relapse and high incidence of systemic 
metastasis. The prognosis of cardiac angiosarcoma is dismal, with a mean life 
expectancy of only a few months. We herein report a case of unresectable 
angiosarcoma arising from the right atrium. The patient received first-line 
chemotherapy with weekly paclitaxel, and second-line therapy with vinorelbine 
and bevacizumab upon disease progression. The progression-free survival was 6 
months and the overall survival was 7 months. The patient eventually succumbed 
to respiratory failure. A study of the present case and a review of the relevant 
literature suggest that treatment decisions for unresectable locally advanced or 
metastatic cardiac angiosarcoma are difficult, as the published literature on 
this disease mainly consists of case reports without sufficient data. Therefore, 
further clinical trials specific to the treatment of unresectable cardiac 
angiosarcoma are warranted.

The Indigenous population of Canada faces an increased burden of chronic 
disease, leading to decreased life expectancy. Physical activity is an important 
health behaviour that improves chronic disease risk factors and physical 
fitness. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate physical 
activity interventions in the Indigenous population in Canada to determine 
effects on physical activity rates, physical fitness, and health outcomes. 
MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched for peer-reviewed journal 
articles. Inclusion criteria were studies that examined a physical activity 
intervention delivered in Indigenous communities in Canada for adults over 
18 years of age. Data was extracted and two authors independently rated quality 
of the evidence. Five studies were included in the narrative synthesis. 
Interventions were community-based, and three were multi-component interventions 
focused on preventing or managing type II diabetes. The interventions varied in 
their success in altering physical activity rates, with increases (n = 2), a 
decrease (n = 1), or non-significant changes reported (n = 2). No study reported 
any measure of physical fitness. BMI was reported in four studies, with only one 
reporting a significant decrease. Decreases in systolic blood pressure and total 
cholesterol were reported in two studies. There is limited evidence and a lack 
of robust interventions that examine the impacts of physical activity on health 
and fitness status in the Canadian Indigenous population. Validated, culturally 
relevant tools for measuring physical activity may aid in program evaluation and 
focused educational materials could better support population health 
initiatives.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The review protocol was registered prospectively with 
PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42017055363).

INTRODUCTION: Africans living with prostate cancer in Africa face problems of 
early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
AIM: To study the clinical incidence of prostate cancer, risk factors, TNM 
stage, their management and outcomes.
METHODS: A prospective study of Prostate Cancer cases managed at Korle Bu 
Teaching Hospital and hospitals in Accra, diagnosed by history, abnormal 
PSA/DRE, physical examination and histologically confirmed by biopsy from 2004 
to 2013 was carried out. The cases were TNM staged and managed by approved 
protocol.
RESULTS: There were 669 cases with a mean age 70±0.045SE years, median Gleason 
Score of 7, organ confined Prostate Cancer(PC) in 415(62%), locally advanced in 
167(25%) and metastatic Prostate Cancer in 87(13%) cases. The cases were 
followed for median of 10 months to ≥ 84 months. Organ confined cases were 
managed by: Radical Prostatectomy (RP) 92 (13.8%) with a mortality of 0.3%; 
brachytherapy 70 (10.5%) with a mortality of 0.1% and External Beam Radiotherapy 
(EBRT) 155 (23%) with a mortality 0.7%. In all, 98 men constituting (14.1%) 
cases with a mean age of 75+0.25SE years, life expectancy <10 years were treated 
by hormonal therapy with a mortality of 1.7%. Twenty cases who were for active 
surveillance (GS6), PSA <10ng/ml, life expectancy <10 years later all opted for 
EBRT. Locally advanced cases 25% all had neoadjuvant hormonal therapy then 
Brachytherapy in 3 (0.4%) mortality 0.15% and EBRT in 64 (9.5%), mortality 
0.59%. Hormonal therapy was given in 100 (15%) locally advanced cases, mortality 
5%. Metastatic prostate cancer cases (13%) were managed by hormonal therapy, 
mortality 6%.
CONCLUSION: Improved facilities and dedicated skilled teams led to a significant 
rise in proportion of organ confined Prostate Cancer from 15.3% to 62% curable 
by Radical Prostatectomy, brachytherapy or EBRT with longer disease free 
survival.

Patient Self-testing (PST) could be an option for present anticoagulation 
therapy monitoring, but current evidence on its cost-effectiveness is limited. 
This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PST to other different 
care approaches for anticoagulation therapy in Thailand, a low-to-middle income 
country (LMIC). A Markov model was used to compare lifetime costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued to patients receiving warfarin 
through PST or either anticoagulation clinic (AC) or usual care (UC). The model 
was populated with relevant information from literature, network meta-analysis, 
and database analyses. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
presented as the year 2015 values. A base-case analysis was performed for 
patients at age 45-year-old. Sensitivity analyses including one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were constructed to determine the 
robustness of the findings. From societal perspective, PST increased QALY by 
0.87 and costs by 112,461 THB compared with UC. Compared with AC, PST increased 
QALY by 0.161 and costs by 21,019 THB. The ICER with PST was 128,697 (3625 USD) 
and 130,493 THB (3676 USD) per QALY gained compared with UC and AC, 
respectively. The probability of PST being cost-effective is 74.1% and 51.9%, 
compared to UC and AC, respectively, in Thai context. Results were sensitive to 
the efficacy of PST, age and frequency of hospital visit or self-testing. This 
analysis suggested that PST is highly cost-effective compared with usual care 
and less cost-effective against anticoagulation clinic. Patient self-testing 
strategy appears to be economically valuable to include into healthcare system 
within the LMIC context.

BACKGROUND: Electrical cardioversion (ECV) is a procedure in which a direct 
current electric shock is used to quickly and effectively restore the normal 
sinus rhythm. Appropriate anticoagulation reduces the risk of embolic events 
during and after ECV. The aim of this study was to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with vitamin K oral antagonists 
(VKAs) in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing elective ECV in the 
Netherlands.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A static transmission model over a 1-year time horizon was 
developed to compare rivaroxaban with VKAs in terms of clinical outcomes, health 
effects (quality-adjusted life years; QALYs), and costs. Cost-effectiveness was 
assessed from a societal and health care payer perspective at a 
willingness-to-pay level of €20,000 per QALY gained. The use of rivaroxaban as 
an anticoagulant in patients with atrial fibrillation scheduled for ECV would 
lead to a health gain of 0.23 QALYs per patient and would cost €1.83 per patient 
from the societal perspective, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of €7.92 per QALY gained. The probability of rivaroxaban being cost-saving 
compared with VKAs was 49.6% from this perspective. From the health care payer 
perspective, the incremental cost would be €509 per patient with a health gain 
of 0.23 QALYs per patient, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of €2198 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of rivaroxaban in elective ECV is a cost-effective 
alternative to the use of VKAs. Rivaroxaban has a 50% probability of being 
cost-saving compared with VKAs and would increase a patient's quality of life 
when non-health care costs such as productivity loss and informal care costs are 
taken into account.

BACKGROUND: The health gap between the top and the bottom of the income 
distribution is widening rapidly in the USA, but the lifespan of America's poor 
depends substantially on where they live. We ask whether two major developments 
in American society, deindustrialization and incarceration, can explain 
variation among states in life expectancy of those in the lowest income 
quartile.
METHODS: Life expectancy estimates at age 40 of those in the bottom income 
quartile were used to fit panel data models examining the relationship with 
deindustrialization and incarceration between 2001 and 2014 for all US states.
RESULTS: A one standard deviation (s.d.) increase in deindustrialization 
(mean = 11.2, s.d. = 3.5) reduces life expectancy for the poor by 0.255 years 
[95% confidence interval (CI): 0.090-0.419] and each additional prisoner per 
1000 residents (mean = 4.0, s.d. = 1.5) is associated with a loss of 0.468 years 
(95% CI: 0.213-0.723). Our predictors explain over 20% of the state-level 
variation in life expectancy among the poor and virtually the entire increase in 
the life expectancy gap between the top and the bottom income quartiles since 
the turn of the century.
CONCLUSIONS: In the USA between 2001 and 2014, deindustrialization and 
incarceration subtracted roughly 2.5 years from the lifespan of the poor, 
pointing to their role as major health determinants. Future research must remain 
conscious of the upstream determinants and the political economy of public 
health. If public policy responses to growing health inequalities are to be 
effective, they must consider strengthening industrial policy and ending 
hyper-incarceration.

This study investigated effects of downhill (DR) versus level (LR) running 
training on various muscular and aerobic performances. Eighteen healthy young 
males conducted either DR (DR group (DRG), n = 10: -10% slope) or LR (LR group 
(LRG), n = 8) training at a target heart rate (HR) associated with lactate 
threshold (LT) for 20 min·session-1, 3 sessions·week-1, for 5 weeks. Before and 
after the interventions, the following variables were measured: knee extension 
torque (-150, -30, 0, 30, 150°·s-1), leg extension power (simultaneous hip and 
knee extension: 0.8 m·s-1), squat and countermovement jump height, rebound jump 
index (jump height·contact time-1), 20-m linear sprint and change-of-direction 
(Pro-agility and V-cut tests) time, and aerobic capacity (maximal oxygen uptake, 
energy cost at LT, and velocity at maximal oxygen uptake and LT) on a level 
surface. Throughout the training sessions, HR during running did not differ 
between the groups (DRG: 77.7% ± 4.6% vs LRG: 76.4% ± 4.6% of maximal HR; 
average across all sessions), while velocity was significantly higher for DRG 
(14.5 ± 1.1 vs 12.0 ± 1.9 km·h-1). After the training, DRG significantly 
improved knee extension torque at all angular velocities (9%-24%) and 
change-of-direction time for both tests (2%-3%), with no changes in other 
parameters. LRG significantly improved maximal oxygen uptake (5%), energy cost 
at LT (3%), and velocity at maximal oxygen uptake (7%), without changes in 
others. These results suggest that DR training has a greater potential to 
improve the knee extension strength and change-of-direction ability, but has 
little effect on the aerobic capacity, compared with HR-matched LR training.

A spotlight on the management of complications associated with 
myeloproliferative neoplasms: a clinician's perspective.

Greenfield G(1), McMullin MF(1).

Author information:
(1)a Queen's University Belfast , Belfast , Northern Ireland.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are associated with a variety of symptoms 
and signs which cause major morbidity for the patients. The disorders are 
associated with increased incidence of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events 
which can lead to complications and shortened life expectancy. Areas covered: 
Using systematic literature review and expert clinical and research experience 
the authors discuss strategies for the management of symptoms and signs 
including pruritus, fatigue, splenomegaly, and cytopenia. Cytoreduction 
including treatments to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway are considered. 
Pathogenesis and prevention and treatment of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events 
and their management is addressed and the suggested management of the special 
situations such as surgery and pregnancy are discussed. Expert commentary: 
Management of disease has traditionally focused on symptom treatment and 
complication prevention but the discovery of driver mutations has led to 
treatments aiming to eliminate the clone, which should be the ultimate goal of 
therapy. A future challenge is to develop safe and effective MPN therapy and to 
personalize therapy.

BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a progressive, devastating disease 
and a leading inherited cause of infant mortality. The limited population-based 
literature is confined to small regional studies. Estimates of prevalence are 
needed to characterize the burden of SMA and to understand trends in prevalence 
by disease type as new treatments become available. The reported estimates of 
SMA genotype prevalence at birth consistently range from 8.5-10.3 per 100,000 
live births, with a mid-range estimate of 9.4 per 100,000. Among infants born 
with an SMA genotype, it is reported that ~58% will develop SMA Type I, 29% will 
develop Type II, and 13% will develop Type III, respectively.
RESULTS: Using evidence from peer-reviewed literature for SMA birth prevalence, 
age at symptom onset, and SMA type-specific survival, and incorporating United 
States vital statistics, we constructed life tables to estimate prevalence for 
SMA Types I, II, and III in the United States. We estimated the number of 
prevalent cases in the US to be 8526, 9429, and 10,333 based on a birth 
prevalence of 8.5, 9.4, and 10.3, respectively (the lower, midpoint, and upper 
ends of the reported range). Assuming the midpoint of 9.4 and US-reported 
survival, the type-specific population prevalence estimates were 1610 for SMA 
Type I, 3944 for SMA Type II, and 3875 for SMA Type III. Evidence-based 
estimates of the number of people living with SMA in the United States in the 
published literature were previously unavailable.
CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of a survey or other means to directly estimate 
prevalence in the US population, estimates can be calculated indirectly using a 
life table.
