Progressive increase of mean age and life expectancy in both industrialized and 
emerging societies parallels an increment of chronic degenerative diseases (CDD) 
such as cancer, cardiovascular, autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases among 
the elderly. CDD are of complex diagnosis, difficult to treat and absorbing an 
increasing proportion in the health care budgets worldwide. However, recent 
development in modern medicine especially in genetics, proteomics, and 
informatics is leading to the discovery of biomarkers associated with different 
CDD that can be used as indicator of disease's risk in healthy subjects. 
Therefore, predictive medicine is merging and medical doctors may for the first 
time anticipate the deleterious effect of CDD and use markers to identify 
persons with high risk of developing a given CDD before the clinical 
manifestation of the diseases. This innovative approach may offer substantial 
advantages, since the promise of personalized medicine is to preserve individual 
health in people with high risk by starting early treatment or prevention 
protocols. The pathway is now open, however the road to an effective 
personalized medicine is still long, several (diagnostic) predictive instruments 
for different CDD are under development, some ethical issues have to be solved. 
Operative proposals for the heath care systems are now needed to verify 
potential benefits of predictive medicine in the clinical practice. In fact, 
predictive diagnostics, personalized medicine and personalized therapy have the 
potential of changing classical approaches of modern medicine to CDD.

OBJECTIVE: to investigate the burden of excess mortality among people with 
mental illness in developed countries, how it is distributed, and whether it has 
changed over time.
METHOD: we conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, restricting our attention 
to peer-reviewed studies and reviews published in English relating to mortality 
and mental illness. Because of the large number of studies that have been 
undertaken during the last 30 years, we have selected a representative 
cross-section of studies for inclusion in our review.
RESULTS: there is substantial excess mortality in people with mental illness for 
almost all psychiatric disorders and all main causes of death. Consistently 
elevated rates have been observed across settings and over time. The highest 
numbers of excess deaths are due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. 
With life expectancy increasing in the general population, the disparity in 
mortality outcomes for people with mental illness is increasing.
CONCLUSIONS: without the development of alternative approaches to promoting and 
treating the physical health of people with mental illness, it is possible that 
the disparity in mortality outcomes will persist.

PURPOSE: Copious studies exist regarding the use of stents in pediatric 
pyeloplasty. Most surgeons use either no stent, an internal (Double-J®) stent or 
an external transanastomotic pyeloureteral stent. We propose the first known 
study to compare all 3 methods using a decision tree model that incorporates 
success rates, complications, patient discomfort and costs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created a deterministic decision tree model. We 
conducted a literature search querying urinary diversion in pediatric 
pyeloplasty. We used the largest studies for base inputs and remaining studies 
for sensitivity analysis. Direct costs from actual patients seen at the 
University of California San Francisco populated cost inputs.
RESULTS: Total quality adjusted life-years during a 16-year period for no stents 
was 12.70851 with a total cost of $6,122. Total quality adjusted life-years for 
external stents was 12.71098 at a total cost of $5,702. Internal stents resulted 
in total quality adjusted life-years of 12.69983 and cost of $8,421. Thus, 
external stents dominated no stents and internal stents, while no stents 
dominated internal stents. On sensitivity analysis even decreasing complication 
and failure rates of internal stents to zero did not make them cost effective 
due to the costs associated with stent removal. In contrast, decreasing 
complication and pyeloplasty rates of no stents by 20% resulted in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $5,475 per quality adjusted life-year 
gained compared to external stents.
CONCLUSIONS: External and no stents are superior to internal stents. Given high 
overall success rates of pyeloplasty regardless of stent method, perhaps more 
attention should be given to cost from a health policy standpoint.

The number of births in the United States decreased between 2007 and 2008 
(preliminary estimate: 4 251 095). Birth rates declined among all women aged 15 
to 39 years; the decrease among teenagers reverses the increases seen in the 
previous 2 years. The total fertility rate decreased 2% in 2008 to 2085.5 births 
per 1000 women. The proportion of all births to unmarried women increased to 
40.6% in 2008, up from 39.7% in 2007. The 2008 preterm birth rate was 12.3%, a 
decline of 3% from 2007. In 2008, 32.3% of all births occurred by cesarean 
delivery, up nearly 2% from 2007. Twin and triplet birth rates were unchanged. 
The infant mortality rate was 6.59 infant deaths per 1000 live births in 2008 
(significantly lower than the rate of 6.75 in 2007). Life expectancy at birth 
was 77.8 years in 2008. Crude death rates for children aged 1 to 19 years 
decreased by 5.5% between 2007 and 2008. Unintentional injuries and homicide 
were, respectively, the first and second leading causes of death in this age 
group. These 2 causes of death jointly accounted for 51.2% of all deaths of 
children and adolescents in 2008. This annual article is a long-standing feature 
in Pediatrics and provides a summary of the most current vital statistics data 
for the United States. We also include a special feature this year on the 
differences in cesarean-delivery rates according to race and Hispanic origin.

BACKGROUND: Although recent guidelines call for expanded routine screening for 
HIV, resources for antiretroviral therapy (ART) are limited, and all eligible 
persons are not currently receiving treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects on the U.S. HIV epidemic of expanded ART, HIV 
screening, or interventions to reduce risk behavior.
DESIGN: Dynamic mathematical model of HIV transmission and disease progression 
and cost-effectiveness analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature.
TARGET POPULATION: High-risk (injection drug users and men who have sex with 
men) and low-risk persons aged 15 to 64 years in the United States.
TIME HORIZON: Twenty years and lifetime (costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
[QALYs]).
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: Expanded HIV screening and counseling, treatment with ART, or 
both.
OUTCOME MEASURES: New HIV infections, discounted costs and QALYs, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: One-time HIV screening of low-risk persons 
coupled with annual screening of high-risk persons could prevent 6.7% of a 
projected 1.23 million new infections and cost $22,382 per QALY gained, assuming 
a 20% reduction in sexual activity after screening. Expanding ART utilization to 
75% of eligible persons prevents 10.3% of infections and costs $20,300 per QALY 
gained. A combination strategy prevents 17.3% of infections and costs $21,580 
per QALY gained.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: With no reduction in sexual activity, expanded 
screening prevents 3.7% of infections. Earlier ART initiation when a CD4 count 
is greater than 0.350 × 10(9) cells/L prevents 20% to 28% of infections. 
Additional efforts to halve high-risk behavior could reduce infections by 65%.
LIMITATION: The model of disease progression and treatment was simplified, and 
acute HIV screening was excluded.
CONCLUSION: Expanding HIV screening and treatment simultaneously offers the 
greatest health benefit and is cost-effective. However, even substantial 
expansion of HIV screening and treatment programs is not sufficient to markedly 
reduce the U.S. HIV epidemic without substantial reductions in risk behavior.

Management of acromegaly.

Vasilev V, Daly A, Zacharieva S, Beckers A.

Acromegaly is caused by hypersecretion of growth hormone and resultant 
overproduction of insulin-like growth factor-1 and is associated with increased 
mortality and morbidity. Successful treatment modalities have been developed and 
are used in a multistep approach allowing normal life expectancy as well as 
improved quality of life in an increasing number of patients.

OBJECTIVE: This report describes the design of a study aiming to provide 
evidence for the extended use of botulinum toxin A in focal post-stroke upper 
and lower limb spasticity and to evaluate the impact of incorporating botulinum 
toxin treatment into the rehabilitation of patients with spasticity.
DESIGN: International, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study with an open-label extension.
METHODS: Approximately 300 adults with a stroke occurring ≥ 3 months before 
screening, presenting with symptoms and signs of an upper motor neuron syndrome 
and focal spasticity-related functional impairment, were randomized to botulinum 
toxin (BOTOX®, Allergan Inc.) + standard care or placebo + standard care. Study 
medication was administered at baseline and again at Week 12 if required, with 
follow-up to 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the number of patients who 
achieved their investigator-rated principal active functional goal (as measured 
by Goal Attainment Scaling), at 10 weeks after the second injection (Weeks 
22-34) or at the 24-week visit if no second injection was administered. 
Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in level of goal achievement, 
health-related quality of life and resource utilization.
CONCLUSION: Botulinum toxin A Economic Spasticity Trial (BEST) will provide 
information regarding clinical and cost-effectiveness of botulinum toxin + 
standard care vs standard care alone in patients with upper and/or lower limb 
post-stroke spasticity typically seen in clinical practice.

Clinical and radiological distinction between spondylothoracic dysostosis 
(Lavy-Moseley syndrome) and spondylocostal dysostosis (Jarcho-Levin syndrome).

In 1938, Saul Jarcho and Paul Levin from Johns Hopkins Hospital reported cases 
of thoracic insufficiency due to vertebral and rib anomalies. Nearly 30 years 
later, in 1966, Norman Lavy and associates from Indiana University reported a 
similar syndrome in a family from Puerto Rico. Lavy's description was followed 
by a report by John E. Moseley from New York City, where the name 
spondylothoracic dysplasia (dysostosis) was first used. For more than half a 
century, there has been confusion regarding the distinction between these two 
phenotypically similar syndromes that cause thoracic insufficiency. 
Spondylocostal dysostosis (SCD), or Jarcho-Levin syndrome, causes mild to 
moderate respiratory insufficiency, is panethnic and has been linked to genes 
such as DLL3, which is known to be associated with the Notch pathway. In 
contrast, spondylothoracic dysostosis (STD), or Lavy-Moseley syndrome, results 
in more severe respiratory compromise, is largely linked to Puerto Rican cohorts 
and is thought to be associated to the MESP2 gene, also a Notch pathway gene. 
Long-term studies of Puerto Rican cohorts with STD contradicts the previously 
held belief that individuals affected with STD have markedly diminished life 
expectancy with as many as 25% surviving into later childhood and adult life.

US mortality in an international context: age variations.

Ho JY(1), Preston SH.

Author information:
(1)University of Pennsylvania.

Compared to other developed countries, the United States ranks poorly in terms 
of life expectancy at age 50. We seek to shed light on the US's low life 
expectancy ranking by comparing the age-specific death rates of 18 developed 
countries at older ages. A striking pattern emerges: between ages 40 and 75, US 
all-cause mortality rates are among the poorest in the set of comparison 
countries. The US position improves dramatically after age 75 for both males and 
females. We consider four possible explanations of the age patterns revealed by 
this analysis: (1) access to health insurance; (2) international differences in 
patterns of smoking; (3) age patterns of health care system performance; and (4) 
selection processes. We find that health insurance and smoking are not plausible 
sources of this age pattern. While we cannot rule out selection, we present 
suggestive evidence that an unusually vigorous deployment of life-saving 
technologies by the US health care system at very old ages is contributing to 
the age-pattern of US mortality rankings. Differences in obesity distributions 
are likely to be making a moderate contribution to the pattern but uncertainty 
about the risks associated with obesity prevents a precise assessment.

Effect of sublethal dose of diflubenzuron and azadirachtin on various life table 
attributes of Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae).

The exposure of sublethal doses (25% emergence inhibition) of diflubenzuron 
(DFB) (0.0002 mg/liter) and azadirachtin (AZD; 0.0079 mg/liter) insect growth 
regulators was provided to late third- early fourth instars of Culex 
quinquefasciatus till emergence of adults to find out the effects on various 
biological and life table attributes of adults, and comparison was made with 
control (CTL) as well. Life expectancy of both males and females of DFB 
survivors was significantly less in comparison with AZD and CTL ones; however, 
it was nonsignificantly different between CTL and AZD. In all treatments, males 
were shorter lived than females of their respective treatments. DFB survivors 
showed significant reduction in number of blood-fed females, resulting in 
minimum of oviposition days, total number of egg rafts, total number of eggs, 
eggs per egg raft, eggs per female life span, and eggs per female per day than 
survivors of both AZD and CTL significantly, but these parameters did not differ 
significantly between CTL and AZD, except eggs per egg raft. The net 
reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of increase, and finite rate of increase were 
significantly less in DFB than rest of the survivors, whereas doubling time for 
generation was significantly high; however, difference in mean generation was 
not significant among them. This study reveals that DFB has the potency to 
affect severely the various life table attributes at sublethal dose, but AZD 
does not have such effectiveness at similar sublethal dose against Cx. 
quinquefasciatus.

Modelled cost-effectiveness of high cut-off haemodialysis compared to standard 
haemodialysis in the management of myeloma kidney.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 10-20% of multiple myeloma patients experience 
dialysis-dependent renal failure. This is principally due to myeloma kidney, a 
tubulointerstitial injury caused by high circulating concentrations of 
monoclonal free light chains. Studies have found that between 3% and 37% of 
patients with myeloma kidney requiring dialysis recover renal function. In-vivo 
studies indicate that extended haemodialysis using high cut-off dialysers 
(HCO-HD) can remove significant quantities of free light chains and is 
associated with a renal recovery rate of 63-74% in these patients.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
HCO-HD compared to standard HD in the management of myeloma kidney.
METHODS: The study used a lifetime Excel-based decision tree model that followed 
all patients from treatment of the initial presentation with myeloma kidney 
requiring dialysis to death. It was populated with published clinical data, 
United Kingdom costs and expert opinion, using a National Health Service 
perspective and 3.5% annual discounting.
RESULTS: HCO-HD was dominant to standard HD, meaning it was both more effective 
(greater life years and quality adjusted life years) and less costly, due to a 
greater increase in the proportion of patients recovering renal function. The 
model projected lifetime costs of £31,345 per patient for patients treated with 
standard haemodialysis only and £24,845 for the new treatment (discounted). The 
model predicted an average survival of 19.92 months for patients on standard HD 
and 33.90 months for the new therapy (discounted).
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis found that treatment of myeloma kidney using an 
extended schedule of HCO-HD may substantially improve renal recovery in multiple 
myeloma patients compared to standard HD, resulting in greater life expectancy 
and cost savings due to avoided chronic dialysis. Limitations of the study 
include those common to rare diseases including small study sizes and limited 
natural history data.

Chronic diseases and mortality in Canadian Aboriginal peoples: learning from the 
knowledge.

Health.

It is a sad fact that Canada's Aboriginal people, whether living in rural 
communities or in urban centers, have a significantly lower life expectancy than 
non-Aboriginal Canadians.1a The gap in health status of Canada's Aboriginal 
peoples is a matter of ongoing concern;2 recognizing and understanding the 
social determinants of health is key to understanding the difference in health 
status and, in my view, key to achieving success in addressing and correcting 
this problem. However, it is important to realize that there are unique social 
determinants for Aboriginal peoples associated with their cultures, histories 
and colonization, and the current social, economic, political and geographic 
context.

OBJECTIVE: To compare mortality patterns for urban Aboriginal adults with those 
of urban non-Aboriginal adults.
METHODS: Using the 1991-2001 Canadian census mortality follow-up study, our 
study tracked mortality to December 31, 2001, among a 15% sample of adults, 
including 16 300 Aboriginal and 2 062 700 non-Aboriginal persons residing in 
urban areas on June 4, 1991. The Aboriginal population was defined by ethnic 
origin (ancestry), Registered Indian status and/or membership in an Indian band 
or First Nation, since the 1991 census did not collect information on Aboriginal 
identity.
RESULTS: Compared to urban non-Aboriginal men and women, remaining life 
expectancy at age 25 years was 4.7 years and 6.5 years shorter for urban 
Aboriginal men and women, respectively. Mortality rate ratios for urban 
Aboriginal men and women were particularly elevated for alcohol-related deaths, 
motor vehicle accidents and infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS. For most 
causes of death, urban Aboriginal adults had higher mortality rates compared to 
other urban residents. Socio-economic status played an important role in 
explaining these disparities.
CONCLUSION: Results from this study help fill a data gap on mortality 
information of urban Aboriginal people of Canada.

We present a model aiming at the description of intercellular communication on 
the invasive character of gliomas. We start from a previous model of ours based 
on a cellular automaton and develop a new version of it in a three-dimensional 
geometry. Introducing the hydrodynamic limit of the automaton we obtain a 
macroscopic model involving a nonlinear diffusion equation. We show that this 
macroscopic model is quite adequate for the description of realistic situations. 
Comparison of the simulations with experimental results shows agreement with the 
finding that the inhibition of intercellular communication (through gap 
junctions) tends to decrease migration. As an application of our model we 
estimated the possible increase in life expectancy, due to reduced cell 
migration mediated by the inhibition of intercellular communication, on patients 
suffering from gliomas. We find that the obtained increase may amount to a 20% 
gain in the case of unresectable tumours.

Sacral neuromodulation for the treatment of fecal incontinence: analysis of 
cost-effectiveness.

Italy. marileda.indinnimeo@uniroma1.it

PURPOSE: The cost-effectiveness and budget impact of introducing sacral nerve 
modulation (SNM) as a treatment for fecal incontinence in Italy were evaluated 
in a simulation model.
METHODS: A decision-analysis model with a Markov submodel was used to represent 
clinical pathways for treatment of patients with fecal incontinence in a 
scenario with SNM and a scenario without SNM. Data were obtained from published 
studies and from an expert panel. Evaluation of resource consumption was 
conducted from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service, and costs 
were retrieved from the Italian NHS procedures reimbursement list. The time 
horizon was 5 years, and a 3% discount rate was applied to costs and outcomes. 
Effectiveness was measured in symptom-free years and in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). Fecal incontinence prevalence data and SNM usage forecasts 
were used to estimate budget impact over the next 5 years.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for introducing SNM was 
€28,285 per QALY gained for patients with a structurally deficient anal 
sphincter and €38,662 per QALY gained for patients with intact anal sphincters. 
If a threshold of €40,000 per QALY gained is set as the level that a 
decision-maker would regard as cost-effective, the probability that the 
introduction of SNM will be cost-effective would be 99% for patients with a 
structurally deficient sphincter and 53% for patients with an intact sphincter. 
Budget impact analysis showed that introducing SNM would have an estimated 
budget impact of 0.56% over 5 years on the budget allocated for fecal 
incontinence treatment.
CONCLUSION: Our data show SNM to be an efficient investment with an acceptable 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and a limited impact on the total allocated

BACKGROUND: Neonatal intensive care improves survival, but is associated with 
high costs and disability amongst survivors. Recent health reform in Mexico 
launched a new subsidized insurance program, necessitating informed choices on 
the different interventions that might be covered by the program, including 
neonatal intensive care. The purpose of this study was to estimate the clinical 
outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of neonatal intensive care in Mexico.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a 
decision analytic model of health and economic outcomes following preterm birth. 
Model parameters governing health outcomes were estimated from Mexican vital 
registration and hospital discharge databases, supplemented with meta-analyses 
and systematic reviews from the published literature. Costs were estimated on 
the basis of data provided by the Ministry of Health in Mexico and World Health 
Organization price lists, supplemented with published studies from other 
countries as needed. The model estimated changes in clinical outcomes, life 
expectancy, disability-free life expectancy, lifetime costs, disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for 
neonatal intensive care compared to no intensive care. Uncertainty around the 
results was characterized using one-way sensitivity analyses and a multivariate 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. In the base-case analysis, neonatal 
intensive care for infants born at 24-26, 27-29, and 30-33 weeks gestational age 
prolonged life expectancy by 28, 43, and 34 years and averted 9, 15, and 12 
DALYs, at incremental costs per infant of US$11,400, US$9,500, and US$3,000, 
respectively, compared to an alternative of no intensive care. The ICERs of 
neonatal intensive care at 24-26, 27-29, and 30-33 weeks were US$1,200, US$650, 
and US$240, per DALY averted, respectively. The findings were robust to 
variation in parameter values over wide ranges in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for neonatal intensive care 
imply very high value for money on the basis of conventional benchmarks for 
cost-effectiveness analysis. Please see later in the article for the Editors'

BACKGROUND: Malaria, an Anopheles-borne parasitic disease, remains a major 
global health problem causing illness and death that disproportionately affects 
developing countries. Despite the incidence of malaria, which remains one of the 
most severe infections of human populations, there is no licensed vaccine 
against this life-threatening disease. In this context, we decided to explore 
the expression of Plasmodium vaccine antigens fused to the granule bound starch 
synthase (GBSS), the major protein associated to the starch matrix in all 
starch-accumulating plants and algae such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We describe the development of genetically engineered 
starch granules containing plasmodial vaccine candidate antigens produced in the 
unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We show that the C-terminal 
domains of proteins from the rodent Plasmodium species, Plasmodium berghei 
Apical Major Antigen AMA1, or Major Surface Protein MSP1 fused to the algal 
granule bound starch synthase (GBSS) are efficiently expressed and bound to the 
polysaccharide matrix. Mice were either immunized intraperitoneally with the 
engineered starch particles and Freund adjuvant, or fed with the engineered 
particles co-delivered with the mucosal adjuvant, and challenged 
intraperitoneally with a lethal inoculum of P. Berghei. Both experimental 
strategies led to a significantly reduced parasitemia with an extension of life 
span including complete cure for intraperitoneal delivery as assessed by 
negative blood thin smears. In the case of the starch bound P. falciparum 
GBSS-MSP1 fusion protein, the immune sera or purified immunoglobulin G of mice 
immunized with the corresponding starch strongly inhibited in vitro the 
intra-erythrocytic asexual development of the most human deadly plasmodial 
species.
CONCLUSION: This novel system paves the way for the production of clinically 
relevant plasmodial antigens as algal starch-based particles designated herein 
as amylosomes, demonstrating that efficient production of edible vaccines can be 
genetically produced in Chlamydomonas.

Chemotherapy of metastatic colorectal cancer.

[No authors listed]

Without treatment, patients with inoperable or metastatic colorectal cancer have 
a median life expectancy of about 8 months. The following article is an update 
of our 2005 review of chemotherapy regimens used in metastatic colorectal 
cancer, based on the standard Prescrire methodology. In 2005, the de Gramont 
protocol, based on fluorouracil (always combined with folinic acid) plus either 
oxaliplatin (Folfox protocol) or irinotecan (Folfiri protocol), was the standard 
first-line chemotherapy in this setting. Four trials comparing monotherapy 
versus combination therapy in previously untreated patients showed that initial 
fluorouracil (or fluorouracil precursor) monotherapy, followed by the Folfox or 
Folfiri protocol in case of failure, was not associated with shorter overall 
survival. Two trials compared first-line treatment with the Folfiri regimen 
versus the Folfoxiri regimen (fluorouracil + oxaliplatin + irinotecan). One of 
these studies showed an increase in median survival with the Folfoxiri protocol 
(24 versus 17 months), but at a cost of greater neurotoxicity. The only tangible 
advantage of capecitabine and tegafur, two oral fluorouracil precursors, is 
their convenience of use. Pemetrexed was less effective and more toxic than the 
Folfiri protocol in one trial. Bevacizumab and panitumumab have yielded 
disappointing results in previously untreated patients. Neither of these 
monoclonal antibodies has yet been shown to improve overall survival. Three 
trials have assessed the addition of cetuximab to combinations consisting of 
fluorouracil or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin or irinotecan. In two of these 
trials, the median survival time of patients whose tumours carried the wild-type 
KRAS gene was about 3 months longer in the cetuximab arms, although the increase 
was statistically significant in only one trial. Cetuximab had no impact on 
survival time in the third trial. In two trials, an anti-EGFR antibody 
(panitumumab or cetuximab) reduced median survival when added to bevacizumab in 
previously untreated patients. When progression occurs after treatment with the 
Folfiri protocol (or equivalent), a combination of the Folfox protocol and 
bevacizumab seems to increase median survival time by about 2 months versus 
Folfox alone, but it is also more toxic. In patients who progress after 
receiving the fluorouracil + oxaliplatin combination (Folfox) or the 
fluorouracil+ irinotecan combination (Folfiri), neither panitumumab nor 
cetuximab has been shown to provide a clinically meaningful increase in overall 
survival. It remains to be shown whether these drugs are more effective in 
patients with the wild-type KRAS gene than in patients with KRAS mutations. In 
early 2010, the standard cytotoxic drugs for treatment of metastatic colorectal 
cancer are fluorouracil (combined with folinic acid), oxaliplatin and 
irinotecan. Initial combination therapy may be beneficial when the metastases 
are borderline operable. When the metastases are inoperable and are unlikely to 
become operable after chemotherapy, it seems best to begin treatment with 
single-agent fluorouracil (+ folinic acid) or capecitabine. The use of 
monoclonal antibodies in first-line treatment of patients with colorectal cancer 
is not justified. Further trials of these drugs are warranted as second-line 
treatment for patients with KRAS wild-type tumours.

In the Zollikon seminars Heidegger gave an extraordinary contribution to the 
phenomenological study of health and disease. Throughout his life, this was the 
only chance the philosopher had to deal in depth with these questions. Disease 
was then determined as an ontological privation of health. Heidegger, however, 
did not develop an explicit concept of health. The author intends to develop to 
their full consequences some theses expounded in these seminars taking as 
reference two determinations then sketched: the essence of human health is 
identical with Dasein's unfolding essence in its opening to being; any disease 
is a "limitation of the possibility of living".

e Mucuri, Diamantina, MG, Brasil.

BACKGROUND: cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of permanent disorders of the 
development of movement and posture that cause functional limitation and are 
attributed to non-progressive disorders which occur in the fetal or infant 
brain. In recent years, with the increase in life expectancy of individuals with 
CP, several studies have described the impact of musculoskeletal disabilities 
and functional limitations over the life cycle.
OBJECTIVE: to characterize adults with CP through sociodemographic information, 
classifications, general health, associated conditions, physical complications 
and locomotion.
METHODS: twenty-two adults with CP recruited from local rehabilitation centers 
in an inner town of Brazil participated in this study. A questionnaire was used 
to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics, comorbities, and physical 
complications. A brief physical therapy evaluation was carried out, and the 
Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and the Manual Ability 
Classification System (MACS) were applied. Data were analyzed through 
descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: the mean age was 28.7 (SD 10.6) years, 86.4% of participants lived with 
parents, and 4.5% were employed. Most of the sample consisted of spastic 
quadriplegic subjects, corresponding to levels IV and V of the GMFCS and MACS. 
Different comorbidities and important physical complications such as scoliosis 
and muscle contractures were present. More than half of the participants were 
unable to walk.
CONCLUSIONS: Most participants demonstrated important restrictions in social 
participation and lower educational level. Adults with CP can be affected by 
several physical complications and progressive limitations in gait.

effectiveness and suitability.

Bignami 1, Milan, Italy. cristoforo.incorvaia@gmail.com

Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) was introduced in the treatment of respiratory 
allergy as an option to subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), which is clinically 
effective but has the problem of adverse systemic reactions, quite rare but 
sometimes life-threatening. A large number of trials, globally evaluated in 
several meta-analyses, demonstrated that SLIT is an efficacious treatment for 
allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma and has a satisfactory safety profile, 
severe reactions being extremely rare, though an increased risk is apparent in 
subjects undergoing SLIT because of previous systemic reactions to SCIT. The 
suitability of SLIT is ensured by a good compliance, higher than reported for 
SCIT, the injections being a major factor for noncompliance with the latter, and 
by its cost-effectiveness performances. In fact, a number of studies showed that 
SLIT may be very beneficial to the healthcare system, especially after its 
stopping, when there is no more the cost of the treatment but its efficacy on 
symptoms persists.

Rescuing the drowned: cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the origins of emergency 
medicine in the eighteenth century.

The concept of a medical emergency, i.e., a time when immediate action is 
required to stabilize and restore the vital functions, is absent in the 
tradition of ancient medicine, which seeks to cure the sick. The theoretical and 
conceptual development of a prompt medical assistance definitely owes much to 
the refinement of instruments and surgical techniques that were develop in the 
early modern age, allowing the extension of therapeutic action to "healthy" 
individuals who are suddenly life-threatened due to an accident or to some 
external events that affect their vital functions. But it is especially in the 
eighteenth century that the epistemic basis of medical emergency is structured, 
when the Enlightenment gave rise to the ethical and political imperative of 
public assistance that required the planning of first aid at multiple levels, 
and medicine developed the concept of life-saving treatment. In particular, 
eighteenth century medicine, studying systems to assure immediate relief to the 
victims of accidents-especially to the drowned-allowed the development of 
specific and methodological systems of resuscitation and emergency treatment.

[Amenable mortality in Germany: spatial distribution and regional

AIM: The aim of this study is to identify small areas in Germany burdened by 
exceptionally high rates of amenable mortality using the 439 counties as unit of 
analysis.
METHODS: To overcome shortcomings of conventional mortality measures, we 
construct an indicator for amenable mortality (AM) which captures deaths that 
should not occur given current medical knowledge and technology. We 
age-standardize individual-level data on mortality for the years 2000-2004 and 
plot the distribution of disease-specific AM on country maps. We consider deaths 
following ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, 
diseases of the liver, traffic accidents, several cancer types and 24 other 
diseases that are classified as amenable to health care. The data is taken from 
the causes-of-death statistics (provided by Destatis).
RESULTS: AM significantly differs between small areas within and between German 
federal states (Bundeslaender). Breast cancer and lung cancer in men are the 
most common AM-causes in Germany. The often discussed mortality-gap between East 
and West Germany is predominantly driven by differences in amenable deaths 
following cardiovascular diseases. However, the maps of most carcinogenic deaths 
show a north-south gradient rather than an east-west difference.

INTRODUCTION: Darunavir is a new protease inhibitor (PI) that is co-administered 
with low-dose ritonavir and has demonstrated substantial efficacy in clinical 
trials of highly treatment-experienced patients when combined with an optimized 
background regimen (with or without enfuvirtide). This study estimates the cost 
effectiveness of darunavir with ritonavir (DRV/r) in this population over 5-year 
and lifetime time horizons in the USA.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to follow a treatment-experienced HIV-1 cohort 
through six health states, based on CD4 cell count: greater than 500, 351-500, 
201-350, 101-200, 51-100 and 0-50 cells/mm³, and death. The magnitude of the CD4 
cell count increase and duration of increasing and stable periods were derived 
from week 48 DRV/r clinical trial results (POWER 1 and 2). The treatment pathway 
assumed one regimen switch following treatment failure on the initial regimen. 
The use of antiretroviral drugs was based on usage in DRV/r clinical trials. US 
daily wholesale acquisition costs were calculated using the recommended daily 
doses. For each CD4 cell count range, utility values, HIV-1-related mortality 
rates and costs for medical resources (other than antiretroviral drug costs) 
were obtained from published literature. Non-HIV-1-related mortality rates were 
calculated by applying a relative risk value to the US general population age 
and gender-specific mortality rates. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% 
per year. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and variability 
analysis were performed.
RESULTS: In a 5-year analysis, patients receiving DRV/r experienced 3.80 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incurred total medical costs of 
US$217,288, while those receiving control PIs experienced 3.60 QALYs and 
incurred costs of US$218,962. DRV/r was both more effective and less costly than 
control PIs. For the lifetime analysis, the QALYs and lifetime medical costs 
with DRV/r were 10.03 and US$565,358, compared with 8.76 and US$527,287 with 
control PIs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for DRV/r compared with 
control PIs was US$30,046. One-way sensitivity analyses for both time horizons 
indicated that the results were most sensitive to changes in the rate of CD4 
cell count change during stable and declining periods (lifetime only), duration 
of stable period (5-year only) and HIV-1-related mortality rates. The results of 
the variability analysis were most sensitive to the model time horizon. 
Nevertheless, for all ranges and scenarios tested in these analyses, the 
incremental cost per QALY gained remained below US$50,000. The probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis showed that there was a 0.921 and 0.950 probability of a 
cost-effectiveness ratio below US$50,000 per QALY for the 5-year and lifetime 
time horizon, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: DRV/r is predicted to be cost effective compared with control PI in 
highly treatment-experienced patients and is predicted to yield an average of 
0.20 additional QALYs per treatment-experienced patient over 5 years and 1.27 
additional QALYs over a lifetime in this population.

inhibitor-experienced, HIV-1-infected adults in Belgium, Italy, Sweden and the 
UK.

BACKGROUND: Two phase II trials (POWER 1 and 2) have demonstrated that darunavir 
co-administered with low-dose ritonavir (DRV/r) provides significant clinical 
benefit compared with control protease inhibitors (PIs) in highly 
treatment-experienced, HIV-1-infected adults, when co-administered with 
optimized background therapy (OBR).
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether DRV/r is cost effective compared with control 
PIs, from the perspective of Belgian, Italian, Swedish and UK reimbursement 
authorities, when used in treatment-experienced patients similar to those 
included in the POWER 1 and 2 trials.
METHODS: An existing Markov model containing health states defined by CD4 cell 
count ranges (> 500, 351-500, 201-350, 101-200, 51-100 and 0-50 cells/mm³) and 
death was adapted for use in four European healthcare settings. Baseline 
demographics, CD4 cell count distribution and antiretroviral drug usage 
reflected those reported in the POWER 1 and 2 trials. Virological/immunological 
response rates and matching transition probabilities over the patient's lifetime 
were based on results from the POWER trials and published data. After treatment 
failure, patients were assumed to switch to a tipranavir-containing regimen plus 
OBR. For each CD4 cell count range, utility values and HIV-related mortality 
rates were obtained from the published literature. National all-cause mortality 
data and published data on the increased risk of non HIV-related mortality in 
HIV-infected individuals were taken into account in the model. Data from 
observational studies conducted in each healthcare setting were used to 
determine resource-use patterns and costs associated with each CD4 cell count 
range. Unit costs were derived from official local sources; a lifetime horizon 
was taken and discount rates were selected based on local guidelines.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains of 
up to 1.397 in Belgium, over 1.171 in Italy, 1.142 in Sweden and 1.091 in the UK 
were predicted when DRV/r-based therapy was used instead of control PI-based 
treatment. The base-case analyses predicted an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of €11,438/QALY in Belgium, €12,122/QALY in Italy,€10,942/QALY in 
Sweden and €16,438/QALY in the UK. Assuming an acceptability threshold of 
€30,000/QALY, DRV/r-based therapy remained cost effective over all parameter 
ranges tested in extensive one-way sensitivity analyses. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis revealed a 95% (Belgium), 97% (Italy), 92% (Sweden) or 78% 
(UK) probability of attaining an ICER below this threshold.
CONCLUSION: From four European payer perspectives, DRV/r-based antiretroviral 
therapy is predicted to be cost effective compared with currently available 
control PIs, when both are used with an OBR in treatment-experienced, 
HIV-1-infected adults who failed to respond to more than one PI-containing 
regimen.

INTRODUCTION: The phase III TITAN trial evaluated the use of darunavir with 
low-dose ritonavir (DRV/r) 600/100 mg twice daily (bid) compared with lopinavir 
with low-dose ritonavir (LPV/r) in treatment-experienced, lopinavir-naive 
patients. This study estimates the cost effectiveness of DRV/r from a US 
societal perspective when compared with LPV/r in treatment-experienced patients
