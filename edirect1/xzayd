Eight substances that are main components of the essential oils from three 
Mediterranean aromatic plants (Verbena officinalis, Thymus vulgaris and Origanum 
vulgare), previously found active against some phytopathogenic Fungi and 
Stramenopila, have been tested in vitro against five etiological agents of 
post-harvest fruit decay, Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium italicum, P. expansum, 
Phytophthora citrophthora and Rhizopus stolonifer. The tested compounds were 
β-fellandrene, β-pinene, camphene, carvacrol, citral, o-cymene, γ-terpinene and 
thymol. Citral exhibited a fungicidal action against P. citrophthora; carvacrol 
and thymol showed a fungistatic activity against P. citrophthora and R. 
stolonifer. Citral and carvacrol at 250 ppm, and thymol at 150 and 250 ppm 
stopped the growth of B. cinerea. Moreover, thymol showed fungistatic and 
fungicidal action against P. italicum. Finally, the mycelium growth of P. 
expansum was inhibited in the presence of 250 ppm of thymol and carvacrol. These 
results represent an important step toward the goal to use some essential oils 
or their components as natural preservatives for fruits and foodstuffs, due to 
their safety for consumer healthy and positive effect on shelf life extension of 
agricultural fresh products.

Osteoporosis is a frequent disease characterized by a high morbidity. Also a 
high rate of death has ben demonstrated for hip fractures and to a lesser extent 
for vertebral fractures. In the early 90s all the publications showed that the 
burden of fractures due to osteoporosis (and particularly hip fractures) would 
dramatically increase due to an incresed secular trend for the end of the Second 
World War and also due to the increase of life expectancy. However several 
epidemiological studies done in the USA but also in Europe (Scandinavian 
countries but also France) showed that the incidence of fractures and 
particularly hip fractures decreased over time. The hypotheses leading to these 
findings are not fully elucidated. Obviously the development of DXA scans and 
the use of bisphosphonates since the middle of the 90s played a role. Also the 
improvement of lifestyle and the decrease in the use of tobacco and alcohol also 
play a role for explaining these findings. Although these data are very 
encouraging, osteoporosis is still a severe disease characterized by a high rate 
of death. This latter point was demonstrated for hip and vertebral factures but 
also for all the major fractures.

OBJECTIVE: With increasing healthcare resource constraints, it has become 
important to understand the incremental cost-effectiveness of new medicines. 
Subcutaneous denosumab is superior to intravenous zoledronic acid (ZA) for the 
prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with advanced solid 
tumors and bone metastases. This study sought to determine the lifetime 
cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs ZA in this setting, from a US managed-care 
perspective.
METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was developed, with relative rate reductions in 
SREs for denosumab vs ZA derived from three pivotal Phase 3 trials involving 
patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), breast cancer, and 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and bone metastases. The real-world SRE 
rates in ZA-treated patients were derived from a large commercial database. SRE 
and treatment administration quality-adjusted life year (QALY) decrements were 
estimated with time-trade-off studies. SRE costs were estimated from a 
nationally representative commercial claims database. Drug, drug administration, 
and renal monitoring costs were included. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% 
annually. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Across tumor types, denosumab was associated with a reduced number of 
SREs, increased QALYs, and increased lifetime total costs vs ZA. The costs per 
QALY gained for denosumab vs ZA in CRPC, breast cancer, and NSCLC were $49,405, 
$78,915, and $67,931, respectively, commonly considered good value in the US. 
Costs per SRE avoided were $8567, $13,557, and $10,513, respectively. Results 
were sensitive to drug costs and SRE rates.
LIMITATIONS: Differences in pain severity and analgesic use favoring denosumab 
over ZA were not captured. Mortality was extrapolated from fitted generalized 
gamma function beyond the trial duration.
CONCLUSION: Denosumab is a cost-effective treatment option for the prevention of 
SREs in patients with advanced solid tumors and bone metastases compared to ZA. 
The overall value of denosumab is based on superior efficacy, favorable safety, 
and more efficient administration.

Cost effectiveness of pharmacological maintenance treatment for chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease: a review of the evidence and methodological 
issues.

BACKGROUND: Over 200 million people have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) worldwide. The number of disease-year equivalents and deaths attributable 
to COPD are high. Guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of the disease 
recommend an individualized step-up approach in which treatment is intensified 
when results are unsatisfactory.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to present a systematic review of the cost 
effectiveness of pharmacological maintenance treatment for COPD and to discuss 
the methodological strengths and weaknesses of the studies.
METHODS: A systematic literature search for economic evaluations of drug therapy 
in COPD was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Economic Evaluation Database of 
the UK NHS (NHS-EED) and the European Network of Health Economic Evaluation 
Databases (EURONHEED). Full economic evaluations presenting both costs and 
health outcomes were included.
RESULTS: A total of 40 studies were included in the review. Of these, 16 were 
linked to a clinical trial, 14 used Markov models, eight were based on 
observational data and two used a different approach. The few studies on 
combining short-acting bronchodilators were consistent in finding net cost 
savings compared with monotherapy. Studies comparing inhaled corticosteroids 
(ICS) with placebo or no maintenance treatment reported inconsistent results. 
Studies comparing fluticasone with salmeterol consistently found salmeterol to 
be more cost effective. The cost-effectiveness studies of tiotropium versus 
placebo, ipratropium or salmeterol pointed towards a reduction in total 
COPD-related healthcare costs for tiotropium in many but not all studies. All of 
these studies reported additional health benefits of tiotropium. The 
cost-effectiveness studies of the combination of inhaled long-acting β₂-agonists 
and ICS all report additional health benefits at an increase in total 
COPD-related costs in most studies. The cost-per-QALY estimates of this 
combination treatment vary widely and are very sensitive to the assumptions on 
mortality benefit and time horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: The currently available economic evaluations indicate differences 
in cost effectiveness between COPD maintenance therapies, but for a more 
meaningful comparison of results it is important to improve the consistency with 
respect to study methodology and choice of comparator.

(1)Department of Physiotherapy, Melbourne School of Health Sciences, University 
of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize changes in gait by age in patients with Dravet 
syndrome.
DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Tertiary children's hospital.
PATIENTS: Twenty-six subjects with Dravet syndrome, aged 2 to 34 years. 
Twenty-three patients had mutations of the sodium channel α1 subunit gene, 
SCN1A.
INTERVENTIONS: Assessment via video gait analysis, physical examination of the 
lower limbs, use of the Functional Mobility Scale, and radiographs of the pelvis 
and feet.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Classification of the sagittal gait pattern and foot 
posture, assessment of muscle extensibility and joint range, and rating of 
functional mobility.
RESULTS: Children aged 0 to 5 years had a normal or near-normal gait, whereas 5 
of 10 children aged 6 to 12 years and 8 of 9 children aged 13 years or older had 
crouch gait. Physical examination showed that with increasing age, passive knee 
extension (P = .008) and hip extension (P = .003) decreased, external tibial 
torsion (P = .007) and pes planovalgus (P = .05) increased, and increased hip 
internal rotation did not show age-related change (P = .27). The Functional 
Mobility Scale showed universal independent walking over 5 and 50 m; however, 
adolescents showed wide variation in their ratings over 500 m, indicating 
mobility ranging from wheelchair use to independent walking (P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Children with Dravet syndrome show progressive gait deterioration 
in the second decade of life, with crouch gait and skeletal malalignment 
comprising increased femoral neck anteversion, external tibial torsion, and pes 
valgus. These age-related changes have a significant impact on mobility and 
independence in the community setting.

Gait analysis has been used to measure gait adaptations following total hip 
replacement (THR) for many years. In this time, advances have been made in 
implant technology and surgical procedure. However, gait adaptations persist 
after surgery. This review of seven published studies, where gait 
characteristics were compared between post-operative THR patients and healthy 
controls, had the objective of investigating current practice in gait analysis 
of this patient population and to determine if there is a consensus on 
post-operative gait changes associated with THR. Levels of methodological 
quality and study design were found to be variable. Meta-analyses were performed 
on all gait variables reported by at least three studies to determine overall 
Cohen's d effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals. Reductions in walking 
velocity (d=-0.79; CI=-1.54, -0.04), stride length (d=-1.06; CI=-1.62, -0.49) 
and sagittal hip range of motion (d=-1.58; CI=-2.12, -1.04) were observed. 
Increases in peak hip flexion (d=0.52; CI=-0.01, 1.09) and extension (d=0.54; 
CI=-0.10, 1.09) moments were found, although these were likely to be of less 
clinical significance. Reduced peak hip abduction was also observed (d=-0.58; 
CI=-1.09, -0.06). Future developments in THR technology and surgical methods 
should therefore aim to reduce the differences between patients and controls in 
terms of walking velocity, stride length, hip range of motion and hip abduction 
moments.

    CMAJ. 2012 Sep 18;184(13):1499.

BACKGROUND: Although diacetylmorphine has been proven to be more effective than 
methadone maintenance treatment for opioid dependence, its direct costs are 
higher. We compared the cost-effectiveness of diacetylmorphine and methadone 
maintenance treatment for chronic opioid dependence refractory to treatment.
METHODS: We constructed a semi-Markov cohort model using data from the North 
American Opiate Medication Initiative trial, supplemented with administrative 
data for the province of British Columbia and other published data, to capture 
the chronic, recurrent nature of opioid dependence. We calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios to compare diacetylmorphine and methadone over 1-, 5-, 
10-year and lifetime horizons.
RESULTS: Diacetylmorphine was found to be a dominant strategy over methadone 
maintenance treatment in each of the time horizons. Over a lifetime horizon, our 
model showed that people receiving methadone gained 7.46 discounted 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) on average (95% credibility interval [CI] 
6.91-8.01) and generated a societal cost of $1.14 million (95% CI $736,800-$1.78 
million). Those who received diacetylmorphine gained 7.92 discounted QALYs on 
average (95% CI 7.32-8.53) and generated a societal cost of $1.10 million (95% 
CI $724,100-$1.71 million). Cost savings in the diacetylmorphine cohort were 
realized primarily because of reductions in the costs related to criminal 
activity. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of 
diacetylmorphine being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $0 
per QALY gained was 76%; the probability was 95% at a threshold of $100,000 per 
QALY gained. Results were confirmed over a range of sensitivity analyses.
INTERPRETATION: Using mathematical modelling to extrapolate results from the 
North American Opiate Medication Initiative, we found that diacetylmorphine may 
be more effective and less costly than methadone among people with chronic 
opioid dependence refractory to treatment.

Forecasting lifetime and aggregate long-term care spending: accounting for 
changing disability patterns.

OBJECTIVE: The impact population aging exerts on future levels of long-term care 
(LTC) spending is an urgent topic in which few studies have accounted for 
disability trends. We forecast individual lifetime and population aggregate 
annual LTC spending for the Dutch 55+ population to 2030 accounting for changing 
disability patterns.
METHODS: Three levels of (dis)ability were distinguished: none, mild, and 
severe. Two-part models were used to estimate LTC spending as a function of age, 
sex, and disability status. A multistate life table model was used to forecast 
age-specific prevalence of disability and life expectancy (LE) in each 
disability state. Finally, 2-part model estimates and multistate projections 
were combined to obtain forecasts of LTC expenditures.
RESULTS: LE is expected to increase, whereas life years in severe disability 
remain constant, resulting in a relative compression of severe disability. Mild 
disability life years increase, especially for women. Lifetime homecare 
spending--mainly determined by mild disability--increases, whereas institutional 
spending remains fairly constant due to stable LE with severe disability. 
Lifetime LTC expenditures, largely determined by institutional spending, are 
thus hardly influenced by increasing LE. Aggregate spending for the 55+ 
population is expected to rise by 56.0% in the period of 2007-2030.
CONCLUSIONS: Longevity gains accompanied by a compression of severe disability 
will not seriously increase lifetime spending. The growth of the elderly cohort, 
however, will considerably increase aggregate spending. Stimulating a 
compression of disability is among the main solutions to alleviate the 
consequences of longevity gains and population aging to growth of LTC spending.

Systemic mastocytosis in adults: 2012 Update on diagnosis, risk stratification, 
and management.

Pardanani A(1).

Minnesota, USA. pardanani.animesh@mayo.edu

DISEASE OVERVIEW: Systemic mastocytosis (SM) results from a clonal proliferation 
of abnormal mast cells (MC) in one or more extra-cutaneous organs.
DIAGNOSIS: The major criterion is presence of multifocal clusters of 
morphologically abnormal MC in the bone marrow. Minor diagnostic criteria 
include elevated serum tryptase level, abnormal MC expression of CD25 and/or 
CD2, and presence of KITD816V.
RISK STRATIFICATION: The prognostic relevance of the 2008 World Health 
Organization (WHO) classification of SM has recently been confirmed. 
Classification of SM patients into indolent (SM), aggressive SM (ASM), SM 
associated with a clonal non-MC lineage disease (SM-AHNMD) and mast cell 
leukemia (MCL) subgroups is a useful first step in establishing prognosis.
MANAGEMENT: SM treatment is generally palliative. ISM patients have a normal 
life expectancy and receive symptom-directed therapy; infrequently, 
cytoreductive therapy may be indicated for refractory symptoms. ASM patients 
have disease-related organ dysfunction; interferon-α (±corticosteroids) can 
control dermatological, hematological, gastrointestinal, skeletal, and 
mediator-release symptoms, but is hampered by poor tolerability. Similarly, 
cladribine has broad therapeutic activity, with particular utility when rapid MC 
debulking is indicated; the main toxicity is myelosuppression. Imatinib has a 
therapeutic role in the presence of an imatinib-sensitive KIT mutation or in 
KITD816-unmutated patients. Treatment of SM-AHNMD is governed primarily by the 
non-MC neoplasm; hydroxyurea has modest utility in this setting.
INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS: Dasatinib's in vitro anti-KITD816V activity has not 
translated into significant therapeutic activity in most SM patients. In 
contrast, preliminary data suggest that Midostaurin may produce significant 
decreases in MC burden in some patients.

Socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors for mortality: do risk factors 
observed after spinal cord injury parallel those from the general USA 
population?

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of demographic, behavioral and 
socioeconomic factors with all-cause mortality while controlling for health 
status among a cohort of participants with severe disability related to spinal 
cord injury (SCI).
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Data were analyzed at a major medical university in the Southeast 
United States of America.
METHODS: Participants included 1361 adults with traumatic SCI of at least 1-year 
duration who were recruited through a large specialty hospital in the Southeast 
United States of America. Three Cox proportional hazard models were generated 
relating the predictors to all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Age, disability, smoking and income were significant in the final 
model. Both current (hazard ratio (HR)=2.03, 95% confidence interval 
(CI)=1.46-2.82) and former smokers (HR=1.58, CI=1.16-2.16) were at elevated 
hazard of mortality, as were those with incomes below $10,000 (HR=2.29, 
CI=1.53-3.44) and between $10,000 and $35,000 (HR=1.47, CI=1.03-2.10).
CONCLUSIONS: Even after controlling for health and severity of disability, the 
coefficients for smoking and income were significant, exceeding that reported 
previously within the general population. The importance of these factors may be 
magnified after severe disability, even though life expectancy is already 
greatly diminished in this population.

Neuroblastoma is a common childhood malignant tumor originated from the neural 
crest-derived sympathetic nervous system. A crucial early event in neuroblastoma 
pathogenesis is arrested differentiation of neuroblasts at various stages. 
Treatment of neuroblastoma with TPA and PDGF-BB leads to terminal 
differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. However, the signaling pathways that are 
involved in this process remain largely unknown. Here, we report that inhibition 
of endogenous FOXO proteins attenuated TPA/PDGF-BB mediated differentiation of 
neuroblastoma cells. Activated FOXO transcription factors acted on PDGFRA 
promoter to direct its basal mRNA expression as well as its induction upon serum 
deprivation. Depletion of endogenous PDGFRA in neuroblastoma cells significantly 
diminished neurite formation and extension under TPA/PDGF-BB treatment. 
Furthermore, ectopic expression of PDGFRA abolished the blockage of 
neuroblastoma differentiation by FOXOs inhibition. These findings define the 
FOXO-PDGFRA axis as crucial mechanistic components that govern TPA-induced 
neuroblastoma differentiation.

In high-income countries, the large availability of coagulation factors for 
replacement therapy of patients with hemophilia A has raised the life expectancy 
of these lifelong bleeders to that of males from the general population. The 
practicing clinician is offered a multitude of choices among several commercial 
brands of factor VIII extracted from human plasma or engineered from mammalian 
cell cultures by means of recombinant DNA technology. This article has the goal 
to offer our opinions on how to choose among the different products, that we 
consider interchangeable relevant to their clinical efficacy in the control of 
bleeding and safety from pathogen transmission. Hence, the main determinants of 
our choices are price and the risk of occurrence of factor VIII inhibitory 
alloantibodies. With this as background, we present the rationale underlying the 
choices for different categories of patients with severe hemophilia A: 
previously untreated patients, multiply treated patients, and patients 
undergoing immune tolerance induction with large doses of factor VIII to 
eradicate inhibitors. Mention is also made to the possible strategies that 
should be implemented to make available coagulation factors for replacement 
therapy in developing countries.

USA. zaloshn@pire.org

OBJECTIVE: Estimate the annual US incidence and cost of fatal and nonfatal youth 
injury in agricultural settings.
METHODS: We used 2001-2006 Childhood Agricultural Injury Survey data to estimate 
the incidence of nonfatal injury and 2001-2006 Multiple Cause of Death data to 
estimate the incidence of fatal injury. To estimate the costs for injuries 
suffered by youth working/living in agricultural settings, we multiplied the 
number of injuries times published unit costs by body part, nature of injury, 
and age group.
RESULTS: An average of 26 655 agricultural injury incidents occurred annually to 
youth (ages 0-19) in the United States during the period 2001-2006 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 24 263-29 046). These injuries cost society an 
estimated $1.423 billion per year in 2005 dollars (95% CI: $1.333 billion-$1.513 
billion). Fatalities alone cost an estimated $420 million per year. Work related 
injuries annually cost $347 million or 24.4% of the total cost (95% CI: 
20.3%-28.5%). Most agricultural youth injuries were not work related.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that, similarly to adult agricultural injuries, youth 
agricultural injuries tend to be more severe and more costly than 
nonagricultural injuries. Only 1.4% of injured youth in the United States were 
hospitalized in 2000, but 14% of youth injured in agriculture were hospitalized 
in 2001-2006. To address this serious problem, prevention should focus on better 
controlling both child access to agricultural recreational activities and child

BACKGROUND: Current US guidelines recommend limiting hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
screening to high-risk individuals, and 50%-75% of infected persons remain 
unaware of their status.
METHODS: To estimate the cost-effectiveness and population-level impact of 
adding one-time HCV screening of US population aged 20-69 years to current 
guidelines, we developed a decision analytic model for the screening 
intervention and Markov model with annual transitions to estimate natural 
history. Subanalyses included protease inhibitor therapy and screening those at 
highest risk of infection (birth year 1945-1965). We relied on published 
literature and took a lifetime, societal perspective.
RESULTS: Compared to current guidelines, incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life year gained (ICER) was $7900 for general population screening and $4200 for 
screening by birth year, which dominated general population screening if cost, 
clinician uptake, and median age of diagnoses were assumed equivalent. General 
population screening remained cost-effective in all one-way sensitivity 
analyses, 30 000 Monte Carlo simulations, and scenarios in which background 
mortality was doubled, all genotype 1 patients were treated with protease 
inhibitors, and most parameters were set unfavorable to increased screening. 
ICER was lowest if screening was applied to a population with liver fibrosis 
similar to 2010 estimates. Approximately 1% of liver-related deaths would be 
averted per 15% of the general population screened; the impact would be greater 
with improved referral, treatment uptake, and cure.
CONCLUSIONS: Broader screening for HCV would likely be cost-effective, but 
significantly reducing HCV-related morbidity and mortality would also require 
improved rates of referral, treatment, and cure.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of biphasic insulin lispro mix 
75/25 (LM75/25) and mix 50/50 (LM50/50) compared with a long-acting analog 
insulin (LAAI) regimen from the perspective of a US healthcare payer.
METHODS: A published computer simulation model of diabetes was used to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of LM75/25 and LM50/50 vs a LAAI (insulin glargine) from 
the perspective of a US healthcare payer. Treatment effects in terms of HbA1c 
benefits were taken from a recent meta-analysis. Direct medical costs including 
pharmacy, complication, and patient management costs were obtained from 
published sources. All costs were expressed in 2010 US dollars and future costs 
and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% per annum. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: LM75/25 and LM50/50 were associated with improvements in life 
expectancy of 0.08 and 0.09 years, improvements in quality-adjusted life 
expectancy of 0.07 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 0.08 QALYs and 
increases in cost of US$ 1724 and US$ 1720, respectively, when compared with 
LAAI.
LIMITATIONS: The base case analysis did not capture mild or serious hypoglycemia 
on the grounds that the hypoglycemia rate odds ratios failed to reach 
statistical significance in the meta-analysis. In addition, the baseline cohort 
characteristics were based on an insulin-naïve population, as opposed to the 
cohorts in the meta-analysis, which were heterogeneous with regard to insulin 
treatment history.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on a recently published meta-analysis, biphasic analog 
insulins are likely to improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs vs LAAIs in 
the long-term treatment of type 2 diabetes patients in the US.

Survival estimates for elite male and female Olympic athletes and tennis 
championship competitors.

In this paper, we report survival estimates for male and female Olympic medal 
winners and for male and female finalists at the British and U S national tennis 
championships. We find a consistent longevity advantage of Olympic medal-winning 
female athletes over Olympic medal-winning male athletes competing separately in 
the same events since 1900 and for female finalists over male finalists 
competing separately in the finals of the national tennis championships of 
Britain and of the United States since the 1880s. This is the case for sample 
mean comparisons, for Kaplan-Meier survival function estimates, including life 
expectancy, and for Cox proportional hazard estimates, which show statistically 
significant lower hazard rates for women with birth year and other variables 
constant. The female longevity advantage over males is similar in the early 
period samples (birth years before 1920) and in the full period samples, and is 
5-7 years.

Modelling reproduction of Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae): 
climate change may modify pest incidence levels.

Temperature is considered to be an important abiotic factor influencing insect 
reproduction. Despite the importance of Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: 
Plutellidae) as a pest of brassicaceous crops worldwide, the effects of 
temperature on its reproduction are not well understood. We evaluated the effect 
of constant temperatures ranging from 10 to 32.5°C on the reproduction of P. 
xylostella and developed an oviposition model for the species. The model 
combined temperature-dependent parameters of total fecundity, age-specific 
oviposition rate and age-specific survival. Additionally, we modelled population 
growth as a function of temperature. The estimated parameters allowed us to 
discuss the possible consequences of global warming on P. xylostella 
distribution. Temperature affected the length of pre-oviposition after adult 
emergence, oviposition period, longevity, total fecundity and egg viability. The 
model predicted that both daily egg production and length of oviposition period 
decreased at temperatures below 15°C and above 25°C. Population growth increased 
linearly with temperature in a range from 10°C to 25°C; however, the model 
predicted a reduction in population growth at temperatures above 28.6°C. Data 
suggested that temperature plays a critical role in P. xylostella reproduction, 
and subtle differences in average temperature could have an impact on its 
population growth. This is especially important in the context of global climate 
change, which in turn could alter the distribution and abundance of the pest in 
some regions of the world.

specialist practice.

BACKGROUND: Successful periodontal treatment requires a commitment to regular 
lifelong maintenance and may be perceived by patients to be costly. This study 
calculates the total lifetime cost of periodontal treatment in the setting of a 
specialist periodontal practice and investigates the cost implications of 
choosing not to proceed with such treatment.
METHODS: Data from patients treated in a specialist practice in Norway were used 
to calculate the total lifetime cost of periodontal treatment that included 
baseline periodontal treatment, regular maintenance, retreatment, and replacing 
teeth lost during maintenance. Incremental costs for alternative strategies 
based on opting to forego periodontal treatment or maintenance and to replace 
any teeth lost with either bridgework or implants were calculated.
RESULTS: Patients who completed baseline periodontal treatment but did not have 
any additional maintenance or retreatment could replace only three teeth with 
bridgework or two teeth with implants before the cost of replacing additional 
teeth would exceed the cost of lifetime periodontal treatment. Patients who did 
not have any periodontal treatment could replace ≤ 4 teeth with bridgework or 
implants before a replacement strategy became more expensive.
CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of the assumptions made, periodontal treatment in 
a Norwegian specialist periodontal practice is cost-effective when compared to 
an approach that relies on opting to replace teeth lost as a result of 
progressive periodontitis with fixed restorations. In particular, patients who 
have initial comprehensive periodontal treatment but do not subsequently comply 
with maintenance could, on average, replace ≤ 3 teeth with bridgework or two 
teeth with implants before this approach would exceed the direct cost of 
lifetime periodontal treatment in the setting of the specialist practice 
studied.

HAART has increased the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals 
significantly. Optimal adherence to HAART results in viral suppression and 
immune recovery in the majority of HIV-infected persons. Data from the early 
HAART era suggest that adherence levels of greater than 95% are necessary to 
achieve and maintain virological suppression. However, the optimal threshold of 
adherence required to maximize the pharmacological benefits of contemporary 
antiretroviral regimens, particularly in the virologically suppressed patient, 
is unknown. This review examines new data on the role of adherence in the late 
HAART era, focusing on virological, immunological and epidemiological aspects. 
We begin with a discussion of the impact of adherence on viral dynamics and 
immunological parameters in the virologically suppressed patient. We then review 
the importance of adherence in emerging antiretroviral treatment strategies. 
Finally, we summarize accumulating data on the role of antiretroviral adherence 
in the prevention of HIV transmission. Taken together, the data reviewed 
reinforce the critical importance of adherence in the management of HIV 
infection in the late HAART era.

Sciences University, Tuticorin 628 008, India. ttnjerosh99@bsni.in

Microbiological quality of cuttlefish (Sepia pharaonis) fillets stored in three 
different ice conditions was studied. Fillets stored in wet ice at a ratio of 
1:1 (package III) were sensorially acceptable for only 18 h, while that stored 
in dry ice at 1:1 (package I) and combination of dry ice and wet ice at 
1:0.2:0.5 (package II) were in acceptable condition up to 24 h without re-icing 
and thus there was an extension of shelf life by about 33%. Total bacterial load 
was 7 log₁₀ cfu/g at the end of the storage period. Total psychrophilic 
population increased from zero to 7 log₁₀ cfu/g while total lactic acid bacteria 
from zero to 5 log₁₀ cfu/g. H₂S producers were detected only at 18 h, with a 
count of 1 log₁₀ cfu/g. Sulphite-reducing Clostridia increased gradually from 
zero to 110 most probable number count/g. Fresh cuttlefish fillets carried a 
bacterial flora of Micrococcus, Planococcus, Streptococcus, Moraxella, Proteus 
and Aeromonas. Pseudomonas was dominant in wet ice pack, while Aeromonas was 
dominant in both the dry ice and combination pack. Immediately after packing, 
the temperatures recorded in packages I, II and III were 10.5, 1.2 and 3.0 °C, 
respectively, which drastically decreased in 1 h and then maintained and finally 
increased gradually. The results indicate that use of combination of dry ice and 
wet ice is economical and very much useful to seafood industries, as this 
package considerably reduced the cost of air freight, as well as improved the 
quality and shelf life of cuttlefish.

of Life Science, Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410081, China.

To promote spinosad biosynthesis by improving the limited oxygen supply during 
high-density fermentation of Saccharopolyspora spinosa, the open reading frame 
of the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene was placed under the control of the promoter 
for the erythromycin resistance gene by splicing using overlapping extension 
PCR. This was cloned into the integrating vector pSET152, yielding the 
Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene expression plasmid pSET152EVHB. This was then 
introduced into S. spinosa SP06081 by conjugal transfer, and integrated into the 
chromosome by site-specific recombination at the integration site ΦC31 on 
pSET152EVHB. The resultant conjugant, S. spinosa S078-1101, was genetically 
stable. The integration was further confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting 
analysis. A carbon monoxide differential spectrum assay showed that active 
Vitreoscilla hemoglobin was successfully expressed in S. spinosa S078-1101. 
Fermentation results revealed that expression of the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin 
gene significantly promoted spinosad biosynthesis under normal oxygen and 
moderately oxygen-limiting conditions (P<0.01). These findings demonstrate that 
integrating expression of the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene improves oxygen 
uptake and is an effective means for the genetic improvement of S. spinosa 
fermentation.

Can mucosal healing be a cost-effective endpoint for biologic therapy in Crohn's 
disease? A decision analysis.

02114, USA. aananthakrishnan@partners.org

BACKGROUND: Observational studies have demonstrated that mucosal healing (MH) 
may be associated with reductions in hospitalizations and surgeries for moderate 
to severe Crohn's disease (CD). Whether treatment to achieve MH is a 
cost-effective endpoint has not been established previously.
METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic model comparing two treatment 
strategies. In the clinical response (CR) arm, patients not in clinical 
remission at year 1 are dose-escalated. In the MH arm, patients with persistence 
of mucosal ulcerations at year 1 are escalated irrespective of clinical 
symptoms. Patients remain at risk for hospitalization and surgeries while they 
have active disease. We examined a 2-year time horizon.
RESULTS: In the base case the MH strategy was more effective at 2 years 
(quality-adjusted life year [QALY] 0.71) compared to the CR strategy (QALY 0.69) 
but was also more expensive with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
of $49,278/QALY gained. In a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 patients assigned to 
each treatment arm, the MH strategy resulted in lower rates of hospitalization 
and surgery with a number needed to treat of 27 and 106, respectively. The 
results were sensitive to the ability of infliximab to achieve MH and the 
incremental benefit of MH over clinical remission.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that MH as an endpoint is a cost-effective strategy 
in CD patients initiating IFX therapy. Further prospective studies on durability 
of MH and its incremental benefit as well as the ability of other available 
biologic agents to achieve MH are necessary to validate our findings.

The state of diabetes in North Carolina.

Konen J(1), Page J.

(1)North Carolina Diabetes Advisory Council, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.

The diabetes epidemic is rapidly growing in North Carolina. In 1999, an 
estimated 366,000 residents were living with diagnosed diabetes. Ten years 
later, the prevalence of diagnosed cases had increased to approximately 659,000. 
Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the state and decreases life 
expectancy by up to 15 years. If the epidemic remains unchecked in the state, 
annual health care costs are predicted to exceed $17 billion by 2025. Prevention 
of diabetes and diabetes-related complications through treatment and disease 
self-management is paramount in changing this deadly and costly course and 
demands continued innovation in health programs and services and new 
partnerships among health professionals. This article reviews the diabetes 
burden in North Carolina and sets the stage for commentaries and sidebars in the 
accompanying policy forum.

College, Erciyes Univ, 38039 Kayseri, Turkey. osagdic@erciyes.edu.tr

Grape pomace extracts were obtained from 5 different grape varieties grown in 
Turkey. The extracts were concentrated to obtain crude extracts; and 
incorporated into beef patties at 0% (Control), 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% 
concentrations to test their antimicrobial effects in different storage periods 
(first, 12, 24, and 48 h). The numbers of microorganism were generally decreased 
by the extract concentration during the storage period. All the microorganisms 
tested were inhibited by the extract concentration of 10% in all the storage 
periods. Furthermore, the foodborne pathogens including Enterobacteriaceae and 
coliform bacteria, and the spoilage microorganisms including yeasts and moulds 
and lipolytic bacteria were also inhibited by 5% of Emir, Gamay, and Kalecik 
Karasi varieties in beef patties. Considering the results, the extracts of grape 
pomaces might be a good choice in the microbial shelf life extension of the food 
products as well as inhibiting the food pathogens as the case of beef patties.
PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Grape pomace consists of seeds, skins, and stems, and an 
important by-product that is well known to be the rich source of phenolic 
compounds, both flavonoids and non-flavonoids. These substances have 
considerable beneficial effects on human health. The use of natural 
antimicrobial compounds, like plant extracts of herbs and spices for the 
preservation of foods has been very popular issue because of their antimicrobial 
activity. Therefore, grape pomace should be added into some food formulations to 
benefit from their protective effects. In this respect, this study reports the 
effect of addition of grape pomace extracts obtained from different grape 
varieties on microbial quality of beef patty. The results obtained in this study 
may be useful for food industry, which has recently tended to use natural 
antimicrobial sources in place of synthetic preservatives to prevent microbial 
spoilage.

Shelf life extension of sugarcane juice using preservatives and gamma radiation 
processing.

Mishra BB(1), Gautam S, Sharma A.

Author information:
(1)Food Technology Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai 400085, 
India.

Preserving raw sugarcane juice is a challenging problem. Sugarcane juice turns 
brown soon after its extraction and gets spoiled due to fermentation within 
hours. A combination of gamma radiation (5 kGy) with permitted preservatives and 
low temperature storage (10 °C) could preserve raw sugarcane juice for more than 
a month. The preservatives used were citric acid (0.3%), sodium benzoate 
(0.015%), potassium sorbate (0.025%), and sucrose (10%). The treatment helped in 
extending the shelf life to 15 d at ambient temperature (26 ± 2 °C) and 35 d at 
10 °C. The microbial load was found to be below detectable limit within this 
period. The biochemicals like phenolics and flavonoids were not found to be 
affected by addition of these preservatives. The antioxidant activities 
including free radical scavenging activity, nitrite scavenging activity, and 
reducing power were also not significantly affected. The sensory evaluation 
scores showed that the juice with this combination treatment was highly 
acceptable.
