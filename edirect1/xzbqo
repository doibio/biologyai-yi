BACKGROUND: Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a common problem, yet evidence to 
inform decisions about initial medical treatment is limited.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the 
levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) (Mirena®, Bayer) compared 
with usual medical treatment, with exploration of women's perspectives on 
treatment.
DESIGN: A pragmatic, multicentre randomised trial with an economic evaluation 
and a longitudinal qualitative study.
SETTING: Women who presented in primary care.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 571 women with HMB. A purposeful sample of 27 women who 
were randomised or ineligible owing to treatment preference participated in 
semistructured face-to-face interviews around 2 and 12 months after commencing 
treatment.
INTERVENTIONS: LNG-IUS or usual medical treatment (tranexamic acid, mefenamic 
acid, combined oestrogen-progestogen or progesterone alone). Women could 
subsequently swap or cease their allocated treatment.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the patient-reported score on the 
Menorrhagia Multi-Attribute Scale (MMAS) assessed over a 2-year period and then 
again at 5 years. Secondary outcomes included general quality of life (QoL), 
sexual activity, surgical intervention and safety. Data were analysed using 
iterative constant comparison. A state transition model-based cost-utility 
analysis was undertaken alongside the randomised trial. Quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) were derived from the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions 
(EQ-5D) and the Short Form questionnaire-6 Dimensions (SF-6D). The 
intention-to-treat analyses were reported as cost per QALY gained. Uncertainty 
was explored by conducting both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: The MMAS total scores improved significantly in both groups at all time 
points, but were significantly greater for the LNG-IUS than for usual treatment 
[mean difference over 2 years was 13.4 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.9 
to 16.9 points; p < 0.001]. However, this difference between groups was reduced 
and no longer significant by 5 years (mean difference in scores 3.9 points, 95% 
CI -0.6 to 8.3 points; p = 0.09). By 5 years, only 47% of women had a LNG-IUS in 
place and 15% were still taking usual medical treatment. Five-year surgery rates 
were low, at 20%, and were similar, irrespective of initial treatments. There 
were no significant differences in serious adverse events between groups. Using 
the EQ-5D, at 2 years, the relative cost-effectiveness of the LNG-IUS compared 
with usual medical treatment was £1600 per QALY, which by 5 years was reduced to 
£114 per QALY. Using the SF-6D, usual medical treatment dominates the LNG-IUS. 
The qualitative findings show that women's experiences and expectations of 
medical treatments for HMB vary considerably and change over time. Women had 
high expectations of a prompt effect from medical treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: The LNG-IUS, compared with usual medical therapies, resulted in 
greater improvement over 2 years in women's assessments of the effect of HMB on 
their daily routine, including work, social and family life, and psychological 
and physical well-being. At 5 years, the differences were no longer significant. 
A similar low proportion of women required surgical intervention in both groups. 
The LNG-IUS is cost-effective in both the short and medium term, using the 
method generally recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence. Using the alternative measures to value QoL will have a considerable 
impact on cost-effectiveness decisions. It will be important to explore the 
clinical and health-care trajectories of the ECLIPSE (clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system in primary 
care against standard treatment for menorrhagia) trial participants to 10 years, 
by which time half of the cohort will have reached menopause.

Point: incident exposures, prevalent exposures, and causal inference: does 
limiting studies to persons who are followed from first exposure onward damage 
epidemiology?

Vandenbroucke J, Pearce N.

The idea that epidemiologic studies should start from first exposure onward has 
been advocated in the past few years. The study of incident exposures is 
contrasted with studies of prevalent exposures in which follow-up may commence 
after first exposure. The former approach is seen as a hallmark of a good study 
and necessary for causal inference. We argue that studying incident exposures 
may be necessary in some situations, but it is not always necessary and is not 
the preferred option in many instances. Conducting a study involves decisions as 
to which person-time experience should be included. Although studies of 
prevalent exposures involve left truncation (missingness on the left), studies 
of incident exposures may involve right censoring (missingness on the right) and 
therefore may not be able to assess the long-term effects of exposure. These 
considerations have consequences for studies of dynamic (open) populations that 
involve a mixture of prevalent and incident exposures. We argue that studies 
with prevalent exposures will remain a necessity for epidemiology. The purpose 
of this paper is to restore the balance between the emphasis on first exposure 
cohorts and the richness of epidemiologic information obtained when studying 
prevalent exposures.

PURPOSE: This study aims to create and validate a score for survival and 
functional outcome of lung cancer patients with metastatic spinal cord 
compression (MSCC) after posterior decompressive surgery.
METHODS: The entire cohort of 73 consecutive patients was randomly assigned to a 
test group (N = 37) and a validation group (N = 36). In the test group, we 
retrospectively analyzed 10 preoperative characteristics. Characteristics 
significantly associated with survival on multivariate analysis were included in 
the score. Patients in the validation group were used to confirm whether the 
score was reproducible. Postoperative functional outcome was analyzed both in 
the test and validation groups.
RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, preoperative ambulatory status (P = 0.0017), 
visceral metastases (P = 0.0002), and time developing motor deficits 
(P = 0.0004) had significant impact on survival and were included in the scoring 
system. According to the prognostic scores, which ranged from 0 to 6 points, two 
risk groups were designed: 0-2 and 3-6 points and the median survival was 
2.6 months (95 % CI, 1.0-3.8 months) and 10.7 months (95 % CI, 7.1-13.7 months), 
respectively (P < 0.0001). In the validation group, the corresponding median 
survival was 2.7 months (95 % CI, 1.6-5.5 months) and 10.8 months 
(5.8-13.6 months), respectively (P < 0.0001). In addition, the functional 
outcome was worse in patients with 0-2 points than in patients with 3-6 points 
both in the test (P = 0.0023) and validation groups (P = 0.0298).
CONCLUSION: Patients with scores of 0-2 points, who have short survival time 
(life expectancy less than 3 months) and poor functional outcome, appear best 
treated with radiotherapy or best supportive care alone. Surgery may be no 
longer in consideration in most of the patients in this group. Patients with 
score of 3-6 points should be surgical candidates, because survival prognosis 
(life expectancy more than 10 months) and functional outcome are favorable after 
surgery.

Impaired growth is often associated with an extension of lifespan. However, the 
negative correlation between somatic growth and life expectancy is only true 
within, but not between, species. This can be observed because smaller species 
have, as a rule, a shorter lifespan than larger species. In insects and worms, 
reduced reproductive development and increased fat storage are associated with 
prolonged lifespan. However, in mammals the relationship between the dynamics of 
reproductive development, fat metabolism, growth rate, and lifespan are less 
clear. To address this point, female transgenic mice that were overexpressing 
similar levels of either intact (D-mice) or mutant insulin-like growth 
factor-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) lacking the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif (E- mice) 
were investigated. Both lines of transgenic mice exhibited a similar degree of 
growth impairment (-9% and -10%) in comparison with wild-type controls (C-mice). 
While in D-mice, sexual maturation was found to be delayed and life expectancy 
was significantly increased in comparison with C-mice, these parameters were 
unaltered in E-mice in spite of their reduced growth rate. These observations 
indicate that the RGD-domain has a major influence on the pleiotropic effects of 
IGFBP-2 and suggest that somatic growth and time of sexual maturity or somatic 
growth and life expectancy are less closely related than thought previously.

Comparison Between Surgery and Radiotherapy?

Institute, Milan Italy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of second tumor induction for 
prostate patients treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy in age classes 
50-70. Based on both age-dependent models and doses to critical organs, the risk 
of second tumor induction was evaluated simulating the small field (prostate and 
seminal vesicles) and large field (whole pelvis) for Helical Tomotherapy and 
Rapid Arc. The doses to the organs closest to the treatment volume were derived 
from treatment planning system data. Whereas, due to the lack of calculation 
algorithms where leakage and internal radiation scattering are unreliable at a 
large distance from target, the doses to the organs outside the treatment volume 
were measured in an anthropomorphic phantom. Doses from Image Guided 
Radiotherapy (IGRT) were also assessed on phantom measurements. The Lifetime 
Attributable Risk (LAR) for second tumor induction increases from 2.2 to 13.7% 
as irradiated volume increases and age decreases. IGRT could add a 
non-negligible factor to the risk when daily set-up verification with 
high-resolution modality is included. As prostate cancer is detected earlier, 
the probability of an increase in early stage patients rises, and life 
expectancy thus increases. Radiotherapy has improved its capability in the 
tailoring of the dose around the target at the cost of a greater dose to 
surrounding organs, thus increasing the risk of second tumor induction, 
especially for those patients expected to survive 15 y or more.

In an era of antiviral treatment, reexamination of the cost-effectiveness of 
strategies to prevent perinatal hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission in the 
United States is needed. We used a decision tree and Markov model to estimate 
the cost-effectiveness of the current U.S. strategy and two alternatives: (1) 
Universal hepatitis B vaccination (HepB) strategy: No pregnant women are 
screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). All infants receive HepB 
before hospital discharge; no infants receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG). 
(2) Current strategy: All pregnant women are screened for HBsAg. Infants of 
HBsAg-positive women receive HepB and HBIG ≤12 hours of birth. All other infants 
receive HepB before hospital discharge. (3) Antiviral prophylaxis strategy: All 
pregnant women are screened for HBsAg. HBsAg-positive women have HBV-DNA load 
measured. Antiviral prophylaxis is offered for 4 months starting in the third 
trimester to women with DNA load ≥10(6) copies/mL. HepB and HBIG are 
administered at birth to infants of HBsAg-positive women, and HepB is 
administered before hospital discharge to infants of HBsAg-negative women. 
Effects were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Compared to the universal HepB strategy, the 
current strategy prevented 1,006 chronic HBV infections and saved 13,600 QALYs 
(ICER: $6,957/QALY saved). Antiviral prophylaxis dominated the current strategy, 
preventing an additional 489 chronic infections, and saving 800 QALYs and $2.8 
million. The results remained robust over a wide range of assumptions.
CONCLUSION: The current U.S. strategy for preventing perinatal HBV remains 
cost-effective compared to the universal HepB strategy. An antiviral prophylaxis 
strategy was cost saving compared to the current strategy and should be 
considered to continue to decrease the burden of perinatal hepatitis B in the 
United States.

Impact of Long-Term Care on Retirement Wellness.

Rappaport AM.

Retirement wellness is the result of retiring at an appropriate age, saving 
enough and managing risks appropriately. One of the major risks that often is 
not addressed effectively is the long-term care (LTC) risk, i.e., the risk of 
needing help due to physical or cognitive limitations. In 2014, the Society of 
Actuaries issued a call for papers on the link between LTC and retirement 
security. This article will discuss the topic of LTC and retirement security 
broadly, drawing from several of the papers. Some of the topics include the 
impact of LTC on the individual, family members and caregivers; modeling results 
showing the impact of LTC on assets needed for a secure retirement; alternative 
methods of financing LTC; the link between housing decisions and LTC; and some 
ideas for the future.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is an important 
treatment option for type 1 diabetes patients unable to achieve adequate 
glycemic control with multiple daily injections (MDI). Combining CSII with 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) with 
a low glucose-suspend (LGS) feature may further improve glycemic control and 
reduce the frequency of hypoglycemia. A cost-effectiveness analysis of SAP + LGS 
vs. CSII plus self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) was performed to determine 
the health economic benefits of SAP + LGS in type 1 diabetes patients using CSII 
in the U.K.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the CORE diabetes 
model. Treatment effects were sourced from the literature, where SAP + LGS was 
associated with a projected HbA1c reduction of -1.49% vs. -0.62% for CSII, and a 
reduced frequency of severe hypoglycemia. The time horizon was that of patient 
lifetimes; future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3.5% and 1.5% 
per annum, respectively.
RESULTS: Projected outcomes showed that SAP + LGS was associated with higher 
mean quality-adjusted life expectancy (17.9 vs. 14.9 quality-adjusted life years 
[QALYs], SAP + LGS vs. CSII), and higher life expectancy (23.8 vs. 21.9 years), 
but higher mean lifetime direct costs (GBP 125,559 vs. GBP 88,991), leading to 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of GBP 12,233 per QALY gained for 
SAP + LGS vs. CSII. Findings of the base-case analysis remained robust in 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: For UK-based type 1 diabetes patients with poor 
glycemic control, the use of SAP + LGS is likely to be cost-effective compared 
with CSII plus SMBG.

Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, 50937, Cologne, Germay.

BACKGROUND: Although widely applied, the cost-effectiveness of endovenous laser 
ablation (EVLT) for varicose veins has not been established.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed on the evaluation of EVLT for 
the treatment of uncomplicated varicose veins by using published data from 
randomizd clinical trials regarding the costs and the quality of life. 
Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained at 6 months 
following treatment was calculated. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to 
investigate the uncertainty associated with the results of our analysis.
RESULTS: Over the time horizon of 1-6 months, it was found that the incremental 
cost of EVLT compared with conventional surgery was €466.66 and the incremental 
effect was -0.007 QALY at 1 month, -0.0075 QALY at 3 months and 0.0 QALY at 
6 months. This shows that the strategy "EVLT" was dominated by the strategy 
"HL/S" at any time point for the base cases analyses. The results of various 
alternative economic evaluations indicated that EVLT may be a potentially cost 
effective (i.e. incremental cost effectiveness ratio of between €12158.67 and 
€514721.67 per QALY, respectively) treatment option compared to conventional 
surgical treatment for varicose veins with a certainty between 54.9 and 98.8 %.
CONCLUSION: For patients with uncomplicated varicose veins and evidence of 
saphenofemoral reflux, surgical treatment for varicose veins offers a robust 
health benefit for relatively less costs compared to EVLT.

BACKGROUND: China has experienced a remarkable epidemiological and demographic 
transition during the past three decades. Far less is known about this 
transition at the subnational level. Timely and accurate assessment of the 
provincial burden of disease is needed for evidence-based priority setting at 
the local level in China.
METHODS: Following the methods of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 
2013), we have systematically analysed all available demographic and 
epidemiological data sources for China at the provincial level. We developed 
methods to aggregate county-level surveillance data to inform provincial-level 
analysis, and we used local data to develop specific garbage code redistribution 
procedures for China. We assessed levels of and trends in all-cause mortality, 
causes of death, and years of life lost (YLL) in all 33 province-level 
administrative units in mainland China, all of which we refer to as provinces, 
for the years between 1990 and 2013.
FINDINGS: All provinces in mainland China have made substantial strides to 
improve life expectancy at birth between 1990 and 2013. Increases ranged from 
4.0 years in Hebei province to 14.2 years in Tibet. Improvements in female life 
expectancy exceeded those in male life expectancy in all provinces except 
Shanghai, Macao, and Hong Kong. We saw significant heterogeneity among provinces 
in life expectancy at birth and probability of death at ages 0-14, 15-49, and 
50-74 years. Such heterogeneity is also present in cause of death structures 
between sexes and provinces. From 1990 to 2013, leading causes of YLLs changed 
substantially. In 1990, 16 of 33 provinces had lower respiratory infections or 
preterm birth complications as the leading causes of YLLs. 15 provinces had 
cerebrovascular disease and two (Hong Kong and Macao) had ischaemic heart 
disease. By 2013, 27 provinces had cerebrovascular disease as the leading cause, 
five had ischaemic heart disease, and one had lung cancer (Hong Kong). Road 
injuries have become a top ten cause of death in all provinces in mainland 
China. The most common non-communicable diseases, including ischaemic heart 
disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancers (liver, 
stomach, and lung), contributed much more to YLLs in 2013 compared with 1990.
INTERPRETATION: Rapid transitions are occurring across China, but the leading 
health problems and the challenges imposed on the health system by 
epidemiological and demographic change differ between groups of Chinese 
provinces. Localised health policies need to be implemented to tackle the 
diverse challenges faced by local health-care systems.

Surgical excision is essential for management of the rare and aggressive 
neoplasm adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC). Five-year overall survival (OS) after 
surgery for ACC is dependent on disease stage, but for all stages the risk of 
death declines with time after surgery. We calculated the effect of 
post-surgical duration on conditional survival (CS) among ACC patients. A total 
of 641 patients with M0 ACC were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results (SEER) registry (1988-2012). OS for the entire cohort at 1, 2, 
3, 4, 5 and 6 years was 81.4%, 66.8%, 56.3%, 50.3%, 47.2% and 44.3%, 
respectively. CS for an additional year given prior survival for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 
or 5 years was 81.4%, 81.1%, 83.0%, 87.5%, 93.4% and 93.4%, respectively. Age, 
tumor stage, tumor grade and marital status affected OS and CS. Increases in 
1-year CS over time were more pronounced in patients with poorer prognostic 
factors. With longer follow-up, tumor stage- and grade-dependent differences in 
CS decreased or even disappeared. CS may provide more meaningful life expectancy 
predictions for survivors of ACC than conventional survival analysis.

INTRODUCTION: Access to ART and health services is guaranteed under universal 
coverage to improve life expectancy and quality of life for HIV patients. 
However, it remains unknown whether patients of different socioeconomic 
background equally use different types of health services.
METHODS: We use one-year (2010-2011) data on individual healthcare utilization 
and expenditures for the total population (N = 2262698) of the Basque Country. 
We observe the prevalence of HIV and use OLS regressions to estimate the impact 
on health utilization of demographic, socioeconomic characteristics, and health 
status in such patients.
RESULTS: HIV prevalence per 1000 individuals is greater the lower the 
socioeconomic status (0.784 for highest; 2.135 for lowest), for males (1.616) 
versus females (0.729), and for middle-age groups (26-45 and 46-65). Health 
expenditures are 11826€ greater for HIV patients than for others, but with 
differences by socioeconomic group derived from a different mix of services 
utilization (total cost of 13058€ for poorest, 14960€ for richest). Controlling 
for health status and demographic variables, poor HIV patients consume more on 
pharmaceuticals; rich in specialists and hospital care. Therefore, there is 
inequity in health services utilization by socioeconomic groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Equity in health provision for HIV patients represents a challenge 
even if access to treatment is guaranteed. Lack of information in poorer 
individuals might lead to under-provision while richer individuals might demand 
over-provision. We recommend establishing accurate clinical guidelines with the 
appropriate mix of health provision by validated need for all socioeconomic 
groups; promoting educational programs so that patients demand the appropriate 
mix of services, and stimulating integrated care for HIV patients with multiple 
chronic conditions.

The objective of this study was to conduct an incremental cost-effectiveness 
analysis from the payer's perspective in Singapore of 3 gestational diabetes 
mellitus screening strategies: universal, targeted, or no screening. A decision 
tree model assessed the primary outcome: incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained. Probabilities, costs, and utilities were derived from 
the literature, the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) 
birth cohort study, and the KK Women's and Children's Hospital's database. 
Relative to targeted screening using risk factors, universal screening generates 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $USD10,630/QALY gained. 
Sensitivity analyses show that disease prevalence rates and intervention 
effectiveness of glycemic management have the biggest impacts on the ICERs. 
Based on the model and best available data, universal screening is a 
cost-effective approach for reducing the complications of gestational diabetes 
mellitus in Singapore as compared with the targeted screening approach or no 
screening.

INTRODUCTION: Health care providers and health policy managers need updated and 
valid information regarding causes of death (COD) for development the health 
care facilities, directing primary prevention, assigning funds, and promoting 
public health. The major causes of death and its burden have not been yet 
appropriately identified in Iran. Although several studies had been carried out 
in this area, most of them were local or performed in the past years and need to 
be update. Thus, the present study aimed to address the major causes of death 
and its burden in Iran.
METHODS: The present cross-sectional study was performed on graduate students 
and their families from February to March 2014. Through a two-stage random 
sampling procedure, data on 11315 subjects were obtained. The corresponding age 
of death, gender, and calendar year of death were inquired. All causes of death 
were categorized in nine groups including major cardiovascular disease, cancers, 
motor vehicle accidents, unintentional injuries, intentional injuries, stroke, 
lower respiratory infections, diabetes, and other reasons. Years of life lost 
(YLL) and person years of life lost were computed as the burden of diseases.
RESULTS: Totally, 11315 (50.4% male) subjects were studied. The results 
regarding death of relatives revealed that 360 deaths occurred (66.9% male). COD 
in 95 cases (26.4%) was cardiovascular diseases, 64 (17.8%) motor vehicle 
accidents, 41 (11.4%) cancers, 23 (6.4%) unintentional injuries, 22 (6.1%) 
intentional injuries, 10 (2.8%) stroke, 8 (2.2%) lower respiratory infections, 6 
(1.8%) diabetes, and 91 (25.3%) other reasons. The average YLL due to all COD 
was 34.4±18.5. YLL for motor vehicle accidents and injuries (unintentional and 
intentional) were higher than cardiovascular diseases (p<0.001). In addition, 
person years of life lost for motor vehicle accidents were 2613.1 years. 
Cardiovascular diseases (2159.4 years), cancers (1321.0 years), and 
unintentional injuries (990.4 years) were in the next ranks.
CONCLUSION: Based on the findings, it seems that cardiovascular diseases, motor 
vehicle accidents, cancers, intentional and unintentional injuries are the major 
causes of death in Iranian population. Most of years of life lost were due to 
motor vehicle accidents, cardiovascular diseases and cancers, intentional and 
unintentional injuries, respectively.

INTRODUCTION: Organ donation is one of the surviving procedures, which can 
increase the life expectancy of end-stage patients. Inappropriate beliefs and 
attitude of individuals to organ donation, their poor knowledge, and the 
socio-economic level are one of the most important barriers for organ donation. 
Therefore, here knowledge and attitude levels among relatives of trauma patients 
regarding organ donation were evaluated.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done on relatives of trauma patients 
referred to the emergency department of Sina Hospital, Tabriz, Iran, through 
2013 to 2014. The questionnaire included parts of demographic data and 
socio-economic situations as well as status of knowledge and attitude regarding 
organ donation. A score between 0-7 was belonged to each person based on his/her 
level of knowledge. Attitude level had a score between 0-12. Chi- square, 
Fisher, and Mann-Whitney U test were performed to assess the relation between 
demographic variables and the level of knowledge and attitude. P<0.05 was 
considered as a significant level.
RESULTS: 79 persons (57.1% male) with the mean age of 31.3±11.3 years were 
evaluated. 57 (73.1%) of subjects agreed with organ transplant. The main causes 
of disagreement among relatives regarding organ donation were dissatisfaction of 
the donor's relatives (25%) and religious issues (15%). 49 (62.02%) studied 
people had inappropriate attitude and 27 (34.2%) ones had good knowledge. male 
gender (OR=5.87; 95%CI: 3.32-8.42; p=0.001) and self-employed job (OR=7.78; 
95%CI: 4.64-10.92; p=0.001) are independent factors associated with poor 
knowledge about organ donation. Self-employed job (OR=3.86; 95%CI: 1.41-6.11; 
p=0.009) and poor knowledge (OR=15.3; 95%CI: 9.03-21.57; p<0.001) were related 
to inappropriate attitude toward organ donation.
CONCLUSION: The present study showed that 73.1% of participants agreed with 
organ donation. The major causes of disagreements were dissatisfaction of other 
relatives and religious beliefs. 62.0% of the studied people had positive view 
regarding organ donation and 34.2% of them well informed about. The most 
important causative factors for poor knowledge in this context were male gender 
and self-employed occupation. In addition, poor knowledge and self-employed job 
were two factors associated with inappropriate attitude toward organ donation.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established adverse prognostic factor 
in patients sustaining myocardial infarction (MI). However, its impact on 
long-term survival remains less clear. The aim of this observational study was 
to quantify lifetime mortality and years of life lost after MI in patients with 
and without DM.
METHODS: In 1995, 2153 individuals with MI were recruited from 20 adjacent 
hospitals within Yorkshire, UK. Median survival, all-cause mortality at 20 years 
and lost years of life when compared to actuarial predictions were compared in 
patients with and without DM. Landmark analyses were conducted to define the 
ongoing impact of DM beyond specified time points.
RESULTS: 13% (279/2153) had known DM. They experienced higher mortality at 30 
days (33.1% vs 24.6%; p<0.0001) and at 20 years (84.9% vs 75.7%; p<0.0001). 
Overall, there was a 48% increased risk of death (p<0.0001), which persisted 
after adjustment for potential confounders. There was no interaction between DM 
and prior MI in predicting mortality (p=0.67). Median survival decreased by 3.3 
years (p<0.0001). The adverse impact of DM persisted in sequential landmark 
analyses at 1, 5 and 10 years. Presence of DM conferred 2 extra years of life 
lost when compared with actuarial predictions (8 vs 6 years; p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: DM remains an independent adverse prognostic factor in the 
long-term after MI. Persistently diverging survival curves support enduring 
efforts to reduce mortality late after MI.

Early detection and subsequent reduction of modifiable risk factors for 
cognitive decline is important for extending healthy life expectancy in the 
currently aging society. Although a recent increase in studies on the state or 
number of the teeth and cognitive function, few studies have focused on the 
association between posterior teeth occlusion necessary to maintain chewing 
function and cognitive function among older adults. This study examined the 
association between posterior teeth occlusion and cognitive function in nursing 
home older residents. In this cross-sectional study, 279 residents aged ≥60 
years from eight nursing homes in Aso City, Japan participated in cognitive 
function and dental status assessments and completed a comprehensive 
questionnaire survey in 2014. Cognitive function was measured using a 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Posterior teeth occlusion was assessed 
using a total number of functional tooth units (total-FTUs), depending on the 
number and location of the remaining natural and artificial teeth on 
implant-supported, fixed, and removable prostheses. Linear regression models 
were used to assess univariate and multivariate associations between total-FTUs 
and MMSE scores. Models were sequentially adjusted for demographic 
characteristics, number of natural teeth, socioeconomic status, health 
behaviors, comorbidities, physical function, and nutritional status. Among the 
200 residents included in our analysis, mean MMSE scores and total-FTUs were 
11.0 ± 8.6 and 9.3 ± 4.6, respectively. Higher total-FTUs were significantly 
associated with higher MMSE scores after adjustment for demographics and teeth 
number (B = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.22-0.74). The association 
remained significant even after adjustment for all covariates (B = 0.25, 95% CI 
= 0.01-0.49). The current findings demonstrated that loss of posterior teeth 
occlusion was independently associated with cognitive decline in nursing home 
older residents in Japan. Maintenance and restoration of posterior teeth 
occlusion may be a preventive factor against cognitive decline in aged 
populations.

INTRODUCTION: Since 2000, the world has been coalesced around efforts to reduce 
maternal mortality. However, few studies have estimated the significance of 
eliminating maternal deaths on female life expectancy. We estimated, based on 
census data, the potential gains in female life expectancy assuming complete 
elimination of pregnancy-related mortality in Zambia.
METHODS: We used data on all-cause and pregnancy-related deaths of females aged 
15-49 reported in the Zambia 2010 census, and evaluated, adjusted and smoothed 
them using existing and verified techniques. We used associated single decrement 
life tables, assuming complete elimination of pregnancy-related deaths to 
estimate the potential gains in female life expectancy at birth, at age 15, and 
over the ages 15-49. We compared these gains with the gains from eliminating 
deaths from accidents, injury, violence and suicide.
RESULTS: Complete elimination of pregnancy-related deaths would extend life 
expectancy at birth among Zambian women by 1.35 years and life expectancy at age 
15 by 1.65 years. In rural areas, this would be 1.69 years and 2.19 years, 
respectively, and in urban areas, 0.78 years and 0.85 years. An additional 0.72 
years would be spent in the reproductive age group 15-49; 1.00 years in rural 
areas and 0.35 years in urban areas. Eliminating deaths from accidents, injury, 
suicide and violence among women aged 15-49 would cumulatively contribute 0.55 
years to female life expectancy at birth.
CONCLUSION: Eliminating pregnancy-related mortality would extend female life 
expectancy in Zambia substantially, with more gains among adolescents and 
females in rural areas. The application of life table techniques to census data 
proved very valuable, although rigorous evaluation and adjustment of reported 
deaths and age was necessary to attain plausible estimates. The collection of 
detailed high quality cause-specific mortality data in future censuses is 
indispensable.

The Practice of Continuous Palliative Sedation in Long-Term Care for Frail 
Patients with Existential Suffering.

van Deijck RH, Hasselaar JG, Krijnsen PJ, Gloudemans AJ, Verhagen SC, Vissers 
KC, Koopmans RT.

Some guidelines and recommendations identify existential suffering as a 
potential refractory symptom for which continuous palliative sedation (CPS) can 
be administered under certain conditions. However, there has been little 
research on the characteristics of patients with existential suffering treated 
with CPS and the degree to which the preconditions are fulfilled. The aim of 
this study was to provide insight into this specific indication for CPS. 
Questionnaires were sent to nursing home physicians in The Netherlands, who 
described 314 patients. Existential suffering was a refractory symptom in 83 of 
the patients. For most of the patients with refractory existential suffering, 
other refractory symptoms were also reported, and life expectancy was seven days 
or less; informed consent for initiating CPS had been obtained in all cases. 
Consultation and intermittent sedation before the start of CPS were far less 
frequently reported than one would expect based on the guidelines. Multivariate 
analysis showed that being male, having previously requested euthanasia, having 
a nervous system disease, or having an other diagnosis were positively 
correlated with the administration of CPS for existential suffering. We conclude 
that more attention should be paid to the suggested preconditions and to the 
presence of existential suffering in male patients or patients with a nervous 
system disease.

[What Lessons Should We Learn from the Death of Patients on Xeplion?].

[Article in Japanese]

Fujii Y.

From the launch of the long-acting injectable antipsychotic paliperidone 
palmitate (XEPLION) on November 19, 2013, 32 fatal cases had been reported up to 
May 18, 2014 (estimated number of users is approximately 11,000 patients) in the 
Early Post-marketing Phase Vigilance. The most common cause of death was sudden 
death (12 cases were sudden death defined by ICD-10 codes 96.0 and 96.1 and 4 
cases suspected sudden death), followed by suicide (7 cases), and neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome (4 cases). Several deaths occurred involving patients with
