BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma subtype, and approximately 50% of the patients are >60 years of age. 
Patients with relapsed/refractory (rr) disease have a poor prognosis with 
currently available treatments. Lenalidomide is available in Italy for patients 
with rrDLBCL based on a local disposition of the Italian Drug Agency.
SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: An observational retrospective study was 
conducted in 24 Italian hematology centers with the aim to improve information 
on effectiveness and safety of lenalidomide use for rrDLBCL in real practice.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three patients received lenalidomide for 21/28 days 
with a median of four cycles. At the end of therapy, there were 36 complete 
responses (23.5%) and 9 partial responses with an overall response rate (ORR) of 
29.4%. In the elderly (>65 years) subset, the ORR was 33.6%. With a median 
follow-up of 36 months, median overall survival was reached at 12 months and 
median disease-free survival was not reached at 62 months. At the latest 
available follow-up, 29 patients are still in response out of therapy. Median 
progression-free survivals differ significantly according to age (2.5 months vs. 
9.5 in the younger vs. elderly group, respectively) and to disease status at the 
latest previous therapy (15 months for relapsed patients vs. 3.5 for refractory 
subjects). Toxicities were manageable, even if 30 of them led to an early drug 
discontinuation.
CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide therapy for patients with rrDLBCL is effective and 
tolerable even in a real-life context, especially for elderly patients.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most 
common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and approximately 50% of the patients 
are >60 years of age. Patients with relapsed/refractory (rr) disease have a poor 
prognosis, reflected by the remarkably short life expectancy of 12 months with 
currently available treatments. The rrDLBCL therapeutic algorithm is not so well 
established because data in the everyday clinical practice are still poor. 
Lenalidomide for patients with rrDLBCL is effective and tolerable even in a 
real-life context, especially for elderly patients.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between body mass index (BMI) and disability-free 
survival (DFS) remains unclear.
METHODS: We conducted a 10-year prospective cohort study of 12,666 Japanese 
individuals aged ≥ 65 y. Information on BMI and lifestyle factors was collected 
via a questionnaire in 2006. Functional disability data were retrieved from the 
public Long-term Care Insurance database. Subjects were divided into seven 
groups according to BMI (<19, 19-21, 21-23, 23-25, 25-27, 27-29 and ≥29). 
Fiftieth percentile differences (PDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in the 
DFS period (differences of period until the first 50% of the composite outcome 
(disability or death) occurred in each of the BMI groups) were calculated using 
the Laplace regression model.
RESULTS: There was a U-shaped relationship between BMI and the risk of incident 
composite outcome, with a BMI nadir of 25-27. Based on BMI 25-27 as a reference, 
the 50th PDs (95% CIs) (in months) in age at disability or death (median DFS) 
were -20.8 (-26.4, -15.2) (P < 0.001) months for BMI <19, -13.5 (-18.2, -8.7) 
(P < 0.001) months for BMI 19-21, -9.8 (-14.2, -5.4) (P < 0.001) months for BMI 
21-23, -2.9 (-7.5, 1.7) (P = 0.21) months for BMI 23-25, -2.7 (-8.4, 2.9) 
(P = 0.34) months for BMI 27-29, and -11.5 (-19.6, -3.5) (P = 0.005) months for 
BMI ≥ 29. These relationships did not differ by sex.
CONCLUSION: Older individuals with a BMI of <23 or ≥29 have a significantly 
shorter DFS period than those with a BMI of 25-27. It is suggested that the 
optimal BMI range for maximization of disability-free life expectancy in the 
elderly population is 23-29.

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis 
worldwide and a common cause of end-stage renal disease. Evaluation of a kidney 
biopsy is necessary for diagnosis, with routine immunofluorescence microscopy 
revealing dominant or co-dominant IgA immunodeposits usually with complement C3 
and sometimes IgG and/or IgM. IgA nephropathy reduces life expectancy by more 
than 10 years and leads to kidney failure in 20-40% of patients within 20 years 
of diagnosis. There is accumulating clinical, genetic, and biochemical evidence 
that complement plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy. 
The presence of C3 differentiates the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy from the 
subclinical deposition of glomerular IgA. Markers for the activation of the 
alternative and mannan-binding lectin (MBL) pathways in renal-biopsy specimens 
are associated with disease activity and portend a worse renal outcome. 
Complement proteins in the circulation have also been evaluated in IgA 
nephropathy and found to be of prognostic value. Recently, genetic studies have 
identified IgA nephropathy-associated loci. Within these loci are genes encoding 
products involved in complement regulation and interaction with immune 
complexes. Put together, these data identify the complement cascade as a 
rational treatment target for this chronic kidney disease. Recent case reports 
on the successful use of humanized anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab are 
consistent with this hypothesis, but a better understanding of the role of 
complement in IgA nephropathy is needed to guide future therapeutic 
interventions.

Background  This article measures the life quality, clinical, and functional 
outcomes of a patient who had undergone reconstruction of the 
radioscaphocapitate ligament (RSL), using brachioradialis tendon in the 
treatment of ulnar translation of the carpus. Case Description  We present a 
36-year-old man with ulnar translation in his left, nondominant wrist, after 
fall accident. Reconstruction of the RSL was performed. One year later, the 
patient experienced good evaluation. Wrist flexion was 70 degrees, extension was 
60 degrees, radial deviation was 20 degrees, and ulnar deviation was 30 degrees. 
Forearm pronation was 85 degrees and supination was 90 degrees and digit motion 
was full. Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score of 5, Visual Analog 
Scale of 0, and grip strength of 82% were obtained compared with the unaffected 
side. Wrist radiographic aspects showed radiocarpal joint congruency. The period 
of fixator treatment was 8 weeks. Good stability and joint congruency of the 
radiocarpal joint were obtained. Good radiographic, clinical, and functional 
results were obtained improving the quality of life of the patient. Literature 
Review  The treatment of ulnar translation is difficult and complicated. There 
is no consensus to the overall management. As there is still a lack of long-term 
results, the indications for surgery, various surgical options, and the type of 
intervention have been a matter of controversy in the literature. Would 
radiocarpal joint be stable when reconstruction of the RSL using brachioradialis 
tendon was obtained? Is it possible to reduce an ulnar translation with this 
technique? Clinical Relevance  We would like to suggest that the radiocarpal 
ligament reconstruction will improve the outcome. We believe that this technique 
will make the wrist more stable and functional. We agree that the best time to 
perform the corrections is early. The authors prefer to first reconstruct the 
RSL and then the radiocarpal ligament suture or radioscapholunate arthrodesis.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-sense RNA virus that interacts with the 
liver-specific microRNA, miR-122. miR-122 binds to two sites in the 5' 
untranslated region (UTR) and this interaction promotes HCV RNA accumulation, 
although the precise role of miR-122 in the HCV life cycle remains unclear. 
Using biophysical analyses and Selective 2' Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by 
Primer Extension (SHAPE) we investigated miR-122 interactions with the 5' UTR. 
Our data suggests that miR-122 binding results in alteration of nucleotides 
1-117 to suppress an alternative secondary structure and promote functional 
internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 
two hAgo2:miR-122 complexes are able to bind to the HCV 5' terminus 
simultaneously and SHAPE analyses revealed further alterations to the structure 
of the 5' UTR to accommodate these complexes. Finally, we present a 
computational model of the hAgo2:miR-122:HCV RNA complex at the 5' terminus of 
the viral genome as well as hAgo2:miR-122 interactions with the IRES-40S complex 
that suggest hAgo2 is likely to form additional interactions with SLII which may 
further stabilize the HCV IRES. Taken together, our results support a model 
whereby hAgo2:miR-122 complexes alter the structure of the viral 5' terminus and 
promote formation of the HCV IRES.

It is known that obesity is associated with biomechanical alterations during 
locomotor tasks, which is considered a potential risk factor for the development 
of musculoskeletal disorders (MSKD). However, the association of obesity with 
biomechanical alterations of walking in the early stages of life have not yet 
been systematically reviewed. Thus, this review aims to summarize the 
biomechanical characteristics of walking in children and adolescents with 
overweight/obesity (OW/OB) versus their normal-weight (NW) counterparts. PubMed 
and Web of Science were systematically searched until November 2018. We found 
strong and moderate evidence supporting biomechanical differences in the gait 
pattern of OW/OB with respect to NW. Based on strong evidence, the gait patterns 
of OW/OB present greater pelvis transversal plane motion, higher hip internal 
rotation, higher hip flexion, extension and abduction moments and power 
generation/absorption, greater knee abduction/adduction motion, and higher knee 
abduction/adduction moments and power generation/absorption. Based on moderate 
evidence, OW/OB walk with greater step width, longer stance phase, higher 
tibiofemoral contact forces, higher ankle plantarflexion moments and power 
generation, and greater gastrocnemius and soleus activation/forces. These 
biomechanical alterations during walking in OW/OB could play a major role in the 
onset and progression of MSKD.

Thermal Treatment Greatly Improves Storage Stability and Monodispersity of Pea 
Seed Ferritin.

Plant ferritin in holo form is considered as a novel, ideal iron supplement for 
human nutrition in the 21st century, but its self-degradation and 
self-association features limit its application on account of the presence of 
extension peptide (EP), a specific domain only found in plant ferritin. Although 
reported chemicals such as Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) can inhibit its 
self-degradation, they are not edible and toxic. In the present work, we found 
that thermal treatment of pea seed ferritin (PSF) in the range of 60 to 80 °C 
can prolong the storage time of PSF from 3 days to at least 10 days. In the 
meanwhile, the aggregated form can be inhibited upon such treatment, therefore 
promoting its monodispersity. More important, such treatment had little effect 
on the natural shell-like structure of holo PSF and its iron content. In 
contrast, thermal treatment at higher temperature (90 °C or above) resulted in a 
change in ferritin structure. These new findings pave the way to the application 
of plant ferritin as an iron supplement. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Thermal 
treatment at 60 to 80 °C can prolong the storage stability of PSF from 3 days to 
at least 10 days and prevent it from self-aggregation without affecting the 
shell-like structure. It has been known that the stability of PSF is closely 
associated with the bioavailability of iron within PSF. From the standpoint of 
nutrition, the above-mentioned thermal treatment could be used as a cooking 
method in our daily life or in food industry to improve the bioavailability of 
ferritin iron, thereby being beneficial for exploration of plant ferritin as a 
novel, ideal iron supplement to fight against IDA.

Compared with topical corticosteroids, topical combined active vitamin D3 
/corticosteroids and especially biologics are more expensive despite their 
marked efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis. The aim of the present study is 
to evaluate total costs as well as costs versus efficacy of various psoriasis 
treatments under the current Japanese health-care insurance system. A 
prospective study was performed from the database of a single clinic located in 
Hokkaido Prefecture. Cost and quality of life of psoriatic patients were 
evaluated in a prospective manner during a total of 12 months from March 2017 
until June 2018. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of biologics was the highest 
among all treatments. Among the topical treatments, the cost versus efficacy of 
combined active vitamin D3 /corticosteroid was lowest (¥10 557/1 Psoriasis Area 
and Severity Index). Furthermore, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
combined active vitamin D3 /corticosteroid was ¥1 024 031/QALY when compared 
with topical corticosteroid treatment alone. The topical combined active vitamin 
D3 /corticosteroid treatment showed the best cost-efficacy in terms of medical 
economic burden.

Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is a malignancy predominantly arising in the bladder. 
Upper tract UC (UUC) is uncommon, accounting only for 5-10% of the cases. High 
incidence of neoplasms is associated with immunosuppressive therapy; thus, UCs 
of the transplanted grafts often lead to a more aggressive treatment, in order 
to withdraw completely the immunosuppression. It significantly affects the 
patient quality of life, meaning return to dialysis, along with the worse life 
expectancy. We present our single-institution experience of this rare malignancy 
in two mid-age kidney transplant recipients, with UCs successfully treated with 
radical nephroureterectomy: G3 pT3 N0 + G3 pT1 N0 in the first patient and G3 
pT2 N0 in the second one. We also review the previous literature focusing on 
stage of presentation and treatment for the affected kidney transplant patients.

In this study, we analyzed the evolution of the prognosis of primary central 
nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients as they reach selected progression-free 
survival (PFS) milestones after high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX)-based therapy. 
In total, 258 and 146 patients were included from Denmark and British Columbia, 
respectively. All patients were diagnosed during 2000-2017. The 5-year PFS was 
27% (95% CI 23; 32); however, for patients reaching 5 years of PFS, this 
increased to 71% (95% CI 57; 86). Within the first 5 years after diagnosis, 
patients lost 2.0 years (95% CI 1.8; 2.2) when compared to a similar background 
population. This reduced to 0.5 years (95% CI 0.2; 0.9) for patients reaching 5 
years of PFS. Treatment with rituximab was associated with improved outcomes. 
The prognosis of patients with PCNSL treated with HD-MTX-based regimens in this 
cohort is poor, although it improves as patients survive without 
progression/relapse. However, survival does not conclusively normalize to that 
of a similar background population.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality 
worldwide. Around half of patients with HCC will receive systemic therapies 
during their life span. The pivotal positive sorafenib trial and regulatory 
approval in 2007 was followed by a decade of negative studies with drugs leading 
to marginal antitumoral efficacy, toxicity, or trials with a lack of enrichment 
strategies. This trend has changed over the last 2 years with several compounds, 
such as lenvatinib (in first-line) and regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab 
and nivolumab (in second-line), showing clinical benefit. These successes came 
at a cost of increasing the complexity of decision-making, and ultimately, 
impacting the design of future clinical trials. Nowadays, life expectancy with 
single active agents has surpassed the threshold of 1 year and sequential 
strategies have provided encouraging outcomes. Overall survival (OS) remains the 
main endpoint in phase III investigations, but as in other solid tumours, there 
is a clear need to define surrogate endpoints that both reliably recapitulate 
survival benefits and can be assessed before additional efficacious drugs are 
administered. A thorough analysis of 21 phase III trials published in advanced 
HCC demonstrated a moderate correlation between progression-free survival (PFS) 
or time to progression (TTP) and OS (R = 0.84 and R = 0.83, respectively). 
Nonetheless, the significant differences in PFS identified in 7 phase III 
studies only correlated with differences in OS in 3 cases. In these cases, the 
hazard ratio (HR) for PFS was ≤0.6. Thus, this threshold is herein proposed as a 
potential surrogate endpoint of OS in advanced HCC. Conversely, PFS with an HR 
between 0.6-0.7, despite significance, was not associated with better survival, 
and thus these magnitudes are considered uncertain surrogates. In the current 
review, we discuss the reasons for positive or negative phase III trials in 
advanced HCC, and the strengths and limitations of surrogate endpoints (PFS, TTP 
and objective response rate [ORR]) to predict survival.

The effect of various concentrations of nisin (250, 500 or 750 IU/g) combined 
with 50 ppm sodium nitrite on the shelf-life of vacuum-packaged bacon was 
evaluated. Control packages of bacon containing 50 and 150 ppm nitrite were 
included. Total numbers of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (as measured on MRS 
medium) was used as a criterion for shelf-life. Treated bacon samples were 
stored at 30 and 5°C for 4 d or 6 wk, respectively. Bacon stored at 30°C showed 
a 1-d extension of shelf-life at nisin levels of 500 and 750 IU/g. Lowest counts 
at 6 wk were in bacon treated with 750 IU nisin and stored at 5°C. The LAB count 
was 1.5-log10 CFU/g lower than the controls. A 1-wk extension of storage life 
was predicted for nisin-treated (750 IU) bacon.

Evaluation of the Antibotulinal Effectiveness of Nisin in Bacon.

Department of Food Science, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706.

Nisin in combination with nitrite is an effective antibotulinal treatment for 
bacon. However, rather high levels of nisin (100 to 150 ppm) are required in 
combination with 120 ppm nitrite to provide a brief, 1-wk extension of shelf 
life for inoculated bacon incubated at 27°C. This limited antibotulinal 
effectiveness of nisin in bacon would have little practical value. The limited 
antibotulinal effectiveness of nisin in bacon was attributed to its insolubility 
in pickle solutions and its likely slow and incomplete diffusion from the pickle 
solutions into pork belly tissue.

Palliative radiotherapy: history, recent advances, and future directions.

Radiotherapy has been used to palliate cancer symptoms since shortly after the 
time that X rays were discovered late in the 1800's. The 20th century witnessed 
improvements in treatment planning and delivery that permitted radiotherapy to 
serve as a successful, timely, and cost-efficient palliative intervention. 
Palliative radiation oncology has risen to the level of its own subspecialty, as 
evidenced by the formation of palliative radiation oncology clinical services 
and dedicated palliative radiotherapy guidelines, while additional changes have 
begun to alter the very definition and goals of palliative radiotherapy. Local 
treatment may now be offered with dual goals of symptom relief and the potential 
for increased disease-free or overall survival. While these new directions show 
great promise, novel strategies must be formulated to manage the increased 
complexity, workload, and cost of these approaches.

Frailty is a partially reversible geriatric syndrome. Its prevention requires a 
structured screening, and is a major public health issue given the increasing 
life expectancy of the population. The observance of the recommendations made 
after a screening of the frailty patients is not well known. The objective of 
our research was to describe the characteristics of patients evaluated in a 
frailty-day-hospital and followed up recommendation adherence at 3 and 6 months.
METHODS: patients aged over 65 years old with an ADL score of at least 5 out of 
6, were evaluated according to the Fried score to classify patients into 
pre-frailty or frailty patients. According to the standardized geriatric 
assessment, recommendations were prescribed for each medico-social situation 
according to HAS recommendations. A follow-up assessment of these measures was 
carried out at home basis at 3 and 6 months.
RESULTS: 82 patients were included, with mean age of 83.7±5.7 years. 99% were 
pre-frail or frail and received an average of 3.7±1.7 recommendations. At 3 
months, there is an inverse correlation between number and follow-up compliance 
(r=-0.340, p=0.008), as well as at 6 months (r=-0.352, p=0.006). Between 3 and 6 
months, there is a significant increase recommendation number followed (r=0.707, 
p=0.000).
CONCLUSION: at 6 months, 74.3% recommendations were realized, with a significant 
increase of recommendation number between the 3rd and 6th month. This result is 
encouraging by showing the benefit of home support in recommendations follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, safety, and cost utility of continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with multiple daily injection (MDI) 
regimens during the first year following diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in 
children and young people.
DESIGN: Pragmatic, multicentre, open label, parallel group, randomised 
controlled trial and economic evaluation.
SETTING: 15 paediatric National Health Service (NHS) diabetes services in 
England and Wales. The study opened to recruitment in May 2011 and closed in 
January 2017.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged between 7 months and 15 years, with a new diagnosis 
of type 1 diabetes were eligible to participate. Patients who had a sibling with 
the disease, and those who took drug treatments or had additional diagnoses that 
could have affected glycaemic control were ineligible.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised, stratified by age and treating 
centre, to start treatment with CSII or MDI within 14 days of diagnosis. 
Starting doses of aspart (CSII and MDI) and glargine or detemir (MDI) were 
calculated according to weight and age, and titrated according to blood glucose 
measurements and according to local clinical practice.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was glycaemic control (as measured by 
glycated haemoglobin; HbA1c) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were percentage of 
patients in each treatment arm with HbA1c within the national target range, 
incidence of severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, change in height 
and body mass index (as measured by standard deviation scores), insulin 
requirements (units/kg/day), partial remission rate (insulin dose adjusted HbA1c 
<9), paediatric quality of life inventory score, and cost utility based on the 
incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from an NHS 
costing perspective.
RESULTS: 294 participants were randomised and 293 included in intention to treat 
analyses (CSI, n=144; MDI, n=149). At 12 months, mean HbA1c was comparable with 
clinically unimportant differences between CSII and MDI participants (60.9 
mmol/mol v 58.5 mmol/mol, mean difference 2.4 mmol/mol (95% confidence interval 
-0.4 to 5.3), P=0.09). Achievement of HbA1c lower than 58 mmol/mol was low among 
the two groups (66/143 (46%) CSII participants v 78/142 (55%) MDI participants; 
relative risk 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.06)). Incidence of severe 
hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis were low in both groups. Fifty four 
non-serious and 14 serious adverse events were reported during CSII treatment, 
and 17 non-serious and eight serious adverse events during MDI treatment. 
Parents (but not children) reported superior PedsQL scores for those patients 
treated with CSII compared to those treated with MDI. CSII was more expensive 
than MDI by £1863 (€2179; $2474; 95% confidence interval £1620 to £2137) per 
patient, with no additional QALY gains (difference -0.006 (95% confidence 
interval -0.031 to 0.018)).
CONCLUSION: During the first year following type 1 diabetes diagnosis, no 
clinical benefit of CSII over MDI was identified in children and young people in 
the UK setting, and treatment with either regimen was suboptimal in achieving 
HbA1c thresholds. CSII was not cost effective.

Social position is known to play a role in the quality of ageing, notably 
through the stimulation/dysregulation of key physiological systems in response 
to external stresses. Using data from one wave of Understanding Society 
including 9088 participants, we defined, as an extension of the allostatic load, 
a synthetic Biological Health Score (BHS) capturing the wear-and-tear of four 
physiological systems (endocrine, inflammatory, cardiovascular and metabolic 
systems) and two organs (liver and kidney). We used 16 established blood-derived 
biomarkers of these systems to calculate the BHS and explored the relative 
contribution of socioeconomic position to the BHS and its main components across 
age groups. We identified a systematic decreasing education-related gradient of 
the BHS (p<0.001) leading to lower biological risk in participants with longer 
education. Education-related differences in the BHS were detected early in life, 
and were not attributable to lifestyle and behavioural factors. We found a 
consistent contribution of the inflammatory and metabolic systems to the overall 
score throughout from early adulthood onwards, while the contribution of the 
other four systems seems to vary across age groups and gender. Our findings 
highlight the social-to-biological processes ultimately leading to health 
inequalities, and suggest that such disparities can already be detected in the 
20-40 years old age group and cannot be fully explained by lifestyle and 
behavioural factors. This may define early adulthood social condition as a 
precursor to accelerated biological ageing and as an important target for public 
health policies.

INTRODUCTION: Anaemia is the most common extraintestinal manifestation of 
inflammatory bowel disease, which has a negative impact on quality of life.
AIM: To determinate the prevalence, risk factors, and aetiology of anaemia in 
newly diagnosed patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Material and 
methods: We included 136 newly diagnosed patients with IBD. We analysed patient 
age, sex, laboratory tests, endoscopic and radiological examination, length of 
stay, and the course of hospitalisation.
RESULTS: Anaemia at the time of IBD diagnosis was detected in 89 (65.4%) 
patients: 51 (57.3%) patients with ulcerative colitis vs. 38 (42.7%) patients 
with Crohn's disease; p = 0.052. Female patients were more frequently anaemic 
than male patients (59.6% vs. 40.4%; p = 0.001). Anaemia was more often 
diagnosed in Crohn's disease patients with ileocolonic involvement compared to 
other types of disease location (70.96% vs. 56.52%, respectively; p = 0.03). The 
prevalence of anaemia at the time of diagnosis for ulcerative colitis patients 
increased with disease extension: for extensive colitis anaemia was diagnosed in 
64.71% compared to 35.29% in limited extension (p < 0.05). Anaemic patients were 
hospitalised for significantly longer than patients with no anaemia (7.95 ±3.8 
days vs. 5.88 ±2.7 days for Crohn's disease; p = 0.02 and 9.02 ±5.0 days vs. 
5.00 ±2.4 days for ulcerative colitis; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia represents a frequent complication of IBD not only during 
the long-term course of the disease, but also at the moment of diagnosis. 
Anaemia is one of the factors extending the time of hospitalisation. Female sex 
and disease extent are strong determinant factors connected with anaemia.

BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD) is an 
alternative treatment for acute cholecystitis (AC). We aimed to understand the 
natural course of AC in patients treated with PTGBD but without later definitive 
treatments, such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of the period from June 2010 to December 
2016, during which time 2371 patients were diagnosed with AC and 625 received 
PTGBD treatment. Among the 625 patients, 237 received no definitive treatment. A 
biliary event after the initial AC episode was the outcome of interest. In 
addition, the competing risk of death unrelated to biliary causes was present in 
the cohort. Therefore, a competing risk model was applied for analysis.
RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of biliary events was 29.8% with a median of 
4.27 months, while the competing event, i.e., death unrelated to a biliary 
event, was noted in 14.9% of patients with a median 23.54 months. The risk 
factors of biliary events were prolonged PTGBD indwelling and an abnormal PTGBD 
cholangiogram. The risk factors of death unrelated to a biliary event included a 
high Charlson comorbidity index and the initial AC severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Definitive cholecystectomy is still recommended for patients 
undergoing PTGBD treatment due to the high incidence of later biliary events. A 
thorough preoperative evaluation is necessary for those patients before elective 
cholecystectomy because of the inferior life expectancy and physical status.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend extended venothromboembolism (VTE) 
prophylaxis for most patients following colorectal cancer surgery, but provider 
uptake has been limited. The purpose of this study was to identify thresholds 
for when such extended prophylaxis (ePpx) may be value-appropriate.
METHODS: All colorectal cancer postoperative discharges were identified within a 
private payer administrative database (MarketScan® 2010-2014, IBM Truven Health 
Analytics). Outcomes of interest were VTE event rate, mortality, and overall 
costs of care. The data along with published literature were used as parameter 
estimations for a decision analysis model with probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: We identified 22,463 colorectal cancer surgical patients (4.0% with 
ePpx) that served as the parameter estimates for the decision model with a VTE 
event rate of 0.2%. Decision analysis demonstrated that prescribing ePpx was 
dominated by usual practice with the former having higher probability-adjusted 
incremental costs ($1078.68 per person) and lower probability-adjusted benefits 
(- 0.000098 quality adjusted life years). Broad sensitivity analysis found that 
probability of a VTE event, bleeding case fatality rate, and probability of an 
ePpx-associated bleeding event were the primary effectors of the model. VTE 
event rates of greater than 3.0% benefited from prescribing ePpx to all 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Very few patients are discharged on ePpx following colorectal 
cancer surgery despite its endorsement by national guidelines. A decision 
analysis model does not support the use of ePpx except in cases of markedly high 
VTE rates. Clinical guidance could be improved by further recognizing the role 
of risk stratification in the determination of high-risk patients requiring 
ePpx.

Parkinson's disease is known to pose a significant burden on society in 
industrialized countries. However, few studies have been conducted in Italy 
using administrative healthcare databases for epidemiological purposes. We
