mandatory microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft and space 
stations have been conducted by traditional culture methods, although it is 
known that many microbes cannot be cultured with standard techniques. To fully 
appreciate the true number and diversity of microbes that survive in the ISS, 
molecular and culture-based methods were used to assess microbial communities on 
ISS surfaces. Samples were taken at eight pre-defined locations during three 
flight missions spanning 14 months and analyzed upon return to Earth.
RESULTS: The cultivable bacterial and fungal population ranged from 104 to 109 
CFU/m2 depending on location and consisted of various bacterial (Actinobacteria, 
Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria) and fungal (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) phyla. 
Amplicon sequencing detected more bacterial phyla when compared to the 
culture-based analyses, but both methods identified similar numbers of fungal 
phyla. Changes in bacterial and fungal load (by culture and qPCR) were observed 
over time but not across locations. Bacterial community composition changed over 
time, but not across locations, while fungal community remained the same between 
samplings and locations. There were no significant differences in community 
composition and richness after propidium monoazide sample treatment, suggesting 
that the analyzed DNA was extracted from intact/viable organisms. Moreover, 
approximately 46% of intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could 
be cultured.
CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal a diverse population of bacteria and fungi on 
ISS environmental surfaces that changed over time but remained similar between 
locations. The dominant organisms are associated with the human microbiome and 
may include opportunistic pathogens. This study provides the first comprehensive 
catalog of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in 
closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet 
NASA requirements for deep space human habitation. The results of this study can 
have significant impact on our understanding of other confined built 
environments on the Earth such as clean rooms used in the pharmaceutical and 
medical industries.

BACKGROUND: First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy improves overall and 
progression-free survival in patients with untreated metastatic non-small-cell 
lung cancer with a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumour proportion score 
(TPS) of 50% or greater. We investigated overall survival after treatment with 
pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater.
METHODS: This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done in 213 medical 
centres in 32 countries. Eligible patients were adults (≥18 years) with 
previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer 
without a sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation and with an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1, life 
expectancy 3 months or longer, and a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. Randomisation 
was computer generated, accessed via an interactive voice-response and 
integrated web-response system, and stratified by region of enrolment (east Asia 
vs rest of world), ECOG performance status score (0 vs 1), histology (squamous 
vs non-squamous), and PD-L1 TPS (≥50% vs 1-49%). Enrolled patients were randomly 
assigned 1:1 in blocks of four per stratum to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 
3 weeks for up to 35 cycles or the investigator's choice of platinum-based 
chemotherapy for four to six cycles. Primary endpoints were overall survival in 
patients with a TPS of 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or greater 
(one-sided significance thresholds, p=0·0122, p=0·0120, and p=0·0124, 
respectively) in the intention-to-treat population, assessed sequentially if the 
previous findings were significant. This study is registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02220894.
FINDINGS: From Dec 19, 2014, to March 6, 2017, 1274 patients (902 men, 372 
women, median age 63 years [IQR 57-69]) with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater were 
allocated to pembrolizumab (n=637) or chemotherapy (n=637) and included in the 
intention-to-treat population. 599 (47%) had a TPS of 50% or greater and 818 
patients (64%) had a TPS of 20% or greater. As of Feb 26, 2018, median follow-up 
was 12·8 months. Overall survival was significantly longer in the pembrolizumab 
group than in the chemotherapy group in all three TPS populations (≥50% hazard 
ratio 0·69, 95% CI 0·56-0·85, p=0·0003; ≥20% 0·77, 0·64-0·92, p=0·0020, and ≥1% 
0·81, 0·71-0·93, p=0·0018). The median surival values by TPS population were 
20·0 months (95% CI 15·4-24·9) for pembrolizumab versus 12·2 months (10·4-14·2) 
for chemotherapy, 17·7 months (15·3-22·1) versus 13·0 months (11·6-15·3), and 
16·7 months (13·9-19·7) versus 12·1 months (11·3-13·3), respectively. 
Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 113 (18%) of 
636 treated patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 252 (41%) of 615 in the 
chemotherapy group and led to death in 13 (2%) and 14 (2%) patients, 
respectively.
INTERPRETATION: The benefit-to-risk profile suggests that pembrolizumab 
monotherapy can be extended as first-line therapy to patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without sensitising EGFR or 
ALK alterations and with low PD-L1 TPS.

Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with a higher 
prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms compared with the general population. 
Symptoms such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, impulse control disorders, and 
cognitive impairment cause a greater worsening of quality of life than even the 
motor symptoms that define PD. Despite the ubiquity and impact of 
neuropsychiatric symptoms, specialty mental healthcare is not routinely 
available, accessible, or integrated in most neurology practices. Currently, 
training in PD-specific mental healthcare is not standard in most programs, and 
the need for subspecialty-trained, mental healthcare providers will only 
increase over time, as the prevalence of PD will more than double by 2060. Many 
barriers limit extension of mental healthcare into existing models of integrated 
or multidisciplinary care and the community at large. Foundations and 
professional societies have played an important role in raising awareness of 
mental healthcare needs in PD; however, their initiatives to promote integrated 
or multidisciplinary care have traditionally focused on disciplines outside of 
mental health such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy. This article 
examines these issues and suggests strategies to better address mental 
healthcare needs for PD patients in the future.

BACKGROUND: New treatments have improved life-expectancy in patients with cystic 
fibrosis (CF); however, cardiovascular health remains an area of concern in this 
population. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a non-invasive assessment of vascular 
endothelial function that predicts future cardiovascular disease and events, is 
attenuated in patients with CF compared to controls. The reproducibility of FMD 
in CF; however, has yet to be evaluated. Thus, this study sought to examine the 
within-day, between-day, and between-month reproducibility of FMD in patients 
with CF.
METHODS: Pulmonary function, baseline diameter (cm), peak diameter (cm), and 
FMD(%) were assessed 5 times (sessions A-E) over four visits in 13 patients with 
CF (six males, seven females, age range: 13-43 years old; mean forced expiratory 
volume in 1 s = 71% predicted). Sessions A and B (within-day), C (between-day), 
and D and E (between-month) were separated by 3 h, at least 10 days, and 
~3 months, respectively. Reproducibility was assessed by: (1) paired t-tests, 
(2) coefficients of variation (CV), (3) CV prime, (4) Pearson's correlation (r), 
(5) intra-class correlation coefficient, and (6) Bland-Altman plots. Five 
acceptable parameters were required to determine reproducibility.
RESULTS: Pulmonary function was stable throughout all visits. FMD(%) and 
baseline diameter (cm) satisfied all six reproducibility criteria for 
within-day, while peak diameter (cm) met five of six criteria. All six 
reproducibility criteria were met for all between-day and between-month 
assessments.
CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that endothelial function 
assessed by FMD is reproducible in patients with CF not only within-day, but 
also between-day and between-month.

USA.

The objective of this study was to investigate the shelf life of arils and the 
changes in their biochemical compounds in nineteen Iranian pomegranate cultivars 
during storage. Fruits were harvested when commercially mature and the arils 
were removed, packaged and stored at 5 ± 1 °C, at 85-90% relative humidity in a 
cold room. Samples of the stored arils were examined for biochemical features in 
temporal checkpoints throughout a storage period that lasted for 35 days. By 
using the onset of decay as an index, the shelf life of arils varied among 
cultivars, ranging from 7 days to approximately 21 days. Considering the quality 
attributes of ready-to-eat arils at the beginning of the experiment, substantial 
variations were observed among the cultivars with regard to their titratable 
acidity (0.50-8.47%), total soluble solids (13-18.66 °Brix), DPPH radical 
scavenging activity (63-87.44%), Gallic-acid-equivalent (2.64-6.95 mg/ml) and 
ascorbic acid (12.21-75.09 mg/l). In general, the decay of arils gradually 
increased during storage, but several cultivars-which exhibited a very slow 
process of decay-contained the highest content of titratable acidity, 
Gallic-acid-equivalent and total soluble solids (since the signs of decay 
appeared on around the twenty-first day of storage). In addition, titratable 
acidity increased slightly by the end of storage, whereas the ascorbic acid 
content, total soluble solids and Gallic-acid-equivalent were cultivar-dependent 
and did not show consistent patterns of change during storage.

Investigating fairness in global supply chains: applying an extension of the 
living wage to the Western European clothing supply chain.

PURPOSE: This paper explores the issue of fairness in global supply chains. 
Taking the Western European clothing supply chain as a case study, we 
demonstrate how applying a normative indicator in Social Life Cycle Assessment 
(SLCA) can contribute academic and practical insights into debates on fairness. 
To do so, we develop a new indicator that addresses some of the limitations of 
the living wage for SLCA.
METHODS: We extend the standard form of living wage available for developing 
countries to include income tax and social security contributions. We call this 
extension 'living labour compensation'. Using publically available data, we 
estimate net living wages, gross living wages, and living labour compensation 
rates for Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) in 2005. We then integrate 
living labour compensation rates into an input-output framework, which we use to 
compare living labour compensation and actual labour compensation in the BRIC 
countries in the Western European clothing supply chain in 2005.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We find that in 2005, actual labour compensation in the 
Western European clothing supply chain was around half of the living labour 
compensation level, with the greatest difference being in the Agricultural 
sector. Therefore, we argue that BRIC pay in the Western European clothing 
supply chain was unfair. Furthermore, our living labour compensation estimates 
for BRIC in 2005 are ~ 35% higher than standard living wage estimates. Indeed, 
adding income taxes and employee social security contributions alone increases 
the living wage by ~ 10%. Consequently, we argue there is a risk that 
investigations based on living wages are not using a representative measure of 
fairness from the employee's perspective and are substantially underestimating 
the cost of living wages from an employer's perspective. Finally, we discuss 
implications for retailers and living wage advocacy groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Living labour compensation extends the living wage, maintaining its 
strengths and addressing key weaknesses. It can be estimated for multiple 
countries from publically available data and can be applied in an input-output 
framework. Therefore, it is able to provide a normative assessment of fairness 
in complex global supply chains. Applying it to the Western European clothing 
supply chain, we were able to show that pay for workers in Brazil, Russia, 
India, and China is unfair, and draw substantive conclusions for practice.

BACKGROUND: Brain metastases are the most frequent intracranial neoplasms in 
adults. Although overall survival (OS) is an important endpoint in patients 
receiving radiotherapy, given their poor life expectancy in general, quality of 
life is becoming an increasingly useful endpoint. Objectives: to evaluate whole 
brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with 3D conformal boost in brain metastases patients 
with regard to OS and quality of life.
METHODS: During April 2015-May 2017, a total of 35 patients with ≤5, previously 
untreated, inoperable brain metastases were included prospectively. All patients 
underwent WBRT followed by 3D conformal boost to the metastatic lesions. EORTC 
quality of life questionnaires QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BN20 were used at baseline and at 
end of treatment. The mean initial and final scores were compared using Student 
test. One-year OS with brain metastases was computed with Kaplan Maier method.
RESULTS: Median survival with brain metastases was 4.43 months (0.73-78.53). The 
one-year OS for patients with one metastasis was 42% versus 15% for more than 
one (p<0.04). The presence of extracerebral metastases significantly decreased 
OS from 39% without extracerebral metastases to 19%. (p<0.05). Quality of life 
improved significantly in several functional domains: physical (48 vs 60.29), 
role functioning (28.1 vs 44.7), emotional (47.1 vs 80.2), global health status 
(40.9 vs 62.3). Symptom scores decreased significantly in most items, 
corresponding to an improvement in the symptom burden: headache (61.9 vs 0.9), 
nausea and vomiting (45.7 vs 7.1), visual disorder (26.3 vs 9.2), seizures (30.4 
vs 0.9), motor dysfunction (46.6 vs 17.1). Symptom scores for fatigue and 
drowsiness increased significantly (51.1 vs 74.9, respectively 37.1 vs 70.4), 
indicating worsening of symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: WBRT with 3D conformal boost is a feasible technique which improves 
quality of life in brain metastases patients. Since survival is limited, the 
assessment of quality of life is a good indicator of the treatment outcome.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a health economic analysis of an intervention designed to 
increase rates of vaginal birth after caesarean, compared with usual care.
DESIGN: Economic analysis alongside the cluster-randomised OptiBIRTH trial 
(Optimising childbirth by increasing vaginal birth after caesarean section 
(VBAC) through enhanced women-centred care).
SETTING: Fifteen maternity units in three European countries - Germany (five), 
Ireland (five), and Italy (five) - with relatively low VBAC rates.
POPULATION: Pregnant women with a history of one previous lower-segment 
caesarean section; sites were randomised (3:2) to intervention or control.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis from both societal and health-services 
perspectives, using a decision tree.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs and resource use per woman and infant were compared 
between the control and intervention group by country, from pregnancy 
recognition until 3 months postpartum. Based on the caesarean section rates, and 
maternal and neonatal morbidities and mortality, the incremental cost-utility 
ratios were calculated per country.
RESULTS: The mean difference in costs per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
gained from a societal perspective between the intervention and the control 
group, using a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, was: €263 (95% CI €258-268) 
and 0.008 QALYs (95% CI 0.008-0.009 QALYs) for Germany, €456 (95% CI €448-464) 
and 0.052 QALYs (95% CI 0.051-0.053 QALYs) for Ireland, and €1174 (95% CI 
€1170-1178) and 0.006 QALYs (95% CI 0.005-0.007 QALYs) for Italy. The 
incremental cost-utility ratios were €33,741/QALY for Germany, €8785/QALY for 
Ireland, and €214,318/QALY for Italy, with a 51% probability of being 
cost-effective for Germany, 92% for Ireland, and 15% for Italy.
CONCLUSION: The OptiBIRTH intervention was likely to be cost-effective in 
Ireland and Germany.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: The OptiBIRTH intervention (to increase VBAC rates) is 
likely to be cost-effective in Germany and Ireland.

Introduction: PEGylation is a well-established technology for improving the 
therapeutic value of drugs by attaching polyethylene glycol (PEG). The first 
PEGylated enzyme products appeared on the market in the early 1990s; currently, 
more than 18 PEGylated products have been approved by Food and Drug 
Administration, which encompass various classes of drug molecules, such as 
enzymes, interferons, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, hormones, antibody 
fragments, coagulation factors, oligonucleotide aptamers, synthetic peptides, 
and small organic molecules. Areas covered: While PEGylated products mainly 
comprise biologic drugs, such as recombinant proteins and enzymes, non-biologic 
drugs have recently emerged as a target for PEGylation. This review focuses on 
the recent development of PEGylated non-biologic drugs, such as small organic 
molecules, synthetic peptides, and aptamers. Expert opinion: Several PEGylated 
versions of anti-cancer drugs, opioid agonists, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
agonists, and oligonucleotide aptamers are in active development stage, and it 
is likely that they will have a dramatic impact on the market. Although some 
safety concerns about PEG in clinical trials have been recently issued, 
PEGylation is still a commercially attractive proposition as a half-life 
extension technology for long-acting drug development.

Medicine.

Whereas modern clinicians are often reluctant to discuss prognosis with their 
patients, such discussions were central to medical practice in ancient Greece. A 
historical analysis has the potential to explain the reasons for this difference 
in prognostic practices and provide insights into overcoming current challenges. 
Many scholars consider prognosis to be the principal scientific achievement of 
the Hippocratic tradition. The earliest treatise on the subject, On Prognostics, 
defines prognosis broadly as "foreseeing and foretelling, by the side of the 
sick, the present, the past, and the future." This definition makes clear that 
prognosis is not simply about predicting the future, but also involves an 
appreciation for the continuity of past, present, and future as sequences of 
connected events, or trajectories, that can be pieced together into a 
comprehensive story of the patient's health. In modern medicine, prognosis has 
lagged behind diagnosis and treatment in its establishment as a central 
component of medical care. An important basis for understanding this lies in the 
paradigm change that occurred with the discovery of pathogens as agents of 
disease, shifting attention toward individual diseases and away from diseased 
individuals. With this shift, diagnostics and treatments advanced dramatically 
and prognosis fell to the background. More recent attempts to advance prognosis 
have focused on narrower uses of the term, such as estimates of life expectancy 
and mortality risk. However, physicians have expressed a number of reservations 
about the use of such estimates in the care of patients, and patients have 
indicated the desire for a wide variety of predictive information. Adopting the 
broadness of the Hippocratic definition may allow clinicians to overcome their 
hesitancy and provide much-needed information to their patients.

University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

Background: Previous studies have ignored the bidirectional causality and the 
heterogeneity of health level. This study explored the bidirectional causality 
between pharmaceutical expenditure (PE) and total health-care expenditure (Total 
HCE) considering the health level for effective health investment and national 
health improvement.Methods: Based on the panel data on PE and Total HCE in 32 
OECD countries and China, the Granger causality test was applied. Countries were 
divided into low- and high-health-level (LH and HH) groups according to their 
life expectancies.Results: A 1% increase in the growth rate of per capita PE 
boosted a 0.11% increase in that of per capita Total HCE of the following year 
in HH group, whereas no such causality existed in LH group. A 1% increase in the 
growth rate of per capita Total HCE boosted a 0.46% increase in that of the per 
capita PE of the following year in LH group, whereas no such causality existed 
in HH group.Conclusion: High-health-level countries should continue to increase 
the health investment by promoting rational PE growth such as expanding 
insurance coverage for innovative medicine for health improvement. 
Low-health-level countries should take optimizing policy to increase health 
investment in pharmaceutical for medicine accessibility and national health.

BACKGROUND: Falls and injuries related to falls in older adults are a 
significant health care issue that affects the elderly population. Research 
suggests that exercise interventions can be effective in improving falls risk 
factors.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Are there differences in falls risk reduction between two 
exercise interventions (The Lebed Method - TLM and Stay Active and Independent 
for Life - SAIL) for community-dwelling older adults?
METHODS: A quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design was used for this study. 
One hundred and sixty-three older individuals aged between 60-79 years of age 
participated in the study. Assessments of falls risk (using the physiological 
profile assessment), simple reaction time, bilateral knee extension strength, 
proprioception, balance, visual acuity, and mobility (using timed-up-and-go, 
TUG) were performed. Analysis of covariance was conducted to compare the 
differences between the two interventions. Pre-intervention assessments were 
used as the covariate.
RESULTS: SAIL participants' falls risk were reduced more than TLM. Reaction and 
TUG times were faster for SAIL participants. However, those individuals who 
participated in TLM had greater knee extension strength for both legs compared 
to SAIL participants.
SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, both interventions were effective in reducing falls risk 
for older adults. The greater number of improved falls risk factors attained 
with the SAIL program suggests that multifactorial interventions may be more 
effective at reducing falls risk. However, since TLM also showed better improved 
strength, both dance-based and multifactorial interventions can be effective at 
reducing falls risk factors for older adults.

    J Natl Cancer Inst. 2019 Nov 1;111(11):1116-1117.

BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are captured within cancer trials 
to help future patients and their clinicians make more informed treatment 
decisions. However, variability in standards of PRO trial design and reporting 
threaten the validity of these endpoints for application in clinical practice.
METHODS: We systematically investigated a cohort of randomized controlled cancer 
trials that included a primary or secondary PRO. For each trial, an evaluation 
of protocol and reporting quality was undertaken using standard checklists. 
General patterns of reporting where also explored.
RESULTS: Protocols (101 sourced, 44.3%) included a mean (SD) of 10 (4) of 33 
(range = 2-19) PRO protocol checklist items. Recommended items frequently 
omitted included the rationale and objectives underpinning PRO collection and 
approaches to minimize/address missing PRO data. Of 160 trials with published 
results, 61 (38.1%, 95% confidence interval = 30.6% to 45.7%) failed to include 
their PRO findings in any publication (mean 6.43-year follow-up); these trials 
included 49 568 participants. Although two-thirds of included trials published 
PRO findings, reporting standards were often inadequate according to 
international guidelines (mean [SD] inclusion of 3 [3] of 14 [range = 0-11]) 
CONSORT PRO Extension checklist items). More than one-half of trials publishing 
PRO results in a secondary publication (12 of 22, 54.5%) took 4 or more years to 
do so following trial closure, with eight (36.4%) taking 5-8 years and one trial 
publishing after 14 years.
CONCLUSIONS: PRO protocol content is frequently inadequate, and nonreporting of 
PRO findings is widespread, meaning patient-important information may not be 
available to benefit patients, clinicians, and regulators. Even where PRO data 
are published, there is often considerable delay and reporting quality is 
suboptimal. This study presents key recommendations to enhance the likelihood of 
successful delivery of PROs in the future.

DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this guidance statement is to provide advice to 
clinicians on breast cancer screening in average-risk women based on a review of 
existing guidelines and the evidence they include.
METHODS: This guidance statement is derived from an appraisal of selected 
guidelines from around the world that address breast cancer screening, as well 
as their included evidence. All national guidelines published in English between 
1 January 2013 and 15 November 2017 in the National Guideline Clearinghouse or 
Guidelines International Network library were included. In addition, the authors 
selected other guidelines commonly used in clinical practice. Web sites 
associated with all selected guidelines were checked for updates on 10 December 
2018. The AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) 
instrument was used to evaluate the quality of guidelines.
TARGET AUDIENCE AND PATIENT POPULATION: The target audience is all clinicians, 
and the target patient population is all asymptomatic women with average risk 
for breast cancer.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 1: In average-risk women aged 40 to 49 years, clinicians 
should discuss whether to screen for breast cancer with mammography before age 
50 years. Discussion should include the potential benefits and harms and a 
woman's preferences. The potential harms outweigh the benefits in most women 
aged 40 to 49 years.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 2: In average-risk women aged 50 to 74 years, clinicians 
should offer screening for breast cancer with biennial mammography.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 3: In average-risk women aged 75 years or older or in women 
with a life expectancy of 10 years or less, clinicians should discontinue 
screening for breast cancer.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 4: In average-risk women of all ages, clinicians should not 
use clinical breast examination to screen for breast cancer.

Successful management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has lengthened the 
life expectancy of HIV-positive (HIV + ) patients; consequently, increasing 
numbers of this patient population are candidates for total knee arthroplasty 
(TKA). This study seeks to provide detailed results of TKA in HIV+ patients and 
compare them to an HIV-negative (HIV - ) cohort. We performed a multicenter 
retrospective case-control study comparing 25 HIV+ patients to 25 HIV- patients 
undergoing TKA. The analysis included a cohort and subgroup stratification based 
on the presence or absence of postoperative complications. Prior to TKA, all 25 
patients had a documented history of HIV infection. No intraoperative 
complications were reported. Ninety-day postoperative complications included 
knee contracture (one HIV + , no HIV - , p = 0.3124), periprosthetic joint 
infection requiring revision (one HIV + , no HIV - , p = 0.3124), mechanical 
fall requiring incision and drainage (one HIV + , no HIV - , p = 0.3124), and 
death (one HIV + , no HIV - , p = 0.3124). The average follow-up was 18.80 
months. HIV+ patients stayed in the hospital for an average of 3.8 days 
following surgery, which was significantly greater than HIV- patients (2.28 
days; p = 0.0040). As the life expectancy for HIV+ patients improves, a greater 
number will be TKA candidates. This study has shown an acceptable postoperative 
complication risk in an HIV+ patient population undergoing TKA, albeit with a 
significantly increased hospital length of stay.

Shelf-Life Extension of Vacuum Packaged Frankfurters Made from Beef Inoculated 
with Streptococcus lactis.

Fresh beef, containing .5% dextrose, was inoculated with Streptococcus lactis , 
incubated for 3, 5 and 7 d at 7±1°C, and then used to manufacture frankfurters. 
The frankfurters were vacuum-packaged and stored for 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks at 
3±1°C. Microbial quality was evaluated by examining frankfurters for aerobic and 
psychrotrophic counts at the end of each storage period. The level of nisin, an 
antibiotic substance produced by this strain of S. lactis , was also monitored 
in fresh meat and processed products. During the incubation period, no 
appreciable reduction in pH occurred in fresh meat. Growth of psychrotrophs was 
slower in treated than untreated fresh meat, but whether this was due to 
presence of nisin or competition resulting from the heavy inoculation with S. 
lactis is unclear. Before and after processing, nisin levels in the 5- and 7-d 
incubation-treated groups were higher than in the 3-d group, and all treated 
groups had higher nisin levels than untreated groups. Little difference in 
aerobic and psychrotrophic growth was noted with storage time between treated 
and untreated groups for the 3-d incubation period, but well defined differences 
were noted in the 5- and 7-d incubation groups, with aerobic growth in treated 
groups being significantly slowed through the 6-week storage period, and 
psychrotrophs being 1 to 1.5 log cycles lower at the 6-week evaluation. The 
growth patterns suggest that nisin played a role in the reduced growth rate of 
bacteria in treated groups.
