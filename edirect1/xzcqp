Systemic amyloidosis is a serious multiorgan disease with reduced life 
expectancy, irrespective of type. The impact of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
in managing this condition has been immense. The last decade in particular has 
seen a surge of interest in the assessment and evaluation of the heart in 
patients with systemic amyloidosis by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging 
(CMR), with approximately 85% of all publications on this subject arising in the 
last 10 years. This has been largely driven by the creation of new sequences and 
their subsequent modernisation and technical development, thereby rendering 
previously prohibitive methods clinically more relevant and applicable. In turn, 
this has led to an increased awareness and recognition of the disease. This 
review demonstrates how MRI has become a pivotal diagnostic tool in the 
assessment of cardiac amyloidosis over the last 2 decades, with the ability to 
track disease and predict mortality. Several different pathognomonic patterns of 
late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) are now recognised and are able to 
prognosticate. T1 mapping and extracellular volume (ECV) techniques have 
resulted in even earlier disease detection before LGE is even visible and along 
with T2 mapping, provide new insights into biology. As newer therapies also 
evolve and become available, the need for accurate tracking of cardiac disease 
response to treatment carries increasing importance. All these are examined in 
this review, mainly focussing on light-chain (AL) and transthyretin (ATTR) 
amyloidosis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been categorized by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) as the 6th leading cause of death in the United States. AD 
is a significant health-care burden because of its increased occurrence 
(specifically in the elderly population), and the lack of effective treatments 
and preventive methods. With an increase in life expectancy, the CDC expects AD 
cases to rise to 15 million by 2060. Aging has been previously associated with 
susceptibility to AD, and there are ongoing efforts to effectively differentiate 
between normal and AD age-related brain degeneration and memory loss. AD targets 
neuronal function and can cause neuronal loss due to the buildup of amyloid-beta 
plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Our study aims to identify 
temporal changes within gene expression profiles of healthy controls and AD 
subjects. We conducted a meta-analysis using publicly available microarray 
expression data from AD and healthy cohorts. For our meta-analysis, we selected 
datasets that reported donor age and gender, and used Affymetrix and Illumina 
microarray platforms (8 datasets, 2,088 samples). Raw microarray expression data 
were re-analyzed, and normalized across arrays. We then performed an analysis of 
variance, using a linear model that incorporated age, tissue type, sex, and 
disease state as effects, as well as study to account for batch effects, and 
included binary interactions between factors. Our results identified 3,735 
statistically significant (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05) gene expression 
differences between AD and healthy controls, which we filtered for biological 
effect (10% two-tailed quantiles of mean differences between groups) to obtain 
352 genes. Interesting pathways identified as enriched comprised of 
neurodegenerative diseases pathways (including AD), and also mitochondrial 
translation and dysfunction, synaptic vesicle cycle and GABAergic synapse, and 
gene ontology terms enrichment in neuronal system, transmission across chemical 
synapses and mitochondrial translation. Overall our approach allowed us to 
effectively combine multiple available microarray datasets and identify gene 
expression differences between AD and healthy individuals including full age and 
tissue type considerations. Our findings provide potential gene and pathway 
associations that can be targeted to improve AD diagnostics and potentially 
treatment or prevention.

Objective This opinion paper summarizes the main findings and recommendations of 
an advisory report on health and prolonging working life, which was requested by 
the Dutch Minister of Social Affairs and Employment. Methods The advisory report 
was compiled by a multidisciplinary committee of ten scientists appointed by the 
Health Council of The Netherlands. The committee`s aims were to (i) describe the 
health of the ageing population, (ii) describe how prolonging working life 
influences health, (iii) describe determinants, besides health, for prolonging 
working lives, and (iv) review the literature on interventions aimed at 
retaining or improving employability of older workers. Results The report was 
presented to the Minister on 26 June 2018. As the likelihood of health problems 
increases with age, prolonging working life may be difficult. In general, life 
expectancy increases and gains in life years and health seem mainly attributable 
to people aged >75 years. Work is good for mental health. However, it may be 
beneficial for mental health to stop working around the retirement age. Besides 
health, financial factors, lifestyle, motivation to work, and working conditions 
play a role in prolonging working life. A systematic review of the evidence 
indicated that interventions such as worksite health promotion or career 
development workshops can support older workers in this matter. Conclusions The 
Health Council advised the Dutch Government to focus on worksite health 
promotion and career development interventions as well as the improvement of 
their implementation. This requires a tailored approach as there is a large 
diversity in health among older workers and particularly between low- and 
high-educated people. With this in mind, it was further recommended to explore 
whether flexible pension schemes might better suit this diversity.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Unplanned pregnancies can lead to poorer maternal and 
child health outcomes. The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration committee 
rejected reclassifying a range of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) from 
prescription to pharmacist-only medicines in 2015, mainly based on safety 
concerns. Improving access to OCPs may encourage some women to use 
contraceptives or switch from other contraceptive methods. However, some adverse 
events may increase and some women may stop using condoms, increasing their risk 
of sexually transmitted infections. This study aimed to estimate the cost 
effectiveness of reclassifying OCPs from prescription to pharmacist-only.
PERSPECTIVE: Healthcare system.
SETTING: Australian primary care.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to synthesise data from a variety of sources. 
The model included all Australian women aged 15-49 years (N = 5,644,701). The 
time horizon was 35 years. Contraceptive use before reclassification was 
estimated using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia 
(HILDA) survey, while survey data informed use after reclassification. Health 
outcomes included pregnancies, pregnancy outcomes (live birth, miscarriage, 
stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy and abortion), sexually transmitted infections, 
adverse events (venous thromboembolism, depression, myocardial infarction and 
stroke), ovarian cancer cases and quality-adjusted life-years. Costs included 
those related to general practitioner and specialist consultations, 
contraceptives and other medicines, pharmacist time, hospitalisations and 
adverse events. All costs were reported in 2016 Australian Dollars. A 5% 
discount rate was applied to health outcomes and costs.
RESULTS: Reclassifying OCPs resulted in 85.70 million quality-adjusted 
life-years experienced and costs of $46,910.14 million over 35 years, vs. 
85.68 million quality-adjusted life-years experienced and costs of 
$50,274.95 million with OCPs remaining prescription-only. Thus, reclassifying 
OCPs was more effective and cost saving. However, a sensitivity analysis found 
that more research on the probability of pregnancy in women not using 
contraception and not trying to conceive is needed.
CONCLUSION: Reclassifying OCPs is likely to be considered cost effective by 
Australian decision makers.

The inhibition of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation by photo-oxygenation has become an 
effective way of treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). New near-infrared (NIR) 
activated treatment agents, which not only possess high photo-oxygenation 
efficiency, but also show low biotoxicity, are urgently needed. Herein, for the 
first time, it is demonstrated that NIR activated black phosphorus (BP) could 
serve as an effective nontoxic photo-oxidant for amyloid-β peptide in vitro and 
in vivo. The nanoplatform BP@BTA (BTA: one of thioflavin-T derivatives) 
possesses high affinity to the Aβ peptide due to specific amyloid selectivity of 
BTA. Importantly, under NIR light, BP@BTA can significantly generate a high 
quantum yield of singlet oxygen (1 O2 ) to oxygenate Aβ, thereby resulting in 
inhibiting the aggregation and attenuating Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, 
BP could finally degrade into nontoxic phosphate, which guarantees the 
biosafety. Using transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL2006 as AD model, the 
results demonstrate that the 1 O2 -generation system could dramatically promote 
life-span extension of CL2006 strain by decreasing the neurotoxicity of Aβ.

PURPOSE: To present the impact of the financial crisis on health status and 
dental health in Greece and compare it to the European Union and Finland and to 
identify any changes in health-related expenditure focusing on pharmaceutical 
expenditure and generic medicines.
DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Databases as Scopus, Pubmed, Google Scholar, World 
Health Organization, Eurostat, and Elstat were used.
FINDINGS: Indicators, such as mortality and life expectancy, show that there is 
no clear correlation between health deterioration and financial crisis while 
dental health has deteriorated. Out-of-pocket expenses were found to be 
catastrophic, and the use of generic medicines is still limited.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Proper prescribing of medicines, coverage of health care 
costs by the government, and cost savings from the use of generic medicines were 
implemented. As regards dental care, the state should focus on prevention as 
well as reinforcement of public dental care services.
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The break through idea is to compare the impact of the 
financial crisis on health indexes in Greece with the European Union and 
Finland, to focus on pharmaceutical expenditure, generic medicines, and dental 
health.

The Micra® leadless pacemaker has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in the 
short and mid-term as an alternative to conventional transvenous pacemakers. 
This technology provides a new solution, especially for patients without 
conventional venous approach and for older patients with atrial fibrillation 
presenting with symptomatic bradycardia. The advantages of this approach are 
multiple : a miniature technology therefore less invasive, short procedure, no 
stimulation leads, or need to create a surgical pocket with a reduced risk of 
infection. The pacemaker's battery has a life expectancy similar to that of a 
conventional transvenous pacemaker. In this article, we discuss the 
characteristics of Micra® versus the traditional transvenous pacemaker.

Publisher: Le stimulateur sans sonde Micra® a démontré à la fois sa sécurité et 
son efficacité, à court et moyen termes, comme alternative aux stimulateurs 
transveineux conventionnels. Cette technologie apporte une solution nouvelle, en 
particulier pour les patients sans abord veineux conventionnel et pour les 
patients plus âgés en fibrillation auriculaire, présentant des phases de 
bradycardies symptomatiques. Les avantages de cette approche sont multiples : 
une technologie miniature, donc moins invasive, une procédure courte, l’absence 
de sonde de stimulation, ou de nécessité de réaliser une poche chirurgicale avec 
diminution du risque infectieux. La batterie du pacemaker a une espérance de vie 
similaire à celle d’un pacemaker conventionnel transveineux. Dans cet article, 
nous discutons les caractéristiques du stimulateur sans sonde Micra® par rapport 
au stimulateur traditionnel transveineux.

The complexities of the borderline patient: how much more complex when 
considering physical health?

Castle DJ(1).

Author information:
(1)Professor, St Vincent's Hospital and The University of Melbourne, Fitzroy, 
VIC, Australia.

OBJECTIVE: Borderline Personality Disorder is associated with a substantially 
reduced life expectancy, mostly due to physical health conditions that are 
life-shortening. This clinical review highlights pertinent risk issues for such 
conditions in Borderline Personality Disorder and suggests ways in which 
clinicians might address these.
METHODS: Selective literature review.
RESULTS: People with Borderline Personality Disorder have a reduced life 
expectancy of some 20 years, attributable largely to physical health maladies, 
notably cardiovascular. Risk factors include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, poor 
diet and smoking. Added to these are other physical health problems, including 
poor sexual health, self-harm, substance use and blood-borne viruses. Chronic 
pain and opioid and benzodiazepine use are also common in people with Borderline 
Personality Disorder. Some psychiatric medications commonly used in people with 
Borderline Personality Disorder - notably certain antipsychotic agents - can add 
to the metabolic burden. Barriers to care include self-stigma and erratic 
adherence to medical care, as well as stigma on the part of clinicians, who 
often do not screen or provide adequate care for the physical health problems 
suffered by people with Borderline Personality Disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians need to be aware of the physical health problems in 
people with Borderline Personality Disorder and ensure appropriate screening and 
interventions, both preventative and therapeutic, are offered routinely.

BACKGROUND: Adolescent women treated for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) are at increased 
risk of breast cancer (BC). We evaluate the cost-utility of eight high-risk BC 
surveillance strategies for this population, including the Children's Oncology 
Group guideline of same-day annual mammography and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) beginning at age 25 years.
METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was used to simulate the life 
histories of a cohort of 500 000 25-year-old women treated for HL at age 15 
years. We estimated BC incidence and mortality, life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), health-care costs, and the relative 
cost-utility (incremental cost-utility ratio [ICUR]) under the eight assessed 
surveillance strategies. One-way sensitivity analysis enabled modeling of 
uncertainty evaluation. A publicly funded health-care payer perspective was 
adopted.
RESULTS: Costs across the eight screening strategies ranged from $32 643 to 
$43 739, whereas QALYs ranged from 24.419 to 24.480. In an incremental 
cost-effectiveness analysis, annual mammography beginning at age 25 years was 
associated with an ICUR of $43 000/QALY gained, annual MRI beginning at age 25 
years with a switch to annual mammography at age 50 years had an ICUR of 
$148 000/QALY, and annual MRI beginning at age 25 years had an ICUR of 
$227 222/QALY. Among all assessed surveillance strategies, the differences in 
life expectancy were small.
CONCLUSIONS: Current high-risk BC surveillance guidelines do not reflect the 
most cost-effective strategy in survivors of adolescent HL. The results suggest 
that groups at high risk of BC may require high-risk surveillance guidelines 
that reflect their specific risk profile.

OBJECTIVE: To assess socio-sanitary expenditure after the addition of omalizumab 
to standard treatment in the control of severe asthma and to analyse its 
effectiveness under standard clinical practice.
METHOD: Observational retrospective multicentre study conducted in 12  
pneumology services in the Valencian Community, Spain. Data from 186  patients 
were analysed. Results of the year before and after the addition of  omalizumab 
were compared. Effectiveness was calculated based on a 3-point  increase in the 
Asthma Control Test and a reduction in the number of  annual exacerbations. 
Utility was calculated by the number of quality  adjusted life years. The 
economic assessment included both direct and  indirect costs and results were 
expressed in terms of incremental cost- effectiveness and incremental 
cost-utility ratio.
RESULTS: Significant improvements were found in lung function, asthma control, 
quality of life, and quality adjusted life years between the  year before and 
after the introduction of omalizumab. Taking into account  direct and indirect 
costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness for each avoided  exacerbation was € 
1,789.28 (95% CI: € 1,019.13-3,038.12) and € 4,569.38 (95% CI: 
3,442.86-6,075.05) per 3-point increase in the Asthma Control Test score. The 
incremental cost-utility ratio per quality adjusted life years gained was € 
50,239.98 (95% CI: 37,209.88-68,923.84).
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of omalizumab to the treatment regime of patients with 
severe asthma is effective under standard clinical practice, decreases direct 
and indirect costs, and provides significant  improvements in the health status 
of patients.

OBJECTIVE: To quantitate the 2016 global and national burden of chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) attributable to ambient fine particulate matter air pollution ≤ 
2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5).
DESIGN: We used the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study data and methodologies 
to estimate the 2016 burden of CKD attributable to PM2.5 in 194 countries and 
territories. Population-weighted PM2.5 levels and incident rates of CKD for each 
country were curated from the GBD study publicly available data sources.
SETTING: GBD global and national data on PM2.5 and CKD.
PARTICIPANTS: 194 countries and territories.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We estimated the attributable burden of disease (ABD), 
years living with disability (YLD), years of life lost (YLL) and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
RESULTS: The 2016 global burden of incident CKD attributable to PM2.5 was 6 950 
514 (95% uncertainty interval: 5 061 533-8 914 745). Global YLD, YLL and DALYs 
of CKD attributable to PM2.5 were 2 849 311 (1 875 219-3 983 941), 8 587 735 (6 
355 784-10 772 239) and 11 445 397 (8 380 246-14 554 091), respectively. 
Age-standardised ABD, YLL, YLD and DALY rates varied substantially among 
geographies. Populations in Mesoamerica, Northern Africa, several countries in 
the Eastern Mediterranean region, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and several 
countries in Southeast Asia were among those with highest age-standardised DALY 
rates. For example, age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 were 543.35 
(391.16-707.96) in El Salvador, 455.29 (332.51-577.97) in Mexico, 408.41 
(283.82-551.84) in Guatemala, 238.25 (173.90-303.98) in India and 178.26 
(125.31-238.47) in Sri Lanka, compared with 5.52 (0.82-11.48) in Sweden, 6.46 
(0.00-14.49) in Australia and 12.13 (4.95-21.82) in Canada. Frontier analyses 
showed that Mesoamerican countries had significantly higher CKD DALY rates 
relative to other countries with comparable sociodemographic development.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the global toll of CKD attributable to 
ambient air pollution is significant and identify several endemic geographies 
where air pollution may be a significant driver of CKD burden. Air pollution may 
need to be considered in the discussion of the global epidemiology of CKD.

PURPOSE: Increased mortality rates have been found in those with a diagnosis of 
psychosis; studies suggest a shortened life expectancy of up to 20 years less 
than that of the general population. This study aimed to investigate the 
mortality of a first episode psychosis cohort at 20-year follow-up, compare it 
to that of the general Irish population, and explore whether the mortality gap 
has changed over time.
METHODS: 171 individuals diagnosed with a first episode psychosis identified 
between 1995 and 1999 in a community mental health service were traced. 
Mortality was established by matching death certificates to deceased cohort 
members (using name, age at date of death, and address at date of death). Date 
of first presentation to service was used as date of entry point and date of 
death or end of follow-up as the end point.
RESULTS: Of the 171 cases there were 20 deaths during follow-up. Nine deaths 
were attributed to natural causes; 7 to unnatural causes; and 4 were unknown. 
Comparing standardised mortality rates at 20-year follow-up to those at 12 year 
showed a reduction in rates over time.
CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that the mortality gap in people with schizophrenia 
and other psychoses remains high, especially in young males.

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic disease at birth; on average, it 
affects 1 in 700 newborns. The syndrome features cognitive impairment, 
susceptibility to certain diseases, and (in some cases) congenital 
malformations. Improvements in medical care for people with DS have led to an 
increase in life expectancy. Furthermore, the systematic provision of specific 
support during childhood improves cognitive function and autonomy in adulthood. 
Consequently, patients and their families are now seeking the same rights as 
healthy people. Access to procreation is an emerging debate. The presumption of 
infertility in DS is based on a few old studies. Down syndrome appears to cause 
spermatogenesis defects in men and premature menopause in women. When assisted 
reproductive technology makes it possible to solve these problems, the question 
of fertility in DS must be addressed. Without entering into highly controversial 
ethical considerations related to parenthood for people with DS, we reviewed the 
literature on fertility in DS and tried to specify the associated genetic risk.

BACKGROUND: Although thyroidectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures 
performed worldwide, some permanent complications, despite the considerably 
reducing incidence, may affect dramatically the patients quality of life. The 
purpose of this study is to evaluate whether factors identified preoperatively 
and expressed in a score could be predictors of major surgical difficulty during 
total thyroidectomy and influence the incidence of complications.
METHODS: A total of 164 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy were 
examined. For each patient we calculated a preoperative score, including seven 
parameters, which we evaluated to be predictors of difficulty in thyroid 
surgery, that is, sex, body mass index (BMI), neck length, neck extension, 
thyroid gland volume, thyroiditis, and increased parenchymal vascularization. 
The overall score was also compared with peri- and post-operative factors 
describing objectively the difficulty in thyroid surgery. These factors are the 
duration of the operation, the length of hospitalization, the incidence of 
complications such as hemorrhage, hypoparathyroidism, and recurrent laryngeal 
nerve injuries.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant association between our score 
and either the percentage of postoperative complications or the length of 
hospitalization. The operative time was the only variable remarkably associated 
with the score value (p < 0.00001). Comparing the duration of the operation with 
each of the preoperative predictive factors, we found that none of the factors 
reached the value of statistical significance, but a close association could be 
noted with the thyroid volume and the BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, predictors of difficulty in thyroidectomy did not 
affect morbidity rates, as suggested by previous studies, but only operative 
times, which were significantly increased in patients with higher score. 
Although our results have limited statistical significance, they allow us to 
confirm the fundamental role of a systematic use of optical magnification and 
microsurgical technique in thyroidectomy. Further studies, with a larger cohort 
of patients, are needed to validate our results and to formulate a universally 
accepted predictive score of difficulty in thyroidectomy preoperatively.

BACKGROUND: Dutch cardiovascular risk management guidelines state almost every 
older adult (≥70 years) is eligible for a lipid lowering drug (LLD). However, 
life expectancy, frailty or comorbidities may influence this treatment decision.
OBJECTIVE: investigate how many older adults, according to age, frailty 
(Drubbel-frailty index) and comorbidities were prescribed LLDs.
METHODS: data of 244,328 adults ≥70 years from electronic health records of 415 
Dutch general practices from 2011-15 were used. Number of LLD prescriptions in 
patients with (n = 55,309) and without (n = 189,019) cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) was evaluated according to age, frailty and comorbidities.
RESULTS: about 69% of adults ≥70 years with CVD and 36% without CVD were 
prescribed a LLD. LLD prescriptions decreased with age; with CVD: 78% aged 70-74 
years and 29% aged ≥90 years were prescribed a LLD, without CVD: 37% aged 70-74 
years and 12% aged ≥90 years. In patients with CVD and within each age group, 
percentage of LLD prescriptions was 20% point(pp) higher in frail compared with 
non-frail. In patients without CVD, percentage of LLD prescriptions in frail 
patients was 11pp higher in adults aged 70-74 years and 40pp higher in adults 
aged ≥90 years compared to non-frail. Similar trends were seen in the analyses 
with number of comorbidities.
CONCLUSION: in an older population, LLD prescriptions decreased with age 
but-contrary to our expectations-LLD prescriptions increased with higher frailty 
levels.

Potential determinants of health system efficiency: Evidence from Latin America 
and the Caribbean.

This paper examines the levels of health system efficiency and their possible 
determinants across Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries using 
national-level data for those countries, as well as for other emerging and 
developed countries. The data are analyzed using data envelopment analyses and 
econometric advances that yield reliable estimations of the relationship between 
system efficiency and its potential determinants. We find that there is 
substantial room for efficiency improvements in the health system of most LAC 
countries. For example, LAC countries could improve life expectancy at birth by 
about five years on average at current public spending levels if they followed 
best practices. Furthermore, the paper assesses what factors amenable to policy 
act as the main possible levers for some countries to be able to translate a 
given level of health financing into better performance on access to care and 
health outcomes. Our econometric analyses suggest that efforts to increase 
health system efficiency could be focused in a few key policy areas associated 
with broader access to health services and better outcomes. These areas include 
general governance aspects, in addition to improvements in specific dimensions 
of the quality of health system institutions, notably stronger reliance on 
results-based management in the production of healthcare goods and services.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic disease caused by mutation of Cftr. 
CF-associated liver disease (CFLD) is a common nonpulmonary cause of mortality 
in CF and accounts for approximately 2.5%-5% of overall CF mortality. The peak 
of the disease is in the pediatric population, but a second wave of liver 
disease in CF adults has been reported in the past decade in association with an 
increase in the life expectancy of these patients. New drugs are available to 
correct the basic defect in CF but their efficacy in CFLD is not known. The 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, expressed in the apical 
membrane of cholangiocytes, is a major determinant for bile secretion and CFLD 
classically has been considered a channelopathy. However, the recent findings of 
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator as a regulator of 
epithelial innate immunity and the possible influence of the intestinal disease 
with an altered microbiota on the liver complication have opened new mechanistic 
insights on the pathogenesis of CFLD. This review provides an overview of the 
current understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and discusses a 
potential target for intervention.

Due to increasing life expectancy incidence of neurological disorders is rapidly 
rising, thus adding urgency to develop effective strategies for treatment. Stem 
cell-based therapies were considered highly promising and while progress in this 
field is evident, outcomes of clinical trials are rather disappointing. 
Suboptimal engraftment, poor cell survival and uncontrolled differentiation may 
be the reasons behind dismal results. Clearly, new direction is needed and we 
postulate that with recent progress in biomaterials and bioprinting, 
regenerative approaches for neurological applications may be finally successful. 
The use of biomaterials aids engraftment of stem cells, protects them from 
harmful microenvironment and importantly, it facilitates the incorporation of 
cell-supporting molecules. The biomaterials used in bioprinting (the bioinks) 
form a scaffold for embedding the cells/biomolecules of interest, but also could 
be exploited as a source of endogenous contrast or supplemented with contrast 
agents for imaging. Additionally, bioprinting enables patient-specific 
customization with shape/size tailored for actual needs. In stroke or traumatic 
brain injury for example lesions are localized and focal, and usually progress 
with significant loss of tissue volume creating space that could be filled with 
artificial tissue using bioprinting modalities. The value of imaging for 
bioprinting technology is advantageous on many levels including design of custom 
shapes scaffolds based on anatomical 3D scans, assessment of performance and 
integration after scaffold implantation, or to learn about the degradation over 
time. In this review, we focus on bioprinting technology describing different 
printing techniques and properties of biomaterials in the context of 
requirements for neurological applications. We also discuss the need for in vivo 
imaging of implanted materials and tissue constructs reviewing applicable 
imaging modalities and type of information they can provide. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE: Current stem cell-based regenerative strategies for neurological 
diseases are ineffective due to inaccurate engraftment, low cell viability and 
suboptimal differentiation. Bioprinting and embedding stem cells within 
biomaterials at high precision, including building complex multi-material and 
multi-cell type composites may bring a breakthrough in this field. We provide 
here comprehensive review of bioinks, bioprinting techniques applicable to 
application for neurological disorders. Appreciating importance of longitudinal 
monitoring of implanted scaffolds, we discuss advantages of various imaging 
modalities available and suitable for imaging biomaterials in the central 
nervous system. Our goal is to inspire new experimental approaches combining 
imaging, biomaterials/bioinks, advanced manufacturing and tissue engineering 
approaches, and stimulate interest in image-guided therapies based on 
bioprinting.

OBJECTIVECancer patients suffering from severe refractory pain may benefit from 
targeted ablative neurosurgical procedures aimed to disconnect pain pathways in 
the spinal cord or the brain. These patients often present with a plethora of 
medical problems requiring careful consideration before surgical interventions. 
The authors present their experience at an interdisciplinary clinic aimed to 
facilitate appropriate patient selection for neurosurgical procedures, and the 
outcome of these interventions.METHODSThis study was a retrospective review of 
all patients who underwent neurosurgical interventions for cancer pain in the 
authors' hospital between March 2015 and April 2018. All patients had advanced 
metastatic cancer with limited life expectancy and suffered from intractable 
oncological pain.RESULTSSixty patients underwent surgery during the study 
period. Forty-three patients with localized pain underwent disconnection of the 
spinal pain pathways: 34 percutaneous-cervical and 5 open-thoracic cordotomies, 
2 stereotactic mesencephalotomies, and 2 midline myelotomies. Thirty-nine of 42 
patients (93%) who completed these procedures had excellent immediate 
postoperative pain relief. At 1 month the improvement was maintained in 30/36 
patients (83%) available for follow-up. There was 1 case of hemiparesis.Twenty 
patients with diffuse pain underwent stereotactic cingulotomy. Nineteen of these 
patients reported substantial pain relief immediately after the operation. At 1 
month good pain relief was maintained in 13/17 patients (76%) available for 
follow-up, and good pain relief was also found at 3 months in 7/11 patients 
(64%). There was no major morbidity or mortality.CONCLUSIONSWith careful patient 
selection and tailoring of the appropriate procedure to the patient's pain 
syndrome, the authors' experience indicates that neurosurgical procedures are 
safe and effective in alleviating suffering in patients with intractable cancer 
pain.
