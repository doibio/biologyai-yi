given that very sick patients may be transferred to regional hospitals.
DESIGN: In this ecologic study, we combined Medicare hospital mortality ratings 
(N = 1267) with US census data, critical access hospital classification, and 
National Center for Health Statistics urban-rural county classifications. 
Ratings included mortality for coronary artery bypass grafting, stroke, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia across 
277 California hospitals between July 2011 and June 2014. We used generalized 
estimating equations to evaluate the association of urban-rural county 
classifications on mortality ratings.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Unfavorable Medicare hospital mortality rating "worse 
than the national rate" compared with "better" or "same."
RESULTS: Compared with large central "metro" (metropolitan) counties, hospitals 
in medium-sized metro counties had 6.4 times the odds of rating "worse than the 
national rate" for hospital mortality (95% confidence interval = 2.8-14.8, p < 
0.001). For hospitals in small metro counties, the odds of having such a rating 
were 3.7 times greater (95% confidence interval = 0.7-23.4, p = 0.12), although 
not statistically significant. Few ratings were provided for rural counties, and 
analysis of rural counties was underpowered.
CONCLUSION: Hospitals in medium-sized metro counties are associated with 
unfavorable Medicare mortality ratings, but current methods to assign mortality 
ratings may hinder fair comparisons. Patient transfers from rural locations to 
regional medical centers may contribute to these results, a potential factor 
that future research should examine.

We previously reported that mice intracerebrally inoculated with the 
mouse-adapted scrapie strain ME7 have markedly diminished T zones in the spleen 
due to the decreased expression of CCL19 and CCL21. In addition, follicular 
dendritic cell networks in germinal centers were larger in ME7-infected spleens 
compared to uninfected spleens. As an extension of that study, we set out to 
determine how ME7 infection affects spleen structure and follicular helper T 
(Tfh) cell responses in mice. For this study, mice were intraperitoneally 
inoculated with brain homogenate of the ME7 inoculum and spleens were analyzed 
50, 130, and 200 days after inoculation and compared with those from uninfected 
mice. The result showed that ME7- infected mice had increased Tfh cell responses 
which were maintained until end-stage prion disease. Although CD4 T cells 
decreased in white pulps, they increased in germinal centers, and expressed 
higher levels of the Tfh-related genes, such as Bcl6, Il21, Cxcr5, Icos, and 
Pdcd1. In addition, ME7-infected spleens had increased numbers of CD4 memory T 
cells. These data indicate that although ME7 infection led to impaired splenic 
white pulp structure, CD4 memory T cells were increased and Tfh cell responses 
were required and prolonged to provide help for the replication and accumulation 
of pathogenic prion protein in germinal centers.

Cancer is a disease associated with ageing. Increased life expectancy means that 
cancer in older adults is becoming an increasingly common problem. There are 
unique issues to consider when making decisions about cancer treatment in older 
populations. Unfortunately, however, this group is still under-represented in 
clinical trials for new cancer therapies meaning there are less evidence-based 
data to guide management. This article aims to look at how we can optimise the 
cancer treatment for older patients with a focus on systemic anti-cancer therapy 
and addressing particular issues around patient selection, improving treatment 
tolerance and use of newer agents with different toxicity profiles.

Survival of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients increased over the last 
decade due to increased use of secondary preventive medication and rapid 
revascularization of PAD patients. Angiogenetic markers such as vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and its receptor Tie-2 
might be useful markers to assess the residual risk for mortality in PAD 
patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate angiogenetic markers for the 
prediction of mortality in a PAD cohort. For this purpose, 366 patients (mean 
age: 69 ± 10 years) with PAD Fontaine stage I or II were included and followed 
up over a 5-year study period. Serum Ang-2, Tie-2 and VEGF levels were measured 
by bead-based multiplex assay. All-cause mortality and major cardiovascular 
events (MACE) including all-cause death, non-fatal stroke and non-fatal 
myocardial infarction were analysed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses 
after 5 years. Ang-2 was associated with Tie-2 (R = 0.151, p = 0.006) and VEGF 
levels (R = 0.160, p = 0.002). However, only Ang-2 was linked to all all-cause 
mortality in PAD patients (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.55 [1.23-2.15], p = 0.008) even 
after adjustment for age and gender, haemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate (HR: 1.44 
[1.03-2.00], p = 0.032). Furthermore, an association of Ang-2 and MACE in PAD 
patients (HR: 1.36 (1.03-1.78), p = 0.028) was found. This result implies that 
Ang-2 might be used as an additional marker to stratify PAD patients to predict 
poor mid-term life expectancy.

Cost-effectiveness of cladribine tablets, alemtuzumab, and natalizumab in the 
treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with high disease activity 
in England.

AIMS: Cladribine tablets were the first oral short-course treatment approved for 
highly active relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). The Association of British 
Neurologists guidelines currently recommend two infusion therapies, alemtuzumab 
and natalizumab, to treat high disease activity relapsing remitting MS 
(HDA-RRMS). This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of cladribine tablets 
in HDA-RRMS compared with alemtuzumab and natalizumab, from the perspective of 
the National Health Service (NHS) in England.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model with 11 health states (10 
Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] plus death) was developed. Transition 
matrices from the British Columbia registry were used to model the natural 
history of EDSS. The treatment effect on EDSS was modelled using hazard ratios 
for 6-month confirmed disability progression from an indirect treatment 
comparison (ITC). Relapses and drug-related adverse events were modeled via 
annualized relapse rates and event probabilities, with associated costs and 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) losses. Utilities were derived from trials and 
the literature, and costs from NHS and literature sources. Uncertainty was 
assessed via probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Cladribine tablets were dominant (i.e., less costly and more effective) 
vs alemtuzumab and natalizumab in pairwise comparisons, and the dominant 
strategy in fully incremental analyses. Incremental cost was driven largely by 
drug acquisition and administration costs, and incremental QALY gain largely by 
differences in delayed EDSS progression. Cladribine tablets had a 93% 
probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of GBP 30,000 per QALY 
gained, and remained dominant across the scenario analyses tested. The greatest 
influence on results was the treatment effect on disability progression derived 
from the ITC.
LIMITATIONS: Uncertainty over the efficacy of DMT beyond trial durations. In 
line with other comparative effectiveness analyses, the network meta-analysis 
informing this cost-effectiveness analysis was associated with a degree of 
uncertainty. No treatment switching analyses were undertaken.
CONCLUSIONS: Cladribine tablets are a cost-effective alternative to alemtuzumab 
and natalizumab in the treatment of HDA-RRMS from the perspective of the NHS in 
England.

BACKGROUND: Several large scale community-based cardiovascular disease 
prevention programs were initiated in the 80s, and one was the Västerbotten 
Intervention Programme, Sweden. As an initial step in 1985, a pilot study was 
introduced in the Norsjö municipality that combined individual disease 
prevention efforts among the middle-aged population with community-oriented 
health promotion activities. All citizens at 30, 40, 50, and 60 years of age 
were invited to a physical examination combined with a healthy dialogue at the 
local primary health care centre. Västerbotten Intervention Program is still 
running following the same lines and is now a part of the ordinary public health 
in the county. The purpose of this study is to estimate the costs of running 
Västerbotten Intervention Programme from 1990 to 2006, versus the health gains 
and savings reasonably attributable to the program during the same time period.
METHODS: A previous study estimated the number of prevented deaths during the 
period 1990-2006 which can be attributed to the programme. We used this estimate 
and calculated the number of QALYs gained, as well as savings in resources due 
to prevented non-fatal cases during the time period 1990 to 2006. Costs for the 
programmes were based on previously published scientific articles as well as 
current cost data from the county council, who is responsible for the programme.
RESULT: The cost per QALY gained from a societal perspective is SEK 650 (Euro 
68). From a health care sector perspective, the savings attributable to the VIP 
exceeded its costs.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that Västerbotten Intervention Programme is 
extremely cost-effective in relation to the Swedish threshold value (SEK 500000 
per QALY gained or Euro 53,000 per QALY gained). Other research has also shown a 
favorable effect of Västerbotten Intervention Programme on population health and 
the health gap. We therefore argue that all health care organizations, acting in 
settings reasonably similar to Sweden, have good incentive to implement programs 
like Västerbotten Intervention Programme.

Documentation requirements for the Indonesian integrated antenatal care (ANC) 
program suggest the need for electronic systems to address gaps in existing 
paper documentation practices. Our goals were to quantify midwives' 
documentation completeness in a primary healthcare center, understand 
documentation challenges, develop a tool, and assess intention to use the tool. 
We analyzed existing ANC records in a primary healthcare center in Bangkalan, 
East Java, and conducted interviews with stakeholders to understand needs for an 
electronic system in support of ANC. Development of the web-based Electronic 
Integrated ANC (e-iANC) system used the System Development Life Cycle method. 
Training on the use of the system was held in the computer laboratory for 100 
midwives chosen from four primary healthcare centers in each of five regions. 
The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) questionnaire was 
used to assess their intention to adopt e-iANC. The midwives' intention to adopt 
e-iANC was significantly influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy 
and facilitating conditions. Age, education level, and computer literacy did not 
significantly moderate the effects of performance expectancy and effort 
expectancy on adoption intention. The UTAUT results indicated that the factors 
that might influence intention to adopt e-iANC are potentially addressable. 
Results suggest that e-iANC might well be accepted by midwives.

Current Indian guidelines recommend twice-annual CD4 testing to monitor 
first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART), with a plasma HIV RNA test to confirm 
failure if CD4 declines, which would prompt a switch to second-line ART. We used 
a mathematical model to assess the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of 
alternative laboratory monitoring strategies in India. We simulated a cohort of 
HIV-infected patients initiating first-line ART and compared 11 strategies with 
combinations of CD4 and HIV RNA testing at varying frequencies. We included 
adaptive strategies that reduce the frequency of tests after 1 year from 6 to 12 
months for virologically suppressed patients. We projected life expectancy, time 
on failed first-line ART, cumulative 10-year HIV transmissions, lifetime cost 
(2014 US dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We defined 
strategies as cost-effective if their ICER was <1 × the Indian per capita gross 
domestic product (GDP, $1,600). We found that the current Indian guidelines 
resulted in a per person life expectancy (from mean age 37) of 150.2 months and 
a per person cost of $2,680. Adding annual HIV RNA testing increased survival by 
∼8 months; adaptive strategies were less expensive than similar nonadaptive 
strategies with similar life expectancy. The most effective strategy with an 
ICER <1 × GDP was the adaptive HIV RNA strategy (ICER $840/year). Cumulative 
10-year transmissions decreased from 27.2/1,000 person-years with 
standard-of-care to 20.9/1,000 person-years with adaptive HIV RNA testing. In 
India, routine HIV RNA monitoring of patients on first-line ART would increase 
life expectancy, decrease transmissions, be cost-effective, and should be 
implemented.

Essential oils have received increasing attention as natural additives for the 
shelf-life extension of food products due to the risk in using synthetic 
preservatives. Synthetic additives can reduce food spoilage, but the present 
generation is very health conscious and believes in natural products rather than 
synthetic ones due to their potential toxicity and other concerns. Therefore, 
one of the major emerging technologies is the extraction of essential oils from 
several plant organs and their application to foods. Essential oils are a good 
source of several bioactive compounds, which possess antioxidative and 
antimicrobial properties, so their use can be very useful to extend shelf-life 
in food products. Although essential oils have been shown to be promising 
alternative to chemical preservatives, they present special limitations that 
must be solved before their application in food systems. Low water solubility, 
high volatility, and strong odor are the main properties that make it difficult 
for food applications. Recent advances that refer to new forms of application to 
avoid these problems are currently under study. Their application into packaging 
materials and coated films but also directly into the food matrix as emulsions, 
nanoemulsions, and coating are some of their new applications among others.

BACKGROUND: While combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has significantly 
improved survival times for persons diagnosed with HIV, estimation of life 
expectancy (LE) for this cohort remains a challenge, as mortality rates are a 
function of both time since diagnosis and age, and mortality rates for the 
oldest age groups may not be available.
METHODS: A validated case-finding algorithm for HIV was used to update the 
cohort of HIV-positive adults who had entered care in Ontario, Canada as of 
2012. The Chiang II abridged life table algorithm was modified to use mortality 
rates stratified by time since entering the cohort and to include various 
methods for extrapolation of the excess HIV mortality rates to older age groups.
RESULTS: As of 2012, there were approximately 15,000 adults in care for HIV in 
Ontario. The crude all-cause mortality rate declined from 2.6% (95%CI 2.3, 2.9) 
per year in 2000 to 1.3% (1.2, 1.5) in 2012. Mortality rates were elevated for 
the first year of care compared to subsequent years (rate ratio of 2.6 (95% CI 
2.3, 3.1)). LE for a 20-year old living in Ontario was 62 years (expected age at 
death is 82), while LE for a 20-year old with HIV was estimated to be reduced to 
47 years, for a loss of 15 years of life. Ignoring the higher mortality rates 
among new cases introduced a modest bias of 1.5 additional years of life lost. 
In comparison, using 55+ as the open-ended age group was a major source of bias, 
adding 11 years to the calculated LE.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of age limits less than the expected age at death for the 
open-ended age group significantly overstates the estimated LE and is not 
recommended. The Chiang II method easily accommodated input of stratified 
mortality rates and extrapolation of excess mortality rates.

CBT for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a strong challenge to the 
contention that common factors explain most of the variance in outcomes in all 
therapies and all disorders, given that the treatment is focused and placebo 
response is low. In this study, the relative contributions of expectancy and 
therapeutic alliance as predictors of outcome in the treatment of OCD are 
examined and compared to the contribution of specific treatment effects. One 
hundred and eight patients with OCD were randomly assigned to two forms of CBT: 
exposure and response prevention (EX/RP) or stress management training (SMT). 
Measures of OCD symptoms, quality of life, therapist and patient expectancy and 
alliance were collected at several timepoints. Treatment type was a 
substantially stronger predictor of symptom reduction compared to alliance and 
expectancy. However, neither specific nor common factors predicted improvement 
in quality of life very well. Only in EX/RP, symptom change was associated with 
subsequent changes in alliance. Finally, therapist effects were estimated using 
Bayesian methods and were negligible. In the context of CBT for OCD, the data 
support the specific factor model, and suggest that the relative contribution of 
common vs. specific factors likely varies by disorder and by treatment type.

INTRODUCTION: Few studies have confirmed the cost-saving of telemonitoring of 
users with pacemakers (PMs). The purpose of this controlled, non-randomised, 
non-masked clinical trial was to perform an economic assessment of 
telemonitoring (TM) of users with PMs and check whether TM offers a cost-utility 
alternative to conventional follow-up in hospital.
METHODS: Eighty-two patients implanted with an internet-based transmission PM 
were selected to receive either conventional follow-up in hospital ( n = 52) or 
TM ( n = 30) from their homes. The data were collected during 12 months while 
patients were being monitored. The economic assessment of the PONIENTE study was 
performed as per the perspectives of National Health Service (NHS) and patients. 
A cost-utility analysis was conducted to measure whether the TM of patients with 
PMs is cost-effective in terms of costs per gained quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs).
RESULTS: There was a significant cost-saving for participants in the TM group in 
comparison with the participants in the conventional follow-up group. From the 
NHS's perspective, the patients in the TM group gained 0.09 QALYs more than the 
patients in the conventional follow-up group over 12 months, with a cost saving 
of 57.64% (€46.51 versus €109.79, respectively; p < 0.001) per participant per 
year. In-office visits were reduced by 52.49% in the TM group. The costs related 
to the patient perspective were lower in the TM group than in the conventional 
follow-up group (€31.82 versus €73.48, respectively; p < 0.005). The costs per 
QALY were 61.68% higher in the in-office monitoring group.
DISCUSSION: The cost-utility analysis performed in the PONIENTE study showed 
that the TM of users with PMs appears to be a significant cost-effective 
alternative to conventional follow-up in hospital.

BACKGROUND: Sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) might both 
provide survival benefit for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Adopting 
either as a first-line therapy carries major cost and resource implications. We 
aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of sorafenib and TACE in advanced HCC.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed in a hypothetical cohort of patients 
aged 60 years with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A/B cirrhosis over a 2-year time 
frame. Three strategies (full or dose-adjusted sorafenib and TACE) were compared 
in two cost settings: China and the USA. Transition probabilities, utility and 
costs were extracted from systematic review of 27 articles. Sensitivity analysis 
and Monte Carlo analysis were conducted.
RESULTS: Full and dose-adjusted sorafenib respectively produced 0.435 and 0.482 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) while TACE produced 0.375 QALYs. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of full-dose sorafenib versus TACE 
was $101,028.83/QALY in China whereas full-dose sorafenib is a dominant strategy 
(ICER of -$1,014,507.20/ QALY) compared with TACE in the USA. Compared to 
full-dose sorafenib, dose-adjusted sorafenib was the dominant strategy with the 
negative ICERs in both China (-$132,238.94/QALY) and the USA 
(-$230,058.09/QALY). However, dose-adjusted sorafenib is not available 
currently, so full-dose sorafenib should be compared with TACE. As the 
acceptability curves shown, full-dose sorafenib was the optimal strategy at the 
accepted thresholds of WTP in these two countries. Specifically, full-dose 
sorafenib was the cost-effective treatment compared with TACE if a WTP was set 
above $21,670 in the USA, whereas in China, TACE could be more favorable than 
full-dose sorafenib if a WTP was set below $10,473.
CONCLUSIONS: Dose-adjusted sorafenib may be cost-effective compared to full-dose 
sorafenib or TACE for advanced HCC patients. However, when confining the 
comparisons between full-dose sorafenib and TACE, full-dose sorafenib was 
cost-effective for these patients, under the accepted thresholds of WTP.

BACKGROUND: Hirudin is a potent thrombin inhibitor but its antithrombotic 
properties are offset by bleeding side-effects. Because hirudin's N-terminus 
must engage thrombin's active site for effective inhibition, fusing a cleavable 
peptide at this site may improve hirudin's risk/benefit ratio as a therapeutic 
agent. Previously we engineered a plasmin cleavage site (C) between human serum 
albumin (HSA) and hirudin variant 3 (HV3) in fusion protein HSACHV3. Because 
coagulation factor XI (FXI) is more involved in thrombosis than hemostasis, we 
hypothesized that making HV3 activity FXIa-dependent would also improve HV3's 
potential therapeutic profile. We combined albumin fusion for half-life 
extension of hirudin with positioning of an FXIa cleavage site N-terminal to 
HV3, and assessed in vitro and in vivo properties of this novel protein.
RESULTS: FXIa cleavage site EPR was employed. Fusion protein EPR-HV3HSA but not 
HSAEPR-HV3 was activated by FXIa in vitro. FVIIa, FXa, FXIIa, or plasmin failed 
to activate EPR-HV3HSA. FXIa-cleavable EPR-HV3HSA reduced the time to occlusion 
of ferric chloride-treated murine arteries and reduced fibrin deposition in 
murine endotoxemia; noncleavable mycHV3HSA was without effect. EPR-HV3HSA 
elicited less blood loss than constitutively active HV3HSA in murine liver 
laceration or tail transection but extended bleeding time to the same extent. 
EPR-HV3HSA was partially activated in citrated human or murine plasma to a 
greater extent than HSACHV3.
CONCLUSIONS: Releasing the N-terminal block to HV3 activity using FXIa was an 
effective way to limit hirudin's bleeding side-effects, but plasma instability 
of the exposed EPR blocking peptide rendered it less useful than previously 
described plasmin-activatable HSACHV3.

With increased life expectancy and aging of the population, aortic stenosis is 
now one of the most common valvular heart diseases. Early recognition and 
management of aortic stenosis are of paramount importance because untreated 
symptomatic severe disease is universally fatal. The advent of transcather 
aortic valve replacement technologies provides exciting avenues of care to 
patients with this disease in whom traditional surgical procedures could not be 
performed or were associated with high risk. This review for clinicians offers 
an overview of aortic stenosis and updated information on the current status of 
various treatment strategies. An electronic literature search of PubMed, 
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus was performed from conception July 1, 2016, through 
November 30, 2017, using the terms aortic stenosis, aortic valve replacement, 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), transcatheter aortic valve 
insertion (TAVI), surgical aortic valve replacement, aortic stenosis 
flow-gradient patterns, low-flow aortic valve stenosis, natural history, stress 
testing, pathophysiology, bicuspid aortic valve, and congenital aortic valve 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about adults living with a Fontan circulation's 
concerns outside the scope of their clinical outcomes. We examined adults with a 
Fontan circulations' greatest concerns, as well as their concerns around 
anti-coagulation, pregnancy and finances.
METHODS: Adults with a Fontan circulation in the Australian and New Zealand 
Fontan Registry were invited to complete an anonymous online survey, of which 57 
participated. A qualitative method approach using thematic analyses was used.
RESULTS: The greatest concerns for adults living with a Fontan circulation were 
fear of death/uncertainty around life expectancy which for many individuals 
colored their concerns around physical health, pregnancy and having children, 
quality of life and finances. Improving information about outcomes to patients 
with a Fontan circulation might alleviate uncertainties about their future.
CONCLUSIONS: Fear of death is the primary concern of adults with a Fontan 
circulation. It may require improved communication and targeted psychological 
interventions. Physical exercise incorporated as part of their lifestyle should 
be encouraged to alleviate physical concerns and also improve psychological 
well-being.

OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Heparin coating has recently been shown to reduce the risk 
of graft failure in arterial revascularisation, at least transiently. The aim of 
this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of heparin coated versus 
standard polytetrafluoroethylene grafts for bypass surgery in peripheral artery 
disease from a long-term healthcare system perspective.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness evaluation was conducted alongside the Danish part 
of the Scandinavian Propaten trial in which 431 patients planned for 
femoro-femoral or femoro-popliteal bypass surgery were randomised to either type 
of graft and followed for 5 years. Based on the intention to treat principle, 
the differences in healthcare costs (general practice, prescription medication, 
hospital admission, rehabilitation, and long-term care in 2015 Euros), life 
years (LYs), and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were analysed as arithmetic 
means with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. Cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curves were used to illustrate the probability of 
cost-effectiveness for a range of threshold values of willingness to pay (WTP).
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences between the randomisation 
groups were observed for costs or gains of LYs or QALYs. The average cost per 
QALY was estimated at €10,792. For a WTP threshold of €40,000 per QALY, the 
overall probability of cost-effectiveness was estimated at 62%, but owing to 
cost savings in patients with critical ischaemia (cost per QALY <€0), it 
increased to 89% for this subgroup.
CONCLUSION: Until further evidence, heparin coated grafts appear overall, to be 
cost-effective over standard grafts, but important heterogeneity between 
claudication and critical ischaemia should be noted. While the optimal choice 
for claudication remains uncertain, heparin coated grafts should be used for 
critical ischaemia.

Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of evolocumab in the FOURIER study: a 
Canadian analysis.

Montréal, Que.

BACKGROUND: Evolocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) 
inhibitor, has been shown to reduce low-density lipoprotein levels by up to 60%. 
Despite the absence of a reduction in overall or cardiovascular mortality in the 
Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With 
Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial, some believe that, with longer treatment, such a 
benefit might eventually be realized. Our aim was to estimate the potential 
mortality benefit over a patient's lifetime and the cost per year of life saved 
(YOLS) for an average Canadian with established coronary artery disease. We also 
sought to estimate the price threshold at which evolocumab might be considered 
cost-effective for secondary prevention in Canada.
METHODS: We calibrated the Cardio-metabolic Model, a well-validated tool for 
predicting cardiovascular events and life expectancy, to the reduction in 
nonfatal events seen in the FOURIER trial. Assuming that long-term treatment 
will eventually result in mortality benefits, we estimated YOLSs and cost per 
YOLS with evolocumab treatment plus a statin compared to a statin alone. We then 
estimated the annual drug costs that would provide a 50% chance of being 
cost-effective at willingness-to-pay values of $50 000 and $100 000.
RESULTS: In secondary prevention in patients similar to those in the FOURIER 
study, evolocumab treatment would save an average of 0.34 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.27-0.41) life-years at a cost of $101 899 (95% CI 
$97 325-$106 473), yielding a cost per YOLS of $299 482. We estimate that to 
have a 50% probability of achieving a cost per YOLS below $50 000 and $100 000 
would require annual drug costs below $1200 and $2300, respectively.
INTERPRETATION: At current pricing, the use of evolocumab for secondary 
prevention is unlikely to be cost-effective in Canada.

OBJECTIVES: Current prognostication guidelines for cardiac arrest (CA) survivors 
predate the use of therapeutic hypothermia (TH). The prognostic value and ideal 
timing of the neurological examination remain unknown in the setting of TH.
DESIGN: Patients (N = 291) admitted between 2007 and 2015 to Columbia University 
intensive care units for TH following CA had neurological examinations performed 
on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 postarrest. Absent pupillary light response (PLR), absent 
corneal reflexes (CRs), and Glasgow coma scores motor (GCS-M) no better than 
extension were considered poor examinations. Poor outcome was recorded as 
cerebral performance category score ≥3 at discharge and 1 year. Predictive 
values of examination maneuvers were calculated for each time point.
MAIN RESULTS: Among the 137 survivors to day 7, sensitivities and negative 
predictive values were low at all time points. The PLR had false positive rates 
(FPRs) of 0% and positive predictive values (PPV) of 100% from day 3 onward. For 
the CR and GCS-M, the FPRs decreased from day 3 to 5 (9% vs 3%; 21% vs 9%), 
while PPVs increased (91% vs 96%; 90% vs 95%). Excluding patients who died due 
to withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) did not significantly affect 
FPRs or PPVs, nor did assessing outcome at 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: A poor neurological examination remains a strong predictor of poor 
outcome, both at hospital discharge and at 1 year, independent of WLST. 
Following TH, the predictive value of the examination is insufficient at day 3 
and should be delayed until at least day 5, with some additional benefit beyond 
day 5.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of two types of total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA) designs: posterior-stabilized (PS) and bicruciate-stabilized 
(BCS) on in vivo kinematics during gait.
METHODS: Continuous X-ray images of the gait were taken using a flat panel 
detector for 23 PS and BCS TKAs. We analyzed the tibiofemoral implant flexion 
angle, anteroposterior (AP) translation, axial rotation, and anterior/posterior 
cam-post contact using image-matching techniques.
RESULTS: Double knee actions were demonstrated for the PS and BCS design (35 and 
61%, respectively, p = 0.08). The tibiofemoral AP positions were significantly 
more posterior at peak extension (- 1.7 ± 2.2 and 1.0 ± 2.5 mm, respectively, 
p < 0.01) and anterior at peak flexion (1.3 ± 2.3 and - 0.8 ± 2.8 mm, 
respectively, p = 0.01) for the PS design than for the BCS design, with a 
significant difference in AP translation (3.0 ± 3.9 mm anterior and 1.7 ± 2.8 mm 
posterior, respectively, p < 0.01). Anterior/posterior tibial post contacts were 
found in 83/4% and 74/30% for the PS and BCS designs, respectively, with a 
significant difference in posterior contact (p = 0.72/0.04, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The knee flexion pattern, tibiofemoral AP translation, axial 
rotation, and cam-post contact during gait varied, depending on the type of 
implant, the PS and BCS designs.
