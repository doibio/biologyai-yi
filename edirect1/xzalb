The baby boomer generation is well into the 50+ age bracket, making it one of 
the largest demographic age cohorts. Whereas this cohort would have previously 
considered retirement, the evidence suggests that it will remain in the 
workforce for a longer period in response to a number of social and economic 
drivers. Mandatory retirement has either been abolished or is under 
consideration. An increased and healthier life expectancy means that people may 
work longer for financial and/or psychological reasons. In addition, a global 
shortage of skilled labor will result in efforts to keep employees in the 
workplace for longer periods. These trends have a number of implications for 
working time. What are the health implications of an aging workforce? How do we 
sustain good work ability into the latter years? What do we know about aging and 
shift work? What actions are required in the workplace to assist aging workers? 
This paper is not a comprehensive review of the literature but serves to 
highlight the complexities in understanding the relationship between shift work 
and aging. We discuss aging and human function and, in particular, the impact of 
aging on the circadian system. In addition, we outline new policy directions in 
this area and raise several suggestions to assist the well-being of aging 
workers.

Equality of what in health? Distinguishing between outcome egalitarianism and 
gain egalitarianism.

When deciding how to weigh benefits to different groups, standard economic 
models assume that people focus on the final distribution of utility, health or 
whatever. Thus, an egalitarian is assumed to be an egalitarian in the outcome 
space. But what about egalitarianism in the gains space, such that people focus 
instead on how equally benefits are distributed? This paper reports on a study 
in which members of the public were asked to rank a number of health programmes 
that differed in the distribution of benefits and final outcomes in ways that 
enabled us to distinguish between different types of egalitarianism. The results 
suggest that outcome egalitarianism dominates, particularly for differences in 
health by social class, but a sizeable minority of respondents appear to be gain 
egalitarians, especially when the health differences are by sex. These results 
have important implications for how we think about outcome-based social welfare 
functions in economics.

Cost-effectiveness of statins in the prevention of coronary heart disease events 
in middle-aged Finnish men.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the long-term cost-effectiveness of atorvastatin 
20 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg and simvastatin 40 mg in primary and secondary 
prevention of CHD in Finland.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of statin therapy on the incidence of 
CHD and the expected total costs of the disease were described using a Markov 
state transition model. Due to the limited amount of evidence concerning 
mortality and morbidity for rosuvastatin, the model was used to transmute the 
efficiency data of all statins (decrease in total cholesterol) into long-term 
endpoints (myocardial infarction, death) using risk functions of the FINRISK and 
4S studies. The study followed a characterized cohort of 55-year-old Finnish men 
with an average 3.3-6.6% baseline risk of dying from cardiovascular disease 
within a 10-year period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for 
atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, compared with simvastatin, measured as cost of 
life years gained (euro/LYG) and cost of quality adjusted life years gained 
(euro/QALY).
RESULTS: The use of rosuvastatin increased the life expectancy by 0.27 years on 
average (LYG) compared with simvastatin, producing additional 0.08 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Compared with simvastatin, the cost of one 
LYG with rosuvastatin was euro10 834 and the cost of one QALY gained was euro36 
548 (discount rate 5% per annum). Corresponding figures for atorvastatin were 
euro31 286/LYG and euro105 599/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: If the decision makers' willingness to pay for a QALY gained is 
around euro40 000 there is a high probability (>50%) that rosuvastatin 
represents a cost-effective form of therapy in the prevention of CHD in 
middle-aged men with an average 3.3-6.6% risk of dying within 10 years from 
cardiovascular disease. However, the true clinical impact of these results needs 
confirmation from on-going clinical trials, as the role of rosuvastatin in 
reducing clinical events is pending, but for simvastatin and atorvastatin 
established.

Ezetimibe for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia: a systematic review and 
economic evaluation.

OBJECTIVES: To review the clinical and cost-effectiveness of ezetimibe as a 
combination therapy or monotherapy for the treatment of primary 
hypercholesterolaemia in the UK.
DATA SOURCES: Twelve electronic databases were searched from inception to June 
2006. Searches were supplemented by hand-searching relevant articles, sponsor 
and other submissions of evidence to the National Institute of Health and 
Clinical Excellence and conference proceedings.
REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis (where appropriate) of the 
clinical efficacy evidence was undertaken following recommended guidelines. A 
Markov model was developed to explore the costs and health outcomes associated 
with ezetimibe treatment.
RESULTS: No published clinical outcome trials (> 12 weeks) were identified. In 
the absence of clinical end-point data from trials, 13 (of which five were 
multi-arm) phase III multi-centre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (of 
varying methodological quality) of short-term duration (12-48 weeks) with 
surrogate end-point data were included. For patients not adequately controlled 
with a statin alone, a meta-analysis of six studies showed that a fixed-dose 
combination of ezetimibe and statin treatment was associated with a 
statistically significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-c) and total cholesterol (Total-c) compared with statin alone (p < 
0.00001). Four studies (not eligible for meta-analysis) that titrated (either 
forced or stepwise) the statin doses to LDL-c targets generally showed that the 
co-administration of ezetimibe and statin was significantly more effective in 
reducing plasma LDL-c concentrations than statin monotherapy (p < 0.05 for all 
studies). For patients where a statin is not considered appropriate, a 
meta-analysis of seven studies demonstrated that ezetimibe monotherapy 
significantly reduced LDL-c levels compared with placebo (p < 0.00001). There 
were no statistically significant differences in LDL-c-lowering effects across 
different subgroups. Ezetimibe therapy (either in combination with a statin or 
monotherapy) appeared to be well tolerated compared to statin monotherapy or 
placebo, respectively. No ezetimibe studies reported data on health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL). There was a wide range in the economic results 
depending on the treatment strategies evaluated. When comparing ezetimibe 
monotherapy with no treatment in individuals with baseline LDL-c values of 
3.0-4.0 mmol/l, the results range from 21,000 pounds to 50,000 pounds per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results for individuals with baseline LDL-c 
values over 5.0 mmol/l are below 30,000 pounds per QALY. When comparing the 
costs and benefits of adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin treatment compared with 
maintaining statin treatment at the current dose, the majority of results are 
above values generally considered to be cost-effective (range 19,000 pounds to 
48,000 pounds per QALY). Based on the evidence available, when comparing the 
costs and benefits associated with adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin treatment 
compared with a switch to a more potent statin, the results are governed by the 
difference in the cost of the treatment regimens compared and results range from 
1500 pounds to 116,000 pounds per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The short-term RCT clinical evidence demonstrated that ezetimibe 
was effective in reducing LDL-c when administered as monotherapy or in 
combination with a statin. However, when used as a monotherapy, ezetimibe is 
less effective than statins in lowering LDL-c. Given the limitations in the 
effectiveness data, there is great uncertainty in the economic results. These 
suggest that ezetimibe could be a cost-effective treatment for individuals with 
high baseline LDL-c values, for patients with diabetes and for individuals with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. Long-term clinical outcome studies 
are needed to allow more precise cost-effectiveness estimates to be calculated.

Interventions for cognitive deficits in adults with brain tumours.

Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.

Increased life expectancy in patients with brain tumours has led to a greater 
risk of cognitive deficits, particularly during disease-free periods. Here, we 
review the empirical studies that have been done to treat or to prevent 
cognitive impairment in patients with brain tumours. Both pharmacological 
interventions and cognitive rehabilitation programmes have been used. Although 
both types of study have reported some successes, these are often difficult to 
interpret owing to limitations in the methods used. Most of the studies reviewed 
did not use a randomised group design to control for possible confounding 
factors such as placebo and practice effects. Investigations of newer, targeted 
therapies have reported delays in cognitive deterioration, but these need to be 
confirmed in future studies. Neuroprotection represents another potentially 
promising, novel approach to prevention of cognitive impairment in this 
vulnerable population of patients. Finally, we describe studies in patients with 
cancers outside the CNS, to highlight further possibilities for the prevention 
and treatment of cognitive deficits.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a serious liver disease. The 
aim of this study was to explore the long-term prognosis of AE patients, the 
burden of this disease in Switzerland and the cost-effectiveness of treatment.
METHODS: Relative survival analysis was undertaken using a national database 
with 329 patient records. 155 representative cases had sufficient details 
regarding treatment costs and patient outcome to estimate the financial 
implications and treatment costs of AE.
RESULTS: For an average 54-year-old patient diagnosed with AE in 1970 the life 
expectancy was estimated to be reduced by 18.2 and 21.3 years for men and women, 
respectively. By 2005 this was reduced to approximately 3.5 and 2.6 years, 
respectively. Patients undergoing radical surgery had a better outcome, whereas 
the older patients had a poorer prognosis than the younger patients. Costs 
amount to approximately Euro108,762 per patient. Assuming the improved life 
expectancy of AE patients is due to modern treatment the cost per 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) saved is approximately Euro6,032.
CONCLUSIONS: Current treatments have substantially improved the prognosis of AE 
patients compared to the 1970s. The cost per DALY saved is low compared to the 
average national annual income. Hence, AE treatment is highly cost-effective in 
Switzerland.

Mitochondrial DNA, base excision repair and neurodegeneration.

Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.

Neurodegeneration is a growing public health concern because of the rapid 
increase in median and maximum life expectancy in the developed world. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction seems to play a critical role in neurodegeneration, 
likely owing to the high energy demand of the central nervous system and its 
sole reliance on oxidative metabolism for energy production. Loss of 
mitochondrial function has been clearly demonstrated in several 
neuropathologies, most notably those associated with age, like Alzheimer's, 
Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. Among the common features observed in 
such conditions is the accumulation of oxidative DNA damage, in particular in 
the mitochondrial DNA, suggesting that mitochondrial DNA instability may play a 
causative role in the development of these diseases. In this review we examine 
the evidence for the accumulation of oxidative DNA damage in mitochondria, and 
its relationship with loss of mitochondrial function and cell death in neural 
tissues. Oxidative DNA damage is repaired mainly by the base excision repair 
pathway. Thus, we review the molecular events and enzymes involved in base 
excision repair in mitochondria, and explore the possible role of alterations in 
mitochondrial base excision repair activities in premature aging and 
age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

Dietary lipoic acid supplementation can mimic or block the effect of dietary 
restriction on life span.

Dietary restriction feeding extends survival in a range of species but a 
detailed understanding of the underlying mechanism is lacking. There is interest 
therefore in identifying a more targeted approach to replicate this effect on 
survival. We report that in rats dietary supplementation with alpha-lipoic acid, 
has markedly differing effects on lifetime survival depending upon the dietary 
history of the animal. When animals are switched from DR feeding to ad libitum 
feeding with a diet supplemented with alpha-lipoic acid, the extended survival 
characteristic of DR feeding is maintained, even though the animals show 
accelerated growth. Conversely, switching from ad libitum feeding a diet 
supplemented with alpha-lipoic acid to DR feeding of the non-supplemented diet, 
blocks the normal effect of DR to extend survival, even after cessation of 
lipoic acid supplementation. Unlike the dynamic effect of switching between DR 
and ad libitum feeding with a non-supplemented diet where the subsequent 
survival trajectory is determined by the new feeding regime, lipoic acid fixes 
the survival trajectory to that established by the initial feeding regime. Ad 
libitum feeding a diet supplemented with lipoic acid can therefore act as 
mimetic of DR to extend survival.

We investigated clinical and cellular phenotypes of 24 children with mutations 
in the catalytic (alpha) subunit of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gamma 
polymerase (POLG1). Twenty-one had Alpers syndrome, the commonest severe POLG1 
autosomal recessive phenotype, comprising hepatoencephalopathy and often mtDNA 
depletion. The cellular mtDNA content reflected the genotype more closely than 
did clinical features. Patients with tissue depletion of mtDNA all had at least 
one allele with either a missense mutation in a catalytic domain or a nonsense 
mutation. Four out of 12 patients exhibited a progressive, mosaic pattern of 
mtDNA depletion in cultured fibroblasts. All these patients had mutations in a 
catalytic domain in both POLG1 alleles, in either the polymerase or exonuclease 
domain or both. The tissue mtDNA content of patients who had two linker 
mutations was normal, and their phenotypes the mildest. Epilepsy and/or movement 
disorder were major features in all 21. Previous studies have implicated 
replication stalling as a mechanism for mtDNA depletion. The mosaic cellular 
depletion that we have demonstrated in cell cultures may be a manifestation of 
severe replication stalling. One patient with a severe cellular and clinical 
phenotype was a compound heterozygote with POLG1 mutations in the polymerase and 
exonuclease domain intrans. This suggests that POLG1 requires both polymerase 
and 3'-5' exonuclease activity in the same molecule. This is consistent with 
current functional models for eukaryotic DNA polymerases, which alternate 
between polymerizing and editing modes, as determined by competition between 
these two active sites for the 3' end of the DNA.

Health state utilities in latent and active tuberculosis.

Guo N(1), Marra CA, Marra F, Moadebi S, Elwood RK, Fitzgerald JM.

(1)Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of British Columbia, 
Vancouver, BC, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health threat worldwide. 
Numerous cost-effectiveness analyses of TB screening and treatment strategies 
have been recently published, but none have utilized quality-adjusted life-years 
as recommended because of the lack of utilities for TB health states.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize and compare utility scores from either active TB or 
latent TB infection (LTBI) participants.
METHODS: Consenting patients attending a population-based screening and 
treatment clinic were administered the Short Form 36 (SF-36), the Health 
Utilities Index 2/3 (HUI2/3), and a general health visual analog scale (VAS) 
along with demographic questions. SF-36 scores were converted to Short Form 6D 
(SF-6D) utility scores using an accepted algorithm. Utility results were 
compared across scales, and construct validity was assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 162 TB patients (78 LTBI and 84 active TB) with available 
SF-36 and all four utility scores (Health Utilities Index 2, Health Utilities 
Index 3, SF-6D and VAS) were included in the analysis. Those with active TB had 
significantly lower SF-36 and utility scores than those with LTBI. Although all 
appeared to exhibit construct validity, the HUI2/3 and the VAS appeared to have 
significant ceiling effects, whereas the SF-6D had significant floor effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Health state utility values for active TB and LTBI have been 
determined using different instruments. The three measures did not generate 
identical utility scores. The HUI2/3 was limited by ceiling effects, whereas the 
SF-6D appeared to display floor effects.

Sociodemographic and clinical correlates of utility scores in Alzheimer's 
disease.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between psychiatric symptoms, cognitive 
performance, functional capacity and quality of life in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), and change in the Health Utilities Index (HUI)-Mark III, a widely used 
generic, multiattribute preference-based health-status classification system.
METHODS: Follow-up data were obtained from caregiver proxy raters at 3, to 6, 
and 9-months postrandom assignment concerning 421 patients with AD, living with 
at least one caregiver in a noninstitutional setting, who participated in the 
Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness-AD of antipsychotic 
medication. Spearman rank correlations, multivariate linear regression, and 
mixed modeling were used to examine the correlates of change in the HUI.
RESULTS: HUI scores decreased by an average of -0.061 over 9 months. Analysis 
revealed weak bivariate, and largely, nonsignificant multivariate relationships 
between change in HUI scores and sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric 
symptoms, and cognitive performance. There were highly significant associations 
between decreases in health utilities and change in the AD Cooperative Study for 
Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL) and AD-Related Quality of Life 
(ADRQoL) (both P < 0.001), even after controlling for other factors. Adjusted 
R(2) values ranged from 0.14 to 0.20.
CONCLUSION: In AD patients requiring antipsychotic treatment, only weak 
relationships were found between changes in the HUI and sociodemographic and 
clinical indicators. While functional capability and quality of life showed more 
significant associations, less than 20% of the variance in health utility could 
be explained. Significant cognitive impairment and the need to rely on proxy 
raters may limit the usefulness of utility measurement in AD patients with 
serious behavioral symptoms.

Estimation of life expectancy and the expected years of life lost in patients 
with major cancers: extrapolation of survival curves under high-censored rates.

Chu PC(1), Wang JD, Hwang JS, Chang YY.

Author information:
(1)Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene, College of Public 
Health, National Taiwan University, Taiwan.

OBJECTIVES: There exists a lack of extrapolation methods for long-term survival 
analysis when censored rates are high (25-50%). This study aimed at estimating 
life expectancy (LE) after the diagnosis of cancer and the expected years of 
life lost (EYLL) using a newly developed semiparametric method.
METHODS: Patients (n = 425,294) diagnosed with 17 different types of major 
cancer were enrolled. All of the patients were registered with the Taiwan Cancer 
Registry between 1990 and 2001; their survivals were followed through the end of 
2004. The survival function for an age- and sex-matched reference population was 
generated using the Monte Carlo method from the life table of the general 
population. Lifetime survival of the cancer patients (up to 50 years) were 
obtained using linear extrapolation of a logit-transformed curve of the survival 
ratio between the cancer and reference populations. The estimates were compared 
with the results from the extrapolation of fitted Weibull models.
RESULTS: The 15-year survival, LE, and EYLL for 17 different types of cancer 
were determined, of which the LE of breast, cervical, ovarian, and skin cancers 
exceeded 15 years; nasopharyneal, leukemia, bladder, kidney, and colorectal 
cancers exceeded 10 years. Validity tests indicated that the relative biases of 
the extrapolated estimates were usually <5% under high censoring rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed method is feasible and relatively accurate to 
project LE and EYLL, which could also be merged with data pertaining to quality 
of life, for a more detailed outcome assessment in the future.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing a universal infant 
7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) vaccination program in the Irish 
health-care setting from the health-care payers' perspective.
METHODS: A model was constructed in MS Excel to follow a cohort of vaccinated 
and unvaccinated individuals from birth over a 5-year period. The reduction in 
events that would be associated with PCV7 vaccination and the mortality and cost 
resulting from these events were analyzed. In a separate submodel, the effect of 
herd immunity was investigated.
RESULTS: Implementing a PCV7 vaccine program in Ireland in a birth cohort of 
61,000 infants would be expected to prevent 7703 cases of pneumococcal-related 
infections over 5 years, resulting in costs avoided of 2.05 million euros 
increasing to 4.6 million euros if the effect of herd immunity was included. The 
baseline incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 249,591 euros/life years 
gained (LYG), which reduced to 5997 euros/LYG when the effect of herd immunity 
was included.
CONCLUSIONS: A universal infant pneumococcal conjugate vaccination could be 
considered highly cost-effective in the Irish health-care setting from a 
health-care payers' perspective, if viewed in terms of the herd immunity effect.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors in patients with non-ST elevation 
acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) pretreated with aspirin and clopidogrel 
undergoing an early invasive treatment strategy.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis were performed 
from a health-care system perspective, based on a Markov model with a time 
horizon of the patient life span. The risk of death and ischemic events was 
assessed using the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score. We 
compared three strategies: 1) routine upstream use of a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor to 
all patients before angiography, 2) deferred selective use of abciximab in the 
catheterization laboratory just before angioplasty, and 3) double antiplatelet 
therapy without GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors. Both univariate sensitivity analysis and 
second-order probabilistic microsimulation were performed.
RESULTS: In the base case (65 years old, TIMI score 3), strategy A was the most 
effective, with an ICER of 15,150 euros per quality-adjusted life-year gained. 
Strategy B was dominated by a combination of strategies A and C. The ICER was 
very sensitive to the age and baseline risk of the patient. According to the 
widely accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds, strategy A would be 
cost-effective only in patients with an intermediate to high TIMI score, 
especially within the younger age groups. The probability that strategy A was 
cost-effective under the base case was 91.2%.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors upstream in high-risk NSTE-ACS 
patients (TIMI score > or = 3) pretreated with aspirin and clopidogrel is 
cost-effective, particularly in the younger age groups.

Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. anabiazevedo@hotmail.com

OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine indirect costs of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) in a sample of patients followed at a public health-care facility 
in Brazil. Factors potentially associated with higher indirect costs in these 
patients were also investigated.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included patients between 18 and 65 years 
old with RA according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria. Patients 
who were working, on sick leave or retired early due to RA were invited to 
participate in the survey. A systematic structured interview was conducted in 
all patients including demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables and an 
experienced rheumatologist examined all patients. Estimates of the indirect 
costs in the preceding 12 months were performed using the human-capital approach 
based on the society perspective. Multiple linear regression models were used to 
determine the variables associated with higher indirect costs.
RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were included in the study. Forty-seven of them 
(24.5%) had retired early due to RA, 62 others (32.3%) were on sick leave due to 
RA while 83 patients (43.2%) were working at the time of the interview. 
Estimated indirect cost for this population was US$ 466,107.81 or US$ 2,423.51 
per patient per year. Factors associated with higher costs were RA poor 
functional class, high socioeconomic status and male patients (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Estimated costs found in our population are similar to that 
described in more developed countries. Indirect costs were higher in patients 
with poor functional classes, high socioeconomic status, and men.

BACKGROUND: In 2002, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 
(NICE), recommended atypical antipsychotics over conventional ones for 
first-line schizophrenia treatment, based on their lower risk of extrapyramidal 
symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of atypical relative 
to conventional antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia in the UK.
METHODS: A discrete event simulation (DES) model was adopted to reflect the 
treatment of schizophrenia in the UK. The model estimates symptoms (using the 
Positive and Negative Symptom Score [PANSS]), psychiatrist visits, 
pharmacological treatment and treatment location, number and duration of 
psychotic relapses, level of compliance, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
and side effects over a 5-year time period. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were carried out. Following NICE's "atypical" recommendation, the 
cost-effectiveness of atypical versus conventional antipsychotics was estimated 
in a scenario analysis, assuming both groups differ only in side-effect profile.
RESULTS: When comparing conventional and atypical antipsychotics, the model 
predicts that the latter would decrease 5-year costs by 1633 Pound per patient 
and result in a QALY gain of 0.101. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
suggests these results are robust. The sensitivity analyses indicate that 
incremental costs and effects are most sensitive to the differential efficacy of 
atypicals and conventionals, as measured by PANSS. When it is assumed that the 
only differences between atypicals and conventionals are found in side-effect 
profiles, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the atypicals is 45,000 
Pound per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: According to this DES model for schizophrenia, atypical 
antipsychotics are cost-effective compared to the conventional antipsychotics. 
The assumptions used in the model need further validation through large 
naturalistic based studies with reasonable follow-up to determine the real-life 
differences between atypicals and conventional antipsychotics.

BACKGROUND: Contacts of patients with active tuberculosis ("TB contacts") with a 
tuberculin skin test (TST) size > or = 5 mm are currently recommended treatment 
for latent TB infection (LTBI). Knowing the cost-effectiveness of LTBI therapy 
for specific TB contact subpopulations may improve the use of limited resources 
by reducing the treatment of persons at low TB risk.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of LTBI therapy for different TB 
contact populations defined by important risk factors, and to propose an optimal 
policy based on different recommendation for each subgroup of contacts.
METHODS: A 6-year Markov decision analytic model simulating the quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs), number of active TB cases prevented, and costs for 
hypothetical cohorts of Canadian TB contacts defined by TST size, age group (< 
10 y/o or above), ethnicity, closeness of contact, and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin 
(BCG) vaccination status.
RESULTS: For the majority of subgroups, the current policy of preventive therapy 
in those with positive TST was the most cost-effective. Nevertheless, our 
analysis determined that LTBI treatment is not cost-effective in nonhousehold 
Canadian-born (nonaboriginal) or foreign-born contacts age > or = 10 y/o. On the 
other hand, empirical treatment without screening of all non-BCG-vaccinated 
household contacts age < 10 y/o appeared cost-effective. Such an optimal 
approach would result in an incremental net monetary benefit of $25 for each 
contact investigated for a willingness-to-pay of $50,000/QALY. Results were 
robust to several alternative assumptions considered in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The current practice of LTBI treatment for TB contacts with a TST 
size > or = 5 mm is cost-effective. A customized approach based on excluding low 
risk groups from screening and providing treatment to high risk contacts without 
screening could improve the performance of the program.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of atomoxetine for children with 
attention-deficity/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the United Kingdom compared 
with current alternatives.
METHODS: An economic model with Markov processes was developed to estimate the 
costs and benefits of atomoxetine versus other current ADHD treatment options. 
The model evaluated atomoxetine in five patient subgroups according to treatment 
history and the existence of comorbidities precluding stimulant medication. The 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was calculated for 
atomoxetine treatment algorithms compared with comparator algorithms. The Markov 
process incorporated 18 health states, representing a range of outcomes across 
all treatment options included in the algorithms. Utility values were derived 
from a survey of 83 parents of children with ADHD. The effectiveness and safety 
aspects of the treatment options were based on a thorough review of controlled 
clinical trials and other clinical literature, and validated by international 
experts. Costs and outcomes were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation over a 
1-year duration, with costs estimated from the perspective of the National 
Health Service in England and Wales.
RESULTS: For stimulant-naive patients, the incremental cost per QALY gained for 
the atomoxetine algorithm compared with immediate-release methylphenidate 
hydrochloride (MPH) was pound 15,224 ( pound 13,241 compared with 
extended-release MPH). In the stimulant-exposed populations, the incremental 
cost per QALY for the atomoxetine algorithm was between pound 14,169 and pound 
15,878. For patients contraindicated for stimulant therapies, the incremental 
cost per QALY was pound 11,523 and pound 12,370 for stimulant-naive and 
stimulant-exposed populations, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The economic evaluation showed atomoxetine is an effective 
alternative across a range of ADHD populations and offers value-for-money in the 
treatment of ADHD.

The impact of body weight on patient utilities with or without type 2 diabetes: 
a review of the medical literature.

BACKGROUND: Weight gain is a common side effect of many therapies for type 2 
diabetes (T2DM). Selecting utility values for incorporation into cost-utility 
analyses (CUAs) of T2DM therapies is difficult because of variations in 
methodologies to elicit utilities and other study limitations.
METHODS: A review of the medical literature was conducted to identify studies 
assessing the impact of body weight on patient utility.
RESULTS: Eighteen articles presented either: 1) utility values by body-mass 
index (BMI) or body weight, or 2) the change in utility scores or 
quality-adjusted life-years based on unit changes in BMI or body weight. 
Regardless of the study population or methodology used to elicit utility scores, 
all studies reviewed found that as body weight increased, patient utility 
decreased. Utility scores obtained using standard gamble were generally higher 
than those using time trade-off(TTO) or the EQ-5D. Most studies reported utility 
scores stratified by BMI and used regression analyses to attribute the 
difference in utility scores to differences in weight while controlling for 
other factors. Studies generally assumed a constant change in utility occurs 
with a one unit change in BMI. Recent studies, however, demonstrate the 
magnitude of changes in utility may vary depending on 1) valuing weight loss 
versus weight gain; 2) valuing a small or large change in body weight; and 3) 
baseline BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Various utility values associated with body weight using different 
methodologies have been published. Careful consideration should be given to 
determine the most appropriate utility values to use in CUAs of T2DM therapies.

Incorporating model uncertainty in cost-effectiveness analysis: a Bayesian model 
averaging approach.

Recently, several authors have proposed the use of linear regression models in 
cost-effectiveness analysis. In this paper, by modelling costs and outcomes 
using patient and Health Centre covariates, we seek to identify the part of the 
cost or outcome difference that is not attributable to the treatment itself, but 
to the patients' condition or to characteristics of the Centres. Selection of 
the covariates to be included as predictors of effectiveness and cost is usually 
assumed by the researcher. This behaviour ignores the uncertainty associated 
with model selection and leads to underestimation of the uncertainty about 
quantities of interest. We propose the use of Bayesian model averaging as a 
mechanism to account for such uncertainty about the model. Data from a clinical 
trial are used to analyze the effect of incorporating model uncertainty, by 
comparing two highly active antiretroviral treatments applied to asymptomatic 
HIV patients. The joint posterior density of incremental effectiveness and cost 
and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves are proposed as decision-making 
measures.

Traumatic brain injury during development reduces minimal clonic seizure 
thresholds at maturity.

Post-traumatic seizures affect 12-35% of children after traumatic brain injury 
(TBI) and are associated with worse cognitive and functional outcome, even after 
adjustment for severity of injury. Unfortunately, experimental models of 
pediatric post-traumatic epilepsy are lacking, and pathogenesis remains poorly 
understood. We have applied a standard model of TBI in immature rats to 
determine the effect of TBI on electroconvulsive seizure thresholds later in 
life. Male rats underwent controlled cortical impact to left parietal cortex on 
post-natal day (PND) 16-18. Hindbrain, forebrain, and limbic seizure thresholds 
were assessed, respectively, by tonic hindlimb extension (THE), minimal clonic, 
and partial psychomotor seizure responses during adolescence (PND 34-40) and at 
maturity (PND 60-63). Post-traumatic seizure thresholds were compared to those 
obtained in age- and litter-matched sham craniotomy and naïve controls. TBI 
during immaturity had no clear effect on THE seizure thresholds. In contrast, 
TBI lowered minimal clonic seizure thresholds at maturity (p<0.05 vs. sham or 
naïve rats), but not during adolescence. Consequently, minimal clonic seizure 
thresholds increased with age for sham and naïve rats but remained similar for 
TBI rats during adolescence and at maturity. TBI also tended to lower partial 
psychomotor seizure thresholds, which were determined only during adolescence 
(p<0.1 vs. naïve). Controlled cortical impact causes both focal cortical injury 
at the site of impact and ipsilateral hippocampal neuronal death. Since minimal 
clonic seizures are mediated by the forebrain, partial psychomotor seizures by 
the limbic system, and THE seizures by the brainstem, the observed pattern of 
changes in post-traumatic seizure thresholds is not surprising. The apparent 
age-dependent effects of TBI, however, are unexpected and likely due to a 
combination of attenuated maturational increases and progressive 
epileptogenesis. Additional study is needed to delineate the relative 
contributions of these processes. Given the sustained reduction in 
post-traumatic minimal clonic seizure thresholds, controlled cortical impact may 
hold promise as an experimental model of pediatric post-traumatic epilepsy.

Improvement in the assessment of wear of total knee replacements using 
coordinate-measuring machine techniques.

University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield, UK.

Total joint replacement is one of the most common elective surgical procedures 
performed worldwide, with an estimate of 1.5x 10(6) operations performed 
annually. Currently joint replacements are expected to function for 10-15 years; 
however, with an increase in life expectancy, and a greater call for knee 
replacement due to increased activity levels, there is a requirement to improve 
their function to offer longer-term improved quality of life for patients. Wear 
analysis of total joint replacements has long been an important means in 
determining failure mechanisms and improving longevity of these devices. The 
effectiveness of the coordinate-measuring machine (CMM) technique for assessing 
volumetric material loss during simulated life testing of a replacement knee 
joint has been proved previously by the present authors. The purpose of the 
current work is to present an improvement to this method for situations where no 
pre-wear data are available. To validate the method, simulator tests were run 
and gravimetric measurements taken throughout the test, such that the components 
measured had a known wear value. The implications of the results are then 
discussed in terms of assessment of joint functionality and development of 
standardized CMM-based product standards. The method was then expanded to allow 
assessment of clinically retrieved bearings so as to ascertain a measure of true 
clinical wear.

Perceptions of quality-of-life effects of treatments for diabetes mellitus in 
vulnerable and nonvulnerable older patients.

Pennsylvania, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To assess whether patient perceptions of treatments for diabetes 
mellitus differ according to clinical criteria such as limited life expectancy 
and functional decline (i.e., vulnerability).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
SETTING: Clinics affiliated with two Chicago-area hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 and older living with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(N=332).
MEASUREMENTS: Utilities (quantitative measures of preference on a scale from 0 
to 1, with 0 representing a state equivalent to death and 1 representing life in 
perfect health) were assessed for nine hypothetical treatment states using time 
trade-off questions, and patients were queried about specific concerns regarding 
medications. Vulnerability was defined according to the Vulnerable Elders Scale.
RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of patients were vulnerable. Vulnerable patients 
were older (77 vs 73) and had diabetes mellitus longer (13 vs 10 years; P<.05). 
Vulnerable patients reported lower utilities than nonvulnerable patients for 
most individual treatment states (e.g., intensive glucose control, mean 0.61 vs 
0.72, P<.01), but within group variation was large for both groups (e.g., 
standard deviations >0.25). Although mean individual state utilities differed 
across groups, no significant differences were found in how vulnerable and 
nonvulnerable patients compared intensive and conventional treatment states 
(e.g., intensive vs conventional glucose control). In multivariable analyses, 
the association between vulnerability and individual treatment state utilities 
became nonsignificant except for the cholesterol pill.
CONCLUSION: Older patients' preferences for intensity of treatment for diabetes 
mellitus vary widely and are not closely associated with vulnerability. This 
observation underscores the importance of involving older patients in decisions 
about treatment for diabetes mellitus, irrespective of clinical status.

OBJECTIVES: This prospective multicentre study provides clinical experience up 
to 3 years to support a simplified treatment for mandibular edentulism within 1 
week by using one-stage implant surgery and a screw-retained full-arch bridge.
METHODS: Two hundred and fifty ITI Monotype implants were installed in 62 
patients out of 66 patients; 60 patients got four implants each and two got five 
implants. After 1 week, a final bridge was in function. Radiographs were taken 
as baseline for vertical bone loss up to 3 years post-loading for the whole 
cluster and specific effects of gender, centre, age, bone class, implant length 
over time were compiled. Clinical (mPI, SBI) and subjective parameters such as 
general oral hygiene and patient satisfaction were recorded and repeated at 
specified intervals up to 3 years.
RESULTS: Four patients were excluded at surgery and are not involved in the 
follow-ups. At 1 year, 61 patients (244 implants) were evaluable and all bridges 
were in function. After 3 years, 49 patients (194 implants) came to control. 
Eight patients died during the follow-up period. Three patients lost one implant 
each. The cumulative implant survival rate was 98.55% and the success rate for 
the prosthesis was 100%. As calculated from measurable radiographs, the mean 
bone level at baseline was 1.63+/-0.78 and at 1 and 3 years 2.50+/-0.60 and 
2.56+/-0.74, respectively. Using the mixed model analysis and Friedman test, the 
time in situ, centre and bone class had significant effect on the bone 
resorption and to some small extent even, the implant length. Gender and age 
were unaffected. Oral hygiene and patient satisfaction of the treatment were 
improved.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that one-part self-tapping sandblasted, 
large-grit, acid-etched (SLA) implants are suitable for loading within 1 week. 
In the whole period, the mean bone crestal resorption was <1 mm, which is in 
agreement with other similar studies.
