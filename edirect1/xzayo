palliative end-of-life care can take place in hospital, but is also safe in the 
home setting. Suffering in patients with JEB-H can become so unbearable that in 
some patients who do not respond to adequate analgesic and sedative treatment, 
newborn euthanasia, performed according to the Groningen protocol, is legally 
permitted in the Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Maintenance treatment of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) without disease progression after first-line chemotherapy is a 
subject of ongoing research. The aim of the randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, INFORM study was to investigate the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of the EGFR-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the maintenance 
setting.
METHODS: Patients were aged 18 years or older, were of east Asian ethnic origin, 
had a life expectancy of more than 12 weeks, histologically or cytologically 
confirmed stage IIIb or IV NSCLC, a WHO performance status of 0-2, and had 
completed four cycles of first-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy without 
disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. Between Sept 28, 2008 and Aug 
11, 2009, 296 patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either gefitinib 
(250 mg per day orally) or placebo (orally) within 3-6 weeks after chemotherapy 
until progression or unacceptable toxic effects. Randomisation was done via an 
interactive web response system with computer-generated randomisation codes. Our 
primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed in the 
intention-to-treat population. This completed study is registered with 
Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT00770588.
FINDINGS: Progression-free survival was significantly longer with gefitinib 
(n=148) than with placebo (148) (median progression-free survival 4·8 months 
[95% CI 3·2-8·5] vs 2·6 months [1·6-2·8]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·42, 95% CI 
0·33-0·55; p<0·0001). Adverse events occurred more frequently with gefitinib 
than with placebo; the most common adverse events of any grade were rash (73 
[50%] of 147 in the gefitinib group vs 14 [9%] of 148 in the placebo group), 
diarrhoea (37 [25%] vs 13 [9%]), and alanine aminotransferase increase (31 [21%] 
vs 12 [8%]). The most commonly reported grade 3 or 4 adverse event was alanine 
aminotransferase increase (3 [2%] of 147 in the gefitinib group, none of 148 in 
the placebo group). Ten of 147 (7%) patients given gefitinib and five of 148 
(3%) patients given placebo had serious adverse events. Three deaths were 
thought to be related to treatment with gefitinib: one from interstitial lung 
disease; one from lung infection; and one from pneumonia.
INTERPRETATION: Maintenance treatment with gefitinib significantly prolonged 
progression-free survival compared with placebo in patients from east Asia with 
advanced NSCLC who achieved disease control after first-line chemotherapy. 
Clinicians should consider these data when making decisions about maintenance 
treatment in such patients.

Hierarchical cluster analysis of labour market regulations and population 
health: a taxonomy of low- and middle-income countries.

BACKGROUND: An important contribution of the social determinants of health 
perspective has been to inquire about non-medical determinants of population 
health. Among these, labour market regulations are of vital significance. In 
this study, we investigate the labour market regulations among low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs) and propose a labour market taxonomy to further 
understand population health in a global context.
METHODS: Using Gross National Product per capita, we classify 113 countries into 
either low-income (n = 71) or middle-income (n = 42) strata. Principal component 
analysis of three standardized indicators of labour market inequality and 
poverty is used to construct 2 factor scores. Factor score reliability is 
evaluated with Cronbach's alpha. Using these scores, we conduct a hierarchical 
cluster analysis to produce a labour market taxonomy, conduct zero-order 
correlations, and create box plots to test their associations with adult 
mortality, healthy life expectancy, infant mortality, maternal mortality, 
neonatal mortality, under-5 mortality, and years of life lost to communicable 
and non-communicable diseases. Labour market and health data are retrieved from 
the International Labour Organization's Key Indicators of Labour Markets and 
World Health Organization's Statistical Information System.
RESULTS: Six labour market clusters emerged: Residual (n = 16), Emerging (n = 
16), Informal (n = 10), Post-Communist (n = 18), Less Successful Informal (n = 
22), and Insecure (n = 31). Primary findings indicate: (i) labour market poverty 
and population health is correlated in both LMICs; (ii) association between 
labour market inequality and health indicators is significant only in low-income 
countries; (iii) Emerging (e.g., East Asian and Eastern European countries) and 
Insecure (e.g., sub-Saharan African nations) clusters are the most advantaged 
and disadvantaged, respectively, with the remaining clusters experiencing levels 
of population health consistent with their labour market characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: The labour market regulations of LMICs appear to be important 
social determinant of population health. This study demonstrates the heuristic 
value of understanding the labour markets of LMICs and their health effects 
using exploratory taxonomy approaches.

Primary domestication and early uses of the emblematic olive tree: 
palaeobotanical, historical and molecular evidence from the Middle East.

Our knowledge of the origins of olive tree domestication in the Middle East and 
on the processes governing its extension and persistence in different vegetation 
types from prehistory through antiquity to modern times derives from diverse 
sources, spanning the biological sciences to the humanities. Nonetheless, it 
lacks a robust overview that may lead to floating interpretations. This is 
especially true in the Middle East, considered as the cradle of agriculture, and 
where the evolutionary history of this emblematic tree is intertwined with that 
of civilizations. Olive fruit, oil and wood have been, since Prehistoric times, 
characteristic products of the lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea. In the 
domestic economy of these countries, the olive tree gradually became a 
traditional tree crop since the first oil extraction, through the emergence of 
regional commerce that accompanied the rise and fall of early Near-Middle 
Eastern urbanism, until the development of modern trade, with an oil production 
estimated at circa 3000000 tons per year. The rising importance of the olive 
tree in human life has turned the tree into an endless source of fascination in 
the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean, a symbol and a sacred tree, widely cited 
in the Bibles, the Koran, and in ancient literature. Here we argue that advances 
in radiocarbon chronology, palaeobotany, genetics, and archaeology-history have 
profoundly refined the history of olive trees in the Middle East. This review 
shows that the heartland of primary olive domestication must be enlarged to the 
Levant and not only focus on the Jordan Valley. The domestication of the olive 
tree is a long and ongoing process, linked to the early production of oil and 
the development of the olive trade. We also suggest that the olive tree became a 
particular icon, a sacred tree, during the Biblical period in the Levant.

Do Indigenous Australians age prematurely? The implications of life expectancy 
and health conditions of older Indigenous people for health and aged care 
policy.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether Indigenous Australians age prematurely compared 
with other Australians, as implied by Australian Government aged care policy, 
which uses age 50 years and over for population-based planning for Indigenous 
people compared with 70 years for non-indigenous people.
METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of aged care assessment, hospital and health 
survey data comparing Indigenous and non-indigenous age-specific prevalence of 
health conditions. Analysis of life tables for Indigenous and non-indigenous 
populations comparing life expectancy at different ages.
RESULTS: At age 63 for women and age 65 for men, Indigenous people had the same 
life expectancy as non-indigenous people at age 70. There is no consistent 
pattern of a 20-year lead in age-specific prevalence of age-associated 
conditions for Indigenous compared with other Australians. There is high 
prevalence from middle-age onwards of some conditions, particularly diabetes 
(type unspecified), but there is little or no lead for others.
CONCLUSION: The idea that Indigenous people age prematurely is not well 
supported by this study of a series of discrete conditions. The current focus 
and type of services provided by the aged care sector may not be the best way to 
respond to the excessive burden of chronic disease and disability of middle-aged 
Indigenous people.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011;(12):CD006282.

BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by degeneration of anterior 
horn cells, which leads to progressive muscle weakness. Children with SMA type 
II do not develop the ability to walk without support and have a shortened life 
expectancy, whereas children with SMA type III develop the ability to walk and 
have a normal life expectancy. There are no known efficacious drug treatments 
that influence the disease course of SMA. This is an update of a review first 
published in 2009.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether drug treatment is able to slow or arrest the 
disease progression of SMA types II and III and to assess if such therapy can be 
given safely. Drug treatment for SMA type I is the topic of a separate updated 
Cochrane review.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized 
Register (8 March 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1991 to 
February 2011), EMBASE (January 1991 to February 2011) and ISI Web of Knowledge 
(January 1991 to March 8 2011). We also searched clinicaltrials.gov to identify 
as yet unpublished trials (8 March 2011).
SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought all randomised or quasi-randomised trials that 
examined the efficacy of drug treatment for SMA types II and III. Participants 
had to fulfil the clinical criteria and have a deletion or mutation of the 
survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene (5q11.2-13.2) that was confirmed by genetic 
analysis.The primary outcome measure was to be change in disability score within 
one year after the onset of treatment. Secondary outcome measures within one 
year after the onset of treatment were to be change in muscle strength, ability 
to stand or walk, change in quality of life, time from the start of treatment 
until death or full time ventilation and adverse events attributable to 
treatment during the trial period.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently reviewed and extracted 
data from all potentially relevant trials. Pooled relative risks and pooled 
standardised mean differences were to be calculated to assess treatment 
efficacy. Risk of bias was systematically analysed.
MAIN RESULTS: Six randomised placebo-controlled trials on treatment for SMA 
types II and III were found and included in the review: the four in the original 
review and two trials added in this update. The treatments were creatine (55 
participants), phenylbutyrate (107 participants), gabapentin (84 participants), 
thyrotropin releasing hormone (9 participants), hydroxyurea (57 participants), 
and combination therapy with valproate and acetyl-L-carnitine (61 participants). 
None of these studies were completely free of bias. All studies had adequate 
blinding, sequence generation and reports of primary outcomes.None of the 
included trials showed any statistically significant effects on the outcome 
measures in participants with SMA types II and III. One participant died due to 
suffocation in the hydroxyurea trial and one participant died in the creatine 
trial. No participants in any of the other four trials died or reached the state 
of full time ventilation. Serious side effects were infrequent.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no proven efficacious drug treatment for SMA 
types II and III.

Can ageing be slowed?: Hormetic and redox perspectives.

Romania.

Redox metabolism has long been considered to play important roles in aging and 
the development of age-related diseases. Both dietary and pharmacological 
manipulations of redox metabolism have been associated with the extension of 
lifespan. Increasing new evidence s also suggests that the process of aging may 
derive from imperfect clearance of oxidatively damaged material. The 
accumulation of this molecular "garbage", relatively indigestible, further 
hinders cellular functions, induces progressive failure of maintenance and 
repair and increases the probability of death. One important trend in anti-aging 
strategy is, therefore, to prevent or even revert the accumulation of these 
oxidatively altered molecules by stimulating the maintenance and repair systems 
through hormesis. A promising approach for slowing down ageing and achieving a 
healthy senescence is represented by repeated exposure to various mild stresses 
(caloric restriction, moderate exercise, nutritional or pharmacological 
hormetins). This article reviews the potential therapeutic tools available to 
date for increasing longevity and obtaining and successful ageing from the redox 
and hormetic perspective.

The goal of the research was to determine the phytotoxicity (using Lepidium 
sativum) of two activated carbon/biochar-amended sewage sludges. Apart from the 
impact of the AC/biochar dose, the influence of biochar particle diameter (<300, 
300-500 and >500 μm) and the influence of the contact time (7, 60, 90 days) 
between AC/biochar and sewage sludges on their phytotoxicity was also assessed. 
No negative impact of sewage sludges on seed germination was observed (P>0.05). 
The application of AC or biochar to the sludges positively affected root growth 
by reducing the harmful effect by 7.8 to 42% depending on the material used. 
Furthermore, the reduction range clearly depended on the type of sewage sludge. 
No differences were observed in the inhibition of the toxic effect between both 
biochar types used and the biochar particle size. The extension of the contact 
time between AC/biochar and sewage sludges had a negative impact on root growth.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate our experience with the endovascular treatment of total 
occlusions of the mesenteric and celiac arteries.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of endovascular stenting of 27 
nonembolic total occlusions of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and celiac 
artery (CA) between July 2004 and July 2011 (26 patients, 16 females; mean age, 
62 ± 13 years). A variety of demographic, lesion-related and procedure-related 
variables were evaluated for potential impact of technical success and patency. 
The follow-up protocol included clinical assessment, and color and spectral 
Doppler evaluation of the stented vessel(s).
RESULTS: The clinical presentation was chronic mesenteric ischemia in 12 
patients, acute mesenteric vascular syndromes in 10 patients, foregut 
ischemia/ischemic pancreatitis in three patients, and prior to endovascular 
repair of aortic aneurysm in one patient. The treated vessel was SMA in 22 
procedures, CA in three, and both SMA and CA in one. Technical success was 
achieved in 23 of the 27 attempted recanalizations (85%). Three patients who 
failed the attempt underwent open bypass, and another one underwent retrograde 
recanalization and stenting of the SMA. Procedure success was only significantly 
related to patient age <70 years or procedure performance after the year 2006. 
Notably, the presence of a stump, ostial plaque, extensive vascular 
calcification, recanalization route (intraluminal vs subintimal), occlusion 
length, and vessel diameter had no significant impact on procedure success. 
Traditional duplex criteria proved unreliable in predicting restenosis. Life 
table analysis of freedom from symptom recurrence showed a primary and assisted 
rates of 58% and 80% at 1 year, and 33% and 60% at 2 years, respectively. 
Clinical recurrences developed in six patients (four presented with abdominal 
angina and weight loss, two presented with abdominal catastrophe). There were 
six access-related complications and no procedural deaths. Four delayed deaths 
occurred during follow-up (two cardiac causes, two due to abdominal sepsis).
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular recanalization of mesenteric artery occlusion is both 
feasible and successful, provided careful planning is used.

BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines recommend against routine prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) screening for older men and for those with lower life 
expectancies. The authors of this report examined providers' decision-making 
regarding discontinuing PSA screening.
METHODS: A survey of primary providers from a large, university-affiliated 
primary care practice was administered. Providers were asked about their current 
screening practices, factors that influenced their decision to discontinue 
screening, and barriers to discontinuing screening. Bivariate and multivariable 
logistic regression analyses were used to examine whether taking age and/or life 
expectancy into account and barriers to discontinuing were associated with 
clinician characteristics and practice styles.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five of 141 providers (88.7%) participated in the 
survey. Over half (59.3%) took both age and life expectancy into account, 
whereas 12.2% did not consider either in their decisions to discontinue PSA 
screening. Providers varied in the age at which they typically stopped screening 
patients, and the majority (66.4%) reported difficulty in assessing life 
expectancy. Taking patient age and life expectancy into account was not 
associated with provider characteristics or practice styles. The most frequently 
cited barriers to discontinuing PSA screening were patient expectation (74.4%) 
and time constraints (66.4%). Black providers were significantly less likely 
than nonblack providers to endorse barriers related to time constraints and 
clinical uncertainty, although these results were limited by the small sample 
size of black providers.
CONCLUSIONS: Although age and life expectancy often figured prominently in 
decisions to use screening, providers faced multiple barriers to discontinuing 
routine PSA screening.

School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease 
with a chronic disease course. The increase in life expectancy of humans 
worldwide is expected to increase the prevalence and duration of PD; therefore, 
it is important to determine factors that contribute to the caregiver burden for 
both clinical and social reasons.
METHODS: We surveyed 91 main caregivers of patients, and compared factors 
contributing to caregiver burden between 50 spouses and 41 offspring of 
patients. We determined Burden Interview, Depression Scale, Health-Related 
Quality of Life, and Obligation Scale scores, as well as the degree of 
functional social support of caregivers.
RESULTS: Interestingly, the burden scores of the two groups were not 
significantly different. Correlation analysis revealed that depression, 
health-related quality of life, social support, subdivided parts of the Unified 
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn and Yahr Scale, score of 
Mini-Mental State Examination, and Barthel index were correlated with burden in 
both spouses and offspring. However, in multiple regression, depression score 
and part 1 of the UPDRS were more significant predictors of burden in the 
spousal group, whereas social support of community and part 3 of the UPDRS were 
more important correlated factors in the offspring group.
CONCLUSIONS: The caregiver burden of spousal and offspring caregivers of PD 
patients was not significantly different. However, different factors contributed 
to caregiver burden according to the caregiver's relationship with the patient.

Alzheimer disease: new concepts on its neurobiology and the clinical role 
imaging will play.

USA. Jack.Clifford@mayo.edu

Alzheimer disease (AD) is one of, if not the most, feared diseases associated 
with aging. The prevalence of AD increases exponentially with age after 60 
years. Increasing life expectancy coupled with the absence of any approved 
disease-modifying therapies at present position AD as a dominant public health 
problem. Major advances have occurred in the development of disease biomarkers 
for AD in the past 2 decades. At present, the most well-developed AD biomarkers 
are the cerebrospinal fluid analytes amyloid-β 42 and tau and the brain imaging 
measures amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and 
magnetic resonance imaging. CSF and imaging biomarkers are incorporated into 
revised diagnostic guidelines for AD, which have recently been updated for the 
first time since their original formulation in 1984. Results of recent studies 
suggest the possibility of an ordered evolution of AD biomarker abnormalities 
that can be used to stage the typical 20-30-year course of the disease. When 
compared with biomarkers in other areas of medicine, however, the absence of 
standardized quantitative metrics for AD imaging biomarkers constitutes a major 
deficiency. Failure to move toward a standardized system of quantitative metrics 
has substantially limited potential diagnostic usefulness of imaging in AD. This 
presents an important opportunity that, if widely embraced, could greatly expand 
the application of imaging to improve clinical diagnosis and the quality and 
efficiency of clinical trials.

On the correspondence between CAL and lagged cohort life expectancy.

Guillot M(1), Kim HS.

(1)Population Studies Center, University of Pennsylvania, 3718 Locust Walk, 
Philadelphia PA 19104, USA.

It has been established that under certain mortality assumptions, the current 
value of the Cross-sectional Average length of Life (CAL) is equal to the life 
expectancy for the cohort currently reaching its life expectancy. This 
correspondence is important, because the life expectancy for the cohort 
currently reaching its life expectancy, or lagged cohort life expectancy (LCLE), 
has been discussed in the tempo literature as a summary mortality measure of 
substantive interest. In this paper, we build on previous work by evaluating the 
extent to which the correspondence holds in actual populations. We also discuss 
the implications of the CAL-LCLE correspondence (or lack thereof) for using CAL 
as a measure of cohort life expectancy, and for understanding the connection 
between CAL, LCLE, and underlying period mortality conditions.

Acromegaly and gigantism are due to excess GH production, usually as a result of 
a pituitary adenoma. The incidence of acromegaly is 5 cases per million per year 
and the prevalence is 60 cases per million. Clinical manifestations in each 
patient depend on the levels of GH and IGF-I, age, tumor size, and the delay in 
diagnosis. Manifestations of acromegaly are varied and include acral and soft 
tissue overgrowth, joint pain, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and heart and 
respiratory failure. Acromegaly is a disabling disease that is associated with 
increased morbidity and reduced life expectancy. The diagnosis is based 
primarily on clinical features and confirmed by measuring GH levels after oral 
glucose loading and the estimation of IGF-I. It has been suggested that the rate 
of mortality in patients with acromegaly is correlated with the degree of 
control of GH. Adequately treated, the relative mortality risk can be markedly 
reduced towards normal.

Air pollution shortens life expectancy and health expectancy for older adults: 
the case of China.

Wen M(1), Gu D.

BACKGROUND: Outdoor air pollution is one of the most worrying environmental 
threats China faces today. Comprehensive and quantitative analyses of the health 
consequences of air pollution in China are lacking. This study reports age- and 
sex-specific life expectancy and health expectancies (HEs) corresponding to 
different levels of air pollution based on associations between air pollution 
and individual risks for a host of health conditions and mortality net of 
individual- and community-level confounders.
METHODS: This is a multilevel prospective cohort study based a nationally 
representative sample of Chinese elders. The main outcome measures in this study 
include life expectancy estimated from mortality and HEs based on five health 
conditions including activity of daily living, instrumental activity of daily 
living, cognitive status, self-rated health, and chronic conditions.
RESULTS: Net of the controls, exposure to outdoor air pollution corresponded to 
subsequent reductions of life expectancy and HEs for all five health conditions. 
These detrimental pollution effects were stronger for women. The gap in life 
expectancy between areas with good air quality and moderately heavily polluted 
areas was 3.78 years for women of age 65 and 0.93 years for men. The differences 
in HEs at age 65 were also large, ranging from 1.47 years for HE for good 
self-rated health in men to 5.20 years for activity of daily living 
disability-free HE in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Air pollution has devastating health impacts on Chinese elders 
reducing longevity and shortening HEs. Women are more vulnerable than men. More 
strict air policy should be implemented to pursue sustainable development in 
China.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas is a relatively 
rare clinical entity with a main characteristic being mucus production. 
Extension of IPMN along pancretic ducts and mucus production lead to ductal 
obstruction and dilatation, resulting in recurrent episodes of acute 
pancreatitis. Molecular background of IPMN-a comprises several aberrations, with 
the K-ras gene mutation being the likely trigger that initiates further genetic 
changes. Due to its indolent nature, IPMN is most commonly diagnosed in the 7th 
decade of life. Depending on the histology type, IPMN has a malignant potential. 
Therefore, surgical therapy remains a "gold standard" of treatment. Insidious, 
slow progression of the disease and absence of symptoms in a certain number of 
patients makes diagnostic approach to this entity difficult. In this paper we 
present a patient with IPMN of the pancreas, in whom the episodes of acute 
pancreatitis had been present for 22 years.

Taking into account current developments in medicine and the increasingly 
extended lifespan of our patients, the role of transplantation and the related 
issues have become increasingly more urgent and have demanded more attention in 
recent years. Transplantation is a branch of medical studies which has been 
developed as a result of the need to find answers to unsuccessful organ 
transplants. Transplants are the future of the contemporary medicine and provide 
better prospects for patients with defective organs. In spite of the rapid 
development and huge successes achieved in the field of transplantation, the 
major problem we are facing, both in terms of the legal and ethical aspects, is 
the lack of the organ donors. Developing social awareness and continuous 
education can bring about positive changes to the current shortage of donors. 
The role of the church and the media in promoting the importance of organ 
donation will also greatly contribute to the future success of transplantation 
thus saving human lives.

Genetic sequence data identifies the cercaria of Drepanocephalus spathans 
(Digenea: Echinostomatidae), a parasite of the double-crested cormorant 
(Phalacrocorax auritus), with notes on its pathology in juvenile channel catfish 
(Ictalurus punctatus).

An unidentified xiphidio-type cercaria, previously thought inconsequential to 
catfish health, was found to be released from marsh rams-horn snails 
(Planorbella trivolvis) inhabiting ponds on a commercial catfish operation in 
the Mississippi Delta. A preliminary challenge of cohabiting channel catfish ( 
Ictalurus punctatus ) with snails actively shedding the unidentified cercariae 
resulted in death of some fish. A second cohabitation trial yielded similar 
results, as did a third challenge of 250 cercariae/fish. Histopathology revealed 
developing metacercariae concentrated in the cranial region, especially within 
the branchial chamber, with several metacercariae at the base of the branchial 
arches within, or adjacent to, blood vessels, possibly the proximate cause of 
death. Genetic sequence analysis of the 18S small subunit ribosomal DNA (ssDNA), 
28S large subunit rDNA (lsDNA), and cytochrome oxidase (Cox1) genes all matched 
the cercariae to Drepanocephalus spathans (Digenea: Echinostomatidae), a 
parasite of the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), a piscivorous 
bird endemic on most catfish farms. This is the first commentary regarding 
pathology of D. spathans in juvenile channel catfish as well as the first report 
of the marsh rams-horn snail as an intermediate host in the D. spathans life 
cycle. The data presented here suggest this parasite could have limiting effects 
on catfish production, further supporting the need for adequate snail control 
programs to reduce trematode prevalence on commercial catfish operations.

The aim of this study was to test whether maternal smoking-specific 
communication and parental smoking related to smoking cognitions (i.e. attitude, 
self-efficacy and social norm) derived from the Theory of Planned Behaviour in 
association with smoking onset during preadolescence. A total of 1478 pairs of 
mothers and children participated (mean age: 10.11; standard deviation = 0.78). 
Structural equation models in Mplus were used to examine whether 
smoking-specific communication influences children's smoking cognitions, which 
in turn, affect smoking onset. A positive association was found between 
pro-smoking attitudes and smoking onset. Smoking-specific communication and 
parental smoking were related to smoking cognitions. Specifically, frequency of 
communication was negatively associated with pro-smoking attitudes, social norms 
of mother and best friend. Quality of communication related negatively to 
pro-smoking attitudes and positively to self-efficacy and norms of friends. 
Parental smoking was positively associated with pro-smoking attitudes and norms 
of mother and (best) friends. Additionally, more frequent communication and 
higher levels of parental smoking were associated with higher smoking onset. In 
conclusion, smoking-specific communication and parental smoking were associated 
with smoking cognitions and smoking onset. Already during preadolescence, 
parents contribute to shaping the smoking cognitions of their children, which 
may be predictive of smoking later in life.

AIM: To investigate the clinical and radiographic outcome of a one-piece 
zirconia oral implant for single tooth replacement after 1 year.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 65 patients received a one-stage implant 
surgery with immediate temporization. Standardized radiographs were taken at 
implant insertion and after 1 year to monitor peri-implant bone loss. A 
univariate analysis of the influence of different baseline parameters on 
marginal bone loss from implant insertion to 12 months was performed. Soft 
tissue parameters were evaluated at prosthesis insertion and at the 1-year 
follow-up.
RESULTS: After 1 year, three implants were lost, giving a cumulative survival 
rate of 95.4%. The marginal bone loss after 1 year was 1.31 mm. Thirty-four per 
cent of the implants lost at least 2 mm bone, and 14% more than 3 mm. The 
univariate analysis could not depict any parameter influencing marginal bone 
loss. Probing depth, Clinical Attachment Level, Bleeding and Plaque Index 
decreased over 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative survival rate of the presented ceramic implant was 
comparable to the reported survival rate of titanium implants when immediately 
restored. However, the frequency of increased radiographic bone loss (>2 mm) 
after 1 year was considerably higher as compared to conventional two-piece 
titanium implants. The presented zirconia implant can therefore not be 
recommended for clinical usage.

Hans Driesch and the problems of "normal psychology". Rereading his Crisis in 
Psychology (1925).

In 1925, the German biologist and philosopher Hans Driesch published a booklet 
entitled The Crisis in Psychology. It was originally published in English and 
was based on lectures given at various universities in China, Japan and the USA. 
The "crisis" in psychology of that time, in Driesch's opinion, lies in the 
necessity to decide about "the road which psychology is to follow in the 
future". This necessity refers to five "critical points", namely (1) to develop 
the theory of psychic elements to a theory of meaning by phenomenological 
analysis, (2) the overcoming of association theory, (3) to acknowledge that the 
unconscious is a fact and a "normal" aspect of mental life, (4) to reject 
"psychomechanical parallelism" or any other epiphenomenalistic solution of the 
mind-body problem, and (5) the extension of psychical research to new facts as 
described by parapsychology, for instance. Driesch saw close parallels between 
the development of modern psychology and that of biology, namely in a 
theoretical shift from "sum-concepts" like association and mechanics, to 
"totality-concepts" like soul and entelechy. The German translation of 1926 was 
entitled Grundprobleme der Psychologie (Fundamental Problems of Psychology) 
while "the crisis in psychology" forms just the subtitle of this book. This 
underlines that Driesch's argumentation--in contrast to that of Buehler--dealt 
with ontological questions rather than with paradigms.

OBJECTIVE: This study examines the prevalence and correlates of poor glycemic 
control in Mexican Americans aged 75 years and older with diabetes.
METHODS: Data are from the 5(th) wave (2004-05) of the Hispanic Established 
Population for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE). A total of 
2,069 Mexican Americans aged 75 and over were interviewed. Six hundred eighty 
nine subjects (33.5%) reported having been diagnosed with diabetes and 209 
(30.3%) subjects agreed to a blood test of their HbA(1)c level.
RESULTS: Of the 209 diabetic subjects with an HbA(1)c test, 73 (34.9%) had good 
glycemic control (HbA(1)c <7%) and 136 (65.1%) had poor glycemic control 
(HbA(1)c >7%). Bivariate analysis revealed that subjects with poor control had 
longer disease duration, had lower education, used the glucometer more 
frequently, and had more diabetes-complications when compared to those in the 
good glycemic control group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis found 
the following factors associated with poor glycemic control: <8 years of 
education, foreign-born, smoking, obesity, longer disease duration, daily 
glucometer use, and having macro-complications.
DISCUSSION: Prevalence of poor glycemic control is very high in this population 
with very high and rising prevalence of diabetes. Further studies are needed to 
explore the effect of these and other characteristics on glycemic control among 
older Mexican Americans and to develop appropriate interventions to improve 
diabetes outcomes and increase life-expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Empirical surveys about medical futility are scarce relative to its 
theoretical assumptions. We aimed to evaluate the difference of attitudes 
between laypeople and physicians towards the issue.
METHODS: A questionnaire survey was designed. Japanese laypeople (via Internet) 
and physicians with various specialties (via paper-and-pencil questionnaire) 
were asked about whether they would provide potentially futile treatments for 
end-of-life patients in vignettes, important factors for judging a certain 
treatment futile, and threshold of quantitative futility which reflects the 
numerical probability that an act will produce the desired physiological effect. 
Also, the physicians were asked about their practical frequency and important 
reasons for futile treatments.
RESULTS: 1134 laypeople and 401 (80%) physicians responded. In all vignettes, 
the laypeople were more affirmative in providing treatments in question 
significantly. As the factors for judging futility, medical information and 
quality of life (QOL) of the patient were rather stressed by the physicians. 
Treatment wish of the family of the patient and psychological impact on patient 
side due to the treatment were rather stressed by laypeople. There were wide 
variations in the threshold of judging quantitative futility in both groups. 
88.3% of the physicians had practical experience of providing futile treatment. 
Important reasons for it were communication problem with patient side and lack 
of systems regarding futility or foregoing such treatment.
CONCLUSION: Laypeople are more supportive of providing potentially futile 
treatments than physicians. The difference is explained by the importance of 
medical information, the patient family's influence to decision-making and QOL 
of the patient. The threshold of qualitative futility is suggested to be 
arbitrary.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 
China is very high. This study aimed to assess the vulnerability of COPD 
patients in rural areas outside Xuzhou City, Jiangsu province, in order to 
provide helpful guidance for future research and public policies.
METHODS: The vulnerability of 8,217 COPD patients was evaluated using a 
face-to-face questionnaire to obtain information on general characteristics, 
awareness, beliefs, medication usage, acute exacerbation of the disease, and 
economic burdens. Direct economic burdens were calculated based on the 
questionnaire, and indirect economic burdens were estimated using local per 
capita income and life expectancy in 2008. The years of potential life lost were 
calculated using loss of life years for each age group and multiplying by the 
number of deaths in a given age group.
RESULTS: Of the 8,217 patients, 7,921 (96.4%) had not heard of COPD, and 2,638 
(32.1%) did not understand that smoking was a risk factor for COPD. No patients 
had used inhalers, nebulizer drugs or oxygen therapy, either regularly or 
sporadically. No patients had undergone pulmonary rehabilitation or surgical 
treatment, while 4,215 (51.3%) took theophylline to relieve dyspnea, and 3,418 
(41.6%) used antibiotics to treat exacerbations. A total of 2,925 (35.6%) 
patients had been admitted to hospital during the past year because of 
respiratory symptoms. The average direct and indirect economic burdens on COPD 
patients were 1,090 and 20,605 yuan, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The vulnerability of patients in rural Xuzhou to COPD was high. 
Their awareness of COPD was poor, their treatment during both the stable and 
acute exacerbation stages did not meet standards, and the economic burdens were 
large. Interventions are therefore needed to improve the prevention and 
management of COPD in this population. Further studies are required to verify 
these findings.

Area variations in health: a spatial multilevel modeling approach.

Health, 677 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA. marcaya@hsph.harvard.edu

Both space and membership in geographically-embedded administrative units can 
produce variations in health, resulting in geographic clusters of good and poor 
health. Despite important differences between these two types of dependence, one 
is easily mistaken for the other, and the possibility that both are at work is 
commonly ignored. We fit a series of hierarchical and spatially-explicit 
multilevel models to a U.S. county-level life dataset of life expectancy in 1999 
to demonstrate approaches for data analysis and interpretation when multiple 
sources of area-clustering are present. We demonstrate the methods to detect, 
interpret, and differentiate evidence of spatial and geographic membership 
effects and discuss key considerations for analyzing data with spatial or/and 
membership dimensions. We find evidence that life expectancy is driven by both 
within-state geographic process, and by spatial processes. We argue that
