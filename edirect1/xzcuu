BACKGROUND: fall-risk assessment with fall-prevention intervention referral for 
at-risk groups to avoid falls could be cost-effective from a care-payer 
perspective.
AIMS: to model the cost-effectiveness of a fall-risk assessment (QTUG compared 
to TUG) with referral to one of four fall-prevention interventions (Otago, FaME, 
Tai Chi, home safety assessment and modification) compared to no care pathway, 
when the decision to screen is based on older age in a primary care setting for 
community-dwelling people.
METHODS: a cohort-based, decision analytic Markov model was stratified by five 
age groupings (65-70, 70-75, 65-89, 70-89 and 75-89) to estimate cost per 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs included fall-risk assessment, 
fall-prevention intervention and downstream resource use (e.g. inpatient and 
care home admission). Uncertainty was explored using univariate, bivariate and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: screening with QTUG dominates (>QALYs; <costs) screening with TUG 
irrespective of subsequent fall-prevention intervention. The QTUG-based care 
pathways relative to no care pathway have a high probability of 
cost-effectiveness in those aged 75-89 (>85%), relative to those aged 70-74 
(~10 < 30%) or 65-69 (<10%). In the older age group, only a 10% referral uptake 
is required for the QTUG with FaME or Otago modelled care pathways to remain 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: the highest probability of cost-effectiveness observed was a care 
pathway incorporating QTUG with FaME in those aged 75-89. Although the model 
does not fully represent current NICE Falls guidance, decision makers should 
still give careful consideration to implementing the aforementioned care pathway 
due to the modelled high probability of cost-effectiveness.

OBJECTIVES: To examine changes in Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE) against the 
backdrop of rising mortality among less-educated white Americans during the 
first decade of the twenty-first century.
METHODS: This study documented changes in HLE by education among U.S. 
non-Hispanic whites, using data from the U.S. Multiple Cause of Death public-use 
files, the Integrated Public Use Microdata Sample (IPUMS) of the 2000 Census and 
the 2010 American Community Survey, and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). 
Changes in HLE were decomposed into contributions from: (i) change in 
age-specific mortality rates; and (ii) change in disability prevalence, measured 
via Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living 
(IADL).
RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2010, HLE significantly decreased for white men and 
women with less than 12 years of schooling. In contrast, HLE increased among 
college-educated white men and women. Declines or stagnation in HLE among 
less-educated whites reflected increases in disability prevalence over the study 
period, whereas improvements among the college educated reflected decreases in 
both age-specific mortality rates and disability prevalence at older ages.
DISCUSSION: Differences in HLE between education groups increased among 
non-Hispanic whites from 2000 to 2010. In fact, education-based differences in 
HLE were larger than differences in total life expectancy. Thus, the lives of 
less-educated whites were not only shorter, on average, compared with their 
college-educated counterparts, but they were also more burdened with disability.

Incorporating Laboratory Animal Science into Responsible Biomedical Research.

of Guelph Pathobiology.

Biomedical research has made great strides in the past century leading to rapid 
advances in human life expectancy, all derived from improved understanding, 
prevention, and treatment of many diseases and conditions. Research involving 
laboratory animals has played a significant role in this medical progress. 
However, there continues to be controversy surrounding the use of animals in 
research, and animal models have been questioned regarding their relevance to 
human conditions. While research fraud and questionable research practices could 
potentially contribute to this problem, we argue that a relative ignorance of 
laboratory animal science has contributed to the "uncontrolled vivarium 
experiment" that runs parallel to the more controlled scientific experiment. 
Several variables are discussed, including husbandry, animal environment, social 
housing, and more, that can contribute to this uncontrolled experiment, and that 
can simultaneously decrease quality of life for rodent test subjects when 
ignored. An argument is put forward that laboratory animal veterinarians and 
scientists can and should play an important role in better controlling such 
variables. Similarly, the laboratory animal veterinarian and scientist should 
play an important role in responsible science by addressing complex 
interdisciplinary challenges.

population gains in health benefits.

OBJECTIVES: Value-based pricing of oncology drugs provides a best estimate for 
the price of a drug, as it relates to the benefits it provides for individual 
patients. To date, the impact of value-based pricing to reference 
cost-effectiveness thresholds (λ) on individual and population-level health 
benefits remains uncharacterized. The current study examined the potential 
benefits of value-based pricing by quantifying the incremental net health 
benefit (INHB) of publicly funded oncology drugs, if funding occurred at 
manufacturer-submitted price without value-based pricing.
METHODS: Pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR) submissions were reviewed to 
identify eligible drug indications from which final economic guidance panel 
reports were reviewed for incremental costs (ΔC) and quality-adjusted life-years 
(ΔQALY) from manufacturer-submitted, pCODR lower-limit (pCODR-LL) and 
upper-limit (pCODR-UL) re-analyzed estimates. Annual number of cases in Ontario 
for each drug indication was obtained from population databases. Annual QALY 
gain per drug indication was determined by (ΔQALY × cases). Population QALY 
gain/loss in the absence of value-based pricing to reference λ was estimated by 
the INHB: (INHB = [ΔQALY - (ΔC/λ)] × cases).
RESULTS: In total, 34 drug indications (4629 cases) were identified. Annual gain 
in QALYs for the funded drug indications using manufacturer, pCODR-LL, and 
pCODR-UL estimates was 1851, 1617, and 1301, respectively. At a λ $100 000/QALY, 
funding in the absence of value-based pricing resulted in loss of 2311, 2519, 
and 2604 QALYs. This would result in a provincial net annual loss of 460, 902, 
and 1303 QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite an annual gain in QALY per funded drug indication, a net 
loss in QALY for the province, in the absence of value-based pricing, was 
demonstrated. Supportive evidence exists for value-based pricing toward the 
promotion of health benefits for the greater population.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential impact of a melanoma screening programme, 
compared with usual care, on direct costs and life expectancy in the era of 
targeted drugs and cancer immunotherapy.
METHODS: Using a Whole Disease Model approach, a Markov simulation model with a 
time horizon of 25 years was devised to analyse the cost-effectiveness of a 
one-time, general practitioner-based melanoma screening strategy in the 
population aged over 20, compared with no screening. The study considered the 
most up-to-date drug therapy and was conducted from the perspective of the 
Veneto regional healthcare system within the Italian National Health Service. 
Only direct costs were considered. Sensitivity analyses, both one-way and 
probabilistic, were performed to identify the parameters with the greatest 
impact on cost-effectiveness, and to assess the robustness of our model.
RESULTS: Over a 25-year time horizon, the screening intervention dominated usual 
care. The probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these 
findings. The key drivers of the model were the proportion of melanomas detected 
by the screening procedure and the adherence of the target population to the 
screening programme.
CONCLUSIONS: The screening programme proved to be a dominant option compared 
with usual care. These findings should prompt serious consideration of the 
design and implementation of a regional or national melanoma screening strategy 
within a National Health Service.

BACKGROUND: Although evidence is accumulating that lifestyle modification may be 
cost-effective in patients with prediabetes, information is limited on the 
cost-effectiveness of interventions implemented in public health and primary 
health care settings. Evidence from well-conducted pragmatic trials is needed to 
gain insight into the realistic cost-effectiveness of diabetes prevention 
interventions in real-world settings. The aim of this study is to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of the SLIMMER lifestyle intervention targeted at patients at 
high risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with usual health care in a 
primary care setting in the Netherlands.
METHODS: Three hundred and sixteen high-risk subjects were randomly assigned to 
the SLIMMER lifestyle intervention or to usual health care. Costs and outcome 
assessments were performed at the end of the intervention (12 months) and six 
months thereafter (18 months). Costs were assessed from a societal perspective. 
Patients completed questionnaires to assess health care utilisation, participant 
out-of-pocket costs, and productivity losses. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) 
were calculated based on the SF-36 questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness planes and 
acceptability curves were generated using bootstrap analyses.
RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the incremental costs of 
the SLIMMER lifestyle intervention were €547 and that the incremental effect was 
0.02 QALY, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
€28,094/QALY. When cost-effectiveness was calculated from a health care 
perspective, the ICER decreased to €13,605/QALY, with a moderate probability of 
being cost-effective (56% at a willingness to pay, WTP, of €20,000/QALY and 81% 
at a WTP of €80,000/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: The SLIMMER lifestyle intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes had a 
low to moderate probability of being cost-effective, depending on the 
perspective taken.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The SLIMMER study is retrospectively registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier NCT02094911) since March 19, 2014.

While the rare occurrence of child loss is accompanied by reduced life 
expectancy of parents in contemporary affluent populations, its impact in 
developing societies with high child mortality rates is unclear. We identified 
all parents in Iceland born 1800-1996 and compared the mortality rates of 47,711 
parents who lost a child to those of their siblings (N = 126,342) who did not. 
The proportion of parents who experienced child loss decreased from 61.1% of 
those born 1800-1880 to 5.2% of those born after 1930. Child loss was 
consistently associated with increased rate of maternal, but not paternal, death 
before the age of 50 across all parent birth cohorts; the relative increase in 
maternal mortality rate ranged from 35% among mothers born 1800-1930 to 64% 
among mothers born after 1930. The loss of a child poses a threat to the 
survival of young mothers, even during periods of high infant mortality rates.

BACKGROUND: Limited information is available regarding the rate of long-term 
cardiovascular (CV) mortality in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients 
treated with second- and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (2ndG/3rdG 
TKIs) in the real-life practice.
METHODS: We identified 656 consecutive CML patients treated with nilotinib, 
dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib.
RESULTS: The 15-year CV-mortality free survival was 93 ± 2.8%. Age ≥65 years 
(p = 0.005) and a positive history of CV disease (p = 0.04) were significantly 
associated with a lower CV-mortality free survival. CV disease accounted for 
16.5% and 5% of potential years of life lost (PYLL) in male and female patients, 
respectively. The standard mortality ratio (SMR) following ischemic heart 
disease (IHD) was 3.9 in males and 3.8 in female patients, meaning an excess of 
IHD deaths observed, in comparison with the population of control.
CONCLUSION: Prevention strategies based on CV risk factors, in particular in 
those patients with a previous history of CV disease, should be considered.

Despite considerable public health initiatives in the past century, there 
remains a significant gender inequality in life expectancy. The Global Burden of 
Diseases study has highlighted that the life expectancy for men is 70.5years, 
compared with 75.6years for women. This discrepancy in mortality appears to be 
related to a disproportionately higher number of preventable and premature male 
deaths. Whilst there has been an increased focus on men's health, as evidenced 
by the establishment of men's health charities and governmental legislation 
promoting equality, a recent World Health Organization report has highlighted 
that there is still a prevailing misconception that the higher rate of premature 
mortality amongst men is a natural phenomenon. We explore the association of 
male sexual and reproductive health-related diseases and the potential role of a 
urologist in addressing gender inequality in life expectancy. PATIENT SUMMARY: 
In this report, we discuss the causes for the gender gap in life expectancy and 
highlight that men continue to have a higher rate of premature death than women, 
which is associated with diseases of the male reproductive system. Furthermore, 
this not only appears to be related to a number of metabolic and lifestyle 
factors, but may also be the result of the increased risk of cancer in men with 
sexual and reproductive health-related diseases.

Although the early diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) enhances life expectancy 
with a 5-year survival rate of 100 %, metastasized-PCa is the fundamental reason 
for death by PCa, hence requires an advanced and target-directed treatment 
strategy. Metastasis is considered to be initiated with the 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) event in which tumor cells change their 
epithelial characteristics into mesenchymal form and exacerbates the cancer 
progression. Herein, we investigated the effect and mechanism of resveratrol 
function in PCa cell proliferation and migration and reported that TNF-receptor 
associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an unconventional E3 ligase, is a key mediator of 
resveratrol function to inhibit PCa cell growth and proliferation and targeted 
for lysosomal degradation by resveratrol. MTT and cell counting demonstrated 
that resveratrol inhibited the viability and proliferation in DU145 and PC3 
cells. Resveratrol (50 μM) mediated the degradation of TRAF6 which in turn 
facilitated repression of the NF-κB pathway. Also, wound healing and transwell 
migration assays and level of EMT-related proteins showed that resveratrol used 
TRAF6, at least in part to inhibit cell migration. Overexpression of TRAF6 
augmented EMT in PCa by upregulating the expression of transcription factor 
SLUG. Moreover, TRAF6 overexpression was closely associated with EMT process 
through the NF-κB pathway. Our exploration exhibited that resveratrol may 
inhibit EMT through the TRAF6/NF-κB/SLUG axis. Altogether, this study represents 
that TRAF6 acts as an intermediary of resveratrol action to suppress PCa cell 
proliferation and migration, and concerns future attention to obtain as a 
therapeutic target for the treatment of PCa.

In patients with inadequate hearing improvement after tympanoplasty and failure 
of conventional hearing aid fitting, active hearing implants provide an 
alternative treatment option. Active middle ear implants function as a 
vibromechanical bypass of the stiffness and damping effect of a poorly 
oscillating tympanic membrane and the (reconstructed) ossicular chain. The 
selection of the hearing system depends on the maximum output levels of the 
hearing system and the anatomical conditions in mostly multiply operated ears. 
The development of variable coupling elements for active middle ear implants led 
to an extension of the indications to include not only purely sensorineural 
hearing loss but also mixed and conductive hearing loss in patients, as the 
transducer can now be coupled to the (mobile) stapes or the round window 
membrane. The article provides an overview of current clinical study results and 
recommendations on the indications for active hearing implants in patients with 
chronic otitis media.

Publisher: Bei Patienten mit unzureichender Hörverbesserung nach Tympanoplastik 
können aktive Hörimplantate eine Hörrehabilitation bei frustraner 
Hörgeräteversorgung ermöglichen, in dem sie im Sinne eines vibromechanischen 
Bypasses die Steifigkeit und Dämpfung eines schlecht schwingenden Trommelfells 
bzw. einer (rekonstruierten) Gehörknöchelchenkette umgehen. Die Auswahl des 
Hörsystems ist dabei abhängig vom maximalen Ausgangspegel des Hörsystems sowie 
den anatomischen Voraussetzungen im meist mehrfach voroperierten Ohr. In den 
letzten Jahren führte die Entwicklung variabler Koppelelemente für aktive 
Mittelohrimplantate zu einer Indikationserweiterung von der reinen 
Schallempfindungsschwerhörigkeit zur Schallleitungs- und kombinierten 
Schwerhörigkeit, da sie nun am (beweglichen) Steigbügel oder der 
Rundfenstermembran angekoppelt werden können. Der Artikel gibt eine Übersicht 
über aktuelle Studienergebnisse und Indikationsempfehlungen für aktive 
Hörimplantate bei Patienten mit chronischer Otitis media.

Longitudinal methods aggregate individual health histories to produce inferences 
about aging populations, but to what extent do these summaries reflect the 
experiences of older adults? We describe the assumption of gradual change built 
into several influential statistical models and draw on widely used, nationally 
representative survey data to empirically compare the conclusions drawn from 
mixed-regression methods (growth curve models and latent class growth analysis) 
designed to capture trajectories with key descriptive statistics and methods 
(multistate life tables and sequence analysis) that depict discrete states and 
transitions. We show that individual-level data record stasis irregularly 
punctuated by relatively sudden change in health status or mortality. Although 
change is prevalent in the sample, for individuals it occurs rarely, at 
irregular times and intervals, and in a nonlinear and multidirectional fashion. 
We conclude by discussing the implications of this punctuated equilibrium 
pattern for understanding health changes in individuals and the dynamics of 
inequality in aging populations.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in 
the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brain, as well as the degeneration of 
motor and nonmotor circuitries. The cause of neuronal death is currently 
unknown, although chronic neuroinflammation, aggregated α-synuclein, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress have all been implicated. 
Gliosis has been shown to exacerbate neuroinflammation via secretion of 
proinflammatory cytokines, and there is a subsequent infiltration of T 
lymphocytes (T-cells), into the brain of PD patients. Using liquid 
chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), we have observed 
metabolomic changes in stool samples, thought to be associated with the 
potential disease-modifying effect of immunotherapy administered to transgenic 
Parkinsonian (A53T) mice. Significant elevations (p < 0.05) in metabolites 
associated with immune response (taurine, histamine, and its methylated product, 
3-methylhistamine) are identified as being higher in the mice undergoing 
immunotherapy. Furthermore, a reduction in triacylglycerol (TG) and 
diacylglycerol (DG) expressions in stool following immunotherapy suggests a 
regulation of lipid breakdown or biosynthesis with the vaccine. These "omics" 
markers (among others reported in this article) along with weight gain and 
increased life expectancy suggest that immunotherapy is positively modifying the 
disease state.

More and more elderly patients are being admitted to the hospital. These elderly 
patients represent a significant proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) 
admissions. Older ICU patients have a high risk of death during their ICU 
admission and, if they do survive, a high risk of physical and cognitive 
decline. In addition, their remaining life expectancy is often limited. In 
short, elderly patients have less to gain from ICU treatment than young 
patients. It is therefore important to carefully consider the proportionality of 
ICU treatment. In this clinical lesson, we discuss aspects of the elderly ICU 
patient that should be taken into account when considering ICU treatment, in 
acute situations as well as in outpatient or GP settings.

BACKGROUND: Palliative care (PC) for patients with malignant hematological 
diseases is scarcely documented, particularly in low- and middle-income 
countries. This study aimed to document PC provided to patients with hematologic 
malignancies.
METHODS: Bidirectional study conducted from July 2016 to June 2019 at the 
hematology and palliative care departments at a reference center in Northeast 
Mexico for low-income open population uninsured patients. Clinical records and 
electronic files of patients with malignant hematological diseases of both sexes 
and all ages attending an academic hematology center were reviewed. Statistical 
analysis was performed with the SPSS version 22 program. Acute and chronic 
leukemias, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and others 
were included.
RESULTS: Five-hundred ten patients were studied, of which 148 (29%) died. 
Eighty-one (15.88%) patients including 31 (20.9%) who died received PC. Median 
age at palliative diagnosis was 42 (2-91) years. The most common symptom was 
pain (69.7%). The most frequent reason for palliative referral was 
treatment-refractory disease (39%). During the last week of life, 19 (95%) of 20 
patients had blood sampling; 17 (85%) received antibiotics; 16 (80%) had a 
urinalysis performed; 16 (80%) received analgesia, including paracetamol (11, 
35.5%) and buprenorphine (7, 22.6%); 10 (50%) received blood products; 9 (45%) 
were intubated; and central venous catheters were inserted in 5 (25%) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Palliative care was provided to a minority of patients with 
hematologic malignancies and considerable improvement is required in its timely 
use and extension.

Aims: Owhadi is a popular commercial pistachio cultivar in Iran which could be 
an attractive source for natural bioactive compounds with health-promoting 
activity.Methods: The hulls subjected to fractionation and ethyl acetate 
fraction was a phenolic-enriched fraction (PEF). The PEF was encapsulated in 
nanoliposomes (PEF-NLs) as a newly developed delivery system. The phytochemical 
analysis of PEF-NLs confirmed the presence of phenolic and flavonoid 
compounds.Results: The PEF-NLs indicated the strong antioxidant activity through 
up-regulation of the antioxidant-related genes in the murine hepatocyte. The 
PEF-NLs indicated the notable anti-inflammatory activity by scavenging the 
nitric oxide (NO) and reducing the NO production in the murine macrophage cells. 
The PEF-NLs have also exhibited the anti-melanogenic activity through direct 
tyrosinase enzyme inhibition and by modulating melanin biosynthesis genes in 
B16F10 melanoma cells.Conclusion: The PEF-NLs possessed the promising potential 
to be used for controlling skin pigmentation disorders and as a skin-whitening 
agent in the cosmetic industry.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of HIV patients has increased considerably as a 
result of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and cardiovascular (CV) disease has 
emerged as an important late concern. People with HIV infection could have an 
impaired systolic function; however data on diastolic function and markers of CV 
risk, such as epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and intima-media thickness (IMT), 
are lacking. Aim of this study is to evaluate left ventricular function, EAT, 
and IMT in children and adolescents with vertically acquired HIV infection.
METHODS: We enrolled 29 subjects on ART (13, 45% men; median age of 13.0, and 
interquartile range 9-18), and 29 age-matched controls. All patients and 
controls underwent echocardiographic evaluation, with study of the systolic and 
diastolic function and measurement of the EAT, and a carotid ultrasound study 
for IMT measurement.
RESULTS: Comparing HIV-infected patients to healthy controls, we found a 
statistically significant increase of EAT and IMT (mean ± SD) (EAT: 3.16 ± 1.05 
vs 1.24 ± 0.61 mm; P < 0.0001. IMT: 0.77 ± 0.15 vs 0.51 ± 0.11 mm; P < 0.0001), 
and a significant reduction of ejection fraction, evaluated with the biplane 
Simpson method (mean ± SD) (58.5% ± 6.66% vs 66% ± 4.24%; P = 0.029). These 
results are not related with age, gender, degree of lipodystrophy, dyslipidemia, 
hyperinsulinism, and ART duration or the use of single antiretroviral classes.
CONCLUSIONS: Vertically infected HIV children and adolescents show an increased 
thickness of EAT and IMT, expression of potentially increased CV risk. They also 
show an impaired systolic function.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to conduct the first systematic 
evaluation of the long-term economic impact of arsenic trioxide (ATO) plus 
all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for the treatment of patients with newly 
diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) from the perspective of the Chinese 
health care system.
METHODS: On the basis of clinical data from a randomized phase 3 trial, a 
time-dependent Markov model with 4 health states (complete remission, relapse or 
treatment failure, post-treatment failure, and death) was used to evaluate the 
incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from the ATO plus 
ATRA regimen compared with the ATRA plus chemotherapy (CT) regimen over a 
30-year period. All costs were adjusted to 2018 levels based on the Chinese 
Consumer Price Index. Both costs and health outcomes were discounted by 3% 
annually. One-way sensitivity analysis and probability sensitivity analysis were 
performed.
RESULTS: Compared with the ATRA plus CT strategy, the ATO plus ATRA strategy was 
associated with 1.38 additional QALYs gained and $392.05 (estimated in 2018 US 
dollars) in incremental costs per patient over 30 years. Consequently, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $284.02 per QALY gained, which was far 
below the Chinese willingness-to-pay threshold of $29,306 per QALY gained. 
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of these results.
CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the Chinese health care system, the ATO 
plus ATRA strategy is cost-effective for patients with newly diagnosed APL 
compared with the ATRA plus CT strategy. Therefore, the authors strongly suggest 
that China's health authorities choose the former strategy for these patients, 
whether for the elderly or for young people.

Wind speed is the most essential factor causing wheat lodging. Accurate 
understanding of the wind speed characteristics at near-surface layer of wheat 
fields and its effect on lodging is the basis of objective evaluation of wheat 
lodging resistance. In this paper, the characteristics of wind speed at the 
near-surface layer of wheat fields and their impact on lodging were studied. A 
new device was proposed for directly measuring the critical thrust force of 
wheat population lodging resistance in the field based on the black box method. 
A novel wheat stem lodging resistance evaluation method/model was established 
based on the critical thrust force of wheat population stem lodging and the wind 
speed characteristics of field near-surface layer. The method used the lodging 
critical wind speed as the index of wheat lodging resistance, which was verified 
by wind tunnel and field experiment. The results showed that there was a 
significant positive correlation between the critical wind speed of wheat 
lodging resistance and its critical thrust force. The values of wheat canopy 
apparent roughness length, wind attack angle, ventilation coefficient and other 
wind field characteristics had important effects on the calculation of wheat 
lodging resistance critical wind speed. The method can eliminate bias when 
calculating wheat lodging resistance by considering only one or a few indicators 
and the results of field lodging evaluation were consistent with those of field 
lodging survey. The method is simple and can be used to assess the lodging 
resistance of wheat, select extension regions for wheat varieties, and evaluate 
lodging factors in the field.

We record Raorchestes parvulus (Boulenger, 1893) for the first time from China 
based on six specimens collected from southern Yunnan. Phylogenetically these 
individuals were placed in a clade with R. parvulus from Southeast Asia and 
pairwise genetic distances in DNA sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene 
ranged from 0 to 3.1% within the clade. Morphologically these specimens agree 
with R. parvulus in a series of characters including body size small, a large 
external vocal sac, vomerine teeth absent, snout slightly shorter than the 
diameter of the orbit, canthus rostralis indistinct, interorbital space broader 
than the upper eyelid, tympanum indistinct, fingers free, toes webbed at the 
base, an inner metatarsal tubercle, tibio-tarsal articulation reaches eye, small 
warts on the dorsal surfaces of body and limbs, throat smooth, belly granular, a 
dark triangular blotch between the eyes, a butterfly-like dark band on the back, 
a dark blotch on each side of lumbar region, and more or less distinct dark bars 
across limbs. Obvious intraspecific variation in the color pattern occurs within 
the population. It is possible that previous records of Raorchestes 
longchuanensis (Yang and Li, 1979) from southern Yunnan might be 
misidentification of R. parvulus.
