The present study aimed to develop a commercial active packaging system of 
ground beef, by exploiting the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of a 
traditional Greek alcoholic distillate called "tsipouro". Commercial packages 
(500 g) were used and 40 mL of "tsipouro" was added in absorbent pads placed 
underneath the ground beef, while 10 mL was also mounted under the packaging 
film, facing the headspace. Samples were packaged in 80% O2: 20% CO2 and stored 
at 0, 4, 8, and 12 °C. Total Viable Counts, pseudomonads, Brochothrix 
thermosphacta, lactic acid bacteria, yeasts-moulds, pH, colour (L*, a*, b*), 
odour (buttery and acidic), and ethanol migration to ground beef (SPME/GC-FID) 
were determined. Moreover, mathematical models (square root and Arrhenius) 
describing the effect of temperature on determinant indicators of spoilage and 
quality deterioration like growth of dominant microorganisms and red colour 
reduction were developed and validated under non-isothermal conditions. B. 
thermosphacta dominated the microbial association of ground beef, while LAB were 
second in dominance, revealing a high growth potential at all assays. a* value 
(redness) was gradually decreased in controls, while samples treated with 
"tsipouro" showed more stable red colour during storage. Although ethanol was 
organoleptically detectable, especially at low storage temperatures (0-4 °C), it 
was rather perceived as a pleasant cool odour. Prediction by both models for 
microbial growth as well as those of Arrhenius model for reduction of a* value 
showed good agreement with the observations under non-isothermal storage. 
Overall, our study showed that the developed antimicrobial active packaging of 
ground beef based on "tsipouro", combined with high oxygen MAP lead to an almost 
2-fold shelf-life extension compared with controls during storage at chill and 
abuse temperatures.

BACKGROUND: Child maltreatment leads to enormous adverse short- and long-term 
health outcomes. The aim of this study is to estimate the burden of disease and 
the cost of illness attributable to child maltreatment in Japan.
METHODS: An incidence-based top-down cost of illness analysis was conducted to 
estimate medical costs and burden of disease attributable to child maltreatment 
based on a societal perspective. The assessment included short-term and 
long-term medical costs and burden of disease measured by Disability-Adjusted 
Life Years (DALYs) that generates mortality and morbidities, based on several 
national surveys and systematic review. We considered the main types of child 
maltreatment as exposure, for which the incidence was obtained from literature 
review. Based on population attributable fractions (PAFs), burden of disease of 
physical and mental health consequences attributable to child maltreatment were 
estimated. Then DALYs were converted into monetary value. The lifetime economic 
burden was finally estimated by combining with medical costs and subject to 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The lifetime disease burden expressed in DALYs was estimated at 
1,047,580 DALYs (95% CI 788,388 - 1326,80 DALYs) for the cohort victims in 2016. 
Based on the incidence according to literature review, the overall lifetime 
economic burden was 50.24 billion USD, equivalent to 1.3 million times of gross 
domestic product (GDP) per capita. Among the total economic burden, costs of 
suffering and pain based on DALYs were accounting for 81.3%. These estimates 
were 7-8 times of conservative estimates which used incidence data from official 
reported cases.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the national lifetime cost was huge and 
equivalent to 1.3 million GDP per capita, and its burden of disease was 
approximately equal to that of colon and rectum cancers or stomach cancer. Our 
findings particularly in terms of revealed the considerable burden of disease in 
long term and potential effects of the strengthened maternal and child care as 
the preventive strategy.

BACKGROUND: Various maternal conditions, especially in utero conditions and 
prenatal exposure to environments with air pollution and greenness, have been 
reviewed to address the enhancement and prevention of susceptibility to health 
risks, including low birthweight, preterm delivery, and preeclampsia. This study 
aimed to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the associations between 
pregnancy outcomes and the characteristics of surrounding living environment, 
including greenness, air pollution, and civilization.
METHODS: A secondary search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, 
K-eArticles, and CINAHL databases was conducted without language restrictions to 
identify the relevant publications from the time of inception of the databases 
to April 2019.
RESULTS: A total of 89 studies were identified, and 10 were included in the 
quantitative synthesis. The greenness of the environment within 100-, 250- and 
500-m buffers, after adjusting for the air quality and civilization factors, was 
weakly but positively associated with birthweight. The pooled regression slope 
was 0.00134 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.000, 0.0020). The greenness of the 
environment was also associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of 
poor pregnancy outcomes, namely, low birthweight, small for gestational age 
(odds ratio [OR] 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92, 0.97), and preterm delivery (OR 0.98; 95% 
CI, 0.97, 0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: The greenness of the environment had a positive effect on the 
pregnancy outcomes, despite poor air quality and civilization. Following 
urbanization, planning for greenness management, environmental medicine, and 
public health is important and thus should be proposed as preventive methods as 
way of increasing birthweight and life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: The cost-effectiveness of apixaban was compared with enoxaparin for 
prevention of postoperative venothromboembolic events (VTE) in gynecologic 
oncology patients. Current guidelines recommend thromboprophylaxis with low 
molecular weight heparin for 28 days following gynecologic cancer surgery, but 
recent trials suggest that oral apixaban may be a safe, patient-preferred 
alternative. Apixaban was superior to enoxaparin in a Canadian 
cost-effectiveness analysis using orthopedics trial data.
METHODS: Medication costs, adherence rates, event rates, event costs, and 
utility decrements were estimated using prior clinical trial data and literature 
review for input into a short-term decision model to simulate outcomes in a 
hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) were calculated as net cost difference per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained. Input values at which net costs and QALYs were equivalent and 
ICERs at upper and lower bounds were evaluated.
RESULTS: Using aggregated costs, apixaban was less expensive and more effective 
than enoxaparin, and remained so or had high value in all scenarios on 
sensitivity analysis. Examining disaggregated ICERs, apixaban was cost-effective 
for deep venous thrombosis (DVT); of high value for clinically-relevant 
non-major bleeding (CRNMB) ($411); low value for major bleeding ($183,465), 
VTE-related death ($2,711,229), and all-cause mortality ($297,522); and not 
cost-effective for pulmonary embolism prevention.
CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban is more cost-effective than enoxaparin for the prevention 
of postoperative VTE in patients with gynecologic cancer. This appears to be 
driven largely by DVT and CRNMB prevention.

BACKGROUND: Despite having high comorbidity rates and shortened life expectancy, 
patients with ESKD may harbor unrealistically optimistic expectations about 
their prognoses. Whether this affects resuscitation orders is unknown.
METHODS: To determine whether do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders differ among 
patients with ESKD compared with other critically ill patients, including those 
with diseases of other major organs, we investigated DNR orders on admission to 
intensive care units (ICUs) among 106,873 patients in the United States.
RESULTS: Major organ disease uniformly associated with increased risk of 
hospital mortality, particularly for cirrhosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.67; 
95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.30 to 3.08), and ESKD (aOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 
1.31 to 1.65). Compared with critically ill patients without major organ 
disease, patients with stroke, cancer, heart failure, dementia, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, and cirrhosis were statistically more likely to 
have a DNR order on ICU admission; those with ESKD were not. Findings were 
similar when comparing patients with a single organ disease with those without 
organ disease. The disconnect between prognosis and DNR use was most notable 
among Black patients, for whom ESKD (compared with no major organ disease) was 
associated with a 62% (aOR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.27 to 2.04) higher odds of hospital 
mortality, but no appreciable difference in DNR utilization (aOR, 1.06; 95% CI, 
0.66 to 1.62).
CONCLUSIONS: Unlike patients with diseases of other major organs, critically ill 
patients with ESKD were not more likely to have a DNR order than patients 
without ESKD. Whether this reflects a greater lack of advance care planning in 
the nephrology community, as well as a missed opportunity to minimize 
potentially needless patient suffering, requires further study.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate regional disparities in the influence of diabetes on 
population health, we examine life expectancies at age 50 between population 
with diabetes and healthy population and life quality among the population with 
diabetes among native-born Americans by birth region and current residence.
METHODS: Using data on a cohort of 17 686 native-born individuals from the 
Health and Retirement Survey (1998-2014), we applied a Bayesian multistate life 
table method to estimate life expectancies at age 50 between population with 
diabetes and healthy population by each birth/current region combination. We 
further estimate the proportion of life remaining without either chronic 
conditions or disabilities as a quality of life measure and the probabilities 
that one region is worse than the other in terms of different health outcomes.
RESULTS: At age 50, persons with diabetes (PWD) were expected to live on average 
5.8-10.8 years less than their healthy equivalents across regions. Diabetes had 
the greatest influence on life expectancy (LE) for older adults who lived in the 
South at the time of interviews. PWD born in the South were more likely to have 
developed chronic conditions or disabilities and spent greater proportions of 
life with these two issues compared to other regions.
CONCLUSION: Diabetes is a significant threat to LE and healthy LE in the USA, 
particularly for people born or living in the South.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) 
prioritisation to mitigate the impact of delays in the colorectal cancer (CRC) 
urgent diagnostic (2-week-wait (2WW)) pathway consequent from the COVID-19 
pandemic.
DESIGN: We modelled the reduction in CRC survival and life years lost resultant 
from per-patient delays of 2-6 months in the 2WW pathway. We stratified by age 
group, individual-level benefit in CRC survival versus age-specific nosocomial 
COVID-19-related fatality per referred patient undergoing colonoscopy. We 
modelled mitigation strategies using thresholds of FIT triage of 2, 10 and 
150 µg Hb/g to prioritise 2WW referrals for colonoscopy. To construct the 
underlying models, we employed 10-year net CRC survival for England 2008-2017, 
2WW pathway CRC case and referral volumes and per-day-delay HRs generated from 
observational studies of diagnosis-to-treatment interval.
RESULTS: Delay of 2/4/6 months across all 11 266 patients with CRC diagnosed per 
typical year via the 2WW pathway were estimated to result in 653/1419/2250 
attributable deaths and loss of 9214/20 315/32 799 life years. Risk-benefit from 
urgent investigatory referral is particularly sensitive to nosocomial COVID-19 
rates for patients aged >60. Prioritisation out of delay for the 18% of 
symptomatic referrals with FIT >10 µg Hb/g would avoid 89% of these deaths 
attributable to presentational/diagnostic delay while reducing immediate 
requirement for colonoscopy by >80%.
CONCLUSIONS: Delays in the pathway to CRC diagnosis and treatment have potential 
to cause significant mortality and loss of life years. FIT triage of symptomatic 
patients in primary care could streamline access to colonoscopy, reduce delays 
for true-positive CRC cases and reduce nosocomial COVID-19 mortality in older 
true-negative 2WW referrals. However, this strategy offers benefit only in 
short-term rationalisation of limited endoscopy services: the appreciable 
false-negative rate of FIT in symptomatic patients means most colonoscopies will 
still be required.

Whether balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) may provide an effective palliation 
in symptomatic high-risk patients is uncertain. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate 
outcomes in symptomatic high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), who 
underwent BAV. All-cause mortality and length of hospitalization for heart 
failure (HF) up to death or to 1-year follow up were collected after BAV. One 
hundred thirty-two (132) patients (62% women), mean age 85±7 years, underwent 
BAV with a substantial reduction of the peak-to-peak aortic gradient from 53±21 
to 29±15 mmHg (p<0.001). The median of days of HF hospitalization prior to BAV 
was 9 (0-19), and decreased after BAV to 0 (0-9), p<0.001. During 1-year 
follow-up patients with untreated CAD (85, 64%) had a higher mortality compared 
to patients with insignificant/treated CAD (47, 36%): 1-year survival: 45±7% vs. 
66± 7%; p=0.02. After adjustment for STS risk score and severity of residual AS, 
patients with untreated CAD remained at higher risk of mortality (adjusted HR 
1.74 [1.01-2.91]; p=0.04). Thus, in this series of symptomatic high-risk 
patients, BAV was associated with a significant reduction in aortic valve 
gradient and hospitalization time for HF post-BAV. In patients with significant 
CAD, percutaneous intervention might be considered in order to improve survival.

Although the black-white gap in life expectancy has been shrinking in the U.S., 
national improvement conceals ongoing disparities. Nowhere is this more evident 
than Washington D.C., where the black-white gap has persistently exceeded 
10 years. Using 1999-2017 mortality data from the National Center for Health 
Statistics, we employed demographic techniques to pursue three aims: first, we 
created period life tables to examine longevity trends in Washington D.C.; 
second, we decomposed black-white life expectancy differences into 23 causes of 
death in three time periods (2000, 2008, 2016); third, we assessed age-specific 
contributions for each cause of death. Findings revealed that heart disease 
(4.14 years), homicide (2.43 years), and cancer (2.30 years) contributed most to 
the 17.23-year gap among males in 2016. Heart disease and cancer contributed 
most at ages 55-69; homicide contributed most at ages 20-29. Among females in 
2016, heart disease (3.24 years), cancer (2.36 years), and unintentional 
injuries (0.85 years) contributed most to the 12.06-year gap. Heart disease and 
cancer contributed most at ages 55-69, and unintentional injuries at ages 50-59. 
Our investigation provides detailed evidence about contributors to the 
black-white longevity gap in Washington D.C., which can aid in the development 
of targeted public health interventions.

BACKGROUND: Health technology assessment has been increasingly used in China, 
having been legally mandated in 2019, to inform reimbursement decisions and 
price negotiations between the National Healthcare Security Administration and 
pharmaceutical companies around the price of new pharmaceuticals. The criteria 
currently used to judge cost effectiveness and inform pricing negotiations, 
3 × GDP per capita, is based on the rule of thumb previously recommended by the 
World Health Organization rather than an estimate based on an empirical 
assessment of health opportunity costs.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to inform a cost-effectiveness 
threshold for health technology assessment in China that accounts for health 
opportunity cost.
METHODS: The elasticity of health outcomes with respect to health expenditure 
was estimated using variations across 30 provincial-level administrative 
divisions in 2017 controlling for a range of other factors and using an 
instrumental variable approach to account for endogeneity to assess robustness 
of results. The estimated elasticity was then used to calculate the cost per 
disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted by variations in Chinese health 
expenditure at the margin.
RESULTS: The range estimated from this study, 27,923-52,247 (2017 RMB) (central 
estimate 37,446) per DALY averted or 47-88% of GDP per capita (central estimate 
63%), shows that a cost per DALY averted cost-effectiveness threshold that 
reflects health opportunity costs is below 1 × GDP per capita.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the current cost-effectiveness threshold 
used in China is too high; continuing to use it risks decisions that reduce 
overall population health.

BACKGROUND: A sense of place (SOP) is defined as the emotional bonds, values, 
meaning, and symbols attached to a place.
AIM: To assess SOP of patients with cancer during end-of-life care at home 
(home-hospice service) versus at a hospital in relation to place of care, social 
support, and emotional distress.
METHODS: Participants were 150, stage IV, cancer patients with a life expectancy 
of less than 6 months, as defined by oncological staff, who were not receiving 
any life-prolonging care. Seventy-five patients received care at home 
(home-hospice), and the other 75 received care at the oncology department at the 
hospital, by palliative unit staff. Participants completed the Brief Symptom 
Inventory anxiety and depression subscales, questionnaires on perceived support 
and both questionnaires on home SOP and hospital SOP.
RESULTS: Mean scores of emotional distress were similar for patients in 
home-hospice and at the hospital. Home SOP among individuals receiving care at 
home was high, and hospital SOP was high among hospitalized individuals. The 
structural equation model had good fit indexes, showing that each of the SOP 
variables mediated the association between place of care and emotional distress. 
Perceived support was associated with lower distress only in the hospital 
setting.
CONCLUSIONS: The SOP concept is relevant to understanding emotional distress in 
relation to place of care at end of life. Strengthening SOP in relation to place 
of care should be considered. As newly introduced concept regarding place of 
care at the EoL, SOP warrants further research.

In recent years, microporous modified atmosphere packaging has been widely 
concerned because of its adjustable air permeability and low processing cost. 
With the development and increasing demand of fresh food industry, the limited 
permeability of film in modified atmosphere packaging can't meet the 
fresh-keeping requirements of fresh foods, especially vegetables and fruits. 
Microporous film can flexibly adjust the gas permeability according to the 
physiological metabolic characteristics of fresh foods, which has gradually 
become a fresh-keeping technology in the domain of vegetables and fruits. This 
paper reviewed the research progress of microporous modified atmosphere 
packaging and its extension on shelf life of fresh foods. The latest applied 
researches were described in a comprehensive manner, particularly fruits and 
vegetables. Besides, this article also covered theoretical support and analysis, 
including the perforation mode, air permeability mechanism and mathematical 
model of microporous film, the characteristics of fresh foods, pore parameters 
and traits of film materials. This paper payed attention to the application of 
environmentally friendly degradable film materials (biological film materials, 
nano materials) in fruits and vegetables preservation. Research has shown that 
the degradable material can enlarge the fresh-keeping effect of microporous 
modified atmosphere packaging, which is worthy of further research and 
development. Finally, the development trends and directions in the future were 
discussed.

The Relationship Between Blood Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1α, Fetuin-A, 
Fibrinogen, Homocysteine, and Amputation Level.

Reduced life expectancy has resulted from an increased incidence of chronic 
complications in patients with diabetes. The diabetic foot is one of these 
complications and generally presents together with diabetic neuropathy and 
vascular insufficiency. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is important in 
developing the adaptation response to hypoxia and facilitates healing through 
regulation of keratinocyte migration and epithelium restoration in wounds. 
Fetuin-A is a transporter protein that is synthesized in the liver and inhibits 
vascular and ectopic calcifications. It has been observed that altered fetuin-A 
is associated with peripheral artery disease through vascular calcification and 
is associated with inflammation and metabolic syndrome occurrence in diabetic 
patients. Fibrinogen is an acute-phase reactant and has a major role in 
homeostasis, tissue repair, and wound healing. Increased fibrinogen blood level 
is one of the factors that facilitates the hypercoagulability in diabetics. 
Homocysteine has atherogenic features and causes vascular toxicity by enhancing 
low-density lipoprotein oxidation. We evaluated the association of serum HIF-1α, 
fetuin-A, fibrinogen, and homocysteine levels with amputation in 31 patients 
diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. According to our evaluation, a negative 
correlation was determined between fetuin-A and amputation level (P = .012, r = 
-0.450), which was statistically significant. Unfortunately, there was no 
significant correlation between HIF-1α, fibrinogen, homocysteine, and amputation 
level (P > .05). As a result, it was suggested that vascular calcification due 
to fetuin-A deficiency may be important in the diabetic foot pathogenesis and 
that fetuin-A levels may be a predictor for amputation level.

This article analyzes the main indicators of the incidence and life expectancy 
of the population of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) over a twenty-year period. 
An increase in the incidence rate of the population was revealed that exceeded 
the average for the country and the Far Eastern Federal District, including for 
oncological diseases, the level of which increased several times in the 
republic. The value of the indicator of life expectancy in the republic 
approached the average Russian level, while 20 years ago a much lower indicator 
was determined. In the dynamics of indicators of the morbidity of the population 
and life expectancy over a twenty-year period, a polynomial trend has been 
outlined. For example, the incidence of neoplasms and diseases of the 
circulatory system showed a sharp increase in 2004, followed by a decrease, for 
diseases of the digestive system - similarly, an increase in 2001 and a 
subsequent decrease. This aspect requires an additional detailed study of the 
causes of such changes in order to be able to predict them in the future.

Opportunities and Challenges of Value-Based Health Care: How Brazil Can Learn 
from U.S. Experience.

The movement toward value-based care is occurring in many countries of the 
world. The increasing population, longer life expectancy, and rising cost for 
high-tech care necessitates that government and private payers around the world 
devise new ways to ensure that health care dollars are spent on the most 
effective interventions. In this Viewpoints article, we present the value-based 
care transformation that is currently in its infancy in Brazil, which has a mix 
of private and public payers but still largely reimburses based on a 
fee-for-service model. We contrast that with recent experience in the United 
States, where value-based care is slowly but surely becoming the norm. The 
Brazilian system has many opportunities to learn from the U.S. shift to 
value-based care-including the development of quality measures, transition to 
value-based payment, and leveraging data to rank performance across Brazilian 
health systems. Pharmaceutical manufacturers in Brazil can play a role, as well, 
with value-based agreements and partnerships with payers. Each country will 
travel on its own path to value-based health care, but the opportunity to learn 
from each other presents one of the best chances for success. DISCLOSURES:

BACKGROUND: Globally, tobacco consumption continues to cause a huge burden of 
preventable diseases. Chile has been leading the tobacco burden ranking in the 
Latin American region for the last ten years; it has currently a 33. 3% 
prevalence of current smokers.
METHODS: A microsimulation economic model was developed within the framework of 
a multi-country project in order to estimate the burden attributable to smoking 
in terms of morbidity, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and 
direct costs of care. We also modelled the impact of increasing cigarettes' 
taxes on this burden.
RESULTS: In Chile, 16,472 deaths were attributable to smoking in 2017, which 
represent around 16% of all deaths. This burden corresponds to 416,445 DALYs per 
year. The country's health system spends 1.15 trillion pesos annually (in Dec 
2017 CLP, approx. U$D 1.8 billion) in health care treatment of illnesses caused 
by smoking. If the price of tobacco cigarettes was to be raised by 50%, around 
13,665 deaths and 360,476 DALYs from smoking-attributable diseases would be 
averted in 10 years, with subsequent savings on health care costs, and increased 
tax revenue collection. In Chile, the tobacco tax collection does not fully 
cover the direct healthcare costs attributed to smoking.
CONCLUSION: Despite a reduction observed on smoking prevalence between 2010 
(40.6%) and 2017 (33.3%), this study shows that the burden of disease, and the 
economic toll due to smoking, remain high. As we demonstrate, a rise in the 
price of cigarettes could lead to a significant reduction of this burden, 
averting deaths and disability, and reducing healthcare spending.

Agonism of the endothelial receptor APJ (putative receptor protein related to 
AT1; AT1: angiotensin II receptor type 1) has the potential to ameliorate 
congestive heart failure by increasing cardiac output without inducing 
hypertrophy. Although the endogenous agonist, pyr-apelin-13 (1), has shown 
beneficial APJ-mediated inotropic effects in rats and humans, such effects are 
short-lived given its extremely short half-life. Here, we report the conjugation 
of 1 to a fatty acid, providing a lipidated peptide (2) with increased stability 
that retains inotropic activity in an anesthetized rat myocardial infarction 
(MI) model. We also report the preparation of a library of 15-mer APJ agonist 
peptide-lipid conjugates, including 
adipoyl-γGlu-OEG-OEG-hArg-r-Q-hArg-P-r-NMeLeuSHK-G-Oic-pIPhe-P-DBip-OH (17), a 
potent APJ agonist with high plasma protein binding and a half-life suitable for 
once-daily subcutaneous dosing in rats. A correlation between subcutaneous 
absorption rate and lipid length/type of these conjugates is also reported.

DO-HEALTH is a multi-center clinical trial among 2157 community-dwelling 
European men and women age 70 and older. The 2x2x2 randomized-control factorial 
design trial tested the individual and additive benefit, as well as the 
cost-effectiveness, of 3 interventions: vitamin D 2000 IU/day, omega-3 fatty 
acids 1000 mg/day (EPA + DHA, ratio 1:2), and a 30-minute 3 times/week home 
exercise (strength versus flexibility). Each treatment tested has shown 
considerable prior promise from mechanistic studies, small clinical trials, or 
large cohort studies, in the prevention of common age-related chronic diseases, 
but definitive data are missing. DO-HEALTH will test these interventions in 
relation to 6 primary endpoints (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
non-vertebral fractures, Short Physical Performance Battery score, the Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment, and risk of infections), plus several secondary endpoints 
explored in ancillary studies (i.e. rate of any falls and injurious falls, joint 
pain, oral health, quality of life, and incident frailty). As the 3 
interventions have distinct mechanisms of action for each of the 6 primary 
endpoints, a maximum benefit is expected for their additive benefit as a 
"multi-modal" intervention. The trial duration is 3 years with in-person 
contacts with all participants at 4 clinical visits and by quarterly phone 
calls. Baseline and follow-up blood samples were collected in all participants 
to measure changes in 25-hydroxyvitamin D and poly-unsaturated fatty acid 
concentrations. Our objective was to test interventions that are expected to 
promote healthy aging and longer life expectancy and that can be easily and 
safely implemented by older community-dwelling adults.

This study assesses the occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in coastal and sea 
surface sediments, as well as water samples, collected from the coastal region 
of the southern Caspian Sea, Mazandaran province, Iran. A total of 32 sediment 
and 10 water samples were studied. The mean concentration of MPs was 15 units 
kg-1 in the sediments and 710 units m-3 in the coastal water. Fibers constituted 
by far the dominant MPs in both media, accounting for 97% of the MPs in both 
sediment and water samples. The MPs were mainly black in color. The dominant 
size of MP particles in sediment samples was between 250 and 500 μm, while the 
fraction >1000 μm dominated in the water samples. Polyethylene terephthalate 
(PET), polystyrene (PS), and nylon (NYL) were the main polymers and/or 
copolymers composing MPs in both sediment and water samples. The MP particles 
had a relatively smooth surface morphology, although signs of weathering were 
observed. The number of MP particles in sediment and water samples showed a 
general decrease from west to east in the study area. This may be reflecting the 
spreading of MP loading from the outlets of Sefidrud, Tonekabon, Chalus, the 
major rivers entering the Caspian Sea just west of the study area, and the 
overall decrease in the spatial distribution of touristic and fishery activity. 
The main sources of MP particles could be local emissions from a large number of 
domestic wastewater effluents and urban surface runoff due to high population 
density, and industrial and fishing activities in this region. This study 
indicated that MP particles, based on their characteristics and chemical 
composition, are circulated between coastal waters, and shore and sea surface 
sediments of the Caspian Sea, leading to their uneven distribution in the 
different depths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying 
the distribution of MP particles in sea surface sediments and also the most 
comprehensive on MPs in shoreline sediments and coastal waters in the southern 
Caspian Sea.

PURPOSE: To investigate local control and survival after bronchial artery 
embolization (BAE) using N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) for pulmonary hilar or 
mediastinal tumors that are refractory to chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.
METHOD: This is a single center retrospective study involving 42 patients 
treated between 2015 and 2018 for pulmonary hilar or mediastinal tumors (primary 
tumors in 5 and metastatic ones in 37). Tumor histology was sarcoma in 22 and 
carcinoma in 20 patients. All patients had shown tumor progression regardless of 
previous chemotherapy (n = 37) or chemoradiotherapy (n = 5). Thirty-seven 
patients (88 %) had respiratory symptoms, such as cough, dyspnea, and 
hemoptysis. BAE was performed using NBCA to shrink tumors for extending life
