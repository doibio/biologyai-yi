Therapy", "Hyperthermia, Induced", "Cryotherapy", "Vibration therapy", "Whole 
Body Vibration", "Physical Therapy Modalities". We found preclinical and 
clinical data on transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), 
extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), low-intensity pulsed ultrasound 
(LIPUS), pulsed electromagnetic fields stimulation (PEMF), and whole-body 
vibration (WBV) for the treatment of knee EOA. We found two clinical studies 
about TENS and PEMF and six preclinical studies-three about ESWT, one about WBV, 
one about PEMF, and one about LIPUS. The preclinical studies demonstrated 
several biological effects on EOA of physical modalities, suggesting potential 
disease-modifying effects. However, this role should be better investigated in 
further clinical studies, considering the limited data on the use of these 
interventions for EOA patients.

Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are aggressive diseases 
characterized by clonal proliferation of myeloid stem cells. The clonal process 
leads to excessive red cells production, platelets production, and bone marrow 
fibrosis. According to the phenotype, MPN can be classified as polycythemia vera 
(PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). MPN 
patients have shortened survival due to the increased risk of thrombosis, 
hemorrhages, and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Prognosis is 
variable, with a shorter life expectancy in myelofibrosis. Currently, drug 
therapy can reduce symptoms, splenomegaly, and risk of thrombosis. Still, some 
patients can be resistant or intolerant to the treatment. At the same time, 
allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) is the only treatment modality with the 
potential to cure the disease. Nevertheless, the ASCT is reserved for high-risk 
leukemic progression patients due to the risk of treatment-related death and 
comorbidity. Therefore, there is a need for new drugs that can eradicate clonal 
hematopoiesis and prevent progression to more aggressive myeloid neoplasms. 
Thanks to the better understanding of the disease's molecular pathogenesis, many 
new potentially disease-modifying drugs have been developed and are currently in 
clinical trials. This review explores the most promising new drugs currently in 
clinical trials.

During the last decade, the research on Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) 
has improved exponentially in real-life scenarios to provide optimized transport 
network performance. It is a matter of importance that alert messages are 
delivered promptly to prevent vehicular traffic problems. The fact is an ITS 
system per se could be a part of a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) which is an 
extension of a wireless network. In all sorts of wireless ad hoc networks, the 
network topology is subjected to change due to the mobility of network nodes; 
therefore, an existing explored route between two nodes could be demolished in a 
minor fraction of time. When it comes to the VANETs, the topology likely changes 
due to the high velocity of nodes. On the other hand, time is a crucial factor 
playing an important role in message handling between the network's nodes. In 
this paper, we propose Time delay-based Multipath Routing (TMR) protocol that 
effectively identifies an optimized path for packet delivery to the destination 
vehicle with a minimal time delay. Our algorithm gives a higher priority to 
alert messages compared to normal messages. It also selects the routes with the 
short round-trip time (RTT) within the RTT threshold. As a result, our algorithm 
would realize two goals. Firstly, it would speed up the data transmission rate 
and deliver data packets, particularly warning messages, to the destination 
vehicle promptly and therefore avoid vehicular problems such as car accidents. 
Secondly, the TMR algorithm reduces the data traffic load, particularly of the 
normal messages, to alleviate the pressure on the network and therefore avoids 
network congestion and data collisions. This, in turn, lessens the packets' 
retransmissions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol, the 
TMR has been compared with the other protocols such as AOMDV, FF-AOMDV, EGSR, 
QMR, and ISR. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed protocol proves 
its excellent performance compared to other protocols.

(1) Background: Hip arthroplasty (HA) is a surgery that replaces the damaged hip 
joint with an artificial implant called a hip prosthesis. The increase in life 
expectancy correlated with the population aging level, to which the increase in 
the number of prosthetic interventions among the young population is added, 
translates to the imperative need to analyze the quality of life beyond the 
immediate postoperative period. Strict adherence to an individualized 
rehabilitation program (IRP), and adapted to each patient, is followed by an 
improved quality of life. The main goal is the recovery of the patient with HA. 
This study was aimed to demonstrate that an IRP, represented by physical therapy 
associated with occupational therapy, improves the quality of life of patients 
with HA; (2) Methods: In this study, conducted between 2019 and 2021, 50 
patients with HA were divided into two groups: study group-group A (25 subjects 
compliant with the IRP) and control group-group B (25 subjects, non-compliance 
with the IRP). To evaluate the two study groups, we monitored the evolution of 
the modified Harris hip score (mHHS) in both hips (arthroplasty hip (AH), contra 
lateral hip (CH)), for four months, respectively 30 days before the surgery (T0) 
and at 90 days after the surgery (T1); (3) Results: We notice significant 
differences in mHHS values at 90 days-T1 after surgery, both on AH in favor of 
subjects from group A vs. group B (p = 0.030) and on CH, where mHHS values were 
statistically higher in group A compared to group B (p < 0.001). The results of 
our study outline at T1 moment, both on the AH (p = 0.030) and on the CH (p < 
0.001), the fact that mHHS values were statistically higher in patients included 
in group A compared to group B. In terms of the results for mHHS, comparing AH 
with CH, it is noted that the number of subjects who had a good or excellent 
mHHS result in group A versus group B is statistically significant in the case 
of CH (group A: 23 (92%) vs. group B: 11 (44%), p = 0.039); (4) Conclusions: The 
study reveals clear advantages of HA in both hips, both in subjects who complied 
with the IRP and those who did not comply; the higher therapeutic benefits of 
IRP are outlined at the level of CH compared to AH; in patients who comply with 
the IRP, the mHHS parameters that have improved in both CH and AH are pain, 
leaning, and shoes and socks activities; in addition, limping was reduced in CH.

Postharvest losses are a key stumbling block to long-term postharvest storage of 
potato tubers. Due to the high costs and lack of infrastructure associated with 
cold storage, this storage method is often not the most viable option. Hence, 
sprout suppressants are an appealing option. In most developing countries, 
potato tubers in postharvest storage are accompanied by a rapid decline in the 
potato tuber quality due to the physiological process of sprouting. It results 
in weight changes, increased respiration, and decreased nutritional quality. 
Therefore, proper management of sprouting is critical in potato storage. To 
avoid tuber sprouting, increased storage and transportation of potatoes demands 
either the retention of their dormant state or the application of sprout growth 
suppressants. This review evaluates the current understanding of the efficacy of 
different sprout suppressants on potato storability and the extension of potato 
shelf-life. We also consider the implications of varied study parameters, i.e., 
cultivar, temperature, and method of application, on the outcomes of sprout 
suppressant efficacies and how these limit the integration of efficient sprout 
suppression protocols.

A Scoping Review to Find Out Worldwide COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy and Its 
Underlying Determinants.

BACKGROUND: The current crisis created by the coronavirus pandemic is impacting 
all facets of life. Coronavirus vaccines have been developed to prevent 
coronavirus infection and fight the pandemic. Since vaccines might be the only 
way to prevent and stop the spread of coronavirus. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) has already approved several vaccines, and many countries have started 
vaccinating people. Misperceptions about vaccines persist despite the evidence 
of vaccine safety and efficacy.
OBJECTIVES: To explore the scientific literature and find the determinants for 
worldwide COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy as reported in the literature.
METHODS: PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines were 
followed to conduct a scoping review of literature on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy 
and willingness to vaccinate. Several databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, and 
Google Scholar) were searched to find relevant articles. Intervention- (i.e., 
COVID-19 vaccine) and outcome- (i.e., hesitancy) related terms were used to 
search in these databases. The search was conducted on 22 February 2021. Both 
forward and backward reference lists were checked to find further studies. Three 
reviewers worked independently to select articles and extract data from selected 
literature. Studies that used a quantitative survey to measure COVID-19 vaccine 
hesitancy and acceptance were included in this review. The extracted data were 
synthesized following the narrative approach and results were represented 
graphically with appropriate figures and tables.
RESULTS: 82 studies were included in this scoping review of 882 identified from 
our search. Sometimes, several studies had been performed in the same country, 
and it was observed that vaccine hesitancy was high earlier and decreased over 
time with the hope of vaccine efficacy. People in different countries had 
varying percentages of vaccine uptake (28-86.1%), vaccine hesitancy (10-57.8%), 
vaccine refusal (0-24%). The most common determinants affecting vaccination 
intention include vaccine efficacy, vaccine side effects, mistrust in 
healthcare, religious beliefs, and trust in information sources. Additionally, 
vaccination intentions are influenced by demographic factors such as age, 
gender, education, and region.
CONCLUSIONS: The underlying factors of vaccine hesitancy are complex and 
context-specific, varying across time and socio-demographic variables. Vaccine 
hesitancy can also be influenced by other factors such as health inequalities, 
socioeconomic disadvantages, systemic racism, and level of exposure to 
misinformation online, with some factors being more dominant in certain 
countries than others. Therefore, strategies tailored to cultures and 
socio-psychological factors need to be developed to reduce vaccine hesitancy and 
aid informed decision-making.

Physics, 077125 Magurele, Romania.

This review summarizes the results reported on the production of biphasic 
calcium phosphate (BCP) materials derived from fish wastes (i.e., heads, bones, 
skins, and viscera), known as fish discards, and offers an in-depth discussion 
on their promising potential for various applications in many fields, especially 
the biomedical one. Thus, considerable scientific and technological efforts were 
recently focused on the capability of these sustainable materials to be 
transformed into economically attractive and highly valuable by-products. As a 
consequence of using these wastes, plenty of beneficial social effects, with 
both economic and environmental impact, will arise. In the biomedical field, 
there is a strong and continuous interest for the development of innovative 
solutions for healthcare improvement using alternative materials of biogenic 
origin. Thus, the orthopedic field has witnessed a significant development due 
to an increased demand for a large variety of implants, grafts, and/or 
scaffolds. This is mainly due to the increase of life expectancy and higher 
frequency of bone-associated injuries and diseases. As a consequence, the domain 
of bone-tissue engineering has expanded to be able to address a plethora of 
bone-related traumas and to deliver a viable and efficient substitute to 
allografts or autografts by combining bioactive materials and cells for 
bone-tissue ingrowth. Among biomaterials, calcium phosphate (CaP)-based 
bio-ceramics are widely used in medicine, in particular in orthopedics and 
dentistry, due to their excellent bioactive, osteoconductive, and 
osteointegrative characteristics. Recently, BCP materials (synthetic or 
natural), a class of CaP, which consist of a mixture of two phases, 
hydroxyapatite (HA) and beta tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), in different 
concentrations, gained increased attention due to their superior overall 
performances as compared to single-phase formulations. Moreover, the 
exploitation of BCP materials from by-products of fish industry was reported to 
be a safe, cheap, and simple procedure. In the dedicated literature, there are 
many reviews on synthetic HA, β-TCP, or BCP materials, but to the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first collection of results on the effects of processing 
conditions on the morphological, compositional, structural, mechanical, and 
biological properties of the fish discard-derived BCPs along with the tailoring 
of their features for various applications.

Diabetes is a metabolic syndrome characterized by inadequate blood glucose 
control and is associated with reduced quality of life and various 
complications, significantly shortening life expectancy. Natural phytochemicals 
found in plants have been traditionally used as medicines for the prevention of 
chronic diseases including diabetes in East Asia since ancient times. Many of 
these phytochemicals have been characterized as having few side effects, and 
scientific research into the mechanisms of action responsible has accumulated 
mounting evidence for their efficacy. These compounds, which may help to prevent 
metabolic syndrome disorders including diabetes, act through relevant 
intracellular signaling pathways. In this review, we examine the anti-diabetic 
efficacy of several compounds and extracts derived from medicinal plants, with a 
focus on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity.

INTRODUCTION: The need to develop and evaluate interventions, addressing 
problems performing activities of daily living (ADL) among persons with chronic 
conditions, is evident. Guided by the British Medical Research Council's 
guidance on how to develop and evaluate complex interventions, the occupational 
therapy programme (A Better everyday LifE (ABLE)) was developed and feasibility 
tested. The aim of this protocol is to report the planned design and methods for 
evaluating effectiveness, process and cost-effectiveness of the programme.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The evaluation is designed as a randomised controlled 
trial with blinded assessors and investigators. Eighty participants with chronic 
conditions and ADL problems are randomly allocated to ABLE or usual occupational 
therapy. Data for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evaluations are collected 
at baseline (week 0), post intervention (week 10) and follow-up (week 26). 
Coprimary outcomes are self-reported ADL ability (ADL-Interview (ADL-I) 
performance) and observed ADL motor ability (Assessment of Motor and Process 
Skills (AMPS)). Secondary outcomes are perceived satisfaction with ADL ability 
(ADL-I satisfaction); and observed ADL process ability (AMPS). Explorative 
outcomes are occupational balance (Occupational Balance Questionnaire); 
perceived change (Client-Weighted Problems Questionnaire) and general health 
(first question of the MOS 36-item Short Form Survey Instrument). The process 
evaluation is based on quantitative data from registration forms and qualitative 
interview data, collected during and after the intervention period. A realist 
evaluation approach is applied. A programme theory expresses how context (C) and 
mechanisms (M) in the programme may lead to certain outcomes (O), in so-called 
CMO configurations. Outcomes in the cost-effectiveness evaluation are 
quality-adjusted life years (EuroQool 5-dimension) and changes in ADL ability 
(AMPS, ADL-I). Costs are estimated from microcosting and national registers.

BACKGROUND: Low-dose oral azithromycin therapy is recommended as a preventive 
treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD. However, the overall benefit-harm 
balance of this treatment has not been well studied.
METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model of COPD was created to simulate the course 
of COPD over 20 years. The model was populated with evidence from the literature 
and dedicated data analysis. The benefit of azithromycin was modelled as a 
reduction in exacerbation rates. Adverse events, including cardiovascular 
events, hearing loss, gastrointestinal symptoms and antimicrobial resistance 
(leading to a gradual decline in the effectiveness of azithromycin), were 
considered. All outcomes were assigned a health-related utility weight to 
estimate the overall net change in the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
associated with the use of azithromycin.
RESULTS: In patients with a positive exacerbation history, azithromycin resulted 
in a net QALY gain of 17.9 per 100 patients (99.8% probability of expected QALY 
gain) over 20 years. The net benefit increased to 21.8 QALYs per 100 patients 
(99.9% probability of expected QALY gain) among the 'frequent exacerbator' 
subgroup. Azithromycin was not net beneficial among those without any 
moderate/severe exacerbations in the previous year. Findings were robust against 
series of sensitivity, scenario and threshold analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term therapy with azithromycin confers a net benefit to 
ex-smoker patients with COPD with a recent history of exacerbations and an even 
larger benefit to those who are frequent exacerbators.

The dynamics of disease prevalence and healthcare systems continue to change 
dramatically in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This is a result of 
multiple factors including the demands of an ageing population in the context of 
increasing life expectancy and the rise of non-communicable diseases putting an 
additional burden on an already weak healthcare system. Further healthcare 
deficiency is attributable to additional factors such as low financial budgets, 
political conflicts and civil war, as well as continuing burden of communicable 
diseases, which are known to be the major risk to health in LMICs. Surgical 
needs largely remain unmet despite a Lancet report published in 2015. Various 
deficient aspects of healthcare systems need to be addressed immediately to 
provide any hope of creating a sustainable healthcare environment in the coming 
decades. These include developing strong primary and secondary care structures 
as well as strengthening tertiary care hospitals with an adequately trained 
healthcare workforce. The facilities required to improve patients' access to 
healthcare cannot be developed and sustained solely within the local budget 
allocation and require major input from international organizations such as the 
World Bank and the World Health Organization as well as a chain of donor 
networks. To create and retain a local healthcare workforce, improved training 
and living conditions and greater financial security need to be provided. 
Finally, healthcare economics need to be addressed with financial models that 
can provide insurance and security to the underprivileged population to achieve 
universal health coverage, which remains the goal of several global 
organizations promoting equity in high-standard healthcare provision.

OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic cancer is portrayed to become the second leading cause of 
cancer-related death within the next years. Potentially complicating surgical 
resection emphasizes the importance of an accurate TNM classification. In 
particular, the failure to detect features for non-resectability has profound 
consequences on patient outcomes and economic costs due to incorrect indication 
for resection. In the detection of liver metastases, contrast-enhanced MRI 
showed high sensitivity and specificity; however, the cost-effectiveness 
compared to the standard of care imaging remains unclear. The aim of this study 
was to analyze whether additional MRI of the liver is a cost-effective approach 
compared to routinely acquired contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) in 
the initial staging of pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: A decision model based on Markov simulation was developed to estimate 
the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and lifetime costs of the diagnostic 
modalities. Model input parameters were assessed based on evidence from recent 
literature. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) was set to $100,000/QALY. To evaluate 
model uncertainty, deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the model yielded a total cost of $185,597 
and an effectiveness of 2.347 QALYs for CE-MR/CT and $187,601 and 2.337 QALYs 
for CE-CT respectively. With a net monetary benefit (NMB) of $49,133, CE-MR/CT 
is shown to be dominant over CE-CT with a NMB of $46,117. Deterministic and 
probabilistic survival analysis showed model robustness for varying input 
parameters.
CONCLUSION: Based on our results, combined CE-MR/CT can be regarded as a 
cost-effective imaging strategy for the staging of pancreatic cancer.
KEY POINTS: • Additional MRI of the liver for initial staging of pancreatic 
cancer results in lower total costs and higher effectiveness. • The economic 
model showed high robustness for varying input parameters.

Whole-genome duplication (WGD), or polyploidy, increases the amount of genetic 
information in the cell. WGDs of whole organisms are found in all branches of 
eukaryotes and act as a driving force of speciation, complication, and 
adaptations. Somatic-cell WGDs are observed in all types of tissues and can 
result from normal or altered ontogenetic programs, regeneration, pathological 
conditions, aging, malignancy, and metastasis. Despite the versatility of WGDs, 
their functional significance, general properties, and causes of their higher 
adaptive potential are unclear. Comparisons of whole-transcriptome data and 
information from various fields of molecular biology, genomics, and molecular 
medicine showed several common features for polyploidy of organisms and somatic 
and cancer cells, making it possible to understand what WGD properties lead to 
the emergence of an adaptive phenotype. The adaptation potential of WGDs may be 
associated with an increase in the complexity of the regulation of networks and 
signaling systems; a higher resistance to stress; and activation of ancient 
evolutionary programs of unicellularity and pathways of morphogenesis, survival, 
and life extension. A balance between the cell and organismal levels in 
controlling gene regulation may shift in stress towards the priority of cell 
survival, and the shift can lead to cardiovascular diseases and carcinogenesis. 
The presented information helps to understand how polyploidy creates new 
phenotypes and why it acts as a driving force of evolution and an important 
regulator of biological processes in somatic cells during ontogeny, 
pathogenesis, regeneration, and transformation.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the temporal trend of the disease burden of stroke and 
its attributable risk factors in China, especially at provincial levels, is 
important for effective prevention strategies and improvement. The aim of this 
analysis from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) is to investigate the disease burden of stroke and its risk factors at 
national and provincial levels in China from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Following the methodology in the GBD 2019, the incidence, prevalence, 
mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of stroke cases in the 
Chinese population were estimated by sex, age, year, stroke subtypes (ischaemic 
stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage), and across 33 
provincial administrative units in China from 1990 to 2019. Attributable 
mortality and DALYs of underlying risk factors were calculated by a comparative 
risk assessment.
FINDINGS: In 2019, there were 3·94 million (95% uncertainty interval 3·43-4·58) 
new stroke cases in China. The incidence rate of stroke increased by 86·0% 
(73·2-99·0) from 1990, reaching 276·7 (241·3-322·0) per 100 000 population in 
2019. The age-standardised incidence rate declined by 9·3% (3·3-15·5) from 1990 
to 2019. Among 28·76 million (25·60-32·21) prevalent cases of stroke in 2019, 
24·18 million (20·80-27·87) were ischaemic stroke, 4·36 million (3·69-5·05) were 
intracerebral haemorrhage, and 1·58 million (1·32-1·91) were subarachnoid 
haemorrhage. The prevalence rate increased by 106·0% (93·7-118·8) and 
age-standardised prevalence rate increased by 13·2% (7·7-19·1) from 1990 to 
2019. In 2019, there were 2·19 million (1·89-2·51) deaths and 45·9 million 
(39·8-52·3) DALYs due to stroke. The mortality rate increased by 32·3% 
(8·6-59·0) from 1990 to 2019. Over the same period, the age-standardised 
mortality rate decreased by 39·8% (28·6-50·7) and the DALY rate decreased by 
41·6% (30·7-50·9). High systolic blood pressure, ambient particulate matter 
pollution exposure, smoking, and diet high in sodium were four major risk 
factors for stroke burden in 2019. Moreover, we found marked differences of 
stroke burden and attributable risk factors across provinces in China from 1990 
to 2019.
INTERPRETATION: The disease burden of stroke is still severe in China, although 
the age-standardised incidence and mortality rates have decreased since 1990. 
The stroke burden in China might be reduced through blood pressure management, 
lifestyle interventions, and air pollution control. Moreover, because 
substantial heterogeneity of stroke burden existed in different provinces, 
improved health care is needed in provinces with heavy stroke burden.

BACKGROUND: Falls in older people have become a major public health concern 
worldwide, but a comprehensive assessment of the burden of falls for older 
people in mainland China has not been done. We aimed to investigate the burden 
of falls among older people at the national and subnational level in mainland 
China, and explore the trends from 1990 to 2019, using data from the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019.
METHOD: Using data from GBD 2019, we estimated the burden of falls among people 
aged 60 years and older by sex and age group in terms of incidence, mortality, 
and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) rates and assessed these indicators at 
the subnational level in 31 geographical units (hereafter called provinces). We 
investigated the overall trend in the burden of falls across these 31 provinces 
from 1990 to 2019, and assessed the change in the burden of falls by sex, age 
group (60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, and ≥80 years), and province between 1990 and 
2019.
FINDINGS: In 2019, in mainland China, the incidence rate of falls among people 
aged 60 years and older was 3799·4 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3062·4-4645·0) 
new falls per 100 000 population, and 39·2 deaths (21·8-48·8) per 100 000 
population and 1238·9 DALYs (920·5-1553·2) per 100 000 population were due to 
falls. We found no significant difference in the burden of falls between males 
and females. The incidence, mortality, and DALY rates of falls for people aged 
80 years and older were significantly higher than those in the other age groups, 
except for incidence rate, which was non-significantly different between the age 
75-79 years group and the oldest age group. Large variations in the incidence 
and DALY rates of falls were observed across 31 provinces. Although between 1990 
and 2019 we found no significant changes in overall mortality due to falls in 
all provinces and in DALY rates for 23 provinces (DALY rates significantly 
decreased in two provinces and increased in six provinces), we found large 
increases in the incidence rate of falls in both males (percentage change 
between 1990 and 2019: 82·9% [67·4-100]) and females (77·0% [63·3-91·8]). The 
percentage change in incidence rate of falls between 1990 and 2019 varied from 
50·0% (42·2-59·5) for people aged 60-64 years to 123·8% (105·4-141·9) for people 
aged 80 years and older. All provinces had significant increases in the 
incidence rate of falls between 1990 and 2019, with Sichuan having the greatest 
increase (148·5% [125·5-171·4]) and Jilin the smallest increase (14·7% 
[3·6-26·1]).
INTERPRETATION: Between 1990 and 2019, the incidence rate of falls increased 
substantially in older adults across mainland China, whereas the rates of 
mortality and DALY of falls among older people remained relatively stable, 
suggesting improvements in outcomes of falls. Nevertheless, falls remain an 
ongoing health burden for older people in mainland China, and there is an urgent 
need to introduce system-wide, integrated, and cost-effective measures to 
protect and support older people to minimise their risks and combat an 
increasing absolute burden as the population continues ageing.

The main objective of oral and maxillofacial (OMF) tumor resection is to get 
local control of the disease. Many OMF tumors can be cured with wide or radical 
surgery, whereas others might only achieve temporary local control of the 
disease by removing infection and the source of pain, thereby improving the 
quality of life of the patient while keeping masticatory function. The standard 
of care on managing OMF tumors includes the diagnosis and identification of the 
local and distant extension of the disease to establish an appropriate treatment 
plan tailored for each patient. In this article, we provide a practical review 
of the current information related to staging, biopsy, and main surgical 
techniques for OMF tumor removal.

OBJECTIVES: Incomplete reporting of key information on patient-reported outcomes 
(PROs) in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in oncology has been highlighted 
repeatedly as a major barrier to the use of study findings in clinical practice. 
We investigated whether the quality of reporting of PRO data in cancer RCTs has 
improved over the last 15 years.
METHODS: We identified all cancer RCTs with PRO endpoints conducted across the 
most prevalent solid tumor types worldwide published between 2004 and 2019. The 
quality of PRO reporting was assessed using the International Society for 
Quality of Life Research recommended standards, which include important aspects 
related to assessment methodology, statistical analyses, and interpretation of 
data.
RESULTS: We assessed a total of 631 cancer RCTs in breast (n = 187), lung (n = 
131), prostate (n = 120), colorectal (n = 107), and gynecological (n = 86) 
cancer. We observed a higher adherence to the International Society for Quality 
of Life Research reporting criteria in the more recently published studies. In a 
multivariable linear regression analysis, we observed a statistically 
significant improvement in the quality of PRO reporting over time (P<.001), and 
this relationship was independent of other measured confounding factors, such as 
sample size and study sponsorship. Overall, the quality of PRO reporting was 
higher for studies published after the publication of the Consolidated Standards 
of Reporting Trials-PRO Extension.
CONCLUSIONS: The quality of PRO reporting in cancer RCTs published in the last 
15 years has improved significantly. Our findings are encouraging because better 
reporting of PRO results may translate into a greater impact of study findings 
on real-world practice.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the lifetime health and economic outcomes of selecting 
active surveillance (AS), radical prostatectomy (RP), or radiation therapy (RT) 
as initial management for low- or favorable-risk localized prostate cancer.
METHODS: A discrete-event simulation model was developed using evidence from 
published randomized trials. Health outcomes were measured in life-years and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were included from a public payer 
perspective in Australian dollars. Outcomes were discounted at 5% over a 
lifetime horizon. Probabilistic and scenario analyses quantified parameter and 
structural uncertainty.
RESULTS: A total of 60% of patients in the AS arm eventually received radical 
treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) compared with 90% for RP and 91% for RT. 
Although AS resulted in fewer treatment-related complications, it led to 
increased clinical progression (AS 40.7%, RP 17.6%, RT 19.9%) and metastatic 
disease (AS 13.4%, RP 6.1%, RT 7.0%). QALYs were 10.88 for AS, 11.10 for RP, and 
11.13 for RT. Total costs were A$17 912 for AS, A$15 609 for RP, and A$15 118 
for RT. At a willingness to pay of A$20 000/QALY, RT had a 61.4% chance of being 
cost-effective compared to 38.5% for RP and 0.1% for AS.
CONCLUSIONS: Although AS resulted in fewer and delayed treatment-related 
complications, it was not found to be a cost-effective strategy for 
favorable-risk localized prostate cancer over a lifetime horizon because of an 
increase in the number of patients developing metastatic disease. RT was the 
dominant strategy yielding higher QALYs at lower cost although differences 
compared with RP were small.

OBJECTIVE: Early and accurate diagnosis of hip fractures minimizes morbidity and 
mortality. Although current guidelines favor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
for the diagnosis of occult hip fractures, a new technology called dual-energy 
computed tomography (DECT) seems an effective alternative. This article 
investigates a potentially cost-effective strategy for the diagnosis of occult 
hip fractures in older adults in Singapore.
METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to compare costs from a payer's 
perspective and outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 
different imaging strategies for diagnosing occult hip fracture, comparing MRI 
with DECT supplementing single-energy computed tomography (SECT) and SECT alone. 
Model inputs were obtained from local sources where available. Sensitivity 
analyses are performed to test the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: The MRI strategy was dominated by the DECT strategy, whereas DECT 
supplementing SECT provided 0.30 more QALYs at an incremental cost of SGD106.41 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of SGD352.52 per QALY relative to 
SECT alone. DECT seemed a cost-effective strategy at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of SGD50 000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: DECT supplementing SECT is a cost-effective imaging strategy to 
diagnose occult hip fractures among older adults in Singapore and should be 
included in clinical pathways to expedite timely treatment and considered for 
reimbursement schemes.
