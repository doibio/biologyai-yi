In patients with type 2 diabetes, tight glycemic control prevents or delays the 
develop-ment of microvascular complications. In contrast, there is continued 
debate on the effect of macrovascular complications and the role of early 
glycaemic control on the ensuing cardiovascular disease. Although large 
randomised clinical trials have not shown a clearly beneficial effect of 
intensive control in the short term, subsequent follow-up studies of 
participants in these trials suggest a favourable cardiovascular effect in the 
long term. Due to doubts about the increased risk of myocardial infarction with 
rosiglitazone, for the last few years regulatory agencies have required sponsors 
to demonstrate the cardiovascular safety of new drugs before they can be 
approved for the treatment of hyperglycae-mia. The cardiovascular safety trials 
published to date have shown that the new drugs do not increase cardiovascular 
risk and that some molecules may even provide some cardiovascular protection. 
These findings raise the following question: what is the priority when selecting 
lipid-low-ering drugs - metabolic control or reduced cardiovascular risk? The 
answer lies in the word individualisation. Treatment cannot focus solely on 
cardiovascular safety, without considering microvascular complications, which 
cause high morbidity and mortality. Patients with recent onset diabetes and long 
life expectancy will benefit from tight meta-bolic control. Patients with 
diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or at high risk are candidates 
for treatment that includes drugs with a demonstrated benefit in this pa-tient 
group.

Due to the increasing life expectancy, the diagnosis of malignancy and treatment 
of elderly patients is becoming more common. Prostate cancer is particularly 
frequent in this setting. Many different approaches are now available, but some 
of them imply significant risks or collateral effects. In those patients an 
accurate evaluation of risk-to-benefit ratio is needed, and functional imaging 
such as PET/CT is important for the clinician to make the appropriate choice. 
PET/CT in prostate cancer is a well-tolerated procedure that can be used to 
accurately assess the tumor extent during the entire clinical history of the 
disease. Nowadays there are several available radiopharmaceuticals for prostate 
cancer PET/CT imaging, each one with specific advantages and disadvantages. The 
two most promising and more widely employed in the clinical setting are 
18F-Flucyclovine and 68Ga-PSMA. This paper will provide an overview of these two 
tracers for imaging prostate cancer in elderly patients.

Whilst anterior cruciate ligament injury commonly occurs during change of 
direction (CoD) tasks, there is little research on how athletes execute CoD 
after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The aims of this study 
were to determine between-limb and between-test differences in performance 
(time) and joint kinematics and kinetics during planned and unplanned CoD. One 
hundred and fifty-six male subjects carried out 90° maximal effort, planned and 
unplanned CoD tests in a 3D motion capture laboratory 9 months after ACLR. 
Statistical parametric mapping (2 × 2 ANOVA; limb × test) was used to identify 
differences in CoD time and biomechanical measures between limbs and between 
tests. There was no interaction effect but a main effect for limb and task. 
There was no between-limb difference in the time to complete both CoD tests. 
Between-limb differences were found for internal knee valgus moment, knee 
internal rotation and flexion angle, knee extension and external rotation moment 
and ankle external rotation moment with lower values on the ACLR side (effect 
size 0.72-0.5). Between test differences were found with less contralateral 
pelvis rotation, distance from centre of mass to the ankle in frontal plane, 
posterior ground reaction force and greater hip abduction during the unplanned 
CoD (effect size 0.75-0.5). Findings demonstrated that kinematic and kinetic 
differences between limbs are evident during both CoD tests 9 months after 
surgery, despite no statistical differences in performance time. Biomechanical 
differences between tests were found in variables, which have previously been 
associated with ACL injury mechanism during unplanned CoD.

The morphogenetic remodelling of embryo architecture after implantation 
culminates in pro-amniotic cavity formation. Despite its key importance, how 
this transformation occurs remains unknown. Here, we apply high-resolution 
imaging of embryos developing in vivo and in vitro, spatial RNA sequencing and 
3D trophoblast stem cell models to determine the sequence and mechanisms of 
these remodelling events. We show that cavitation of the embryonic tissue is 
followed by folding of extra-embryonic tissue to mediate the formation of a 
second extra-embryonic cavity. Concomitantly, at the boundary between embryonic 
and extra-embryonic tissues, a hybrid 3D rosette forms. Resolution of this 
rosette enables the embryonic cavity to invade the extra-embryonic tissue. 
Subsequently, β1-integrin signalling mediates the formation of multiple 
extra-embryonic 3D rosettes. Podocalyxin exocytosis leads to their polarized 
resolution, permitting the extension of embryonic and extra-embryonic cavities 
and their fusion into a unified pro-amniotic cavity. These morphogenetic 
transformations of embryogenesis reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism for 
lumen expansion and fusion.

Gastric and esopahgeal cancers account for the six most common causes of cancer 
death worldwide. Locally advanced resectable cancers have a 5-year life 
expectancy of 30%. Despite use of chemotherapy, median overall survival for 
stage IV cancer rarely exceeds 1 year. A subset of gastric cancers such as 
microsatellite-instable tumor and Epstein-Barr virus-positive tumors have a rich 
immune infiltrate that makes them more responsive to immune-directed therapies. 
Tumors can evade T-cell-mediated "immune surveillance" by activating the 
programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
pathway. Targeting PD-1 and thus de-engaging them from its ligands can help 
restore immunogenicity. Pembrolizumab is the first immunotherapy to be approved 
by US FDA for PD-L1 expressing gastric and gastroesopahgeal junction (GEJ) 
cancers after they have progressed on at least two prior lines of treatment. 
While PD-L1 positivity does not define tumor's responsiveness to pembrolizumab, 
PD-L1-positive tumors have better overall response rates. The treatment is 
usually well tolerated and has a favorable adverse events profile. The exact 
setting for use of pembrolizumab remains to be determined. Pembrolizumab failed 
to improve overall survival when administered as second-line treatment for 
advanced, metastatic gastric and GEJ cancers. There are several ongoing studies 
with various combinations and different settings not only with pembrolizumab but 
also with other checkpoint inhibitors.

For a long time, studies of socioeconomic gradients in health have limited their 
attention to between-group comparisons. Yet, ignoring the differences that might 
exist within groups and focusing on group-specific life expectancy levels and 
trends alone, one might arrive at overly simplistic conclusions. Using data from 
the Spanish Encuesta Sociodemográfica and recently released mortality files by 
the Spanish Statistical Office (INE), this is the first study to simultaneously 
document (1) the gradient in life expectancy by educational attainment groups, 
and (2) the inequality in age-at-death distributions within and across those 
groups for the period between 1960 and 2015 in Spain. Our findings suggest that 
life expectancy has been increasing for all education groups but particularly 
among the highly educated. We observe diverging trends in life expectancy, with 
the differences between the low- and highly educated becoming increasingly 
large, particularly among men. Concomitantly with increasing disparities across 
groups, length-of-life inequality has decreased for the population as a whole 
and for most education groups, and the contribution of the between-group 
component of inequality to overall inequality has been extremely small. Even if 
between-group inequality has increased over time, its contribution has been too 
small to have sizable effects on overall inequality. In addition, our results 
suggest that education expansion and declining within-group variability might 
have been the main drivers of overall lifespan inequality reductions. 
Nevertheless, the diverging trends in longevity and lifespan inequality across 
education groups represent an important phenomenon whose underlying causes and 
potential implications should be investigated in detail.

Grade IV gliomas, also known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are incurable, 
lethal brain tumors, whose average life expectancy is around 15 months. There is 
a desperate need for a better understanding of the basic biology of these 
tumors, in order to devise novel, more specific and effective therapeutics. The 
handling of GBM represents a daunting challenge to clinicians, also considering 
the few therapeutic options available, none of which can significantly alter the 
inevitable lethal outcome of these tumors. Hence, the development of effective 
therapies would greatly benefit from the availability of in vivo GBM models that 
can reliably mimic the characteristics of malignant cells and the features of 
the human disease. Candidate new drugs have to be tested in these in vivo models 
by adopting settings concerning direct intra-brain delivery in order to define 
their overall therapeutic efficacy under clinical-like conditions. Here, we 
describe local intracranial delivery of drugs by osmotic mini-pumps.

BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the cost-utility of telephone-based cognitive 
behavioral therapy (TB-CBT) (experimental arm) in comparison with a 
placebo-befriending (control arm) program in COPD participants with mild to 
severe depression and/or anxiety.
METHODS: The decision rule was based on willingness-to-pay if there is an 
increased unit of effectiveness (a quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gain) and 
an increase in cost, and willingness-to-accept (WTA) if there is a reduced unit 
of effectiveness (a QALY loss) and decrease in cost (a cost-saving).
RESULTS: TB-CBT group was associated with a reduction in the incremental cost of 
AUS-$407.3 (p < 0.001, SE:34.1) plus a negative, nonsignificant incremental QALY 
gain of -0.008 (SE:0.011) per patient compared to control group. The point 
estimate of the mean incremental cost-utility ratio was AUS$50,284.0 cost saving 
per QALY sacrificed (the high value associated with small QALY value in the 
denominator). Ninety-five percent CI was AUS$13,426 cost sacrificed to 
AUS$32,018 cost gain (lower values associated with larger QALY values in the 
denominator). If the societal's minimum (flooring threshold) WTA is AUS$64,000 
per QALY forgone, the probability of TB-CBT being cost-effective was 42% 
Conclusions: This study showed that TB-CBT can be recommended as a cost-saving 
and preventive approach over usual care plus befriending program.

Enhanced health care for patients with Down syndrome (DS) results in improved 
overall quality of life and longer life expectancy. The main gynecologic 
complaints of patients with DS and their caregivers relate to menstrual cycles, 
hygiene and reproductive issues. Certain aspects, such as age of menarche, 
menstrual cycles, internal genitalia, and hormone profile are similar to those 
observed in the general population. However, individuals with DS may have a 
higher incidence of other disorders related to menstruation, such as 
hypothyroidism, epilepsy and use of anticonvulsants. Contraceptive measures for 
individuals with DS can be used for both contraception and control of menstrual 
symptoms. The physician must be to make an individualized recommendation aimed 
at offering the most efficient and least invasive method with the fewest side 
effects. Among medical options are oral contraceptives, quarterly injectable 
medroxyprogesterone acetate, oral progesterone, a levonorgestrel-releasing 
intrauterine system, transdermal patch and vaginal rings. Surgical methods, 
including hysterectomy, endometrial ablation, or tubal ligation, are rarely 
considered because they raise ethical and legal questions. This article reviews 
the literature and basic guidelines to assist physicians who attend adolescent 
girls and women with DS to provide guidance on the appropriate management of the 
main gynecologic complaints of this population.

OBJECTIVES: To provide a comprehensive overview of economic evaluations of falls 
prevention programs and to evaluate the methodology and quality of these 
studies.
DESIGN: Systematic review of economic evaluations on falls prevention programs.
SETTING: Studies (N=31) of community-dwelling older adults (n=25), of older 
adults living in residential care facilities (n=3), and of both populations 
(n=3) published before May 2017.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 60 and older.
MEASUREMENTS: Information on study characteristics and health economics was 
collected. Study quality was appraised using the 20-item Consensus on Health 
Economic Criteria.
RESULTS: Economic evaluations of falls prevention through exercise (n = 9), home 
assessment (n = 6), medication adjustment (n = 4), multifactorial programs 
(n = 11), and various other programs (n = 13) were identified. Approximately 
two-thirds of all reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as outcome were below the willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $50,000 per QALY. All studies on home assessment and medication 
adjustment programs reported favorable ICERs, whereas the results of studies on 
exercise and multifactorial programs were inconsistent. The overall 
methodological quality of the studies was good, although there was variation 
between studies.
CONCLUSION: The majority of the reported ICERs indicated that falls prevention 
programs were cost-effective, but methodological differences between studies 
hampered direct comparison of the cost-effectiveness of program types. The 
results imply that investing in falls prevention programs for adults aged 60 and 
older is cost-effective. Home assessment programs (ICERs < $40,000/QALY) were 
the most cost-effective type of program for community-dwelling older adults, and 
medication adjustment programs (ICERs < $13,000/QALY) were the most 
cost-effective type of program for older adults living in a residential care 
facility. J Am Geriatr Soc 66:2197-2204, 2018.

BACKGROUND: A significant number of studies have compared graft outcomes between 
patients with Pre-emptive Kidney Transplantation (PreKT) and patients on 
Dialysis before their Kidney Transplantation (DiaKT). These studies have 
suffered from the limitation that the DiaKT group is composed of all the 
dialysed patients, including those placed on a waiting list at the time of their 
first dialysis session. This seriously questions the comparability of these 
patients with those placed on the waiting list a long time before the need for 
renal replacement therapy. The aim of this study was to precisely evaluate the 
causal effect of PreKT from deceased donors.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the multicentric French DIVAT (Données 
Informatisées et VAlidées en Transplantation) cohort. The DiaKT group was 
composed of patients placed on the waiting list with an initial intention of 
pre-emptive transplantation. Cause-specific Cox models with propensity scores 
(inverse probability weighting) were used to study the patient and graft 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Among the 1138 included patients, 554 patients were in the PreKT group. 
The outcomes of the PreKT group were similar compared with the DiaKT group. In 
particular, the life expectancy with a functioning graft was 8.51 years [95% 
confidence interval (CI) 8.20-8.81] for the PreKT recipients versus 8.49 years 
(95% CI 8.15-8.84) for the DiaKT recipients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results challenge the utility of PreKTs from deceased donors, 
especially with regard to the consequential increase in the waiting list.

BACKGROUND: Patients with non-resectable colorectal metastases are currently 
treated with chemotherapy. However, liver transplantation can increase the 
5-year survival rate from 9 to 56 per cent if the cancer is confined to the 
liver. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of liver 
transplantation for colorectal liver metastases.
METHODS: A Markov model with a lifetime perspective was developed to estimate 
the life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), direct healthcare costs and 
cost-effectiveness for patients with non-resectable colorectal liver metastases 
who received liver transplantation or chemotherapy alone.
RESULTS: In non-selected cohorts, liver transplantation increased patients' life 
expectancy by 3·12 life-years (2·47 QALYs), at an additional cost of €209 143, 
giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €67 140 per life-year 
(€84 667 per QALY) gained. In selected cohorts (selection based on tumour 
diameter, time since primary cancer, carcinoembryonic antigen levels and 
response to chemotherapy), the effect of liver transplantation increased to 4·23 
life-years (3·41 QALYs), at a higher additional cost (€230 282), and the ICER 
decreased to €54 467 per life-year (€67 509 per QALY) gained. Given a 
willingness to pay of €70 500, the likelihood of transplantation being 
cost-effective was 0·66 and 0·94 (0·23 and 0·67 QALYs) for non-selected and 
selected cohorts respectively.
CONCLUSION: Liver transplantation was cost-effective but only for highly 
selected patients. This might be possible in countries with good access to 
grafts and low waiting list mortality.

We created the INternational Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In Search 
for a CuRE (INSPPIRE 2) cohort to study the risk factors, natural history, and 
outcomes of pediatric acute recurrent pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis 
(CP). Patient and physician questionnaires collect information on demographics, 
clinical history, family and social history, and disease outcomes. 
Health-related quality of life, depression, and anxiety are measured using 
validated questionnaires. Information entered on paper questionnaires is 
transferred into a database managed by Consortium for the Study of Chronic 
Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer's Coordinating and Data Management 
Center. Biosamples are collected for DNA isolation and analysis of most common 
pancreatitis-associated genes.Twenty-two sites (18 in the United States, 2 in 
Canada, and 1 each in Israel and Australia) are participating in the INSPPIRE 2 
study. These sites have enrolled 211 subjects into the INSPPIRE 2 database 
toward our goal to recruit more than 800 patients in 2 years. The INSPPIRE 2 
cohort study is an extension of the INSPPIRE cohort study with a larger and more 
diverse patient population. Our goals have expanded to include evaluating risk 
factors for CP, its sequelae, and psychosocial factors associated with pediatric 
acute recurrent pancreatitis and CP.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiological stroke data of Brazil according to the 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study in 2016 and secondary data from the GBD 
database.
RESULTS: The highest percentage of deaths due to stroke in general occurred in 
individuals aged 70 years or over (60.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
59.9-60.5%) followed by that in men (52.9%; 95% CI 52.6-53.2%). Ischemic stroke 
was the most common type, accounting for 61.8% (95% CI 61.5-62.1%) of deaths due 
to stroke in 2016. Most of the epidemiological indicators (incidence, 
prevalence, mortality-to-incidence ratio, mortality, disability-adjusted life 
years, years lost due to disability, and years of life lost) of stroke in 
general or either type of stroke were higher in men and those aged 70 years or 
over. Stroke data in Brazil are a major concern and represent a real health 
challenge for the coming decades. Men and individuals aged 70 years or older 
appear to represent the groups with the highest epidemiological parameters and 
risk for the various stroke outcomes. However, this does not mean the female 
data are irrelevant, which, although representing a lower risk than the male 
data, also raise the need for policies aimed at prevention and improvement in 
the treatment of stroke and its sequelae.

Old-age mortality decline has driven recent increases in lifespans, but there is 
no agreement about trends in the age pattern of old-age deaths. Some argue that 
old-age deaths should become compressed at advanced ages, others argue that 
old-age deaths should become more dispersed with age, and yet others argue that 
old-age deaths are consistent with little change in dispersion. However, direct 
analysis of old-age deaths presents unusual challenges: Death rates at the 
oldest ages are always noisy, published life tables must assume an asymptotic 
age pattern of deaths, and the definition of "old-age" changes as lives 
lengthen. Here we use robust percentile-based methods to overcome some of these 
challenges and show, for five decades in 20 developed countries, that old-age 
survival follows an advancing front, like a traveling wave. The front lies 
between the 25th and 90th percentiles of old-age deaths, advancing with nearly 
constant long-term shape but annual fluctuations in speed. The existence of this 
front leads to several predictions that we verify, e.g., that advances in life 
expectancy at age 65 y are highly correlated with the advance of the 25th 
percentile, but not with distances between higher percentiles. Our unexpected 
result has implications for biological hypotheses about human aging and for 
future mortality change.

BACKGROUND: The combination of motor imagery (MI) and afferent input with 
electrical stimulation (ES) enhances the excitability of the corticospinal tract 
compared with motor imagery alone or electrical stimulation alone. However, its 
therapeutic effect is unknown in patients with hemiparetic stroke. We performed 
a preliminary examination of the therapeutic effects of MI + ES on upper 
extremity (UE) motor function in patients with chronic stroke.
METHODS: A total of 10 patients with chronic stroke demonstrating severe 
hemiparesis participated. The imagined task was extension of the affected 
finger. Peripheral nerve electrical stimulation was applied to the radial nerve 
at the spiral groove. MI + ES intervention was conducted for 10 days. UE motor 
function as assessed with the Fugl-Meyer assessment UE motor score (FMA-UE), the 
amount of the affected UE use in daily life as assessed with a Motor Activity 
Log (MAL-AOU), and the degree of hypertonia in flexor muscles as assessed with 
the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) were evaluated before and after intervention. 
To assess the change in spinal neural circuits, reciprocal inhibition between 
forearm extensor and flexor muscles with the H reflex conditioning-test paradigm 
at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 0, 20, and 100 ms were measured before and 
after intervention.
RESULTS: UE motor function, the amount of the affected UE use, and muscle 
hypertonia in flexor muscles were significantly improved after MI + ES 
intervention (FMA-UE: p < 0.01, MAL-AOU: p < 0.01, MAS: p = 0.02). 
Neurophysiologically, the intervention induced restoration of reciprocal 
inhibition from the forearm extensor to the flexor muscles (ISI at 0 ms: p = 
0.03, ISI at 20 ms: p = 0.03, ISI at 100 ms: p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: MI + ES intervention was effective for improving UE motor function 
in patients with severe paralysis.

Cystic fibrosis is the most common inherited condition in the Caucasian 
population and is associated with significantly reduced life expectancy. Recent 
advances in treatment have focussed on addressing the underlying cause of the 
condition, the defective production, expression and function of the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Several drugs with 
different modes of action have produced promising results in clinical trials, 
and some have been incorporated into routine clinical care for specific patients 
in many countries worldwide. Further trials continue to explore the safety and 
efficacy of these drugs in the youngest age groups and to search for more 
effective therapies to treat the most common disease-causing gene mutations in 
an ever-expanding drug pipeline. As evidence mounts for the early onset of 
disease in young patients, the prospect of introducing disease-modifying therapy 
in early life becomes more pertinent, although the cost implications of these 
expensive drugs are significant. In this review, we summarise these new therapy 
advances and review those currently being explored in clinical trials.

Due to the increasing occurrence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the general 
population and the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease among cancer 
patients, many people with a previous RCC may eventually require renal 
replacement therapy including kidney transplantation. They should accordingly be 
evaluated to assess their life expectancy and the risk that the chronic 
immunosuppressive therapy needed after grafting might impair their long-term 
outcome. Current guidelines on listing patients for renal transplantation 
suggest that no delay is required for subjects with small or incidentally 
discovered RCC, while the recommendations for patients who have been treated for 
a symptomatic RCC or for those with large or invasive tumours are conflicting. 
The controversial results reported by even recent studies focusing on the cancer 
risk in kidney graft recipients with a prior history of malignancy do not help 
to clarify the doubts arising in everyday clinical practice. Several tools, 
including integrated scoring systems, are currently available to assess the 
prognosis of patients with a previous RCC and, although they have not been 
validated in subjects receiving long-term immunosuppressive drugs, they can be 
used to identify patients suitable to be listed for grafting. Among these, the 
Leibovich score is currently the most widely used as it has proved simple and 
reliable enough and helps categorize renal transplant candidates. According to 
this system, subjects with a score from 0 to 2 are at low risk and may be listed 
without delay, while those with a score of 6 or higher should be excluded from 
grafting. In addition, other factors have an established positive prognostic 
value, including chromophobe or clear cell papillary tumour, or G1 grade cancer; 
on the contrary, medullary or Bellini's duct carcinoma or those with sarcomatoid 
dedifferentiation at histological examination should be excluded. All other 
patients would be better submitted to careful individual evaluation by an 
Oncologist before being listed for renal transplantation, pending studies 
specifically focusing on cancer risk evaluation in people already treated for 
malignancy receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapy.

Carposina sasakii Matsumura is one of the most destructive fruit-boring pests of 
pome and stone fruit trees in eastern Asia. Because larvae complete their 
development inside a single fruit, larval density per fruit is a critical factor 
in their survival, development, and fecundity. The effect of larval density was 
examined to determine the ideal density for devising an economic and sustainable 
mass-rearing system for harvesting of C. sasakii. Mass production of insects of 
the same age of a specific stage is not only important in biological control, 
but also in pheromone extraction, culturing of entomopathogenic nematodes and 
fungi, etc. Life history data for six larval densities (1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 
21-30, and 31-40 larvae/apple) were collected at 25.5 ± 0.5°C, 75.0 ± 5.0% RH, 
and a photoperiod of 15:9 (L: D) h. Data were analyzed using the age-stage, 
two-sex life table. The results showed that the highest preadult survival rate 
(42.00%), fecundity (104.70 eggs), and population parameters (intrinsic rate of 
increase r = 0.0718 d-1, net reproductive rate R0 = 23.03 eggs, and finite rate 
of increase λ = 1.0744 d-1) were observed at a density of 1-5 larvae/apple. 
However, when the rearing costs and production rate were considered, the density 
of 16-20 larvae/apple was the most economical for mass-rearing C. sasakii in 
order to achieve a daily harvest rate of 1,000 pupae (from 273 apples per day). 
To ensure the sustainability of the mass-rearing system, we included the life 
table variability in the harvesting strategy.

OBJECTIVES: We extend existing research on the living arrangements of older 
Americans by focusing on geographic proximity to children, examining transitions 
in living arrangements across older ages, and describing differences by both 
race/ethnicity and educational attainment.
METHOD: We use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) over a period of 
10 years (2000-2010) to construct multistate life tables. These analyses allow 
us to describe the lives of older Americans between ages 65 and 90 in terms of 
the number of expected years of life in different living arrangements, 
reflecting both mortality and living arrangement transitions.
RESULTS: Americans spend a substantial proportion of later life living near, but 
not with, adult children. There is a good deal of change in living arrangements 
at older ages and living arrangement-specific life expectancy differs markedly 
by race/ethnicity and educational attainment. However, overall life expectancy 
is not strongly related to living arrangements at age 65.
DISCUSSION: Multistate life tables, constructed separately by sex, 
race/ethnicity, and educational attainment, provide a comprehensive description 
of sociodemographic differences in living arrangements across older ages in the 
United States. We discuss the potential implications of these differences for 
access to support and the exacerbation or mitigation of inequalities at older 
ages.

The superior agronomic and human nutritional properties of grain legumes 
(pulses) make them an ideal foundation for future sustainable agriculture. 
Legume-based farming is particularly important in Africa, where small-scale 
agricultural systems dominate the food production landscape. Legumes provide an 
inexpensive source of protein and nutrients to African households as well as 
natural fertilization for the soil. Although the consumption of traditionally 
grown legumes has started to decline, the production of soybeans (Glycine max 
Merr.) is spreading fast, especially across southern Africa. Predictions of 
future land-use allocation and production show that the soybean is poised to
