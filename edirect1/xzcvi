IMPORTANCE: Malignant spinal canal compression, a major complication of 
metastatic cancer, is managed with radiotherapy to maintain mobility and relieve 
pain, although there is no standard radiotherapy regimen.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether single-fraction radiotherapy is noninferior to 5 
fractions of radiotherapy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter noninferiority randomized 
clinical trial conducted in 42 UK and 5 Australian radiotherapy centers. 
Eligible patients (n = 686) had metastatic cancer with spinal cord or cauda 
equina compression, life expectancy greater than 8 weeks, and no previous 
radiotherapy to the same area. Patients were recruited between February 2008 and 
April 2016, with final follow-up in September 2017.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive external beam single-fraction 
8-Gy radiotherapy (n = 345) or 20 Gy of radiotherapy in 5 fractions over 5 
consecutive days (n = 341).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was ambulatory status at week 
8, based on a 4-point scale and classified as grade 1 (ambulatory without the 
use of aids and grade 5 of 5 muscle power) or grade 2 (ambulatory using aids or 
grade 4 of 5 muscle power). The noninferiority margin for the difference in 
ambulatory status was -11%. Secondary end points included ambulatory status at 
weeks 1, 4, and 12 and overall survival.
RESULTS: Among 686 randomized patients (median [interquartile range] age, 70 
[64-77] years; 503 (73%) men; 44% had prostate cancer, 19% had lung cancer, and 
12% had breast cancer), 342 (49.8%) were analyzed for the primary end point (255 
patients died before the 8-week assessment). Ambulatory status grade 1 or 2 at 
week 8 was achieved by 115 of 166 (69.3%) patients in the single-fraction group 
vs 128 of 176 (72.7%) in the multifraction group (difference, -3.5% [1-sided 95% 
CI, -11.5% to ∞]; P value for noninferiority = .06). The difference in 
ambulatory status grade 1 or 2 in the single-fraction vs multifraction group was 
-0.4% (63.9% vs 64.3%; [1-sided 95% CI, -6.9 to ∞]; P value for 
noninferiority = .004) at week 1, -0.7% (66.8% vs 67.6%; [1-sided 95% CI, -8.1 
to ∞]; P value for noninferiority = .01) at week 4, and 4.1% (71.8% vs 67.7%; 
[1-sided 95% CI, -4.6 to ∞]; P value for noninferiority = .002) at week 12. 
Overall survival rates at 12 weeks were 50% in the single-fraction group vs 55% 
in the multifraction group (stratified hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.74-1.41]). 
Of the 11 other secondary end points that were analyzed, the between-group 
differences were not statistically significant or did not meet noninferiority 
criterion.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with malignant metastatic solid tumors 
and spinal canal compression, a single radiotherapy dose, compared with a 
multifraction dose delivered over 5 days, did not meet the criterion for 
noninferiority for the primary outcome (ambulatory at 8 weeks). However, the 
extent to which the lower bound of the CI overlapped with the noninferiority 
margin should be considered when interpreting the clinical importance of this 
finding.

Artificial urinary sphincters (AUS) are common. Life expectancy at average 
implantation (71.5 years) is 14 years. During this period patients must still 
possess manual dexterity and cognitive capabilities needed to operate the AUS, 
otherwise it is practically unfunctional. Still, available data regarding AUS 
durability deal with medical and mechanical factors. Issues as age-related 
deteriorating manual dexterity and cognitive capabilities precluding patients 
from operating an apparently intact AUS have not been addressed. We set to focus 
on these aspects. We review the natural history of manual dexterity, physical, 
and cognitive deterioration of aging men and propose counseling and screening 
algorithms for evaluating these aspects.

The aging of the skin is the most visible and obvious manifestation of 
organismal aging and may serve as a predictor of life expectancy and health. It 
is, however, also the human desire for long-lasting beauty that further raises 
interests in the topic, and thus considerable means and efforts are put into 
studying the mechanisms of skin aging in basic and applied research. Both 
medical und non-medical interests are of benefit for skin research in general 
because the results from these studies help to deepen our understanding of the 
complex molecular, biological, cell signaling, developmental and immunological 
processes in this organ. In fact, the skin is an ideal organ to observe and 
analyze the impact of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of aging. Within the past 
five years technological advances like lineage tracing of cells in model 
organisms, intra-vital microscopy, nucleic acid sequencing at the single cell 
level, and high resolution mass spectrometry have allowed to study aging and 
senescence of individual skin cells within the tissue context, their signaling 
and communication, and to derive new hypotheses for experimental studies in 
vitro. In this short review we will discuss very recent developments that 
promise to extend the existing knowledge on cell aging and senescence of dermal 
fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes in skin aging.

BACKGROUND: Femoroacetabular acetabular impingement syndrome consists of 
abnormal hip joint morphology resulting in painful hip joint impingement. Hip 
arthroscopy corrects the abnormal morphology and reduces clinical symptoms 
associated with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome yet the effects of hip 
arthroscopy on gait mechanics and cartilage health are not well understood.
METHODS: Ten femoroacetabular impingement syndrome patients and 10 matched 
asymptomatic controls underwent gait analysis consisting of three-dimensional 
hip joint kinematics and kinetics. Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome 
patients underwent gait analysis and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging of 
the surgical hip joint before and seven months post-surgery. Patient reported 
outcomes were obtained from all study participants and were used to quantify hip 
joint pain, function and quality of life.
FINDINGS: Prior to surgery, femoroacetabular impingement syndrome patients 
demonstrated hip joint kinematics or kinetics as the control group. After 
surgery, femoroacetabular impingement syndrome patients exhibited improved 
patient reported outcomes, similar hip joint kinematic patterns, increased hip 
flexion and decreased hip extension moment impulses within the surgical limb. 
The femoroacetabular impingement syndrome patients that ambulated with increased 
HFMI post-surgery demonstrated a decrease in femoral cartilage T1ρ and T2 
values.
INTERPRETATION: Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome patients exhibited 
improved clinical symptoms yet ambulated with altered sagittal plane hip joint 
loading after hip arthroscopy. Increased hip flexion moment impulse post-surgery 
was associated with improved cartilage health within the surgical limb. These 
study findings suggest that sagittal plane hip joint loading at short-term 
follow-up after hip arthroscopy is associated with cartilage health and may be 
an important biomechanical parameter in post-operative rehabilitation programs.

BACKGROUND: The De-ESCALaTE HPV trial confirmed the dominance of cisplatin over 
cetuximab for tumour control in patients with human papillomavirus 
(HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Here, we present 
the analysis of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), resource use, and health 
care costs in the trial, as well as complete 2-year survival and recurrence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resource use and HRQoL data were collected at intervals 
from the baseline to 24 months post treatment (PT). Health care costs were 
estimated using UK-based unit costs. Missing data were imputed. Differences in 
mean EQ-5D-5L utility index and adjusted cumulative quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and linear regression, 
respectively. Mean resource usage and costs were compared through two-sample 
t-tests.
RESULTS: 334 patients were randomised to cisplatin (n = 166) or cetuximab 
(n = 168). Two-year overall survival (97·5% vs 90·0%, HR: 3.268 [95% CI 1·451 to 
7·359], p = 0·0251) and recurrence rates (6·4% vs 16·0%, HR: 2·67 [1·38 to 
5·15]; p = 0·0024) favoured cisplatin. No significant differences in EQ-5D-5L 
utility scores were detected at any time point. At 24 months PT, mean difference 
was 0·107 QALYs in favour of cisplatin (95% CI: 0·186 to 0·029, p = 0·007) 
driven by the mortality difference. Health care costs were similar across all 
categories except the procurement cost and delivery of the systemic agent, with 
cetuximab significantly more expensive than cisplatin (£7779 [P < 0.001]). 
Consequently, total costs at 24 months PT averaged £13517 (SE: £345) per patient 
for cisplatin and £21064 (SE: £400) for cetuximab (mean difference £7547 [95% 
CI: £6512 to £8582]).
CONCLUSIONS: Cisplatin chemoradiotherapy provided more QALYs and was less costly 
than cetuximab bioradiotherapy, remaining standard of care for nonsurgical 
treatment of HPV-positive OPSCC.

Objective: To estimate the burden attributed to the dietary inorganic arsenic 
exposure with lung cancer, bladder cancer and skin cancer as end points. 
Methods: Inorganic arsenic, food or diet were used as Chinese keywords and 
arsenic, food and China were used as English keywords to search for literatures 
related to the dietary inorganic arsenic exposure published by China National 
Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform and PubMed 
Database. Using the data from the China National Nutrition and Health Survey 
(CNNHS) in 2002 to estimate the dietary inorganic arsenic exposure in Chinese 
residents. The annual cancer cases attributed to the dietary inorganic arsenic 
exposure were calculated based on the data from Chinese Cancer Registry Annual 
Report in 2013. The disability adjusted life year (DALY) was calculated using 
tools built by WHO. Results: The total DALY of cancer caused by the dietary 
inorganic arsenic exposure was 419.4 thousand, and the DALY rate was 31.47 per 
100 000. The DALY of lung cancer in males and females was 237.7 thousand and 
102.5 thousand. The DALY of bladder cancer in males and females was 13.2 
thousand and 3.9 thousand. The DALY of skin cancer in males and females was 29.4 
thousand and 32.8 thousand. Conclusion: In 2013, the Chinese population had a 
lower burden of cancer due to the dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is increasing in the HIV-positive population and 
age-related non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, (CVD) are 
seen more frequently. This study investigated to what extent HIV and 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with CVD risk in an urban African 
population.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in Johannesburg, South Africa, 
between July 2016 and November 2017. Both HIV-positive adults (ART-naïve, or on 
first- or second-line ART), as well as age and sex matched HIV-negative controls 
who were family or friends of the HIV-positive participants were included. Data 
were collected on demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, HIV-related 
characteristics, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and carotid 
distensibility. The association between HIV, ART and CIMT and distensibility was 
analysed with linear regression models, adjusting for age, gender and CVD risk 
factors.
RESULTS: The study included 548 participants, 337 (62%) females, age 
38.3 ± 9.5 years of whom 104 (19.0%) were HIV-positive, ART-naïve; 94 (17.2%) 
were on first-line ART; 197 (35.9%) were on second-line ART; and 153 (27.9%) 
were HIV-negative. Participants on second-line ART had higher CIMT and lower 
distensibility compared to the other groups (p < 0.001). After adjustment for 
age, these outcomes were similar between groups. Further adjustment for CVD and 
HIV-related factors did not alter the findings.
CONCLUSION: Neither HIV nor ART was associated with CIMT or carotid 
distensibility in this urban African population. Longitudinal studies are needed 
to fully understand the relationship between HIV and CVD across different 
populations.

BACKGROUND: Global increases in colorectal cancer risk have spurred debate about 
optimal use of screening resources. We explored the potential clinical and 
economic impact of colorectal cancer screening tailored to predicted colorectal 
cancer risk.
METHODS: We compared screening tailored to predicted risk versus uniform 
screening in a validated decision analytic model, considering the average risk 
population's actual colorectal cancer risk distribution, and a risk-prediction 
tool's discriminatory ability and cost. Low, moderate, and high risk tiers were 
identified as colorectal cancer risk after age 50 years of ≤3%, >3 to <12%, and 
≥12%, respectively, based on threshold analyses with willingness-to-pay 
<$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Tailored colonoscopy (once at 
age 60 years for low risk, every 10 years for moderate risk, and every 5 years 
for high risk) was compared with colonoscopy every 10 years for all. Tailored 
fecal immunochemical testing (FIT)/colonoscopy (annual FIT for low and moderate 
risk, colonoscopy every 5 years for high risk) was compared with annual FIT for 
all.
RESULTS: Assuming no colorectal cancer risk misclassification or risk-prediction 
tool costs, tailored screening was preferred over uniform screening. Tailored 
colonoscopy was minimally less effective than uniform colonoscopy, but saved 
$90,200-$889,000/QALY; tailored FIT/colonoscopy yielded more QALYs/person than 
annual FIT at $10,600-$60,000/QALY gained. Relatively modest colorectal cancer 
risk misclassification rates or risk-prediction tool costs resulted in uniform 
screening as the preferred approach.
CONCLUSIONS: Current risk-prediction tools may not yet be accurate enough to 
optimize colorectal cancer screening.
IMPACT: Uniform screening is likely to be preferred over tailored screening if a 
risk-prediction tool is associated with even modest misclassification rates or 
costs.

Imaging three-dimensional magnetic systems with x-rays.

Donnelly C(1), Scagnoli V.

Author information:
(1)Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 
0HE, United Kingdom.

Recent progress in nanofabrication and additive manufacturing have facilitated 
the building of nanometer-scale three-dimensional (3D) structures, that promise 
to lead to an emergence of new functionalities within a number of fields, 
compared to state-of-the-art two dimensional systems. In magnetism, the move to 
3D systems offers the possibility for novel magnetic properties not available in 
planar systems, as well as enhanced performance, both of which are key for the 
development of new technological applications. In this review paper we will 
focus our attention on 3D magnetic systems and how their magnetic configuration 
can be retrieved using x-ray magnetic nanotomography. We will start with an 
introduction to magnetic materials, and their relevance to our everyday life, 
along with the growing impact that they will have in the coming years in, for 
example, reducing energy consumption. We will then briefly introduce common 
methods used to study magnetic materials, such as electron holography, neutron 
and x-ray imaging. In particular, we will focus on x-ray magnetic circular 
dichroism (XMCD) and how it can be used to image magnetic moment configurations. 
As a next step we will introduce tomography for 3D imaging, and how it can be 
adapted to study magnetic materials. Particular attention will be given to 
explaining the reconstruction algorithms that can be used to retrieve the 
magnetic moment configuration from the experimental data, as these represent one 
of the main challenges so far, as well as the different experimental geometries 
that are available. Recent experimental results will be used as specific 
examples to guide the reader through each step in order to make sure that the 
paper will be accessible for those interested in the topic that do not have a 
specialized background on magnetic imaging. Finally, we will describe the future 
prospects of such studies, identifying the current challenges facing the field, 
and how these can be tackled. In particular we will highlight the exciting 
possibilities offered by the next generation of synchrotron sources which will 
deliver diffraction limited beams, as well as with the extension of 
well-established methodologies currently implemented for the study of 
two-dimensional magnetic materials to achieve higher dimensional investigations.

The Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cry3Bb gene was successfully introduced into 
poplar plastid genome, leading to transplastomic poplar with high mortality to 
Plagiodera versicolora. Poplar (Populus L.) is one of the main resource of woody 
industry, but being damaged by insect pests. The feasibility and efficiency of 
plastid transformation technology for controlling two lepidopteran caterpillars 
have been demonstrated previously. Here, we introduced B. thuringiensis (Bt) 
cry3Bb into poplar plastid genome by biolistic bombardment for controlling P. 
versicolora, a widely distributed forest pest. Chimeric cry3Bb gene is 
controlled by the tobacco plastid rRNA operon promoter combined with the 5'UTR 
from gene10 of bacteriophage T7 (NtPrrn:T7g10) and the 3'UTR from the E. coli 
ribosomal RNA operon rrnB (TrrnB). The integration of transgene and homoplasmy 
of transplastomic poplar plants was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. 
Northern blot analysis indicated that cry3Bb was transcribed to both read 
through and shorter length transcripts in plastid. The transplastomic poplar 
expressing Cry3Bb insecticidal protein showed the highest accumulation level in 
young leaves, which reach up to 16.8 μg/g fresh weight, and comparatively low 
levels in mature and old leaves. Feeding the young leaves from Bt-Cry3Bb plastid 
lines to P. versicolora caused 100% mortality in the first-instar larvae after 
only 1 day, in the second-instar larvae after 2 days, and in the third-instar 
larvae for 3 days. Thus, we report a successful extension of plastid engineering 
poplar against the chrysomelid beetle.

PURPOSE: Along with increased life expectancy and improvements in the diagnostic 
tools and techniques, the number of elderly patients with symptomatic pituitary 
tumors being evaluated for surgery is increasing. To date, contrasting results 
of the safety and effectiveness of transsphenoidal surgery in patients over 
65 years old were published in the medical literature. An investigation 
concerning the extension of resection, post operative complications and, 
recovery rate from endocrinological and visual symptoms in elderly patients who 
underwent transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma was conducted.
METHODS: A retrospective review, which included a series of 81 patients 65 years 
old or older who underwent endoscopic endonasal surgery for pituitary adenomas 
was analyzed. Pre operative and post operative data were collected and patients 
were then compared among four age groups: 65-69 years old, 70-74 years old, 
75-79 years old and 80 years and over. The results were then compared with the 
findings from the medical literature review.
RESULTS: The statistical analysis failed to highlight any difference in terms of 
clinical presentation or complications among the four age groups, however there 
seems to be a slightly higher risk of post operative hypopituitarism in patients 
over 74 years old.
CONCLUSION: The results of the study seem to confirm that transsphenoidal 
surgery for PA is safe and effective among patients that are 65 and over. 
Moreover, a partial resection is preferred over a gross total one in order to 
reduce the surgical risk.

BACKGROUND: In post-industrial countries, ethnic minorities suffer poorer health 
and premature deaths. The present study examined ethnic differences in life 
expectancy and related features among elite heavyweight boxers.
METHODS: Dates of birth and death, anthropometry, and championship years were 
gathered from media archives for champions and challengers (never been a 
champion) between years 1889 and 2019. Cox regression adjusted for age at 
contest, nationality, BMI, champion/challenger status, and number of contests 
was used to assess survival.
RESULTS: All 237 boxers, 83 champions (37.3% whites) and 154 challengers (61.0% 
whites), who contested for heavyweight championships were identified. By 2019, 
110 (75 whites, 34 non-whites) were known to have died. Non-white boxers died at 
an earlier age than whites boxers (mean ± SD = 59.8 ± 14.2 years versus 67.3 ± 
16.4 years, p = 0.018) and had shorter survival: HR = 2.13 (95% CI = 1.4-3.3). 
Among non-white boxers, deaths were higher from neurological disorders: OR = 8.2 
(95% CI = 1.3-13.5) and accidents: OR = 15.1 (95% CI = 2.3-98.2), while death 
from natural causes was lower: OR = 0.2 (95% CI = 0.03-0.8). After boxing 
careers, fewer non-white boxers had non-manual jobs (34.4% versus 71.8%) than 
manual (34.4% versus 19.7%) or were unemployed (28.1% versus 2.8%). Reported 
substance abuse was similar across ethnicity (8.0% versus 8.8%) but conviction 
rates were higher among non-white boxers (17.6%) than white (1.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with white boxers, non-white boxers tend to die younger 
with excess neurological and accidental deaths, and they have lower social 
positions in later life. Sporting authorities should reappraise the wisdom of 
permitting head injuries in sport and monitor and support the health and 
wellbeing of sports men and women after retirement.

Thyroid Dysfunction and Cholesterol Gallstone Disease.

Kube I(1), Zwanziger D(1).

Author information:

Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.

Cholesterol gallstone disease (CGD) affects 10-15% of the adult population 
worldwide and the prevalence increases as a result of longer life expectancy as 
well as rising obesity in the general population. Beside well established CGD 
risk factors including environmental and genetic determinants (LITH genes), a 
correlation between thyroid dysfunction and CGD has been suggested in several 
human and murine studies. Although the precise underlying mechanisms are poorly 
understood, thyroid hormones may impact bile flow, bile composition and the 
maintenance of the enterohepatic circulation. Further there is evidence that 
thyroid hormones possibly impact LITH genes which are regulated by nuclear 
receptors (NRs). A better understanding of the CGD pathomechanisms might 
contribute to personalized prevention and therapy of highly prevalent and 
economically significant digestive disease. This review presents the current 
knowledge about the association between CGD and thyroid hormone dysfunction.

The general objective of this article is to critically review the state of the 
art regarding current factors accounting for aging, longevity and successful 
longevity. There are two major constructs which most authors are employing to 
account for longevity: genetic or intrinsic components versus environmental or 
extrinsic factors. This classification has important flaws: (i) From an 
epigenetic standpoint, such a polar classification could lead to misconceptions 
since both factors are interdependent through lifelong interactions. (ii) There 
are no specifications regarding these "environmental" factors, which include a 
broad heterogeneity of conditions (physical, economic, social, and cultural 
aspects as well as behavioral ones such as lifestyle) but do not include 
personal conditions, such as psychological characteristics. The review of the 
new paradigm called successful aging yields an important set of 
psycho-behavioral factors, and although population indexes such as Disability 
Free Life Expectancy (DFLE) or Healthy Life expectancy (HLE) have been 
developed, authors do not take into consideration healthy or successful 
longevity as a potential prolongation of the new paradigm of active or 
successful aging. There is a broad corpus of research literature supporting the 
importance of psycho-behavioral (PB) factors intervening in the ways of aging, 
specifically intelligence and cognitive functioning, positive emotion and 
control, personality traits, psychosocial, physical conditions, and lifestyles, 
all of which are highly associated with active aging, health, longevity, and 
survival. The importance of these factors accounting for longevity, and 
successful longevity must be taken into consideration as a pending issue in 
gerontology.

Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer in men in Europe. The 
primary treatment of this type of cancer is radical prostatectomy, which has 
shown good oncological results. Radical prostatectomy (open, laparoscopic or 
robotic) has high success and low morbidity rates in patients with localized 
prostate cancer. The life expectancy is >10 years after radical prostatectomy. 
Studies have shown that ~20%-30% of the patients who have undergone radical 
prostatectomy can develop biochemical recurrence, which is monitored by using 
the value of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In some cases (patients with 
high-risk prostate cancer), adjuvant therapy after radical prostatectomy, such 
as radiotherapy or androgen deprivation therapy, can significantly reduce the 
risk of biochemical recurrence. The optimal management of recurrent disease 
remains uncertain. Recent literature was systematically reviewed regarding the 
management of biochemical recurrence and to compare clinical experience in 
literature studies.

Gastrointestinal tract involvement is the most common visceral affectation in 
systemic sclerosis (SSc), but the manifestations may vary in extension and 
severity. Endoscopic and histopathological gastroesophageal findings were 
investigated in patients with SSc. A total of 79 consecutive patients with 
definite SSc were enrolled in a cross sectional study. Clinical data were 
collected, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsies from gastric mucosa 
were performed in all cases. Fifty-seven (72.1%) out of 79 SSc patients had 
gastroesophageal symptoms. The most frequent were dysphagia, present in 33 
(41.7%) and gastroesophageal reflux symptoms in 23 (29.1%) patients. Out of the 
79 patients, 22 were asymptomatic, but in 16 esophageal and gastric mucosa 
changes were endoscopically detected. Reflux esophagitis was found in 39 (49.3%) 
patients. The presence of esophageal manifestations was not related to the 
disease duration or with its other variables. Signs of gastritis were 
endoscopically described in 47 (59.4%) and confirmed on histopathologic 
examinations in 45 patients. In 31 patients without any endoscopic changes, 18 
(22.7%) showed signs of gastritis on histopathologic examination. No significant 
statistical differences were found between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients 
or between those with limited cutaneous SSc and those with diffuse cutaneous SSc 
in terms of clinical, endoscopic or histopathological findings, except the 
higher proportion of hiatal hernia in symptomatic patients. The results of this 
study might suggest that upper gastrointestinal endoscopy should be performed 
during the early stage of the disease and then periodically in patients 
diagnosed with SSc, even in the absence of typical symptoms.

Using a multistate model, this article examines gender gap and its trend in 
health transition, life expectancy (LE), and active life expectancy (ALE) in 
different age groups and birth cohorts. The transition rate from life 
independence/disability to death for elderly women is lower than for elderly 
men. However, their disability rate is higher. The gender gap in LE, ALE, and 
DLE (disabled life expectancy) declines as age increases. In successive birth 
cohorts, men's LE increases more, and gender gaps in LE and ALE decrease over 
time. In the future, gender issues should be considered for health-care policy 
to provide nursing care for elderly women in China.

OBJECTIVES: Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequently occurring fetal 
chromosomal abnormality and different prenatal screening strategies are used for 
determining risk of DS worldwide. New non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), 
which uses cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood can provide benefits due to its 
higher sensitivity and specificity in comparison to conventional screening 
tests. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of using 
population-level NIPT in fetal aneuploidy screening for DS.
METHODS: We developed a microsimulation decision-analytic model to perform a 
probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of prenatal screening and 
diagnostic strategies for DS. The model followed individual simulated pregnant 
women through the pregnancy pathway. The comparators were serum-only screening, 
contingent NIPT (i.e., NIPT as a second-tier screening test) and universal NIPT 
(i.e., NIPT as a first-tier screening test). To address uncertainty around the 
model parameters, the expected values of costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) in the base case and all scenario analyses were obtained through 
probabilistic analysis from a Monte Carlo simulation.
RESULTS: Base case and scenario analyses were conducted by repeating the 
micro-simulation 1,000 times for a sample of 45,605 pregnant women per the 
population of British Columbia, Canada (N = 4.8 million). Preliminary results of 
the sequential CEAs showed that contingent NIPT was a dominant strategy compared 
to serum-only screening. Compared with contingent NIPT, universal NIPT at the 
current test price was not cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio over $100,000/QALY. Contingent NIPT also had the lowest cost per DS case 
detected among these three strategies.
CONCLUSION: Including NIPT in existing prenatal screening for DS is shown to be 
beneficial over conventional testing. However, at current prices, implementation 
of NIPT as a second-tier screening test is more cost-effective than deploying it 
as a universal test.

This study aimed to identify variations in weekly training load, training 
monotony, and training strain across a 10-week period (during both, pre- and 
in-season phases); and to analyze the dose-response relationships between 
training markers and maximal aerobic speed (MAS), maximal oxygen uptake, and 
isokinetic strength. Twenty-seven professional soccer players (24.9±3.5 years 
old) were monitored across the 10-week period using global positioning system 
units. Players were also tested for maximal aerobic speed, maximal oxygen 
uptake, and isokinetic strength before and after 10 weeks of training. Large 
positive correlations were found between sum of training load and extension peak 
torque in the right lower limb (r = 0.57, 90%CI[0.15;0.82]) and the ratio 
agonist/antagonist in the right lower limb (r = 0.51, [0.06;0.78]). It was 
observed that loading measures fluctuated across the period of the study and 
that the load was meaningfully associated with changes in the fitness status of 
players. However, those magnitudes of correlations were small-to-large, 
suggesting that variations in fitness level cannot be exclusively explained by 
the accumulated load and loading profile.

Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra.

Human lifespan has seen a rise globally. Extended lifespan is a trend projected 
to persist and continue. The gap is wide: from 52.67 years in the Central 
African Republic to 80.3 years in the OECD (Canada, Germany, Mexico, France, 
Japan, UK). In India the expectancy was 68.8 years in 2018. Concordant with the 
enhanced life span have been studies that explain determinants and mechanisms of 
human longevity, much of which has been attributed to better public health 
measures and improved care. The natural twin consequences of longevity: a) 
Frailty its characteristics and management and b) the behavioural cum 
attitudinal phenomenon of Ageism have come to the fore and require appropriate 
corrections. Physicians need to be aware of the demographic changes and 
implications thereof in management and healthcare. The medical aspects of either 
are elaborated.
