50.9-90.4% was confirmed for IHEO reinforced in WPNF-MBP NPs. Fourier transform 
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed that IHEO was successfully loaded within 
WPNF-MBP NPs without specific chemical interaction with the carrier matrix. The 
results indicated that incorporation of IHEO-reinforced WPNF-MBP NPs into active 
material coatings having acceptable inhibition activity against total viable and 
psychrotrophic bacteria. The coated fishes also retarded the increase of PV 
(peroxide value), TBA (thiobarbituric acid) and TVB-N (total volatile basic 
nitrogen) values during storage. The IHEO-reinforced WPNF-MBP NPs coating led to 
an extension in the shelf life of Rainbow trout fillets within 8-14 days of 
storage. Accordingly, IHEO-reinforced WPNF-MBP NPs can be suggested as a natural 
preservative for coating fishes.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer (BC) is the most widely studied disease due to its 
higher prevalence, heterogeneity and mortality.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare female BC trends among 21 world regions 
and globally over 28 year of data and to assess the association between 
sociodemographic transitions and female BC risks.
METHODS: We used Global burden of disease study data and measure the female BC 
burden according to 21 world regions and sociodemographic indices (SDI). 
Age-period-cohort (APC) analysis was used to estimate time and cohort trend of 
BC in different SDI regions.
RESULTS: By world regions, age-standardised rate of female BC incidence were 
high in high-income-North America (ASR, 92.9; (95 %UI, 89.2, 96.6)), Western 
Europe (84.7; (73.4, 97.2)) and Australia (86; (81.7, 90.2)) in 2017. Whereas 
this rate was significantly increased by 89.5% between 1990 and 2017 in East 
Asia. We observed negative association between SDI and death, and DALYs in 25th 
and below percentiles of death and DALYs for the worldwide regions. Further, 
there was observed a strong negative correlation between SDI and case fatality 
percent (r2017 = -0.93; r1990 = -0.92) in both 2017 and 1990 worldwide and 
highest case fatality percentage was observed in Central Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Overall, the risk of case-fatality rate tends to decrease most noticeably in 
high middle SDI countries, and the reduction of the risk of case-fatality rate 
in the recent cohort was the lowest in the low SDI countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Remarkable variations exist among various regions in BC burden. 
There is a need to reduce the health burden from BC in less developed and under 
developing countries, because under-developed countries are facing higher degree 
of health-related burden. Public health managers should execute more classified 
and cost-effective screening and treatment interferences to lessen the deaths 
caused by BC, predominantly among middle and low SDI countries having inadequate 
healthcare supplies.

BACKGROUND: The outcomes of congenital scoliosis (CS) patients undergoing 
hemivertebra (HV) resection surgery with a 2-level fusion versus a >2-level 
fusion are unclear. We hypothesized that CS patients undergoing HV resection and 
a >2-level fusion have decreased curve progression and reoperation rates 
compared with 2-level fusions.
METHODS: Retrospective review of prospectively collected data from a multicenter 
scoliosis database. Fifty-three CS patients (average age 4.5, range 1.2 to 
10.9 y) at index surgery were included. Radiographic and surgical parameters, 
complications, as well as revision surgery rates were tracked at a minimum of 
2-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients had a 2-level fusion while 27 patients had a 
>2-level fusion with similar age and body mass index between groups. The HV was 
located in the lumbar spine for 69% (18/26) 2-level fusions and 30% (8/27) 
>2-level fusions ( P =0.006). Segmental HV scoliosis curve was smaller in 
2-level fusions compared to >2-level fusions preoperatively (38 vs. 50 degrees, 
P =0.016) and at follow-up (25 vs. 34 degrees, P =0.038). Preoperative T2-T12 
(28 vs. 41 degrees, P =0.013) and segmental kyphosis (11 vs. 23 degrees, P 
=0.046) were smaller in 2-level fusions, but did not differ significantly at 
postoperative follow-up (32 vs. 39 degrees, P =0.22; 13 vs. 11 degrees, P =0.64, 
respectively). Furthermore, the 2 groups did not significantly differ in terms 
of surgical complications (27% vs. 22%, P =0.69; 2-level fusion vs. >2-level 
fusion, respectively), unplanned revision surgery rate (23% vs. 22%, 0.94), 
growing rod placement or extension of spinal fusion (15% vs. 15%, P =0.95), or 
health-related quality of life per the EOS-Questionnaire 24 (EOSQ-24). 
Comparison of patients with or without the need for growing rod placement or 
posterior spinal fusion revealed no significant differences in all parameters 
analyzed.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-level and >2-level fusions can control congenital curves 
successfully. No differences existed in curve correction, proximal junctional 
kyphosis or complications between short and long-level fusion after HV 
resection. Both short and long level fusions are viable options and generate 
similar risk of revision. The decision should be individualized by patient and 
surgeon.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD) is more prevalent in 
recent decades due to the increasing life expectancy of patients with cystic 
fibrosis (CF). There is paucity of population-level data on the impact of CFLD 
on hospital outcomes.
METHODS: We interrogated nonoverlapping years (2003-2016) of the National 
Inpatient Sample and Kids' Inpatient Database to include all hospitalized 
patients <21 years of age with a primary diagnosis of CF within the United 
States. A concomitant diagnosis of cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, chronic liver 
disease, portal hypertension, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, hypersplenism, and 
liver transplant status was considered as surrogates for the diagnosis of CFLD 
and was compared with CF-related hospitalizations without these diagnoses 
(controls) for demographics, comorbid conditions, in-hospital mortality, 
length-of-stay, and hospital charges.
RESULTS: We evaluated 94,374 CF-related hospitalizations. The prevalence of CFLD 
was 5.8%. The prevalence increased from 3.1% (2003) to a peak of 7.3% (2014) 
with an overall increasing trend, p < 0.001. Hospitalizations with CFLD had an 
increased prevalence of significant comorbidities: respiratory failure,lung 
transplant, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, 
Clostridioides difficile infection, cholelithiasis, anemia, and need for 
parenteral nutrition, p < 0.001. Multivariate regression models showed CFLD as 
independently associated with 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5 to 2.8) 
times increased risk of inpatient mortality, contributed to 1.1 (95% CI: 0.89 to 
1.37) additional days of hospitalization, and incurring $14,852 (95% CI: 12,204 
to 17,501) excess hospital charges, p < 0.001.
CONCLUSION: CFLD is associated with multiple comorbidities and is independently 
associated with increased risk of mortality and increased health care resource 
utilization in pediatric CF-related hospitalizations.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There are over a million adults living with congenital heart 
disease (CHD) in the USA. There have been improvements in CHD management which 
have led to an expansion of the adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) 
population. There is a high prevalence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
(ASCVD) encountered in the aging ACHD population. This review focuses on the 
most recent literature regarding the primary prevention of ASCVD in young ACHD 
patients.
RECENT FINDINGS: There are unique considerations for ASCVD risk reduction in 
ACHD patients. ASCVD may be as prevalent in ACHD compared in the general 
population. However, there may be a perceived shorter life expectancy in ACHD 
patients; therefore, primary prevention of ASCVD may not be considered 
important. Preventative strategies for ASCVD are underutilized in ACHD patients. 
As these patients are followed for a lifetime by cardiologists, we can truly 
pursue primary prevention in this aging population.

Application for The Netherlands.

OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased mortality worldwide considerably 
in 2020. Nevertheless, it is unknown how the increase in mortality translates 
into a loss in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), which is a function of age 
and the health condition of the deceased patient at time of death. We estimate 
the QALYs lost in The Netherlands as a result of deaths because of COVID-19 
in 2020.
METHODS: As a starting point, we use estimates of underlying diseases and the 
number of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes as a proxy for underlying health 
status. In a next step, these are combined with estimates of excess mortality 
rates and quality of life for different groups to calculate QALYs lost. We 
compare the results with an alternative scenario, in which COVID-19 deaths 
occurred randomly across the population regardless of underlying conditions. For 
this alternative scenario, we use population mortality and average quality of 
life by age and sex.
RESULTS: Accounting for underlying health status, we estimate that QALYs lost 
because of COVID-19 mortality are on average 3.9 per death for men and 3.5 for 
women. This is approximately 3.5 QALYs less than when not taking selective 
mortality into account. Given 16 308 excess deaths, this translates into 61 032 
QALYs lost because of COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that QALYs lost because of COVID-19 mortality are still 
substantial, even if mortality is strongly concentrated in people with poor 
health.

BACKGROUND: Chronic low back-related leg pain may involve mixed pain mechanisms. 
A strategy to address both neuropathic and nociceptive pain symptoms would be 
combining treatments.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of adding neurodynamic exercises to 
extension-oriented exercises in patients with chronic low back-related leg pain 
and a directional preference.
DESIGN: Two arm, single blind, randomized clinical trial.
METHOD: Eligible participants were aged between 18 and 65 years, had low back 
pain radiating below gluteus for at least 3 months, pain intensity greater than 
3 points in the numerical pain rating scale, positive SLR test and a directional 
preference for lumbar extension movements. Thirty-one participants were randomly 
allocated into one of two groups: extension-oriented exercises (EE) or extension 
exercises plus neurodynamic exercises (EEN). Primary outcomes were leg pain 
intensity and function at 3 weeks. Secondary outcomes were low back pain 
intensity, disability, global perceived effect and quality of life at 3 weeks 
and at 1 month.
RESULTS: Retention rate was 100% (n = 14) in EE and 94% (n = 16) in EEN for 
primary outcome analysis. There was no between-group difference for the primary 
outcomes and for low back pain intensity, GPE and quality of life at 3 weeks. 
For some outcomes, EE was superior to EEN.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no benefits in adding neurodynamic exercises to 
extension-oriented exercises for patients with nerve-related leg pain and a 
directional preference. As this study has a small and very specific sample, 
results may be interpreted with caution.

Assessing the impact of including variation in general population mortality on 
standard errors of relative survival and loss in life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: A relative survival approach is often used in population-based 
cancer studies, where other cause (or expected) mortality is assumed to be the 
same as the mortality in the general population, given a specific covariate 
pattern. The population mortality is assumed to be known (fixed), i.e. measured 
without uncertainty. This could have implications for the estimated standard 
errors (SE) of any measures obtained within a relative survival framework, such 
as relative survival (RS) ratios and the loss in life expectancy (LLE). We 
evaluated the existing approach to estimate SE of RS and the LLE in comparison 
to if uncertainty in the population mortality was taken into account.
METHODS: The uncertainty from the population mortality was incorporated using 
parametric bootstrap approach. The analysis was performed with different levels 
of stratification and sizes of the general population used for creating expected 
mortality rates. Using these expected mortality rates, SEs of 5-year RS and the 
LLE for colon cancer patients in Sweden were estimated.
RESULTS: Ignoring uncertainty in the general population mortality rates had 
negligible (less than 1%) impact on the SEs of 5-year RS and LLE, when the 
expected mortality rates were based on the whole general population, i.e. all 
people living in a country or region. However, the smaller population used for 
creating the expected mortality rates, the larger impact. For a general 
population reduced to 0.05% of the original size and stratified by age, sex, 
year and region, the relative precision for 5-year RS was 41% for males 
diagnosed at age 85. For the LLE the impact was more substantial with a relative 
precision of 1286%. The relative precision for marginal estimates of 5-year RS 
was 3% and 30% and for the LLE 22% and 313% when the general population was 
reduced to 0.5% and 0.05% of the original size, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: When the general population mortality rates are based on the whole 
population, the uncertainty in the estimates of the expected measures can be 
ignored. However, when based on a smaller population, this uncertainty should be 
taken into account, otherwise SEs may be too small, particularly for marginal 
values, and, therefore, confidence intervals too narrow.

Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU), Vienna, Austria.

Biopolymers, such as polynucleotides, polypeptides and polysaccharides, are 
macromolecules that direct most of the functions in living beings. Studying the 
mechanical unfolding of biopolymers provides important information about their 
molecular elasticity and mechanical stability, as well as their energy 
landscape, which is especially important in proteins, since their 
three-dimensional structure is essential for their correct activity. In this 
primer, we present how to study the mechanical properties of proteins with 
atomic force microscopy and how to obtain information about their stability and 
energetic landscape. In particular, we discuss the preparation of polyprotein 
constructs suitable for AFM single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), describe 
the parameters used in our force-extension SMFS experiments and the models and 
equations employed in the analysis of the data. As a practical example, we show 
the effect of the temperature on the unfolding force, the distance to the 
transition state, the unfolding rate at zero force, the height of the transition 
state barrier, and the spring constant of the protein for a construct containing 
nine repeats of the I27 domain from the muscle protein titin. HIGHLIGHTS: 1. 
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be used to study the mechanical unfolding of 
polymers. 2. AFM provides a direct measurement of unfolding (unbinding) forces. 
3. Force measurements for different rates provide information about the distance 
to the transition state and the unfolding rate at zero force.

This study examined the inter-session reliability of force output from a novel 
isometric strength assessment protocol (the Kicker); and its suitability to 
monitor soccer player's combined hip flexion and knee extension force capacity 
over 72-h post-competitive matches. Reliability (Part-A) testing was completed 
over three sessions on 20 individuals participating in various sports at a 
recreational level or higher. Post-match strength response (Part-B) data were 
collected for 72-h after a game (24-h (+24), 48-h (+48) and 72-h (+72) 
post-match) in 17 male academy soccer players. After familiarisation, Kicker 
force for each limb showed high inter-session reliability (ICC >0.95; typical 
error <14 N, CV <6%); minimum detectable change at a 95% confidence interval 
<40 N). Across the 72-h post-match period, Kicker force for each limb was 
suppressed compared to baseline (force loss range = -5.8% to -12.5%; effect 
sizes range = -0.26 to -0.43) at all time points. The Kicker assessment protocol 
measures combined isometric hip flexor and knee extensor force capacity with 
high inter-session reliability. The proof of concept that the protocol can be 
used as a monitoring tool was evidenced by sustained suppression of baseline 
force capacity in both kicking limbs for 72-h post soccer matches.

OBJECTIVES: Polatuzumab vedotin with bendamustine and rituximab (Pola-BR) was 
approved for treatment of transplant-ineligible patients with 
relapsed/refractory DLBCL (R/R DLBCL). However, the number of patients treated 
in the GO29365 trial including the extension cohort was limited, and more data 
evaluating the efficacy of this treatment regimen is needed.
METHODS: We analyzed 21 patients with R/R DLBCL to determine real-life efficacy 
and safety of Pola-BR regimen. Data of all patients entered the database of the 
NiHiL project (NCT03199066).
RESULTS: Median overall survival was 8.7 months, and progression-free survival 
3.8 months. The overall response rate was 33%. Grade 3-4 neutropenia was 
detected in 29%, thrombocytopenia in 38%, anemia in 19%, infections in 24% 
cases, and peripheral neuropathy in 5%. Discontinuation of treatment was caused 
by progression in 50%, adverse events in 31%, and intended bridging to CAR-T 
therapy in 19%.
CONCLUSION: Although the outcome of patients is worse than in GO29365 trial, the 
use of Pola-BR regimen in the real world demonstrates tolerable toxicity profile 
and efficacy in transplant-ineligible patients with R/R DLBCL. Moreover, this 
regimen might represent a perspective option as a bridge to CAR-T therapy.

Tomato is considered as one of the most grown horticultural crops having a short 
shelf-life due to its climacteric nature of ripening, susceptibility to 
postharvest microbial decay, and mechanical damage, resulting in huge 
postharvest losses. Recently, the use of edible coatings has been seen as a 
promising environment friendly and sustainable technology for preserving the 
quality attributes and prolonging the shelf-life of tomato during storage. 
Although a lot of literature is available on the aspects of edible coating for 
fresh produce, especially stone and tropical fruits, but there is no dedicated 
comprehensive review that specifically addresses the requirements of edible 
coatings for whole fresh tomato. This review aims to provide the information 
about the desirable coating property requirements specific to tomato and 
summarizes or analyzes the recent studies conducted on the application of edible 
coating on tomato. The article also deals with recent trends on utilization of 
bioactive compounds as well as nanotechnological approaches for improving the 
performance and functionality of coating materials used for tomato. However, the 
edible coating technology for tomato is still at infancy state, and adoption of 
technology on a commercial scale requires economic viability and large-scale 
consumer acceptability.

We provide an empirical foundation for research on the demography of loneliness 
at older ages. First, we use published life tables and data from the U.S.-based 
Health and Retirement Study for the period 2008-2016 to calculate lonely life 
expectancy for Americans aged 55 or older. Using Sullivan's method, we 
demonstrate pronounced differences in lonely life expectancy by sex, 
race/ethnicity, and educational attainment that correspond to well-established 
patterns of stratification in other dimensions of well-being. Next, we estimate 
models that decompose observed sex, racial/ethnic, and educational differences 
in three key health outcomes into the part explained (in a statistical 
accounting sense) by loneliness and the part accounted for by other factors. We 
find little evidence of an important role for loneliness in understanding 
disparities in mortality and the onset of physical disability and cognitive 
impairment among Americans aged 55 or older, net of several established 
correlates of health disparities. These descriptive findings provide an 
empirical foundation for continued development of a demography of loneliness at 
older ages in response to the anticipated growth in scientific and policy 
emphasis on loneliness and the fundamental life changes that have accompanied 
the COVID-19 pandemic.

Overweight and obesity affect approximately 1/3 of children in the United States 
and are risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Progression from 
prediabetes to diabetes carries substantial long-term health burdens, 
culminating in decreased life-expectancy. Earlier development of type 2 diabetes 
is associated with poorer prognoses, and children lose glycemic control more 
rapidly than adults. Metformin is approved by the USFDA for the treatment of 
type 2 diabetes in children, has limited toxicity, and may help prevent the 
development of type 2 diabetes. The more rapid disease progression in children 
and the safety of metformin suggests that initiation of metformin treatment to 
children with prediabetes who have not effectively responded to lifestyle 
changes may help prevent short- and long-term health damage resulting from 
prediabetic and diabetic dysglycemia.

Preservation of health, increase in life expectancy determine the need to 
improve the effectiveness of medical recommendations, which, despite the success 
of pharmacology, are insufficient for reasons related to the low level of 
compliance with these recommendations by patients. The authors of the article 
believe that compliance is a kind of quantifiable and behaviorally realized 
reflection of therapeutic interaction, refracted through the prism of the 
patient's individual personality characteristics. Participants of the study-148 
employees of medical institutions: 12 men, 136 women, their age ranged from 27 
to 74 years. The research tool was the neuropsychological rapid method. 3 
research subgroups were formed: 27-40 years (37 people), 41-50 years (60 
people), 51 years and older (51 people). Comparison of the results of subtests 
of neuropsychological Express technique showed heterogeneous results in 
subgroups of the study. In addition, the dynamic characteristics of 
psychological processes were evaluated: depletion, inertia, impulsivity. A 
significant difference in the performance of the graphomotor test between the 
subjects of the age subgroup of 27-40 years and the subgroup of 41-50 years was 
statistically confirmed. For the qualitative performance of this simple test 
requires a sufficient level of development of all structural and functional 
components of brain functions and, in particular, the "front" function of 
programming and management and consistent organization of movements. In older 
people revealed a much greater number of errors, interruptions of the test than 
the representatives of the more "young" subgroup. Similar results were obtained 
when comparing the "young" and "old" subgroups. Despite the absence of signs of 
decompensation of concomitant pathology, representatives of the subgroups took a 
different amount of concomitant therapy. Using the scale of assessment of drug 
compliance, it was found that compliance is most reduced in the subgroup of 
41-50 years. In this subgroup, a comprehensive decrease in compliance across the 
"behavioral", "emotional", and "cognitive" domains was detected in 87.8% of 
cases, while in the younger subgroup partial non-compliance was 32.4%, in the 
older subgroup - 74.5% An analysis of the states of cognitive functions in 52 
representatives of the middle age subgroup with low compliance rates showed 
that, unlike other representatives of the same subgroup, their indices for a 
number of neuropsychological tests are close to the results of more adult 
participants in the study. Individuals demonstrating low compliance with quite 
favorable CNS resources are at risk for the formation of pathological aging.

The demand for revision knee replacement (RKR) has increased dramatically with 
rising patient life expectancy and younger recipients for primary TKR. However, 
significant challenges to RKR arise from osseous defects, reduced bone quality, 
potential bone volume loss from implant removal and the need to achieve implant 
stability. This study utilizes the outcomes of an ongoing RKR clinical trial 
using porous metaphyseal cones 3D-printed of titanium, to investigate 1) bone 
mineral density (BMD) changes in three fixation zones (epiphysis, metaphysis, 
and diaphysis) over a year and 2) the biomechanical effects of the cones at 6 
months post-surgery. It combines dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), 
computed tomography (CT) with patient-specific based finite element (FE) 
modelling. Bone loss (-0.086 ± 0.05 g/cm2) was found in most patients over the 
first year. The biomechanical assessment considered four different loading 
scenarios from standing, walking on a flat surface, and walking downstairs, to a 
simulated impact of the knee. The patient-specific FE models showed that the 
cones marginally improved the strain distribution in the bone and shared the 
induced load but played a limited role in reducing the risks of bone fracture or 
cement debonding. This technique of obtaining real live data from a randomized 
clinical trial and inserting it into an in-silico FE model is unique and 
innovative in RKR research. The tibia RKR biomechanics examined open up further 
possibilities, allowing the in-silico testing of prototypes and implant 
combinations without putting patients at risk as per the recommended IDEAL 
framework standards. This process with further improvements could allow rapid 
innovation, optimization of implant design, and improve surgical planning.

Fertility preservation in prepubertal boys is a matter that has been gaining 
ground fast during the past 20 years. As the life expectancy for childhood 
cancer survivors continues to increase (5-year survival rate>80%), and as the 
risk of permanent infertility in adulthood is still high with current treatment 
options, offering a testicular biopsy to cryopreserve immature testicular tissue 
(ITT) containing spermatogonial stem cells is now recommended as an experimental 
option for fertility preservation. Transplantation of cryopreserved testicular 
prepubertal tissue fragments back to the cured patient appears to be one of the 
most feasible and promising techniques for fertility restoration. In 2019, the 
birth of a healthy female baby rhesus monkey after intracytoplasmic sperm 
injection using spermatozoa recovered from frozen-thawed ITT autografts fueled 
the hopes of translating the technique to humans. While gonadal tissue 
autotransplantation has already been successfully achieved in clinical practice 
for females, it has never been attempted in males to date. In this work, we 
review acquired knowledge on ITT transplantation in animal models and share our 
vision on the remaining challenges to autograft currently banked human ITT 
within pilot clinical trials in the near future.

Lipofuscin is a representative biomarker of aging that is generated naturally 
over time. Remofuscin (soraprazan) improves age-related eye diseases by removing 
lipofuscin from retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. In this study, the 
effect of remofuscin on longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans and the underlying 
mechanism were investigated. The results showed that remofuscin significantly 
(p < 0.05) extended the lifespan of C. elegans (N2) compared with the negative 
control. Aging biomarkers were improved in remofuscin-treated worms. The 
expression levels of genes related to lysosomes (lipl-1 and lbp-8), a nuclear 
hormone receptor (nhr-234), fatty acid beta-oxidation (ech-9), and xenobiotic 
detoxification (cyp-34A1, cyp-35A1, cyp-35A2, cyp-35A3, cyp-35A4, cyp-35A5, 
cyp-35C1, gst-28, and gst-5) were increased in remofuscin-treated worms. 
Moreover, remofuscin failed to extend the lives of C. elegans with 
loss-of-function mutations (lipl-1, lbp-8, nhr-234, nhr-49, nhr-8, cyp-35A1, 
cyp-35A2, cyp-35A3, cyp-35A5, and gst-5), suggesting that these genes are 
associated with lifespan extension in remofuscin-treated C. elegans. In 
conclusion, remofuscin activates the lysosome-to-nucleus pathway in C. elegans, 
thereby increasing the expression levels of xenobiotic detoxification genes 
resulted in extending their lifespan.

Suitable animal models are essential for translational research, especially in 
the case of complex, multifactorial conditions, such as obesity. The non-inbred 
mouse (Mus musculus) line Titan, also known as DU6, is one of the world's 
longest selection experiments for high body mass and was previously described as 
a model for metabolic healthy (benign) obesity. The present study further 
characterizes the geno- and phenotypes of this non-inbred mouse line and tests 
its suitability as an interventional obesity model. In contrast to previous 
findings, our data suggest that Titan mice are metabolically unhealthy obese and 
short-lived. Line-specific patterns of genetic invariability are in accordance 
with observed phenotypic traits. Titan mice also show modifications in the liver 
transcriptome, proteome, and epigenome linked to metabolic (dys)regulations. 
Importantly, dietary intervention partially reversed the metabolic phenotype in 
Titan mice and significantly extended their life expectancy. Therefore, the 
Titan mouse line is a valuable resource for translational and interventional 
obesity research.

BACKGROUND: Tranexamic acid reduces head injury deaths in patients with CT scan 
evidence of intracranial bleeding after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). 
However, the cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid for people with mild TBI in 
the pre-hospital setting, prior to CT scanning, is uncertain. A large randomised 
controlled trial (CRASH-4) is planned to address this issue, but the economic 
justification for it has not been established. The aim of the analysis was to 
estimate the likelihood of tranexamic acid being cost-effective given current 
evidence, the treatment effects required for cost-effectiveness, and the 
expected value of performing further research.
METHODS: An early economic decision model compared usual care for mild TBI with 
and without tranexamic acid, for adults aged 70 and above. The evaluation was 
performed from a UK healthcare perspective over a lifetime time horizon, with 
costs reported in 2020 pounds (GBP) and outcomes reported as quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs). All analyses used a £20,000 per QALY cost-effectiveness 
threshold.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, tranexamic acid was associated with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £4885 per QALY gained, but the 
likelihood of it being cost-effective was highly dependent on the all-cause 
mortality treatment effect. The value of perfect information was £22.4 million, 
and the value of perfect information for parameters that could be collected in a 
trial was £21.9 million. The all-cause mortality risk ratio for tranexamic acid 
and the functional outcomes following TBI had the most impact on 
cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a high degree of uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness of 
tranexamic acid for older adults experiencing mild TBI, meaning there is a high 
value of performing future research in the UK. The value in a global context is 
likely to be far higher.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease 
characterized by vasoconstriction and remodeling of the pulmonary vessels. Risk 
stratification in PAH could potentially be improved by including novel 
biomarkers related to PAH pathobiology. We aimed to investigate the relationship 
between extracellular matrix (ECM)-related proteins, survival, and European 
Society of Cardiology and European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS) risk 
stratification scores in patients with PAH. Plasma samples and hemodynamics were 
collected from PAH patients during right heart catheterizations at diagnosis 
(n = 48) and early follow-up, after treatment initiation (n = 33). Plasma levels 
of 14 ECM-related proteins, with altered levels in PAH compared to healthy 
controls, were analyzed with proximity extension assays, and related to 
hemodynamics, transplant-free survival time, and ESC/ERS risk score. Glypican-1 
levels were higher before versus after treatment initiation (p = 0.048). PAH 
patients with high plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -2, MMP-7, 
MMP-9, MMP-12, perlecan, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 4 (TIMP-4) at 
baseline, had worse transplant-free survival (p < 0.03) than patients with low 
levels. Hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) was for MMP-2 1.126 
(1.011-1.255), perlecan 1.0099 (1.0004-1.0196), and TIMP-4 1.037 (1.003-1.071) 
in age and sex-adjusted Cox-regression model. MMP-2 correlated with ESC/ERS risk 
scores (r s = 0.34, p = 0.019), mean right atrial pressure (r s = 0.44, 
p = 0.002), NT-proBNP (r s = 0.49, p ≤ 0.001), and six-minute walking distance
