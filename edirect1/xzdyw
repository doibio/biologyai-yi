Decapod iridescent virus 1 (DIV1), White spot syndrome virus (WSSV), and 
Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) pose serious threats to the shrimp farming. To 
date, early detection remains an important way to control the occurrence and 
diffusion of these pathogens. Here, we developed for the first time, a 
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based microfluidic chip detection 
system, which could detect DIV1, WSSV, and EHP simultaneously. The limits of 
detection (LoD) of the system were 10 copies/reaction for EHP and DIV1, and 102 
copies/reaction for WSSV. The entire detection procedure could be completed 
rapidly in 40 min at 63°C with 100% specificity and had no cross-reaction with 
other common shrimp pathogens. This newly established method was further 
validated using 94 Penaeus vannamei clinical samples, which were comparable to a 
typical qPCR assay and revealed good stability and reproducibility. These 
results illustrate that this LAMP microfluidic chip detection system allows 
rapid triplex pathogen analysis and could satisfy the demands of the field and 
routine diagnoses in aquaculture.

BACKGROUND: Effective training and retraining may be key to good quality 
paediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (pCPR). PCPR skills decay within months 
after training, making the current retraining intervals ineffective. 
Establishing an effective retraining strategy is fundamental to improve quality 
of performance and potentially enhance patient outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the intervals and strategies of formal paediatric 
resuscitation retraining provided to healthcare professionals, and the 
associated outcomes including patient outcomes, quality of performance, 
retention of knowledge and skills and rescuer's confidence.
METHODS: This review was drafted and reported using the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR). PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, Embase, CINAHL Complete, ERIC and Web 
of Science were searched and studies addressing the PICOST question were 
selected.
RESULTS: The results indicate complex data due to significant heterogeneity 
among study findings in relation to study design, retraining strategies, outcome 
measures and length of intervention. Out of 4706 studies identified, 21 were 
included with most of them opting for monthly or more frequent retraining 
sessions. The length of intervention ranged from 2-minutes up to 3.5 hours, with 
most studies selecting shorter durations (<1h). All studies pointed to the 
importance of regular retraining sessions for acquisition and retention of pCPR 
skills.
CONCLUSIONS: Brief and frequent pCPR retraining may result in more successful 
skill retention and consequent higher-quality performance. There is no strong 
evidence regarding the ideal retraining schedule however, with as little as two 
minutes of refresher training every month, there is the potential to increase 
pCPR performance and retain the skills for longer.

Improved methods for molecular analyses are obviously central for medical 
research. I will describe herein our work developing tools to reveal molecular 
states in health and disease. I will recount how I got started in this endeavor, 
and how our early work characterizing genetic variation led onto high-throughput 
protein measurements and to techniques for imaging the distribution of proteins 
and their activity states in tissues. I will also describe a more recent 
technique to measure even exceedingly rare genetic variants in order to monitor 
recurrence of disease for tumor patients.

BACKGROUND: Progression of freezing of gait (FOG), a common pathological gait in 
Parkinson's disease (PD), has been shown to be an important risk factor for 
falls, loss of independent living ability, and reduced quality of life. However, 
previous evidence indicated poor efficacy of medicine and surgery in treating 
FOG in patients with PD. Music-based movement therapy (MMT), which entails 
listening to music while exercising, has been proposed as a treatment to improve 
patients' motor function, emotions, and physiological activity. In recent years, 
MMT has been widely used to treat movement disorders in neurological diseases 
with promising results. Results from our earlier pilot study revealed that MMT 
could relieve FOG and improve the quality of life for patients with PD.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of MMT on FOG in patients with PD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, evaluator-blinded, randomized 
controlled study. A total of 81 participants were randomly divided into 
music-based movement therapy group (MMT, n = 27), exercise therapy group (ET, n 
= 27), and control group (n = 27). Participants in the MMT group were treated 
with MMT five times (1 h at a time) every week for 4 weeks. Subjects in the ET 
group were intervened in the same way as the MMT group, but without music. 
Routine rehabilitation treatment was performed on participants in all groups. 
The primary outcome was the change of FOG in patients with PD. Secondary 
evaluation indicators included FOG-Questionnaire (FOG-Q) and the comprehensive 
motor function.
RESULTS: After 4 weeks of intervention, the double support time, the cadence, 
the max flexion of knee in stance, the max hip extension, the flexion moment of 
knee in stance, the comprehensive motor function (UPDRS Part III gait-related 
items total score, arising from chair, freezing of gait, postural stability, 
posture, MDS-UPDRS Part II gait-related items total score, getting out of bed/a 
car/deep chair, walking and balance, freezing), and the FOG-Q in the MMT group 
were lower than that in the control group and ET group (p < 0.05). The gait 
velocity, the max ankle dorsiflexion in stance, ankle range of motion (ROM) 
during push-off, ankle ROM over gait cycle, the knee ROM over gait cycle, and 
the max extensor moment in stance (ankle, knee) in the MMT group were higher 
than that in the control group and ET group (p < 0.05). However, no significant 
difference was reported between the control group and ET group (p > 0.05). The 
stride length and hip ROM over gait cycle in the MMT group were higher than that 
in the control group (p < 0.05), and the max knee extension in stance in the MMT 
group was lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, there 
was no significant difference between the ET group and MMT group (p > 0.05) or 
control group (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: MMT improved gait disorders in PD patients with FOG, thereby 
improving their comprehensive motor function.

There has been a growing trend in health spending and renewable energy 
consumption in China over the past few decades, which has positive implications 
for health outcomes, such as life expectancy. Therefore, the main objective of 
this study is to empirically analyze the impact of health expenditures and 
renewable energy on life expectancy in China. We used the time series data from 
2000Q1 to 2020Q4 and applied the VECM approach for the data analysis. The 
results of this study suggest a long run association between health spending, 
life expectancy and renewable energy. The increase in health spending improves 
life expectancy, while renewable energy consumption also positively affects life 
expectancy in China. Therefore, the government should allocate sufficient 
funding to the health sector in order to attain higher life expectancy in the 
country. In addition, the government should also provide incentives for the 
consumption and production of renewable energy, which could help to achieve the 
sustainable development goal and life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition among children has lifelong implications, its outcomes 
not only cover the whole life but also transfer from one generation to another 
generation. Most studies conducted before focused on undernutrition in pregnant 
mothers and children less than 5 years of age, whereas school-age children are 
often omitted from health and nutrition surveys or surveillance. In Northwest 
Ethiopia, particularly in the study area, the community levels nutritional 
status of school-age is not well studied and documented. Therefore, this study 
aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of the under-nutritional status 
of school-age children in Gondar Zuria District, Northwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was employed with 364 
respondents from January to April 2020. Data entered using Epi Data software 
version 3.1. Standard deviation scores were obtained by the world health 
organization Anthro Plus software to determine the nutritional status of 
children, and further analysis was done by using STATA version 14 software. 
Adjusted odds ratio with its corresponding 95 % confidence interval was used to 
declare statistically significant variables.
RESULTS: The prevalence of overall under-nutrition was 71.98% (95%, CI: 67%-76%) 
from which, 43.13% (95%, CI: 38%-48%) were stunted, 40.93% (95%, CI: 35%-46%) 
were under-weight, and 35.44% (95%, CI: 30%-40%) were wasted. Child age [AOR = 
0.30, 95% CI (0.13-0.68)], food insecurity [AOR = 2.24, 95% CI (1.03-4.83)], 
good knowledge of mother/care giver [AOR = 0.40, 95% CI (0.17-0.92)], having 
larger family size (Tzioumis and Adair, 2014; Wolde et al., 2015; Mohammed 
et al., 2019) [6-8] [AOR = 2.92, 95% CI (1.29-6.58)], and unprotected drinking 
water sources [AOR = 2.84, 95% CI (1.00-8.06)] were the predictors of 
under-nutrition.
CONCLUSION: According to the world health organization cut-offs, the prevalence 
of overall under-nutrition in the study area was very high. Child age, food 
insecurity, knowledge of mother/caregiver, having a larger family size, and 
unprotected drinking water sources were the predictors of under-nutrition. The 
district offices should give attention to the improvement of the food security 
status of the community, and give priority to the availability and accessibility 
of drinking water sources, particularly pipe water sources. Special attention to 
older age groups of children is important to control the prevalence of 
under-nutrition.

Ligating two or more DNA fragments is a regular operation for the subcloning and 
the engineering of vectors. The overlap extension PCR serves as a 
straightforward method to solve this issue. However, it takes a relatively long 
time to design the appropriate overlapping primers and the primers for the 
full-length sequence, and there has not been a professional offline software for 
such kind of primer design. Here, we propose a Python script to search, 
calculate and sort thousands of combinations of primers for users according to 
the predefined parameters. The results of script running and experimental 
validation show that this script is capable of generating the optimal pairs of 
primers based on the proper melting temperatures and lengths of the primers, 
which facilitates gene modification in research.

A multidisciplinary panel of experts and cancer patients developed a position 
paper to highlight recent evidence on "cancer cure" (ie, the possibility of 
achieving the same life expectancy as the general population) and discuss the 
consequences of this concept on follow-up and rehabilitation strategies. The aim 
is to inform clinicians, patients, and health-care policy makers about 
strategies of survivorship care for cured cancer patients and consequences 
impacting patient lives, spurring public health authorities and research 
organizations to implement resources to the purpose. Two identifiable, 
measurable, and reproducible indicators of cancer cure are presented. Cure 
fraction (CF) is >60% for breast and prostate cancer patients, >50% for 
colorectal cancer patients, and >70% for patients with melanoma, Hodgkin 
lymphoma, and cancers of corpus uteri, testis (>90%), and thyroid. CF was >65% 
for patients diagnosed at ages 15-44 years and 30% for those aged 65-74 years. 
Time-to-cure was consistently <1 year for thyroid and testicular cancer patients 
and <10 years for patients with colorectal and cervical cancers, melanoma, and 
Hodgkin lymphoma. The working group agrees that the evidence allows risk 
stratification of cancer patients and implementation of personalized care models 
for timely diagnosis, as well as treatment of possible cancer relapses or 
related long-term complications, and preventive measures aimed at maintaining 
health status of cured patients. These aspects should be integrated to produce 
an appropriate follow-up program and survivorship care plan(s), avoiding stigma 
and supporting return to work, to a reproductive life, and full rehabilitation. 
The "right to be forgotten" law, adopted to date only in a few European 
countries, may contribute to these efforts for cured patients.

The current study aimed to incorporate Lactobacillus acidophilus, 
Limosilactobacillus reuteri, Lacticaseibacillus casei, and Lacticaseibacillus 
rhamnosus (~10 log CFU/ml) into gelatin‑sodium alginate nanofibers via 
electrospinning process in order to investigate the influence of fabricated mats 
on the growth of food-related pathogenic bacteria and shelf-life extension of 
refrigerated silver carp fillets in a two-week period. The strain-loaded 
nanofibers exhibited lower water vapor permeability, swelling index, moisture 
content, and tensile strength than the straight nanofibers (P < 0.05). The 
survival order of probiotics in nanofibers stored at 4, 25, and 37 °C for 
14 days are as follows: L. acidophilus (8.15-9.35 log CFU/g) > L. reuteri 
(7.42-9.24 log CFU/g) > L. casei (7.41-9.13 log CFU/g) > L. rhamnosus (7.37-8.92 
log CFU/g). The probiotic mats significantly delayed the growth of Vibrio 
parahaemolyticus, Salmonella Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria 
monocytogenes in silver carp fillets in comparison with the unpackaged sample 
(P < 0.05). Moreover, the designated nanofibers improved the bacterial, 
chemical, and sensory properties of treated samples in comparison with the 
unpackaged samples throughout the study period. Our findings indicate that 
gelatin‑sodium alginate nanofibers are a suitable platform for the protection of 
living probiotics and present an alternative procedure for retarding the growth 
of food-borne pathogens and extending the shelf-life of fresh carp fillets under 
refrigerated storage conditions.

BCL2-like 10 (BCL2L10) is abundantly expressed in mammalian oocytes and plays a 
crucial role in the completion of oocyte meiosis. However, the expression 
patterns of BCL2L10 and its biological functions during preimplantation 
development have not been well characterized. Here, we investigated the 
spatiotemporal expressions of Bcl2l10 during mouse preimplantation development 
using RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence and its biological function using siRNA and 
morpholino injection into pronuclear embryos. Results from RT-qPCR showed that 
Bcl2l10 was highly expressed in the metaphase Ⅱ-stage oocytes and 
pronuclear-stage embryos, but expression markedly decreased from the two-cell 
stage onwards and was no longer detected at the four-cell stage and beyond. 
Immunofluorescence staining showed that BCL2L10 was detectable throughout 
preimplantation development and localized in the cytoplasm and nuclei. Knocking 
down Bcl2l10 resulted in a reduced blastocyst formation rate (P < 0.01) and 
decreased expression of OCT4, NANOG, and SOX17 (P < 0.05). We concluded that the 
role of BCL2L10 is strongly associated with developmental competence of 
preimplantation mouse embryos.

IMPORTANCE: In the Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart 
Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-Preserved), empagliflozin 
significantly reduced hospitalizations for heart failure while improving 
patient-reported health status compared with placebo. The long-term 
cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin among patients who have heart failure with 
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin in patients with 
HFpEF.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cost-effectiveness analysis performed 
from October 2021 to April 2022 included a Markov model using estimates of 
treatment efficacy, event probabilities, and utilities from EMPEROR-Preserved 
and published literature. Costs were derived from national surveys and pricing 
data sets. Quality of life was imputed from a heart failure-specific 
quality-of-life measure. Two analyses were performed, with and without a 
treatment effect on cardiovascular mortality. Subgroup analyses were based on 
diabetes status, ejection fraction, and health status impairment due to heart 
failure. The model reproduced the event rates and risk reduction with 
empagliflozin observed in EMPEROR-Preserved over 26 months of follow-up; future 
projections extended across the lifetime of patients.
EXPOSURES: Empagliflozin or standard of care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospitalizations for heart failure, life-years, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and lifetime incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: A total of 5988 patients were included in the analysis, with a mean age 
of 72 years, New York Heart Association class II to IV heart failure, and left 
ventricular ejection fraction greater than 40%. At the Federal Supply Schedule 
price of $327 per month, empagliflozin yielded 0.06 additional QALYs and $26 257 
incremental costs compared with standard of care, producing a cost per QALY 
gained of $437 442. Incremental costs consisted of total drug costs of $29 586 
and savings of $3329 from reduced hospitalizations for heart failure. 
Cost-effectiveness was similar across subgroups. The results were most sensitive 
to the monthly cost, quality-of-life benefit, and mortality effect of 
empagliflozin. A price reduction to $153 per month, incremental utility of 0.02, 
or 8% reduction in cardiovascular mortality would bring empagliflozin to 
$180 000 per QALY gained, the threshold for intermediate value. Using Medicare 
Part D monthly pricing of $375 after rebates and $511 before rebates, 
empagliflozin would remain low value at $509 636 and $710 825 per QALY gained, 
respectively. Cost-effectiveness estimates were robust to variation in the 
frequency and disutility of heart failure hospitalizations.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this economic evaluation, based on current 
cost-effectiveness benchmarks, empagliflozin provides low economic value 
compared with standard of care for HFpEF, largely due to its lack of efficacy on 
mortality and small benefit on quality of life.

IMPORTANCE: In the US, Black individuals die younger than White individuals and 
have less household wealth, a legacy of slavery, ongoing discrimination, and 
discriminatory public policies. The role of wealth inequality in mediating 
racial health inequities is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the contribution of wealth inequities to the longevity gap 
that exists between Black and White individuals in the US and to model the 
potential effects of reparations payments on this gap.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study analyzed the association 
between wealth and survival among participants in the Health and Retirement 
Study, a nationally representative panel study of community-dwelling 
noninstitutionalized US adults 50 years or older that assessed data collected 
from April 1992 to July 2019. Participants included 7339 non-Hispanic Black 
(hereinafter Black) and 26 162 non-Hispanic White (hereinafter White) 
respondents. Data were analyzed from January 1 to September 17, 2022.
EXPOSURES: Household wealth, the sum of all assets (including real estate, 
vehicles, and investments), minus the value of debts.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality by the 
end of survey follow-up in 2018. Using parametric survival models, the 
associations among household wealth, race, and survival were evaluated, 
adjusting for age, sex, number of household members, and marital status. 
Additional models controlled for educational level and income. The survival 
effects of eliminating the current mean wealth gap with reparations payments 
($828 055 per household) were simulated.
RESULTS: Of the 33 501 individuals in the sample, a weighted 50.1% were women, 
and weighted mean (SD) age at study entry was 59.3 (11.1) years. Black 
participants' median life expectancy was 77.5 (95% CI, 77.0-78.2) years, 4 years 
shorter than the median life expectancy for White participants (81.5 [95% CI, 
81.2-81.8] years). Adjusting for demographic variables, Black participants had a 
hazard ratio for death of 1.26 (95% CI, 1.18-1.34) compared with White 
participants. After adjusting for differences in wealth, survival did not differ 
significantly by race (hazard ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.92-1.08]). In simulations, 
reparations to close the mean racial wealth gap were associated with reductions 
in the longevity gap by 65.0% to 102.5%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study suggest that 
differences in wealth are associated with the longevity gap that exists between 
Black and White individuals in the US. Reparations payments to eliminate the 
racial wealth gap might substantially narrow racial inequities in mortality.

The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically in recent decades 
worldwide. An increase in the prevalence of obesity has also been observed among 
people living with HIV (PLHIV) in high and low incomes countries. Antiretroviral 
therapy (ART), by controlling the viral load (VL) and restoring cellular 
immunity, has improved the health status and life expectancy in PLHIV. However, 
the risk of developing non-AIDS events (NAEs) remains higher than the general 
population. Therefore, specific attention is given to managing risk factors 
associated with NAEs during the follow-up of PLHIV, including obesity. Factors 
related to weight gain in PLHIV include demographic factors, HIV disease-related 
factors, and ART-associated factors. In naive PLHIV, weight gain after the 
initiation of ART is expected. The weight gains observed are generally not 
severe even if there appear to be risk factors such as the advanced stage of 
disease (low CD4 cells count and high VL), female sex, black race, and taking 
integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) associated or not with tenofovir 
alafenamide fumarate (TAF). The role of each antiretroviral drug per-se remains 
to clarify. As INSTI ± TAF has been associated with significant weight gain, 
further research is needed to identify the individual-level factors predictive 
of weight gain, the mechanisms of ART-associated weight gain and the clinical 
relevance of this weight gain. As PLHIV survive longer on effective ART, the 
prevention and management of NAEs will remain a challenge for healthcare 
providers.

A new multifunctional film with active and intelligent effects was developed by 
incorporating curcumin-clove oil emulsion into natural materials. The basic 
properties, functional characteristics, and pH/NH3-sensitivity of films were 
investigated, and then these films were applied to extend shelf-life and monitor 
freshness of meat. Curcumin solution and emulsion illustrated significant color 
variations at different pH values. The incorporation of emulsion improved the 
UV-vis barrier and water resistance properties of films, which blocked most of 
UV-light and its water contact angle reached 100.03°. Meanwhile, the films had 
stronger mechanical strength and higher thermal stability, with elongation at 
break reaching 79.18 % and the maximum degradation temperature rising to 316 °C. 
Moreover, emulsion made films have a slow-release effect on clove oil, which not 
only enhanced the antioxidant property but also significantly improved their 
antibacterial activity. Additionally, the multifunctional films presented a 
significant color response to acidic/alkaline environments over a short time 
interval and could be easily identified by naked eyes. Finally, the films 
effectively extended the shelf-life of fresh meat by 3 days at 4 °C and visually 
monitored freshness through color changes in real-time. This knowledge provides 
insights and ideas for the development of novel food packaging with both active 
and intelligent functions.

OBJECTIVES: Rabies is an acute lethal infectious disease caused by a lyssavirus 
infection. In 2018, the World Health Organization proposed a global strategic 
plan to end human rabies deaths by 2030. However, systematic studies on the 
global rabies disease burden and epidemiological trends are scarce.
METHODS: We extracted the disease burden and epidemiological data of rabies 
worldwide in the preceding 30 years from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 
and performed a comprehensive analysis.
RESULTS: In 2019, the incident cases of rabies worldwide were 14,075.51 (95% 
uncertainty interval: 6124.33-21,618.11), and the number of deaths was 13,743.44 
(95% uncertainty interval: 6019.13-17,938.53), both of which were lower than 
that in 1990. With the improvement of the sociodemographic index, the incident 
cases, the number of deaths, age-standardized incidence rate, age-standardized 
incidence death rate, and disability-adjusted life years of rabies all showed 
downward trends. Adolescents and adults aged <50 years represented the majority 
of rabies cases worldwide.
CONCLUSION: The global disease burden of rabies has declined over the past 30 
years. Furthermore, the disease burden of rabies was closely related to the 
sociodemographic index level.

Review of the utility of routine mortality reviews among deaths on General 
Internal Medicine wards in a Canadian tertiary care hospital.

BACKGROUND: Hospital morbidity and mortality reviews are common quality 
assurance activities, intended to uncover latent or unrecognised systemic issues 
that contribute to preventable adverse events and patient harm. Mortality 
reviews may be routinely mandated by hospital policy or for accreditation 
purposes. However, patients under the care of certain specialties, such as 
general internal medicine (GIM), are affected by a substantial burden of chronic 
disease, advanced age, frailty or limited life expectancy. Many of their deaths 
could be viewed as reasonably foreseeable, and unrelated to poor-quality care.
METHODS: We sought to determine how frequently postmortem chart reviews for 
hospitalised GIM patients at our tertiary care centre in Canada would uncover 
patient safety or quality of care issues that directly led to these patients' 
deaths. We reviewed the charts of all patients who died while admitted to the 
GIM admitting service over a 12-month time period between 1 July 2020 and 30 
June 2021.
RESULTS: We found that in only 2% of cases was a clinical adverse event detected 
that directly contributed to a poor or unexpected outcome for the patient, and 
of those cases, more than half were related to unfortunate nosocomial 
transmission of COVID-19 infection.
CONCLUSION: Due to an overall low yield, we discourage routine mortality chart 
reviews for general medical patients, and instead suggest that organisations 
focus on strategies to recognise and capture safety incidents that may not 
necessarily result in death.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) pathophysiology is hallmarked by excessive inflammation and 
the inability to resolve lung infections, contributing to morbidity and 
eventually mortality. Paradoxically, despite a robust inflammatory response, CF 
lungs fail to clear bacteria and are susceptible to chronic infections. Impaired 
mucociliary transport plays a critical role in chronic infection but the immune 
mechanisms contributing to the adaptation of bacteria to the lung 
microenvironment is not clear. CFTR modulator therapy has advanced CF life 
expectancy opening up the need to understand changes in immunity as CF patients 
age. Here, we have summarized the current understanding of immune dysregulation 
in CF.
