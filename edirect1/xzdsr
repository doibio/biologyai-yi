most prevalent in Western sub-Saharan Africa, High-income North America and 
Oceania in 2019. The burden of SIDS was higher in males than females 
consistently from 1990 to 2019. Higher SDI and income level was associated with 
lower burden of SIDS; furthermore, countries with higher SDI and income had 
greater decreases in SIDS burden from 1990 to 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of SIDS has decreased drastically from 1990 to 2019. 
However, the improvements have occurred disproportionately between regions and 
SDI levels. Focused preventive efforts in under-resourced populations are 
needed.

With the increase of global population, people's life expectancy is growing as 
well. Humans tend to live more active lifestyles and, therefore, trauma 
generated large defects become more common. Instances of tumour resection or 
pathological conditions and complex orthopaedic issues occur more frequently 
increasing necessity for bone substitutes. Composition of calcium phosphate 
cements (CPCs) is comparable to the chemical structure of bone minerals. Their 
ability to self-set and resorb in vivo secures a variety of potential 
applications in bone regeneration. Despite the years-long research and several 
products already reaching the market, finding the right properties for calcium 
phosphate cement to be osteoinductive and both injectable and suitable for 
clinical use is still a sudoku. This article is focused on injectable, porous 
CPCs, reviewing the latest developments on the path toward finding 
osteoinductive material, which is suitable for injection.

Achieving a high quality of life is dependent upon how individuals face 
adversity. Positive psychological interventions are well-suited to support 
coping efforts; however, experimental research is limited. The purpose of the 
current research was to examine whether different savoring interventions could 
increase important coping resources (i.e., positive emotions) in response to a 
social-evaluative hassle. We completed an experimental mixed subject design 
study with a university student sample. All participants completed a hassle 
induction task and were then randomly assigned into different intervention 
groups. Positive emotion ratings were collected at three points in time 
(baseline, post-induction task, post-intervention). Results revealed a 
significant time x intervention interaction effect, such that individuals in the 
savoring the moment intervention reported higher levels of positive emotions (at 
post-intervention) compared to individuals assigned to the true control group, 
guided imagery control group, and savoring through reminiscence intervention. 
Such findings represent a significant extension to savoring theory and offer 
support for savoring the moment exercises as a primary prevention strategy to 
bolster effective responses to social-evaluative hassles.

BACKGROUND: The initiation of exercise during rehabilitation at the subacute 
stage could provide stroke survivors with an approach to recovery that 
capitalizes on unique physiological conditions and promotes spontaneous 
recovery. We aimed to examine the effects of a tailored sitting Tai Chi program 
on recovery outcomes among subacute stroke survivors.
METHODS: We conducted a 12-week assessor-blind randomized controlled trial in 
China. Subacute stroke survivor-caregiver dyads were recruited and randomly 
assigned to either the sitting Tai Chi group (n=80) or attention control group 
(n=80). Outcomes including upper limb function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper 
Extremity & Wolf Motor Function Test), balance control (Berg Balance Scale), 
sitting balance control (Trunk Impairment Scale), depressive symptoms (Geriatric 
Depression Scale Short Form), shoulder range of motion, shoulder pain 
(ShoulderQ), activities of daily living (Modified Barthel Index), and quality of 
life (Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale) were measured at baseline, 
in-process, immediately post, and 4-week postintervention.
RESULTS: Immediately postintervention, the sitting Tai Chi group (n=69) showed 
significant upper limb function improvement in the primary outcomes including 
the performance time (regression coefficient of the group-by-time interaction, 
B=-21.415 [95% CI, -31.000 to -11.831]) and functional ability (B=10.146 [95% 
CI, 4.886-15.406]) domains of the Wolf Motor Function Test, balance control (B, 
4.972 [95% CI, 1.356-8.588]), and sitting balance control (B=4.397 [95% CI, 
2.699-6.096]). Compared with the control group (n=65), improvements were also 
observed in secondary outcomes including depressive symptoms (B=-1.626 [95% CI, 
-2.304 to -0.948]), shoulder extension (B=4.518 [95% CI, 0.893-8.144]), 
activities of daily living (B=5.510 [95% CI, 0.450-10.569]), and quality of life 
(B=15.680 [95% CI, 7.255-24.105]).
CONCLUSIONS: The results support the effectiveness of a tailored sitting Tai Chi 
program in improving recovery outcomes among subacute stroke survivors and 
provide additional knowledge to support the clinical implementation of such a 
program.

Lactation is a critical time in mammalian development, where maternal factors 
shape offspring outcomes. In this scoping review, we discuss current literature 
concerning maternal factors that influence lactation biology and highlight 
important associations between changes in milk composition and offspring 
outcomes. Specifically, we explore maternal nutritional, psychosocial, and 
environmental exposures that influence non-nutritive bioactive components in 
milk and their links to offspring growth, development, metabolic, and behavioral 
outcomes. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping 
Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Predetermined eligibility criteria were used to 
analyze 3,275 papers, and the final review included 40 primary research 
articles. Outcomes of this review identify maternal obesity to be a leading 
maternal factor influencing the non-nutritive bioactive composition of milk with 
notable links to offspring outcomes. Offspring growth and development are the 
most common modes of programming associated with changes in non-nutritive milk 
composition due to maternal factors in early life. In addition to discussing 
studies investigating these key associations, we also identify knowledge gaps in 
the current literature and suggest opportunities and considerations for future 
studies.

OBJECTIVE: Recently, a randomised controlled trial (DIRECT-MT) demonstrated that 
mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was non-inferior to MT with intravenous alteplase 
as to the functional outcomes. This study aims to investigate whether MT alone 
is cost-effective compared with MT with alteplase in China.
METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was built from the Chinese healthcare 
perspective using a lifetime horizon. Probabilities, costs and outcomes data 
were obtained from the DIRECT-MT trial and other most recent/comprehensive 
literature. Base case calculation was conducted to compare the costs and 
effectiveness between MT alone and MT with alteplase. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: MT alone had a lower cost and higher effectiveness compared with MT 
with alteplase. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that, over a 
lifetime horizon, MT alone had a 99.5% probability of being cost-effective under 
the willingness-to-pay threshold of 1× gross domestic product per capita in 
China based on data obtained from the DIRECT-MT trial. These results remained 
robust under one-way sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: MT alone was cost-effective compared with MT with alteplase in 
China. However, cautions are needed to extend this conclusion to regions outside 
of China.

The mammalian epigenome contains thousands of heterochromatin nanodomains (HNDs) 
marked by di- and trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3), which 
have a typical size of 3-10 nucleosomes. However, what governs HND location and 
extension is only partly understood. Here, we address this issue by introducing 
the chromatin hierarchical lattice framework (ChromHL) that predicts chromatin 
state patterns with single-nucleotide resolution. ChromHL is applied to analyse 
four HND types in mouse embryonic stem cells that are defined by histone 
methylases SUV39H1/2 or GLP, transcription factor ADNP or chromatin remodeller 
ATRX. We find that HND patterns can be computed from PAX3/9, ADNP and LINE1 
sequence motifs as nucleation sites and boundaries that are determined by DNA 
sequence (e.g. CTCF binding sites), cooperative interactions between nucleosomes 
as well as nucleosome-HP1 interactions. Thus, ChromHL rationalizes how patterns 
of H3K9me2/3 are established and changed via the activity of protein factors in 
processes like cell differentiation.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a multicomponent general practice intervention 
cost-effectively improves health outcomes and reduces health service use for 
patients at high risk of poor health outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING: Clustered randomised controlled trial in general practices in 
metropolitan Adelaide.
PARTICIPANTS: Three age-based groups of patients identified by their general 
practitioners as being at high risk of poor health outcomes: children and young 
people (under 18 years), adults (18-64 years) with two or more chronic diseases, 
and older people (65 years or more).
INTERVENTION: Enrolment of patients with a preferred GP, longer general practice 
appointments, and general practice follow-up within seven days of emergency 
department and hospital care episodes. Intervention practices received payment 
of $1000 per enrolled participant.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome: change in self-rated health between 
baseline and 12-month follow-up for control (usual care) and intervention 
groups.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: numbers of emergency department presentations and hospital 
admissions, Medicare specialist claims and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) 
items supplied, Health Literacy Questionnaire scores, and cost-effectiveness of 
the intervention (based on the number of quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] 
gained over 12 months, derived from EQ-5D-5L utility scores for the two adult 
groups).
RESULTS: Twenty practices with a total of 92 GPs were recruited, and 1044 
eligible patients participated. The intervention did not improve self-rated 
health (coefficient, -0.29; 95% CI, -2.32 to 1.73), nor did it have significant 
effects on the numbers of emergency department presentations (incidence rate 
ratio [IRR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.69-1.17), hospital admissions (IRR, 0.90; 95% CI, 
0.66-1.22), Medicare specialist claims (IRR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.91-1.09), or PBS 
items supplied (IRR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96-1.03), nor on Health Literacy 
Questionnaire scores. The intervention was effective in terms of QALYs gained (v 
usual care: difference, 0.032 QALYs; 95% CI, 0.001-0.063), but the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $69 585 (95% CI, $22 968-$116 201) per QALY gained, 
beyond the willingness-to-pay threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Our multicomponent intervention did not improve self-rated health, 
health service use, or health literacy. It achieved greater improvement in 
quality of life than usual care, but not cost-effectively.

Africa is a region with abundant natural resources, but the child mortality rate 
is higher. Despite World Health Organization (WHO) support, the region remained 
the highest with the number of child mortality rate. Given this fact, this study 
examines the role of environmental degradation, clean water source, and 
sanitation facilities on child mortality and life expectancy/longevity in 
Africa. To achieve this objective, we employ pooled regression and system 
generalized method of moment (S-GMM) on 33 African countries between 2000 and 
2014. We found that environmental degradation is positively related to child 
mortality and life expectancy or longevity. However, clean water sources and 
sanitation facilities help to reduce the child mortality rate and help to 
improve life expectancy. Also, we found cultural norms improve child mortality 
and life expectancy. Our results imply that African countries are benefitting 
from cultural values, clean water sources, and sanitation facilities.

Despite the overall improvement in life expectancy of patients living with 
congenital heart disease (congenital HD), disparities in morbidity and mortality 
remain throughout the lifespan. Longstanding systemic inequities, disparities in 
the social determinants of health, and the inability to obtain quality lifelong 
care contribute to poorer outcomes. To work toward health equity in populations 
with congenital HD, we must recognize the existence and strategize the 
elimination of inequities in overall congenital HD morbidity and mortality, 
disparate health care access, and overall quality of health services in the 
context of varying social determinants of health, systemic inequities, and 
structural racism. This requires critically examining multilevel contributions 
that continue to facilitate health inequities in the natural history and 
consequences of congenital HD. In this scientific statement, we focus on 
population, systemic, institutional, and individual-level contributions to 
health inequities from prenatal to adult congenital HD care. We review 
opportunities and strategies for improvement in lifelong congenital HD care 
based on current public health and scientific evidence, surgical data, 
experiences from other patient populations, and recognition of implicit bias and 
microaggressions. Furthermore, we review directions and goals for both 
quantitative and qualitative research approaches to understanding and mitigating 
health inequities in congenital HD care. Finally, we assess ways to improve the 
diversity of the congenital HD workforce as well as ethical guidance on 
addressing social determinants of health in the context of clinical care and 
research.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
intermittent electrocardiogram (ECG) screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) 
among 70-74-year old individuals in primary care. We also aimed to assess 
adherence to anticoagulants, severe bleeding, stroke and mortality among 
screening-detected AF cases at three-year follow-up.
METHODS: A post hoc analysis based on a cross-sectional screening study for AF 
among 70-74-year old patients, who were registered at a single primary care 
center, was followed for three years for mortality. Data about adherence to 
anticoagulants, incidence of stroke and severe bleeding among screening-detected 
AF cases, were collected from patient's records. Markov model and Monte Carlo 
simulation were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of the screening program.
RESULTS: The mortality rate among screening-detected AF cases (n = 16) did not 
differ compared to the 274 individuals with no AF (hazard ratio 0.86, CI 
0.12-6.44). Adherence to anticoagulants was 92%. There was no stroke or severe 
bleeding. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of screening versus no 
screening was EUR 2389/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The screening 
showed a 99% probability of being cost-effective compared to no screening at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 20,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Screening for AF among 70-74-year olds in primary care using 
intermittent ECG appears to be cost-effective at 3-year follow-up with high 
anticoagulants adherence and no increased mortality.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether dynamic torque ratios (DCR) from 
isokinetic strength assessments of eccentric knee flexors (eccKF) and concentric 
knee extensors (conKE) display differences when stratified into specific 
angle-specific DCR (DCRAST) groups. Fifty-two professional female soccer players 
(age 21.30 ± 4.44 years; height 166.56 ± 5.17 cm; mass 61.55 ± 5.73 kg) from the 
English Women's Super League completed strength assessments of both lower limbs 
on an isokinetic dynamometer at 60°∙s-1. Angle-specific torque (AST) were used 
to calculate DCRAST to create sub-groups using clustering algorithms. The 
results identified for the dominant side that the Medium DCRAST group elicited 
significantly higher conKE AST when compared to Low and High DCRAST groups at 
increased knee extension (P ≤ 0.05). For the non-dominant side, the High DCRAST 
group had significantly higher and lower eccKF and conKE AST compared to the Low 
DCRAST group at increased knee extension (P ≤ 0.05). This study highlights that 
the inclusion of AST data may subsequently help practitioners to prescribe 
exercise that promotes strength increases at targeted joint angles. In turn, 
these approaches can be used to help reduce injury risk, identify rehabilitation 
responses and help inform return to play.

Changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) are linked to aging. Here, we profile highly 
conserved CpGs in 339 predominantly female mice belonging to the BXD family for 
which we have deep longevity and genomic data. We use a 'pan-mammalian' 
microarray that provides a common platform for assaying the methylome across 
mammalian clades. We computed epigenetic clocks and tested associations with 
DNAm entropy, diet, weight, metabolic traits, and genetic variation. We describe 
the multifactorial variance of methylation at these CpGs and show that high-fat 
diet augments the age-related changes. Entropy increases with age. The 
progression to disorder, particularly at CpGs that gain methylation over time, 
was predictive of genotype-dependent life expectancy. The longer-lived BXD 
strains had comparatively lower entropy at a given age. We identified two 
genetic loci that modulate epigenetic age acceleration (EAA): one on chromosome 
(Chr) 11 that encompasses the Erbb2/Her2 oncogenic region, and the other on 
Chr19 that contains a cytochrome P450 cluster. Both loci harbor genes associated 
with EAA in humans, including STXBP4, NKX2-3, and CUTC. Transcriptome and 
proteome analyses revealed correlations with oxidation-reduction, metabolic, and 
immune response pathways. Our results highlight concordant loci for EAA in 
humans and mice, and demonstrate a tight coupling between the metabolic state 
and epigenetic aging.

United States.

Schizophrenia affects 1% of the world population and is associated with a 
reduction in life expectancy of 20 years. The increasing prevalence of both 
consumer technology and clinical-grade wearable technology offers new metrics to 
guide clinical decision-making remotely and in real time. Herein, recent 
literature is reviewed to determine the potential utility of wearables in 
schizophrenia, including their utility in diagnosis, first-episode psychosis, 
and relapse prevention and their acceptability to patients. Several studies have 
further confirmed the validity of various devices in their ability to track 
sleep-an especially useful metric in schizophrenia, as sleep disturbances may be 
predictive of disease onset or the acute worsening of psychotic symptoms. 
Through machine learning, wearable-obtained heart rate and motor activity were 
used to differentiate between controls and patients with schizophrenia. 
Wearables can capture the autonomic dysregulation that has been detected when 
patients are actively experiencing paranoia, hallucinations, or delusions. 
Multiple platforms are currently being researched, such as Health Outcomes 
Through Positive Engagement and Self-Empowerment, Mobile Therapeutic Attention 
for Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia, and Sleepsight, that may ultimately link 
patient data to clinicians. The future is bright for wearables in schizophrenia, 
as the recent literature exemplifies their potential to offer real-time insights 
to guide diagnosis and management.

BACKGROUND: The Society for Surgical Oncology's Choosing Wisely guidelines 
recommend against sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in favor of observation in 
this population. Recent analyses reveal that this has not been widely adopted. 
The purpose of this cost-effectiveness analysis is to compare the costs and 
benefits associated with observation or SLNB in women >70 years old with hormone 
receptor-positive, clinically node-negative, operable breast cancer.
METHODS: A decision tree with Markov modeling was created to compare treatment 
strategies using long-term follow-up data from clinical trials in this 
population. Costs were estimated from published literature and publicly 
available databases. Breast cancer-specific health-state utilities were derived 
from the literature and expert opinion. One-way, 2-way, and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were conducted. A structural sensitivity analysis was 
performed to assess the effect of functional status and anxiety from 
nonevaluation of the axilla on cost-effectiveness. Costs and benefits, measured 
in life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), were tabulated 
across 10, 15, and 20 years and compared using incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: SLNB is not cost-effective from the payer or societal perspectives with 
ICERs of $138,374/LY and $131,900/LY, respectively. When QALYs were considered, 
SLNB provided fewer QALYs (SLNB, 10.33 QALYs; observation, 10.53 QALYs) at a 
higher cost (SLNB, $15,845; observation, $4020). Structural sensitivity analysis 
revealed that SLNB was cost-effective in certain patients with significant 
anxiety related to axillary observation (ICER, $39,417/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Routine SLNB in this population is not cost-effective. The 
cost-effectiveness of SLNB, however, is dependent on individual patient factors, 
including functional status as well as patient preference.

An insect's fitness varies on different host plant species, and can be affected 
by previous host feeding experience. In New Zealand, Bactericera cockerelli (the 
tomato potato psyllid (TPP)) overwinter on various host species, and later 
migrate to annually grown crop host plants. How changing host plant species 
affects the insect's fitness is unknown. This study evaluated if transferring 
adult TPP from non-crop to crop host species impacts the development and 
survival of their progeny. TPP were reared on non-crop host species, boxthorn, 
poroporo, and crop host species, potato and tomato. Adults were transferred from 
non-crop to the crop host species and allowed to oviposit for 48 hours before 
being removed. The eggs and nymphs were monitored every 24 hours for the 
development and survival of each life stage. The incubation period of eggs from 
adults transferred from poroporo to tomato was 6.9 days, and for boxthorn to 
tomato was 7.2 days, and was less than for eggs of adults moved from tomato to 
tomato (9.0 days) and potato to potato (9.2 days) (P < 0.05). Nymph 
developmental time was similar for all treatments. Total development time (egg 
to adult) was shorter for the progeny of adults from poroporo transferred to 
tomato (20.5 days) than those from tomato to tomato (23.2). The survival of eggs 
did not differ across treatments. Fewer nymphs survived when adults were 
transferred from tomato to tomato (50.4%) than those from poroporo to tomato 
(92.1%) (P < 0.05). Total survival (egg to adult) was higher for progeny of 
adults transferred from poroporo to tomato (80.0%) compared to boxthorn to 
potato (35.3%), boxthorn to boxthorn (40.7%), poroporo to potato (33.9%) and 
tomato to tomato (37.6%) (P < 0.05). The implications of this shift in fitness 
are discussed in relation to TPP management.

Hong Kong SAR, China.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: COVID-19 pandemic burdens the healthcare systems, causes 
healthcare avoidance, and might worsen the outcomes of inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) management. We aimed to estimate the impact of pandemic-related 
avoidance on outpatient IBD management, and the cost-effectiveness of adding 
telemonitoring during pandemic from the perspective of Hong Kong public 
healthcare provider.
METHODS: The study was performed by a decision-analytic model to estimate the 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost of care for IBD patients before and 
during the pandemic, and to compare the cost and QALYs of adding telemonitoring 
to standard care (SC-TM) versus standard care alone (SC) for IBD patients during 
the pandemic. The sources of model inputs included publications (retrieved from 
literature search) and public data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
examine the robustness of base-case results.
RESULTS: Standard care with pandemic-related avoidance (versus without 
avoidance) lost 0.0026 QALYs at higher cost (by USD43). The 10,000 Monte Carlo 
simulations found standard care with pandemic-related avoidance lost QALYs and 
incurred higher cost in 100% and 96.82% of the time, respectively. Compared with 
the SC group, the SC-TM group saved 0.0248 QALYs and reduced cost by USD799. 
Monte Carlo simulations showed the SC-TM group gained higher QALYs at lower cost 
in 100% of 10,000 simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Standard care for IBD patients during pandemic with healthcare 
avoidance appears to worsen treatment outcomes at higher cost and lowered QALYs. 
The addition of telemonitoring to standard care seems to gain higher QALYs and 
reduce cost, and is therefore a potential cost-effective strategy for IBD 
management during the pandemic.

health-related factors as predictors of present- and future-oriented subjective 
wellbeing in junior high school students in China.

INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have examined family socioeconomic status (SES) 
and regional-level factors that predict adolescents' present subjective 
wellbeing (SWB). However, as adolescents' SWB tends to be future-oriented, this 
study examined the relationships between family SES and provincial-level 
economic, educational, and health-related factors and adolescents' present- and 
future-oriented SWB.
METHODS: The sample includes 17,341 12- to 17-year-old adolescents (Mage 
 = 13.86; SDage  = 0.79; 9056 girls and 8285 boys) from 31 different provinces 
of China. Multilevel modeling was used to analyze the data at two levels.
RESULTS: The findings showed that family SES (Level-1) was positively correlated 
with present life satisfaction (LS-P), present positive affect (PPA), hopeful 
future expectations (HFE), and positive affect toward future life (FPA), but 
negatively correlated with present negative affect (PNA) and negative affect 
toward future life (FNA). Provincial-level (Level-2) years of education per 
capita, average life expectancy, and human development index (HDI) were 
positively associated with LS-P, PPA, FPA, and HFE, and negatively associated 
with PNA; only average life expectancy was negatively associated with FNA. There 
was no association between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and SWB. 
Simple slope analyses demonstrated that, in provinces with relatively less or 
short years of education per capita, GDP per capita, average life expectancy, or 
HDI, the correlations between family SES and present- and future-oriented 
negative affect were stronger.
CONCLUSIONS: The present- and future-oriented SWB of adolescents from families 
with low SES in underdeveloped areas was relatively poor. More psychologically 
focused education activities are needed for these adolescents.

Bone metastases is a common manifestation of advanced malignant tumors. With the 
recent advances in medical technology, the survival period of patients with 
malignant tumors is prolonged, and the probability of bone metastases is 
significantly increased. Approximately 70% to 80% of patients with breast or 
prostate cancer will eventually develop bone metastases. In addition, thyroid, 
lung, and kidney carcinomas are all known to cause bone metastases, with a 30% 
to 40% incidence upon postmortem assessment. Bone metastases often lead to 
severe pain, pathological fractures, and nerve damage and have become a critical 
factor affecting the quality of life and life expectancy of cancer patients. 
Although treatments for bone metastases are diverse, choosing the appropriate 
treatment is difficult. Both conservative treatment and open surgery have 
certain drawbacks and may not be appropriate for all patients. Interventional 
procedures have the advantages of less trauma with quicker recovery and 
represent a viable alternative. This review provides updates on the progress of 
research on the interventional treatment of bone metastases and directions 
regarding relevant further studies.

BACKGROUND: Helictotrichon virescens is a perennial grass that is primarily 
distributed in high altitude areas of 2000 ~ 4500 m. It is widely cultivated in 
the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China, strongly resistant to cold, and an essential 
part of the wild herbs in this region. However, the molecular mechanism of the 
response of H. virescens to low temperature stress and the key regulatory genes 
for specific biological processes are poorly understood.
RESULTS: Physiological and transcriptome analyses were used to study the cold 
stress response mechanism in H virescens. During the low temperature stress 
period, the content of chlorophyll a and b decreased more and more with the 
delay of the treatment time. Among them, the difference between the controls was 
not significant, and the difference between the control and the treatment was 
significant. At the same time, the expression of related differential genes was 
up-regulated during low temperature treatment. In addition, the plant circadian 
pathway is crucial for their response to cold stress. The expression of 
differentially expressed genes that encode LHY and HY5 were strongly 
up-regulated during cold stress.
CONCLUSIONS: This study should help to fully understand how H. virescens 
responds to low temperatures. It answers pertinent questions in the response of 
perennial herbs to cold stress, i.e., how light and low temperature signals 
integrate to regulate plant circadian rhythms and Decrease of content of 
chlorophylls (which can be also accompanied with decrease of total quantity of 
reaction centers) leads to an increase in photosynthetic damage.

Cold storage effects on the female predatory thrips Scolothrips longicornis 
Priesner (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) fed on Tetranychus urticae Koch eggs for 
different time periods (5, 10, 20 and, 30 days) at 5 or 25 °C (control) on 
development and life table parameters were examined. Female adult duration and 
female total longevity were not influenced by the period of cold storage. The 
minimum mean female total longevity (28.1 ± 0.32 day) was observed in the 30-day 
treatment. The oviposition period decreased with increasing cold storage 
duration. All life table parameters of S. longicornis demonstrated a significant 
difference across treatments. Our results demonstrated that the female adult of 
S. longicornis could be maintained at 5 °C for 5-days with minimal reduction in 
the life-history process. This would be beneficial in the storage and mass 
production of S. longicornis in biocontrol programs involving T. urticae.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease with a high negative impact on patient's 
quality of life and a high financial burden. It is a source of chronic pain and 
affects all mammals, including humans and dogs. As the dog is a common model for 
translation research of human OA, and exploring spontaneous dog OA can improve 
the health and well-being of both humans and dogs. To describe the effect of the 
intra-articular administration of stanozolol in a naturally occurring canine OA 
model, forty canine (N = 40) hip joints were randomly assigned to receive 
stanozolol or saline (control). On treatment day and at 8, 15, 30, 90, and 
180 days post-treatment, several evaluations were conducted: weight 
distribution, joint range of motion, thigh girth, digital thermography, and 
radiographic signs. Also, synovial fluid C-reactive protein and interleukin-1 
levels were evaluated. Results from four Clinical Metrology Instruments was also 
gathered. Results were compared with Repeated Measures ANOVA, with a Huynh-Feldt 
correction, paired-samples t-test, or Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with p < 0.05. 
OA was graded as mild (90%), moderate (5%), and severe (5%), including both 
sexes. They had a mean age of 6.5 ± 2.4 years and a bodyweight of 26.7 ± 5.2 kg. 
No differences were found between groups at treatment day in all considered 
evaluations. Weight distribution showed significant improvements with stanozolol 
from 15 days (p < 0.05) up to 180 days (p < 0.01). Lower values during 
thermographic evaluation in both views taken and improved joint extension at 90 
(p = 0.02) and 180 days (p < 0.01) were observed. Pain and function scores 
improved up to 180 days. In the control group, radiographic signs progressed, in 
contrast with stanozolol. The use of stanozolol was safe and produced 
significant improvements in weight-bearing, pain score, and clinical evaluations 
in a naturally occurring canine OA model.
