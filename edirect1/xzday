OBJECTIVE: Pembrolizumab/axitinib significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) 
and progression-free survival (PFS), and increased objective response rate 
versus sunitinib in the phase III trial KEYNOTE-426 among previously untreated 
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This study assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab/axitinib versus other first-line treatments 
of advanced RCC from a US public healthcare payer perspective.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three states (progression-free, 
progressed, death) evaluated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) for pembrolizumab/axitinib and other first-line regimens: sunitinib, 
pazopanib and avelumab/axitinib in the overall population; and sunitinib, 
cabozantinib and nivolumab/ipilimumab in the subgroup with intermediate/poor 
prognostic risk. Costs of treatments, adverse events and medical resources were 
estimated. OS, PFS and treatment duration were extrapolated using parametric 
models fitted to KEYNOTE-426 data and hazard ratios from network meta-analyses. 
Utilities were derived through mixed-effects regressions of KEYNOTE-426 
EuroQol-5 Dimensions-3 Levels data.
RESULTS: In the overall population, pembrolizumab/axitinib was associated with 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $95,725/QALY versus sunitinib 
and $128,210/QALY versus pazopanib, and was dominant (lower cost, higher 
effectiveness) versus avelumab/axitinib, with incremental QALY gains of 2.73, 
2.40 and 1.80 versus these therapies, respectively. In the 
intermediate/poor-risk subgroup, base-case ICERs for pembrolizumab/axitinib were 
$101,030/QALY versus sunitinib, $6989/QALY versus cabozantinib, and 
$130,934/QALY versus nivolumab/ipilimumab, with incremental QALY gains of 2.62, 
1.78 and 1.06 versus these therapies.
CONCLUSIONS: In this economic evaluation, pembrolizumab/axitinib was associated 
with higher life expectancy and QALYs and, based on typical willingness-to-pay 
thresholds of $150,000-$180,000/QALY, was found cost-effective versus other 
first-line treatments for advanced RCC in the US.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of direct-acting antiviral (DAAs) 
treatment versus non-treatment in prisoners awaiting treatment for chronic 
hepatitis C (CHC) and to analyse the clinical and economic impact of the 
treatment on liver complications and mortality.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A lifetime Markov model was developed to simulate treatment 
and disease progression from an estimated cohort of 4,408 CHC prisoners treated 
with DAAs over 2 years (50% of patient each year) versus no treatment. In the 
treated cohort, a sustained viral response of 95% was associated. Patient 
characteristics, transition probabilities, utilities and costs (pharmacological 
and healthcare states) were obtained from published literature. The model 
estimated healthcare costs and benefits, incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) 
based on total costs and the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and avoided 
clinical events. A National Healthcare System perspective was adopted with a 3% 
annual discount rate for both costs and health outcomes. Sensitivity analyses 
were performed to assess uncertainty.
RESULTS: In the DDA treated cohort, the model estimated a decrease of 92% of 
decompensated cirrhosis and 83% of hepatocellular carcinoma, 88% liver-related 
mortality cases were reduced, 132 liver transplants were avoided. The treatment 
achieved an additional 5.0/QALYs (21.2 vs. 16.2) with an incremental cost of 
€3,473 (€24,088 vs. €20,615) per patient with an ICUR of €690 per QALY gained.
DISCUSSION: Considering the willingness-to-pay threshold used in Spain 
(€22,000-30,000/QALY), DAAs treatment for prisoners with CHC is a highly 
cost-effective strategy, reduces infection transmission, increases survival and 
reduces complications due to liver disease, as well as the cost associated with 
its management.

OBJETIVOS: Evaluar, en presos con hepatitis C crónica (HCc) pendientes de 
tratamiento, el coste-efectividad de tratarlos con antivirales de acción directa 
(AAD) frente a no tratarlos, y analizar el impacto clínico y económico del 
tratamiento sobre las complicaciones hepáticas y la mortalidad.
MATERIAL Y MÉTODO: Se desarrolló un modelo de Markov para simular el tratamiento 
y proyectar la progresión de la enfermedad de una cohorte estimada de 4.408 
reclusos con HCc tratados con AAD en dos años (el 50% cada año) frente a ningún 
tratamiento. En los tratados, se asoció una respuesta viral sostenida del 95%. 
Las características de los pacientes, las probabilidades de transición, las 
utilidades y los costes (farmacológicos y estados de salud) se obtuvieron de 
publicaciones científicas. El modelo estimó costes y resultados en salud, la 
relación coste-utilidad incremental (RCUI), a partir de los costes totales y 
años de vida ajustados por calidad (AVAC) y los eventos clínicos evitados. La 
perspectiva fue la del Sistema Nacional de Salud (SNS) y se aplicó una tasa de 
descuento anual (el 3%) para costes y resultados en salud. La robustez de los 
resultados se evaluó mediante un análisis de sensibilidad.
RESULTADOS: En la población tratada, el modelo estimó una reducción del 92% de 
los casos de cirrosis descompensada y del 83% de carcinoma hepatocelular, se 
evitaron 132 trasplantes hepáticos y disminuyó el 88% la mortalidad hepática. El 
tratamiento consiguió 5,0/AVAC adicionales (21,2 frente al 16,2), con un coste 
incremental de 3.473 euros (24.088 € frente a 20.615 €) por paciente y una RCUI 
de 690 €/AVAC ganado.
DISCUSIÓN: Considerando el umbral de disponibilidad a pagar utilizado en España 
(22.000-30.000 €/AVAC), el tratamiento con AAD en los presos con HCc es una 
estrategia altamente coste-efectiva, reduce la transmisión, aumenta la 
supervivencia y reduce las complicaciones hepáticas, así como los costes 
asociado a su manejo.

IMPORTANCE: The effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and BRAF 
and MEK inhibitors has improved advanced melanoma recovery. However, it is 
unknown whether these novel therapies are cost-effective for newly diagnosed 
advanced melanoma with unknown BRAF status.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-utility of these novel agents and their 
combinations with or without BRAF gene testing guidance for treating newly 
diagnosed advanced melanoma with unknown BRAF status.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A decision-analytic model was adopted to project the 
outcomes of 8 strategies containing different ICIs and BRAF and MEK inhibitors 
for newly diagnosed advanced melanoma with unknown BRAF pathogenic variant 
status. The key clinical data were derived from the CheckMate 067, KEYNOTE-006, 
COMBI-d, and COMBI-v trials, and the cost and health preference data were 
derived from the literature. Costs were estimated from the US payer perspective.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), and incremental net health benefits were 
calculated. Subgroup, 1-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: Of the 8 competing strategies, nivolumab plus ipilimumab without 
patient selection based on BRAF pathogenic variant testing yielded the most 
significant health outcome, and the nivolumab strategy was the cheapest option. 
The nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab plus ipilimumab strategies formed 
the cost-effective frontier, which showed the ordered ICURs were $8593 (SD, 
$592 995)/QALY for pembrolizumab vs nivolumab and $125 593 (SD, $5 751 223)/QALY 
for nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs pembrolizumab. Other strategies, including the 
BRAF testing-guided strategies (BRAF pathogenic variant testing followed by 
corresponding regimens for BRAF wild and pathogenic variant tumors), were 
dominated or extended dominated. The most influential parameters were the 
treatment efficacy of these new regimens.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For newly diagnosed advanced melanoma with unknown 
BRAF pathogenic variant status, nivolumab plus ipilimumab and pembrolizumab 
strategies are likely to be the most cost-effective options. BRAF and MEK 
inhibitors might be productively placed in a second-line setting after BRAF 
pathogenic variant is confirmed.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be engineered to have "extended half-life" and 
"catch and release" properties to improve target coverage. We have developed a 
mAb physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model that describes intracellular 
trafficking, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) recycling, and nonspecific clearance of 
mAbs. We extended this model to capture target binding as a function of target 
affinity, expression, and turnover. For mAbs engineered to have an extended 
half-life, the model was able to accurately predict the terminal half-life (82% 
within 2-fold error of the observed value) in the human FcRn transgenic (Tg32) 
homozygous mouse and human. The model also accurately captures the trend in 
pharmacokinetic and target coverage data for a set of mAbs with differing catch 
and release properties in the Tg32 mouse. The mechanistic nature of this model 
allows us to explore different engineering techniques early in drug discovery, 
potentially expanding the number of "druggable" targets.

BACKGROUND: Depression in elderly patients is common and characterized by 
anxiety symptoms and cognitive impairment. To our knowledge, no studies have yet 
investigated the process of fear extinction in these patients. We investigated 
fear extinction with a paradigm consisting of habituation, acquisition and 
extinction.
METHODS: We included three age matched (mean age: 75.7 years) groups: Late Life 
Depression (LLD, n = 33), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI, n = 39), healthy 
controls (HC, n = 39). All participants were diagnosed with a standardized 
procedure including clinical examination, CERAD cognitive test battery, as well 
as magnetic resonance imaging. Participants underwent a fear conditioning 
paradigm consisting of habituation, acquisition, and extinction. During 
acquisition, a neutral face (conditioned stimulus, CS+) was paired with an 
electrical unconditioned stimulus, whereas another face (safety stimulus, CS-) 
was unpaired. Conditioned responses were measured by US-expectancy and valence 
ratings.
RESULTS: Compared to HC, both patient groups showed a significantly lower, 
differential (CS+ vs. CS-) fear acquisition across all measurements. Patients 
with cognitive impairment showed a significantly slower extinction, which is 
characterized by higher US-expectancy and reduced positive valence for CS+. Fear 
extinction was significantly less differential (CS+ vs. CS-) in patients with 
LLD.
LIMITATIONS: Due to the cross-sectional design we cannot distinguish whether the 
observed differences in fear extinction are state or trait markers in the LLD 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrate that fear extinction is impaired in 
elderly patients with depression. These results can have influence on treatment 
strategies.

Life expectancy: what does it measure?

Life expectancy (LE) is considered a straightforward summary measure of 
mortality that comes with an implicit age standardisation. Thus, it has become 
common to present differences in mortality across populations as differences in 
LE, instead of, say, relative risks. However, most of the time LE does not quite 
provide what the term promises. LE is based on a synthetic cohort and is 
therefore not the true LE of anyone. Also, the implicit age standardisation is 
construed in such a way that it can be questioned whether it standardises age at 
all. In this paper, we examine LE from the point of view of its applicability to 
epidemiological and public health research and provide examples on the relation 
between an LE difference and a relative risk. We argue that the age 
standardisation in estimations of LE is not straightforward since it is 
standardised against different age distributions and that the translation of 
changes in age specific mortality into change in remaining LE will depend on the 
level and the distribution of mortality in the population. We conclude that LE 
is not the measure of choice in aetiological research or in research with the 
aim to identify risk factors of death, but that LE may be a compelling choice in 
public health contexts. One cannot escape the thought that the mathematical 
elegance of LE has contributed to its popularity.

A hip fracture liaison service that was implemented in 2 hospitals in Alberta, 
Canada, co-managed by a nurse and physician, was cost-effective and improved 
initiation of osteoporosis medication following hip fracture.
PURPOSE/INTRODUCTION: To determine cost-effectiveness of a 3i hip fracture 
liaison service (H-FLS) with 12-month follow-up, co-managed by a nurse and 
physician, when implemented into standard practice.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis compared those receiving the H-FLS to a 
simulated usual care group using a decision analytic model that incorporated 
Markov processes. We estimated incremental costs and effectiveness (based on 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained) using a lifetime horizon and a 
healthcare payer perspective. The H-FLS program provided data regarding 
population at risk, treatment rates, persistence, and intervention costs. We 
also performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: One thousand two hundred fifty-two patients were included in the H-FLS 
between June 2015 and March 2018; 69% were female; the average age was 
80 ± 11 years. Anti-absorptive treatment following fracture was initiated in 
59.6% (95% CI: 55.7-63.5) H-FLS patients relative to 20.9% (95% CI: 13.3-28.5%) 
receiving usual care (from our published work). Based on modeled cohort 
simulation cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), every 1000 H-FLS patients would 
experience 12 fewer hip fractures and 37 fewer total fragility fractures than 
patients receiving usual care. Over the study horizon, the H-FLS led to only a 
$54 incremental cost/patient with a modest gain of 8 QALYs/1000 patients. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $6750/QALY gained was less than 
the $27,000 cost-effectiveness threshold. Eliminating the 9-month follow-up 
resulted in incremental savings of $218/patient while also reducing 6-month 
follow-ups increased cost-savings to $378/patient. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses suggested that the H-FLS would either be cost-saving (60%) or 
cost-effective (40%).
CONCLUSION: A H-FLS implemented into standard practice significantly improved 
anti-absorptive medication use; a cohort simulation cost-effectiveness analysis 
(CEA) suggested that the H-FLS was cost-effective with potential to become 
cost-savings.

Mastocytosis is a neoplastic disease originating from tissue infiltration by 
transformed mast cells. The diagnosis requires a high grade of suspicion due to 
the large variety of presenting symptoms. The World Health Organization 
classification recognizes localized (cutaneous) and systemic forms of the 
disease, with these forms showing different degrees of aggressiveness. 
Mastocytosis is often a multiorgan disease, and its correct management requires 
a multidisciplinary team of experienced consultants to provide overall patient 
care. Bone marrow evaluation by molecular analyses, skeleton X-ray and abdominal 
scan together with allergologic and dermatologic evaluation constitute the 
essential diagnostic work-up for adult patients with mastocytosis. As clinical 
situations vary, treatment options range from the use of drugs to treat the 
symptoms, such as anti-H1 receptors and steroids, to UV irradiation, which is 
overwhelmingly used in patients with cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) or indolent 
systemic mastocytosis, to cytoreductive treatment to control life-threatening 
symptoms or organ damage in the more aggressive forms of the disease. Prognosis 
also widely differs among patients diagnosed with mastocytosis, with the 
spectrum ranging from an almost normal life expectancy for those with CM and to 
less than 1-year median overall survival for those with mast cell leukemia.

This epidemiological study of ecological type deals with the analysis of 
relationship between drinking water hardness and health status of inhabitants of 
the Slovak Republic. This relationship was investigated in two groups of more 
than 50,000 inhabitants living in 53 different municipalities. The first group 
was supplied with drinking water with low hardness, and the second group was 
supplied with drinking water with increased hardness. The health status of the 
population of both groups was monitored by means of health indicators, which 
represented 15-year average values, for 1994-2008. We investigated four major 
causes of death, namely cardiovascular, oncological, gastrointestinal and 
respiratory tract mortality, and evaluated the average life expectancy. The 
health status of inhabitants supplied with drinking water with increased 
hardness was significantly better than the health status of people supplied with 
drinking water with low hardness. For example, the relative mortality for 
cardiovascular diseases, oncological diseases, digestive tract diseases and 
respiratory diseases was 56%, 62%, 128% and 121% higher in the population 
supplied with soft drinking water compared to the population supplied with hard 
water, respectively. In addition, life expectancy was more than 4.5 years higher 
in the population supplied with hard drinking water. Our observation confirms 
the findings of previous studies on relationship between the water hardness and 
human health.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNENs) are rare neoplasms 
associated with a long life expectancy after resection. In this setting, 
patients may benefit from laparoscopic organ-sparing resection. Studies of 
laparoscopic organ-sparing resection for PNENs are limited. The aim of this 
study was to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic 
organ-sparing resection for PNENs.
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed for patients with PNENs who 
underwent laparoscopic organ-sparing pancreatectomy between March 2005 and May 
2018. The patients' demographic data, operative results, pathological reports, 
hospital courses and morbidity, mortality, and follow-up data (until August 
2018) were analysed.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included in the final analysis. There were 9 
male and 26 female patients, with a median age of 46 years (range 25-75 years). 
The mean BMI was 24.6 ± 3.3 kg/m2. Nine patients received laparoscopic 
enucleation (LE), 20 received laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal 
pancreatectomy (LSPDP), and 6 received laparoscopic central pancreatectomy. The 
operative time, intraoperative blood loss, transfusion rate, and postoperative 
hospital stay were 186.4 ± 60.2 min, 165 ± 73.0 ml, 0 days, and 9 days (range 
5-23 days), respectively. The morbidity rate, grade ≥ III complication rate, and 
grade ≥ B pancreatic fistula rate were 34.2%, 11.4%, and 8.7%, respectively, 
with no mortality. The rate of follow-up was 94.3%, and the median follow-up 
time was 55 months (range 3-158 months). One patient developed recurrence 
36 months after LE and was managed with surgical resection. The other patients 
survived without metastases or recurrence during the follow-up. One patient had 
diabetes after LSPDP, and no patients had symptoms of pancreatic exocrine 
insufficiency. Nineteen patients who underwent LSPDP (16 with the Kimura 
technique and 3 with the Warshaw technique) were followed. Normal patency of the 
splenic artery and vein was observed in 14 and 14 patients within 1 month of 
surgery and in 15 and 14 patients 6 months or more after the operation, 
respectively. Partial splenic infarction was observed in 3 patients within 
1 month of surgery and in no patients 6 months or more after the operation. 
Three patients eventually developed collateral venous vessels around the gastric 
fundus and reserved spleen, with one case of variceal bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic organ-sparing resection for selected cases of PNENs is 
safe and feasible and has favourable short- and long-term outcomes.

[Thinking inside the box: improving the lifestyle of inpatients with severe 
mental illness].

[Article in Dutch]

Deenik J, Tenback DE, Tak ECPM, Hendriksen IJM, van Harten PN.

An unhealthy lifestyle plays an important role in the substantially reduced 
life-expectancy of inpatients with severe mental illness (SMI). However, there 
is a lack of evidence on the long-term effectiveness and implementation of 
lifestyle improvements in inpatient mental healthcare.<br/> AIM: Increasing 
knowledge and understanding of (the implementation of) lifestyle changes in 
inpatients with SMI in longer-term clinical care.<br/> METHOD: Cross-sectional 
research followed by an observational study to evaluate a multidisciplinary 
lifestyle enhancing treatment (MULTI) for both changes in health-related 
outcomes after 18 months compared to treatment as usual (TAU), and the 
implementation barriers and facilitators.<br/> RESULTS: Patients were very 
sedentary and less physically active compared to people without SMI. After 18 
months, MULTI showed significant improvements in total physical activity, 
cardiometabolic risk factors, psychosocial functioning and mediation use, 
compared to TAU. Physical health did not improve in TAU. The implementation of 
MULTI was hampered by organisational factors and facilitated by positive 
attitudes of healthcare professionals and patients towards MULTI and their own 
role in it.<br/> CONCLUSION: Using a multidisciplinary integrated approach, it 
is possible to improve the lifestyle, and thus the health status, of SMI 
inpatients, within the current context of routine mental healthcare.

Subcellular structure and behaviour in fungal hyphae.

Roberson RW(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, U.S.A.

This work briefly surveys the diversity of selected subcellular characteristics 
in hyphal tip cells of the fungal kingdom (Mycota). Hyphae are filamentous cells 
that grow by tip extension. It is a highly polarised mechanism that requires a 
robust secretory system for the delivery of materials (e.g. membrane, proteins, 
cell wall materials) to sites of cell growth. These events result it the 
self-assembly of a Spitzenkörper (Spk), found most often in the Basidiomycota, 
Ascomycota, and Blastocladiomycota, or an apical vesicle crescent (AVC), present 
in the most Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota. The Spk is a complex apical body 
composed of secretory vesicles, cytoskeletal elements, and signaling proteins. 
The AVC appears less complex, though little is known of its composition other 
than secretory vesicles. Both bodies influence hyphal growth and morphogenesis. 
Other factors such as cytoskeletal functions, endocytosis, cytoplasmic flow, and 
turgor pressure are also important in sustaining hyphal growth. Clarifying 
subcellular structures, functions, and behaviours through bioimagining analysis 
are providing a better understanding of the cell biology and phylogenetic 
relationships of fungi. LAY DESCRIPTION: Fungi are most familiar to the public 
as yeast, molds, and mushrooms. They are eukaryotic organisms that inhabit 
diverse ecological niches around the world and are critical to the health of 
ecosystems performing roles in decomposition of organic matter and nutrient 
recycling (Heath, 1990). Fungi are heterotrophs, unlike plants, and comprise the 
most successful and diverse phyla of eukaryotic microbes, interacting with all 
other forms of life in associations that range from beneficial (e.g., 
mycorrhizae) to antagonistic (e.g., pathogens). Some fungi can be parasitic or 
pathogenic on plants (e.g., Cryphonectria parasitica, Magnaporthe grisea), 
insects (e.g., Beauveria bassiana, Cordyceps sp.), invertebrates (e.g., 
Drechslerella anchonia), vertebrates (e.g., Coccidioides immitis, Candia 
albicans) and other fungi (e.g., Trichoderma viride, Ampelomyces quisqualis). 
The majority of fungi, however, are saprophytes, obtaining nutrition through the 
brake down of non-living organic matter.

anticoagulants for prevention of stroke in Austrian atrial fibrillation 
patients.

OBJECTIVES: Several direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been approved by the 
European Medicines Agency since 2008. The aim of the present 
cost-effectiveness-analysis was to analyze apixaban compared to other DOACs and 
vitamin K antagonists (warfarin) in Austria.
METHODS: A cost-utility-model was developed to simulate lifetime-costs and 
quality-adjusted-life-years of DOACs and warfarin, based on a published 
Markov-Model and 23 randomized trials with 94,656 atrial-fibrillation (AF) 
patients. Each year, a patient has a probability of suffering a clinically 
relevant (extracranial) bleed, an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), an ischemic 
stroke or a myocardial infarction (MI), remaining healthy, or deceasing. 
Direct-costs (2018€) were derived from published sources from the payer's 
perspective.
RESULTS: In the base-case, warfarin had the lowest cost of 12,968 € (95%-CI±593 
€) followed by apixaban (15,269 €±661 €), edoxaban (15,534 €±641 €), dabigatran 
(15,687 €±667 €), and rivaroxaban (17,522 €±764 €). Apixaban had the highest 
quality-adjusted-life-years estimate at 5.45 (SD, 0.06). In a Monte-Carlo 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, apixaban was cost-effective vs. edoxaban, 
dabigatran, warfarin, and rivaroxaban in 85.6%, 79.0%, 76.4%, and 61.2% of the 
simulations, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In patients with AF and an increased risk of stroke, prophylaxis 
with apixaban was highly cost-effective from the perspective of the Austrian 
health-care system.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of single pill fixed dose triple 
combination therapy vs. free triple combination therapy for the prevention of 
cardiovascular events among patients with hypertension.
METHODS: A Markov model with a five year cycle was constructed. Two decision 
models incorporating strict and more relaxed adherence definitions estimated 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and health-care costs for single pill fixed 
triple combination therapy vs. free-drug combination therapy.
RESULTS: When the strict adherence measurement criteria were applied, the total 
QALYs loss and cost/patient were 6.38 QALYs, $486,026.20 for the single pill 
triple combination therapy and 8.64 QALYs, $406,405.26 for the free combination 
therapy. ICER for single pill combination therapy compared to free combination 
therapy was 33,826.46/QALY. When the relaxed adherence measurement criteria were 
applied, the total QALYs loss and cost/patient were 8.09 QALYs, $493,404.26 for 
the single pill triple combination therapy and 8.76 QALYs, $436,415.14 for the 
free combination therapy. ICER for single pill combination compared with free 
combination therapy was 84,932.26.
CONCLUSION: This study suggested that single pill triple combination therapy was 
cost-effective in comparison with free combination therapy under a willingness 
to pay threshold of 50,000 when the strict adherence measurement criteria was 
applied.

BACKGROUND: More than 50% of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer (BC) 
distant recurrences (DR) develop after the completion of 5 years of adjuvant 
endocrine therapy (ET). Its extension is beneficial on disease-free survival and 
overall survival but increases therapy-related side effects. Selecting patients 
who could benefit the most from an extended regimen has become an increasing 
need. Clinical Treatment Score at 5 Years (CTS5) is a prognostic tool using 
clinicopathologic data to estimate DR risk after 5 years of ET for ER+ BC. We 
sought to validate the prognostic value of CTS5 in a retrospective cohort of 
real-life pre- and postmenopausal patients diagnosed with ER+ BC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: CTS5 was calculated for 603 patients diagnosed with ER+ BC 
at Umberto I Hospital of Turin and DR-free after 5 years of ET. Primary endpoint 
was late DR (LDR) rate.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 8 years (range, 6-26 years). The 426 
postmenopausal women were categorized by CTS5 as follows: 152 low risk, 139 
intermediate risk, and 135 high risk. LDR rates were 3.9%, 7.2%, and 15.6%, 
respectively. CTS5 results were prognostic for LDR: patients with CTS5-high 
showed a fourfold risk of developing an LDR compared to patients with CTS5-low 
(hazard ratio, 4.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.80-11.1). The same analysis was 
conducted for the 177 premenopausal women: 88 low risk, 40 intermediate risk, 
and 49 high risk. LDR rate were 5.6%, 7.5%, and 20.4%, respectively, proving 
CTS5 to be prognostic for premenopausal patients as well (CTS5-high vs. 
CTS5-low: hazard ratio, 3.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-11.0).
CONCLUSION: CTS5 was shown to be prognostic of the risk of LDR in our population 
of real-life pre- and postmenopausal patients. Our results support its use in 
clinical practice to better tailor the prescription of extended ET.

Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal disorder, associated with moderate 
to severe intellectual disability. While life expectancy of Down syndrome 
population has greatly increased over the last decades, mortality rates are 
still high and subjects are facing prematurely a phenomenon of atypical and 
accelerated aging. The presence of an immune impairment in Down syndrome 
subjects is suggested for a long time by the existence of an increased incidence 
of infections, the incomplete efficacy of vaccinations, and a high prevalence of 
autoimmunity. Immunologic abnormalities have been described since many years in 
this population, both from a numerical and a functional points of view, and 
these abnormalities can mirror the ones observed during normal aging. In this 
review, we summarize our knowledge on immunologic disturbances commonly observed 
in subjects with Down syndrome, and in innate and adaptive immunity, as well as 
regarding chronic inflammation. We then discuss the role of accelerated aging in 
these observed abnormalities and finally review the potential age-associated 
molecular and cellular mechanisms involved.

Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) impair health and life expectancy and may 
result in an epigenetic signature that drives increased morbidity primed during 
early stages of life. This literature review focuses on the current evidence for 
epigenetic-mediated programming of brain and immune function resulting from ACE. 
To address this aim, a total of 88 articles indexed in PubMed before August 2019 
concerning ACE and epigenetics were surveyed. Current evidence partially 
supports epigenetic programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, but 
convincingly shows that ACE impairs immune function. Additionally, the needs and 
challenges that face this area are discussed in order to provide a framework 
that may help to clarify the role of epigenetics in the long-lasting effects of 
ACE.

By conventional measures, it is often remarked that Central and South America is 
one of the fastest aging geographic regions in the world. In recent years, 
however, scholars have sought to problematize the orthodox measures and concepts 
employed in the aging literature. By not taking dynamic changes in life 
expectancy into account, measures which hold chronological age constant (e.g. 
defining a boundary to old age at 60 or 65) represent a very narrow view of 
population aging. Furthermore, such constant measures may misrepresent 
differences between territories when performing a comparative analysis. 
Prospective measures based on the number of years until death present an 
alternative approach which can adapt to dynamic changes in life expectancy and 
differences over time and space. The objective of this paper, then, is to apply 
the new 'prospective' measures of aging to the territories of Central and South 
America. We calculate prospective median age; an alternative old-age threshold 
based on the age at which remaining life expectancy is 15 years, and calculate 
prospective old-age dependency ratio for 1950-2100 using estimated and projected 
life tables from the latest iteration of the UN's World Population Prospects. 
These new measures present a very different view of aging in Central and South 
America. While there are significant differences across countries, the pace and 
scale of aging are considerably slower and diminished when compared to standard, 
orthodox measures based on fixed chronological ages. Applying these new measures 
can not only serve to present a more realistic view of aging which maps onto 
demographic reality but can also serve to reconceptualize and reframe the issue 
as something which is far more manageable (e.g. through institutional reform) 
than is often perceived to be.

Premature Mortality Due to Hodgkin Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Multiple 
Myeloma, and Leukemia in Canada: A Nationwide Analysis From 1980 to 2015.

Pham TM, Shen-Tu G, Nguyen KH, Lu S, Dover DC, Duggan P, Shack L, Cheung WY.

Recently, we introduced a novel measure of "average life span shortened" (ALSS) 
to improve comparability of premature mortality over time. In this study, we 
applied this novel measure to examine trends in premature mortality caused by 
hematological cancers in Canada from 1980 to 2015. Mortality data for Hodgkin 
lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia were obtained 
from the World Health Organization mortality database. Years of life lost was 
calculated according to Canadian life tables. ALSS was defined as the ratio 
between years of life lost and expected life span. Over the study period, 
age-standardized rates of mortality decreased for all types of hematological 
cancers. Our new ALSS measure showed favorable trends in premature mortality for 
all types of hematological cancers among both sexes. For instance, men with 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma lost an average of 23.7% of their life span in 1980 versus 
16.1% in 2015, while women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma lost an average of 21.7% of 
their life span in 1980 versus 15.5% in 2015. Results from this study showed 
that patients with hematological cancers experienced prolonged survival over a 
35-year period although the magnitude of these life span gains varied by types 
of hematological cancers.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating disease of the 
cardiopulmonary system caused by the narrowing of the pulmonary arteries, 
leading to increased vascular resistance and pressure. This leads to right 
ventricle remodeling, dysfunction, and eventually, death. While conventional 
therapies have largely focused on targeting vasodilation, other pathological 
features of PAH including aberrant inflammation, mitochondrial dynamics, cell 
proliferation, and migration have not been well explored. Thus, despite some 
recent improvements in PAH treatment, the life expectancy and quality of life
