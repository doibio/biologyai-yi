Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a recessively inherited disease caused by mutations in 
the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR has a 
pivotal role in the onset of CF, and several proteins are involved in its 
homeostasis. To study CFTR interactors at protein species level, we used a 
functional proteomics approach combining 2D-DIGE, mass spectrometry and 
enrichment analysis. A human bronchial epithelial cell line with cystic fibrosis 
(CFBE41o-) and the control (16HBE14o-) were used for the comparison. 73 
differentially abundant spots were identified and some validated by 
western-blot. Enrichment analysis highlighted molecular pathways in which ezrin, 
HSP70, endoplasmin and lamin A/C, in addition to CFTR, were considered central 
hubs in CFTR homeostasis. These proteins acquire different functions through 
post-translational modifications, emphasizing the importance of studying the CF 
proteome at protein species level. Moreover, serpin H1, prelamin A/C, 
protein-SET and cystatin-B were associated to CF, demonstrating the importance 
of heat shock response, cross-talk between the cytoskeleton and signal 
transduction, chronic inflammation and alteration of CFTR gating in the 
pathophysiology of the disease. These results open new perspectives for the 
understanding of the proteostasis network, characteristic of CF pathology, and 
could provide a springboard for new therapeutic strategies.
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Homeostasis of CFTR is a dynamic process managed by 
multiple proteostatic pathways. The used gel-based proteomic approach and 
enrichment analysis pointed out protein species variations among Human Bronchial 
(16HBE14o-) and Cystic Fibrosis Bronchial Epithelial cell lines (CFBE41o-) and 
specific molecular mechanisms involved in CF. In particular, we have highlighted 
HSP70 (HSP7C), HSP90 (endoplasmin), ERM proteins (ezrin), and lamin-A/C as 
central hubs of the functional analysis. Moreover, for the first time we 
consider serpin H1, lamin A/C, protein-SET and cystatin-B important player in 
CF, affecting acute exacerbation, cytoskeleton reorganization, CFTR gating and 
chronic inflammation in CF. Due to the presence of different spots corresponding 
to the same protein, we focalize our attention on the idea that a "protein 
species discourse" is mandatory to well-define functional roles of proteins. Our 
approach has permitted to pay attention to the molecular mechanisms which 
regulate pathways directly or indirectly involved with CFTR defects: heat shock 
response, cross-talk between cytoskeleton and signal transduction, chronic 
inflammation and alteration of CFTR gating. Our data could open new perspectives 
into the understanding of CF, identifying potential targets for drug treatments 
in order to alleviate Δ508CFTR membrane instability and consequently increase 
life expectancy for CF patients.

OBJECTIVE: Responders to cardiac resynchronisation therapy whose device has a 
defibrillator component and who do not receive a therapy in the lifetime of the 
first generator have a very low incidence of appropriate therapy after box 
change. We investigated the cost implications of using a risk stratification 
tool at the time of generator change resulting in these patients being 
reimplanted with a resynchronisation pacemaker.
METHODS: A decision tree was created using previously published data which had 
demonstrated an annualised appropriate defibrillator therapy risk of 2.33%. 
Costs were calculated at National Health Service (NHS) national tariff rates 
(2016-2017). EQ-5D utility values were applied to device reimplantations, 
admissions and mortality data, which were then used to estimate quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) over 5 years.
RESULTS: At 5 years, the incremental cost of replacing a resynchronisation 
defibrillator device with a second resynchronisation defibrillator versus 
resynchronisation pacemaker was £5045 per patient. Incremental QALY gained was 
0.0165 (defibrillator vs pacemaker), resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £305 712 per QALYs gained. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis resulted in an ICER of £313 612 (defibrillator vs 
pacemaker). For reimplantation of all patients with a defibrillator rather than 
a pacemaker to yield an ICER of less than £30 000 per QALY gained (current NHS 
cut-off for approval of treatment), the annual arrhythmic event rate would need 
to be 9.3%. The budget impact of selective replacement was a saving of £2 133 
985 per year.
CONCLUSIONS: Implanting low-risk patients with a resynchronisation defibrillator 
with the same device at the time of generator change is not cost-effective by 
current NHS criteria. Further research is required to understand the impact of 
these findings on individual patients at the time of generator change.

INTRODUCTION: US tobacco control policies to reduce cigarette use have been 
effective, but their impact has been relatively slow. This study considers a 
strategy of switching cigarette smokers to e-cigarette use ('vaping') in the USA 
to accelerate tobacco control progress.
METHODS: A Status Quo Scenario, developed to project smoking rates and health 
outcomes in the absence of vaping, is compared with Substitution models, whereby 
cigarette use is largely replaced by vaping over a 10-year period. We test an 
Optimistic and a Pessimistic Scenario, differing in terms of the relative harms 
of e-cigarettes compared with cigarettes and the impact on overall initiation, 
cessation and switching. Projected mortality outcomes by age and sex under the 
Status Quo and E-Cigarette Substitution Scenarios are compared from 2016 to 2100 
to determine public health impacts.
FINDINGS: Compared with the Status Quo, replacement of cigarette by e-cigarette 
use over a 10-year period yields 6.6 million fewer premature deaths with 
86.7 million fewer life years lost in the Optimistic Scenario. Under the 
Pessimistic Scenario, 1.6 million premature deaths are averted with 20.8 million 
fewer life years lost. The largest gains are among younger cohorts, with a 0.5 
gain in average life expectancy projected for the age 15 years cohort in 2016.
CONCLUSIONS: The tobacco control community has been divided regarding the role 
of e-cigarettes in tobacco control. Our projections show that a strategy of 
replacing cigarette smoking with vaping would yield substantial life year gains, 
even under pessimistic assumptions regarding cessation, initiation and relative 
harm.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a clonal disorder of mature B cells. Most 
patients are characterised by an indolent disease course and an anergic 
phenotype of their leukaemia cells, which refers to a state of unresponsiveness 
to B cell receptor stimulation. Up to 10% of CLL patients transform from an 
indolent subtype to an aggressive form of B cell lymphoma over time (Richter´s 
syndrome) and show a significantly worse treatment outcome. Here we show that B 
cell-specific ablation of Nfat2 leads to the loss of the anergic phenotype 
culminating in a significantly compromised life expectancy and transformation to 
aggressive disease. We further define a gene expression signature of anergic CLL 
cells consisting of several NFAT2-dependent genes including Cbl-b, Grail, Egr2 
and Lck. In summary, this study identifies NFAT2 as a crucial regulator of the 
anergic phenotype in CLL.NFAT2 is a transcription factor that has been linked 
with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), but its functions in CLL manifestation 
are still unclear. Here the authors show, by analysing mouse CLL models and 
characterising biopsies from CLL patients, that NFAT2 is an important regulator 
for the anergic phenotype of CLL.

In amniote embryos, skeletal muscles in the trunk are derived from epithelial 
dermomyotomes, the ventral margin of which extends ventrally to form body wall 
muscles. At limb levels, ventral dermomyotomes also generate limb-muscle 
precursors, an Lbx1-positive cell population that originates from the 
dermomyotome and migrates distally into the limb bud. In elasmobranchs, however, 
muscles in the paired fins were believed to be formed by direct somitic 
extension, a developmental pattern used by the amniote body wall muscles. Here 
we re-examined the development of pectoral fin muscles in catsharks, 
Scyliorhinus, and found that chondrichthyan fin muscles are indeed formed from 
Lbx-positive muscle precursors. Furthermore, these precursors originate from the 
ventral edge of the dermomyotome, the rest of which extends towards the ventral 
midline to form body wall muscles. Therefore, the Lbx1-positive, 
de-epithelialized appendicular muscle precursors appear to have been established 
in the body plan before the divergence of Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviewed very recent papers (2016) discussing or 
bringing clinical evidences of the possible common pathways leading to diabetic 
foot syndrome (DFS) and increased mortality rates.
RECENT FINDINGS: Diabetic patients with diabetic foot syndrome have a mortality 
rate greater than twofold when compared with non-ulcerated diabetics. In 
addition, the 5-year mortality rate following amputation is estimated at 39-68%, 
a life expectancy comparable to aggressive types of cancer or advanced 
congestive heart failure. The majority of patients with diabetic foot ulcer also 
present insulin resistance, central obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension that 
characterize the metabolic syndrome that, in turn, is associated with an 
elevated risk of major cardiovascular events. Sensory neuropathy is the primary 
cause of more the 60% of diabetic foot ulcer. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is 
a microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and in type 2 diabetes, not 
only hyperglycemia but also other metabolic alterations and persistent 
inflammatory status due to adiposity play a major role in axon injury. Elevated 
triglycerides have been showed to be an independent risk factor for lower 
extremity amputation in diabetic patients. Also, toxic adiposity, oxidative 
stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of the polyol pathway, 
accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and elevation of 
inflammatory markers are also implicated in diabetic vascular disease and 
neuropathy. The hypotheses that the association between DFS and increased rates 
of mortality reflects the progression of micro- and macrovascular complications 
are reinforced by the additional association of DFU to renal failure and 
retinopathy.

INTRODUCTION: As life expectancy increases, it is expected that 60% of all cases 
of cancer will be detected in elderly patients in the next two decades. Cancer 
treatment for older persons is complicated by a number of factors, thus 
negatively affecting patients' quality of life.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate quality of life in elderly 
cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: This study was descriptive and non-experimental. It was 
conducted in one large hospital in a major city of Northern Greece. The sample 
was convenience comprising 53 elderly cancer patients undergoing cycle 3 
chemotherapy. The data was collected using the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy scale and included questions related to demographic and clinical 
characteristics.
RESULTS: The majority of participants were men (n = 27, 50.9%) who were married 
(n = 32, 79.5%). Their mean age was 70.07 ± 3.60. Almost half of the sample 
(n = 30, 56.6%) had colon cancer. There was a statistical significant difference 
between men and women pertaining to physical wellbeing (p = 0.004) and overall 
quality of life (p < 0.001). When comparing each subscale with the patients' 
marital status it was found that there was a statistical difference with respect 
to social/family wellbeing (p = 0.029), functional wellbeing (p = 0.09) and 
overall quality of life (p < 0.001). Moreover, the type of cancer affected 
overall quality of life (p < 0.001) and social/family wellbeing (p = 0.029).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings call attention to quality of life and its related 
factors in elderly cancer patients. It is highly recommended to envisage 
measures for improving quality of life in this group of cancer patients.

AIMS: To provide population-based data on the maximum tolerable rate of 
progression to avoid visual impairment (maxTRoP_VI) and blindness (maxTRoP_BL) 
from open-angle glaucoma (OAG).
METHODS: Participants with OAG in the Thessaloniki Eye Study (cross-sectional, 
population-based study in a European population) were included in the analysis. 
Visual impairment was defined as mean deviation (MD) equal to or worse than 
-12dB and blindness as MD equal to or worse than -24dB. Additional thresholds 
for visual impairment were tested. For each participant maxTRoP_VI was defined 
as the rate of progression which would not lead to visual impairment during 
expected lifetime. MaxTRoP_BL was defined accordingly. Both parameters were 
calculated for each OAG subject using age, sex, MD and life expectancy data. The 
eye with the better MD per subject was included in the analysis.
RESULTS: Among 135 subjects with OAG, 123 had reliable visual fields and were 
included in the analysis. The mean age was 73±6 years and the median MD was 
-3.65±5.28dB. Among those, 69.1% would have a maxTRoP_VI slower than -1dB/year 
and 18.7% would have a maxTRoP_VI between -1 and -2dB/year. Also, 72.4% would 
have a maxTRoP_BL slower than -2dB/year. For all tested thresholds for visual 
impairment, approximately 86% of the OAG study participants would not be able to 
tolerate a rate of progression equal to or faster than -2dB/year.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with glaucoma in our study would have a 
maximum tolerable rate of progression slower than -1dB/year in their better eye. 
Patient-tailored strategies to monitor the visual field are important, but raise 
the issue of feasibility with regard to the number of visual field tests needed.

Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2017 Oct 3;167(7):

BACKGROUND: Two small trials suggest that low-dose intravenous immunoglobulin 
(IVIg) may improve the symptoms of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a rare 
posttraumatic pain condition.
OBJECTIVE: To confirm the efficacy of low-dose IVIg compared with placebo in 
reducing pain during a 6-week period in adult patients who had CRPS from 1 to 5 
years.
DESIGN: 1:1 parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial for 6 
weeks, with an optional 6-week open extension. Patients were randomly assigned 
to 1 of 2 study groups between 27 August 2013 and 28 October 2015; the last 
patient completed follow-up on 21 March 2016. Patients, providers, researchers, 
and outcome assessors were blinded to treatment assignment. (ISRCTN42179756).
SETTING: 7 secondary and tertiary care pain management centers in the United 
Kingdom.
PARTICIPANTS: 111 patients with moderate or severe CRPS of 1 to 5 years' 
duration.
INTERVENTION: IVIg, 0.5 g/kg of body weight, or visually indistinguishable 
placebo of 0.1% albumin in saline on days 1 and 22 after randomization.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was 24-hour average pain intensity, measured 
daily between days 6 and 42, on an 11-point (0- to 10-point) rating scale. 
Secondary outcomes were pain interference and quality of life.
RESULTS: The primary analysis sample consisted of 108 eligible patients, 103 of 
whom had outcome data. Mean (average) pain scores were 6.9 points (SD, 1.5) for 
placebo and 7.2 points (SD, 1.3) for IVIg. The adjusted difference in means was 
0.27 (95% CI, -0.25 to 0.80; P = 0.30), which excluded the prespecified, 
clinically important difference of -1.2. No statistically significant 
differences in secondary outcomes were found between the groups. In the open 
extension, 12 of the 67 patients (18%) who received 2 IVIg infusions had pain 
reduction of at least 2 points compared with their baseline score. Two patients 
in the blinded phase (1 in the placebo and 1 in the IVIg group) and 4 in the 
open IVIg phase had serious events.
LIMITATIONS: Results do not apply to patients who have had CRPS for less than 1 
year or more than 5 years and do not extend to full-dose treatment (for example, 
2 g/kg). The study was inadequately powered to detect subgroup effects.
CONCLUSION: Low-dose immunoglobulin treatment for 6 weeks was not effective in 
relieving pain in patients with moderate to severe CRPS of 1 to 5 years' 
duration.

BACKGROUND: More and more elderly problems come to our life and the elderly 
health care become more important. Elderly people with lower extremities 
weakness usually use walkers to assist in walking. Although the commercial 
standard walkers (N-type) can improve elderly people's walking ability, users 
sometimes take risk of falling when using the standard walkers to perform 
sit-to-stand (STS). The purpose of this study is to design an additional armrest 
which can be attached to a standard walker for users performing STS more easily 
and evaluate it with clinical assessments and a body worn sensor.
METHODS: The combination of the walker and the new armrest design are referred 
to as a better type (B-type). Clinical assessments and a motion analysis were 
performed on 34 elderly people (age, 83 ± 6 y/o) with a Five Times Sit-to-Stand 
Test (FTSST), a satisfaction survey and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) 
attached to the trunk to measure the acceleration data when using B-type and 
N-type during STS.
RESULTS: The FTSST result shows that the B-type can reduce about 5 s spending 
time of elderly people during STS and 63.7% of subjects were more satisfied on 
the B-type than the N-type. According to the IMU, the result reveals that the 
B-type can provide subjects higher peak-peak anterio-posterior acceleration, 
peak flexion acceleration and peak extension acceleration during STS.
CONCLUSION: There is a better assistance during STS when using our new armrests 
design combined with the commercial product which could provide larger 
acceleration to perform sit-to-stand.

The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of lactoperoxidase system-whey 
protein coating and modified atmosphere packaging (60% CO2, 30% N2, 10% O2) 
combination (LPOS + WPS + MAP) on the microbiological, chemical and sensory 
specifications of Pike-Perch (Sander Lucioperca, Linnaeus 1758) fillets. The 
highest bacterial count was observed in the fish fillets packaged with whey 
protein coating solutions (WPS) in compare with the other groups. Combination of 
WPS + LPOS and MAP packaging could significantly inhibit bacterial growth. Total 
volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), as a quality index of flesh, had strong 
correlation (r = 0.98-0.99) with microbial load, so that the highest and the 
lowest TVB-N values were observed in WPS and WPS + LPOS + MAP batches, 
respectively. Assessments of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances index 
showed that incorporation of LPOS with WPS or MAP did not have remarkable effect 
on lipid oxidation, but combined effect of MAP and WPS + LPOS on reducing fat 
oxidation was significant. The pH values in WPS + LPOS, WPS + MAP and 
WPS + LPOS + MAP were significantly lower than WPS. Sensory evaluations 
indicated that LPOS + WPS + MAP kept Pike-Perch fillets at high sensory 
acceptability for at least 16 days in refrigerated temperature. In conclusion, 
combination of MAP and WPS + LPOS showed synergistic effects on shelf-life 
extension of Pike-Perch fillets under refrigerated storage.

IMPORTANCE: Variations in thyroid function within reference ranges are 
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. 
However, the impact of thyroid function on life expectancy (LE) and the number 
of years lived with and without CVD remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of thyroid function with total LE and 
LE with and without CVD among euthyroid individuals.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Rotterdam Study, a population-based, 
prospective cohort study. We included participants without known thyroid disease 
and with thyrotropin and free thyroxine (FT4) levels within the reference 
ranges.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Multistate life tables were used to calculate total 
LE and LE with and without CVD among thyrotropin and FT4 tertiles. Life 
expectancy estimates in men and women aged 50 years and older were obtained 
using prevalence, incidence rates, and hazard ratios for 3 transitions (healthy 
to CVD, healthy to death, and CVD to death), adjusting for sociodemographic and 
cardiovascular risk factors.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 7785 participants was 64.7 (9.8) years, and 
52.5% were women. Over a median follow-up of 8.1 (interquartile range, 2.7-9.9) 
years, we observed 789 incident CVD events and 1357 deaths. Compared with those 
in the lowest tertile, men and women in the highest thyrotropin tertile lived 
2.0 (95% CI, 1.0 to 2.8) and 1.4 (95% CI, 0.2 to 2.4) years longer, 
respectively, of which, 1.5 (95% CI, 0.2 to 2.6) and 0.9 (95% CI, -0.2 to 2.0) 
years longer without CVD. Compared with those in the lowest tertile, the 
difference in life expectancy for men and women in the highest FT4 tertile was 
-3.2 (95% CI, -5.0 to -1.4) and -3.5 (95% CI, -5.6 to -1.5) years, respectively, 
of which, -3.1 (95% CI, -4.9 to -1.4) and -2.5 (95% CI, -4.4 to -0.7) years 
without CVD.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: At the age of 50 years, participants with low-normal 
thyroid function live up to 3.5 years longer overall and up to 3.1 years longer 
without CVD than participants with high-normal thyroid function. These findings 
provide supporting evidence for a reevaluation of the current reference ranges 
of thyroid function and can help inform preventive and clinical care.

PURPOSE: To model the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) outcomes, 
cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of certolizumab pegol (CZP) (with and 
without a hypothetical risk-sharing scheme at treatment initiation for 
biologic-naïve patients) versus the current mix of reimbursed biologics for 
treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Finland.
METHODS: A probabilistic model with 12-week cycles and a societal approach was 
developed for the years 2015-2019, accounting for differences in ACR responses 
(meta-analysis), mortality, and persistence. The risk-sharing scheme included a 
treatment switch and refund of the costs associated with CZP acquisition if 
patients failed to achieve ACR20 response at week 12. For the current treatment 
mix, ACR20 at week 24 determined treatment continuation. Quality-adjusted life 
years were derived on the basis of the Health Utilities Index.
RESULTS: In the Finnish target population, CZP treatment with a risk-sharing 
scheme led to a estimated annual net expenditure decrease ranging from 1.7% in 
2015 to 5.6% in 2019 compared with the current treatment mix. Per patient over 
the 5 years, CZP risk sharing was estimated to decrease the time without ACR 
response by 5%-units, decrease work absenteeism by 24 days, and increase the 
time with ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses by 5%-, 6%-, and 1%-units, 
respectively, with a gain of 0.03 quality-adjusted life years. The modeled 
risk-sharing scheme showed reduced costs of €7866 per patient, with a more than 
95% probability of cost-effectiveness when compared with the current treatment 
mix.
CONCLUSION: The present analysis estimated that CZP, with or without the 
risk-sharing scheme, is a cost-effective alternative treatment for RA patients 
in Finland. The surplus provided by the CZP risk-sharing scheme could fund 
treatment for 6% more Finnish RA patients.

The fast population ageing and the delay in the age of presentation of acute 
coronary syndrome (ACS) is leading to a rapid increase in the proportion of old 
patients with ACS. Although elderly patients with ACS deserves a specific 
clinical approach due to aging physiology, increased incidence of comorbidities 
and different patient expectations, paradoxically this patient population is 
usually underrepresented in clinical studies. The up-to-date European Society of 
Cardiology Guidelines on NSTEACS recommends an invasive strategy after taking 
the consideration of estimated life expectancy, comorbidities, quality of life 
and patients preferences. A comprehensive follow-up strategy involving cardiac 
rehabilitation and medical management should be implemented.

The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease, which usually develops on the 
basis of atherosclerosis and develops as a result of chronic arterial occlusive 
pathology, increases with age. Peripheral artery disease in the elderly patient 
population may be asymptomatic due to restrictive conditions associated with 
immobilization. Concurrent cerebrovascular disease and coronary artery disease 
risk and mortality rates are higher in elderly patients with peripheral artery 
disease. The life expectancy in patients with peripheral arterial disease is 
worse than in prostate cancer patients. Leading risk factors include advanced 
age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
hyperhomocysteinemia and hypothyroidism. The most important physical examination 
component is the palpation of the entire peripheral pulses. The cases in which 
the ankle-brachial systolic pressure index measurement for clinical diagnosis is 
below 0.9 are defined as peripheral arterial disease. It is aimed to completely 
correct or improve the existing clinical symptoms and to increase the survival 
rates of the patients. The existing risk factors are modified as the first step 
of the treatment. Smoking cessation, treatment of hypertension primarily with 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, lowering of hemoglobin A1c levels 
below 7%, anti-hyperlipidemic treatment primarily with statin, antiaggregant 
therapy primarily with clopidogrel, cilostazol therapy, good foot care, 
controlled exercise program, if necessary, interventional or operational 
revascularization, amputation in the presence of irreversible effects are the 
main treatment components. Indications for major revascularization include the 
presence of resting pain in the limb and / or open and long-lasting unhealed 
wound in the extremity and / or severe complaints of intermittant claudication 
that will result in limitation in daily activities. It should not be forgotten 
that, all the clinical decisions to be taken in the treatment of elderly 
patients with peripheral arterial disease are determined by the patient's 
physical condition, current clinical condition and the expectation level of the 
patient.

Along with the medical technology that has developed in recent years, the 
elderly population has started to increase all over the world due to the 
extension of human life. Chronic diseases have been commonly diagnosed with the 
increasing population of elderly people. Cardiovascular diseases are the most 
common cause of death in men and women over 65 years of age. High morbidity and 
mortality due to cardiovascular disease in elderly patients requires effective 
prevention and treatment in patients. The incidence of cardiovascular diseases 
is in direct proportion to age; therefore, hypertension, coronary artery 
disease, carotid artery disease, stroke, heart failure, arrhythmia and valvular 
diseases can be identified as common cardiovascular diseases in the elderly 
population.

Quality of Life of Patients with Spinal Metastasis from Cancer of Unknown 
Primary Origin: A Longitudinal Study of Surgical Management Combined with 
Postoperative Radiation Therapy.

J.X.), Pathology (H.Y.), and Human Resources (J.F.), Changzheng Hospital, Second 
Military Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: Patients with spinal metastasis from cancer of unknown primary 
origin have limited life expectancy and poor quality of life. Surgery and 
radiation therapy remain the main treatment options, but, to our knowledge, 
there are limited data concerning quality-of-life improvement after surgery and 
radiation therapy and even fewer data on whether surgical intervention would 
affect quality of life.
METHODS: Patients were enrolled between January 2009 and January 2014 at the 
Changzheng Hospital, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. The quality of life 
of 2 patient groups (one group that underwent surgery followed by postoperative 
radiation therapy and one group that underwent radiation therapy only) was 
assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) 
questionnaire during a 6-month period. A subgroup analysis of quality of life 
was performed to compare different surgical strategies in the surgical group.
RESULTS: A total of 287 patients, including 191 patients in the group that 
underwent surgery and 96 patients in the group that underwent radiation therapy 
only, were enrolled in the prospective study; 177 patients completed all 5 
checkpoints and 110 patients had died by the final checkpoint. The surgery group 
had significantly higher adjusted quality-of-life scores than the radiation 
therapy group in each domain of the FACT-G questionnaire (all p < 0.05). 
Subgroup analysis showed that adjusted functional and physical well-being scores 
were higher in the circumferential surgical decompression group.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery followed by postoperative radiation therapy improved and 
maintained quality of life in patients with spinal metastasis from cancer of 
unknown primary origin in the 6-month assessment. In terms of surgical 
strategies, circumferential decompression seems better than laminectomy alone in 
quality-of-life improvement.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to estimate the lifetime health and 
economic effects of different strategies of caring for diabetic foot in the 
Chinese setting.
METHODS: A mathematical model was developed to simulate the onset and 
progression of diabetic foot disease in patients with type 2 diabetes managed 
with optimal care and usual care. Clinical and utility data were obtained from 
the published literature. Direct medical costs and resource utilization in the 
Chinese healthcare setting were considered. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken 
to test the effects of a range of variables and assumptions on the results. 
Heath benefits and costs were the outcome measures assessed.
RESULTS: Compared with usual care, optimal care was a cost-saving option that 
exhibited lower costs with improved health benefits, including greater 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and reduced incidence of foot complications. 
The lifetime saving costs per additional QALY gained by optimal care were 
US$2015. The model outcome was most sensitive to the risk ratio of foot ulcers 
and amputation for optimal care over usual care.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementing guideline-based optimal care for diabetic foot is 
likely to be cost-effective in a health resource-limited setting.
