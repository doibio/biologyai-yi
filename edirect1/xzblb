BACKGROUND: Survivors of ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at 
high risk for other vascular events. We evaluated the impact of 2 types of case 
management (hard touch with pharmacist or soft touch with nurse) added to usual 
care on global vascular risk.
METHODS: This is a prespecified secondary analysis of a 6-month trial conducted 
in outpatients with recent stroke/TIA who received usual care and were 
randomized to additional monthly visits with either nurse case managers (who 
counseled patients, monitored risk factors, and communicated results to primary 
care physicians) or pharmacist case managers (who were also able to 
independently prescribe according to treatment algorithms). The Framingham Risk 
Score [FRS]) and the Cardiovascular Disease Life Expectancy Model (CDLEM) were 
used to estimate 10-year risk of any vascular event at baseline, 6 months (trial 
conclusion), and 12 months (6 months after last trial visit).
RESULTS: Mean age of the 275 evaluable patients was 67.6 years. Both study arms 
were well balanced at baseline and exhibited reductions in absolute global 
vascular risk estimates at 6 months: median 4.8% (Interquartile range (IQR) 
0.3%-11.3%) for the pharmacist arm versus 5.1% (IQR 1.9%-12.5%) for the nurse 
arm on the FRS (P = .44 between arms) and median 10.0% (0.1%-31.6%) versus 12.5% 
(2.1%-30.5%) on the CDLEM (P = .37). These reductions persisted at 12 months: 
median 6.4% (1.2%-11.6%) versus 5.5% (2.0%-12.0%) for the FRS (P = .83) and 
median 8.4% (0.1%-28.3%) versus 13.1% (1.6%-31.6%) on the CDLEM (P = .20).
CONCLUSIONS: Case management by nonphysician providers is associated with 
improved global vascular risk in patients with recent stroke/TIA. Reductions 
achieved during the active phase of the trial persisted after trial conclusion.

Latin America continues to segregate different social groups into separate 
health-system segments, including two separate public sector blocks: a well 
resourced social security for salaried workers and their families and a Ministry 
of Health serving poor and vulnerable people with low standards of quality and 
needing a frequently impoverishing payment at point of service. This segregation 
shows Latin America's longstanding economic and social inequality, cemented by 
an economic framework that predicted that economic growth would lead to rapid 
formalisation of the economy. Today, the institutional setup that organises the 
social segregation in health care is perceived, despite improved life expectancy 
and other advances, as a barrier to fulfilling the right to health, embodied in 
the legislation of many Latin American countries. This Series paper outlines 
four phases in the history of Latin American countries that explain the roots of 
segmentation in health care and describe three paths taken by countries seeking 
to overcome it: unification of the funds used to finance both social security 
and Ministry of Health services (one public payer); free choice of provider or 
insurer; and expansion of services to poor people and the non-salaried 
population by making explicit the health-care benefits to which all citizens are 
entitled.

Starting in the late 1980s, many Latin American countries began social sector 
reforms to alleviate poverty, reduce socioeconomic inequalities, improve health 
outcomes, and provide financial risk protection. In particular, starting in the 
1990s, reforms aimed at strengthening health systems to reduce inequalities in 
health access and outcomes focused on expansion of universal health coverage, 
especially for poor citizens. In Latin America, health-system reforms have 
produced a distinct approach to universal health coverage, underpinned by the 
principles of equity, solidarity, and collective action to overcome social 
inequalities. In most of the countries studied, government financing enabled the 
introduction of supply-side interventions to expand insurance coverage for 
uninsured citizens--with defined and enlarged benefits packages--and to scale up 
delivery of health services. Countries such as Brazil and Cuba introduced 
tax-financed universal health systems. These changes were combined with 
demand-side interventions aimed at alleviating poverty (targeting many social 
determinants of health) and improving access of the most disadvantaged 
populations. Hence, the distinguishing features of health-system strengthening 
for universal health coverage and lessons from the Latin American experience are 
relevant for countries advancing universal health coverage.

As the Epidemiological Transition progresses worldwide, chronic diseases account 
for the majority of deaths in developed countries and a rising proportion in 
developing countries indicating a new global pattern of mortality and health 
challenges into the future. Attainment of formal education is widely reported to 
have a negative gradient with risk factors and onset of chronic disease, yet 
there has not been a formal assessment of this research. A random-effects 
meta-analysis finds that across 414 published effects more education 
significantly reduces the likelihood of chronic disease, except for neoplastic 
diseases with substantial genetic causes. Some studies, however, report null 
effects and other research on infectious disease report positive education 
gradients. Instead of assuming these contradictory results are spurious, it is 
suggested that they are part of a predictable systemic interaction between 
multiple mediating effects of education and the Epidemiological Transition stage 
of the population; and thus represent one case of the Population Education 
Transition Curve modeling changes in the association between education and 
health as dependent on population context.

The development and application of essential standards for cardiovascular care 
for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people creates a strategic platform on 
which to systematically close the gap in the health outcomes and life expectancy 
between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous people in 
Australia. We outline six developmental stages that can be used to enhance the 
effective translation of evidence into practice that reduces life expectancy 
differentials. Focussing efforts where the biggest gain can be made; considering 
how to make a policy-relevant difference with an emphasis on translation into 
policy and practice; establishing a foundation for action by engaging with 
stakeholders throughout the process; developing a framework to guide action; 
drafting policy-relevant and framework-appropriate essential service standards; 
and defining standards that help policy decision makers achieve current priority 
policy targets.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) constitute the largest cause of death for 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and remain the primary contributor 
to life expectancy differentials between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
and non-Indigenous Australians. As such, CVD remains the most critical target 
for reducing the life expectancy gap. The Essential Service Standards for 
Equitable National Cardiovascular Care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
people (ESSENCE) outline elements of care that are necessary to reduce disparity 
in access and outcomes for five critical cardiovascular conditions. The ESSENCE 
approach builds a foundation on which the gap in life expectancy between 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous Australians can be 
reduced. The standards purposefully focus on the prevention and management of 
CVD extending across the continuum of risk and disease. Each of the agreed 
essential service standards are presented alongside the most critical targets 
for policy development and health system reform aimed at mitigating population 
disparity in CVD and related conditions.

National health care expenditures constitute a continuously expanding component 
of the US economy. Health care resources are distributed unequally among the 
population, and geriatric patients are disproportionately represented. 
Characterizing this group of individuals that accounts for the largest 
percentage of US health spending may facilitate the introduction of targeted 
interventions in key high-impact areas. Changing demographics, an increasing 
incidence of chronic disease and progressive disability, rapid technological 
advances, and systemic market failures in the health care sector combine to 
drive cost. A multidisciplinary approach will become increasingly necessary to 
balance the delicate relationship between our constrained supply and increasing 
demand.

Trauma is an increasingly common problem in geriatric patients; fractures are 
frequent among the elderly. Life expectancy continues to rise. Advances in 
medical care allow people to live longer and better lives. Medications, surgical 
advances (treatment for coronary artery disease, coronary bypass grafting), and 
joint replacement surgery can be safely performed in elderly patients. Thus, 
geriatric patients are no longer confined to a life of inactivity. They are out 
of their homes and interacting in the community, exercising and leading active 
lives. Thus, they are more likely to become injured and present to trauma 
centers for care.

Affliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, People's Republic of China.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to establish the most cost-effective 
strategy for using integrated 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET and computed tomography 
(CT) for mediastinal lymph node staging (N-staging) of preoperative 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four N-staging decision models for operative NSCLC, model 
A (CT only), model B (PET/CT for negative CT), model C (CT and PET/CT for all), 
and model D (PET/CT only), were constructed according to the Chinese edition of 
NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer and 
China NSCLC N-staging practices. Data including the parameters for decision 
models, life expectancy, and expenditures were retrieved from the literature, 
from websites of PET Reservation Centers, and on consultation with experts. On 
the basis of model A, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for 
the other three models. Robustness of the result was evaluated by univariate 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Life expectancy (years) was 2.60 for model A, 2.57 for model B, 2.67 
for model C, and 2.66 for model D. The probabilities for improper therapy due to 
wrong staging were 36.78, 13.00, 8.91, and 12.95%, respectively. Surgical 
mortality rates were 1.87, 1.01, 1.13, and 1.24%, respectively. Model C, for 
which the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (37 960 CNY/year) was lower than 
that of model D (65 175 CNY/year) and 2012 GDP per capita in China (38 459 CNY), 
was cost-effective and optimal, and this result was robust.
CONCLUSION: Model C was the most cost-effective strategy for NSCLC N-staging in 
the China mainland. Introduction of model C into Chinese N-staging protocols for 
NSCLC would be helpful for treatment selection, for reducing surgical mortality 
rates, and for extending life expectancy.

Global climate and land use changes could strongly affect soil erosion and the 
capability of soils to sustain agriculture and in turn impact regional or global 
food security. The objective of our study was to develop a method to assess soil 
sustainability to erosion under changes in land use and climate. The method was 
applied in a typical mixed Mediterranean landscape in a wine-growing watershed 
(75 km(2)) within the Languedoc region (La Peyne, France) for two periods: a 
first period with the current climate and land use and a second period with the 
climate and land use scenarios at the end of the twenty-first century. The 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1B future rainfall scenarios from the 
Météo France General circulation model was coupled with four contrasting land 
use change scenarios that were designed using a spatially-explicit land use 
change model. Mean annual erosion rate was estimated with an expert-based soil 
erosion model. Soil life expectancy was assessed using soil depth. Soil erosion 
rate and soil life expectancy were combined into a sustainability index. The 
median simulated soil erosion rate for the current period was 3.5 t/ha/year and 
the soil life expectancy was 273 years, showing a low sustainability of soils. 
For the future period with the same land use distribution, the median simulated 
soil erosion rate was 4.2 t/ha/year and the soil life expectancy was 249 years. 
The results show that soil erosion rate and soil life expectancy are more 
sensitive to changes in land use than to changes in precipitation. Among the 
scenarios tested, institution of a mandatory grass cover in vineyards seems to 
be an efficient means of significantly improving soil sustainability, both in 
terms of decreased soil erosion rates and increased soil life expectancies.

INTRODUCTION: The Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare hereditary, 
autosomal-dominant disorder. It is characterized by a gastrointestinal polyposis 
and mucocutaneous melanic spots. It has also been reported as a precondition for 
malignancies with a life-time-hazard for cancer up to 93%, caused by a germline 
mutation in the STK11 gene.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 21-year-old man presented with nausea and abdominal 
pain. He had a known history of PJS since the age of 13 when he was treated for 
intussusception due to a hamartomatous polyp. Preoperative diagnostics revealed 
a second intussusception and an extensive intestinal polyposis. Intraoperative 
findings confirmed the suspected diagnoses and desvagination was performed. 
Nearly 50 polyps were removed from the small intestinum over several 
longitudinal sections. As the appendix appeared thickened an appendectomy was 
performed simultaneously. Histology showed hamartomatous polyps and the 
incidental finding of a pT1 carcinoid of the appendix. The patient recovered 
well and needed no further treatment for his carcinoid tumor.
DISCUSSION: The mechanism of carcinogenesis in PJS still remains debatable, 
although the genetic disorder underlying the syndrome is known. A predisposition 
for carcinoid tumors also stays questionable. To our knowledge there is no 
description of an association between carcinoid tumors of the appendix and PJS 
to date.
CONCLUSION: Life-expectancy in patients with PJS is reduced. Causes are the 
development of malignancies and complications from the polyps such as 
intussusception. Since there is no treatment possible main focus must be aimed 
at early recognition of malignancies and the prevention of complications.

The question is not whether exercise is or isn't one of the very best strategies 
for improving quality of life, cardiovascular (CV) health and longevity-it is. 
And there is no debate as to whether or not strenuous high-intensity endurance 
training produces an amazingly efficient, compliant, and powerful pump-it does. 
The essence of the controversy centers on what exactly is the ideal pattern of 
long-term physical activity (PA) for conferring robust and enduring CV health, 
while also optimizing life expectancy. With that goal in mind, this review will 
focus on the question: "Is more always better when it comes to exercise?" And if 
a dose-response curve exists for the therapeutic effects of PA, where is the 
upper threshold at which point further training begins to detract from the 
health and longevity benefits noted with moderate exercise? The emerging picture 
from the cumulative data on this hotly debated topic is that moderate exercise 
appears to be the sweet spot for bestowing lasting CV health and longevity. 
However, the specific definition of moderate in this context is not clear yet.

AIM: Abacavir (ABC) is one of the more affordable antiretroviral drugs used for 
controlling HIV. Although with similar efficacy to current first-line drugs, its 
limited usage in Singapore can be attributed to its possible side effect of 
adverse hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). HLA-B*5701 genotyping is a clinically 
relevant procedure for avoiding abacavir-induced HSRs. As patients who do not 
carry the risk allele are unlikely to develop HSRs, a simple rule can be 
developed to allow abacavir prescription for patients who are B*5701 negative. 
Here, we carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis of HLA-B*5701 genotyping before 
abacavir prescription in the context of the Singapore healthcare system, which 
caters predominantly to Han Chinese, Southeast-asian Malays, and South-asian 
Indians. In addition, we aim to identify the most cost-effective treatment 
regimen for HIV patients.
METHODS: A decision tree model was developed in TreeAge. The model considers 
medical treatment and genotyping costs, genotyping test characteristics, the 
prevalence of the risk allele, reduction in the quality of life, and increased 
expenditure due to side effects and other factors, evaluating independently over 
early-stage and late-stage HIV patients segmented by drug contraindications.
RESULTS: The study indicates that genotyping is not cost-effective for any 
ethnicity irrespective of the disease stage, except for Indian patients with 
early-stage HIV who are contraindicated to tenofovir.
CONCLUSION: Abacavir (as first-line) without genotyping is the cheapest and most 
cost-effective treatment for all ethnicities except for early-stage Indian HIV 
patients contraindicated to tenofovir. The HLA-B*5701 frequency, the mortality 
rate from abacavir-induced HSRs, and genotyping costs are among the major 
factors influencing the cost-effectiveness.

A source of debate in the field of health care priority setting is whether 
health gains should be weighted differently for different groups of patients. 
The debate has recently focused on the relative value of life extensions for 
patients with short life expectancy. However, few studies have examined 
empirically whether society is prepared to fund life-extending end-of-life 
treatments that would not meet the reimbursement criteria used for other 
treatments. A web-based discrete choice experiment was conducted in 2012 using a 
sample of 3969 members of the general public in England and Wales. The study 
design was informed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's 
supplementary policy for the appraisal of life-extending end-of-life treatments. 
The choice tasks involved asking respondents which of two hypothetical patients 
they would prefer to treat, assuming that the health service has enough funds to 
treat only one of them. Conditional logit regressions were used for modelling. 
Choices about which patient to treat were influenced more by the sizes of 
treatment gains than by patients' life expectancy without treatment. Some 
respondents appear to support a health-maximisation type objective throughout, 
whilst a small minority always seek to treat those who are worse off without 
treatment. The majority of respondents, however, seem to advocate a mixture of 
the two approaches. Overall, we find little evidence that members of the general 
public prefer to give higher priority to life-extending end-of-life treatments 
than to other types of treatment. When asked to make decisions about the 
treatment of hypothetical patients with relatively short life expectancies, most 
people's choices are driven by the size of the health gains offered by 
treatment.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Reimbursements for interbody fusions have declined recently 
because of their questionable cost-effectiveness.
PURPOSE: A Markov model was adopted to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) or transforaminal lumbar interbody 
fusion (/TLIF) versus noninterbody fusion and posterolateral fusion (PLF) in 
patients with lumbar spondylolisthesis.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Decision model analysis based on retrospective data from a 
single institutional series.
PATIENT SAMPLE: One hundred thirty-seven patients underwent first-time 
instrumented lumbar fusions for degenerative or isthmic spondylolisthesis.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality of life adjustments and expenditures were assigned to 
each short-term complication (durotomy, surgical site infection, and medical 
complication) and long-term outcome (bowel/bladder dysfunction and paraplegia, 
neurologic deficit, and chronic back pain).
METHODS: Patients were divided into a PLF cohort and a PLF plus PLIF/TLIF 
cohort. Anterior techniques and multilevel interbody fusions were excluded. Each 
short-term complication and long-term outcome was assigned a numerical 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), based on time trade-off values in the Beaver 
Dam Health Outcomes Study. The cost data for short-term complications were 
calculated from charges accrued by the institution's finance sector, and the 
cost data for long-term outcomes were estimated from the literature. The 
difference in cost of PLF plus PLIF/TLIF from the cost of PLF alone divided by 
the difference in QALY equals the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER). We do not 
report any study funding sources or any study-specific appraisal of potential 
conflict of interest-associated biases in this article.
RESULTS: Of 137 first-time lumbar fusions for spondylolisthesis, 83 patients 
underwent PLF and 54 underwent PLIF/TLIF. The average time to reoperation was 
3.5 years. The mean QALY over 3.5 years was 2.81 in the PLF cohort versus 2.66 
in the PLIFo/TLIF cohort (p=.110). The mean 3.5-year costs of $54,827.05 after 
index interbody fusion were statistically higher than that of the $48,822.76 
after PLF (p=.042). The CER of interbody fusion to PLF after the first operation 
was -$46,699.40 per QALY; however, of the 27 patients requiring reoperation, the 
incident (reoperation) rate ratio was 7.89 times higher after PLF (2.91, 26.67). 
The CER after the first reoperation was -$24,429.04 per QALY (relative to PLF). 
Two patients in the PLF cohort required a second reoperation, whereas none 
required a second reoperation in the PLIF/TLIF cohort. Taken collectively, the 
total CER for the interbody fusion is $9,883.97 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The reoperation rate was statistically higher for PLF, whereas the 
negative CER for the initial operation and first reoperation favors PLF. 
However, when second reoperations were included, the CER for the interbody 
fusion became $9,883.97 per QALY, suggesting moderate long-term cost savings and 
better functional outcomes with the interbody fusion.

Aminosugars produced in the hexosamine pathway (HP) are utilized in protein 
glycosylation reactions involved in protein maturation and cellular signaling. 
Recent evidence revealed a role of the HP in protein quality control and ageing. 
Elevation of the HP product UDP-N-acetylglucosamine in the nematode 
Caenorhabditis elegans results in resistance towards toxic aggregation-prone 
proteins, and extended lifespan. Glutamine-fructose 6 phosphate aminotransferase 
(GFAT-1), the HP's key enzyme, is a target of the unfolded protein response 
(UPR). Thus, cardiac stress in mice results in GFAT-1 activation that triggers a 
cytoprotective response. Feeding of glucosamine to aged mice increases their 
life expectancy. Here we discuss HP activation and cellular protein quality 
control mechanisms that result in stress resistance and suppression of 
age-related proteotoxicity.

Fly ash, a coal combustion residue of thermal power plants and a source of 
multiple pollutants, has been recognized as an environmental hazard all over the 
world. Although it is known that fly ash effluent affects density, diversity and 
distribution of rotifers in drainage systems and receiving water bodies, the 
effect of fly ash effluent on the distributions of highly similar rotifer 
species remains unknown. In this study, the mtDNA COI genes of 90 individuals in 
Brachionus calyciflorus complex from Lake Hui (as a fly ash discharge water 
pond) and other two neighboring lakes (Lake Fengming and Lake Tingtang) were 
sequenced and analyzed, and the responses in selected life table demographic 
parameters (life expectancy at hatching, net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate 
of population increase and proportion of sexual offspring) of different rotifer 
populations to fly ash effluent were investigated. Overall, 72 mtDNA haplotypes 
were defined, and were split into two clades by the phylogenetic trees. The 
divergence of COI gene sequences between the two clades ranged from 11.8% 
to17.8%, indicating the occurrence of two sibling species (sibling species I and 
sibling species II). Sibling species I distributed in all the three lakes, 
showing strong capabilities for dispersal and colonization, which were supported 
by its higher level of gene flow (2.60-4.04) between the populations from Lake 
Hui and each of the other two lakes, longer life expectancy at hatching 
(101.6-148.2 h), and higher net reproductive rate (4.4-16.4 offspring/female) 
and intrinsic rate of population increase (0.60-0.98/d) when cultured in aerated 
tap water and fly ash effluent. Sibling species II distributed in both Lake 
Tingtang and Lake Fengming, showing that its dispersal existed between the two 
lakes. Considering that the distance between Lake Hui and Lake Fengming is 
shorter than that between Lake Tingtang and Lake Fengming, sibling species II is 
able to disperse at least from Lake Fengming to Lake Hui. The restricted 
distribution of sibling species II in Lake Hui might be attributed to its lower 
intrinsic rate of population increase (0.34-0.39/d) when cultured in aerated tap 
water and fiy ash effluent, which might be further lowered by the lower algal 
food level and quality in Lake Hui.

PURPOSE: We aimed to develop a clinical decision support tool for clinicians 
counseling patients with localized prostate cancer. The tool would provide 
estimates of patient life expectancy based on age, comorbidities and tumor 
characteristics. We reviewed the literature to find suitable prediction models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the literature for prediction models for life 
expectancy. Models were evaluated in terms of whether they provided an estimate 
of risk, incorporated comorbidities, were clinically feasible and gave plausible 
estimates. Clinical feasibility was defined in terms of whether the model 
provided coefficients and could be used in the initial consultation for men 
across a wide age range without an undue burden of data gathering.
RESULTS: Models in the literature were characterized by the use of life years 
rather than a risk of death, questionable approaches to comorbidities, 
implausible estimates, questionable recommendations and poor clinical 
feasibility. We found tools that involved applying an unvalidated approach to 
assessing comorbidities to a clearly erroneous life expectancy table, or 
requiring that a treatment decision be made before life expectancy could be 
calculated, or giving highly implausible estimates such as a substantial risk of 
prostate cancer specific mortality even for a highly comorbid 80-year-old with 
Gleason 6 disease.
CONCLUSIONS: We found gross deficiencies in current tools that predict risk of 
death from other causes. No existing model was suitable for implementation in 
our clinical decision support system.

Epidemiologic studies demonstrate that psoriasis is associated with shorter life 
expectancy, most frequently attributable to cardiovascular (CV) events. Although 
increased prevalence and incidence of CV risk factors for atherosclerosis have 
been reported in psoriatic patients, psoriasis likely plays an independent role 
in the increased cardiovascular risk, presumably linked to the chronic systemic 
inflammatory state. Consistently, preliminary investigations suggest that 
anti-inflammatory therapies may improve early subclinical vascular alterations 
and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on 
ischemic CV involvement in psoriatic patients, summarizing the prevalence and 
incidence of CV risk factors and CV events, as well as evidence on mechanisms of 
premature atherosclerosis and on effects of systemic anti-inflammatory therapies 
on CV risk profile. We performed a systematic review using Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and evaluated the 
quality of studies comparing drug treatments using Detsky score. Our review 
documented that psoriatic patients are at increased CV risk, related to raised 
prevalence and incidence of CV risk factor and to inflammatory status. However, 
available literature lacks of studies that establish appropriate targets for CV 
risk factors and assess the clinical value of screening for subclinical organ 
damage and the impact of disease-modifying therapies on CV risk profile in 
psoriatic patients. Awareness of raised CV risk in psoriatic patients should 
foster further research aimed at elucidating these aspects.

AIMS: Heart failure has been demonstrated in previous studies to have a dismal 
prognosis. However, the modern-day prognosis of patients with new onset heart 
failure diagnosed in the community managed within a disease management programme 
is not known. The purpose of this study is to report on prognosis of patients 
presenting with new onset heart failure in the community who are subsequently 
followed in a disease management program.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A review of patients referred to a rapid access heart 
failure diagnostic clinic between 2002 and 2012 was undertaken. Details of 
diagnosis, demographics, medical history, medications, investigations and 
mortality data were analysed. A total of 733 patients were seen in Rapid Access 
Clinic for potential new diagnosis of incident of heart failure. 38.9% (n=285) 
were diagnosed with heart failure, 40.7% (n=116) with HF-REF and 59.3% (n=169) 
with HF-PEF. There were 84 (29.5%) deaths in the group of patients diagnosed 
with heart failure; 41 deaths (35.3%) occurred in patients with HF-REF and 43 
deaths (25.4%) occurred in patients with HF-PEF. In patients with heart failure, 
52.4% (n=44) died from cardiovascular causes. 63.8% of HF patients were alive 
after 5 years resulting on average in a month per year loss of life expectancy 
over that period compared with aged matched simulated population.
CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based cohort, the prognosis of heart failure was 
better than reported in previous studies. This is likely due to the impact of 
prompt diagnosis, the improvement in therapies and care within a disease 
management structure.

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a feline coronavirus (FCoV) induced 
disease, is almost invariably fatal with median life expectancy measured in 
days. Current treatment options are, at best, palliative. The objectives of this 
study were to evaluate a panel of nineteen candidate compounds for antiviral 
activity against FCoV in vitro to determine viable candidates for therapy. A 
resazurin-based cytopathic effect inhibition assay, which detects viable cells 
through their reduction of the substrate resazurin to fluorescent resorufin, was 
developed for screening compounds for antiviral efficacy against FCoV. Plaque 
reduction and virus yield reduction assays were performed to confirm antiviral 
effects of candidate compounds identified during screening, and the possible 
antiviral mechanisms of action of these compounds were investigated using 
virucidal suspension assays and CPE inhibition and IFA-based time of addition 
assays. Three compounds, chloroquine, mefloquine, and hexamethylene amiloride 
demonstrated marked inhibition of virus induced CPE at low micromolar 
concentrations. Orthogonal assays confirmed inhibition of CPE was associated 
with significant reductions in viral replication. Selectivity indices calculated 
based on in vitro cytotoxicity screening and reductions in extracellular viral 
titre were 217, 24, and 20 for chloroquine, mefloquine, and hexamethylene 
amiloride respectively. Preliminary experiments performed to inform the 
antiviral mechanism of the compounds demonstrated all three acted at an early 
stage of viral replication. These results suggest that these direct acting 
antiviral compounds, or their derivatives, warrant further investigation for 
clinical use in cats with FIP.
