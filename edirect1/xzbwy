To analyze the cost-utility of oral dabigatran etexilate, enoxaparin sodium 
injection, and no intervention for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis 
after total hip or knee replacement (THR/TKR) surgery among Thai patients. A 
cost-utility analysis using a decision tree model was conducted using societal 
and healthcare payers' perspectives to simulate relevant costs and health 
outcomes covering a 3-month time horizon. Costs were adjusted to year 2014. The 
willingness-to-pay threshold of THB 160,000 (USD 4926) was used. One-way 
sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses using a Monte Carlo 
simulation were performed. Compared with no VTE prophylaxis, dabigatran and 
enoxaparin after THR and TKR surgery incurred higher costs and increased quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs). However, their incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios were high above the willingness to pay. Compared with enoxaparin, 
dabigatran for THR/TKR lowered VTE complications but increased bleeding cases; 
dabigatran was cost-saving by reducing the costs [by THB 3809.96 (USD 117.30) 
for THR] and producing more QALYs gained (by 0.00013 for THR). Dabigatran (vs. 
enoxaparin) had a 98 % likelihood of being cost effective. Dabigatran is 
cost-saving compared to enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis after THR or TKR under 
the Thai context. However, both medications are not cost-effective compared to 
no thromboprophylaxis.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a statistical model generating utility estimates for 
prostate cancer specific health states, using preference weights derived from 
the perspectives of prostate cancer patients, men at risk for prostate cancer, 
and society.
METHODS: Utility estimate values were calculated using standard gamble (SG) 
methodology. Study participants valued 18 prostate-specific health states with 
the five attributes: sexual function, urinary function, bowel function, pain, 
and emotional well-being. Appropriateness of model (linear regression, mixed 
effects, or generalized estimating equation) to generate prostate cancer utility 
estimates was determined by paired t-tests to compare observed and predicted 
values. Mixed-corrected standard SG utility estimates to account for loss 
aversion were calculated based on prospect theory.
RESULTS: 132 study participants assigned values to the health states (n = 40 men 
at risk for prostate cancer; n = 43 men with prostate cancer; n = 49 general 
population). In total, 792 valuations were elicited (six health states for each 
132 participants). The most appropriate model for the classification system was 
a mixed effects model; correlations between the mean observed and predicted 
utility estimates were greater than 0.80 for each perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: Developing a health-state classification system with preference 
weights for three different perspectives demonstrates the relative importance of 
main effects between populations. The predicted values for men with prostate 
cancer support the hypothesis that patients experiencing the disease state 
assign higher utility estimates to health states and there is a difference in 
valuations made by patients and the general population.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Insulin degludec is an insulin analog with an ultra-long 
duration of action that exhibits less intra-patient variability in its 
glucose-lowering activity, and reduces nocturnal, overall, and severe 
hypoglycemia relative to insulin glargine. The aim of the present study was to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec relative to insulin glargine 
in patients with: type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes receiving basal-only 
therapy (T2DBOT), and type 2 diabetes receiving basal-bolus therapy (T2DBB) in 
Denmark.
METHODS: A short-term (1 year) cost-utility model was developed to model insulin 
use, non-severe and severe hypoglycemia, and self-monitoring of blood glucose in 
patients using insulin degludec and insulin glargine from the perspective of a 
Danish healthcare payer. Where possible, data were derived from Danish patients 
with diabetes and meta-analyses of clinical trials comparing insulin degludec 
with insulin glargine. Using these characteristics, the model estimated costs 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained for the two insulin regimens in 
each of the three diabetes populations.
RESULTS: Insulin degludec dominated insulin glargine (i.e. reduced costs while 
improving quality-adjusted life expectancy) in patients with T1D and patients 
with type 2 diabetes using a basal-only insulin regimen. In the T2DBB cohort, 
insulin degludec was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
DKK 221,063 per QALY gained, which would be considered cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 30,000 (∼DKK 224,000) per QALY gained. 
Sensitivity analysis showed that results were most affected by changes in 
hypoglycemia rate ratio assumptions, but were broadly insensitive to changes in 
individual input parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Insulin degludec reduces incidence of hypoglycemia and improves 
quality-of-life in patients with diabetes. Over a 1-year time horizon, insulin 
degludec resulted in cost savings relative to insulin glargine in T1D and T2DBOT 
cohorts, while being cost-effective in T2DBB.

BACKGROUND: Thirty-day risk-standardized mortality rates after acute myocardial 
infarction are commonly used to evaluate and compare hospital performance. 
However, it is not known whether differences among hospitals in the early 
survival of patients with acute myocardial infarction are associated with 
differences in long-term survival.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, a study 
of Medicare beneficiaries who were hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction 
between 1994 and 1996 and who had 17 years of follow-up. We grouped hospitals 
into five strata that were based on case-mix severity. Within each case-mix 
stratum, we compared life expectancy among patients admitted to high-performing 
hospitals with life expectancy among patients admitted to low-performing 
hospitals. Hospital performance was defined by quintiles of 30-day 
risk-standardized mortality rates. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to 
calculate life expectancy.
RESULTS: The study sample included 119,735 patients with acute myocardial 
infarction who were admitted to 1824 hospitals. Within each case-mix stratum, 
survival curves of the patients admitted to hospitals in each risk-standardized 
mortality rate quintile separated within the first 30 days and then remained 
parallel over 17 years of follow-up. Estimated life expectancy declined as 
hospital risk-standardized mortality rate quintile increased. On average, 
patients treated at high-performing hospitals lived between 0.74 and 1.14 years 
longer, depending on hospital case mix, than patients treated at low-performing 
hospitals. When 30-day survivors were examined separately, there was no 
significant difference in unadjusted or adjusted life expectancy across hospital 
risk-standardized mortality rate quintiles.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients admitted to high-performing hospitals after 
acute myocardial infarction had longer life expectancies than patients treated 
in low-performing hospitals. This survival benefit occurred in the first 30 days 
and persisted over the long term. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood

Lifespan provides a discrete metric that is intuitively appealing and the 
assumption has been that healthspan is extended concomitant with lifespan. 
Medicine has been more successful at extending life than preserving health 
during aging. Interventions that extend lifespan in model organisms do not 
always result in a corresponding increase in healthspan, suggesting that 
lifespan and healthspan may be uncoupled. To understand how interventions that 
extend life affect healthspan, we need measures that distinguish between young 
and old animals. Here we measured age-related changes in healthspan in male and 
female C57BL/6JNia mice assessed at 4 distinct ages (4 months, 20 months, 28 
months and 32 months). Correlations between health parameters and age varied. 
Some parameters show consistent patterns with age across studies and in both 
sexes, others changed in one sex only and others showed no significant 
differences in mice of different ages. Few correlations existed among health 
assays, suggesting that physiological function in domains we assessed change 
independently in aging mice. With one exception, health parameters were not 
significantly associated with an increased probability of premature death. Our 
results show the need for more robust measures of murine health and suggest a 
potential disconnect between health and lifespan in mice.

Physical exercise is effective in improving functional outcomes in persons with 
multiple sclerosis (pwMS). We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of 
internet-based exercise training (e-training) for pwMS on health-related quality 
of life (HrQoL). Secondary outcomes were muscle strength, aerobic capacity, lung 
function, physical activity, and fatigue. This is a randomised, controlled trial 
with a wait-list control group. Data were collected at baseline, after three and 
six months, and analysed using a hybrid linear model. One-hundred twenty-six 
pwMS participated in the home-based aerobic (1×/week) and strength training 
(2×/week) intervention that was supervised and documented via an 
internet-platform. The intervention group received e-training for six months, 
and the control group received e-training after a three months waiting period. 
Significant differences between the groups were only observed for muscle 
strength (knee flexion (effect size ES = 0.3, p = 0.003), knee extension (ES = 
0.24, p = 0.015)), peak expiratory flow (ES = 0.2, p = 0.039), and sports 
activity (ES = 0.33, p = 0.001) after three months. E-training had no effect on 
HrQoL but did on muscle strength, lung function, and physical activity. It is a 
promising and feasible approach to facilitate large-scale, yet individual, 
training support.

Driven by technological progress, human life expectancy has increased greatly 
since the nineteenth century. Demographic evidence has revealed an ongoing 
reduction in old-age mortality and a rise of the maximum age at death, which may 
gradually extend human longevity. Together with observations that lifespan in 
various animal species is flexible and can be increased by genetic or 
pharmaceutical intervention, these results have led to suggestions that 
longevity may not be subject to strict, species-specific genetic constraints. 
Here, by analysing global demographic data, we show that improvements in 
survival with age tend to decline after age 100, and that the age at death of 
the world's oldest person has not increased since the 1990s. Our results 
strongly suggest that the maximum lifespan of humans is fixed and subject to 
natural constraints.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential years of life lost by road traffic injuries 
three years after the beginning of the Decade of Action for Traffic Safety.
METHODS: We analyzed the data of the Sistema de Informações sobre Mortalidade 
(SIM - Mortality Information System) related to road traffic injuries, in 2013. 
We estimated the crude and standardized mortality rates for Brazil and 
geographic regions. We calculated, for the Country, the proportional mortality 
according to age groups, education level, race/skin color, and type or quality 
of the victim while user of the public highway. We estimated the potential years 
of life lost according to sex.
RESULTS: The mortality rate in 2013 was of 21.0 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants 
for the Country. The Midwest region presented the highest rate (29.9 deaths per 
100,000 inhabitants). Most of the deaths by road traffic injuries took place 
with males (34.9 deaths per 100,000 males). More than half of the people who 
have died because of road traffic injuries were of black race/skin color, young 
adults (24.2%), individuals with low schooling (24.0%), and motorcyclists 
(28.5%). The mortality rate in the triennium 2011-2013 decreased 4.1%, but 
increased among motorcyclists. Across the Country, more than a million of 
potential years of life were lost, in 2013, because of road traffic injuries, 
especially in the age group of 20 to 29 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the high mortality rate is of over a million of 
potential years of life lost by road traffic injuries, especially among adults 
in productive age (early mortality), in only one year, representing extreme 
social cost arising from a cause of death that could be prevented. Despite the 
reduction of mortality by road traffic injuries from 2011 to 2013, the mortality 
rates increased among motorcyclists.
OBJETIVO: Estimar os anos potenciais de vida perdidos por acidente de transporte 
terrestre após três anos do início da Década de Ação pela Segurança no Trânsito.
MÉTODOS: Foram analisados os dados do Sistema de Informações sobre Mortalidade 
correspondentes aos acidentes de transporte terrestre, em 2013. Foram calculadas 
as taxas de mortalidade bruta e padronizada para o Brasil e regiões geográficas. 
Foi calculada, para o País, a mortalidade proporcional segundo faixas etárias, 
escolaridade, raça/cor da pele e tipo ou qualidade da vítima enquanto usuária da 
via pública. Foram estimados os anos potenciais de vida perdidos segundo sexo.
RESULTADOS: A taxa de mortalidade, em 2013, foi de 21,0 óbitos por 100 mil 
habitantes para o País. A região Centro-Oeste apresentou a taxa mais elevada 
(29,9 óbitos por 100 mil habitantes). A maioria dos óbitos por acidentes de 
transporte terrestre foi observada no sexo masculino (34,9 óbitos por 100 mil 
homens). Mais da metade das pessoas que faleceram em decorrência de acidentes de 
transporte terrestre eram da raça/cor da pele negra, adultos jovens (24,2%), 
indivíduos com baixa escolaridade (24,0%) e motociclistas (28,5%). A taxa de 
mortalidade, no triênio 2011 a 2013, apresentou redução de 4,1%, mas aumentou 
entre os motociclistas. Em todo o País, mais de um milhão de anos potenciais de 
vida foram perdidos, em 2013, devido aos acidentes de transporte terrestre, 
especialmente na faixa etária de 20 a 29 anos.
CONCLUSÕES: O impacto da alta taxa de mortalidade é de mais de um milhão de anos 
potenciais de vida perdidos por acidentes de transporte terrestre, 
principalmente entre adultos em idade produtiva (mortalidade precoce), em apenas 
um ano, representando extremo custo social decorrente de uma causa de óbito que 
poderia ser prevenida. Apesar da redução da mortalidade por acidentes de 
transporte terrestre de 2011 a 2013, as taxas de mortalidade aumentaram entre os 
motociclistas.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with atrial fibrillation frequently suffer from heart 
failure with preserved ejection fraction. At present there is no proven therapy 
to improve physical capacity and quality of life in participants with permanent 
atrial fibrillation with preserved left ventricular contractility.
OBJECTIVE: The single-centre IMproved exercise tolerance In heart failure With 
PReserved Ejection fraction by Spironolactone On myocardial fibrosiS In Atrial 
Fibrillation (IMPRESS-AF) trial aims to establish whether treatment with 
spironolactone as compared with placebo improves exercise tolerance 
(cardiopulmonary exercise testing), quality of life and diastolic function in 
patients with permanent atrial fibrillation.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A total of 250 patients have been randomised in this 
double-blinded trial for 2-year treatment with 25 mg daily dose of 
spironolactone or matched placebo. Included participants are 50 years old or 
older, have permanent atrial fibrillation and ejection fraction >55%. Exclusion 
criteria include contraindications to spironolactone, poorly controlled 
hypertension and presence of severe comorbidities with life expectancy <2 years. 
The primary outcome is improvement in exercise tolerance at 2 years and key 
secondary outcomes include quality of life (assessed using the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L 
(EQ-5D) and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLWHF) questionnaires), 
diastolic function and all-cause hospitalisation.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the National Research 
and Ethics Committee West Midlands-Coventry and Warwickshire (REC reference 
number 14/WM/1211). The results of the trial will be published in an 
international peer-reviewed journal.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a rigorous feasibility study for a future definitive 
parallel-group randomised controlled trial (RCT) and economic evaluation of an 
enhanced rehabilitation package for hip fracture.
SETTING: Recruitment from 3 acute hospitals in North Wales. Intervention 
delivery in the community.
PARTICIPANTS: Older adults (aged ≥65) who received surgical treatment for hip 
fracture, lived independently prior to fracture, had mental capacity (assessed 
by clinical team) and received rehabilitation in the North Wales area.
INTERVENTION: Remote randomisation to usual care (control) or usual 
care+enhanced rehabilitation package (intervention), including six additional 
home-based physiotherapy sessions delivered by a physiotherapist or technical 
instructor, novel information workbook and goal-setting diary.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary: Barthel Activities of Daily 
Living (BADL). Secondary measures included Nottingham Extended Activities of 
Daily Living scale (NEADL), EQ-5D, ICECAP capability, a suite of self-efficacy, 
psychosocial and service-use measures and costs. Outcome measures were assessed 
at baseline and 3-month follow-up by blinded researchers.
RESULTS: 62 participants were recruited, 61 randomised (control 32; intervention 
29) and 49 (79%) completed 3-month follow-up. Minimal differences occurred 
between the 2 groups for most outcomes, including BADL (adjusted mean difference 
0.5). The intervention group showed a medium-sized improvement in the NEADL 
relative to the control group, with an adjusted mean difference between groups 
of 3.0 (Cohen's d 0.63), and a trend for greater improvement in self-efficacy 
and mental health, but with small effect sizes. The mean cost of delivering the 
intervention was £231 per patient. There was a small relative improvement in 
quality-adjusted life year in the intervention group. No serious adverse events 
relating to the intervention were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: The trial methods were feasible in terms of eligibility, 
recruitment and retention. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the 
rehabilitation package should be tested in a phase III RCT.

BACKGROUND: South Korea has experienced rapid economic development and a 
substantial increase in life expectancy in an extremely short period. Whether 
this rapid development has been able to adequately address inequalities in 
health in South Korea may have important policy implications. This paper 
explores long-term trends in inequalities in mortality related to education in 
South Korea between 1970 and 2010.
METHODS: We used secondary data on population size and deaths in 1970 and 1980 
from a previously published study, and census and death certificate data from 
Statistics Korea from 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010. Trends in 
age-standardised mortality rates for men and women aged 25-64 according to 
education, as well as the rate ratio (RR), rate difference (RD), relative index 
of inequality (RII) and slope index of inequality (SII), were examined over the 
period 1970-2010.
RESULTS: Despite overall mortality declines of 70-80% in the past 4 decades, 
educational inequalities have increased or been stagnant. There was minimal 
decline in mortality since 1970 in South Koreans with only a primary or lower 
level of education. The RR and RD between tertiary education and primary or 
lower education increased over the study period, while the RII and the SII in 
both genders remained stable.
CONCLUSIONS: The South Korean experience over the past 40 years suggests that 
plummeting mortality rates and huge advances in education at the population 
level do not translate into reduced educational inequalities in mortality.

Suspension Array for Multiplex Detection of Eight Fungicide-Resistance Related 
Alleles in Botrytis cinerea.

A simple and high-throughput assay to detect fungicide resistance is required 
for large-scale monitoring of the emergence of resistant strains of Botrytis 
cinerea. Using suspension array technology performed on a Bio-Plex 200 System, 
we developed a single-tube allele-specific primer extension assay that can 
simultaneously detect eight alleles in one reaction. These eight alleles include 
E198 and 198A of the β-Tubulin gene (BenA), H272 and 272Y of the Succinate 
dehydrogenase iron-sulfur subunit gene (SdhB), I365 and 365S of the putative 
osmosensor histidine kinase gene (BcOS1), and F412 and 412S of the 
3-ketoreductase gene (erg27). This assay was first established and optimized 
with eight plasmid templates containing the DNA sequence variants BenA-E198, 
BenA-198A, SdhB-H272, SdhB-272Y, BcOS1-I365, BcOS1-365S, erg27-F412, and 
erg27-412S. Results indicated that none of the probes showed cross-reactivity 
with one another. The minimum limit of detection for these genotypes was one 
copy per test. Four mutant plasmids were mixed with 10 ng/μL wild-type genomic 
DNA in different ratios. Detection sensitivity of mutant loci was 0.45% for 
BenA-E198A, BcOS1-I365S, and erg27-F412S, and was 4.5% for SdhB-H272Y. A minimum 
quantity of 0.1 ng of genomic DNA was necessary to obtain reliable results. This 
is the first reported assay that can simultaneously detect mutations in BenA, 
SdhB, BcOS1, and erg27.

A cross-sectional study of perceived injustice and disability in hip 
osteoarthritis.

University of Alberta Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the correlation among severity of hip osteoarthritis, 
disability, and Perceived injustice.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort of 46 participants with unilateral hip 
osteoarthritis underwent hip range of motion measurements and completed the 
Injustice Experience Questionnaire (IEQ), the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis 
Outcome Score (HOOS), and a Croft radiological grading of osteoarthritis 
severity.
RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 62.7±10.4 years, and the cohort included 
27 females. The mean duration of symptoms was 46.9±20.6 months. The means of 
each of the five subscales of the HOOS were as follows: Pain, 62.3±9.4; Other 
Symptoms, 56.7±9.6; Function in Activities of Daily Living (ADL), 58.2±6.7; 
Function in Sport and Recreation (Sport/Rec), 58.1±6.7; and Hip-Related Quality 
of Life (QOL) 59.9±7.5. The combined mean hip range of motion (abduction, 
adduction, flexion, extension, external rotation, internal rotation) was 
215.9±10.9 degrees. The mean IEQ score (Perceived injustice) was 12.0±1.7. Of 
the available factors, only QOL, hip range of motion, and the Croft radiological 
osteoarthritis grade predicted Perceived injustice scores, with an R-squared of 
0.81 in multiple regression analysis.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with unilateral osteoarthritis, more 
severe disease (as measured by restricted range of motion and radiological 
severity) was highly correlated with higher levels of Perceived injustice. 
Perceived injustice may thus reflect an appropriate response to the severity of 
the disease and is thus more likely a result of the disease process and 
subsequent disability rather than a cause of disability.

The Cao Vit gibbon (Nomascus nasutus) has only one population with about 110 
individuals living in a degraded karst forest along the China-Vietnam border. 
Investigation of food choice in relation to chemical nutrition will offer 
important insights into its conservation. We studied the food choice of two 
groups of Cao Vit gibbons using instantaneous scan sampling in Bangliang 
National Nature Reserve, Guangxi, China, over 4 years, and analyzed the chemical 
components (total nitrogen, TN; water-soluble sugar, WSS; crude fat, CF; neutral 
detergent fiber, NDF; acid detergent fiber, ADF; acid detergent lignin, ADL; 
condensed tannin, CT; and ash) of 48 food plant parts and 22 non-food plant 
parts. Fruits and figs that are rich in sugar are important food resources for 
gibbons. For other food types, flowers are a good source of total nitrogen and 
carbohydrates, and leaves and buds provide sources of protein and minerals. Cao 
Vit gibbons selected fruits that contain less total nitrogen, less acid 
detergent fiber and more water-soluble sugar than non-food fruits. Several food 
species that were heavily consumed by Cao Vit gibbons are suggested as potential 
tree species for ongoing habitat restoration.

Sepsis is life-threating organ dysfunction due to infection. Incidence of sepsis 
is increasing and the short-term mortality is improving, generating more sepsis 
survivors. These sepsis survivors suffer from additional morbidities such as 
higher risk of readmissions, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment and of 
death, for years following index sepsis episode. In the first year following 
index sepsis episode, approximately 60 % of sepsis survivors have at least one 
rehospitalisation episode, which is most often due to infection and one in six 
sepsis survivors die. Sepsis survivors also have a higher risk of cognitive 
impairment and cardiovascular disease contributing to the reduced life 
expectancy seen in this population, when assessed with life table comparisons. 
For optimal design of interventional trials to reduce these bad outcomes in 
sepsis survivors, in-depth understanding of major risk factors for these morbid 
events, their modifiability and a causal relationship to the pathobiology of 
sepsis is essential. This review highlights the recent advances, clinical and 
methodological challenges in our understanding of these morbid events in sepsis 
survivors.

Seamless Ligation Cloning Extract (SLiCE) Method Using Cell Lysates from 
Laboratory Escherichia coli Strains and its Application to SLiP Site-Directed 
Mutagenesis.

Cell lysates from laboratory Escherichia coli strains endogenously exhibit 
homologous recombination activity, which can be utilized for seamless DNA 
cloning in vitro. This method, termed Seamless Ligation Cloning Extract (SLiCE) 
cloning, enables high cloning efficiency with simultaneous integration of two 
unpurified DNA fragments into a vector. In addition, the SLiCE method is highly 
cost-effective, as several laboratory E. coli strains may be utilized as sources 
of SLiCE. Previously, the SLiCE technique has been applied to site-directed 
mutagenesis to develop a novel technique termed SLiCE-mediated polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR)-based site-directed mutagenesis (SLiP site-directed mutagenesis). 
Two DNA fragments containing a mutation site can be simultaneously integrated 
into a vector while avoiding the introduction of undesirable mutations in the 
vector. Therefore, SLiP site-directed mutagenesis simplifies multiple procedures 
involved in PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis such as overlap extension method 
PCR or the Megaprimer method.

The aim of this study is to compare radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with 
stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) 
smaller than 3 cm. A Markov cohort model was developed to simulate a cohort of 
patients aged 60-65 years with small HCCs who had undergone either RFA or SBRT 
and were followed up over their remaining life expectancy. The inclusion 
criteria were: (1) HCC ≤3 cm in diameter with ≤ 3 nodules; (2) absence of 
extrahepatic metastasis or portal/hepatic vein invasion; (3) Child-Pugh Class A 
or B. Twenty thousand virtual patients were randomly assigned to undergo RFA or 
SBRT. Predicted life expectancy was 6.452 and 6.371 years in the RFA and SBRT 
groups, respectively. The probability distributions of the expected overall 
survival were nearly identical. The 95% confidence intervals were 6.25-6.66 and 
6.17-6.58 years for RFA and SBRT, respectively. The difference between RFA and 
SBRT was insignificant (P = 0.2884). Two-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated 
that if the tumor is 2-3 cm, SBRT is the preferred treatment option. Our Markov 
model has shown that expected overall survival of SBRT is nearly identical to 
RFA in HCCs smaller than 3 cm, but SBRT may have an advantage for tumors 2 cm 
and larger. A randomized trial is required to confirm these findings.

[Periprosthetic Acetabulum Fractures].

[Article in German]

In contrast to periprosthetic fractures of the femur, periprosthetic fractures 
of the acetabulum are rare complications - both primary fractures and fractures 
in revision surgery. This topic is largely under-reported in the literature; 
there are a few case reports and no long term results. Due to an increase in 
life expectancy, the level of patients' activity and the number of primary joint 
replacements, one has to expect a rise in periprosthetic complications in 
general and periprosthetic acetabular fractures in particular. This kind of 
fracture can be intra-, peri- or postoperative. Intraoperative fractures are 
especially associated with insertion of cementless press-fit acetabular 
components or revision surgery. Postoperative periprosthetic fractures of the 
acetabulum are usually related to osteolysis, for example, due to polyethylene 
wear. There are also traumatic fractures and fractures missed intraoperatively 
that lead to some kind of insufficiency fracture. Periprosthetic fractures of 
the acetabulum are treated conservatively if the implant is stable and the 
fracture is not dislocated. If surgery is needed, there are many possible 
different surgical techniques and challenging approaches. That is why 
periprosthetic fractures of the acetabulum should be treated by experts in 
pelvic surgery as well as revision arthroplasty and the features specific to the 
patient, fracture and prosthetic must always be considered.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent to which financial assistance, in the form of 
subsidies for life-extending treatments (LETs) or cash payouts, distorts the 
demand for end-of-life treatments.
METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was administered to 290 patients with 
cancer in Singapore to elicit preferences for LETs and only palliative care 
(PC). Responses were fitted to a latent class conditional logistic regression 
model. We also quantified patients' willingness to pay to avoid and willingness 
to accept a less effective LET or PC-only. We then simulated the effects of 
various LET subsidy and cash payout policies on treatment choices.
RESULTS: We identified three classes of patients according to their preferences. 
The first class (26.1% of the sample) had a strong preference for PC and were 
willing to give up life expectancy gains and even pay for receiving only PC. The 
second class (29.8% of the sample) had a strong preference for LETs and 
preferred to extend life regardless of cost or quality of life. The final class 
(44.1% of the sample) preferred LETs to PC, but actively traded off costs and 
length and quality of life when making end-of-life treatment choices. Policy 
simulations showed that LET subsidies increase demand for LETs at the expense of 
demand for PC, but an equivalent cash payout was not shown to distort demand.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancer have heterogeneous end-of-life preferences. 
LET subsidies and cash payouts have differing effects on the use of LETs. 
Policymakers should be mindful of these differences when designing health care 
financing schemes for patients with life-limiting illnesses.

OBJECTIVES: To assess how suitable current chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) cost-effectiveness models are to evaluate personalized treatment options 
for COPD by exploring the type of heterogeneity included in current models and 
by validating outcomes for subgroups of patients.
METHODS: A consortium of COPD modeling groups completed three tasks. First, they 
reported all patient characteristics included in the model and provided the 
level of detail in which the input parameters were specified. Second, groups 
simulated disease progression, mortality, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
and costs for hypothetical subgroups of patients that differed in terms of sex, 
age, smoking status, and lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
[FEV1] % predicted). Finally, model outcomes for exacerbations and mortality for 
subgroups of patients were validated against published subgroup results of two 
large COPD trials.
RESULTS: Nine COPD modeling groups participated. Most models included sex 
(seven), age (nine), smoking status (six), and FEV1% predicted (nine), mainly to 
specify disease progression and mortality. Trial results showed higher 
exacerbation rates for women (found in one model), higher mortality rates for 
men (two models), lower mortality for younger patients (four models), and higher 
exacerbation and mortality rates in patients with severe COPD (four models).
CONCLUSIONS: Most currently available COPD cost-effectiveness models are able to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of personalized treatment on the basis of sex, 
age, smoking, and FEV1% predicted. Treatment in COPD is, however, more likely to 
be personalized on the basis of clinical parameters. Two models include several 
clinical patient characteristics and are therefore most suitable to evaluate 
personalized treatment, although some important clinical parameters are still 
missing.
