(VulF). The VulF cells thereafter constrict their lateral membranes along the 
apicobasal axis to extend the lumen dorsally. Lateral, but not apical, VulF 
constriction requires the prior invasion of the anchor cell (AC). The invading 
AC extends actin-rich protrusions toward VulF, resulting in the formation of a 
direct AC-VulF interface. The recruitment of the F-BAR-domain protein TOCA-1 to 
the AC-VulF interface induces the accumulation of force-generating actomyosin, 
causing a switch from apical to lateral membrane constriction and the dorsal 
extension of the lumen. Invasive cells may induce shape changes in adjacent 
cells to penetrate their target tissues.

BACKGROUND: The UK National Health Service Emergency Departments (ED) have 
recently faced increasing attendance rates. This study investigated associations 
of general practice and practice population characteristics with emergency care 
service attendance rates.
METHODS: A longitudinal design with practice-level measures of access and 
continuity of care, patient population demographics and use of emergency care 
for the financial years 2009/10 to 2012/13. The main outcome measures were 
self-referred discharged ED attendance rate, and combined self-referred 
discharged ED, self-referred Walk-in Centre (WiC) and self-referred Minor 
Injuries Unit (MIU) attendance rate per 1000 patients. Multilevel models 
estimated adjusted regression coefficients for relationships between patients' 
emergency attendance rates and patients' reported satisfaction with opening 
hours and waiting time at the practice, proportion of patients having a 
preferred GP, and use of WiC and MIU, both between practices, and within 
practices over time.
RESULTS: Practice characteristics associated with higher ED attendance rates 
included lower percentage of patients satisfied with waiting time (0.22 per 1% 
decrease, 95%CI 0.02 to 0.43) and lower percentage having a preferred GP (0.12 
per 1% decrease, 95%CI 0.02 to 0.21). Population influences on higher attendance 
included more elderly, more female and more unemployed patients, and lower male 
life-expectancy and urban conurbation location. Net reductions in ED attendance 
were only seen for practices whose WiC or MIU attendance was high, above the 
60th centile for MIU and above the 75th centile for WiC. Combined emergency care 
attendance fell over time if more patients within a practice were satisfied with 
opening hours (-0.26 per 1% increase, 95%CI -0.45 to -0.08).
CONCLUSION: Practices with more patients satisfied with waiting time, having a 
preferred GP, and using MIU and WIC services, had lower ED attendance. Increases 
over time in attendance at MIUs, and patient satisfaction with opening hours was 
associated with reductions in service use.

In the search for potential vaccine candidates for the control of human 
lymphatic filariasis, we recently identified calponin-like protein, that 
regulates actin/myosin interactions, in a proinflammatory fraction F8 
(45.24-48.64kDa) of Brugia malayi adult worms. In the present study, the gene 
was cloned, expressed, and the recombinant Calponin of B. malayi (r-ClpBm) was 
prepared and characterized. r-ClpBm bears homology with OV9M of Onchocerca 
volvulus, a non-lymphatic filariid that causes loss of vision and cutaneous 
pathology. r-ClpBm was found to be a ∼45kDa protein that folds into a 
predominantly α-helix conformation. The protective efficacy of r-ClpBm against 
B. malayi infection in Mastomys coucha was investigated by assessing the course 
of microfilaraemia and adult worm burden in the host immunized with r-ClpBm and 
subsequently infected with infective third stage larvae (L3). Expression of the 
Calponin was detected in all life stages (microfilariae, L3, L4, L5 and adults) 
of the parasite and immunization with r-ClpBm partially protected M. coucha 
against establishment of infection as inferred by ∼42% inhibition in parasite 
burden. Upregulated cellular proliferation, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-4, nitric 
oxide (NO) release, expression of iNOS, and specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2b in 
immunized animals correlated with parasitological findings. r-ClpBm immunization 
caused degranulation in majority of mast cells indicating possible involvement 
of mast cell products in reducing the parasite survival. It appears that complex 
mechanisms including Th1, Th2, NO and mast cells are involved in the clearance 
of infection. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on cloning, 
expression of the gene and purification of r-ClpBm, determination of its 
secondary structure and its ability to partially prevent establishment of B. 
malayi infection. Thus, r-ClpBm may further be studied and developed in 
combination with other protective molecules of B. malayi as a component of 
potential filarial cocktail vaccine candidate.

BACKGROUND: We investigated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a 
targeted human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program for young (15-26) men 
who have sex with men (MSM).
METHODS: We developed a compartmental model to project HPV epidemic trajectories 
in MSM for three vaccination scenarios: a boys program, a targeted program for 
young MSM only and the combination of the two over 2017-2036. We assessed the 
gain in quality-adjusted-life-years (QALY) in 190,000 Australian MSM.
RESULTS: A targeted program for young MSM only that achieved 20% coverage per 
year, without a boys program, will prevent 49,283 (31,253-71,500) cases of 
anogenital warts, 191 (88-319) person-years living with anal cancer through 
2017-2036 but will only stablise anal cancer incidence. In contrast, a boys 
program will prevent 82,056 (52,100-117,164) cases of anogenital warts, 447 
(204-725) person-years living with anal cancers through 2017-2036 and see major 
declines in anal cancer. This can reduce 90% low- and high-risk HPV in young MSM 
by 2024 and 2032, respectively, but will require vaccinating ≥84% of boys. 
Adding a targeted program for young MSM to an existing boys program would 
prevent an additional 14,912 (8479-21,803) anogenital wart and 91 (42-152) 
person-years living with anal cancer. In combination with a boys' program, a 
catch-up program for young MSM will cost an additional $AUD 6788 ($4628-11,989) 
per QALY gained, but delaying its implementation reduced its cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: A boys program that achieved coverage of about 84% will result in a 
90% reduction in HPV. A targeted program for young MSM is cost-effective if 
timely implemented.

BACKGROUND: By 2022, there will be 18 million predicted cancer survivors, which 
is an estimated 30% more than the number of survivors in 2012. In prostate 
cancer alone, the most common cancer in American men other than skin cancer, 1 
in 7 men will be diagnosed during their lifetime. Nevertheless, only 
approximately 1 in 39 will actually die of the disease. Although life expectancy 
is often good, these men have multiple treatment management options to choose 
from, including active surveillance, surgery, or radiotherapy, each of which 
carries its own array of long-term adverse effects. The same applies to renal 
cancer where patient have to sift through information to decide among active 
surveillance, partial nephrectomy, racial nephrectomy, robotic vs. open surgery, 
and ablation.
BASIC PROCEDURES: Ultimately, patient, providers, and stakeholders lack 
high-quality evidence to effectively guide treatment decisions, and these 
decisions become even harder to discern when considering end-of-life care, 
palliative care, and the ethics regarding the new End of Life Option Act. As of 
November 1, 2016, the number of open urologic cancer clinical trials listed on 
ClinicalTrials.gov was 843.
MAIN FINDINGS: Although we continue to make tremendous strides in urologic 
cancer care, our options for choosing the best treatment from a patient and 
provider standpoint are seemingly growing murkier. We need to continue to 
understand how health-related quality of life varies from patient to patient, 
and ultimately, incorporate patient preferences and values into the treatment 
decision in order to make high-quality treatment decisions.
CONCLUSIONS: The remained of this articles will focus on the significant strides 
made in urologic oncology regarding these difficult decisions from localized 
disease to end-of-life care and also will detail what needs to be done as we 
continue to pivot forward.

Prospective randomized data are lacking, but current clinical expert guidelines 
recommend annual screening examinations, including laboratory assessments and 
various imaging modalities (e.g. CT, MRI, scintigraphy and EUS) for patients 
with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). Routine screening is proposed 
to detect and localize neuroendocrine manifestations as early as possible. The 
goal is timely intervention to improve quality of life and to increase life 
expectancy by preventing the development of life-threatening hormonal syndromes 
and/or metastatic disease. In recent years, some studies compared different and 
new imaging methods regarding their sensitivity and utility in MEN1 patients. 
This present article reviews the proposed diagnostic tools for MEN1 screening as 
well as potential future perspectives.

Combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) has significantly improved the life 
expectancy of people living with HIV. The life-long nature of cART increases the 
risk of side effects, which in some cases may have been caused by specific 
genetic characteristics. Patients treated with atazanavir (ATV) boosted with 
ritonavir (rit), which is a protease inhibitor used for the treatment of HIV, 
present with elevated bilirubin levels, at high proportions. ATV/rit-related 
hyperbilirubinemia has been previously associated with genetic characteristics 
in uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme. The prevalence of 
the UGT1A1*28 variant, which is the most frequent polymorphism in the UGT1A1 
superfamily, has been found to range between 9% and ~60% with the highest 
frequency in Africa. Pharmacokinetics for additional HIV drugs, such as the 
integrase inhibitors Raltegravir and Elvitegravir, has been also shown to be 
influenced by UGT1A1 polymorphisms. Pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics testing 
can be useful to identify a patient's susceptibility to drug toxicity and 
therefore to facilitate selection of the optimal long-term suppressive regimen.

OBJECTIVE: Unilateral analgesia often occurs with epidural analgesia. 
Traditional methods of troubleshooting this problem can be insufficient in 
obtaining adequate pain relief in a timely manner for terminal cancer patients. 
This case report demonstrates a safe and effective solution which can be 
utilized in these circumstances.
CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old female with stage IV pancreatic cancer and life 
expectancy of a few weeks presented to the interventional pain clinic with 
intractable sacral pain. The decision to place an epidural catheter and external 
pump for analgesia was made. An epidural catheter placed at the L5-S1 level 
showed contrast spread only along the right nerve roots and a test dose produced 
only right-sided analgesia. Suspecting compartmentalization of the epidural 
space, a second left-sided epidural catheter was placed and bilateral analgesia 
was achieved by using both catheters. This dual catheter technique gave the 
patient effective bilateral analgesia until she passed away several weeks later.
CONCLUSION: The bilateral epidural catheter technique is safe and effective in 
patients who present with persistent unilateral epidural analgesia despite 
exhausting traditional solutions.

Hybrid Brain-Computer Interface Techniques for Improved Classification Accuracy 
and Increased Number of Commands: A Review.

Hong KS(1)(2), Khan MJ(1).

Korea.

Busan, South Korea.

In this article, non-invasive hybrid brain-computer interface (hBCI) 
technologies for improving classification accuracy and increasing the number of 
commands are reviewed. Hybridization combining more than two modalities is a new 
trend in brain imaging and prosthesis control. Electroencephalography (EEG), due 
to its easy use and fast temporal resolution, is most widely utilized in 
combination with other brain/non-brain signal acquisition modalities, for 
instance, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), electromyography (EMG), 
electrooculography (EOG), and eye tracker. Three main purposes of hybridization 
are to increase the number of control commands, improve classification accuracy 
and reduce the signal detection time. Currently, such combinations of 
EEG + fNIRS and EEG + EOG are most commonly employed. Four principal components 
(i.e., hardware, paradigm, classifiers, and features) relevant to accuracy 
improvement are discussed. In the case of brain signals, motor 
imagination/movement tasks are combined with cognitive tasks to increase active 
brain-computer interface (BCI) accuracy. Active and reactive tasks sometimes are 
combined: motor imagination with steady-state evoked visual potentials (SSVEP) 
and motor imagination with P300. In the case of reactive tasks, SSVEP is most 
widely combined with P300 to increase the number of commands. Passive BCIs, 
however, are rare. After discussing the hardware and strategies involved in the 
development of hBCI, the second part examines the approaches used to increase 
the number of control commands and to enhance classification accuracy. The 
future prospects and the extension of hBCI in real-time applications for daily 
life scenarios are provided.

PURPOSE: To report a rare case of periorbital emphysema concurrent with 
cervicofacial and mediastinal emphysema in an elderly woman who underwent upper 
gastrointestinal endoscopy for chronic liver disease.
CASE REPORT: An elderly woman with decompensated chronic liver disease presented 
with features of periorbital, facial, and mediastinal emphysema, characterized 
with crepitant swelling over the right periorbital area, face, neck, and 
mediastinum after undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. There was no 
history of trauma or Valsalva maneuver. Ocular findings were stable with no 
evidence of orbital compartmental syndrome. Urgent computed tomography scans of 
the orbit and chest were performed, and emergency systemic treatment with 
nasogastric decompression and antibiotics was initiated. However, she suddenly 
collapsed and succumbed despite all resuscitative efforts.
CONCLUSION: Our case demonstrates that periorbital emphysema can occur following 
procedures such as upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, in the eyes without history 
of local trauma. This complication should be suspected especially if there is 
associated cervicofacial and mediastinal emphysema. Subcutaneous emphysema is 
usually self-resolving; however, extension of air into deeper planes can cause 
dangerous complications such as blindness due to orbital emphysema or mortality 
due to mediastinal emphysema. Hence, prompt diagnosis and urgent intervention 
are crucial to avoid vision and life threatening complications.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease, which 
involves the progressive degeneration of motor neurons. ALS has long been 
considered a disease of the grey matter; however, pathological alterations of 
the white matter (WM), including axonal loss, axonal demyelination and 
oligodendrocyte death, have been reported in patients with ALS. The present 
review examined motor neuron death as the primary cause of ALS and evaluated the 
associated WM damage that is guided by neuronal‑glial interactions. Previous 
studies have suggested that WM damage may occur prior to the death of motor 
neurons, and thus may be considered an early indicator for the diagnosis and 
prognosis of ALS. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying early‑onset 
WM damage in ALS have yet to be elucidated. The present review explored the 
detailed anatomy of WM and identified several pathological mechanisms that may 
be implicated in WM damage in ALS. In addition, it associated the 
pathophysiological alterations of WM, which may contribute to motor neuron death 
in ALS, with similar mechanisms of WM damage that are involved in multiple 
sclerosis (MS). Furthermore, the early detection of WM damage in ALS, using 
neuroimaging techniques, may lead to earlier therapeutic intervention, using 
immunomodulatory treatment strategies similar to those used in 
relapsing‑remitting MS, aimed at delaying WM damage in ALS. Early therapeutic 
approaches may have the potential to delay motor neuron damage and thus prolong 
the survival of patients with ALS. The therapeutic interventions that are 
currently available for ALS are only marginally effective. However, early 
intervention with immunomodulatory drugs may slow the progression of WM damage 
in the early stages of ALS, thus delaying motor neuron death and increasing the 
life expectancy of patients with ALS.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a disease that has a bad influence on the 
patient's prognosis. Recently, the possibility of therapy has dramatically 
changed. Nowadays, the treatment of this disease is concerned mainly with the 
pathophysiological target. In clinical practice, it is important to start 
therapy at the appropriate time, when the patient is qualified because of an 
unsatisfactory examination result or improve therapy when the patient is getting 
worse. The understanding of prognosis factors in pulmonary arterial hypertension 
is necessary, because it is used to determine the length of patients' life 
expectancy. In September of 2015, new guidelines of ESC concerning the diagnosis 
and treatment of pulmonary hypertension have been presented. In our article we 
centered on the prognosis factor in pulmonary arterial hypertension. This 
document is a continuation of ESC guidelines. Many of the most contemporary 
articles are here summarized.

INTRODUCTION: Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia affects 70% to 80% of all spinal 
cord injury patients, resulting in increased risk of urinary tract infections 
(UTIs) and potential exposure to antimicrobial resistance. In Brazil, local 
guidelines recommend intermittent catheterization as the best method for bladder 
emptying, and two catheter types are available: the conventional uncoated PVC 
and the hydrophilic coated catheters.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two types of catheters for 
intermittent catheterization from the perspective of the Brazilian public 
healthcare system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate cost-effectiveness in 
those with spinal cord injuries. A primary analysis was conducted on all 
possible adverse events, and a secondary analysis was performed with urinary 
tract infections as the only relevant parameter. The results were presented as 
cost per life years gained (LYG), per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and per 
number of urinary tract infections (UTIs) avoided.
RESULTS: The base scenario of all adverse events shows a cost-effective result 
of hydrophilic coated catheters compared to uncoated PVC catheters at 57,432 BRL 
(Brazilian Reais) per LYG and 122,330 BRL per QALY. The secondary scenario 
showed that the use of hydrophilic coated catheters reduces the total number of 
UTIs, indicating that an additional cost of hydrophilic coated catheters of 
31,240 BRL over a lifetime will reduce lifetime UTIs by 6%.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the higher unit value, the use of hydrophilic coated 
catheters is a cost-effective treatment from the perspective of the Brazilian 
public healthcare system.

The Global Burden of Disease 2015 study aims to use all available data of 
sufficient quality to generate reliable and valid prevalence, incidence, and 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) estimates of oral conditions for the period 
of 1990 to 2015. Since death as a direct result of oral diseases is rare, DALY 
estimates were based on years lived with disability, which are estimated only on 
those persons with unmet need for dental care. We used our data to assess 
progress toward the Federation Dental International, World Health Organization, 
and International Association for Dental Research's oral health goals of 
reducing the level of oral diseases and minimizing their impact by 2020. Oral 
health has not improved in the last 25 y, and oral conditions remained a major 
public health challenge all over the world in 2015. Due to demographic changes, 
including population growth and aging, the cumulative burden of oral conditions 
dramatically increased between 1990 and 2015. The number of people with 
untreated oral conditions rose from 2.5 billion in 1990 to 3.5 billion in 2015, 
with a 64% increase in DALYs due to oral conditions throughout the world. 
Clearly, oral diseases are highly prevalent in the globe, posing a very serious 
public health challenge to policy makers. Greater efforts and potentially 
different approaches are needed if the oral health goal of reducing the level of 
oral diseases and minimizing their impact is to be achieved by 2020. Despite 
some challenges with current measurement methodologies for oral diseases, 
measurable specific oral health goals should be developed to advance global 
public health.

The emerging discipline of evolutionary medicine is breaking new ground in 
understanding why people become ill. However, the value of evolutionary analyses 
of human physiology and behaviour is only beginning to be recognised in the 
field of public health. Core principles come from life history theory, which 
analyses the allocation of finite amounts of energy between four competing 
functions-maintenance, growth, reproduction, and defence. A central tenet of 
evolutionary theory is that organisms are selected to allocate energy and time 
to maximise reproductive success, rather than health or longevity. Ecological 
interactions that influence mortality risk, nutrient availability, and pathogen 
burden shape energy allocation strategies throughout the life course, thereby 
affecting diverse health outcomes. Public health interventions could improve 
their own effectiveness by incorporating an evolutionary perspective. In 
particular, evolutionary approaches offer new opportunities to address the 
complex challenges of global health, in which populations are differentially 
exposed to the metabolic consequences of poverty, high fertility, infectious 
diseases, and rapid changes in nutrition and lifestyle. The effect of specific 
interventions is predicted to depend on broader factors shaping life expectancy. 
Among the important tools in this approach are mathematical models, which can 
explore probable benefits and limitations of interventions in silico, before 
their implementation in human populations.

Multivariate analysis refers to statistical techniques that simultaneously look 
at three or more variables in relation to the subjects under investigation with 
the aim of identifying or clarifying the relationships between them. These 
techniques have been broadly classified as dependence techniques, which explore 
the relationship between one or more dependent variables and their independent 
predictors, and interdependence techniques, that make no such distinction but 
treat all variables equally in a search for underlying relationships. Multiple 
linear regression models a situation where a single numerical dependent variable 
is to be predicted from multiple numerical independent variables. Logistic 
regression is used when the outcome variable is dichotomous in nature. The 
log-linear technique models count type of data and can be used to analyze 
cross-tabulations where more than two variables are included. Analysis of 
covariance is an extension of analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which an 
additional independent variable of interest, the covariate, is brought into the 
analysis. It tries to examine whether a difference persists after "controlling" 
for the effect of the covariate that can impact the numerical dependent variable 
of interest. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is a multivariate 
extension of ANOVA used when multiple numerical dependent variables have to be 
incorporated in the analysis. Interdependence techniques are more commonly 
applied to psychometrics, social sciences and market research. Exploratory 
factor analysis and principal component analysis are related techniques that 
seek to extract from a larger number of metric variables, a smaller number of 
composite factors or components, which are linearly related to the original 
variables. Cluster analysis aims to identify, in a large number of cases, 
relatively homogeneous groups called clusters, without prior information about 
the groups. The calculation intensive nature of multivariate analysis has so far 
precluded most researchers from using these techniques routinely. The situation 
is now changing with wider availability, and increasing sophistication of 
statistical software and researchers should no longer shy away from exploring 
the applications of multivariate methods to real-life data sets.

Disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) was compared in six countries taking part 
in the Cross-national Determinants of Quality of Life and Health Services for 
the Elderly (CLESA) project. Data from six existing longitudinal studies were 
used: TamELSA (Tampere, Finland), CALAS (Israel), ILSA (Italy), LASA (The 
Netherlands), Aging in Leganés (Leganés, Spain) and SATSA (Sweden). A harmonised 
four-item disability measure (bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting) was 
used to calculate DFLE; the harmonised measure was dichotomised into 
'independent in all four activities' vs. 'dependent in at least one'. 
Calculations of DFLE were made using the multistate life table approach and the 
IMaCh program (INED/EuroREVES, http://eurorevesinedfr/imach/) for subjects aged 
65-89 years. Prevalence ratios of disability varied significantly across 
countries, with Italy and Leganés having the highest percentages among men and 
among women, respectively, while The Netherlands presented the lowest for both 
sexes. At 75 years of age the estimated total life expectancy among men ranged 
from 7.8 years in Tampere and Sweden to 9.0 years in Israel; among women it 
ranged from 9.5 years in Israel to 11.6 years in Italy. For both sexes Italy 
showed the lowest total life expectancy without disability (72% among men, 61% 
among women) and Sweden the highest (89% among men and 71% among women). The 
results yielded a north/south gradient, with residents in Tampere, The 
Netherlands and Sweden expected to spend a higher percentage of their lives 
without disability than those in Italy, Israel and Leganés.

Aging parents and their middle-aged children: demographic and psychosocial 
challenges.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of an extended lifespan of 
parents on middle-aged women and men from a demographic, sociological and 
psychological perspective. Based on Swiss data, three main research questions 
are investigated and discussed in three different sections: (a) How far has the 
common lifespan of children and parents been extended and how does it affect 
kinship structures? (b) How accurate is the term of "sandwich generation" in 
this context? (c) Which are the psychological concomitants-in terms of filial 
maturity-of being reinvolved with one's old parents in mid-life? The demographic 
analyses illustrate a considerable extension of common lifespan of children and 
parents. Combined with low fertility rates this results in rapidly increasing 
parent-support ratios. A sociological approach analysing the concept of 
"sandwich generation" indicates that, for women, a new kind of double burden 
(professional work and family care) is more widespread than being 'sandwiched' 
between the youngest and the oldest generation. Finally, in the third section, 
results are reported from a longitudinal study of middle-aged persons living in 
different social contexts (such as living or not living with a partner and/or 
children) on the intrapsychic concomitants of becoming reinvolved with one's 
parents. The response patterns reveal a considerable intergenerational 
ambivalence. Although the possibility to help old parents depends heavily on 
living context and is a question of available resources, the willingness to help 
is also closely related to psychological variables such as attachment.

In countries with low mortality rates, the quality of the years of life is more 
important to consider than total life expectancy (TLE). Disability-free life 
expectancy (DFLE) is one of the most relevant indicators of health and the 
quality of life. This paper aims to estimate TLE and DFLE with four levels of 
severity of disability and to explore gender and educational differences in 
older French people. In this cohort study, four levels of disability severity 
were distinguished, disability being evaluated for mobility, instrumental and 
basic activities of daily living. For each level, TLE and DFLE were calculated 
using multi-state models from transition probabilities. From the population of 
two areas of South West France 3,777 subjects were randomly selected from the 
electoral rolls. At the baseline, they were aged 65 years and over, living in 
the community and were interviewed 6 times over the 10-year follow-up. At age 
65, women lived longer than men (4.5 extra years), but shorter fully independent 
lives (-2.2 years). They also lived longer in each of the three degrees of 
disability (+4.2 years with moderate or severe disability). The higher educated 
lived longer (1.3 extra years at age 65), with the additional years free of 
disability. Regardless of age, gender and education, there appeared to be a 
1-year incompressible time spent with severe disability. To conclude, these are 
the first health expectancies based on the longitudinal data for France. Whilst 
most of the studies were based on cross-sectional data, this paper gives a more 
realistic indicator of the health and socio-economic inequalities in France in 
the 1990 s.

The marital status of older people has a number of socio-economic impacts. This 
paper presents key findings from a set of population projections for older 
people by age, sex and marital status for nine European countries. We use 
original data for national sources but we adjust the mortality and nuptiality 
rates for older ages by modelling existing cohort data. We then use robust 
assumptions for improvements in life expectancy at birth and we use these to 
constrain projection models. The projections refer to the period 2000-2030 and 
the following countries: Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, 
Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal and The United Kingdom. Similar trends will 
occur in all countries; married people will account for most of the increase 
among those aged 75 and older by 2030, followed by divorced men and women, who 
exhibit the highest proportional increase.

The organisational influence on benefits of preventive home visitation 
programmes for older people has escaped scientific evaluation. This study aims 
to investigate organisational structures and processes in relation to preventive 
home visits. As part of a randomised controlled trial investigating whether 
educational intervention towards municipality health care professionals could 
enhance active life expectancy, information of municipality leadership, home 
visit approach, strengths and limitations of communication within the 
organisation were obtained using individual and focus group interviews. 
Thirty-four municipalities in four counties participated. Data was 
systematically condensed using a phenomenological approach upon which general 
patterns were categorised into a theory-based formal typology of the preventive 
home visitation management in the municipalities. Three distinct strategies for 
preventive home visitation programmes were identified. Eighteen municipalities 
were categorised as "Framework Management", 15 as "Management by Rules" and one 
as "Project Management". Small municipality size was associated with the 
"Framework Management" type. "Management by Rules" municipalities had higher 
population densities and their overall expenses for older people were higher. 
"Framework Management" municipalities used more resources on preventive home 
visits, communicated better, experienced less staff changing and had higher 
social capital than "Management by Rules" municipalities. Municipality 
structures and management processes of preventive home visitation programmes 
varied considerably in 34 Danish municipalities, but the majority could be 
categorised as using either a "Framework Management" or a "Management by Rules" 
strategy. Each strategy is associated with particular advantages and 
disadvantages, which may explain differences in the overall benefit of the 
programme between municipalities.

BACKGROUND: Often in clinical practice, a spectrum of outcomes from surgery may 
be observed ranging from a quick and comfortable recovery to a recovery 
punctuated by persistent pain and decreased quality of life. While there has 
been a fast pace of advances made in the field of operative surgery, surgeons 
seldom pay attention to factors such as the psychological profile of a patient 
that can affect recovery from surgery.
OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of pre-operative psychological profile on 
post-operative recovery in terms of pain, return to work and quality of life.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries at 
Sagar Hospitals, Jayanagar, were recruited. All patients were assessed for 
psychological status using the screening for illness behaviour questionnaire 
(SIBQ) and pain catastrophizing scale (PCS). Following surgery, they were 
followed up for a period of 3 months-on post-operative day 1, post-operative day 
7, 1 month and 3 months from the date of surgery. Post-operative pain was 
measured using the visual analogue scale (Wong-Baker's), return to work was 
documented in days and quality of life was measured using the Short Form-36 
version 2 (SF-36v2) Health Survey. The Pearson's correlation coefficients were 
used to compare variables with continuous data and Chi-square and Fisher's tests 
were used to test categorical data for significance.
RESULTS: In a total of 98 patients recruited, 50 patients had a complete 
follow-up of 3 months. Significant correlations existed between the 
pre-operative markers and markers of recovery. The Chi-square test and Fisher's 
exact tests showed significant differences in the scores of pre-operative 
markers between the groups of patients who developed chronic pain and those who 
did not. Difference in scores with regard to quality of life was also noted.
CONCLUSION: Psychological status does play a role in post-operative recovery. 
This result opens up scope for counselling patients towards a healthy and 
comfortable recovery from surgery.
