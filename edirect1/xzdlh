COVID-19, a severe respiratory disease caused by a new type of coronavirus 
SARS-CoV-2, has been spreading all over the world. Patients infected with 
SARS-CoV-2 may have no pathogenic symptoms, i.e., presymptomatic patients and 
asymptomatic patients. Both patients could further spread the virus to other 
susceptible people, thereby making the control of COVID-19 difficult. The two 
major challenges for COVID-19 diagnosis at present are as follows: (1) patients 
could share similar symptoms with other respiratory infections, and (2) patients 
may not have any symptoms but could still spread the virus. Therefore, new 
biomarkers at different omics levels are required for the large-scale screening 
and diagnosis of COVID-19. Although some initial analyses could identify a group 
of candidate gene biomarkers for COVID-19, the previous work still could not 
identify biomarkers capable for clinical use in COVID-19, which requires 
disease-specific diagnosis compared with other multiple infectious diseases. As 
an extension of the previous study, optimized machine learning models were 
applied in the present study to identify some specific qualitative host 
biomarkers associated with COVID-19 infection on the basis of a publicly 
released transcriptomic dataset, which included healthy controls and patients 
with bacterial infection, influenza, COVID-19, and other kinds of coronavirus. 
This dataset was first analysed by Boruta, Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy 
feature selection methods one by one, resulting in a feature list. This list was 
fed into the incremental feature selection method, incorporating one of the 
classification algorithms to extract essential biomarkers and build efficient 
classifiers and classification rules. The capacity of these findings to 
distinguish COVID-19 with other similar respiratory infectious diseases at the 
transcriptomic level was also validated, which may improve the efficacy and 
accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Scotland has the shortest life expectancy in Western Europe, driven 
by high rates of cancer, suicides, alcohol-related causes and drug-related 
poisonings. These disparities cannot be explained solely by socioeconomic 
deprivation. Our aim was to investigate whether a syndemic in a 
socioeconomically deprived area of Glasgow might account for premature mortality 
among men.
METHODS: We analysed data from two cross-sectional population surveys: a 
national sample of 1916 British men and another of 765 men in Glasgow East. The 
survey included men aged 18-34, and was undertaken in 2011 to study correlates 
of violence. Questionnaires covered current physical health, psychiatric 
symptoms, substance misuse, and crime and violence. Syndemic components were 
identified using confirmatory factor analysis. Associations and synergistic 
interactions between these variables and health status were estimated using 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: An aggregation of multiple health conditions and health-related 
behaviours was found in Glasgow East. A syndemic model of joint effects, 
adducing a four-component latent variable (violence, substance dependence, 
psychiatric morbidity and a diathesis of biological/behavioural risk) showed 
synergy between components and explained persistent disparities in poor physical 
health/chronic health conditions. Effect modification was found between the 
general syndemic factor and contextual variables at individual and social 
environmental level according to location.
CONCLUSIONS: Syndemic effects from synergistic interactions were confirmed 
between psychiatric morbidity, substance misuse, violence, and 
biological/behavioural risk for physical health. A hypothetical model was 
developed to explain how the syndemic leads to potentially life-threatening 
risks to young men, both currently and as precursors of physical health 
conditions which may shorten their lives in the future.

BACKGROUND: With the growth, urbanisation, and changing consumption patterns of 
Tanzania's human population, new livestock production systems are emerging. 
Intensification of poultry production may result in opportunities and threats 
for food safety, such as improved awareness of biosecurity or increasing 
prevalence of foodborne pathogens including nontyphoidal Salmonella or 
Campylobacter spp. We conducted a semiquantitative analysis of poultry 
production systems in northern Tanzania, with emphasis on biosecurity, health 
management practices, and prevalence of foodborne pathogens, to gain insight 
into potential associations between intensification and food safety.
METHODS: Interviews were conducted with managers of 40 poultry farms, with equal 
representation of 4 production systems (extensive, semi-intensive, or intensive 
production with indigenous chickens, and broiler farming). Per farm, up to 10 
birds (total, 386) were tested for cloacal shedding of nontyphoidal Salmonella, 
with a subset of farms tested for Campylobacter. Data were analysed using 
univariate statistics, and results were discussed during feedback workshops with 
participating farmers and extension officers.
RESULTS: Clear differences existed between farm types with regard to 
implementation of biosecurity and health management practices and use of 
extension services. By contrast, prevalence of foodborne pathogens (6 of 40 
farms or 15% for nontyphoidal Salmonella and 13 of 26 farms or 50% for 
Campylobacter spp.) was not farm-type specific, indicating that it is driven by 
other factors. Across farming systems, knowledge and awareness of the presence 
of antimicrobials in poultry feed and the need to abide by post-treatment 
withdrawal times were limited, as was access to impartial professional advice 
regarding treatment.
CONCLUSION: Different control measures may be needed to protect poultry health 
compared to public health, and improvements in information provision may be 
needed for both.

BACKGROUND: Caregiver perceived autonomy support by the oncologist is important 
for caregiver well-being and may be affected by the patient's survival. We 
determined the association of caregiver-oncologist discordance in patient's life 
expectancy estimates with perceived autonomy support over time and whether the 
association differed by patient survival status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used data from a geriatric assessment 
cluster-randomized trial (URCC 13070) that recruited patients aged at least 
70 years with incurable cancer considering or receiving treatment, their 
caregivers, and their oncologists. At baseline, caregivers and oncologists were 
asked to estimate patient's life expectancy (0-6 months, 7-12 months, 1-2 years, 
2-5 years, and >5 years; any difference in response was considered discordant). 
At 4-6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, caregivers completed the Health Care 
Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ), which measured perceived autonomy support by the 
oncologist. Generalized estimating equation modeling was conducted to assess the 
association of baseline caregiver-oncologist discordance with longitudinal HCCQ 
scores, stratified by patient 6-month survival status.
RESULTS: Discordant life expectancy estimates were present in 72.0% of dyads. In 
multivariate analyses, caregiver-oncologist discordance in patient's life 
expectancy estimates was associated with higher caregiver HCCQ scores. In 
stratified analysis, caregiver-oncologist discordance was associated with lower 
caregiver HCCQ scores (β = -3.46; 95% CI, -4.64 to -2.29) among patients who 
died within 6 months but with higher caregiver HCCQ scores (β = 1.33; 95% CI, 
0.63-2.04) among patients who survived beyond 6 months.
CONCLUSION: Interventions aimed at mitigating discordance need to consider its 
association with caregiver perceived autonomy support and patient's survival in 
order to better inform caregiver expectations.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Among patients who died within the first 6 months, 
caregivers who estimated a different length of life for the patient compared 
with oncologists were more likely to report lower support from the oncologist, 
whereas the opposite relationship was seen within patients who survived beyond 
the first 6 months. When designing interventions to improve caregiver 
understanding of the patient's prognosis, its relationship with 
caregiver-perceived support and patient's survival needs to be considered.

The Italian Cancer Registry Association has estimated that for the five-year 
period 2016-2020, in line with the previous five years, approximately 7000 
neoplasms have been diagnosed among children and 4000 among adolescents. 
Leukemias, brain tumors and lymphomas together account for more than two-thirds 
of all pediatric cancers. Fortunately, the five-years survival rate has 
progressively improved reaching 80% thanks to the continuing improvement of 
therapeutic protocols but most of these cancer survivors will have at least one 
chronic health condition by 40 years of age. Long-term complications concern 
various organs and systems and have a multifactorial etiopathogenesis. Obesity, 
diabetes, and metabolic syndrome represent chronic diseases that affect life 
expectancy. Cardiovascular risk partly linked to therapies and genetic 
susceptibility and partly linked to the presence of obesity, diabetes and 
metabolic syndrome predispose childhood cancer survivors to heart failure, 
coronary artery disease, valvular disease, arrhythmia. Hence the cardio- 
metabolic risk of childhood cancer survivors can have a significant impact on 
their lives, families, and on society at-large. Therefore, it is very important 
to know the risk factors that predispose to the development of cardio-metabolic 
pathologies in childhood cancer survivors, the possible primary and secondary 
prevention strategies, the methods of surveillance and the therapeutic 
approaches.

Use of Telemedicine in Depression Care by Physicians: Scoping Review.

Echelard JF(1).

BACKGROUND: Depression is a common disorder, and it creates burdens on people's 
mental and physical health as well as societal costs. Although traditional 
in-person consultations are the usual mode of caring for patients with 
depression, telemedicine may be well suited to psychiatric assessment and 
management. Telepsychiatry can be defined as the use of information and 
communication technologies such as videoconferencing and telephone calls for the 
care of psychopathologies.
OBJECTIVE: This review aims to evaluate the extent and nature of the existing 
literature on the use of telemedicine for the care of depression by physicians. 
This review also aims to examine the effects and perceptions regarding this 
virtual care and determine how it compares to traditional in-person care.
METHODS: The Arksey and O'Malley framework and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping 
Reviews) guidelines were followed. Relevant articles were identified through a 
search of three databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and 
PsycArticles) on October 11, 2020. The search terms were "(virtual OR 
telemedicine OR teleconsultation* OR telehealth OR phone* OR webcam* OR 
telepsychiatry) AND (depress*)". Eligibility criteria were applied to select 
studies about the use of telemedicine for the care of patients with depression 
specifically by physicians. An Excel file (Microsoft Corporation) was used to 
chart data from all included articles.
RESULTS: The search resulted in the identification of 28 articles, and all 13 
nonreview studies were analyzed in detail. Most nonreview studies were conducted 
in the United States during the last decade. Most telemedicine programs were led 
by psychiatrists, and the average study population size was 135. In all 
applicable studies, telepsychiatry tended to perform at least as well as 
in-person care regarding improvement in depression severity, patient 
satisfaction, quality of life, functioning, cost-effectiveness, and most other 
perceptions and variables. Cultural sensitivity and collaborative care were part 
of the design of some telemedicine programs.
CONCLUSIONS: Additional randomized, high-quality studies are recommended to 
evaluate various outcomes of the use of telemedicine for depression care, 
including depression variables, perceptions, health care outcomes and other 
outcomes. Studies should be conducted in various clinical contexts, including 
primary care. Telepsychiatry is a promising modality of care for patients 
suffering from depression.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Tables reporting life expectancies by common risk factors are 
available for individuals with type 2 diabetes; however, there is currently no 
published equivalent for individuals with type 1 diabetes. We aimed to develop a 
life expectancy table using a recently published simulation model for 
individuals with type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: The simulation model was developed using data from a real-world 
population of patients with type 1 diabetes selected from the Swedish National 
Diabetes Register. The following six important risk factors were included in the 
life table: sex; age; current smoking status; BMI; eGFR; and HbA1c. For each of 
1024 cells in the life expectancy table, a synthetic cohort containing 1000 
individuals was created, with other risk factors assigned values representative 
of the real-world population. The simulations were executed for all synthetic 
cohorts and life expectancy for each cell was calculated as mean survival time 
of the individuals in the respective cohort.
RESULTS: There was a substantial variation in life expectancy across patients 
with different risk factor levels. Life expectancy of 20-year-old men varied 
from 29.3 years to 50.6 years, constituting a gap of 21.3 years between those 
with worst and best risk factor levels. In 20-year-old women, this gap was 
18.9 years (life expectancy range 35.0-53.9 years). The variation in life 
expectancy was a function of the combination of risk factor values, with HbA1c 
and eGFR consistently showing a negative and positive correlation, respectively, 
with life expectancy at any level combination of other risk factors. Individuals 
with the lowest level (20 kg/m2) and highest level of BMI (35 kg/m2) had a lower 
life expectancy compared with those with a BMI of 25 kg/m2. Non-smokers and 
women had a higher life expectancy than smokers and men, respectively, with the 
difference in life expectancy ranging from 0.4 years to 2.7 years between 
non-smokers and smokers, and from 1.9 years to 5.9 years between women and men, 
depending on levels of other risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The life expectancy table generated in this study 
shows a substantial variation in life expectancy across individuals with 
different modifiable risk factors. The table allows for rapid communications of 
risk in an easily understood format between healthcare professionals, health 
economists, researchers, policy makers and patients. Particularly, it supports 
clinicians in their discussion with patients about the benefits of improving 
risk factors.

The differences in morbidity and mortality patterns and life expectancy between 
the sexes are well established in different infectious and parasitic conditions, 
such as in leishmaniases, in which biological, genetic, sexual and hormonal 
variations can modulate the immune response indicating greater infectivity, 
prevalence and clinical severity in men. In this regard, in seeking the 
understanding of factors related to protection and susceptibility to infection, 
this review aimed to discuss the influence of sex hormones on the immune 
response to leishmaniases. In the literature, sex hormone variations promote 
differences in the innate, humoral and cell-mediated immune response, leading to 
greater susceptibility, mortality and complications in males. Epidemiological 
estimates confirm these results, showing a predominance of the disease, in its 
different clinical forms, in men and suggesting that sexual variations influence 
immunomodulatory mechanisms since the prevalence of cases comprises the 
post-puberty and adulthood period. In this perspective, the action of sex 
hormones has been investigated in different clinical models, highlighting the 
potential of testosterone in immunosuppression, given its association with 
greater susceptibility and poor control of parasite load and the induction of 
cell apoptosis and attenuation of pro-inflammatory signalling pathways. 
Therefore, hormonal variations influence the immune response among males and 
females against leishmaniases, in which androgens may present immunosuppressive 
potential, while steroids present immunomodulatory characteristics.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of 
erenumab in a real-world migraine population, looking for putative predictors of 
responsiveness.
BACKGROUND: Erenumab proved to be effective, safe, and well tolerated in the 
prevention of episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM) in long-term 
extension studies of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with no 
more than two (EM) or three (CM) prior preventive treatment failures.
METHODS: A 48-week, multicenter, longitudinal cohort real-life study was 
conducted at 15 headache centers across eight Italian regions between December 
20, 2018 and July 31, 2020. We considered all consecutive patients with 
high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM) or CM aged 18-65 years. Each patient was 
treated with erenumab 70 mg, administered monthly. The dose was switched to 
140 mg in nonresponders and in responders who had become nonresponders for at 
least 4 weeks. Change in monthly migraine days (MMDs) or monthly headache days 
(MHDs) at Weeks 45-48 compared with baseline was the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Secondary endpoints encompassed variation in monthly analgesic intake, 
achievement of a ≥50%, ≥75%, or 100% reduction in migraine or headache days, and 
any change in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Headache Impact Test-6 scores 
(HIT-6) during the same time interval.
RESULTS: A total of 242 patients with migraine received at least one dose of 
erenumab 70 mg and were considered for safety analysis, whereas 221 received a 
monthly erenumab dose for ≥48 weeks and were included in the effectiveness and 
safety analysis set. All patients had previously been treated unsuccessfully 
with ≥3 migraine-preventive medication classes. From baseline to Weeks 45-48, 
erenumab treatment reduced MMD by 4.3 ± 5.3 (mean ± SD) in patients with HFEM, 
and MHD by 12.8 ± 8.9 (mean ± SD) in subjects with CM. VAS and HIT-6 scores were 
decreased by 1.8 ± 1.9 (mean ± SD) and 12.3 ± 11 (mean ± SD) in HFEM, and by 
3.0 ± 2.2 (mean ± SD) and 13.1 ± 11.2 (mean ± SD) in CM. Median monthly 
analgesic intake passed from 11.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 10.0-13.0) to 5 
(IQR 2.0-8.0) in HFEM and from 20.0 (IQR 15.0-30.0) to 6.0 (IQR 3.8-10.0) in CM. 
The ≥50% responders were 56.1% (32/57) in HFEM and 75.6% (124/164) in CM; ≥75% 
responders were 31.6% (18/57) and 44.5% (73/164); and 100% responders were 8.8% 
(5/57) and 1.2% (2/164), respectively. At Week 48, 83.6% (137/164) of patients 
with CM had reverted to EM. Erenumab was safe and well tolerated. Responsiveness 
to erenumab was positively associated with cutaneous allodynia (OR: 5.44, 95% 
CI: 1.52-19.41; p = 0.009) in HFEM. In patients with CM, ≥50% responsiveness was 
positively associated with male sex (OR: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.03-8.7; p = 0.044) and 
baseline migraine frequency (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05-1.20; p = 0.001) and 
negatively associated with psychiatric comorbidities (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 
0.15-0.87; p = 0.023) and prior treatment failures (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.64-0.92; 
p = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term (48-week) erenumab treatment provides sustained 
effectiveness, safety, and tolerability in real-life patients with HFEM or CM 
with ≥3 prior preventive treatment failures. The dose of 140 mg was required in 
most patients along the study and should be taken into consideration as the 
starting dose. Allodynia (in HFEM), male sex, and baseline migraine frequency 
(in CM) might represent positive responsiveness predictors. Conversely, 
psychiatric comorbidities and multiple prior preventive treatment failures could 
be negative predictors in patients with CM.

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro) from 
SARS-CoV-2 play crucial roles in the viral life cycle and are considered the 
most promising targets for drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, 
FDA-approved drugs were screened to identify the probable anti-RdRp and 3CLpro 
inhibitors by molecular docking approach. The number of ligands selected from 
the PubChem database of NCBI for screening was 1760. Ligands were energy 
minimized using Open Babel. The RdRp and 3CLpro protein sequences were retrieved 
from the NCBI database. For Homology Modeling predictions, we used the Swiss 
model server. Their structure was then energetically minimized using SPDB viewer 
software and visualized in the CHIMERA UCSF software. Molecular dockings were 
performed using AutoDock Vina, and candidate drugs were selected based on 
binding affinity (∆G). Hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between 
ligands and proteins were visualized using Ligplot and the Discovery Studio 
Visualizer v3.0 software. Our results showed 58 drugs against RdRp, which had 
binding energy of - 8.5 or less, and 69 drugs to inhibit the 3CLpro enzyme with 
a binding energy of - 8.1 or less. Six drugs based on binding energy and number 
of hydrogen bonds were chosen for the next step of molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations to investigate drug-protein interactions (including Nilotinib, 
Imatinib and dihydroergotamine for 3clpro and Lapatinib, Dexasone and 
Relategravir for RdRp). Except for Lapatinib, other drugs-complexes were stable 
during MD simulation. Raltegravir, an anti-HIV drug, was observed to be the best 
compound against RdRp based on docking binding energy (-9.5 kcal/mole) and MD 
results. According to the MD results and binding energy, dihydroergotamine is a 
suitable candidate for 3clpro inhibition (-9.6 kcal/mol). These drugs were 
classified into several categories, including antiviral, antibacterial, 
anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, cardiovascular, anticoagulant, BPH and 
impotence, antipsychotic, antimigraine, anticancer, and so on. The common 
prescription-indications for some of these medication categories appeared 
somewhat in line with manifestations of COVID-19. We hope that they can be 
beneficial for patients with certain specific symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
but they can also probably inhibit viral enzymes. We recommend further 
experimental evaluations in vitro and in vivo on these FDA-approved drugs to 
assess their potential antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2.

BACKGROUND: Clinical studies indicate that strength-balance training for active 
fall prevention can prevent fractures in older people. The present modelling 
study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of fall prevention exercise (FPE) 
provided to independently living older people compared to no intervention in 
Germany.
METHOD: We designed a Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a 
group-based FPE-program provided to independently living people ≥75 years from 
the perspective of the German statutory health insurance (SHI). Input data was 
obtained from public databases, clinical trials and official statistics. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was presented as costs per avoided 
hip fracture. Additionally, we performed deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses and, estimated monetary consequences for the SHI in a 
budget impact analysis (BIA).
RESULTS: For women, the costs per hip fracture avoided amounted to €52,864 (men: 
€169,805). Results of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
confirmed the robustness of the results. According to the BIA, for the 
reimbursement of FPE additional costs of €3.0 million (women) and €7.8 million 
(men) are expected for the SHI.
CONCLUSIONS: Group-based FPE appears to be no cost-effective option to prevent 
fall-related hip fractures in independently living elderly. To allow a more 
comprehensive statement on the cost effectiveness of FPE fracture types other 
than hip should be increasingly evaluated in clinical trials.

It has long been apparent that gross disparities exist in health care in the 
United States, and, indeed, other nations with fully developed economies. All 
kinds of markers point to these inequities, with measures such as overall life 
expectancy, hospitalization rates, premature mortality, adverse outcomes 
associated with medical and surgical treatment, infant mortality, and the impact 
of many significant disease types higher and more impactful among minority 
groups and those of the most modest economic means. This is not new. Are there 
pointers to what might underpin the disparities in outcomes among the different 
minority groups?

INTRODUCTION: Hematologic abnormalities are frequent among persons living with 
HIV (PLWH). The bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and biopsy (BMB) are commonly 
performed in the diagnostic approach of patients with unexplained cytopenias. 
Changes in antiretrovirals, supportive therapy and increased life expectancy 
have modified the distribution and etiology of cytopenias, questioning their 
use. Our aim was to analyze the diagnostic yield of BMA, BMB and marrow cultures 
for the evaluation of cytopenias in PLWH.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort of ≥ 18-year-old PLWH undergoing bone 
marrow assessment (MA) for the evaluation of cytopenias between January 2002 and 
December 2015.
RESULTS: A total of 236 cytopenic events were analyzed, 47.9% being PLWH who had 
a longstanding diagnosis (≥ 1 year). Adherence to antiretrovirals was 63.5%. 
Anemia was seen in 91.9% and pancytopenia in 39%. Common presentations included 
fever (52.1%), weight loss (42.8%) and adenopathies (28.8%). Median days from 
detection to MA was 5 (0 - 63 days). Most common etiologies were non-HIV 
infectious diseases (31.4%) and benign/malignant hematologic diseases (26.3%). 
The diagnostic yield was 16.1% for BMA, 20.3% for BMB, 30.5% for both and 35.6% 
when cultures were added. Patients most likely to have conclusive MA were those 
with moderate/severe thrombocytopenia (p = 0.007). Fever, splenomegaly, and low 
CD4+ counts were associated with infectious etiologies, while hematologic 
diagnoses were related to the presence of adenopathies.
CONCLUSION: As a minimally invasive intervention, the MA has a high yield for 
identifying the etiology of cytopenic events in PLWH, being conclusive in one in 
three patients. Early performance could lead to prompt diagnosis and timely 
therapy initiation.

The translation of messenger RNA sequences into polypeptide sequences according 
to the genetic code is central to life. How this process, which relies on the 
ribosomal machinery, arose from much simpler precursors is unclear. Here, we 
demonstrate that single nucleotides charged with an amino acid couple with amino 
acids linked to the 5'-terminus of an RNA primer in reactions directed by the 
nucleotides of an RNA template in dilute aqueous solution at 0 °C. When a 
mixture of U-Val, A-Gly and G-Leu competed for coupling to Gly-RNA, base pairing 
dictated which dipeptide sequence formed preferentially. The resulting doubly 
anchored dipeptides can retain their link to the primer for further extension or 
can be fully released under mild acidic conditions. These results show that a 
single-nucleotide-based form of translation exists that requires no more than 
oligoribonucleotides and anchored amino acids.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease affecting a 
large proportion of older adults. Exposure to pesticides like rotenone is a 
leading cause for PD. To reduce disease progression and prolong life expectancy, 
it is important to target disease mechanisms that contribute to dopaminergic 
neuronal atrophy, including mitochondrial dysfunction. Achieving targeted 
mitochondrial delivery is difficult for many therapeutics by themselves, 
necessitating higher therapeutic doses that could lead to toxicity. To minimize 
this adverse effect, targeted nano-carriers such as polyanhydride nanoparticles 
(NPs) can protect therapeutics from degradation and provide sustained release, 
enabling fewer administrations and lower therapeutic dose. This work expands 
upon the use of the polyanhydride NP platform for targeted drug delivery by 
functionalizing the polymer with a derivative of triphenylphosphonium called 
(3-carboxypropyl) triphenylphosphonium (CPTP) using a novel method that enables 
longer CPTP persistence on the NPs. The extent to which neurons internalized 
both nonfunctionalized and functionalized NPs was tested. Next, the efficacy of 
these nanoformulations in treating rotenone-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in 
the same cell line was evaluated using a novel neuroprotective drug, 
mito-metformin. CPTP functionalization significantly improved NP internalization 
by neuronal cells. This was correlated with significant protection by 
CPTP-functionalized, mito-metformin encapsulated NPs against rotenone-induced 
mitochondrial dysfunction. However, nonfunctionalized, mito-metformin 
encapsulated NPs and soluble mito-metformin administered at the same dose did 
not significantly protect cells from rotenone-induced toxicity. These results 
indicate that the targeted NP platform can provide enhanced dose-sparing and 
potentially reduce the occurrence of systemic side-effects for PD therapeutics.

Type III endoleak is an uncommon but life-threatening complication of 
endovascular aortic repair, and such leaks at certain sites can be challenging 
to treat through an endovascular route. A 77-year-old man presented with severe 
abdominal pain and was found to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm with contained 
rupture due to an unfavorably cited type IIIb endoleak. He was successfully 
treated with an endovascular approach using bilateral iliac limb proximal 
extension combined with embolization of endoleak sac, endoleak site and the 
feeding recess, preserving flow through both the iliac limbs obviating the need 
for an additional femorofemoral bypass. The patient improved clinically and had 
a favorable long-term follow-up profile.

BACKGROUND: Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is introduced as a predictor of the 
degree of ventricular dysfunction and is associated with mortality. There are 
limited reports on the relationship of BNP with long-term all-cause death (AD) 
and cardiovascular or limb events in peripheral artery disease (PAD). We 
examined the relationship between BNP level and these events in PAD patients.
METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study in 938 PAD patients. The 
patients were divided into four groups based on BNP levels with median 
(interquartile range): Q1: ≤20.4; Q2: 20.5-42.8; Q3: 42.9-103.4; and Q4: ≥103.5 
pg/mL. The endpoints were AD, freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE), and MACE plus limb events (MALE).
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 65 months. There were 383 deaths (40.8%) 
during follow-up period. AD depended on BNP levels (P<0.01), with 5-year freedom 
from AD rates of Q1: 94%, Q2: 84%, Q3: 69%, and Q4: 55%. The Kaplan-Meier 
estimates of freedom from AD, MACE, and MALE had significant differences among 
Q1- Q4 groups (P<0.001). In multiple regression analysis, BNP had significant 
negative correlations with eGFR, serum albumin, and BMI and positive 
correlations with diabetes (P<0.05). In Cox multivariate analysis, higher BNP, 
age, CRP, D-dimer, lower BMI, ABI, serum albumin, and eGFR were related to AD; 
and higher BNP, age, lower ABI, serum albumin, CAD, and DM were related to MACE 
and MALE (P<0.05). Statins improved AD, MACE, and MALE (P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: BNP was a promising biomarker for AD, MACE, and MALE in patients 
with PAD.
