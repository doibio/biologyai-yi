PURPOSE: Digital fertility awareness-based contraception offers an alternative 
choice for women who do not wish to use hormonal or invasive methods. The aim of 
this study was to investigate the key demographics of current users of the 
Natural Cycles app and assess the contraceptive outcomes of women preventing 
pregnancy in a UK cohort of women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a real world observational prospective 
observational study. The typical-use effectiveness of the method was calculated 
using both 13-cycle cumulative probability of pregnancy (life table analysis) 
and Pearl Index for the entire study cohort. Perfect-use PI was calculated using 
data from cycles where sexual intercourse during the fertile window was marked 
as protected and no unprotected sex was recorded on fertile days.
RESULTS: 12,247 women were included in the study and contributed an average of 
9.9 months of data for a total of 10,066 woman years of exposure. The mean age 
of the cohort was 30, mean BMI 23.4, the majority were in a stable relationship 
(83.2%) and had a university degree or higher (83%). The one year typical use, 
PI was 6.1 (95% CI: 5.6, 6.6) and with perfect-use was 2.0 (95% CI: 1.3, 2.8). 
13 cycle pregnancy probability was 7.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study which describes the use of a digital 
contraceptive by women in the UK. It describes the demographics of users and how 
they correlate with the apps effectiveness at preventing pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: The Ring Study, a phase 3 trial in 1959 sexually active women 
(randomised 2:1), showed a favourable safety profile and a 31% HIV-1 infection 
risk reduction for a vaginal ring containing 25 mg of dapivirine, compared with 
a placebo ring. We report here the DREAM study, which aimed to evaluate safety, 
adherence, and HIV-1 incidence in those using the dapivirine vaginal ring (DVR) 
in open-label use.
METHODS: The DREAM study is an open-label extension of The Ring Study, done at 
five research centres in South Africa and one research centre in Uganda. Former 
participants from The Ring Study, who remained HIV-negative and who did not 
discontinue the study due to an adverse event or safety concern that was 
considered to be related to the investigational product, were eligible. Women 
who were pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding at screening 
for DREAM were excluded. All participants received the DVR for insertion at the 
enrolment visit. Participants attended a 1-month follow-up visit and could 
either proceed with visits once every 3 months or attend monthly visits up to 
month 3 and then continue with visits once every 3 months. At each visit, HIV 
testing and safety evaluations were done, and residual dapivirine measured in 
used rings (approximately 4 mg is released from the DVR over 28 days of 
consistent use). HIV-1 incidence was compared descriptively with the simulated 
incidence rate obtained from bootstrap sampling of participants in the placebo 
group of The Ring Study, matched for research centre, age, and presence of 
sexually transmitted infections at enrolment. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02862171.
FINDINGS: Between July 12, 2016, and Jan 11, 2019, 1034 former participants from 
The Ring Study were screened, 941 were enrolled and 848 completed the trial. 616 
(65·5%) of 941 participants reported treatment-emergent adverse events. Of 
these, six (0·6%) had events considered to be treatment-related. No 
treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. Measurements of monthly 
ring residual amounts in participants enrolled in both trials showed 
consistently lower mean values in DREAM than in The Ring Study. Arithmetic mean 
ring residual amounts of participants in The Ring Study DVR group who enrolled 
in DREAM were 0·25 mg lower (95% CI 0·03-0·47; p=0·027) than the mean ring 
residual amounts of these participants in The Ring Study. 18 (1·9%) HIV-1 
infections were confirmed during DVR use, resulting in an incidence of 1·8 (95% 
CI 1·1-2·6) per 100 person-years, 62% lower than the simulated placebo rate.
INTERPRETATION: Although efficacy estimation is limited by the absence of a 
placebo group, the observed low HIV-1 incidence and improved adherence observed 
in DREAM support the hypothesis that increased efficacy due to improved 
adherence occurs when women know the demonstrated safety and efficacy of the 
DVR. The feasibility of a visit schedule of once every 3 months was shown, 
indicating that the DVR can be used in a real-world situation in usual clinical 
practice.

The role of visible light on longevity is incompletely understood. Here we show 
the effect of visible light in Drosophila melanogaster is wavelength specific. 
Life span was significantly extended by green light, whereas blue light reduced 
longevity dramatically, and minor impact was observed with red light. While 
oxidative stress, heat stress, or caloric restriction does not contribute to the 
beneficial effect of green light, our study found that the life span extension 
effect of green light might be mediated by microbiota or photosensitive 
micronutrients in food medium. In conclusion, we report that green light can 
extend longevity and present the potential of light as a noninvasive therapy for 
aging-related diseases.

INTRODUCTION: HIV-1 subtypes have been associated with less favourable clinical 
profiles, differences in disease progression and higher risk of neurocognitive 
deficit. In this study we aimed to analyse the long term survival disparities 
between patients infected with the most common HIV-1 variants observed in 
Poland.
METHODS: For the study data from 518 Caucasian non-immigrant patients of Polish 
origin infected with divergent HIV subtypes and variants [subtype A (n = 35, 
6.8%), subtype B (n = 386, 74.5%), subtype C (n = 13, 2.5%), subtype D (n = 58, 
11.19%) or other non-A,B,C,D (n = 26, 5.01%)variants] were analysed. Subtyping 
was performed using the partial pol (reverse transcriptase and protease) 
sequencing. HIV variant was coupled with clinical, virologic and survival data 
censored at 20 years of observation. Overall survival and on antiretroviral 
treatment survival was analysed using Kaplan-Meyer as well as unadjusted and 
multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Significantly higher mortality was observed among subtype D (28.8%) 
infected subjects compared to subtype B (11.7%, p = 0.0004). Increased risk of 
death among subtype D cases remained significant when cART treated individuals 
were analysed, with on-treatment mortality of 26.9% for subtype D (p = 0.006) 
compared to 10.73% in subtype B infected cases. Kaplan-Meyer survival estimates 
differed significantly across all investigated HIV-1 variant groups when overall 
20 year mortality was analysed (log rank p = 0.029), being non-significant for 
the cART treated group. In multivariate model of overall 20 year survival, 
adjusted for age at diagnosis, gender, HCV and AIDS status, lymphocyte CD4 
count, transmission route and HIV viral load, only age and subtype D were 
independently associated with higher likelihood of death [HR: 1.08 (95%CI: 
1.03-1.14, p = 0.002) and HR: 7.91 (95%CI:2.33-26.86), p < 0.001, respectively]. 
In the on-treatment (cART) multivariate model of 20 year survival adjusted for 
the same parameters only subtype D remained as the independent factor associated 
with higher mortality risk [HR: 4.24 (95%CI:1.31-13.7), p = 0.02].
CONCLUSIONS: Subtype D has an independent deleterious effect of survival, even 
in the setting of antiretroviral treatment. Observed effect indicated higher 
clinical vigilance for patients infected with this subtype even after long time 
of stable antiretroviral treatment.

OBJECTIVES: India is going through an epidemiologic and demographic transition 
made possible by increased investment in health sector and sustained 
development. The country has more than 2 million people infected with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Information on cost-effectiveness of competing 
interventions is a useful contributor to decisions concerning allocation and 
prioritization of healthcare resources. This paper aims to study the cost, 
health outcomes as measured by disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and 
cost-effectiveness per DALY averted of prophylaxis for tuberculosis, diarrhea, 
and mouth ulcers in HIV-infected adults.
METHODS: Data were analyzed on 375 HIV-infected persons enrolled at the ART 
Centre in New Delhi between April 2004 and April 2006. Using estimates of the 
age of onset of HIV infection, cost of medicines, and antiretroviral regimen 
followed, we used standard methods to calculate the cost per DALY as a measure 
of cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the 
robustness of cost-effectiveness results by making reasonable changes in 
underlying assumptions.
RESULTS: The results revealed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 
tuberculosis prophylaxis was ₹4821.48 ($78.86) per DALY averted compared with no 
prophylaxis, followed by diarrhea (₹8299.08, $135.74) and mouth ulcers 
(₹20 058.14, $328.07).
CONCLUSIONS: The estimates are less than the per capita gross domestic product 
of India, indicating that the current treatments are highly cost-effective. This 
will help policymakers understand the best opportunities to improve population 
health and help researchers to develop more standardized methods in the area, 
thus improving quality and comparability across cost per DALY studies.

The effect of nanochitosan coating containing pomegranate peel extract (PPE) at 
concentrations 0.5, 0.75 and 1% (w/v) on postharvest quality of apricot fruit 
was studied during storage at 4 °C for 30 days. Nanoemulsions showed significant 
increase in droplet diameter 275-400 nm, decrease in zeta potential -30-23 mV 
and viscosity 90-76 mPas-1 with increase in PPE concentration. Results confirmed 
that apricot fruit treated with chitosan and 1% PPE showed significantly reduced 
decay percentage, weight loss, effectively retained DPPH radical scavenging 
activity, ascorbic acid, kept titratable acidity and firmness at high level than 
untreated fruit. Color attributes showed decrease in L*, a* values and 
significant increase in b* value. Nanochitosan containing 1% PPE significantly 
inhibited total psychrophilic bacterial count, yeast and mold count during 
storage. Our results suggest that chitosan coatings enriched with pomegranate 
peel extract has the potential to preserve the quality and extend shelf life of 
apricot.

BACKGROUND: In patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), the 
preference-based, health-related quality of life in terms of utility has not 
been extensively studied.
OBJECTIVE: To address this point, we compared the performance of different 
instruments assessing utility in patients with OSAS undergoing continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 208 patients with OSAS (28 women, mean ± SE age 
54.4 ± 0.7 years, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 51.9 ± 1.8/h, Epworth sleepiness 
score 13.4 ± 0.2) participating in a randomized trial of different CPAP 
modalities over 2 years were analyzed. Evaluations included sleep studies, 
Epworth sleepiness scale, and several utility instruments that measure 
subjective health preference on a scale ranging from 1 (most preferred and 
perfect health) to 0 (least preferred and very poor health).
RESULTS: After 2 years of CPAP therapy, the mean ± SE AHI was 6.7 ± 1.5/h and 
Epworth score 7.9 ± 0.4, both p < 0.001 versus baseline. Baseline utilities and 
changes (95% confidence interval) after 2 years of CPAP therapy were EuroQol 
5-dimensions 0.79 ± 0.01, 0.02 (0.00-0.05, p = 0.064); short-form 6-dimension 
medical outcome questionnaire 0.72 ± 0.01, 0.06 (0.04-0.08, p < 0.001); 
Euro-thermometer visual analog scale 0.70 ± 0.01, 0.09 (0.07-0.12, p < 0.001); 
time trade-off 0.82 ± 0.01, 0.03 (0.01-0.06, p = 0.002); and standard gamble 
0.82 ± 0.01, -0.01 (-0.03 to 0.02, p = 0.712).
CONCLUSION: The short-form 6-dimensions questionnaire, the Euro-thermometer, and 
the time trade-off instruments reflected the major clinical improvements in 
OSAS, while the EuroQoL 5-dimensions and standard gamble tests were not 
sensitive to CPAP effects. These results indicate that the evaluation of utility 
of a treatment for OSAS depends critically on the instrument used, which is 
important from an individual and societal perspective.

Previous research showed that an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the anterior 
side of the shank can accurately measure the Shank-to-Vertical Angle (SVA), 
which is a clinically-used parameter to guide tuning of ankle-foot orthoses 
(AFOs). However, in this context it is specifically important that differences 
in the SVA are detected during the tuning process, i.e., when adjusting heel 
height. This study investigated the validity of the SVA as measured by an IMU 
and its responsiveness to changes in AFO-footwear combination (AFO-FC) heel 
height in persons with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Additionally, the 
effect of heel height on knee flexion-extension angle and internal moment was 
evaluated. Twelve persons with an iSCI walked with their own AFO-FC in three 
different conditions: (1) without a heel wedge (refHH), (2) with 5 mm heel wedge 
(lowHH) and (3) with 10 mm heel wedge (highHH). Walking was recorded by a single 
IMU on the anterior side of the shank and a 3D gait analysis (3DGA) 
simultaneously. To estimate validity, a paired t-test and intraclass correlation 
coefficient (ICC) between the SVAIMU and SVA3DGA were calculated for the refHH. 
A repeated measures ANOVA was performed to evaluate the differences between the 
heel heights. A good validity with a mean difference smaller than 1 and an ICC 
above 0.9 was found for the SVA during midstance phase and at midstance. 
Significant differences between the heel heights were found for changes in 
SVAIMU (p = 0.036) and knee moment (p = 0.020) during the midstance phase and in 
SVAIMU (p = 0.042) and SVA3DGA (p = 0.006) at midstance. Post-hoc analysis 
revealed a significant difference between the ref and high heel height condition 
for the SVAIMU (p = 0.005) and knee moment (p = 0.006) during the midstance 
phase and for the SVAIMU (p = 0.010) and SVA3DGA (p = 0.006) at the instant of 
midstance. The SVA measured with an IMU is valid and responsive to changing heel 
heights and equivalent to the gold standard 3DGA. The knee joint angle and knee 
joint moment showed concomitant changes compared to SVA as a result of changing 
heel height.

We present a case demonstrating the performance of different radiographical 
imaging modalities in the diagnostic work-up of a patient with neurofibromatosis 
type 1 (NF1) and plexiform neurofibroma (PN). The newborn boy showed an 
expansive-infiltrative cervical and facial mass presented with macrocrania, 
craniofacial disfigurement, exophthalmos and glaucoma. A computer tomography 
(CT) and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. The CT was 
fundamental to evaluate the bone dysmorphisms and the MRI was crucial to 
estimate the mass extension. The biopsy of the lesion confirmed the suspicion of 
PN, thus allowing the diagnosis of NF1. PN is a variant of neurofibromas, a 
peripheral nerves sheath tumor typically associated with NF1. Even through 
currently available improved detection techniques, NF1 diagnosis at birth 
remains a challenge due to a lack of pathognomonic signs; therefore congenital 
PN are recognized in 20% of cases. This case highlights the importance of using 
different radiological methods both for the correct diagnosis and the follow-up 
of the patient with PN. Thanks to MRI evaluation, it was possible to identify 
earlier the progressive increasing size of the PN and the possible life 
threatening evolution in order to perform a tracheostomy to avoid airways 
compression.

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is an innovative modality 
based on high precision planning and delivery. Cancer with bone metastases and 
oligometastases are associated with an intermediate or good prognosis. We assume 
that prolonged survival rates would be achieved if both the primary tumor and 
metastases are controlled by local treatment. Our purpose is to demonstrate, via 
a multicenter randomized phase III trial, that local treatment of metastatic 
sites with curative intent with SBRT associated of systemic standard of care 
treatment would improve the progression-free survival in patients with solid 
tumor (breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer) with up to 3 bone-only 
metastases compared to patients who received systemic standard of care treatment 
alone.
METHODS: This is an open-labeled randomized superiority multicenter phase III 
trial. Patients with up to 3 bone-only metastases will be randomized in a 1:1 
ratio.between Arm A (Experimental group): Standard care of treatment & SBRT to 
all bone metastases, and Arm B (Control group): standard care of treatment. For 
patients receiving SBRT, radiotherapy dose and fractionation depends on the site 
of the bone metastasis and the proximity to critical normal structures. This 
study aims to accrue a total of 196 patients within 4 years. The primary 
endpoint is progression-free survival at 1 year, and secondary endpoints include 
Bone progression-free survival; Local control; Cancer-specific survival; Overall 
survival; Toxicity; Quality of life; Pain score analysis, Cost-utility analysis; 
Cost-effectiveness analysis and Budget impact analysis.
DISCUSSION: The expected benefit for the patient in the experimental arm is a 
longer expectancy of life without skeletal recurrence and the discomfort, pain 
and drastic reduction of mobility and handicap that the lack of local control of 
bone metastases eventually inflicts.

Deaths: Final Data for 2018.

Murphy SL, Xu J, Kochanek KD, Arias E, Tejada-Vera B.

Objectives-This report presents final 2018 data on U.S. deaths, death rates, 
life expectancy, infant and maternal mortality, and trends by selected 
characteristics such as age, sex, Hispanic origin and race, state of residence, 
and cause of death. The race categories are consistent with 1997 Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) standards, which are different from previous reports 
(1977 OMB standards). Methods-Information reported on death certificates is 
presented in descriptive tabulations. The original records are filed in state 
registration offices. Statistical information is compiled in a national database 
through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for 
Health Statistics. Causes of death are processed according to the International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. As of 2018, all states and the 
District of Columbia were using the 2003 revised certificate of death, which 
includes the 1997 OMB revised standards for race. The 2018 data based on the 
revised standards are not completely comparable to previous years. Selected 
estimates are presented in this report for both the revised and previous race 
standards to provide some reference for interpretation of trends. Results-In 
2018, a total of 2,839,205 deaths were reported in the United States. The 
age-adjusted death rate was 723.6 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population, a 
decrease of 1.1% from the 2017 rate. Life expectancy at birth was 78.7 years, an 
increase of 0.1 year from 2017. Age-specific death rates decreased in 2018 from 
2017 for age groups 15-24, 25-34, 45-54, 65-74, 75-84, and 85 and over. The 15 
leading causes of death in 2018 remained the same as in 2017. The infant 
mortality rate decreased 2.2% to a historically low figure of 5.66 infant deaths 
per 1,000 live births in 2018. Conclusions-The age-adjusted death rate for the 
total, male, and female populations decreased from 2017 to 2018, and life 
expectancy at birth increased in 2018 for the total, male, and female 
populations.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death globally, and 
the early identification of high risk is crucial to prevent the disease and to 
reduce healthcare costs. Short life expectancy and increased mortality among the 
Roma are generally accepted (although not indeed proven by mortality analyses) 
which can be partially explained by the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk 
factors (CVRF) among them. This study aims to elaborate on the prevalence of the 
most important CVD risk factors, assess the estimation of a 10-year risk of 
development of fatal and nonfatal CVDs based on the most used risk assessment 
scoring models, and to compare the Hungarian general (HG) and Roma (HR) 
populations. In 2018 a complex health survey was accomplished on the HG 
(n = 380) and HR (n = 347) populations. The prevalence of CVRS was defined and 
10-year cardiovascular risk was estimated for both study populations using the 
following systems: Framingham Risk Score for hard coronary heart disease 
(FRSCHD) and for cardiovascular disease (FRSCVD), Systematic COronary Risk 
Evaluation (SCORE), ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) and Revised Pooled 
Cohort Equations (RPCE). After the risk scores had been calculated, the 
populations were divided into risk categories and all subjects were classified. 
For all CVD risk estimation scores, the average of the estimated risk was higher 
among Roma compared to the HG independently of the gender. The proportion of 
high-risk group in the Hungarian Roma males population was on average 1.5-3 
times higher than in the general one. Among Roma females, the average risk value 
was higher than in the HG one. The proportion of high-risk group in the 
Hungarian Roma females population was on average 2-3 times higher compared to 
the distribution of females in the general population. Our results show that 
both genders in the Hungarian Roma population have a significantly higher risk 
for a 10-year development of cardiovascular diseases and dying from them 
compared to the HG one. Therefore, cardiovascular interventions should be 
focusing not only on reducing smoking among Roma but on improving health 
literacy and service provision regarding prevention, early recognition, and 
treatment of lipid disorders and diabetes among them.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the safety, efficacy, and surgical 
outcome of an extensive posterolateral approach for giant spinal epidural 
tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our clinical study included 12 patients with various 
giant primary tumors and metastases of the spine, who underwent surgery between 
2008 and 2019. The surgical procedure consisted of costotransversectomy, 
laminectomy, corpectomy, tumor resection, spinal column stabilization, and 
reconstruction. Neurological status examination and pain assessment were 
recorded at the time of admission, upon discharge and at outpatient check-up.
RESULTS: In our clinical sample, there were no major perioperative 
complications. All patients were discharged from the intensive care unit back to 
the hospital department within a week after the surgery. Postoperative follow-up 
showed no deterioration of neurological status. Furthermore, there was a 
moderate to significant improvement of paraparesis in all patients for weeks 
after surgery. The most notable improvement was significant pain relief in all 
the patients. None of the patients had issues with failure of the implanted 
hardware. Two patients died less than six months after the surgery due to the 
progression of the primary malignant process.
CONCLUSION: An extensive posterolateral approach to giant spinal epidural tumors 
is an effective one-step approach. It presents a good compromise between 
invasiveness and sufficient exposure for both tumor resection and spinal column 
reconstruction. Good short-term clinical improvement can be achieved, but the 
long term results depend on the advancement of the initial disease. Careful 
evaluation and selection of patients are necessary to achieve clinical 
improvement and prolonged life expectancy, and the best results are achieved 
with a multidisciplinary approach.

Aim: To assess the trial-based cost-effectiveness of medication review with 
follow-up compared with usual care in primary care. Materials & methods: A 
cluster randomized controlled trial included patients if they were independent 
older adults, receiving five or more prescriptions, with moderate or high 
cardiovascular risk. Costs were estimated from the public healthcare sector 
perspective, and health benefits were measured as quality-adjusted life years. 
Both of which were used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. 
Results: Twelve centers completed the study, six (146 patients) in the 
intervention group and six (145 patients) in the control group. The base-case 
analysis showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$ 
(2019) 434.4/quality-adjusted life year (95% CI 64.20-996.03). Conclusion: The 
intervention was cost-effective in the public primary care setting.

BACKGROUND: Neonatal bacterial infections are a common cause of death, which can 
be managed well with inpatient treatment. Unfortunately, many families in low 
resource settings do not accept referral to a hospital. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) developed a guideline for management of young infants up to 2 
months of age with possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) when referral is 
not feasible. Government of Ethiopia with WHO evaluated the feasibility of 
implementing this guideline to increase coverage of treatment.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to implement a simplified antibiotic 
regimen (2 days gentamicin injection and 7 days oral amoxicillin) for management 
of sick young infants with PSBI in a programme setting when referral was not 
feasible to identify at least 80% of PSBI cases, achieve an overall adequate 
treatment coverage of at least 80% and document the challenges and opportunities 
for implementation at the community level in two districts in Tigray, Ethiopia.
METHODS: Using implementation research, we applied the PSBI guideline in a 
programme setting from January 2016 to August 2017 in Raya Alamata and Raya 
Azebo Woredas (districts) in Southern Tigray, Ethiopia with a population of 
260884. Policy dialogue was held with decision-makers, programme implementers 
and stakeholders at federal, regional and district levels, and a Technical 
Support Unit (TSU) was established. Health Extension Workers (HEWs) working at 
the health posts and supervisors working at the health centres were trained in 
WHO guideline to manage sick young infants when referral was not feasible. 
Communities were sensitized towards appropriate home care.
RESULTS: We identified 854 young infants with any sign of PSBI in the study 
population of 7857 live births. The expected live births during the study period 
were 9821. Assuming 10% of neonates will have any sign of PSBI within the first 
2 months of life (n = 982), the coverage of appropriate treatment of PSBI cases 
in our study area was 87% (854/982). Of the 854 sick young infants, 333 (39%) 
were taken directly to a hospital and 521 (61%) were identified by HEW at health 
posts. Of the 521 young infants, 27 (5.2%) had signs of critical illness, 181 
(34.7%) had signs of clinical severe infection, whereas 313 (60.1%) young 
infants 7-59 days of age had only fast breathing pneumonia. All young infants 
with critical illness accepted referral to a hospital, while 117/181 (64.6%) 
infants with clinical severe infection accepted referral. Families of 64 (35.3%) 
infants with clinical severe infection refused referral and were treated at the 
health post with injectable gentamicin for 2 days plus oral amoxicillin for 7 
days. All 64 completed recommended gentamicin doses and 63/64 (98%) completed 
recommended amoxicillin doses. Of 313 young infants, 7-59 days with pneumonia 
who were treated by the HEWs without referral with oral amoxicillin for 7 days, 
310 (99%) received all 14 doses. No deaths were reported among those treated on 
an outpatient basis at health posts. But 35/477 (7%) deaths occurred among young 
infants treated at hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: When referral is not feasible, young infants with PSBI can be 
managed appropriately at health posts by HEWs in the existing health system in 
Ethiopia with high coverage, low treatment failure and a low case fatality rate. 
Moreover, fast breathing pneumonia in infants 7-59 days of age can be 
successfully treated at the health post without referral. Relatively higher 
mortality in sick young infants at the referral level health facilities warrants 
further investigation.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The leading surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy is 
anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). However, it has been suggested 
that ACDF procedures could lead to accelerated degeneration of the adjacent 
cervical discs (adjacent segment disease, or ASD) and the effect of ACDF surgery 
on neck symptoms and quality of life in the long term is not fully understood. 
Patients operated on at young ages generally have a long life expectancy and a 
long number of working years ahead of them. Thus, this patient group is of 
special interest when considering the accumulation of cervical problems due to 
possible ASD, the overall progressive nature of cervical degeneration in the 
long term, and their effects on related quality of life.
PURPOSE: Our goal was to study the health-related quality of life in the 
long-term follow-up after ACDF surgery in the young adult population between the 
ages of 18 and 40.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study with propensity matched controls.
PATIENT SAMPLE: All patients between 18 and 40 years of age at the time of the 
surgery who underwent ACDF due to degenerative cervical disease at Helsinki 
University Hospital between the years 1990 and 2005 who had filled in the 
quality of life questionnaires 12 to 28 years after the surgery (281 patients), 
and a propensity matched control cohort of the general population selected based 
on age, sex, and smoking status.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality of life measured by the EuroQol questionnaire 
(EQ-5D-3L and EQ-VAS).
METHODS: The medical records of all patients who underwent ACDF due to 
degenerative cervical disease at the age of 18 to 40 years at Helsinki 
University Hospital between 1990 and 2005 were analyzed retrospectively. The 
EuroQol questionnaire was sent to all patients whose contact information could 
be obtained (443 patients) at the end of the follow-up (median 17.5 years) to 
assess their current quality of life. A total of 281 patients returned the 
questionnaires and were included in this study. Quality of life was compared to 
that in the general Finnish population using a similar sized control cohort 
selected through propensity matching.
RESULTS: The patients who had undergone ACDF surgery reported significantly more 
problems than the general population cohort in three out of five dimensions that 
were assessed in the EQ-5D questionnaire, including mobility, usual activities, 
and pain/discomfort. Similarly, the overall EQ-5D-3L index calculated from the 
dimensional values was lower (0.74 vs. 0.83, p=.000), depicting a generally 
decreased health-related quality of life among patients. Spondylosis as a 
primary diagnosis, clinical myelopathy, and further cervical surgeries were 
associated with lower quality of life in the subgroup analyses of the patients. 
Similarly, in the EQ-VAS assessment, patient subgroups with spondylosis as a 
primary diagnosis, at least one reoperation, operation on more than one level, 
and clinical myelopathy were associated with lower scores and lower quality of 
life. The mean EQ-VAS score among patients was 73%. Regardless of the decreased 
health-related quality of life, there was no statistically significant 
difference in the concurrent employment status between the patient and control 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The health-related life quality measured by the EQ-5D-3L was lower 
in the patient population than in the general population. Patients had more 
problems with mobility and usual activities and more pain/discomfort. However, 
satisfaction with the surgery was very high, and there was no significant 
difference in employment status between the patients and the control population. 
Patients with spondylosis as a primary diagnosis had lower quality of life 
compared to patients with disc herniation. Also, clinical myelopathy and further 
cervical surgeries during follow-up were associated with lower quality of life 
in the subgroup analyses of the patients. It must also be kept in mind that we 
do not know what the situation could have been without surgery and with 
conservative treatment only.

Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, with few 
possibilities for therapeutic approaches, due to its multi-drug resistance and, 
consequently, low survival rate for patients. Conventional therapies for 
treatment melanoma include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and 
immunotherapy, which have various side effects. For this reason, in recent 
years, pharmaceutical and biomedical research has focused on new sito-specific 
alternative therapeutic strategies. In this regard, nanotechnology offers 
numerous benefits which could improve the life expectancy of melanoma patients 
with very low adverse effects. This review aims to examine the latest advances 
in nanotechnology as an innovative strategy for treating melanoma. In 
particular, the use of different types of nanoparticles, such as vesicles, 
polymers, metal-based, carbon nanotubes, dendrimers, solid lipid, microneedles, 
and their combination with immunotherapies and vaccines will be discussed.

of Economics and Political Science, London WC2A 2AE, UK.

Loneliness has been associated with poor mental health and wellbeing. In 
England, a 2018 national strategy on loneliness was published, and public health 
guidelines recommend participation in social activities. In the absence of 
existing economic evidence, we modelled the potential cost effectiveness of a 
service that connects lonely older people to social activities against 
no-intervention. A 5-year Markov model was constructed from a health and social 
care perspective. Parameters were drawn from the literature, with the 
intervention structure based on an existing loneliness alleviation programme 
implemented in several settings across England. Univariate and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were undertaken. The total expected cost per participant in 
the intervention group is £ 7131 compared to £ 6783 in the usual care group with 
0.45 loneliness free years (LFY) gained. The incremental cost per LFY gained is 
£ 768; in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis the intervention is cost saving 
in 3.5% of iterations. Potentially such interventions may be cost-effective but 
are unlikely to be cost-saving even allowing for sustained effects and 
cumulative adverse health and social care events averted. Empirical studies are 
needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of these interventions, ideally 
mapping changes in loneliness to the quality of life, in order to allow the key 
metric in health economic studies, cost per quality adjusted life year to be 
estimated.
