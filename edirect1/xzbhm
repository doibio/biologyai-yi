dystrophy.

Ontario, Canada.

As life expectancy of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has 
increased to the 5th decade, in part due to improved ventilatory support, 
cardiomyopathy is projected to increase as a cause of death. International 
guidelines recommend an annual assessment of cardiac function and initiation of 
appropriate pharmacological treatment. We conducted an audit of the cardiac 
management in patients with DMD requiring ventilatory support and reported a 
case series of the collated cardiac investigations. Patients with DMD requiring 
ventilatory support were included in the study. The date of the last 
electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), cardiology review and 
pharmacological management were retrieved from the medical records. If an annual 
cardiac assessment had not been performed this was requested and the latest ECGs 
and ECHO reports were collated. A total of 30 patients with DMD (29 males, mean 
(SD) age of 30 (7) years) met the inclusion criteria. Although there was ECG and 
ECHO documentation in 24 and 21 individuals, respectively, it was only recent in 
10 and 6 individuals. In all, 60% of patients had been assessed by a 
cardiologist, but only 10% within the last year. Over half of the patients 
failed to attend their new appointments. From the available results, 18 of the 
19 patients had an abnormal ECG, 11 of the 16 patients had left ventricular (LV) 
impairment and 55% of patients had a change in prescription following cardiac 
investigations. There is a need for a coordinated cardiorespiratory approach 
towards adult patients with DMD. Over a third of patients had normal LV function 
suggesting that cardiomyopathy is not inevitable in this group.

Semicompeting risks in aging research: methods, issues and needs.

Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA, ravi.varadhan@jhu.edu.

A semicompeting risks problem involves two-types of events: a nonterminal and a 
terminal event (death). Typically, the nonterminal event is the focus of the 
study, but the terminal event can preclude the occurrence of the nonterminal 
event. Semicompeting risks are ubiquitous in studies of aging. Examples of 
semicompeting risk dyads include: dementia and death, frailty syndrome and 
death, disability and death, and nursing home placement and death. Semicompeting 
risk models can be divided into two broad classes: models based only on 
observables quantities (class [Formula: see text]) and those based on potential 
(latent) failure times (class [Formula: see text]). The classical illness-death 
model belongs to class [Formula: see text]. This model is a special case of the 
multistate models, which has been an active area of methodology development. 
During the past decade and a half, there has also been a flurry of 
methodological activity on semicompeting risks based on latent failure times 
([Formula: see text] models). These advances notwithstanding, the semicompeting 
risks methodology has not penetrated biomedical research, in general, and 
gerontological research, in particular. Some possible reasons for this lack of 
uptake are: the methods are relatively new and sophisticated, conceptual 
problems associated with potential failure time models are difficult to 
overcome, paucity of expository articles aimed at educating practitioners, and 
non-availability of readily usable software. The main goals of this review 
article are: (i) to describe the major types of semicompeting risks problems 
arising in aging research, (ii) to provide a brief survey of the semicompeting 
risks methods, (iii) to suggest appropriate methods for addressing the problems 
in aging research, (iv) to highlight areas where more work is needed, and (v) to 
suggest ways to facilitate the uptake of the semicompeting risks methodology by 
the broader biomedical research community.

preference-based quality of life instruments: a qualitative exploration.

Columbia, Canada. david_whitehurst@sfu.ca.

BACKGROUND: Generic preference-based health-related quality of life instruments 
are widely used to measure health benefit within economic evaluation. The 
availability of multiple instruments raises questions about their relative 
merits and recent studies have highlighted the paucity of evidence regarding 
measurement properties in the context of spinal cord injury (SCI). This 
qualitative study explores the views of individuals living with SCI towards six 
established instruments with the objective of identifying 'preferred' outcome 
measures (from the perspective of the study participants).
METHODS: Individuals living with SCI were invited to participate in one of three 
focus groups. Eligible participants were identified from Vancouver General 
Hospital's Spine Program database; purposive sampling was used to ensure 
representation of different demographics and injury characteristics. Perceptions 
and opinions were solicited on the following questionnaires: 15D, Assessment of 
Quality of Life 8-dimension (AQoL-8D), EQ-5D-5L, Health Utilities Index (HUI), 
Quality of Well-Being Scale Self-Administered (QWB-SA), and the SF-36v2. 
Framework analysis was used to analyse the qualitative information gathered 
during discussion. Strengths and limitations of each questionnaire were 
thematically identified and managed using NVivo 9 software.
RESULTS: Major emergent themes were (i) general perceptions, (ii) 
comprehensiveness, (iii) content, (iv) wording and (v) features. Two sub-themes 
pertinent to content were also identified; 'questions' and 'options'. All focus 
group participants (n = 15) perceived the AQoL-8D to be the most relevant 
instrument to administer within the SCI population. This measure was considered 
to be comprehensive, with relevant content (i.e. wheelchair inclusive) and 
applicable items. Participants had mixed perceptions about the other 
questionnaires, albeit to varying degrees.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a strong theoretical underpinning, the AQoL-8D (and other 
AQoL instruments) is infrequently used outside its country of origin 
(Australia). Empirical comparative analyses of the favoured instruments 
identified in this qualitative study are necessary within the context of spinal 
cord injury.

BACKGROUND: Magnesium sulphate, administered by the intravenous (i.v.) or 
inhaled (nebulised) route, has been proposed as a treatment for adults with 
acute severe asthma. Existing trials show mixed results and uncertain evidence 
of benefit.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether i.v. or nebulised magnesium sulphate 
improves symptoms of breathlessness and reduces the need for hospital admission 
in adults with acute severe asthma.
DESIGN: Multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm, randomised 
trial.
SETTING: The emergency departments of 34 acute hospitals in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 1109 adults (age >16 years) with acute severe asthma 
[peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) <50% of best/predicted, respiratory rate >25 
breaths per minute, heart rate >110 beats per minute or inability to complete 
sentences in one breath]. Patients with life-threatening features or a 
contraindication to either nebulised or intravenous magnesium sulphate were 
excluded.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly allocated to i.v. magnesium sulphate 
(2 g over 20 minutes) or nebulised magnesium sulphate (3 × 500 mg over 1 hour) 
or standard therapy alone.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients 
admitted to hospital (either after emergency department treatment or at any time 
over the subsequent 7 days) and breathlessness measured on a 100-mm visual 
analogue scale (VAS) over 2 hours after initiation of treatment.
RESULTS: We randomised 406 patients to i.v. magnesium sulphate, 339 to nebulised 
magnesium sulphate and 364 to placebo. Hospital admission was recorded for 394, 
332 and 358 patients, respectively, and VAS breathlessness for 357, 296 and 323 
patients respectively. Mean age was 36.1 years and 763 out of 1084 (70%) 
patients were female. Intravenous magnesium sulphate was associated with an odds 
ratio (OR) of 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.04; p=0.083] for 
hospital admission, an improvement in VAS breathlessness that was 2.6 mm (95% CI 
-1.6 to 6.8 mm; p=0.231) greater than that associated with placebo and an 
improvement in PEFR that was 2.4 l/minute (95% CI -8.8 to 13.6 l/minute; 
p=0.680) greater than that associated with placebo. Nebulised magnesium sulphate 
was associated with an OR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.40; p=0.819) for hospital 
admission, an improvement in VAS breathlessness that was 2.6 mm (95% CI -1.8 mm 
to 7.0 mm; p=0.253) less than that associated with placebo and an improvement in 
PEFR that was 2.6 l/minute (95% CI -9.2 to 14.5 l/minute; p=0.644) less than 
that associated with placebo. There were no significant differences between i.v. 
or nebulised magnesium sulphate and placebo for any other outcomes. The number 
(%) of patients reporting any side effect was 61 (15.5%) in the i.v. group, 52 
(15.7%) in the nebuliser group and 36 (10.1%) in the placebo group. The ORs for 
suffering any side effect were 1.68 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.63; p=0.025) for i.v. 
compared with placebo and 1.67 (95% CI 1.05 to 2.66; p=0.031) for nebuliser 
compared with placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to demonstrate a clinically worthwhile benefit from 
magnesium sulphate in acute severe asthma. There was some weak evidence of an 
effect of i.v. magnesium sulphate on hospital admission, but no evidence of an 
effect on VAS breathlessness or PEFR compared with placebo. We found no evidence 
that nebulised magnesium sulphate was more effective than placebo.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of tea tree oil (TTO - Melaleuca 
alternifolia) on hepatic and renal functions, and the immune response of rats 
infected by Trypanosoma evansi. A pilot study has shown that rats treated with 
TTO orally (1 ml kg(-1)) had increased survival rate without curative effect. In 
order to verify if increased longevity was related to a better immune response 
against T. evansi when using tea tree oil, a second experiment was conducted. 
Thus, twenty-four rats were divided into four groups. The groups A and B were 
composed of uninfected animals, and the groups C and D had rats experimentally 
infected by T. evansi. Animals from the groups B and D were treated orally with 
TTO (1 ml kg(-1)) for three days. Blood samples were collected to verify humoral 
response analysis for immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgE, and IgG) and cytokines 
(TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-1, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-10) at days 0, 3, 5 and 15 
post-infection (PI). TTO treatment caused changes in the immunoglobulins and 
cytokines profile, as well as the course of T. evansi infection in rats. It was 
found that the TTO was not toxic, i.e., hepatic and renal functions were not 
affected. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that TTO influences the levels 
of inflammatory mediators and has trypanocidal effect, increasing life 
expectancy of rats infected by T. evansi.

BACKGROUND: Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a hereditary genetic disease causing 
bilateral retinal degeneration. RP is a leading cause of blindness resulting in 
incurable visual impairment and drastic reduction in the Quality of life of the 
patients. Second Sight Medical Products Inc. developed Argus II, a retinal 
prosthesis system for treating RP. Argus II is the world's first ever-commercial 
implant intended to restore some vision in the blind patients. The objective of 
this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Argus® II Retinal 
Prosthesis System (Argus II) in Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) patients.
METHOD: A multi -state transition Markov model was developed to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of Argus II versus usual care in RP from the perspective of 
healthcare payer. A hypothetical cohort of 1000 RP patients aged 46 years 
followed up over a (lifetime) 25-year time horizon. Health outcomes were 
expressed as quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct healthcare costs 
expressed in 2012 €. Results are reported as incremental cost per ratios (ICERs) 
with outcomes and costs discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%.
RESULTS: The ICER for Argus II was €14,603/QALY. Taking into account the 
uncertainty in model inputs the ICER was €14,482/QALY in the probabilistic 
analysis. In the scenarios of an assumption of no reduction on cost across model 
visual acuity states or a model time horizon as short as 10 years the ICER 
increased to €31,890/QALY and €49,769/QALY respectively.
CONCLUSION: This economic evaluation shows that Argus II is a cost-effective 
intervention compared to usual care of the RP patients. The lifetime analysis 
ICER for Argus II falls below the published societal willingness to pay of 
EuroZone countries.

The term sarcopenia refers to the loss of muscle mass that occurs with ageing. 
On the basis of study results showing that muscle mass is only moderately 
related to functional outcomes, international working groups have proposed that 
loss of muscle strength or physical function should also be included in the 
definition. Irrespective of how sarcopenia is defined, both low muscle mass and 
poor muscle strength are clearly highly prevalent and important risk factors for 
disability and potentially mortality in individuals as they age. Many chronic 
diseases, in addition to ageing, could also accelerate decrease of muscle mass 
and strength, and this effect could be a main underlying mechanism by which 
chronic diseases cause physical disability. In this Review, we address both 
age-related and disease-related muscle loss, with a focus on diabetes and 
obesity but including other disease states, and potential common mechanisms and 
treatments. Development of treatments for age-related and disease-related muscle 
loss might improve active life expectancy in older people, and lead to 
substantial health-care savings and improved quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Only lamivudine has been included for patients with chronic 
hepatitis B (CHB) in the National List of Essential Drugs (NLED), a 
pharmaceutical reimbursement list in Thailand. There have also been no economic 
evaluation studies of CHB drug treatments conducted in Thailand yet. In order to 
fill this gap in policy research, the objective of this study was to compare the 
cost-utility of each drug therapy (Figure 1) with palliative care in patients 
with HBeAg-positive CHB.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using an economic evaluation model was 
performed to compare each drug treatment for HBeAg-positive CHB patients. A 
Markov model was used to estimate the relevant costs and health outcomes during 
a lifetime horizon based on a societal perspective. Direct medical costs, direct 
non-medical costs, and indirect costs were included, and health outcomes were 
denoted in life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The results 
were presented as an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) in Thai baht 
(THB) per LY or QALY gained. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were applied to investigate the effects of model parameter 
uncertainties.
RESULTS: The ICER values of providing generic lamivudine with the addition of 
tenofovir when drug resistance occurred, generic lamivudine with the addition of 
tenofovir based on the road map guideline, and tenofovir monotherapy were 
-14,000 (USD -467), -8,000 (USD -267) , and -5,000 (USD -167) THB per QALY 
gained, respectively. However, when taking into account all parameter 
uncertainties in the model, providing generic lamivudine with the addition of 
tenofovir when drug resistance occurred (78% and 75%) and tenofovir monotherapy 
(18% and 24%) would yield higher probabilities of being cost-effective at the 
societal willingness to pay thresholds of 100,000 (USD 3,333) and 300,000 (USD 
10,000) THB per QALY gained in Thailand, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the policy recommendations from this study, the Thai 
government decided to include tenofovir into the NLED in addition to generic 
lamivudine which is already on the list. Moreover, the results have shown that 
the preferred treatment regimen involves using generic lamivudine as the 
first-line drug with tenofovir added if drug resistance occurs in HBeAg-positive 
CHB patients.

Innovating aging: promises and pitfalls on the road to life extension.

Vijg J(1), de Grey AD.

Author information:

USA.

One of the main benefits of the dramatic technological progress over the last 
two centuries is the enormous increase in human life expectancy, which has now 
reached record highs. After conquering most childhood diseases and a fair 
fraction of the diseases that plague adulthood, medical technology is now mainly 
preoccupied by age-related disorders. Further progress is dependent on 
circumventing the traditional medical focus on individual diseases and instead 
targeting aging as a whole as the ultimate cause of the health problems that 
affect humankind at old age. In principle, a major effort to control the gradual 
accumulation of molecular and cellular damage - considered by many as the 
ultimate cause of intrinsic aging - may rapidly lead to interventions for 
regenerating aged and worn-out tissues and organs. While considered impossible 
by many, there really is no reason to reject this as scientifically implausible. 
However, as we posit, it is not only scientific progress that is currently a 
limiting factor, but societal factors that hinder and may ultimately prevent 
further progress in testing and adopting the many possible interventions to cure 
aging.

Packard Children's Hospital, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, 
California, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lung transplantation for infants and children is an accepted 
but rarely exercised option for the treatment of end-stage lung disease, with 
outcomes equivalent to those for adults. However, widespread misconceptions 
regarding pediatric outcomes often confound timely and appropriate referral to 
specialty centers. We present the updated information for primary pediatricians 
to utilize when counseling families with children confronted by progressive 
end-stage pulmonary or cardiovascular disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: We provide general guidelines to consider for referral, and 
discuss allocation of organs in children, information regarding standard 
treatment protocols, and survival outcomes.
SUMMARY: Lung transplantation is a worthwhile treatment option to consider in 
children with end-stage lung disease. The treatment is complex, but lung 
transplant provides substantial survival benefit and markedly improved quality 
of life for children and their families. This timely review provides 
comprehensive information for pediatricians who are considering options for 
treatment of children with end-stage lung disease.

Clinical implications of statin therapy in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Erin K. Hennessey, Pharm.D., BCPS, is 
Assistant Professor, Department of Pharmacy Practice, St. Louis College of 
Pharmacy, St. Louis, MO.

PURPOSE: The clinical implications regarding the use of statins in patients with 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis are explored.
SUMMARY: The majority of the evidence reviewed from randomized controlled trials 
and recent meta-analyses suggest that there is minimal to no benefit of statin 
therapy for reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), including 
cardiovascular events and mortality, for statin-naive patients undergoing 
hemodialysis. The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) 2003 
dyslipidemia guidelines recommended that patients with ESRD receive a statin to 
reach a goal low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration of <100 
mg/dL; however, there was no distinction between nondialysis and dialysis 
patients, and newer evidence has since been published. Although KDOQI released 
2012 guidelines that recommended against the initiation of statins in dialysis 
patients due to the lack of evidence to support benefit, the guidelines were 
specific for diabetic dialysis patients. Clinicians should use their clinical 
judgment and weigh the risks and benefits from the available evidence when 
deciding whether to initiate statins in hemodialysis patients. A statin may be 
warranted for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events or in younger 
hemodialysis patients who have a longer life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: The available literature does not support the initiation of statins 
in hemodialysis patients who were not receiving statin therapy before requiring 
hemodialysis. At this time, there are no conclusive data to support 
discontinuation of statins in ESRD patients on hemodialysis receiving statins 
for either primary or secondary prevention of CHD.

The management of synchronous prostate and rectal cancer is a challeging task 
for the general surgeons and urologists, due to the complex anatomy of the 
pelvis and the sequential significant effects on the patient's functional 
independency and quality of life. As both rectal and prostate cancers still 
remain leading causes of death in the male population, along with the increase 
of the average life expectancy, it is certain that synchronous prostate and 
rectal cancer will be a clinical scenario that the clinicians of the future will 
encounter more frequently. Our aim is to perform a comprehensive review on the 
management of this oncological entity, focusing on the significance of 
multidisciplinary approach which will enable the formation of an accurate 
strategy plan, having at all times the patient in the center of desicion-making.

Cost-effectiveness of family history-based colorectal cancer screening in 
Australia.

Melbourne, VIC 3010, Australia. drissao@unimelb.edu.au.

BACKGROUND: With 14.234 diagnoses and over 4047 deaths reported in 2007, 
colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer and second most common 
cause of cancer-related mortality in Australia. The direct treatment cost has 
recently been estimated to be around AU$1.2 billion for the year 2011, which 
corresponds to a four-fold increase, compared the cost reported in 2001. 
Excluding CRCs due to known rare genetic disorders, 20% to 25% of all CRCs occur 
in a familial aggregation setting due to genetic variants or shared 
environmental risk factors that are yet to be characterised. A targeted 
screening strategy addressed to this segment of the population is a potentially 
valuable tool for reducing the overall burden of CRC.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of three 
screening strategies offered to people at increased risk due to a strong family 
history of CRC. The model simulated the evolution of a cohort of 10,000 
individuals from age 50 to 90 years. We compared screening with biennial iFOBT, 
five-yearly colonoscopy and ten-yearly colonoscopy versus the current strategy 
of the Australian National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (i.e. base case).
RESULTS: Under the NBCSP scenario, 6,491 persons developed CRC with an average 
screening lifetime cost of AU$3,441 per person. In comparison, screening with 
biennial iFOBT, colonoscopy every ten years, and colonoscopy every five years 
reduced CRC incidence by 27%, 35% and 60%, and mortality by 15%, 26% and 46% 
respectively. All three screening strategies had a cost under AU$50,000 per life 
year gained, which is regarded as the upper limit of acceptable 
cost-effectiveness in the Australian health system. At AU$12,405 per life year 
gained and an average lifetime expectancy of 16.084 years, five-yearly 
colonoscopy screening was the most cost-effective strategy.
CONCLUSION: The model demonstrates that intensive CRC screening strategies 
targeting people at increased risk would be cost-effective in the Australian 
context. Our findings provide evidence that substantial health benefits can be 
generated from risk-based CRC screening at a relatively modest incremental cost.

The action of nutrients on early postnatal growth can influence mammalian aging 
and longevity. Recent work has demonstrated that limiting nutrient availability 
in the first 3 wk of life [by increasing the number of pups in the 
crowded-litter (CL) model] leads to extension of mean and maximal lifespan in 
genetically normal mice. In this study, we aimed to characterize the impact of 
early-life nutrient intervention on glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis in 
CL mice. In our study, we used mice from litters supplemented to 12 or 15 pups 
and compared those to control litters limited to eight pups. At weaning and then 
throughout adult life, CL mice are significantly leaner and consume more oxygen 
relative to control mice. At 6 mo of age, CL mice had low fasting leptin 
concentrations, and low-dose leptin injections reduced body weight and food 
intake more in CL female mice than in controls. At 22 mo, CL female mice also 
have smaller adipocytes compared with controls. Glucose and insulin tolerance 
tests show an increase in insulin sensitivity in 6 mo old CL male mice, and 
females become more insulin sensitive later in life. Furthermore, β-cell mass 
was significantly reduced in the CL male mice and was associated with reduction 
in β-cell proliferation rate in these mice. Together, these data show that 
early-life nutrient intervention has a significant lifelong effect on metabolic 
characteristics that may contribute to the increased lifespan of CL mice.

BACKGROUND: With an increase in life expectancy, very elderly patients are 
presenting with gastric cancer more commonly than ever. The present study 
retrospectively analyzed the surgical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted 
gastrectomy for gastric cancer in the young, elderly, and very elderly age 
groups.
METHODS: The study group consisted of 1,055 patients who underwent 
laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy between February 2002 and December 2012. We 
divided these patients into three groups; group 1 (young age, <65 years), group 
2 (elderly age, 65-74 years), and group 3 (very elderly age, ≥75 years).
RESULTS: There were statistical differences in the rates of postoperative 
complications among the three groups (P = 0.008). However, when assessed 
according to the severity of postoperative complications based on the 
Clavien-Dindo classification, there was no statistical difference among the 
three groups (P = 0.562).
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy for gastric cancer can be 
performed in very elderly patients. In analyzing studies of elderly patients 
with postoperative complications following the procedure, not only should the 
rate of postoperative complications be taken into consideration, but also the 
severity of any postoperative complications.

OBJECTIVE: to estimate the health impact of road traffic accidents in the Friuli 
Venezia Giulia Region, Northeastern Italy.
DESIGN: burden of disease (BoD) study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: we used data on road traffic accidents collected by 
the Police in the Friuli Venezia Giulia in 2010 and health data regarding 
Emergency Room visits, hospital admissions, and deaths.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: we calculated the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) 
lost because of road traffic accidents. The kernel density of the DALYs in the 
region was analyzed and mapped.
RESULTS: it was estimated that 3,861 DALYs were lost in 2010. Years lost because 
of premature deaths outnumbered those lost because of disability. The highest 
number of DALYs was lost among 15-44-year-old males. Of 14,361 injured persons 
included in the analysis, only 4,357 were found in the Police database. However, 
these injuries accounted for 95% of all the DALYs.
CONCLUSION: the present study identified population subgroups with a 
particularly high impact of road traffic accidents. Educational and Police 
interventions to prevent accidents should be addressed to those subgroups. In 
the future, repeating this analysis will allow an evaluation of the 
effectiveness of preventive interventions in terms of health gains.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of infliximab versus 
conventional combination treatment over 21 months in patients with 
methotrexate-refractory early rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: In this multicentre, two-arm, parallel, randomised, active-controlled, 
open-label trial, rheumatoid arthritis patients with <1 year symptom duration 
were recruited from 15 rheumatology clinics in Sweden between October 2002 and 
December 2005. After 3-4 months of methotrexate monotherapy, patients not 
achieving low disease activity were randomised to addition of infliximab or 
sulfasalazine+hydroxychloroquine (conventional treatment group). Costs of drugs, 
healthcare use, and productivity losses were retrieved from nationwide 
registers, while EuroQol 5-Dimensions utility was collected quarterly.
RESULTS: Of 487 patients initially enrolled, 128 and 130 were randomised to 
infliximab and conventional treatment, respectively. The infliximab group 
accumulated higher drug and healthcare costs (€27,487 vs €10,364; adjusted mean 
difference €16,956 (95% CI 14,647 to 19,162)), while productivity losses did not 
differ (€33,804 vs €29,220; €3961 (95% CI -3986 to 11,850)), resulting in higher 
societal cost compared to the conventional group (€61,291 vs €39,584; €20,916 
(95% CI 12,800 to 28,660)). Mean accumulated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
did not differ (1.10 vs 1.12; adjusted mean difference favouring infliximab 
treatment 0.01 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.08)). The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios for the infliximab versus conventional treatment strategy were 
€2,404,197/QALY from the societal perspective and €1,948,919/QALY from the 
healthcare perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: In early, methotrexate-refractory rheumatoid arthritis, a treatment 
strategy commencing with addition of infliximab, as compared to 
sulfasalazine+hydroxychloroquine, was not cost-effective over 21 months at 
willingness to pay levels generally considered acceptable.

[Survival and life span of Drosophila melanogaster in response to terahertz 
radiation].

[Article in Russian]

Vaĭsman NIa, Fedorov VI, Nemova EF, Nikolaev NA.

Life span control is realized by an interaction of many genetic factors with 
environment. Due to development of new modern technologies based on non-ionized 
terahertz radiation (0,1-10 THz) the investigation of this radiation influence 
on living organisms becomes actual. In our study terahertz radiation effects on 
survival and life span of Oregon R line of Drosophila meanogaster were 
multidirectional depending on the age of the insects. Terahertz effect on 
survival was negative or neutral in the early life and positive in the later 
life. In Drosophila response to terahertz radiation sex differences were 
manifested. Males were not very sensitive to terahertz radiation. Irradiated 
female survival was increased significantly in the second half of imago life. 
Irradiation of Drosophila not influenced significantly on average and maximal 
values of life span, but the gap between the values of average life span of 
males and females in this group of insects was increased. Mechanisms of 
terahertz radiation effects on survival and life span maybe associated with 
changes in cellular membrane, gene expression and signaling pathways, 
controlling these properties.

Athetis lepigone (Möschler) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is an important insect pest 
of corn crops in China. To determine the effect of temperature on A. lepigone 
growth, and to provide a forecasting model for this pest, the development and 
fecundity of A. lepigone under five different temperatures (18, 21, 24, 27, 30 
°C) was investigated, and an experimental population life table was constructed 
based on the obtained results. The results showed that the duration of 
development of A. lepigone decreased as the temperature increased from 18 to 30 
°C. Approximately 95% of mature larvae stopped pupating at 18 °C, and about 70% 
of mature larvae stopped pupating at 21 °C. When the growth chamber temperature 
was above 24 °C, no growth arrest was observed. The results indicated that the 
optimum growth temperature of A. lepigone was about 26.47 °C. In this study, the 
highest survival rate, fecundity per female, and population index trend were 
observed when the temperature was set at 27 °C. The percentages of larvae that 
could spin cocoons after the 5th or 6th instar differed at the different 
temperatures. The developmental threshold temperatures for A. lepigone eggs, 
larvae, pre-pupae, pupae, preoviposition females, and the whole generation 
(i.e., egg to oviposition) were 11.03, 9.04, 15.08, 11.79, 11.63, and 10.84 °C, 
respectively, and their effective accumulative temperatures were 63.51, 339.42, 
30.04, 118.41, 35.06 and 574.08 degree-days, respectively. Based on the 
effective accumulative temperature law, this pest insect can have four 
generations in most of the Huang-Huai region of China, and two to three 
generations annually in some cold regions. Athetis lepigone may have four 
generations in the mid-southern part of Hebei Province. This prediction matches 
the field survey results.

Life expectancy has significantly increased over the past 30 years, with a 
greater prevalence of diverse disease states, especially cancer. As older 
persons are a very heterogeneous group with an increased prevalence of 
comorbidities and a relative inability to tolerate the adverse effects of 
chemotherapy, the treatment of cancer in the elderly is particularly demanding. 
The principles of its management are similar to those in younger patients but 
with special considerations linked to comorbidities and clinical status. The 
objective of chemotherapeutic treatment in metastatic breast cancer has 
historically been primarily palliative. The introduction of newer approaches 
with improved or at least equivalent efficacy and reduced toxicity is highly 
desirable. Such approaches may include the use of less toxic drugs, more 
convenient routes of administration (e.g., oral) and home-based (outpatient) 
rather than hospital-based therapies. The available oral cytostatic drugs 
include vinorelbine and capecitabine. In this review, we analyze oral cytostatic 
drugs in the elderly patient diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer.
