Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors substantially 
reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but it is presently unclear whether 
they also reduce mortality. The list prices of PCSK9 inhibitors in the United 
States (>$14,500 per year) are >100× higher than generic statins, and only a 
small fraction of their higher cost is likely to be recovered by prevention of 
cardiovascular events. The projected cost effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors does 
not meet generally accepted benchmarks for good value in the United States, but 
their value would be improved by substantial price reductions. For individual 
patients, the high out-of-pocket costs of PCSK9 inhibitors may impede access and 
reduce long-term adherence. The budgetary impact of PCSK9 inhibitors would be 
very large if all potentially eligible patients were treated, which poses 
dilemmas for policymakers, payers, and society.

INTRODUCTION: Several studies suggest that the health of an individual is 
influenced by the socioeconomic status (SES) of the community in which he or she 
lives. This analysis seeks to understand the relationship between SES, tobacco 
store density and health outcomes at the neighbourhood level in a large urban 
community.
METHODS: Data from the 55 neighbourhoods of Baltimore City were reviewed and 
parametric tests compared demographics and health outcomes for low-income and 
high-income neighbourhoods, defined by the 50th percentile in median household 
income. Summary statistics are expressed as median. Tobacco store density was 
evaluated as both an outcome and a predictor. Association between tobacco store 
densities and health outcomes was determined using Moran's I and spatial 
regression analyses to account for autocorrelation.
RESULTS: Compared with higher-income neighbourhoods, lower-income neighbourhoods 
had higher tobacco store densities (30.5 vs 16.5 stores per 10 000 persons, 
P=0.01), lower life expectancy (68.5 vs 74.9 years, P<0.001) and higher 
age-adjusted mortality (130.8 vs 102.1 deaths per 10 000 persons, P<0.001), even 
when controlling for other store densities, median household income, race, 
education status and age of residents.
CONCLUSION: In Baltimore City, median household income is inversely associated 
with tobacco store density, indicating poorer neighbourhoods in Baltimore City 
have greater accessibility to tobacco. Additionally, tobacco store density was 
linked to lower life expectancy, which underscores the necessity for 
interventions to reduce tobacco store densities.

Aggressive periodontitis and premature tooth loss in leucocyte adhesion 
deficiency (LAD) have adverse functional and psychological consequences on 
affected individuals. Dental implant rehabilitation might become necessary to 
overcome the functional and psychological adverse effects of LAD periodontitis, 
especially in patients with milder forms who are expected to have a relatively 
normal life expectancy. Outcome of dental implants in patients with LAD has not 
been previously reported; we describe the dental rehabilitation of a 24-year-old 
man with clinical features of LAD using endosseous dental implants.

Mortality Trajectories at Exceptionally High Ages: A Study of Supercentenarians.

The growing number of persons surviving to age 100 years and beyond raises 
questions about the shape of mortality trajectories at exceptionally high ages, 
and this problem may become significant for actuaries in the near future. 
However, such studies are scarce because of the difficulties in obtaining 
reliable age estimates at exceptionally high ages. The current view about 
mortality beyond age 110 years suggests that death rates do not grow with age 
and are virtually flat. The same assumption is made in the new actuarial VBT 
tables. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that the mortality of 
supercentenarians (persons living 110+ years) is constant and does not grow with 
age, and we analyze mortality trajectories at these exceptionally high ages. 
Death records of supercentenarians were taken from the International Database on 
Longevity (IDL). All ages of supercentenarians in the database were subjected to 
careful validation. We used IDL records for persons belonging to extinct birth 
cohorts (born before 1895) since the last deaths in IDL were observed in 2007. 
We also compared our results based on IDL data with a more contemporary database 
maintained by the Gerontology Research Group (GRG). First we attempted to 
replicate findings by Gampe (2010), who analyzed IDL data and came to the 
conclusion that "human mortality after age 110 is flat." We split IDL data into 
two groups: cohorts born before 1885 and cohorts born in 1885 and later. Hazard 
rate estimates were conducted using the standard procedure available in Stata 
software. We found that mortality in both groups grows with age, although in 
older cohorts, growth was slower compared with more recent cohorts and not 
statistically significant. Mortality analysis of more numerous 1884-1894 birth 
cohort with the Akaike goodness-of-fit criterion showed better fit for the 
Gompertz model than for the exponential model (flat mortality). Mortality 
analyses with GRG data produced similar results. The remaining life expectancy 
for the 1884-1894 birth cohort demonstrates rapid decline with age. This decline 
is similar to the computer-simulated trajectory expected for the Gompertz model, 
rather than the extremely slow decline in the case of the exponential model. 
These results demonstrate that hazard rates after age 110 years do not stay 
constant and suggest that mortality deceleration at older ages is not a 
universal phenomenon. These findings may represent a challenge to the existing 
theories of aging and longevity, which predict constant mortality in the late 
stages of life. One possibility for reconciliation of the observed phenomenon 
and the existing theoretical consideration is a possibility of mortality 
deceleration and mortality plateau at very high yet unobservable ages.

The cardiovascular benefits of indiscriminate supplementation of omega-3 fatty 
acids; meta-analysis and decision-making approach.

AIM: The meta-analysis was conducted to estimate of the cardiovascular benefits 
of indiscriminate supplementation of omega-3 capsules. The results, expressed in 
terms of quality adjusted life years (QALY) intuitively understood by the 
general public, can be the basis for the (personal) decision on whether to take 
omega-3 supplements.
METHODS: The results of meta-analysis of eight double-blind, placebo-controlled 
clinical trials are expressed in terms of QALY, using the Markov model and Monte 
Carlo simulations.
RESULTS: Omega-3 supplementation results in a 8% decrease of the risk of cardiac 
death, unless the patients are treated by statins. Results indicate that omega-3 
supplementation may prolong QALY by about a month. Old people gain less, whereas 
DM-2 patients and people with history of CV events gain more.
DISCUSSION: Our analysis yielded an algorithm for estimating benefit from 
omega-3 supplementation, based on the age and the individual risk of CV events 
of the patient.

CONTEXT: Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) is a constituent of Danshen Salvia 
miltiorrhiza Bunge (Lamiaceae); however, its antifatigue activity remains 
unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To study the antifatigue properties of Tan IIA and its underlying 
mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In program I, three mouse groups were separately 
subjected to three gavages with 0, 1 and 6 mg/kg Tan IIA and forced swimming 
test (FST) weekly for 8 weeks; in program II, one gavage with 0, 2 and 10 mg/kg 
Tan IIA was administered plus FST weekly for 4 weeks. Serum glucose, lactate, 
superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 
were determined after final FST.
RESULTS: Tan IIA significantly prolonged swimming durations in program I but not 
in program II. Swimming times were 3208 ± 1054 and 2443 ± 1054 s for the 1 and 
6 mg/kg treatments and 856 ± 292 s for the vehicle control. The two doses 
significantly reduced serum glucose levels (40.3 ± 8.5 and 60.0 1 ± 11.8 mg/kg) 
and lactate levels (61.3 ± 27.5 and 68.8 ± 8.5 mg/kg) in treated mice compared 
with those in control mice (137.5 ± 38.6 mg/kg and 122.7 ± 18.2 mg/kg, 
respectively). However, no significant differences were observed regarding SOD, 
MDA or BUN levels.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Tan IIA has antifatigue activity and is associated 
with reductions in serum glucose and lactate levels. Further studies should 
assess muscle hypertrophy and efficient aerobic glycolysis caused by Tan IIA. 
Tan IIA has potential as a pharmacological agent for fatigue resistance.

There is a stark disparity in the physical health of people with mental illness 
compared to those without mental illness, resulting in shorter life expectancy 
and increased rates of preventable deaths. Physical activity has previously been 
shown to have a positive impact on various markers of mental health and has been 
linked with a reduction in hospital admissions for those with chronic physical 
illness. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there is a 
relationship between physical activity and the number of days spent admitted to 
acute inpatient mental health wards in people with enduring mental illness. 
Eighty participants from four acute mental health wards in Oxfordshire, UK were 
included. Subjective and objective measurements of physical activity levels were 
collected alongside the amount of days spent admitted on acute mental health 
wards over the year previous. Participants who recorded higher levels of 
physical activity, both subjectively and objectively, were found to have spent 
less time admitted to acute mental health services. With a significant negative 
correlation found, future research should aim to investigate any causative link 
between physical activity and mental health admission.

Black Deaths Matter: Race, Relationship Loss, and Effects on Survivors.

Umberson D(1).

Author information:
(1)1 The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.

Close relationships are a resource for mental and physical health that, like 
other social resources, is unequally distributed in the population. This article 
focuses on racial disparities in the loss of relationships across the life 
course. Racial disparities in life expectancy in the United States mean that 
black Americans experience the deaths of more friends and family members than do 
white Americans from childhood through later life. I argue that these losses are 
a unique type of stress and adversity that, through interconnected 
biopsychosocial pathways, contribute to disadvantage in health over the life 
course. I focus particularly on how the interconnected pathways associated with 
loss undermine opportunities for and increase risks to social ties throughout 
life, adding to disadvantage in health. I call on social scientists and policy 
makers to draw greater attention to this unique source of disadvantage for black 
children, adults, and families.

Longevity is an aspiration at the population level, a goal of public health 
policy and research. In the later decades of life, longevity goals also deserve 
scrutiny at the personal level to understand whether people welcome longer 
lives. Contradictory preferences could be expected, both the embrace of 
longevity and hesitation. The desire for extended life was examined using 
qualitative interviews in parallel designs among 90 persons aged 62 and older at 
sites in Germany, China, and the United States. Just over one third of the 
participants declined to express aspirations for longer life, some because they 
felt that their lives had reached a stage of completion and some as a form of 
fate acceptance. A larger number did indeed want extended lives but less than 
half estimated an amount of time that they desired. Moreover, there was strong 
opinion that longer lives were desirable only if current or acceptable levels of 
health were maintained. These replies indicate that future time is welcome so 
long as it occurs in the "third age" of independent living and not in the 
"fourth age" of vulnerability and decline. Replies also reveal that many older 
adults in these three cultures conceptually map the future not as a smooth 
continuum of time but rather as segmented into states, one kind of which is 
wanted and one which is not.

Due to the increase in life expectancy and the ageing of end-stage renal disease 
patients, the number of patients older than 65 years receiving a kidney 
transplant has been continuously growing over the last fifteen years. The 
benefits of renal transplantation compared to dialysis in terms of survival and 
quality of life have been shown in selected recipients over 65, or 70 years. 
However, the age remains the main limiting factor for the access to the waiting 
list, and the reluctance of the clinicians can be explained by the multiple 
comorbidities of these candidates, their limited life expectancy or the shortage 
of grafts. The challenge is to select the candidates who can benefit from renal 
transplantation, thanks to rigorous cardiovascular and neoplastic evaluation 
before enrolment and by taking into account the specific characteristics of 
elderly patients. The living donor appears to be the ideal option for elderly 
recipients, the alternative being the extended criteria donor, allowing waiting 
times to be limited. The choice of immunosuppressive therapy is also crucial in 
these patients at high risk of infectious and cardiovascular complications in 
whom the occurrence of acute rejection can have severe consequences. There are 
currently no specific recommendations for immunosuppression in elderly 
recipients, and we would need large-scale randomized studies to improve the 
prognosis of renal transplantation in this population.

PURPOSE: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) evaluations are being 
increasingly used for clinical assessment of cancer treatment outcomes. For a 
patient, not only is life expectancy important, but also a general sense of 
sustained global health. Intuitively, the more disfiguring the treatment, the 
more pronounced could be the deterioration in the QoL. We aimed to compare 
various aspects of QoL in three groups of patients surgically treated for penile 
cancer by local excision, partial penectomy, or total penectomy.
METHODS: HRQoL was assessed in 51 patients surgically treated for penile cancer. 
Total penectomy, partial penectomy, or wide local excision was performed in 11, 
27, and 13 patients, respectively. The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire was used for 
HRQoL assessment. Relations between the patients and their partners were also 
assessed.
RESULTS: Statistically significant negative correlation was found between 
aggressiveness of the surgical procedure and both, assessment of global health 
status (p = 0.04) and physical functioning (p = 0.047). The more aggressive the 
surgery, the lower was the patients' assessment of their QoL. Among the patients 
who maintained their partner relations postsurgery, 58.9% declared that their 
relations postoperatively were not inferior compared to those preoperatively. 
There was no statistically significant effect of the surgery type on relations 
with female partners (p = 0.619).
CONCLUSION: The magnitude of disfigurement caused by surgical treatment of 
penile cancer had a significant impact on the selected QoL domains assessed by 
the EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire. There was no correlation between the scope of 
surgical intervention and partner relations.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to retrospectively analyze early and 
follow-up results of above-the-knee femoropopliteal bypasses (AKb) performed 
with a bioactive heparin-bonded expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (HB-ePTFE) 
graft in patients with peripheral arterial obstructive disease in a multicentric 
retrospective registry involving seven Italian vascular centers.
METHODS: During a 14-year period ending in March 2016, an HB-ePTFE graft was 
used in 1401 interventions performed for peripheral arterial obstructive 
disease. Comorbidities, risk factors, and follow-up outcomes were collected in a 
multicenter registry with a dedicated database. A post hoc analysis of the 
database was performed to identify 364 (25.9%) patients who underwent AKb. Early 
(intraoperative and <30 days) results were analyzed in terms of death, 
thrombosis, amputations, reinterventions, and the occurrence of major local and 
systemic complications. Follow-up results were analyzed by life-table analysis 
(Kaplan-Meier test) in terms of primary and secondary graft patency, assisted 
primary patency, limb preservation, and amputation-free survival. The analysis 
of follow-up results was stopped in December 2016.
RESULTS: In 61 (16.7%) patients, AKb was performed after the failure of a 
previous ipsilateral revascularization. Critical limb ischemia was present in 
164 (45%) cases; the remaining patients had life-limiting intermittent 
claudication. Perioperative mortality occurred in three (0.8%) patients: in the 
hospital (n = 2) due to acute myocardial infarction and after discharge (n = 1) 
due to fatal arrhythmia. Early thromboses occurred in six (1.6%) patients; all 
these patients had primary AKb for critical limb ischemia. The cumulative rate 
of perioperative amputations was 0.5% (2 cases), whereas the cumulative rate of 
early reinterventions was 3% (11 cases). Median duration of follow-up was 
28 months (range, 1-168 months); the median cumulative follow-up index for 
survival was 0.75 (range, 0.05-1). Estimated survival at 5 years was 75.3% 
(standard error [SE], 0.03). Estimated 5-year primary patency was 64% (SE, 
0.04); the corresponding figure in terms of assisted primary patency was 65% 
(SE, 0.035). Secondary patency rate at 5 years was 74.5% (SE, 0.03). The rate of 
limb preservation at 5 years was 95% (SE, 0.02); the corresponding figure in 
terms of amputation-free survival was 74% (SE, 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: In an era of endovascular enthusiasm, with conflicting results for 
the treatment of long or complex lesions of the superficial femoral artery, AKb 
with the use of HB-ePTFE graft remains an effective option, with low rate of 
perioperative complications and satisfactory long-term results.

PURPOSE: The combination of paclitaxel + ramucirumab is a standard second-line 
treatment in patients with advanced gastric cancer. This therapy has been 
associated with increased median overall survival and progression-free survival 
compared with those with paclitaxel monotherapy. We evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of paclitaxel + ramucirumab combination therapy in patients 
with advanced gastric cancer, from the perspective of health care payers in 
Japan.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to compare, over a time horizon of 3 
years, the costs and effectiveness of the combination of paclitaxel + 
ramucirumab and paclitaxel alone as second-line therapies for advanced gastric 
cancer in Japan. Health outcomes were measured in life-years (LYs) and 
quality-adjusted (QA) LYs gained. Costs were calculated using year-2016 Japanese 
yen (¥1 = US $17.79) according to the social insurance reimbursement schedule 
and drug tariff of the fee-for-service system in Japan. Model robustness was 
addressed through 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The costs and 
QALYs were discounted at a rate of 2% per year. The willingness-to-pay threshold 
was set at the World Health Organization's criterion of ¥12 million, because no 
consensus exists regarding the threshold for acceptable cost per QALY ratios in 
Japan's health policy.
FINDINGS: Paclitaxel + ramucirumab combination therapy was estimated to provide 
an additional 0.09 QALYs (0.10 LYs) at a cost of ¥3,870,077, resulting in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ¥43,010,248/QALY. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for the combination therapy was >¥12 million/QALY in 
all of the 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
IMPLICATIONS: Adding ramucirumab to a regimen of paclitaxel in the second-line 
treatment of advanced gastric cancer is expected to provide a minimal 
incremental benefit at a high incremental cost per QALY. Based on our findings, 
adjustments in the price of ramucirumab, as well as improves in other clinical 
parameters such as survival time and adverse event in advanced gastric cancer 
therapy, are needed.

Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) is a 
versatile sequence independent method to probe RNA structure in vivo and in 
vitro. It has so far been tried mainly with model organisms. We show that cells 
of Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan parasite of humans are hyper-sensitive to 
the in vivo SHAPE reagent, NAI, and show rapid loss of viability and RNA 
integrity. We optimized treatment conditions with 5.8S rRNA and Eh_U3 snoRNA to 
obtain NAI-modification while retaining RNA integrity. The modification patterns 
were highly reproducible. The in vivo folding was different from in vitro and 
correlated well with known interactions of 5.8S rRNA with proteins in vivo. The 
Eh_U3 snoRNA also showed many differences in its in vivo versus in vitro 
folding, which correlated with conserved interactions of this RNA with 18S rRNA 
and 5'-ETS. Further, Eh_U3 snoRNA obtained from serum-starved cells showed an 
open 3'-hinge structure, indicating disruption of 5'-ETS interaction. This could 
contribute to the observed slow processing of pre-rRNA in starved cells. Our 
work shows the applicability of SHAPE to study in vivo RNA folding in a parasite 
and will encourage the use of this reagent for RNA structure analysis in other 
such organisms.

Approximately 10 million Pakistan's of population is a victim of Hepatitis C 
virus. A comparative study of two treatments for Hepatitis C being provided in 
private clinics and government hospitals was conducted to evaluate the cost 
effectiveness of these treatments. The quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for 
each treatment plan was determined with the help of health utilities, using 
EQ-5D scores. A comprehensive data collection form aided in scrutinizing the 
cause and effect of each treatment on the patient's quality of life. The total 
sample size for this study is 200 total from the public and private sectors. For 
both the treatment strategies, values for quality adjusted life years (QALYs), 
incremental cost effective ratio (ICER) and cost effective analysis (CEA) were 
calculated. The Hepatitis C virus 3a and 3b genotypic patients who were treated 
with pegylated interferon α-2a and ribavirin combination (strategy 2) showed an 
increased quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of two years, as compared to those 
who received interferon α-2a and ribavirin regimen (strategy 1). An incremental 
cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Rs 144673.5 per quality adjusted life year 
(QALYs) was gained by patients treated with strategy 2. The therapy followed by 
the government sector (strategy 1) is relatively inexpensive accounting for Rs 
654.5/quality adjusted life years (QALY) and therapy provided at the clinic 
sector (strategy 2) is relatively expensive Rs 5620.6/ quality adjusted life 
years (QALY). However, the cost effectiveness analysis for the pegylated 
interferon therapy is quite comparable with the other standard treatments; hence 
it can be called cost effective according to the quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs) gained and efficacy of the said therapy.

The Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Nurse-Family Partnership in the United 
States.

Wu J, Dean KS, Rosen Z, Muennig PA.

We evaluated whether Nurse-Family Partnership might serve as a cost-effective 
social policy for improving health. Using data from studies of randomized 
controlled trials as well as real-world data, we conducted a Monte Carlo 
simulation to estimate cost-effectiveness of Nurse-Family Partnership in a 
hypothetical cohort of first-born children in the United States. Analyses were 
conducted in 2015. Were all new mothers eligible for Nurse-Family Partnership, 
the program would produce 0.11 QALYs (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.06, 0.17) 
at an additional cost of $1,021 (95% CI=-$2,831, $4,414) per nurse-visited 
child's lifetime relative to the comparison-group children or $14,642 (95% CI = 
Savings, $71,877) per QALY gained. However, if applied to high-risk mothers, it 
would generate 0.19 QALYs (95% CI = 0.09, 0.44) and a net benefit of $2,764 (95% 
CI =-$1,210, $7,092) per nurse-visited child. Nurse-Family Partnership should be 
considered as a policy investment, particularly in an era of investments in the 
social determinants of health.

OBJECTIVE: Studies found a strong association between allopurinol-induced 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and the 
HLA-B*58:01 allele. HLA-B*58:01 screening-guided therapy may mitigate the risk 
of allopurinol-induced SJS/TEN. This study aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of HLA-B*58:01 screening before allopurinol therapy 
initiation compared with the current practice of no screening for Malaysian 
patients with chronic gout in whom a hypouricemic agent is indicated.
METHODS: This cost-effectiveness analysis adopted a societal perspective with a 
lifetime horizon. A decision tree model coupled with Markov models were 
developed to estimate the costs and outcomes, represented by quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) gained, of three treatment strategies: (a) current practice 
(allopurinol initiation without HLA-B*58:01 screening); (b) HLA-B*58:01 
screening before allopurinol initiation; and (c) alternative treatment 
(probenecid) without HLA-B*58:01 screening. The model was populated with data 
from literature review, meta-analysis, and published government documents. Cost 
values were adjusted for the year 2016, with costs and health outcomes 
discounted at 3% per annum. A series of sensitivity analysis including 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis were carried out to determine the robustness 
of the findings.
RESULTS: Both HLA-B*58:01 screening and probenecid prescribing were dominated by 
current practice. Compared with current practice, HLA-B*58:01 screening resulted 
in 0.252 QALYs loss per patient at an additional cost of USD 322, whereas 
probenecid prescribing resulted in 1.928 QALYs loss per patient at an additional 
cost of USD 2203. One SJS/TEN case would be avoided for every 556 patients 
screened. At the cost-effectiveness threshold of USD 8695 per QALY, the 
probability of current practice being the best choice is 99.9%, in contrast with 
0.1 and 0% in HLA-B*58:01 screening and probenecid prescribing, respectively. 
This is because of the low incidence of allopurinol-induced SJS/TEN in Malaysia 
and the lower efficacy of probenecid compared with allopurinol in gout control.
CONCLUSION: This analysis showed that HLA-B*58:01 genetic testing before 
allopurinol initiation is unlikely to be a cost-effective intervention in 
Malaysia.

With life expectancy increasing, women will spend one-third of their lives in 
and beyond menopause. A collaborative discussion with the clinician facilitates 
informed decision-making and should include evidence-based discussion of 
physiologic changes, assessment of symptoms and treatment options, review of 
screening recommendations, and discussion of disease risk-reduction strategies 
and psychosocial issues.

Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with earlier onset of age-related 
chronic conditions and reduced life-expectancy, but the underlying biomolecular 
mechanisms remain unclear. Evidence of DNA-methylation differences by SES 
suggests a possible association of SES with epigenetic age acceleration (AA). We 
investigated the association of SES with AA in more than 5,000 individuals 
belonging to three independent prospective cohorts from Italy, Australia, and 
Ireland. Low SES was associated with greater AA (β = 0.99 years; 95% CI 
0.39,1.59; p = 0.002; comparing extreme categories). The results were consistent 
across different SES indicators. The associations were only partially modulated 
by the unhealthy lifestyle habits of individuals with lower SES. Individuals who 
experienced life-course SES improvement had intermediate AA compared to extreme 
SES categories, suggesting reversibility of the effect and supporting the 
relative importance of the early childhood social environment. Socioeconomic 
adversity is associated with accelerated epigenetic aging, implicating 
biomolecular mechanisms that may link SES to age-related diseases and longevity.

The current study investigated whether visual coupling between two people 
producing dance-related movements (requiring whole-body auditory-motor 
coordination) results in interpersonal entrainment and modulates individual 
auditory-motor coordination dynamics. Paired participants performed two kinds of 
coordination tasks - either knee flexion or extension repeatedly with metronome 
beats (Flexion-on-the-beat and Extension-on-the-beat conditions) while standing 
face-to-face or back-to-back to manipulate visual interaction. The results 
indicated that the relative phases between paired participants' movements were 
closer to 0° and less variable when participants could see each other. In 
addition, visibility of the partner reduced individual differences in the 
dynamics of auditory-motor coordination by modulating coordination variability 
and the frequency of phase transitions from Extension-on-the-beat to 
Flexion-on-the-beat. Together, these results indicate that visual coupling takes 
place when paired participants can see each other and leads to interpersonal 
entrainment during rhythmic auditory-motor coordination, which compensates for 
individual differences via behavioural assimilation and thus enables individuals 
to achieve unified and cohesive performances.

Identifying lifestyle strategies and allied neurobiological mechanisms that 
reduce aging-related motor impairment is imperative, given the accelerating 
number of retirees and increased life expectancy. A physically active lifestyle 
prior to old age can reduce risk of debilitating motor decline. However, if 
exercise is initiated after motor decline has begun in the lifespan, it is 
unknown if aging itself may impose a limit on exercise efficacy to decelerate 
further aging-related motor decline. In Brown-Norway/Fischer 344 F1 hybrid (BNF) 
rats, locomotor activity begins to decrease in middle age (12-18 months). One 
mechanism of aging-related motor decline may be decreased expression of GDNF 
family receptor, GFRα-1, which is decreased in substantia nigra (SN) between 12 
and 30 months old. Moderate exercise, beginning at 18 months old, increases 
nigral GFRα-1 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression within 2 months. In aged 
rats, replenishing aging-related loss of GFRα-1 in SN increases TH in SN alone 
and locomotor activity. A moderate exercise regimen was initiated in sedentary 
male BNF rats in a longitudinal study to evaluate if exercise could attenuate 
aging-related motor decline when initiated at two different ages in the latter 
half of the lifespan (18 or 24 months old). Motor decline was reversed in the 
18-, but not 24-month-old, cohort. However, exercise efficacy in the 
18-month-old group was reduced as the rats reached 27 months old. GFRα-1 
expression was not increased in either cohort. These studies suggest exercise 
can decelerate motor decline when begun in the latter half of the lifespan, but
