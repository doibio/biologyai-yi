Comment in
    JAMA Pediatr. 2016 Mar;170(3):195-7.

IMPORTANCE: The literature focuses on mortality among children younger than 5 
years. Comparable information on nonfatal health outcomes among these children 
and the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among older children 
and adolescents is scarce.
OBJECTIVE: To determine levels and trends in the fatal and nonfatal burden of 
diseases and injuries among younger children (aged <5 years), older children 
(aged 5-9 years), and adolescents (aged 10-19 years) between 1990 and 2013 in 
188 countries from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: Data from vital registration, verbal autopsy studies, maternal 
and child death surveillance, and other sources covering 14,244 site-years (ie, 
years of cause of death data by geography) from 1980 through 2013 were used to 
estimate cause-specific mortality. Data from 35,620 epidemiological sources were 
used to estimate the prevalence of the diseases and sequelae in the GBD 2013 
study. Cause-specific mortality for most causes was estimated using the Cause of 
Death Ensemble Model strategy. For some infectious diseases (eg, HIV 
infection/AIDS, measles, hepatitis B) where the disease process is complex or 
the cause of death data were insufficient or unavailable, we used natural 
history models. For most nonfatal health outcomes, DisMod-MR 2.0, a Bayesian 
metaregression tool, was used to meta-analyze the epidemiological data to 
generate prevalence estimates.
FINDINGS: Of the 7.7 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 7.4-8.1) million deaths 
among children and adolescents globally in 2013, 6.28 million occurred among 
younger children, 0.48 million among older children, and 0.97 million among 
adolescents. In 2013, the leading causes of death were lower respiratory tract 
infections among younger children (905.059 deaths; 95% UI, 810,304-998,125), 
diarrheal diseases among older children (38,325 deaths; 95% UI, 30,365-47,678), 
and road injuries among adolescents (115,186 deaths; 95% UI, 105,185-124,870). 
Iron deficiency anemia was the leading cause of years lived with disability 
among children and adolescents, affecting 619 (95% UI, 618-621) million in 2013. 
Large between-country variations exist in mortality from leading causes among 
children and adolescents. Countries with rapid declines in all-cause mortality 
between 1990 and 2013 also experienced large declines in most leading causes of 
death, whereas countries with the slowest declines had stagnant or increasing 
trends in the leading causes of death. In 2013, Nigeria had a 12% global share 
of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections and a 38% global share of 
deaths from malaria. India had 33% of the world's deaths from neonatal 
encephalopathy. Half of the world's diarrheal deaths among children and 
adolescents occurred in just 5 countries: India, Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Ethiopia.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Understanding the levels and trends of the leading 
causes of death and disability among children and adolescents is critical to 
guide investment and inform policies. Monitoring these trends over time is also 
key to understanding where interventions are having an impact. Proven 
interventions exist to prevent or treat the leading causes of unnecessary death 
and disability among children and adolescents. The findings presented here show 
that these are underused and give guidance to policy makers in countries where 
more attention is needed.

By employing a novel semi-parametric extrapolation method, the life expectancies 
after the first hospitalization for schizophrenia and the associated lifetime 
healthcare expenditures were both estimated. Based on the linkage between the 
National Health Insurance Research Database and the National Mortality Registry 
of Taiwan, we have established a schizophrenic cohort for 2000-2010 and followed 
up to 2011. Survival function was estimated through Kaplan-Meier's method and 
extrapolated throughout life. We applied a simple linear regression to the 
logit-transformed survival ratio between the schizophrenic cohort and the sex-, 
age-matched referents via Monte Carlo simulation from the national life table. 
The monthly survival probability was multiplied by the average healthcare 
expenditures and summed throughout life to estimate the lifelong cost reimbursed 
by the National Health Insurance. The results showed that patients diagnosed at 
age 20-29 had the highest expected years of life lost (EYLL), 15 and 9years, in 
men and women, respectively, with corresponding lifetime healthcare expenditures 
of USD 48,000 and 53,000. Males generally had higher health cost per life-year 
than their female counterparts across their lifespan. We applied the same method 
to the first 6years of the cohort and extrapolated to 12years, which showed that 
the relative biases for different age strata were less than 5%. We thus 
concluded that the semi-parametric extrapolation method might provide a timely 
estimation of lifetime outcomes for health care planning of schizophrenia.

Cost-effectiveness of the 'Walcheren Integrated Care Model' intervention for 
community-dwelling frail elderly.

BACKGROUND: An important aim of integrated care for frail elderly is to generate 
more cost-effective health care. However, empirical research on the 
cost-effectiveness of integrated care for community-dwelling frail elderly is 
limited.
OBJECTIVE: This study reports on the cost-effectiveness of the Walcheren 
Integrated Care Model (WICM) after 12 months from a societal perspective.
METHODS: The design of this study was quasi-experimental. In total, 184 frail 
elderly patients from 3 GP practices that implemented the WICM were compared 
with 193 frail elderly patients of 5 GP practices that provided care as usual. 
Effects were determined by health-related quality of life (EQ-5D questionnaire). 
Costs were assessed based on questionnaires, GP files, time registrations and 
reports from multidisciplinary meetings. Average costs and effects were compared 
using t-tests. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated, 
and bootstrap methods were used to determine its reliability.
RESULTS: Neither the WICM nor care as usual resulted in a change in 
health-related quality of life. The average total costs of the WICM were higher 
than care as usual (17089 euros versus 15189 euros). The incremental effects 
were 0.00, whereas the incremental costs were 1970 euros, indicating an ICER of 
412450 euros.
CONCLUSIONS: The WICM is not cost-effective, and the costs per quality-adjusted 
life year are high. The costs of the integrated care intervention do not 
outweigh the limited effects on health-related quality of life after 12 months. 
More analyses of the cost-effectiveness of integrated care for 
community-dwelling frail elderly are recommended as well as consideration of the 
specific costs and effects.

Elective root replacement in Marfan syndrome has improved life expectancy in 
affected patients. Three forms of surgery are now available: total root 
replacement (TRR) with a valved conduit, valve sparing root replacement (VSRR) 
and personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) with a macroporous mesh 
sleeve. TRR can be performed irrespective of aortic dimensions and a mechanical 
replacement valve is a secure and near certain means of correcting aortic valve 
regurgitation but has thromboembolic and bleeding risks. VSRR offers freedom 
from anticoagulation and attendant risks of bleeding but reoperation for aortic 
regurgitation runs at 1.3% per annum. A prospective multi-institutional study 
has found this to be an underestimate of the true rate of valve-related adverse 
events. PEARS conserves the aortic root anatomy and optimises the chance of 
maintaining valve function but average follow-up is under 5 years and so the 
long-term results are yet to be determined. Patients are on average in their 30s 
and so the cumulative lifetime need for reoperation, and of any valve-related 
complications, are consequently substantial. With lowering surgical risk of 
prophylactic root replacement, the threshold for intervention has reduced 
progressively over 30 years to 4.5 cm and so an increasing number of patients 
who are not destined to have a dissection are now having root replacement. In 
evaluation of these three forms of surgery, the number needed to treat to 
prevent dissection and the balance of net benefit and harm in future patients 
must be considered.

BACKGROUND: Volunteering has been linked to reduced mortality in older adults, 
but the mechanisms explaining this effect remain unclear. This study 
investigated whether volunteering is associated with increased survival in 
participants of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and whether differences 
in survival are modified by functional disabilities.
METHODS: A multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards model was used to estimate the 
association of volunteering with survival over a period of 10.9 years in 10 324 
participants, while controlling for selected confounders. To investigate effect 
modification by disability, the analyses were repeated in participants with and 
without self-reported functional disabilities.
RESULTS: Volunteering was associated with a reduced probability of death from 
all causes in univariate analyses (HR=0.65, CI 0.58 to 0.73, p<0.0001), but 
adjustment for covariates rendered this association non-significant (HR=0.90, CI 
0.79 to 1.01, p=0.07). Able-bodied volunteers had significantly increased 
survival compared with able-bodied non-volunteers (HR=0.81, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.95, 
p=0.009). There was no significant survival advantage among disabled volunteers, 
compared with disabled non-volunteers (HR=1.06, CI 0.88 to 1.29, p=0.53).
CONCLUSIONS: Volunteering is associated with reduced mortality in older adults 
in England, but this effect appears to be limited to volunteers who report no 
disabilities.

Osteoarthritis is one of the most common joint disorder. For treatment of hip 
symptomatic osteoarthritis, when conservative medical therapy has failed, total 
hip arthroplasty (THA) is a successful orthopaedic procedures that reduces pain 
and improves function and quality of life. Incidence of osteoarthritis is 
constantly increasing with raising life expectancy. This aging process also has 
led to an increasing number of patients with osteoporosis who need hip 
replacement for osteoarthritis. Osteoporosis have 3 major potential 
complications in total hip arthroplasty: perioperative fracture, an increased 
risk of periprosthetic fracture, and late aseptic loosening. The purpose of the 
present study was to examine the effects of osteoporosis on total hip 
replacement procedure outcome and highlight the importance of adequate study of 
calcium-phosphorus metabolism in patient candidate for hip surgery, and the need 
to start a suitable therapy to recover the bone mass before surgery. Bone 
quality of the hip joint has become an important risk factor limiting the 
durability of THA.

OBJECTIVES: Medical and life-style factors are associated with malnutrition in 
older adults. This study assessed the presence of these risk factors in 
limited-resource, community-dwelling older adults to inform the development of a 
nutrition education interventions.
DESIGN: Quantitative descriptive study.
SETTING: A total of 24 randomly selected congregate nutrition sites (where 
limited-resource older adults can receive one hot meal/day, five days/week) in 
the rural state of South Carolina, USA.
PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from 477 older adults (of the 407 who reported 
race, 219 were African American and 171 were White).
MEASUREMENTS: Extension Educators who work for the Cooperative Extension Service 
(a formalized educational outreach system associated with some U.S. 
universities) read aloud a 27-item instrument designed to assess risk factors 
for malnutrition. Response frequencies were tabulated and chi-square tests were 
performed using SAS 9.3.
RESULTS: More African Americans reported having a chronic illness or condition 
(81.2 vs. 68.3%; p=0.003), eating alone (66.2 vs. 53.6%; p=0.012), having a 
refrigerator that sometimes did not keep food cold (31.8 vs. 8.4%; p<0.0001), 
and sometimes not having enough money to buy food (38.9 vs. 18.5%; p<0.0001) 
compared to White older adults.
CONCLUSION: Rural older adults who attend congregate nutrition sites, especially 
African Americans, could be at risk for malnutrition due to health status and 
food preparation-related factors. Evidence-based, tailored programs are needed 
to minimize malnutrition among limited-resource older adults living in rural 
areas in the U.S.

Model approach for stress induced steroidal hormone cascade changes in severe 
mental diseases.

Volko CD, Regidor PA, Rohr UD.

INTRODUCTION: Stress was described by Cushing and Selye as an adaptation to a 
foreign stressor by the anterior pituitary increasing ACTH, which stimulates the 
release of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones. The question is raised 
whether stress can induce additional steroidal hormone cascade changes in severe 
mental diseases (SMD), since stress is the common denominator.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed, where the 
steroidal hormone cascade of patients with SMD was compared to the impact of 
increasing stress on the steroidal hormone cascade (a) in healthy amateur 
marathon runners with no overtraining; (b) in healthy well-trained elite 
soldiers of a ranger training unit in North Norway, who were under extreme 
physical and mental stress, sleep deprivation, and insufficient calories for 1 
week; and, (c) in soldiers suffering from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
schizophrenia (SI), and bipolar disorders (BD).
RESULTS: (a) When physical stress is exposed moderately to healthy men and women 
for 3-5 days, as in the case of amateur marathon runners, only few steroidal 
hormones are altered. A mild reduction in testosterone, cholesterol and 
triglycerides is detected in blood and in saliva, but there was no decrease in 
estradiol. Conversely, there is an increase of the glucocorticoids, aldosterone 
and cortisol. Cellular immunity, but not specific immunity, is reduced for a 
short time in these subjects. (b) These changes are also seen in healthy elite 
soldiers exposed to extreme physical and mental stress but to a somewhat greater 
extent. For instance, the aldosterone is increased by a factor of three. (c) In 
SMD, an irreversible effect on the entire steroidal hormone cascade is detected. 
Hormones at the top of the cascade, such as cholesterol, dehydroepiandrosterone 
(DHEA), aldosterone and other glucocorticoids, are increased. However, 
testosterone and estradiol and their metabolites, and other hormones at the 
lower end of the cascade, seem to be reduced. 1) The rate and extent of 
reduction of the androgen metabolites may cause a decrease of cellular and 
specific immunity which can lead to viral and bacterial infections; joint and 
stomach inflammation; general pain; and allergic reactions. 2) The decrease in 
testosterone, and estradiol in SMD may have detrimental effects in cell repair 
as the estradiol metabolite, 2-methoxy-estradiol (2ME2), helps to transforms 
stem cells into functional cells. As dopamine and 2ME2 are inversely metabolized 
via various forms of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), well-being and 
hypertension may be related. 2ME2 is related to vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF), which regulates blood capillary growth and O2 supply. As reduced 
O2 is a key marker of stress, the increase of glucocorticoids in all forms of 
mental and physical stress cannot counterbalance the reduced 2ME2 in cellular 
and mental stress. The increased cholesterol and triglycerides are related to 
stroke and infarction, contributing to a reduced life expectancy in SMD between 
14 and 20 years. The increase of aldosterone leads to increases in anxiety, 
edema, and lung infections.
DISCUSSION: Increasing mental and physical stress is related to systematic 
deviations in the steroidal hormone cascade in the non-psychotic state, which 
then may cause life threatening co-morbidities in PTSD, SI, and BD.

BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is a major burden on the Australian population in 
terms of health, social and economic costs. Because of this, in 2008, all 
Australian Governments agreed to set targets to reduce prevalence of smoking to 
10 % by 2018 and subsequently introduced several very strong anti-smoking 
measures. On this backdrop, we estimated in 2012-13 the impact of several 
scenarios related to reduction of smoking prevalence to 10 % across the entire 
Australian population and for below specific ages, on improving life expectancy.
METHODS: Using the risk percentiles method the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and 
Lifestyle (AUSDIAB) baseline survey and the Australian Bureau of Statistics 
(ABS) age-sex specific death counts were analyzed.
RESULTS: Amongst men the gains in life expectancy associated with 10 % smoking 
prevalence are generally greater than those of women with average life 
expectancy for men increasing by 0.11 to 0.41 years, and for women by 0.12 to 
0.29 years. These are at best 54 % and 49 % for men and women of the gains 
achieved by complete smoking cessation. The gains plateau for interventions 
targeting those <70 and <80 years. Amongst smokers the potential gains are much 
greater, with an increase in average life expectancy amongst men smokers of 0.43 
to 2.08 years, and 0.73 to 2.05 years amongst women smokers. These are at best 
46 % and 38 % for men and women smokers of the gains achieved by complete 
smoking cessation.
CONCLUSION: The estimated optimum gain in life expectancy is consistent with 
potentially moderate gains which occur when both men and women below 60 years 
are targeted to reduce smoking prevalence to 10 %.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictors that reduced the survival time on HIV 
positive TB patients during their first year's anti-TB therapy.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to review 519 TB/HIV co-infection 
patients from an Internet based TB surveillance system. We collected information 
of demography, HIV status, CD4+ lymphocytes count, antiretroviral therapy (ART), 
sputum smear results of diagnosis and around 2 months' initiation of anti-TB 
therapy, et al. Wilconxon rank sum test was used to compare the difference of 
age and CD4+ lymphocytes, count and Cox Uni-variable, and Multi-variable 
analysis were used to compare the different distribution of rest of risk 
elements between the groups of death and survival; survival function also has 
been used to evaluate the top 4 risk elements that have made negative impact on 
the survival time of HIV positive TB patients during their first year's anti-TB 
therapy.
RESULTS: Among 519 TB/HIV patients, 84 (16.18%) were dead, 435 (83.82%) 
survived. Median age (P50 (P25-P75)) in survival was 51.0 (41.0-65.0), while in 
death was 45.0 (35.0-60.0) (U=-2.68, P=0.007). There was significant difference 
between survival and death. Median CD4+ lymphocyte count in survival and death 
(P50 (P25-P75)) were 69.00 (26.00-131.20) and 114.50 (35.00-245.00), 
respectively, significant difference also has been observed. Based on the Cox 
analysis, patients with less than 2 months' intensive anti-TB therapy, poor 
treatment adherence, less than 4 months continue anti-TB therapy and sputum 
smear positive around 2 months initiation of anti-TB therapy had higher risk of 
death, the Relative Risk value (RR) were 1 100.40 (95% CI: 105.62-11,470.00), 
52.91 (95% CI: 27.42-102.13), 49.43 (95% CI: 6.38-382.81), and 15.83 (95% CI: 
2.55-98.40), respectively. Log-rank test results showed that there were 
significant difference between survival and death groups with anti-TB intensive 
therapy duration (Log-Rank value was 236.0, P<0.001), adherence (Log-Rank value 
was 302.9, P<0.001), and sputum smear results around 2 months' anti-TB 
initiation (Log-Rank value was 7.55, P=0.006).
CONCLUSION: Known HIV positive, less CD4+ lymphocyte count, not initiation of 
ART, sputum smear positive, around 2 months' initiation of anti-TB therapy, not 
enough anti-TB therapy duration of intensive and continue period and poor 
treatment adherence were the predictors of death of HIV positive TB patients in 
the first year's anti-TB therapy.

Trends in Life Expectancy and Lifespan Variation by Educational Attainment: 
United States, 1990-2010.

The educational gradient in life expectancy is well documented in the United 
States and in other low-mortality countries. Highly educated Americans, on 
average, live longer than their low-educated counterparts, who have recently 
seen declines in adult life expectancy. However, limiting the discussion on 
lifespan inequality to mean differences alone overlooks other dimensions of 
inequality and particularly disparities in lifespan variation. The latter 
represents a unique form of inequality, with higher variation translating into 
greater uncertainty in the time of death from an individual standpoint, and 
higher group heterogeneity from a population perspective. Using data from the 
National Vital Statistics System from 1990 to 2010, this is the first study to 
document trends in both life expectancy and S25--the standard deviation of age 
at death above 25--by educational attainment. Among low-educated whites, adult 
life expectancy declined by 3.1 years for women and by 0.6 years for men. At the 
same time, S25 increased by about 1.5 years among high school-educated whites of 
both genders, becoming an increasingly important component of total lifespan 
inequality. By contrast, college-educated whites benefited from rising life 
expectancy and record low variation in age at death, consistent with the 
shifting mortality scenario. Among blacks, adult life expectancy increased, and 
S25 plateaued or declined in nearly all educational attainment groups, although 
blacks generally lagged behind whites of the same gender on both measures. 
Documenting trends in lifespan variation can therefore improve our understanding 
of lifespan inequality and point to diverging trajectories in adult mortality 
across socioeconomic strata.

INTRODUCTION: All-cause mortality in patients after repair of aortic aneurysms 
of the descending thoracic aorta thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is 
relatively high at mid-term follow-up. The aim of this study was to derive and 
validate a system that could predict all-cause mortality after TEVAR to aid with 
patient selection.
METHODS: The MOTHER database contained 625 patients that underwent elective 
surgery for descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. Univariate analysis identified 
preoperative factors associated with mid-term all-cause mortality, and a Cox 
proportional hazards model was developed. The model was internally validated 
using Kaplan-Meier comparison of observed vs predicted mortality. External 
validation was performed using a data set from the University of Florida College 
of Medicine.
RESULTS: There were 625 patients that underwent TEVAR for descending thoracic 
aortic aneurysm in the MOTHER database and 231 in the University of Florida 
College of Medicine validation set. The mid-term mortality rate at 6 years of 
follow-up was 34.4% and 34%, respectively. The all-cause mortality risk score 
was calculated using 0.0398 × (age) + 0.516 × (renal insufficiency) + 0.46 × 
(previous cerebrovascular disease) + 0.352 × (prior tobacco use) + 0.376 × 
(number of devices >2) + 0.016 × (maximum aneurysm diameter). Using this score, 
low-, medium-, and high-risk groups were defined, with predicted survival at 5 
years of 80%, 60%, and 40%. Patients at high risk of mid-term all-cause death 
were identified in the validation cohort using the prediction rule.
CONCLUSIONS: Identifying patients with a limited life expectancy after TEVAR is 
possible using a preoperative risk-stratification system. This information can 
be used to inform decision making regarding when and whether to proceed with 
TEVAR.

BACKGROUND: A majority of patients prefer to die at home. Specialist palliative 
care aims to improve quality of life. Hospice assist at home is a Dutch model of 
general/specialised palliative care within primary care, collaboratively built 
by general practitioners and a hospice.
AIM: The aims of this study are to explore whether hospice assist at home 
service enables patients at hometo express end-of-life preferences and die in 
their preferred location. In addition, this study provides insight into 
symptomburden, stability and early referral.
DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional evaluation study was performed (December 
2014-March 2015), using hospice assist at home patient records and 
documentation. Primary outcome includes congruence between preferred and actual 
place of death. Secondary outcomes include symptom burden, (in)stability and 
early identification.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Between June 2012 and December 2014, 130 hospice assist at 
home patients, living at home with a life expectancy <1 year, were enrolled. 
Hospice assist at home, a collaboration between general practitioners, district 
nurses, trained volunteers and a hospice team, facilitates (1) general 
practitioner-initiated consultation by Nurse Consultant Hospice, (2) fortnightly 
interdisciplinary consultations and (3) 24/7 hospice backup for patients, 
caregivers and professionals.
RESULTS: A total of 130 patients (62 (48%) men; mean age, 72 years) were 
enrolled, of whom 107/130 (82%) died and 5 dropped out. Preferred place of death 
was known for 101/107 (94%) patients of whom 91% patients died at their 
preferred place of death.
CONCLUSION: Hospice assist at home service supports patients to die in their 
preferred place of death. Shared responsibility of proactive care in primary 
care collaboration enabled patients to express preferences. Hospice care should 
focus on local teamwork, to contribute to shared responsibilities in providing 
optimal palliative care.

Screening and appropriate treatment for osteoporosis has been proven to be 
cost-effective in many populations; however, it is not clear in the Chinese 
population. Simulations using a validated health economics model suggest that 
screening for osteoporosis in Chinese women is cost-effective and may even be 
cost-saving in Chinese post-menopausal women.
INTRODUCTION: This study aimed at determining the cost-effectiveness of 
osteoporosis screening strategies in post-menopausal Chinese women.
METHODS: A validated state-transition microsimulation model with a lifetime 
horizon was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different screening 
strategies with treatment of alendronate compared with current osteoporosis 
management in China. Osteoporosis screening strategies assessed were (1) 
universal screening with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) alone; (2) 
Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA) + DXA; and (3) quantitative 
ultrasound (QUS) + DXA with rescreening at 2, 5 or 10-year intervals for 
patients screened negative by DXA. The study was performed from the Chinese 
healthcare payer's perspective. All model inputs were retrieved from publically 
available literature. Uncertainties were addressed by one-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Screening strategies all improved clinical outcomes at increased costs, 
and each were cost-effective compared with no screening in women aged 55 years 
given the Chinese willingness-to-pay threshold of USD 20,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Pre-screening with QUS and subsequent 
DXA screening if the QUS T-score ≤ -0.5 with a 2-year rescreening interval was 
the most cost-effective strategy with the highest probability of being 
cost-effective across all non-dominated strategies. Screening strategies were 
cost-saving if screenings were initiated from age 65 years. One-way sensitivity 
analyses indicated that the results were robust.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-screening with QUS with subsequent DXA screening if the QUS 
T-score ≤ -0.5 with a 2-year rescreening interval in the Chinese women starting 
at age 55 is the most cost-effective. In addition, screening and treatment 
strategies are cost-saving if the screening initiation age is greater than 
65 years.

CONTEXT: Focused echocardiography evaluation in life support (FEEL) for 
emergency and critical caremedicine is an innovative approach to introducing 
limited-in-scope echocardiography in a timely fashion into periresuscitation 
care. FEEL is an advanced life support-conformed concept and a simple procedure 
that can be readily used in shock roomor pre-hospital scenarios as an extension 
of focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST). The subcostal window plays a 
pivotal role in this context, because it can easilybe applied inthesupine 
position, and is usually better than other windows in patients with mechanical 
ventilation or during resuscitation maneuvers. Most information can be obtained 
at a glance.
AIM: As the FAST exam was not developed for implementation in resuscitation or 
cardiac arrest procedures, herewedescribe an accurate and easymethod that allows
