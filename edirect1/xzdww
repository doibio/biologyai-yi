the improvement of cardiac function. The main regeneration activity of CFTs 
protocols is based on bypassing cells and using paracrine factors. In this 
article, we aim to compare various stem cell secretomes, a part of a CFTs 
strategy, to generalize their effective clinical outcomes for patients with 
CVDs. Data for this review article were collected from 70 published articles 
(original, review, randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and case reports/series 
studies done on human and animals) obtained from Cochrane, Science Direct, 
PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier, and Google Scholar) from 2015 to April 2020 using six 
keywords. Full-text/full-length articles, abstract, section of book, chapter, 
and conference papers in English language were included. Studies with 
irrelevant/insufficient/data, or undefined practical methods were excluded. CFTs 
approaches involved in growth factors (GFs); gene-based therapies; microRNAs 
(miRNAs); extracellular vesicles (EVs) [exosomes (EXs) and microvesicles (MVs)]; 
and conditioned media (CM). EXs and CM have shown more remarkable results than 
stem cell therapy (SCT). GF-based therapies have useful results as well as side 
effects like pathologic angiogenesis. Cell source, cell's aging and CM affect 
secretomes. Genetic manipulation of stem cells can change the secretome's 
components. Growing progression to end stage heart failure (HF), propounds CFTs 
as an advantageous method with practical and clinical values for replacement of 
injured myocardium, and induction of neovascularization. To elucidate the 
secrets behind amplifying the expansion rate of cells, increasing 
life-expectancy, and improving quality of life (QOL) for patients with ischemic 
heart diseases (IHDs), collaboration among cell biologist, basic medical 
scientists, and cardiologists is highly recommended.

Aim: Due to the high price of pembrolizumab, it is still unknown whether the use 
of pembrolizumab for advanced esophageal cancer would be a cost-effective option 
for patients whose PD-L1 combined positive score is ≥10. Methods: A Markov 
simulation model was performed based on clinical trial KEYNOTE-181. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to compare the two treatments. 
Results: The total costs were US$193,575.60 and $8789.24 for pembrolizumab and 
chemotherapy treatment, respectively. The pembrolizumab group produced 0.93 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), while the chemotherapy group produced 0.58 
QALYs. Thus, patients in the pembrolizumab group spent an additional 
US$184,786.36 and produced 0.35 QALYs more than the chemotherapy group, which 
resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$527,961.03 per QALY. 
Conclusion: For patients with advanced esophageal cancer whose PD-L1 combined 
positive score is ≥10, pembrolizumab is not a cost-effective second-line therapy 
versus chemotherapy from the US payer perspective.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is believed to be the most common type of dementia. 
Even though screening for AD has been discussed widely, there is no screening 
program implemented as part of a policy in any country. Current medical research 
motivates focusing on the preclinical stages of the disease in a modeling 
initiative. We develop a partially observable Markov decision process model to 
determine optimal screening programs. The model contains disease free and 
preclinical AD partially observable states and the screening decision is taken 
while an individual is in one of those states. An observable diagnosed 
preclinical AD state is integrated along with observable mild cognitive 
impairment, AD and death states. Transition probabilities among states are 
estimated using data from Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (KADRC) and 
relevant literature. With an objective of maximizing expected total 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), the output of the model is an optimal 
screening program that specifies at what points in time an individual over 50 
years of age with a given risk of AD will be directed to undergo screening. The 
screening test used to diagnose preclinical AD has a positive disutility, is 
imperfect and its sensitivity and specificity are estimated using the KADRC data 
set. We study the impact of a potential intervention with a parameterized 
effectiveness and disutility on model outcomes for three different risk profiles 
(low, medium and high). When intervention effectiveness and disutility are at 
their best, the optimal screening policy is to screen every year between ages 50 
and 95, with an overall QALY gain of 0.94, 1.9 and 2.9 for low, medium and high 
risk profiles, respectively. As intervention effectiveness diminishes and/or its 
disutility increases, the optimal policy changes to sporadic screening and then 
to never screening. Under several scenarios, some screening within the time 
horizon is optimal from a QALY perspective. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of 
costs reveals that implementing these policies are either cost-saving or 
cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: An ample literature documents the growing prevalence of dementia and 
associated costs. Less attention has been paid to decreased dementia incidence 
in some countries.
METHODS: We analyzed trends in age-standardized dementia, stroke, and ischemic 
heart disease (the triple threat) incidence rates and population attributable 
fraction of death and disability attributable to 12 risk factors in 204 
countries and territories and 51 regions using Global Burden of Disease 2019 
data.
RESULTS: During 1990 to 2019, dementia incidence declined in 71 countries; 18 
showed statistically significant declines, ranging from -12.1% (95% uncertainty 
intervals -16.9 to -6.8) to -2.4% (-4.6 to -0.5). During 2010 to 2019, 16 
countries showed non-significant declines. Globally, the burden of the triple 
threat attributable to air pollution, dietary risks, non-optimal temperature, 
lead exposure, and tobacco use decreased from 1990 to 2019.
CONCLUSION: The declining incidence of dementia in some countries, despite 
growing prevalence, is encouraging and urges further investigation.

Reductions in US life expectancy during the COVID-19 pandemic by race and 
ethnicity: Is 2021 a repetition of 2020?

Update of
    medRxiv. 2022 Jul 19;:

COVID-19 had a huge mortality impact in the US in 2020 and accounted for most of 
the overall reduction in 2020 life expectancy at birth. There were also 
extensive racial/ethnic disparities in the mortality impact of COVID-19 in 2020, 
with the Black and Latino populations experiencing reductions in life expectancy 
at birth over twice as large as that of the White population. Despite continued 
vulnerability of these populations, the hope was that widespread distribution of 
effective vaccines would mitigate the overall mortality impact and reduce 
racial/ethnic disparities in 2021. In this study, we quantify the mortality 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 2021 US period life expectancy by race and 
ethnicity and compare these impacts to those estimated for 2020. Our estimates 
indicate that racial/ethnic disparities have persisted, and that the US 
population experienced a decline in life expectancy at birth in 2021 of 2.2 
years from 2019, 0.6 years more than estimated for 2020. The corresponding 
reductions estimated for the Black and Latino populations are slightly below 
twice that for Whites, suggesting smaller disparities than those in 2020. 
However, all groups experienced additional reductions in life expectancy at 
birth relative to 2020, and this apparent narrowing of disparities is primarily 
the result of Whites experiencing proportionately greater increases in mortality 
in 2021 compared with the corresponding increases in mortality for the Black and 
Latino populations in 2021. Estimated declines in life expectancy at age 65 
increased slightly for Whites between 2020 and 2021 but decreased for both the 
Black and Latino populations, resulting in the same overall reduction (0.8 
years) estimated for 2020 and 2021.

The extension of the human lifespan has led to an increase in the proportion of 
the elderly population worldwide. This situation has also brought the issue of 
healthy aging to the agenda. The importance of more active participation of 
elderly individuals in life in the development of health is increasing. 
Depression and self-efficacy of the elderly people are primarily addressed to 
support this situation. This study is a randomized controlled intervention study 
in which evaluating the change in depression and self-efficacy levels of elderly 
individuals after the empowerment intervention. In the study, which was 
conducted to improve elderly individuals' depression and self-efficacy levels, 
an empowerment intervention consisting of 7 sessions was applied to these 
individuals. In the sessions, practices were carried out to increase the 
functionality of the elderly in cognitive, social, emotional, physical and 
spiritual areas. In this study, 60 elderly individuals (intervention and control 
groups) who were hospitalized for physical therapy and rehabilitation in a state 
hospital in Turkey between September 2019 and December 2020 were included. The 
simple random sampling method was used for sampling. The sample size was 
determined by G Power analysis. Geriatric depression and self-efficacy scales 
were used in the study. The study data were analyzed on the IBM SPSS Statistics 
25.0 software package. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate descriptive 
data. Pearson, Chi-Square, and Fisher Exact tests were used to compare the 
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the participants. Paired 
Samples t-test was used to compare the intervention and the control groups' 
pretest and posttest scores. In the study, it was determined that the mean 
geriatric depression pretest score was 15.43 ± 7.05 in the control group and 
14.46 ± 7.21 in the intervention group, and there was no significant difference 
between the groups' geriatric depression pretest scores (p = .602). However, it 
was determined that the mean geriatric depression posttest score was 
13.50 ± 9.02 in the control group and 9.23 ± 6.71 in the intervention group, and 
there was a significant difference between the posttest scores of the groups (p 
= .042). No significant difference was found between the pretest and posttest 
geriatric depression scale scores of the control group (t = 1.346; p = .189). 
The posttest geriatric depression score of the intervention group was 
significantly lower than the pretest score (t = 5.966; p = .0001). In the study, 
it was determined that the mean self-efficacy pretest score was 79.63 ± 12.62 in 
the control group, 75.63 ± 14.20 in the intervention group, and there was no 
significant difference between the pretest scores of the groups (p = .254). It 
was determined that the mean self-efficacy posttest score was 83.10 ± 11.35 in 
the control group and 84.50 ± 14.41 in the intervention group, and there was no 
significant difference between the posttest scores of the groups (p = .678). The 
posttest self-efficacy score of the intervention group was found to be 
significantly higher than the pretest score (p = .001). The empowerment 
intervention was determined to decrease the elderly individuals' depression and 
increase their self-efficacy levels.

INTRODUCTION: This study introduces the first German Open Scale of Social 
Information Processing (GOSSIP) and evaluates its psychometric properties. Even 
though social information processing (SIP) and its important role in 
developmental psychopathology is a rising field of interest, model-based 
standardized assessment tools are still scarce.
METHODS: GOSSIP was developed to assess SI processes in boys and girls aged 
eight to 21 years. First, 61 vignettes (combinations of pictures and short 
written descriptions of the situation depicted) were evaluated by an expert 
group and piloted with 48 healthy participants (aged 8-21). The best-rated 
vignettes were then implemented in a Web-based application. 191 participants 
completed GOSSIP. Of those, 76 answered additional questionnaires to assess 
their social skills and psychopathology. Internal consistencies for the 
emotional and cognitive GOSSIP scales were determined. Latent profile analysis 
(LPA) was used to identify subgroups of children and adolescents characterized 
by specific SIP profiles (i.e., patterns of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral 
responses to the GOSSIP). Furthermore, the external validity of the 
participants' attribution tendencies in GOSSIP was evaluated in real life by 
smartphone-based Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA).
RESULTS: The internal consistencies for the emotional and cognitive scales 
(angry, ashamed, physical aggression, pro-social response, revenge, and outcome 
expectancy) were good to excellent. The scales of hostile interpretation, 
relation aggression, sadness, and exclusion showed borderline/acceptable 
internal consistency. Correlation analysis confirmed convergent validity with 
self-reported social skills and external validity with ratings of aggressive and 
pro-social behaviors. The LPA revealed three profiles as the best fit of the 
data. The first group is named "aggressors," the second "social-emotional 
group," and a third named "ashamed-internalizing group." However, no significant 
association was found between the attribution tendencies derived from GOSSIP and 
EMA data.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: GOSSIP is the first model-based German Web-based 
assessment for several SIP mechanisms that showed overall adequate psychometric 
properties. GOSSIP can be used to classify individuals into SIP profiles that 
differ in terms of their cognitive and emotional response tendencies and 
therefore could contribute to the development of targeted interventions. 
Integrating assessments of emotional responses into GOSSIP revealed an important 
role of "shame" in SIP and the development of psychopathology. Furthermore, the 
lack of external validity between GOSSIP and EMA calls into question how 
attribution tendencies are best assessed in future studies.

BACKGROUND: We assessed quality of life (QoL) of patients undergoing surgery for 
proximal femur fracture and performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of 
haemostatic drugs for reducing postoperative bleeding.
METHODS: We analysed data from an open, multicentre, parallel, randomized 
controlled clinical trial (RCT) that assessed the efficacy and safety of 
tranexamic acid (TXA group) and fibrin glue (FG group) administered topically 
prior to surgical closure, compared with usual haemostasis methods (control 
group). For this study we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of these 
interventions from the Spanish Health System perspective, using a time horizon 
of 12 months. The cost was reported in $US purchasing power parity (USPPP). We 
calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY 
(quality-adjusted life-year).
RESULTS: We included 134 consecutive patients from February 2013 to March 2015: 
42 patients in the TXA group, 46 in the FG group, and 46 in the control group. 
Before the fracture, EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) health questionnaire 
score was 68.6. During the 12 months post-surgery, the intragroup EQ-VAS 
improved, but without reaching pre-fracture values. There were no differences 
between groups for EQ-VAS and EuroQol 5 dimensions 5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) health 
questionnaire score, nor in hospital stay costs or medical complication costs. 
Nevertheless, the cost of one FG treatment was significantly higher (399.1 
$USPPP) than the cost of TXA (12.9 $USPPP) or usual haemostasis (0 $USPPP). When 
comparing the cost-effectiveness of the interventions, FG was ruled out by 
simple dominance since it was more costly (13,314.7 $USPPP) than TXA (13,295.2 
$USPPP) and less effective (utilities of 0.0532 vs. 0.0734, respectively). TXA 
compared to usual haemostasis had an ICER of 15,289.6 $USPPP per QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences between the intervention 
groups in terms of postoperative changes in QoL. However, topical TXA was more 
cost-effective than FG or usual haemostasis.

Objectives: Low education and unhealthy lifestyle factors such as obesity, 
smoking, and no exercise are modifiable risk factors for disability and 
premature mortality. We aimed to estimate the individual and joint impact of 
these factors on disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and total life 
expectancy (TLE). Methods: Data (n = 22,304) were from two birth cohorts 
(1921-26 and 1946-51) of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health and 
linked National Death Index between 1996 and 2016. Discrete-time multi-state 
Markov models were used to assess the impact on DFLE and TLE. Results: Compared 
to the most favourable combination of education and lifestyle factors, the least 
favourable combination (low education, obesity, current/past smoker, and no 
exercise) was associated with a loss of 5.0 years TLE, 95% confidence interval 
(95%CI): 3.2-6.8 and 6.4 years DFLE (95%CI: 4.8-7.8) at age 70 in the 1921-26 
cohort. Corresponding losses in the 1946-51 cohort almost doubled (TLE: 
11.0 years and DFLE: 13.0 years). Conclusion: Individual or co-ocurrance of 
lifestyle risk factors were associated with a significant loss of DFLE, with a 
greater loss in low-educated women and those in the 1946-51 cohort.

Due to life-threatening complications, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is 
the most severe form of EDS. Because the syndrome is associated with a shortened 
life expectancy and variable clinical presentation, diagnosis confirmed by 
genetic testing is crucial to determining appropriate treatment. Despite some 
distinguishing features, this rare disease often goes unrecognized. Apart from 
surgical or endovascular treatment of serious vascular complications, medical 
treatment based on celiprolol helps reduce arterial complications. We report on 
a case of vEDS in a young man who suffered several episodes of severe vascular 
complications. The diagnosis of vEDS was established based on clinical 
manifestations and confirmed by genetic testing. A novel heterozygous pathogenic 
variant in the COL3A1 gene was found. To our knowledge, this is the first case 
of vEDS caused by this variant.

PURPOSE: Prostate cancer (PCa) screening can lead to potential 
over-diagnosis/over-treatment of indolent cancers. There is a need to optimize 
practices to better risk-stratify patients. We examined initial longitudinal 
outcomes of mid-life men with an elevated baseline prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) following initiation of a novel screening program within a system-wide 
network.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed our primary care network patients ages 40 to 
49 years with a PSA measured following implementation of an electronic health 
record screening algorithm from 2/2/2017-2/21/2018. The multidisciplinary 
algorithm was developed taking factors including age, race, family history, and 
PSA into consideration to provide a personalized approach to urology referral to 
be used with shared decision-making. Outcomes of men with PSA ≥1.5 ng/mL were 
evaluated through 7/2021. Statistical analyses identified factors associated 
with PCa detection. Clinically significant PCa (csPCa) was defined as Gleason 
Grade Group (GGG) ≥2 or GGG1 with PSA ≥10 ng/mL.
RESULTS: The study cohort contained 564 patients, with 330 (58.5%) referred to 
urology for elevated PSA. Forty-nine (8.7%) underwent biopsy; of these, 20 
(40.8%) returned with PCa. Eleven (2.0% of total cohort and 55% of PCa 
diagnoses) had csPCa. Early referral timing (odds ratio [OR], 4.58) and higher 
PSA (OR, 1.07) were significantly associated with PCa at biopsy on multivariable 
analysis (both p<0.05), while other risk factors were not. Referred patients had 
higher mean PSAs (2.97 vs. 1.98, p=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary outcomes following implementation of a 
multidisciplinary screening algorithm identified PCa in a small, important 
percentage of men in their forties. These results provide insight into baseline 
PSA measurement to provide early risk stratification and detection of csPCa in 
patients with otherwise extended life expectancy. Further follow-up is needed to 
possibly determine the prognostic significance of such mid-life screening and 
optimize primary care physician-urologist coordination.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the trend of disease burden of stroke attributable to 
ambient PM_(2.5) exposure among Chinese residents from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: On the basis of the data of global burden of disease study 2019(GBD 
2019) in China, the burden of stroke attributable to the ambient PM_(2.5) 
exposure in China from 1990 to 2019 were analyzed using the number and rate of 
deaths, disability adjusted life year(DALY), DALY rate and its standardized rate 
and estimated annual percentage change(EAPC).
RESULTS: In 2019, 24.7% of stroke deaths among people aged 15 years and above in 
China were due to ambient PM_(2.5) exposure. Compared with 1990, in China the 
number of stroke deaths and mortality attributable to ambient PM_(2.5) exposure 
increased to 541 800 and 39.08/100 000, respectively in 2019, and the 
attributable DALY and DALY rates increased by 2.07% and 1.56%, respectively, in 
2019. And the attributable DALY and DALY in males were higher than those in 
females, and they were all increasing with aging. The attributed standardized 
mortality and DALY rates in China were higher than those of the global and 
different socio-demographic index(SDI) regions, and showed an increasing trend, 
with EAPCs of 1.11(95% CI 0.47-1.75) and 1.11(95% CI 0.53-1.69), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The burden of stroke disease due to ambient PM_(2.5) exposure is 
heavy in China, with differences in gender and age, and is higher than those of 
the global and different SDI regions.

Mandibular fractures are among the most common fractures in cattle. The medical 
records of 108 cattle with a mandibular fracture, that were referred to the 
University of Zurich Veterinary Hospital from 2005 to 2019, were analysed to 
document the types of treatment, complications and long-term outcomes. Cattle, 
still alive at the time of retrospective analysis, underwent clinical and 
radiographic examinations. A fall was the single most common cause of a 
mandibular fracture (48,1 %), and a third of all cattle had a concomitant 
disease at the time of referral. Seventy-five cattle (69,4 %) had a single 
fracture, 26 (24,1 %) had two fractures and seven (6,5 %) had three fractures of 
the mandible. The molar part of the mandibular body was most commonly (40,7 %) 
fractured followed by the diastema (23,6 %), the pars incisiva (13,4 %), the 
ramus (12,1 %) and the symphysis (10,2 %) of the mandible. The majority of 
cattle (84/108, 77,8 %) had open fractures. Treatment was instituted in 63/108 
animals (58,3 %) with 77/148 fractures. Of these fractures, 28 were treated with 
plate osteosynthesis, 25 with an external fixator, 8 with cerclage wire, 7 using 
mixed techniques, 4 with fragment excision, 4 underwent conservative treatment 
and one a mucosal suture. In total, 45/108 animals (41,7 %) were culled because 
of multiple fractures, concomitant diseases and because of economic reasons. 
Complications occurred in 34 (54,0 %) treated cattle; 22 had abnormal wound 
healing of which 18 developed osteomyelitis complicated by a sequestrum (14). Of 
the treated 63 cattle, 56 (88,9 %) were discharged. The mean postoperative 
productive life was 46 ± 29,2 months for animals that were deceased at the time 
of the study. Thirteen of the cattle with a sequestrum remained in the herd for 
15 to 92 months (mean, 47 months) and one for 2 months. The life expectancy 
after treatment did not differ significantly from that of the Brown Swiss and 
Swiss Holstein dairy cattle populations, where the cattle of this study mainly 
came from. Eleven cattle were available for long-term follow-up; all had a good 
general health status but nine had dental abnormalities including missing teeth, 
steps or enamel points, which did not noticeably affect the body condition of 
the animals. Surgical treatment of selected mandibular fractures had a 
favourable prognosis (52/63 healed, 82,5 %) in cattle.

Publisher: Unterkieferfrakturen zählen zu den häufigsten Knochenbrüchen bei 
Rindern. Mit dem Ziel der Dokumentation von Behandlungstechniken, von 
Komplikationen sowie von Langzeitergebnissen wurden die Krankenakten von 108 
Rindern, welche in den Jahren 2005–2019 aufgrund einer Unterkieferfraktur am 
Tierspital Zürich vorgestellt worden waren, ausgewertet. Bei noch lebenden 
Tieren wurde eine klinische und röntgenologische Spätuntersuchung durchgeführt. 
Die häufigste bekannte Ursache für eine Unterkieferfraktur war ein Sturz (52 
Tiere, 48,1 %). Ein Drittel der Rinder wies bei der Eintrittsuntersuchung 
unterschiedliche Begleiterkrankungen auf. Bei 75 Tieren (69,4 %) war der 
Unterkiefer an einer Lokalisation gebrochen, bei 26 (24,1 %) an zwei und bei 
sieben Tieren (6,5 %) an drei Lokalisationen. Am häufigsten waren die Pars 
molaris (40,7 %) und das Diastema (23,6 %), weniger oft die Pars incisiva 
(13,4 %), der Ramus mandibulae (12,1 %) und die Symphysis mandibulae (10,2 %) 
betroffen. Bei der Mehrheit der Tiere (84/108; 77,8 %) waren offene Frakturen 
festzustellen. Insgesamt wurden 77/148 Frakturen (52,0 %) bei 63/108 Tieren 
(58,3 %) behandelt, und zwar durch Plattenosteosynthese (28), Fixateur externe 
(25), Drahtzerklage (8), gemischte Techniken (7), Fragmentexzision (4), 
konservativ (4) und mittels einer Mukosanaht (1). Aufgrund von 
Mehrfachfrakturen, Begleiterkrankungen und aus ökonomischen Gründen wurden 
45/108 Rindern (41,7 %) eingeschläfert oder geschlachtet. Insgesamt 34/63 
behandelten Rindern (54,0 %) entwickelten eine Komplikation. Bei 22/34 Tieren 
war dies eine Wundheilungsstörung, wovon bei 18 Tieren eine Osteomyelitis mit 
Sequesterbildung (14) auftrat. Von den 63 behandelten Tieren konnten 56 (88,9 %) 
aus der Klinik entlassen werden. Die postoperative Nutzungsdauer betrug bei 45 
zum Untersuchungszeitpunkt bereits abgegangenen Tieren durchschnittlich 46 ± 
29,2 Monate (Mittelwert, Standardabweichung). Tiere, die einen Sequester 
gebildet hatten, blieben, mit einer Ausnahme (2 Monate), noch durchschnittlich 
47 Monate (Mittelwert; Min. 15, Max. 92 Monate) in Nutzung. Die Lebenserwartung 
nach Behandlung von Unterkieferfrakturen unterschied sich nicht signifikant von 
der der Populationen Brown-Swiss- und Holstein-Milchkühe, aus denen die meisten 
der hier angeführten Rinder mit Unterkieferfrakturen stammten. Die 11 Rinder der 
Spätuntersuchungen wiesen alle einen guten Allgemeinzustand auf; neun zeigten 
Gebissfehler, wie fehlende Zähne, Stufen oder Zahnspitzen, jedoch ohne 
erkennbare Beeinträchtigung des Ernährungszustandes. Die chirurgische Behandlung 
von ausgewählten Unterkieferfrakturen bei Rindern (63/108) hatte somit eine 
günstige Prognose (52/63 geheilt, 82,5 %).

Publisher: Les fractures mandibulaires font partie des fractures les plus 
fréquentes chez les bovins. Les dossiers médicaux de 108 bovins présentant une 
fracture mandibulaire, référés à l’hôpital vétérinaire de l’Université de Zurich 
entre 2005 et 2019, ont été analysés afin de documenter les types de traitement, 
les complications et les résultats à long terme. Les bovins, encore vivants au 
moment de l’analyse rétrospective, ont subi des examens cliniques et 
radiographiques. Une chute était la cause la plus fréquente d’une fracture 
mandibulaire (48,1 %), et un tiers des bovins présentaient une maladie 
concomitante au moment de la consultation. Septante-cinq bovins (69,4 %) avaient 
une seule fracture, 26 (24,1 %) avaient deux fractures et sept (6,5 %) avaient 
trois fractures de la mandibule. La partie molaire du corps mandibulaire était 
le plus souvent (40,7 %) fracturée, suivie du diastème (23,6 %), de la pars 
incisiva (13,4 %), du ramus (12,1 %) et de la symphyse (10,2 %) de la mandibule. 
La majorité des bovins (84/108, 77,8 %) présentaient des fractures ouvertes. Un 
traitement a été institué chez 63/108 animaux (58,3 %) avec 77/148 fractures. 
Parmi ces fractures, 28 ont été traitées par une ostéosynthèse par plaque, 25 
par un fixateur externe, 8 par cerclage, 7 par des techniques mixtes, 4 par une 
excision du fragment, 4 par un traitement conservateur et une par une suture 
muqueuse. Au total, 45/108 animaux (41,7 %) ont été abattus en raison de 
fractures multiples, de maladies concomitantes et pour des raisons économiques. 
Des complications sont survenues chez 34 (54,0 %) des bovins traités ; 22 ont 
présenté une cicatrisation anormale dont 18 ont développé une ostéomyélite 
compliquée par un séquestre (14). Sur les 63 bovins traités, 56 (88,9 %) sont 
sortis de clinique. La vie productive postopératoire moyenne était de 46 ± 29,2 
mois pour les animaux qui étaient décédés au moment de l’étude. Treize des 
bovins avec un séquestre sont restés dans le troupeau pendant 15 à 92 mois 
(moyenne, 47 mois) et un pendant 2 mois. L’espérance de vie après traitement ne 
différait pas significativement de celle des populations de vaches laitières 
Brown Swiss et Swiss Holstein d’où provenaient principalement les bovins de 
cette étude. Onze bovins étaient disponibles pour un suivi à long terme ; tous 
avaient un bon état de santé général mais neuf présentaient des anomalies 
dentaires, notamment des dents manquantes, des différences de niveau de la table 
dentaire ou des pointes d’émail, ce qui n’a pas affecté de manière notable 
l’état corporel des animaux. Le traitement chirurgical de certaines fractures 
mandibulaires a donc eu un pronostic favorable (52/63 guéries, 82,5 %) chez les 
bovins.

Publisher: Le fratture mandibolari sono tra le fratture ossee più comuni nei 
bovini. Allo scopo di documentare le tecniche di trattamento, le complicanze e 
gli esiti a lungo termine, sono state analizzate le cartelle cliniche di 108 
bovini presentati all’Ospedale Veterinario di Zurigo per fratture mandibolari 
tra il 2005 e il 2019. Gli animali ancora in vita sono stati sottoposti a esami 
clinici e radiografici tardivi. La causa più comune conosciuta per una frattura 
mandibolare è la caduta (52 animali, 48,1 %). Un terzo dei bovini presentava 
diverse malattie concomitanti all’esame di ingresso. In 75 animali (69,4 %) la 
mandibola era fratturata in un solo sito, in 26 (24,1 %) in due siti e in sette 
animali (6,5 %) in tre siti. Le parti mandibolari più frequentemente colpite 
erano la pars molaris (40,7 %) e il diastema (23,6 %) e meno spesso la pars 
incisiva (13,4 %), il ramus mandibulae (12,1 %) e la symphysis mandibulae 
(10,2 %). La maggior parte degli animali (84/108; 77,8 %) presentava fratture 
aperte. Un totale di 77/148 fratture (52,0 %) in 63/108 animali (58,3 %) sono 
state trattate con osteosintesi a placca (28), fissatore esterno (25), 
cerchiaggio con filo (8), tecniche miste (7), escissione del frammento (4), 
conservativa (4) e via una sutura mucosa (1). A causa di fratture multiple, 
malattie concomitanti e per motivi economici, 45/108 bovini (41,7 %) sono stati 
sottoposti a eutanasia o macellazione. Un totale di 34/63 bovini trattati 
(54,0 %) ha sviluppato una complicazione. In 22/34 animali si è trattato di un 
disturbo nella guarigione della ferita, di cui 18 animali hanno sviluppato 
osteomielite con sequestro (14). Dei 63 animali trattati, 56 (88,9 %) hanno 
potuto essere dimessi dall’ospedale. La durata post-operatoria dei 45 animali 
già dimessi al momento dello studio è stata in media di 46 ± 29,2 mesi (media, 
deviazione standard). Gli animali che avevano formato un sequestro sono stati 
tenuti, con una sola eccezione (2 mesi), in media 47 mesi (media; min. 15, max. 
92 mesi). L’aspettativa di vita dopo il trattamento delle fratture mandibolari 
non è risultata significativamente diversa da quella delle popolazioni di bovini 
da latte Brown-Swiss e Holstein, da cui provengono la maggior parte dei bovini 
con fratture mandibolari qui esaminati. Gli 11 bovini esaminati in ritardo 
mostravano tutti buone condizioni generali; nove presentavano difetti della 
dentizione, come denti mancanti, gradini o punte di denti, ma senza apparente 
compromissione dello stato nutrizionale. Il trattamento chirurgico di fratture 
mandibolari selezionate nei bovini (63/108) ha quindi avuto una prognosi 
favorevole (52/63 guariti, 82,5 %).

OBJECTIVES: Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder and knowledge 
about the cost-effectiveness of potential interventions is limited. The aim of 
this paper is to introduce the Trimbos Institute health economic 
cost-effectiveness model for Anorexia Nervosa (AnoMod-TI), a flexible modeling 
tool for assessing the long-term cost-effectiveness of interventions for AN in 
late adolescent and adult patients, which could support clinical decision 
making.
METHODS: AnoMod-TI is a state-transition cohort simulation (Markov) model 
developed from a Dutch societal perspective, which consists of four health 
states - namely full remission (FR), partial remission (PR), AN and death. 
Results are expressed as total healthcare costs, QALYs and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: For the purpose of demonstrating AnoMod-TI and how it could be used to 
estimate cost-effectiveness over a 20-year time horizon, it was applied to a 
hypothetical treatment scenario. Results illustrate how a relatively costly 
intervention with only modest effects can still be cost-effective in the long 
term.
CONCLUSIONS: AnoMod-TI can be used to examine long-term cost-effectiveness of 
various interventions aimed at either treating AN or preventing relapse from a 
state of partial or full remission. AnoMod-TI is freely available upon request 
to the authors.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017 Apr 20;4:CD002202.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common inherited 
diseases worldwide. It is associated with lifelong morbidity and a reduced life 
expectancy. Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide), an oral chemotherapeutic drug, 
ameliorates some of the clinical problems of SCD, in particular that of pain, by 
raising foetal haemoglobin (HbF). This is an update of a previously published 
Cochrane Review.
OBJECTIVES: The aims of this review are to determine through a review of 
randomised or quasi-randomised studies whether the use of hydroxyurea in people 
with SCD alters the pattern of acute events, including pain; prevents, delays or 
reverses organ dysfunction; alters mortality and quality of life; or is 
associated with adverse effects. In addition, we hoped to assess whether the 
response to hydroxyurea in SCD varies with the type of SCD, age of the 
individual, duration and dose of treatment, and healthcare setting.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders 
Haemoglobinopathies Register, comprising references identified from 
comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals 
and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial 
registries. The date of the most recent search was 17 February 2022.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs and 
quasi-RCTs), of one month or longer, comparing hydroxyurea with placebo or 
standard therapy in people  with SCD.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Authors independently assessed studies for 
inclusion, carried out data extraction, assessed the risk of bias and assessed 
the quality of the evidence using GRADE.
MAIN RESULTS: We included nine RCTs recruiting 1104 adults and children with SCD 
(haemoglobin SS (HbSS), haemoglobin SC (HbSC) or haemoglobin Sβºthalassaemia 
(HbSβºthal) genotypes). Studies lasted from six to 30 months. We judged the 
quality of the evidence for the first two comparisons below as moderate to low 
as the studies contributing to these comparisons were mostly large and 
well-designed (and at low risk of bias); however, the evidence was limited and 
imprecise for some outcomes such as quality of life, deaths during the studies 
and adverse events, and the results are applicable only to individuals with HbSS 
and HbSβºthal genotypes. We judged the quality of the evidence for the third and 
fourth comparisons to be very low due to the limited number of participants, the 
lack of statistical power (both studies were terminated early with approximately 
only 20% of their target sample size recruited) and the lack of applicability to 
all age groups and genotypes. Hydroxyurea versus placebo Five studies (784 
adults and children with HbSS or HbSβºthal) compared hydroxyurea to placebo; 
four recruited individuals with only severe disease and one recruited 
individuals with all disease severities. Hydroxyurea probably improves pain 
alteration (using measures such as pain crisis frequency, duration, intensity, 
hospital admissions and opoid use) and life-threatening illness, but we found no 
difference in death rates (10 deaths occurred during the studies, but the rates 
did not differ by treatment group) (all moderate-quality evidence). Hydroxyurea 
may improve measures of HbF (low-quality evidence) and probably decreases 
neutrophil counts (moderate-quality evidence). There were no consistent 
differences in terms of quality of life and adverse events (including serious or 
life-threatening events) (low-quality evidence). There were fewer occurrences of 
acute chest syndrome and blood transfusions in the hydroxyurea groups.  
Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus transfusion and chelation Two studies (254 
children with HbSS or HbSβºthal also with risk of primary or secondary stroke) 
contributed to this comparison. There were no consistent differences in terms of 
pain alteration, death or adverse events (low-quality evidence) or 
life-threatening illness (moderate-quality evidence). Hydroxyurea with 
phlebotomy probably increased HbF and decreased neutrophil counts 
(moderate-quality evidence), but there were more occurrences of acute chest 
syndrome and infections. Quality of life was not reported. In the primary 
prevention study, no strokes occurred in either treatment group but in the 
secondary prevention study, seven strokes occurred in the hydroxyurea and 
phlebotomy group (none in the transfusion and chelation group) and the study was 
terminated early.  Hydroxyurea versus observation One study (22 children with 
HbSS or HbSβºthal also at risk of stoke) compared hydroxyurea to observation. 
Pain alteration and quality of life were not reported. There were no differences 
in life-threatening illness, death (no deaths reported in either group) or 
adverse events (very low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if hydroxyurea 
improves HbF or decreases neutrophil counts (very low-quality evidence). 
Treatment regimens with and without hydroxyurea One study (44 adults and 
children with HbSC) compared treatment regimens with and without hydroxyurea. 
Pain alteration, life-threatening illness and quality of life were not reported. 
There were no differences in death rates (no deaths reported in either group), 
adverse events or neutrophil levels (very low-quality evidence). We are 
uncertain if hydroxyurea improves HbF (very low-quality evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that hydroxyurea may be 
effective in decreasing the frequency of pain episodes and other acute 
complications in adults and children with sickle cell anaemia of HbSS or 
HbSβºthal genotypes and in preventing life-threatening neurological events in 
those with sickle cell anaemia at risk of primary stroke by maintaining 
transcranial Doppler velocities. However, there is still insufficient evidence 
on the long-term benefits of hydroxyurea, particularly with regard to preventing 
chronic complications of SCD, or recommending a standard dose or dose escalation 
to maximum tolerated dose. There is also insufficient evidence about the 
long-term risks of hydroxyurea, including its effects on fertility and 
reproduction. Evidence is also limited on the effects of hydroxyurea on 
individuals with the HbSC genotype. Future studies should be designed to address 
such uncertainties.

Life expectancy in Western countries is increasing, with concomitant rise in 
ageing-related pathologies, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, as 
well as other neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, the medical, 
psychological and economic burden to society is increasing. Thus, understanding 
the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the association of ageing with 
elevated vulnerability to disease is crucial towards promoting quality of life 
in old age. Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as a versatile model to study 
ageing, due to its simplicity, fast life cycle, and the availability of a wide 
range of biological tools to target specific genes and cells. Indeed, recent 
studies in C. elegans have revealed that lipid metabolism plays a key role in 
controlling longevity by impinging on a plethora of molecular pathways and cell 
types. Here, we summarise findings relevant to the interplay between lipid 
metabolism and ageing in C. elegans, and discuss the implications for the 
pathogenesis of age-related disorders in humans.
