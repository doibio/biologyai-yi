Pharmaceuticals are invaluable tools for the prevention and treatment of human 
and animal diseases. Human evolution led to the increase of life expectancy, 
which promoted the increase of consumption of pharmaceuticals. These compounds 
are consistently detected in superficial waters, and whilst degradation 
processes are expected to mitigate their levels, they also induce the formation 
of potentially harmful by-products. The compounds studied in this work were 
acetaminophen, 17α-ethynylestradiol and carbamazepine. High-performance liquid 
chromatography coupled with ultraviolet diode-array detection was used to follow 
the degradation reactions, whilst liquid chromatography associated with 
ultraviolet diode-array detection and mass spectrometry was applied in the 
determination of by-products. Ethynylestradiol proved to be the most reactive 
(t1/2 = 38.6 ± 1.9 seconds) and carbamazepine the least reactive (t1/2 = 481.4 ± 
16.7 minutes) when exposed to active chlorine. In relation to disinfection 
by-products, two monochlorinated analogues were detected for acetaminophen, one 
monochlorinated for carbamazepine, and one mono- and one trichlorinated for 
ethynylestradiol. Chlorine levels and water pH proved to be the most influential 
variables on the degradation of the compounds, with and without dissolved 
organic matter in solution. All pharmaceuticals displayed significant 
photostability towards artificial solar radiation, with acetaminophen being 
slightly more stable.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between increasing life expectancy 
and nonprostate cancer (competing) mortality after radical prostatectomy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied a single-center sample of 6809 consecutive 
patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1992 and 2016 with a median 
age of 65 years and a median follow-up of 7.9 years. Multivariate competing risk 
analyses were performed with competing mortality as endpoint. Linear trends over 
the years of surgery for 5-year competing mortality rates and for mean ages were 
calculated using linear regression analyses. We estimated the number of live 
years gained over time using a heuristic model-based calculation: (hazard ratio 
year of surgery) 24 calendar years × (hazard ratio age at surgery) gained life 
years = 1.
RESULTS: After controlling for age, nonprostate cancer mortality decreased 
significantly during the observation period. Accumulated over the 24 years, this 
decrease of mortality corresponded to the effect of 6.3 years of calendric age. 
Most of the decrease in nonprostate cancer mortality (predominantly attributable 
to noncancer causes of death) was seen in patients aged 65 years or older (8.1 
years gained), whereas there was only a marginal decrease in patients younger 
than 65 years (only 1 year gained). The decrease in nonprostate cancer mortality 
was accompanied by a slight increase of mean age at surgery (2.7 years) that did 
not nearly compensate the decreasing risk.
CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the decreasing competing mortality 
risk in elderly candidates for radical prostatectomy in order to avoid 
undertreatment.

Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a hematologic disease with a wide range of 
clinical courses ranging from an indolent condition with normal life expectancy 
to exceedingly aggressive disorder with a poor prognosis. The symptoms and signs 
of SM result from the release of mast cell mediators with heterogeneous 
functions, and/or organ damage from neoplastic mast cell infiltration, or both. 
Diagnostic criteria for SM are well-defined by the World Health Organization 
(WHO). However, the diagnosis of SM can be difficult when especially it is not 
in the differential diagnosis. Routinely used radiologic techniques (e.g., 
X-ray, ultrasound, CT scans can show findings such as lytic-, sclerotic- or 
mixed-bone lesions, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, retroperitoneal or periportal 
mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and omental thickening). It is essential to 
emphasize that the constellation of these radiologic findings should strongly 
concern of SM, especially in patients who also have a skin rash, allergic 
reactions, gastrointestinal tract symptoms (lasting, intermittent nausea, 
diarrhea), paroxysmal tachycardias, unexplained weight loss, persistent bone 
pain, cytopenias, liver dysfunction, eosinophilia. These findings, even 
coincidentally noted, will likely lead to a tissue biopsy, which reveals 
diagnosis (as we discussed and illustrated some tissue biopsies here). Moreover, 
the role of MRI and new techniques such as [18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission computed tomography, fibroscan] in the diagnosis of SM have been 
discussed. Furthermore, we reviewed the use of radiologic methods to evaluate 
treatment response and prognostication of SM..

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Telemedicine can be used to monitor determinants and outcomes 
of patients with chronic diseases, possibly increasing the quality and value of 
care. Telemedicine was found to reduce outpatient visits and hospital admissions 
for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We performed a full 
economic evaluation of telemedicine interventions in patients with IBD, 
comparing the cost-utility of telemedicine vs standard care.
METHODS: We performed a randomized trial of 909 patients with IBD at 2 academic 
and 2 non-academic hospitals in The Netherlands. Patients were randomly assigned 
to groups that received telemedicine (myIBDcoach; n = 465) or standard 
outpatient care (n = 444) and followed for 12 months. Costs were measured from a 
societal perspective. Direct healthcare costs were based on actual resource use. 
Indirect costs comprised self-reported hours sick leave from work, intervention 
costs (annual license fee of €40 per patient [$45]), and utility costs (assessed 
using EQ5D). Cost-utility and uncertainty were estimated using the 
non-parametric bootstrapping method.
RESULTS: Telemedicine resulted in lower mean annual costs of €547/patient [$612] 
(95% CI, €1029-2143 [$1150-2393]; mean costs of €9481 [$10,587] for standard 
care and €8924 [$9965] for telemedicine) without changing quality adjusted life 
years. At the Dutch threshold of €80,000 [$89,335] per quality adjusted life 
year, the intervention had increased incremental cost-effectiveness over 
standard care in 83% of replications and an incremental net monetary benefit of 
€707/patient [$790] (95% CI, €1241-2544 [$1386-2841]).
CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine with myIBDcoach is cost saving and has a high 
probability of being cost effective for patients with IBD. This self-management 
tool enables continuous registration of quality indicators and 
(patient-reported) outcomes and might help reorganize IBD care toward 
value-based healthcare. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT02173002.

OBJECTIVE: Retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters were first approved for 
use in the United States in 2003 to address the long-term complications of 
migration, thrombosis, fracture, and perforation observed with permanent IVC 
filter implantation. Although Food and Drug Administration approval of 
retrievable IVC filters includes permanent implantation, the incidence of 
complications from long-term implantation appears to be greater than that 
reported with existing permanent IVC filters. Also, only a small fraction of 
such retrievable IVC filters are ever retrieved. The purpose of the present 
study was to determine the threshold retrieval rate at which the use of 
retrievable IVC filters could be justified.
METHODS: A Markov decision tree was constructed comparing retrievable and 
permanent IVC filters regarding their effectiveness and cost. A review of the 
reported data provided outcome probabilities, and the Tufts Medical Center 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry was the source of the utility values for 
the various potential outcomes. Medicare reimbursement rates served as a proxy 
for costs. A sensitivity analysis was performed for various parameters, 
primarily to determine the retrieval rate threshold at which the use of 
retrievable IVC filters would outperform the use of permanent IVC filters.
RESULTS: Base case analysis demonstrated a greater predicted effectiveness for 
permanent compared with retrievable IVC filter implantation (5.41 
quality-adjusted life-years [QALY] vs 5.33 QALY) at a lower cost ($2070 vs 
$4650). Monte Carlo simulation at 10,000 iterations confirmed the expected 
utility (5.4 ± 3.0 QALY vs 5.3 ± 3.0 QALY; P = .0002) and cost ($1900 ± $7400 vs 
$4800 ± 9900; P < .0001) to be statistically superior for permanent IVC filters. 
A sensitivity analysis for the filter retrieval rate demonstrated that the 
strategy of using a retrievable IVC filter was never preferable for utility or 
cost. The superiority of permanent IVC filter placement for effectiveness and 
cost persisted, regardless of anticipated patient-predicted annual mortality. A 
two-way sensitivity analysis for both IVC filter removal rate and annual patient 
mortality confirmed the superiority of permanent IVC filter placement at all 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The predicted effectiveness of permanent IVC filters was greater 
and the predicted cost lower than those for retrievable IVC filters, regardless 
of the IVC filter retrieval rate. This interpretation of existing reported data 
using Markov decision analysis modeling supports the argument that unless the 
long-term complication rate of retrievable IVC filters can be significantly 
improved, their use should be abandoned in favor of currently available 
permanent IVC filters.

INTRODUCTION: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has had a major impact on life 
expectancy from HIV as many people now live with it as a chronic disease. 
Chronic HIV has been associated with a range of comorbid disabilities and health 
conditions, one of which is hearing loss. Undiagnosed and untreated hearing 
loss, particularly in children, has been linked to poorer spoken language 
skills, with subsequent effects on academic performance.
METHODS: This systematic scoping review aimed to summarize the available 
peer-reviewed literature on hearing loss in HIV-infected children, specifically 
to describe its extent and nature. The review followed the framework proposed by 
Arksey and O'Malley. Key search terms included hearing loss (and synonyms), 
child (and synonyms), and HIV. Electronic databases (EBSCOhost Research 
Platform, PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases) were searched for any 
relevant articles published from January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2019. Reference 
lists of included articles were pearled for additional relevant articles not 
already identified. Each stage of the selection process was conducted 
independently by two authors. The results were then collated by a third author 
who also resolved any discrepancies. Extracted data included sample descriptors, 
audiologic tests, hearing loss prevalence, hearing loss descripts, and factors 
associated with hearing loss.
RESULTS: Seventeen articles were included; 10 from Africa, four from South 
America, two from North America and the remaining article from Asia. Although 
most of the articles reported on pure tone audiometry, the samples as well as 
the cut-off criteria for normal hearing were heterogenous. Prevalence of hearing 
loss varied across articles (from 6% to 84%). Conductive hearing loss occurred 
more frequently than sensorineural or mixed hearing loss. ART use and ear 
infection were reported as significant in three of five articles that reported 
on significant associates of HIV-related hearing loss.
CONCLUSION: There was a modest volume of research from a limited number of 
countries. Heterogeneity in sampling and audiometric methods precluded a clear 
understanding of potential associations between chronic HIV-related hearing loss 
and contributing factors.

Different Signatures of High Cardiorespiratory Capacity Revealed With 
Metabolomic Profiling in Elite Athletes.

Monnerat G, Sánchez CAR, Santos CGM, Paulucio D, Velasque R, Evaristo GPC, 
Evaristo JAM, Nogueira FCS, Domont GB, Serrato M, Lima AS, Bishop D, Campos de 
Carvalho AC, Pompeu FAMS.

PURPOSE: High cardiorespiratory capacity is a key determinant of human 
performance and life expectancy; however, the underlying mechanisms are not 
fully understood. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate 
biochemical signatures of endurance-performance athletes using high-resolution 
nontargeted metabolomics.
METHODS: Elite long-distance runners with similar training and anthropometrical 
records were studied. After athletes' maximal oxygen consumption (V˙O2max) was 
measured, they were divided into 2 groups: low V˙O2max (<65 mL·kg-1·min-1, n = 
7) and high V˙O2max (>75 mL·kg-1·min-1, n = 7). Plasma was collected under basal 
conditions after 12 hours of fasting and after a maximal exercise test 
(nonfasted) and analyzed by high-resolution LC-MS. Multivariate and univariate 
statistics were applied.
RESULTS: A total of 167 compounds were putatively identified with an LC-MS-based 
metabolomics pipeline. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis showed a 
clear separation between groups. Significant variations in metabolites 
highlighted group differences in diverse metabolic pathways, including lipids, 
vitamins, amino acids, purine, histidine, xenobiotics, and others, either under 
basal condition or after the maximal exercise test.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the metabolic alterations revealed in the study 
affect cellular energy use and availability, oxidative stress management, muscle 
damage, central nervous system signaling metabolites, nutrients, and compound 
bioavailability, providing new insights into metabolic alterations associated 
with exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness levels in trained athletes.

Sickle Cell Anemia in Cuba: Prevention and Management, 1982-2018.

Marcheco-Teruel B.

Sickle cell anemia is the most common hereditary disease in Cuba. On average, 1 
in 33 Cubans is a carrier of this severe hemolytic anemia that can cause early 
death. In early 1980, its incidence in Cuba was calculated at 1 in 1600 births. 
In 1982, the Cuban public health system established the Sickle Cell Anemia 
Prevention Program, which aims to prevent the disease through identification of 
carrier couples and antenatal diagnosis of fetuses with disease-associated 
genotypes. In 1982-2018, hemoglobin genotypes were tested in 4,847,239 pregnant 
women. Of these, 168,865 (3.5%) were found to be carriers or to have sickle cell 
disease. During the same period, 8180 at-risk couples were identified, of whom 
79.2% agreed to an antenatal study for detection of the sickle cell gene in the 
fetus. Among fetuses diagnosed, 20.1% had the SS genotype, the most clinically 
severe; 76.2% of the associated couples decided to interrupt the pregnancy. This 
program has resulted in a 3-fold reduction in prevalence of sickle cell disease 
in Cuba, a 10-fold reduction in the number of infants born with it each year, 
and a 16-year average increase in life expectancy of sickle cell disease 
patients of both sexes. Key contributors to these results have been universal 
screening of pregnant women in primary care, installation of diagnostic 
laboratories in every province, genetic counseling for couples, testing of fetal 
DNA (allowing couples to decide whether to continue the pregnancy if the fetus 
tests positive for the disease) and guaranteed multidisciplinary clinical care 
for patients. The Cuban experience shows that a middle-income country can 
mitigate the impact of a genetic disease through a universal preventive program 
based in primary care, which also pays particular attention to afflicted 
patients. KEYWORDS Sickle cell anemia, sickle cell disease, sickle cell

Increased life expectancy and illness prevention and treatment have led to a 
growing population of older patients. These changes in patient population are 
apparent in neurosurgery; however, relatively little is reported about specific 
outcomes and prognostication in this group. This review summarises the 
challenges and management changes occurring in the treatment of three common 
neurosurgical pathologies; aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, head injury, and 
haemorrhagic stroke. A move towards less invasive neurosurgical techniques has 
implications on the risk-benefit profile of interventions. This creates the 
opportunity to intervene in older patients with greater co-morbidity, as long as 
improved outcomes can be evidenced. A critical part of assessing appropriateness 
for surgical intervention in older patients may be to change from a mindset of 
age to one of frailty and growing interest in scales assessing this may aid 
treatment decisions in the future.

PURPOSE: In cost-utility analysis, outcomes are usually measured in terms of 
quality-adjusted life years, where length of life is adjusted by levels of 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using a single value, known as a health 
state utility value (HSUV). This study explores the HSUVs of parents of children 
with a serious illness admitted within three hospital departments (cardiology, 
oncology and paediatric intensive care) across four time points, compares HSUVs 
with Australian population norms and examines predictors of parental HSUVs.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Take a Breath study, where parental HSUVs 
were measured using the Assessment of Quality of Life-8 Dimensions (AQoL-8D). 
Descriptive statistics and t-tests compared the AQoL-8D scores with population 
norms, while repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare parental HSUVs of 
children treated across illness groups over time. Regression analysis was 
performed to determine predictors of parental HSUVs.
RESULTS: Parental HSUVs were not significantly different from the general 
Australian population norms (p = 0.939), as measured by the AQoL-8D. However, 
statistically significant differences were observed in the psychosocial 
super-dimension (p < 0.01) and in all eight AQoL-8D dimensions, except for 
senses and self-worth. No significant differences were observed across illness 
groups. Parental HSUVs were associated with psychosocial risk factors of trait 
anxiety (p < 0.001), depression (p < 0.001) and family beliefs (p = 0.024).
CONCLUSION: Having a child with a severe illness has an impact on the 
psychosocial aspects of parental HRQoL regardless of the type of illness. 
Psychosocial health factors of trait anxiety, depression and family beliefs were 
important predictors of parental HSUV.

Body elongation and decreased reproductive output within a restricted clade of 
lizards (Reptilia: Scincidae).

(1)Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, 
California 94720, USA.

Relationships between body shape and relative abdominal size were compared among 
differentially elongate species within the scincid lizard genus Brachymeles, to 
investigate how morphological evolution affects the proportion of body volume 
available to hold eggs and offspring. Relative abdominal size is inversely 
related to elongation, suggesting that relative clutch mass decreases with 
addition of abdominal body segments. Shape-volume relationships contradict 
trends seen in comparisons among distantly related limbed and limbless squamates 
(lizards and snakes), in which snakes have relatively more abdominal volume. 
Comparison within a phylogenetically restricted group allows the identification 
of functional and ontogenetic factors potentially limiting reproductive output. 
In Bruchymeles, constraining factors include retention of anterior body segments 
bearing parasternal ribs, which prevents extension of the clutch anteriorly 
within the body, and reduction of allometry of abdominal segments, which 
provides extended series of uniformly-sized vertebrae for limbless locomotion, 
but reduces the relative size of the abdomen. The latter trait is associated 
with overall size reduction, which affects relative egg-size and packing. 
Factors constraining abdominal volume in this genus are probably common to other 
elongate lizards, a morphological group that has been rarely represented in 
comparative studies of life history.

BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective treatment option to 
relieve chronic intractable pain, and failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is a 
key indication.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of the current study was to analyze the cost 
consequences of using non-rechargeable (NR)-SCS and rechargeable (R)-SCS.
METHODS: Real data taken from a review of 86 patients were used to simulate 
costs and review which patients might have benefitted more from R-SCS. 
Calculations were made to see what is the impact from a monetary point of view.
RESULTS: On average, NR-SCS devices lasted for 58 months (M). Only 14 patients 
were not eligible to receive an R-SCS implant. We found that using R-SCS 
batteries would save up to €56.322 on average over a patient's life expectancy, 
which means a saving of 43% compared to using NR-SCS systems. In our analysis, 
we found that if R-SCS implants were used instead of NR-SCS batteries, a saving 
of €5,735,334.23 over patients' life expectancy would be made, which represented 
a 63% saving to the public health system. We found that R-SCS was 
cost-beneficial from second year compared to NR-SCS, saving up to 70% when 
patients are implanted for 9 years.
CONCLUSIONS: This cost-consequences analysis suggests that R-SCS implants are 
more cost-beneficial than NR-SCS systems in well-selected patient candidates for 
this type of treatment.

BACKGROUND: Those with serious mental illness (SMI) including both psychotic and 
affective disorders are recognized to have a premature mortality compared to the 
general population, at least in part due to elevated cardiovascular risk 
profile.
AIM: To examine the effect of a 12-week, pragmatic, sustainable, low-cost 
intervention involving community activity, nutritional advice and exercise that 
could be accessible to patients attending a community clinic.
METHODS: Participants (N = 35) with SMI attending a community mental health 
service who were considered at risk of metabolic syndrome were referred by their 
clinical teams to a specialized healthy activity and nutritional programme. The 
intervention involved participation in exercise, dietary education and targeted 
lifestyle advice focused on community activities. Data on physical health and 
clinical parameters were collected pre- and post-intervention.
RESULTS: Physical activity increased following the intervention along with a 
statistically significant increase in self-esteem scores. There was no 
significant reduction in body mass index or lowering of anxiety and depression 
scores.
CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to develop a relatively low-cost, community-based 
physical activity programme, integrating both nutritional advice and healthy 
activities. This may lead to improved outcomes in cardiovascular risk profile 
and improved life expectancy.

Empirically derived dietary-lifestyle patterns and cardiometabolic health in 
young men: a review.

Sex and gender are important factors that impact cardiometabolic traits. Men 
have lower life expectancy and higher prevalence of fatal chronic conditions at 
younger age. Lifestyle risk profiles in young men have been rarely studied in 
the context of cardiometabolic health. This review aimed to summarise the 
evidence regarding the patterns of dietary-lifestyle behaviours in a population 
of young men (age <40years) and their associations with cardiometabolic health. 
Overall, unfavourable clusters of health behaviours are more prominent in men, 
when compared to women and more prevalent in younger adults, when compared to 
older age groups. Early signs of cardiometabolic health abnormalities have been 
reported among men with higher adherence to patterns which consistently shared 
poor dietary habits as a common denominator, combined with stimulant use, 
inadequate sleep or insufficient physical activity. In the majority of studies, 
dietary assessment was limited to the investigation of one or two behaviours, 
most frequently fruit and vegetable intake. Since young men may engage in a 
mixture of explicit behaviours, the examination of a singular dietary habit may 
not represent the overall diet quality. To conclude, the data regarding the 
synergistic effects of a broad spectrum of dietary and lifestyle behaviours in 
the context of cardiometabolic health remain scarce in this population. The 
inclusion of a broader range of dietary and lifestyle variables into the 
multicomponent pattern analysis might have a greater potential in explaining the 
association with cardiometabolic health. Defining behavioural clusters can help 
to develop interventions, tailored to the specific needs of the targeted group.

[Continuous and advanced treatment strategies in the old to very old 
parkinsonian population].

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with an incidence and a 
prevalence increasing with age, predicted to increase drastically in the next 10 
years among the geriatric population aged above 80 in France. There are two 
distinct groups of patients in which therapeutic issues are different. On the 
one hand, old to very old patients in which PD started at a late age above 80. 
These patients present with a more severe PD with earlier onsets of cognitive 
defects and dopa-resistant axial signs, and more comorbidities needing to be 
taken into account while treating them. Because of their limited life 
expectancy, these patients would not likely need second line treatments over 
their disease course. On the other hand, patients presenting with advanced PD, 
in which fluctuations and dyskinesia induced by dopamine replacement therapy and 
dopa-resistant axial symptoms impede patient's daily life. These patients are 
often treated with multiple antiparkinsonian medications, sometimes at high 
doses. Some patients will also be treated with advanced therapies such as 
continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion, continuous levodopa-carbidopa 
intestinal gel or, more rarely, even subthalamic or pallidal deep brain 
stimulations. Because of the specificities of the old to very old parkinsonian 
patients, tolerance and efficacy of these treatments can be decreased. What is 
at stake is to aim for the best motor state possible while limiting iatrogenic 
adverse events. New emerging, potentially less invasive, techniques, such as 
gamma knife thalamotomy or high-intensity focused ultrasound thalamotomy or 
sub-thalamotomy, are also discussed here.

IMPORTANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) may increase the diagnostic 
accuracy and confirm the underlying neuropathologic changes of Alzheimer disease 
(AD).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of antemortem [18F]flortaucipir PET images 
for predicting the presence of AD-type tau pathology at autopsy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This diagnostic study (A16 primary cohort) 
was conducted from October 2015 to June 2018 at 28 study sites (27 in US sites 
and 1 in Australia). Individuals with a terminal illness who were older than 50 
years and had a projected life expectancy of less than 6 months were enrolled. 
All participants underwent [18F]flortaucipir PET imaging, and scans were 
interpreted by 5 independent nuclear medicine physicians or radiologists. 
Supplemental autopsy [18F]flortaucipir images and pathological samples were also 
collected from 16 historically collected cases. A second study (FR01 validation 
study) was conducted from March 26 to April 26, 2019, in which 5 new readers 
assessed the original PET images for comparison to autopsy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: [18F]flortaucipir PET images were visually assessed 
and compared with immunohistochemical tau pathology. An AD tau pattern of 
flortaucipir retention was assessed for correspondence with a postmortem 
B3-level (Braak stage V or VI) pathological pattern of tau accumulation and to 
the presence of amyloid-β plaques sufficient to meet the criteria for high 
levels of AD neuropathological change. Success was defined as having at least 3 
of the 5 readers above the lower bounds of the 95% CI for both sensitivity and 
specificity of 50% or greater.
RESULTS: A total of 156 patients were enrolled in the A16 study and underwent 
[18F]flortaucipir PET imaging. Of these, 73 died during the study, and valid 
autopsies were performed for 67 of these patients. Three autopsies were 
evaluated as test cases and removed from the primary cohort (n = 64). Of the 64 
primary cohort patients, 34 (53%) were women and 62 (97%) were white; mean (SD) 
age was 82.5 (9.6) years; and 49 (77%) had dementia, 1 (2%) had mild cognitive 
impairment, and 14 (22%) had normal cognition. Prespecified success criteria 
were met for the A16 primary cohort. The flortaucipir PET scans predicted a B3 
level of tau pathology, with sensitivity ranging from 92.3% (95% CI, 
79.7%-97.3%) to 100.0% (95% CI, 91.0%-100.0%) and specificity ranging from 52.0% 
(95% CI, 33.5%-70.0%) to 92.0% (95% CI, 75.0%-97.8%). A high level of AD 
neuropathological change was predicted with sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI, 
82.7%-98.5%) to 100.0% (95% CI, 90.8%-100.0%) and specificity of 50.0% (95% CI, 
32.1%-67.9%) to 92.3% (95% CI, 75.9%-97.9%). The FR01 validation study also met 
prespecified success criteria. Addition of the supplemental autopsy data set and 
3 test cases, which comprised a total of 82 patients and autopsies for both the 
A16 and FR01 studies, resulted in improved specificity and comparable overall 
accuracy. Among the 156 enrolled participants, 14 (9%) experienced at least 1 
treatment-emergent adverse event.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study's findings suggest that PET imaging with 
[18F]flortaucipir could be used to identify the density and distribution of 
AD-type tau pathology and the presence of high levels of AD neuropathological 
change, supporting a neuropathological diagnosis of AD.

Health care services are being confronted by a daily dilemma of who can receive 
critical care and who cannot. In a palliative care clinic, this apprehension 
gets exemplified, as these patients have limited life expectancy. The head and 
neck region further makes things critical, as it comprises of all the sites 
through which the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted. This document strives to define 
the ways in which the head and neck cancer services can contribute to better 
patient care in a triage context. Practical steps suggested are protective 
equipment use, ensuring access to critical drugs (such as opioids), greater use 
of telemedicine consultations, discussing advance care plans, and embracing the 
role of a wider community support.

In this study, we investigated changes in the isoflavone content, total phenolic 
content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), antioxidant activities (DPPH, 
ABTS), and anti-inflammatory activities of small-seeded and large-seeded soybean 
cultivars during germination (light/dark conditions). Total isoflavone content 
was higher at the seed stage in large-seeded soybeans, while it increased after 
7 days of germination in small-seeded soybeans, particularly in response to 
light conditions, under which they had high TPC, TFC, and antioxidant 
activities. In large-seeded soybeans, the germination environment did not 
significantly affect TFC or DPPH inhibition, whereas TPC and ABTS inhibition 
were high under dark germination conditions. Extracts of sprouts exhibited 
superior anti-inflammatory activities. Nitric oxide production was slightly 
lower in small-seeded and large-seeded soybeans germinated under light and dark 
conditions, respectively. Our findings indicate that germinated soybeans 
improved nutritionally, and that enhancement of bioactivity under different 
germination environments could contribute to the selection of appropriate 
soybean cultivars.

Calorie-reduced diets to combat obesity do work, but they only work when one 
sticks to the diet and the - relatively small - weight loss usually is 
short-lived. It is argued that calorie-reduced diets should converge with 
enduring lifestyle changes: the diet is just the start of a lifelong new eating 
pattern. Getting people to change their lifestyles forever could increase the 
amount of lost weight and prevent relapse. However, a real behavior change is 
difficult, especially when longstanding habits are involved and the change is 
intended for the rest of life. It is argued here that adherence to a new 
lifestyle is much easier if sabotaging cognitive processes are tackled. An 
overview is given of four studies into the effects of exposure to reduce 
appetitive responding to tempting food cues. A robust effect of exposure on the 
ad lib intake of exposed foods was found in all studies: participants ate 
significantly less of exposed foods after exposure compared to control 
interventions but no generalization to non-exposed foods was found. The reduced 
food intake after exposure was associated with a violation of overeating 
expectancies. It is discussed that lifestyle interventions might benefit from 
techniques that are really able to change longstanding habits. Specifically, the 
violation of overeating expectancies during exposure seems to be critical for 
controlled eating and should therefore be part of lifestyle interventions for 
obesity.

Dynamic crosslinking networks based on Diels-Alder (DA) chemistry and ionic 
interactions were introduced to maleic anhydride modified ethylene-vinyl acetate 
copolymer (mEVA) via in situ melt processing. The dual dynamic crosslinking 
networks were characterized by temperature-dependent FTIR, and the effects on 
the shape memory properties of mEVA were evaluated with dynamic mechanical
