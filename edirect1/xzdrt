clinical care. The HOSPITAL score and the LACE index were previously validated 
to predict 30-day readmissions but may also help to assess mortality risk. We 
assessed their performance to predict 1-year and 30-day mortality in 
hospitalized older multimorbid patients with polypharmacy.
METHODS: We calculated the HOSPITAL score and LACE index in patients from the 
OPERAM (OPtimising thERapy to prevent Avoidable hospital admissions in the 
Multimorbid elderly) trial (patients aged ≥ 70 years with multimorbidity and 
polypharmacy, admitted to hospital across four European countries in 2016-2018). 
Our primary and secondary outcomes were 1-year and 30-day mortality. We assessed 
the overall accuracy (scaled Brier score, the lower the better), calibration 
(predicted/observed proportions), and discrimination (C-statistic) of the 
models.
RESULTS: Within 1 year, 375/1879 (20.0%) patients had died, including 94 deaths 
within 30 days. The overall accuracy was good and similar for both models 
(scaled Brier score 0.01-0.08). The C-statistics were identical for both models 
(0.69 for 1-year mortality, p = 0.81; 0.66 for 30-day mortality, p = 0.94). 
Calibration showed well-matching predicted/observed proportions.
CONCLUSION: The HOSPITAL score and LACE index showed similar performance to 
predict 1-year and 30-day mortality in older multimorbid patients with 
polypharmacy. Their overall accuracy was good, their discrimination low to 
moderate, and the calibration good. These simple tools may help predict older 
multimorbid patients' mortality after hospitalization, which may inform 
post-hospitalization intensity of care.

PURPOSE: We sought to understand concerns fundamental to planning medical 
education specific to rural southern African Americans who are virtually 
nonexistent in American medical schools.
METHODS: A diverse multidisciplinary research team conducted this qualitative 
study with 3 focus groups, including 17 rural medical educators recruited 
nationwide, 10 African American alumni of a rural medical education pipeline in 
Alabama, and 5 community and institutional associates of this pipeline. Analysis 
of recorded transcripts generated themes fitting an ecological model suggesting 
concerns and intervention foci at individual, community, and institutional 
levels.
FINDINGS: Three major themes operating at all ecological levels were: (1) How 
"rural minority student" is defined, with "rural" often supplanting race to 
indicate minority status; (2) Multiple factors relate to rural racial minority 
student recruitment and success, including personal relationships with peers, 
mentors, and role models and supportive institutional policies and culturally 
competent faculty; and (3) Challenges to recruitment and retention of rural 
minority students, especially financial concerns and preparation for medical 
education.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that individuals, communities, and 
institutions provide intervention points for planning medical education specific 
to southern rural African Americans. These spheres of influence project a need 
for partnership among communities and rural medical educators to affect broad 
programmatic and policy changes that address the dire shortage of rural African 
American health professionals to help ameliorate health inequities experienced 
in their home communities. It is likely that linear thinking and programming 
will be replaced by integrated, intertwined conceptualizations to reach this 
goal.

Background: Premenopause and menopause are nowadays a matter of public health 
due to the increasing life expectancy for women. Medical issues related to the 
period of premenopause and menopause are important, since they can alter the 
quality of women's life. Objectives:The goal of this prospective study is to 
determine the effect of an original formula consisting of phytoestrogens 
extracted from soy germs (Glycyne hisipida) with 40% isoflavones, vitamin E and 
grapeseed extract (Vitis vinifera) with 95% proanthocyanidins in reducing 
menopausal symptoms. Materials and methods: The present study had a six-month 
monitoring period in 2011 and involved four investigating physicians from "Bega" 
Clinical Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Timisoara, Romania. Outcomes: 
After six months of therapy there was a percentually decrease in menopause 
symptoms (irritability, depression, anxiety, hot flashes, etc); the most 
dramatic changes in the symptomatology of these women were noticed among 
premenopausal subjects. Conclusion:The original formula consisting of 
phytoestrogen, vitamin E and grapeseed extract can be applied in premenopause 
and surgically-induced menopause, and it is beneficial by decreasing the 
intensity of the symptomatology.

and Technology, Patiala, Punjab India.

OBJECTIVE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a grade IV brain tumour with very 
low life expectancy. Physicians and oncologists urgently require automated 
techniques in clinics for brain tumour segmentation (BTS) and survival 
prediction (SP) of GBM patients to perform precise surgery followed by 
chemotherapy treatment.
METHODS: This study aims at examining the recent methodologies developed using 
automated learning and radiomics to automate the process of SP. Automated 
techniques use pre-operative raw magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and 
clinical data related to GBM patients. All SP methods submitted for the 
multimodal brain tumour segmentation (BraTS) challenge are examined to extract 
the generic workflow for SP.
RESULTS: The maximum accuracies achieved by 21 state-of-the-art different SP 
techniques reviewed in this study are 65.5 and 61.7% using the validation and 
testing subsets of the BraTS dataset, respectively. The comparisons based on 
segmentation architectures, SP models, training parameters and hardware 
configurations have been made.
CONCLUSION: The limited accuracies achieved in the literature led us to review 
the various automated methodologies and evaluation metrics to find out the 
research gaps and other findings related to the survival prognosis of GBM 
patients so that these accuracies can be improved in future. Finally, the paper 
provides the most promising future research directions to improve the 
performance of automated SP techniques and increase their clinical relevance.

There is little current research comparing stress, burnout, and resilience in 
pediatric and adult intensive care practitioners. This article analyzes data 
derived from a 2018 qualitative study of burnout and resilience among ICU 
providers to explore differences that may exist between the pediatric and adult 
domains of practice.
DESIGN: This study represents a thematic subanalysis of textual data derived 
from a larger qualitative study of ICU provider burnout and resilience.
SETTING: Six international critical care units (Australia, Israel, United 
States).
SUBJECTS: Physicians working at the above sites who had been practicing as 
intensivists for a minimum period of 4 years.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were collected using a semistructured 
interview process, and resulting transcripts were analyzed using postpositivist 
framework analysis. A secondary analysis was then performed separately on 
pediatric and adult datasets using the initial coding framework as a template. 
Three themes related to perceived differences were noted: differences in the 
patient characteristics within both cohorts, differences in the relationships 
between staff and family, and personal biases of individual intensivists. 
Pediatric and adult practitioners differed in their perceptions of the patient's 
perceived responsibility for their illness. Emotional responses to the stressor 
of child abuse (particularly as they related to clinician-family relationships) 
also differed. The stress of dealing with family expectations of patient 
survival even in dire circumstances was unique to the pediatric environment. 
Both pediatric and adult practitioners commented on the perceived difficulty of 
assuming the opposite role. Differences in life expectancy and mortality rate 
were significant factors in this.
CONCLUSIONS: Although similar stressors exist within each group, meaningful 
differences in how these are perceived and personally processed by individual 
clinicians exist. Better understanding of these differences will assist attempts 
to enhance the resilience and provide career guidance to aspiring intensive care 
clinicians.

[Discordant parameters of insulin-like growth factor 1 and growth hormone in the 
diagnosis and monitoring of acromegaly].

Acromegaly is a rare endocrine disorder associated with multiple complications 
and increased mortality. Timely diagnosis and adequate treatment can bring the 
life expectancy of patients with acromegaly closer to the general population 
level. The tests for the diagnosis of acromegaly are measurement of both serum 
GH, and GH after oral glucose administration; serum insulin-like growth factor-1 
(IGF-1). However, in clinical practice, up to 39% of patients with discordant 
results are found. The patients with discordant GH and IGF-1levels, are the most 
difficult to manage. This review discusses the prevalence of discordant GH and 
IGF-1 outcomes in patients with acromegaly; factors causing this discrepancy; 
the impact of hormone levels on treatment outcomes. Although endocrinologists 
are used to dealing with this discrepancy in clinical practice for many years, 
discordant patients'outcome remains uncertain and undefined The optimal 
treatment should be individually tailored for each patient, taking into account 
all clinical parameters.

Акромегалия — это редкое эндокринное заболевание, ассоциированное с 
множественными осложнениями и повышенной смертностью. Своевременная диагностика 
и адекватное лечение позволяют приблизить продолжительность жизни пациентов с 
акромегалией к общепопуляционному уровню. При скрининге, верификации диагноза и 
оценке эффективности различных методов лечения акромегалии используются 
следующие показатели: уровень гормона роста (соматотропного гормона, СТГ) в 
крови, как базальный, так и в ходе орального глюкозотолерантного теста (СТГ в 
ходе ОГТТ), и концентрация инсулиноподобного фактора роста-1 (ИФР-1). Вместе с 
тем в клинической практике до 39% пациентов с акромегалией имеют дискордантные 
результаты этих анализов. Ошибочная интерпретация не соответствующих друг другу 
лабораторных данных может приводить к гипердиагностике акромегалии или, 
наоборот, — несвоевременному выявлению заболевания, а также к избыточному 
назначению ненужных методов лечения или, в обратном случае, — длительному 
отсутствию адекватной терапии. В данном обзоре обсуждаются распространенность 
дискордантных результатов СТГ и ИФР-1 у пациентов с акромегалией; факторы, 
обуславливающие это расхождение, а также влияние несоответствия гормональных 
показателей на исходы лечения. Однозначного объяснения дискордантности уровней 
СТГ и ИФР-1 и руководства к ведению пациентов с акромегалией, имеющих такие 
результаты, к сожалению, в настоящее время не найдено. Специалисту крайне важно 
применять комплексный подход и учитывать все возможные факторы при интерпретации 
этих лабораторных показателей.

PURPOSE: We determined trends in life expectancy and cause-specific late 
mortality after autologous blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) performed over 
a 30-year period, using the BMT Survivor Study.
METHODS: We constructed a cohort of 4,702 individuals with hematologic neoplasms 
who lived ≥ 2 years after autologous BMT performed between 1981 and 2014 at 
three transplant centers. The end of follow-up was April 19, 2021. The primary 
exposure variable was autologous BMT performed in four eras: 1981-1999; 
2000-2005; 2006-2010; and 2011-2014. Vital status and cause of death were 
obtained from National Death Index Plus program and Accurinct databases.
RESULTS: The median age at BMT was 53 years (range, 0-78 years), 58.7% were 
male, 67.8% were non-Hispanic White, and 28.3% had undergone transplantation 
between 2011 and 2014. Autologous BMT recipients experienced a 7-year reduction 
in life expectancy. The adjusted hazard of 5-year all-cause mortality declined 
over the four eras (reference: 1981-1999; hazard ratio [HR]2000-2005 = 0.77; 95% 
CI, 0.62 to 0.94; HR2006-2010 = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.79; HR2011-2014 = 0.56; 
95% CI, 0.45 to 0.71; Ptrend < .001), as did years of life lost (5.0 years to 
1.6 years). The reduction in all-cause mortality was most pronounced among those 
transplanted for Hodgkin lymphoma or plasma cell dyscrasias, but was not 
observed among those transplanted for non-Hodgkin lymphoma or those conditioned 
with total-body irradiation. We also observed a decline in late deaths because 
of infection (Ptrend < .0001; primarily for BMTs before 2006) and subsequent 
neoplasms (Ptrend = .03; confined to decline in therapy-related myeloid 
neoplasm-related mortality) but not because of cardiovascular or renal disease.
CONCLUSION: Late mortality among autologous BMT recipients has declined over a 
30-year period. However, ongoing efforts are needed to mitigate development of 
infections, subsequent neoplasms, and cardiovascular and renal disease to 
further reduce late mortality.

Encouraging hindsight in advance: Age progression in therapy - and life.

Yapko MD(1).

Author information:
(1)Private Practice, Fallbrook, CA, USA.

Each person forms a relationship to the dimension of time, called a "temporal 
orientation." How that relationship is defined and prioritized, whether 
consciously or non-consciously, plays a huge role in the way people go about 
living their lives. In psychotherapy, the quality of one's expectations plays a 
pivotal role in virtually every phase of treatment. As a class of hypnotic 
interventions, age progression treatment strategies are intricately connected to 
expectancy since they typically involve guiding the client experientially, i.e., 
subjectively, into the future. While absorbed in this suggested projection, 
clients may have the opportunity to imagine and experience the consequences of 
current or new choices, integrate suggestions at deeper levels for eventual 
activation, rehearse new patterns of thought, feeling or behavior, and, in 
general, obtain a greater overview of his or her life than a narrower focus on 
day-to-day living typically affords. To paraphrase Milton Erickson, one can 
think of it as encouraging hindsight while it is still foresight.

Gene set enrichment tests (a.k.a. functional enrichment analysis) are among the 
most frequently used methods in computational biology. Despite this popularity, 
there are concerns that these methods are being applied incorrectly and the 
results of some peer-reviewed publications are unreliable. These problems 
include the use of inappropriate background gene lists, lack of false discovery 
rate correction and lack of methodological detail. To ascertain the frequency of 
these issues in the literature, we performed a screen of 186 open-access 
research articles describing functional enrichment results. We find that 95% of 
analyses using over-representation tests did not implement an appropriate 
background gene list or did not describe this in the methods. Failure to perform 
p-value correction for multiple tests was identified in 43% of analyses. Many 
studies lacked detail in the methods section about the tools and gene sets used. 
An extension of this survey showed that these problems are not associated with 
journal or article level bibliometrics. Using seven independent RNA-seq 
datasets, we show misuse of enrichment tools alters results substantially. In 
conclusion, most published functional enrichment studies suffered from one or 
more major flaws, highlighting the need for stronger standards for enrichment 
analysis.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the rapid development of a range of 
vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and 
thrombosis (VITT) is a rare but life-threatening complication of primarily 
adenoviral-based vaccines associated with the presence of antibodies to a 
PF4/polyanion neoepitope and measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays. Presented are serial anti-PF4/polyanion antibody, platelet, and D-dimer 
measurements in a large cohort of patients and their relation to relapse. 
Overall, 51% of patients using the Stago assay had persistently positive 
anti-PF4/polyanion levels 100 days' postdiagnosis, whereas 94% of patients 
monitored by using the Immucor assay remain positive. The median duration of 
positivity of the PF4 assay is 87 days, with 72% of patients remaining positive 
after a median follow-up of 105 days. The use of plasma exchange seemed to 
reduce anti-PF4/polyanion levels and increase platelet counts in the acute 
setting more rapidly than other therapies. The rate of relapse in this study was 
12.6%, with all relapsed cases exhibiting persistently positive PF4 antibodies 
and falling platelet counts. Only one patient had extension of their thrombosis. 
Overall, despite the persistence of PF4 antibodies in 72% of patients, the rate 
of relapse was low and did not seem to result in recrudescence of the aggressive 
clinical picture seen at index presentation. Monitoring of these patients in the 
UK cohort is ongoing and will aid in definition of the natural history of this 
novel condition.

OBJECTIVE: Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, reduced 
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a post hoc analysis of pooled 
data from Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with 
Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) 6 and Peptide Innovation 
for Early Diabetes Treatment (PIONEER) 6. We estimated the benefit of adding 
semaglutide to standard of care (SoC) on life-years free of new/recurrent CVD 
events in people with T2D at high risk of CVD.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Diabetes Lifetime-perspective prediction (DIAL) 
competing risk-adjusted lifetime CVD risk model for people with T2D was 
developed previously. Baseline characteristics of the pooled cohort from SUSTAIN 
6 and PIONEER 6 (POOLED cohort) (N = 6,480) were used to estimate individual 
life expectancy free of CVD for patients in the POOLED cohort. The hazard ratio 
of MACE from adding semaglutide to SoC was derived from the POOLED cohort 
(hazard ratio [HR] 0.76 [95% CI 0.62-0.92]) and combined with an individual's 
risk to estimate their CVD benefit.
RESULTS: Adding semaglutide to SoC was associated with a wide distribution in 
life-years free of CVD gained, with a mean increase of 1.7 (95% CI 0.5-2.9) 
life-years. Estimated life-years free of CVD gained with semaglutide was 
dependent on baseline risk (life-years free of CVD gained in individuals with 
established CVD vs. those with cardiovascular risk factors only: 2.0 vs. 0.2) 
and age at treatment initiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding semaglutide to SoC was associated with a gain in life-years 
free of CVD events that was dependent on baseline CVD risk and age at treatment 
initiation. This study helps contextualize the results of semaglutide clinical 
trials.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction. A fast diagnosis is 
crucial for patient management. Proteins that are synthesized during the 
inflammatory response can be used as biomarkers, helping in a rapid clinical 
assessment or an early diagnosis of infection. The aim of this study was to 
identify biomarkers of inflammation for the diagnosis and prognosis of infection 
in patients with suspected sepsis.
METHODS: In total 406 episodes were included in a prospective cohort study. 
Plasma was collected from all patients with suspected sepsis, for whom blood 
cultures were drawn, in the emergency department (ED), the department of 
infectious diseases, or the haemodialysis unit on the first day of a new 
episode. Samples were analysed using a 92-plex proteomic panel based on a 
proximity extension assay with oligonucleotide-labelled antibody probe pairs 
(OLink, Uppsala, Sweden). Supervised and unsupervised differential expression 
analyses and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to search for 
inflammatory proteins that were different between patients with viral or 
bacterial sepsis and between patients with worse or less severe outcome.
RESULTS: Supervised differential expression analysis revealed 21 proteins that 
were significantly lower in circulation of patients with viral infections 
compared to patients with bacterial infections. More strongly, higher expression 
levels were observed for 38 proteins in patients with high SOFA scores (> 4), 
and for 21 proteins in patients with worse outcome. These proteins are mostly 
involved in pathways known to be activated early in the inflammatory response. 
Unsupervised, hierarchical clustering confirmed that inflammatory response was 
more strongly related to disease severity than to aetiology.
CONCLUSION: Several differentially expressed inflammatory proteins were 
identified that could be used as biomarkers for sepsis. These proteins are 
mostly related to disease severity. Within the setting of an emergency 
department, they could be used for outcome prediction, patient monitoring, and 
directing diagnostics.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), a common congenital anomaly with various 
morphological phenotypes, is also characterised by marked heterogeneity in 
clinical presentations including clinically silent condition with mild 
valvulo-aortopathy, progressive valvulopathy and complex valvulo-aortopathy with 
shorter life expectancy. The clinical importance of using a general and unified 
nosology for BAV is well-accepted by opinion leaders and an international 
consensus statement has been recently published, which will serve as an 
important scientific platform for BAV. This review describes the current 
knowledge of BAV based on clinical studies, addresses several unresolved issues 
requiring investigators' attention and highlights the necessity of prospective 
studies with a very long follow-up duration for better appreciation of 
BAV-associated valvulo-aortopathy. In addition, the progression of valvular 
calcification in patients with BAV and its potential contribution to development 
of valvulopathy will be discussed.

Pharmacologic treatment for overactive bladder (OAB), which is characterized by 
bothersome symptoms such as urgency and urge urinary incontinence (UUI), 
includes anticholinergics and β3-adrenergic receptor agonists. Anticholinergics 
are associated with adverse effects including dry mouth, constipation, cognitive 
impairment, and increased risk of dementia. Therefore, the drug class of 
β3-adrenergic receptor agonists may represent an effective, safe treatment 
option. Vibegron, a β3-adrenergic receptor agonist, was approved for use in 
Japan (2018) and the United States (2020). Over the past 3 years, 2 phase 3 
trials (EMPOWUR, EMPOWUR extension) have been conducted with once-daily vibegron 
75 mg for the treatment of OAB, and additional secondary and subgroup analyses 
have detailed the efficacy and safety of vibegron. In the international phase 3 
EMPOWUR trial, treatment with vibegron was associated with significant 
improvements compared with placebo in efficacy outcomes of micturition 
frequency, UUI episodes, urgency episodes, and volume voided as early as week 2 
that were sustained throughout the 12-week trial. The 40-week EMPOWUR extension 
study, following the 12-week treatment period, demonstrated sustained efficacy 
in patients receiving vibegron for 52 weeks. Treatment with vibegron was also 
associated with improvements in patient-reported measures of quality of life. 
Across studies, vibegron was generally safe and well tolerated. A separate, 
dedicated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring study showed that treatment with 
vibegron was not associated with clinically meaningful effects on blood pressure 
or heart rate. Across all studies, vibegron was efficacious, safe, and well 
tolerated and thus represents a valuable treatment option for patients with OAB. 
Here, nearly 1 year after US approval, we review the published data on efficacy 
and safety of vibegron 75 mg for the treatment of OAB.

Powdery mildew induced by Blumeria graminis f. sp. Tritici (Bgt) has a 
devastating impact on global wheat yield and quality. Host resistance is the 
most effective and economical means to control this disease. In this study, Heng 
4568, an elite wheat cultivar, shows high resistance to 12 Bgt isolates from 
different regions in China at the seedling stage. Genetic analysis demonstrates 
that the powdery mildew resistance in Heng 4568 is conferred by a single 
dominant locus, temporarily designated PmH4568. Furthermore, PmH4568 is mapped 
to the reported Pm2 interval on chromosome 5DS with five Pm2 linked markers and 
flanked by the markers Bwm20 and Bwm21 with a genetic distance of 0.3 and 
0.6 cM, respectively. To further investigate the relationship between PmH4568 
and Pm2, the diagnostic marker Pm2b-map-3 of Pm2 is used to genotype the F2:3 
population derived from the cross Heng 4568 × Daimai 2173. Notably, there is no 
recombination found, indicating that PmH4568 is also probably a Pm2 allele. In 
addition, five closely linked markers as well as one diagnostic marker are 
successfully developed and tested in 16 wheat cultivars from different 
agro-ecological areas in China, which have potential applications in molecular 
breeding by marker-assisted selection.

Pseudogout is a disease characterized by calcium pyrophosphate crystal 
deposition. Involvement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is rare. We herein 
report a case of tophaceous pseudogout of the TMJ with cranial extension. An 
83-year-old woman was referred to our institution for treatment of right TMJ 
pain. The patient's medical and family histories were unremarkable. Magnetic 
resonance imaging showed a mass of about 35 mm in diameter compressing the 
bottom of the right temporal lobe of the brain. Based on a clinical diagnosis of 
a right TMJ tumour, biopsy was performed under general anaesthesia. The 
histopathological diagnosis was pseudogout. Considering the risk of surgically 
induced brain damage, the patient's advanced age and her relatively good quality 
of life, the treatment plan simply involved the observation of the lesion. 
Fourteen months after biopsy, the patient's activities of daily living remained 
unchanged and she had no TMJ pain.

Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are prevalent 
in India. However, there is dearth of literature among Indians studying the 
relationship between the two. This study was carried out to assess various 
cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in patients with knee OA with an objective to 
investigate their association, screening and management.  Methods: In total, 225 
patients were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants were 
diagnosed with knee OA on the basis of the Kellgren and Lawrence (K-L) 
classification of their radiograph. Participants were also assessed for CV risk 
factors (age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, total 
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, smoking) with the help of the Joint 
British Society QRisk3 calculator (JBS3) a comprehensive risk score calculator 
as well as a screening tool, which produces three more variables, namely 
10-years risk of developing CVD, physiological heart age and life expectancy. 
Chi Square, Fishers exact test and one-way ANOVA tests were used to compare the 
categorical and quantitative variables, respectively. Pearson's correlation 
coefficient was used to assess the relationship between CV risk factors and knee 
OA. Multiple regression analysis was done to adjust the multiple con-founders 
and determine their significance. Results: Patients with severe knee OA had a 
statistically significantly higher prevalence of CV risk factors (p<0.05). Grade 
4 knee OA patients were found to have a mean JBS3 risk of 38%, heart age of 82 
years and life expectancy of 77 years as compared to grade 2 patients who had a 
mean JBS3 risk of 11%, heart age of 63 years and life expectancy of 82 years.  
Conclusions: Our study concluded that there is a strong positive correlation 
between knee OA and CVD, with CV risk score being directly proportional to the 
severity of OA.

PURPOSE: The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of robotic arm-assisted 
total hip arthroplasty (rTHA) compared with manual total hip arthroplasty (mTHA) 
and to assess the influence of annual volume on the relative cost-effectiveness 
of rTHA.
METHODS: A database of both rTHA (n = 48 performed in a private centre) and mTHA 
(n = 512 performed in the National Health Service) was used. Patient 
demographics, preoperative Oxford hip score, forgotten joint score, EuroQol 
5-dimensional 3-level (EQ-5D), and postoperative EQ-5D were recorded. Two models 
for incremental cost-effectiveness ratios using cost per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) for rTHA were calculated based on a unit performing 100 rTHAs per 
year: 10-year follow-up and a lifetime time horizon (remaining life expectancy 
of a 69-year-old patient).
RESULTS: When adjusting for confounding factors, rTHA was independently 
associated with a 0.091 (p=0.029) greater improvement in the EQ-5D compared to 
mTHA. This resulted in a 10-year time horizon cost per QALY for rTHA of £1,910 
relative to mTHA, which increased to £2,349 per QALY when discounted (5%/year). 
When using the 10-year time horizon cost per QALY was approximately £3,000 for a 
centre undertaking 50 rTHAs per year and decreased to £1,000 for centre 
undertaking 200 rTHAs per year. Using a lifetime horizon, the incremental 
unadjusted cost per QALY gained was £980 and £1432 when discounted (5%/year) for 
rTHA compared with mTHA.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increased cost associated with rTHA, it was a 
cost-effective intervention relative to mTHA due to the associated greater 
health-related quality of health gain, according to the EQ-5D outcome measure.

Life expectancy in adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) has increased. As 
these patients grow older, they experience aging-related diseases more than 
their healthy peers. To better characterize this field, we launched the 
multi-disciplinary BACH (Brain Aging in Congenital Heart disease) San Donato 
study, that aimed at investigating signs of brain injury in ACHD. Twenty-three 
adults with repaired tetralogy of Fallot and 23 age- and sex-matched healthy 
controls were prospectively recruited and underwent brain magnetic resonance 
imaging. White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) were segmented using a 
machine-learning approach and automatically split into periventricular and deep. 
Cerebral microbleeds were manually counted. A subset of 14 patients were also 
assessed with an extensive neuropsychological battery. Age was 
41.78 ± 10.33 years (mean ± standard deviation) for patients and 
41.48 ± 10.28 years for controls (p = 0.921). Albeit not significantly, total 
brain (p = 0.282) and brain tissue volumes (p = 0.539 for cerebrospinal fluid, 
p = 0.661 for grey matter, p = 0.793 for white matter) were lower in ACHD, while 
total volume (p = 0.283) and sub-classes of WMHs (p = 0.386 for periventricular 
WMHs and p = 0.138 for deep WMHs) were higher in ACHD than in controls. Deep 
WMHs were associated with poorer performance at the frontal assessment battery 
(r = -0.650, p = 0.012). Also, patients had a much larger number of microbleeds 
than controls (median and interquartile range 5 [3-11] and 0 [0-0] respectively; 
p < 0.001). In this study, adults with tetralogy of Fallot showed specific signs 
of brain injury, with some clinical implications. Eventually, accurate 
characterization of brain health using neuroimaging and neuropsychological data 
would aid in the identification of ACHD patients at risk of cognitive 
deterioration.
