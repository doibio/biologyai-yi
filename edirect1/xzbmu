The treatment of musculoskeletal disorders is gaining importance as the 
population ages. In addition to the complications brought on by prolonged life 
expectancy, the growing epidemic of obesity is contributing to joint 
degradation. Cell-based tissue engineering has the potential to advance the 
current treatment for musculoskeletal disorders. This article reviews the 
various forms of arthritis and describes stem cell therapy as a promising 
treatment option.

The remarkable advances made in recent decades in the treatment of haemophilia 
have resulted in a longer life expectancy for haemophilia patients. The care of 
diseases related to ageing in these patients is becoming of great interest. We 
briefly discuss the current possibilities for antithrombotic therapy in patients 
with haemophilia describing the case of a 67-year-old patient with mild 
haemophilia A and atrial fibrillation requiring antithrombotic therapy.

This paper analyzes the interplay between early-life conditions and marital 
status, as determinants of adult mortality. We use individual data from Dutch 
registers (years 1815-2000), combined with business cycle conditions in 
childhood as indicators of early-life conditions. The empirical analysis 
estimates bivariate duration models of marriage and mortality, allowing for 
unobserved heterogeneity. Results show that conditions around birth and school 
going ages are important for marriage and mortality. Men typically enjoy a 
protective effect of marriage, whereas women suffer during childbearing ages. 
However, having been born under favorable economic conditions reduces female 
mortality during childbearing ages.

OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer accounts for a significant number of new cancer cases 
and deaths, with the majority of patients presenting with non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine-kinase 
inhibitors are recommended as an alternative to chemotherapy for certain 
patients, challenges exist for clinical utilization. The objective of this 
analysis was to assess the outcome and economic implications of a clinically 
validated serum-based proteomic test to guide treatment decisions in patients 
with advanced NSCLC, who are EGFR-negative or status unknown, and have 
progressed following at least one chemotherapy regimen.
METHODS: This analysis was conducted from a US payer perspective. Clinical 
outcomes were evaluated over the lifetime of a patient, based on data from 
randomized trials and clinical studies. The clinical endpoints included 
treatment utilization, adverse events, survival, and a composite measure of 
length and quality of life, referred to as the quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY). Costs for testing, treatment, surveillance, and management of adverse 
events were analyzed based on publicly available costs of the related 
procedures. The economic endpoints were cumulative lifetime direct medical costs 
and cost per QALY gained.
RESULTS: In the base case, treatment recommendation for 27.3% of the patient 
population changed from erlotinib to chemotherapy after using the proteomic 
test. Overall survival increased by 0.091 year and QALYs increased by 0.050 
year. The total lifetime direct medical cost per patient decreased by $135 with 
test-guided treatment. The findings were robust over a wide range of variation 
in the input parameters.
CONCLUSION: The serum-based proteomic test informed treatment selection for 
patients with advanced NSCLC who failed previous chemotherapy regimen(s), 
improving QALYs and saving costs.

Cysteine is susceptible to a variety of modifications by reactive oxygen and 
nitrogen oxide species, including glutathionylation; and when two cysteines are 
involved, disulfide formation. Glutathione-cysteine adducts may be removed from 
proteins by glutaredoxin, whereas disulfides may be reduced by thioredoxin. 
Glutaredoxin is homologous to the disulfide-reducing thioredoxin and shares 
similar binding modes of the protein substrate. The evolution of these systems 
is not well characterized. When a single Cys is present in a protein, 
conjugation of the redox buffer glutathione may induce conformational changes, 
resulting in a simple redox switch that effects a signaling cascade. If a second 
cysteine is introduced into the sequence, the potential for disulfide formation 
exists. In favorable protein contexts, a bistable redox switch may be formed. 
Because of glutaredoxin's similarities to thioredoxin, the mutated protein may 
be immediately exapted into the thioredoxin-dependent redox cycle upon addition 
of the second cysteine. Here we searched for examples of protein substrates 
where the number of redox-active cysteine residues has changed throughout 
evolution. We focused on cross-strand disulfides (CSDs), the most common type of 
forbidden disulfide. We searched for proteins where the CSD is present, absent 
and also found as a single cysteine in protein orthologs. Three different 
proteins were selected for detailed study-CD4, ERO1, and AKT. We created 
phylogenetic trees, examining when the CSD residues were mutated during protein 
evolution. We posit that the primordial cysteine is likely to be the cysteine of 
the CSD which undergoes nucleophilic attack by thioredoxin. Thus, a redox-active 
disulfide may be introduced into a protein structure by stepwise mutation of two 
residues in the native sequence to Cys. By extension, evolutionary acquisition 
of structural disulfides in proteins can potentially occur via transition 
through a redox-active disulfide state.

Advances in healthcare and in the quality of life significantly increase human 
life expectancy. With the aging of populations, new un-faced challenges are 
brought to science. The human body is naturally selected to be well-functioning 
until the age of reproduction to keep the species alive. However, as the 
lifespan extends, unseen problems due to the body deterioration emerge. There 
are several age-related diseases with no appropriate treatment; therefore, the 
complex aging phenomena needs further understanding. It is known that 
immunosenescence is highly correlated to the negative effects of aging. In this 
work we advocate the use of simulation as a tool to assist the understanding of 
immune aging phenomena. In particular, we are comparing system dynamics 
modelling and simulation (SDMS) and agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) 
for the case of age-related depletion of naive T cells in the organism. We 
address the following research questions: Which simulation approach is more 
suitable for this problem? Can these approaches be employed interchangeably? Is 
there any benefit of using one approach compared to the other? Results show that 
both simulation outcomes closely fit the observed data and existing mathematical 
model; and the likely contribution of each of the naive T cell repertoire 
maintenance method can therefore be estimated. The differences observed in the 
outcomes of both approaches are due to the probabilistic character of ABMS 
contrasted to SDMS. However, they do not interfere in the overall expected 
dynamics of the populations. In this case, therefore, they can be employed 
interchangeably, with SDMS being simpler to implement and taking less 
computational resources.

Since dialysis withdrawal in maintenance dialysis patients with limited life 
expectancy results always in short-term death, nephrologists need a referenced 
process to make their decision. This study reviews 8 years of operation of an 
Ethics Committee in Nephrology (ECN). The ECN, within a multidisciplinary team, 
once a month explores cases reported by caregivers when maintaining dialysis 
seems not to be in the patient's best interest. Discussion is required when the 
vital prognosis is engaged by the evolution of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
or the occurrence of an acute medical event. Data are analyzed using a 
discussion guide. The informed decision is completed with an appropriated 
palliative care project involving the patient, and recorded in their file. Since 
2006, the ECN has deliberated yearly for 10 sessions on 6-18 cases, concerning 
380 identified maintenance dialysis patients. Characteristics of the population, 
cases, sessions and proposals are recorded and analyzed. The only variable 
associated with dialysis withdrawal was having at least one new comorbid 
condition. End of life is supported with the help of the palliative care team in 
the hospital or exceptionally at home. The ECN, through a multidisciplinary 
deliberation and resolution process, proposes an ethical shared-decision-making 
model ensuring that dialysis withdrawal follows professional guidelines, and is 
registered as a method for evaluating professional practice (EPP). Annual 
activity reports are submitted to the Hospital's Medical Evaluation and Quality 
Unit. Benefits are individual and collective for patients, relatives and 
caregivers. Prospects for reducing non-implemented decisions and identifying 
cases earlier would improve the Committee effectiveness.

The molecular mechanisms behind aging-related declines in muscle function are 
not well understood, but the growth factor myostatin (MSTN) appears to play an 
important role in this process. Additionally, epidemiological studies have 
identified a positive correlation between skeletal muscle mass and longevity. 
Given the role of myostatin in regulating muscle size, and the correlation 
between muscle mass and longevity, we tested the hypotheses that the deficiency 
of myostatin would protect oldest-old mice (28-30 months old) from an 
aging-related loss in muscle size and contractility, and would extend the 
maximum lifespan of mice. We found that MSTN(+/-) and MSTN(-/-) mice were 
protected from aging-related declines in muscle mass and contractility. While no 
differences were detected between MSTN(+/+) and MSTN(-/-) mice, MSTN(+/-) mice 
had an approximately 15% increase in maximal lifespan. These results suggest 
that targeting myostatin may protect against aging-related changes in skeletal 
muscle and contribute to enhanced longevity.

PURPOSE: To provide evidence that medical education is associated with 
population health in order to support adaptation of medical school programs to 
address populations with health disparities. We explored medical education 
efforts, local physician supply, and life expectancy in Alabama.
METHODS: County-level public data of the number of students accepted to medical 
schools in 2008 and 2011, primary care physicians, life expectancy, and 
demographic/contextual variables were analyzed to develop a model for 
hypothesized associations. Correlational analysis, ANCOVA modeling, and path 
analysis were employed to identify, reduce, and organize significant variables 
in this cross-sectional ecologic study.
FINDINGS: The path model, which met criteria for goodness of fit, found 
significant relationships among medical students per 10,000 population, primary 
care physicians per 10,000 population, life expectancy, and contextual variables 
for rurality and poverty. ANCOVA models showed that geographic region was 
significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Within limitations of the study design, these findings support the 
proposition that the number of medical students produced in a county is related 
to the number of primary care physicians, which is related to life expectancy. 
Recommendations are to confirm the findings in other populations and inform 
public health policy concerning the utility of medical education to address 
population health by producing local medical students.

Forkhead box O (Foxo) transcription factors may be involved in the salutary 
effect of dietary restriction (DR). This study examined the role of Foxo3 in 
lifespan extension and cancer suppression in DR mice. Wild-type (WT) and 
Foxo3-knockout heterozygous ((+/-) ) and homozygous ((-/-) ) mice were subjected 
to a 30% DR regimen initiated at 12 weeks of age. Control mice were fed ad 
libitum (AL) throughout the study. In contrast to WT mice, DR did not 
significantly extend the lifespan of Foxo3(+/-) or Foxo3(-/-) mice. However, DR 
reduced the prevalence of tumors at death in WT, Foxo3(+/-) , and Foxo3(-/-) 
mice. These results indicate the necessity of Foxo3 for lifespan extension but 
not cancer suppression by DR. The findings in Foxo3(+/-) mice contrast with 
those in Foxo1(+/-) mice reported previously by our laboratory suggest 
differential regulation of cancer and lifespan by DR via Foxo1 and Foxo3.

Approximations for Estimating Change in Life Expectancy Attributable to Air 
Pollution in Relation to Multiple Causes of Death Using a Cause Modified Life

There is considerable debate as to the most appropriate metric for 
characterizing the mortality impacts of air pollution. Life expectancy has been 
advocated as an informative measure. Although the life-table calculus is 
relatively straightforward, it becomes increasingly cumbersome when repeated 
over large numbers of geographic areas and for multiple causes of death. Two 
simplifying assumptions were evaluated: linearity of the relation between excess 
rate ratio and change in life expectancy, and additivity of cause-specific 
life-table calculations. We employed excess rate ratios linking PM2.5 and 
mortality from cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
ischemic heart disease, and lung cancer derived from a meta-analysis of 
worldwide cohort studies. As a sensitivity analysis, we employed an integrated 
exposure response function based on the observed risk of PM2.5 over a wide range 
of concentrations from ambient exposure, indoor exposure, second-hand smoke, and 
personal smoking. Impacts were estimated in relation to a change in PM2.5 from 
19.5 μg/m(3) estimated for Toronto to an estimated natural background 
concentration of 1.8 μg/m(3) . Estimated changes in life expectancy varied 
linearly with excess rate ratios, but at higher values the relationship was more 
accurately represented as a nonlinear function. Changes in life expectancy 
attributed to specific causes of death were additive with maximum error of 10%. 
Results were sensitive to assumptions about the air pollution concentration 
below which effects on mortality were not quantified. We have demonstrated valid 
approximations comprising expression of change in life expectancy as a function 
of excess mortality and summation across multiple causes of death.

Tuberculosis among older adults--time to take notice.

Knowledge that older people are vulnerable to develop tuberculosis is rarely 
considered in developing country settings. According to 2010 Global Burden of 
Disease estimates, the majority of tuberculosis-related deaths occurred among 
people older than 50; most in those aged 65 and above. Older people also 
contribute a large proportion of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs); 51% of 
tuberculosis DALYs occurred in patients aged 50 years and older in East Asia. 
Tuberculosis age distributions in Africa have been severely skewed by the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, but emerging data suggest increasing 
disease burdens among older people. Older adults are more likely to develop 
extra-pulmonary and atypical forms of disease that are often harder to diagnose 
than conventional sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. Their care is 
complicated by more frequent drug-related adverse events and increased 
co-morbidity, which may prove difficult to manage in regions where health 
resources are already constrained. Health systems will have to confront the 
challenge of an ageing global population and the integrated services required to 
address their health needs.

BACKGROUND: Rapid increases in life expectancy have led to concurrent increases 
in the number of elderly people living alone or those forced to change living 
situations. Previous studies have found that poor dietary intake was common in 
elderly people living alone. However, there have been few studies about the 
dietary intake in elderly people living in other situations, particularly those 
living with family other than a spouse (nonspouse family), which is common in 
Japan.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the differences in dietary intake by different living 
situations in elderly Japanese people. We analyzed the data of 1542 healthy 
residents in the town of Ohasama aged 60 years and over who had completed 
self-administered questionnaires.
METHODS: The dietary intake was measured using a validated 141-item food 
frequency questionnaire. Multiple regression models with robust 
(White-corrected) standard errors were individually fitted for nutrients and 
foods by living situation.
RESULTS: In men, although the presence of other family was correlated with 
significantly lower intake of protein-related foods, e.g., legumes, fish and 
shellfish, and dairy products, these declines were more serious in men living 
with nonspouse family. Conversely, in men living alone the intake of fruits and 
vegetables was significantly lower. In women, lower intakes of fruit and 
protein-related foods were significantly more common in participants living with 
nonspouse family than those living with only a spouse.
CONCLUSION: These findings revealed that elderly people living alone as well as 
those living with family other than a spouse had poor dietary intake, suggesting 
that strategies to improve food choices and skills for food preparation could 
promote of healthy eating in elderly Japanese people.

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the present systematic review and 
meta-analysis was to synthesize the available literature relating to leucine 
supplementation in the elderly with respect to its effects on anthropometrical 
parameters and muscle strength. The secondary aim was to perform a selective 
subgroup analysis when possible differentiating between healthy and sarcopenic 
subjects.
METHODS: Literature search was performed using the electronic databases MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, SportDiscus, and the Cochrane Central Register of trials with 
restrictions to randomized controlled trials or studies following a cross-over 
design. Parameters taken into account were body weight, body mass index, lean 
body mass, fat mass, percentage of body fat, hand grip strength, and knee 
extension strength. Moreover, biomarkers of glucose metabolism (fasting glucose, 
fasting insulin, albumin, and HOMA index) were extracted when possible. For each 
outcome measure of interest, a meta-analysis was performed in order to determine 
the pooled effect of the intervention in terms of weighted mean differences 
between the post-intervention (or differences in means) values of the leucine 
and the respective control groups. Data analysis was performed using the Review 
Manager 5.2.4. software.
RESULTS: A total of 16 studies enrolling 999 subjects met the inclusion 
criteria. Compared with control groups, leucine supplementation significantly 
increased gain in body weight [mean differences 1.02 kg, 95%-CI (0.19, 1.85), 
p=0.02], lean body mass [mean differences 0.99 kg, 95%-CI (0.43, 1.55), 
p=0.0005], and body mass index [mean differences 0.33 kg/m2, 95%-CI (0.13, 
0.53), p=0.001], when compared to the respective control groups. With respect to 
body weight and lean body mass, leucine supplementation turned out to be more 
effective in the subgroup of study participants with manifested sarcopenia. All 
other parameters under investigation were not affected by leucine 
supplementation in a fashion significantly different from controls.
CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that leucine supplementation was found to exert 
beneficial effects on body weight, body mass index, and lean body mass in older 
persons in those subjects already prone to sarcopenia, but not muscle strength. 
However, due to the heterogeneity between the trials included in this systematic 
review, further studies adopting a homogenous design with respect to participant 
characteristics duration as well as the kind and amount of daily supplement in 
use are required.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate whether the effects of providing or receiving social 
support are more beneficial to reduce mortality risk among the elderly with 
different educational levels.
METHODS: In this long-term prospective cohort study, data were retrieved from 
the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging. This study was initiated from 1996 until 
2007. The complete data from 1492 males and 1177 females aged ≥67 years were 
retrieved. Participants received financial, instrumental, and emotional support, 
and they actively provided instrumental and emotional support to others and 
involved in social engagement. Education attainment was divided into two levels: 
high and low. The low education level included illiterate and elementary school. 
The high education level included junior high school to senior high school and 
above college. Cox regression analysis was used to examine the association 
between providing or receiving social support on mortality with different 
educational levels.
RESULTS: The average age of the participants in 1996 was 73.0 (IQR=8.0) years, 
and the median survival following years (1996-2007) of participants was 10.3 
(IQR=6.7) years. Most participants were low educational level including 
illiterate (39.3%) and elementary school (41.2%). Participants with high 
educational level tend to be younger and more male significantly. On the 
contrary, participants with low educational level tend to have significant more 
poor income, more depression, more cognition impairment, more with IADL and ADL 
disability than high educational level. Most participants received instrumental 
support from others (95.5%) and also provided emotional support to others 
(97.7%). Providing instrumental support can reduce 17% of mortality risk among 
the elderly with a low level of education after adjusting several covariates 
[Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.70-0.99; p = 0.036].
CONCLUSIONS: Providing instrumental social support to others confer benefits to 
the giver and prolong life expectancy among the elderly with low educational 
levels.

DNA markers play important roles in plant breeding and genetics. The 
Insertion/Deletion (InDel) marker is one kind of co-dominant DNA markers widely 
used due to its low cost and high precision. However, the canonical way of 
searching for InDel markers is time-consuming and labor-intensive. We developed 
an end-to-end computational solution (InDel Markers Development Platform, IMDP) 
to identify genome-wide InDel markers under a graphic pipeline environment. IMDP 
constitutes assembled genome sequences alignment pipeline (AGA-pipe) and 
next-generation re-sequencing data mapping pipeline (NGS-pipe). With AGA-pipe we 
are able to identify 12,944 markers between the genome of rice cultivars 
Nipponbare and 93-11. Using NGS-pipe, we reported 34,794 InDels from 
re-sequencing data of rice cultivars Wu-Yun-Geng7 and Guang-Lu-Ai4. Combining 
AGA-pipe and NGS-pipe, we developed 205,659 InDels in eight japonica and nine 
indica cultivars and 2,681 InDels showed a subgroup-specific pattern. Polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) analysis of subgroup-specific markers indicated that the 
precision reached 90% (86 of 95). Finally, to make them available to the public, 
we have integrated the InDels/markers information into a website (Rice InDel 
Marker Database, RIMD, http://202.120.45.71/). The application of IMDP in rice 
will facilitate efficiency for development of genome-wide InDel markers, in 
addition it can be used in other species with reference genome sequences and NGS 
data.

Comment in
    BJU Int. 2015 Dec;116(6):834-5.

Elderly men are more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive cancer, but are 
often inappropriately denied curative treatment. Biological rather than 
chronological age should be used to decide if a patient will profit from radical 
treatment. Therefore, every man aged >70 years should undergo a health 
assessment using a validated tool before making treatment decisions. Fit elderly 
men with intermediate- or high-risk disease should be offered standard curative 
local treatment in keeping with guidelines for younger men. Vulnerable and frail 
elderly men warrant geriatric intervention before treatment. In the case of 
vulnerable patients, this intervention may render them suitable for standard 
care. When considering radical prostatectomy outcomes a 'bifecta' of oncological 
control and continence is appropriate, as erectile dysfunction (although 
prevalent) has a much smaller impact on quality of life than in younger 
patients. Radiotherapy is an alternative to radical prostatectomy in men with a 
life expectancy of <10 years. Primary androgen-deprivation therapy is not 
associated with improved survival in localised prostate cancer and should only 
be used for symptom palliation. Further elderly-specific research is needed to 
guide prostate cancer care.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease impacts the physical, emotional and 
psychological aspects of life of the affected persons, often times exposing them 
to disease associated stigma from the society and alters the health related 
quality of life (HRQoL). This study compared the HRQoL of adolescents with 
sickle cell disease with their healthy peers, identified socio-demographic and 
clinical factors impacting HRQoL, and determined the extent and effects of SCD 
related stigma on quality of life.
PROCEDURE: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 160 adolescents, 80 with 
SCD and 80 adolescents without SCD. Socio-demographic and clinical data were 
collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. HRQoL was investigated using the 
Short Form (SF-36v2) Health Survey. SCD perceived stigma was measured using an 
adaptation of a perceived stigma questionnaire.
RESULTS: Adolescents with SCD have significantly worse HRQoL than their peers in 
all of the most important dimensions of HRQoL (physical functioning, physical 
roles limitation, emotional roles limitation, social functioning, bodily pain, 
vitality and general health perception) except mental health. Recent hospital 
admission and SCD related complication further lowered HRQoL scores. Over 
seventy percent of adolescents with SCD have moderate to high level of 
perception of stigmatisation. Hospitalisation, SCD complication, SCD stigma were 
inversely, and significantly associated with HRQoL.
CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents living with SCD in Nigeria have lower health related 
quality of life compared to their healthy peers. They also experience stigma 
that impacts their HRQoL. Complications of SCD and hospital admissions 
contribute significantly to this impairment.

Comment on
    J Family Med Prim Care. 4(1):3.

Dentistry is neither an allied health profession nor a paramedical profession. 
It is the only anatomically focused health care profession that is 
university-based and for which primary care responsibility is maintained by the 
profession. Dentists must have a reliable knowledge of basic clinical medicine 
for safely and effectively treating individuals with chronic and other diseases, 
which make them biologically and pharmacologically compromised. With changes in 
the life expectancy of people and lifestyles, as well as rapid advancement in 
biomedical sciences, dentists should have similar knowledge like a physician in 
any other fields of medicine. There are number of primary care activities that 
can be conducted in the dental office like screening of diabetics, managing 
hypertension etc., The present review was conducted after doing extensive 
literature search of peer-reviewed journals. The review throws a spotlight on 
these activities and also suggests some the measures that can be adopted to 
modify dental education to turn dentists to oral physicians.

Waves of globalization reflect the historical technical progress and modern 
economic growth. The dynamics of this process are here approached using the 
multidimensional scaling (MDS) methodology to analyze the evolution of GDP per 
capita, international trade openness, life expectancy, and education tertiary 
enrollment in 14 countries. MDS provides the appropriate theoretical concepts 
and the exact mathematical tools to describe the joint evolution of these 
indicators of economic growth, globalization, welfare and human development of 
the world economy from 1977 up to 2012. The polarization dance of countries 
enlightens the convergence paths, potential warfare and present-day rivalries in 
the global geopolitical scene.

[Fertility in testicular cancer patients].

[Article in Japanese]

Testicular cancer(TC)is the most common and curable cancer affecting men of 
reproductive age. Successful treatment approaches have resulted in longer life 
expectancy in TC survivors. The most frequently used treatment for TC is a 
combination of inguinal orchiectomy, and either radiotherapy or cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy. In many TC patients, sperm quality is already abnormal and there 
may even be a lack of viable spermatozoa at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, 
the effect of cancer treatment on fertility is a potentially significant issue. 
Fertility preservation in these men has become essential and needs to be 
discussed prior to the start of cancer treatment. The only currently established 
fertility preservation method is the cryopreservation of sperm before therapy. 
For most patients seeking cryopreservation, the semen sample is collected via 
masturbation. If the patient is unable to ejaculate for any reason, other 
techniques such as vibratory stimulation and electroejaculation can be 
performed. In azoospermic or severely oligozoospermic patients, testicular sperm 
extraction at the time of the inguinal orchiectomy is a useful technique for 
obtaining spermatozoa before cytotoxic therapy. We herein present an overview of 
the current topics on fertility in TC patients, including the effects of 
surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. We also describe the strategy for 
fertility preservation in these patients.

Surgical bypass has traditionally been the gold standard for treating critical 
limb ischemia caused by isolated infrapopliteal arterial disease (IP CLI). 
However, as endovascular techniques continue to progress, they are increasingly 
applied to this patient population, especially to the high-risk surgical cohort 
or patients with limited surgical options. This enthusiasm to employ 
endovascular interventions in IP CLI is accompanied by persistent controversies, 
as demonstrated in the recent literature. Percutaneous transluminal balloon 
angioplasty has been the predominant endovascular intervention applied to treat 
IP CLI and recent literature supports its role. The durability of percutaneous 
transluminal balloon angioplasty is limited, and thus this intervention is 
recommended for high-risk patients with limited life expectancy. Bare-metal 
stents for IP CLI currently do not have supportive data to warrant their use as 
a primary treatment. Newer drug-eluting stents improve patency and prevent 
restenosis, but they do not significantly improve patient clinical status 
compared with bare-metal stents alone. Drug-coated balloons are still relatively 
new tools in this arena and evidence of their safety and clear efficacy are 
still lacking. The data on atherectomy, in all of its forms, for IP CLI are 
overall variable, without any clear benefit to justify its increased 
complication risks and costs over other modalities. Use of retrograde 
tibial/pedal access for treating IP CLI as a viable alternative to antegrade 
access and treatment from a totally retrograde approach has recently been 
described. Level I evidence to aid in clarifying the true efficacy for each of 
these endovascular modalities is greatly needed. As we await these data, we must 
remember that, as with any arterial intervention, proper patient selection is 
extremely important and the intervention, whether endovascular or open surgical 
repair, should be tailored to the individual patient's anatomy and disease 
characteristics.

BACKGROUND: Many elderly men with high-risk nonmetastatic prostate cancer 
(HRnMPCa) do not receive radical treatment, despite the high mortality 
associated with conservative management.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate how age and comorbidity affect treatment of men with 
HRnMPCa.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an observational nationwide register 
study during 2001-2012. We identified 19 190 men of <80 yr of age diagnosed with 
HRnMPCa in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden and 95 948 
age-matched men without prostate cancer in the register of the total population.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The outcome was the proportion of 
men with HRnMPCa receiving radical treatment (radical prostatectomy or 
radiotherapy). Vital status and the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) were 
obtained from nationwide registers. The 10-yr survival of men without prostate 
cancer, stratified by age and CCI, was used as a measure of the life expectancy 
of the men with prostate cancer.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The proportions receiving radical treatment varied with 
life expectancy among men younger than 70 yr, whereas use of these treatments 
did not match the long life expectancy of men in their seventies with CCI 0-1. 
Only 10% of men aged 75-80 yr with CCI 0 received radical treatment despite 52% 
probability of 10-yr life expectancy, compared with approximately half of the 
men younger than 70 yr with a similar life expectancy. The use of radical 
treatment for HRnMPCa increased with time in all Swedish counties, but a 
threefold difference between counties remained in 2009-2012 for patients aged 
70-80 yr with CCI 0-1. Uncertain external validity is a study limitation, and 
the impact of physician versus patient preferences on treatment selection could 
not be assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: Otherwise healthy men in their seventies with HRnMPCa were less 
likely to receive radical treatment than younger men with a similar life 
expectancy, although increasing use of radical treatment was observed during the 
study period. Our findings highlight the need for improved methods for clinical 
decision-making, including improved assessment of life expectancy.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We performed a nationwide register study that showed that many 
healthy men in their seventies live for at least another 10 yr. Despite this 
long life expectancy, men in their seventies with high-risk nonmetastatic 
prostate cancer were often not treated with radical prostatectomy or 
radiotherapy, possibly because their life expectancy was underestimated. Our 
study highlights the need for improved clinical decision-making, which should 
incorporate an assessment of the patient's life expectancy.
