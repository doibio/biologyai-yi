decades after the completion of the therapy. The most common anticancer 
therapies that can cause adverse cardiovascular effects include chemotherapy-in 
particular anthracyclines, human epidermal growth receptor 2 targeted drugs and 
radiation therapy. A new field of research, cardio-oncology, addresses this 
increasing risk, screening, diagnosis and prevention. This review aims to 
present the most relevant reports regarding the adverse cardiac effects of 
oncological therapy, including the most prevalent types of cardiotoxicity, 
methods of pre-treatment screening and indications for prevention therapy.

BACKGROUND: Patients' treatment decisions may be influenced by the ways in which 
treatment options are presented. There is little evidence on how patients with 
advanced cancer choose preferences for advance directives (ADs) in China. 
Informed by behavioural economics, we assess whether end-of-life (EOL) cancer 
patients held deep-seated preferences for their health care and whether default 
options and order effects influenced their decision-making.
METHODS: We collected data on 179 advanced cancer patients who were randomly 
assigned to complete one of the four types of ADs: comfort-oriented care (CC) AD 
(comfort default AD); a life extension (LE)-oriented care option (LE default 
AD); CC (standard CC AD) and LE-oriented (standard LE AD). Analysis of variance 
test was used.
RESULTS: In terms of the general goal of care, 32.6% of patients in the comfort 
default AD group retained the comfort-oriented choice, twice as many as in the 
standard CC group without default options. Order effect was significant in only 
two individual-specific palliative care choices. Most patients (65.9%) appointed 
their children to make EOL care decisions, but patients choosing the CC goal 
were twice as likely to ask their family members to adhere to their choices than 
patients who chose the LE goal.
CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced cancer did not hold deep-seated preferences 
for EOL care. Default options shaped decisions between CC and LE-oriented care. 
Order effect only shaped decisions in some specific treatment targets. The 
structure of ADs matters and influence different treatment outcomes, including 
the role of palliative care.
PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Between August and November 2018, from 640 
cancer hospital medical records fitting the selection criteria at a 3A level 
hospital in Shandong Province, we randomly selected 188 terminal EOL advanced 
cancer patients using a random generator programme to ensure all eligible 
patients had an equal chance of selection. Each respondent completes one of the 
four AD surveys. While respondents might require support in making their 
healthcare choices, they were informed about the purpose of our research study, 
and that their survey choices would not affect their actual treatment plan. 
Patients who did not agree to participate were not surveyed.

BACKGROUND: Research has found that patients with suicidal ideation (SI) are at 
high risk for unfavorable outcomes. The present work aimed to expand the 
knowledge about their characteristics and treatment success.
METHODS: Data were drawn from a routine assessment of N = 460 inpatients. We 
used patients' self-report data as well as therapists' reports covering baseline 
characteristics, depression and anxiety symptoms (at the start and end of 
therapy), psychosocial stress factors, helping alliance, treatment motivation, 
and treatment-related control expectancies. In addition to group comparisons, we 
conducted tests of associations with treatment outcome.
RESULTS: SI was reported by 232 patients (50.4% of the sample). It co-occurred 
with higher symptom burden, more psychosocial stress factors, and negation of 
help. Patients reporting SI were more likely to be dissatisfied with the 
treatment outcome (although their therapists were not). SI was related to higher 
levels of anxiety symptoms after treatment. In regression models of depression 
and anxiety symptoms, interactions of SI with the external control expectancy 
powerful others were observed, suggesting that in patients with frequent SI, 
this control expectancy hindered recovery.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Patients reporting SI are a vulnerable group. Therapists 
could support them by addressing (potentially conflicting) motivations and 
control expectancies.

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) have been shown to 
improve outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients but are associated 
with an increased risk of hyperkalemia in this vulnerable population. 
Hyperkalemia often leads to patients' downtitrating or discontinuing RAASi which 
can result in sub-optimal health outcomes. The objective is to evaluate the cost 
and health benefits of maintaining normokalemia using patiromer, an oral 
potassium binder while optimizing RAASi therapy in CKD patients in the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia. The medium-to long-term costs and health outcomes of patients 
with CKD stage 3-4 and raised serum potassium levels (≥5.5 mmol/L) at baseline 
were estimated, from a Saudi Arabia payer perspective, using a Markov 
state-transition model simulating the natural progression of CKD depending on 
patients' serum potassium level and usage of RAASi at different dosages. The 
analysis demonstrated that appropriate management of hyperkalemia, enabling 
optimization of RAASi, leads to cost and health benefits. The cost of patiromer 
is offset by 68% due to a reduction in management costs associated with CKD 
progression, hyperkalemia-related hospitalization, and cardiovascular (CV) 
events. Over a 10-year time horizon, a pool of 300 patients treated with 
patiromer experience increased life-expectancy [+3.78 life-years (LYs)] and 
slower disease progression, with decreased time spent in end-stage renal disease 
(-9.59 LYs). Patiromer may deliver value to both CKD patients and payers in 
Saudi Arabia, leading to better health outcomes for the former and reduced cost 
of management of CKD progression and CV events at low additional costs for the 
latter.

Japan is experiencing a super-ageing society faster than anywhere else in the 
world. Consequently, extending healthy life expectancy is an urgent social 
issue. To realize a diet that can support the extension of healthy life 
expectancy, we studied the quantitative relationships among physical activities 
(number of steps and activity calculated using an accelerometer), physical 
functions (muscle strength, movement function, agility, static balance, dynamic 
balance, and walking function), and dietary intake among 469 older adults living 
in the Tokyo metropolitan area (65-75 years old; 303 women and 166 men) from 23 
February 2017 to 31 March 2018. Physical activities and functions were 
instrumentally measured, and the dietary survey adopted the photographic record 
method. There was a significant positive association (p < 0.05) between physical 
activities (steps, medium-intensity activity, and high-intensity activity) and 
physical functions (movement function, static balance, and walking function), 
but no association with muscle strength. These three physical functions were 
significantly positively correlated with intake of vegetables, seeds, fruits, 
and milk; with magnesium, potassium, and vitamin B6; and with the dietary 
fibre/carbohydrate composition ratio (p < 0.05). Future intervention trials must 
verify if balancing diet and nutrition can improve physical activities in older 
adults through increased physical functions.

There are great variations between population subgroups, notably in poorer 
countries, leading to substantial inconsistencies with those predicted by the 
classical epidemiologic transition theory. In this context, using public data, 
we aimed to determine how the singular case of French Guiana fit and 
transitioned in the epidemiologic transition framework. The data show a gradual 
decline in infant mortality to values above 8 per 1000 live births. Premature 
mortality rates were greater but declined more rapidly in French Guiana than in 
mainland France until 2017 when they reascended in a context of political 
turmoil followed by the COVID-19 pandemic and strong reluctance to get 
vaccinated. Although infections were a more frequent cause of death in French 
Guiana, there is a marked decline and circulatory and metabolic causes are major 
causes of premature death. Fertility rates remain high (>3 live births per 
woman), and the age structure of the population is still pyramid-shaped. The 
singularities of French Guiana (rich country, universal health system, 
widespread poverty) explain why its transition does not fit neatly within the 
usual stages of transition. Beyond gradual improvements in secular trends, the 
data also suggest that political turmoil and fake news may have detrimentally 
affected mortality in French Guiana and reversed improving trends.

We conducted a clinical veterinary study on neutron capture therapy (NCT) at a 
neutron-producing accelerator with seven incurable pets with spontaneous tumors 
and gadolinium as a neutron capture agent (gadolinium neutron capture therapy, 
or GdNCT). Gadolinium-containing dimeglumine gadopentetate, or Gd-DTPA 
(Magnevist®, 0.6 mL/kg b.w.), was used. We observed mild and reversible toxicity 
related to the treatment. However, no significant tumor regression in response 
to the treatment was observed. In most cases, there was continued tumor growth. 
Overall clinical improvement after treatment was only temporary. The use of 
Gd-DTPA for NCT had no significant effects on the life expectancy and quality of 
life of animals with spontaneous tumors. Further experiments using more advanced 
gadolinium compounds are needed to improve the effect of GdNCT so that it can 
become an alternative to boron neutron capture therapy. Such studies are also 
necessary for further NCT implementation in clinical practice as well as in 
veterinary medicine.

The life expectancy of our pets has been getting longer in recent years due to 
new therapeutic opportunities, better nutrition, and better diagnostic 
approaches. This positive effect, however, has been accompanied by a concomitant 
increase in neoplasms, particularly in canine patients. Therefore, veterinarians 
inevitably face new issues related to these diseases, poorly or never 
investigated in the past, such as the possible side effects resulting from 
chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how 
chemotherapy influences the antibody response against CPV-2, CDV, and CAdV-1 in 
dogs vaccinated before starting chemotherapy. Twenty-one canine patients with 
different types of malignancies were sampled before, during, and after different 
chemotherapy protocols to determine their actual levels of seroprotection 
against CPV-2, CDV, and CadV-1 by using the in-practice test VacciCheck. 
Differences related to sex, breed size, type of tumor, and chemotherapy protocol 
were evaluated. No statistically significant changes in antibody protection 
emerged for any of the chemotherapy protocol used, suggesting that, contrary to 
expectation, chemotherapy does not have a marked immunosuppressive effect on the 
post-vaccine antibody response. These results, although preliminary, may be 
useful in improving the clinical approach to the canine cancer patient, helping 
veterinarians fully manage their patients, and enabling owners to feel more 
confident about their pets' quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Standard of care for adjuvant treatment of stage III endometrial 
cancer includes chemotherapy and radiation. In addition to stage, tumor 
molecular profiles may predict treatment outcomes, and prospective clinical 
trials are ongoing. However, tumor molecular testing is costly and 
time-consuming. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tumor 
molecular testing in stage III endometrial cancer.
METHODS: A Markov decision model compared two strategies for stage III 
endometrial cancer: Tumor Molecular Testing (TMT) versus No TMT. TMT included 
sequential POLE next generation sequencing, mismatch repair immunohistochemistry 
(IHC), and p53 IHC. POLE-mutated patients were assigned to adjuvant radiation 
therapy; all others including controls were assigned to adjuvant chemoradiation. 
First recurrences were treated with 6 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel. 
Second recurrences were treated with pembrolizumab alone for mismatch repair 
deficient patients and both pembrolizumab and lenvatinib for other patients. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to test model robustness.
RESULTS: Compared to No TMT, TMT was cost saving with equivalent effectiveness. 
On one-way sensitivity analysis, TMT remained cost saving over all parameter 
ranges. TMT was also favored on probabilistic sensitivity analysis in 80% of 
iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained. However, when TMT was compared to mismatch repair IHC 
alone, TMT cost $182,798/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: In this model of patients with stage III endometrial cancer, TMT 
was cost saving compared to No TMT. However, when compared to mismatch repair 
IHC alone, TMT was economically unfavorable.

Treatment after failure of frontline therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia in 
chronic phase including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

University Hospital, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

The treatment outcomes of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) 
have dramatically improved with comparable life-expectancy to average of general 
population in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) era. However, less than a half of 
patients who started with TKI can remain on frontline TKI. The reasons of 
switching TKI can be either intolerance or the lack of efficacy. Although a 
kinase domain (KD) mutation can guide to select salvage TKI from the point of 
view on the efficacy of TKIs, many factors need to be considered before choosing 
next-line TKI such as the high-risk features of CML, the adverse events with 
prior TKI, and the comorbidities of patients. The therapeutic options for CML-CP 
after failing frontline TKI due to treatment failure or suboptimal responses 
will be reviewed including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

OBJECTIVE: Examine the association between country-level gender social norms and 
(1) cardiovascular disease mortality rates; (2) female to male cardiovascular 
disease mortality ratios; and (3) life expectancy.
DESIGN: Ecological study with the country as the unit of analysis.
SETTING: Global, country-level data.
PARTICIPANTS: Global population of countries with data available on gender 
social norms as measured by the Gender Social Norms Index (developed by the 
United Nations Development Programme).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Country-level female and male age-standardised 
cardiovascular disease mortality rates, population age-standardised 
cardiovascular disease mortality rates, female to male cardiovascular disease 
mortality ratios, female and male life expectancy at birth. Outcome measure data 
were retrieved from the WHO and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. 
Multivariable linear regression models were fitted to explore the relationship 
between gender social norms and the outcome variables.
RESULTS: Higher levels of biased gender social norms, as measured by the Gender 
Social Norms Index, were associated with higher female, male and population 
cardiovascular disease mortality rates in the multivariable models (β 4.86, 95% 
CIs 3.18 to 6.54; β 5.28, 95% CIs 3.42 to 7.15; β 4.89, 95% CIs 3.18 to 6.60), 
and lower female and male life expectancy (β -0.07, 95% CIs -0.11 to -0.03; β 
-0.05, 95% CIs -0.10 to -0.01). These results included adjustment within the 
models for potentially confounding country-level factors including gross 
domestic product per capita, population mean years of schooling, physicians per 
1000 population, year of Gender Social Norms Index data collection and maternal 
mortality ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that higher levels of biased gender social 
norms are associated with higher rates of population cardiovascular disease 
mortality and lower life expectancy for both sexes. Future research should 
explore this relationship further, to define its causal role and promote public 
health action.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that 
is useful for identifying normal developmental and aging processes and for data 
sharing. Marmosets have a relatively shorter life expectancy than other 
primates, including humans, because they grow and age faster. Therefore, the 
common marmoset model is effective in aging research. The current study 
investigated the aging process of the marmoset brain and provided an open MRI 
database of marmosets across a wide age range. The Brain/MINDS Marmoset Brain 
MRI Dataset contains brain MRI information from 216 marmosets ranging in age 
from 1 and 10 years. At the time of its release, it is the largest public 
dataset in the world. It also includes multi-contrast MRI images. In addition, 
91 of 216 animals have corresponding high-resolution ex vivo MRI datasets. Our 
MRI database, available at the Brain/MINDS Data Portal, might help to understand 
the effects of various factors, such as age, sex, body size, and fixation, on 
the brain. It can also contribute to and accelerate brain science studies 
worldwide.

BACKGROUND: Women's education is the base for faster economic growth, longer 
life expectancy, lower population growth, improved quality of life, and a high 
rate of investment return in developing countries. Historically, girls were 
denied opportunities for schooling in most of the regions and societies of 
Ethiopia. So this study targeted a multilevel analysis of women's education in 
Ethiopia using the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data.
METHODS: Secondary data on women's data sets were obtained from the 2016 
Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey. A population-based cross-sectional study 
design was used for the survey. The sampling technique used for the survey was 
the two-stage sampling technique, which is stratified in the first stage and 
equal probability systematic selection technique in the second stage. The 
multi-level ordinal logistic regression model was fitted to identify the 
determinants of women's education in Ethiopia.
RESULTS: Among the random sample of 17137 women, the majority, 65.6 percent were 
rural residents. Somali regional state (75.3 percent) and the capital city Addis 
Ababa (8.6 percent) had the highest and lowest percentages of women illiteracy 
respectively than the remaining administrative units of Ethiopia. The minimum 
values for the fit statistics and the indicative value of the intra-class 
correlation (68.3%) of the multilevel model showed its appropriateness to the 
data. Among the predictors in the final multilevel ordinal logistic regression 
analysis, women's age at first marriage, residence, and family's wealth index 
were significant predictors of women's education in Ethiopia. Moreover, the 
estimates from the random effect result revealed that there is more variation in 
women's education between the enumeration areas than within the enumeration 
areas.
CONCLUSION: A multi-level ordinal logistic regression analysis has determined 
higher-level differences in women's education that could not be addressed by a 
single-level approach. So, the application of standard models by ignoring this 
variation ought to embrace spurious results, then for such hierarchical data, 
multilevel modeling is recommended.

Application of date palm waste compost is quite beneficial in improving soil 
properties and crop growth. However, the effect of its application on soil 
microbial communities is less understood. High-throughput sequencing and 
quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) were used to evaluate the effect of compost 
application on the soil microbial composition in a barley field during the 
tillering, booting and ripening stages. The results showed that compost 
treatment had the highest bacterial and fungal abundance, and its application 
significantly altered the richness (Chao1 index) and α-diversity (Shannon index) 
of fungal and bacterial communities. The dominant bacterial phyla found in the 
samples were Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria while the dominant fungal orders 
were Ascomycota and Mortierellomycota. Interestingly, compost enriched the 
relative abundance of beneficial microorganisms such as Chaetomium, 
Actinobacteriota, Talaromyces and Mortierella and reduced those of harmful 
microorganisms such as Alternaria, Aspergillus and Neocosmospora. Functional 
prediction based on Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction 
of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) showed that amplicon sequence variant (ASV) 
sequences related to energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate 
metabolism were associated with compost-treated soil. Based on Fungi Functional 
Guild (FUNGuild), identified fungi community metabolic functions such as wood 
saprotroph, pathotroph, symbiotroph and endophyte were associated with 
compost-treated soil. Overall, compost addition could be considered as a 
sustainable practice for establishing a healthy soil microbiome and subsequently 
improving the soil quality and barley crop production.

In general, as the national standard of living and life expectancy of people 
increase, the health burden of cancer also increases. Prevention strategies, 
including the screening and investigation of the causes of cancer as well as the 
expansion of treatment infrastructure, are necessary. In this review, we 
discussed the management strategies for gastric and colorectal cancers in 
Uzbekistan. Gastrointestinal cancers can be significantly prevented by certain 
screening strategies such as endoscopic examination. Furthermore, as both cancer 
types are closely related to the eating habits and lifestyles of people in 
Uzbekistan, such causes should be investigated and prevented. Practical advice 
to increase the efficiency of treatment is included, considering the current 
situation in Uzbekistan. Data from South Korea, which has performed nationwide 
screening for two decades and has made progress in improving the prognosis of 
patients with gastrointestinal cancers, will be discussed as a literature 
control.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this scoping review are to estimate the prevalence 
of obesity and overweight in the Saudi community and in different age groups, 
genders, and geographical location, in addition to the change in prevalence over 
time.
METHODS: This scoping review of evidence was conducted in accordance with the 
Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews and was reported 
following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses 
extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The population of this 
review was categorized into four age groups: young adults (18-25 years), adults 
(26-45), (mid-life adults) (46-60) and old people (60+). Each group was then 
categorized by gender into males and females. We included studies of adults aged 
18 years and above. The pooled prevalence of obesity and overweight of the 
population, based on BMI, was estimated after stratification based on the age, 
gender, and geographical area. In addition, the change in the prevalence of 
obesity/overweight over time from 2011 to 2021 was investigated from the pooled 
data. The Metaprop program in Stata was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 39 studies with 640,952 participants were included in this 
review. The pooled prevalence of obesity and overweight in the age group of ≤25 
years old, including both genders, was 30%. However, it was higher in young 
males (40%) compared to young females (25%). The prevalence of obesity and 
overweight among young adults has dropped by over 40% between 2012 and 2021. The 
overall pooled prevalence rate of obesity and overweight in the age groups >25 
years old (adults, mid-life, and old people), including both genders, was 66%, 
with similar prevalence among males (68%) and females (71%). In addition, a 
similar prevalence was observed among both adult and old people (62% and 65%, 
respectively), but was higher in the mid-life group (76%). Furthermore, mid-life 
women had the highest prevalence among all groups (87%), compared to 77% among 
males in the same age group. The same difference in prevalence between the 
gender persisted in older females compared to older males (79% vs. 65%, 
respectively). There is a noticeable drop in the pooled prevalence of overweight 
and obesity among adults > 25 years old of over 28% between 2011 and 2021. There 
was no difference in the prevalence of obesity/overweight by geographical 
region.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the noticeable drop in the prevalence of obesity in the 
Saudi community, the prevalence of high BMI is high in Saudi Arabia irrespective 
of age, gender, or geographical location. Mid-life women have the highest 
prevalence of high BMI, which makes them the focus of a tailored strategy for 
intervention. Further research is needed to investigate which are the most 
effective interventions to address obesity in the country.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an umbrella term that encompasses several 
disabling neurodevelopmental conditions. These conditions are characterized by 
impaired manifestation in social and communication skills with repetitive and 
restrictive behaviors or interests. Thus far, there are no approved biomarkers 
for ASD screening and diagnosis; also, the current diagnosis depends heavily on 
a physician's assessment and family's awareness of ASD symptoms. Identifying 
blood proteomic biomarkers and performing deep blood proteome profiling could 
highlight common underlying dysfunctions between cases of ASD, given its 
heterogeneous nature, thus laying the foundation for large-scale blood-based 
biomarker discovery studies. This study measured the expression of 1196 serum 
proteins using proximity extension assay (PEA) technology. The screened serum 
samples included ASD cases (n = 91) and healthy controls (n = 30) between 6 and 
15 years of age. Our findings revealed 251 differentially expressed proteins 
between ASD and healthy controls, of which 237 proteins were significantly 
upregulated and 14 proteins were significantly downregulated. Machine learning 
analysis identified 15 proteins that could be biomarkers for ASD with an area 
under the curve (AUC) = 0.876 using support vector machine (SVM). Gene Ontology 
(GO) analysis of the top differentially expressed proteins (TopDE) and weighted 
gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA) revealed dysregulation of SNARE vesicular 
transport and ErbB pathways in ASD cases. Furthermore, correlation analysis 
showed that proteins from those pathways correlate with ASD severity. Further 
validation and verification of the identified biomarkers and pathways are 
warranted.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by 
dystrophin loss-notably within muscles and the central neurons system. DMD 
presents as cognitive weakness, progressive skeletal and cardiac muscle 
degeneration until pre-mature death from cardiac or respiratory failure. 
Innovative therapies have improved life expectancy; however, this is accompanied 
by increased late-onset heart failure and emergent cognitive degeneration. Thus, 
better assessment of dystrophic heart and brain pathophysiology is needed. 
Chronic inflammation is strongly associated with skeletal and cardiac muscle 
degeneration; however, neuroinflammation's role is largely unknown in DMD 
despite being prevalent in other neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we present an 
inflammatory marker translocator protein (TSPO) positron emission tomography 
(PET) protocol for in vivo concomitant assessment of immune cell response in 
hearts and brains of a dystrophin-deficient mouse model [mdx:utrn(+/-)]. 
Preliminary analysis of whole-body PET imaging using the TSPO radiotracer, 
[18F]FEPPA in four mdx:utrn(+/-) and six wildtype mice are presented with ex 
vivo TSPO-immunofluorescence tissue staining. The mdx:utrn(+/-) mice showed 
significant elevations in heart and brain [18F]FEPPA activity, which correlated 
with increased ex vivo fluorescence intensity, highlighting the potential of 
TSPO-PET to simultaneously assess presence of cardiac and neuroinflammation in 
dystrophic heart and brain, as well as in several organs within a DMD model.

White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a very large dsDNA virus. The accepted shape 
of the WSSV virion has been as ellipsoidal, with a tail-like extension. However, 
due to the scarcity of reliable references, the pathogenesis and morphogenesis 
of WSSV are not well understood. Here, we used transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) and cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) to address some knowledge 
gaps. We concluded that mature WSSV virions with a stout oval-like shape do not 
have tail-like extensions. Furthermore, there were two distinct ends in WSSV 
nucleocapsids: a portal cap and a closed base. A C14 symmetric structure of the 
WSSV nucleocapsid was also proposed, according to our Cryo-EM map. 
Immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) revealed that VP664 proteins, the main 
components of the 14 assembly units, form a ring-like architecture. Moreover, 
WSSV nucleocapsids were also observed to undergo unique helical dissociation. 
Based on these new results, we propose a novel morphogenetic pathway of WSSV.
