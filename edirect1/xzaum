Life expectancy is an important measure for health research and policymaking. 
Linking individual survey records to mortality data can overcome limitations in 
vital statistics data used to examine differential mortality by permitting the 
construction of death rates based on information collected from respondents at 
the time of interview and facilitating estimation of life expectancies for 
subgroups of interest. However, use of complex survey data linked to mortality 
data can complicate the estimation of standard errors. This paper presents a 
case study of approaches to variance estimation for life expectancies based on 
life tables, using the National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality Files. 
The approaches considered include application of Chiang's traditional method, 
which is straightforward but does not account for the complex design features of 
the data; balanced repeated replication (BRR), which is more complicated but 
accounts more fully for the design features; and compromise, 'hybrid' 
approaches, which can be less difficult to implement than BRR but still account 
partially for the design features. Two tentative conclusions are drawn. First, 
it is important to account for the effects of the complex sample design, at 
least within life-table age intervals. Second, accounting for the effects within 
age intervals but not across age intervals, as is done by the hybrid methods, 
can yield reasonably accurate estimates of standard errors, especially for 
subgroups of interest with more homogeneous characteristics among their members.

Leisure-time physical activity is associated with better health and a reduced 
risk of all-cause mortality. It is unclear if this association is also present 
with a high level of physical activity as it is found in professional athletes. 
In a population-based retrospective cohort study, we compared the survival 
experience of all soccer players participating for Germany in international 
matches between 1908 and 2006 to that of the general population. To summarize 
survival experience, we calculated cumulative relative survival ratios (RSRs) 
from a life table. We included data of 812 international players, of which 428 
(=52.7%) died during follow-up. In all 13 intervals, cumulative observed 
survival was smaller than cumulative expected survival, resulting in cumulative 
RSRs being <1. The cumulative RSRs are statistically significantly different 
from 1 in all but the last interval. This impaired survival experience of the 
internationals translates into a loss of median residual lifetime of 1.9 years 
[95% confidence interval: 0.6, 3.2] years at the entry time into the cohort. 
This loss is mainly driven by the mortality of internationals from the earlier 
half of the observation period. Reasons for this might be poorer medical care in 
former times, internationals being killed in action during World War II, and a 
changing distribution of causes of death during the 20th century.

BACKGROUND: After oral tumor resection, structural and functional rehabilitation 
by means of dental prostheses is complex, and positive treatment outcome is not 
always predictable.
PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to report on oral rehabilitation and 
quality of life 2-5 years after resection of malignant oral tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 46 patients (57 ± 7 years) who underwent oral 
tumor surgery were available. More than 50% of tumors were classified T3 or T4. 
Open oro-nasal defects resulted in 12 patients and full mandibulary block 
resections in 23 patients. Comprehensive planning, implant placement, and 
prosthetic rehabilitation followed an interdisciplinary protocol. Analysis 
comprised tumor location, type of prostheses, implant survival, and quality of 
life.
RESULTS: Because of advanced tumor status, resections resulted in marked 
alteration of the oral anatomy requiring complex treatment procedures. 
Prosthetic rehabilitation comprised fixed and removable prostheses, with 104 
implants placed in 28 patients (60%). Early implant loss was high (13%) and 
cumulative survival rate of loaded implants was <90% after 5 years. Prosthetic 
plans had to be modified because of side effects of tumor therapy, complications 
with implants and tumor recurrence. The majority of patients rated quality of 
life favorable, but some experienced impaired swallowing, dry mouth, limited 
mouth opening, appearance, and soreness.
CONCLUSIONS: Some local effects of tumor therapy could not be significantly 
improved by prosthetic rehabilitation leading to functional and emotional 
disability. Many patients had passed away or felt too ill to fill the 
questionnaires. This case series confirms the complex anatomic alterations after 
tumor resection and the need for individual treatment approaches especially 
regarding prosthesis design. In spite of disease-related local and general 
restrictions, most patients gave a positive assessment of quality of life.

risk.

OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer screening guidelines recommend that women and 
physicians consider life expectancy when making screening decisions in older 
women. However, prior studies suggest that screening mammography patterns are 
dependent on age rather than health status or mortality risk of women. Our 
objective is to determine the association between 4-year mortality risk and use 
of screening mammography in women aged ≥ 65 years using Medicare Current 
Beneficiary Survey data.
METHODS: The primary predictor variable is 4-year mortality risk derived from a 
published and validated prognostic index with 4 strata of increasing probability 
of death in 4 years (risk groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 with 4%, 15%, 42%, and 64% risk 
of 4-year mortality, respectively). The main outcome was self-reported receipt 
of mammography in the last year.
RESULTS: There was a significant decreasing trend in the use of mammography with 
mortality risk groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 (62.7%, 51.5%, 36.6%, and 24%, 
respectively; trend test P<.001). The adjusted odds of mammography use were 
greatest in the low mortality risk group and show a gradual decline with 
increasing mortality risk for risk groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 (odds ratio [confidence 
interval]): 1.00; 0.69 [0.53-0.90]; 0.37 [0.27-0.49], and 0.22 [0.13-0.36], 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Screening mammography use in older Medicare beneficiaries seems to 
reflect their 4-year risk of mortality rather than age alone, suggesting that 
patients and providers consider prognosis in screening decisions. Prospective 
studies are needed to explore the use of the prognostic index as a mammography 
screening decision tool.

More and more patients survive aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH), with 
case fatality decreasing by 17% in absolute terms over the past three decades 
and incidence remaining relatively stable at nine per 100,000 patient-years. The 
mean age at which aSAH occurs is reasonably young at 55 years, and people of 
this age in the general population have a good life expectancy. However, there 
are few data for life expectancy after aSAH, and the risks of late recurrent 
aSAH and other vascular diseases are unclear. The course of associated long-term 
physical and cognitive deficits after aSAH is not well established, leading to 
questions about potential outcomes to quality of life and working capacity, as 
well as best clinical practices.

INTRODUCTION: After completed anticoagulant treatment for acute VTE, both the 
subsequent mortality and risk of recurrent VTE are high, probably related to the 
frequent presence of serious disease in these patients. The aim of the study was 
to determine survival and recurrence in selected patients with good 
life-expectancy, and to evaluate risk factors.
METHODS: The 323 patients were followed for median 7.4 years (range 4.1-11.9) 
after cessation of anticoagulation. Survival analysis and Cox-regression were 
used for univariate and multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of survival after 5 years was 93.4%. 
Standardised mortality ratio was 1.42 for men and 1.28 for women. Patients 
without a transient risk factor prior to the index VTE were associated with 
higher risk of mortality compared to risk of mortality in patients with a 
transient risk factor (hazard ratio (HR) 2.81; 95% CI 1.40-5.62). Recurrence of 
VTE after 5 years was 19.0%. A persistent risk factor or a spontaneous VTE was 
associated with higher risk of recurrence compared to a transient risk factor 
(HR 2.39; 95% CI 1.44-3.95). Elevated D-dimer levels increased the risk, and 
immobilisation prior to the index VTE reduced the risk of recurrence. Sex, age 
and thrombophilia were not independent risk factors for recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a low mortality rate in this selected cohort, the 
recurrence rate and risk factors for recurrence were similar to findings 
reported in unselected populations. VTE unrelated to a transient risk factor was 
associated with increased mortality compared to mortality in patients with a 
transient risk factor.

BACKGROUND: Because of the aging United States population, increase in overall 
life expectancy, and rising incidence of hepatobiliary tumors, more elderly 
patients are considered for hepatic resection. The objective of this study was 
to assess the influence of age on postoperative outcomes after major hepatectomy 
among a contemporary cohort from 2 high volume centers.
STUDY DESIGN: Demographics, diagnoses, surgical treatments, and postoperative 
outcomes of patients who underwent major hepatic resection were reviewed.
RESULTS: There were 856 patients who underwent major hepatectomy (resection of 3 
or more segments) from 2002 to 2009. Postoperative mortality and morbidity 
occurred in 53 (6.2%) and 403 (47.1%) patients, respectively. Increasing age was 
independently associated with postoperative mortality (p = 0.0345). Each 1-year 
and 10-year increase in age resulted in an odds ratio of mortality after major 
hepatic resection of 1.036 (95% CI [1.003-1.071]) and 1.426 (95% CI 
[1.026-1.982]), respectively. This relationship was independent of American 
Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score. Increasing age was associated with 
postoperative sepsis (p = 0.0224, odds ratio for each year 1.025 [range 1.003 to 
1.048]) after major hepatic resection, but not overall postoperative morbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: In the contemporary era, increasing age is independently associated 
with postoperative mortality after major hepatic resection at high volume 
academic centers.

Falls-related self-efficacy is independently associated with quality-adjusted 
life years in older women.

Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

BACKGROUND: falls-related self-efficacy is associated with falls, falls-related 
injury and subsequent functional decline which may lead to poor health-related 
quality-of-life (HRQL). To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined the 
independent contribution of falls-related self-efficacy to HRQL. Our primary 
objective was to determine whether falls-related self-efficacy is independently 
associated HRQL, measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), in older women 
after accounting for known covariates.
METHOD: we conducted a secondary analysis of 135 community-dwelling older women 
aged 65-75 years who participated in a 12-month randomised controlled trial of 
resistance training. We assessed falls-related self-efficacy using the 
Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale and QALYs calculated from the 
EuroQol EQ-5D (EQ-5D).
RESULTS: our multivariate linear regression model demonstrated that 
falls-related self-efficacy as assessed using the Activities-specific Balance 
Confidence Scale was independently associated with QALYs after accounting for 
age, group, education, functional co-morbidity index, general mobility, global 
cognition and physiological falls risk. The final model explained 52% of the 
variation in QALYs. The ABC Scale accounted for 5% of the total variance in the 
final model.
CONCLUSIONS: although falls-related self-efficacy was independently associated 
with QALYs after controlling for a number of known variables, there may well be 
other factors not investigated, such as risk taking behaviour and psychological 
measures, which could account for some of the association.

The treatment and medical care of patients with lung cancer is mostly 
characterised and complicated by a reduced life expectancy. The lack of time can 
easily be the cause for various problems concerning the handling of these 
patients, their relatives and medical staff. A concept for opening future 
perspectives through standardised steps of communication could lead to a more 
cautious and humane relationship between physician and patient. In the case of 
successful realisation of this strategy, a significant enhancement of quality of 
life for the patient and relatives and practicability of work for the physician 
can be expected.

Endothelial cells respond to fluid flow by elongating in the direction of flow. 
Cytoskeletal changes and activation of signalling molecules have been 
extensively studied in this response, including: activation of receptors by 
mechano-transduction, actin filament alignment in the direction of flow, changes 
to cell-substratum adhesions, actin-driven lamellipodium extension, and 
localised activation of Rho GTPases. To study this process we model the force 
over a single cell and couple this to a model of the Rho GTPases, Rac and Rho, 
via a Kelvin-body model of mechano-transduction. It is demonstrated that a 
mechano-transducer can respond to the normal component of the force is likely to 
be a necessary component of the signalling network in order to establish 
polarity. Furthermore, the rate-limiting step of Rac1 activation is predicted to 
be conversion of Rac-GDP to Rac-GTP, rather than activation of upstream 
components. Modelling illustrates that the aligned endothelial cell morphology 
could attenuate the signalling network.

Iron-chelating therapy results in a significant improvement in the life 
expectancy of patients with transfusional iron overload. However, alterations of 
renal function have been observed in some patients undergoing chelation therapy. 
In the present study we evaluated the effect of treatment with deferasirox iron 
chelator on the renal function in normal Wistar rats and in mouse and human 
cultured tubular cell lines. Results indicate that deferasirox given daily via 
intraperitoneal route for 7 days induced: (1) an increased urinary protein, 
albumin and glucose excretion, (2) tubular necrosis/apoptosis, (3) and increased 
tubular damage markers, in spite of normal glomerular function. Moreover, in 
vitro studies revealed that: (1) mouse MCT cultures resulted more susceptible to 
the antiproliferative/cytotoxic effect of deferasirox, mainly at 24h after 
treatment, than human HK-2 cultures, (2) MCT cell content of damage molecules 
increased after 24h of iron chelator treatment with slight changes in their 
excretion into the culture medium and (3) MCT cultures showed a significant 
evidence of apoptotic cell death through an increased expression and activation 
of caspase-3 and marked DNA fragmentation. In conclusion, this renal side effect 
of deferasirox-chelating therapy seems to be based on direct toxic effects of 
deferasirox on renal tubular cells.

Economic implications and cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy.

Bernard ML(1), Gold MR.

592, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.

Use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and/or cardiac 
resynchronization therapy reduces mortality among several high-risk cohorts, 
primarily those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure. 
Since the advent of these technologies, concerns regarding the high initial 
costs of device implantation have been considered a potential barrier to 
widespread adoption. Despite such concerns, the use of these devices for primary 
or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death seems to be cost-effective when 
compared with national standards. Moreover, ICDs have been shown to be 
cost-effective in several health care systems and specialized populations such 
as those with high-risk long QT syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

OBJECTIVES: Outcome of ovarian cancer is better when surgery is provided by a 
gynaecological oncologist than by a general gynaecologist. However, when all 
patients with an adnexal mass have to be operated by gynaecological oncologists, 
this requires a change in the organisation of care, which generates additional 
costs. In this study, we assess the costs and effects of centralised and regular 
care for women with an ovarian malignancy in the Netherlands.
METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis. We considered three 
strategies. In the first strategy, patients were operated by a general 
gynaecologist (general care strategy). In the second strategy, patients were 
operated by a gynaecological oncologist (specialised care strategy). In the 
third strategy, evaluation of the adnexal mass took place prior to surgery by 
means of the Risk of Malignancy Index (diagnostic strategy). Patients at high 
risk for malignancy were supposed to be operated in a specialised care setting, 
whereas low risk patients were supposed to be operated in a general care 
setting. For each strategy we calculated life expectancy and incremental costs 
per life year gained (LYG).
RESULTS: Mean life expectancy of a patient with an ovarian malignancy in the 
general strategy was 2.7 years, in the diagnostic strategy 3.0 years and in the 
specialised strategy 3.1 years. The incremental costs to gain one additional 
life year with specialised surgery as compared to the diagnostic strategy were € 
61,871 per LYG.
CONCLUSION: In women with an adnexal mass, a diagnostic strategy prior to the 
decision for surgery by a general gynaecologist or a gynaecological oncologist 
provides the best balance between costs and effects.

A dynamic model for tuberculosis transmission and optimal treatment strategies 
in South Korea.

We have developed a dynamic model for tuberculosis (TB) transmission in South 
Korea using a SEIR model with the time-dependent parameters. South Korea ranked 
the highest TB incidence among members of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2005 yr. The observed data from the Korea 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) shows a certain rise of 
active-TB incidence individuals after 2001 yr. Because of this sudden jump, we 
have considered two different periods for best fitting the model: prior to 2001 
yr and posterior to 2001 yr. The least-squares fitting has been used for 
estimating model parameters to the observed data of active-TB incidence. Our 
model agrees well with the observed data. In this work, we also propose optimal 
treatment strategies of TB model in South Korea for the future. We have 
considered three control mechanisms representing distancing, case finding and 
case holding efforts. Optimal control programs have been proposed in various 
scenarios, in order to minimize the number of exposed and infectious individuals 
and the cost of implementing the control treatment.

BACKGROUND: People with substance use disorders (SUDs) have increased risk of 
mortality but risk in sub-groups is poorly understood.
METHODS: SUD cases, aged 15 years or older, were identified in the South London 
and Maudsley Case Register which contains over 150,000 specialist mental 
healthcare and addictions service users linked to regular national mortality 
tracing. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for the period 2007-2009 were 
calculated based on expected numbers of deaths for England and Wales in 2008 
then stratified by gender, age, ethnicity, and type of substance use disorder. 
Life expectancies at birth were estimated.
RESULTS: We detected 10,927 cases with a primary substance use disorder 
diagnosis prior to 2010, who were active to South London and Maudsley NHS 
Foundation Trust services between 2007 and 2009. Alcohol and opioid use 
disorders were the most common disorders (45.4% and 44.2% of the SUD cohort 
respectively) and were associated with increased mortality (SMRs 4.04 and 4.85 
respectively). Subgroups at particularly high risk were women with opioid use 
disorder (SMR 7.32) and those under the age of 45 years with alcohol use 
disorder (SMR 9.25). SMRs associated with alcohol and opioid use disorders 
diminished with age. Life expectancies of individuals with alcohol and opioid 
use disorders were reduced by 9-17 years compared to national norms.
CONCLUSIONS: Those under 45 years with alcohol use disorder and women with 
opioid use disorder are at particularly high risk of mortality. More targeted 
health care is required to address the specific needs of these vulnerable 
subgroups.

Using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a case study, we show that the maturity concept 
of Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory is a useful metric for developmental 
state. Maturity does not depend on food or temperature contrary to age and to 
some extent length. We compile the maturity levels for each developmental 
milestone recorded in staging atlases. The analysis of feeding, growth, 
reproduction and aging patterns throughout the embryo, juvenile and adult life 
stages are well-captured by a simple extension of the standard DEB model and 
reveals that embryo development is slow relative to adults. A threefold 
acceleration of development occurs during the larval period. Moreover we 
demonstrate that growth and reproduction depend on food in predictable ways and 
their simultaneous observation is necessary to estimate parameters. We used data 
on diverse aspects of the energy budget simultaneously for parameter estimation 
using the covariation method. The lowest mean food intake level to initiate 
reproduction was found to be as high as 0.6 times the maximum level. The 
digestion efficiency for Tetramin™ was around 0.5, growth efficiency was just 
0.7 and the value for the allocation fraction to soma (0.44) was close to the 
one that maximizes ultimate reproduction.

INTRODUCTION: This study was designed to determine if physicians' attitudes and 
recommendations surrounding implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are 
regionally associated with ICD use.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A national sample of 9969 members of the American College 
of Cardiology was surveyed electronically. Responses were merged with rates of 
ICD implantation from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry. Multivariable 
regression was used to assess trends between regional use and responses. We 
received 1210 responses (12%) and used 1124 after exclusions. Across regions, 
physicians were equally likely to recommend ICDs to males or females with 
ischemic (∼99% for both; P = NS) or nonischemic cardiomyopathy (85 vs. 88% P = 
0.85). Significant increasing trends in the probability recommending ICD therapy 
were found when the patient was "frail" (21% to 32%; P = .03) or had a life 
expectancy <1 year (5% to 10%; P = .05). These differences were not associated 
with attitudes toward ICDs.
CONCLUSIONS: Independent of variations in physicians' attitudes towards ICDs, 
physicians in regions of low ICD use are not less likely to recommend ICDs in 
situations clearly supported by guidelines while those in regions of high ICD 
use are more likely to recommend ICDs to patients who might have limited 
benefit.

Ageing is associated with decreases in strength and cardiovascular fitness, and 
increased cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of the current study was to 
determine the effectiveness of 16 weeks of community based resistance compared 
to flexibility training on strength, cardiovascular fitness and cardiovascular 
and metabolic parameters in a group of previously sedentary, healthy older men 
and women. A randomised controlled crossover intervention study. Forty nine 
healthy sedentary participants (23 males; age 66.7 ± 4.3 years; weight 78.6 ± 
15.4 kg; mean ± SD) completed 16 weeks of supervised community-based resistance 
training and 16 weeks of flexibility training in a randomised order. Prior to 
and following each intervention, participants were assessed for muscle strength, 
cardiovascular fitness (VO(2 peak)), fasted blood lipids and blood glucose, 
insulin and insulin resistance. Resistance training resulted in significant 
increases in knee extension (+25.7 Nm; p < 0.001) and knee flexion strength 
(+8.9 Nm; p = 0.048) and decreases in fasting total cholesterol (-0.51 mmol 
L(-1); p = 0.001), HDL cholesterol (-0.12 mmol L(-1); p = 0.035), LDL 
cholesterol (-0.35 mmol L(-1); p = 0.022), glucose (-0.42 mmol L(-1); p < 
0.001), insulin (-1.28 μU/mL; p = 0.049) and insulin resistance (-0.50 μU/mL; p 
= 0.004) compared to the flexibility protocol. No significant changes between 
the treatments were observed in VO(2peak) (+2.04 mL kg(-1)min(-1); p = 0.12). 
Community based resistance training is suitable for improving strength and 
reducing cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in healthy older individuals.

Therapy for HIV: past, present, and future.

Peters BS(1), Conway K.

Barry.Peters@kcl.ac.uk

Initial therapies for HIV infection comprised nucleoside analogues, but as 
single or dual agents, they failed to prevent disease progression. When a new 
class of drug was introduced, the protease inhibitors, an effective triple 
therapy became possible-namely, highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART. 
HAART reduced viral replication almost completely and enabled immune system 
recovery. The probability of classical infections and tumors attributed to HIV 
were dramatically reduced, and life expectancy correspondingly increased. The 
initial disadvantages of HAART included the need for strict adherence to prevent 
drug resistance, the cost that initially precluded their widespread use in the 
developing world, and the short- and long-term side effects. One of the most 
disabling long-term complications was HIV lipodystrophy, which in extreme cases 
lead to severe peripheral fat wasting and central fat gain. In recent years, 
many of these disadvantages have been addressed: Once-daily drug combinations 
improve adherence; global access to HAART has been markedly improved; and new 
drugs enable patients to avoid many of the initial side effects. Future research 
will determine at what CD4 count HAART should be initiated, and new approaches 
such as immunotherapeutic HIV vaccines are being tested with the aim to delay or 
obviate the need for antiretroviral drugs.

The use of advance directives among patients with left ventricular assist 
devices.

Patients who undergo implantation of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) 
often have improved quality of life, but may eventually succumb to their heart 
failure and/or sustain LVAD-related complications. In end-of-life situations, 
decisions must be made about when to deactivate LVAD support. Previous studies 
have demonstrated that end-of-life planning, particularly with the use of 
advance directives (ADs), can clarify patients' end-of-life preferences when 
they are unable to speak for themselves. However, many patients do not have ADs, 
and among patients who do, the ADs may lack useful information on how to guide 
care surrogates and clinicians regarding patients' preferences on 
life-sustaining treatments. The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of 
68 patients with advanced heart failure (56 men [82%]; mean [standard deviation] 
age, 59.0 ± 12.2 years) who underwent LVAD implantation between March 2003 and 
January 2009. The indication for the LVAD was destination therapy in 36 (53%) 
patients and bridge to heart transplant in 32 (47%) patients. Overall, 32 (47%) 
patients had ADs of varying types; 25 (78%) ADs were completed before LVAD 
implantation. Although life-sustaining treatments (eg, tube feeding, 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, and hemodialysis) were 
mentioned, none explicitly mentioned the LVAD or withdrawal of LVAD support at 
the end of life. We hypothesize that if instructions regarding LVAD management 
in ADs are explicit, surrogate and clinician distress may decrease, and ethical 
dilemmas may be avoided.

Analyzing dendritic growth in a population of immature neurons in the adult 
dentate gyrus using laminar quantification of disjointed dendrites.

Rosenzweig S(1), Wojtowicz JM.

In the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, new granule neurons are 
continuously produced throughout adult life. A prerequisite for the successful 
synaptic integration of these neurons is the sprouting and extension of 
dendrites into the molecular layer of the DG. Thus, studies aimed at 
investigating the developmental stages of adult neurogenesis often use dendritic 
growth as an important indicator of neuronal health and maturity. Based on the 
known topography of the DG, characterized by distinct laminar arrangement of 
granule neurons and their extensions, we have developed a new method for 
analysis of dendritic growth in immature adult-born granule neurons. The method 
is comprised of laminar quantification of cell bodies, primary, secondary and 
tertiary dendrites separately and independently from each other. In contrast to 
most existing methods, laminar quantification of dendrites does not require the 
use of exogenous markers and does not involve arbitrary selection of individual 
neurons. The new method relies on immunohistochemical detection of endogenous 
markers such as doublecortin to perform a comprehensive analysis of a 
sub-population of immature neurons. Disjointed, "orphan" dendrites that often 
appear in the thin histological sections are taken into account. Using several 
experimental groups of rats and mice, we demonstrate here the suitable 
techniques for quantifying neurons and dendrites, and explain how the ratios 
between the quantified values can be used in a comparative analysis to indicate 
variations in dendritic growth and complexity.

University, No.155, Sec. 2, Li-Nong St., Taipei 112, Taiwan. hclang@ym.edu.tw

The purpose of this study was to determine cancer-related medical care costs for 
long-term cancer care costs of breast, cervical, liver, lung, and colorectal 
cancer. Data were sourced from Taipei Veterans General Hospital cancer registry 
and claim data during 1999-2002. Besides, claimed data from National Health 
Insurance were used to match the comparison group. To estimate lifetime cost (10 
years), the whole disease process was divided into initial, continuing, and 
terminal three phases. The expected lifetime cost of a specific cancer patient 
was estimated by incorporating the average phase-specific costs with the 
survival rate and mortality rate. The undiscounted average lifetime costs (10 
years) for lung cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, cervical cancer, and 
breast cancer were NT$448,371 (1USD≒NTD 33), NT$584,985, NT$351,222, NT$511,563, 
and NT$674,282 (in 2002 NTD), respectively. The aggregate lifetime cost of 
cancer is useful for health policymaking and clinical decision-making.

Systemic mastocytosis in adults: 2011 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, 
and management.

SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. pardanani.animesh@mayo.edu

DISEASE OVERVIEW: Systemic mastocytosis (SM) results from a clonal proliferation 
of abnormal mast cells (MC) in one or more extracutaneous organs.
DIAGNOSIS: The major criterion is presence of multifocal clusters of 
morphologically abnormal MC in the bone marrow. Minor diagnostic criteria 
include elevated serum tryptase level, abnormal MC expression of CD25 and/or 
CD2, and presence of KITD816V.
RISK STRATIFICATION: The prognostic relevance of the 2008 World Health 
Organization (WHO) classification of SM has recently been confirmed. 
Classification of SM patients into indolent (SM), aggressive SM (ASM), SM 
associated with a clonal non-MC lineage disease (SM-AHNMD), and mast cell 
leukemia (MCL) subgroups is a useful first step in establishing prognosis.
RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: SM treatment is generally palliative. ISM patients have a 
normal life expectancy and receive symptom-directed therapy; infrequently, 
cytoreductive therapy may be indicated for refractory symptoms. ASM patients 
have disease-related organ dysfunction; interferon-α (±corticosteroids) can 
control dermatological, hematological, gastrointestinal, skeletal, and 
mediator-release symptoms, but is hampered by poor tolerability. Similarly, 
cladribine has broad therapeutic activity, with particular utility when rapid MC 
debulking is indicated; the main toxicity is myelosuppression. Imatinib has a 
therapeutic role in the presence of an imatinib-sensitive KIT mutation or in 
KITD816-unmutated patients. Treatment of SM-AHNMD is governed primarily by the 
non-MC neoplasm; hydroxyurea has modest utility in this setting. Dasatinib's in 
vitro anti- KITD816V activity has not translated into significant therapeutic 
activity in most SM patients. In contrast, preliminary data suggest that 
Midostaurin may produce significant decreases in MC burden in some patients.

Eye complications and markers of morbidity and mortality in long-term type 1 
diabetes.

Grauslund J(1).

The incidence of type 1 diabetes is rising all over the world. Furthermore, the 
increased life-expectancy of type 1 diabetic patients is likely to cause a 
higher number of diabetes-related micro- and macrovascular complications in the 
years to come. In order to examine the level of long-term complications in type 
1 diabetes as well as potential markers of micro- and macroangiopathy, a 
population-based cohort of Danish type 1 diabetic patients was examined in order 
to achieve the following aims: 1. To evaluate diabetic retinopathy as a 
long-term marker of all-cause mortality in type 1 diabetes (Paper I). 2. To 
estimate the long-term incidence and associated risk factors of blindness (Paper 
II) and cataract surgery (Paper III) in type 1 diabetes. 3 To use retinal 
vascular analyses in order to investigate the associations of long-term micro- 
and macrovascular complications and retinal vascular diameters (Paper IV) and 
retinal fractals (Paper V) in type 1 diabetes. 4. To examine N-terminal pro 
brain natriuretic peptide (Paper VI) and osteoprotegerin (Paper VII) as 
non-invasive markers of micro- and macrovascular complications in type 1 
diabetes. In Paper I it was a major finding that, despite a mean age of only 
38.3 years at baseline, 44.7% of the patients died during the 25-year follow-up. 
Patients who had proliferative retinopathy as well as proteinuria at the 
baseline examination had a significantly higher mortality. For these, the 
10-year survival was only 22.2%. As demonstrated in Paper II, blindness is an 
important issue in type 1 diabetes. The 25-year cumulative incidence of 
blindness was 7.5%. Glycaemic regulation and maculopathy at baseline were both 
identified as risk factors of blindness. Finally, mortality was higher in 
patients who went blind during the follow-up. Cataract surgery is quite common 
in type 1 diabetes. In Paper III a 25-year cumulative incidence of 20.8% was 
found. Adjusted for mortality, this was even higher (29.4%). As compared to 
patients without diabetes, cataract surgery takes place approximately 20 years 
earlier in type 1 diabetic patients. Age and maculopathy at baseline were both 
identified as predictors of cataract surgery. In Paper IV it was demonstrated 
that patients with retinal arteriolar narrowing were 2.17 and 3.17 times more 
likely to have nephropathy and macrovascular disease, respectively. This was an 
important finding that suggests that retinal fundus photos may be used in order 
to predict the risk of non-ophthalmological complications in type 1 diabetes. 
Retinal fractal analysis is another way to evaluate the vascular system of the 
retina. In Paper V we found associations between retinal fractal and 
microvascular - but not macrovascular--disease. For instance, patients with 
lower fractal dimensions were more likely to have proliferative retinopathy (OR 
1.45, 95% CI 1.04-2.03) and neuropathy (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.01-2.01). NT-proBNP is 
likely to be a future predictor of diabetes-related complications. In Paper VI 
higher levels of NT-proBNP were related to nephropathy (OR 5.03, 95% CI 
1.77-14.25), neuropathy (OR 4.08, 95% CI 1.52-10.97) and macrovascular disease 
(OR 5.84, 95% CI 1.65-20.74). These associations should be confirmed in future 
prospective studies. As opposed to NT-proBNP, osteoprotegerin is less likely to 
be a predictor of either micro- or macrovascular disease in type 1 diabetes. As 
demonstrated in Paper VII, even though association between higher levels of OPG 
and nephropathy were found in an age- and sex-adjusted model (OR 2.54, 95% CI 
1.09-5.90), this was no longer statistically significant when other factors were 
taken into account. Overall, it was demonstrated that various complications such 
as mortality, blindness and cataract surgery were high in type 1 diabetes. 
Furthermore, retinal arteriolar narrowing, decreased retinal fractals and plasma 
NT-proBNP were associated with various micro- and macrovascular complications.
