influences national opioid consumption has not been evaluated.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine whether the listing 
of opioids in national EMLs was associated with consumption. We quantified the 
numbers and types of all opioids included in 137 national EMLs, for comparison 
with opioids in the WHO's Model List of Essential Medicines. Using the 
International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) consumption statistics for 
2015-2017, we assessed the relation between annual mean opioid consumption 
(mg/person) and the numbers of opioids included in EMLs, controlling for region, 
population, healthcare expenditure, life expectancy, gross domestic product, 
human development and corruption.
RESULTS: Five opioids were included in the 20th edition of the WHO's Model List 
of Essential Medicines: codeine, fentanyl, loperamide, methadone and morphine. 
On average, countries' lists included significantly (p<0.05) more opioids than 
the WHO's Model List. However, there were wide variations in the numbers (median 
6 opioids; IQR: 5-9) and types (n=33) of opioids included in national EMLs. 
Morphine (95%), fentanyl (83%) and codeine (69%) were the most commonly included 
opioids. Most national EMLs were out of date (median publication date: 2011, 
IQR: 2009-2013). After adjusting for country characteristics, there was no 
relation between mean opioid consumption and the number of opioids in EMLs.
CONCLUSIONS: Including opioids in national EMLs was not associated with 
consumption. National EMLs should be regularly updated to reflect the 
availability of opioids and the populations' needs for managing pain.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) showed various transmission 
rate (R t ) across different regions. The determination of the factors affecting 
transmission rate is urgent and crucial to combat COVID-19. Here we explored 
variation of R t between 277 regions across the globe and the associated 
potential socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors. At global 
scale, the R t started to decrease approximately 2 weeks after policy 
interventions initiated. This lag from the date of policy interventions 
initiation to the date when R t started to decrease ranges from 9 to 19 days, 
largest in Europe and North America. We find that proportion of elderly people 
or life expectancy can explain ~50% of variation in transmission rate across the 
277 regions. The transmission rate at the point of inflection (R I ) increases 
by 29.4% (25.2-34.0%) for 1% uptick in the proportion of people aged above 65, 
indicating that elderly people face ~2.5 times higher infection risk than 
younger people. Air temperature is negatively correlated with transmission rate, 
which is mainly attributed to collinearities between air temperature and 
demographic factors. Our model predicted that temperature sensitivity of R I is 
only -2.7% (-5.2-0%) per degree Celsius after excluding collinearities between 
air temperature and demographic factors. This low temperature sensitivity of R I 
suggests that a warm summer is unlikely to impede the spread of COVID-19 
naturally.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic disease causing severe impairment to the 
respiratory system and digestive tracts. Currently, CF is incurable. As an 
autosomal recessive disorder, the morbidity of CF is significantly higher among 
Caucasians of European descent, whereas it is less pervasive among African and 
Asian populations. The disease is caused by identical mutations (homozygosity) 
or different mutations (heterozygosity) of an autosomal recessive mutation at 
position 7q31.2‑q31.1 of chromosome 7. Diagnostic criteria and guidelines work 
concurrently with laboratory detection to facilitate precise CF detection. With 
technological advances, the understanding of CF pathogenesis has reached an 
unprecedented level, allowing for increasingly precise carrier screening, more 
effective early stage CF intervention and improved prognostic outcomes. These 
advances significantly increase the life quality and expectancy of patients with 
CF. Given the numerous improvements in the field of CF, the current review 
summarized the technical advances in the study of the molecular mechanisms 
underlying CF, as well as how these improvements facilitate the clinical 
outcomes of CF. Furthermore, challenges and obstacles to overcome are discussed.

BACKGROUND: Up to 31% of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
(RRMS) discontinue treatment with disease-modifying drug (DMD) within the first 
year, and of the patients who do continue, about 40% are nonadherent. Shared 
decision making may decrease nonadherence and discontinuation rates, but 
evidence in the context of RRMS is limited. Shared decision making may, however, 
come at additional costs. This study aimed to explore the potential 
cost-effectiveness of shared decision making for RRMS in comparison with usual 
care, from a (limited) societal perspective over a lifetime.
METHODS: An exploratory economic evaluation was conducted by adapting a 
previously developed state transition model that evaluates the 
cost-effectiveness of a range of DMDs for RRMS in comparison with the best 
supportive care. Three potential effects of shared decision making were 
explored: 1) a change in the initial DMD chosen, 2) a decrease in the patient's 
discontinuation in using the DMD, and 3) an increase in adherence to the DMD. 
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses of a scenario that combined the 3 
effects were conducted.
RESULTS: Each effect separately and the 3 effects combined resulted in higher 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs due to the increased utilization 
of DMD. A decrease in discontinuation of DMDs influenced the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) most. The combined scenario resulted in an ICER 
of €17,875 per QALY gained. The ICER was sensitive to changes in several 
parameters.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that shared decision making for DMDs could 
potentially be cost-effective, especially if shared decision making would help 
to decrease treatment discontinuation. Our results, however, may depend on the 
assumed effects on treatment choice, persistence, and adherence, which are 
actually largely unknown.

The older population is heterogenous: at the same age, elderly patients can be 
robust, frail or dependent. Screening decisions must be individualized, taking 
into account the remaining life expectancy, the Time to Benefit (TTB: delay 
until preventive care gives a benefit), and patient preferences. Thus, robust 
patients, who have a longer life expectancy, can still benefit from some 
screening tests over age 75 that are inappropriate in vulnerable or dependent 
patients whose life expectancy is shorter than the TTB. Discussing life 
expectancy issues remains difficult outside of crises but medical encounters are 
unique opportunities to inquire about individual preferences and expectations, 
in order to define care objectives and discuss advanced care planning.

Publisher: La population âgée est hétérogène : à âge identique, les patients

intervention) et les préférences du patient. Ainsi, les patients robustes, dont 
l’EVR est supérieure au TTB, peuvent encore bénéficier de certains examens de 
dépistage après 75 ans alors qu’ils seront inappropriés chez ceux dont l’EVR est 
inférieure au TTB (vulnérables, dépendants). Bien que discuter de l’EVR puisse 
être ardu, chaque consultation est une opportunité pour l’aborder, s’enquérir 
des préférences et attentes du patient quant à sa santé afin de définir ensemble 
les modalités de sa prise en charge et de son projet de soins anticipés.

One of the most precious values of the modern age is time. Despite the 
increasing life expectancy achieved by medicine and by the time-saving 
automation technologies, for most of us, time is never enough. Beside manifold 
upheavals and psychological consequences (1), the COVID-19 pandemic and the 
consequent quarantine have impacted on our subjective perception of “time”, 
opening a frightening Pandora’s box. The healthcare emergency has thrown the 
population into a surreal novel where the time perception may be shrunk and, 
simultaneously, expanded or suddenly frozen without control and full awareness. 
Individuals are waved by events like leaves lashed out by an unexpected wind 
which brings unpredictable changes. Thus, our existence is no more like before: 
the rhythm of our days has changed, and nothing could be the same in our next 
future as the pandemic has left indelible marks in habits and perspectives.

In recent years, allergies due to airborne pollen allergens have shown an 
increasing trend, along with the severity of allergic symptoms in most 
industrialized countries, while synergism with other common atmospheric 
pollutants has also been identified as affecting the overall quality of 
citizenly life. In this study, we propose the state-of-the-art WRF-Chem model, 
which is a complex Eulerian meteorological model integrated on-line with 
atmospheric chemistry. We used a combination of the WRF-Chem extended towards 
birch pollen, and the emission module based on heating degree days, which has 
not been tested before. The simulations were run for the moderate season in 
terms of birch pollen concentrations (year 2015) and high season (year 2016) 
over Central Europe, which were validated against 11 observational stations 
located in Poland. The results show that there is a big difference in the 
model's performance for the two modelled years. In general, the model 
overestimates birch pollen concentrations for the moderate season and highly 
underestimates birch pollen concentrations for the year 2016. The model was able 
to predict birch pollen concentrations for first allergy symptoms (above 20 
pollen m-3) as well as for severe symptoms (above 90 pollen m-3) with 
probability of detection at 0.78 and 0.68 and success ratio at 0.75 and 0.57, 
respectively for the year 2015. However, the model failed to reproduce these 
parameters for the year 2016. The results indicate the potential role of 
correcting the total seasonal pollen emission in improving the model's 
performance, especially for specific years in terms of pollen productivity. The 
application of chemical transport models such as WRF-Chem for pollen modelling 
provides a great opportunity for simultaneous simulations of chemical air 
pollution and allergic pollen with one goal, which is a step forward for 
studying and understanding the co-exposure of these particles in the air.

Trends in disease-free life expectancy at age 65 in Spain: Diverging patterns by 
sex, region and disease.

Life expectancy in Spain is among the highest in the world. Nevertheless, we do 
not know if improvements in health conditions at older ages have followed 
postponements of death. Previous studies in Spain show a stable trend in years 
lived in ill health in the past. In this paper we investigate changes between 
2006, 2012 and 2017 in life expectancy with and without disease at age 65 in 
Spain and, for the first time, in Spanish regions, which have autonomous powers 
of health planning, public health and healthcare. Results show that, at the 
country level, disease-free life expectancy reduced between 2006 and 2017 in 
Spain. This was explained by an expansion of most diseases except for some 
cardiovascular and respiratory chronic conditions. However, at the regional 
level the evolution was different, especially regarding each disease and sex. 
First, regional differences reduced between 2006 and 2012 but largely widened in 
2017, suggesting that not all regions had the same ability to recover after the 
2008 financial crisis that caused government cuts to health services. Second, 
regional analysis also highlighted diverging trends by sex. While men 
experienced expansion of morbidity in most regions, women experienced a 
compression in about half of them, ending up with women showing higher 
disease-free life expectancies than men in 9 out of the 17 regions considered. 
This study, then, calls attention to the importance of focusing the analysis of 
health surveillance to more disaggregated levels, more in accordance with the 
level of health management, as regional trends showed heterogeneity in the 
prevalence of diseases and different progresses in the relationship between 
sexes.

BACKGROUND: Cancer poses a significant mortality, morbidity, economic and 
humanistic burden to patients and health systems. This study aims to better 
understand healthcare expenditure on cancer relative to other major chronic 
diseases across France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, whilst 
also considering the burden of illness posed by these conditions.
METHODS: A targeted literature review was performed to identify and extract 
relevant demographic, epidemiological and economic data. A health care payer 
perspective was adopted for the analysis, with a focus on direct healthcare 
costs.
RESULTS: Between 2006-2015, the cancer-related disability-adjusted life year 
(DALY) disease burden decreased by 9.3% despite a 6.5% increase in prevalence. 
Whilst the per patient drug costs increased by a compound annual growth rate 
(CAGR) of 5.1%, the overall per patient cancer costs decreased over the 10-year 
study period (CAGR of -1.4%). Compared to cardiovascular disease, 
neurological/mental disorders and diabetes, cancer was associated with the 
highest disease burden (20.8% of DALYs across all diseases) but the 
second-lowest healthcare expenditure levels (4.8% of total healthcare 
expenditure) among the studied major chronic diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the costs associated with treating cancer 
account for a low proportion of total healthcare expenditure relative to the 
burden of the disease and compared to other major chronic diseases across the 
countries included in the analysis.

bleaching in Bermuda.

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has been hypothesized to drive interannual 
variability in Bermudan coral extension rates and reef-scale calcification 
through the provisioning of nutritional pulses associated with negative NAO 
winters. However, the direct influence of the NAO on Bermudan coral 
calcification rates remains to be determined and may vary between species and 
reef sites owing to implicit differences in coral life history strategies and 
environmental gradients across the Bermuda reef platform. In this study, we 
investigated the connection between negative NAO winters and Bermudan Diploria 
labyrinthiformis, Pseudodiploria strigosa, and Orbicella franksi coral 
calcification rates across rim reef, lagoon, and nearshore reef sites. Linear 
mixed effects modeling detected an inverse correlation between D. 
labyrinthiformis calcification rates and the winter NAO index, with higher rates 
associated with increasingly negative NAO winters. Conversely, there were no 
detectable correlations between P. strigosa or O. franksi calcification rates 
and the winter NAO index suggesting that coral calcification responses 
associated with negative NAO winters could be species-specific. The correlation 
between coral calcification rates and winter NAO index was significantly more 
negative at the outer rim of the reef (Hog Reef) compared to a nearshore reef 
site (Whalebone Bay), possibly indicating differential influence of the NAO as a 
function of the distance from the reef edge. Furthermore, a negative 
calcification anomaly was observed in 100% of D. labyrinthiformis cores in 
association with the 1988 coral bleaching event with a subsequent positive 
calcification anomaly in 1989 indicating a post-bleaching recovery in 
calcification rates. These results highlight the importance of assessing 
variable interannual coral calcification responses between species and across 
inshore-offshore gradients to interannual atmospheric modes such as the NAO, 
thermal stress events, and potential interactions between ocean warming and 
availability of coral nutrition to improve projections for future coral 
calcification rates under climate change.

INTRODUCTION: For people with dementia, lived time is important to understand, 
as the condition affects memory, perceptions of time, and life expectancy. The 
aim of this study was to locate, interpret, and synthesize the experience of 
lived time for people with dementia.
METHOD: This article presents a qualitative systematic meta-synthesis. The 
theoretical framework of lifeworlds by van Manen provided the context for the 
study. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria for qualitative studies 
were used to appraise the studies. Sixty-one qualitative research studies based 
on interviews with people with dementia were included in the review. The 
analysis followed the principles of interpretive synthesis.
RESULTS: Four categories were revealed: (1) rooted in the past - "I am the same 
as before"; (2) focussing on the present - "Nobody has tomorrow"; (3) thinking 
about the future - "What is going to happen to me?"; and (4) changes in the 
experience of self over time - "I used to…." The latent overall meaning was 
expressed as "being engaged with the dimensions of time."
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The experience of lived time is an active and important 
one, enabling people to manage the dementia journey. Future work involving 
people with dementia should foreground the experience of lived time.

AIMS: Tobacco smoking and alcohol use contribute to differences in life 
expectancy between individuals with primary, secondary and tertiary education. 
Less is known about the contribution of these risk factors to differences at 
higher levels of education. We estimate the contribution of smoking and alcohol 
use to the life-expectancy differences between the doctorates and the other 
tertiary-educated groups in Finland and in Sweden.
METHODS: We used total population data from Finland and Sweden from 2011 to 2015 
to calculate period life expectancies at 40 years of age. We present the results 
by sex and educational attainment, the latter categorised as doctorate or 
licentiate degrees, or other tertiary. We also present an age and cause of death 
decomposition to assess the contribution of deaths related to smoking and 
alcohol.
RESULTS: In Finland, deaths related to smoking and alcohol constituted 48.6% of 
the 2.1-year difference in life expectancy between men with doctorate degrees 
and the other tertiary-educated men, and 22.9% of the 2.1-year difference 
between women, respectively. In Sweden, these causes account for 22.2% of the 
1.9-year difference among men, and 55.7% of the 1.6-year difference among women, 
which in the latter case is mainly due to smoking. Conclusions: Individuals with 
doctorates tend to live longer than other tertiary-educated individuals. This 
difference can be partly attributed to alcohol consumption and smoking.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to describe the prevalence and mortality of 
bladder cancer (BCa) using data obtained in the Global Burden of Disease study 
performed in 2017 (GBD 2017).
METHODS: Data on BCa for 2017, including prevalence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), were obtained from GBD 2017 at the 
global, regional, and national levels. We also analyzed the association of BCa 
burden with the country development level.
RESULTS: There were 2.63 million BCa cases estimated from the GBD 2017 data, 
with 200,000 persons dying of BCa, resulting in 3.60 million DALYs in 2017. The 
age-standardized prevalence (ASP) of BCa was 32.91/100,000 persons, and 
age-standardized death rate (ASDR) was 2.57/100,000 persons. The ASP and ASDR of 
BCa were higher in males than in females, and higher in people older than 
60 years. The ASP and ASDR of BCa were higher in Western Europe and Central 
Europe than in South Asia, Andean Latin America, and Central Latin America, and 
higher in countries with a higher sociodemographic index (SDI). Correlation 
analysis identified that the ASP and ASDR of BCa were positively correlated with 
the country SDI (P < 0.0001 and ρ = 0.68 for ASP, and P = 0.0048 and ρ = 0.20 
for ASDR). In addition, 33.72% deaths and 36.80% DALYs caused by BCa could be 
attributed to smoking globally.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence and mortality of BCa were very high in 2017, 
especially in high-SDI countries. Smoking-cessation strategies should be 
strengthened to control the burden associated with BCa.

INTRODUCTION: The current COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat. This elicits 
questions on the level of preparedness and capacity of health systems to respond 
to emergencies relative to other parts of the world.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study uses publicly available core health data for 
53 African countries to determine risk factors for cumulative COVID-19 deaths 
and cases per million in all countries in the continent. Descriptive statistics 
were determined for the indicators, and a negative binomial regression was used 
for modelling the risk factors.
RESULTS: In sub-Saharan Africa, an increase in the number of nursing and 
midwifery personnel decreased the risk of COVID-19 deaths (p=0.0178), while a 
unit increase in universal healthcare (UHC) index of service coverage and 
prevalence of insufficient physical activity among adults increased the risk of 
COVID-19 deaths (p=0.0432 and p=0.0127). An increase in the proportion of 
infants initiating breast feeding reduced the number of cases per million 
(p<0.0001), while an increase in higher healthy life expectancy at birth 
increased the number of cases per million (p=0.0340).
CONCLUSION: Despite its limited resources, Africa's preparedness and response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic can be improved by identifying and addressing specific 
gaps in the funding of health services delivery. These gaps impact negatively on 
service delivery in Africa, which requires more nursing personnel and increased 
UHC coverage to mitigate the effects of COVID-19.

Bacteriophages are highly specific predators that drive bacterial diversity 
through coevolution while striking tradeoffs among preserving host populations 
for long-term exploitation and increasing their virulence, structural stability, 
or host range. Escherichia coli and other coliform bacteria present in the 
microbiota of milk and during early ripening of raw milk cheeses have been 
linked to the production of gas, manifested by the appearance of eyes, and the 
development of off-flavors; thus, they might cause early blowing and cheese 
spoilage. Here, we report the characterization of coliphages isolated from 
manure from small ruminant farms and E. coli strains isolated from goat and 
sheep raw milk cheese. Additionally, the virulence and host range of locally 
isolated and laboratory collection phages were determined by comparing the 
susceptibility of E. coli strains from different sources. In agreement with the 
high genetic diversity found within the species E. coli, clustering analysis of 
whole-cell protein revealed a total of 13 distinct profiles but none of the raw 
milk cheese isolates showed inhibition of growth by reference or water-isolated 
coliphages. Conversely, 10 newly isolated phages had a broad host range (i.e., 
able to lyse ≥50% of bacterial hosts tested), thus exhibiting utility for 
biocontrol and only one cheese-isolated E. coli strain was resistant to all the 
phages. Whereas there was a high positive correlation between bacterial 
susceptibility range and lysis intensity, the phages virulence decreased as 
range increased until reaching a plateau. These results suggest local 
gene-for-gene coevolution between hosts and phages with selective tradeoffs for 
both resistance and competitive ability of the bacteria and host-range extension 
and virulence of the phage populations. Hence, different phage cocktail 
formulations might be required when devising long-term and short-term biocontrol 
strategies.

In 2017, in the Polish-German transborder area of West Pomerania, 
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, and Brandenburg, in collaboration with two 
centers in Warsaw, a partnership in the field of newborn screening (NBS) for 
severe primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID), mainly severe combined 
immunodeficiency (SCID), was initiated. SCID, but also some other severe PID, is 
a group of disorders characterized by the absence of T and/or B and NK cells. 
Affected infants are susceptible to life-threatening infections, but early 
detection gives a chance for effective treatment. The prevalence of SCID in the 
Polish and German populations is unknown but can be comparable to other 
countries (1:50,000-100,000). SCID NBS tests are based on real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (qPCR) and the measurement of a number of T cell receptor 
excision circles (TREC), kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KREC), 
and beta-actin (ACTB) as a quality marker of DNA. This method can also be 
effective in NBS for other severe PID with T- and/or B-cell lymphopenia, 
including combined immunodeficiency (CID) or agammaglobulinemia. During the 14 
months of collaboration, 44,287 newborns were screened according to the 
ImmunoIVD protocol. Within 65 positive samples, seven were classified to 
immediate recall and 58 requested a second sample. Examination of the 58 second 
samples resulted in recalling one newborn. Confirmatory tests included 
immunophenotyping of lymphocyte subsets with extension to TCR repertoire, 
lymphoproliferation tests, radiosensitivity tests, maternal engraftment assays, 
and molecular tests. Final diagnosis included: one case of T-BlowNK+ SCID, one 
case of atypical Tlow BlowNK+ CID, one case of autosomal recessive 
agammaglobulinemia, and one case of Nijmegen breakage syndrome. Among four other 
positive results, three infants presented with T- and/or B-cell lymphopenia due 
to either the mother's immunosuppression, prematurity, or unknown reasons, which 
resolved or almost normalized in the first months of life. One newborn was 
classified as truly false positive. The overall positive predictive value (PPV) 
for the diagnosis of severe PID was 50.0%. This is the first population 
screening study that allowed identification of newborns with T and/or B 
immunodeficiency in Central and Eastern Europe.

Cenani Lenz syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder associated with 
variable degree of limb malformations, dysmorphism, and renal agenesis. It is 
caused due to pathogenic variants in the LRP4 gene, which plays an important 
role in limb and renal development. Mutations in the APC gene have also been 
occasionally associated with CLS. The phenotypic spectrum ranges from mild to 
very severe perinatal lethal type depending on the type of variant. We report a 
pathogenic variant, c.2710 del T (p.Trp904GlyfsTer5) in theLRP4 gene, in a fetus 
with lethal Cenani Lenz syndrome with antenatal presentation of tetraphocomelia 
and symmetrical involvement of hands and feet.

We investigated the efficacy and safety of surgery and external beam 
radiotherapy (EBRT), in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involving 
the inferior vena cava (IVC) and/or right atrium (RA) through a comparative 
meta-analysis. A systematic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane 
library was performed for entries until July 2020. Eighteen studies with 22 
cohorts were included, encompassing 755 patients. The pooled median overall 
survival (OS) and 1- and 2-year OS rates were 14.2 months, 55.6%, and 27.4%, 
respectively. The pooled median OS in the surgery and EBRT arms were 15.3 and 
11.7 months, respectively. The pooled 1-year OS rate in the surgery arm was 
significantly higher than that in the EBRT arm (62.4%, 95% CI: 53.8%-70.3% vs 
48.8%, 95% CI: 40.9-56.8, respectively; P = .023), while the 2-year OS rates 
were similar (27.5%, 95% CI: 19.7%-37.1% vs 26.9%, 95% CI: 20.7-34.2, 
respectively; P = .913). In the surgical arm, the perioperative mortality and 
grade ≥3 complication rates were 0%-7.6% and 3.9%-67%, respectively. Grade ≥3 
complications and radiation-induced liver disease were rarely observed in the 
EBRT arm. Surgery could be an effective local modality for achieving the best 
survival rate, though it requires efforts to minimize morbidities and careful 
patient selection. EBRT, as a noninvasive modality, is a valid palliative 
option, especially for high-risk patients with a shorter life expectancy.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Solriamfetol, a dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is 
approved in the United States and European Union to treat excessive daytime 
sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (37.5-150 mg/day) and 
narcolepsy (75-150 mg/day). This analysis evaluated solriamfetol's efficacy in 
subgroups of participants with OSA who were adherent or nonadherent to primary 
OSA therapy at baseline and examined whether solriamfetol affected the use of 
primary therapy in an open-label extension trial.
METHODS: Participants with OSA who completed prior solriamfetol studies received 
solriamfetol 75, 150, or 300 mg/day for ≤ 52 weeks. The main efficacy outcome 
was the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. Primary therapy use was summarized as 
the percentage of nights, the number of hours/night, and the percentage of 
nights with use ≥ 50%/night (%). Efficacy and primary therapy use are reported 
for participants who directly enrolled from a previous 12-week study and had ≤ 
40 weeks of open-label treatment (n = 333). Safety data are reported for all 
participants (n = 417).
RESULTS: Mean ESS scores in adherent (n = 255) and nonadherent (n = 78) 
subgroups, respectively, were 15.0 and 15.8 at baseline (of 12-week study) and 
6.5 and 6.8 at week 40. For participants using an airway therapy, mean use at 
baseline was 90% of nights, 6.6 hours/night, and use ≥ 50%/night on 90% of 
nights; changes from baseline to week 40 were minimal (0.9%, -0.8 hours, and 
6.5%, respectively). Common adverse events (both subgroups) included headache, 
nasopharyngitis, insomnia, dry mouth, nausea, anxiety, and upper respiratory 
tract infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term efficacy and safety of solriamfetol were similar 
regardless of adherence to primary OSA therapy. Solriamfetol did not affect 
primary therapy use.
