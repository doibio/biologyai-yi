simulations.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs (2016 $US) of pressure-injury treatment and 
prevention, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) related to pressure injuries 
were weighted by transition probabilities to calculate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at $100 000/QALY willingness-to-pay. Univariate 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses tested model uncertainty.
RESULTS: Simulating prevention for all patients yielded greater QALYs at higher 
cost from societal and healthcare sector perspectives, equating to ICERs of 
$2000/QALY and $2142/QALY, respectively. Risk-stratified follow-up in patients 
with Braden scores <15 dominated standard care. Prevention for all patients was 
cost-effective in >99% of probabilistic simulations.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis using EHR data maintains that pressure-injury 
prevention for all inpatients is cost-effective. Hospitals should invest in 
nursing compliance with international prevention guidelines.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most frequent surgical procedures in 
orthopaedic surgery. Until now there have not been any standardized indication 
criteria, which might contribute to the large geographical differences in the 
frequency of TKA. This guideline aims to consent minimal requirements (main 
criteria), additional important aspects (minor criteria), as well as relative 
and absolute contraindications for TKA. The following main criteria have been 
consented: knee pain, radiological confirmation of osteoarthritis or 
osteonecrosis, inadequate response to conservative treatment, adverse impact of 
knee disease on the patient's quality of life and the burden of suffering due to 
the knee disease. Relative contraindications have been consented as severe 
general disease with reduced life expectancy and a BMI ≥40; absolute 
contraindications are an active infection and if the patient is not able to 
undergo major surgery.

We assessed disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to dental caries 
preventable through water fluoridation apportioned by sex, age group, sequela, 
province, and community type in Iran, 2016. The burden of disease due to dental 
caries was extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016) and 
the caries preventive effect of water fluoridation was calculated using a 
database of fluoride levels in drinking water. All the preventable DALYs were 
caused by years lived with disability (YLDs) because of the non-fatal character 
of dental caries. DALYs and DALY rate (per 100,000 people) preventable through 
water fluoridation at the national level in 2016 were 14,971 (95% uncertainty 
interval 7348- 24,725) and 18.73 (9.19-30.93), respectively. The national 
population preventable fraction (PPF) of dental caries by water fluoridation was 
determined to be as high as 0.176 (0.141-0.189). The share of sequelae in the 
preventable DALYs at the national level were estimated to be 76.8% for 
edentulism and severe tooth loss, 21.4% for caries of permanent teeth, and 1.8% 
for caries of deciduous teeth. The national DALYs and DALY rate preventable 
through water fluoridation exhibited no difference by sex, but considerably 
increased by age from 110 (37-223) and 1.5 (0.5-3.1) for the age group 0-4 y to 
4331 (2334-6579) and 88.9 (47.9-135.1) for the age group 65 y and older, 
respectively. Over 80% of the national preventable DALYs occurred in urban areas 
due to higher population and lower coverage of fluoridated drinking water. The 
highest provincial DALYs and DALY rate preventable by water fluoridation were 
observed in Tehran and Gilan to be 3776 (1866-6206) and 37.2 (18.6-60.8), 
respectively. The results indicated that water fluoridation can play a profound 
role in the promotion of dental public health and compensate the spatial 
inequality and increasing temporal trend of health losses from dental caries at 
the national level.

Surveying the Cost-Effectiveness of the 20 Procedures with the Largest Public 
Health Services Waiting Lists in Ireland: Implications for Ireland's 
Cost-Effectiveness Threshold.

OBJECTIVES: To survey the cost effectiveness of procedures with the largest 
waiting lists in the Irish public health system to inform a reconsideration of 
Ireland's current cost-effectiveness threshold of €45,000/quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY).
METHODS: Waiting list data for inpatient and day case procedures in the Irish 
public health system were obtained from the National Treatment Purchase Fund. 
The 20 interventions with the largest number of individuals waiting for 
inpatient and day case care were identified. The academic literature was 
searched to obtain cost-effectiveness estimates from Ireland and other 
high-income countries. Cost-effectiveness estimates from foreign studies were 
adjusted for differences in currency, purchasing power parity, and inflation.
RESULTS: Of the top 20 waiting list procedures, 17 had incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) lower than €45,000/QALY, 14 fell below 
€20,000/QALY, and 10 fell below €10,000/QALY. Only one procedure had an ICER 
higher than the current threshold. Two procedures had ICERs reported for 
different patient and indication groups that lay on either side of the 
threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Some cost-effective interventions that have large waiting lists may 
indicate resource misallocation and the threshold may be too high. An 
evidence-informed revision of the threshold may require a reduction to ensure it 
is consistent with its theoretical basis in the opportunity cost of other 
interventions foregone. A limitation of this study was the difficulty in 
matching specific procedures from waiting lists with ICER estimates from the 
literature. Nevertheless, our study represents a useful demonstration of a novel 
concept of using waiting list data to inform cost-effectiveness thresholds.

OBJECTIVES: The English National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
and the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) require 
evidence that a new medicine represents value for money before being publicly 
funded. NICE has an explicit threshold for cost effectiveness, whereas PBAC does 
not. We compared the initial incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
presented by manufacturers in matched submissions to each decision-making body, 
with the aim of exploring the impact of an explicit threshold on these ICERs.
METHODS: Data were extracted from matched submissions from 2005 to 2015. The 
ICERs in these submissions were compared within each pair and with respect to a 
cost-effectiveness threshold.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight pairs of matched submissions were identified. The median 
difference between the ICERs ($2635/quality-adjusted life year [QALY]) was 
significantly greater than zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.0299), 
indicating that the proposed ICERs in the submissions to NICE were higher than 
those in the matched submissions to PBAC. On 93% of occasions, NICE ICERs were 
within -$17,772 to +$48,422 of the corresponding PBAC ones (Bland-Altman 
analysis), demonstrating poor agreement. When an implicit threshold of 
AUD$50,000/QALY was assumed for PBAC decision making, only eight pairs of 
submissions had discordant ICERs falling above or below the respective 
threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: The significantly higher ICERs in the submissions to NICE than 
those to PBAC may be a consequence of NICE's explicit willingness-to-pay 
threshold, and/or other health system factors. Industry may be assuming an 
implicit threshold for PBAC when constructing their ICERs despite the lack of 
acknowledgement of such a threshold.

BACKGROUND: Cost-utility analysis prioritizes services using cost, life-years, 
and the health state utility of the life-years. Nevertheless, a significant body 
of evidence suggests that the public would prefer more variables to be 
considered in decision making and at least some sharing of the budget with 
services for severe conditions that are not cost-effective because of their high 
cost.
OBJECTIVES: To examine whether this preference for sharing persists for less 
severe conditions when both cost effectiveness and illness severity would 
indicate that resources should be allocated to other services.
METHODS: Survey respondents were asked to divide a budget between two patients 
facing life-threatening illnesses. The severity of the illnesses differed and 
the price of treatment was varied.
RESULTS: Sharing occurred in all scenarios including scenarios in which the 
illness was less severe and services were not cost-effective. Results are 
consistent with behavior commonly observed in other contexts.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that sharing per se is important and that the 
public would support some funding of cost-ineffective services for less severe 
health problems.

BACKGROUND: Despite evidence of nonproportional trade-offs in time trade-off 
exercises and the explicit incorporation of exponential discounting in health 
technology assessment calculations, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) tariffs 
are currently still established under the assumption of linear time preferences.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to introduce a general method of 
accommodating for nonlinear time preferences in discrete choice experiment (DCE) 
duration studies and to evaluate its impact on estimated QALY tariffs.
METHODS: A parsimonious utility function is proposed that accommodates any 
discounting function and preserves linear time preferences as a special case. 
Based on an efficient DCE design and 1775 respondents from a nationally 
representative scientific household panel, preferences and QALY tariffs for the 
Dutch SF-6D were estimated while accommodating for nonlinear time preferences 
via exponential and hyperbolic discounting functions.
RESULTS: When the discount rate was estimated directly, we found strong evidence 
of nonlinear time preferences (with an exponential and hyperbolic discount rate 
of 5.7% and 16.5%, respectively). When the discount rate was estimated as a 
function of health state severity, we found that years lived in better health 
states are discounted minus years lived in impaired health states. Finally, the 
best statistical fit was obtained when using a hyperbolic discount function, 
which resulted in smaller QALY decrements and fewer health states classified as 
worse than immediate death.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the relevance and even necessity of a 
paradigm shift in health valuation studies in favor of time-preference corrected 
QALY tariffs, with potentially important implications for health technology 
assessment calculations and regulatory decisions.

BACKGROUND: Survival prediction models are clinical tools that help 
professionals make the best treatment decisions. In the treatment of critical 
limb ischemia, several scoring methods have emerged; however, many are limited 
because they are not reproducible in different populations. This study analyze 
the Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischemia of the Leg survival prediction 
model (BASIL SPM), exclusively in patients who underwent infrapopliteal 
(InfraPo) revascularization for the treatment of critical limb ischemia.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort, patients who underwent InfraPo 
interventions during a 4-year period (2009-2013) were consecutively included, 
according to the primary intervention (endovascular or open repair), 
irrespective of combined treatment in the femoropopliteal and InfraPo segments. 
Performance of the BASIL SPM was determined using the area under the curve of 
the receiver-operating characteristic curve. Additionally, secondary patency, 
limb salvage, and overall survival were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 32.7 ± 23.8 months. In the total 
patient group (n = 134), the mean age was 72 ± 8.6 years (range, 46-91 years), 
and the main associated comorbidities were hypertension (85.8%) and diabetes 
mellitus (76.8%). Regarding differences between the groups, patients in the 
endovascular group (n = 100) were older (73 vs. 69.5; P = 0.033) and more 
frequently stratified as high risk (61% vs. 38.2%; P = 0.030) than the open 
repair group (n = 34). The area under the curve (95% confidence interval [CI]) 
using the BASIL SPM at 6, 12, and 24 months was 0.499 (95% CI: 0.344-0.657), 
0.508 (95% CI: 0.353-0.629), and 0.549 (95% CI: 0.420-0.678), respectively. In 
the total patient group, the 36-month secondary patency, limb salvage, and 
overall survival were 31.5%, 81.1%, and 65.9%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The BASIL SPM was a poor predictor of life expectancy in this 
patient cohort.

BACKGROUND: Brain metastases (BMs) have a major impact on life expectancy and 
quality of life for many breast cancer patients. Knowledge about treatment 
patterns and outcomes is limited.
METHODS: We analysed clinical data of 1712 patients diagnosed with BMs from 
breast cancer between January 2000 and December 2016 at 80 institutions.
RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis of BMs was 56 years (22-90 years). About 47.8% 
(n = 732) of patients had HER2-positive, 21.4% (n = 328) had triple-negative and 
30.8% (n = 471) had hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative (luminal-like) 
primary tumours. The proportion of patients with HER2-positive BMs decreased 
comparing the years 2000-2009 with 2010-2015 (51%-44%), whereas the percentage 
of patients with luminal-like tumours increased (28%-34%; p = 0.0331). Patients 
with BMs in the posterior fossa were more often HER2 positive (n = 169/314, 
53.8%) than those diagnosed with triple-negative (n = 65/314, 20.7%) or 
luminal-like primary breast cancer (n = 80/314, 25.5%), (p < 0.0001). Median 
overall survival (OS) time after development of BMs for the overall cohort was 
7.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.7-8.0 months). One-year survival 
rate was 37.7% (95% CI: 35.2-40.1). Patients with HER2-positive tumours had the 
longest median OS of 11.6 months (95% CI: 10.0-13.4) compared with 5.9 months 
(95% CI: 5.0-7.2) for patients with luminal-like and 4.6 months (95% CI: 
3.9-5.4) for patients with triple-negative tumours. Patients with HER2-positive 
tumours who received anti-HER2 treatment had longer median OS than those without 
(17.1 months versus 7.2 months, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis of patients after developing BMs varies significantly 
according to the subtype. The outcome in this cohort is similarly poor in 
triple-negative and HR-positive/HER2-negative patients. Our results underline 
the high medical need for improvement of treatment and prevention strategies for 
BMs in breast cancer patients.

OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of subtypes and comorbidities on breast cancer 
(BC) relapse and survival in the heterogeneous patients of the real world.
METHODS: We identified patients diagnosed with BC between January 2003 and 
December 2005 from six population-based Swiss cancer registries. 
Clinicopathologic data was completed with information on locoregional and 
distant relapse and date and cause of death for over 10-years. We approximated 
BC subtypes using grade and the immunohistochemical panel for oestrogen, 
progesterone and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor status. We 
studied factors affecting relapse and survival.
RESULTS: Luminal A-like subtype represented 46% of all newly diagnosed BC 
(N = 1831), followed by luminal B-like (N = 1504, 38%), triple negative 
(N = 436, 11%) and HER2 enriched (N = 204, 5%). We observed regional disparities 
in subtype prevalence that contribute to explain regional differences in 
survival formerly described. Disease relapse and BC specific mortality differed 
by subtype and were lower for luminal A like tumours than for other subtypes for 
any stage at diagnosis. After a median follow-up of 10.9 years, 1311 (33%) had 
died, half of them 647 (16%) due to another disease, showing the importance of 
comorbidities. Omission of systemic therapies in selected patients was not 
associated with poorer BC specific survival, BC subtype and life expectancy 
playing a role.
CONCLUSIONS: Information on tumour subtype is necessary for an adequate 
interpretation of population-based BC studies. Measures of comorbidity or 
frailty help in the evaluation of quality of care in the highly heterogeneous 
patients of the real world.

Sym004 is a 1:1 mixture of two antibodies targeting non-overlapping epitopes of 
the epidermal growth factor receptor that antagonizes ligand binding and induces 
receptor downregulation. In preclinical models, it has superior antitumor 
activity to cetuximab and panitumumab. Japanese adults aged ≥20 years with an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0/1 and life expectancy ≥3 months 
were eligible. Patients in Part A (dose escalation) had refractory or recurrent 
late-stage solid tumors and received Sym004 6 mg/kg/wk (n = 3), 9 mg/kg 
loading/6 mg/kg/wk (n = 6), 12 mg/kg/wk (n = 6), or 18 mg/kg biweekly (n = 6). 
Patients in expansion Part B (n = 30) had esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and 
received Sym004 at the dose recommended from Part A. Fifty-one patients received 
Sym004. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in Part A. A dose of 
12 mg/kg/wk was selected for Part B. All patients in Part B experienced 
treatment-related adverse events, most commonly dermatitis acneiform (76.7%). 
Eighteen grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events and five serious adverse 
events occurred (cardiac arrest, lung infection, interstitial lung disease, 
toxic skin eruption, blood creatinine increase). Two patients had 
treatment-related adverse events resulting in death (cardiac arrest and blood 
creatinine increase). Five patients in Part B had a best overall response of 
partial response, 12 stable diseases and 12 disease progression (1 not 
evaluable). The objective response rate was 16.7% (95% CI: 5.6%-34.7%). Sym004 
therapy was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities at any dose studied. 
Evidence of antitumor activity was seen in patients with esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01955473.

Heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently coexist, particularly in the elderly. Given 
their rising prevalence and the contemporary trend to longer life expectancy, 
overlapping HF-COPD will become a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the 
next decade. Areas covered: Drawing on current clinical and physiological 
constructs, the consequences of negative cardiopulmonary interactions on the 
interpretation of pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary exercise tests in 
HF-COPD are discussed. Although those interactions may create challenges for the 
diagnosis and assessment of disease stability, they provide a valuable 
conceptual framework to rationalize HF-COPD treatment. The impact of COPD or HF 
on the pharmacological treatment of HF or COPD, respectively, is then 
comprehensively discussed. Authors finalize by outlining how the 
non-pharmacological treatment (i.e. rehabilitation and exercise reconditioning) 
can be tailored to the specific needs of patients with HF-COPD. Expert 
commentary: Randomized clinical trials testing the efficacy and safety of new 
medications for HF or COPD should include a sizeable fraction of patients with 
these coexistent pathologies. Multidisciplinary clinics involving cardiologists 
and respirologists trained in both diseases (with access to unified 
cardiorespiratory rehabilitation programs) are paramount to decrease the 
humanitarian and social burden of HF-COPD.

We investigated the behavior of 15 female Turner's thick-toed geckos 
(Chondrodactylus turneri GRAY 1864) during a 30-day orbital experiment on the 
unmanned spacecraft "BION-M" No. 1. During weightlessness, the geckos maintained 
their ability to attach to the surfaces using the subdigital pads on their toes. 
On average, the geckos spent 99.9% of the time adhering to surfaces during the 
flight and only 0.1% floating freely. The active geckos, when starting to float, 
immediately restored attachment by a number of behavioral responses. The 
floating quiescent geckos, when resuming their active condition, responded in 
the same manner. The responses during flotation are similar to the behavioral 
reflexes triggered by a fall under normal gravity; i.e.: 1) the ventral 
extension of the limbs, 2) a skydiving posture, and 3) postural righting 
reflexes. Ventral extension of limbs was described for the first time in 
weightlessness. Individual variability in the frequency of flotations was found 
for both active and quiescent geckos during the flight. The findings show that 
the ability to attach to surfaces is an important factor in the geckos' 
adaptation to weightlessness. The behavioral responses that originated during 
freefall in conditions on Earth (one-G) appear as adaptations to weightlessness 
and remain partially effective.

Dengue has been estimated to cause a substantial health and economic burden in 
Vietnam. The most recent studies have estimated that it is responsible for 39884 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) annually, representing an economic burden 
of US$94.87 million per year (in 2016 prices). However, there are alternative 
burden estimates that are notably lower. This variation is predominantly due to 
differences in how the number of symptomatic dengue cases is estimated. 
Understanding the methodology of these burden calculations is vital when 
interpreting health economic analyses of dengue. This review aims to provide an 
overview of the health and economic burden estimates of dengue in Vietnam. We 
also highlight important research gaps for future studies.

Purpose: People with severe mental illness are sedentary, have high 
cardio-metabolic risks and significantly reduced life expectancy. Despite 
considerable data regarding positive physical and mental health outcomes 
following exercise interventions, implementation and evaluation of real-world 
programs is lacking. The primary aim of this study was to assess the feasibility 
of an exercise intervention implemented by exercise physiology (EP) students 
within a residential rehabilitation unit for residents with severe mental 
illness, together with assessment of a range of secondary physical and mental 
health outcomes pre- and post- the intervention. Design: Single arm, prospective 
pilot study evaluating outcomes pre- and post- a 10 week intervention. Method: 
Inactive people with severe mental illness participated in a mixed aerobic and 
resistance exercise intervention, three times per week for 10 weeks. Data was 
obtained from a sample of 16 residents with severe mental illness; primary 
diagnosis schizophrenia (n = 12). Primary outcomes were feasibility as assessed 
using recruitment, retention and participation rates, as well as reasons for 
withdrawal and amount of exercise achieved. Secondary outcomes included: 
functional exercise capacity was measured by the 6-min walk test; metabolic data 
obtained from anthropometric measurements; blood pressure; fasting cholesterol 
and blood sugar levels; and physical activity levels and mental health as 
assessed by self- administered questionnaires measured before and after the 
intervention. Results: Broad level acceptance of the program: high recruitment 
(81%), retention (77%), and participation (78%) rates were observed. Promising 
improvements in functional exercise capacity, volume of exercise, and negative 
symptoms was demonstrated in those who completed. Conclusions: Exercise 
interventions delivered by EP students in a residential rehabilitation setting 
for people with SMI are feasible; group setting, supervision and choice for 
engagement are important considerations. Evaluation of longitudinal, multi site 
studies, with the addition of dietary interventions within residential 
rehabilitation units are warranted. Addressing cost feasibility and cost 
effectiveness of such programs is recommended. The trial was registered with the 
Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) number, Unique

Life Science Majors' Math-Biology Task Values Relate to Student Characteristics 
and Predict the Likelihood of Taking Quantitative Biology Courses.

Expectancy-value theory of achievement motivation predicts that students' task 
values, which include their interest in and enjoyment of a task, their 
perceptions of the usefulness of a task (utility value), and their perceptions 
of the costs of engaging in the task (e.g., extra effort, anxiety), influence 
their achievement and academic-related choices. Further, these task values are 
theorized to be informed by students' sociocultural background. Although biology 
students are often considered to be math-averse, there is little empirical 
evidence of students' values of mathematics in the context of biology 
(math-biology task values). To fill this gap in knowledge, we sought to 
determine 1) life science majors' math-biology task values, 2) how math-biology 
task values differ according to students' sociocultural background, and 3) 
whether math-biology task values predict students' likelihood of taking 
quantitative biology courses. We surveyed life science majors about their 
likelihood of choosing to take quantitative biology courses and their interest 
in using mathematics to understand biology, the utility value of mathematics for 
their life science career, and the cost of doing mathematics in biology courses. 
Students on average reported some cost associated with doing mathematics in 
biology; however, they also reported high utility value and were more interested 
in using mathematics to understand biology than previously believed. Women and 
first-generation students reported more negative math-biology task values than 
men and continuing-generation students. Finally, students' math-biology task 
values predicted their likelihood of taking biomodeling and biostatistics 
courses. Instructional strategies promoting positive math-biology task values 
could be particularly beneficial for women and first-generation students, 
increasing the likelihood that students would choose to take advanced 
quantitative biology courses.

An 83-year-old woman underwent mastectomy for breast cancer of the right breast 
in 2008. In addition to hormone therapy and irradiation, zoledronate was started 
for bone metastasis 6 months postoperatively. Five years after the operation, 
the patient developed osteonecrosis of the jaw, and underwent sequestrectomy 
because of uncontrollable pain in the mandible. The patient visited our hospital 
for a 1-week history of fever and right facial swelling with pain, and was 
diagnosed with right mandibular cellulitis. Despite antibiotic therapy, the 
patient fell into shock. Follow-up computed tomography showed gas formation 
extending down to the posterior mediastinum, which was compatible with 
descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM). The patient succumbed to septicemia 
on the third hospital day. The mortality rate of DNM greatly increases in 
patients with advanced cancer because clinicians cannot perform radical 
treatment due to the impaired general condition and limited life expectancy. DNM 
advances by the hour; therefore, repeated computed tomography is essential when 
antibiotic therapy does not improve the patient's condition. Attention must be 
paid to detect signs of DNM in such patients. To the best of our knowledge, this 
is the first report in English regarding DNM caused by bisphosphonate-induced 
osteonecrosis of the jaw.

Improvements in cancer survival have made the long-term risks from treatments 
more important, in particular among the children, adolescents and young adults 
who are more at risk particularly due to a longer life expectancy and a higher 
sensitivity to treatments. Subsequent malignancies in cancer survivors now 
constitute 15 to 20% of all cancer diagnoses in the cancer registries. Lots of 
studies are published to determine risk factors, with some controversial 
findings. Just data from large cohorts with detailed information on individual 
treatments and verification of what is called "secondary cancers" can add some 
knowledge, because their main difficulty is that the number of events for most 
second cancer sites are low, which impact the statistical results. In this 
review of the literature, we distinguish second and secondary cancers and 
discuss the factors contributing to this increased risk of secondary cancers. 
The article concludes with a summary of current surveillance and screening 
recommendations.

Total en bloc spondylectomy is a surgical technique cutting off tumors of spine 
and its satellite. Previous studies have shown that this technique could reduce 
postoperative recurrence rate of spinal tumor, but surgical indications are not 
unified. Wide application of spinal tumor surgical staging and life expectancy 
system make it more clear for surgery. However, it is difficult to carry out 
extensive operation for the characteristics of more bleeding, great difficulty 
and high risk. As for continuous improvement of TES technology, application of 
endoscopy and appearance of 3D printing artificial vertebral body could push the 
operation becoming mature.
