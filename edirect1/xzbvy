Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
RESULTS: Both the open and RAAA groups were well matched for age and sex. There 
was no statistical difference between RAAA survival and an age-matched 
population P = 0.23, or was there any difference between open repair and an 
age-matched population, P = 0.1. Survival curves for RAAA and open repair were 
similar, P = 0.98. For elective open repair 1-, 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-year 
survival was 93.6, 71.2, 40, 17 and 2% respectively. Corresponding results for 
RAAA were 92.5, 74, 36.7, 13.5 and 5% respectively.
CONCLUSION: Open AAA repair for RAAA or elective aneurysm treatment restores 
predicted life expectancy for those patients surviving 30 days or more and is 
therefore a durable method of treatment for this condition.

Fecal Microbiota Therapy for Clostridium difficile Infection: A Health 
Technology Assessment.

Health Quality Ontario.

BACKGROUND: Fecal microbiota therapy is increasingly being used to treat 
patients with Clostridium difficile infection. This health technology assessment 
primarily evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of fecal microbiota 
therapy compared with the usual treatment (antibiotic therapy).
METHODS: We performed a literature search using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane 
Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, CRD 
Health Technology Assessment Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, and NHS Economic Evaluation Database. For the economic review, we 
applied economic filters to these search results. We also searched the websites 
of agencies for other health technology assessments. We conducted a 
meta-analysis to analyze effectiveness. The quality of the body of evidence for 
each outcome was examined according to the Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. Using a 
step-wise, structural methodology, we determined the overall quality to be high, 
moderate, low, or very low. We used a survey to examine physicians' perception 
of patients' lived experience, and a modified grounded theory method to analyze 
information from the survey.
RESULTS: For the review of clinical effectiveness, 16 of 1,173 citations met the 
inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials found 
that fecal microbiota therapy significantly improved diarrhea associated with 
recurrent C. difficile infection versus treatment with vancomycin (relative risk 
3.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.85-5.68) (GRADE: moderate). While fecal 
microbiota therapy is not associated with a significant decrease in mortality 
compared with antibiotic therapy (relative risk 0.69, 95% CI 0.14-3.39) (GRADE: 
low), it is associated with a significant increase in adverse events (e.g., 
short-term diarrhea, relative risk 30.76, 95% CI 4.46-212.44; abdominal 
cramping, relative risk 14.81, 95% CI 2.07-105.97) (GRADE: low). For the 
value-for-money component, two of 151 economic evaluations met the inclusion 
criteria. One reported that fecal microbiota therapy was dominant (more 
effective and less expensive) compared with vancomycin; the other reported an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $17,016 USD per quality-adjusted 
life-year for fecal microbiota therapy compared with vancomycin. This ratio for 
the second study indicated that there would be additional cost associated with 
each recurrent C. difficile infection resolved. In Ontario, if fecal microbiota 
therapy were adopted to treat recurrent C. difficile infection, considering it 
from the perspective of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care as the payer, 
an estimated $1.5 million would be saved after the first year of adoption and 
$2.9 million after 3 years. The contradiction between the second economic 
evaluation and the savings we estimated may be a result of the lower cost of 
fecal microbiota therapy and hospitalization in Ontario compared with the cost 
of therapy used in the US model. Physicians reported that C. difficile infection 
significantly reduced patients' quality of life. Physicians saw fecal microbiota 
therapy as improving patients' quality of life because patients could resume 
daily activities. Physicians reported that their patients were happy with the 
procedures required to receive fecal microbiota therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, fecal microbiota 
therapy improves outcomes that are important to patients and provides good value 
for money.

Future climate change is likely to affect distributions of species, disrupt 
biotic interactions, and cause spatial incongruity of predator-prey habitats. 
Understanding the impacts of future climate change on species distribution will 
help in the formulation of conservation policies to reduce the risks of future 
biodiversity losses. Using a species distribution modeling approach by MaxEnt, 
we modeled current and future distributions of snow leopard (Panthera uncia) and 
its common prey, blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur), and observed the changes in niche 
overlap in the Nepal Himalaya. Annual mean temperature is the major climatic 
factor responsible for the snow leopard and blue sheep distributions in the 
energy-deficient environments of high altitudes. Currently, about 15.32% and 
15.93% area of the Nepal Himalaya are suitable for snow leopard and blue sheep 
habitats, respectively. The bioclimatic models show that the current suitable 
habitats of both snow leopard and blue sheep will be reduced under future 
climate change. The predicted suitable habitat of the snow leopard is decreased 
when blue sheep habitats is incorporated in the model. Our climate-only model 
shows that only 11.64% (17,190 km(2)) area of Nepal is suitable for the snow 
leopard under current climate and the suitable habitat reduces to 5,435 km(2) 
(reduced by 24.02%) after incorporating the predicted distribution of blue 
sheep. The predicted distribution of snow leopard reduces by 14.57% in 2030 and 
by 21.57% in 2050 when the predicted distribution of blue sheep is included as 
compared to 1.98% reduction in 2030 and 3.80% reduction in 2050 based on the 
climate-only model. It is predicted that future climate may alter the 
predator-prey spatial interaction inducing a lower degree of overlap and a 
higher degree of mismatch between snow leopard and blue sheep niches. This 
suggests increased energetic costs of finding preferred prey for snow leopards - 
a species already facing energetic constraints due to the limited dietary 
resources in its alpine habitat. Our findings provide valuable information for 
extension of protected areas in future.

Background The incidence of degenerative aortic valve diseases has increased 
along with the life expectancy of our population. Although conventional aortic 
valve replacement (AVR) is the gold standard for symptomatic aortic stenosis, 
transcatheter procedures have proven to be a valid therapeutic option in 
high-risk patients. The aim of this study was to compare these procedures in a 
high-risk cohort. Methods We retrospectively analyzed all symptomatic (dyspnea 
or angina) high-risk patients (logistic EuroSCORE ≥ 15%) fulfilling the 
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) indications. Most of the AVR 
patients (n = 180) were operated on before the implementation of TAVI. All TAVI 
procedures (n = 127) were performed transapically (TA). After matching for age, 
logistic EuroSCORE, and left ventricular ejection fraction, 82 pairs of patients 
were evaluated. Results When comparing AVR with TA-TAVI, there was no difference 
between groups in survival after 1 year (Kaplan-Meier analysis, 81.1% [95% CI: 
72.5-89.7%] vs. 75.8% [95% CI: 66.2-75.9%], Log tank p = 0.660) and the 
complication rates (n for AVR vs. TA-TAVI: stroke, 2 vs. 0, p = 0.580; acute 
renal insufficiency, 8 vs. 12, p = 0.340; atrial fibrillation, 24 vs. 26, 
p = 0.813; pacemaker implantation, 4 vs. 4, p > 0.999). In addition, quality of 
life did not differ between groups. Patients in the TA-TAVI group had lower mean 
valvular gradients postoperatively compared with the AVR group (14.6 ± 6.6 vs. 
10.2 ± 4.9 mm Hg, p < 0.001). Conclusion For high-risk patients, the TAVI 
procedure is comparable with conventional AVR, but is not advantageous. These 
results do not support the expansion of TAVI to low- or intermediate-risk 
patients.

PURPOSE: The goal of chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is to 
prolong survival and maintain health-related quality of life. This study aimed 
to evaluate long-term health status of patients with MBC who participated in the 
phase III randomized SELECT BC trial.
METHODS: In the SELECT BC trial, patients were randomly allocated to the S-1 or 
taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) arm. Health status was assessed by EQ-5D at 
pre-treatment, 3 and 6 months after randomization, and every 6 months thereafter 
to the extent possible. Least square mean scores were assessed to compare EQ-5D 
index values between groups. Time to deterioration analysis was also performed 
by defining the minimally important difference of EQ-5D as 0.05 or 0.1.
RESULTS: The number of patients for EQ-5D analysis was 175 and 208 in the taxane 
and S-1 arms, respectively. Least square mean EQ-5D index values up to 60 months 
were 0.741 (95 % CI [0.713-0.769]) in the taxane arm and 0.748 [0.722-0.775] in 
the S-1 arm. The EQ-5D index value during PFS up to 12 months in the S-1 was 
superior to the corresponding index value in the taxane (0.812 [0.789-0.834] vs. 
0.772 [0.751-0.792], P = 0.009). Time to deterioration analysis also revealed 
that S-1 significantly delayed the deterioration of EQ-5D index value during the 
period before progression (P = 0.002 and 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the EQ-5D index value was higher in 
patients treated with S-1 during first-line chemotherapy. Considering 
non-inferiority of S-1 in terms of OS, obtained quality-adjusted life years may 
be greater in the S-1 arm.

Recombinant expression of proteins has become an indispensable tool in modern 
day research. The large yields of recombinantly expressed proteins accelerate 
the structural and functional characterization of proteins. Nevertheless, there 
are literature reported that the recombinant proteins show some differences in 
structure and function as compared with the native ones. Now there have been 
more than 100,000 structures (from both recombinant and native sources) publicly 
available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) archive, which makes it possible to 
investigate if there exist any proteins in the RCSB PDB archive that have 
identical sequence but have some difference in structures. In this paper, we 
present the results of a systematic comparative study of the 3D structures of 
identical naturally purified versus recombinantly expressed proteins. The 
structural data and sequence information of the proteins were mined from the 
RCSB PDB archive. The combinatorial extension (CE), FATCAT-flexible and TM-Align 
methods were employed to align the protein structures. The root-mean-square 
distance (RMSD), TM-score, P-value, Z-score, secondary structural elements and 
hydrogen bonds were used to assess the structure similarity. A thorough analysis 
of the PDB archive generated five-hundred-seventeen pairs of native and 
recombinant proteins that have identical sequence. There were no pairs of 
proteins that had the same sequence and significantly different structural fold, 
which support the hypothesis that expression in a heterologous host usually 
could fold correctly into their native forms.

HYPOTHESIS: Cochlear implantation (CI) and deaf education are cost effective 
management strategies of childhood profound sensorineural hearing loss in Latin 
America.
BACKGROUND: CI has been widely established as cost effective in North America 
and Europe and is considered standard of care in those regions, yet cost 
effectiveness in other economic environments has not been explored. With 80% of 
the global hearing loss burden existing in low- and middle-income countries, 
developing cost effective management strategies in these settings is essential. 
This analysis represents the continuation of a global assessment of CI and deaf 
education cost effectiveness.
METHODS: Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Trinidad and Tobago, 
and Venezuela participated in the study. A Disability Adjusted Life Years model 
was applied with 3% discounting and 10-year length of analysis. Experts from 
each country supplied cost estimates from known costs and published data. 
Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of device cost, 
professional salaries, annual number of implants, and probability of device 
failure. Cost effectiveness was determined using the World Health Organization 
standard of cost effectiveness ratio/gross domestic product per capita 
(CER/GDP)<3.
RESULTS: Deaf education was very cost effective in all countries (CER/GDP 
0.07-0.93). CI was cost effective in all countries (CER/GDP 0.69-2.96), with 
borderline cost effectiveness in the Guatemalan sensitivity analysis (Max 
CER/GDP 3.21).
CONCLUSION: Both cochlear implantation and deaf education are widely cost 
effective in Latin America. In the lower-middle income economy of Guatemala, 
implant cost may have a larger impact. GDP is less influential in the middle- 
and high-income economies included in this study.

The implementation of effective early detection programs has significantly 
improved treatment, prognosis, and life expectancy in breast, prostate, and 
colorectal cancers. Early-detection methods need to be developed for pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where progress during the past decades has 
remained slow. Addressing this need, the forum "Early Detection: Lessons Learned 
from Other Cancers" was held in November 2015 and presented by the Kenner Family 
Research Fund in partnership with the American Pancreatic Association. Leading 
experts from breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers described the development 
of early detection methods in their respective fields. Emerging opportunities 
for scientific advancement were subsequently identified that hold the greatest 
promise for the future of early detection in PDAC, including a 4-part strategic 
map of necessary actionable items. Knowledge from other fields must be applied 
to achieve large-scale change within the arena of PDAC. A major breakthrough in 
early detection of PDAC will occur only through a definitive interdisciplinary 
collaborative effort involving a critical mass of committed academic research 
institutions, government agencies, industry leaders, and philanthropies.

The extension in human lifespan in the last century results in a significant 
increase in incidence of age related diseases. It is therefore crucial to 
identify key factors that control elderly healthspan. Similar to dietary 
restriction, mice overexpressing the NAD+ dependent protein deacylase SIRT6 
(MOSES) live longer and have reduced IGF-1 levels. However, it is as yet unknown 
whether SIRT6 also affects various healthspan parameters. Here, a range of age 
related phenotypes was evaluated in MOSES mice. In comparison to their wild-type 
(WT) littermates, old MOSES mice showed amelioration of a variety of age-related 
disorders, including: improved glucose tolerance, younger hormonal profile, 
reduced age-related adipose inflammation and increased physical activity. The 
increased activity was accompanied with increased muscle AMP-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK) activity. Altogether, these results indicate that overexpression 
of SIRT6 in mice retards important aspects of the aging process and suggest 
SIRT6 to be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of a set of 
age-related disorders.

BACKGROUND: Income, air pollution, obesity, and smoking are primary factors 
associated with human health and longevity in population-based studies. These 
four factors may have countervailing impacts on longevity. This analysis 
investigates longevity trade-offs between air pollution and income, and explores 
how relative effects of income and air pollution on human longevity are 
potentially influenced by accounting for smoking and obesity.
METHODS: County-level data from 2,996 U.S. counties were analyzed in a 
cross-sectional analysis to investigate relationships between longevity and the 
four factors of interest: air pollution (mean 1999-2008 PM2.5), median income, 
smoking, and obesity. Two longevity measures were used: life expectancy (LE) and 
an exceptional aging (EA) index. Linear regression, generalized additive 
regression models, and bivariate thin-plate smoothing splines were used to 
estimate the benefits of living in counties with higher incomes or lower PM2.5. 
Models were estimated with and without controls for smoking, obesity, and other 
factors.
RESULTS: Models which account for smoking and obesity result in substantially 
smaller estimates of the effects of income and pollution on longevity. Linear 
regression models without these two variables estimate that a $1,000 increase in 
median income (1 μg/m(3) decrease in PM2.5) corresponds to a 27.39 (33.68) 
increase in EA and a 0.14 (0.12) increase in LE, whereas models that control for 
smoking and obesity estimate only a 12.32 (20.22) increase in EA and a 0.07 
(0.05) increase in LE. Nonlinear models and thin-plate smoothing splines also 
illustrate that, at higher levels of income, the relative benefits of the 
income-pollution tradeoff changed-the benefit of higher incomes diminished 
relative to the benefit of lower air pollution exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher incomes and lower levels of air pollution both correspond 
with increased human longevity. Adjusting for smoking and obesity reduces 
estimates of the benefits of higher income and lower air pollution exposure. 
This adjustment also alters the tradeoff between income and pollution: increases 
in income become less beneficial relative to a fixed reduction in air 
pollution-especially at higher levels of income.

CONTEXT: Distress and anxiety about issues related to death and dying is 
commonly experienced in patients with advanced disease and a limited life 
expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the German version of the 
Death and Dying Distress Scale (DADDS-G) in advanced cancer patients.
METHODS: We recruited advanced patients with mixed tumor entities (Union for 
International Cancer Control [UICC] Stage III/IV) treated in two German 
University Medical Centers during their outpatient treatment. After testing a 
preliminary version of the state-of-the-art translated original Death and Dying 
Distress Scale, we analyzed the psychometric properties of the shortened 
nine-item adapted DADDS-G using validated instruments measuring distress, 
anxiety, depression, fear of progression, and quality of life.
RESULTS: We obtained complete questionnaires from 77 of 93 patients with 
advanced cancer (response rate: 83%). Participants were mostly married or 
cohabiting (75%), well-educated, and both sexes were almost equally represented 
(52% men; mean age 58 years, SD = 12). The total mean DADDS-G score was 13.3 
(SD = 8.5). Patients reported to be most distressed by the feeling of being a 
burden to others. The exploratory factor analysis led to one factor that 
accounted for more than 59% of the variance. The DADDS-G's internal consistency 
was excellent with Cronbach alpha = 0.91. The confirmatory factor analysis 
demonstrated a very good model fit. Death-related anxiety was significantly 
associated with distress, depression, anxiety, fear of progression, and lower 
quality of life (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Results provide further evidence that the DADDS-G is a valid and 
reliable instrument of high clinical relevance for use in patients with advanced 
cancer.

Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are chronic 
myeloproliferative neoplasms associated with thrombotic or hemorrhagic 
complications, and increased risk of transformation to myelofibrosis and acute 
myeloid leukemia. The main goal of therapy is aimed at preventing vascular 
events that are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. 
Accordingly, risk stratification is the basis for deciding when to treat a 
patient with cytoreductive therapy. The European LeukemiaNet has developed a 
series of management recommendations for front-line and second-line therapy to 
provide the optimal treatment for the individual patient. There is still 
controversy about the efficacy and safety of several modalities of cytoreductive 
treatment in the long-term for both diseases and in the use of antiplatelet 
therapy in ET. The presence of JAK2V617F and CALR mutations in patients with ET 
has been related to different thrombotic risks, and this will probably lead to 
different therapeutic approaches in the near future. On the other hand, the near 
normal life expectancy of these patients makes a careful analysis of the 
benefits and risks associated with treatment essential. This review provides our 
current management strategy of patients with polycythemia vera and ET.

BACKGROUND: Japan's first guidelines for parenteral fluid management for 
terminal cancer patients were issued in 2006. These guidelines focused on the 
fluid levels to administer to patients with a remaining life expectancy of 1-2 
months. However, recent refinement of the concept of cachexia is prompting 
caregivers worldwide to rethink parenteral fluid management for terminal cancer 
patients.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop guidelines for parenteral fluid 
management for terminal cancer patients with a remaining life expectancy of 1 
month, a point when cachexia generally begins to severely adversely affect the 
body.
METHODS: The Japanese Society for Palliative Medicine appointed a Guidelines 
Working Practitioner Group consisting of a multidisciplinary team of 
specialists. In response to 26 clinical questions on parenteral fluid management 
for terminal cancer patients, the Working Group used the Delphi method to reach 
consensus on the recommendability and evidence level of 89 relevant manuscripts 
identified through a systematic literature review. The Working Group then had an 
outside committee reviews the draft guidelines validity before authoring the 
final version.
RESULTS: The resulting clinically aligned guidelines contain specific 
recommendations (25 recommendations on physical suffering/remaining life 
expectancy, 10 nursing-related recommendations and 4 ethical recommendations) 
assessed using the Delphi method and by an outside committee.
CONCLUSIONS: Japanese Society for Palliative Medicine released a revised edition 
of the Guidelines for Parenteral Fluid Management for Terminal Cancer Patients, 
which are based on medical evidence and consider the pathologic features of 
cachexia. We recommend that caregivers carefully evaluate the clinical 
usefulness of the guidelines.

OBJECTIVE: To better understand the role of hope among terminally ill cancer 
patients.
DESIGN: Qualitative analysis.
SETTING: A tertiary specialized cancer centre in Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: Cancer patients in palliative care with an estimated remaining 
life expectancy of 12 months or less (N = 12) and their loved ones (N = 12) and 
treating physicians (N = 12).
METHODS: Each patient underwent up to 3 interviews and identified a loved one 
who participated in 1 interview. Treating physicians were also interviewed. All 
interviews were fully transcribed and analyzed by at least 2 investigators. 
Interviews were collected until saturation occurred.
MAIN FINDINGS: Seven attributes describe the experiences of palliative cancer 
patients and their caregivers: hope as an irrational phenomenon that is a deeply 
rooted, affect-based response to adversity; initial hope for miraculous healing; 
hope as a phenomenon that changes over time, evolving in different ways 
depending on circumstances; hope for prolonged life when there is no further 
hope for cure; hope for a good quality of life when the possibility of 
prolonging life becomes limited; a lack of hope for some when treatments are no 
longer effective in curbing illness progression; and for others hope as enjoying 
the present moment and preparing for the end of life.
CONCLUSION: Approaches aimed at sustaining hope need to reflect that patients' 
reactions might fluctuate between despair and a form of acceptance that leads to 
a certain serenity. Clinicians need to maintain some degree of hope while 
remaining as realistic as possible. The findings also raise questions about how 
hope influences patients' perceptions and acceptance of their treatments.

OBJECTIF: Mieux comprendre le rôle de l’espoir chez un patient cancéreux en 
phase terminale.
TYPE D’ÉTUDE: Analyse qualitative.
CONTEXTE: Un établissement tertiaire spécialisé en oncologie situé au Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: Des patients cancéreux en phase palliative avec une espérance de 
vie estimée à moins d’un an (N = 12), leurs proches (N = 12) et leurs médecins 
traitants (N = 12).
MÉTHODES: Les patients ont été interviewés jusqu’à 3 reprises; chacun a désigné 
un proche qui a été interviewé une fois. Toutes les entrevues ont été 
transcrites intégralement et analysées par au moins 2 chercheurs. On a effectué 
des entrevues jusqu’à l’atteinte de la saturation.
PRINCIPALES OBSERVATIONS: Des patients en phase terminale et leurs soignants ont 
décrit leur expérience à l’aide de 7 caractéristiques : l’espoir comme un 
phénomène irrationnel profondément ancré, correspondant à une réaction affective 
à l’adversité; l’espoir initial d’une guérison miraculeuse; l’espoir comme un 
phénomène qui change avec le temps et qui évolue différemment selon les 
circonstances; l’espoir de vivre plus longtemps même s’il n’y a plus d’espoir de 
guérison; l’espoir d’une bonne qualité de vie lorsque la possibilité de vivre 
plus longtemps est de plus en plus limitée; pour certains, une diminution de 
l’espoir quand les traitements n’arrivent plus à ralentir la progression de la 
maladie; et pour d’autres, une forme d’espoir qui consiste à apprécier le moment 
présent et à se préparer à mourir.
CONCLUSION: Les façons de soutenir l’espoir chez un patient doivent tenir compte 
du fait que ses réactions peuvent fluctuer entre le désespoir et une forme 
d’acceptation menant à une certaine sérénité. Le clinicien se doit de maintenir 
un certain degré d’espoir tout en demeurant le plus réaliste possible. Les 
présentes observations nous amènent également à nous demander comment l’espoir 
modifie la façon dont le patient perçoit son traitement et comment il l’accepte.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an intensively studied part of medicine based on 
free radicals. These reactive species, extremely harmful for whole human 
organism, are used for eradication numerous diseases. Specific structure of ill 
tissues causes accumulation free radicals inside them without attack remaining 
healthy tissues. A rapid development of medicine and scientific research has led 
to extension of PDT towards treatment many diseases such as cancer, herpes, acne 
and based on antimicrobials. The presented review article is focused on the 
aforementioned disorders with accurate analysis of the newest available 
scientific achievements. The discussed cases explicitly indicate on high 
efficacy of the therapy. In most cases, free radicals turned out to be solution 
of many afflictions. Photodynamic therapy can be considered as promising 
treatment with comparable effectiveness but without side effects characteristic 
for chemotherapy.

Socioeconomic factors are associated with cancer incidence through complex and 
variable pathways. We assessed cancer incidence for all cancers combined and 27 
major types according to national human development levels. Using GLOBOCAN data 
for 184 countries, age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) were assessed by four 
levels (low, medium, high, very high) of the Human Development Index (HDI), a 
composite index of life expectancy, education, and gross national income. A 
strong positive relationship between overall cancer incidence and HDI level was 
observed. When comparing the ASR in very high HDI regions with that in low HDI 
regions, we observed a positive association ranging from 2 to 14 and 2 to 11 
times higher in males and females, respectively, depending on the cancer type. 
Positive dose-response relationships between the ASR and HDI level were observed 
in both sexes for the following cancer types: lung, pancreas, leukemia, 
gallbladder, colorectum, brain/nervous system, kidney, multiple myeloma, and 
thyroid. Positive associations were also observed for testicular, bladder, 
lip/oral cavity, and other pharyngeal cancers, Hodgkin lymphoma, and melanoma of 
the skin in males, and corpus uteri, breast, and ovarian cancers and non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma in females. A negative dose-response relationship was observed for 
cervical and other pharyngeal cancers and Kaposi sarcoma in females. Although 
the relationship between incidence and the HDI remained when assessed at the 
country-specific level, variations in risk within HDI levels were also observed. 
We highlight positive and negative associations between incidence and human 
development for most cancers, which will aid the planning of cancer control 
priorities among countries undergoing human development transitions.

AIMS: Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death worldwide. Safety and 
efficacy of lipid lowering therapy have been clearly established for either 
primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults. 
Nevertheless, the use of hypolipidemic drugs in elderly individuals, especially 
in the oldest ones, still raises some concerns. Aim of this paper is to review 
indications and limits of lipid lowering in advanced age, furnishing a practical 
medical attitude tempered by clinical and geriatric competences.
DATA SYNTHESIS: While figures from randomized controlled trials and from 
observational studies seem to support the use of lipid lowering drugs for 
secondary prevention in the elderly, drawing inferences from primary prevention 
in old populations is far more challenging. Although these pharmacological 
agents seem to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events, they do not 
prolong survival. In addition, there is some doubt about the cost-effectiveness 
of treatment because of a more delicate balance between benefit and potential 
adverse reactions. However, lipid-lowering drugs seem largely underutilized in 
older age, mainly due to safety concerns that must be reconsidered, at least in 
part, given the somewhat reassuring results deriving from specific cohort 
surveys.
CONCLUSIONS: Data on the use and on the effects of lipid lowering drugs in 
elderly populations are incomplete, especially those concerning very old 
subjects without established cardiovascular disease. Comprehensive guidelines 
for the management of dyslipidemias in this rapidly-growing population is a 
urgent need, and treatment should be based, besides the aforementioned 
considerations, on patient preferences, cognitive function and life expectancy.

This study aims to assess the current and future air pollution and associated 
health impacts in Pakistan. In this study, the Pakistan Integrated Energy Model 
(Pak-IEM) is used to assess current and future energy consumption in Pakistan. 
To assess air pollution levels and associated health impacts, we used the 
Greenhouse gas and Air pollution INteractions and Synergies (GAINS) model. A 
linkage has been established between both the models to feed the energy outputs 
from Pak-IEM into GAINS for exploring different scenarios. Mainly, the emissions 
of three air pollutants (SO2, NOx, and PM2.5) as well as the associated health 
impacts of increased emissions are assessed. Baseline emission scenario (BES) 
shows a growth in emissions of SO2, NOx, and PM2.5 by a factor of 2.4, 2.2, and 
2.5 between 2007 and 2030. In terms of health impacts, by 2030, annual mean 
concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5) would increase to more than 150 μg/m3 
in some parts of Punjab region of Pakistan, for which loss in statistical life 
expectancy is calculated to increase from 30 to 60 months in 2007 up to 
60-100 months in 2030 on average.

INTRODUCTION: People with serious mental illness experience substantially 
reduced life expectancy, likely due in part to their higher smoking rates 
relative to the general population. However, the extent to which smoking affects 
their life expectancy, independent of mental illness, is unknown. This study 
quantifies the potential contribution of smoking to reduced life expectancy 
among individuals with serious psychological distress (SPD), a measure that 
screens for serious mental illness in national surveys.
METHODS: A cohort of 328,110 U.S. adults was examined using the 1997-2009 
National Health Interview Surveys linked to the 2011 National Death Index. Cox 
models were used to estimate mortality hazard ratios for current smoking, former 
smoking, and SPD and construct life tables by smoking and SPD status. The 
smoking-attributable fraction of deaths by SPD status was calculated. Analyses 
were conducted in 2015.
RESULTS: Among those with SPD, being a current smoker doubles the risk of death. 
Current smokers with SPD lose 14.9 years of life relative to never smokers 
without SPD. Among never smokers, having SPD reduces life expectancy by 5.3 
years. Thus, smoking may account for up to two thirds of the difference in life 
expectancy between smokers with SPD and never smokers without SPD. One third of 
deaths among those with SPD can be attributed to smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: The life expectancy difference between current smokers with SPD and 
never smokers without SPD is primarily due to smoking. Aiding individuals with 
serious mental illness to avoid smoking will translate into sizeable gains in 
life expectancy.
