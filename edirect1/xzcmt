BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) 2016 provided comprehensive estimates of health loss globally. Decision 
makers in Kenya can use GBD subnational data to target health interventions and 
address county-level variation in the burden of disease.
METHODS: We used GBD 2016 estimates of life expectancy at birth, healthy life 
expectancy, all-cause and cause-specific mortality, years of life lost, years 
lived with disability, disability-adjusted life-years, and risk factors to 
analyse health by age and sex at the national and county levels in Kenya from 
1990 to 2016.
FINDINGS: The national all-cause mortality rate decreased from 850·3 (95% 
uncertainty interval [UI] 829·8-871·1) deaths per 100 000 in 1990 to 579·0 
(562·1-596·0) deaths per 100 000 in 2016. Under-5 mortality declined from 95·4 
(95% UI 90·1-101·3) deaths per 1000 livebirths in 1990 to 43·4 (36·9-51·2) 
deaths per 1000 livebirths in 2016, and maternal mortality fell from 315·7 
(242·9-399·4) deaths per 100 000 in 1990 to 257·6 (195·1-335·3) deaths per 
100 000 in 2016, with steeper declines after 2006 and heterogeneously across 
counties. Life expectancy at birth increased by 5·4 (95% UI 3·7-7·2) years, with 
higher gains in females than males in all but ten counties. Unsafe water, 
sanitation, and handwashing, unsafe sex, and malnutrition were the leading 
national risk factors in 2016.
INTERPRETATION: Health outcomes have improved in Kenya since 2006. The burden of 
communicable diseases decreased but continues to predominate the total disease 
burden in 2016, whereas the non-communicable disease burden increased. Health 
gains varied strikingly across counties, indicating targeted approaches for 
health policy are necessary.

Scytonemin is a dimeric indole-phenol sunscreen synthesized by some 
cyanobacteria under conditions of exposure to UVA radiation. While its 
biosynthetic pathway has been elucidated only partially, comparative genomics 
reveals that the scytonemin operon often contains a cluster of five highly 
conserved genes (ebo cluster) of unknown function that is widespread and 
conserved among several bacterial and algal phyla. We sought to elucidate the 
function of the ebo cluster in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme by 
constructing and analyzing in-frame deletion mutants (one for each ebo gene and 
one for the entire cluster). Under conditions of UVA induction, all ebo mutants 
were scytoneminless, and all accumulated a single compound, the scytonemin 
monomer, clearly implicating all ebo genes in scytonemin production. We showed 
that the scytonemin monomer also accumulated in an induced deletion mutant of 
scyE, a non-ebo scytonemin gene whose product is demonstrably targeted to the 
periplasm. Confocal autofluorescence microscopy revealed that the accumulation 
was confined to the cytoplasm in all ebo mutants but that that was not the case 
in the scyE deletion, with an intact ebo cluster, where the scytonemin monomer 
was also excreted to the periplasm. The results implicate the ebo cluster in the 
export of the scytonemin monomer to the periplasm for final oxidative 
dimerization by ScyE. By extension, the ebo gene cluster may play similar roles 
in metabolite translocation across many bacterial phyla. We discuss potential 
mechanisms for such a role on the basis of structural and phylogenetic 
considerations of the ebo proteins.IMPORTANCE Elucidating the biochemical and 
genetic basis of scytonemin constitutes an interesting challenge because of its 
unique structure and the unusual fact that it is partially synthesized in the 
periplasmic space. Our work points to the ebo gene cluster, associated with the 
scytonemin operon of cyanobacteria, as being responsible for the excretion of 
scytonemin intermediates from the cytoplasm into the periplasm during 
biosynthesis. Few conserved systems have been described that facilitate the 
membrane translocation of small molecules. Because the ebo cluster is well 
conserved among a large diversity of bacteria and algae and yet insights into 
its potential function are lacking, our findings suggest that translocation of 
small molecules across the plasma membrane may be its generic role across 
microbes.

to Elevated CO(2) From the Perspective of Feeding Behavior Analysis.

Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is likely to influence 
insect-plant interactions. Aphid, as a typical phloem-feeding herbivorous 
insect, has shown consistently more positive responses in fitness to elevated 
CO2 concentrations than those seen in leaf-chewing insects. But, little is known 
about the mechanism of this performance. In this study, the foliar soluble 
constituents of cotton and the life history of the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii 
and its mean relative growth rate (MRGR) and feeding behavior were measured, as 
well as the relative transcript levels of target genes related appetite, 
salivary proteins, molting hormone (MH), and juvenile hormone, to investigate 
the fitness of A. gossypii in response to elevated CO2 (800 ppm vs. 400 ppm). 
The results indicated that elevated CO2 significantly stimulated the increase in 
concentrations of soluble proteins in the leaf and sucrose in seedlings. 
Significant increases in adult longevity, lifespan, fecundity, and MRGR of A. 
gossypii were found under elevated CO2 in contrast to ambient CO2. Furthermore, 
the feeding behavior of A. gossypii was significantly affected by elevated CO2, 
including significant shortening of the time of stylet penetration to phloem 
position and significant decrease in the mean frequency of xylem phase. It is 
presumed that the fitness of A. gossypii can be enhanced, resulting from the 
increases in nutrient sources and potential increase in the duration of phloem 
ingestion under elevated CO2 in contrast to ambient CO2. In addition, the qPCR 
results also demonstrated that the genes related to appetite and salivary 
proteins were significantly upregulated, whereas, the genes related to MH were 
significantly downregulated under elevated CO2 in contrast to ambient CO2, this 
is in accordance with the performance of A. gossypii in response to elevated 
CO2. In conclusion, rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration can enhance the 
fitness of A. gossypii by increasing their ingestion of higher quantity and 
higher quality of host plant tissues and by simultaneously upregulating the 
transcript expression of the genes related to appetite and salivary proteins, 
and then this may increase the control risk of A. gossypii under conditions of 
climate change in the future.

AIMS: To carry out a cost-utility analysis comparing the cost-effectiveness of 
levodopa carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) with standard of care (SOC) in patients 
with advanced Parkinson's Disease (aPD) unsuitable for apomorphine or deep brain 
stimulation (DBS). LCIG is the only treatment option in this small, but 
clinically important, population.
METHODS: A Markov model with 25 disease states based on disease stage and 
off-time status plus death. Patients enter the model with aPD spending >50% of 
their waking day in the off-state. Patients progress through the model in 
6-monthly cycles for 20 years to approximate lifetime treatment and capture 
long-term costs and effects of therapy. Inputs are based on LCIG clinical trials 
for clinical outcomes and health state utilities, the literature for health 
state transitions and use UK-based input data wherever possible (drug costs, 
disease/adverse event management costs, discontinuation rates, mortality rates).
LIMITATIONS: Data collection can be challenging in this small, elderly 
population with advanced disease, therefore some model inputs were estimated, 
rather than collected directly. It was assumed that a reduction in off-time was 
the only benefit after the first year of treatment with LCIG; this is a 
conservative approach, since there may be additional clinical benefits.
RESULTS: There is a considerable incremental gain in quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs) for patients treated with LCIG of 1.26 QALY with an associated 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £52,110. If the impact on 
caregivers is included, the ICER reduces to £47,266.
CONCLUSIONS: In cases where there is an orphan population, with no alternative 
treatment options, HTA assessments have a broader decision-making framework and 
the ICER is interpreted in this context. In the setting of a very small 
population, with considerable unmet need, LCIG represents value for money, as 
reflected by funding approval across the UK.

Sirtuins: Developing Innovative Treatments for Aged-Related Memory Loss and 
Alzheimer's Disease.

Maiese K(1).

(1)Cellular and Molecular Signaling, Newark, New Jersey 07101, United States.

The world's population continues to age at a rapid pace. By the year 2050, 
individuals over the age of 65 will account for sixteen percent of the world's 
population and life expectancy will increase well over eighty years of age. 
Accompanied by the aging of the global population is a significant rise in 
Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). Neurodegenerative disorders will form a 
significant component for NCDs. Currently, dementia is the 7th leading cause of 
death and can be the result of multiple causes that include diabetes mellitus, 
vascular disease, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). AD may represent at least sixty 
percent of these cases. Current treatment for these disorders is extremely 
limited to provide only some symptomatic relief at present. Sirtuins and in 
particular, the silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SIRT1), represent innovative strategies for the 
treatment of cognitive loss. New work has revealed that SIRT1 provides 
protection against memory loss through mechanisms that involve oxidative stress, 
Aβ toxicity, neurofibrillary degeneration, vascular injury, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, and neuronal loss. In addition, SIRT1 relies upon other avenues 
that can include trophic factors, such as erythropoietin, and signaling 
pathways, such as Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1/CCN4). Yet, 
SIRT1 can have detrimental effects as well that involve tumorigenesis and 
blockade of stem cell differentiation and maturation that can limit reparative 
processes for cognitive loss. Further investigations with sirtuins and SIRT1 
should be able to capitalize upon these novel targets for dementia and cognitive 
loss.

Projected Medicare Savings Associated With Lowering the Risk of Total Hip 
Arthroplasty Revision: An Administrative Claims Data Analysis.

Ackerman SJ, Knight T, Wahl PM.

In the United States, demand for total hip arthroplasty (THA) and THA revision 
procedures are increasing due to an aging population, a longer life expectancy, 
and an increasing prevalence of osteoarthritis. This retrospective cohort study 
identified patients 65 years and older in the Medicare 5% Standard Analytic 
Files who underwent THA for osteoarthritis between January 1, 2009, and 
September 30, 2010. The authors estimated the 5-year cumulative revision risk 
(CRR) using the Kaplan-Meier method, revision-related complications, and 
Medicare expenditures. Using a 6.22% compound annual growth rate from the 
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project of the Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality, the authors estimated the number of THAs that will be performed 
from 2018 to 2027 and calculated the 10-year projected savings to Medicare for a 
1% reduction in CRR. Among 7820 patients, the mean age was 74.4 years, and 62.4% 
were female. Cumulative revision risk was 4.2% at 5 years (through September 30, 
2015), with 30.8% of revisions occurring within 90 days of the THA. At least 
24.4% of revision patients had a complication. Median revision inpatient stay 
and episode of care (through 90 days) expenditures were $23,847 and $36,157, 
respectively. With a 1% absolute reduction in CRR, Medicare could save $697 
million over a 10-year period, or $985 million when including Medicare 
Advantage, which represented 29.2% of 2016 Medicare payments. Strategies to 
reduce the risk of THA revision, such as the use of implant constructs with 
lower CRR and value-based payment models, are needed to achieve Medicare payment 
reductions while maintaining or improving quality of care for Medicare 
beneficiaries. [Orthopedics. 2019; 42(1):e86-e92.].

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) has improved 
significantly over the past decades. However, there are sparse data documenting 
the co-morbidities and hospitalisation of adult patients with DS in the 
literature. The aim of this study was to characterise the co-morbidities and 
pattern of hospitalisation in adult patients with DS during a 10-year period at 
the community hospital as well as to compare hospitalisation parameters with the 
general adult population during the same years.
METHOD: We reviewed the medical records of 81 hospitalisations from 37 patients 
with DS aged 21 to 68 years at Metrowest Medical Center during a 10-year period 
and compared with those of the general adult population during the same time. 
Co-morbidities were also described.
RESULTS: Adults with DS had a mean age at admission of 48.6 ± 8.8 years with the 
median length of stay of 3 days (interquartile range 4 days). Male patients were 
hospitalised longer than female patients (mean 5.0 vs. 2.8 days; P < 0.05), and 
patients who lived at home were admitted at earlier ages than those who came 
from residential healthcare facility (mean 41.5 vs. 52.2 years; P < 0.001). The 
most common cause of hospitalisation was pneumonia/aspiration syndrome (29.6%), 
and the most common co-morbidity was gastroesophageal reflux disease 
(GERD)/dysphagia (70.3%). Presence of GERD/dysphagia or seizure disorder was 
significantly associated with multiple admission and readmission within 1 month 
(P < 0.05). The mortality rate was 4.9%, and the rate of intensive care unit 
admission was 8.6%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our cohort did not show statistically significant different 
hospitalisation parameters such as inpatient mortality and average length of 
stay when compared with general adult population hospitalised at the same years. 
The care of adult patients with DS presents challenges in internal medicine due 
to its unique co-morbid profile and signifies the importance of 
multidisciplinary approach. In order to improve the care of this patient 
population, their co-morbidities, particularly GERD/dysphagia and seizure 
disorder, should be optimally managed and comprehensively addressed when 
patients are hospitalised.

Healthcare value of implementing hepatitis C screening in the adult general 
population in Spain.

BACKGROUND: Elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection requires high 
diagnostic rates and universal access to treatment. Around 40% of infected 
individuals are unaware of their infection, which indicates that effective 
screening strategies are needed. We analyzed the efficiency (incremental 
cost-utility ratio, ICUR) of 3 HCV screening strategies: a) general population 
of adults, b) high-risk groups, and c) population with the highest anti-HCV 
prevalence plus high-risk groups.
METHODS: An analytical decision model, projecting progression of the disease 
over a lifetime, was used to establish the candidate population for HCV 
screening. HCV data were obtained from the literature: anti-HCV prevalence 
(0.56%-1.54%), viremic patients (31.5%), and percentage of undiagnosed persons 
among those with viremia (35%). It was assumed that most patients would be 
treated and have HCV therapy response (98% SVR); transition probabilities, 
utilities, and disease management annual costs were obtained from the 
literature. Efficiency over the life of patients under the National Health 
System perspective was measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and total 
cost (screening, diagnosis, pharmacological and disease management). A discount 
rate of 3% was applied to costs and outcomes.
RESULTS: Screening of the adult population would identify a larger number of 
additional chronic hepatitis C cases (N = 52,694) than screening the highest 
anti-HCV prevalence population plus high-risk groups (N = 42,027) or screening 
high-risk groups (N = 26,128). ICUR for the general population vs. high-risk 
groups was €8914/QALY gained per patient (€18,157 incremental cost and 2.037 
QALY). ICUR for the general population vs. population with highest anti-HCV 
prevalence plus high-risk groups was €7,448/QALY gained per patient (€7,733 
incremental cost and 1.038 QALY). These ICUR values are below the accepted 
efficiency threshold (€22,000-€30,000).
CONCLUSION: HCV screening and treatment of the general adult population is 
cost-effective compared to screening of high-risk groups or the population with 
the highest anti-HCV prevalence plus high-risk groups.

BACKGROUND: Utility scores are frequently used as preference weights when 
estimating quality-adjusted life years within cost-utility analyses or 
health-adjusted life expectancies. Though previous Canadian estimates for 
specific chronic conditions have been produced, these may no longer reflect 
current patient populations.
DATA AND METHODS: Data from the 2013 and 2014 Canadian Community Health Survey 
were used to provide Canadian utility score norms for 17 chronic conditions. 
Utility scores were estimated using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 instrument 
and were reported as weighted average (95% confidence intervals [95% CI]) 
values. In addition to age- and sex-stratified analyses, results were also 
stratified according to the number of reported chronic conditions (i.e., "none" 
to "five or more"). All results were weighted using sampling and bootstrapped 
weights provided by Statistics Canada.
RESULTS: Utility scores were estimated for 123,654 (97.2%) respondents (weighted 
frequency = 29,337,370 [97.7%]). Of the chronic conditions that were examined, 
asthma had the least detrimental effect (weighted average utility score = 0.803 
[95% CI: 0.795 to 0.811]) on respondents' utility scores, and Alzheimer's 
disease or any other dementia had the most detrimental effect (weighted average 
utility score = 0.374 [95% CI: 0.323 to 0.426]). Respondents who reported 
suffering from no chronic conditions had, on average, the highest utility scores 
(weighted average utility score = 0.928 [95% CI: 0.926 to 0.930]). Estimates 
dropped as a function of the number of reported chronic conditions.
DISCUSSION: Utility scores differed between various chronic conditions and as a 
function of the number of reported chronic conditions. Results also highlighted 
several differences with previously published Canadian utility norms.

Lower urinary tract neoplasia in companion animals is a debilitating and often 
life-threatening disease. Tumors of the bladder, urethra, and prostate often 
occur independently, although extension of these tumors into adjacent regions of 
the lower urinary tract is documented frequently. The most common lower urinary 
tract tumor in dogs and cats is transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). In both dogs 
and cats, TCC affecting the urinary bladder is generally considered to be highly 
aggressive with both local and metastatic disease potential, and this disease 
poses unique treatment challenges. Whereas much literature exists regarding the 
TCC disease process, treatment options, and prognosis in dogs, relatively few 
studies on feline TCC have been published due to the lower incidence of TCC in 
this species. Prostate tumors, most commonly adenocarcinomas, occur less 
commonly in dogs and cats but serve an important role as a comparative model for 
prostate neoplasia in humans. This article serves as a review of the current 
information regarding canine and feline lower urinary tract neoplasia as well as 
the relevance of these diseases with respect to their human counterparts.

Glioblastoma multiforme is the most malignant and aggressive type of brain 
tumor, with a mean life expectancy of less than 15 months. This is due in part 
to the high resistance to apoptosis and moderate resistant to autophagic cell 
death in glioblastoma cells, and to the poor therapeutic response to 
conventional therapies. Autophagic cell death represents an alternative 
mechanism to overcome the resistance of glioblastoma to pro-apoptosis-related 
therapies. Nevertheless, apoptosis induction plays a major conceptual role in 
several experimental studies to develop novel therapies against brain tumors. In 
this review, we outline the different components of the apoptotic and autophagic 
pathways and explore the mechanisms of resistance to these cell death pathways 
in glioblastoma cells. Finally, we discuss drugs with clinical and preclinical 
use that interfere with the mechanisms of survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, 
migration, invasion, and cell death of malignant cells, favoring the induction 
of apoptosis and autophagy, or the inhibition of the latter leading to cell 
death, as well as their therapeutic potential in glioma, and examine new 
perspectives in this promising research field.

The region of head and neck is critical for respiration, nutrition, and speech. 
The management of laryngeal tumours can stimulate mutilations and cosmetic 
deformities and worsen the life. A “non-operative approach” is preferred for 
patients to whom radiation following surgery, possibly, will direct severe 
functional destruction predominantly in advanced stage patients having a bulk of 
carcinoma larynx. The case material for the study was selected from the 
cross-section of patients registered at the J. K. Cancer Institute, Kanpur. 
Histologically squamous cell carcinoma 64 patients were registered and equally 
and randomly placed into Arm I and Arm II. “Arm I” patients and “Arm II” was 
comprised of randomly selected 64 patients, having histopathologically proven 
squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. All patients (32 patients) belonging to 
“Arm I” received concurrent chemoradiotherapy of Inj. Cisplatin 100 mg/m2 for 
three-weekly underwent EBRT with 60 Co/LINAC and photon radiation of 70 Gy in 35 
fractions for 7 weeks (2 parallel opposed fields). All the patients (32 
patients) belongs to “Arm II” received chemo boost as Inj. Cisplatin 6 mg/m2 on 
last 15 fractions of treatment underwent EBRT with 60 Co/ LINAC photon radiation 
of 70 Gy in 35 fractions for 7 weeks. Radiotherapy was delivered in supine 
position by parallel opposing fields including the primary tumour, disease 
extension, and neck nodes. The study concluded that the loco-regional responses 
are analogous in Arm I and Arm 2, however Arm II had additional treatment allied 
toxicities and resulting from numerous of treatment breaks.

BACKGROUND: The new HIV treatment guidelines in China recommend antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) for all people living with HIV, but significant gaps in 
implementation still exist. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can effectively 
reduce the risk of HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM). This 
study assessed the epidemiological impact and cost effectiveness of PrEP, 
enhanced biomedical interventions and their combination among MSM in China.
METHODS: A deterministic mathematical model was developed and projected over 
20 years to assess the impact of the PrEP, biomedical interventions and their 
combinations. Incidence and prevalence of HIV were measured, and 
cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost (international dollars, 
Int.$) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: A total of 0.78 million new HIV infections were estimated to occur over 
the next 20 years if no additional interventions are implemented among MSM. The 
PrEP-only strategy covering 25-75% of HIV-negative high-risk MSM can prevent 
0.09-0.20 million (12.1-25.7%) new infections, at a cost of 17,277-18,452 
Int.$/QALY. The optimal cost-effectiveness path is from test-and-treat to the 
combination strategy of test-and-treat and PrEP. Some strategies could almost 
eliminate new HIV infections over the next 20 years.
CONCLUSIONS: PrEP, test-and-treat, and their combinations among MSM are 
effective and cost-effective relative to current policy. PrEP is an important 
and cost-effective addition to current policy in China.

BACKGROUND: Obesity and the state of being overweight are increasing steadily 
and becoming a global epidemic. Recent research reports 64% of the adult 
population as overweight in Europe and the USA. The social and economic impacts 
are increasing, and most of the rehabilitation programs, while effective in the 
short term, do not produce long-lasting results. An explanatory model from a 
behavioral perspective can describe the phenomena with the lack of sources of 
reinforcement related to healthful habits in a daily life context.
METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial combining single-subject studies and 
a four-arm group design will be conducted to compare the effect of the current 
standard in obesity treatment to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and 
wearable technology at different times, before starting intervention, at the 
end, and at follow-up visits of 3, 6, and 12 months measuring changes over time 
of physical activity and psychological well-being.
DISCUSSION: The goal of this project, combining ACT and wearable technology, is 
to develop an effective intervention, efficient and sustainable, which even 
after discharge can provide adequate contingencies of reinforcement in the 
natural environment, integrating systematic measurements, continuous feedback, 
and individualized, values-based objectives. The intervention is aimed to 
provide a contingent reinforcement for healthful behaviors instead of 
reinforcing only the achievement of a significant weight loss. The aim of the 
project, combining Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Wearable Technology, is 
to develop an effective, efficient and sustainable intervention able to provide 
a contingent reinforcement for healthy behaviors. The intervention is aimed to 
promote adequate healthy behaviors in the natural environment, integrating 
systematic measurements, continuous feedback and individualized values-based 
objectives, instead of reinforcing only the achievement of a significant weight 
loss.

(1) Background: Mucilage within cacao pods contains high levels of polyphenols. 
We investigated whether consumption of cacao juice enhances the recovery of 
muscle function following intensive knee extension exercise. (2) Methods: Ten 
recreationally active males completed two trials of 10 sets of 10 single leg 
knee extensions at ~80% one repetition maximum. Participants consumed each 
supplement (ZumoCacao® juice, CJ or a dextrose drink, PL) for 7 days prior to 
and 48 h post exercise. Knee extension maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and a 
counter movement jump (CMJ) were performed at baseline, immediately, 24 h, and 
48 h post-exercise. Venous blood samples were collected at each time point and 
analyzed for indices of inflammation, oxidative damage, and muscle damage. (3) 
Results: CMJ height recovered faster with CJ at 24 h and 48 h post-exercise (p < 
0.05), but there was no effect of CJ on recovery of MVC (both p > 0.05). There 
was also no effect of the trial on any blood markers (all p > 0.05). (4) 
Conclusions: Supplementation with CJ for 7 days prior to and 2 days after 
intensive knee extensor exercise improved functional recovery as shown by an 
improved recovery of CMJ up to 48 h post-exercise. However, the precise 
mechanism of action is unclear and requires further investigation.

Natural killer (NK) cells are a very important component of the innate immune 
response involved in the lysis of virus infected and tumor cells. Aging has a 
profound impact in the frequency, phenotype and function of NK cells. Chronic 
Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is caused by the BCR-ABL gene formation encoding aberrant 
oncoprotein tyrosine kinase. Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
induces durable deep molecular response. The response to treatment and life 
expectancy is lower in older patients with chronic phase of CML than in younger 
patients. In this work we analyse NK cells from TKI-treated CML patients and 
healthy controls stratified according to age. We have analyzed the expression of 
NK receptors, activation markers, NK cell differentiation in CD56bright and 
CD56dim NK cell subsets and the expression of CD107a and IFN-γ in NK cells 
stimulated with K562. Whereas significant differences on the phenotype and 
function of NK cells were found between middle-aged (35-65 years old) and 
elderly (older than 65) healthy individuals, NK cells from TKI-treated CML 
patients do not show significant differences related with age in most parameters 
studied, indicating that age is not a limitation of the NK cell recovery after 
treatment with TKI. Our results also revealed differences in the expression of 
NK receptors, activation markers and functional assays in NK cells from 
TKI-treated CML patients compared with age-matched healthy controls. These 
results highlight the relevance of NK cells in TKI-treated patients and the need 
of an extensive analysis of the effect of aging on NK cell phenotype and 
function in these patients in order to define new NK-cell based strategies 
directed to control CML progression and achieve long-term disease remission 
after TKI cessation.

Background/Objective: Increased life expectancy has made quality of life the 
primary objective in the care of chronic patients and people living with HIV. It 
found evidence of the link between optimism, quality of life and well-being. 
This article aimed to determine whether affectivity in its two dimensions 
(positive and negative) played a mediating role in the association between 
optimism and quality of life in men living with HIV. Method: 116 men living with 
HIV (the average age was 36.8 years (SD=9.06), and the average time from the 
diagnosis was 8.2 years) responded to three instruments: Life Orientation Test 
revised version (LOT-R), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and 
the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref (WHOQoL-Bref). Results: The 
results showed that positive affect had no mediating effect, whereas negative 
affect mediated the relation of optimism with two quality-of-life dimensions 
(overall quality of life and environment). Conclusion: In conclusion, negative 
affect was found to participate only partially, acting as a mediating variable.

Publisher: Antecedente/Objetivos: El aumento de la esperanza de vida ha hecho de 
la calidad de vida (CV) el objetivo fundamental en el cuidado de pacientes 
crónicos y en personas que viven con VIH. Se ha encontrado evidencia del vínculo 
entre optimismo, calidad de vida y bienestar. El propósito del presente estudio 
fue determinar si la afectividad en sus dos dimensiones (positiva y negativa) 
desempeña un rol mediador en la asociación entre optimismo y calidad de vida en 
hombres viviendo con VIH que tienen sexo con hombres. Método: Cientodieciséis 
hombres con VIH (edad promedio fue de 36,8 años; DT = 9,06; tiempo medio desde 
el diagnóstico de 8,2 años) contestaron tres instrumentos: Life Orientation Test 
Revised Version (LOT-R), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) y World 
Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref (WHOQoL-Bref). Resultados: Los 
resultados mostraron que el afecto positivo no tuvo efecto mediador, mientras el 
afecto negativo medió la relación entre optimismo y dos dimensiones de la 
calidad de vida (calidad de vida general y ambiente). Conclusiones: Se encontró 
que el afecto negativo participa parcialmente como una variable mediadora entre 
el optimismo y calidad de vida.

Background/Objective: Ageing and progressive increase in life expectancy in 
people with intellectual disability present significant challenges. The present 
study is to examine the needs that arise in the aging process of this 
population. To detect these needs is fundamental to ensure personal wellbeing; 
almost no psychometrically sound instruments have been developed. Method: A 
structured interview was developed and evaluated by a panel of 20 experts to 
obtain evidence of content validity. The interview was then applied to 1,173 
people with intellectual disability. The ages ranged from 35 to 80 (M = 52.27; 
SD = 7.5). Results: The interview consisted of 93 items evaluating four areas: 
perceived needs, personal problems, future perspectives, and solutions required. 
The results demonstrated the proximity and relationship of the various needs 
evaluated. In addition it was observed that those with intellectual disability 
who were older, male and users of residential services tended to indicate more 
needs, problems, and required more solutions. Conclusions: The instrument has 
adequate evidence of validity, allowing the evaluation of specific needs of 
people with intellectual disability. The results advocate the design of 
transversal intervention policies in order to effectively meet the needs and 
requirements of this population.

Publisher: Introducción/Objetivo: El envejecimiento y progresivo incremento de 
la esperanza de vida de las personas con discapacidad intelectual supone 
importantes retos. El presente estudio examina las necesidades relacionadas con 
el proceso de envejecimiento de estas personas. La detección de dichas 
necesidades resulta fundamental para asegurar su bienestar personal, siendo 
necesarios instrumentos de evaluación que muestren garantías psicométricas. 
Método: Se elaboró una entrevista estructurada valorada por un panel de 20 
expertos para la obtención de evidencias de validez de contenido. La entrevista 
fue aplicada a 1.173 personas con discapacidad intelectual de entre 35 y 80 años 
(M = 52,27; DT = 7,5). Resultados: La entrevista consta de 93 ítems que evalúan 
cuatro áreas: necesidades percibidas, problemas personales, perspectivas de 
futuro y soluciones demandadas. Se muestra la proximidad e interacción de las 
diferentes necesidades evaluadas y la tendencia a que sean las personas con 
discapacidad intelectual de mayor edad, hombres y usuarios de servicios 
residenciales quienes refieran mayor número de necesidades y problemas, y 
demanden más soluciones. Conclusiones: El instrumento desarrollado muestra 
adecuadas evidencias de validez, permitiendo evaluar necesidades específicas de 
las personas con discapacidad intelectual. Los resultados abogan por el diseño 
de políticas de intervención transversales que permitan cubrir eficientemente 
las necesidades y demandas de este colectivo.
