Hypoglycemia due to underlying terminal illness in nondiabetic end-of-life 
patients receiving palliative care has not been fully studied. For example, we 
do not have adequate information on the frequency of spontaneous hypoglycemia in 
patients as occurs during the different stages of palliative care. Depending on 
the case-mix nature of the palliative care ward, at least 2% of palliative care 
patients may develop hypoglycemia near the end of life when the remaining life 
expectancy counts down in days. As many as 25%-60% of these patients will 
neither have autonomic response nor have neuroglycopenic symptoms during a 
hypoglycemic episode. Although it is not difficult to diagnose and confirm a 
true hypoglycemia when it is suspected clinically, an episode of hypoglycemic 
attack may go unnoticed in some patients in a hospice setting. Current trends in 
palliative care focus on providing treatments based on a prognosis-based 
framework, involving shared decision-making between the patient and caregivers, 
after considering the prognosis, professional recommendations, patient's 
autonomy, family expectations, and the current methods for treating the 
patient's physical symptoms and existential suffering. This paper provides 
professional care teams with both moral and literature support for providing 
care to nondiabetic patients presenting with hypoglycemia.

Small intestinal bleeding in Crohn's disease patients with noncirrhotic portal 
hypertension and partial portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis is a 
life-threatening event. Here, a case is reported in which treatment with 
azathioprine may have resulted in nodular regenerative hyperplasia, portal 
hypertension and portal vein thrombosis. The 56-year-old patient with Crohn's 
disease developed nodular regenerative hyperplasia under treatment with 
azathioprine. He was admitted with severe bleeding. Gastroscopy showed small 
esophageal varices without bleeding stigmata. Blood was detected in the terminal 
ileum. CT scan revealed a partial portal vein thrombosis with extension to the 
superior mesenteric vein, thickening of the jejunal wall and splenomegaly. 
Because intestinal bleeding could not be controlled by conservative treatment, 
the thrombus was aspirated and a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt 
(TIPS) was placed. Switching the immunosuppressive medication to infliximab 
controlled Crohn's disease activity. Bleeding was stopped, hemoglobin 
normalized, and thrombocytopenia and bowel movements improved. In summary, small 
intestinal bleeding in a Crohn's patient with nodular regenerative hyperplasia, 
portal hypertension and portal vein thrombosis can be efficiently treated by 
TIPS. TIPS placement together with infliximab treatment led to the improvement 
of the blood panel and remission in this patient.

The number of elderly people is growing at an unprecedented rate and this 
increase of the aging population is expected to have a direct impact on the 
incidence of age-related diseases and healthcare-associated costs. Thus, it is 
imperative that new tools are developed to fight and slow age-related diseases. 
Regenerative medicine is a promising strategy for the maintenance of health and 
function late in life; however, stem cell-based therapies face several 
challenges including rejection and tumor transformation. As an alternative, the 
placenta offers an extraordinary source of fetal stem cells, including the 
amniotic epithelial cells (AECs), which retain some of the characteristics of 
embryonic stem cells, but show low immunogenicity, together with 
immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. Because of these 
characteristics, AECs have been widely utilized in regenerative medicine. This 
perspective highlights different mechanisms triggered by transplanted AECs that 
could be potentially useful for anti-aging therapies, which include: Graft and 
differentiation for tissue regeneration in age-related settings, 
anti-inflammatory behavior to combat "inflammaging," anti-tumor activity, direct 
lifespan and healthspan extension properties, and possibly rejuvenation in a 
manner reminiscent of heterochronic parabiosis. Here, we critically discuss 
benefits and limitation of AECs-based therapies in age-related diseases.

Implantation of reverse shoulder endoprostheses is becoming more popular for 
elderly patients besides the well-established standard anatomic endoprostheses. 
The reasons for this are the increased life expectancy, age-dependent 
degeneration of the rotator cuff leading to cuff tear arthropathy, posttraumatic 
disability after failed osteosynthesis and primary reverse fracture 
arthroplasty. Stemless implants are more frequently used for primary 
osteoarthritis with the bone quality being the limiting factor. Modern implant 
systems allow the stepwise extension from bone preserving primary implants to 
modular and convertible revision implants that allow a partial exchange of 
components. Revision surgery, especially that of reverse arthroplasty, has 
limited potential for secondary treatment options and therefore implantation and 
revision should be performed in specialized treatment facilities.

BACKGROUND: Optimal surgical intervention for low-grade haemorrhoids is unknown. 
Rubber band ligation (RBL) is probably the most common intervention. 
Haemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) is a novel alternative that may be more 
efficacious.
OBJECTIVE: The comparison of HAL with RBL for the treatment of grade II/III 
haemorrhoids.
DESIGN: A multicentre, parallel-group randomised controlled trial.
PERSPECTIVE: UK NHS and Personal Social Services.
SETTING: 17 NHS Trusts.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥ 18 years presenting with grade II/III (second- and 
third-degree) haemorrhoids, including those who have undergone previous RBL.
INTERVENTIONS: HAL with Doppler probe compared with RBL.
OUTCOMES: Primary outcome - recurrence at 1 year post procedure; secondary 
outcomes - recurrence at 6 weeks; haemorrhoid severity score; European Quality 
of Life-5 Dimensions, 5-level version (EQ-5D-5L); Vaizey incontinence score; 
pain assessment; complications; and cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: A total of 370 participants entered the trial. At 1 year post 
procedure, 30% of the HAL group had evidence of recurrence compared with 49% 
after RBL [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 
3.51; p = 0.0005]. The main reason for the difference was the number of extra 
procedures required to achieve improvement/cure. If a single HAL is compared 
with multiple RBLs then only 37.5% recurred in the RBL arm (adjusted OR 1.35, 
95% CI 0.85 to 2.15; p = 0.20). Persistence of significant symptoms at 6 weeks 
was lower in both arms than at 1 year (9% HAL and 29% RBL), suggesting 
significant deterioration in both groups over the year. Symptom score, EQ-5D-5L 
and Vaizey score improved in both groups compared with baseline, but there was 
no difference between interventions. Pain was less severe and of shorter 
duration in the RBL group; most of the HAL group who had pain had mild to 
moderate pain, resolving by 3 weeks. Complications were low frequency and not 
significantly different between groups. It appeared that HAL was not 
cost-effective compared with RBL. In the base-case analysis, the difference in 
mean total costs was £1027 higher for HAL. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
were higher for HAL; however, the difference was very small (0.01) resulting in 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £104,427 per additional QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: At 1 year, although HAL resulted in fewer recurrences, recurrence 
was similar to repeat RBL. Symptom scores, complications, EQ-5D-5L and 
continence score were no different, and patients had more pain in the early 
postoperative period after HAL. HAL is more expensive and unlikely to be 
cost-effective in terms of incremental cost per QALY.
LIMITATIONS: Blinding of participants and site staff was not possible.
FUTURE WORK: The incidence of recurrence may continue to increase with time. 
Further follow-up would add to the evidence regarding long-term clinical 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The polysymptomatic nature of 
haemorrhoidal disease requires a validated scoring system, and the data from 
this trial will allow further assessment of validity of such a system. These 
data add to the literature regarding treatment of grade II/III haemorrhoids. The 
results dovetail with results from the eTHoS study [Watson AJM, Hudson J, Wood 
J, Kilonzo M, Brown SR, McDonald A, et al. Comparison of stapled 
haemorrhoidopexy with traditional excisional surgery for haemorrhoidal disease 
(eTHoS): a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. Lancet 2016, in 
press.] comparing stapled haemorrhoidectomy with excisional haemorrhoidectomy. 
Combined results will allow expansion of analysis, allowing surgeons to tailor 
their treatment options to individual patients.

AIMS OF THE STUDY: To assess the cost-effectiveness of primarily surgical 
treatment (PST) versus primarily conservative treatment (PCT) in adults with 
intermediate severity, acute or subacute, lumbar radicular syndrome due to 
intervertebral disc herniation.
METHODS: A decision analytic model from healthcare system and societal 
perspectives was used to compare outcomes and costs of PST with those of PCT 
(physiotherapy, epidural injection and medication). Treatment pathways and 
quality of life were obtained from published clinical trials. Costs were derived 
from Swiss health insurance claims data. Swiss clinical experts provided 
information on use of medication and physiotherapy. The main outcome of interest 
was incremental cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained over a period 
of 2 years. Costs and QALYs gained were discounted from the second year, at a 
rate of 2% per year.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis from a healthcare system perspective, over 2 
years, PST compared with PCT led to 0.0634 additional QALYs per person, at an 
additional net cost of CHF 7198 per person. The corresponding incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio (ICER) amounted to CHF 113 396 per QALY gained. From a 
societal perspective the ICER was CHF 70 711 per QALY gained. ICERs were subject 
to substantial uncertainty because of limitations in available data.
CONCLUSION: A PST approach, when compared with PCT, may be cost effective from a 
societal perspective based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF 100 000 per 
QALY gained. However, it is less likely to be cost effective from the 
perspective of the Swiss healthcare system. More research is needed to 
understand the long-term economic implications among this patient group.

BACKGROUND: Computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (cCBT) is an efficient form 
of therapy potentially improving access to psychological care. Indirect evidence 
suggests that the uptake and effectiveness of cCBT can be increased if 
facilitated by telephone, but this is not routinely offered in the NHS.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
telephone-facilitated free-to-use cCBT [e.g. MoodGYM (National Institute for 
Mental Health Research, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, 
Australia)] with minimally supported cCBT.
DESIGN: This study was a multisite, pragmatic, open, two-arm, parallel-group 
randomised controlled trial with a concurrent economic evaluation.
SETTING: Participants were recruited from GP practices in Bristol, Manchester, 
Sheffield, Hull and the north-east of England.
PARTICIPANTS: Potential participants were eligible to participate in the trial 
if they were adults with depression scoring ≥ 10 on the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised using a computer-generated random 
number sequence to receive minimally supported cCBT or telephone-facilitated 
cCBT. Participants continued with usual general practitioner care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was self-reported symptoms of 
depression, as assessed by the PHQ-9 at 4 months post randomisation.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Secondary outcomes were depression at 12 months and anxiety, 
somatoform complaints, health utility (as assessed by the European Quality of 
Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire) and resource use at 4 and 12 months.
RESULTS: Clinical effectiveness: 182 participants were randomised to minimally 
supported cCBT and 187 participants to telephone-facilitated cCBT. There was a 
difference in the severity of depression at 4 and 12 months, with lower levels 
in the telephone-facilitated group. The odds of no longer being depressed 
(defined as a PHQ-9 score of < 10) at 4 months were twice as high in the 
telephone-facilitated cCBT group [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 1.23 to 3.42]. The benefit of telephone-facilitated cCBT was no longer 
significant at 12 months (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.71). At 4 months the 
between-group difference in PHQ-9 scores was 1.9 (95% CI 0.5 to 3.3). At 12 
months the results still favoured telephone-facilitated cCBT but were no longer 
statistically significant, with a difference in PHQ-9 score of 0.9 (95% CI -0.5 
to 2.3). When considering the whole follow-up period, telephone-facilitated cCBT 
was asssociated with significantly lower PHQ-9 scores than minimally supported 
cCBT (mean difference -1.41, 95% CI -2.63 to -0.17; p = 0.025). There was a 
significant improvement in anxiety scores over the trial period (between-group 
difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.1 to 2.3; p = 0.037). In the case of somatic complaints 
(assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-15), there was a borderline 
statistically significant difference over the trial period (between-group 
difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.0 to 1.8; p = 0.051). There were gains in 
quality-adjusted life-years at reduced cost when telephone facilitation was 
added to MoodGYM. However, the results were subject to uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed short-term benefits from the addition of 
telephone facilitation to cCBT. The effect was small to moderate and comparable 
with that of other primary care psychological interventions. Telephone 
facilitation should be considered when offering cCBT for depression.
LIMITATIONS: Participants' depression was assessed with the PHQ-9, cCBT use was 
quite low and there was a slightly greater than anticipated loss to follow-up.
FUTURE RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS: Improve the acceptability of cCBT and its 
capacity to address coexisting disorders. Large-scale pragmatic trials of cCBT 
with bibliotherapy and telephone-based interventions are required.

Mortality has a significant role in prokaryotic ecology and evolution, yet the 
impact of variations in extrinsic mortality on prokaryotic genome evolution has 
received little attention. We used both mathematical and agent-based models to 
reveal how variations in extrinsic mortality affect prokaryotic genome 
evolution. Our results suggest that the genome size of bacteria increases with 
increased mortality. A high extrinsic mortality increases the pool of free 
resources and shortens life expectancy, which selects for faster reproduction, a 
phenotype we called 'scramblers'. This phenotype is realised by the expansion of 
gene families involved in nutrient acquisition and metabolism. In contrast, a 
low mortality rate increases an individual's life expectancy, which results in 
natural selection favouring tolerance to starvation when conditions are 
unfavourable. This leads to the evolution of small, streamlined genomes 
('stayers'). Our models predict that large genomes, gene family expansion and 
horizontal gene transfer should be observed in prokaryotes occupying ecosystems 
exposed to high abiotic stress, as well as those under strong predator- and/or 
pathogen-mediated selection. A comparison of genome size of cyanobacteria in 
relatively stable marine versus more turbulent freshwater environments 
corroborates our predictions, although other factors between these environments 
could also be responsible.

HIV-associated changes in the enteric microbial community: potential role in 
loss of homeostasis and development of systemic inflammation.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite HIV therapy advances, average life expectancy in 
HIV-infected individuals on effective treatment is significantly decreased 
relative to uninfected persons, largely because of increased incidence of 
inflammation-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and renal 
dysfunction. The enteric microbial community could potentially cause this 
inflammation, as HIV-driven destruction of gastrointestinal CD4 T cells may 
disturb the microbiota-mucosal immune system balance, disrupting the stable gut 
microbiome and leading to further deleterious host outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Varied enteric microbiome changes have been reported during HIV 
infection, but unifying patterns have emerged. Community diversity is decreased, 
similar to pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and 
Clostridium difficile infection. Many taxa frequently enriched in HIV-infected 
individuals, such as Enterobacteriaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae, have pathogenic 
potential, whereas depleted taxa, such as Bacteroidaceae and Ruminococcaceae, 
are more linked with anti-inflammatory properties and maintenance of gut 
homeostasis. The gut viral community in HIV has been found to contain a greater 
abundance of pathogenesis-associated Adenoviridae and Anelloviridae. These 
bacterial and viral changes correlate with increased systemic inflammatory 
markers, such as serum sCD14, sCD163, and IL-6.
SUMMARY: Enteric microbial community changes may contribute to chronic HIV 
pathogenesis, but more investigation is necessary, especially in the developing 
world population with the greatest HIV burden (Video, Supplemental Digital 
Content 1, http://links.lww.com/COID/A15, which includes the authors' summary of 
the importance of the work).

Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) differ from those with other 
transfusion-dependent conditions (eg, thalassemia) as they are typically older, 
have comorbid conditions, and a generally shorter life expectancy. The 
underlying disease process in MDS and frequent use of red blood cell 
transfusions lead to iron accumulation and ultimately organ damage. Whether 
iron-reducing interventions such as chelation therapy can improve outcomes in 
this population is currently under investigation. Areas covered: We reviewed 
published English-language articles from PubMed on the topic of iron overload 
(IO) in MDS, and the use of iron chelation therapies (ICTs) to alleviate iron 
burden. Expert commentary: Data on IO-associated complications in MDS are 
derived largely from retrospective studies and there are limited data to guide 
clinicians on major treatment decisions. Although effective and well-tolerated 
oral ICTs are available, and general recommendations may be made regarding usage 
in MDS, guidance is not yet based on prospective data. The clinical endpoints 
and assessments for MDS may differ substantively from those used in patients 
with thalassemia, as an older population may have competing causes for 
morbidity. We expect that emergent data from clinical trials currently underway 
will define more appropriate endpoints/assessments for the MDS population in 
clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Pressures on informal caregivers are likely to increase due to 
increasing life expectancy and health care costs, which stresses the importance 
of prevention of subjective burden. The present study examined the correlates of 
overall subjective burden and multiple burden dimensions among spousal and 
adult-child caregivers of Dutch older adults, both cross-sectional and 
longitudinal (12-months follow-up).
METHODS: In 2010 and 2011 baseline and follow-up data was collected in a sample 
of informal caregivers and care recipients in the Northern provinces of the 
Netherlands. Subjective burden included 7 burden dimensions and a summary score 
for overall subjective burden, based on the Care-Related Quality of Life 
Instrument (CarerQoL-7D). Objective stressors were the time investment in 
caregiving (hours of household care, personal care, practical care) and the 
health situation of the care recipient, including multimorbidity, functional 
limitations (Katz Index of Independence Basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL) 
and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), and cognitive functioning 
problems (EQ-5D + C). Correlates of subjective burden were evaluated with linear 
and logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: The sample consisted of 356 caregivers at baseline (43% spousal, 57% 
adult-child caregivers), and 158 caregivers at follow-up (45% spousal, 55% 
adult-child caregivers). At baseline and follow-up, spousal caregivers 
experienced a higher overall subjective burden, and reported more often mental 
health problems, physical health problems, and problems with combining daily 
activities, compared to adult-child caregivers. For spousal caregivers, a poorer 
health situation of the care recipient was associated with higher subjective 
burden, while adult-child caregivers reported higher levels of subjective burden 
when their time investment in caregiving was high. Subjective burden at 
follow-up was mainly explained by baseline subjective burden.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that for effective caregiver support, it is 
crucial to take the type of care relationship into account, since the level and 
correlates of overall subjective burden and burden dimensions varied for spousal 
and adult-child caregivers. In addition, reducing subjective burden will also 
positively impact the subjective burden over time.

BACKGROUND: We studied the safety, effectiveness, and limitations of airway 
stenting using self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) in patients with malignant 
central airway obstruction (CAO).
METHODS: A retrospective review of records of patients undergoing SEMS placement 
for malignant CAO during year 2013 - 2014 was done.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients (11 males and five females) underwent SEMS placement 
for malignant CAO. Median (range) age was 66 (54 - 78) years. No perioperative 
or immediate postoperative complications were seen except acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) in one patient. Three patients were transferred to intensive 
care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring after the procedure and were discharged 
the next day. All four patients with lung atelectasis on presentation 
experienced complete re-expansion of the lung post-stenting. The dyspnea was 
substantially relieved in 14 (87.5%) patients. Two of the three patients who had 
been intubated were weaned off from the ventilator following stent insertion. 
Stent patency was maintained until death in all patients except one. Median 
survival from the date of diagnosis and the date of stent placement in lung 
cancer, esophageal cancer, and thyroid cancer were 140 (21 - 564) and 85 (15 - 
361), 288 (80 - 419) and 61 (60 - 171), and 129 (71 - 187) and 67 (16 - 118) 
days, respectively. This survival was similar to reported expected survival 
associated with the underlying malignancy. During follow-up, granulation tissue 
(n = 1), mucostasis (n = 1), and tumor ingrowth (n = 2) were the most frequently 
encountered complications.
CONCLUSION: SEMSs are safe and effective in reversing respiratory failure caused 
by malignant CAO, averting premature death, allowing application of cancer 
targeted therapy, and restoring impending shortened survival to expected life 
expectancy associated with the underlying malignancy.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of CYP2C19 
loss-of-function and gain-of-function allele guided (LOF/GOF-guided) 
antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
METHODS: A life-long decision-analytic model was designed to simulate outcomes 
of three strategies: universal clopidogrel (75 mg daily), universal alternative 
P2Y12 inhibitor (prasugrel 10 mg daily or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily), and 
LOF/GOF-guided therapy (LOF/GOF allele carriers receiving alternative P2Y12 
inhibitor, wild-type patients receiving clopidogrel). Model outcomes included 
clinical event rates, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and direct 
medical costs from perspective of US healthcare provider.
RESULTS: Base-case analysis found nonfatal myocardial infarction (5.62%) and 
stent thrombosis (1.2%) to be the lowest in universal alternative P2Y12 
inhibitor arm, whereas nonfatal stroke (0.72%), cardiovascular death (2.42%), 
and major bleeding (2.73%) were lowest in LOF/GOF-guided group. LOF/GOF-guided 
arm gained the highest QALYs (7.5301 QALYs) at lowest life-long cost (USD 
76,450). One-way sensitivity analysis showed base-case results were subject to 
the hazard ratio of cardiovascular death in carriers versus non-carriers of LOF 
allele and hazard ratio of cardiovascular death in non-carriers of LOF allele 
versus general patients. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis of 10,000 Monte 
Carlo simulations, LOF/GOF-guided therapy, universal alternative P2Y12 
inhibitor, and universal clopidogrel were the preferred strategy 
(willingness-to-pay threshold = 50,000 USD/QALY) in 99.07%, 0.04%, and 0.89% of 
time, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Using both CYP2C19 GOF and LOF alleles to select antiplatelet 
therapy appears to be the preferred antiplatelet strategy over universal 
clopidogrel and universal alternative P2Y12 inhibitor therapy for ACS patients 
with PCI.

Heart disease is not only the leading cause of death in the U.S. but also the 
main contributor to racial disparities in life expectancy. Despite this, heart 
disease mortality rates and racial disparities in these rates are not readily 
available at the city level where they can be the most quickly and effectively 
addressed. We calculated age-adjusted heart disease mortality rates and 
corresponding racial rate ratios (RRs) and rate differences (RDs) for the 
non-Hispanic Black (Black) and non-Hispanic White (White) populations for the 
years 1990-1994 and 2005-2009 for the U.S. and the 50 largest cities therein. We 
then examined relationships between the disparities and city-level population 
indicators. Nationally, mortality rates were significantly higher among Blacks 
than Whites at both time periods. Larger improvements in rates for Whites 
compared to Blacks resulted in a significant increase in disparities over the 
20-year period for 11 cities. There were 19,448 excess Black deaths in the U.S. 
annually. City-level income inequality, as well as the overall city and White 
median household income, contributed to these disparities. By identifying 
city-specific disparities and trends, health care providers, public health 
agencies, and researchers can target the areas with the most need and can look 
at cities without disparities for clues on how to best advance health equity in 
heart disease morbidity and mortality.

BACKGROUND: The influenza A virus accounts for serious annual viral upper 
respiratory tract infections. It is constantly able to modify its antigenic 
structure, thus evading host defence mechanisms. Moreover, currently available 
anti-influenza agents have a rather limited application, emphasizing the further 
need for new effective treatments. One of them is ergoferon, a drug containing 
combined polyclonal antibodies - anti-interferon gamma, anti-CD4 receptor and 
anti-histamine - in released-active form. The purpose of the study was to assess 
ergoferon antiviral efficacy in mice challenged with the A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) 
influenza virus.
METHODS: The virus was inoculated intranasally at a 90% lethal dose. Ergoferon 
was administered at 0.4 ml/day per os in a preventive and therapeutic regimen - 
daily for 5 days prior to and for 16 days after the challenge. The reference 
product, Tamiflu (oseltamivir), was used as a positive control treatment - at 20 
mg/kg/day for 5 days after the challenge. Mice in the negative control group 
received distilled water which had been utilized for test sample preparation; 
untreated control animals received no treatment. Antiviral efficacy was assessed 
by an increase in survival rate, average life expectancy and virus titre 
reduction in the challenged mouse lungs.
RESULTS: Survival rate and average life expectancy values were increased 
significantly in groups treated with ergoferon and Tamiflu, as compared with 
controls. Lung virus titres were reduced in these groups as observed on days 2 
and 4 post-inoculation.
CONCLUSIONS: Ergoferon demonstrated antiviral activity by reducing the severity 
and duration of the major signs of induced influenza infection.

Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with 85% of the 
disease burden residing in less developed regions. To inform evidence-based 
decision-making as cervical cancer screening programs are planned, implemented, 
and scaled in low- and middle-income countries, we used cost and test 
performance data from the START-UP demonstration project in Uganda and a 
microsimulation model of HPV infection and cervical carcinogenesis to quantify 
the health benefits, distributional equity, cost-effectiveness, and financial 
impact of either (1) improving access to cervical cancer screening or (2) 
increasing the number of lifetime screening opportunities for women who already 
have access. We found that when baseline screening coverage was low (i.e., 30%), 
expanding coverage of screening once in a lifetime to 50% can yield comparable 
reductions in cancer risk to screening two or three times in a lifetime at 30% 
coverage, lead to greater reductions in health disparities, and cost 150 
international dollars (I$) per year of life saved (YLS). At higher baseline 
screening coverage levels (i.e., 70%), screening three times in a lifetime 
yielded greater health benefits than expanding screening once in a lifetime to 
90% coverage, and would have a cost-effectiveness ratio (I$590 per YLS) below 
Uganda's per capita GDP. Given very low baseline coverage at present, we 
conclude that a policy focus on increasing access for previously unscreened 
women appears to be more compatible with improving both equity and efficiency 
than a focus on increasing frequency for a small subset of women.

BACKGROUND: Radical surgery is associated with significant perioperative 
mortality in elderly and comorbid populations. Emerging data suggest for 
patients with a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy 
that a watch-and-wait approach may provide equivalent survival and oncological 
outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
watch and wait and radical surgery for patients with rectal cancer after a 
clinical complete response following chemoradiotherapy.
DESIGN: Decision analytical modeling and a Markov simulation were used to model 
long-term costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and cost-effectiveness after watch 
and wait and radical surgery. Sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the 
effect of uncertainty in model parameters.
SETTINGS: A third-party payer perspective was adopted.
PATIENTS: Patients included in the study were a 60-year-old male cohort with no 
comorbidities, 80-year-old male cohorts with no comorbidities, and 80-year-old 
male cohorts with significant comorbidities.
INTERVENTIONS: Radical surgery and watch-and-wait approaches were studied.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness 
ratio over the entire lifetime of the hypothetical patient cohorts were 
measured.
RESULTS: Watch and wait was more effective (60-year-old male cohort with no 
comorbidities = 0.63 quality-adjusted life-years (95% CI, 2.48-3.65 
quality-adjusted life-years); 80-year-old male cohort with no comorbidities = 
0.56 quality-adjusted life-years (95% CI, 0.52-1.59 quality-adjusted 
life-years); 80-year-old male cohort with significant comorbidities = 0.72 
quality-adjusted life-years (95% CI, 0.34-1.76 quality-adjusted life-years)) and 
less costly (60-year-old male cohort with no comorbidities = $11,332.35 (95% CI, 
$668.50-$23,970.20); 80-year-old male cohort with no comorbidities = $8783.93 
(95% CI, $2504.26-$21,900.66); 80-year-old male cohort with significant 
comorbidities = $10,206.01 (95% CI, $2762.014-$24,135.31)) independent of 
patient cohort age and comorbidity. Consequently, watch and wait was more 
cost-effective with a high degree of certainty (range, 69.6%-89.2%) at a 
threshold of $50,000/quality-adjusted life-year.
LIMITATIONS: Long-term outcomes were derived from modeled cohorts. Analysis was 
performed for a United Kingdom third-party payer perspective, limiting 
generalizability to other healthcare contexts.
CONCLUSIONS: Watch and wait is likely to be cost-effective compared with radical 
surgery. These findings strongly support the discussion of organ-preserving 
strategies with suitable patients.

Cost-Effectiveness of Direct-Acting Antiviral Treatment in Hepatitis C-Infected 
Liver Transplant Candidates With Compensated Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular 
Carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV)(+) donors represent an effective strategy to 
increase liver donor availability to HCV-infected recipients. However, many 
HCV(+) transplant candidates are now receiving treatment with direct-acting 
anti-viral (DAA) agents that lower the risk of posttransplant HCV recurrence but 
could make the patient ineligible for HCV(+) livers.
METHODS: We compared pretransplant DAA treatment versus deferred DAA treatment 
using a cost-effectiveness decision analysis model to estimate incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per quality-adjusted life year gained) from the 
societal perspective across a range of HCV(+) liver availability rates. For 
practical considerations, the population modeled was restricted to 
well-compensated HCV(+) cirrhotics listed for liver transplantation with 
hepatocellular carcinoma MELD exception points.
RESULTS: Under base case conditions, the deferred DAA treatment strategy was 
found to be the "dominant" strategy. That is, it provided superior health 
outcomes at cost savings compared to the pretransplant DAA treatment strategy. 
The pretransplant DAA treatment strategy trended towards cost-effectiveness as 
HCV(+) donor liver availability declined. However, only in 1 scenario that was 
highly optimized for favorable outcomes in the pretransplant DAA treatment arm 
(low availability of HCV(+) organs, low cost of DAA treatment, high cost of HCV 
recurrence) was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with HCV DAA 
treatment before transplant less than US $150 000/quality-adjusted life-year 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Deferring HCV treatment until after liver transplant and 
maintaining access to the expanded pool of HCV(+) donors appears to be the most 
cost-effective strategy for well-compensated HCV-infected cirrhotics listed for 
liver transplantation with hepatocellular carcinoma, even in geographic areas of 
relatively low HCV(+) donor availability.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of universal group B streptococci 
(GBS) screening in women with a singleton pregnancy planning a repeat cesarean 
delivery.
METHODS: We conducted a decision analysis from a health care perspective to 
compare the cost-effectiveness of GBS screening for women planning a repeat 
cesarean delivery. With universal screening, all GBS-positive women who labored 
before a scheduled cesarean delivery received antibiotic prophylaxis. With no 
screening, women who presented in labor received antibiotics based on risk-based
