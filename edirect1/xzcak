METHODS: Patients were recruited from the national registry January-June 2014. 
The inclusion criteria were adults, neurogenic UI due to spinal cord injury 
(SCI), use of collection devices and CIC for more than 6 months. The exclusion 
criteria were inability to perform CIC, cancer of the lower urinary tract and 
fistulas formation. Measurement tools were the International Consultation on 
Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF) and an 
estimation of life expectancy by the national registry. The calculation of the 
weighting factor (WF) was obtained by linear transformation of the ICIQ-UI SF 
total score. A score was transformed to the range from 0 (worst impact) to 1 (no 
impact). The QALYs was calculated as the weighting factor × life expectancy in 
years.
RESULTS: A total of 229/365 patients were involved in this study (63%). Patients 
before CIC reached an ICIQ mean score of 14.83, WF of 0.29, and QALYs of 9.02 
during life expectancy. After 6 months of follow-up using CIC, ICIQ reached 
9.12, WF 0.57 and QALYs 17.45. The number of QALYs increased by 93.5% and UI 
evaluated with the ICIQ-UI SF decreased by 38.5% (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The CIC of the urinary bladder statistically significantly 
increased the number of QALYs and reduced the degree of UI in SCI patients.

BACKGROUND: Personal hypertension management is a cornerstone in the prevention 
of hypertension complications. In Eritrea, the increase in the national life 
expectancy rate has been accompanied by an increase in hypertension 
complications such as stroke. Hence, this study was designed to identify 
barriers and facilitates to hypertension management from the perspective of the 
patients.
METHODS: This was a qualitative study of a total of 48 individual in-depth 
interviews and two focus group discussions. It was conducted among hypertensive 
patients who were attending outpatient services at two hospitals in Asmara, 
Eritrea.
RESULTS: This study identified barriers and facilitators of hypertension 
management related to the individual patient, family and community, and 
healthcare system. With respect to individual factors, economic barriers, 
stress, non-adherence to medications due to the use of traditional remedies, and 
difficulties and misconceptions about following physical activity guidelines 
were mentioned as barriers to hypertension management. Related to the community 
and healthcare system, low community awareness, community stigma, and inadequate 
health promotion materials were stated as barriers. Individual knowledge, 
family, and government support were reported as very important factors to the 
patient's success in the personal hypertension management.
CONCLUSIONS: Counseling patients about adherence to medication, strengthening 
family and government support, and empowering families and the community with 
appropriate knowledge of hypertension management could potentially help in an 
individual's adherence.

The aim of this study was the shelf life extension of whole-wheat breadsticks 
through the addition of a rosemary extract and packaging under nitrogen. Shelf 
life was studied at four temperatures (20, 27, 35, 48°C) for up to 200 storage 
days. The minimal changes observed in moisture, water activity and texture of 
the samples, coupled with the high peroxide values (13-539meqO2/kgfat) measured 
at the end of storage, and the exponential increase of hexanal concentrations 
(up to 13-34mg/kg) confirmed that quality decay of whole-wheat breadsticks is 
mainly associated to lipid oxidation. The kinetic study of oxidation development 
and the consumer sensory acceptance determined by the survival analysis 
demonstrated that the rosemary extract addition yields a 42% shelf life 
extension, higher than that observed using nitrogen in the package (24-29%). The 
combination of the formulation and packaging strategies gave the best result 
(83% shelf life extension at 25°C).

BACKGROUND: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends that women who 
carry gene variants that confer substantial risk for breast cancer consider 
risk-reduction strategies, that is, enhanced surveillance (breast magnetic 
resonance imaging and mammography) or prophylactic surgery. Pathogenic variants 
can be detected in women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer 
syndromes by multigene panel testing.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether using a seven-gene test to identify women who 
should consider risk-reduction strategies could cost-effectively increase life 
expectancy.
METHODS: We estimated effectiveness and lifetime costs from a payer perspective 
for two strategies in two hypothetical cohorts of women (40-year-old and 
50-year-old cohorts) who meet the National Comprehensive Cancer Network-defined 
family history criteria for multigene testing. The two strategies were the usual 
test strategy for variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and the seven-gene test strategy 
for variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN, CDH1, STK11, and PALB2. Women found to 
have a pathogenic variant were assumed to undergo either prophylactic surgery or 
enhanced surveillance.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the seven-gene test 
strategy compared with the BRCA1/2 test strategy was $42,067 per life-year 
gained or $69,920 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for the 50-year-old 
cohort and $23,734 per life-year gained or $48,328 per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained for the 40-year-old cohort. In probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, the seven-gene test strategy cost less than $100,000 per life-year 
gained in 95.7% of the trials for the 50-year-old cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Testing seven breast cancer-associated genes, followed by 
risk-reduction management, could cost-effectively improve life expectancy for 
women at risk of hereditary breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a two-step clinical rule using 
symptoms, signs and dipstick testing to guide the diagnosis and antibiotic 
treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) in acutely unwell young children 
presenting to primary care.
METHODS: Decision analytic model synthesising data from a multicentre, 
prospective cohort study (DUTY) and the wider literature to estimate the 
short-term and lifetime costs and healthcare outcomes (symptomatic days, 
recurrent UTI, quality adjusted life years) of eight diagnostic strategies. We 
compared GP clinical judgement with three strategies based on a 'coefficient 
score' combining seven symptoms and signs independently associated with UTI and 
four strategies based on weighted scores according to the presence/absence of 
five symptoms and signs. We compared dipstick testing versus laboratory culture 
in children at intermediate risk of UTI.
RESULTS: Sampling, culture and antibiotic costs were lowest in high-specificity 
DUTY strategies (£1.22 and £1.08) compared to clinical judgement (£1.99). These 
strategies also approximately halved urine sampling (4.8% versus 9.1% in 
clinical judgement) without reducing sensitivity (58.2% versus 56.4%). Outcomes 
were very similar across all diagnostic strategies. High-specificity DUTY 
strategies were more cost-effective than clinical judgement in the short- (iNMB 
= £0.78 and £0.84) and long-term (iNMB =£2.31 and £2.50). Dipstick tests had 
poorer cost-effectiveness than laboratory culture in children at intermediate 
risk of UTI (iNMB = £-1.41).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to GPs' clinical judgement, high specificity clinical 
rules from the DUTY study could substantially reduce urine sampling, achieving 
lower costs and equivalent patient outcomes. Dipstick testing children for UTI 
is not cost-effective.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of germline BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 (collectively termed "BRCA") testing in women with epithelial ovarian 
cancer, and testing for the relevant mutation in first- and second-degree 
relatives of BRCA mutation-positive individuals, compared with no testing. 
Female BRCA mutation-positive relatives of patients with ovarian cancer could 
undergo risk-reducing mastectomy and/or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed that included the risks of 
breast and ovarian cancer; the costs, utilities, and effects of risk-reducing 
surgery on cancer rates; and the costs, utilities, and mortality rates 
associated with cancer.
RESULTS: BRCA testing of all women with epithelial ovarian cancer each year is 
cost-effective at a UK willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000/quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) compared with no testing, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of £4,339/QALY. The result was primarily driven by 
fewer cases of breast cancer (142) and ovarian cancer (141) and associated 
reductions in mortality (77 fewer deaths) in relatives over the subsequent 50 
years. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust to variations in 
the input parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the 
probability of germline BRCA mutation testing being cost-effective at a 
threshold of £20,000/QALY was 99.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementing germline BRCA testing in all patients with ovarian 
cancer would be cost-effective in the United Kingdom. The consequent reduction 
in future cases of breast and ovarian cancer in relatives of mutation-positive 
individuals would ease the burden of cancer treatments in subsequent years and 
result in significantly better outcomes and reduced mortality rates for these 
individuals.

BACKGROUND: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis in remission, a disease 
activity-driven tapering of adalimumab or etanercept relying on progressive 
injection spacing has not been shown to be equivalent to a maintenance strategy 
at full dose in terms of disease activity in the Spacing of TNF-blocker 
injections in Rheumatoid ArthritiS Study (STRASS) trial.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of such a spacing strategy based 
on the data of the STRASS trial.
METHODS: This is a cost-utility analysis of the STRASS trial, a French 
multicenter 18-month equivalence randomized open-label controlled trial that 
included patients at stable dose for at least 1 year, in remission for at least 
6 months. Effectiveness was assessed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). 
Costs involved in the study period were assessed from a payer perspective. The 
decremental cost-effectiveness ratio (DCER) was calculated in the complete cases 
sample (n = 98). Several sensitivity analyses were conducted and the impact of 
missing data on DCER estimate was investigated. An acceptability analysis was 
performed.
RESULTS: In the spacing arm, TNF-blockers were stopped for 34.1% of the 
patients, tapered for 43.2%, and maintained at full dose for 18.2%. The spacing 
strategy was associated with less QALYs gain (mean difference of -0.158; 95% 
confidence interval [CI] -0.085 to -0.232) and reduced costs (mean difference of 
-€8,440; 95% CI -6,507 to -10,212). The estimated DCER of the spacing strategy 
over the maintenance at full dose was €53,417 saved per QALY lost (95% CI 32,230 
to 104,700).
CONCLUSIONS: The spacing strategy appears cost-effective, but the acceptability 
of such a QALY loss reported to the cost avoided remains to be evaluated, 
because no consensual threshold has been determined for willingness to accept as 
compared with willingness to pay.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of gemcitabine (G), G + 
5-fluorouracil, G + capecitabine, G + cisplatin, G + oxaliplatin, G + erlotinib, 
G + nab-paclitaxel (GnP), and FOLFIRINOX in the treatment of advanced pancreatic 
cancer from a Canadian public health payer's perspective, using data from a 
recently published Bayesian network meta-analysis.
METHODS: Analysis was conducted through a three-state Markov model and used data 
on the progression of disease with treatment from the gemcitabine arms of 
randomized controlled trials combined with estimates from the network 
meta-analysis for the newer regimens. Estimates of health care costs were 
obtained from local providers, and utilities were derived from the literature. 
The model estimates the effect of treatment regimens on costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) discounted at 5% per annum.
RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of greater than $30,666 per 
QALY, FOLFIRINOX would be the most optimal regimen. For a WTP threshold of 
$50,000 per QALY, the probability that FOLFIRINOX would be optimal was 57.8%. 
There was no price reduction for nab-paclitaxel when GnP was optimal.
CONCLUSIONS: From a Canadian public health payer's perspective at the present 
time and drug prices, FOLFIRINOX is the optimal regimen on the basis of the 
cost-effectiveness criterion. GnP is not cost-effective regardless of the WTP 
threshold.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of an educational intervention 
encouraging self-skin examinations for early detection of skin cancers among men 
older than 50 years.
METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was constructed to combine data from the Skin 
Awareness Trial and other published sources. The model incorporated a health 
system perspective and the cost and health outcomes for melanoma, squamous and 
basal cell carcinomas, and benign skin lesions. Key model outcomes included 
Australian costs (2015), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years, and 
counts of skin cancers. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
undertaken to address parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: The mean cost of the intervention was A$5,298 compared with A$4,684 for 
usual care, whereas mean QALYs were 7.58 for the intervention group and 7.77 for 
the usual care group. The intervention was thus inferior to usual care. When 
only survival gain is considered, the model predicted the intervention would 
cost A$1,059 per life-year saved. The likelihood that the intervention was 
cost-effective up to A$50,000 per QALY gained was 43.9%. The model was stable to 
most data estimates; nevertheless, it relies on the specificity of clinical 
diagnosis of skin cancers and is subject to limited health utility data for 
people with skin lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the intervention improved skin checking behaviors and 
encouraged men to seek medical advice about suspicious lesions, the overall 
costs and effects from also detecting more squamous and basal cell carcinomas 
and benign lesions outweighed the positive health gains from detecting more thin 
melanomas.

BACKGROUND: There is debate about the psychometric characteristics of the 
three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) for use in 
epilepsy. In response to the concerns, an epilepsy-specific preference-based 
measure (NEWQOL-6D) was developed. The psychometric characteristics of the 
NEWQOL-6D, however, have not been assessed.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the validity and responsiveness of the EQ-5D-3L and 
the Quality of Life in Newly Diagnosed Epilepsy Instrument-six dimensions 
(NEWQOL-6D) for use in the assessment of treatments for newly diagnosed focal 
epilepsy.
METHODS: The analysis used data from the Standard And New Antiepileptic Drugs 
trial including patients with focal epilepsy. We assessed convergent validity 
using correlations, and known-group validity across different epilepsy and 
general health severity indicators using analysis of variance and effect sizes. 
The responsiveness of the measures to change over time was assessed using 
standardized response means. We also assessed agreement between the measures.
RESULTS: There was some level of convergence and agreement between the measures 
in terms of utility score but divergence in the concepts measured by the 
descriptive systems. Both instruments displayed known-group validity, with 
significant differences between severity groups, and generally slightly larger 
effect sizes for the NEWQOL-6D across the epilepsy-specific indicators. Evidence 
for responsiveness was less clear, with small to moderate standardized response 
means demonstrating different levels of change across different indicators.
CONCLUSIONS: There was an overall tendency for the NEWQOL-6D to better reflect 
differences across groups, but this does not translate into large absolute 
utility differences. Both the EQ-5D-3L and the NEWQOL-6D show some evidence of 
validity for providing utility values for economic evaluations in newly 
diagnosed focal epilepsy.

BACKGROUND: Economic evaluations often measure an intervention effect with mean 
overall survival (OS). Emerging types of cancer treatments offer the possibility 
of being "cured" in that patients can become long-term survivors whose risk of 
death is the same as that of a disease-free person. Describing cured and 
noncured patients with one shared mean value may provide a biased assessment of 
a therapy with a cured proportion.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to explain how to incorporate the 
heterogeneity from cured patients into health economic evaluation.
METHODS: We analyzed clinical trial data from patients with advanced melanoma 
treated with ipilimumab (Ipi; n = 137) versus glycoprotein 100 (gp100; n = 136) 
with statistical methodology for mixture cure models. Both cured and noncured 
patients were subject to background mortality not related to cancer.
RESULTS: When ignoring cured proportions, we found that patients treated with 
Ipi had an estimated mean OS that was 8 months longer than that of patients 
treated with gp100. Cure model analysis showed that the cured proportion drove 
this difference, with 21% cured on Ipi versus 6% cured on gp100. The mean OS 
among the noncured cohort patients was 10 and 9 months with Ipi and gp100, 
respectively. The mean OS among cured patients was 26 years on both arms. When 
ignoring cured proportions, we found that the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) when comparing Ipi with gp100 was $324,000/quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) (95% confidence interval $254,000-$600,000). With a mixture 
cure model, the ICER when comparing Ipi with gp100 was $113,000/QALY (95% 
confidence interval $101,000-$154,000).
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis supports using cure modeling in health economic 
evaluation in advanced melanoma. When a proportion of patients may be long-term 
survivors, using cure models may reduce bias in OS estimates and provide more 
accurate estimates of health economic measures, including QALYs and ICERs.

BACKGROUND: Exposure to ambient air pollution increases morbidity and mortality, 
and is a leading contributor to global disease burden. We explored spatial and 
temporal trends in mortality and burden of disease attributable to ambient air 
pollution from 1990 to 2015 at global, regional, and country levels.
METHODS: We estimated global population-weighted mean concentrations of particle 
mass with aerodynamic diameter less than 2·5 μm (PM2·5) and ozone at an 
approximate 11 km × 11 km resolution with satellite-based estimates, chemical 
transport models, and ground-level measurements. Using integrated 
exposure-response functions for each cause of death, we estimated the relative 
risk of mortality from ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and lower respiratory infections 
from epidemiological studies using non-linear exposure-response functions 
spanning the global range of exposure.
FINDINGS: Ambient PM2·5 was the fifth-ranking mortality risk factor in 2015. 
Exposure to PM2·5 caused 4·2 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·7 million 
to 4·8 million) deaths and 103·1 million (90·8 million 115·1 million) 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2015, representing 7·6% of total 
global deaths and 4·2% of global DALYs, 59% of these in east and south Asia. 
Deaths attributable to ambient PM2·5 increased from 3·5 million (95% UI 3·0 
million to 4·0 million) in 1990 to 4·2 million (3·7 million to 4·8 million) in 
2015. Exposure to ozone caused an additional 254 000 (95% UI 97 000-422 000) 
deaths and a loss of 4·1 million (1·6 million to 6·8 million) DALYs from chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease in 2015.
INTERPRETATION: Ambient air pollution contributed substantially to the global 
burden of disease in 2015, which increased over the past 25 years, due to 
population ageing, changes in non-communicable disease rates, and increasing air 
pollution in low-income and middle-income countries. Modest reductions in burden 
will occur in the most polluted countries unless PM2·5 values are decreased 
substantially, but there is potential for substantial health benefits from 
exposure reduction.

BACKGROUND: Morbidity before retirement has a huge cost, burdening both public 
health and workplace finances. Multiple factors increase morbidity such as 
stress at work, sedentary behavior or low physical activity, and poor nutrition 
practices. Nowadays, the digital world offers infinite opportunities to interact 
with workers. The WittyFit software was designed to understand holistic issues 
of workers by promoting individualized behavior changes at the workplace.
OBJECTIVE: The shorter term feasibility objective is to demonstrate that 
effective use of WittyFit will increase well-being and improve health-related 
behaviors. The mid-term objective is to demonstrate that WittyFit improves 
economic data of the companies such as productivity and benefits. The ultimate 
objective is to increase life expectancy of workers.
METHODS: This is an exploratory interventional cohort study in an ecological 
situation. Three groups of participants will be purposefully sampled: employees, 
middle managers, and executive managers. Four levels of engagement are planned 
for employees: commencing with baseline health profiling from validated 
questionnaires; individualized feedback based on evidence-based medicine; 
support for behavioral change; and formal evaluation of changes in knowledge, 
practices, and health outcomes over time. Middle managers will also receive 
anonymous feedback on problems encountered by employees, and executive top 
managers will have indicators by division, location, department, age, seniority, 
gender and occupational position. Managers will be able to introduce specific 
initiatives in the workplace. WittyFit is based on two databases: behavioral 
data (WittyFit) and medical data (WittyFit Research). Statistical analyses will 
incorporate morbidity and well-being data. When a worker leaves a workplace, the 
company documents one of three major explanations: retirement, relocation to 
another company, or premature death. Therefore, WittyFit will have the ability 
to include mortality as an outcome. WittyFit will evolve with the waves of 
connected objects further increasing its data accuracy. Ethical approval was 
obtained from the ethics committee of the University Hospital of 
Clermont-Ferrand, France.
RESULTS: WittyFit recruitment and enrollment started in January 2016. First 
publications are expected to be available at the beginning of 2017.
CONCLUSIONS: The name WittyFit came from Witty and Fitness. The concept of 
WittyFit reflects the concept of health from the World Health Organization: 
being spiritually and physically healthy. WittyFit is a health-monitoring, 
health-promoting tool that may improve the health of workers and health of 
companies. WittyFit will evolve with the waves of connected objects further 
increasing its data accuracy with objective measures. WittyFit may constitute a 
powerful epidemiological database. Finally, the WittyFit concept may extend 
healthy living into the general population.

The relation of alcohol consumption with disease burden remains debated partly 
due to opposite associations with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. The 
relation of alcohol consumption with disease burden expressed in 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) summarizes opposing associations of 
alcohol consumption on chronic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the 
association of alcohol consumption with chronic disease burden expressed in 
DALYs based on individual-participant data. The study was a prospective study 
among 33,066 men and women from the EPIC-NL cohort. At baseline, alcohol 
consumption was assessed with a validated food-frequency questionnaire. 
Participants were followed for occurrence of and mortality from chronic diseases 
and DALYs were calculated. After 12.4 years follow-up, 6647 disease incidences 
and 1482 deaths were documented, resulting in 68,225 healthy years of life lost 
(6225 DALYs). Moderate drinkers (women 5-14.9 g/day, men 5-29.9 g/day) had a 
lower chronic disease burden (mean DALYs -0.27; 95% CI -0.43; -0.11) than light 
drinkers (0-4.9 g/day), driven by a lower disease burden due to CVD (-0.18: 
-0.29; -0.06) but not cancer (-0.05: -0.16; 0.06). The associations were most 
pronounced among older participants (≥50 years; -0.32; -0.53; -0.10) and not 
observed among younger women (-0.08; -0.43; 0.35), albeit non-significant 
(pinteraction > 0.14). Substantial drinking (women 15-29.9 g/day, men 
30-59.9 g/day) compared to light drinking was not associated with chronic 
disease burden. Our results show that moderate compared to light alcohol 
consumption was associated with living approximately 3 months longer in good 
health. These results were mainly observed among older participants and not seen 
among younger women.

PURPOSE: Axial fractures in patients with a previous C2-pelvis posterior 
instrumented fusion are rare and may be challenging to manage. Motion 
preservation in the axial spine for these patients is important, as the C1-2 and 
Occipit-C1 joints are their only remaining mobile spinal segments. In this 
unique report, we present for the first time the use of a fusionless 
occipitocervical operation for the treatment of a type II odontoid fracture and 
unilateral C2 pars fracture adjacent to a previous C2-pelvis posterior 
instrumented fusion.
METHODS: Case report.
RESULTS: Three years after proximal extension of a T3-pelvis posterior 
instrumented fusion to C2, the patient sustained a displaced odontoid fracture 
and unilateral C2 pars fracture after a mechanical fall. She underwent fracture 
stabilization with extension of instrumentation to the occiput. No attempt at 
fusion was performed. Post-operatively, she was distraught by severely limited 
neck range of motion, which was reflected in worsening of health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL) scores. The fracture healed uneventfully after which the 
instrumentation from the occiput and C1 were removed, which resulted in 
improvement of neck range of motion. Two years post-operatively, HRQoL scores 
showed minimal neck disability (NDI 12), no neck or arm pain (VAS 0), and 
outstanding general health (EQ-5D 85 out of 100, SF-36 PCS 35.3, SF-36 MCS 
41.1).
CONCLUSION: In this one patient, instrumentation without fusion allowed for 
successful and timely union of a displaced odontoid fracture in a patient with a 
previous C2-pelvis fusion. Axial range of motion was preserved after 
instrumentation removal.

Cryptochromes (CRYs) belong to the photolyase/cryptochrome flavoprotein family, 
which is widely distributed in all kingdoms. A phylogenetic analysis indicated 
that three Cordyceps militaris proteins [i.e., cryptochrome DASH (CmCRY-DASH), 
(6-4) photolyase, and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) class I photolyase] 
belong to separate fungal photolyase/cryptochrome subfamilies. CmCRY-DASH 
consists of DNA photolyase and flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding domains, with 
RGG repeats in a C-terminal extension. Considerably, more carotenoids and 
cordycepin accumulated in the ΔCmcry-DASH strain than in the wild-type or 
ΔCmwc-1 strains, indicating an inhibitory role for CmCRY-DASH in these 
biosynthetic pathways. Fruiting body primordia could form in the ΔCmcry-DASH 
strain, but the fruiting bodies were unable to elongate normally, differently 
from the Cmwc-1 disruption strain, where primordium differentiation did not 
occur. Cmcry-DASH expression is induced by light in the wild-type strain, but 
not in the ΔCmwc-1 strain. CmCRY-DASH is also necessary for the expression of 
Cmwc-1, implying that Cmcry-DASH and Cmwc-1 exhibit interdependent expression. 
The Cmvvd expression levels in the wild-type and ΔCmcry-DASH strains increased 
considerably following irradiation, while Cmvvd expression in the ΔCmwc-1 strain 
was not induced by light. It is speculated that the photo adaptation may be 
faster in the Cmcry-DASH mutant based on Cmvvd transcript dynamics. These 
results provide new insights into the biological functions of fungal DASH CRYs. 
Furthermore, the DASH CRYs may regulate fruiting body development and secondary 
metabolism differently than WC-1.

BACKGROUND: Planned neck dissection (ND) after radical chemoradiotherapy (CRT) 
for locally advanced nodal metastases in patients with head and neck squamous 
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains controversial. Thirty per cent of ND specimens 
show histological evidence of tumour. Consequently, a significant proportion of 
clinicians still practise planned ND. Fludeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography (PET)-computerised tomography (CT) scanning demonstrated high 
negative predictive values for persistent nodal disease, providing a possible 
alternative paradigm to ND. Evidence is sparse and drawn mainly from 
retrospective single-institution studies, illustrating the need for a 
prospective randomised controlled trial.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of PET-CT-guided 
surveillance, compared with planned ND, in a multicentre, prospective, 
randomised setting.
DESIGN: A pragmatic randomised non-inferiority trial comparing PET-CT-guided 
watch-and-wait policy with the current planned ND policy in HNSCC patients with 
locally advanced nodal metastases and treated with radical CRT. Patients were 
randomised in a 1 : 1 ratio. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and 
cost-effectiveness [incremental cost per incremental quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY)]. Cost-effectiveness was assessed over the trial period using individual 
patient data, and over a lifetime horizon using a decision-analytic model. 
Secondary outcomes were recurrence in the neck, complication rates and quality 
of life. The recruitment of 560 patients was planned to detect non-inferior OS 
in the intervention arm with a 90% power and a type I error of 5%, with 
non-inferiority defined as having a hazard ratio (HR) of no higher than 1.50. An 
intention-to-treat analysis was performed by Cox's proportional hazards model.
SETTINGS: Thirty-seven head and neck cancer-treating centres (43 NHS hospitals) 
throughout the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with locally advanced nodal metastases of oropharynx, 
hypopharynx, larynx, oral or occult HNSCC receiving CRT and fit for ND were 
recruited.
INTERVENTION: Patients randomised to planned ND before or after CRT (control), 
or CRT followed by fludeoxyglucose PET-CT 10-12 weeks post CRT with ND only if 
PET-CT showed incomplete or equivocal response of nodal disease (intervention). 
Balanced by centre, planned ND timing, CRT schedule, disease site and the 
tumour, node, metastasis stage.
RESULTS: In total, 564 patients were recruited (ND arm, n = 282; and 
surveillance arm, n = 282; 17% N2a, 61% N2b, 18% N2c and 3% N3). Eighty-four per 
cent had oropharyngeal cancer. Seventy-five per cent of tested cases were p16 
positive. The median time to follow-up was 36 months. The HR for OS was 0.92 
[95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.32], indicating non-inferiority. The 
upper limit of the non-inferiority HR margin of 1.50, which was informed by 
patient advisors to the project, lies at the 99.6 percentile of this estimate 
(p = 0.004). There were no differences in this result by p16 status. There were 
54 NDs performed in the surveillance arm, with 22 surgical complications, and 
221 NDs in the ND arm, with 85 complications. Quality-of-life scores were 
slightly better in the surveillance arm. Compared with planned ND, PET-CT 
surveillance produced an incremental net health benefit of 0.16 QALYs (95% CI 
0.03 to 0.28 QALYs) over the trial period and 0.21 QALYs (95% CI -0.41 to 0.85 
QALYs) over the modelled lifetime horizon.
LIMITATIONS: Pragmatic randomised controlled trial with a 36-month median 
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: PET-CT-guided active surveillance showed similar survival outcomes 
to ND but resulted in considerably fewer NDs, fewer complications and lower 
costs, supporting its use in routine practice.
FUTURE WORK: PET-CT surveillance is cost-effective in the short term, and 
long-term cost-effectiveness could be addressed in future work.
