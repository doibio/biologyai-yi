AbstractUniversal access to safe drinking water is a global priority. To 
estimate the annual disease burden of campylobacteriosis, nontyphoidal 
salmonellosis, cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, and norovirus attributable to 
waterborne transmission in Australia, we multiplied regional World Health 
Organization (WHO) estimates of the proportion of cases attributable to 
waterborne transmission by estimates of all-source disease burden for each study 
pathogen. Norovirus was attributed as causing the most waterborne disease cases 
(479,632; 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 0-1,111,874) followed by giardiasis and 
campylobacteriosis. The estimated waterborne disability-adjusted life year 
(DALY) burden for campylobacteriosis (2,004; 95% UI: 0-5,831) was 7-fold greater 
than other study pathogens and exceeded the WHO guidelines for drinking water 
quality (1 × 10-6 DALY per person per year) by 90-fold. However, these estimates 
include disease transmitted via either drinking or recreational water exposure. 
More precise country-specific and drinking water-specific attribution estimates 
would better define the health burden from drinking water and inform changes to 
treatment requirements.

BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an orphan disease that 
primarily affects the elderly. The majority of symptomatic patients eligible for 
frontline treatment are unfit for fludarabine based chemoimmunotherapy. 
Historical treatment includes chlorambucil (Chl), bendamustine/rituximab (BR), 
and chlorambucil/rituximab/ChlR combination. Clinical guidelines now recommend 
the use of novel agents, such as ibrutinib (Ibr), in both frontline and relapse 
settings and other novel agents, such as idelalisib (with rituximab), in relapse 
settings. Despite compelling clinical results for novel agents, follow-up in 
clinical trials is relatively short and, thus, the comparative long-term 
benefits are still unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors developed a simulation model to generate 
treatment specific lifetime estimates of Overall Survival (OS) and Quality 
Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for treatment with BR, Chl, ChlR, and Ibr. Two 
potential clinical scenarios were modelled: with and without novel agents for 
treating CLL. The model was based on health states relating to first- and 
second-line progression-free survival (PFS), post-progression survival, and 
death.
RESULTS: Where novel agents were assumed unavailable, mean OS ranged from 
5.4-8.5 years and QALYs from 3.5-6.1. Where novel agents were available, the 
mean OS increased to 10.0 years, with a corresponding increase in QALYs to 7.6. 
Frontline Ibr use followed by Physician's Choice, including novel agents at 
relapse, resulted in projected increase in OS of between 18% (1.5 years) and 85% 
(4.6 years), corresponding to a 25-117% increase in QALYs, compared with 
currently available traditional therapies.
LIMITATIONS: The limitations of this analysis include immature OS data and the 
assumption of equivalent efficacy across all novel agents in terms of their 
impact on PFS and OS.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of novel agents is predicted to yield substantive gains in 
predicted lifetime OS and QALY improvements compared to traditional therapies in 
CLL patients who are ineligible for fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: China has a high prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and a 
consequently high burden of disease with respect to cervical cancer. The HPV 
vaccine has proved to be effective in preventing cervical cancer and is now a 
part of routine immunization programs worldwide. It has also proved to be cost 
effective. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 2-, 4-, and 
9-valent HPV vaccines (hereafter, HPV2, 4 or 9) combined with current screening 
strategies in China.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed for a cohort of 100,000 HPV-free girls to 
simulate the natural history to HPV infection. Three recommended screening 
methods (1. liquid-based cytology test + HPV DNA test; 2. pap smear cytology 
test + HPV DNA test; 3. visual inspection with acetic acid) and three types of 
HPV vaccination program (HPV2/4/9) were incorporated into 15 intervention 
options, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to 
determine the dominant strategies. Costs, transition probabilities and utilities 
were obtained from a review of the literature and national databases. One-way 
sensitivity analyses and threshold analyses were performed for key variables in 
different vaccination scenarios.
RESULTS: HPV9 combined with screening showed the highest health impact in terms 
of reducing HPV-related diseases and increasing the number of quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs). Under the current thresholds of willingness to pay (WTP, 3 
times the per capita GDP or USD$ 23,880), HPV4/9 proved highly cost effective, 
while HPV2 combined with screening cost more and was less cost effective. Only 
when screening coverage increased to 60% ~ 70% did the HPV2 and screening 
combination strategy become economically feasible.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of the HPV4/9 vaccine with current screening 
strategies for adolescent girls was highly cost-effective and had a significant 
impact on reducing the HPV infection-related disease burden in Mainland China.

INTRODUCTION: Despite clinical guidelines recommendations, many relatives of 
people with psychosis or bipolar disorder do not currently receive the support 
they need. Online information and support may offer a solution.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This single-blind, parallel, online randomised controlled 
trial will determine clinical and cost-effectiveness of the Relatives Education 
And Coping Toolkit (REACT) (including an online resource directory (RD)), 
compared with RD only, for relatives of people with psychosis or bipolar 
disorder. Both groups continue to receive treatment as usual. Independent, 
web-based variable, block, individual randomisation will be used across 666 
relatives. Primary outcome is distress at 24 weeks (measured by General Health 
Questionnaire; GHQ-28) compared between groups using analysis of covariance, 
adjusting for baseline score. Secondary clinical outcomes are carer well-being 
and support. Cost-effectiveness analysis will determine cost of a significant 
unit change (three-point reduction) in the GHQ-28. Costs include offering and 
supporting the intervention in the REACT arm, relevant healthcare care costs 
including health professional contacts, medications prescribed and time off (or 
ability to) work for the relative. Cost utility analysis will be calculated as 
the marginal cost of changes in quality-adjusted life years, based on EuroQol. 
We will explore relatives' beliefs, perceived coping and amount of REACT toolkit 
use as possible outcome mediators. We have embedded two methodological 
substudies in the protocol to determine the relative effectiveness of a 
low-value (£10) versus higher value (£20) incentive, and an unconditional versus 
conditional incentive, on improving follow-up rates.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has ethical approval from Lancaster National 
Research Ethics Service (NRES)Committee (15/NW/0732) and is overseen by an 
independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee and Trial Steering Committee. 
Protocol version 1.5 was approved on 9 January 2017. All updates to protocols

INTRODUCTION: Savings garnered through the provision of preventive services is a 
form of profit for health systems. Free clinics have been using this logic to 
demonstrate their cost-savings. The Community-Based Chronic Disease Management 
(CCDM) clinic treats hypertension using nurse-led teams, clinical protocols, and 
community-based settings.
METHODS: We calculated CCDM's cost-effectiveness from 2007 to 2013 using 2 
metrics: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved and return on investment 
(ROI). QALYs were calculated using the Clinical Preventive Burden (CPB) score 
for hypertension care. ROI was calculated by tallying the savings from prevented 
heart attacks, strokes, and emergency department visits against the total 
operating costs.
RESULTS: Using conservative assumptions for cost estimates, hypertension care 
resulted in a value of QALYs saved of $711,000 to $2,133,000 and an ROI ratio 
range of 0.35 to 1.20. Our study shows that when using conservative assumptions 
to calculate cost-savings, our free clinic did not save money. Cost-savings did 
occur, but the amount was modest, was less than that of cost-inputs, and was not 
likely captured by any single health entity.
CONCLUSION: Although free clinics remain a vital health care access point for 
many Americans, it has yet to be demonstrated that they generate a net savings.

The prevalence of both type 2 diabetes and prediabetes increases with advancing 
age. The most important factors leading to hyperglycaemia are as follows: 
deficiency of insulin secretion developing with age, and growing insulin 
resistance caused by a change in body composition and sarcopaenia. Clinical 
features of diabetes in the elderly could be different. Diabetes in elderly 
people is often diagnosed with delay due to atypical symptoms (dementia, urinary 
incontinence) and occurrence of mainly postprandial hyperglycaemia. Elderly 
people are more exposed to diabetes complications, have more risk of myocardial 
infarction and end-stage renal disease, and are hospitalised more often due to 
hypoglycaemia than are younger patients. Elderly people with diabetes are a 
heterogeneous group with different life expectancy, concomitant of chronic 
diseases, and the ability to self-control blood glucose or give themselves an 
injection. The therapy should be individualised. Older people with long-term 
diabetes and numerous chronic complications need a more liberal approach to 
reach specific goals of therapy. Additional goals should be avoiding 
hypoglycaemia, safety of the therapy, and its acceptance by the patient.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a disorder characterized by repetitive collapse 
of the upper respiratory tract during sleep, occurs in about 4% of middle-aged 
men and 2% of women. The incidence of the disorder is rising due to an increase 
in obesity and ageing of the population. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea 
are at elevated risk of some endocrinal and metabolic disorders, which may lead 
to serious consequences including shortening of life expectancy. The recognition 
and understanding of interactions between local upper airway dysfunction and its 
endocrinal consequences is therefore vital. In this review we will focus on the 
influence of OSA on bone metabolism and endocrine homeostasis.

Internet tools have become a great aid in the daily practice of physicians who 
treat breast cancer patients. In cancer care there are frequent and important 
intersections where major decisions need to be made; these include (1) whether 
or not to give chemotherapy; (2) how much toxicity to expect, and (3) the life 
expectancy of the patient, considering non-breast cancer comorbidities. These 
decisions can be made more accurately using calculators based on data sets of 
thousands of patients as opposed to physician intuition. Such tools also help 
patients and caregivers in optimal decision making, as they estimate the 
absolute benefits and risks of treatment. In this perspective we describe 
selected internet sites that are useful across several domains of care, 
including the potential benefits of different adjuvant regimens for early breast 
cancer, prognosis after neoadjuvant therapy, prognosis for ductal carcinoma in 
situ, and toxicity and life expectancy estimates. We review the variables 
required to use the tools, the results obtained, the methods of validation, and 
the advantages and disadvantages of each tool.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the influence of nutrition and of the 
severity of mutation type on survival rate in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. 
Data were longitudinally collected from 60 hospitalized adult CF patients, aged 
18-50. The variables consisted of body mass index (BMI) ratio, Cole's BMI 
cut-off points, severity of mutation type, and survival rate of CF patients. We 
found that the mean BMI was strongly associated with the severity of mutation 
type and was significantly lower in patients with severe mutations of grade I 
and II. The mutation type significantly affected the patients' survival rate; 
survival was greater in patients with mild and undefined mutation types. The BMI 
and Cole's cut-off points also had a significant influence on survival rate. CF 
patients, who suffered from malnutrition and emaciation, had a shorter survival 
rate than those with proper nutritional status. In conclusion, the study 
findings confirmed a significant effect of nutritional status and of mutation 
type on survival rate of CF patients.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune destructive 
arthropathy prevalent among people in the age group of 40-70 years. RA induces 
severe pain, swelling and stiffness of joints resulting in bone damage. RA leads 
to reduced life expectancy when left untreated. RA is characterized by synovial 
hyperplasia, infiltration of inflammatory cells resulting in formation of 
pannus. Synovial hyperplasia is mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, notably 
IL-1 and TNF-α. NF-κB is a predominant transcription factor in amplifying the 
inflammatory response. The translocation of activated NF-κB into the nucleus 
triggers the transcription of several genes that induce proinflammatory cytokine 
production. The inhibition of NF-κB translocation aids blocking the activation 
of proinflammatory cascades. The quest for more effective and side-effect free 
treatment for RA unveiled phytochemicals as efficacious and promising. 
Phytochemicals have been a source of therapeutic substances for many ailments 
from ancient times. Their therapeutic ability helps in developing potent and 
safe drugs targeting immune inflammatory diseases driven by NF-κB including RA. 
This review highlights the importance of NF-κB inflammatory cascade in RA so as 
to elucidate the crucial role of phytochemicals that inhibit the activity of 
NF-κB.

[Hidradenitis suppurativa - symptoms, diagnostics, and therapy].

[Article in Czech]

Arenbergerová M, Dahmen RA, Arenberger P.

Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic skin disorder characterized by recurrent 
inflammatory nodules, fistulas, abscesses, and scarring mainly in the 
intertriginous areas with terminal hair and apocrine glands. Hidradenitis 
suppurativa manifests usually after puberty, in the third life decade and 
persists for many years. The prevalence of the disease is estimated to be 0,5 % 
in the Czech Republic. Women are most often affected in the axillary and 
inguinal parts, while men in the perianal and gluteal areas. The exact 
pathogenesis is still unknown. It is assumed that hyperkeratosis of the hair 
follicle leads to its occlusion, dilatation and further rupture when keratin and 
bacteria are spilled into the dermis causing a massive inflammatory reaction. 
Smoking and obesity belong to the main triggering factors. Without therapy, the 
disease is chronic and progressive. The standard therapy depends on the 
extension of the disorder. For not extensive lesions, treatment consists of 
topical antiseptics, antibiotics or long- term therapy with systemic 
antibiotics. In more advanced stages, systemic therapy with TNF-α antagonists is 
needed. Further therapeutic modality is surgical intervention and wide excision 
of the affected area. Nevertheless, recurrences in the adjacent tissue cannot be 
avoided.

BACKGROUND: Determining whether men diagnosed with early prostate cancer (PCa) 
will live long enough to benefit from interventions with curative intent is 
difficult. Although validated instruments for predicting patient survival are 
available, these do not have clinical utility so are not used routinely in 
practice.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that volunteers who provided ejaculate 
specimens had a high survival rate at 10 and 15 yr and beyond.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 290 patients investigated because 
of high serum prostate-specific antigen donated ejaculate specimens for research 
between January 1992 and May 2003. The median age at the time of ejaculation was 
63.5 yr. 153 of the donors were diagnosed with PCa and followed up to December 
31, 2013.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Survival outcomes were compared 
with those for the whole population, as indicated by life expectancy tables up 
to 20 yr.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Men in the PCa group had life expectancies comparable 
with values listed in life expectancy tables for the whole population. Overall, 
PCa-specific and relative survival were significantly better for men in the 
non-PCa and PCa groups in comparison with men diagnosed with PCa in Queensland 
during the same period. Relative survival for those aged 20-49, 50-64, and ≥65 
yr was >100% for ejaculate donors and 81.5%, 82.7%, and 65.2%, respectively, for 
the Queensland Cancer Registry reference at 10 yr. These findings for this 
highly selected patient cohort support the hypothesis that an ability to provide 
an ejaculate specimen is associated with a high likelihood of surviving 10-20 yr 
after donation, whether or not PCa was detected.
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy tables may serve as a quick and simple life 
expectancy indicator for biopsy patients who donate ejaculate.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Life expectancy tables indicated survival of up to 20 yr for 
men who provided ejaculate specimens for prostate cancer research.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to test the cost-effectiveness of dasatinib 
compared to high-dose imatinib and nilotinib in Chinese patients who were 
diagnosed with imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase 
(CML-CP).
METHODS: A Markov model combined with clinical effectiveness, utility, and cost 
data was used. The sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the 
robustness of the model outcomes. The impact of patient assistance programs 
(PAPs) was assessed.
RESULTS: Treatment with dasatinib is expected to produce 3.65, 0.59, and 0.15 
more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in comparison with high-dose imatinib 
(600 and 800 mg) and nilotinib, respectively. When a PAP was available, 
dasatinib yielded an incremental cost of $16,417 per QALY compared to imatinib 
(600 mg) and was cost-saving compared to imatinib (800 mg) and nilotinib.
CONCLUSION: When PAP is available in the Chinese setting, dasatinib is likely to 
be a cost-effective strategy for patients with CML-CP standard-dose imatinib 
resistance. The results should be carefully explained due to the assumptions and 
limitations used in the study.

BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is known to be the single largest cause of premature 
death worldwide. The aim of present study was to analyse the effect of smoking 
on general and cause-specific mortality in the Estonian population.
METHODS: The data from 51,756 adults in the Estonian Genome Center of the 
University of Tartu was used. Information on dates and causes of death was 
retrieved from the National Causes of Death Registry. Smoking status, general 
survival, general mortality and cause-specific mortality were analysed using 
Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: The study found that smoking reduces median survival in men by 
11.4 years and in women by 5.8 years. Tobacco smoking produces a very specific 
pattern in the cause of deaths, significantly increasing the risks for different 
cancers and cardiovascular diseases as causes of death for men and women. This 
study also identified that external causes, such as alcohol intoxication and 
intentional self-harm, are more prevalent causes of death among smokers than 
non-smokers. Additionally, smoking cessation was found to reverse the increased 
risks for premature mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco smoking remains the major cause for losses of life inducing 
cancers and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the common diseases, 
external causes also reduce substantially the years of life. External causes of 
death indicate that smoking has a long-term influence on the behaviour of 
smokers, provoking self-destructive behaviour. Our study supports the idea, that 
tobacco smoking generates complex harm to our health increasing mortality from 
both somatic and mental disorders.

The Population Health Benefits Of A Healthy Lifestyle: Life Expectancy Increased 
And Onset Of Disability Delayed.

A key determinant of population health is the behavioral profile of a 
population. Nearly 80 percent of Americans reach their fifties having smoked 
cigarettes, been obese, or both. It is unknown to what extent risky behaviors 
(for example, smoking, having a poor diet, being physically inactive, and 
consuming an excessive amount of alcohol) collectively are reducing the health 
and life expectancy of the US population, or what improvements might be 
achievable in their absence. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, we 
studied people ages fifty and older who had never smoked, who were not obese, 
and who consumed alcohol moderately. Compared to the whole US population, those 
with such a favorable behavioral profile had a life expectancy at age fifty that 
was seven years longer, and they experienced a delay in the onset of disability 
of up to six years. These results provide a benchmark for evaluating the 
massively damaging effects that behavioral risks have on health at older ages 
and the importance of prioritizing policies to implement behavioral-based 
interventions.

Editorial: Stopping Pancreatic Cyst Surveillance?

The management of patients with pancreatic cysts, especially presumed branch 
duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs), remains a challenge. 
BD-IPMNs carry a very low risk of malignancy and occur in predominantly older 
individuals who often die from causes not related to their pancreatic disease. 
The specific decision to stop surveillance of presumed low risk BD-IPMNs (those 
without either worrisome features (WF) or high risk stigmata (HRS)) is 
controversial, and needs to balance the real risk of malignancy or developing 
malignancy and IPMN-related mortality, with the patient's life expectancy, 
quality of life expectations, and mortality from non-pancreatic-related causes. 
With improved life expectancy, improved survival from non-pancreatic 
malignancies, rising health costs, and growing detection of ever smaller 
presumed BD-IPMNs, this issue is becoming ever more critical.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the potential cost-effectiveness of cervical 
cancer screening in HIV treatment clinics in Nairobi, Kenya.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to project health outcomes and costs of 
cervical cancer screening and cryotherapy at an HIV clinic in Kenya using 
cryotherapy without screening, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), 
Papanicolaou smear (Pap), and testing for human papillomavirus (HPV). Direct and 
indirect medical and non-medical costs were examined from societal and clinic 
perspectives.
RESULTS: Costs of cryotherapy, VIA, Pap, and HPV for women with CD4 200-500 
cells/mL were $99, $196, $219, and $223 from a societal perspective and $19, 
$94, $124, and $113 from a clinic perspective, with 17.3, 17.1, 17.1, and 
17.1 years of life expectancy, respectively. Women at higher CD4 counts (>500 
cells/mL) given cryotherapy VIA, Pap, and HPV resulted in better life 
expectancies (19.9+ years) and lower cost (societal: $49, $99, $115, and $102; 
clinic: $13, $51, $71, and $56). VIA was less expensive than HPV unless HPV 
screening could be reduced to a single visit.
CONCLUSIONS: Preventative cryotherapy was the least expensive strategy and 
resulted in highest projected life expectancy, while VIA was most cost-effective 
unless HPV could be reduced to a single visit.

Introduction  Treatment of unstable distal radial fractures (DRFs) in elderly 
patients is controversial, and considering the increasing life expectancy, their 
appropriate treatment is of growing importance. Our aim was to analyze the 
clinical and radiologic outcomes in the elderly patients with AO type C DRF 
treated with volar locking plate (VLP). Materials and Methods  Between 2007 and 
2011, 572 DRFs were operated on in our hospital with open reduction and internal 
fixation with VLP. Of these, only 64 patients (66 DRFs) met the selection 
criteria (AO type C DRF, age > 70 years, minimum 12-month follow-up). Mean 
follow-up was 28 months. Outcome assessment included range of motion, grip 
strength, VAS pain, Mayo Clinic Score, and DASH score. Analysis of pre- and 
postoperative radiographs was performed. Complications were recorded. 
Statistical analysis was performed comparing the results with the contralateral 
side. Results  Mean postoperative range of motion of the injured wrist compared 
with the control contralateral side was 86% for flexion ( p  < 0.001), 92% for 
extension ( p  < 0.001). The average DASH was 12. Mayo Clinic Wrist Score showed 
43 excellent results, 15 good, 4 satisfactory, and 4 poor. Articular step-offs 
were reduced in 34 of 38 wrists. Five (7%) patients required plate removal. 
Conclusion  The treatment of articular DRF (AO type C) with VLP in the elderly 
patients achieved greater than 90% of the wrist range of motion and grip 
strength with no residual pain in greater than 90% of the patients. Level of 
Evidence  Therapeutic IV, case series.

Implantable medical devices (IMDs) have become indispensable medical tools for 
improving the quality of life and prolonging the patient's lifespan. The 
minimization and extension of lifetime are main challenges for the development 
of IMDs. Current innovative research on this topic is focused on internal 
charging using the energy generated by the physiological environment or natural 
body activity. To harvest biomechanical energy efficiently, piezoelectric and 
triboelectric energy harvesters with sophisticated structural and material 
design have been developed. Energy from body movement, muscle 
contraction/relaxation, cardiac/lung motions, and blood circulation is captured 
and used for powering medical devices. Other recent progress in this field 
includes using PENGs and TENGs for our cognition of the biological processes by 
biological pressure/strain sensing, or direct intervention of them for some 
special self-powered treatments. Future opportunities lie in the fabrication of 
intelligent, flexible, stretchable, and/or fully biodegradable self-powered 
medical systems for monitoring biological signals and treatment of various 
diseases in vitro and in vivo.

Gainesville, FL, USA.

Although surgical excision is the standard of therapy for small renal masses 
(SRMs), there is a growing recognition of active surveillance as an option in 
select patients who are poor surgical candidates or who have shorter life 
expectancy. A number of patients on expectant management, however, subsequently 
advance to definitive therapy. In this study, we systematically reviewed the 
literature and performed a pooled analysis of active surveillance series to 
evaluate the rate and indications for definitive treatment after initiating a 
period of active surveillance. Fourteen clinical series (1245 patients; 1364 
lesions) met our selection criteria. Mean lesion size at presentation was 2.30 ± 
0.40 cm with a mean follow-up of 33.6 ± 16.9 months. Collectively, 34.0% of 
patients underwent delayed intervention, which ranged in individual series from 
3.6% to 70.3%. Of patients undergoing delayed intervention, the average time on 
active surveillance prior to definitive treatment was 27.8 ± 10.6 months. A 
pooled analysis revealed that 41.0% of patients underwent therapy secondary to 
tumor growth rate and 51.9% secondary to patient or physician preference in the 
absence of clinical progression. Overall, 1.1% of all patients progressed to 
metastatic disease during the average follow-up period. Thus, active 
surveillance may be an appropriate option for carefully selected patients with 
SRMs. However, delayed treatment is pursued in a significant percentage of 
patients within 3 years. Prospective registries and clinical trials with 
standardized indications for delayed intervention are needed to establish true 
rates of disease progressions and recommendations for delayed intervention.

Due to the increasing life expectancy and a higher incidence in the elderly, the 
number of elderly patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease will increase in 
the coming years. Since the burden of comorbidities is higher and medication 
side effects are more likely in the elderly, particularly in the light of 
frequently occurring polypharmacy, increased awareness and therapeutic knowledge 
is necessary. Besides the therapy of motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms, e. g. 
neuropsychiatric and autonomic disorders, also need to be addressed as they can 
also greatly impair the quality of life. In more advanced stages of the disease, 
non-pharmacological treatment, medical aids and caregiving become more 
important. A close integration in the social environment is of great importance 
for the implementation.

Mast cells (MCs) are physiologically activated by binding of stem cell factor 
(SCF) to the extracellular domains of the Kit receptor. This binding increases 
the proliferation and prolongs the survival of normal mature MCs, as well as 
intensifies the release of mediators. In mastocytosis, somatic mutations of the 
coding Kit gene cause autocrine dysregulation and lead to constitutive KIT 
activation even in the absence of its ligand SCF. Clinical symptoms are caused 
by MC-mediator release and/or infiltration of MCs into tissues. Aberrant KIT 
activation may result in increased production of MCs in the skin and 
extracutaneous organs. Depending on the affected organ(s), the disease can be 
divided into cutaneous mastocytosis (CM), systemic mastocytosis (SM), and 
localized MC tumors. The updated classification of WHO discriminates between 
several distinct subvariants of CM and SM. While the prognosis in CM and 
indolent SM (ISM) is excellent with (almost) normal life expectancy, the 
prognosis in aggressive SM (ASM) and MC leukemia (MCL) is dismal. The symptoms 
may comprise urticaria, angioedema, flush, pruritus, abdominal pain, diarrhea, 
hypotension, syncope, and musculoskeletal pain and are the results of MC 
infiltration and mediator release into target organs, i.e., the skin, 
gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. 
Mastocytosis differs from a lot of other hematological disorders because its 
pathology is not only based on the lack of normal function of a specific pathway 
or of a specific cell type but additionally is a proliferative disease. 
Currently available treatments of mastocytosis include symptomatic, antimediator 
and cytoreductive targeted therapies.
