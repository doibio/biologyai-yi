BACKGROUND: Plant non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are small and 
basic proteins. Recently, nsLTPs have been reported involved in many 
physiological functions such as mediating phospholipid transfer, participating 
in plant defence activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens, and enhancing 
cell wall extension in tobacco. However, the lipid transfer mechanism of nsLTPs 
is still unclear, and comprehensive information of nsLTPs is difficult to 
obtain.
METHODS: In this study, we identified 595 nsLTPs from 121 different species and 
constructed an nsLTPs database--nsLTPDB--which comprises the sequence 
information, structures, relevant literatures, and biological data of all plant 
nsLTPs http://nsltpdb.life.nthu.edu.tw/.
RESULTS: Meanwhile, bioinformatics and statistics methods were implemented to 
develop a classification method for nsLTPs based on the patterns of the eight 
highly-conserved cysteine residues, and to suggest strict Prosite-styled 
patterns for Type I and Type II nsLTPs. The pattern of Type I is C X2 V X5-7 C 
[V, L, I] × Y [L, A, V] X8-13 CC × G X12 D × [Q, K, R] X2 CXC X16-21 P X2 C 
X13-15C, and that of Type II is C X4 L X2 C X9-11 P [S, T] X2 CC X5 Q X2-4 C[L, 
F]C X2 [A, L, I] × [D, N] P X10-12 [K, R] X4-5 C X3-4 P X0-2 C. Moreover, we 
referred the Prosite-styled patterns to the experimental mutagenesis data that 
previously established by our group, and found that the residues with higher 
conservation played an important role in the structural stability or lipid 
binding ability of nsLTPs.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this research has suggested potential residues that 
might be essential to modulate the structural and functional properties of plant 
nsLTPs. Finally, we proposed some biologically important sites of the nsLTPs, 
which are described by using a new Prosite-styled pattern that we defined.

BACKGROUND: The threshold of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in current 
screening for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) from the heel prick test is 5 mU/l. 
This study uses cost-effective analysis to evaluate increasing the threshold to 
minimize false-positive results and recall rates.
METHODS: Cost of screening, diagnosis and treatment, education, and care of 
mentally retarded patients were gathered from the Ministry of Health State 
Welfare Organization and Department of Education in Tehran. Screening data were 
obtained from 34,007 neonates in the Central Health Laboratory of Tehran 
University of Medical Sciences in 2009. Sensitivity analysis and calculation of 
confidence interval for incremental costs and effects (gained disability 
adjusted life years - DALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) 
were performed by Monte Carlo simulation with Ersatz software.
RESULTS: ICER for screening programs with different TSH cut-off points versus no 
screening was similar, and approximately -4.5 ± 0.2 thousand US dollars per 
gained DALY. In the proposed cohort (10,000 neonates), gained DALYs were 316 ± 
50 for a cut off point of 5 mU/l, 251 ± 40 for 10 mU/l, 146 ± 23 for 15 mU/l, 
and 113 ± 18 for a cut-off point of 20 mU/l. Sensitivity analysis showed that 
the model remained the same when the input parameters were changed.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the current threshold of TSH in the 
national CH screening program in terms of cost-effectiveness is the most 
appropriate threshold. However, more studies are needed to examine new 
strategies and methods to reduce recall rates and related consequences such as 
repeated thyroid testing in neonates.

Long-term cost-consequence analysis of exenatide once weekly vs sitagliptin or 
pioglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes patients in the United States.

OBJECTIVE: Exenatide once-weekly (ExQW) is a GLP-1 receptor agonist shown to 
lower glucose and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM). The objective of this study was to estimate the clinical 
benefits and associated economic benefits of treatment with ExQW compared with 
sitagliptin or pioglitazone in the US.
METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model, a validated computer simulation model, was 
used to project lifetime clinical outcomes and complication costs. The costs of 
glucose-lowering drugs were excluded as not all prices were available. Baseline 
patient characteristics (mean values: age, 52.5 years; diabetes duration, 6 
years; HbA1(c), 8.51%; body mass index, 32.12 kg/m(2)) and clinical data were 
derived from a phase 3 clinical trial that compared ExQW with sitagliptin or 
pioglitazone in T2DM patients. At 6 months, patients treated with ExQW had 
greater improvements in HbA1(c) and body weight than those treated with 
sitagliptin or pioglitazone. Complication costs were extracted from published 
sources. Health outcomes and costs were discounted at 3% per year. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Over 35 years, and compared with sitagliptin or pioglitazone, ExQW 
increased life expectancy by, respectively, 0.28 (13.76 ± 0.17 vs 13.48 ± 0.18) 
and 0.17 years (13.76 ± 0.17 vs 13.59 ± 0.17), and quality-adjusted life years 
by, respectively, 0.28 (9.56 ± 0.12 vs 9.28 ± 0.12) and 0.24 years (9.56 ± 0.12 
vs 9.32 ± 0.12). ExQW was associated with lower lifetime complication costs: 
compared with sitagliptin or pioglitazone, ExQW saved, respectively US$2215 
(US$55,647 ± 2039 vs US$57,862 ± 2159) and US$933 (US$55,647 ± 2039 vs US$56,580 
± 2007) direct cost per patient. Cost-savings resulted mainly from a lower 
projected cumulative incidence of cardiovascular diseases and neuropathic 
complications.
LIMITATIONS: Short-term changes in surrogate end-points were used to project 
lifetime effects on clinical outcomes. Pharmacy costs were excluded from the 
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Over a patient's lifetime, ExQW was projected to improve health and 
decrease diabetes-related complication costs compared with sitagliptin or 
pioglitazone.

AIM: To evaluate the cost utility and budget impact of second-line gefitinib for 
non-small cell lung cancer from a Thai payer perspective.
METHODS:   A Markov model with three health states (pre-progression, 
post-progression and death) was constructed to estimate direct medical costs and 
outcomes comparing four treatment options, i.e., gefitinib, erlotinib, 
pemetrexed and docetaxel. The model followed patients for 2 years with discount 
rate of 3% annually. Clinical inputs and patients' characteristics were based on 
a randomized phase III trial (INTEREST). Costs were based on reference prices 
published by the Ministry of Public Health, Thailand, and other information 
related to treatment from expert opinion and presented in 2010. Deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the impact of 
model parameters on results.
RESULTS: In the base case model, gefitinib and erlotinib yielded equal 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) but 0.0140 and 0.0110 more QALY compared with 
docetaxel and pemetrexed, respectively. Total costs were 188 848 Baht (US$6237) 
for gefitinib, 196 313 Baht (US$6483) for docetaxel, 249 177 Baht (US$8229) for 
erlotinib and 275 303 Baht (US$9092) for pemetrexed. Drug acquisition 
contributed the greatest component. A series of sensitivity analyses 
demonstrated the robustness to various parameter variations except for docetaxel 
cost and duration of treatment. The budget impact analyses demonstrate the 
greater the percentage of substitution of gefitinib for docetaxel (ranging from 
10-60%) the greater the cost saving.
CONCLUSION:   Gefitinib is a dominant cost saving strategy compared with 
docetaxel for the second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC from the Thai payer 
perspective.

PURPOSE: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) increase the risk of osteoporosis and 
related fractures in postmenopausal women who receive adjuvant AIs for hormone 
receptor (HR) -positive early breast cancer (EBC). We compared the cost 
effectiveness of alternative screening and treatment strategies for fracture 
prevention.
METHODS: We developed a Markov state transition model to simulate clinical 
practice and outcomes in a hypothetical cohort of women age 60 years with 
HR-positive EBC starting a 5-year course of AI therapy after primary surgery for 
breast cancer. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime cost, 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We compared the following 
strategies: no intervention; one-time bone mineral density (BMD) screening and 
selective bisphosphonate therapy in women with osteoporosis or osteopenia; 
annual BMD screening and selective bisphosphonate therapy in women with 
osteoporosis or osteopenia; and universal bisphosphonate therapy.
RESULTS: ICERs for annual BMD screening followed by oral bisphosphonates for 
those with osteoporosis, annual BMD screening followed by oral bisphosphonates 
for those with osteopenia, and universal treatment with oral bisphosphonates 
were $87,300, $129,300, and $283,600 per QALY gained, respectively. One-time BMD 
screening followed by oral bisphosphonates for those with osteoporosis or 
osteopenia was dominated. Our results were sensitive to age at the initiation of 
AI therapy, type of bisphosphonates, post-treatment residual effect of 
bisphosphonates, and a potential adjuvant benefit of intravenous 
bisphosphonates.
CONCLUSION: In postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant AIs for HR-positive EBC, 
a policy of baseline and annual BMD screening followed by selective treatment 
with oral bisphosphonates for those diagnosed with osteoporosis is a 
cost-effective use of societal resources.

AIM: A negative impact on vitiligo patients in terms of quality of life (QoL) 
has been suggested. The aim of this report was to study the QoL in a sample of 
Italian vitiligo patients by using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 
questionnaire.
METHODS: A sample of forty seven vitiligo subjects, identified among 34,740 
potential conscripts resident in southern Italy underwent the Italian version of 
the DLQI questionnaire.
RESULTS: The median total DLQI score was 1 (IQR: 2; mean: 1.82). In univariate 
analysis, DLQI total score was significantly influenced by the clinical course 
of vitiligo, disease extension over the body, and location on face and/or hands. 
Multivariate analysis using logistic stepwise regression showed that only the 
localization on the hands and on the face influenced significantly the mean 
DLQI.
CONCLUSION: Our study conducted on a random sample of individuals affected by 
vitiligo selected from the general young male population in Italy, does not 
document a large impact of vitiligo on QoL. However, variations exist and the 
location of lesions on the face and/or hands may impact on QoL. Population-based 
studies are not affected by selection biases connected with seeking medical care 
and should be more widely performed.

INTRODUCTION: The basic method of therapy of non-small cell lung cancer is 
surgery. For a number of years a discussion has gone concerning the indications 
for postoperative radiotherapy in the case of non-radical surgical treatment. At 
present, in many centers, the postoperative radiotherapy is recommended for 
patients with confirmed metastases to mediastinal lymph nodes (pN2) and in case 
of microscopic or macroscopic features of incomplete surgical margins. The aim 
of this retrospective study was to assess the results of adjuvant radiotherapy 
after surgical treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: From December 1993 to October 2005 in the Department of 
Radiotherapy Centre of Oncology at Wawelska St. in Warsaw, 366 patients (pts) 
were radically irradiated after surgery. In 192 pts radiotherapy was performed 
due to incomplete surgical margins, in 174 pts - due to metastases to 
mediastinal lymph nodes - in 26 pts both indications coexisted. First and second 
clinical stage was found in 96 pts: (I - 9 pts: 2.4%; II - 87 pts: 24%). Stage 
IIIA was found in 252 pts (69%) and IIIB in 18 pts (5%). Performance status 
according to Zubrod scale was: 0 - in 302 pts (82.5%), 1 - in 54 pts (14.8%) and 
2 - in 10 pts (2.7%). Retrospective analysis of the treatment results was 
carried out. Survival time and time of occurrence of a local progression were 
assessed. Survival probability was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Multidimensional analysis of prognostic factors was carried out with the D.R. 
Cox proportional risk model.
RESULTS: In the studied group, one year survival was 78.02 ± 2%, two years, 
survival was 54.14 ± 2%, an five years, survival was 31.03 ± 2%. The two years, 
local control was estimated as 45.62% ± 4% and the five years, local control was 
27.37 ± 4%. Probability of survival was significantly higher in the pts with 
better performance status - median survival in the groups with Zubrod stage 0 
and 1 + 2 were 3.2 and 1.3 years respectively). Patients who received 〉 50 Gy of 
irradiation had significantly better life expectancy than others - median 
survival in the groups 〉 50 Gy and ≤ 50 Gy were 4.42 and 2.25 years 
respectively). Frequency of local recurrence was lower in the group of pts who 
received 〉 50 Gy of irradiation, than in remaining pts. Local recurrences were 
not observed in the pts treated with 3D radiotherapy regimen, but this group of 
pts received also higher dose of irradiation than others. Multiple survival 
analysis revealed that dose of irradiation ≤ 50 Gy, worse performance status and 
older age of the patient were independent adverse prognostic indicators.
CONCLUSIONS: 1. The results of postoperative radiotherapy in his retrospective 
study were strongly influenced by the dose of irradiation, patients' age and 
performance status. Total radiotherapy dose ≤ 50 Gy, older age of the patients 
and worse performance status (1 + 2) were negative survival indicators. 2. 3D 
technique of irradiation was combined with the best regional control of the 
disease.

The incidence of valvular aortic stenosis has increased over the past decades 
due to improved life expectancy. Surgical aortic valve replacement is currently 
the only treatment option for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis that has been 
shown to improve survival. However, up to one third of patients who require 
lifesaving surgical aortic valve replacement are denied surgery due to high 
comorbidities resulting in a higher operative mortality rate. In the past such 
patients could only be treated with medical therapy or percutaneous aortic 
valvuloplasty, neither of which has been shown to improve mortality. With 
advances in interventional cardiology, transcatheter methods have been developed 
for aortic valve replacement with the goal of offering a therapeutic solution 
for patients who are unfit for surgical therapy. Currently there are two 
catheter-based treatment systems in clinical application (the Edwards SAPIEN 
aortic valve and the CoreValve ReValving System), utilizing either a 
balloon-expandable or a self-expanding stent platform, respectively.

INTRODUCTION: When cervical cancer is detected at an early stage (International 
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] IA2-IB1), it can be successfully 
treated by radical surgery alone. Considering that most patients are young and 
sexually active at the moment of diagnosis and the long life expectancy of 
survivors after the treatment, quality of life (QoL) and sexual function are 
important issues for cancer survivors and caregivers. However, only a few 
studies have examined the QoL and sexual function in disease-free cervical 
cancer survivors, and there are no studies in the literature comparing 
prospectively sexual function after different types of radical hysterectomy.
AIM: To compare sexual function in two groups of early stage cervical cancer 
survivors treated by radical surgery alone, undergoing two different types of 
radical hysterectomy.
METHODS: Patients treated by radical hysterectomy with systematic 
lymphadenectomy for early stage cervical cancer (FIGO IA2-IB1) have been 
enrolled and divided in two groups with regard to type of radical hysterectomy 
performed; S1: modified radical hysterectomy (Piver II/Type B), S2: classic 
radical hysterectomy (Piver III/ Type C2).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Twenty-four months after surgery we assessed the sexual 
function using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Cervix Cancer Module Questionnaire, which is a validated system for the 
assessment of disease- and treatment-specific issues that affect the QoL and 
sexual functioning of women who are treated for cervical cancer.
RESULTS: Of the 31 patients enrolled in the S1 group and 46 in the S2 group, 23 
and 33 patients have been included, respectively. We observed significant 
differences between the two groups in terms of symptom experience, 
sexual/vaginal functioning, sexual activity, and sexual enjoyment. There was not 
any significant difference regarding lymphedema, peripheral neuropathy, and 
sexual worry.
CONCLUSION: Survivors of early stage cervical cancer treated by modified radical 
hysterectomy (Piver II/ Type B) have a better sexual function than those 
operated by classic radical hysterectomy (Piver III/ Type C2).

Netherlands. p.l.jansen@amc.uva.nl

There is still a lack of clarity concerning the long-term outcome and severity 
of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Results of a study recently 
conducted by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
showed that patients with NAFLD diagnosed 30 years ago did not experience 
decreased survival when compared with persons without NAFLD. But questions arise 
about the diagnostic methods in this study and the consequences for daily 
practice. Is NAFLD really a disease, and what is the diagnostic method of 
choice?

BACKGROUND: Using a previously developed method for calculating expected years 
of life with care needs based on data from the Japanese long-term care insurance 
system, we examined recent trends in expected years of life with care needs by 
age group and prefecture.
METHODS: Information on care needs was available from the long-term care 
insurance system of Japan. Expected years of life with care needs by age group 
and prefecture in 2005-2009 were calculated.
RESULTS: Expected years of life with care needs at age 65 increased from 1.43 
years in 2005 to 1.62 years in 2009 for men, and from 2.99 to 3.44 years for 
women. As a proportion of total life expectancy, these values show an increase 
from 7.9% to 8.6% in men and from 12.9% to 14.4% in women. Expected years with 
care needs did not increase in the age groups of 65 to 69 and 70 to 74 years but 
markedly increased in the age group of 85 years or older. Expected years with 
care needs increased in every prefecture during the period studied. The 
difference in 2005 between the 25th and 75th percentiles in prefectural 
distributions was 0.16 years for men and 0.35 years for women. The difference 
remained nearly constant between 2005 and 2009.
CONCLUSIONS: Expected number of years of life with care needs increased among 
Japanese from 2005 to 2009, and there was a wide range in distribution among 
prefectures. Further studies on coverage of care needs under the long-term 
insurance program are necessary.

BACKGROUND: The Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) is a 
longitudinal data collection process that systematically and continuously 
monitors population dynamics for a specified population in a geographically 
defined area that lacks an effective system for registering demographic 
information and vital events.
METHODS: HDSS programs have been run in 2 regions in Kenya: in Mbita district in 
Nyanza province and Kwale district in Coast Province. The 2 areas have different 
disease burdens and cultures. Vital events were obtained by using personal 
digital assistants and global positioning system devices. Additional 
health-related surveys have been conducted bimonthly using various PDA-assisted 
survey software.
RESULTS: The Mbita HDSS covers 55,929 individuals, and the Kwale HDSS covers 42 
585 individuals. In the Mbita HDSS, the life expectancy was 61.0 years for 
females and 57.5 years for males. Under-5 mortality was 91.5 per 1000 live 
births, and infant mortality was 47.0 per 1000 live births. The total fertility 
rate was 3.7 per woman. Data from the Kwale HDSS were not available because it 
has been running for less than 1 year at the time of this report.
CONCLUSIONS: Our HDSS programs are based on a computer-assisted survey system 
that provides a rapid and flexible data collection platform in areas that lack 
an effective basic resident registration system. Although the HDSS areas are not 
representative of the entire country, they provide a base for several 
epidemiologic and social study programs, and for practical community support 
programs that seek to improve the health of the people in these areas.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of cycle 
exercise during hemodialysis (HD) on patients' physical proficiency, muscle 
strength, quality of life and selected laboratory parameters.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a group of 29 (15 female, 14 male) HD patients (age 
64.2 ± 13.1 years), 3 months of cycle training during dialysis sessions was 
performed. The following data were analyzed: strength of lower extremities 
(six-minute walk test, isokinetic knee extension, flexion peak torque), 
nutrition parameters (albumin, BMI), inflammation intensity (CRP, IL-6), and 
quality of life (SF-36v2).
RESULTS: In the six-minute walk test, the increase in walk velocity was 4% (3.56 
km/h before and 3.73 km/h after cycle training; p < 0.01). At angular velocity 
(AV) of 60°/s, extension peak torque in the knee joint rose by 7% and at AV of 
300°/s by 4% (p = 0.04). Flexion peak torque at AV of 180°/s increased by 13% (p 
= 0.0005). The program does not influence nutrition or inflammation parameters. 
No complications directly related to exercise were observed.
CONCLUSION: Cycle exercise during dialysis is safe even in older HD patients 
with multiple comorbidities. It results in a significant increase in general 
patient walking ability and in a gain in lower extremity muscle strength.

The role played by resident microglia and by the infiltration of peripheral 
monocytes/macrophages in the innate immune response during herpes simplex virus 
type 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis was evaluated in mice deficient for the CCR2 and 
CX3CR1 receptors. CCR2(-/-), CX3CR1(-/-) and C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) male mice 
were infected intranasally with 7×10(5) p.f.u. of an HSV-1 clinical strain and 
monitored for signs of encephalitis and survival. In addition, brain viral DNA 
load and cytokine levels were evaluated by RT-PCR and magnetic bead-based 
immunoassay, respectively. The cellular response was assessed by 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting of blood and brain leukocytes. Infected 
CX3CR1(-/-) mice had a significantly lower mean life expectancy than WT mice 
(P<0.05, log-rank test) and demonstrated an increased infiltration of 
Ly-6C(high) 'inflammatory' macrophages in the brain (P<0.05). Infected CCR2(-/-) 
mice had fewer monocytes (P<0.05), with a lower proportion of Ly-6C(high) 
'inflammatory' monocytes in the blood than the other groups (P<0.05). Brain 
viral DNA loads were only slightly higher in knockout mice than in WT mice 
(P-value not significant). These data suggest that CCR2 and especially CX3CR1 
receptors are necessary to initiate a proper immune response during HSV 
encephalitis. More precisely, CCR2 is crucial for the emigration of monocytes 
from the bone marrow to the blood, whereas CX3CR1 is mostly implicated in the 
regulation of infiltrating cells from the blood to the site of infection and in 
the control of the immune homeostasis of the brain.

Pre- and posttransplant management of solid organ transplant recipients: 
risk-adjusted follow-up.

Switzerland.

Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) have an increased risk of skin cancer 
due to their long-term immunosuppressive state. As the number of these patients 
is increasing, as well as their life expectancy, it is important to discuss the 
screening and management of skin cancer in this group of patients. The role of 
the dermatologist, in collaboration with the transplant team, is important both 
before transplantation, where patients are screened for skin lesions and the 
individual risk for skin cancer development is assessed, and after 
transplantation. Posttransplant management consists of regular dermatological 
consultations (the frequency depends on different factors discussed below), 
where early skin cancer screening and management, as well as patient education 
on sun protective behavior is taught and enforced. Indeed, SOTR are very 
sensitive to sun damage due to their immunosuppressive state, leading to 
cumulative sun damage which results in field cancerization with numerous lesions 
such as in situ squamous cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis and Bowen's disease. 
These lesions should be recognized and treated as early as possible. Therapeutic 
options discussed will involve topical therapy, surgical management, adjustment 
of the patient's immunosuppressive therapy (i.e. reduction of immunosuppression 
and/or switch to mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors) and chemoprevention 
with the retinoid acitretin, which reduces the recurrence rate of squamous cell 
carcinoma. The dermatological follow-up of SOTR should be integrated into the 
comprehensive posttransplant care.

Long-term risk of recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding in patients with liver 
cirrhosis: a 10-year nationwide cohort study.

Peptic ulcer bleeding leads to substantial morbidity and mortality in patients 
with liver cirrhosis, but their long-term risk of recurrent bleeding remains 
elusive. This nationwide cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between 
cirrhosis and recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding by analyzing the Taiwan National 
Health Insurance Research Database. We enrolled a total of 9,711 patients who 
had cirrhosis with clinical complications of portal hypertension from all 
patients (n = 271,030) hospitalized for peptic ulcer bleeding between January 
1997 and December 2006, along with 38,844 controls who were matched at a 1:4 
proportion for age, sex, and antisecretory agents. We accounted for death as the 
competing cause of risk when calculating the cumulative incidences and hazard 
ratios of recurrent bleeding during the 10-year study period. Overall, patients 
with cirrhosis had a significantly higher death-adjusted rebleeding rate 
compared with controls (1 year, 14.4% versus 11.3%; 5 years, 26.1% versus 22.5%; 
10 years, 28.4% versus 27.1%; P < 0.001). The modified Cox proportional hazard 
model verified that cirrhosis was significantly associated with peptic ulcer 
rebleeding (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.19; 95% confidence interval, 2.62-3.88), 
but also uncovered a seemingly paradoxical interaction between cirrhosis and 
age. Multivariate stratified analysis further revealed that the rebleeding risk 
after adjustment for death diminished with age in patients with cirrhosis, whose 
risk of death far exceeded that of rebleeding when they grew old.
CONCLUSION: Liver cirrhosis is associated with long-term risk of recurrent 
peptic ulcer bleeding, although the risk declines with age because of death 
being the competing cause. Effective therapy should be sought to reduce this 
excessive risk in these critically ill patients, particularly for those at 
younger age with longer life expectancy.

Niemann-pick disease type C: implications for sedation and anesthesia for 
diagnostic procedures.

Center, Bethesda, MD, USA.

Niemann-Pick disease type C, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, 
can present with severe visceral and neurologic involvement and is associated 
with a significant decrease in life expectancy. As little is known about 
anesthetic considerations of this disease, we examined the perianesthetic course 
of patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C. Thirty-two patients with 
Niemann-Pick disease type C, median age 6.9 years (1.8-33 years), underwent 64 
general anesthetics for diagnostic procedures. Perianesthetic morbidity included 
need for tracheal reintubation, pneumonitis, hypothermia, and seizure. 
Therefore, Niemann-Pick disease type C-associated neurologic and visceral 
involvement might have anesthetic implications that neurologists and 
pediatricians should be aware of and consider discussing with parents, 
guardians, and the patient's care team when procedures requiring anesthesia are 
planned. Furthermore, it is important for delivery of safe anesthesia that there 
is communication among care team members so that all involved understand the 
disease manifestation spectrum.

Endovascular management of acute upper extremity deep venous thrombosis and the 
use of superior vena cava filters.

Koury JP(1), Burke CT.

Author information:

Hill, North Carolina.

Upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT), though less common than lower 
extremity DVT, is a significant problem with several possible etiologies. The 
incidence of UEDVT is on the rise, primarily from the increasing use of central 
venous access devices. However, there are other causes of UEDVT, including 
primary venous thrombosis (Paget-Schroetter syndrome) and hypercoagulable states 
associated with underlying malignancy. The morbidity and mortality associated 
with UEDVT is largely from pulmonary embolism and the postphlebitic syndrome. 
Nevertheless, many UEDVTs are asymptomatic or patients may present with 
nonspecific clinical symptoms; therefore, a high index of suspicion is often 
necessary to make a correct diagnosis. Currently, there is no standard treatment 
algorithm for UEDVT. Treatment options may range from systemic anticoagulation 
to surgical correction depending on the etiology of the thrombus, as well as the 
patient's associated comorbidities, life expectancy and expected quality of life 
following treatment.

Health-related quality of life using the EuroQol 5D questionnaire in Korean 
patients with type 2 diabetes.

We aimed; 1) to determine the validity of the EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) for the 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of Korean patients with type 2 diabetes, 
and 2) to identify associated factors of the HRQOL of these patients. Follow-up 
surveys were conducted for consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes. HRQOL was 
assessed using the EQ-5D and the Short Form-36 (SF-36). The validity of EQ-5D 
was assessed with the perspectives of known group, convergent and discriminant 
validity. Additionally, a linear mixed model using a backward elimination was 
used for identify associated factors. Of the 1,072 patients included in the 
first survey, 858 (80.0%) completed the questionnaires in the follow-up. In the 
known group validity, the problem rates in each EQ-5D dimension were highest 
among women, elderly people, and less-educated subjects. The Spearman's ρ 
between the EQ-5D and the SF-36 scales were larger in the comparable dimensions 
than those in the less comparable dimensions. In the final model, we found that 
sex, age, education, body mass index, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and 
retinopathy were statistically significant. Our data suggest that the EQ-5D is a 
valid tool for Korean patients with type 2 diabetes and that various factors 
could affect their HRQOL.

Correcting magnesium deficiencies may prolong life.

Rowe WJ(1).

The International Space Station provides an extraordinary facility to study the 
accelerated aging process in microgravity, which could be triggered by 
significant reductions in magnesium (Mg) ion levels with, in turn, elevations of 
catecholamines and vicious cycles between the two. With space flight there are 
significant reductions of serum Mg (P < 0.0001) that have been shown in large 
studies of astronauts and cosmonauts. The loss of the functional capacity of the 
cardiovascular system with space flight is over ten times faster than the course 
of aging on Earth. Mg is an antioxidant and calcium blocker and in space there 
is oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and inflammatory conditions with 
evidence in experimental animals of significant endothelial injuries and damage 
to mitochondria. The aging process is associated with progressive shortening of 
telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences, and proteins that cap and protect the ends 
of chromosomes. Telomerase can elongate pre-existing telomeres to maintain 
length and chromosome stability. Low telomerase triggers increased 
catecholamines while the sensitivity of telomere synthesis to Mg ions is 
primarily seen for the longer elongation products. Mg stabilizes DNA and 
promotes DNA replication and transcription, whereas low Mg might accelerate 
cellular senescence by reducing DNA stability, protein synthesis, and function 
of mitochondria. Telomerase, in binding to short DNAs, is Mg dependent. On 
Earth, in humans, a year might be required to detect changes in telomeres, but 
in space there is a predictably much shorter duration required for detection, 
which is therefore more reasonable in time and cost. Before and after a space 
mission, telomere lengths and telomerase enzyme activity can be determined and 
compared with age-matched control rats on Earth. The effect of Mg 
supplementation, both on maintaining telomere length and extending the life 
span, can be evaluated. Similar studies in astronauts would be fruitful.

Kinetic models of metabolism require detailed knowledge of kinetic parameters. 
However, due to measurement errors or lack of data this knowledge is often 
uncertain. The model of glycolysis in the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei 
is a particularly well analysed example of a quantitative metabolic model, but 
so far it has been studied with a fixed set of parameters only. Here we evaluate 
the effect of parameter uncertainty. In order to define probability 
distributions for each parameter, information about the experimental sources and 
confidence intervals for all parameters were collected. We created a wiki-based 
website dedicated to the detailed documentation of this information: the 
SilicoTryp wiki (http://silicotryp.ibls.gla.ac.uk/wiki/Glycolysis). Using 
information collected in the wiki, we then assigned probability distributions to 
all parameters of the model. This allowed us to sample sets of alternative 
models, accurately representing our degree of uncertainty. Some properties of 
the model, such as the repartition of the glycolytic flux between the glycerol 
and pyruvate producing branches, are robust to these uncertainties. However, our 
analysis also allowed us to identify fragilities of the model leading to the 
accumulation of 3-phosphoglycerate and/or pyruvate. The analysis of the control 
coefficients revealed the importance of taking into account the uncertainties 
about the parameters, as the ranking of the reactions can be greatly affected. 
This work will now form the basis for a comprehensive Bayesian analysis and 
extension of the model considering alternative topologies.

[Metastasizing of follicular thyroid cancer to the skull base].

[Article in Russian]

[No authors listed]

Distant metastases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma are observed in 5-10% of 
cases. Cerebral metastases are common for papillary carcinoma while cranial 
bones are usually affected by metastases of follicular cancer. Diagnostics of 
metastases of follicular carcinoma is complicated due to absence of 
pathognomonic signs and in 42% of cases they represent clinical onset of the 
disease. Neurosurgical treatment of metastases is associated with difficulties 
caused by abundant vasculature and intimate contact with critical structures of 
the skull base. Nevertheless metastases of follicular thyroid carcinoma have 
relatively favorable course: after surgical resection and hormonal replacement 
therapy and local iodine radiotherapy life expectancy is 4.5 years longer.

The evaluation of lifestyle interventions in the Netherlands.

Assessment, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

Comment in
    Health Econ Policy Law. 2015 Oct;10(4):461-5.

Current investments in preventive lifestyle interventions are relatively low, 
despite the significant impact of unhealthy behaviour on population health. This 
raises the question of whether the criteria used in reimbursement decisions 
about healthcare interventions put preventive interventions at a disadvantage. 
In this paper, we highlight the decision-making framework used in the 
Netherlands to delineate the basic benefits package. Important criteria in that 
framework are 'necessity' and 'cost-effectiveness'. Several normative choices 
need to be made, and these choices can have an important impact on the 
evaluation of lifestyle interventions, especially when making these criteria 
operational and quantifiable. Moreover, the implementation of the 
decision-making framework may prove to be difficult for lifestyle interventions. 
Improvements of the decision-making framework in the Netherlands are required to 
guarantee sound evaluations of lifestyle interventions aimed at improving 
health.

Laminectomy and extension of instrumented fusion improves 2-year pain, 
disability, and quality of life in patients with adjacent segment disease: 
defining the long-term effectiveness of surgery.

Laboratory, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Adjacent segment disease (ASD) may occur as a long-term consequence 
of spinal fusion and is associated with significant back and leg pain. Surgical 
management of symptomatic ASD consists of neural decompression and extension of 
fusion. However, conflicting results have been reported with respect to the 
long-term clinical effectiveness of revision surgery in this setting. We set out 
to comprehensively assess the long-term clinical outcome after revision surgery 
and determine its effectiveness in the treatment of adjacent segment disease.
METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing revision surgery for ASD-associated back and 
leg pain were included in this study. Baseline and 2-year Visual Analog 
Scale-Back Pain (VAS-BP), Visual Analog Scale-Leg Pain (VAS-LP), Oswestry 
Disability Index, physical and mental quality of life (Short Form-12 [SF-12] 
physical and mental component score [PCS and MCS]) and health-state utility 
(EuroQol [EQ-5D]) were assessed.
RESULTS: A sustained improvement in VAS-BP (8.72 ± 1.85 vs. 3.92 ± 2.84, P = 
0.001), VAS-LP (6.30 ± 3.90 vs. 3.02 ± 3.03, P = 0.001), Oswestry Disability 
Index (28.72 ± 9.64 vs. 18.48 ± 11.31, P = 0.001), SF-12 PCS (26.89 ± 8.85 vs. 
35.58 ± 11.97, P = 0.001) and SF-12 MCS (44.66 ± 12.85 vs. 53.16 ± 9.46, P = 
0.001) was observed 2 years after revision surgery, with a cumulative mean 
2-year gain of 0.76 quality-adjusted life-years (EQ-5D). Median (interquartile 
range) time to narcotic independence and return to work was 1.7 (1.0-8.0) months 
and 2.0 (1.0-4.75) months, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing decompression and extension of fusion for 
adjacent segment disease-associated back and leg pain reported long-term 
improvement in pain, disability, and both physical and mental quality of life, 
suggesting that revision surgery is a highly effective treatment strategy in 
this patient population.
