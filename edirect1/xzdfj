INTRODUCTION: Rotator cuff injuries account for up to 70% of pain in the 
shoulder. However, there remains no consensus on the best surgical treatment for 
patients with rotator cuff injuries, in terms of the cost-effectiveness and 
cost-utility of open and arthroscopic methods for rotator cuff repair. The 
objective of this trial is to compare the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and 
cost-utility of open and arthroscopic procedures for rotator cuff repair.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The trial is a two-group, parallel-design, randomised 
controlled trial. A total of 100 patients with symptomatic rotator cuff lesions 
will be allocated in either open or arthroscopic technique in a 1:1 ratio, 
considering smoking (yes or no), lesion size (≤3 cm or >3 cm) and diabetes 
(present or absent) as stratification factors. All patients will be included in 
the same rehabilitation programme after the intervention. The primary outcome 
measure will be the Constant-Murley Score and the EuroQol-5D-3L score at 48 
weeks postsurgery. Secondary outcomes include cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, 
pain, complications and clinical analysis, using the Simple Shoulder Test, 
Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS), integrity of the repair evaluated through MRI, 
and complications and failures of the proposed methods. For the 
cost-effectiveness analysis, we will use the VAS and the Constant-Murley Score 
as measures of effectiveness. For the cost-utility analysis, we will use the 
EuroQol-5D-3L as a measure of utility in terms of incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-years.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the local research 
ethics committee of both institutions: Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein and 
Hospital Alvorada Moema/Hospital Pró-Cardíaco. The results will be published in 
a peer-reviewed, open access journal.

Plants spend most of their life oscillating around 1-3 Hz due to the effect of 
the wind. Therefore, stems and foliage experience repetitive mechanical stresses 
through these passive movements. However, the mechanism of the cellular 
perception and transduction of such recurring mechanical signals remains an open 
question. Multimeric protein complexes forming mechanosensitive (MS) channels 
embedded in the membrane provide an efficient system to rapidly convert 
mechanical tension into an electrical signal. So far, studies have mostly 
focused on nonoscillatory stretching of these channels. Here, we show that the 
plasma-membrane MS channel MscS-LIKE 10 (MSL10) from the model plant Arabidopsis 
thaliana responds to pulsed membrane stretching with rapid activation and 
relaxation kinetics in the range of 1 s. Under sinusoidal membrane stretching 
MSL10 presents a greater activity than under static stimulation. We observed 
this amplification mostly in the range of 0.3-3 Hz. Above these frequencies the 
channel activity is very close to that under static conditions. With a 
localization in aerial organs naturally submitted to wind-driven oscillations, 
our results suggest that the MS channel MSL10, and by extension MS channels 
sharing similar properties, represents a molecular component allowing the 
perception of oscillatory mechanical stimulations by plants.

Recent studies have shown that high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) treated with sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have 
improved cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. In an exploratory analysis of data from 
the EMPA-REG study, elevations in haematocrit were shown to be strongly 
associated with beneficial CV effects. As insulin treatment has been shown to be 
antinatriuretic, with an associated increase in extracellular fluid volume, it 
is important to confirm whether haematocrit increase is maintained with 
concomitant insulin therapy. Here, we investigate the effect of the SGLT2 
inhibitor dapagliflozin on haematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) counts and 
reticulocyte levels in high-risk patients with T2DM receiving insulin. A 
24-week, double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial 
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00673231) was reported previously with extension periods 
of 24 and 56 weeks (total of 104 weeks). Patients receiving insulin were 
randomised 1:1:1:1 to placebo or dapagliflozin at 2.5, 5 or 10 mg. Haematocrit, 
RBC and reticulocyte measurements were conducted during this study, and a 
longitudinal repeated-measures analysis was performed here to examine change 
from baseline during treatment. Dapagliflozin treatment in combination with 
insulin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in haematocrit levels and RBCs 
over a 104 week period. There was a short-term increase in reticulocyte levels 
at the start of treatment, which dropped to below baseline after 8 weeks. SGLT2 
inhibition with dapagliflozin leads to a sustained increase in haematocrit in 
patients receiving chronic insulin treatment.

Background Although women represent half of the population burden of aortic 
stenosis (AS), little is known whether sex affects the presentation, management, 
and outcome of patients with AS. Methods and Results In a cohort of 2429 
patients with severe AS (49.5% women) we aimed to evaluate 5-year excess 
mortality and performance of aortic valve replacement (AVR) stratified by sex. 
At presentation, women were older (P<0.001), with less comorbidities (P=0.030) 
and more often symptomatic (P=0.007) than men. Women had smaller aortic valve 
area (P<0.001) than men but similar mean transaortic pressure gradient (P=0.18). 
The 5-year survival was lower compared with expected survival, especially for 
women (62±2% versus 71% for women and 69±1% versus 71% for men). Despite longer 
life expectancy in women than men, women had lower 5-year survival than men 
(66±2% [expected-75%] versus 68±2% [expected-70%], P<0.001) after matching for 
age. Overall, 5-year AVR incidence was 79±2% for men versus 70±2% for women 
(P<0.001) with male sex being independently associated with more frequent early 
AVR performance (odds ratio, 1.49; 1.18-1.97). After age matching, women 
remained more often symptomatic (P=0.004) but also displayed lower AVR use 
(64.4% versus 69.1%; P=0.018). Conclusions Women with severe AS are diagnosed at 
later ages and have more symptoms than men. Despite prevalent symptoms, AVR is 
less often performed in women and 5-year excess mortality is noted in women 
versus men, even after age matching. These imbalances should be addressed to 
ensure that both sexes receive equivalent care for severe AS.

A literature review on desmoid tumors was carried out, which are tumors that 
affect soft tissues with a locally aggressive behavior and are unable to 
metastasize. Sporadic cases are located on the extremities and chest wall; 
hereditary cases have an intra-abdominal predilection, and those associated with 
pregnancy occur on the abdominal wall. Imaging techniques assess disease 
extension. Trucut biopsy is the study of choice for diagnosis. Mutations in the 
CTNNB1 or APC genes cause an abnormal accumulation of b-catenin within the cell. 
In this review, an emphasis is made on therapeutic strategies' evolution and 
change, and current tools for decision making are analyzed, as well as clinical 
outcomes. Radiation therapy can play a therapeutic or adjuvant role. Advances in 
the understanding of the disease have allowed establishing better targeted 
treatments with lower morbidity; however, there are still unanswered questions 
regarding the choice of the ideal candidate for surveillance and/or early 
treatment. Data related to quality of life are also presented, as well as the 
uncertainty generated by this diagnosis for both doctor and patient.

Publisher: Se realizó una revisión bibliográfica de los tumores desmoides, lo 
cuales afectan los tejidos blandos con un comportamiento localmente agresivo sin 
capacidad de producir metástasis. Los casos esporádicos se localizan en 
extremidades y pared torácica; los casos hereditarios tienen predilección 
intraabdominal y los asociados con el embarazo en la pared abdominal. Las 
técnicas de imagen evalúan la extensión de la enfermedad. La biopsia con aguja 
trucut es el estudio de elección para el diagnóstico. Las mutaciones en el gen 
CTNNB1 o en el gen de APC provocan acumulación anormal de betacatenina en la 
célula. En esta revisión se hace énfasis en la evolución y cambio de las 
estrategias terapéuticas y se analizan las actuales herramientas para la toma de 
decisiones, así como los resultados clínicos. La radioterapia puede tener un 
papel terapéutico o adyuvante. Los avances en la comprensión de la enfermedad 
han permitido establecer tratamientos mejor dirigidos y con menor morbilidad; 
sin embargo, aún existen interrogantes en cuanto a la elección del candidato 
ideal para la vigilancia o el tratamiento precoz. También se presentan datos 
relacionados con la calidad de vida y la incertidumbre que genera el diagnóstico 
en el médico y el paciente.

Evaluation of Team-Based Learning to Increase Nurses' Knowledge of the 
Ventricular Assist Device.

Runyan C, Marshall C, Aronow H, Vongkavivathanakul S, Daniels L, Currey J, 
Coleman B.

Ventricular assist devices (VAD) are used to extend life expectancy for patients 
with advanced heart failure. Approximately 102 hospitals nationwide have a VAD 
program, but the majority implant only a small number of devices each year. This 
low-volume and high-acuity patient population can create concerns for 
maintaining nursing knowledge skill levels. Nursing staff from a step-down 
telemetry floor in a large urban hospital completed an Individual Readiness 
Assessment Test to assess their knowledge and accuracy in the care of mechanical 
circulatory support patients using the Immediate Feedback Assessment Technique. 
The nurses were then assigned to small groups and worked as a team to complete 
the same test known as the Group Readiness Assessment Test. Study results 
suggest that team-based learning was effective in increasing knowledge of 
mechanical circulatory support. [J Contin Educ Nurs. 2021;52(1):13-20.].

Psoriasis mainly affects the skin and joints and has serious impacts on the 
physical, emotional, and financial life of patients. Recent studies have 
demonstrated that other comorbidities are frequently detected in psoriatic 
patients. A strong association with the development of cardiovascular diseases, 
such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke is responsible for the 
shortened (by 4.5-5 years) life expectancy of severe psoriatic patients. 
Systemic inflammation plays an important role in the interrelationship between 
psoriasis and atherosclerotic plaque formation, which is a common 
immunopathogenic pathway that explains the multiorgan involvement in psoriasis. 
As far life-threatening cardiovascular diseases are very often symptom-free, the 
treating dermatologist's responsibility is to initiate interdisciplinary 
holistic patient care, which may lead to directly saved patients' lives. 
Holistic care of severe psoriatic patients should include regular cardiac 
monitoring using cardiovascular imaging modalities and functional testing to 
detect even subclinical coronary artery disease. Effective anti-inflammatory 
treatment with biologic therapies may have beneficial effects on the 
cardiovascular state and may reduce the incidence of cardiac events. The authors 
review the latest findings on the shared immunopathogenic background of 
psoriasis and cardiovascular diseases and discuss the available data about the 
cardiovascular responses to the currently used biologic treatments.

BACKGROUND: Studies from high-income countries reported reduced life expectancy 
in children with cerebral palsy (CP), while no population-based study has 
evaluated mortality of children with CP in sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed 
to estimate the mortality rate (MR) of children with CP in a rural region of 
Uganda and identify risk factors and causes of death (CODs).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: This population-based, longitudinal cohort study was based 
on data from Iganga-Mayuge Health and Demographic Surveillance System in eastern 
Uganda. We identified 97 children (aged 2-17 years) with CP in 2015, whom we 
followed to 2019. They were compared with an age-matched cohort from the general 
population (n = 41 319). MRs, MR ratios (MRRs), hazard ratios (HRs), and 
immediate CODs were determined. MR was 3952 per 100 000 person years (95% CI 
2212-6519) in children with CP and 137 per 100 000 person years (95% CI 117-159) 
in the general population. Standardized MRR was 25·3 in the CP cohort, compared 
with the general population. In children with CP, risk of death was higher in 
those with severe gross motor impairments than in those with milder impairments 
(HR 6·8; p = 0·007) and in those with severe malnutrition than in those less 
malnourished (HR = 3·7; p = 0·052). MR was higher in females in the CP cohort, 
with a higher MRR in females (53·0; 95% CI 26·4-106·3) than in males (16·3; 95% 
CI 7·2-37·2). Age had no significant effect on MR in the CP cohort, but MRR was 
higher at 10-18 years (39·6; 95% CI 14·2-110·0) than at 2-6 years (21·0; 95% CI 
10·2-43·2). Anaemia, malaria, and other infections were the most common CODs in 
the CP cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk of premature death was excessively high in children with CP in 
rural sub-Saharan Africa, especially in those with severe motor impairments or 
malnutrition. While global childhood mortality has significantly decreased 
during recent decades, this observed excessive mortality is a hidden 
humanitarian crisis that needs to be addressed.

Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, negatively impacts patients' 
quality of life (QoL). This randomized, phase III, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
brodalumab, a human anti-interleukin-17 receptor A monoclonal antibody, in 
Korean patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Coprimary end-points 
were the percentage of patients with 75% or more improvement in Psoriasis Area 
and Severity Index (PASI 75) and static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) 
success (score 0/1) at week 12. Secondary end-points included the percentage 
improvement from baseline in PASI score and proportion of patients with PASI 
50/75/90/100 responses. QoL was assessed with the Dermatology Life Quality Index 
(DLQI). Eligible patients were randomized to receive brodalumab 210 mg (N = 40) 
or placebo (N = 22) every 2 weeks (Q2W) at a 2:1 ratio for 12 weeks. 
Subsequently, all patients entered an open-label extension phase and received 
brodalumab 210 mg Q2W until week 62. At week 12, the proportion of patients who 
achieved the coprimary end-points, PASI 75 and sPGA success, was significantly 
higher in the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group compared with the placebo group (92.5% 
vs 0%). At week 12, the mean ± SD percentage improvement in the PASI score was 
96.87 ± 6.01% in the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group, which was maintained until 
study end (week 64). PASI 50/75/90 responses were achieved by 100% of patients 
receiving brodalumab 210 mg Q2W at weeks 6, 13, and 24, respectively; PASI 100 
was achieved by 82.8% of patients at week 64. Brodalumab treatment rapidly 
improved DLQI scores. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, tinea pedis, and urticaria. 
Overall, treatment with brodalumab 210 mg Q2W resulted in a rapid and 
significant clinical benefit and was well tolerated in patients with moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis in Korea.

PASylated Thymosin α1: A Long-Acting Immunostimulatory Peptide for Applications 
in Oncology and Virology.

Thymosin α1 (Tα1) is an immunostimulatory peptide for the treatment of hepatitis 
B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and used as an immune 
enhancer, which also offers prospects in the context of COVID-19 infections and 
cancer. Manufacturing of this N-terminally acetylated 28-residue peptide is 
demanding, and its short plasma half-life limits in vivo efficacy and requires 
frequent dosing. Here, we combined the PASylation technology with enzymatic in 
situ N-acetylation by RimJ to produce a long-acting version of Tα1 in 
Escherichia coli at high yield. ESI-MS analysis of the purified fusion protein 
indicated the expected composition without any signs of proteolysis. SEC 
analysis revealed a 10-fold expanded hydrodynamic volume resulting from the 
fusion with a conformationally disordered Pro/Ala/Ser (PAS) polypeptide of 600 
residues. This size effect led to a plasma half-life in rats extended by more 
than a factor 8 compared to the original synthetic peptide due to retarded 
kidney filtration. Our study provides the basis for therapeutic development of a 
next generation thymosin α1 with prolonged circulation. Generally, the strategy 
of producing an N-terminally protected PASylated peptide solves three major 
problems of peptide drugs: (i) instability in the expression host, (ii) rapid 
degradation by serum exopeptidases, and (iii) low bioactivity because of fast 
renal clearance.

Gut microbiota (GM) is involved in the maintenance of physiological homeostasis, 
thus the alteration of its composition and functionality has been associated 
with many pathologies such as metabolic diseases, and could also be linked with 
the progressive degenerative process in aging. Nowadays, life expectancy is 
continuously rising, so the number of elder people and the consequent related 
pathologies demand new strategies to achieve healthy aging. Besides, actual 
lifestyle patterns make metabolic diseases a global epidemic with increasing 
trends, responsible for a large mortality and morbidity in adulthood and also 
compromising the health status of later stages of life. Metabolic diseases and 
aging share a profile of low-grade inflammation and innate immunity activation, 
which may have disturbances of GM composition as the leading mechanism. Thus, GM 
emerges as a therapeutic target with a double impact in the elderly, 
counteracting both aging itself and the frequent metabolic diseases in this 
population. This review summarizes the role and compositional changes of the GM 
in aging and its modulation through nutritional interventions and physical 
exercise as a strategy to counteract the aging process and the related metabolic 
diseases.

Tick-borne agents constitute a growing concern for human and animal health 
worldwide. Hyalomma aegyptium is a hard tick with a three-host life cycle, whose 
main hosts for adults are Palearctic tortoises of genus Testudo. Nevertheless, 
immature ticks can feed on a variety of hosts, representing an important 
eco-epidemiological issue regarding H. aegyptium pathogens circulation. Hyalomma 
aegyptium ticks are vectors and/or reservoirs of various pathogenic agents, such 
as Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Babesia and Hepatozoon/Hemolivia. Ehrlichia and 
Anaplasma are emergent tick-borne bacteria with a worldwide distribution and 
zoonotic potential, responsible for diseases that cause clinical manifestations 
that grade from acute febrile illness to a fulminant disease characterized by 
multi-organ system failure, depending on the species. Babesia and 
Hepatozoon/Hemolivia are tick-borne parasites with increasing importance in 
multiple species. Testudo graeca tortoises acquired in a large animal market in 
Doha, Qatar, were screened for a panel of tick-borne pathogens by conventional 
PCR followed by bidirectional sequencing. The most prevalent agent identified in 
ticks was Hemolivia mauritanica (28.6%), followed by Candidatus Midichloria 
mitochondrii (9.5%) and Ehrlichia spp. (4.7%). All samples were negative for 
Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon spp. Overall, 43% of the examined adult ticks were 
infected with at least one agent. Only 4.7% of the ticks appeared to be 
simultaneously infected with two agents, i.e., Ehrlichia spp. and H. 
mauritanica. This is the first detection of H. mauritanica, Ehrlichia spp. and 
Candidatus M. mitochondrii in H. aegyptium ticks collected from pet spur-thighed 
tortoises, in Qatar, a fact which adds to the geographical extension of these 
agents. The international trade of Testudo tortoises carrying ticks infected 
with pathogens of veterinary and medical importance deserves strict control, in 
order to reduce potential exotic diseases.

BACKGROUND: Addiction to drugs and alcohol constitutes one of the significant 
factors underlying the decline in life expectancy in the US. Several 
context-specific reasons influence drug use and recovery. In particular 
emotional distress, physical pain, relationships, and self-development efforts 
are known to be some of the factors associated with addiction recovery. 
Unfortunately, many of these factors are not directly observable and 
quantifying, and assessing their impact can be difficult. Based on social media 
posts of users engaged in substance use and recovery on the forum Reddit, we 
employed two psycholinguistic tools, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count and 
Empath and activities of substance users on various Reddit sub-forums to analyze 
behavior underlining addiction recovery and relapse. We then employed a 
statistical analysis technique called structural equation modeling to assess the 
effects of these latent factors on recovery and relapse.
RESULTS: We found that both emotional distress and physical pain significantly 
influence addiction recovery behavior. Self-development activities and social 
relationships of the substance users were also found to enable recovery. 
Furthermore, within the context of self-development activities, those that were 
related to influencing the mental and physical well-being of substance users 
were found to be positively associated with addiction recovery. We also 
determined that lack of social activities and physical exercise can enable a 
relapse. Moreover, geography, especially life in rural areas, appears to have a 
greater correlation with addiction relapse.
CONCLUSIONS: The paper describes how observable variables can be extracted from 
social media and then be used to model important latent constructs that impact 
addiction recovery and relapse. We also report factors that impact self-induced 
addiction recovery and relapse. To the best of our knowledge, this paper 
represents the first use of structural equation modeling of social media data 
with the goal of analyzing factors influencing addiction recovery.

INTRODUCTION: Heart transplantation is the gold standard treatment for selected 
patients with end-stage heart failure. Although this procedure can improve 
quality and prolong life expectancy, several of these patients persist with 
decreased exercise tolerance. Evidence suggests that exercise training can bring 
multifactorial benefits to heart transplant (HTx) recipients. However, it is 
unclear that exercise modality should be preferred. Therefore, the aim of this 
systematic review and network meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy and 
safety of different training modalities in HTx recipients.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will perform a comprehensive literature search in 
PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Scopus, SportDISCUS, Web 
of Science Core Collection and PEDro from inception until November 2020. Two 
registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and REBEC) will also be searched for potential 
results in unpublished studies. There will be no restriction on language, date 
of publication, publication status or sample size. We will include randomised 
controlled trials enrolling adult HTx recipients with the presence of at least 
one exercise training group, which might be compared with another training 
modality and/or a non-exercise control group for a minimum of 4 weeks of 
intervention. The primary outcomes will be peak oxygen consumption and 
occurrence of adverse events. As secondary outcomes, the interaction between 
pulmonary ventilation, pulmonary perfusion and cardiac output, oxygen uptake 
efficiency slope, heart rate response, oxygen pulse, peak blood pressure and 
peak subjective perception of effort. In addition, we will evaluate the 6 min 
walking distance, health-related quality of life, endothelial function, muscle 
strength, body fat percentage and lean mass. Risk of bias will be assessed using 
the Cochrane RoB V.2.0 tool, and we plan to use the Confidence in Network 
Meta-Analysis tool to assess confidence in the results. All materials (raw data, 
processed data, statistical code and outputs) will be shared in a public 
repository.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Given the nature of this study, no ethical approval 
will be required. We believe that the findings of this study may show which is 
the most efficacious and safe physical training modality for HTx recipients. The 
completed systematic review and network meta-analysis will be submitted to a 
peer-reviewed journal.

BACKGROUND: People with intellectual disability die younger than their 
non-disabled peers. In recent years, greater attention has been paid to closing 
the gap. However, evidence that this is being achieved is limited by the dearth 
of longitudinal, national data.
METHOD: Over 4,000 decedents identified in the Irish National Intellectual 
Disability Database from 2001 to 2016 were compared to deaths in the general 
population based on age and gender profiles using death rates and standardised 
mortality ratios. A binary logistic regression analysis also identified the 
characteristics of persons who had a higher risk of dying.
RESULTS: Irish people with intellectual disability die younger and have a higher 
rate of death than their non-disabled peers. Nor has the gap between their 
mortality and that of the general population closed in recent years.
CONCLUSIONS: More concentrated effort is needed in Ireland on promoting 
equitable access to health services for people with intellectual disability.

HIV medicine for dermatologists and venereologists.

Esser S(1), Sammet S(1).

Essen, Germany.

Broad administration of combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically 
reduced the morbidity and mortality of the HIV-infection and substantially 
improved the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH). PLWH, who are 
effectively treated with an ART, are considered to be unable to transmit HIV. 
The standard of care is usually an antiretroviral single tablet regimen. Since 
2015 the Robert Koch Institute has reported a slight decrease in the rate of 
recently diagnosed HIV-infections in Germany, but the proportion of late 
presenters (initial diagnosis in advanced stages of infection) has remained 
consistently high at around 32 % since 2005. HIV-infections have not been 
diagnosed in 10,800 PLWH so far. In comparison to the general population PLWH 
suffer more frequently from skin diseases. Depending on the stage of 
immunodeficiency, untreated PLWH develop HIV indicator diseases of the skin and 
the mucocutaneous membranes. Knowledge of these diseases facilitates the 
selection of individuals who should be offered HIV testing. Early diagnosis of 
HIV-infections allows early introduction of the ART, prevents the spread of HIV 
and reduces the mortality rates and treatment costs associated with late 
diagnosis. HIV is a predominantly sexually transmitted infection. Through 
focused sexual anamnesis and the diagnosis of HIV indicator diseases and other 
sexually transmitted infections, dermatovenereologists in particular may be able 
to identify previously undiagnosed PLWH and persons with an increased risk of 
HIV infection, enabling initiation of ART in the former and pre-exposure 
prophylaxis counseling in the latter.

Birmingham, England, and honorary visiting professor at Birmingham City 
University, Birmingham, England.

The year 2021 marks 100 years since the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of insulin 
as a medical treatment for diabetes mellitus. Its discovery changed type 1 
diabetes from a terminal condition with a short life expectancy to one of 
long-term management, with patients now often living long and fulfilling lives. 
Today, much of the advice, support and prescribing of insulin is undertaken by 
nurses, including general nurses and those specialising in diabetes. This 
article provides an overview of the principles of insulin use in the management 
of diabetes, with the aim of enhancing nursing knowledge and improving the care 
of patients with diabetes.

314. COVID 19 rapid guideline: renal transplantation.

London: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); 2020 Aug 19.
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence: Guidelines.

This guideline covers children, young people and adults who need or who have had 
a kidney transplant, and people who are donating a kidney (live donors). It also 
advises transplant and referring centres on how to run their services while 
keeping them safe for patients, donors and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Kidney transplants improve life expectancy and quality of life, and cost less 
than dialysis in the long term, so providing effective and safe services will 
benefit patients and make the best use of resources. On 19 August 2020, we added 
recommendations for regional networks on responding to changes in local 
prevalence of COVID-19. We aligned recommendations for donors and recipients 
with our COVID-19 guideline on arranging planned care in hospitals and 
diagnostic services. NICE has also produced COVID-19 rapid guidelines on chronic 
kidney disease and dialysis service delivery. Follow the usual professional 
guidelines, standards and laws (including those on equalities, safeguarding, 
communication and mental capacity), as described in making decisions using NICE 
guidelines. This guideline is for: health and care practitioners; health and 
care staff involved in planning and delivering services; commissioners. The 
recommendations bring together: existing national and international guidance and 
policies; advice from specialists working in the NHS from across the UK. These 
include people with expertise and experience of treating patients for the 
specific health conditions covered by the guidance during the current COVID-19 
pandemic. We developed this guideline using the interim process and methods for 
developing rapid guidelines on COVID-19 in response to the rapidly evolving 
situation. We will review and update the recommendations as the knowledge base 
develops using the interim process and methods for guidelines developed in 
response to health and social care emergencies.

BACKGROUND: To assess the points of consideration when performing surgical 
procedures for proximal femoral bone metastasis.
METHODS: Fourty patients who underwent surgery for proximal femoral bone 
metastasis from 2009 to 2019 were included. Prognostic assessments were 
performed based on the Katagiri scoring system. The low-risk group underwent 
endoprosthetic replacement (EPR) following resection, while the high-risk group 
underwent internal fixation (IF). For the intermediate-risk group, one of the 
surgical procedures was chosen depending on general and local condition. 
Survival period, walking ability, and treatment failure were evaluated.
RESULTS: Sixteen and 24 patients underwent EPR and IF, respectively. Although 
walking reacquisition rate was 94% (15 of 16 patients) for EPR and 75% (18 of 24 
patients) for IF (p = 0.210), the median time to walking was shorter in IF 
compared to EPR (EPR, 29 days, interquartile range [IQR] 23-40; IF, 14 days, IQR 
9-24; p = 0.014). Neither EPR nor IF resulted in treatment failure for those 
with survival periods of <1 year. The treatment failure rate for those with 
survival periods of ≥1 year was significantly different between EPR (9%, 1 of 11 
patients) and IF (50%, 5 of 10 patients) (p = 0.038). All five patients of 
treatment failure for IF were renal cancer with no bone formation in the 
intermediate-risk group. Of the 13 patients who underwent IF for the 
intermediate-risk group, treatment failure did not occur in 5 patients with bone 
formation.
CONCLUSIONS: Although EPR is a more reliable treatment than IF, patients with 
life expectancy of <1 year are sufficiently manageable with IF. For the 
intermediate-risk group, EPR should be selected for cases without expected bone 
formation, and IF can be considered for cases with expected bone formation due 
to the risk of treatment failure for IF at ≥ 1 year after surgery.

OBJECTIVE: To project the prevalence of obesity in 2040 among individuals 19 
years and older in South Korea.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using the 'Population Health Model-body mass 
index' (BMI) microsimulation model, the prevalence of obesity in Korean adults 
19 years and older was projected until 2040. The model integrated individual 
survey data from the Korea Health Panel Survey of 2011 and 2012, population 
statistics based on resident registration, population projections and complete 
life tables categorised by sex and age. Birth rate, life expectancy and 
international migration were based on a medium growth scenario. The base 
population of Korean adults in 2012, devised through data aggregation, was 
39 842 730. The prediction equations were formulated using BMI as the dependent 
variable; the individual's sex, age, smoking status, physical activity and 
preceding year's BMI were used as predictive factors.
OUTCOME MEASURE: BMI categorised by sex.
RESULTS: The median BMI for Korean adults in 2040 was expected to be 23.55 kg/m2 
(23.97 and 23.17 kg/m2 for men and women, respectively). According to the Korean 
BMI classification, 70.05% of all adults were expected to be 'preobese' (ie, 
have BMIs 23-24.9 kg/m2) by 2040 (81.23% of men and 59.07% of women) and 24.88% 
to be 'normal'.
CONCLUSIONS: We explored the possibility of applying and expanding on the 
concept of microsimulation in the field of healthcare by combining data sources 
available in Korea and found that more than half of the adults in this study 
population will be preobese, and the proportions of 'obesity' and 'normal' will 
decrease compared with those in 2012. The results of our study will aid in 
devising healthy strategies and spreading public awareness for preventing this 
condition.
