evolved into three muscle type-specific isoforms in vertebrates. Cardiac TnI is 
specifically expressed in the adult heart and has a unique N-terminal extension 
implicating a specific value during natural selection. The N-terminal extension 
of cardiac TnI in higher vertebrates contains β-adrenergic-regulated protein 
kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation sites as a mechanism to enhance cardiac muscle 
relaxation and facilitate ventricular filling. Phylogenic studies showed that 
the N-terminal extension of cardiac TnI first emerged in the genomes of early 
tetrapods as well as primordial lobe-finned fishes such as the coelacanth 
whereas it is absent in ray-finned fish. This apparently rapid evolution of 
β-adrenergic regulation of cardiac function suggests a high selection value for 
the heart of vertebrate animals on land to work under higher metabolic demands. 
Sequencing and PKA phosphorylation data showed that lungfish cardiac TnI has 
evolved with an amphibian-like N-terminal extension with prototype PKA 
phosphorylation sites while its overall structure remained fish like. The data 
demonstrate that the submolecular structure of TnI may evolve ahead of the whole 
protein for cardiac muscle contractility to adapt to new environmental 
conditions. Understanding the evolution of the β-adrenergic regulation of TnI 
and cardiac adaptation to the increased energetic demands of life on land adds 
knowledge for the treatment of human heart diseases and failure.

Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry is firmly established today as 
the gold standard technique for analysis of vitamin D, both for vitamin D status 
assessments as well as for measuring complex and intricate vitamin D metabolic 
fingerprints. While the actual mass spectrometry technology has seen only 
incremental performance increases in recent years, there have been major, very 
impactful changes in the front- and back-end of MS-based vitamin D assays; for 
example, the extension to new types of biological sample matrices analyzed for 
an increasing number of different vitamin D metabolites, novel sample 
preparation techniques, new powerful chemical derivatization reagents, as well 
the continued integration of high resolution mass spectrometers into clinical 
laboratories, replacing established triple-quadrupole instruments. At the same 
time, the sustainability of mass spectrometry operation in the vitamin D field 
is now firmly established through proven analytical harmonization and 
standardization programs. The present review summarizes the most important of 
these recent developments.

BACKGROUND: Decisions about new health technologies are increasingly being made 
while trials are still in an early stage, which may result in substantial 
uncertainty around key decision drivers such as estimates of life expectancy and 
time to disease progression. Additional data collection can reduce uncertainty, 
and its value can be quantified by computing the expected value of sample 
information (EVSI), which has typically been described in the context of 
designing a future trial. In this article, we develop new methods for computing 
the EVSI of extending an existing trial's follow-up, first for an assumed 
survival model and then extending to capture uncertainty about the true survival 
model.
METHODS: We developed a nested Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure and a 
nonparametric regression-based method. We compared the methods by computing 
single-model and model-averaged EVSI for collecting additional follow-up data in 
2 synthetic case studies.
RESULTS: There was good agreement between the 2 methods. The regression-based 
method was fast and straightforward to implement, and scales easily to include 
any number of candidate survival models in the model uncertainty case. The 
nested Monte Carlo procedure, on the other hand, was extremely computationally 
demanding when we included model uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a straightforward regression-based method for computing 
the EVSI of extending an existing trial's follow-up, both where a single known 
survival model is assumed and where we are uncertain about the true survival 
model. EVSI for ongoing trials can help decision makers determine whether early 
patient access to a new technology can be justified on the basis of the current 
evidence or whether more mature evidence is needed.
HIGHLIGHTS: Decisions about new health technologies are increasingly being made 
while trials are still in an early stage, which may result in substantial 
uncertainty around key decision drivers such as estimates of life-expectancy and 
time to disease progression. Additional data collection can reduce uncertainty, 
and its value can be quantified by computing the expected value of sample 
information (EVSI), which has typically been described in the context of 
designing a future trial.In this article, we have developed new methods for 
computing the EVSI of extending a trial's follow-up, both where a single known 
survival model is assumed and where we are uncertain about the true survival 
model. We extend a previously described nonparametric regression-based method 
for computing EVSI, which we demonstrate in synthetic case studies is fast, 
straightforward to implement, and scales easily to include any number of 
candidate survival models in the EVSI calculations.The EVSI methods that we 
present in this article can quantify the need for collecting additional 
follow-up data before making an adoption decision given any decision-making 
context.

By increasing life expectancy of people living with HIV, the most clinical 
challenge is managing both drug-to-drug interactions and comorbidities 
(especially metabolic). Doravirine (DOR), a new non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor, recently approved for the treatment of HIV, could be a 
good companion of dolutegravir (DTG) in a dual regimen for experienced elderly 
patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy.We herein report our preliminary 
experience in a small cohort of elderly patients (>50 years of age) with 
multimorbidity and on polypharmacy who were switched to DOR/DTG dual regimen and 
followed-up for 3 months. The study was conducted at the Infectious and Tropical 
Diseases Unit of Padua University Hospital, Italy.Eighteen patients were 
included, 72.2% males and 27.8% postmenopausal women, mean age was of 61.3 years 
(7.6), 50% experienced AIDS events. Switches to DOR and DTG were mainly due to 
high cardiovascular and metabolic risk (72.2%), and interactions among 
comedications (50%). Antiretrovirals that subjects were switched off were mostly 
boosted protease inhibitors 66.7%. We observed a viral suppression among all 
subjects. Interestingly, we observed a statistically significant reduction in 
body mass index, body weight and waist circumference, eGFR, and a significant 
increase in serum creatinine levels. No significant changes in CD4+ T cell count 
was observed from the baseline. Lipid and fasting glucose values did not change 
significantly.To the best of our knowledge this is the first experience 
reporting real-life outcome of switch to DTG + DOR in elderly with 
multimorbidity and on polypharmacy. From our very preliminary data the dual 
combination of DTG and DOR could be a good treatment strategy for these 
subjects. However, our findings need to be validated on a greater number of 
patients.

Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a potentially interesting anti-inflammatory therapeutic, 
which is rapidly excreted. Therefore, serum half-life extension by polymer 
conjugation is desirable, which may be done by PEGylation. Here, we use PEtOx as 
an alternative to PEG for bioconjugate engineering. We genetically extended 
murine IL-4 (mIL-4) with the d-domain of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), a 
previously identified substrate of transglutaminase (TG) Factor XIIIa (FXIIIa). 
Thereby, engineered mIL-4 (mIL-4-TG) became an educt for TG catalyzed 
C-terminal, site-directed conjugation. This was deployed to enzymatically couple 
an azide group containing peptide sequence to mIL-4, allowing C-terminal 
bioconjugation of polyethylene glycol or poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline). Both 
bioconjugates had wild-type potency and alternatively polarized macrophages.
