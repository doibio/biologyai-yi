OBJECTIVES: Understanding epidemiology trends and patterns of pancreatic cancer 
in China from 1990 to 2019 and predicting the burden to 2030 will provide 
foundations for future policies development.
METHODS: We collected incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) data of pancreatic cancer in China from 1990 to 2019 based on the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2019. We calculated the estimated annual percentage 
change (EAPC) to depict the trends of pancreatic cancer burden and predicted the 
incidence and mortality in the next decade by using a Bayesian age-period-cohort 
analysis.
RESULTS: The number of incident cases sharply increased from 26.77 thousand in 
1990 to 114.96 thousand in 2019, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) 
nearly doubled from 3.17 per 100,000 in 1990 to 5.78 per 100,000 in 2019, with 
an EAPC of 2.32 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.12, 2.51). The mortality and 
DALYs presented a similar pattern with incidence. The dominant risk factor for 
pancreatic cancer was smoking, but the contribution of high body-mass index 
increased from 1990 to 2019. We projected that the incident cases and deaths of 
pancreatic cancer would increase to 218.79 thousand and 222.97 thousand, 
respectively, in 2030 with around 2 times growth.
CONCLUSIONS: During the past three decades, the incidence, mortality and DALYs 
of pancreatic cancer gradually increased in China, and the absolute number and 
rate of pancreatic cancer burden would continue to rise over the next decade. 
Comprehensive policies and strategies need to be implemented to reduce the 
incidence and mortality.

Inhaled treprostinil is an approved therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(PAH) and pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease in 
the United States. Studies have confirmed the robust benefits and safety of 
nebulized inhaled treprostinil, but it requires a time investment for nebulizer 
preparation, maintenance, and treatment. A small, portable treprostinil dry 
powder inhaler has been developed for the treatment of PAH. The primary 
objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
treprostinil inhalation powder (TreT) in patients currently treated with 
treprostinil inhalation solution. Fifty-one patients on a stable dose of 
treprostinil inhalation solution enrolled and transitioned to TreT at a 
corresponding dose. Six-minute walk distance (6MWD), device preference and 
satisfaction (Preference Questionnaire for Inhaled Treprostinil Devices 
[PQ-ITD]), PAH Symptoms and Impact (PAH-SYMPACT®) questionnaire, and systemic 
exposure and pharmacokinetics for up to 5 h were assessed at baseline for 
treprostinil inhalation solution and at Week 3 for TreT. Adverse events (AEs) 
were consistent with studies of inhaled treprostinil in patients with PAH, and 
there were no study drug-related serious AEs. Statistically significant 
improvements occurred in 6MWD, PQ-ITD, and PAH-SYMPACT. Forty-nine patients 
completed the 3-week treatment phase and all elected to participate in an 
optional extension phase. These results demonstrate that, in patients with PAH, 
transition from treprostinil inhalation solution to TreT is safe, 
well-tolerated, and accompanied by statistically significant improvements in key 
clinical assessments and patient-reported outcomes with comparable systemic 
exposure between the two formulations at evaluated doses (trial registration: 
clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03950739).

BACKGROUND: Malignancy is common in older adults undergoing transcatheter aortic 
valve implantation (TAVI), and may affect prognosis. The present study aimed to 
examine whether active cancer affects all-cause mortality rates among patients 
undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: This retrospective study examined data from 1,114 consecutive patients 
treated between April 2010 and June 2019. Patients with life expectancy of 
<1 year due to non-cardiac causes were excluded.
RESULTS: Active cancer was defined as cancer under treatment or cured within 
1 year, and was recognized in 62 patients (5.6%) with (n = 17) and without 
(n = 45) metastases. In multivariate analysis, being female (hazard ratio [HR] 
0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-0.77, p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) 
(HR = 0.92 per 1 kg/m2 increase, 95% CI 0.87-0.97, p = 0.001), New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) class III/IV (HR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.06-2.20, p = 0.022), atrial 
fibrillation (HR = 2.40, 95% CI 1.70-3.38, p < 0.001), albumin levels (HR = 0.41 
per 1-g/dl, 95% CI 0.30-0.57, p < 0.001), and cancer metastasis (HR = 5.28, 95% 
CI 1.86-14.9, p = 0.001) were associated with all-cause mortality after TAVI.
CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing TAVI, being female, high BMI, NYHA class 
III/IV, atrial fibrillation, albumin levels, and cancer metastasis were factors 
associated with mortality. Meanwhile, active cancer without metastasis was not 
associated with increased mortality rates. These findings would help clinical 
decision-making by patients and physicians.Clinical trial registration:

BACKGROUND: Injury poses a major threat to health and longevity in adults aged 
50 years or older. The increased life expectancy in the Eastern Mediterranean 
region warrants a further understanding of the ageing population's inevitable 
changing health demands and challenges. We aimed to examine injury-related 
morbidity and mortality among adults aged 50 years or older in 22 Eastern 
Mediterranean countries.
METHODS: Drawing on data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we categorised the population into adults aged 50-69 
years and adults aged 70 years and older. We examined estimates for transport 
injuries, self-harm injuries, and unintentional injuries for both age groups, 
with sex differences reported, and analysed the percentage changes from 1990 to 
2019. We reported injury-related mortality rates and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs). The Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and the Healthcare Access 
and Quality (HAQ) Index were used to better understand the association of 
socioeconomic factors and health-care system performance, respectively, with 
injuries and health status in older people. Healthy life expectancy (HALE) was 
compared with injury-related deaths and DALYs and to the SDI and HAQ Index to 
understand the effect of injuries on healthy ageing. Finally, risk factors for 
injury deaths between 1990 and 2019 were assessed. 95% uncertainty intervals 
(UIs) are given for all estimates.
FINDINGS: Estimated injury mortality rates in the Eastern Mediterranean region 
exceeded the global rates in 2019, with higher injury mortality rates in males 
than in females for both age groups. Transport injuries were the leading cause 
of deaths in adults aged 50-69 years (43·0 [95% UI 31·0-51·8] per 100 000 
population) and in adults aged 70 years or older (66·2 [52·5-75·5] per 100 000 
population), closely followed by conflict and terrorism for both age groups 
(10·2 [9·3-11·3] deaths per 100 000 population for 50-69 years and 45·7 
[41·5-50·3] deaths per 100 000 population for ≥70 years). The highest annual 
percentage change in mortality rates due to injury was observed in Afghanistan 
among people aged 70 years or older (400·4% increase; mortality rate 1109·7 
[1017·7-1214·7] per 100 000 population). The leading cause of DALYs was 
transport injuries for people aged 50-69 years (1798·8 [1394·1-2116·0] per 
100 000 population) and unintentional injuries for those aged 70 years or older 
(2013·2 [1682·2-2408·7] per 100 000 population). The estimates for HALE at 50 
years and at 70 years in the Eastern Mediterranean region were lower than global 
estimates. Eastern Mediterranean countries with the lowest SDIs and HAQ Index 
values had high prevalence of injury DALYs and ranked the lowest for HALE at 50 
years of age and HALE at 70 years. The leading injury mortality risk factors 
were occupational exposure in people aged 50-69 years and low bone mineral 
density in those aged 70 years or older.
INTERPRETATION: Injuries still pose a real threat to people aged 50 years or 
older living in the Eastern Mediterranean region, mainly due to transport and 
violence-related injuries. Dedicated efforts should be implemented to devise 
injury prevention strategies that are appropriate for older adults and 
cost-effective injury programmes tailored to the needs and resources of local 
health-care systems, and to curtail injury-associated risk and promote healthy 
ageing.

Chronic diseases are rising in incidence and prevalence because of increases in 
life expectancy in many parts of the world coupled with advances in medicine 
which manage disease progression, rather than curing and alleviating the causes. 
Cataract is one such chronic condition. Identifying a therapeutic intervention 
that is successful in reversing or preventing cataracts may have applications 
for other chronic diseases of protein misfolding, such as diabetes and 
Alzheimer's disease as these have similar causation factors, notably oxidative 
stress and/or glycation. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (nanoceria) which have 
antioxidant, radioprotective and enzyme-mimetic properties have the potential to 
lead to an effective non-surgical treatment. However, nanoceria stability in 
physiological media is poor thus hindering their effective use in biomedical 
applications. Here we report a highly efficient one-pot synthesis of nanoceria 
(2-5 nm) coated with ethylene glycol, that is colloidally stable in 
physiological media and exhibits multiwavelength photoluminescence. The 
formulation, up to concentrations of 200 μg ml-1, was not toxic to human lens 
epithelial cells and had no adverse effect on the cellular morphology or 
proliferation rate. More significantly, these nanoceria showed protective 
effects against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide in lens epithelial 
cells. Electron microscopy studies show the internalization and cytoplasmic 
localization of the nanoceria was found to be largely in the perinuclear region.

BACKGROUND: The obesity epidemic in the USA continues to grow nationwide. 
Although excess weight-related mortality has been studied in general, less is 
known about how it varies by demographic subgroup within the USA. In this study 
we estimated excess mortality associated with elevated body weight nationally 
and by state and subgroup.
METHODS: We developed a nationally-representative microsimulation 
(individual-level) model of US adults between 1999 and 2016, based on risk 
factor data from 6,002,012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
respondents. Prior probability distributions for hazard ratios relating 
body-mass index (BMI) to mortality were informed by a global pooling dataset. 
Individual-level mortality risks were modelled accounting for demographics, 
smoking history, and BMI adjusted for self-report bias. We calibrated the model 
to empirical all-cause mortality rates from CDC WONDER by state and subgroup, 
and assessed the predictive accuracy of the model using a random sample of data 
withheld from model fitting. We simulated counterfactual scenarios to estimate 
excess mortality attributable to different levels of excess weight and smoking 
history.
FINDINGS: We estimated that excess weight was responsible for more than 1300 
excess deaths per day (nearly 500,000 per year) and a loss in life expectancy of 
nearly 2·4 years in 2016, contributing to higher excess mortality than smoking. 
Relative excess mortality rates were nearly twice as high for women compared to 
men in 2016 (21·9% vs 13·9%), and were higher for Black non-Hispanic adults. By 
state, overall excess weight-related life expectancy loss ranged from 1·75 years 
(95% UI 1·57-1·94) in Colorado to 3·18 years (95% UI 2·86-3·51) in Mississippi.
INTERPRETATION: Excess weight has substantial impacts on mortality in the USA, 
with large disparities by state and subgroup. Premature mortality will likely 
increase as obesity continues to rise.

BACKGROUND: Currently, more than one-third of patients with drug-resistant 
temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) continue to develop seizures after resection 
surgery. Dynamic functional network connectivity (DFNC) analyses, capturing 
temporal properties of functional connectivity during MRI acquisition, may help 
us identify unfavorable surgical outcomes. The purpose of this work was to 
explore the association of DFNC variations of preoperative resting-state MRI and 
surgical outcomes in patients with drug-resistant TLE.
METHODS: We evaluated 61 patients with TLE matched for age and gender with 51 
healthy controls (HC). Patients with TLE were classified as seizure-free (n = 
39) and not seizure-free (n = 16) based on the Engel surgical outcome scale. Six 
patients were unable to confirm the postoperative status and were not included 
in the subgroup analysis. The DFNC was calculated using group spatial 
independent component analysis and the sliding window approach.
RESULTS: Dynamic functional network connectivity analyses suggested two distinct 
connectivity "States." The dynamic connectivity state of patients with TLE was 
different from HC. TLE subgroup analyses showed not seizure-free (NSF) patients 
spent significantly more time in State II compared to seizure-free (SF) patients 
and HC. Further, the number of transitions from State II to State I was 
significantly lower in NSF patients. SF patients had compensatory enhancement of 
DFNC strengths between default and dorsal attention network, as well as within 
the default network. While reduced DFNC strengths of within-network and 
inter-network were both observed in NSF patients, patients with abnormally 
temporal properties and more extension DFNC strength alterations were less 
likely to receive seizure freedom.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that DFNC could offer a better understanding of 
dynamic neural impairment mechanisms of drug-resistant TLE functional network, 
epileptic brain network reorganization, and provide an additional preoperative 
evaluation support for surgical treatment of drug-resistant TLE.

BACKGROUND: Early recognition of xeroderma pigmentosum is important to minimize 
the complications arising from the harmful effects of exposure to ultraviolet 
radiation. This narrative review aims to familiarize physicians with the 
clinical features, diagnosis and management of xeroderma pigmentosum.
METHODS: A search was conducted in December 2021 in PubMed Clinical Queries 
using the key term "xeroderma pigmentosum". The search strategy included all 
clinical trials, observational studies and reviews published within the past 10 
years. The information retrieved from the search was used in the compilation of 
this article.
RESULTS: Xeroderma pigmentosum is a condition of abnormal DNA repair of 
ultraviolet radiation-induced and oxidative DNA damage, which leads to increased 
skin cancer susceptibility. Approximately 50% of patients with xeroderma 
pigmentosum have increased photosensitivity and certain types of xeroderma 
pigmentosum are more prone to ocular disease and progressive neurodegeneration 
depending on the causative mutation. The diagnosis should be suspected in 
patients with increased photosensitivity and characteristic cutaneous, 
ophthalmological and neurological findings. A definite diagnosis can be made by 
the identification of biallelic mutation in one of the causative genes. Strict 
and consistent sun avoidance and protection and early detection and treatment of 
premalignant and malignant skin lesions are the mainstays of management. 
Treatment options for actinic keratosis include cryotherapy, topical imiquimod, 
topical 5-fluorouracil, chemical peeling, excision, CO2 laser resurfacing, 
fractional/pulsed laser therapy, and photodynamic therapy. Cutaneous malignancy 
can be treated by photodynamic therapy, curettage and electrodesiccation, or 
surgical excision. Oral isotretinoin, oral niacinamide, topical imiquimod and 
topical fluorouracil can be used for the prevention of skin malignancy. 
Treatment options for poikiloderma include chemical peeling, dermabrasion and 
laser resurfacing. Methylcellulose eyedrops and soft ultraviolet-protective 
contact lenses may be used to keep the cornea moist and protect against the 
harmful effects of keratitis sicca. Investigational therapies include the use of 
T4 endonuclease-V liposome lotion and oral nicotinamide to reduce the rate of 
actinic keratoses and non-melanoma skin cancers and gene therapy for radical 
cure of this condition.
CONCLUSION: Although currently there is no cure for xeroderma pigmentosum, 
increased awareness and early diagnosis of the condition, followed by rigorous 
sun avoidance and protection and optimal management, can dramatically improve 
the quality of life and life expectancy.

We present a proof of concept implementation of the in-memory computing paradigm 
that we use to facilitate the analysis of metagenomic sequencing reads. In doing 
so we compare the performance of POSIX™file systems and key-value storage for 
omics data, and we show the potential for integrating high-performance computing 
(HPC) and cloud native technologies. We show that in-memory key-value storage 
offers possibilities for improved handling of omics data through more flexible 
and faster data processing. We envision fully containerized workflows and their 
deployment in portable micro-pipelines with multiple instances working 
concurrently with the same distributed in-memory storage. To highlight the 
potential usage of this technology for event driven and real-time data 
processing, we use a biological case study focused on the growing threat of 
antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We develop a workflow encompassing 
bioinformatics and explainable machine learning (ML) to predict life expectancy 
of a population based on the microbiome of its sewage while providing a 
description of AMR contribution to the prediction. We propose that in future, 
performing such analyses in 'real-time' would allow us to assess the potential 
risk to the population based on changes in the AMR profile of the community.

INTRODUCTION: Recent technological innovations in haemophilia have advanced at 
an astounding pace, including gene therapy programmes and bioengineered 
molecules for prophylaxis, products that reduce treatment burden through 
half-life extension, unique mechanisms of action, and subcutaneous 
administration. Additional technological advancements have emerged that are 
anticipated to further transform haemophilia care.
AIM: Review new and emerging haemophilia therapies, including replacement and 
bypassing products, digital applications, utilisation of big data, and 
personalised medicine.
METHODS: Data were obtained from peer-reviewed presentations/publications, and 
ongoing studies in haemophilia, ultrasonography, and artificial intelligence 
(AI).
RESULTS: Available treatments include new recombinant factors VIII (FVIII) and 
IX (FIX), extended half-life FVIII/IX products, a new FVIIa product for 
inhibitor patients, and a FVIIIa-mimetic. Several novel therapeutics are in 
clinical trials, including FVIIIa mimetics and inhibitors of naturally-occurring 
anticoagulants. Ongoing gene therapy trials suggest that a single vector 
infusion using an optimised construct can produce factor activity that reduces 
bleeding to near zero for years. Today, persons with haemophilia (PwH) approach 
a lifespan comparable to that of the general population, presenting treatment 
challenges for age-related co-morbidities. Technological innovations have 
broadened beyond therapeutics to include large database analyses utilising 
remote data collection with handheld devices, and to tailor AI applications. 
Current development efforts include patient-performed ultrasonography, 
algorithms for scan interpretation, and point-of-care haemostatic testing 
devices.
CONCLUSIONS: We have entered a golden age for haemophilia treatment and care 
with wide-ranging advancements targeting improved quality of life (QoL). 
Future-focused efforts by clinical and patient communities may provide equitable 
access and care for people impacted by haemophilia worldwide.

Expansion, Compression, Neither, Both? Divergent Patterns in Healthy, 
Disability-Free, and Morbidity-Free Life Expectancy Across U.S. Birth Cohorts, 
1998-2016.

National University, Canberra, Australia.

This article explores how patterns of health, morbidity, and disability have 
changed across successive generations of older adults in the United States. 
Using a novel method for comparing state-specific partial life expectancies-that 
is, total life expectancy (LE), and health expectancies (HEs) in different 
health states, bounded between two ages-I explore changes in healthy life 
expectancy across successive birth cohorts of the U.S. population. Results show 
that little compression of disability is occurring across cohorts, LE with 
chronic morbidities has expanded considerably, and self-rated health is 
improving across cohorts, but only at ages 70+. These findings suggest that 
successive cohorts in the U.S. population may be on divergent paths in terms of 
late-life health and well-being. Exploring heterogeneity in these patterns, I 
find that less educated individuals have substantially lower partial LE and 
disability-free LE than those with more schooling, and that disability-free life 
is declining among those with less than a high school diploma. Differences in 
HEs are pervasive across racial and ethnic groups, and both disabled LE and 
unhealthy LE are expanding in some disadvantaged subgroups. The continued 
increases in partial LE with morbidities across successive cohorts, and the 
broad stagnation of disability-free and healthy LE, present a broad view of a 
U.S. population in which successive generations are not living healthier lives.

OBJECTIVES: With modern combination antiretroviral Treatment (cART) a normal 
life expectancy among people living with HIV (PLWH) has become reality if 
started early enough prior to the onset of more pronounced immunodeficiency. 
Therefore, prevention measures against other infectious diseases among this 
vulnerable group have gained increased attention. Indeed, the EACS guidelines 
recommend vaccinations against HAV, HBV, HPV, Influenza, Neisseria meningitidis, 
Streptococcus pneumoniae and VZV in HIV-infected adults.
METHODS: All PLWH under cART attending our ID outpatient clinic between April to 
June 2018, were assessed during consultation for vaccination status regarding 
pneumococcus, Hepatitis A and B, influenza, varicella, meningococcus and HPV 
using a pre-defined questionnaire, vaccination certificates and medical records. 
In addition, the cohort database was screened for Hepatitis A and B serology and 
HIV surrogate markers.
RESULTS: A total of 305 PLWH (82.3% male, 17.7% female) was included, median age 
was 48 years (IQR 47-51). Median CD4 + T cell count was 543 (IQR 304-770), and 
for 297 (97.4%) PLWH CD4 + T cell count was ≥ 200/ul. The viral load was 
undetectable (< 40 copies/ml) in 289 (94.8%) cases. Highest vaccination rates 
were observed for HAV (87.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (77.4%) and Influenza 
(76.5%). 64.3% PLWH got vaccinated against HBV, whereas VZV vaccination only 
played a minor role, in the context of the high rate of cleared infections 
(99.0%). Lowest vaccination rates were detected for HPV (0%) and Neisseria 
meningitidis (3.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that vaccination rates among PLWH are higher 
compared to the general German population. Implementation of EACS guidelines 
into daily routine though is not fully executed and the need for improving 
vaccination rates has to be emphasized. Centrally organized vaccination 
registers as well as electronic medical records could be helpful tools to detect 
a lack of vaccination coverage and send digital vaccination reminders 
particularly among risk groups.

FRANKLIN, BERLIN, GERMANY.

OBJECTIVE: The aim: The present study aimed to evaluate the adherence to 
medications prior and within a two-year period after ST-segment elevation 
myocardial infarction (STEMI) and to estimate its impact on the average lifespan 
of patients after STEMI.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 1,103 patients with STEMI were 
enrolled in the prospective Ukrainian STIMUL registry with 24-month follow-up. 
The relationship between adherence to medical treatment and average lifespan was 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Results: The majority of prior STEMI patients were characterized with 
high and very high cardiovascular risk. The rate of revascularization was 29.9% 
(21.5% pPCI, 8.4% fibrinolytic therapy). The main reason for the low level of 
pPCI was late hospitalization and the inaccessibility of pPCI. This contributed 
greatly to in-hospital mortality (11.3%). Adherence to all medications 
progressively decreased (p < 0.001) within 24 months after STEMI. Permanent use 
of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and statins during the two-year follow-up was 
associated with 7.0% of the mortalities, whereas non-adherence to medications 
was related to a 15% risk of death (OR 4.2; 95% CI 0.2-0.9; p < 0.05). The 
average life expectancy with regular use of ASA and statins within 24 months 
after STEMI was 62.3 ± 1.1 years (95% CI 60.1-64.4; p < 0.05) and 61.2 ± 0.9 
years with non-regular use of ASA and statins (95% CI 59.4-62.9; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Adherence to evidence-based medicines was low in the 
STIMUL population both prior and after STEMI. This worsened cardiovascular 
prognosis and reduced average lifespan by one year within the following two 
years after STEMI.

The diagnosis of brain metastases has historically been a dreaded, end-stage 
complication of systemic disease. Additionally, with the increasing 
effectiveness of systemic therapies that prolong life expectancy and improved 
imaging tools, the incidence of intracranial progression is becoming more 
common. Within this context, there has been increasing attention directed at 
understanding the molecular underpinnings of intracranial progression. Exploring 
the unique features of brain metastases compared with their extracranial 
counterparts to identify aberrant signaling pathways, which can be targeted 
pharmacologically, may help lead to new treatments for this patient population. 
Additionally, critical discoveries outside the sphere of the central nervous 
system are increasingly being applied to brain metastases with the emergence of 
immune checkpoint inhibition, becoming a prevalent treatment option for patients 
with brain metastases across multiple histologies. As novel treatment strategies 
are considered, they require thoughtful incorporation of agents that can cross 
the blood-brain barrier and can synergize with pre-existing agents through 
rational combinations. Lastly, as clinicians and scientists continue to 
understand key molecular features of these tumors, they will continue to 
influence the treatment algorithms that are developing for the management of 
these patients. Due to the complexity of treatment decisions for patients with 
brain metastases, an emerging tool is the utilization of multidisciplinary brain 
metastasis tumor boards to ensure optimal treatment decisions are made and that 
patients are provided access to applicable clinical trials. Looking to the 
future, the collective effort to understand the various tumor-intrinsic and 
tumor-extrinsic factors that promote central nervous system seeding and 
propagation will have the potential to change the clinical trajectory for these 
patients.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made decisions about resource allocation and 
reallocation real possibilities even in high-resource settings. In April 2020, 
in preparation for such an eventuality, Atlantic Health System began to develop 
a real-time instrument built into the EMR to assist with such decisions. The 
instrument calculated the modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment for all 
patients admitted, in real time, to assist triage teams make decisions if crisis 
standards of care were declared. A pilot assessment of the instrument was 
performed using retrospective data by nine members of the triage teams, who were 
asked to identify the six patients at highest risk of reallocation. Agreement 
about which patients were at highest risk of resource reallocation was good, but 
not perfect. All raters agreed on five of the six patients, but only seven of 
nine agreed on the final patient. Among the six consensus selections for 
reallocation, five died prior to hospital discharge. All patients at highest 
risk of reallocation had a predicted life expectancy of less than 1 year. In 
conclusion, the instrument was easy to use, and the concordance among raters was 
good but not perfect. Predicted life expectance was a major determinant of the 
triage score.

Modest drinking has been repeatedly discussed in scientific papers as protective 
against certain diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, but in most cases, 
alcohol worsens health conditions, especially when consumed at high risk levels. 
The complexity of the risk relationship between alcohol and health conditions 
has confused clinicians as to whether it should be recommended. The study aims 
to balance the risks and benefits of modest drinking. This retrospective cohort 
study of 430,016 adults recruited from a standard health-screening program since 
1994, with 11,031 deaths identified as of 2008. Drinking distinguished "modest 
drinker" (no more than one drink a day) from "regular drinker". Mortality risks 
including all-cause mortality and diseases-specific mortality with hazard ratio 
(HR) were calculated by adjusting for 15 confounders. Life table was used for 
life expectancy. Risk predictors were subjected to Cox proportional hazards 
regression analysis to identify significant predictors in multivariate models 
and life expectancy analysis. Nearly one out of 4 males (23%) was a modest 
drinker, who gained 0.94 year (95% CI 0.65-1.23 year) in life over non-drinker 
and had 8% reduction in adjusted all-cause mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 
0.86-0.97). In contrast, regular drinkers had 43% increase in overall mortality 
(HR 1.43, CI 1.35-1.52) and shortened life by 6.9 years (95% CI 6.6-7.1 years). 
As most drinkers also smoked, 59% in modest and 75% in regular, the combined 
effect shortened life by 2.0 years (95% CI 1.6-2.4 years) in modest drinker and 
10.3 years (95% CI 9.8-10.7 years) in regular drinker. Cancer were increased in 
modest drinkers for oral (HR 2.35, CI 1.38-4.01) and esophageal (HR 3.83, CI 
1.90-7.73) cancer. The gain of one year by modest drinkers was erased by a two 
to fourfold increase in oral and esophageal cancer and that drinking beyond 
modest amount led to a large loss of life expectancy. Given that drinkers are 
prone to cross the line of drinking, clinicians should balance the risks and 
benefits of drinking, as well as the understanding of whether the patient is at 
risk for addiction.
