BACKGROUND: the APICE study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of nanoparticle 
albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel - Nab-P) + gemcitabine (G) vs G alone 
in metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC) from the Italian National Health Service 
(INHS) standpoint.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 4-year, 4 health states (progression-free; 
progressed; end of life; death) Markov model based on the MPACT trial was 
developed to estimate costs (Euro [€], 2017 values), and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs). Patients were assumed to receive intravenously Nab-P 
125 mg/m2 + G 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks or G alone 
1000 mg/m2 weekly for 7 out of 8 weeks (cycle 1) and then on days 1, 8, and 15 
every 4 weeks (cycle 2 and subsequent cycles) until progression. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored the uncertainty surrounding the 
baseline incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR).
RESULTS: Nab-P + G totals 0.154 incremental QALYs and €7082.68 incremental costs 
vs G alone. ICUR (€46,021.58) is lower than the informal threshold value of 
€87,330 adopted by the Italian Medicines Agency during 2010-2013 for reimbursing 
oncological drugs. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the baseline 
findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Nab-P + G in MPC patients can be considered cost-effective for the 
INHS.

Probiotics, including Enterococcus faecium, confer a health benefit on the host. 
An Enterococcus strain was isolated from healthy chicken cecum, identified as E. 
faecium by 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis, and designated as E. faecium L11. To 
evaluate the potential of E. faecium L11 as a probiotic, the gastrointestinal 
tolerance, immunomodulatory activity, and lifespan extension properties of the 
strain were assayed. E. faecium L11 showed >66% and >62% survival in artificial 
gastric juice (0.3% pepsin, pH 2.5) and simulated small intestinal juice (0.5% 
bile salt and 0.1% pancreatin), respectively. Heat-killed E. faecium L11 
significantly (p < 0.05) increased immune cell proliferation compared with 
controls, and stimulated the production of cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) by 
activated macrophages obtained from ICR mice. In addition, E. faecium L11 showed 
a protective effect against Salmonella Typhimurium infection in Caenorhabditis 
elegans. In addition, feeding E. faecium L11 significantly (p < 0.05) extended 
the lifespan of C. elegans compared with the control. Furthermore, genes related 
to aging and host defense were upregulated in E. faecium L11-fed worms. In 
conclusion, E. faecium L11, which prolongs the lifespan of C. elegans, may be a 
potent probiotic supplement for livestock.

Glioblastoma is the most common, malignant primary tumor of the central nervous 
system. The average prognosis for life expectancy after diagnosis, with the 
triad of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, is less than 1.5 years. 
Chemotherapy treatment is mostly limited to temozolomide. In this paper, the 
authors review an emerging, novel drug called acid ceramidase, which targets 
glioblastoma. Its role in cancer treatment in general, and more specifically, in 
the treatment of glioblastoma, are discussed. In addition, the authors provide 
insights on acid ceramidase as a potential druggable target for glioblastoma.

Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Africa. 
Although research documents the magnitude and pattern of diarrheal diseases are 
associated with weather in particular locations, there is limited quantification 
of this association in sub-Saharan Africa and no studies conducted in 
Mozambique. Our study aimed to determine whether variation in diarrheal disease 
was associated with precipitation in Mozambique. In secondary analyses we 
investigated the associations between temperature and diarrheal disease. We 
obtained weekly time series data for weather and diarrheal disease aggregated at 
the administrative district level for 1997-2014. Weather data include modeled 
estimates of precipitation and temperature. Diarrheal disease counts are 
confirmed clinical episodes reported to the Mozambique Ministry of Health (n = 
7,315,738). We estimated the association between disease counts and 
precipitation, defined as the number of wet days (precipitation > 1 mm) per 
week, for the entire country and for Mozambique's four regions. We conducted 
time series regression analyses using an unconstrained distributed lag Poisson 
model adjusted for time, maximum temperature, and district. Temperature was 
similarly estimated with adjusted covariates. Using a four-week lag, chosen a 
priori, precipitation was associated with diarrheal disease. One additional wet 
day per week was associated with a 1.86% (95% CI: 1.05-2.67%), 1.37% (95% CI: 
0.70-2.04%), 2.09% (95% CI: 1.01-3.18%), and 0.63% (95% CI: 0.11-1.14%) increase 
in diarrheal disease in Mozambique's northern, central, southern, and coastal 
regions, respectively. Our study indicates a strong association between 
diarrheal disease and precipitation. Diarrheal disease prevention efforts should 
target areas forecast to experience increased rainfall. The burden of diarrheal 
disease may increase with increased precipitation associated with climate 
change, unless additional health system interventions are undertaken.

Later chronotype (i.e. evening preference) and later timing of sleep have been 
associated with greater morbidity, including higher rates of metabolic 
dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, no one has examined 
whether chronotype is associated with mortality risk to date. Our objective was 
to test the hypothesis that being an evening type is associated with increased 
mortality in a large cohort study, the UK Biobank. Our analysis included 433 268 
adults aged 38-73 at the time of enrolment and an average 6.5-year follow-up. 
The primary exposure was chronotype, as assessed through a single self-reported 
question-defining participants as definite morning types, moderate morning 
types, moderate evening types or definite evening types. The primary outcomes 
were all-cause mortality and mortality due to CVD. Prevalent disease was also 
compared among the chronotype groups. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, 
ethnicity, smoking, body mass index, sleep duration, socioeconomic status and 
comorbidities. Greater eveningness, particularly being a definite evening type, 
was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of all comorbidities. 
Comparing definite evening type to definite morning type, the associations were 
strongest for psychological disorders (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.86-2.02, p = < 0.001), 
followed by diabetes (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.24-1.36, p = < 0.001), neurological 
disorders (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.20-1.30, p = < 0.001), gastrointestinal/abdominal 
disorders (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.19-1.27, p = < 0.001) and respiratory disorders (OR 
1.22, 95% CI 1.18-1.26, p = < 0.001). The total number of deaths was 10 534, out 
of which 2127 were due to CVD. Greater eveningness, based on chronotype as an 
ordinal variable, was associated with a small increased risk of all-cause 
mortality (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.004-1.05, p = 0.017) and CVD mortality (HR 1.04, 
95% CI 1.00-1.09, p = 0.06). Compared to definite morning types, definite 
evening types had significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.10, 
95% CI 1.02-1.18, p = 0.012). This first report of increased mortality in 
evening types is consistent with previous reports of increased levels of 
cardiometabolic risk factors in this group. Mortality risk in evening types may 
be due to behavioural, psychological and physiological risk factors, many of 
which may be attributable to chronic misalignment between internal physiological 
timing and externally imposed timing of work and social activities. These 
findings suggest the need for researching possible interventions aimed at either 
modifying circadian rhythms in individuals or at allowing evening types greater 
working hour flexibility.

BACKGROUND: The OptiBIRTH study incorporates a multicentre cluster randomised 
trial in 15 hospital sites across three European countries. The trial was 
designed to test a complex intervention aimed at improving vaginal birth after 
caesarean section (VBAC) rates through increasing women's involvement in their 
care. Prior to developing a robust standardised model to conduct the health 
economic analysis, an analysis of a hypothetical cohort was performed to 
estimate the costs and health effects of VBAC compared to elective repeat 
caesarean delivery (ERCD) for low-risk women in four European countries.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the costs and the 
health effects, measured using Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), of VBAC 
compared with ERCD. A cost-effectiveness analysis for the period from 
confirmation of pregnancy to 6 weeks postpartum was performed for short-term 
consequences and during lifetime for long-term consequences, based on a 
hypothetical cohort of 100,000 pregnant women in each of four different 
countries; Belgium, Germany, Ireland and Italy. A societal perspective was 
adopted. Where possible, transition probabilities, costs and health effects were 
adapted from national data obtained from the respective countries. 
Country-specific thresholds were used to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
VBAC compared to ERCD. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to examine the uncertainty of model assumptions.
RESULTS: Within a 6-week time horizon, VBAC resulted in a reduction in costs, 
ranging from €3,334,052 (Germany) to €66,162,379 (Ireland), and gains in QALYs 
ranging from 6399 (Italy) to 7561 (Germany) per 100,000 women birthing in each 
country. Compared to ERCD, VBAC is the dominant strategy in all four countries. 
Applying a lifetime horizon, VBAC is dominant compared to ERCD in all countries 
except for Germany (probabilistic analysis, ICER: €8609/QALY). In conclusion, 
compared to ERCD, VBAC remains cost-effective when using a lifetime time.
CONCLUSIONS: In all four countries, VBAC was cost-effective compared to ERCD for 
low-risk women. This is important for health service managers, economists and 
policy makers concerned with maximising health benefits within limited and 
constrained resources.

BACKGROUND: Healthy life expectancy (HALE) at birth is an important indicator of 
health status and quality of life of a country's population. However, little is 
known about the determinants of HALE as yet globally or even country-specific 
level. Thus, we examined the factors that are associated with HALE at birth in 
low- and lower-middle-income countries.
METHODS: In accordance with the World Bank (WB) classification seventy-nine low- 
and lower-middle-income countries were selected for the study. Data on HALE, 
demographic, socioeconomic, social structural, health, and environmental factors 
from several reliable sources, such as the World Health Organization, the United 
Nations Development Program, Population Reference Bureau, WB, Heritage 
Foundation, Transparency International, Freedom House, and International Center 
for Prison Studies were obtained as selected countries. Descriptive statistics, 
correlation analysis, and regression analysis were performed to reach the 
research objectives.
RESULTS: The lowest and highest HALE were observed in Sierra Leone (44.40 years) 
and in Sri Lanka (67.00 years), respectively. The mean years of schooling, total 
fertility rate (TFR), physician density, gross national income per capita, 
health expenditure, economic freedom, carbon dioxide emission rate, freedom of 
the press, corruption perceptions index, prison population rate, and achieving a 
level of health-related millennium development goals (MDGs) were revealed as the 
correlates of HALE. Among all the correlates, the mean years of schooling, TFR, 
freedom of the press, and achieving a level of health-related MDGs were found to 
be the most influential factors.
CONCLUSION: To increase the HALE in low- and lower-middle-income countries, we 
suggest that TFR is to be reduced as well as to increase the mean years of 
schooling, freedom of the press, and the achievement of a level of 
health-related MDGs.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of an enhanced transtheoretical 
model of behaviour change in conjunction with physiotherapy compared with 
standard care (physiotherapy) in patients with chronic lower back pain (CLBP).
DESIGN: Cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses alongside a multicentre 
controlled trial from a healthcare perspective with a 1-year time horizon.
SETTING: The trial was conducted in eight centres within the Sharon district in 
Israel.
PARTICIPANTS: 220 participants aged between 25 and 55 years who suffered from 
CLBP for a minimum of 3 months were recruited.
INTERVENTIONS: The intervention used a model of behaviour change that sought to 
increase the adherence and implementation of physical activity in conjunction 
with physiotherapy. The control arm received standard care in the form of 
physiotherapy.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of the intervention arm compared with standard 
care. The secondary outcome was the incremental cost per Roland-Morris 
Disability Questionnaire point.
RESULTS: The cost per QALY point estimate was 10 645 New Israeli shekels (NIS) 
(£1737.11). There was an 88% chance the intervention was cost-effective at 
NIS50 000 per QALY threshold. Excluding training costs, the intervention 
dominated the control arm, resulting in fewer physiotherapy and physician visits 
while improving outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced transtheoretical model intervention appears to be a 
very cost-effective intervention leading to improved outcomes for low cost. 
Given limitations within this study, there is justification for examining the 
intervention within a larger, long-term randomised controlled trial.

filamentous networks by extending at their tips while branching in subapical 
regions. Rapid tip elongation requires massive membrane insertion and extension 
of the rigid chitin-containing cell wall. This process is sustained by a 
continuous flow of secretory vesicles that depends on the coordinated action of 
the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons and the corresponding motors and 
associated proteins. Vesicles transport cell wall-synthesizing enzymes and 
accumulate in a special structure, the Spitzenkörper, before traveling further 
and fusing with the tip membrane. The place of vesicle fusion and growth 
direction are enabled and defined by the position of the Spitzenkörper, the 
so-called cell end markers, and other proteins involved in the exocytic process. 
Also important for tip extension is membrane recycling by endocytosis via early 
endosomes, which function as multipurpose transport vehicles for mRNA, septins, 
ribosomes, and peroxisomes. Cell integrity, hyphal branching, and morphogenesis 
are all processes that are largely dependent on vesicle and cytoskeleton 
dynamics. When hyphae differentiate structures for asexual or sexual 
reproduction or to mediate interspecies interactions, the hyphal basic cellular 
machinery may be reprogrammed through the synthesis of new proteins and/or the 
modification of protein activity. Although some transcriptional networks 
involved in such reprogramming of hyphae are well studied in several model 
filamentous fungi, clear connections between these networks and known 
determinants of hyphal morphogenesis are yet to be established.

Therapeutic peptides and diagnostic agents with their molecular size below the 
renal clearance threshold suffer from short blood circulation time. Here, we 
report a novel design of peptide-based ligand with a strong binding affinity to 
human serum albumin (HSA), which can be used as a tag to extend the blood 
circulation of small-size molecules. We designed ligands with dual alkyl groups 
connected with a negatively charged spacer. The ligands showed both higher 
binding affinity to HSA and a higher retention in mice blood than that of a 
single alkylated peptide.

Air pollution has been estimated to be one of the leading environmental health 
risks in Finland. National health impact estimates existing to date have focused 
on particles (PM) and ozone (O₃). In this work, we quantify the impacts of 
particles, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) in 2015, and analyze the related 
uncertainties. The exposures were estimated with a high spatial resolution 
chemical transport model, and adjusted to observed concentrations. We calculated 
the health impacts according to Word Health Organization (WHO) working group 
recommendations. According to our results, ambient air pollution caused a burden 
of 34,800 disability-adjusted life years (DALY). Fine particles were the main 
contributor (74%) to the disease burden, which is in line with the earlier 
studies. The attributable burden was dominated by mortality (32,900 years of 
life lost (YLL); 95%). Impacts differed between population age groups. The 
burden was clearly higher in the adult population over 30 years (98%), due to 
the dominant role of mortality impacts. Uncertainties due to the 
concentration-response functions were larger than those related to exposures.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to illustrate the characteristics of 
patients with palliative care (PC) needs, early identified by general 
practitioners (GPs), and to analyze their care process in home PC services.
BACKGROUND: Early identification and service integration are key components to 
providing quality palliative care (PC) services ensuring the best possible 
service for patients and their families. However, in Italy, PC is often provided 
only in the last phase of life and for oncological patients, with a fragmented 
service.
METHODS: Multicenter prospective observational study, lasting in total 18 
months, implemented in a sample of Italian Home Palliative Care Units (HPCUs), 
enrolling and monitoring patients with limited life expectancy, early identified 
by 94 GPs. The study began on March 1, 2014 and ended on August 31, 2015.
RESULTS: Nine hundred thirty-seven patients, out of a total pool of 139,071, 
were identified by GPs as having a low life expectancy and PC needs. Of these, 
556 (59.3%) were nononcological patients. The GPs sent 433 patients to the HPCUs 
for multidimensional assessment, and 328 (75.8%) were placed in the care of both 
settings (basic or specialist). For all patients included in the study, both 
oncological and nononcological patients, there was a high rate of death at home, 
around 70%.
DISCUSSION: This study highlights how a model based on early identification, 
multidimensional evaluation, and integration of services can promote adequate 
PC, also for noncancer patients, with a population-based approach.

INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic antireflux surgery and medical therapy with proton 
pump inhibitors are gold standards of gastroesophageal reflux treatment. On 
account of limited resources and increasing healthcare needs and costs, in this 
analysis, not only optimal medical results, but also superiority in health 
economics of these 2 methods are evaluated.
METHODS: We performed an electronic literature survey in MEDLINE, PubMed, 
Cochrane Library, ISRCTN (International Standard Randomization Controlled Trial 
Number) as well as in the NHS Economic Evaluation Database, including studies 
published until 1/2017. Only studies considering the effect size of QALY 
(Quality-Adjusted Life Years) (with respect to different quality of life-scores) 
as primary outcome comparing laparoscopic fundoplication and medical therapy 
were included. Criteria of comparison were ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness 
Ratio) and ICUR (Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio). Superiority of the respective 
treatment option for each publication was worked out.
RESULTS: In total, 18 comparative studies were identified in the current 
literature with respect to above-mentioned search terms, qualifying for the 
defined inclusion criteria. Six studies were finally selected for analyses. Out 
of 6 publications, 3 showed superiority of laparoscopic fundoplication over 
long-term medical management based on current cost-effectiveness data. 
Limitations were related to different time intervals, levels of evidence of 
studies and underlying resources/costs of analyses, healthcare systems and 
applied quality of life instruments.
CONCLUSION: Future prospective, randomized trials should examine this comparison 
in greater detail. Additionally, there is a large potential for further research 
in the health economics assessment of early diagnosis and prevention measures of 
reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus/carcinoma.

Publisher: EINLEITUNG: Die laparaskopische Antirefluxplastik und die 
medikamentöse Therapie mit Säureblockern sind Goldstandard der Therapie der 
gastroösophagealen Refluxerkrankung. Aufgrund begrenzter Ressourcen bei 
gleichzeitig steigenden Gesundheitsbedürfnissen und -kosten sollen in der 
vorliegenden Arbeit beide Methoden nicht nur hinsichtlich des medizinisch besten 
Resultats, sondern auch in Bezug auf ihre gesundheitsökonomische Überlegenheit 
untersucht werden.
METHODIK: Es erfolgte eine elektronische Literaturanalyse in den Datenbanken 
MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, ISRCTN (International Standard Randomization 
Controlled Trial Number) sowie in der NHS Economic Evaluation Database bis 
01/2017. Eingeschlossen wurden nur Studien, welche als Zielparameter die 
Effektgrößen QALY (=Quality-Adjusted Life Years) (unter Berücksichtigung 
verschiedener Lebensqualitäts-Scores) im Vergleich von laparoskopischer 
Fundoplikatio und medikamentöser Therapie umfassten. Kriterien, anhand derer die 
Studien gegenübergestellt und verglichen wurden, waren die Effektgrößen QALY 
(Quality-Adjusted Life Years) bzw. daraus resultierend ICER (Incremental 
Cost-Effectiveness Ratio=inkrementelle Kosten-Effektivitäts-Relation)/ICUR 
(Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio=inkrementelle Kosten-Nutzen-Relation). Je 
inkludierter Publikation wurde anhand dieser Parameter die Superiorität des 
jeweiligen Verfahrens herausgearbeitet.
RESULTATE: Es konnten insgesamt 18 vergleichende Studien in der aktuellen 
Literatur zu o. g. Suchbegriffen identifiziert werden, die die definierten 
Einschlußkriterien erfüllten. 6 Studien konnten final in unsere Analysen 
eingeschlossen werden. Es zeigt sich bei 3 der 6 analysierten Publikationen eine 
bessere Kosteneffektivität zugunsten der laparoskopischen Fundoplikatio. 
Limitationen sind aufgrund unterschiedlicher Zeithorizonte, Evidenzlevel der 
Studien und zugrundeliegender Ressourcen/Kosten der Analysen, verschiedener 
Gesundheitssysteme und angewandter Lebensqualitäts-Instrumente gegeben.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Künftige prospektiv-randomisierte Studien müssen diesen 
Vergleich noch ausführlicher untersuchen. Zudem findet sich ein großes Potenzial 
für weitere Studien in der gesundheitsökonomischen Beurteilung von 
Früherkennungs- und Präventionsmaßnahmen der Refluxerkrankung bzw. des 
Barrett-Ösophagus und -Karzinoms.

Life expectancy inequalities in the elderly by socioeconomic status: evidence 
from Italy.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy considerably increased in most developed countries 
during the twentieth century. However, the increase in longevity is neither 
uniform nor random across individuals belonging to various socioeconomic groups. 
From an economic policy perspective, the difference in mortality by 
socioeconomic conditions challenges the fairness of the social security systems. 
We focus on the case of Italy and aim at measuring differences in longevity at 
older ages by individuals belonging to different socioeconomic groups, also in 
order to assess the effective fairness of the Italian public pension system, 
which is based on a notional defined contribution (NDC) benefit computation 
formula, whose rules do not take into account individual heterogeneity in 
expected longevity.
METHODS: We use a longitudinal dataset that matches survey data on individual 
features recorded in the Italian module of the EU-SILC, with information on the 
whole working life and until death collected in the administrative archives 
managed by the Italian National Social Security Institute. In more detail, we 
follow until 2009 a sample of 11,281 individuals aged at least 60 in 2005. We 
use survival analysis and measure the influence of a number of events 
experienced in the labor market and individual characteristics on mortality. 
Furthermore, through Kaplan-Meier simulations of hypothetical social groups, 
adjusted by a Brass relational model, we estimate and compare differences in 
life expectancy of individuals belonging to different socioeconomic groups.
RESULTS: Our findings confirm that socioeconomic status strongly predicts life 
expectancy even in old age. All estimated models show that the prevalent type of 
working activity before retirement is significantly associated with the risk of 
death, even when controlling for dozens of variables as proxies of individual 
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The risk of death for 
self-employed individuals is 26% lower than that of employees, and life 
expectancy at 60 differs by five years between individuals with opposite 
socioeconomic statuses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first that links results based on a micro survival 
analysis on subgroups of the elderly population with results related to the 
entire Italian population. The extreme differences in mortality risks by 
socioeconomic status found in our study confirm the existence of large health 
inequalities and strongly question the fairness of the Italian public pension 
system.

Rabies is a fatal disease of all mammals causing almost 60,000 human deaths 
every year. To date, there is no effective treatment of clinical rabies once the 
symptoms appear. Here, we describe the promising effect of combination therapy 
composed of molecules that target replication of the rabies virus (RV) at 
different stages of life cycle and molecules that inhibit some pathways of the 
innate host immune response accompanied by a blood-brain barrier opener on the 
outcome of RV infection. The study reports statistically significant extension 
of survival of mice treated with the drug cocktail containing T-705, ribavirin, 
interferon α/β, caspase-1 inhibitor, TNF-α inhibitor, MAPKs inhibitor and HRIG 
compared to the survival of mice in the virus control group (p = 0.0312). 
Furthermore, the study points to the significant impact of interferon α/β on the 
survival of RV-infected mice. We have shown a significant down regulation of 
pro-inflammatory molecules (caspase-1 and TNF-a) in the CNS in RV-infected mice 
treated with a combination of drugs including interferon α/β.

BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether testing for novel risk factors, such as a 
cardiovascular genetic risk score (cGRS), improves clinical decision making or 
health outcomes when used for targeting statin initiation in the primary 
prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Our objective was 
to estimate the cost-effectiveness of cGRS testing to inform clinical decision 
making about statin initiation in individuals with low-to-intermediate 
(2.5%-7.5%) 10-year predicted risk of ASCVD.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of testing for a 
27-single-nucleotide polymorphism cGRS comparing 4 test/treat strategies: treat 
all, treat none, test/treat if cGRS is high, and test/treat if cGRS is 
intermediate or high. We tested a set of clinical scenarios of men and women, 
aged 45 to 65 years, with 10-year ASCVD risks between 2.5% and 7.5%. Our primary 
outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Under base case 
assumptions for statin disutility and cost, the preferred strategy is to treat 
all patients with ASCVD risk >2.5% without cGRS testing. For certain clinical 
scenarios, such as a 57-year-old man with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5%, cGRS 
testing can be cost-effective under a limited set of assumptions; for example, 
when statins cost $15 per month and statin disutility is 0.013 (ie, willing to 
trade 3 months of life in perfect health to avoid 20 years of statin therapy), 
the preferred strategy (using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained) is to test and treat if cGRS is intermediate 
or high. Overall, the results were not sensitive to assumptions about statin 
efficacy and harms.
CONCLUSIONS: Testing for a 27-single-nucleotide polymorphism cGRS is generally 
not a cost-effective approach for targeting statin therapy in the primary 
prevention of ASCVD for low- to intermediate-risk patients.

The Earth Observing One (EO-1) satellite has completed 16 years of Earth 
observations in early 2017. What started as a technology mission to test various 
new advancements turned into a science and application mission that extended 
many years beyond the satellite's planned life expectancy. EO-1's primary 
instruments are spectral imagers: Hyperion, the only civilian full spectrum 
spectrometer (430-2400 nm) in orbit; and the Advanced Land Imager (ALI), the 
prototype for Landsat-8's pushbroom imaging technology. Both Hyperion and ALI 
instruments have continued to perform well, but in February 2011 the satellite 
ran out of the fuel necessary to maintain orbit, which initiated a change in 
precession rate that led to increasingly earlier equatorial crossing times 
during its last five years. The change from EO-1's original orbit, when it was 
formation flying with Landsat-7 at a 10:01am equatorial overpass time, to 
earlier overpass times results in image acquisitions with increasing solar 
zenith angles (SZAs). In this study, we take several approaches to characterize 
data quality as SZAs increased. Our results show that for both EO-1 sensors, 
atmospherically corrected reflectance products are within 5 to 10% of mean 
pre-drift products. No marked trend in decreasing quality in ALI or Hyperion is 
apparent through 2016, and these data remain a high quality resource through the 
end of the mission.

BACKGROUND: No drug treatments are currently licensed for the treatment of 
borderline personality disorder (BPD). Despite this, people with this condition 
are frequently prescribed psychotropic medications and often with considerable 
polypharmacy. Preliminary studies have indicated that mood stabilisers may be of 
benefit to people with BPD.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
lamotrigine for people with BPD.
DESIGN: A two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled individually randomised 
trial of lamotrigine versus placebo. Participants were randomised via an 
independent and remote web-based service using permuted blocks and stratified by 
study centre, the severity of personality disorder and the extent of hypomanic 
symptoms.
SETTING: Secondary care NHS mental health services in six centres in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Potential participants had to be aged ≥ 18 years, meet diagnostic 
criteria for BPD and provide written informed consent. We excluded people with 
coexisting psychosis or bipolar affective disorder, those already taking a mood 
stabiliser, those who spoke insufficient English to complete the baseline 
assessment and women who were pregnant or contemplating becoming pregnant.
INTERVENTIONS: Up to 200 mg of lamotrigine per day or an inert placebo. Women 
taking combined oral contraceptives were prescribed up to 400 mg of trial 
medication per day.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were assessed at 12, 24 and 52 weeks after 
randomisation. The primary outcome was the total score on the Zanarini Rating 
Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD) at 52 weeks. The secondary 
outcomes were depressive symptoms, deliberate self-harm, social functioning,
