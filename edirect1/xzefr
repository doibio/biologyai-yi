FDC groups had the lowest AMH, compared to the other groups, but there was no 
statistically significant difference in AMH across the groups. The mean count of 
antral follicles was significantly lower in the group that received EFV when 
compared to the other groups. The corpus luteal count was significantly higher 
in the control group than in the intervention groups.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated a disruption in the reproductive hormones of 
female Wistar rats receiving anti-retroviral regimens containing EFV. Clinical 
studies are required to determine if these changes are seen in women receiving 
EFV-based treatment, as this may compromise reproductive function and predispose 
them to early menopause.

Patient-led advocacy organizations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK)-positive lung cancer space are becoming increasingly influential. ALK 
Positive Inc. (hereafter "ALK Positive") is probably the most widely known among 
these organizations. Evolving from a private Facebook Support Group created in 
2015 to provide a forum for ALK-positive lung cancer patients and caregivers to 
exchange information, empathy and support, ALK Positive transitioned in 2021 
into a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization (NPO), with the mission to improve the 
life expectancy and quality of life for ALK-positive cancer patients worldwide. 
This review provides a historical perspective on the growth, activities and 
aspirations of ALK Positive to pursue patient advocacy and enable development of 
new therapies for individuals with ALK-positive cancers. This growth has been 
enabled by the collaborative efforts of ALK-positive cancer patients, their 
care-partners and oncologists, academic researchers, other NPO advocacy 
organizations, and members of the biotech and pharma communities who develop new 
therapies for ALK-positive cancers. ALK Positive has grown to provide a variety 
of patient services, to award competitive support for translational research and 
clinical trials intended to enable new therapies and improved quality and extent 
of life for ALK-positive cancer patients, and to collaborate with industry and 
academia to accelerate the development of improved therapies for ALK-positive 
cancer patients. ALK Positive continues grappling with a variety of challenges 
including further improving patient quality of life, enabling the development of 
new therapies, and extending its already substantial global reach and impact. 
This review summarizes many of the tangible impacts and aspirations engendered 
by ALK Positive for ALK-positive cancer patients in the past, present and future 
tenses-where we have been, where we stand and where we hope to go. The content 
is based on the historical recollections of the authors, and is accurate as of 
November 30, 2022, to the best of the authors' knowledge.

Update in
    RNA. 2023 Oct 10;:

The tremendous rate with which data is generated and analysis methods emerge 
makes it increasingly difficult to keep track of their domain of applicability, 
assumptions, and limitations and consequently, of the efficacy and precision 
with which they solve specific tasks. Therefore, there is an increasing need for 
benchmarks, and for the provision of infrastructure for continuous method 
evaluation. APAeval is an international community effort, organized by the RNA 
Society in 2021, to benchmark tools for the identification and quantification of 
the usage of alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites from short-read, bulk 
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Here, we reviewed 17 tools and benchmarked eight 
on their ability to perform APA identification and quantification, using a 
comprehensive set of RNA-seq experiments comprising real, synthetic, and matched 
3'-end sequencing data. To support continuous benchmarking, we have incorporated 
the results into the OpenEBench online platform, which allows for seamless 
extension of the set of methods, metrics, and challenges. We envisage that our 
analyses will assist researchers in selecting the appropriate tools for their 
studies. Furthermore, the containers and reproducible workflows generated in the 
course of this project can be seamlessly deployed and extended in the future to 
evaluate new methods or datasets.

BACKGROUND: Estimating and analyzing trends and patterns of health loss are 
essential to promote efficient resource allocation and improve Peru's healthcare 
system performance.
METHODS: Using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD), Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (2019), we assessed mortality and disability in Peru from 
1990 to 2019. We report demographic and epidemiologic trends in terms of 
population, life expectancy at birth (LE), mortality, incidence, prevalence, 
years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by the major diseases and risk 
factors in Peru. Finally, we compared Peru with 16 countries in the Latin 
American (LA) region.
RESULTS: The Peruvian population reached 33.9 million inhabitants (49.9% women) 
in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, LE at birth increased from 69.2 (95% uncertainty 
interval 67.8-70.3) to 80.3 (77.2-83.2) years. This increase was driven by the 
decline in under-5 mortality (-80.7%) and mortality from infectious diseases in 
older age groups (+60 years old). The number of DALYs in 1990 was 9.2 million 
(8.5-10.1) and reached 7.5 million (6.1-9.0) in 2019. The proportion of DALYs 
due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) increased from 38.2% in 1990 to 67.9% in 
2019. The all-ages and age-standardized DALYs rates and YLLs rates decreased, 
but YLDs rates remained constant. In 2019, the leading causes of DALYs were 
neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections (LRIs), ischemic heart disease, 
road injuries, and low back pain. The leading risk factors associated with DALYs 
in 2019 were undernutrition, high body mass index, high fasting plasma glucose, 
and air pollution. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Peru experienced one of the 
highest LRIs-DALYs rates in the LA region.
CONCLUSION: In the last three decades, Peru experienced significant improvements 
in LE and child survival and an increase in the burden of NCDs and associated 
disability. The Peruvian healthcare system must be redesigned to respond to this 
epidemiological transition. The new design should aim to reduce premature deaths 
and maintain healthy longevity, focusing on effective coverage and treatment of 
NCDs and reducing and managing the related disability.

BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in the disruption 
of Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) services in the Eastern and 
Southern Africa region. To date, studies estimating the impact of COVID-19 
disruptions have mainly focused on SRHR services without estimating the economic 
implication.
METHOD: We used national service coverage data on the effectiveness of 
interventions from the lives saved tool (LiST), a mathematical modeling tool 
that estimates the effects of service coverage change in mortality. We computed 
years lost due to COVID-19 disruption on SRHR using life expectancy at birth, 
number of years of life lost due to child mortality, and life expectancy at 
average maternal death. We calculated the economic value of the lives saved, 
using the values of statistical life year for each of the countries, comparing 
2019 (pre-COVID-19) to 2020 (COVID-19 era).
FINDINGS: The total life-years lost were 1,335,663, with 1,056,174 life-years 
lost attributed to child mortality and 279,249 linked to maternal mortalities, 
with high case-fatality rates in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, and 
Tanzania. The findings show COVID-19 disruptions on SRHR services between 2019 
and 2020 resulted in US$ 3.6 billion losses, with the highest losses in Angola 
(USD 777 million), South Africa (USD 539 million), and Democratic Republic of 
Congo (USD 361 million).
CONCLUSION: The monetized value of disability adjusted life years can be used as 
evidence for advocacy, increased investment, and appropriate mitigation 
strategies. Countries should strengthen their health systems functionality, 
incorporating and transforming lessons learned from shock events.

With extended life expectancy, the quality of life of elders is a priority. Loss 
of mobility, increased morbidity and risks of falls have dramatic individual and 
societal impacts. Here we consider the age-related modifications of gait, from a 
biomechanical and neurophysiological perspective. Among the many factors of 
frailty involved (e.g., metabolic, hormonal, immunological), loss of muscle 
strength and neurodegenerative changes inducing slower muscle contraction may 
play a key role. We highlight that the impact of the multifactorial age-related 
changes in the neuromuscular systems results in common features of gait in the 
immature gait of infants and older adults. Besides, we also consider the 
reversibility of age-related neuromuscular deterioration by, on the one hand, 
exercise training, and the other hand, novel techniques such as direct spinal 
stimulation (tsDCS).

Person-Centered Models for Cardiovascular Care: A Review of the Evidence: A 
Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.

Rossi LP, Granger BB, Bruckel JT, Crabbe DL, Graven LJ, Newlin KS, Streur MM, 
Vadiveloo MK, Walton-Moss BJ, Warden BA, Volgman AS, Lydston M; American Heart 
Association Complex Cardiovascular Patient and Family Care Committee of the 
Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing; Council on Clinical Cardiology; 
and Council on Quality of Care and Outcomes Research.

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death and disability in the 
United States and globally. Disease burden continues to escalate despite 
technological advances associated with improved life expectancy and quality of 
life. As a result, longer life is associated with multiple chronic 
cardiovascular conditions. Clinical guidelines provide recommendations without 
considering prevalent scenarios of multimorbidity and health system complexities 
that affect practical adoption. The diversity of personal preferences, cultures, 
and lifestyles that make up one's social and environmental context is often 
overlooked in ongoing care planning for symptom management and health behavior 
support, hindering adoption and compromising patient outcomes, particularly in 
groups at high risk. The purpose of this scientific statement was to describe 
the characteristics and reported outcomes in existing person-centered care 
delivery models for selected cardiovascular conditions. We conducted a scoping 
review using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, Web of Science, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials through Ovid, and ClinicalTrials.gov from 
2010 to 2022. A range of study designs with a defined aim to systematically 
evaluate care delivery models for selected cardiovascular conditions were 
included. Models were selected on the basis of their stated use of 
evidence-based guidelines, clinical decision support tools, systematic 
evaluation processes, and inclusion of the patient's perspective in defining the 
plan of care. Findings reflected variation in methodological approach, outcome 
measures, and care processes used across models. Evidence to support optimal 
care delivery models remains limited by inconsistencies in approach, variation 
in reimbursement, and inability of health systems to meet the needs of patients 
with chronic, complex cardiovascular conditions.

Actually, the epidemiology is a dynamically developing medical science located 
at the intersection of social and biological branches of knowledge and 
bio-informatics. The new sources of data, the new methods create unique 
opportunities for epidemiologist. The number of epidemiological studies carrying 
out at the junction of several adjacent disciplines is increasing that requires 
harmonious interaction of specialists of different branches of medical 
knowledge. The change of the structure of global mortality towards chronic 
non-communicable diseases significantly affected the vector of epidemiological 
studies. Many interventional epidemiological projects are targeted to evaluation 
of effectiveness of new methods of prevention of cardiovascular, metabolic and 
oncological diseases. However, in recent years, the fight against unremembered 
infections affecting about 1 billion of people and taking away lives of 0.5 
million people annually gained new importance. The current COVID-19 pandemic 
also affected epidemiology of communicable and chronic non-communicable 
diseases. Great attention is also currently attended to studying influence of 
social, economic and environmental factors on human health. The increase of 
average life expectancy of population contributes to development of epidemiology 
of the elderly. The new projects are initiated in the field of 
pharmacoepidemiology targeted to studying effectiveness of medications. The 
review of national and foreign publications considering current trends and 
achievements in the field of epidemiology. The reference retrieval engines such 
as PubMed, Google Scholar, CyberLeninka were used. The current directions of 
epidemiological research are analyzed. The challenges and development prospects 
of development of modern epidemiology are highlighted.

The article presents short characteristic of relevant scientific publications 
concerning some aspects of public health of Greece, Spain and Bulgaria and 
presented in the PubMed database in 2014-2020. The rather high indicators of 
life expectancy, low values of maternal and infant mortality are marked. The 
best results are established in Spain. The high prevalence of chronic 
non-communicable diseases and their risk factors persists in countries analyzed, 
especially in Bulgaria and Greece. The health care systems of Greece, Spain and 
Bulgaria implement projects of digital transformation of medical care support. 
The most successful in this respect is Spain, while in Bulgaria and Greece 
information systems in health care remain fragmented.

BACKGROUND: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) 
not only cause acute, devastating mucocutaneous reactions but also have 
long-lasting implications on survivors' lives.
OBJECTIVES: To quantify the lifetime burden of SJS/TEN.
METHODS: The cumulative incidence rate (CIR), life expectancy (LE), loss-of-life 
expectancy (LoLE) and lifetime healthcare expenditure (HE) for SJS/TEN were 
estimated over the period from 2008 to 2019 using data from the National Health 
Insurance Research Database of Taiwan and life tables of vital statistics.
RESULTS: In this nationwide cohort of 6552 incident SJS/TEN cases, a trend 
towards a decrease in the CIR was observed between 2008 and 2019. Compared with 
the general population, patients with SJS/TEN experience a tremendous loss of 
9.43 (1.06) [mean (SEM)] years of LE after diagnosis of SJS/TEN. Male patients 
with SJS/TEN had higher LoLE [10.74 (1.22) vs. 7.69 (1.43) years] and annual HE 
than females. Younger age at diagnosis of SJS/TEN was associated with longer LE 
but greater LoLE and higher lifetime HE. Patients with intensive care unit 
admission on diagnosis, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease 
and SJS/TEN-associated sequelae experienced substantially greater LoLE and HE 
per life year.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SJS/TEN suffer substantial loss-of-LE and HE, 
particularly young patients, compared with the general population. These data 
provide a reference estimate of the lifetime burden of SJS/TEN to help health 
authorities evaluate the cost-effectiveness of future preventive and treatment 
strategies to minimize the burden of SJS/TEN.

IMPORTANCE: In the setting of a new cancer diagnosis, the focus is usually on 
the cancer as the main threat to survival, but people may have other conditions 
that pose an equal or greater threat to their life than their cancer: a 
competing risk of death. This is especially true for patients who have cancer of 
the oral cavity, because prolonged exposure to alcohol and tobacco are risk 
factors for cancer in this location but also can result in medical conditions 
with the potential to shorten life expectancy, competing as a cause of death 
that may intervene in conjunction with or before the cancer.
OBSERVATIONS: A calculator designed for public use has been released that allows 
patients age 20 to 86 years who have a newly diagnosed oral cancer to obtain 
estimates of their health status-adjusted age, life expectancy in the absence of 
the cancer, and probability of surviving, dying of the cancer, or dying of other 
causes within 1 to 10 years after diagnosis. The models in the calculator showed 
that patients with oral cavity cancer had a higher than average risk of death 
from other causes than the matched US population, and this risk increases by 
stage.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results 
Program Oral Cancer Survival Calculator supports a holistic approach to the life 
of the patient, and the risk of death of other causes is treated equally to 
consideration of the probability of death of the cancer. This tool may be 
usefully paired with the other available prognostic calculators for oral cancer 
and is an example of the possibilities now available with registry linkages to 
partially overlapping or independent data sets and statistical techniques that 
allow the use of 2 time scales in 1 analysis.

IMPORTANCE: Standard cancer prognosis models typically do not include much 
specificity in characterizing competing illnesses or general health status when 
providing prognosis estimates, limiting their utility for individuals, who must 
consider their cancer in the context of their overall health. This is especially 
true for patients with oral cancer, who frequently have competing illnesses.
OBJECTIVE: To describe a statistical framework and accompanying new publicly 
available calculator that provides personalized estimates of the probability of 
a patient surviving or dying from cancer or other causes, using oral cancer as 
the first data set.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The models used data from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registry (2000 to 2011), SEER-Medicare 
linked files, and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (1986 to 2009). 
Statistical methods developed to calculate natural life expectancy in the 
absence of the cancer, cancer-specific survival, and other-cause survival were 
applied to oral cancer data and internally validated with 10-fold 
cross-validation. Eligible participants were aged between 20 and 94 years with 
oral squamous cell carcinoma.
EXPOSURES: Histologically confirmed oral cancer, general health status, smoking, 
and selected serious comorbid conditions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Probabilities of surviving or dying from the cancer 
or from other causes, and life expectancy in the absence of the cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 22 392 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (13 544 
male [60.5%]; 1476 Asian and Pacific Islander [6.7%]; 1792 Black [8.0%], 1589 
Hispanic [7.2%], 17 300 White [78.1%]) and 402 626 NHIS interviewees were 
included in this calculator designed for public use for patients ages 20 to 86 
years with newly diagnosed oral cancer to obtain estimates of health 
status-adjusted age, life expectancy in the absence of the cancer, and the 
probability of surviving, dying from the cancer, or dying from other causes 
within 1 to 10 years after diagnosis. The models in the calculator estimated 
that patients with oral cancer have a higher risk of death from other causes 
than their matched US population, and that this risk increases by stage.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The models developed for the calculator demonstrate 
that survival estimates that exclude the effects of coexisting conditions can 
lead to underestimates or overestimates of survival. This new calculator 
approach will be broadly applicable for developing future prognostic models of 
cancer and noncancer aspects of a person's health in other cancers; as 
registries develop more linkages, available covariates will become broader, 
strengthening future tools.

Active packaging films based on poly (lactic acid) (PLA) were developed by 
adding different concentrations (5 wt% and 10 wt%) of betel leaf (Piper betel) 
ethanolic extract (BLEE). The extract showed excellent antioxidant (80.2 %) and 
antimicrobial properties (18.05 and 16.05 mm against S. aureus and E. coli 
respectively). The films' structural, functional, and mechanical attributes were 
studied, along with their potential for extending the shelf life of tuna meat. 
The water solubility and water permeability were reduced with the incorporation 
of BLEE; while the tensile strength showed an inverse relationship with the 
concentration, 214.5 kg/cm2 (5 wt%), and to 307.6 kg/cm2 (10 wt%). The lipid 
oxidation in PLA-BLEE-packed tuna meat stored under refrigeration (7 days) 
showed a significant reduction, which could be attributed to the phenolic 
migration from the films. The new PLA-BLEE films with significant antibacterial 
and film attributes could be used in food packaging and to extend the shelf life 
of commodities that have been packaged.

Whether a healthy lifestyle helps achieve gains in life expectancy (LE) free of 
major non-communicable diseases and its share of total LE in Chinese adults 
remains unknown. We considered five low-risk lifestyle factors: never smoking or 
quitting for reasons other than illness, no excessive alcohol use, being 
physically active, healthy eating habits and healthy body fat levels. Here we 
show that after a median follow-up of 11.1 years for 451,233 Chinese adults, the 
LE free of cardiovascular diseases, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases (95% 
confidence interval) at age 40 years for individuals with all five low-risk 
factors was on average 6.3 (5.1-7.5) years (men) and 4.2 (3.6-5.4) years (women) 
longer than those with 0-1 low-risk factors. Correspondingly, the proportion of 
disease-free LE to total LE increased from 73.1% to 76.3% for men and from 67.6% 
to 68.4% for women. Our findings suggest that promoting healthy lifestyles could 
be associated with gains in disease-free LE in the Chinese population.

INTRODUCTION: Oral administration of zeaxanthin (Zx) 20 mg daily in patients 
with unilateral neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) treated with 
triple therapy (photodynamic therapy/intravitreal bevacizumab/intravitreal 
dexamethasone) reduced fellow-eye 2-year nAMD incidence from 23 to 6% (p = 0.02) 
in a prior clinical trial. We questioned the long-term benefit and thus analyzed 
case-control 5-year patient data of trial participants and additional 
participants with 5-year follow-up, also performing cost-utility and 
cost-benefit analyses.
METHODS: Consecutive, unilateral nAMD patient outcomes for those taking 20 mg Zx 
supplementation orally for ≥ 5 years were compared with the Comparison of AMD 
Treatments Trials (CATT) 5-year historical controls for fellow-eye nAMD 
conversion. Eleven-year mean life expectancy, cost-utility and cost-benefit 
models were undertaken employing a 3% discount rate and 2020 US real dollars.
RESULTS: Among 227 consecutive patients with nAMD/Zx-supplementation, 202 (90%) 
had 5-year follow-up. The fellow-eye nAMD 5-year conversion incidence using a 
Kaplan-Meier cumulative event estimate was 22% (49/227), versus 48% (167/348) 
with CATT control data (p < 0.0001). An 11-year cost-utility model with 
estimates for years 6-11 demonstrated a 0.42 (7.7%) QALY (quality-adjusted 
life-year) gain, including 3 months of life saved per patient due to decreased 
nAMD fellow-eye conversion. This yielded a direct ophthalmic medical cost 
perspective, incremental cost-utility ratio (CUR) of -$576/QALY and a societal 
cost perspective CUR of -$125,071/QALY. Zx supplementation for all 2020 US 
unilateral nAMD cases would have theoretically saved society, primarily 
patients, $6.0 billion over 11 years, a 1531% return on investment (ROI), or 
31.3% annual ROI, on Zx costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral zeaxanthin supplementation for unilateral nAMD patients 
appears to decrease fellow-eye long-term incidence and is cost-effective and 
financially rewarding. It is dominant vs. no supplementation in patients 
presenting with unilateral nAMD.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01527435.
