conditions, in the relative impact of CVD burden in PSC. Among CVD, ischemic 
heart disease was the leading cause of death in all PSC in 2016, except for 
Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe, where cerebrovascular diseases have 
supplanted it. The most relevant attributable risk factors for CVD among all PSC 
are hypertension and dietary factors.
CONCLUSION: Collaboration among PSC may allow successful experiences in 
combating CVD to be shared between those countries.

BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-chromosome-linked genetic 
disorder (locus Xp21). Involvement of the cardiovascular system is characterized 
by fibrous degeneration/replacement of myocytes with consequent ventricular 
hypertrophy and arterial hypertension.
OBJECTIVE: To assess, by using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the 
behavior of blood pressure variables in children and adolescents with a 
confirmed diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
METHODS: Prospective observational cohort study, which selected 46 patients 
followed up on an outpatient basis, divided according to age groups. Blood 
pressure was classified according to the age percentile. The monitoring 
interpretation includes systolic and diastolic blood pressure means, systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure loads, and nocturnal dipping. The blood pressure 
means were calculated for the 24-hour, wakefulness and sleep periods. Nocturnal 
dipping was defined as a drop in blood pressure means during sleep greater than 
10%. The significance level adopted was p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Nocturnal dipping for systolic blood pressure was present in 29.9% of 
the participants. Approximately 53% of them had attenuated nocturnal dipping, 
and 15%, reverse nocturnal dipping. The age groups of 9-11 years and 6-8 years 
had the greatest percentage of attenuation, 19.1% and 14.9%, respectively. 
Regarding diastolic blood pressure, nocturnal dipping was identified in 53.2% of 
the children, being extreme in 27.7% of those in the age group of 6-11 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The early diagnosis of blood pressure changes can allow the 
appropriate and specific therapy, aimed at increasing the life expectancy of 
patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

This article aims to discuss the main consequences of the implementation of the 
Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TTPA) in the pharmaceutical sector in 
regard to public health, focusing on the accessibility and affordability of 
medicines. This paper also looks at the likely impact of the TPP agreement on 
access to affordable medicines. The potential effects of provisions in the final 
text are explored based on the context of developed and developing countries. A 
meta-synthesis study design was used. The thematic analysis technique was used 
to generate themes and a decision tree of the TTPA meta-synthesis. PubMed, 
EBSCOhost, Ovid, and Scopus databases from inception until the first week of 
January 2016 were used. Only peer-reviewed journals that discussed TPPA's impact 
on the pharmaceutical sector were included. Data were extracted by 2 reviewers 
and then verified by 3 senior researchers. The extracted data were imported into 
Excel spreadsheets and coded line by line. Codes were organized into descriptive 
themes. The identified themes were cross-checked against original articles to 
ensure consistency. A total of 85 full articles and reports were reviewed and, 
finally, 32 of them were used in the meta-synthesis. Two central themes to the 
TTPA emerged: intellectual property rights and transparency. Five subthemes were 
identified under intellectual property rights: patent subject matter 
(representing scope of patentability), patent term adjustment for patent office 
delays (representing patent term extension), protection of undisclosed test or 
other data (representing data exclusivity), protection of undisclosed test or 
other data (representing patent linkage), and compulsory licensing. Meanwhile, 
transparency and anti-corruption-procedural fairness, which presents restriction 
of coverage program and reimbursement, were identified as the subthemes of 
transparency. Findings indicate that the TPPA could potentially hinder the 
affordability and accessibility of medicine, which could increase risks to 
public health.

BACKGROUND: The Hintegra® arthroplasty provides inversion-eversion stability, 
permits axial rotation, ankle flexion-extension, and improvements of the gait 
patterns are expected up to 12 months of rehabilitation. However, sensorimotor 
impairments are observed in ankle flexors/extensors muscles after 
rehabilitation, with potential negative effects on locomotion. Here we 
determined the timing and amplitude of co-activation of the tibialis anterior 
and medial gastrocnemius muscles during gait by assessing non-operated and 
operated legs of patients with total ankle replacement, 5 years after surgery.
METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (age: 58 [5.5] years, height: 156.4 [6.5] cm, body 
mass: 72.9 [6.5] kg, 10 men, and 19 women) that underwent Hintegra® ankle 
arthroplasty were included. Inclusion criteria included 5 years prosthesis 
survivorship. The onset and offset of muscle activation (timing), as well as the 
amplitude of activation, were determined during barefoot walking at 
self-selected speed by surface electromyography. The timing, percentage, and 
index of co-activation between the tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius 
were quantified and compared between non-operated and operated legs.
FINDINGS: The operated leg showed higher co-activation index and temporal 
overlapping between tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius during gait 
(p < 0.001).
INTERPRETATION: The neuromuscular changes developed during the process of 
degeneration do not appear to be restored 5 years following arthroplasty. The 
insertion of an ankle implant may restore anatomy and alignment but 
neuromuscular adaptations to degeneration are not corrected by 5 years following 
joint replacement.

PURPOSE: Time attitudes refer to individuals' feelings about the past, present, 
and future, and an increasing number of cross-sectional studies have 
demonstrated that positive time attitudes are significantly related to better 
health and well-being. We investigated time attitude profile membership and 
associated transitions longitudinally in United Kingdom-based adolescents, and 
assessed the relationship between time attitude profile development on health 
behaviours at + 21 months after the data collection involving time attitudes.
METHODS: Participants were high school students (N = 1306; 41.8% female, Mage 
12.5-14.5 years [waves 1-3]). The Adolescent and Adult Time Inventory - Time 
Attitudes Scale was employed to identify profiles, and a mover-stayer latent 
transition analysis was employed to examine developmental changes. Data were 
also gathered on sensation seeking, and a range of health indicators were 
assessed: Past week frequency of physical exercise, self-rated health, 
subjective life expectancy, lifetime cannabis and smoking, and dental 
attendance.
RESULTS: Staying in a positive time attitude profile was related to higher 
subjective life expectancy, and less frequent use of cannabis and cigarettes 
(1.00 ≤ d ≤ 4.00). Further, moving to a positive profile predicted healthier 
outcomes for most health measures used.
CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the limitation that health outcomes in the present 
study were distal, the present study bolstered a developing cross-sectional 
literature supporting the association between positive time attitudes and better 
health and well-being outcomes. Future longitudinal studies which assess 
measures concurrently are required.

Heat-induced hormesis is a well-known conserved phenomenon in aging, 
traditionally attributed to the benefits conferred by increased amounts of heat 
shock (HS) proteins. Here we find that the key event for the HS-induced lifespan 
extension in budding yeast is the switch from glycolysis to respiratory 
metabolism. The resulting increase in reactive oxygen species activates the 
antioxidant response, supported by the redirection of glucose from glycolysis to 
the pentose phosphate pathway, increasing the production of NADPH. This sequence 
of events culminates in replicative lifespan (RLS) extension, implying decreased 
mortality per generation that persists even after the HS has finished. We found 
that switching to respiratory metabolism, and particularly the consequent 
increase in glutathione levels, were essential for the observed RLS extension. 
These results draw the focus away solely from the HS response and demonstrate 
that the antioxidant response has a key role in heat-induced hormesis. Our 
findings underscore the importance of the changes in cellular metabolic activity 
for heat-induced longevity in budding yeast.

Halyomorpha halys (Stål), or brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), has become a 
major pest and nuisance for both agricultural growers and homeowners since its 
arrival in North America and Europe. The nutritional ecology of BMSB is 
important for understanding its life history and rearing requirements. However, 
little is known about the nutritional status of wild populations, especially in 
the U.S. This research monitored the nutrient status of nymphal and adult BMSB 
collected from English holly in western Oregon. We measured their weight, 
nutrient index (weight/(prothorax × width)³), lipid, glycogen and sugar levels 
and egg load from May⁻September/October. First, glycogen and sugar levels of 
adults were often lowest sometime in June-August with a general increase by 
September. Meanwhile, their lipid levels varied without a discernible trend. 
Second, adult females had few eggs in May, with the highest egg load in June and 
July, and no eggs by September. Lastly, first and second nymphal instars were 
found in June, and fourth and fifth instars in September. Because nothing is 
known about the nutrient levels of nymphs, the reported values from this survey 
can assist future research on physiological responses of BMSB to treatments or 
environmental impacts in the field.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: In Europe, hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening still targets 
people at high risk of infection. We aim to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
expanded HCV screening in France.
METHODS: A Markov model simulated chronic hepatitis C (CHC) prevalence, 
incidence of events, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in the French general population, aged 18 to 
80 years, undiagnosed for CHC for different strategies: S1 = current strategy 
targeting the at risk population; S2 = S1 and all men between 18 and 59 years; 
S3 = S1 and all individuals between 40 and 59 years; S4 = S1 and all individuals 
between 40 and 80 years; S5 = all individuals between 18 and 80 years (universal 
screening). Once CHC was diagnosed, treatment was initiated either to patients 
with fibrosis stage ≥F2 or regardless of fibrosis. Data were extracted from 
published literature, a national prevalence survey, and a previously published 
mathematical model. ICER were interpreted based on one or three times French GDP 
per capita (€32,800).
RESULTS: Universal screening led to the lowest prevalence of CHC and incidence 
of events, regardless of treatment initiation. When considering treatment 
initiation to patients with fibrosis ≥F2, targeting all people aged 40-80 was 
the only cost-effective strategy at both thresholds (€26,100/QALY). When we 
considered treatment for all, although universal screening of all individuals 
aged 18-80 is associated with the highest costs, it is more effective than 
targeting all people aged 40-80, and cost-effective at both thresholds 
(€31,100/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: In France, universal screening is the most effective screening 
strategy for HCV. Universal screening is cost-effective when treatment is 
initiated regardless of fibrosis stage. From an individual and especially from a 
societal perspective of HCV eradication, this strategy should be implemented.
LAY SUMMARY: In the context of highly effective and well tolerated therapies for 
hepatitis C virus that are now recommended for all patients, a reassessment of 
hepatitis C screening strategies is needed. An effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness study of different strategies targeting either the at-risk 
population, specific ages or all individuals was performed. In France, universal 
screening is the most effective strategy and is cost-effective when treatment is 
initiated regardless of fibrosis stage. From an individual and especially from a 
societal perspective of hepatitis C virus eradication, this strategy should be 
implemented.

BACKGROUND: Regorafenib and TAS-102 are standard treatment options in refractory 
metastatic colorectal cancer based on improvement in overall survival by 6 and 8 
weeks, respectively, when compared with best supportive care alone (BSC). Given 
the small incremental clinical benefit, we evaluated their cost-effectiveness 
from a United States payer's perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to compare costs and 
effectiveness of regorafenib, TAS-102, and BSC. Model inputs for clinical 
efficacy and adverse events were from the CORRECT trial (Regorafenib monotherapy 
for previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer: an international, 
multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial) for regorafenib and 
the RECOURSE trial (Randomized, Double Blind, Phase 3 Study of TAS-102 plus Best 
Supportive Care [BSC] versus Placebo plus BSC in Patients with Metastatic 
Colorectal Cancer Refractory to Standard Chemotherapies) for TAS-102. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were reported to compare 
treatments. Model robustness was checked with univariate and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses as well as a scenario analysis using the CONCUR trial data 
for regorafenib.
RESULTS: In our base case, regorafenib and TAS-102 had the ICERs of $395,223 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and $399,740 per QALY versus BSC, 
respectively. Compared with regorafenib, TAS-102 provided an additional 0.041 
QALY at the cost of $16,608 or $406,104 per QALY, but the differences were not 
robust in sensitivity analyses. The most influential parameters on the ICERs 
were efficacy and health state utility parameters as well as the cost of 
treating neutropenia. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, BSC was more cost-effective than both 
regorafenib and TAS-102 in 50% of repetitions at the willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $330,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Neither TAS-102 nor regorafenib are cost-effective at standard 
willingness-to-pay thresholds (ie, $150,000 per QALY) relative to BSC. There is 
no clear evidence that either treatment has better relative value.

BACKGROUND Life expectancy in southeastern North Carolina communities located in 
an area with multiple concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) after 
adjusting for socioeconomic factors remains low. We hypothesized that poor 
health outcomes in this region may be due to converging demographic, 
socioeconomic, behavioral, and access-to-care factors and are influenced by the 
presence of hog CAFOs.METHODS We studied mortality, hospital admissions, and 
emergency department (ED) usage for health conditions potentially associated 
with hog CAFOs-anemia, kidney disease, infectious diseases, and low birth weight 
(LBW)-in North Carolina communities located in zip codes with hog CAFOs (Study 
group 1), in zip codes with > 215hogs/km2 (Study group 2), and without hog CAFOs 
(Control group). We compared cause-specific age-adjusted rates, the odds ratios 
(ORs) of events in multivariable analyses (adjusted for 6 co-factors), and the 
changes of ORs relative to the distance to hog CAFOs.RESULTS Residents from 
Study groups 1 and 2 had higher rates of all-cause mortality, infant mortality, 
mortality of patients with multimorbidity, mortality from anemia, kidney 
disease, tuberculosis, and septicemia, and higher rates of ED visits and 
hospital admissions for LBW infants than the residents in the Control group. In 
zip codes with > 215hogs/km2, mortality ORs were 1.50 for anemia (P < 0.0001), 
1.31 for kidney disease (P < 0.0001), 2.30 for septicemia (P < 0.0001), and 2.22 
for tuberculosis (P = 0.0061).LIMITATIONS This study included a lack of 
individual measurements on environmental contaminants, biomarkers of exposures 
and co-factors, and differences in residential and occupational 
locations.CONCLUSION North Carolina communities located near hog CAFOs had 
higher all-cause and infant mortality, mortality due to anemia, kidney disease, 
tuberculosis, septicemia, and higher hospital admissions/ED visits of LBW 
infants. Although not establishing causality with exposures from hog CAFOs, our 
findings support the need for future studies to determine factors that influence 
these outcomes, as well as the need to improve screening and diagnostic 
strategies for these diseases in North Carolina communities adjacent to hog 
CAFOs.

Mitohormesis is an adaptive response induced by a mild mitochondrial stress that 
promotes longevity and metabolic health in different organisms. This mechanism 
has been proposed as the cause of the increase in the survival in Coq7+/- 
(Mclk1+/-) mice, which show hepatic reduction of COQ7, early mitochondrial 
dysfunction and increased oxidative stress. Our study shows that the lack of 
COQ9 in Coq9Q95X mice triggers the reduction of COQ7, COQ6 and COQ5, which 
results in an increase in life expectancy. However, our results reveal that the 
hepatic CoQ levels are not decreased and, therefore, neither mitochondrial 
dysfunction or increased oxidative stress are observed in liver of Coq9Q95X 
mice. These data point out the tissue specific differences in CoQ biosynthesis. 
Moreover, our results suggest that the effect of reduced levels of COQ7 on the 
increased survival in Coq9Q95X mice may be due to mitochondrial mechanisms in 
non-liver tissues or to other unknown mechanisms.

Beyond avoiding risky behavior-smoking, substance abuse, obesity-and embracing 
healthy habits like exercise, a balanced diet, and non-obese body weight, are 
there things we each do today to significantly extend our lifespan? Caloric 
restriction is the only behavioral intervention consistently shown to extend 
both mean and maximal lifespan across a wide range of species. In most cases, 
the lifespan extension is accompanied by a marked delay in the onset of 
age-associated disease and infirmity.

For prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy remains the gold standard for 
surgical management. Given the side effects associated with surgery, patients at 
low risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality should consider active 
surveillance under the guidance of a urologist to safely delay intervention. For 
patients with an intermediate risk of cancer-specific mortality and otherwise 
healthy life expectancy, radical prostatectomy has been demonstrated to improve 
survival. Finally, even for select patients with advanced prostate 
cancer-metastatic disease to the lymph nodes or distant sites-radical 
prostatectomy may provide a survival benefit.

Opioid misuse is reducing Americans' life expectancy, thereby catalyzing 
professional societies and legislators to action. Efforts to combat the opioid 
epidemic must work hand-in-hand with appropriate efforts to reduce the severity 
and duration of suffering. Pharmacologic analgesia is temporizing. Current 
opioid prescribing guidelines focus on reducing the frequency and quantity of 
narcotics prescribed, but lack attention to alleviation of the source of pain. 
Conditions eliciting acute pain sometimes require additional specialist 
management following discharge from the emergency department. Patients 
frequently lack timely access to these specialists, particularly if 
underinsured. This essay explores acute dental pain, extremity fractures, and 
back pain as three common examples whereby complex healthcare systems must 
efficiently adapt in order to serve the dual objectives of reducing the risk of 
opioid-related adverse consequences and minimizing the duration of patient 
suffering.

OBJECTIVE: Several factors should be considered when a prosthetic heart valve, 
bioprosthetic valve (BV) or mechanical valve is to be implanted: 
thrombogenicity, life expectancy and the risk of reoperation.
METHODS: We conducted an observational retrospective multicentre study among 
Italian Thrombosis Centers on patients with BV on long-term vitamin K antagonist 
(VKA) treatment to evaluate the risk of reoperation and the rate of bleeding and 
thrombotic events.
RESULTS: We analysed 612 patients (median age 71.8 years) with BV on long-term 
VKA treatment for the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) (78.4%) or other 
indications (21.6%). Thirty-four major bleeding events (rate 1.1×100 
patient-years) and 29 thromboembolic events (rate 0.9×100 patient-years) were 
recorded, and 46 patients (rate 1.5×100 patient-years) underwent reoperation. 
The rate of reoperation was higher among younger patients: 32.9% in patients <60 
years and 3.9% in patients ≥60 years (relative risk (RR) 3.8, 95% CI 2.1 to 7.2; 
p=0.0001). When patients were analysed according to age <65 or ≥65 years and 
<75 or ≥70 years, younger patients still were at higher risk for reoperation (RR 
3.1, 95% CI 1.7 to 6.0 and 3.7, 95% CI 1.7 to 8.6, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the threshold of 65 years for implanting 
a BV should be carefully evaluated, considering the high risk for reoperation 
and the high risk of AF occurrence with persisting need for long-term 
anticoagulation. The high risk for reoperation of young patients implanted with 
BV and the availability of a safer and easier way to conduct VKA treatment, such 
as the use of point-of-care devices, should be considered when the type of valve 
must be chosen.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited incurable multi-organ disease. Improvement 
in treatment approaches over the last 20 years have led to an increased life 
expectancy where the number of adult patients has doubled and will continue to 
increase exponentially. Due to the use of new substances which modulate the 
basic defect, a substantial improvement in the prognosis can be assumed but the 
existing healthcare structures in Germany do not meet these rising needs. With 
more than 50% of patients being adults, there are only very few internal 
medicine centers available. Only approximately one third of the patients are 
treated in adult health centers. Adolescence in particular is a very vulnerable 
phase of the disease, the risk of comorbidities is increased and adherence to 
the very laborious treatment recommendations is as a rule low. While in many 
other countries transition programs have been evaluated and implemented for more 
than 20 years, in Germany there have only been rudimentary approaches to 
transition. Meanwhile investigations are available on the perceptions of 
adolescents with respect to coping with the disease and their treatment needs, 
including the perception of the time when the transition process should begin. 
Successful transition seems to be performed best in combined pediatric and adult 
centers, with the back-up of an experienced multidisciplinary team of healthcare 
providers.

A QALY loss is a QALY loss is a QALY loss: a note on independence of loss 
aversion from health states.

Evidence has accumulated documenting loss aversion for monetary and, recently, 
for health outcomes-meaning that, generally, losses carry more weight than 
equally sized gains. In the conventional Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) 
models, which comprise utility for quality and length of life, loss aversion is 
not taken into account. When measuring elements of the QALY model, commonly, the 
(implicit) assumption is that utility for length and quality of life are 
independent. First attempts to quantify loss aversion for QALYs typically 
measured loss aversion in the context of life duration, keeping quality of life 
constant (or vice versa). However, given that QALYs are multi-attribute 
utilities, it may be possible that the degree of loss aversion is dependent on, 
or inseparable from, quality of life and non-constant. We test this assumption 
using non-parametric methodology to quantify loss aversion, under different 
levels of quality of life. We measure utility of life duration for four health 
states within subjects, and present the results of a robustness test of loss 
aversion within the QALY model. We find loss aversion coefficients to be stable 
at the aggregate level, albeit with considerable heterogeneity at the individual 
level. Implications for applied work on prospect theory within health economics 
are discussed.

24/7 usage of continence pads and quality of life impairment in women with 
urinary incontinence.

Grzybowska ME(1), Wydra D(1).

Author information:

Medical University of Gdańsk, Gdańsk, Poland.

AIMS: To compare quality of life (QoL) in women with urinary incontinence (UI) 
using continence pads during the day versus all day and night; to identify risk 
factors for a 24-hour pad use; to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALY).
METHODS: A cross-sectional study in 331 women with lower urinary tract symptoms 
referred to urogynaecologic examination was conducted. Main outcome measures 
were the scores of King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ), clinical data, and 
KHQ-derived utility values.
RESULTS: A total of 270 women with UI were recruited: 176 (57.3%) using 
continence pads only during the day (group I) and 94 (30.6%) for 24 hours (group 
II). The groups did not differ in terms of age, menopause, parity, type of UI, 
stage of POP-Q, and percentage of sexually active subjects. Group II had 
significantly higher body mass index (BMI) and lower education than group I 
(P < 0.05). QoL was significantly deteriorated in group II in KHQ Global score 
and in all domains except one (General Health). Risk factors for 24 hours pad 
use were as follows: BMI ≥ 30 vs BMI 25-30 (OR = 2.02 (1.09-3.73), P = 0.037), 
higher scores in KHQ Severity measures (OR = 1.03 (1.02-1.04), P < 0.001), KHQ 
Global score (OR = 1.03 (1.02-1.05), P < 0.001) and primary compared to 
secondary (OR = 0.4 (0.19-0.84)) or higher education (OR = 0.41 (0.18-0.94), 
P < 0.05). Annual QALY was significantly lower in group II (0.9288 ± 0.03 vs 
0.9432 ± 0.03, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: One-third of women with UI used continence pads for 24 hours. Among 
these patients QoL and QALY were found lower compared to women using continence 
pads only during the day. KHQ Severity measures domain was an independent 
predictor for a 24-hour usage of continence pads.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease is now a leading cause of death in Fiji. The 
country lacks even basic statistics about the incidence of end-stage kidney 
disease (ESKD) and presents significant challenges to conducting clinical 
research.
AIM: To estimate the incidence and characteristics of ESKD in Fijian adults.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients admitted to 
Colonial War Memorial Hospital in Suva, Fiji, in 2012. Suspected ESKD cases were 
identified from laboratory registers of renal function tests and confirmed 
through medical record review. Population data were from the Fijian Bureau of 
Statistics.
RESULTS: Screening identified 1474 suspected ESKD cases. Following removal of 
763 duplicates and cases with discrepant identifiers, 711 unique cases remained. 
An additional 552 cases met exclusion criteria, including acute kidney injury 
(247), failure to be admitted (131) and pre-existing ESKD diagnosis (103), 
leaving 159 cases of confirmed ESKD. Median age was 57 years (interquartile 
range 47-65). Crude and age-adjusted ESKD incidence rates were 753 per million 
population (pmp) (95% confidence interval (CI) 636-870) and 793 pmp (95% CI 
669-916), respectively, rising to 938 pmp (95% CI 804-1072) if African-American 
correction was removed. Diabetic nephropathy was the most common cause of ESKD 
(65.4%).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of ESKD in Fiji is high. This is a substantial public 
health problem that is likely impacting life expectancy and quality of life. 
Improving screening, detection and management of kidney disease should be given 
more prominence in programmes to address non-communicable diseases in Fiji and 
the Western Pacific.

Territory, Australia.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is a paucity of accurate and current data on 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) trends in incidence and survival in developed 
countries. We performed an Australia-wide assessment of HCC epidemiology across 
a 33-year time span aiming to accurately describe changes in incidence and 
survival.
METHODS: Cases of HCC from 1982 to 2014 were identified via the Australian 
Cancer Database (ACD). Trends in incidence rates were explored using piecewise 
linear regression. Survival was compared by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and 1-, 
3- and 5-year survival probabilities by year of diagnosis.
RESULTS: Age-adjusted HCC incidence rate increased from 1.38 per 100 000 (95% 
CI: 1.34-1.43) in 1982 to 4.96 per 100 000 (95% CI: 4.89-5.03, P < 0.001) in 
2014 with an average annual percentage increase of 4.46% (95% CI: 4.24%-4.69%). 
The highest incidence rate in 2014 was in those aged 75-79 (24.31 per 100 000; 
95% CI: 19.50-29.12). Almost 80% of cases across the period were men who had 
significantly higher age-adjusted incidence rates in 2014 than women (8.55 per 
100 000 [95% CI: 8.42-8.68] vs 1.65 per 100 000 [95% CI: 1.60-1.70]; P < 0.001). 
A hepatitis C (HCV) birth cohort effect was identified and associated with rapid 
increases in HCC incidence when members of the cohort aged and entered into age 
groups 45-49, 50-54 and 55-59. Median survival increased from 2.10 months (95% 
CI: 1.57-2.62 months) in those diagnosed between 1982 and 1984 to 12.07 months 
(95% CI: 11.17-12.97 months) when diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: An Australia-wide analysis of HCC epidemiological trends across 
three decades shows significant and consistent increases in both incidence and 
survival.
LAY SUMMARY: There has been a significant increase in hepatocellular cancer 
(HCC) reported in Australia over the last three decades without evidence of 
slowing. Across the same time period, a significant improvement in survival has 
been identified with the average life expectancy after diagnosis now one year. 
This research lays the foundation for important public health service delivery.

As new cancer treatment regimens demonstrate increased potential to improve 
patients' survival, more focus is directed toward the quality of that extension 
of life and to obtaining additional information from patients regarding their 
experience with treatment. The utility of capturing patient-reported 
treatment-related symptoms to complement traditional clinician-rated symptomatic 
adverse event reporting is well-documented. The National Cancer Institute's 
Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events is an item library aimed at capturing patient-reported symptoms to inform 
the patient perspective on a treatment's tolerability. The U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration has recommended using the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of 
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events in clinical trials. A 
practical guideline is needed to inform a priori selection of specific 
Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events items for use in any given industry-sponsored oncology clinical trial. 
Standardizing this selection process will foster systematic and consistent data 
collection as part of drug development and enhance our knowledge on how to use 
patient-relevant information as part of a treatment's risk/benefit assessment. 
This article presents methods and consensus recommendations for selecting 
specific Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events items to include in early-phase and late-phase oncology 
clinical trials.

Cost, Value, and Financial Hardship in Cancer Care: Implications for Pediatric 
Oncology.

University, Atlanta, GA; American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.

Cancer care in the United States faces a perfect storm: an aging population and 
expected increased cancer incidence, growing numbers of cancer survivors with 
ongoing care needs, and continued scientific advancements, offering 
extraordinary promise at extraordinary cost. How, then, do we as pediatric 
oncologists engage in the dialogue about cancer cost considerations? The purpose 
of this article and its accompanying session presented at the 2018 ASCO Annual 
Meeting is to introduce concepts of cost, value, and financial hardship. In the 
first section, we will provide an overview of principles of health economics, 
including components of cost, time horizon consideration, discounting, and 
methods to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness among therapeutic 
approaches. We will then introduce the value framework being debated in adult 
oncology and offer potential opportunities for its application in pediatric 
oncology. In the second section, we will describe the integration of the 
cost-effectiveness paradigm in an ongoing pediatric clinical trial, including 
design and analytic considerations. In the third section, we will shift away 
from cost to the health care system to cost to the patient, which is also termed 
"financial toxicity" or "financial hardship," focusing on the ongoing burden of 
cost on survivors of childhood cancer. Our goal is to provide our readers with 
the vocabulary and understanding of this complex and often thorny debate so that 
they can be active participants and informed advocates for their patients.
