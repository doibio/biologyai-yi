A number of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) predict increased mortality after 
primary cancer treatment. Studies, though, are sometimes affected by 
methodological limitations. They often use control variables that poorly predict 
life expectancy, examine only one or two PROs thus not controlling potential 
confounding by unmeasured PROs, and observe PROs at only a single point in time. 
To predict all-cause mortality, this study used control variables affording good 
estimates of life expectancy, conducted multivariate analyses of multiple PROs 
to identify independent predictors, and monitored PROs two years after 
diagnosis. We recruited a consecutive sample of 824 patients with uveal melanoma 
between April 2008 and December 2014. PROs were variables shown to predict 
mortality in previous studies; anxiety, depression, visual and ocular symptoms, 
visual function impairment, worry about cancer recurrence, and physical, 
emotional, social and functional quality of life (QoL), measured 6, 12 and 
24 months after diagnosis. We conducted Cox regression analyses with a census 
date of December 2018. Covariates were age, gender, marital and employment 
status, self-reported co-morbidities, tumor diameter and thickness, treatment 
modality and chromosome 3 mutation status, the latter a genetic mutation 
strongly associated with mortality. Single predictor analyses (with covariates), 
showed 6-month depression and poorer functional QoL predicting mortality, as did 
6-12 month increases in anxiety and 6-12 month decreases in physical and 
functional QoL. Multivariate analyses using all PROs showed independent 
prediction by 6-month depression and decreasing QoL over 6-12 months and 
12-24 months. Elevated depression scores six months post-diagnosis constituted 
an increased mortality risk. Early intervention for depressive symptoms may 
reduce mortality.

INTRODUCTION/AIMS: As life expectancy improves for patients with Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy (DMD), new symptoms are likely to arise. This aims of this 
study are: (1) to explore the prevalence of a broad variety of symptoms in the 
various stages of DMD (with and without steroid use); (2) to explore the 
prevalence of common secondary diagnoses; and (3) to evaluate the social 
participation level of patients with DMD older than 16 y of age; and to explore 
correlations between social participation and symptoms.
METHODS: A cross-sectional self-report questionnaire, including questions on 
functional level and health status, as well as a standardized participation 
scale was distributed among Dutch patients with DMD.
RESULTS: Eighty-four male patients with a mean age of 22.0 (SD = 10.0) y were 
enrolled. The most prevalent and limiting symptoms were difficulty coughing 
(58%), coldness of hands (57%), contractures (51%), stiffness (49%), fatigue 
(40%), myalgia (38%), and low speech volume (33%). Prevalent secondary diagnoses 
included cardiac disease (14%), neurobehavioral diagnosis (13%), low blood 
pressure (13%), and arthrosis (5%). Social participation correlated negatively 
with coldness of hands (r = - .29; P < .03), decreased intelligibility 
(r = - .40; P < .003), and chewing problems (r = - .33; P < .02).
DISCUSSION: The prevalence of a broad spectrum of symptoms and secondary 
diagnoses is high in patients with DMD, and some of these symptoms are 
correlated with social participation. Growing awareness of new symptoms and 
secondary diagnoses among patients, caregivers, and professionals can enhance 
their recognition, possibly facilitating prevention and early treatment.

Agricultural expansion and intensification are major drivers of ecosystem 
degradation and loss of biodiversity around the world. Countries are relying on 
protected areas to conserve habitats and prevent species decline, but these are 
either too few, too small, or too disconnected to capture and protect the needs 
of species at risk (SAR). Privately owned and managed lands and agricultural 
producers are increasingly needed to assist with habitat conservation and SAR 
recovery. Uptake of environmentally beneficial management practices (BMPs) by 
producers is often hindered by the lack of awareness of the needs of SAR and of 
the contribution they can make to their habitats, an actual or perceived 
negative economic and operational impact of the necessary management changes, 
the fear of losing management control over their land, and mistrust toward 
public agencies. We present an eight-step model framework that allows 
agricultural producers to privately determine the potential SAR occurring in a 
land parcel of interest and to identify and prioritize mutually compatible and 
outcome-oriented BMPs relevant to these species. In Alberta, Canada, the 
framework resulted in the development of a confidential self-served online 
extension tool tailored to a typical farm-level management unit, and to the 
geographical and ecological context of the operation. We provide a case study 
using a land parcel from the agricultural region of Alberta to illustrate the 
model and the associated tool. This novel approach can alleviate producers 
concerns, promote uptake of BMPs, and foster voluntary stewardship of SAR 
habitats on privately owned or managed lands.

BACKGROUND: Lack of effective early screening is a major obstacle for reducing 
the fatality rate and disease burden of dengue. In light of this, the government 
of Tamil Nadu has adopted a decentralized dengue screening strategy at the 
primary healthcare (PHC) facilities using blood platelet count. Our objective 
was to determine the cost-effectiveness of a decentralized screening strategy 
for dengue at PHC facilities compared with the current strategy at the tertiary 
health facility (THC) level.
METHODS: Decision tree analysis followed a hypothetical cohort of 1000 suspected 
dengue cases entering the model. The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed 
at a 3% discount rate for the proposed and current strategy. The outcomes are 
expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per quality-adjusted 
life years gained. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis were done to check the uncertainty in the outcome.
RESULTS: The proposed strategy was found to be cost-saving and ICER was 
estimated to be -41 197. PSA showed that the proposed strategy had a 0.84 
probability of being an economically dominant strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed strategy is cost-saving, however, it is recommended to 
consider optimal population coverage, costs to economic human resources and 
collateral benefits of equipment.

BACKGROUND: Despite well-established benefits of physical activity for knee 
osteoarthritis (OA), nine of ten people with knee OA are inactive. People with 
knee OA who are inactive often believe that physical activity is dangerous, 
fearing that it will further damage their joint(s). Such unhelpful beliefs can 
negatively influence physical activity levels. We aim to evaluate the clinical- 
and cost-effectiveness of integrating physiotherapist-delivered pain science 
education (PSE), an evidence-based conceptual change intervention targeting 
unhelpful pain beliefs by increasing pain knowledge, with an individualised 
walking, strengthening, and general education program.
METHODS: Two-arm, parallel-design, multicentre randomised controlled trial 
involving 198 people aged ≥50 years with painful knee OA who do not meet 
physical activity guideline recommendations or walk regularly for exercise. Both 
groups receive an individualised physiotherapist-led walking, strengthening, and 
OA/activity education program via 4x weekly in-person treatment sessions, 
followed by 4 weeks of at-home activities (weekly check-in via telehealth), with 
follow-up sessions at 3 months (telehealth) and 5 and 9 months (in-person). The 
EPIPHA-KNEE group also receives contemporary PSE about OA/pain and activity, 
embedded into all aspects of the intervention. Outcomes are assessed at 
baseline, 12 weeks, 6 and 12 months. Primary outcomes are physical activity 
level (step count; wrist-based accelerometry) and self-reported knee symptoms 
(WOMAC Total score) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes are quality of life, pain 
intensity, global rating of change, self-efficacy, pain catastrophising, 
depression, anxiety, stress, fear of movement, knee awareness, OA/activity 
conceptualisation, and self-regulated learning ability. Additional measures 
include adherence, adverse events, blinding success, COVID-19 impact on 
activity, intention to exercise, treatment expectancy/perceived credibility, 
implicit movement/environmental bias, implicit motor imagery, two-point 
discrimination, and pain sensitivity to activity. Cost-utility analysis of the 
EPIPHA-KNEE intervention will be undertaken, in addition to evaluation of 
cost-effectiveness in the context of primary trial outcomes.
DISCUSSION: We will determine whether the integration of PSE into an 
individualised OA education, walking, and strengthening program is more 
effective than receiving the individualised program alone. Findings will inform 
the development and implementation of future delivery of PSE as part of best 
practice for people with knee OA.

OBJECTIVE: Invasive treatment of intermittent claudication (IC) is commonly 
performed, despite limited evidence of its cost effectiveness. IC symptoms are 
mainly caused by atherosclerotic lesions in the superficial femoral artery 
(SFA), and endovascular treatment is performed frequently. The aim of this study 
was to investigate its cost effectiveness vs. non-invasive treatment.
METHODS: One hundred patients with IC due to lesions in the SFA were randomised 
to treatment with primary stenting, best medical treatment (BMT) and exercise 
advice (stent group), or to BMT and exercise advice alone (control group). 
Patients were recruited at seven hospitals in Sweden. For this analysis of cost 
effectiveness after 24 months, 84 patients with data on quality adjusted life 
years (QALY; based on the EuroQol Five Dimensions EQ-5D 3L™ questionnaire) were 
analysed. Patient registry and imputed cost data were used for accumulated costs 
regarding hospitalisation and outpatient visits.
RESULTS: The mean cost per patient was €11 060 in the stent group and €4 787 in 
the control group, resulting in a difference of €6 273 per patient between the 
groups. The difference in mean QALYs between the groups was 0.26, in favour of 
the stent group, which resulted in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of € 23 785 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: The costs associated with primary stenting in the SFA for the 
treatment of IC were higher than for exercise advice and BMT alone. With 
concurrent improvement in health related quality of life, primary stenting was a 
cost effective treatment option according to the Swedish national guidelines 
(ICER < €50 000 - €70 000) and approaching the UK's National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence threshold for willingness to pay (ICER < £20 000 - 
£30 000). From a cost effectiveness standpoint, primary stenting of the SFA can, 
in many countries, be used as an adjunct to exercise training advice, but it 
must be considered that successful implementation of structured exercise 
programmes and longer follow up may alter these findings.

Comment in
    J Urol. 2022 Mar;207(3):712-714.

BACKGROUND: Demographic changes are leading to an increase in geriatric 
urolithiasis patients aged ≥70 yr. Published data regarding their management 
remain sparse. In particular, for the subgroup of patients aged ≥80 yr there is 
a lack of evidence supporting the hypothesis that stone-removing treatment is 
effective, safe, and beneficial.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficiency and safety of stone-removing treatment in 
geriatric urolithiasis patients aged ≥80 yr compared to their younger geriatric 
counterparts aged 70-79 yr against the background of their respective life 
expectancy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data for the study cohort were extracted from 
an institutional review board-approved retrospective database with 325 patients 
aged ≥70 yr (70-79 yr: n = 241; ≥80 yr: n = 84) consecutively admitted to 
hospital because of symptomatic urolithiasis from 2013 to 2018.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Baseline characteristics, outcome 
and follow-up data, and survival were compared using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U 
tests, χ2 tests, Kaplan-Meier estimation, log-rank tests, and Cox regression.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At baseline, the incidence of infected hydronephrosis 
was greater among patients aged ≥80 yr (p < 0.05), whereas the median stone 
burden and Charlson comorbidity index did not differ between the groups. Outcome 
analysis revealed no significant differences in terms of complication, 
stone-free, and 6-mo readmission rates (p > 0.05). Survival analysis for the two 
groups demonstrated a 2-yr overall survival (OS) rate of 0.91 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.75-1) for patients aged ≥80 yr and 0.97 (95% CI 0.88-1), for 
those aged 70-79 yr (p < 0.01). Multivariable Cox analysis revealed age ≥80 yr 
(hazard ratio [HR] 3.3, 95% CI 1.3-8.5) and infected hydronephrosis (HR 2.8, 95% 
CI 1.0-7.8) as predictors of all-cause mortality (p < 0.05). The study is 
limited by its retrospective design.
CONCLUSIONS: Stone-removing treatment for patients aged ≥80 yr proved to be as 
effective and safe as for patients in their seventies. Although characterized by 
shorter remaining life expectancy, excellent 2-yr OS for patients aged ≥80 yr 
supports the hypothesis of equal benefit from stone-removing treatment when 
compared to septuagenarians.
PATIENT SUMMARY: There is a lack of evidence supporting the benefit of urinary 
stone-removing treatment for patients older than 80 yr. Our study included 
geriatric patients older than 70 yr with symptomatic urinary stone disease for 
which urinary drainage or stone removal is indicated. We compared treatment 
outcomes and survival between two age groups: patients aged 70-79 yr and those 
aged 80 yr or older. We found equivalent outcomes for the two groups and 
excellent 2-yr overall survival of 91% for those older than 80 yr. The study 
strengthens the evidence that active stone-removing therapy is safe and 
beneficial for these patients.

Global environmental awareness has encouraged further research towards biofuel 
production and consumption. Despite the favorable properties of biofuels, the 
sustainability of their conventional production pathways from agricultural 
feedstocks has been questioned. Therefore, the use of non-food feedstocks as a 
promising approach to ensure sustainable biofuel production is encouraged. 
However, the use of synthetic solvents/chemicals and energy carriers during 
biofuel production and the consequent adverse environmental effects are still 
challenging. On the other hand, biofuel production is also associated with 
generating large volumes of waste and wastewater. Accordingly, the circular 
bioeconomy as an innovative approach to ensure complete valorization of 
feedstocks and generated waste streams under the biorefinery scheme is proposed. 
In line with that, the current study aims to assess the environmental 
sustainability of bioethanol production in a safflower-based biorefinery using 
the life cycle assessment framework. Based on the obtained results, safflower 
production and its processing into 1 MJ bioethanol under the safflower-based 
biorefinery led to damage of 2.23E-07 disability-adjusted life years (DALY), 
2.35E-02 potentially disappeared fraction (PDF)*m2*yr, 4.76E-01 kg CO2 eq., and 
3.82 MJ primary on the human health, ecosystem quality, climate change, and 
resources, respectively. Moreover, it was revealed that despite adverse 
environmental effects associated with safflower production and processing, the 
substitution of conventional products, i.e., products that are the typical 
products in the market without having environmental criteria, with their 
bio-counterparts, i.e., products produced in the biorefinery based on 
environmental criteria could overshadow the unfavorable effects and 
substantially enhance the overall sustainability of the biorefinery system. The 
developed safflower-based biorefinery led to seven- and two-time reduction in 
damage to the ecosystem quality and resources damage categories, respectively. 
The reductions in damage to human health and climate change were also found to 
be 52% and 24%, respectively. The weighted environmental impacts of the 
safflower-based biorefinery decreased by 64% due to the production of 
bioproducts, mainly biodiesel and biogas, replacing their fossil-based 
counterparts, i.e., diesel and natural gas, respectively. Finally, although the 
main focus of the developed safflower-based biorefinery was biofuel production, 
waste valorization and mainly animal feed played a significant role in improving 
the associated environmental impacts.

Improving life expectancy necessitates prevention and early diagnosis of any 
disease state based on active self-monitoring of symptoms and longitudinal 
biochemical profiling. Non-invasive and continuous measurement of molecular 
biomarkers that reflect metabolism and health must however be established to 
realize this plan. Human samples non-invasively obtained via the skin are 
suitable in this context for in-situ biochemical monitoring. We present a brief 
classification of transdermal sampling in aqueous and gaseous phases and then 
introduce a new generation of transdermal monitoring devices for rapid and 
accurate assessment of important parameters. Finally, we have summarized the 
diversity of body-wide skin characteristics that have possible effects for 
transdermal sampling. Because of its passive nature, in-situ biochemical 
monitoring via transdermal sampling will potentially lead to a greater 
understanding of important biochemical markers and their temporal variation.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of supplemental short-protocol 
brain MRI after negative non-contrast CT for the detection of minor strokes in 
emergency patients with mild and unspecific neurological symptoms.
METHODS: The economic evaluation was centered around a prospective single-center 
diagnostic accuracy study validating the use of short-protocol brain MRI in the 
emergency setting. A decision-analytic Markov model distinguished the strategies 
"no additional imaging" and "additional short-protocol MRI" for evaluation. 
Minor stroke was assumed to be missed in the initial evaluation in 40% of 
patients without short-protocol MRI. Specialized post-stroke care with immediate 
secondary prophylaxis was assumed for patients with detected minor stroke. 
Utilities and quality-of-life measures were estimated as quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs). Input parameters were obtained from the literature. The Markov 
model simulated a follow-up period of up to 30 years. Willingness to pay was set 
to $100,000 per QALY. Cost-effectiveness was calculated and deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Additional short-protocol MRI was the dominant strategy with overall 
costs of $26,304 (CT only: $27,109). Cumulative calculated effectiveness in the 
CT-only group was 14.25 QALYs (short-protocol MRI group: 14.31 QALYs). In the 
deterministic sensitivity analysis, additional short-protocol MRI remained the 
dominant strategy in all investigated ranges. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
results from the base case analysis were confirmed, and additional 
short-protocol MRI resulted in lower costs and higher effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: Additional short-protocol MRI in emergency patients with mild and 
unspecific neurological symptoms enables timely secondary prophylaxis through 
detection of minor strokes, resulting in lower costs and higher cumulative 
QALYs.
KEY POINTS: • Short-protocol brain MRI after negative head CT in selected 
emergency patients with mild and unspecific neurological symptoms allows for 
timely detection of minor strokes. • This strategy supports clinical 
decision-making with regard to immediate initiation of secondary prophylactic 
treatment, potentially preventing subsequent major strokes with associated high 
costs and reduced QALY. • According to the Markov model, additional 
short-protocol MRI remained the dominant strategy over wide variations of input 
parameters, even when assuming disproportionally high costs of the supplemental 
MRI scan.

Endosymbiont-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) may play an important role 
in arthropod speciation. However, whether CI consistently becomes associated or 
coupled with other host-related forms of reproductive isolation (RI) to impede 
the transfer of endosymbionts between hybridizing populations and further the 
divergence process remains an open question. Here, we show that varying degrees 
of pre- and postmating RI exist among allopatric populations of two 
interbreeding cherry-infesting tephritid fruit flies (Rhagoletis cingulata and 
R. indifferens) across North America. These flies display allochronic and sexual 
isolation among populations, as well as unidirectional reductions in egg hatch 
in hybrid crosses involving southwestern USA males. All populations are infected 
by a Wolbachia strain, wCin2, whereas a second strain, wCin3, only co-infects 
flies from the southwest USA and Mexico. Strain wCin3 is associated with a 
unique mitochondrial DNA haplotype and unidirectional postmating RI, implicating 
the strain as the cause of CI. When coupled with nonendosymbiont RI barriers, we 
estimate the strength of CI associated with wCin3 would not prevent the strain 
from introgressing from infected southwestern to uninfected populations 
elsewhere in the USA if populations were to come into secondary contact and 
hybridize. In contrast, cytoplasmic-nuclear coupling may impede the transfer of 
wCin3 if Mexican and USA populations were to come into contact. We discuss our 
results in the context of the general paucity of examples demonstrating stable 
Wolbachia hybrid zones and whether the spread of Wolbachia among taxa can be 
constrained in natural hybrid zones long enough for the endosymbiont to 
participate in speciation.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation for the 
treatment of subjective tinnitus using different modalities of cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) in Australia.
DESIGN: A decision tree model was used to conduct a cost-utility analysis for 
CBT to determine the cost effectiveness for tinnitus treatments, in terms of 
cost per responder and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), from a health 
system perspective using a 2-year time horizon. Meta-analysis was used to 
differentiate the levels of effectiveness between three delivery methods for 
CBT: individual face-to-face care (fCBT), group sessions (gCBT), and a supported 
internet program (iCBT). One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA) explored the uncertainty surrounding model inputs and 
outcomes. Results were presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
compared with no treatment, and as net monetary benefit at a $50,000 
willingness-to-pay threshold.
RESULTS: Compared with no treatment, the incremental cost per responder was $700 
for gCBT, $871 for iCBT, and $1380 for fCBT. The base case incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $35,363 per QALY for fCBT, $17,935 per QALY for 
gCBT, and $22,321 per QALY for iCBT compared with no treatment, although there 
was substantial uncertainty around the QALY gain for responders. Net monetary 
benefit was $356 (fCBT), $555 (gCBT), and $487 (iCBT), indicating the treatments 
were cost effective compared with no treatment. One-way sensitivity analysis 
revealed the results were most sensitive to the probability of a positive 
response to treatment and treatment length. The PSA found the probability of 
being cost effective compared with no treatment for gCBT was 99.8%, iCBT 98.4%, 
and fCBT 71.5% at a willingness-to-pay of $50,000 per QALY, although QALY gain 
remained at a fixed value in the PSA.
CONCLUSIONS: CBT for tinnitus was likely to be cost effective compared with no 
treatment regardless of treatment modality, assuming they are not mutually 
exclusive. Of the interventions, gCBT was the lowest cost per responder and 
lowest cost per QALY. Internet CBT obtained comparable economic outcomes due to 
similar treatment effectiveness and cost. Group CBT and iCBT warrant greater 
adoption in clinical practice for the treatment of subjective tinnitus. Further 
research on preference-based utility measures for varying levels of tinnitus 
severity and the durability of treatment effect is required to enhance the 
quality of economic evaluation in this field.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes recent developments in 
cognitive-behavioural therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED). More specifically, 
the past five years were covered, with the latest UK and Dutch guidelines for 
eating disorders as a starting benchmark, and with special consideration of the 
past 18 months.
RECENT FINDINGS: The new research can be divided into findings that have: (1) 
reinforced our existing understanding of CBT-ED's models and impact; (2) 
advanced our understanding and the utility of CBT-ED, including its application 
for the 'new' disorder Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID); (3) 
suggested new directions, which require further exploration in clinical and 
research terms. These include learning from the circumstances of the COVID-19 
pandemic.
SUMMARY: CBT-ED has developed substantially in the past 5 years, with 
consolidation of its existing evidence base, further support for real-life 
implementation, extension of methods used, and the development of new approaches 
for working with younger people - particularly in the form of treatments for 
ARFID. Over the past 18 months, even more promising changes in delivery occurred 
in response to the COVID19 pandemic, showing that we can adapt our methods in 
order to work effectively via remote means. Challenges remain regarding poor 
outcomes for anorexia nervosa.

The rise in life expectancy of humans, COVID-19 pandemic and growing cost of 
medical services has brought up huge challenges for the government and 
healthcare industry. Due to unhealthy lifestyle, there is an increased need for 
continual health monitoring and diagnosis of diseases. Wireless Body Area 
Network (WBAN) is attracted attention of researchers as various biosensors can 
be embedded in or worn on the body of human beings for the measurement of health 
parameters. The patient's health data is then sent wirelessly to the physician 
for health analysis. The biosensors used to measure physiological parameters 
have limited power due to its small size and hence smaller form factor. For the 
longevity of the network, it is imperative to transmit the data in an 
energy-efficient manner. Moreover, the health information of the patient is 
stringently private. Hence, the privacy and security of transmitted information 
needs to be ensured. It necessitates the development of effective, lightweight 
and secure routing protocols that provides security with minimal use of 
resources. This paper has identified the numerous security requirements in WBANs 
and has provided the extensive review on existing secure routing protocols 
reported in the literature. A comparative analysis of the various existing 
state-of-the art secure routing protocols and critical analysis based on 
security techniques along with different performance parameters has been 
presented.

Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) was once highly prevalent across eastern Australia, 
resulting in epidemics of dengue fever. Drought conditions have led to a rapid 
rise in semi-permanent, urban water storage containers called rainwater tanks 
known to be critical larval habitat for the species. The presence of these 
larval habitats has increased the risk of establishment of highly urbanised, 
invasive mosquito vectors such as Ae. aegypti. Here we use a spatially explicit 
network model to examine the role that unsealed rainwater tanks may play in 
population connectivity of an Ae. aegypti invasion in suburbs of Brisbane, a 
major Australian city. We characterise movement between rainwater tanks as a 
diffusion-like process, limited by a maximum distance of movement, average life 
expectancy, and a probability that Ae. aegypti will cross wide open spaces such 
as roads. The simulation model was run against a number of scenarios that 
examined population spread through the rainwater tank network based on 
non-compliance rates of tanks (unsealed or sealed) and road grids. We show that 
Ae. aegypti tank infestation and population spread was greatest in areas of high 
tank density and road lengths were shortest e.g. cul-de-sacs. Rainwater tank 
non-compliance rates of over 30% show increased connectivity when compared to 
less than 10%, suggesting rainwater tanks non-compliance should be maintained 
under this level to minimize the spread of an invading Ae. aegypti population. 
These results presented as risk maps of Ae. aegypti spread across Brisbane, can 
assist health and government authorities on where to optimally target rainwater 
tank surveillance and educational activities.

BACKGROUND: An evaluation of the outcome after pancreatic surgery with focus on 
post-operative and late survival in elderly patients was performed.
METHODS: The study included 1.556 patients from a single HBP unit operated from 
1. January 2010 to 31. December 2019. Patients were divided into two cohorts, < 
75 years (n = 1.296) and ≥75 years (n = 260). Post-operative outcome was 
evaluated in all patients and late outcome in patients with adenocarcinoma in 
the pancreas (n = 765) and the duodenum (n = 117). The follow-up of patients 
with benign disease and adenocarcinoma was 57.95 (12.1-132.7) and 39.85 
(12.0-131.7) months, respectively.
RESULTS: Length of hospital-stay and surgical complications were not 
significantly different in the two cohorts, but in-hospital death was 1.1% (<75 
years) and 3.5% (≥75 years) (p = 0.008). The median overall survival of 
adenocarcinoma was 29.7 (<75 years) and 24.3 months (≥75 years) (p = 0.3228) 
with a one, two, and five-years survival of 74.5%, 56.6% and 28.6% vs. 73.6%, 
51.1%, and 25.5%. Median time to relapse (46.2% of patients <75 years and 40.5% 
of patients ≥75 years) was 9 (1 - 51) and 8 (1 - 78) months (p = 0.534), 
respectively. Adjuvant chemotherapy did not have impact on the survival of the 
old cohort. Patients who died during the observation period had lost 94% (<75 
years) and 87% (≥75 years) of expected remnant life. Estimated years lost in the 
old cohort was 4.2 in males and 4.9 in females (p = 0.025).
CONCLUSION: Elderly patients may undergo pancreatic surgery with a low mortality 
and for adenocarcinoma with an acceptable long-term survival.

Aims: The present report aims to investigate the use of Kampo medicine for 
advanced pancreatic cancer patients in order to prolong survival. Methods: We 
retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with pancreatic cancer who 
presented to our Shimizu Clinic from 2000 to 2020. Patients who survived at 
least twice as long as the initial prognostic estimate were selected and their 
treatment was reviewed. The Kampo formula and crude drugs were selected 
according to the Kampo diagnosis and treatment strategy, which included qi and 
blood supplementation; qi, blood and water smoothing; and inflammation (termed 
"heat") and cancer suppression. Results: Ten patients aged 45-80 years (six 
males and four females) with stage IV advanced cancer were selected. All 
patients received hozai, which is a tonic formula, of juzentaihoto (JTT) or 
hochuekkito (HET) decoction. Anti-cancer crude drugs were included in the 
decoctions of nine patients. At the first visit, the estimated life expectancy 
for all patients was no more than 1 year; however, treatment with Western and 
Kampo medicine led to a relatively long survival period of over 2 years. Three
