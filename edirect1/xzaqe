formally not reached with 800mg/week, the treatment discontinuation due to 
diarrhoea and vomiting likely related to perifosine in two cases led to the 
decision to stop further dose escalation. Pharmacokinetics after a single dose 
were median t(max)=8.0-24.2h, median t(1/2)=81.0-115.9h and mean(geo) 
CL/f=0.28-0.43mL/min/kg. Urinary excretion was below 1%. Perifosine slightly 
accumulated and steady state was nearly reached after 2-3weeks.
CONCLUSION: Oral perifosine was tolerable up to 600mg/week in cancer patients 
when administered with meal and prophylactic antiemetics. Based on its half-life 
of about 4days, a weekly regimen may be appropriate.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate which strategy is the most 
cost-effective for the prevention of preterm birth and associated morbidity.
STUDY DESIGN: We used decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness analyses to 
estimate which of 4 strategies was superior based on quality-adjusted 
life-years, cost in US dollars, and number of preterm births prevented.
RESULTS: Universal sonographic screening for cervical length and treatment with 
vaginal progesterone was the most cost-effective strategy and was the dominant 
choice over the 3 alternatives: cervical length screening for women at increased 
risk for preterm birth and treatment with vaginal progesterone; risk-based 
treatment with 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHP-C) without 
screening; no screening or treatment. Universal screening represented savings of 
$1339 ($8325 vs $9664), when compared with treatment with 17-OHP-C, and led to a 
reduction of 95,920 preterm births annually in the United States.
CONCLUSION: Universal sonographic screening for short cervical length and 
treatment with vaginal progesterone appears to be cost-effective and yields the 
greatest reduction in preterm birth at <34 weeks' gestation.

[Prerequisites to the administration and prevention of adverse effects of 
chemotherapy in colorectal cancer].

Some general and specific, statutory, clinical and biological parameters have to 
be taken into account before beginning chemotherapy in colorectal cancer to 
ensure maximal safety. Statutorily the prescription is reserved to specialised 
or competent physicians in oncology in some accredited institutions. It is 
essential to conform to indications, contraindications and posology, and to have 
a good knowledge of safety measures, drug interactions and side effects. 
Patients, family members and general practitioners should be informed about side 
effects, without forgetting some thematics (sexuality, fertility, contraception, 
vaccines, driving). This information should be simple, adapted and "reassuring", 
but should focus on symptoms indicating a serious toxic side effect. The message 
can be optimized by nurse consultation, transmission of the individualized care 
plan and linkage notebook, such as oral chemotherapies (capecitabine, UFT). The 
computerized and standardized prescription is done after infusion line 
inspection, clinical examination (global health status, nutritional status and 
buccodental status) and review of relevant pathological, radiological and 
biological data. Management of side effects includes patient education, 
appropriate premedication and prescription of prophylactic supportive care. Some 
specific preventive measures can attenuate the cutaneous side effects of EGFR 
inhibitors and the oxaliplatine-induced sensory neurotoxicity. Life expectancy, 
comorbidities, level of dependence, and if possible the comprehensive geriatric 
assessment should be taken into account for elderly patients. Prescription 
should be individualized and adapted to liver biology (irinotecan), kidney 
function (capecitabine and raltitrexed) and cardiovascular status (bevacizumab, 
5-FU, capecitabin). Some molecular biologic prerequisites are indicated: 
detection of tumor KRAS-BRAF mutation before anti-EGFR and tumor 
microsatelliteinstability status before 5-FU in stage II cancers. Clinical 
relevance of others pretherapeutic molecularparameters are still being 
evaluated: UGT1A1 genotyping before irinotecan and detection of 
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency before fluoropyrimidines.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the survival rates of subjects aged 95 or over after a 
follow-up period of 3 years, and to determine predictive factors for mortality 
risk.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort study.
SETTING: A community-based study.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight subjects aged 95 or over.
MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic data, Barthel Index, Lawton-Brody Index, Spanish 
version of the Mini-Mental State Examination, short version of the Mini 
Nutritional Assessment, comorbidity (Charlson Index), and prevalent chronic 
diseases were evaluated. Patients who died were compared with the rest.
RESULTS: Thirty-six deaths (75%) were recorded during follow-up. The Cox 
multivariate analysis showed that lower Barthel Index scores and a history of 
heart failure were independently associated with long-term mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In subjects aged 95 or over, poor functional status and history of 
heart failure were the two independent risk factors for 3-year mortality.

The increasing life expectancy in our society results in a continuously growing 
number of patients suffering from neurodegenerative disorders, particularly 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Apart from the deleterious consequences for patients 
and their relatives, this issue has also alarming effects on our social systems. 
These facts have justified increased scientific efforts regarding the 
identification of basic pathomechanisms of dementia and the development of new 
treatment options. Increased production of specific proteins and their 
pathologic aggregation in the brain appears to be a pathomechanism which occurs 
early in the course of many different neurodegenerative diseases. Among the most 
well-known of these protein aggregations are amyloid plaques, which arise from 
the aggregation of the β-amyloid protein. Currently, this amyloid-aggregation 
pathology is regarded as a key pathology, playing a causal role in the 
development of AD. Consequently, modern therapy approaches are directed towards 
this target. Limited access to brain tissue has so far restricted the definite 
diagnosis of AD to postmortem histopathological assessment of brain tissue. For 
the same reason, a clear association between extent of amyloid deposition 
pathology and clinical course of AD has not been established so far. However, 
particularly with regard to new therapeutic options, a reliable in vivo 
diagnosis is required. Modern molecular imaging tracers such as [11C]PIB do now 
open the possibility to visualize amyloid depositions in vivo, using positron 
emission tomography. This type of "in vivo histopathology" approach allows the 
characterization of neurodegenerative disorders on the basis of the underlying 
pathology rather than on their symptomatic appearance. In this manuscript, we 
will discuss the options of amyloid-plaque imaging regarding early and 
differential diagnosis of different forms of dementia as well as for patient 
selection for therapy trials and for objective therapy monitoring.

OBJECTIVES: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a liver disease which, if untreated, 
may lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatic failure. Limited data exist regarding 
factors predicting the long-term outcome. The aims of this study were to 
investigate symptoms at presentation, prognostic features, management and 
treatment in relation to long-term outcome of AIH.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort of 473 Swedish patients with AIH was 
characterized regarding initial symptoms and signs, factors predicting death and 
future need for liver transplantation. Survival and causes of death were 
retrieved from Swedish national registers.
RESULTS: At diagnosis, fatigue was a predominant symptom (69%), 47% of the 
patients were jaundiced and 30% had liver cirrhosis. Another 10% developed 
cirrhosis during follow-up. Markedly elevated alanine aminotransferase levels at 
presentation were correlated with a better outcome. A high international 
normalized ratio (INR) at diagnosis was the only risk factor predicting a need 
for later liver transplantation. Histological cirrhosis, decompensation and 
non-response to initial treatment were all factors that correlated with a worse 
outcome. Overall life expectancy was generally favourable. However, most deaths 
were liver-related, e.g. liver failure, shock and gastrointestinal bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Cirrhosis at diagnosis, a non-response to initial 
immune-suppressive treatment or elevated INR values were associated with worse 
outcome and a need for later liver transplantation. In contrast, an acute 
hepatitis-like onset with intact synthetic capacity indicated a good response to 
treatment and favourable long-term prognosis. Lifetime maintenance therapy is 
most often required.

BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of collaborative care for patients with major 
depressive disorder in primary care has been established. Assessing its 
cost-effectiveness is important for deciding on implementation. This review 
therefore evaluates the cost-effectiveness of collaborative care for major 
depressive disorder in primary care.
METHODS: A systematic search on economic evaluations of collaborative care was 
conducted in Pubmed and PsychInfo. Quality of the studies was measured with the 
Cochrane checklist and the CHEC-list for economic evaluations. 
Cost-effectiveness and costs per depression-free days were reported.
RESULTS: 8 studies were found, involving 4868 patients. The quality of the cost 
effectiveness studies, according to the CHEC-list, could be improved. Generally, 
the studies did not include all relevant costs and did not perform sensitivity 
analysis. Only 4 out of 8 studies reported cost per QALY, 6 out of 8 reported 
costs per depression-free days. The highest costs per QALY reported were 
$49,500, the highest costs per depression-free day were $24.
CONCLUSIONS: Although studies did not fulfil all criteria of the CHEC-list, 
collaborative care is a promising intervention and it may be cost-effective. 
However, to conclude on the cost-effectiveness, depression research should 
follow economic guidelines to improve the quality of the economic evaluations.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) compared with white light cystoscopy (WLC), and 
urine biomarkers [fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), ImmunoCyt, NMP22] 
and cytology for the detection and follow-up of bladder cancer.
DATA SOURCES: Major electronic databases including MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, 
EMBASE, BIOSIS, Science Citation Index, Health Management Information Consortium 
and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched until April 2008.
REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was carried out according 
to standard methods. An economic model was constructed to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of alternative diagnostic and follow-up strategies for the 
diagnosis and management of patients with bladder cancer.
RESULTS: In total, 27 studies reported PDD test performance. In pooled estimates 
[95% confidence interval (CI)] for patient-level analysis, PDD had higher 
sensitivity than WLC [92% (80% to 100%) versus 71% (49% to 93%)] but lower 
specificity [57% (36% to 79%) versus 72% (47% to 96%)]. Similar results were 
found for biopsy-level analysis. The median sensitivities (range) of PDD and WLC 
for detecting lower risk, less aggressive tumours were similar for patient-level 
detection [92% (20% to 95%) versus 95% (8% to 100%)], but sensitivity was higher 
for PDD than for WLC for biopsy-level detection [96% (88% to 100%) versus 88% 
(74% to 100%)]. For more aggressive, higher-risk tumours the median sensitivity 
of PDD for both patient-level [89% (6% to 100%)] and biopsy-level [99% (54% to 
100%)] detection was higher than those of WLC [56% (0% to 100%) and 67% (0% to 
100%) respectively]. Four RCTs comparing PDD with WLC reported effectiveness 
outcomes. PDD use at transurethral resection of bladder tumour resulted in fewer 
residual tumours at check cystoscopy [relative risk, RR, 0.37 (95% CI 0.20 to 
0.69)] and longer recurrence-free survival [RR 1.37 (95% CI 1.18 to 1.59)] 
compared with WLC. In 71 studies reporting the performance of biomarkers and 
cytology in detecting bladder cancer, sensitivity (95% CI) was highest for 
ImmunoCyt [84% (77% to 91%)] and lowest for cytology [44% (38% to 51%)], whereas 
specificity was highest for cytology [96% (94% to 98%)] and lowest for ImmunoCyt 
[75% (68% to 83%)]. In the cost-effectiveness analysis the most effective 
strategy in terms of true positive cases (44) and life-years (11.66) [flexible 
cystoscopy (CSC) and ImmunoCyt followed by PDD in initial diagnosis and CSC 
followed by WLC in follow-up] had an incremental cost per life-year of over 
270,000 pounds. The least effective strategy [cytology followed by WLC in 
initial diagnosis (average cost over 20 years 1403 pounds, average life 
expectancy 11.59)] was most likely to be considered cost-effective when 
society's willingness to pay was less than 20,000 pounds per life-year. No 
strategy was cost-effective more than 50% of the time, but four of the eight 
strategies in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (three involving a 
biomarker or PDD) were each associated with a 20% chance of being considered 
cost-effective. In sensitivity analyses the results were most sensitive to the 
pretest probability of disease (5% in the base case).
CONCLUSIONS: The advantages of PDD's higher sensitivity in detecting bladder 
cancer have to be weighed against the disadvantages of a higher false-positive 
rate. Taking into account the assumptions made in the model, strategies 
involving biomarkers and/or PDD provide additional benefits at a cost that 
society might be willing to pay. Strategies replacing WLC with PDD provide more 
life-years but it is unclear whether they are worth the extra cost.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to project clinical outcomes, health care 
costs, and cost-effectiveness of coronary computed tomography angiography 
(CCTA), as compared with conventional diagnostic technologies, in the evaluation 
of patients with stable chest pain and suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).
BACKGROUND: CCTA has recently been found to be effective in the evaluation of 
patients with suspected CAD, but investigators have raised concerns related to 
radiation exposure, incidental findings, and nondiagnostic exams.
METHODS: With published data, we developed a computer simulation model to 
project clinical outcomes, health care costs, and cost-effectiveness of CCTA, 
compared with conventional testing modalities, in the diagnosis of CAD. Our 
target population included 55-year-old patients who present to their primary 
care physicians with stable chest pain.
RESULTS: All diagnostic strategies yielded similar health outcomes, but 
performing CCTA-with or without stress testing or performing stress 
single-photon emission computed tomography-marginally minimized adverse events 
and maximized longevity and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Health outcomes 
associated with these strategies were comparable, with CCTA in men and women 
yielding the greatest QALYs but only by modest margins. Overall differences were 
small, and performing the most effective test-compared with the least 
effective-decreased adverse event rates by 3% in men and women. Comparable 
increases in longevity and QALYs were 2 months and 0.1 QALYs in men and 1 month 
and 0.03 QALYs in women. CCTA raised overall costs, partly through the follow-up 
of incidental findings, and when performed with stress testing, its incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $26,200/QALY in men to $35,000/QALY in 
women. Health outcomes were marginally less favorable in women when radiation 
risks were considered.
CONCLUSIONS: CCTA is comparable to other diagnostic studies and might hold good 
clinical value, but large randomized controlled trials are needed to guide 
policy.

Programs, Parkinson Society British Columbia, Canada. carmendueck@me.com

A confluence of variables in Parkinson's disease results in Parkinson's informal 
caregivers facing tremendous challenges. Factors include: motor and non-motor 
symptoms, staging, rate of progression and increased life expectancy of people 
with Parkinson's (PwP) due to effective drug therapy and surgery. Informal 
caregivers may have to cope with dispersed family members, and a lack of 
centralized disease specific healthcare support alongside shrinking healthcare 
budgets and resources. These variables demonstrate the need to strategically 
address the unmet needs of the informal caregiver. Expectations placed on 
caregivers by themselves, the PwP, family members (often absent) and the 
healthcare system can threaten their physical and mental health, giving rise to 
the question: Who cares for the caregiver? In answering this question, this 
article discusses the needs of caregivers, presents various models of 
caregiving, and considers the nature of caregiver interventions.

OBJECTIVE: To create a decision analytic model to estimate the balance between 
treatment risks and benefits for patients with morbid obesity.
DESIGN: Decision analytic Markov state transition model with multiple logistic 
regression models as inputs. Data from the 2005 National Inpatient Survey were 
used to calculate in-hospital mortality risk associated with bariatric surgery 
and then adjusted for 30-day mortality. To calculate excess mortality associated 
with obesity, we used the 1991-1996 National Health Interview Survey linked to 
the National Death Index. Bariatric surgery was assumed to influence mortality 
only through its impact on the excess mortality associated with obesity, and the 
efficacy of surgery was estimated from a recent large observational trial.
INTERVENTION: Gastric bypass surgery. Main Outcome Measure Life expectancy.
RESULTS: Our base case, a 42-year-old woman with a body mass index of 45, gained 
an additional 2.95 years of life expectancy with bariatric surgery. No surgical 
treatment was favored in our base case when the 30-day surgical mortality 
exceeded 9.5% (baseline 30-day mortality, 0.2%) or when the efficacy of 
bariatric surgery for reducing mortality decreased to 2% or less (baseline 
efficacy, 53%).
CONCLUSIONS: The optimal decision for individual patients varies based on the 
balance of risk between perioperative mortality, excess annual mortality risk 
associated with increasing body mass index, and the efficacy of surgery; 
however, for the average morbidly obese patient, gastric bypass improves life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Although treating to lipid targets ("treat to target") is widely 
recommended for coronary artery disease (CAD) prevention, some have advocated 
administering fixed doses of statins based on a person's estimated net benefit 
("tailored treatment").
OBJECTIVE: To examine how a tailored treatment approach to statin therapy 
compares with a treat-to-target approach.
DESIGN: Simulated model of population-level effects of treat-to-target and 
tailored treatment approaches to statin therapy.
DATA SOURCES: Statin trials from 1994 to 2009 and nationally representative CAD 
risk factor data.
TARGET POPULATION: U.S. persons aged 30 to 75 years with no history of 
myocardial infarction.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime effects of 5 years of treatment.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal and patient.
INTERVENTION: Tailored treatment based on a person's 5-year CAD risk 
(simvastatin, 40 mg, for 5% to 15% CAD risk and atorvastatin, 40 mg, for CAD 
risk >15%) versus treat-to-target approaches that escalate statin dose per 
National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP] III guidelines (including an 
intensive approach that advances treatment whenever intensification is optional 
by NCEP III criteria).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with the standard NCEP III approach, the 
intensive NCEP III approach treated 15 million more persons and saved 570,000 
more QALYs over 5 years. The tailored strategy treated a similar number of 
persons, as did the intensive NCEP III approach, but saved 500,000 more QALYs 
and treated fewer persons with high-dose statins.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: No circumstances were found in which a 
treat-to-target approach was preferable to tailored treatment.
LIMITATION: Model assumptions were based on available clinical data, which 
included few persons 75 years or older.
CONCLUSION: A tailored treatment strategy prevents more CAD events while 
treating fewer persons with high-dose statins than low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol-based target approaches. Results were robust, even with assumptions 
favoring a treat-to-target approach.

Metabolic abnormalities, antiretroviral therapy and cardiovascular disease in 
elderly patients with HIV.

One of the most recent phenomena related to the acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome (AIDS) is the emergence of a new vulnerable population: the elderly. 
One of the factors that account for this increase is the development of 
combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), which has provided better quality of 
life and life expectancy for HIV-positive patients. However, ART is associated 
with adverse effects such as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and insulin 
resistance, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Due to the impact 
of ART on lipid and glucose metabolism, many studies were published involving 
HIV infection and cardiovascular disease, as well as their risk factors and the 
use of ART, but few of them reported on the cardiotoxicity of this therapy in 
the elderly. The objective of this study is to review the main metabolic changes 
caused by the use of antiretroviral therapy and its impact on an increased risk 
of cardiovascular disease in elderly people with HIV.

PURPOSE: To elicit preference values for health states associated with Stage III 
colon cancer (CRC) and to explore the effect of neuropathy associated with 
current adjuvant treatment.
METHODS: We used time trade-off (TTO) techniques to elicit preferences from 49 
CRC patients and 49 community members. We elicited preferences for 7 health 
states: remission; adjuvant therapy with no, mild, moderate, and severe 
neuropathy; metastatic stable; and metastatic progressive disease. Mean TTO 
values were adjusted for the covariates age, education, and current health.
RESULTS: Patients' adjusted mean TTO value for remission was 0.83; adjuvant 
chemotherapy health states ranged from 0.48 to 0.61. Significant differences 
were observed for both patient and community groups between TTO for remission 
and all adjuvant health states (P < 0.001), and between adjuvant therapy with no 
neuropathy and metastatic health states (P < or = 0.001). Across all health 
states, patients' values were on average 0.12 higher than community members (P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the trade-offs between the disutility of 
adjuvant treatment, the higher utility of remission, and the severe utility loss 
during metastatic disease. The preference values obtained from this study will 
be useful for informing patients' treatment decisions and payer cost-utility 
analyses of adjuvant treatment for colon cancer.

PURPOSE: This study examined relationships between health-related quality of 
life (HRQOL) and objective assessments of habitual physical activity in older 
adults, focusing on interactions between the amount and intensity of activity.
METHODS: Subjects were healthy Japanese aged 65-85 years (74 men and 109 women). 
Pedometer/accelerometers measured their step counts and the intensity of 
physical activity in metabolic equivalents (METs) continuously 24 h per day for 
1 year. Each individual's final HRQOL was assessed using the Medical Outcomes 
Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) instrument.
RESULTS: The daily step count and the daily duration of physical activity at an 
intensity >3 METs were quite closely correlated (quadratic r2 = 0.93, P < 0.05). 
After controlling for age, sex, and daily step count, the overall SF-36 score 
and four constituent dimensions (physical functioning, freedom from pain, 
vitality, and mental health) were all significantly higher in individuals 
spending >25% of their total activity at an intensity >3 METs. However, 
engagement in activity >3 METs was not significantly associated with the 
remaining SF-36 components (physical limitations, general health, social 
functioning, and emotional limitations).
CONCLUSIONS: Associations between moderate-intensity physical activity and HRQOL 
in older adults merit further evaluation by prospective studies and/or 
randomized controlled trials.

Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. Shannon@mgh-ita.org

PURPOSE: The effects of testing and screening on quality of life may influence 
the future behavior of society, but have not been quantified. We derived a 
health classification and survey items for the morbidities of testing and 
screening, to be the foundation of a multiattribute utility instrument, the 
Temporary Utilities Index.
METHODS: Seventy-six women ranked the importance of attributes of the testing 
process after breast biopsy. Seven survey items on the testing process were 
subsequently developed and assessed for clarity by a second group of 19 
patients. The items cover attributes of mental and physical well-being before, 
during, and after testing. A survey panel of 164 subjects accessed online used 
the items to endorse expected and experienced effects of colon screening and 
mammography. They also endorsed items from a colorectal benefits and barriers 
scale, a risk perception scale, and EQ-5D, to utilize in the analyses of 
validity of the TUI items.
RESULTS: Based on criteria from the literature and limited psychometric 
analysis, the items showed evidence of practicality, validity, and a strong 
association with barriers.
CONCLUSIONS: The TUI health classification and survey items show evidence of 
validity, and may inform economic analysis, once combined with utility weights.

The observation that anatomical course offerings have decreased in undergraduate 
biology curricula is supported by a survey of undergraduate institutions in the 
state of Washington. This reduction, due partially to increased emphasis in 
other areas of the biology curriculum, along with the lack of anatomy 
prerequisites for admission to most medical and dental schools, has resulted in 
many biology majors who have little or no exposure to the anatomical sciences. 
This is a disservice to our students who need to understand organismal form and 
function to better connect our rapidly expanding knowledge of life at the cell 
and molecular level to our understanding of the role of organisms in ecosystems 
and as the primary target of natural selection in evolutionary change. 
Undergraduate anatomical courses can also serve as an extension of the anatomy 
curriculum in professional healthcare programs, where anatomical sciences are 
also experiencing a reduced allocation of instructional time. Given the 
importance of anatomical knowledge along with the many demands and constraints 
on biology curricula, what can we do? One suggestion, a course in integrative 
anatomy for undergraduates, is proposed and discussed.

The increasing risk of poverty across the American life course.

Sandoval DA(1), Rank MR, Hirschl TA.

Author information:

State University, USA.

This article extends the emerging body of life course research on poverty by 
empirically identifying the incidence, chronicity, and age pattern of American 
poverty and how these dimensions have changed during the period 1968-2000. Using 
the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we construct a series of life tables that 
estimate the risk of poverty for adults during their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 
and 70s, and compare these estimates for Americans in the 1970s, 1980s, and 
1990s. Our empirical results suggest that the risk of acute poverty increased 
substantially, particularly in the 1990s. This observed increase was especially 
pronounced for individuals in their 20s, 30s, and 40s; for all age groups with 
respect to extreme poverty; and for white males. On the other hand, the risk of 
chronic poverty declined during the 1990s (as measured by the percentage of the 
poor who experienced five or more years of poverty within a 10-year interval). 
The results in this article tell a very different story than the Census Bureau's 
yearly cross-sectional rates, which have shown little overall change in the U.S. 
poverty rate during this 30-year period. In contrast, a life course approach 
reveals a rising economic risk of acute poverty for individuals, one that is 
consistent with recent observations and research suggesting that a growing 
number of Americans will eventually find themselves in an economically 
precarious position.

This article documents the prevalence, duration, and marital outcomes of 
cohabiting unions in Japan. It then examines the correlates of cohabitation 
experiences and also describes differences in the family-formation trajectories 
of women who have and have not cohabited. Cohabitation has increased rapidly 
among recent cohorts of women, and cohabiting unions in Japan tend to be 
relatively short in duration and are almost as likely to dissolve as to result 
in marriage. Life table analyses demonstrate that the cumulative probabilities 
of marriage and parenthood within marriage are roughly similar for women who did 
and those who did not cohabit. The most notable difference is in the pathways to 
family formation, with women who cohabited more likely both to marry subsequent 
to pregnancy and to delay childbearing within marriage. Taken as a whole, these 
results suggest that cohabiting unions in Japan are best viewed as an emerging 
prelude to marriage rather than as an alternative to marriage or singlehood. We 
conclude with speculation about the likelihood of further increases in 
cohabitation in Japan and the potential implications for marriage and fertility.

University, M.C, Tehran, Iran.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Cancer for a long time has been recognized as a fatal 
disease. Thus it is known to be major health problem in many countries 
throughout the world. In recent years, cancer morbidity and mortality increased 
in our country and especially gastric cancer has second order among all cancers. 
The aim of this study was to analysis the survival of patients diagnosed with 
gastric cancer and the factors which modify prognosis.
METHODS: Retrospective study of overall patients diagnosed with gastric cancer 
registered in the cancer registry center of Research Center for Gastroenterology 
and Liver Disease (RCGLD), Shahid Beheshti University, M.C, Tehran, Iran, 
between Dec. 2001 and Dec. 2006 was done. Survival status of patients was 
followed by the telephone contact. The Kaplan-Meier statistical method was 
employed to determine the probability of survival and log-rank test to compare 
those. Cox regression was used to determine prognosis factors. P < 0.05 was 
considered as statistically significant. All calculations were carried out by 
SPSS (version13.0) statistical software.
RESULTS: Of 746 patients, 38.6% are dead. The mean and median survival time was 
42.45 and 22.8 months, respectively and five-year survival rate was 25.3%. With 
univariate analysis, Age at Diagnosis, surgery treatment, type of first 
treatment, pathologic stage, tumor size, histology type of tumor, extent of wall 
penetration and pathologic distant metastasis were significant prognostic 
factors related to overall survival time. Tumor size greater than 35mm (HR = 
2.12) and have a metastasis (HR = 2.04) were found to be the statistically 
significant poor prognostic factors related to survival in multivariate 
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: According to results, early detection of cancer in lower ages and 
in primary grades of tumor is important to increase patient's life expectancy.

Shelf life extension of Ricotta cheese was evaluated at 4 degrees C upon the use 
of edible coatings made of galactomannans from Gleditsia triacanthos 
incorporating nisin against Listeria monocytogenes. Three different treatments 
were tested in cheese: samples without coating; samples with coating without 
nisin; and samples with coating containing 50 IU x g(-1) of nisin. To test the 
effectiveness of the treatments against L. monocytogenes, the surface of the 
cheese was inoculated with a suspension of the microorganism. Microbiological 
and physical-chemical analyses of the cheese samples were performed during 28 
days. Results showed that the cheese coated with nisin-added galactomannan film 
was the treatment presenting the best results in terms of microbial growth delay 
(p < 0.05). The addition of nisin also affects (p < 0.05) the physical and 
mechanical properties of the films: O(2) permeability decreased from 1.84 to 
1.35 x 10(-12) cm(3) x (Pa x s x m)(-1); CO(2) permeability increased from 1.96 
to 6.31 x 10(-12) cm(3).(Pa x s x m)(-1); opacity increased from 3.68 to 4.59%; 
tensile strength ranged from 0.84 to 1.46 MPa; and elongation at break improved 
from 50.93 to 68.16%. These results demonstrate that novel galactomannan-based 
edible coatings, when combined with nisin, may provide consumer-friendly 
alternatives to reduce L. monocytogenes postcontamination on cheese products 
during storage.

OBJECTIVE: A transmission dynamic model was used to assess the epidemiological 
and economic impact of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) (6/11/16/18) 
vaccine in preventing cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 
2 and 3 (CIN 2/3), CIN 1 and genital warts in Hungary.
METHODS: The routine vaccination of 12-year-old girls and the routine 
vaccination of 12-year-old girls plus a temporary catch-up programme for girls 
and women aged 12-24 years was evaluated.
RESULTS: The model projected that at year 100, both strategies could reduce the 
incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related cervical cancer, CIN 2/3, CIN 1 and genital 
warts cases among Hungarian women by 90%, 90%, 85% and 93%, respectively. 
Twenty-five years after the introduction of HPV vaccination in the population, 
routine vaccination of girls by the age of 12 reduced the cumulative number of 
cases of cervical cancer, CIN 2/3, CIN 1 and genital warts by 685, 13,473, 3,423 
and 163,987, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the two 
vaccination strategies were €9,577 and €10,646 per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained over a time horizon of 100 years.
KEY LIMITATIONS: The model did not account for the health and economic impact of 
other HPV diseases which may result from HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11 infections such 
as vaginal, vulvar, penile, anal and head-neck cancers, and recurrent 
respiratory papillomatosis. Epidemiological data from Hungary on these other HPV 
diseases as well genital warts are needed.
CONCLUSION: A quadrivalent HPV vaccination programme can reduce the incidence of 
cervical cancer, CIN and genital warts in Hungary at a cost-per-QALY ratio 
within the range defined as cost effective.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of using 
information from circulating biomarkers to inform the prioritisation process of 
patients with stable angina awaiting coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
DESIGN: Decision analytical model comparing four prioritisation strategies 
without biomarkers (no formal prioritisation, two urgency scores, and a risk 
score) and three strategies based on a risk score using biomarkers: a routinely 
assessed biomarker (estimated glomerular filtration rate), a novel biomarker (C 
reactive protein), or both. The order in which to perform coronary artery bypass 
grafting in a cohort of patients was determined by each prioritisation strategy, 
and mean lifetime costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared.
DATA SOURCES: Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (9935 
patients with stable angina awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting and then 
followed up for cardiovascular events after the procedure for 3.8 years), and 
meta-analyses of prognostic effects (relative risks) of biomarkers.
RESULTS: The observed risk of cardiovascular events while on the waiting list 
for coronary artery bypass grafting was 3 per 10,000 patients per day within the 
first 90 days (184 events in 9935 patients). Using a cost effectiveness 
threshold of pound20,000- pound30,000 (euro22,000-euro33,000; $32,000-$48,000) 
per additional QALY, a prioritisation strategy using a risk score with estimated 
glomerular filtration rate was the most cost effective strategy (cost per 
additional QALY was < pound410 compared with the Ontario urgency score). The 
impact on population health of implementing this strategy was 800 QALYs per 
100,000 patients at an additional cost of pound 245,000 to the National Health 
Service. The prioritisation strategy using a risk score with C reactive protein 
was associated with lower QALYs and higher costs compared with a risk score 
using estimated glomerular filtration rate.
CONCLUSION: Evaluating the cost effectiveness of prognostic biomarkers is 
important even when effects at an individual level are small. Formal 
prioritisation of patients awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting using a 
routinely assessed biomarker (estimated glomerular filtration rate) along with 
simple, routinely collected clinical information was cost effective. 
Prioritisation strategies based on the prognostic information conferred by C 
reactive protein, which is not currently measured in this context, or a 
combination of C reactive protein and estimated glomerular filtration rate, is 
unlikely to be cost effective. The widespread practice of using only implicit or 
informal means of clinically ordering the waiting list may be harmful and should 
be replaced with formal prioritisation approaches.

Analysis of umpires' age at death suggests that fears regarding risks of their 
profession are unfounded.
BACKGROUND: The on-field death 4 years ago of a veteran Major League Baseball 
(MLB) umpire raised questions regarding the mortality risks of this profession.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if the life expectancy of MLB umpires differs from that 
of the general population.
DESIGN: Ages of death of MLB umpires were determined, and the differences 
between the ages of death and age-adjusted life expectancies were calculated. 
T-score analysis was performed on these differences. Correlational analysis was 
also done on many different factors, including umpire debut year, debut age, 
life expectancy at debut, and length of career.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the age at death of MLB 
umpires and their age-adjusted life expectancy. Correlational analyses showed 
that only length of career correlated with age at death.
CONCLUSION: MLB umpiring is not associated with a shortened life expectancy. 
While this is most likely attributable to the profession having no inherent 
risk, it could also be explained by inherent risks being overcome by yet 
unidentified, unique factors.
