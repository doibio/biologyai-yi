SETTING: Neurosurgery clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: Ten individuals {mean age 60 [standard deviation (SD) 7.1]} who 
had undergone ACDF surgery 10 to 13 years previously and 10 healthy age- and 
sex-matched controls.
MAIN OUTCOMES: Mechanical activity of the different layers of dorsal neck 
muscles, measured at the C4 segment using ultrasonography (speckle tracking 
analysis) during a standardised, resisted cervical extension task.
RESULTS: A significant group×muscle interaction was found for muscle deformation 
(P<0.03) but not for deformation rate (P>0.79). The ACDF group showed 
significantly less deformation of the semispinalis capitis muscle during the 
extension task compared with the control group [mean 3.12 (SD 2.06) and 6.64 (SD 
4.17), respectively; mean difference 3.34 (95% confidence interval -0.54 to 
7.21)].
CONCLUSIONS: As the semispinalis capitis muscle is a powerful neck extensor, the 
finding of altered activation following ACDF surgery lends support to the 
inclusion of exercise to train neck muscle performance in the management of 
these patients.

Every cancer-related death in someone of working age represents an economic loss 
to society. To inform priorities for cancer control, we estimated costs of lost 
productivity due to premature cancer-related mortality across Europe, for all 
cancers and by site, gender, region and country. Cancer deaths in 2008 were 
obtained from GLOBOCAN for 30 European countries across four regions. Costs were 
valued using the human capital approach. Years of productive life lost (YPLL) 
were computed by multiplying deaths between 15 and 64 years by working-life 
expectancy, then by country-, age- and gender-specific annual wages, corrected 
for workforce participation and unemployment. Lost productivity costs due to 
premature cancer-related mortality in Europe in 2008 were €75 billion. Male 
costs (€49 billion) were almost twice female costs (€26 billion). The most 
costly sites were lung (€17 billion; 23% of total costs), breast (€7 billion; 
9%) and colorectum (€6 billion; 8%). Stomach cancer (in Southern and 
Central-Eastern Europe) and pancreatic cancer (in Northern and Western Europe) 
were also among the most costly sites. The average lost productivity cost per 
cancer death was €219,241. Melanoma had the highest cost per death (€312,798), 
followed by Hodgkin disease (€306,628) and brain and CNS cancer (€288,850). 
Premature mortality costs were 0.58% of 2008 European gross domestic product, 
highest in Central-Eastern Europe (0.81%) and lowest in Northern Europe (0.51%). 
Premature cancer-related mortality costs in Europe are significant. These 
results provide a novel perspective on the societal cancer burden and may be 
used to inform priority setting for cancer control.

BACKGROUND: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of boceprevir-based triple 
therapy compared to peginterferon alpha and ribavirin dual therapy in untreated 
patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C; patients were discriminated 
according to the combination of baseline plus on-treatment predictors of 
boceprevir-based triple therapy.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis performed according to data from the 
available published literature. The target population was composed of untreated 
Caucasian patients, aged 50 years, with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C, and 
these were evaluated over a lifetime horizon by Markov model. The study was 
carried out from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service. 
Outcomes included discounted costs (in euro, at 2013 value), life-years gained, 
quality-adjusted life year, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The 
robustness of the results was evaluated by multivariable probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: According to the baseline predictors of sustained virological response 
(genotype 1b, low viral load, fibrosis F0-F3, and body mass index) and the 1Log 
drop of HCV-RNA after the dual therapy lead-in period, boceprevir was 
cost-effective in different patient profiles.
CONCLUSIONS: In untreated genotype 1b chronic hepatitis C patients, the 
cost-effectiveness of boceprevir-based triple therapy widely ranges according to 
different profiles of sustained virological response predictors, allowing 
optimization and personalization of triple therapy.

BACKGROUND: Short-term trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of 
combination therapy using antimuscarinics and α-blockers in men with lower 
urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The Study of Solifenacin Succinate and Tamsulosin 
Hydrochloride OCAS (oral controlled absorption system) in Males with Lower 
Urinary Tract Symptoms (NEPTUNE) II is the first long-term study using 
solifenacin (Soli) and the oral controlled absorption system formulation of 
tamsulosin (TOCAS).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term (up to 52 wk) safety and efficacy of flexible 
dosing of two fixed-dose combinations (FDC) of Soli plus TOCAS in men with 
moderate to severe storage symptoms and voiding symptoms.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients with both storage and voiding LUTS, 
maximum urinary flow rate of 4.0-12.0 ml/s, prostate size <75 ml, and postvoid 
residuals ≤ 150 ml, who completed the 12-wk, double-blind NEPTUNE study could 
continue in the 40-wk, open-label NEPTUNE II study.
INTERVENTION: FDC of Soli 6 mg plus TOCAS 0.4 mg, or Soli 9 mg plus TOCAS 0.4mg; 
patients could switch between doses in NEPTUNE II.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Safety and efficacy data from 
NEPTUNE and NEPTUNE II were combined to cover a 52-wk period. Primary efficacy 
end points were total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and total 
urgency and frequency score (TUFS); secondary end points included IPSS storage 
and voiding subscores, micturition diary variables, and quality of life 
parameters.
RESULTS: In all, 1066 men completed NEPTUNE and received one dose or more of 
study medication in NEPTUNE II. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported 
in 499 (46.8%) patients who participated in NEPTUNE II; most were mild or 
moderate. Urinary retention occurred in 13 of 1208 (1.1%) patients receiving one 
or more FDCs in NEPTUNE and/or NEPTUNE II; 8 (0.7%) required catheterisation 
(acute urinary retention [AUR]). Reductions in total IPSS and TUFS during 
NEPTUNE were maintained for up to 52 wk of FDC treatment, with mean reductions 
of 9.0 (standard deviation [SD]: 5.7) and 10.1 (SD: 9.2), respectively, from 
baseline to end of treatment. Clinically relevant improvements were also 
observed for secondary efficacy end points.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with FDC Soli plus TOCAS was well tolerated and 
efficacious in men with storage and voiding LUTS, with a low incidence of AUR.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Treatment with solifenacin plus tamsulosin in a fixed-dose 
combination tablet was well tolerated by men with lower urinary tract symptoms. 
Improvements in symptoms were achieved after 4 wk of treatment, with further 
improvements at week 16 maintained for up to 52 wk throughout the study.

Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK; Vision and Eye Research Unit, 
Postgraduate Medical Institute, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK.

BACKGROUND: With a higher life expectancy, there is an increased demand for 
hospital glaucoma services in the United Kingdom.
DESIGN: The Cambridge community Optometry Glaucoma Scheme (COGS) was initiated 
in 2010, where new referrals for suspected glaucoma are evaluated by community 
optometrists with a special interest in glaucoma, with virtual electronic review 
and validation by a consultant ophthalmologist with special interest in 
glaucoma.
PARTICIPANTS: 1733 patients were evaluated by this scheme between 2010 and 2013.
METHODS: Clinical assessment is performed by the optometrist at a remote site. 
Goldmann applanation tonometry, pachymetry, monoscopic colour optic disc 
photographs and automated Humphrey visual field testing are performed. A 
clinical decision is made as to whether a patient has glaucoma or is a suspect, 
and referred on or discharged as a false positive referral. The clinical 
findings, optic disc photographs and visual field test results are transmitted 
electronically for virtual review by a consultant ophthalmologist.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of false positive referrals from initial 
referral into the scheme.
RESULTS: Of the patients, 46.6% were discharged at assessment and a further 5.7% 
were discharged following virtual review. Of the patients initially discharged, 
2.8% were recalled following virtual review. Following assessment at the 
hospital, a further 10.5% were discharged after a single visit.
CONCLUSIONS: The COGS community-based glaucoma screening programme is a safe and 
effective way of evaluating glaucoma referrals in the community and reducing 
false-positive referrals for glaucoma into the hospital system.

The Willingness to Pay for a Quality Adjusted Life Year: A Review of the 
Empirical Literature.

There has been a rapid increase in the use of cost-effectiveness analysis, with 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as an outcome measure, in evaluating both 
medical technologies and public health interventions. Alongside, there is a 
growing literature on the monetary value of a QALY based on estimates of the 
willingness to pay (WTP). This paper conducts a review of the literature on the 
WTP for a QALY. In total, 24 studies containing 383 unique estimates of the WTP 
for a QALY are identified. Trimmed mean and median estimates amount to 74,159 
and 24,226 Euros (2010 price level), respectively. In regression analyses, the 
results indicate that the WTP for a QALY is significantly higher if the QALY 
gain comes from life extension rather than quality of life improvements. The 
results also show that the WTP for a QALY is dependent on the size of the QALY 
gain valued. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Cancer incidence increases with age, and as life expectancy increases, the 
number of elderly patients with cancer is increasing. Cancer treatments, 
including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have significant short- and long-term 
effects on cardiovascular function. These cardiotoxic effects can be acute, such 
as changes in electrocardiogram (ECG), arrhythmias, ischemia, and pericarditis 
and/or myocarditis-like syndromes, or they can be chronic, such as ventricular 
dysfunction. Anticancer therapies can also have indirect effects, such as 
alterations in blood pressure, or can cause metabolic abnormalities that 
subsequently increase risk for cardiac events. In this review, we explore both 
observational and clinical trial evidence of cardiac risk in the elderly. In 
both observational and clinical trial data, risk of cardiotoxicity with 
anthracycline-based chemotherapy increases with age. However, it is less clear 
whether the association between age and cardiotoxicity exists for newer 
treatments. The association may not be well demonstrated as a result of 
under-representation of elderly patients in clinical trials and avoidance of 
these therapies in this population. In addition, we discuss strategies for 
surveillance and prevention of cardiotoxicity in the elderly. In the elderly, it 
is important to be aware of the potential for cardiotoxicity during long-term 
follow-up and to consider both prevention and surveillance of these late 
effects.

PURPOSE: The aging of the population is a real concern for surgical oncologists, 
who are increasingly being asked to treat patients who would not have been 
considered for surgery in the past. In many cases, decisions are made with 
relatively little evidence, most of which was derived from trials in which older 
age was a limiting factor for recruitment.
METHODS: This review focuses on risk assessment and perioperative management. It 
describes the relationship between age and outcomes for colon, lung, 
hepatobiliary, and head and neck cancer, which are predominantly diseases of the 
elderly and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality.
RESULTS: Effective surgery requires safe performance as well as reasonable 
postoperative life expectancy and maintenance of quality of life. Treatment 
decisions for potentially vulnerable elderly patients should take into account 
data obtained from the evaluation of geriatric syndromes, such as frailty, 
functional and cognitive limitations, malnutrition, comorbidities, and 
polypharmacy, as well as social support. Postoperative care should include 
prevention and treatment of complications seen more frequently in the elderly, 
including postoperative delirium, functional decline, and the need for 
institutionalization.
CONCLUSION: Surgery remains the best modality for treatment of solid tumors, and 
chronologic age alone should not be a determinant for treatment decisions. With 
adequate perioperative risk stratification, functional assessment, and oncologic 
prognostication, elderly patients with cancer can do as well in terms of 
morbidity and mortality as their younger counterparts. If surgery is determined 
to be the appropriate treatment modality, patients should not be denied this 
option because of their age.

Breast and ovarian cancer in the older woman.

Tew WP, Muss HB, Kimmick GG, Von Gruenigen VE, Lichtman SM.

Nearly half of all women diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer are age 65 
years or older with the number of women diagnosed expected to increase as the 
population ages and life expectancy improves. Older women are less likely to be 
offered standard cancer treatments, are more likely to develop higher toxicity, 
and have higher mortality. Chronologic age should not be the only factor used 
for making treatment decisions. Functional dependence, organ function, 
comorbidity, polypharmacy, social support, cognitive and/or psychosocial 
factors, overall life expectancy, and patient's goals of care are equally vital 
and should be assessed before and during treatment. In this review, current 
evidence and treatment guidelines for older women with breast or ovarian cancer 
are outlined.

Acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes in older adults.

Klepin HD, Rao AV, Pardee TS.

Treatment of older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic 
syndromes (MDS) is challenging because of disease morbidity and associated 
treatments. Both diseases represent a genetically heterogeneous group of 
disorders primarily affecting older adults, with treatment strategies ranging 
from supportive care to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Although 
selected older adults can benefit from intensive therapies, as a group they 
experience increased treatment-related morbidity, are more likely to relapse, 
and have decreased survival. Age-related outcome disparities are attributed to 
both tumor and patient characteristics, requiring an individualized approach to 
treatment decision making beyond consideration of chronologic age alone. 
Selection of therapy for any individual requires consideration of both 
disease-specific risk factors and estimates of treatment tolerance and life 
expectancy derived from evaluation of functional status and comorbidity. 
Although treatment options for older adults are expanding, clinical trials 
accounting for the heterogeneity of tumor biology and aging are needed to define 
standard-of-care treatments for both disease groups. In addition, trials should 
include outcomes addressing quality of life, maintenance of independence, and 
use of health care services to assist in patient-centered decision making. This 
review will highlight available evidence in treatment of older adults with AML 
or MDS and unanswered clinical questions for older adults with these diseases.

Interactions between planktonic organisms, such as detection of prey, predators, 
and mates, are often mediated by fluid signals. Consequently, many plankton 
predators perceive their prey from the fluid disturbances that it generates when 
it feeds and swims. Zooplankton should therefore seek to minimize the fluid 
disturbance that they produce. By means of particle image velocimetry, we 
describe the fluid disturbances produced by feeding and swimming in zooplankton 
with diverse propulsion mechanisms and ranging from 10-µm flagellates to greater 
than millimeter-sized copepods. We show that zooplankton, in which feeding and 
swimming are separate processes, produce flow disturbances during swimming with 
a much faster spatial attenuation (velocity u varies with distance r as u ∝ 
r(-3) to r(-4)) than that produced by zooplankton for which feeding and 
propulsion are the same process (u ∝ r(-1) to r(-2)). As a result, the spatial 
extension of the fluid disturbance produced by swimmers is an order of magnitude 
smaller than that produced by feeders at similar Reynolds numbers. The "quiet" 
propulsion of swimmers is achieved either through swimming erratically by 
short-lasting power strokes, generating viscous vortex rings, or by 
"breast-stroke swimming." Both produce rapidly attenuating flows. The more 
"noisy" swimming of those that are constrained by a need to simultaneously feed 
is due to constantly beating flagella or appendages that are positioned either 
anteriorly or posteriorly on the (cell) body. These patterns transcend 
differences in size and taxonomy and have thus evolved multiple times, 
suggesting a strong selective pressure to minimize predation risk.

Managing malignant biliary obstruction in pancreas cancer: choosing the 
appropriate strategy.

University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System, Chicago, IL 60612, 
United States.

Most patients with pancreatic cancer develop malignant biliary obstruction. 
Treatment of obstruction is generally indicated to relieve symptoms and improve 
morbidity and mortality. First-line therapy consists of endoscopic biliary stent 
placement. Recent data comparing plastic stents to self-expanding metallic 
stents (SEMS) has shown improved patency with SEMS. The decision of whether to 
treat obstruction and the means for doing so depends on the clinical scenario. 
For patients with resectable disease, preoperative biliary decompression is only 
indicated when surgery will be delayed or complications of jaundice exist. For 
patients with locally advanced disease, self-expanding metal stents are superior 
to plastic stents for long-term patency. For patients with advanced disease, the 
choice of metallic or plastic stent depends on life expectancy. When endoscopic 
stent placement fails, percutaneous or surgical treatments are appropriate. 
Endoscopic therapy or surgical approach can be used to treat concomitant 
duodenal and biliary obstruction.

Osteoporosis and fractures in liver disease: relevance, pathogenesis and 
therapeutic implications.

Nakchbandi IA(1).

Heidelberg, Germany.

It is being increasingly recognized that patients with liver disease develop 
bone loss that can be severe enough to lead to atraumatic fractures and thus 
markedly diminish life quality and expectancy. The estimated prevalence for 
liver-related osteoporosis is between 20-420/100000 of the general population, 
and fractures between 60-880/100000. It should be kept in mind that up to 40% of 
patients with chronic liver disease may experience a fracture. The pathogenic 
mediators include fibronectin, insulin like growth factor-I, and various 
cytokines, but decreased vitamin D and/or treatment with corticosteroids 
contribute to worsening bone health. Despite the advances in bone biology that 
have shed some light on the pathogenesis of this bone loss, treatment options 
remain nonspecific and tightly linked to treatments of other forms of 
osteoporosis. Thus, treatment should include calcium and vitamin D 
supplementation in all patients with chronic liver disease. Therapy with 
bisphosphonates should be considered, especially in patients receiving 
corticosteroids. This review focuses on the prevalence of this entity as well as 
the evidence available with regard to the pathogenesis of bone loss in liver 
disease, the diagnostic steps required in all patients, and the therapeutic 
options available.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease characterized by diffuse 
inflammation of the mucosa of the colon and rectum. The hallmark clinical 
symptom of UC is bloody diarrhea. The clinical course is marked by exacerbations 
and remissions, which may occur spontaneously or in response to treatment 
changes or intercurrent illnesses. UC is most commonly diagnosed in late 
adolescence or early adulthood, but it can occur at any age. The incidence of UC 
has increased worldwide over recent decades, especially in developing nations. 
In contrast, during this period, therapeutic advances have improved the life 
expectancy of patients, and there has been a decrease in the mortality rate over 
time. It is important to emphasize that there is considerable variability in the 
phenotypic presentation of UC. Within this context, certain clinical and 
demographic characteristics are useful in identifying patients who tend to have 
more severe evolution of the disease and a poor prognosis. In this group of 
patients, better clinical surveillance and more intensive therapy may change the 
natural course of the disease. The aim of this article was to review the 
epidemiology and demographic characteristics of UC and the factors that may be 
associated with its clinical prognosis.

AIM: To investigate the lifetime risk of development of esophageal 
adenocarcinoma and/or high-grade dysplasia in patients diagnosed with Barrett's 
esophagus.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the United Kingdom National Barrett's 
Oesophagus Registry on date of diagnosis, patient age and gender of 7877 
patients from who had been registered from 35 United Kingdom centers. Life 
expectancy was evaluated from United Kingdom National Statistics data based upon 
gender and age at year at diagnosis. These data were then used with published 
estimates of annual adenocarcinoma and high-grade dysplasia incidences from 
meta-analyses and large population-based studies to estimate overall lifetime 
risk of development of these study endpoints.
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus was 61.6 years in 
males and 67.3 years in females. The mean life expectancy at diagnosis was 23.1 
years in males, 20.7 years in females and 22.2 years overall. Using data from 
published meta-analyses, the lifetime risk of development of adenocarcinoma was 
between 1 in 8 and 1 in 14 and the lifetime risk of high-grade dysplasia or 
adenocarcinoma was 1 in 5 to 1 in 6. Using data from 3 large recent 
population-based cohort studies the lifetime risk of adenocarcinoma was between 
1 in 10 and 1 in 37 and of the combined end-point of high-grade dysplasia and 
adenocarcinoma was between 1 in 8 and 1 in 20. Age at Barrett's esophagus 
diagnosis is reducing and life expectancy is increasing, which will partially 
counter-balance lower annual cancer incidence.
CONCLUSION: There is a significant lifetime risk of development of high-grade 
dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus.

Africa's health care challenges include a high burden of disease, low life 
expectancy, health workforce shortages, and varying degrees of commitment to 
primary health care on the part of policy makers and government officials. One 
overarching goal of the Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI) is to 
develop models of medical education in Sub-Saharan Africa. To do this, MEPI has 
created a network of universities and other institutions that, among other 
things, recognizes the importance of supporting training programs in family 
medicine. This article provides a framework for assessing the stage of the 
development of family medicine training in Africa, including the challenges that 
were encountered and how educational organizations can help to address them. A 
modified "stages of change" model (precontemplation, contemplation, action, 
maintenance, and relapse) was used as a conceptual framework to understand the 
various phases that countries go through in developing family medicine in the 
public sector and to determine the type of assistance that is useful at each 
phase.

Pathological obstruction in lungs leads to severe decreases in muscle strength 
and mobility in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the interdependency between muscle 
strength, spirometric pulmonary functions and mobility outcomes in healthy older 
men and women, where skeletal muscle and pulmonary function decline without 
interference of overt disease. A total of 135 69- to 81-year-old participants 
were recruited into the cross-sectional study, which was performed as a part of 
European study MyoAge. Full, partial and no mediation models were constructed to 
assess the interdependency between muscle strength (handgrip strength, knee 
extension torque, lower extremity muscle power), spirometric pulmonary function 
(FVC, FEV1 and FEF50) and mobility (6-min walk and Timed Up and Go tests). The 
models were adjusted for age, sex, total fat mass, body height and site of 
enrolment. Partial mediation models, indicating both direct and pulmonary 
function mediated associations between muscle strength and mobility, fitted best 
to the data. Greater handgrip strength was significantly associated with higher 
FVC, FEV1 and FEF50 (p < 0.05). Greater muscle power was significantly 
associated with better performance in mobility tests. Results suggest that 
decline in mobility with aging may be caused by decreases in both muscle 
strength and power but also mediated through decreases in spirometric pulmonary 
function. Future longitudinal studies are warranted to better understand how 
loss of function and mass of the respiratory muscles will affect pulmonary 
function among older people and how these changes are linked to mobility 
decline.

Royal Jelly-Mediated Prolongevity and Stress Resistance in Caenorhabditis 
elegans Is Possibly Modulated by the Interplays of DAF-16, SIR-2.1, HCF-1, and

Recent studies suggest that royal jelly (RJ) and its related substances may have 
antiaging properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the 
beneficial effects remain elusive. We report that the effects of RJ and 
enzyme-treated RJ (eRJ) on life span and health span in Caenorhabditis elegans 
(C elegans) are modulated by the sophisticated interplays of DAF-16, SIR-2.1, 
HCF-1, and 14-3-3 proteins. Dietary supplementation with RJ or eRJ increased C. 
elegans life span in a dose-dependent manner. The RJ and eRJ consumption 
increased the tolerance of C elegans to oxidative stress, ultraviolet 
irradiation, and heat shock stress. Our genetic analyses showed that 
RJ/eRJ-mediated life-span extension requires insulin/IGF-1 signaling and the 
activities of DAF-16, SIR-2.1, HCF-1, and FTT-2, a 14-3-3 protein. Earlier 
studies reported that DAF-16/FOXO, SIR-2.1/SIRT1, FTT-2, and HCF-1 have 
extensive interplays in worms and mammals. Our present findings suggest that 
RJ/eRJ-mediated promotion of longevity and stress resistance in C elegans is 
dependent on these conserved interplays. From an evolutionary point of view, 
this study not only provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of RJ's 
action on health span promotion in C elegans, but also has imperative 
implications in using RJ/eRJ as nutraceuticals to delay aging and age-related 
disorders.

Deaths: preliminary data for 2008.

Miniño AM, Xu J, Kochanek KD.

Objectives-This report presents preliminary U.S. data on deaths, death rates, 
life expectancy, leading causes of death, and infant mortality for 2008 by 
selected characteristics such as age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. 
Methods-Data in this report are based on death records comprising more than 99 
percent of the demographic and medical files for all deaths in the United States 
in 2008. The records are weighted to independent control counts for 2008. For 
certain causes of death such as unintentional injuries, homicides, suicides, 
drug-induced deaths, and sudden infant death syndrome, preliminary and final 
data may differ because of the truncated nature of the preliminary file. 
Comparisons are made with 2007 final data. Results-The age-adjusted death rate 
decreased from 760.2 deaths per 100,000 population in 2007 to 758.7 deaths per 
100,000 population in 2008. From 2007 to 2008, age-adjusted death rates 
decreased significantly for 6 of the 15 leading causes of death: Diseases of 
heart, Malignant neoplasms, Cerebrovascular diseases, Accidents (unintentional 
injuries), Diabetes mellitus, andAssault (homicide). From 2007 to 2008, 
age-adjusted death rates increased significantly for 6 of the 15 leading causes 
of death: Chronic lower respiratory diseases; Alzheimer's disease; Influenza and 
pneumonia; Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis; Intentional self-harm 
(suicide); and Essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease. Life 
expectancy decreased by 0.1 year from 77.9 years in 2007 to 77.8 in 2008.

OBJECTIVES: A sub-study to evaluate safety, tolerability, ease-of-use and 
patient satisfaction with a single-use autoinjector administering subcutaneous 
peginterferon-β1a (a pegylated interferon-β1a in clinical development) in a 
subset of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) patients participating in 
ATTAIN, a long-term dose-frequency blinded extension of the Phase III randomized 
ADVANCE study.
METHODS: Over 8 weeks, patients self-administered peginterferon-β1a 125 µg or 
placebo every 2 weeks (two injections via manual pre-filled syringe [PFS]; two 
injections via single-use autoinjector). Primary end points were incidence of 
adverse events (AEs), patient assessment of injection pain score (10-point 
Visual Analog Scale), and clinician assessment of injection site reactions 
(ISRs). Secondary objectives included patient assessment of ease-of-use and 
satisfaction with the autoinjector and evaluation of autoinjector training 
materials.
RESULTS: In 39 patients, the safety profile of peginterferon-β1a was similar 
when delivered via autoinjector or PFS; AEs were mostly mild or moderate in 
severity. Clinicians and patients reported a similar tolerability profile using 
both PFS and autoinjector, and pain scores were low (< 1), with no reports of 
clinician-assessed ISRs after administration with the autoinjector. Patients 
perceived the single-use autoinjector to be easy to use and convenient; overall 
patient satisfaction with the autoinjector and accompanying training materials 
was high.
CONCLUSION: The safety and tolerability profile of peginterferon-β1a delivered 
via autoinjector was similar to delivery via PFS. Patients found the 
autoinjector easy to use and convenient; this device may simplify the injection 
process for MS patients who require long-term therapy, thereby potentially 
improving patient's quality of life and adherence.

BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a prophylactic surgery focused in 
preventing stroke in the mid-long term. The purpose of this study was to analyze 
mid-term mortality in patients undergoing CEA, identify predictors of 3-year 
mortality and design a score to estimate individual risk of mortality in this 
population.
METHODS: A retrospective single-center study including consecutive patients 
undergoing CEA between 1997-2010. Demographic data and comorbidities, 
postoperative results and patient follow-up data were registered and evaluated. 
Kaplan Meier analysis was used to analyze survival. After multivariable COX 
regression analysis, a score based on the calculated Hazards Ratios (HR) was 
designed. The sum of all points performed the individual score for each patient 
for estimating 3-years mortality. Population was stratified into four groups 
according to percentiles of score obtained: Group A (-7 to 4 points), Group B 
(5-8 points), Group C (9-10 points), Group D (score greater than 11 points).
RESULTS: A total of 453 patients with a mean follow-up of 53.4 months were 
included in the study. Overall 3-year survival was 88.4%. On the univariate 
analysis the variables associated with significant increasing in 3-year 
mortality were: female gender (OR 2.32), diabetes mellitus (OR 2.28), COPD (OR 
2.98), ischemic heart disease (OR 2.29), critical carotid stenosis >90% (OR 
2.16) and antiplatelet therapy as a protective factor (OR 0,23). Factors 
associated with mortality in multivariate analysis were age (HR 1.14 P=0.001), 
diabetes mellitus (HR 1.62, P=0.031), COPD (HR 1.88 P=0.022), ischemic heart 
disease (HR 1.59 P=0.05), critical stenosis >90% (HR 1.70 P=0.015) and 
antiplatelet therapy as a protective factor (HR 0.23 P=0.027). The scoring 
system includes the following items: female gender (+2 points), age (50-69 years 
+7 points, 70-79 years +12 points, >80 years +15 points), diabetes (+4 points), 
COPD (+5 points), ischemic heart disease (+4 points), carotid stenosis> 90% (+4 
points). Antiplatelet (-7 points). The score range from -7 to 26 points. The 
3-year mortality range was 5.6% (group A) versus 25.5% (group D). The incidence 
of stroke at 3-year folllow-up was not correlated with the score (99%, 100%, 97% 
and 94.5%, respectively groups A-D, P=0.11) CONCLUSIONS: The score developed 
based on the risk factors of mortality allows individualized risk prediction of 
3-year mortality in patients with carotid stenosis. This represents a useful and 
practical tool for decision-making in the indication of the CEA, allowing 
surgeons to identify high-risk patients who would benefit from medical treatment 
due to their limited life expectancy, mainly in asymptomatic patients.

Copenhagen University Hospital, Hvidovre, Copenhagen, Denmark.

OBJECTIVE: To compare 7 weeks of supervised physical rehabilitation with or 
without progressive strength training (PST) commenced early after fast-track 
total knee arthroplasty (TKA) on functional performance.
METHODS: In total, 82 patients with a unilateral primary TKA were randomized to 
2 different interventions: 7 weeks of supervised physical rehabilitation with 
PST (PST group) and without PST (CON group) commenced early after fast-track 
TKA. The primary outcome was the maximal distance walked in 6 minutes (6-minute 
walk test). Secondary outcomes were lower extremity strength and power, knee 
joint effusion and range of motion, knee pain, and self-reported disability and 
quality of life. All outcome measures were assessed before TKA (baseline) and 4, 
8, and 26 weeks after TKA.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the PST and 
CON groups in the change score from baseline to the 8-week postoperative 
assessment (primary end point) for the 6-minute walk test with unadjusted 
baseline scores (mean difference between groups: -11.3 meters [95% confidence 
interval -45.4, 22.7]; analysis of variance P = 0.51). There were no 
statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences between groups in 
change scores from baseline to any other time point for all secondary outcomes. 
The secondary outcome knee extension strength did not reach the level recorded 
before surgery in both groups.
CONCLUSION: Seven weeks of supervised physical rehabilitation with PST was not 
superior to 7 weeks of supervised physical rehabilitation without PST in 
improving functional performance, measured as the maximal walking distance in 6 
minutes, at the primary end point 8 weeks after fast-track TKA.

OBJECTIVE: The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a standard outcome measure 
used in cost-effectiveness analyses. This study investigates whether attainment 
of federal physical activity guidelines is associated with higher QALY estimates 
among adults with or at an increased risk for knee osteoarthritis.
METHODS: This is a prospective study of 1794 Osteoarthritis Initiative 
participants. Physical activity was measured using accelerometers at baseline. 
Participants were classified as (1) Meeting Guidelines [≥150min of 
moderate-to-vigorous (MV) activity per week acquired in sessions ≥10min], (2) 
Insufficiently Active (≥1 MV session[s]/week but below the guideline), or (3) 
Inactive (zero MV sessions/week). A health-related utility score was derived 
from participant responses to the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey at baseline 
and 2 years later. The QALY was calculated as the area under utility curve over 
2 years. The relationship of physical activity level to median QALY adjusted for 
socioeconomic and health factors was estimated using quantile regression.
RESULTS: Relative to the Inactive group, median QALYs over 2 years were 
significantly higher for the Meeting Guidelines (0.112, 95% CI: 0.067-0.157) and 
Insufficiently Active (0.058, 95% CI: 0.028-0.088) groups, controlling for 
socioeconomic and health factors.
CONCLUSION: We found a significant graded relationship between greater physical 
activity level and higher QALYs. Using the more conservative estimate of 0.058, 
if an intervention could move someone out of the Inactive group and costs <$2900 
over 2 years, it would be considered cost effective. Our analysis supports 
interventions to promote physical activity even if recommended levels are not 
fully attained.
