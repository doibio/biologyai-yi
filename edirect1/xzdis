CARICOM member states to determine timely access to neurosurgical care.
METHODS: We assessed geographical access to facilities capable of providing 
neurosurgical care in the Caribbean. The GPS coordinates of the hospitals that 
provide neurosurgical care were identified using street addresses and satellite 
imaging from Google Maps. Facilities with neurosurgical care were mapped in 
ArcGIS Pro (Version 2.6.0). using Manhattan distance. We identified the area 
around each facility and stratified by 30- minute, 1-hour, 2-hour, and 4-hour 
geographic driving intervals.
RESULTS: A total of 16 hospitals were identified as providing neurosurgical care 
in the Caribbean. Our results suggest that 14 million people (76% of the 
population) had 4-hour geographic access to a facility capable of providing 
neurosurgical care. In addition, 7 million people (40% of the population) had 
2-hour geographical access to neurosurgical care.
CONCLUSIONS: Timely access to care is an important tenet of global neurosurgery. 
We found that 3.5 million Caribbean residents are outside of the access zone to 
neurosurgical capacity. Public health advocates, governments, providers, and 
patients should be aware of the inequity in access to neurosurgical care and 
should collectively work to close the gap.

OBJECTIVES: The guided self-help exercise program called In Tune without Cords 
(ITwC) is effective in improving swallowing problems and communication among 
patients treated with a total laryngectomy (TL). This study investigated the 
cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of ITwC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients within 5 years after TL were included in this 
randomized controlled trial. Patients in the intervention group (n = 46) 
received access to the self-help exercise program with flexibility, 
range-of-motion and lymphedema exercises, and a self-care education program. 
Patients in the control group (n = 46) received access to the self-care 
education program only. Healthcare utilization (iMCQ), productivity losses 
(iPCQ), health status (EQ-5D-3L, EORTC QLU-C10D) and swallowing problems 
(SwalQol) were measured at baseline, 3- and 6-months follow-up. Hospital costs 
were extracted from medical files. Mean total costs and effects 
(quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) or SwalQol score) were compared with 
regression analyses using bias-corrected accelerated bootstrapping.
RESULTS: Mean total costs were non-significantly lower (-€685) and QALYs were 
significantly higher (+0.06) in the intervention compared to the control group. 
The probability that the intervention is less costly and more effective was 73%. 
Sensitivity analyses with adjustment for baseline costs and EQ-5D scores showed 
non-significantly higher costs (+€119 to +€364) and QALYs (+0.02 to +0.03). A 
sensitivity analysis using the QLU-C10D to calculate QALYs showed higher costs 
(+€741) and lower QALYs (-0.01) and an analysis that used the SwalQol showed 
higher costs (+€232) and higher effects (improvement of 6 points on a 0-100 
scale).
CONCLUSION: ITwC is likely to be effective, but possibly at higher expenses.

Sport climbing is increasingly popular and consultations by climbers in hand 
surgery departments are on the increase. The pathologies related to this sport 
concern essentially the pulley system, tendons being rarely affected. We report 
the case of a male climber who presented an atypical rupture of the flexor 
superficialis tendon in his left middle finger sustained when using an atypical 
climbing grip technique: the "hook grip". This consists in extension of the 
metacarpophalangeal joints and maximal flexion of the proximal interphalangeal 
joints with force exerted only on middle phalanx of the middle finger. A 
biomechanical analysis using finger musculoskeletal modeling was performed to 
compare the hook grip to other grips, and the patient's recovery performance was 
assessed. Adapted functional treatment with physiotherapy seems to have been a 
good option for the treatment of this atypical lesion since the patient 
recovered normal use of his finger in daily life. He recovered maximal force in 
climbing holds. The biomechanical analysis confirmed that the atypical "hook 
grip" was likely at the origin of the rupture, since flexor digitorum 
superficialis tendon force for this grip is greater than in other climbing grip 
techniques. The "hook grip" seems to be dangerous and should be used cautiously 
by climbers to prevent similar pathology. Additionally, the patient should 
henceforth be careful when climbing, since the biomechanical model showed that 
the remaining flexor digitorum profundus tendon was overused.

BACKGROUND: Provision of informal care may adversely affect health, daily and 
social activities of the informal caregivers, but few studies have examined 
these effects in relation to caregiving intensity. This study examined the 
predictive factors associated with the effects of caregiving roles on health, 
daily and social activities of informal caregivers, accounting for caregiving 
intensity.
METHODS: Data of adults aged 18 years and over from the National Health and 
Morbidity Survey 2019 were used. Respondent's demographic, socioeconomic, 
health, and caregiving-related characteristics were described using complex 
samples analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the 
factors affecting health, daily and social activities of caregivers, accounting 
for caregiving intensity.
RESULTS: Five point one percent of adults in Malaysia provided informal care. 
High intensity caregivers were more likely to be actively employed and provided 
longer duration of care compared with low intensity caregivers. For low 
intensity caregiving, females, those aged 35-59 years, and those with long-term 
condition were more likely to have negative effects on health. Daily activities 
of non-Malays were more likely to be affected, while no factor was found 
significantly associated with effect on social activities. For high intensity 
caregiving, caregivers aged 60 and over, those received training and those 
without assistance were more likely to have negative effects on health. Daily 
activities of those without assistance were more likely to be affected. Social 
activities of non-Malays, those received training and those providing care for 2 
years or more were more likely to be affected.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that both low- and high-intensity caregivers 
have common features, with the exception of employment status and care duration. 
Caregiving, regardless of intensity, has a significant impact on caregivers. In 
order to reduce the negative consequences of caregiving responsibilities, all 
caregivers need assistance from the community and government, that is customised 
to their needs. By addressing the factors contributing to the negative effects 
of caregiving, a continuation of informal caregiving can be sustained through 
policies supporting the growing demand for informal care necessitated by an 
ageing population and higher life expectancy in Malaysia.

The authors report a case of fungal otitis media complicated by extension of the 
infection into adjacent structures causing apical petrositis and subsequently 
involvement of the jugular foramen in a 71-year-old diabetic man. First 
described in 1907, Gradenigo's syndrome is a serious but rare clinical triad of 
acute otitis media, unilateral pain in the distribution of cranial nerve V 
(trigeminal) and ipsilateral cranial nerve VI (abducens) palsy that commonly 
presents without all three features and is therefore often missed. In this 
report, our patient was initially misdiagnosed as having a diabetic cranial 
neuropathy, and later he developed Vernet's syndrome. Despite aggressive 
surgical and medical management, he did poorly and died a few weeks later. 
Clinicians need to be aware of this serious and life-threatening complication of 
otitis media in high-risk individuals with diabetes or immunocompromised states, 
to allow early diagnosis and improved clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Jail incarceration rates are positively associated with mortality at 
the county level. However, incarceration rates vary within counties, limiting 
the generalisability of this finding to neighbourhoods, where incarceration may 
have the greatest effects.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of census tract-level state 
imprisonment rates in New York State (2010) and life expectancy data from the US 
Small-area Life Expectancy Estimates Project (2010-2015). We modelled 
fixed-effects for counties and controlled for tract-level poverty, racial 
makeup, education, and population density from the American Community Survey 
(2010-2014), and violent crime data from the New York City Police Department 
(2010). We also examined interactions between incarceration rate and poverty, 
racial makeup, and population density on life expectancy.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at the highest quintile of incarceration was 5.5 years 
lower than in the lowest quintile, and over 2 years lower in a fully-adjusted 
model. Census tract-level poverty and racial makeup both moderated the 
association between incarceration and life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Census tract-level incarceration is associated with lower life 
expectancy. Decarceration, including alternatives to incarceration, and release 
of those currently incarcerated, may help to improve life expectancy at the 
neighbourhood level.

Glucocorticoids are important steroid hormones. As an outstanding scientific 
discovery, the scientist who discovered glucocorticoids was awarded the Nobel 
Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1950. Cortisone (hydrocortisone) is a 
natural glucocorticoid, which is secreted with circadian rhythm by the cortical 
cells of adrenal glands. Physiologically, about 10-20 mg of hydrocortisone are 
secreted each day for maintaining homeostasis. Since the biological half-life of 
natural glucocorticoid is short, scientists developed various synthetic 
glucocorticoids including prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, 
triamcinolone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, and so on. These synthetic 
glucocorticoids are generated by modifying some structures based on the 
cortisone backbone, leading to extension of their biological half-life with 
stronger activities. In the face of severe infection, allergy, shock, trauma, 
pain, and other stresses, the demand for glucocorticoids increases dramatically. 
It is critical to supplement extra glucocorticoids to protect the biological 
functions of vital organs. However, the amount and duration of glucocorticoid 
administration need to be carefully adjusted, because a series of side effects 
may occur after long-term or high-dose usage of glucocorticoids. This review 
article will discuss the application of glucocorticoids in the treatment of 
patients with severe or critical COVID-19 and solid tumors of advanced stage. 
The controversy of using glucocorticoid in medical community will also be 
discussed. This review article will help doctors and basic researchers better 
understand the practical application of glucocorticoids.

INTRODUCTION: Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) lead to 
significant morbidity and mortality in children with intestinal failure (IF). 
Ethanol lock prophylaxis (ELP) greatly reduces CLABSI frequency with minimal 
side effects. However, in the United States, a recently approved orphan drug 
designation for dehydrated alcohol has greatly increased 70% ethanol cost from 
about $10/day to $1000/day. We examined the cost-effectiveness of ELP in 
relation to these changes.
METHODS: We simulated a previously developed IF Markov model over 1 year. Costs 
were measured in 2020 US dollars and effectiveness in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). CLABSI rate with and without ELP was estimated from the 
largest available comparative observational study. The primary outcome was 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between treatments. Secondary 
outcomes included CLABSI frequency. Sensitivity analyses on all model parameters 
were performed.
RESULTS: In the base model, children with IF not using ELP accumulated $131,815 
in costs and 0.32 QALYs per patient compared with $437,884 and 0.33 QALYs per 
patient in those using ELP. The ICER was nearly $17 million/QALY gained. ELP 
resulted in a 40% reduction in CLABSI frequency. ELP became cost-effective at 
$68/day and cost-saving at $63/day. Sensitivity analysis identified no other 
plausible parameter variation to reach the benchmark of $100,000/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: At the current price, ELP is not cost-effective for CLABSI 
prevention in children with IF in the United States. This study highlights the 
critical need for the approval of an affordable lock therapy option to prevent 
CLABSIs in these children.

AIM: Understanding whether increasing Life Expectancy (LE) translates to 
improved health and function among older adults is essential, but results are 
inconclusive. We aimed to estimate trends in Disability-Free Life Expectancy 
(DFLE) in the older Norwegian population by sex and education from 1995 to 2017.
METHOD: National life table data were combined with cross-sectional data on 
functional ability for 70+ year-olds from the population-based Trøndelag Health 
Surveys 2-4 (1995-1997, 2006-2008 and 2017-2019) (n=24,733). Self-reported 
functional ability was assessed on a graded scale by a combination of 
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) such as paying bills, going out 
or shopping (mild disability) and Personal Activities of Daily Living (PADL) 
such as washing, dressing or eating (severe disability). LE, DFLE, 
Mild-Disability LE and Severe-Disability LE at age 70 were estimated by the 
Sullivan method.
RESULTS: From 1995 to 2017 DFLE at age 70 increased from 8.4 to 13.0 years in 
women, and from 8.0 to 12.1 years in men. DFLE increased in the basic and high 
educational groups, but more so in the high educational group among men. 
Educational inequalities in years spent with disability however, remained low.
CONCLUSIONS: From the mid-1990s and over the past three decades both LE and DFLE 
at 70 years increased in the older Norwegian population, for both men and women, 
and across basic and high educational levels. Educational inequalities in DFLE 
increased, especially in men, but years spent with disability were similar 
across the three decades.

On Deleterious Mutations in Perennials: Inbreeding Depression, Mutation Load, 
and Life-History Evolution.

Lesaffre T, Billiard S.

AbstractIn angiosperms, perennials typically present much higher levels of 
inbreeding depression than annuals. One hypothesis to explain this pattern stems 
from the observation that inbreeding depression is expressed across multiple 
life stages in angiosperms. It posits that increased inbreeding depression in 
more long-lived species could be explained by differences in the way mutations 
affect fitness, through the life stages at which they are expressed. In this 
study, we investigate this hypothesis. We combine a physiological growth model 
and multilocus population genetics approaches to describe a full 
genotype-to-phenotype-to-fitness map. We study the behavior of mutations 
affecting growth or survival and explore their consequences in terms of 
inbreeding depression and mutation load. Although our results agree with 
empirical data only within a narrow range of conditions, we argue that they may 
point us toward the type of traits capable of generating high inbreeding 
depression in long-lived species-that is, traits under sufficiently strong 
selection, on which selection decreases sharply as life expectancy increases. 
Then we study the role deleterious mutations maintained at mutation-selection 
balance may play in the joint evolution of growth and survival strategies.

Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is a rare hereditary neurodevelopmental disorder 
defined by sulfur-deficient brittle hair and nails and scaly skin, but with 
otherwise remarkably variable clinical features. The photosensitive TTD (PS-TTD) 
forms exhibits in addition to progressive neuropathy and other features of 
segmental accelerated aging and is associated with impaired genome maintenance 
and transcription. New factors involved in various steps of gene expression have 
been identified for the different non-photosensitive forms of TTD (NPS-TTD), 
which do not appear to show features of premature aging. Here, we identify 
alanyl-tRNA synthetase 1 and methionyl-tRNA synthetase 1 variants as new gene 
defects that cause NPS-TTD. These variants result in the instability of the 
respective gene products alanyl- and methionyl-tRNA synthetase. These findings 
extend our previous observations that TTD mutations affect the stability of the 
corresponding proteins and emphasize this phenomenon as a common feature of TTD. 
Functional studies in skin fibroblasts from affected individuals demonstrate 
that these new variants also impact on the rate of tRNA charging, which is the 
first step in protein translation. The extension of reduced abundance of TTD 
factors to translation as well as transcription redefines TTD as a syndrome in 
which proteins involved in gene expression are unstable.

Economic evaluation combines costs and benefits to support decision-making when 
assessing new interventions using preference-based measures to measure and value 
benefits in health or health-related quality of life. These health-focused 
instruments have limited ability to capture wider impacts on informal carers or 
outcomes in other sectors such as social care. Sector-specific instruments can 
be used but this is problematic when the impact of an intervention straddles 
different sectors.An alternative approach is to develop a generic 
preference-based measure that is sufficiently broad to capture important 
cross-sector outcomes. We consider the options for the selection of domains for 
a cross-sector generic measure including how to identify domains, who should 
provide information on the domains and how this should be framed. Beyond domain 
identification, considerations of criteria and stakeholder needs are also 
identified.This paper sets out the case for an approach that relies on the voice 
of patients, social care users and informal carers as the main source of domains 
and describes how the approach was operationalised in the 'Extending the QALY' 
project which developed the new measure, the EQ-HWB (EQ health and wellbeing 
instrument). We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of this 
approach. The new measure should be sufficiently generic to be used to 
consistently evaluate health and social care interventions, yet also sensitive 
enough to pick up important changes in quality of life in patients, social care 
users and carers.

This article examines the relationships between different dimensions of 
well-being and income inequalities across selected Central Eastern European 
countries after joining the European Union in 2004. Regarding the multivariety 
of well-being concept, it explores its 5 dimensions (material dimension, health 
dimension, education dimension, environmental dimension, happiness). Accounting 
for the interactions between dimensions of well-being matters for the 
inequalities, we conducted an in-depth analysis by adopting PMG estimation and 
panel ARDL model to assess the short-run and long-run links between variables. 
The results of conducted analysis allowed us to identify the canals through 
which income inequalities are linked directly or indirectly with the particular 
dimensions of well-being. In the long run, all the dimensions of well-being 
significantly affected income inequalities, and income inequality shaped 
material dimension, health, education, natural environment, and happiness. 
However, in the short run, the only dimension that shaped income inequalities 
was education. Income inequalities directly affected both health dimension and 
happiness.

BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were (1) to estimate 10-year trends in 
disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) by area-level social disadvantage and (2) 
to examine how incidence, recovery and mortality transitions contributed to 
these trends.
METHODS: Data were drawn from the nationally representative Household Income and 
Labour Dynamics in Australia survey. Two cohorts (baseline age 50+ years) were 
followed up for 7 years, from 2001 to 2007 and from 2011 to 2017, respectively. 
Social disadvantage was indicated by the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas 
(SEIFA). Two DFLEs based on a Global Activity Limitation Indicator (GALI) and 
difficulties with activities of daily living (ADLs) measured by the 36-Item 
Short Form Survey physical function subscale were estimated by cohort, sex and 
SEIFA tertile using multistate models.
RESULTS: Persons residing in the low-advantage tertile had more years lived with 
GALI and ADL disability than those in high-advantage tertiles. Across the two 
cohorts, dynamic equilibrium for GALI disability was observed among men in 
mid-advantage and high-advantage tertiles, but expansion of GALI disability 
occurred in the low-advantage tertile. There was expansion of GALI disability 
for all women irrespective of their SEIFA tertile. Compression of ADL disability 
was observed for all men and for women in the high-advantage tertile. Compared 
to the 2001 cohort, disability incidence was lower for the 2011 cohort of men 
within mid-advantage and high-advantage tertiles, whereas recovery and 
disability-related mortality were lower for the 2011 cohort of women within the 
mid-advantage tertile.
CONCLUSION: Overall, compression of morbidity was more common in high-advantage 
areas, whereas expansion of morbidity was characteristic of low-advantage areas. 
Trends also varied by sex and disability severity.

The family Calliphoridae is a group of heterogenous calyptrate flies with a 
worldwide distribution including species of ecological, veterinary, medical, and 
forensic importance. Notorious for their parasitic habits, the larvae of many 
blowflies are characterised - like some other dipteran larvae - by their ability 
to develop in animal flesh. When parasitism affects a living host, it is termed 
"myiasis". This has led the Calliphoridae to be considered as a pivotal family 
in its relationship with a man. Nevertheless, even after more than 50 years of 
research, the phylogenetic relationships among calliphorid subfamilies together 
with the evolutionary origin of myiasis remain unclear. In order to elucidate 
these problems, we constructed three phylogenetic trees by using nucleotide 
sequence data from cytochrome oxidase subunit one (COI), representing a 
mitochondrial conservative gene, and nuclear 28S subunit of ribosomal RNA gene 
(28S rRNA) in order to interpret the evolutionary profile of myiasis in the 
family Calliphoridae. The sequenced data represented species associated with 
ectoparasitic life-styles, either saprophagy or facultative and obligate 
parasitism. A total number of 50 accessions were collected for 28S rRNA, 56 for 
COI, and 38 for combined sequences phylogeny. Molecular Evolutionary Genetics 
Analysis (MEGA) software was used to align 2197 nucleotide positions of 28S rRNA 
and 1500 nucleotide positions of COI with a gap opening penalties and gap 
extension penalties equalling 20 and 0.1 respectively. The results reveal the 
non-monophyly of the family Calliphoridae despite the stable monophyletic status 
of the Chrysomyinae, Luciliinae, and Auchmeromyiinae. Also, our findings 
recommend ranking the Toxotarsinae as a separate family. Furthermore, 
comparative analysis of the phylogenetic trees shows that the habit of 
obligatory myiasis originated independently more than five times. This 
strengthens our hypothesis that the origin of eating fresh meat is a case of 
convergent evolution that has taken place after speciation events millions of 
years ago. Finally, estimating the divergence dates between lineages from 
molecular sequences provides a better chance of understanding their evolutionary 
biology.

BACKGROUND: The occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with 
cancer leads to a reduced life expectancy. There is an increased incidence of 
cancer and its associated mortality in Uganda. We described the survival and 
characteristics of patients with cancer associated thrombosis (CAT) in a 
tertiary oncology centre in Uganda.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on patients with CAT at the Uganda 
Cancer Institute (UCI) using a homogenous purposive sampling method.
RESULTS: One hundred and eleven patients with documented VTE were included in 
the analysis. At entry, the mean age was 52.4 years, and 69 were female. Ninety 
eight had deep venous thrombosis, while 12 had pulmonary embolism. The most 
common cancer diagnoses were haematologic (30), gynaecologic (20) and prostate 
(17) cancers. Treatment regimens included anticoagulation with low-molecular 
weight heparin (LMWH) (72) and combined LMWH with warfarin (22). The median 
overall survival (OS) was 6.3 months, with a 1-year survival rate of 41.5%. 
Patients with significantly increased hazard of mortality were those with upper 
gastrointestinal (UGI) malignancies, colorectal and breast cancers. Patients 
with a body mass index of 25-29.9 kg/m2 (overweight) had a slightly reduced 
hazard of mortality.
CONCLUSION: The OS of patients with CAT at the UCI is short. Most patients with 
CAT presented with advanced stage cancers and at a relatively young age. 
Patients with UGI, colorectal and breast cancers had increased hazards of 
mortality, whereas those who were overweight had a slight reduction in the 
hazard of mortality.

Health is regarded as a universal asset and how this translates into sustainable 
development has remained a subject of discourse in the growth and health 
literature. This disposition is in line with the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals-3, 8, and 13, which highlight the need for good health, 
sustainable economic growth, and environmental sustainability, respectively, 
especially for the United States. To this end, this study explores the nexus of 
turning point such that a subsequent growth in income level decreases the 
prevalence of obesity. Similarly, the study examined the existence of the 
minimum turning point after which the increase in the ecological footprint (EFP) 
escalates the prevalence of obesity. A recent time-series data of annual 
frequency from 1975 to 2016 are used for econometrics analysis to examine the 
reality of ellipsoidal hypothesis. The autoregressive distributed lag techniques 
are adopted for this study. Thus, an empirical investigation revealed that 
higher income per capita level leads to obesity until a certain threshold. Thus, 
the inverted U-shaped relationship between income and obesity is validated, 
while the nexus between EFP and obesity resonates with the U-shaped. The 
validity of these two forms of (obesity-income-EFP) relationship is captured as 
the ellipsoidal hypothesis. Additionally, an increase in life expectancy 
decreases obesity prevalence in the United States. Based on these outcomes, 
policy mechanisms should be geared toward adopting more sustainable productivity 
approaches and more push for higher income status for the citizenry.

BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) reduce mortality in 
patients at risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. Implantation of ICDs in rural 
or economically disadvantaged populations is suspected to be low. This study 
examined Out of Hospital Premature Natural Death (OHPND) and electronic medical 
record (EMR) data to identify rates of non-implantation of ICDs among decedents 
in eastern North Carolina.
METHODS: OHPND cases in 2016 were identified using mortality data and matched 
with EMRs. Those meeting criteria for ICD implantation based on chart review 
were adjudicated by two electrophysiologists to determine whether they qualified 
for implantation. Comorbidity burden was established using Charlson's 
Comorbidity Index (CCI).
RESULTS: Out of 1316 OHPND cases, 967 (73.4%) had EMR records. Chart review 
identified 70 (7.2%) potential ICD candidates with a LVEF ≤35 of which 5 (7.1%) 
did not meet criteria because LVEF subsequently improved. Of the remaining 65 
patients, 32 (49.2%) already received an ICD, and 33 patients (50.7%) met 
criteria but had not received one. Reasons for non-implantation included: 
limited life expectancy secondary to comorbidities, principally chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) (N = 11, 17%), physician non-adherence to guidelines (N = 9, 14%), 
loss to follow-up (N = 7, 11%), patient refusal (N = 5, 8%), and death before 
commencing medical therapy (N = 1, 2%). Among our cohort of 967 individuals who 
died unexpectedly, nine (0.9%) patients may have avoided death with an ICD.
CONCLUSION: This study using decedent data shows low rates of 
ICD-underutilization in a rural population and emphasizes the role of advanced 
comorbidities such as CKD in ICD-underutilization.

BACKGROUND: Due to population aging and the spread of endovascular techniques 
for aortic diseases, there has been an increase in older population intervened. 
Objectively assessing patient's global status becomes mandatory in advanced 
ages, as impaired functional status and frailty are associated with higher 
postoperative mortality rates. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact 
of a systematic geriatric preoperative assessment on the outcomes of aortic 
interventions.
METHODS: All patients above 60 years old with surgical indication for aortic 
disease between September 2016 and May 2019 underwent a standardized geriatric 
assessment. It analyzed physiological reserve, frailty, and life expectancy. An 
algorithm was created for its application before intervention indication. 
Variables registered were patient's data, type of aortic disease, type of 
intervention, geriatric assessment result, mortality and follow-up time. A 
bivariate analysis was performed.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-four patients were included. Geriatric report was 
unfavorable for intervention in 6.25% (N.=9). From these, 88% (N.=8) were 
finally rejected for intervention. In those undergoing aortic intervention 
(N.=127) there was a 7% mortality rate (N.=9) and in the no-intervention group 
(N.=17) mortality rate raised up to 35% (N.=6). No aortic-related mortality was 
reported. A relevant association between an unfavorable geriatric report and 
mortality was found "OR 0.036 (CI 0.0082-0.155)." A protective relationship 
between any aortic intervention and mortality was found, with OR 0.139 (CI 
0.043-0.447).
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric assessment is a valid tool to estimate life expectancy 
and patient's physiological status. An unfavorable report correlates with 
short-term non-aortic mortality independently of undergoing intervention. This 
has a high clinical relevance, and it highlights its practical applicability to 
improve aortic surgery indication's quality and optimize resource investment.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common condition, often associated with a 
high level of symptoms. In this review, several palliative treatments for 
symptomatic MPE are summarised, including repeated thoracentesis, pleurodesis 
and insertion of indwelling pleural catheters. Choice of treatment depends on 
patient symptoms, life expectancy, pleural fluid production, expected effect of 
oncological treatment, whether trapped lung is suspected or not, and patient 
preferences. Treatment should be discussed with a pulmonary specialist with 
knowledge of pleural diseases.

High-dose exercise-induced cardiac outcomes may vary between sexes. However, 
many studies investigating the cardiovascular effects of high-dose exercise have 
excluded or under-recruited females. This scoping review aimed to describe the 
recruitment of females in studies assessing the impact of high-dose exercise on 
cardiovascular outcomes and describe how this has changed over time. This 
scoping review followed the protocol outlined by Arksey and O'Malley and is 
reported as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The OVID 
and EMBASE databases were searched for studies that assessed the effects of 
high-dose exercise on cardiovascular outcomes. Both professional and 
nonprofessional groups were included. The review found 2973 studies, and 250 met 
the inclusion criteria including cumulatively 17,548,843 subjects. Over half the 
studies (n = 127) excluded females entirely, and only 8 (3.2%) studies recruited 
all-female participants. The overall mean percentage of females recruited was 
18.2%. The mean percentage was 14.5% in studies conducted before 2011 and 21.8%
