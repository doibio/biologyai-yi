were prospective in design, and only one study was a conference abstract. 
Extracted studies were heterogeneous in dose prescription used (11-70 Gy in 3-30 
fractions), in addition to reported QOL metrics (EORTC QLQ C-15 PAL,/C-30/LM-21, 
EuroQol 5D, FACT-Hep, FLIC) and final endpoints (range 6 weeks to 12 months). 
Despite this there were few statistically significant declines in QOL scores 
following SABR. Four studies demonstrated transient fatigue in the first 1-4 
weeks, while 2 studies showed transient worsening of appetite at 1 month. In all 
but one instance (loss of appetite at 6 weeks), levels returned to insignificant 
difference baseline by the final endpoints. All studies showed no significant 
QOL decline in any domain at their respective endpoints. In studies with 
overlapping QOL tools, estimates of 3-month post SABR global QOL were similar.
CONCLUSION: Results of this systematic review demonstrate well-preserved post 
liver SABR QOL. These findings strengthen the argument for liver SABR, and 
should aim to support future comparative effectiveness trials with other local 
modalities including surgery, chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation, 
with a focus on QOL outcomes as an important endpoint.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects 15% of cats, and prevalence increases 
with age. Although many cats with HCM have normal life expectancy, some cats die 
suddenly, or develop congestive heart failure or arterial thromboembolism (ATE). 
High-risk cats can be recognized by left atrial enlargement on echocardiography, 
which can be missed on physical examination, as a heart murmur is often absent. 
Alternatively, plasma biomarkers can be measured as an initial screening test; 
echocardiography is indicated in cats with plasma NT-probrain natriuretic 
peptide concentrations exceeding 100 pmol/L. High-risk cats should be treated 
with clopidogrel to reduce the risk of ATE.

Coral reefs around the globe have been subjected to a wide range of stressors. 
In the present study, fish species were recorded across a pronounced 
in-to-offshore gradient in the Jakarta Bay-Pulau Seribu reef system. In addition 
to this, fish species traits were obtained from FishBase. RLQ analysis revealed 
a significant association between fish species traits and environmental 
variables. Fish species associated with perturbed, inshore waters were resilient 
to disturbance, had higher mortality rates, higher growth rates and mainly 
consumed animals. In contrast, fish species associated with less perturbed, mid- 
and offshore waters had greater life expectancy, higher age at maturity, greater 
life span, greater generation time and mainly fed on plants or plants and 
animals. Eutrophication, pollution and physical destruction of coral substrate 
in inshore waters has thus selected for a low biomass and depauperate fish 
community characterised by fast growing and short lived species.

Patients with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) display a broad range of 
metabolic risk factors related to the development of diverse medical 
comorbidities. Initial stages of these disorders are essential in understanding 
the increased vulnerability of developing cardiometabolic disturbances, 
associated with a reduced life expectancy. This study aimed to evaluate the 
metabolic profile of a cohort of patients with a FEP and its evolution during a 
two year follow-up, as well as the factors that influence the changes in their 
metabolic status. 16 participating centers from the PEPs Project recruited 335 
subjects with a FEP and 253 matched healthy controls, aged 9-35years. We 
investigated a set of anthropometric measures, vital signs and laboratory data 
obtained from each participant over two years in a prospective, naturalistic 
study. From the beginning of the study the FEP group showed differences in the 
metabolic profile compared to the control group, together with a progressive 
worsening in the major part of the analyzed variables during the follow-up 
period, with higher rates of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Certain risk 
factors were related to determinate clinical variables such as male gender, the 
presence of affective symptoms or an early onset or to treatment variables such 
as the use of antipsychotic polypharmacy, antidepressants or mood stabilizers. 
Our results highlight the extremely high risk of patients at early phases of 
schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders of developing cardiovascular 
comorbidity and the fast worsening of the metabolic profile during the first two 
years.

Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is one of the major 
complications caused by prolonged bisphosphonate administration. We treated a 
case of BRONJ-related cerebral and intraventricular abscess. An 80-year-old 
woman was referred to our hospital for osteonecrosis of the maxilla. Removal of 
a decayed tooth followed by several oral antimicrobial administrations was 
performed, but the inflammation spread gradually into the orbit. Twenty-seven 
months after the initial treatment, she was referred to our hospital. A computed 
tomography (CT) scan revealed formation of an intraventricular abscess secondary 
to destruction of the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. Reports of BRONJ 
associated with intracranial infection are rare. With prolonged life expectancy, 
BRONJ cases will increase with many comorbid diseases. Co-operation among 
physicians, dentists, and pharmacologists will be needed to treat these 
conditions appropriately.

Pneumocephalus is a rare but important complication of acute isolated sphenoid 
sinusitis (ISS). If not adequately treated, it may cause serious neurological 
and life-threatening complications. We report the presence of free air in the 
cavernous sinus arising from intracranial extension of acute ISS. A 41-year-old 
healthy man presented to our department with a 7-day history of headache. 
Neurological examination revealed no meningitis, and cerebrospinal fluid culture 
was negative. A head computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging on 
admission revealed sinusitis in the sphenoid sinus and presence of air in the 
cavernous sinus. We started an antibiotic treatment and the patient's fever 
immediately decreased and the inflammatory response improved. In addition, the 
bilateral retro-orbital headache diminished. A repeated head CT scan revealed 
that fluid retention in the sphenoid sinus and air in the cavernous sinus had 
disappeared. To our knowledge, this is the fifth case of pneumocephalus 
accompanied by acute ISS reported in the literature and the first case report of 
intracranial air located only in the cavernous sinus. Meningitis accompanied by 
pneumocephalus can be a warning sign for poor outcome in patients with ISS.

While availability of palliative care consultation for children with advanced 
heart disease increases, little is known about cardiologist attitudes towards 
palliative care. We sought to describe perspectives of cardiologists regarding 
palliative care and to characterize their perceived competence in palliative 
care concepts. A cross-sectional survey of pediatric cardiologists and cardiac 
surgeons from 19 pediatric medical centers was performed. Overall response rate 
was 31% (183/589). Respondents had a median of 18 years of experience since 
medical school (range 2-49) and most practiced at academic centers (91%). 
Sixty-percent of respondents felt that palliative care consultations occur "too 
late" and the majority (85%) agreed that palliative care consultations are 
helpful. Barriers to requesting palliative care consultation were most 
frequently described as "referring to palliative care services too early will 
undermine parents' hope" (45%) and "concern that parents will think I am giving 
up on their child" (56%). Only 33% of cardiologists reported feeling "very" or 
"moderately" competent in prognosticating life expectancy while over 60% felt 
competent caring for children with heart disease around end of life, and nearly 
80% felt competent discussing goals of care and code status. Greater perceived 
competence was associated with subspecialty (heart failure/intensivist vs. 
other) (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-8.1, p = 0.003) and didactic training (OR 6.27, 95% 
CI 1.8-21.8, p = 0.004). These results underscore the need for further training 
in palliative care skills for pediatric cardiologists. Enhancing palliative care 
skills among cardiologists and facilitating partnership with subspecialty 
palliative care teams may improve overall care of children with advanced heart 
disease.

Musculoskeletal disorders affect morbidity, quality of life and mortality, and 
represent an increasing economic and societal burden in the context of 
population aging and increased life expectancy. Improvement of quality of life 
should be one of the priorities of any interventions to prevent and treat 
musculoskeletal disorders in the ageing population. Two main approaches, namely 
generic and disease-specific instruments, can be applied to measure 
health-related quality of life. Among the generic tools available in scientific 
literature, the short form 36 questionnaire (SF-36) and the Euroqol five item 
questionnaire (EQ-5D) are two of the most popular questionnaires used to 
quantify the health related quality of life in people with musculoskeletal 
disorders. However, because generic tools may not always be able to detect 
subtle effects of a specific condition on quality of life, a specific tool is 
highly valuable. Specific tools improve the ability to clinically characterize 
quality of life in subjects with a specific musculoskeletal disorder, as well as 
the capacity to assess changes over time in the QoL of these subjects. The 
recent development of specific tools should help to validate preventive and 
therapeutic interventions in this field.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the dependency of 
midlife stroke survivors had any long-term impact on their spouses' 
QALY-weights.
METHOD: Data on stroke survivors, controls, and spouses were collected from the 
7-year follow-up of the Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke. 
Health-related quality of life was assessed by the SF-36, and the 
preference-based health state values were assessed with the SF-6D. Spouses of 
dependent and independent stroke survivors were categorized according to their 
scores on the modified Rankin Scale. An ordinary least squares regression 
analysis was used to evaluate whether the dependency of the stroke survivors had 
any impact on the spouses' QALY-weights.
RESULT: Cohabitant dyads of 247 stroke survivors aged <70 at stroke onset and 
245 dyads of controls were included in the study. Spouses of dependent stroke 
survivors (n = 50) reported a significant lower mean QALY-weight of 0.69 in 
comparison to spouses of independent stroke survivors (n = 197) and spouses of 
controls, (n = 245) who both reported a mean QALY-weight of 0.77. The results 
from the regression analysis showed that higher age of the spouse and dependency 
of the stroke survivor had a negative association with the spouses' 
QALY-weights.
CONCLUSION: The QALY-weights for spouses of dependent midlife stroke survivors 
were significantly reduced compared to spouses of independent midlife stroke 
survivors. This indicates that the inclusion of spouses' QALYs in evaluations of 
early treatment and rehabilitation efforts to reduce stroke patients' dependency 
would capture more of the total effect in dyads of stroke survivors.

BACKGROUND: Changing family sociodemographic factors, increased life expectancy 
for people with an intellectual disability, deinstitutionalization and policy 
prioritization of the family as the principal care provider, presents new 
challenges to care sustainability.
METHOD: A qualitative study design was employed, entailing focus groups and 
semistructured interviews, with purposive sampling via the parent study 
population of the Intellectual Disability Supplement to The Irish Longitudinal 
Database on Ageing.
RESULTS: The traditional sociodemographic facilitators of family caregiving are 
in rapid decline. Families perceived limited support from services and limited 
future care options. Few future care plans have been formulated. A strong 
possibility exists of placement of older family members with an intellectual 
disability in out-of-family home care.
CONCLUSION: To anticipate and provide for quality care supports, there is a need 
to establish proactive initiatives, for both people with an intellectual 
disability and their families', to facilitate the early formation of long-term 
care plans.

The advent of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has prolonged the life 
expectancy of HIV + individuals and decreased the incidence of HIV-associated 
dementia. However, milder forms of neurocognitive impairment remain common and 
are often associated with poor daily functioning and lower medication adherence. 
This paper presents a research aimed at exploring the cognitive status 
differences between HIV + subjects (N = 39) on cART therapy and a group of 
demographically comparable healthy subjects (N = 39) in Serbia. The significance 
of differences between the HIV + group and the healthy control group in 
performance in six cognitive domains was tested using the multivariate analysis 
of variance. Results showed a lower performance of the HIV + group in the 
domains of attention/working memory, and learning. HIV-related clinical 
variables were not significantly associated with cognitive performance. An older 
age in HIV + patients was significantly related to a lower performance in all 
six cognitive domains, as opposed to healthy subjects, implying a synergistic 
interaction between HIV and aging, resulting in accentuated cognitive 
difficulties. Our findings suggest that even with the absence of a subjective 
experience of cognitive deficits and with a good basic control of the illness, a 
certain degree of cognitive deficit can be observed in the tested group.

by the sigma subunit. The model prokaryote Escherichia coli K-12 contains seven 
species of the sigma subunit, each recognizing a specific set of promoters. For 
identification of the "constitutive promoters" that are recognized by each RNAP 
holoenzyme alone in the absence of other supporting factors, we have performed 
the genomic SELEX screening in vitro for their binding sites along the E. coli 
K-12 W3110 genome using each of the reconstituted RNAP holoenzymes and a 
collection of genome DNA segments of E. coli K-12. The whole set of constitutive 
promoters for each RNAP holoenzyme was then estimated based on the location of 
RNAP-binding sites. The first successful screening of the constitutive promoters 
was achieved for RpoD (σ70), the principal sigma for transcription of 
growth-related genes. As an extension, we performed in this study the screening 
of constitutive promoters for four minor sigma subunits, stationary-phase 
specific RpoS (σ38), heat-shock specific RpoH (σ32), flagellar-chemotaxis 
specific RpoF (σ28) and extra-cytoplasmic stress-response RpoE (σ24). The total 
number of constitutive promoters were: 129~179 for RpoS; 101~142 for RpoH; 34~41 
for RpoF; and 77~106 for RpoE. The list of constitutive promoters were compared 
with that of known promoters identified in vivo under various conditions and 
using varieties of E. coli strains, altogether allowing the estimation of 
"inducible promoters" in the presence of additional supporting factors.

BACKGROUND: Adolescents (10-19 years old) comprise a fifth of the Indian 
population (253.2 million), yet there is very little published information about 
the burden of disease and injury for this age group. This paper aims to provide 
a contemporary picture of the leading causes of death and disability for Indian 
adolescent girls and boys for 2013, and changes in deaths and disability between 
1990 and 2013.
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for India, for the 
years 1990 and 2013, were accessed. Data were categorized into two age groups: 
10 to 14 years (younger adolescents) and 15 to 19 years (older adolescents) and 
analysed separately for girls and boys.
RESULTS: The study shows that for both younger and older adolescent boys and for 
older adolescent girls, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries are 
responsible for a greater number of deaths and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) than communicable diseases. Communicable diseases are still important 
causes of death and disability for young adolescents. Among older adolescents 
there is an increasing burden of death and disability due to self-harm, road 
traffic injuries, fire- and heat-related injuries and mental disorders such as 
depressive disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Although strategies to reduce the burden of communicable diseases 
among adolescents must continue to be an important focus, innovative, 
evidence-based strategies aimed at reducing the growing burden of NCDs and 
injuries must be elevated as a priority.

BACKGROUND: The addition of procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine (PCV) 
chemotherapy to radiotherapy (RT) for patients with high-risk (≥40 y old or 
subtotally resected) low-grade glioma (LGG) results in an absolute median 
survival benefit of over 5 years. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of this 
treatment strategy.
METHODS: A decision tree with an integrated 3-state Markov model was created to 
follow patients with high-risk LGG after surgery treated with RT versus RT+PCV. 
Patients existed in one of 3 health states: stable, progressive, or dead. 
Survival and freedom from progression were modeled to reflect the results of 
RTOG 9802 using time-dependent transition probabilities. Health utility values 
and costs of care were derived from the literature and national registry 
databases. Analysis was conducted from the health care perspective. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis explored uncertainty in 
model parameters.
RESULTS: Modeled outcomes demonstrated agreement with clinical data in expected 
benefit of addition of PCV to RT. The addition of PCV to RT yielded an 
incremental benefit of 4.77 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (9.94 for RT+PCV 
vs 5.17 for RT alone) at an incremental cost of $48635 ($188234 for RT+PCV vs 
$139598 for RT alone), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$10186 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrates that 
within modeled distributions of parameters, RT+PCV has 99.96% probability of 
being cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: The addition of PCV to RT is a cost-effective treatment strategy for 
patients with high-risk LGG.

BACKGROUND: The quality of life for breast cancer survivors has become 
increasingly important because of their high survival rate and prolonged life 
expectancy. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of physical 
activity following diagnosis and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in 
breast cancer survivors.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of breast cancer survivors. A 
total of 231 women aged 21-78 years who had been diagnosed with stages I to III 
breast cancer and had breast cancer surgery at least 6 months prior were 
recruited from three hospitals between September 2012 and April 2015 and were 
included in this study. We asked participants about their HRQOL and engagement 
in physical activity using structured questionnaires. We examined the 
association between HRQOL levels and physical activity using a generalized 
linear model.
RESULTS: Breast cancer survivors in the high physical activity group (3rd 
tertile) were more likely to have lower scores for fatigue (p for trend = 0.001) 
and pain (p for trend = 0.02) and higher scores for sexual function (p for 
trend = 0.007) than those in the low physical activity group (1st tertile). When 
we stratified participants by stage, we found increasing scores for physical 
functioning (p for trend =0.01) and decreasing scores for fatigue (p for 
trend = 0.02) with increasing levels of physical activity in breast cancer 
survivors with stage I breast cancer. In survivors with stages II and III, we 
found statistically significant associations with fatigue (p for trend = 0.02) 
and sexual functioning (p for trend = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, engagement in physical activity was related to 
better health-related quality of life among breast cancer survivors. Our 
findings may warrant further prospective and intervention studies to support the 
benefit of physical activity in improving the quality of life and survival of 
Korean breast cancer survivors.

Two Congenital Left-to-Right Shunt Anomalies in a Septuagenarian: ARare 
Occurrence.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) are common 
congenital anomalies presenting in childhood. Life expectancy of an uncorrected 
PDAis shortened to half; and ASD of a significant size has increased morbidity 
and mortality. Their co-existence in an elderly patient with first presentation 
at 70 years of age is a rarity. We present the case of a 70-year woman with 
one-week history of dyspnea with high blood pressure and signs of heart failure. 
She was found to have a PDA and an ASD with left-to-right shunt. She was managed 
conservatively. She was offered cardiac catheterization, but she refused. This 
is the first documented case in local literature with two such congenital heart 
defects presenting in a septuagenarian. In a country where average life 
expectancy is in the 60's, the survival of the patient with two heart defects, 
beyond-average survival age, is interesting.

OBJECTIVES: Predicting mortality in middle-aged HIV-infected (HIV+) women on 
antiretroviral therapies (ART) is important for understanding the impact of HIV 
infection. Several health indices have been used to predict mortality in women 
with HIV infection. We evaluated: (1) an HIV biological index, Veterans Aging 
Cohort Study (VACS); (2) a physical index, Fried Frailty Index (FFI); and (3) a 
mental health index, Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D). 
Proportional hazards regression analyses were used to predict death and included 
relevant covariates.
DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort.
SETTING: Multicentre, across six sites in the USA.
PARTICIPANTS: 1385 multirace/ethnic ART-experienced HIV+ women in 2005.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: All deaths, AIDS deaths and non-AIDS deaths up 
to ~8 years from baseline.
RESULTS: Included together in one model, VACS Index was the dominant, 
significant independent predictor of all deaths within 3 years (HR=2.20, 95% CI 
1.83, 2.65, χ2=69.04, p<0.0001), and later than 3 years (HR=1.55, 95% CI 1.30, 
1.84, χ2=23.88, p<0.0001); followed by FFI within 3 years (HR=2.06, 95% CI 1.19, 
3.57, χ2=6.73, p=0.01) and later than 3 years (HR=2.43, 95% CI 1.58, 3.75, 
χ2=16.18, p=0.0001). CES-D score was not independently associated with 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This is the first simultaneous evaluation of three 
common health indices in HIV+ adults. Indices reflecting physical and biological 
ageing were associated with death.

INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of death from 
neoplastic disease in men and third in women of all ages. Globally, life 
expectancy is increasing, and consequently, an increasing number of operations 
are being performed on more elderly patients with the trend set to continue. 
Elderly patients are more likely to have cardiovascular and pulmonary 
comorbidities that are associated with increased peri-operative risk. They 
further tend to present with more locally advanced disease, more likely to 
obstruct or have disseminated disease. The aim of this review was to investigate 
the feasibility of laparoscopic colorectal resection in very elderly patients, 
and whether there are benefits over open surgery for colorectal cancer.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed on Medline, Pubmed, Embase 
and Google Scholar. All comparative studies evaluating patients undergoing 
laparoscopic versus open surgery for colorectal cancer in the patients 
population over 85 were included. The primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and 
30-day overall morbidity. Secondary outcomes were operating time, time to oral 
diet, number of retrieved lymph nodes, blood loss and 5-year survival.
RESULTS: The search provided 1507 citations. Sixty-nine articles were retrieved 
for full text analysis, and only six retrospective studies met the inclusion 
criteria. Overall mortality for elective laparoscopic resection was 2.92% and 
morbidity 23%. No single study showed a significant difference between 
laparoscopic and open surgery for morbidity or mortality, but pooled data 
analysis demonstrated reduced morbidity in the laparoscopic group (p = 0.032). 
Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery are more likely to have a shorter 
hospital stay and a shorter time to oral diet.
CONCLUSION: Elective laparoscopic resection for colorectal cancer in the over 85 
age group is feasible and safe and offers similar advantages over open surgery 
to those demonstrated in patients of younger ages.

OBJECTIVE: Describe utilization and satisfaction in a specialty integrated care 
program for children with severe, chronic respiratory insufficiency (CRI).
SUBJECTS: Enrollees of the Critical Care, Anesthesia, Perioperative Extension 
(CAPE) and Home Ventilation Program.
METHODS: Children with CRI received home visits, care coordination, and 
"on-demand" 24/7 access to physicians. Program activity and outcomes were 
recorded for 3 years using an adapted Care Coordination Measurement Tool© 
version. Parents completed the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and 
Systems (CAHPS). Patient characteristics, program activity, clinical outcomes, 
utilization, and satisfaction were summarized using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: CAPE provided care for 320 patients from 2012 to 2014 with a median of 
7 encounters per year. Neuromuscular (n=132, 41%), chronic lung disease (n=37, 
12%), and congenital heart disease (n=13, 4%) represented the majority of 
underlying conditions. Services included 905 home, 504 clinic, and 3633 
telephone encounters, of which 43.6% included a care coordination activity. 
CAHPS (n=102) revealed that 92.1% (n=93) of children had at least one non-urgent 
(i.e., routine) visit and nearly two-thirds (64.7%, n=66) reported the need for 
urgent or emergency care. Overall, parents were highly satisfied with CAPE, with 
a mean satisfaction rating of 9.3 (±1.3) out of 10. Most parents reported that 
the CAPE team understood the child's (96.0%, n=95) and family's day-to-day life 
(86.9%, n=86).
CONCLUSIONS: When given open access to an intregated care program, children in 
our highly complex population required a median of 7 encounters per year. We 
believe that this experience is scalable and may inform other organizations 
contemplating similar services.

Reduced reproduction and dietary restriction each extend lifespan in many animal 
models, but possible contributions of nutrient oxidation and allocation are 
largely unknown. Ovariectomy and eating 70% of ad libitum-feeding each extend 
lifespan in lubber grasshoppers. When feeding levels between the two groups are 
matched, ovariectomy increases fat and protein storage while dietary restriction 
reduces fat storage. Because of these disparities in nutrient investment, 
metabolism may differ between these two life-extending treatments. Therefore, we 
examined the allocation and organismal oxidation of one representative of each 
macronutrient class: leucine, oleic acid, and glucose. Ovariectomy and dietary 
restriction each increased oxidation of dietary leucine. Dietary leucine may 
play a special role in aging because amino acids stimulate cellular growth. 
Speeding oxidation of leucine may attenuate cellular growth. Allocation of 
leucine to muscle was the clearest difference between ovariectomy and dietary 
restriction in this study. Ovariectomy reduced allocation of leucine to femur 
muscle, whereas dietary restriction increased allocation of leucine to femur 
muscle. This allocation likely corresponds to muscle maintenance for locomotion, 
suggesting dietary restriction increases support for locomotion, perhaps to 
search for food. Last, ovariectomy decreased oxidation of dietary oleic acid and 
glucose, perhaps to save them for storage, but the site of storage is unclear. 
This study suggests that the oxidation of branched-chain amino acids may be an 
underappreciated mechanism underlying lifespan extension.

Mini-implants have certain advantages over standard size implants which are 
being tested in various randomized controlled trials. This systematic review and 
meta-analysis aims to compare conventional implant overdentures to 
mini-implant-retained overdentures as regards to patient satisfaction. 
Electronic databases were searched for eligible studies data required were 
extracted. The extracted data were analyzed using non-Cochrane mode in RevMan 
5.0 software. The heterogeneity between the studies was assessed using Forest
