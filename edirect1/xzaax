site reaction, viral infection, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, 
headache, and pharyngitis, although the incidence of adverse events with 
omalizumab was similar to that with placebo.
CONCLUSION: Omalizumab, as add-on therapy with ICS, is an effective and well 
tolerated agent for the treatment of moderate to severe allergic asthma in 
adolescents and adults. In addition to its symptomatic and QOL benefits, 
omalizumab therapy allows ICS dosage reduction or discontinuation of ICS in many 
patients. Comparisons of omalizumab with other asthma therapies have yet to be 
conducted; however, clinical efficacy and tolerability data indicate that 
omalizumab is a valuable option in the treatment of allergic asthma.

We investigated whether the Framingham risk score, which was designed to 
estimate the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), differentiates 
lifetime risk for CHD. All subjects in the Framingham Heart Study examined from 
1971 to 1996 who were free of CHD were included. Subjects were stratified into 
age- and gender-specific tertiles of Framingham risk score, and lifetime risk 
for CHD was estimated. We followed 2,716 men and 3,500 women; 939 developed CHD 
and 1,363 died free of CHD. At age 40 years, in risk score tertiles 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively, the lifetime risks for CHD were 38.4%, 41.7%, and 50.7% for men 
and 12.2%, 25.4%, and 33.2% for women. At age 80 years, risks were 16.4%, 17.4%, 
and 38.8% for men and 12.8%, 22.4%, and 27.4% for women. The Framingham risk 
score stratified lifetime risk well for women at all ages. It performed less 
well in younger men but improved at older ages as remaining life expectancy 
approached 10 years. Lifetime risks contrasted sharply with shorter term risks: 
at age 40 years, the 10-year risks of CHD in tertiles 1, 2, and 3, respectively, 
were 0%, 2.2%, and 11.6% for men and 0%, 0.7%, and 2.3% for women. The 
Framingham 10-year CHD risk prediction model discriminated short-term risk well 
for men and women. However, it may not identify subjects with low short-term but 
high lifetime risk for CHD, likely due to changes in risk factor status over 
time. Further work is needed to generate multivariate risk models that can 
reliably predict lifetime risk for CHD.

BACKGROUND: The HIV epidemic has been associated with an increased incidence of 
specific cancers. However, less is known about cancers occurring in HIV-infected 
women than men.
METHODS: To determine the risk of cancer among HIV-infected and at-risk 
HIV-uninfected women, cancer incidence data from the Women's Interagency HIV 
Study (WIHS) were compared with data from the population-based United States 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. Age- and 
race-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were computed and exact 
statistical tests were used to measure significance.
RESULTS: Among the 1950 women participants (1554 HIV infected, 391 HIV 
uninfected, and 5 HIV seroconverters), 48 cancers were diagnosed during study 
follow-up. Among HIV-infected women, significantly (P < 0.05) increased 
incidence rates were observed for all cancer types (SIR = 1.9), Kaposi sarcoma 
(SIR = 213.5), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (SIR = 19.0), and lung cancer (SIR = 
6.3) when compared with SEER rates. Lung cancer incidence was also elevated (P = 
0.07) among the HIV-uninfected women (SIR = 6.9), when compared with SEER rates, 
and was similar to the SIR for HIV-infected women. While the incidence rate of 
NHL among HIV-infected women was significantly lower during the era of highly 
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) compared with the pre-HAART era (relative 
risk = 0.15, P = 0.005), the incidence of NHL among HIV-infected WIHS 
participants remained significantly higher than in the US population (SIR = 6.4, 
95% CI = 1.3-15.5).
CONCLUSION: In the HAART era, the higher rates of cancer among HIV-infected 
women, coupled with increased life expectancy, should lead to more intensive 
cancer screening and prevention efforts in this population.

Increasing life expectancy has led to an increase of medial femoral neck 
fractures. Treatment by hip arthroplasty is a major surgical procedure for 
geriatric patients and imposes high healthcare costs. Manninger developed a 
cannulated screw system which allows a joint-sparing, less invasive, and stable 
internal fixation for the management of intracapsular femoral neck fractures. In 
a prospective study from January 1998 to August 2002, 63 patients older than 70 
years with Garden type I to III fractures were treated by closed reduction and 
internal fixation with two Manninger screws on a traction table within the first 
6 h after trauma. Mean time of follow-up was 21.5+/-16 months. Of the patients 
examined, 88.5% regained their preoperative stage of mobility. Two patients 
needed secondary hip arthroplasty. Due to low complication and failure rates and 
less medical expenses compared to treatment by hemiprosthesis the joint-sparing, 
less invasive internal fixation with two cannulated Manninger screws presents a 
safe and cost-efficient surgical technique for geriatric patients.

The cost-effectiveness of aspirin versus cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors 
for colorectal carcinoma chemoprevention in healthy individuals.

BACKGROUND: Aspirin therapy is accepted widely for secondary prevention in 
patients with documented cardiovascular disease, but there is a growing trend 
among healthy individuals to use aspirin as primary chemoprevention for both 
cardiovascular and oncologic diseases. Accruing evidence suggests that 
cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors (coxibs) may be effective for colorectal 
carcinoma (CRC) chemoprevention but would not provide the primary cardiac 
benefit of aspirin.
METHODS: A computer-based Markov model simulated hypothetical cohorts of healthy 
men age 50 years who took either 325 mg of enteric-coated aspirin daily or 
celecoxib at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. Patients in both cohorts could 
develop drug-related complications that would lead to its discontinuation. The 
aspirin group also was modeled to have a decreased rate of coronary ischemic 
events; however, decreased CRC mortality was not modeled in either group based 
on the assumption that the two treatments were effective equally in this regard. 
Data sources included published literature and the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services. Endpoints used to compare the two strategies included 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), mortality and complication rates, and cost. 
The analysis was from a societal perspective with a time horizon of 10 years 
from age 50 years. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Aspirin therapy resulted in 0.03 more QALYs and cost $23,000 less than 
coxib therapy over a 10-year period. Compared with the aspirin group, the coxib 
group had 3.877% more complications and 0.17% more deaths. Alternatively stated, 
coxib therapy resulted in 1 patient complication or death for every 26 or 588 
patients treated with coxibs, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming equal efficacy in CRC prevention over a 10-year period, 
aspirin was both more effective and less costly than coxib therapy when used for 
primary chemoprevention of CRC.

Alegre, Brazil.

During the female vital cycle verbal processes are influenced by secondary 
effects of steroid hormones. Verbal expression abilities favor more effective 
interpersonal communications. Verbal motor fluency is produced by the 
synchronization among voice, resonance and articulation. The present study 
compared phono-articulatory characteristics between women in reproductive age 
and postmenopause. Acoustic variations in vocal intonation, speed of the speech 
and the pause pattern were measured. Forty-five reproductive age women with 
regular menstrual cycles and taking no hormonal contraceptives and 45 
postmenopause women receiving no hormonal replacement therapy for at least 3 
years were interviewed and their verbal productions were recorded. Acoustic 
analyses were performed using the Kay Elemetrics Motor Speech Profile. Student's 
t-test was employed to compare data between the two groups when they presented 
normal distribution, and Mann-Whitney test when they were asymmetrical. Results 
showed that in the postmenopause group pause pattern was longer, the speed of 
the speech was slower, there was a vocal deepening without reduction of the 
vocal extension and there was also less vocal stability. A better understanding 
in this field will make possible to elaborate strategies to offer a better life 
quality for postmenopausal women.

BACKGROUND: The edge-to-edge mitral valve repair, first described by Alfieri in 
1995 treats mitral regurgitation when standard reparative techniques are 
difficult, unlikely to succeed, or have failed. This study examines one 
institution's medium-term experience with this procedure.
METHODS: This study involved patients undergoing edge-to-edge mitral valve 
repair at a single institution from 1997 to 2003. Preoperative and postoperative 
echocardiograms were compared. Postoperative morbidity was examined including 
need for reoperation and long-term medical management. Thirty-day survival and 
long-term actuarial survival were also determined.
RESULTS: Seventy-one patients comprised this study. Mitral regurgitation on 
echocardiogram went from 3.43 +/- 0.86 to 0.39 +/- 0.61 (p < 0.001) following 
repair. Thirty-day mortality was 3 of 71 (4.2%) patients. Actuarial survivals at 
24 and 60 months were 84.5% and 58.3%, respectively; adjusted excluding 
noncardiac death they were 89.5% and 82.3%, respectively. Forty (56.3%) patients 
had concomitant ring placement and experienced similar survival to those 
repaired with the bow-tie stitch alone. Home telephone follow-up was conducted, 
and current medical therapy was determined on 51 patients; 59% were on a 
beta-blocker, 31% were on an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, 27% 
were on a diuretic, and 22% were on digoxin. All were New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) class I or II. Three patients (4.2%) underwent mitral valve reoperation 
after a mean of 299 +/- 429 days. In no case did the bow-tie suture rupture.
CONCLUSIONS: Edge-to-edge mitral valve repair is a valuable tool in the 
armamentarium available to treat complex cases of mitral insufficiency or as an 
adjunct to standard repair techniques that fail to achieve an acceptable result.

replacement.

BACKGROUND: Stroke is a devastating complication in patients with prosthetic 
valves, but characterization of its late occurrence from a large cohort is 
lacking.
METHODS: Three thousand one hundred eighty-nine adult patients who underwent a 
total of 3,576 operations for left-heart valve replacement were managed with 
contemporary anticoagulation guidelines and prospectively followed in a 
dedicated clinic. Total follow-up was 20,096 patient years. Bootstrapped 
survival analysis was used to determine the impact of patient and valve related 
factors on the incidence of stroke.
RESULTS: Most strokes were embolic. Linearized embolic stroke rates were 1.3% 
+/- 0.2% per year for aortic bioprostheses, 1.4% +/- 0.2% per year for aortic 
mechanical valves, 1.3% +/- 0.3% per year for mitral bioprostheses, and 2.3% +/- 
0.4% per year for mitral mechanical valves (p = 0.002, vs other implant types). 
Age more than 75 years, female gender, and smoking were independent risk factors 
after aortic and mitral valve replacement. Atrial fibrillation, coronary 
disease, and tilting-disc mechanical prostheses were independent predictors of 
embolic stroke after aortic valve replacement. Preoperative left ventricular 
(LV) dysfunction was an independent risk factor in patients with mitral 
prostheses. Primary operative indication, diabetes, redo status, or the presence 
of two prosthetic valves were not associated with an increased hazard. The 
addition of acetyl salicylic or dipyridamole to warfarin anticoagulation did not 
significantly lower embolic stroke risk in patients with mechanical prostheses.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 20% of patients with valve prostheses have an embolic 
stroke by 15 years after valve replacement. Some risk factors such as the 
avoidance of smoking, mitral mechanical prostheses, aortic tilting-disc valves, 
and proceeding to mitral surgery before LV dysfunction occurs are potentially 
modifiable.

BACKGROUND: The advancing age of the population in the western world and 
improvements in surgical techniques and postoperative care have resulted in an 
increasing number of very elderly patients undergoing cardiac operations. 
Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the surgical outcome in 115 
octogenarians after aortic valve replacement.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified 115 patients (47 men, 68 women) aged 82.3 
+/- 2.1 years (mean, 80 to 92 years) who underwent aortic valve replacement 
alone (71 patients, 62.1%) or in combination with coronary artery bypass 
grafting (44 patients, 37.9%), between January 1992 and April 2003. These 
patients had significant severe aortic stenosis with a mean valve area of 0.62 
+/- 0.15 cm(2) and a mean gradient of 88.62 +/- 24.06 mm Hg.
RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality rate was 8.5%. The late follow-up was 100% 
complete. Actuarial survival at 1 and 5 years was 86.4% and 69.4%, respectively. 
Predictors of late mortality were ejection fraction (p < 0.01), preoperative 
heart failure (p < 0.03), and the type of prosthesis (p < 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: The outcome after aortic valve replacement in octogenarians is 
excellent; the operative risk is acceptable and the late survival rate is good. 
Therefore, cardiac surgery should not be withheld on the basis of age alone.

BACKGROUND: The outcome in patients treated by conventional coronary artery 
bypass grafting (CABG) for coronary artery disease is negatively influenced by 
the presence of diabetes. The relative effect of diabetes in patients undergoing 
isolated minimally invasive revascularization of the left anterior descending 
artery (LAD) using the internal thoracic artery (ITA) has as yet not 
specifically been looked at. Thus, this study sought to evaluate the impact of 
diabetes on mid-term outcome following minimally invasive coronary artery bypass 
grafting (MIDCAB).
METHODS: From 1996 to 1999, 411 patients received a MIDCAB procedure at our 
institution and were now followed up. In this study population there were 63 
diabetic patients (15.3%) and 348 nondiabetic patients (84.7%). Isolated 
proximal stenoses or an occlusion of the LAD were present in 262 patients 
(63.7%), whereas 149 (36.3%) had multi-vessel disease (MVD) at the time of the 
MIDCAB procedure. The clinical outcome was evaluated by questionnaires sent to 
the patients and their physicians.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 29.4 +/- 11.1 months. The incidence of 
myocardial infarction was significantly higher in diabetics as compared to 
nondiabetics (9.5% vs 3.2%, p = 0.034). Diabetics and nondiabetics had similar 
rates of subsequent revascularization procedures during follow-up. Cumulative 
total survival of diabetic and nondiabetic patients was not statistically 
different. The 3-year cardiac mortality was however significantly higher in 
diabetic than in nondiabetic patients if MVD was initially present (Kaplan-Meier 
estimate: 10.7% vs 2.5%, relative risk [RR] = 5.5, p = 0.017 by log-rank test). 
The 3-year cardiac mortality in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with isolated 
disease of the LAD (single vessel disease [SVD]) was not significantly 
different. After adjustment of baseline characteristics by Cox regression 
analysis the 3-year risk of cardiac death was significantly higher in the 
diabetic group (RR = 1.82, CI 95%:1.2 to 3.3, p = 0.045).
CONCLUSIONS: The results support diabetes to be an independent risk factor for 
outcome in patients with MVD undergoing a MIDCAB procedure in analogy to those 
undergoing CABG procedures. Diabetics with isolated disease of the LAD, however, 
benefit out of proportion from this treatment modality.

Intraoperative ischemia and long-term events after minimally invasive coronary 
surgery.

Chieti, Italy. m.zimarino@unich.it

BACKGROUND: Concern has been raised about the effects of prolonged left anterior 
descending (LAD) artery occlusion during minimally invasive direct coronary 
artery bypass graft surgery (MIDCABG). We sought to assess the impact of 
myocardial dysfunction during MIDCABG on long-term outcome and the protective 
role of collateral circulation on myocardial ischemia.
METHODS: Myocardial function was evaluated in 92 patients by intraoperative 
transesophageal echocardiography during MIDCABG.
RESULTS: Wall motion score index increased during LAD occlusion (p < 0.00l) and 
reverted after LAD reopening (p < 0.001 versus occlusion and p = not significant 
versus baseline). The change in wall motion score index (occlusion versus 
baseline) was higher in patients with multivessel disease (p < 0.05) and in 
patients with LAD Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction study classification 
flow grade 2 or less without collateral circulation (p < 0.05). Myocardial 
stunning was documented in 12 patients (13%). The 5-year adverse event rate 
(including death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization) was 12%. By 
multivariate Cox regression analysis, multivessel disease, but not perioperative 
ischemia or stunning, was the only predictor of event-free survival.
CONCLUSIONS: During MIDCABG anterior wall dysfunction is transient, with prompt 
recovery after completion of the anastamosis in most cases; myocardial stunning 
can be documented in a minority of patients. Flow either antegrade or retrograde 
in the LAD territory plays a protective role against the development of 
ischemia. Multivessel disease, but not perioperative ischemia or stunning, 
predicts long-term event-free survival.

Cleveland Clinic, Ohio 44195, USA.

BACKGROUND: Apical ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are difficult to visualize 
through a transatrial approach, while the use of a left ventriculotomy may 
result in progressive ventricular dysfunction. Transcatheter closure has not 
been reliable, especially in small infants. Apical right ventriculotomy provides 
good exposure, preserves left ventricular function, and allows secure closure of 
apical VSDs.
METHODS: From November 1994 through April 2002, nine children, median age 8 
months (range, 74 days to 2.5 years) underwent 10 operations for VSD closure via 
apical right ventriculotomy (one patient with a residual defect underwent 
successful VSD closure via a second apical right ventriculotomy). Two patients 
were status post pulmonary artery banding and two patients had previous 
unsuccessful attempts at closure via a transatrial approach.
RESULTS: There was no hospital mortality; there were 2 late deaths (78% 
survival; 95% confidence interval [CI], 45% to 94%), 3 months and 4 years 
postoperatively. Postoperative echocardiography demonstrated no residual VSDs in 
3 and insignificant residual VSDs in 4 of the survivors. All survivors currently 
exhibit normal biventricular function during a median follow-up of 25 months 
(range, 11 to 104 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Apical right ventriculotomy provides excellent exposure allowing 
safe and effective closure of apical VSDs. The observed late morbidity and 
mortality reflects the complexity that often exists in these cases due to 
additional irreparable lesions.

Gender differences in non-small-cell lung cancer survival: an analysis of 4,618 
patients diagnosed between 1997 and 2002.

BACKGROUND: Gender has been reported as a predictor for nonsmall cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) survival. Most of the reports are limited to selected groups of 
patients. The magnitude of gender effect on NSCLC survival across disease stage, 
tumor histology, and therapies needs to be further characterized.
METHODS: A cohort of 4,618 patients diagnosed with NSCLC was prospectively 
enrolled and actively followed. Vital status of each patient was verified 
through multiple complementary sources. Cox proportional hazards models were 
developed to compare postdiagnosis survival between genders adjusting for age at 
diagnosis, tumor histology and grade, stage, pack-years smoked, and treatment 
received (resection, radiation, or chemotherapy).
RESULTS: There were 2,724 men (59%) and 1,894 women (41%), with a median age at 
diagnosis of 68 years in men and 66 in women (p < 0.01). More men smoked and 
were heavier smokers than women. Adenocarcinoma was the most frequent histology 
in both genders. No difference was found in stage and treatment between genders. 
The estimated survival in men was 51% (95% CI: 49%, 53%) and 15% (95% CI: 12%, 
17%) at one and five years, respectively, and in women was 60% (95% CI: 58%, 
62%) and 19% (95% CI: 16%, 22%). Men were at a significantly increased risk of 
mortality compared to women following a diagnosis of NSCLC (adjusted relative 
risk: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.30), particularly for patients with stage III/IV 
disease or adenocarcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Male gender is confirmed to be an independent unfavorable 
prognostic indicator for NSCLC survival.

BACKGROUND: The clinicopathologic features are still unknown in peripheral 
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, unlike centrally located carcinomas. In 
this retrospective study, we investigated the clinicopathologic characteristics 
of patients with peripheral squamous cell carcinomas.
METHODS: Of 1,381 primary lung carcinomas surgically resected at the National 
Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, from 1995 through 2001, 70 (5.1%) peripheral 
squamous cell carcinomas of 3.0 cm or less in diameter were studied 
retrospectively in terms of clinicopathologic characteristics such as age, sex, 
past history, smoking, tumor size, mode of operation, extent of lymph node 
dissection, pathologic lymph node status, mode of recurrence, and cause of 
death.
RESULTS: These patients ranged in age from 49 to 82 years, with a mean age of 
69.2 years. Thirty-nine patients (56%) were at increased risk preoperatively. 
The incidence of lymph node metastasis was 25%, and larger tumors tended to be 
associated with a higher prevalence, although this difference was not 
significant (p = 0.12). None of the patients with N2 disease had skipping 
metastasis. Recurrence was observed in 13 patients (19%). There was no 
significant correlation between recurrence and the extent of lymphadenectomy or 
the mode of operation. The 5-year overall and disease-specific survival rates 
were 73.4% and 85.9%, respectively. The cause of death was recurrence in 53% and 
other disease in 47%.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that mediastinal hilar lymphadenectomy should be 
routinely conducted as a curative operation for low-risk patients with small 
peripheral squamous cell carcinoma. We further propose that for patients who may 
have difficulty tolerating this procedure, pathologic examination of 
intraoperative frozen sections from the hilar node could be useful for planning 
a surgical strategy.

BACKGROUND: Segmental resection for stage I non-small cell lung cancer remains 
controversial. Reports suggest that segmentectomy confers no advantage in 
preserving lung function and compromises survival. This study was undertaken to 
assess the validity of those assertions.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing lobectomy (n = 147) or 
segmentectomy (n = 54) for stage I non-small cell lung cancer between March 1996 
and June 2001. All patients were included in the survival analysis. Pulmonary 
function testing was obtained preoperatively and at 1 year and included forced 
vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, maximum voluntary 
ventilation, diffusing capacity, and stair-stepper exercise. Patients with 
recurrent disease (lobectomy, n = 32; segmentectomy, n = 10) were excluded in 
the pulmonary function testing analysis to avoid the confounding variables of 
tumor or treatments.
RESULTS: Preoperative pulmonary function tests in segmentectomy patients were 
significantly reduced compared with lobectomy (forced expiratory volume in 1 
second, 75.1% versus 55.3%; p < 0.001). At 1 year, lobectomy patients 
experienced significant declines in forced vital capacity (85.5% to 81.1%), 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (75.1% to 66.7%), maximum voluntary 
ventilation (72.8% to 65.2%), and diffusing capacity (79.3% to 69.6%). In 
contrast, a decline in diffusing capacity was the only significant change seen 
after segmental resection. Oxygen saturations at rest and with exercise were 
maintained in both groups. Actuarial survival in both groups was similar (p = 
0.406) with a 1-year survival of 95% for lobectomy and 92% for segmentectomy. 
Four-year survivals were 67% and 62%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer, segmental 
resection offers preservation of pulmonary function compared with lobectomy and 
does not compromise survival. Segmentectomy should be considered whenever 
permitted by anatomic location.

cell lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: We retrospectively reviewed our 12-year experience in the surgical 
treatment of non-small cell lung cancer invading the left atrium. End points of 
the study were overall survival and factors potentially affecting survival.
METHODS: Nineteen consecutive patients with lung cancer invading the left atrium 
underwent surgery. Three patients with N2 disease underwent induction 
chemotherapy. Patients with either incomplete resections or pN2 disease received 
postoperative chemoradiotherapy.
RESULTS: Five-year survival was 14%, and the median survival time was 25 months. 
These figures refer to a very homogeneous group of patients with respect to the 
extent of atrial infiltration. Patients with N2 disease tended to have a worse 
outcome than patients with N0 or N1 disease (p = 0.06). The 3 patients with N2 
disease who underwent induction chemotherapy were alive and disease-free at 30, 
15, and 11 months from surgery. Survival was not affected by histology, type of 
surgery, or completeness of resection. Three patients with residual cancer in 
the atrial resection margin underwent postoperative chemoradiotherapy and are 
alive at 25, 17, and 15 months after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the poor survival rates we report, the present 
experience suggests that more-favorable results could be expected by the routine 
preoperative use of positron emission tomographic scan staging, a more-extensive 
assessment of atrial invasion, the application of induction chemotherapy in 
patients with N2 disease, and postoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with 
tumors abutting the atrial resection margin.

BACKGROUND: A pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal carcinoma is a generally 
accepted procedure, although several prognostic predictors have been reported. 
The aim of this study is to define the patients who benefit from pulmonary 
metastasectomy for colorectal carcinoma.
METHODS: Retrospective survival analysis was performed using 128 patients who 
underwent curative pulmonary resection.
RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival rate was 45.3%. Univariate analysis showed 
the number of metastases, location (unilateral or bilateral), prethoracotomy 
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, hilar or mediastinal lymph-node 
metastasis, and Dukes' stage to be considerable prognostic factors. Among these, 
Dukes' A for the primary lesion and unilateral pulmonary metastasis were shown 
to be independent predictors of longer survival by multivariate analysis (p = 
0.0093 and p = 0.0182, respectively). In patients treated with both pulmonary 
and hepatic metastastasectomies, a better prognosis was observed in those who 
received metachronous resection. Recurrence after a pulmonary metastasectomy 
frequently occurred in the thorax and the 3-year survival rate was 44.6% in 
patients who underwent a repeat thoracotomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with unilateral metastasis and Dukes' A for the primary 
tumor benefit most from the resection of pulmonary metastasis from colorectal 
carcinoma. Further, the number of metastases, prethoracotomy CEA level, and 
hilar or mediastinal lymph-node involvement should be considered to determine 
the operative indication. Finally, periodic follow-up examinations for thoracic 
recurrence should be carefully performed as these patients may have a heightened 
risk of requiring a repeat thoracotomy.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this research were to, in subjects with lower 
cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), examine the relationship between strength of 
muscle groups as measured by the manual muscle test (MMT) and function 
(reflected as burden of care) as measured by individual functional independence 
measure (FIM) motor tasks, and investigate the extent to which MMT scores 
explain the variance of the motor FIM scores.
SETTING: Acute rehabilitation hospitals, Boston, MA, USA.
METHODS: Retrospective pilot study of 20 in-patients, age 18-62 years, with an 
SCI between C5 and C7. Discharge demographic variables, MMT and motor FIM scores 
were analyzed. Descriptive statistics, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients, 
stepwise regressions were performed.
RESULTS: MMT scores for elbow flexion followed by shoulder flexion and wrist 
extension correlated with the greatest number of FIM tasks. MMT scores explained 
some part of the variance in the eight of 12 motor FIM tasks. In six of eight 
tasks, one key muscle explained a large portion of the variance.
CONCLUSION: Key muscles relative to FIM tasks can be identified. These findings 
may help focus therapeutic interventions aimed at achievement in these tasks.

Hip fracture is an important and costly problem. Therapy with the bisphosphonate 
risedronate effectively prevents hip and other fractures among women with 
established osteoporosis. Risedronate is a first-choice therapy option in the 
German Guidelines of the Dachverband Osteologie for Osteoporosis according to 
evidence-based medicine criteria for the treatment of postmenopausal 
osteoporosis, osteoporosis of the elderly (women aged > 75 years) and 
glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. There are few published economic 
evaluations of bisphosphonates in Germany. Therefore, an assessment of the 
cost-effectiveness of risedronate utilizing a state transition Markov model of 
established postmenopausal osteoporosis based on randomized clinical trial data 
was developed. Uncertainty underlying model parameters and outcomes was dealt 
with using traditional sensitivity analysis and stochastic sensitivity analysis 
to produce quasi-95% Cls. We focused on patients aged 70 years, since this 
population most closely matches the randomized controlled trial and is typical 
of osteoporosis patients in Germany. The baseline model was a cohort of 1,000 
70-year-old women, who received risedronate for 3 years and were followed up for 
an overall observation period of 10 years, modelling transitions through 
estimated health states and evaluating outcomes. Over the 3-year treatment 
period and 10-year observation period, risedronate dominated the current average 
basic treatment in Germany. In the risedronate group 33 hip fractures were 
averted and 32 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were gained (discounted 
values). Risedronate treatment saves costs for German social insurance: the 
present net value of the associated costs from the perspective of German social 
insurance is [symbol: see text]10.66 million if risedronate treatment is used 
versus [symbol: see text]11 million if basic treatment is used. Thus, net 
savings of [symbol: see text]340,000 for the treatment group per 1,000 treated 
women were calculated. Furthermore, risedronate treatment is cost effective from 
the perspective of the statutory health insurance with costs per averted hip 
fracture in the analyzed population of [symbol: see text]33,856 and cost per 
QALY gained of [symbol: see text]35,690. Both results demonstrate 
cost-effectiveness and are far below the accepted threshold level of [symbol: 
see text]50,000. Based on this analysis, risedronate is a cost-effective 
treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis within the German health care system, 
offering benefits for osteoporotic patients and for budget decision-makers.

Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, USA. kwarner@umich.edu

This paper presents results from a simulation of the financial impact and cost 
effectiveness of smoking cessation in a hypothetical managed care organization 
(MCO), using data from three large managed care organizations and from existing 
literature. With base-case assumptions and a market cost of capital, at five 
years, coverage of cessation services costs an MCO dollars .61 per member per 
month (PMPM). In a steady-state situation, net cost is dollars .41 PMPM. Both 
values include altered medical expenditures and MCO revenue patterns 
attributable to coverage-induced cessation. Quitters gain an average of 7.1 
years of life, with a direct coverage cost of dollars 3,417 for each life-year 
saved. Coverage of cost-effective programs by MCOs should be strongly 
encouraged.

Review article: targeted screening for hereditary haemochromatosis in high-risk 
groups.

DuBois S(1), Kowdley KV.

Patients with hereditary haemochromatosis are at risk for significant morbidity 
from iron overload as well as reduced life-expectancy once cirrhosis is 
established. Although inexpensive, sensitive screening tests and effective 
therapy are available, there is continued debate regarding the utility of 
screening for this condition because of recent data suggesting that the 
homozygous haemochromatosis mutation (C282Y) is associated with low penetrance 
and mild expressivity when identified in population screening studies. In this 
review, we examine the published data related to general population screening 
for haemochromatosis, as well as the evidence for screening selected 'high-risk' 
populations. We also suggest possible screening strategies based on the 
available evidence.

Teenage childbearing as cultural prism.

Postponing childbearing beyond the teenage years is now adaptive practice for 
European Americans. European American adults put this cultural priority into 
action and employ substantial social resources to disseminate the social control 
message meant for their youth that teenage childbearing has disastrous 
consequences. Yet, patterns of fertility-timing are culturally and historically 
variable. Early fertility-timing patterns may constitute adaptive practice for 
African American residents of high-poverty urban areas, in no small measure 
because they contend with structural constraints that shorten healthy life 
expectancy. The entrenched cultural interdependence of and social inequality 
between European and African Americans lead African Americans to be highly 
visible and vulnerable targets of moral condemnation for their fertility 
behaviour. This, in turn, sets up African Americans to pay a particularly high 
price politically, psychosocially, and in terms of their health.

The burden of ankylosing spondylitis and the cost-effectiveness of treatment 
with infliximab (Remicade).

OBJECTIVES: In the past, treatment options for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have 
been limited, and the introduction of new treatments such as infliximab will 
have a noticeable impact on health-care budgets. The objective of this study was 
therefore to assess the current burden of the disease and estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of infliximab treatments.
METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective observational study of resource 
consumption and utility related to disease severity was performed in patients 
who had participated in a population survey between 1992 and 1994 at the 
University of Bath and patients regularly followed at the Royal National 
Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in Bath for up to 9 years. Mean costs and 
utility were estimated using a regression model including age, gender, disease 
duration, disease activity and functional status, and disease development was 
expressed as annual progression of functional disability. Cost-effectiveness of 
infliximab was modelled using a 3-month placebo-controlled clinical trial with 
open 1-yr extension in 70 patients, over a total time frame of 2 yr. In the 
model, costs and utility controlled for disease severity and age from the 
observational study were assigned to individual patients. The effect of 
long-term treatment was evaluated in a hypothetical model over 30 yr.
RESULTS: Fifty-seven per cent of patients answered the questionnaires. The mean 
age was 57 (s.d. 11.2) yr, 74% were male and mean disease duration was 30.2 
(11.7) yr. Mean total costs were estimated at pound 6765 (s.d. pound 166). 
Indirect costs represented 57.9% and non-medical costs such as investments and 
informal care accounted for 16.5% of total costs. Mean utility was 0.67 (0.21). 
In the main model, mean costs for untreated patients are estimated at pound 
25,128. For the infliximab group, mean costs (excluding treatment) are estimated 
at pound 17,240, a reduction of 31%. Thus, part of the treatment cost was offset 
by savings in other resources ( pound 7888), leaving an incremental cost of 
pound 6214. Treatment increased the number of quality-adjusted live years 
(QALYs) by 0.175 QALYs, leading to a cost per QALY gained of pound 35,400 for 
the first year of treatment. When treatment is assumed to continue for the full 
2 yr, the cost per QALY is pound 32,800. When infliximab infusions are given 
every 8 weeks instead of every 6 weeks, the cost per QALY is reduced to pound 
17,300. In the long-term model, the cost per QALY is estimated at pound 9600.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-medical costs and production losses dominate costs in AS, and 
economic evaluation must therefore adopt a societal perspective. The cost of 
treatment with infliximab is partly offset by reductions in the cost of the 
disease and patients' quality of life is increased, leading to a cost per QALY 
gained in the vicinity of pound 30,000 to pound 40,000 in the short term, but 
potentially below pound 10,000 in the long term.

Progressive cerebellar tonsillar herniation with recurrent divergence 
insufficiency esotropia.

Pokharel D(1), Siatkowski RM.

Author information:
(1)College of Medicine, University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA.

The Chiari malformations are characterized by herniation of posterior fossa 
contents through the foramen magnum. Chiari I malformation is currently defined 
as ectopia of the cerebellar tonsils more than 5 mm below the foramen magnum. 
Extension of the cerebellar tonsils up to 3 mm may be found in the normal 
population. Although Chiari malformations are congenital, symptoms often do not 
manifest until the third and fourth decades of life, or even later. Patients 
usually present with headache, lower cranial nerve palsies, downbeat nystagmus, 
ataxia, or dissociated anesthesia of the trunk and extremities. Definitive 
diagnosis is made by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which shows the 
compressed tonsils extending through the foramen magnum into the cervical 
subarachnoid space. One of the rare presenting signs of Chiari I malformations 
is acquired esotropia with a divergence insufficiency pattern. We report such a 
case in which the initial neuroimaging showed tonsillar herniation, but of 
insufficient magnitude to meet diagnostic criteria for Chiari I malformation. 
When the strabismus recurred after initially successful eye muscle surgery, 
follow-up scan showed progressive tonsillar herniation.

Zhi Road, Hangzhou, P.R.China, 310009. gqding@cdc.zj.cn

In Zhejiang province economic development and changes in nutrition appear to 
have increased both life expectancy and nutrition-related chronic disease 
morbidity. Life expectancy is longer in urban populations than in rural and in 
both urban and rural females. From 1997 to 2002 urban females had an average 
life expectancy of 81.4 years. In 2002 the estimated incidence of ischaemic 
heart disease was higher in rural males and females whereas diabetes mellitus 
was higher in urban males and females. From 1990 to 2002 lung cancer had large 
increases in all groups, cancers of the oesophagus and stomach increased in 
rural males and females, and cancer of the large intestine increased 40 per cent 
in urban males. In 2002 deaths from cerebrovascular disease were much higher in 
rural males and females. Apart from differences in lifestyle factors between 
urban and rural, access to medical resources may also be relevant to the 
differences within the province in chronic disease rates and in life expectancy.

Netherlands. m.kruijshaar@erasmusmc.nl

BACKGROUND: The burden of breast cancer expressed in Disability Adjusted Life 
Years (DALYs) was compared for six European countries and its sensitivity to 
different sources of variation examined.
METHODS: DALYs were calculated using country-specific epidemiological data and 
European Disability Weights. Epidemiological data for 1996 were obtained for 
Denmark, England and Wales, France, The Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. 
Disability weights were empirically derived.
RESULTS: Denmark and The Netherlands lost the largest number of DALYs 
(approximately 1100 DALYs per 100,000 women). They were followed by England (87% 
of the Danish burden), France (72%), Sweden (68%) and Spain (67%). 70 to 80% of 
the burden was caused by mortality. Cross-national variation in disease 
epidemiology was the largest source of variation in the burden of breast cancer. 
Variation in disability weights and uncertainty in epidemiological data had 
smaller effects.
CONCLUSION: To compare the burden of breast cancer and most other types of 
cancer mortality rates provide sufficient information.
