evidence exists regarding treatment failure among Ethiopian children from 
multicenter settings. Therefore, this study sought to assess the incidence and 
predictors of treatment failure among children with HIV on first-line 
antiretroviral therapy at health facilities in Wolaita zone, Southern Ethiopia.
METHODS: A facility-based retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 
1, 2017, to December 30, 2021, at health facilities providing ART in Wolaita 
zone, Southern Ethiopia. A total of 425 children with HIV on first-line ART were 
selected using a simple random sampling technique. Data were extracted by 
reviewing the patient's medical record. The data were entered using epi-data 
version 4.6 and exported to STATA version 15 for analysis. Both bi-variable and 
multivariable Cox regression analysis were employed. A p-value of less than 0.05 
and a hazard ratio with 95 % CI was used to estimate the association between the 
predictor factors and treatment failure.
RESULTS: The overall incidence density rate of treatment failure was 3.2 per 
1000 person-months of observation (95 % CI: 2.4-4.6). The factors significantly 
associated with antiretroviral treatment failure were caregiver marital status, 
single (AHR = 4.86, 95 % CI: 1.52, 15.60), and widowed (AHR = 3.75, 95 % CI: 
1.16, 12.11), duration of follow-up (AHR = 4.95, 95 % CI: 1.81, 13.54), and 
baseline CD4 count (AHR = 4.70, 95 % CI: 1.68, 13.14).
CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of ART failure among children with HIV was found 
to be significant. Low baseline CD4 count, short follow-up duration on ART, and 
having a single or widowed caregiver were significantly associated with 
antiretroviral treatment failure. Early identification of children with low CD4 
count and subsequent initiation of ART should be emphasized by stakeholders 
working in HIV care programs. Healthcare professionals should pay special 
attention to and regularly monitor the treatment progress of children who have 
single or widowed caregivers, and those with shorter duration of follow-ups.

This study aims to conduct a systematic review of full economic analyses of 
robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) in adults' thoracic and abdominopelvic 
indications. Authors used Medline, EMBASE, and PubMed to conduct a systematic 
review following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Fully published economic articles in 
English were included. Methodology and reporting quality were assessed using 
standardized tools. Majority of studies (28/33) were on oncology procedures. 
Radical prostatectomy was the most reported procedure (16/33). Twenty-eight 
studies used quality-adjusted life years, and five used complication rates as 
outcomes. Nine used primary and 24 studies used secondary data. All studies used 
modeling. In 81% of studies (27/33), RAS was cost-effective or potentially 
cost-effective compared to comparator procedures, including radical 
prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and cystectomy. Societal perspective, longer-term 
time-horizon, and larger volumes favored RAS. Cost-drivers were length of stay 
and equipment cost. From societal and payer perspectives, robotic-assisted 
surgery is a cost-effective strategy for thoracic and abdominopelvic 
procedures.Clinical trial registration This study is a systematic review with no 
intervention, not a clinical trial.

Aggregation of proteins is a biological phenomenon caused by misfolded proteins. 
Human superoxide dismutase (hSOD1) misfolding and aggregation underlie the 
neurological illness amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The most significant 
contributing factor to ALS is genetic point mutations in SOD1. particularly, 
D101G mutant is the most harmful because it significantly reduces the life 
expectancy of patients. Subsequently, the use of natural polyphenolic flavonoids 
is strongly recommended to reduce the amyloidogenic behavior of protopathic 
proteins. In this study, using computational parameters such as protein-ligand 
interaction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analyses, we are trying to 
identify a pharmacodynamically promising flavonoid compound that can effectively 
inhibit the pathogenic behavior of the D101G mutant. Epigallocatechin-gallate 
(EGCG), Hesperidin, Isorhamnetin, and Diosmetin were identified as potential 
leads in a preliminary screening of flavonoids to anti-amyloid action. The 
results of MD showed that the binding of flavonoids to D101G mutant caused 
changes in stability, hydrophobicity of protein, and flexibility, as well as 
significantly led to the restoration of lost hydrogen bonds. Secondary structure 
analysis showed that protein destabilization and the increased propensity of 
β-sheet caused by the mutation were restored to the wild-type state upon binding 
of flavonoids. Besides, to differentiate aggregation, we elucidated alterations 
in the free energy landscape (FEL) and dynamic cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) 
of WT-SOD1 and mutant (unbound /bound) states. Among flavonoids, 
Epigallocatechin-gallate and Hesperidin had the most therapeutic efficacy 
against the D101G mutant. Therefore, Epigallocatechin-gallate and Hesperidin 
promise considerable therapeutic potential to develop highly effective 
inhibitors in reducing fatal and irreversible ALS.

A capsular polysaccharide, namely CPS-2, was isolated from Lactobacillus 
fermentum GBJ, purified using DEAE-52 anion exchange chromatography, and 
structurally characterized. We found that CPS-2 is homogenous, has an average 
molecular weight of 377 KDa, and is mainly composed of galactose and glucose at 
a molar ratio of 1.54:1.00. Its backbone comprises α-D-Galp-(1 → 3), 
α-D-Galp-(1 → 3,6), β-D-Glcp-(1 → 2), β-D-Galp-(1 → 6), and α-D-Galp-(1 → 4) 
residues with a side chain of β-D-Glcp-(1→). CPS-2 exerts an immunomodulatory 
effect by improving the proliferation and phagocytosis of macrophage RAW264.7 
and promoting the secretion of NO and cytokines. The maximum secretion levels of 
IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α were 1.96-, 0.11-, 0.22-, and 0.46-fold higher 
than those of the control, respectively. Furthermore, CPS-2 could significantly 
enhance the antioxidant system, extend lifespan, and improve stress tolerance of 
Caenorhabditis elegans at both exposure doses of 31.25 and 62.5 μg/mL. The 
average lifespan of nematodes reached a maximum in the 62.5 μg/mL-treated group 
after 10.39 days, 6.56 h, and 23.56 h in normal, oxidative stress, and heat 
shock environment, with extension percentages of 16.61 %, 43.23 %, and 15.77 %, 
respectively; therefore, CPS-2 displays an anti-aging effect. The significant 
bioactivity of CPS-2 promotes its application as a promising immunomodulatory 
and anti-aging ingredient in the food or pharmaceutical field.

Amyloidosis includes a heterogeneous group of diseases caused by the 
extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrillar proteins, leading to multiple 
organ dysfunction and a poor life expectancy. In the early stages of 
amyloidosis, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are uncommon. We describe a rare 
case of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) with involvement of the 
heart, nervous system and GI tract. A man in his 60s was hospitalised due to 
chronic diarrhoea, orthostatic hypotension, malabsorption and weight loss. An 
organic origin for the diarrhoea was suspected, but the most common causes were 
ruled out. The review of GI biopsies and an abdominal fat aspirate confirmed the 
diagnosis of amyloidosis. The diagnosis of ATTRv amyloidosis with GI 
presentation is challenging, especially in the early stages, and misdiagnosis is 
common. The recent approval of therapies emphasises the importance of early 
diagnosis to prevent irreversible organ damage.

The expansion of marine aquaculture requires the shipment of early life stages 
from hatcheries to breeding centers. Thus, maintaining water quality parameters 
during transportation is crucial. This experiment investigated the effects of a 
commercial probiotic mixture (PM) (consisting of Bacillus licheniformis, 
Bacillus subtilis, Pedicoccus acidilactici, and Lactobacillus acidophilus with a 
total count of 107 CFU/g) on water quality, bacterial population, and the 
survival of Acanthopagrus latus larvae during a 24-hour simulated transportation 
experiment. To simulate transportation, purified seawater was used as control 
and purified seawater supplemented with 3 g of PM was used as the PM48 
treatment. For the PM48 treatment, 3 g of PM was added to 1 L of purified 
seawater and mixed with 200 L of purified seawater 48 hours prior to the main 
experiment. The use of probiotics resulted in an increase in larval survival up 
to 93.3% compared to 89.85% in the control group. Initial sampling showed a 
statistically significant difference in NO2 - levels between the control and 
PM48 treatments. After transportation, the pH of the control treatment showed a 
significant decrease. The total number of bacteria and the total number of 
Vibrio spp. in water and fish larvae showed that within 48 hours, the probiotics 
became the dominant population in the PM48 treatment. After 24 hours, water 
samples and larvae from the control treatment showed a significant increase in 
bacterial load. In conclusion, the results showed that probiotics can play a 
significant role in maintaining biotic and abiotic water quality parameters, 
leading to a better survival rate of larvae during transportation. These 
findings represent an important step in improving long-distance transport 
protocols.

INTRODUCTION: Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a significant reason for secondary 
hypertension. Impaired renal function and subsequent cardiopulmonary dysfunction 
could also occur. Patients of non-atherosclerotic RAS has a relatively young age 
and long life expectancy. Revascularization with percutaneous transluminal 
angioplasty (PTA) is a viable treatment option. However, restenosis is 
unavoidable which limits its use. Drug-coated balloon (DCB) has been proven to 
be effective in restenosis prevention in femoropopliteal arterial diseases and 
in patients with renal artery stenosis. And PTA for Renal artery fibromuscular 
dysplasia is safe and clinically successful. Therefore, we could speculate that 
DCB might have potential efficacy in non-atherosclerotic RAS treatment.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a randomized multi-center-controlled trial. 
Eighty-four eligible participants will be assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to 
the control group (plain old balloon, POB) and the experimental group (DCB). 
Subjects in the former group will receive balloon dilatation alone, and in the 
latter group will undergo the DCB angioplasty. The DCB used in this study will 
be a paclitaxel-coated balloon (Orchid, Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited, 
Beijing, China). Follow-up visits will be scheduled 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months 
after the intervention. Primary outcomes will include controlled blood pressure 
and primary patency in the 9-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include 
technical success rate, complication rate, and bail-out stenting rate.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals continues to 
increase, vigilant monitoring of non-AIDS-related events becomes imperative, 
particularly those pertaining to liver diseases. In comparison to the general 
population, HIV-infected patients experience a higher frequency of Liver-related 
deaths. The CD4/CD8 ratio is emerging as a potential biomarker for 
non-AIDS-related events. However, few existing studies have been specially 
designed to explore the relationship between the CD4/CD8 ratio and specific 
types of non-AIDS-related events, notably liver damage.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the potential association between the 
CD4/CD8 ratio and the development of liver damage in a sizable cohort of 
HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART). Additionally, 
the study sought to assess the effectiveness of three antiretroviral drugs in 
recovering the CD4/CD8 ratio and reducing the occurrence of liver damage within 
this population.
METHODS: An observational cohort study was conducted among HIV-infected adults 
receiving ART from 2004 to 2020 in Guangxi, China. Propensity score matching, 
multivariable Cox proportional hazard and Fine-Gray competing risk regression 
models were employed to determine the relationship between CD4/CD8 ratio 
recovered and liver damage.
RESULTS: The incidence of liver damage was 20.12% among 2,440 eligible 
individuals during a median follow-up period of four person-years. Patients 
whose CD4/CD8 ratio did not recover to 1.0 exhibited a higher incidence of liver 
damage compared to patients with CD4/CD8 ratio recovered (adjusted HR = 7.90, 
95% CI 4.39-14.21, P < 0.001; sub-distribution HR = 6.80, 95% CI 3.83-12.11, P < 
0.001), findings consistent with to the PSM analysis (aHR = 6.94, 95% CI 
3.41-14.12, P < 0.001; sHR = 5.67, 95% CI 2.74-11.73, P< 0.001). The 
Efavirenz-based regimen exhibited the shortest time for CD4/CD8 ratio 
recovery(71 months IQR 49-88) and demonstrated a lower prevalence of liver 
damage (4.18 / 100 person-years).
CONCLUSIONS: Recovery of the CD4/CD8 ratio was associated with a decreased risk 
of liver damage in HIV-infected patients receiving ART, adding evidence for 
considering the CD4/CD8 ratio as a potential marker for identifying individuals 
at risk of non-AIDS-related diseases. Efavirenz-based regimen emerged as a 
recommended choice for recovering the CD4/CD8 ratio and mitigating the risk of 
liver damage.

Burn injuries pose a significant healthcare burden worldwide, often leading to 
long-term disabilities and reduced quality of life. To explore the impacts of 
the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the healing of burns and 
the levels of serum cytokines, 60 fully grown Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly 
divided into three groups (n = 20 each): group I (control), group II (burn 
induction), and group III (burn induction + bone marrow (BM)-MSC 
transplantation). Groups II and III were further divided into four subgroups 
(n = 5 each) based on euthanasia duration (7, 14, 21, and 28 days post 
transplant). The experiment concluded with an anesthesia overdose for rat death. 
After 7, 14, 21, and 28 days, the rats were assessed by clinical, laboratory, 
and histopathology investigations. The results revealed significant improvements 
in burn healing potentiality in the group treated with MSC. Furthermore, 
cytokine levels were measured, with significant increases in interleukin (IL)-6 
and interferon alpha (IFN) observed, while IL-10 and transforming growth factor 
beta (TGF-β) decreased at 7 days and increased until 28 days post burn. Also, 
the group that underwent the experiment exhibited increased levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 when 
compared to the control group. Histological assessments showed better 
re-epithelialization, neovascularization, and collagen deposition in the 
experimental group, suggesting that MSC transplantation in burn wounds may 
promote burn healing by modulating the immune response and promoting tissue 
regeneration.

INTRODUCTION: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) can significantly improve quality of 
life (QOL) in patients with hip osteoarthritis. A relationship exists between 
activity levels and postoperative QOL, but its determinants are not well known. 
The aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between hip, pelvis and 
lumbar spine mobility and alignment before and after THA with QOL.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with hip arthrosis and an indication 
for THA were included prospectively between July 2019 and December 2020, and 
they underwent lateral radiographs in free-standing, extension, relaxed- and 
flexed-seated position. Spinopelvic and hip parameters were measured, as well as 
their changes between positions to assess hip, pelvis and lumbar spine mobility. 
Patients were also administered QOL questionnaires. Data were collected 
preoperatively and 6 and 12 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: Seventy patients were included; QOL significantly increased 6 months 
after THA (from 18 [10; 27] to 61 [48; 72], p < 0.001). QOL further increased by 
10 points or more after 6 months in 18% of patients, while it decreased in 16%. 
The latter showed higher pelvic range of motion (between flexion and extension) 
than the former.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that QOL is significantly improved by THA, and 
that spinopelvic alignment and function can play a role. Future work should 
elucidate how to better predict postoperative QOL from preoperative patient 
characteristics to improve patient treatment and establish early postoperative 
physical therapy for patients who could benefit from postoperative improvement 
of activity-related QOL.

INTRODUCTION: Active duty military personnel and veterans have unique and 
complex health needs, with the high demands of military life often leading to 
chronic physical and mental health conditions. Complementary and integrative 
medicine (CIM) could be a possible solution to this problem. Some military 
health systems have started integrating CIM into health care delivery. However, 
there has been no systematic evaluation of the prevalence and utilization of CIM 
in military and veteran populations globally.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analysis Protocols protocol was used to systematically search for original 
research assessing the prevalence and utilization of CIM among active serving 
military or veterans. CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus, and AMED databases were searched 
up to February 3, 2023.
RESULTS: A total of 27 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in 
this review. The overall quality of evidence was high with a low risk of bias. 
Utilization of CIM varied. The lowest utilization demonstrated that only 1.9% of 
services delivered by military health system were CIM. The majority of studies 
found utilization rates between 30% and 80%, with some studies reporting use as 
high as 90%. The most commonly used CIM therapies included chiropractic care, 
massage, mindfulness/meditation, and acupuncture. Utilization of CIM products 
was high and ranged from 32% to 87%. The most frequently used products were 
dietary supplements, particularly multivitamins and minerals and protein 
supplements/amino acids. The use of herbal products was high among veterans 
ranging from 10% to 79%.
CONCLUSIONS: The high demand for CIM by military personnel and veterans has 
important implications for policy, funding allocation, and integration of these 
services into clinical practice, particularly by countries not currently doing 
so. Further research is needed to assess the implementation of CIM into 
real-world settings to explore barriers and facilitators for their use in 
clinical practice and, by extension, their integration into the wider health 
care system.

OBJECTIVE: To provide an integrated approach for deprescribing practice in 
oncology setting.
DATA SOURCES: The data on deprescribing in oncology settings has been retrieved 
from the PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar. We used "deprescribing," 
"potentially inappropriate medication" and "cancer" as a keyword for the 
conducting general search. The articles relevant to guidelines or tools used to 
deprescribe in cancer care were included.
DATA SUMMARY: The nature of cancer, its treatment strategies, adverse effects of 
therapy and multimorbidity impact negatively on quality of life (QoL). Further, 
they invite polypharmacy which puts the patient at higher risk of drug-related 
problems like drug interactions, adverse drug reactions and addition of 
potentially improper medications, etc. In older adults with cancer, the 
incidence of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) was between 41% and 
52%. Over the decades, multiple strategies have been developed to assess the 
appropriateness of therapy. One such approach is deprescribing. OncPal and 
oncoSTRIP (Systematic Tool to Reduce Inappropriate Prescribing) are the cancer 
specific guidelines whereas BEERs criteria, Screening Tool to Alert to Right 
Treatment/Screening Tool of Older Person's Prescriptions criteria (START/STOPP 
criteria), medication appropriateness index (MAI) are the cancer nonspecific 
tools to identify PIM among cancer patients. Here, we provided an integrative 
approach and algorithm for deprescribing in oncology setting which includes 
patient and caregiver goals, life expectancy (LE), review of medications, 
determining medication appropriateness, assessment of time to benefit (TTB), 
symptomatic and asymptomatic care, identifying medications to cease, 
implementation of the plan, monitoring and reviewing.
CONCLUSION: Deprescribing in oncology setting is a novel and effective 
patient-centric approach to counteract the use of PIM, which helps to mitigate 
polypharmacy, drug-drug interactions, and adverse effects.

An intense public debate has fuelled governmental bans on marine mammals held in 
zoological institutions. The debate rests on the assumption that survival in 
zoological institutions has been and remains lower than in the wild, albeit the 
scientific evidence in support of this notion is equivocal. Here, we used 
statistical methods previously applied to assess historical improvements in 
human lifespan and data on 8864 individuals of four marine mammal species 
(harbour seal, Phoca vitulina; California sea lion, Zalophus californianus; 
polar bear, Ursus maritimus; common bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus) held 
in zoos from 1829 to 2020. We found that life expectancy increased up to 3.40 
times, and first-year mortality declined up to 31%, during the last century in 
zoos. Moreover, the life expectancy of animals in zoos is currently 1.65-3.55 
times longer than their wild counterparts. Like humans, these improvements have 
occurred concurrently with advances in management practices, crucial for 
population welfare. Science-based decisions will help effective legislative 
changes and ensure better implementation of animal care.

BACKGROUND: Extended infusion (EI) of beta-lactam antibiotics may offer clinical 
benefits aligned with improved probability of target attainment for critical 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters that correlate with efficacy. There 
is much research interest in prolonged and continuous infusions (collectively, 
extended infusions) of beta-lactams to improve patient outcomes, particularly in 
critically ill patients in intensive care. While definitive clinical trial data 
demonstrating beneficial outcomes is awaited, there has been limited focus on 
the stability of the agents given by EI, which may be an equally critical 
parameter. EI may allow for savings in nursing time due to reduced need for drug 
reconstitution. We set out to examine the data for stability for EI at room 
temperature, consistent with the requirements of 'A Standard Protocol for 
Deriving and Assessment of Stability- Part 1 Aseptic Preparation (Small 
Molecules)', which allows a 5% loss of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) 
applicable for those territories that use the British Pharmacopoeia also for a 
10% loss applicable in much of rest of the world.
METHODS: Searches using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses (PRISMA) principles for stability data on freshly prepared 
beta-lactam antimicrobials for extended administration at room temperature (at 
or above 23°C) were conducted in November 2021 and updated in December 2022.
RESULTS: We found data to support the extension of the shelf life of 12 key 
beta-lactam antibiotics once reconstituted (aztreonam, amoxicillin, 
benzylpenicillin, flucloxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefazolin, 
cefmetazole, ceftaroline, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and meropenem) 
compliant with the NHS protocol, and data for five other agents (ticarcillin, 
cefepime, cefiderocol, cefoxitin and doripenem) which would be acceptable in 
regions outside the UK beyond that listed in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics.This review has not been registered under PROSPERO.

BACKGROUND: There has been growing interest in the UK and internationally of 
risk-stratified breast screening whereby individualised risk assessment may 
inform screening frequency, starting age, screening instrument used, or even 
decisions not to screen. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of eight 
proposals for risk-stratified screening regimens compared to both the current UK 
screening programme and no national screening.
METHODS: A person-level microsimulation model was developed to estimate 
health-related quality of life, cancer survival and NHS costs over the lifetime 
of the female population eligible for screening in the UK.
RESULTS: Compared with both the current screening programme and no screening, 
risk-stratified regimens generated additional costs and QALYs, and had a larger 
net health benefit. The likelihood of the current screening programme being the 
optimal scenario was less than 1%. No screening amongst the lowest risk group, 
and triannual, biennial and annual screening amongst the three higher risk 
groups was the optimal screening strategy from those evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that risk-stratified breast cancer screening has the 
potential to be beneficial for women at the population level, but the net health 
benefit will depend on the particular risk-based strategy.

BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been used to relieve chronic pain in patients with 
knee osteoarthritis (KOA), but the evidence is contradictory. Therefore, we 
carefully designed a double-dummy randomized controlled trial (RCT) to explore 
the therapeutic effect of acupuncture for KOA.
METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 138 eligible participants with KOA who consent to 
participate will be randomly divided into Groups A, B, and C in a ratio of 
1:1:1. Participants in Group A will receive verum acupuncture and placebo gel, 
while those in Groups B and C will be treated with diclofenac diethylammon gel 
and sham acupuncture, sham acupuncture and placebo gel, respectively. The 
patients will receive 4 weeks of treatment, five times a week, including 
acupuncture treatment once a day for 30 min and gel treatment three times a day. 
The primary outcome will be the change of Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) at week 4. The secondary outcomes will 
include visual analog scale (VAS), Arthritis Quality of Life Measurement Scale 
Simplified Scale (AIMS2-SF), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression 
Inventory (BDI) and Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire. The evaluation will be 
performed at baseline, week 4, 8, and 12 after randomization.
DISCUSSION: This double-dummy RCT used diclofenac diethylammon gel as a positive 
control, and the completion of this trial will provide detailed and accurate 
evidence of the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for KOA.

PURPOSE: The quality of life of worldwide adolescents has been seriously 
affected by depression. Notably, the inflammatory response is closely associated 
with the pathophysiology of depression. The present study applied a novel 
targeted proteomics technology, Olink proximity extension assay (PEA), to 
profile circulating immune-related proteins in adolescents with depression.
METHODS: In the present study, the expression levels of 92 inflammation-related 
proteins were compared between adolescents with depression (ADs) (n=15) and 
healthy controls (HCs) (n=15), using the OLINK PEA inflammation panel. We 
further validated 5 top proteins that were identified through KEGG and GO 
analyses between 40 HCs and 50 ADs, including CCL4, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL11, and 
IL-18 using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: We identified 13 differentially expressed proteins between the two 
cohorts, including 5 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated proteins. Among them, the 
TRAIL protein levels were significantly negatively correlated with the HAMA-14 
score (r=-0.538, p= 0.038), and the levels of transforming growth factor α 
(TGF-α) were significantly associated with a change in appetite (r = -0.658, 
p = 0.008). After validation by ELISA, CCL4, CXCL5, CXCL11, and IL-18 showed 
significant changes between ADs and HCs (p < 0.05), while CXCL6 showed an 
up-regulated tendency in ADs (p=0.0673). The pooled diagnostic efficacy (area 
under the curve [AUC]) of these five inflammation markers in clinical diagnosis 
for adolescent depression was 0.819 (95% CI: 0.735-0.904).
CONCLUSION: We report a number of inflammation-related plasma biomarkers, which 
uncover a potential involvement of chemokines, cytokines, and cytokine receptors 
in adolescent depression. Their roles in the pathophysiology of depression need 
to be further elucidated.

Successful clinical methods for tumor elimination include a combination of 
surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is one of the 
crucial components of the cancer treatment regimens which allow to extend 
patient life expectancy. Current cutting-edge radiotherapy research is focused 
on the identification of methods that should increase cancer cell sensitivity to 
radiation and activate anti-cancer immunity mechanisms. Radiation treatment 
activates various cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and impacts tumor 
growth, angiogenesis, and anti-cancer immunity. Radiotherapy was shown to 
regulate signaling and anti-cancer functions of various TME immune and 
vasculature cell components, including tumor-associated macrophages, dendritic 
cells, endothelial cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), natural killers, 
and other T cell subsets. Dual effects of radiation, including 
metastasis-promoting effects and activation of oxidative stress, have been 
detected, suggesting that radiotherapy triggers heterogeneous targets. In this 
review, we critically discuss the activation of TME and angiogenesis during 
radiotherapy which is used to strengthen the effects of novel immunotherapy. 
Intracellular, genetic, and epigenetic mechanisms of signaling and clinical 
manipulations of immune responses and oxidative stress by radiotherapy are 
accented. Current findings indicate that radiotherapy should be considered as a 
supporting instrument for immunotherapy to limit the cancer-promoting effects of 
TME. To increase cancer-free survival rates, it is recommended to combine 
personalized radiation therapy methods with TME-targeting drugs, including 
immune checkpoint inhibitors.
