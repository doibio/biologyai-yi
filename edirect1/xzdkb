Newer biologic drugs and immunomodulatory agents, as well as more tolerated and 
effective radiation therapy schemes, have reduced treatment toxicity in oncology 
patients. However, although imaging assessment of tumor response is adapting to 
atypical responses like tumor flare, expected changes and complications of 
chemo/radiotherapy are still routinely encountered in post-treatment imaging 
examinations. Radiologists must be aware of old and newer therapeutic options 
and related side effects or complications to avoid a misinterpretation of 
imaging findings. Further, advancements in oncology research have increased life 
expectancy of patients as well as the frequency of long-term therapy-related 
side effects that once could not be observed. This pictorial will help 
radiologists tasked to detect therapy-related complications and to differentiate 
expected changes of normal tissues from tumor relapse.

Characterising myxozoan taxa parasitising fish hosts in catfish aquaculture 
ponds is crucial to understanding myxozoan community dynamics in these diverse 
and complex ecological systems. This work investigated the myxozoan fauna of the 
western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, a common, incidental species found in 
catfish aquaculture ponds in the southeastern United States. 598 fish were 
sampled in May of 2018 and 2019 from the pond facility of the Thad Cochran 
National Warmwater Aquaculture Center in Stoneville, Mississippi, USA. Fish were 
examined microscopically using wet mount preparations of fresh tissue and 
histology for myxozoans. 18S rRNA gene sequences were amplified from myxospores 
obtained at necropsy. Updated morphologic, histologic, and 18S rRNA gene 
sequence features are provided for Henneguya gambusi, Myxobolus pharyngeus, and 
Myxidium phyllium. Two potentially novel myxozoans were observed during this 
survey, an undocumented Myxobolus sp. associated with chondrolysis of bones 
throughout the body and a putative Myxobilatus sp. observed histologically in 
the renal tubules, ureters, and urinary bladder. However, inadequate samples 
were obtained for proper species descriptions. Lastly, the life cycle of M. 
pharyngeus, which is thought to utilize the oligochaete worm Dero digitata as 
their definitive host, was putatively confirmed by 18S rRNA sequence matching to 
actinospore stages from oligochaetes in catfish ponds in Mississippi. This work 
provides novel and expanded morphologic, histologic, molecular and biologic data 
of five myxozoan parasites of G. affinis, expanding our knowledge of myxozoan 
diversity in catfish aquaculture ponds.

The burden of an epidemic is often characterized by death counts, but this can 
be misleading as it fails to acknowledge the age of the deceased patients. Years 
of life lost is therefore widely used as a more relevant metric, however, such 
calculations in the context of COVID-19 are all biased upwards: patients dying 
from COVID-19 are typically multimorbid, having far worse life expectation than 
the general population. These questions are quantitatively investigated using a 
unique Hungarian dataset that contains individual patient level data on 
comorbidities for all COVID-19 deaths in the country. To account for the 
comorbidities of the patients, a parametric survival model using 11 important 
long-term conditions was used to estimate a more realistic years of life lost. 
As of 12 May, 2021, Hungary reported a total of 27,837 deaths from COVID-19 in 
patients above 50 years of age. The usual calculation indicates 10.5 years of 
life lost for each death, which decreases to 9.2 years per death after adjusting 
for 11 comorbidities. The expected number of years lost implied by the life 
table, reflecting the mortality of a developed country just before the pandemic 
is 11.1 years. The years of life lost due to COVID-19 in Hungary is therefore 
12% or 1.3 years per death lower when accounting for the comorbidities and is 
below its expected value, but how this should be interpreted is still a matter 
of debate. Further research is warranted on how to optimally integrate this 
information into epidemiologic risk assessments during a pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: The long-term treatment burden, duration of community living, and 
survival of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) after deep brain stimulation 
(DBS) implantation are unclear. This study aims to determine the frequency of 
programming, repeat hardware surgeries (of the intracranial electrode, 
implantable pulse generator [IPG], and extension-cable), and the timings of 
residential care and death in patients with PD treated with DBS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional, population-based study, 
individual-level data were collected from the Australian government covering a 
15-year period (2002-2016) on 1849 patients with PD followed from DBS 
implantation.
RESULTS: The mean DBS implantation age was 62.6 years and mean follow-up 
5.0 years. Mean annual programming rates were 6.9 in the first year and 2.8 in 
subsequent years. 51.4% of patients required repeat hardware surgery. 11.3% of 
patients had repeat intracranial electrode surgery (including an overall 1.1% of 
patients who were completely explanted). 47.6% of patients had repeat 
IPG/extension-cable surgery including for presumed battery depletion. 6.2% of 
patients had early repeat IPG/extension-cable surgery (within one year of any 
previous such surgery). Thirty-day postoperative mortality was 0.3% after 
initial DBS implantation and 0.6% after any repeat hardware surgery. 25.3% of 
patients were admitted into residential care and 17.4% died. The median interval 
to residential care and death was 10.2 years and 11.4 years, respectively. Age 
more than 65 years was associated with fewer repeat hardware surgeries for 
presumed complications (any repeat surgery of electrodes, extension-cables, and 
early IPG surgery) and greater rates of residential care admission and death.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from a large cohort of patients with PD treated with DBS found 
that the median life span after surgery is ten years. Repeat hardware surgery, 
including of the intracranial electrodes, is common. These findings support 
development of technologies to reduce therapy burden such as enhanced surgical 
navigation, hardware miniaturization, and improved battery efficiency.

BACKGROUND: Suicide among older adults is a multifactorial problem with several 
interrelated factors involved that vary with age, gender and culture. The number 
of suicides is highest in those aged 70 years or older in almost all regions of 
the world. With the increase in life expectancy, and the decrease in mortality 
due to other causes of death, we could expect the absolute number of older 
adults' suicide continue increasing.
METHODS: Review of the literature on suicide protective factors of suicide among 
older adults.
RESULTS: Improvements on social determinants of health and the timely detection 
and early treatment of affective disorders are key interventions. Prevention 
based on community actions and training of gatekeepers may have positive impact. 
Community programs that promote a sense of usefulness, belonging and that 
contribute to preserve social integration should be encouraged. Governments 
should develop the improvement of retirement programs and the development of 
support systems. The access to general health and mental health services should 
be facilitated and Primary Care professionals should receive proper training to 
detect and manage older persons at risk. Actively promoting a culture of coping 
to different stages of life and to the changes imposed by the advancing of age 
should form the essential part of a process bringing to better successful aging 
avenues.
CONCLUSIONS: Suicide prevention in older adults should broaden its focus and pay 
attention to the many socio-environmental conditions that may be relevant in 
older age, especially social isolation, financial security and physical health.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life 
expectancy and increases the risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, 
and requirement for liver transplantation. There is uncertainty surrounding the 
relative benefits and harms of various lifestyle interventions for people with 
NAFLD.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different lifestyle 
interventions in the treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis, and to 
generate rankings of the different lifestyle interventions according to their 
safety and efficacy.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index 
Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, World Health 
Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials 
registers until February 2021 to identify randomised clinical trials in people 
with NAFLD.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of 
language, blinding, or status) in people with NAFLD, whatever the method of 
diagnosis, age, and diabetic status of participants, or presence of 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We excluded randomised clinical trials in 
which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We planned to perform a network meta-analysis with 
OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and to calculate the differences in treatments 
using hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and rate ratios (RaRs) with 95% 
credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available-participant analysis, according 
to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit 
guidance. However, the data were too sparse for the clinical outcomes. We 
therefore performed only direct comparisons (head-to-head comparisons) with 
OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods.
MAIN RESULTS: We included a total of 59 randomised clinical trials (3631 
participants) in the review. All but two trials were at high risk of bias. A 
total of 33 different interventions, ranging from advice to supervised exercise 
and special diets, or a combination of these and no additional intervention were 
compared in these trials. The reference treatment was no active intervention. 
Twenty-eight trials (1942 participants) were included in one or more 
comparisons. The follow-up ranged from 1 month to 24 months. The remaining 
trials did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. The 
follow-up period in the trials that reported clinical outcomes was 2 months to 
24 months. During this short follow-up period, clinical events related to NAFLD 
such as mortality, liver cirrhosis, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality were sparse. This is 
probably because of the very short follow-up periods. It takes a follow-up of 8 
years to 28 years to detect differences in mortality between people with NAFLD 
and the general population. It is therefore unlikely that differences by 
clinical outcomes will be noted in trials with less than 5 years to 10 years of 
follow-up. In one trial, one participant developed an adverse event. There were 
no adverse events in any of the remaining participants in this trial, or in any 
of the remaining trials, which seemed to be directly related to the 
intervention.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the 
effects of the lifestyle interventions compared with no additional intervention 
(to general public health advice) on any of the clinical outcomes after a short 
follow-up period of 2 months to 24 months in people with nonalcohol-related 
fatty liver disease. Accordingly, high-quality randomised clinical trials with 
adequate follow-up are needed. We propose registry-based randomised clinical 
trials or cohort multiple randomised clinical trials (a study design in which 
multiple interventions are trialed within large longitudinal cohorts of 
participants to gain efficiencies and align trials more closely to standard 
clinical practice), comparing aerobic exercise and dietary advice versus 
standard of care (exercise and dietary advice received as part of national 
health promotion). The reason for the choice of aerobic exercise and dietary 
advice is the impact of these interventions on indirect outcomes which may 
translate to clinical benefit. The outcomes in such trials should be mortality, 
health-related quality of life, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver 
transplantation, and resource use measures including costs of intervention and 
decreased healthcare use after a minimum follow-up of eight years, to find 
meaningful differences in the clinically important outcomes.

AIM: To analyse the cost-effectiveness of MEP with standard of care (SoC) versus 
other anti-IL-5 therapies approved for the treatment of severe eosinophilic 
asthma (SEA) patients, within the Spanish National Health System (NHS) 
perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model with a 4-week cycle length was used to compare MEP with 
BEN and RES as therapies added to SoC in the management of SEA, in terms of cost 
per QALY gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costs (€2019) 
were obtained from public sources, while utilities and transition probabilities 
were retrieved from literature, e.g. network meta-analysis. Continuation 
criteria for biological treatment and reduction of oral corticosteroids (OCS) 
was set at 50% minimum reduction of exacerbation rate. Adverse events related to 
chronic OCS use included diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts, acute myocardial 
infarct, and peptic ulcer. The analysis was performed over a 5-year time horizon 
from the National Healthcare System (NHCS) perspective, with a yearly discount 
rate of 3% applied to both costs and QALYs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
and univariate deterministic sensitivity analysis were performed to address 
uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness results.
RESULTS: On top of SoC, the model indicates that MEP is dominant (lower cost, 
higher benefit) compared to BEN and RES: For BEN and RES, respectively, 
treatment with MEP had a point estimate of 0.076 and 0.075 additional QALYs, and 
savings of €3,173.47 and €7,772.95 per patient. The findings were robust to 
variation as estimated using sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: MEP is a cost-effective treatment in comparison with BEN and RES 
added to SoC for patients with SEA in the Spanish setting.

Inside and outside the brain, accumulation of amyloid fibrils plays key roles in 
the pathogenesis of fatal age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's diseases and wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis. Although the 
incidence of all amyloidoses increases with age, for some types of amyloidosis 
aging is known as the main direct risk factor, and these types are typically 
diseases of elderly people. More than 10 different precursor proteins are known 
to cause age-associated amyloidosis; these proteins include amyloid β protein, 
α-synuclein, transthyretin, islet amyloid polypeptide, atrial natriuretic 
factor, and the newly discovered epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like 
extracellular matrix protein 1. Except for intracerebral amyloidoses, most 
age-related amyloidoses have been little studied. Indeed, in view of the 
increasing life expectancy in our societies, understanding how aging is involved 
in the process of amyloid fibril accumulation and the effects of amyloid 
deposits on the aging body is extremely important. In this review, we summarize 
current knowledge about the nature of amyloid precursor proteins, the 
prevalence, clinical manifestations, and pathogenesis of amyloidosis, and recent

Alzheimer's disease is a fatal neurological disorder affecting millions of 
people worldwide with an increasing patient population as average life 
expectancy increases. Accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques is 
characteristic of the disease and has been the target of numerous failed 
clinical trials. In light of this, therapeutics that target mechanisms of 
neuronal death beyond Aβ aggregation are needed. One potential target is the 
formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are created during an 
interaction between Aβ and copper ions. This work shows that ROS production can 
be slowed by disrupting the interaction between Aβ and copper using copper 
chelating compounds. We demonstrated that ROS are produced in the presence of Aβ 
and copper in solution by monitoring H2O2 production using a fluorescence-based 
assay, which increased when Cu2+ interacted with Aβ. In addition, we were able 
to show reduced ROS production, without exacerbating the aggregation of Aβ and 
in some cases alleviating it, by adding copper chelating ligands to the 
solution. Using cyclic voltammetry, we investigated how these different ligands 
influenced the electrochemical behavior of copper in solution revealing 
important insights into the mechanisms of ROS production and chemical 
interactions that result in decreased ROS rates.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an artificial intelligence 
electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) algorithm under various clinical and cost scenarios 
when used for universal screening at age 65.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used decision analytic modeling to perform a 
cost-effectiveness analysis of the use of AI-ECG to screen for asymptomatic left 
ventricular dysfunction (ALVD) once at age 65 compared with no screening. This 
screening consisted of an initial screening decision tree and subsequent 
construction of a Markov model. One-way sensitivity analysis on various disease 
and cost parameters to evaluate cost-effectiveness at both $50,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and $100,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay 
threshold.
RESULTS: We found that for universal screening at age 65, the novel AI-ECG 
algorithm would cost $43,351 per QALY gained, test performance, disease 
characteristics, and testing cost parameters significantly affect 
cost-effectiveness, and screening at ages 55 and 75 would cost $48,649 and 
$52,072 per QALY gained, respectively. Overall, under most of the clinical 
scenarios modeled, coupled with its robust test performance in both testing and 
validation cohorts, screening with the novel AI-ECG algorithm appears to be 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000.
CONCLUSION: Universal screening for ALVD with the novel AI-ECG appears to be 
cost-effective under most clinical scenarios with a cost of <$50,000 per QALY. 
Cost-effectiveness is particularly sensitive to both the probability of disease 
progression and the cost of screening and downstream testing. To improve 
cost-effectiveness modeling, further study of the natural progression and 
treatment of ALVD and external validation of AI-ECG should be undertaken.

BACKGROUND: When vaccines increase longevity, vaccinated people may experience 
costs and benefits during added life-years. These future benefits and costs may 
include increased productivity as well as medical and non-medical costs. Such 
impacts should be considered in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) of vaccines 
but are often omitted. Here, we illustrate the impact of including future costs 
on the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against pneumococcus disease. We 
emphasize the relevance of differentiating cost estimates between risk groups.
METHODS: We updated an existing Dutch CEA of vaccination against pneumococcus 
disease with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) to include all 
future medical and non-medical costs. We linked costs by age and risk with 
survival information and estimates of cases prevented per vaccination strategy 
based on the original study to calculate the impact of inclusion. Future medical 
costs were adjusted for relevant risk groups.
RESULTS: For the base-case strategy, the original incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of PVC13 was €9,157 per quality adjusted life-year (QALY). 
Including all future medical costs increased the ICER to €28,540 per QALY. Also 
including future non-medical costs resulted in an ICER of €45,691 per QALY. The 
impact of future medical costs varied considerably per risk group and generally 
increased with age.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study showed a substantial effect of the 
inclusion of future costs on the ICER of vaccinating with PCV13. Especially when 
lives of people with underlying health conditions are extended, the impact of 
future medical costs is large. This inclusion may make vaccination a less 
attractive option, especially in relation to low thresholds as often applied for 
prevention. Although this raises important questions, ignoring these real future 
costs may lead to an inefficient use of healthcare resources. Our results may 
imply that prices for some vaccines need to be lowered to be cost-effective.

Clinical workflows in oncology depend on predictive and prognostic biomarkers. 
However, the growing number of complex biomarkers contributes to costly and 
delayed decision-making in routine oncology care and treatment. As cancer is 
expected to rank as the leading cause of death and the single most important 
barrier to increasing life expectancy in the 21st century, there is a major 
emphasis on precision medicine, particularly individualisation of treatment 
through better prediction of patient outcome. Over the past few years, both 
surgical and pathology specialties have suffered cutbacks and a low uptake of 
pathology specialists means a solution is required to enable high-throughput 
screening and personalised treatment in this area to alleviate bottlenecks. 
Digital imaging in pathology has undergone an exponential period of growth. 
Deep-learning (DL) platforms for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) image analysis, 
with preliminary artificial intelligence (AI)-based grading capabilities of 
specimens, can evaluate image characteristics which may not be visually apparent 
to a pathologist and offer new possibilities for better modelling of disease 
appearance and possibly improve the prediction of disease stage and patient 
outcome. Although digital pathology and AI are still emerging areas, they are 
the critical components for advancing personalised medicine. Integration of 
transcriptomic analysis, clinical information and AI-based image analysis is yet 
an uncultivated field by which healthcare professionals can make improved 
treatment decisions in cancer. This short review describes the potential 
application of integrative AI in offering better detection, quantification, 
classification, prognosis and prediction of breast and prostate cancer and also 
highlights the utilisation of machine learning systems in biomarker evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Facial palsy causes devastating disability due to loss of facial 
function as well as social and psychological impairment. Cheek slings are a 
secondary technique that provide static support to the midface. This study aimed 
to describe our technique and compare a traditional sling material (tensor 
fascia lata) with a porcine-derived acellular dermal matrix alternative 
(Strattice).
METHODS: A 5-year case-control retrospective review of consecutive static cheek 
slings in a tertiary cancer and facial palsy center was performed. Demographic 
data, risk factors, and complications were collected and compared. Improvement 
in static smile position was assessed by Emotrics (Massachusetts Eye and Ear 
Infirmary, Boston, MA) at 3 months. Long-term sling failure was assessed by need 
for reoperation.
RESULTS: The study group comprised 41 patients on which 33 autogenous fascia 
lata slings and 12 Strattice slings were performed. Medium-term improvement in 
static smile position was similar between the 2 groups (judged by the Emotrics 
software), as was complication rate (P = 0.496). Need for revision due to 
stretching was higher in the Strattice group but did not achieve significance (P 
= 0.087). Mean follow-up was 38.02 ± 19.17 months. Twelve of 41 patients were 
deceased at study conclusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Fascia lata and Strattice slings provide satisfactory results in 
restoring symmetry at rest and functional oral competence. Our results suggest 
that Strattice is a safe sling material with an acceptable risk profile and 
comparable medium-term maintenance of tensile strength to fascia lata, and 
should be considered where life expectancy, donor site morbidity, and procedure 
length are important considerations.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) results in poor physical health outcomes and reduced 
life expectancy of up to 20 years less for people living with severe mental 
illness. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate a locally developed 
practical toolkit (Let's Get Physical-Improved Physical Health in Mental Health 
Services-A Practical Toolkit) to support mental health clinicians to manage 
MetS. The study explored clinician's knowledge and attitudes towards managing 
MetS, confidence to screen for and intervene in MetS, and improvement in 
documentation. A longitudinal prospective study, utilizing audit and 
pre-post-questionnaire design, was conducted. Of the 60 clinicians who were 
employed in the regional inpatient unit, 65% (n = 39) participated in at least 
one of the intervention education sessions. The final sample comprised 17 
clinicians with matched pre- and post-intervention data (28% of eligible 
participants). A total of 80 (20 per month) eMR metabolic monitoring form and 
patient file audits were conducted. Whilst the results were not statistically 
significant, this study found an overall improvement in clinicians' knowledge 
of, and confidence to screen for and intervene in, MetS. Attitude scores were 
overall positive. There was also overall improvement in MetS documentation. The 
implementation of the practical evidence-informed physical health in mental 
health services toolkit may have a positive impact on clinician knowledge, 
attitudes, and confidence in screening and intervening in MetS. Replicating this 
study with a larger sample is recommended.

Murburn concept is a new perspective to metabolism which posits that certain 
redox enzymes/proteins mediate catalysis outside their active site, via 
diffusible reactive oxygen species (DROS, usually deemed as toxic wastes). We 
have recently questioned the proton-centric chemiosmotic rotary ATP synthesis 
(CRAS) explanation for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mOxPhos) and 
proposed an oxygen-centric murburn model in lieu. Herein, the chemical equations 
and thermodynamic foundations for this new model of mOxPhos are detailed. 
Standard transformed Gibbs free energy values of respiratory reactions are 
calculated to address the spontaneity, control, and efficiency of oxidative 
phosphorylation. Unlike the deterministic/multi-molecular and 'irreducibly 
complex' CRAS model, the stochastic/bimolecular and parsimonious murburn 
reactions afford a more viable precept for the variable and non-integral 
stoichiometry, higher yield for NADH than FADH2, and origin/evolution of 
oxygen-centric cellular life. Also, we present tangible DROS-based explanations 
for the multiple roles of various reaction components, HCN > H2S order of 
cellular toxicity in aerobes, and explain why oxygen inhibits anaerobes. We 
highlight the thermodynamic significance of proton deficiency in 
NADH/mitochondria and link the 'oxygen → DROS → water' metabolic pathway to the 
macroscopic physiologies of ATP-synthesis, trans-membrane potential, 
thermogenesis, and homeostasis. We also provide arguments for the extension of 
the murburn bioenergetics model to life under anoxic and extreme/unique 
habitats. In the context of mOxPhos, our findings imply that DROS should be seen 
as an essential requisite for life, and not merely as pathophysiological 
manifestations.

PURPOSE: Little is known regarding the burden of infections and clinical 
practice towards hospitalized patients with limits on life-sustaining measures. 
We aim to describe the infectious syndromes, clinical care, the emergence of 
multi-drug resistant organisms and outcomes in this population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort of patients labeled as support or 
comfort care in a tertiary care center between 2016-2019.
RESULTS: A total of 347 patients were included with a mean age of 68.5 years, 
who were predominantly males (59.94%), bedbound (69.74%), on tube feeding 
(66.86%), and required indwelling urinary catheters (61.96%). The total number 
of admissions during the first year was 498, with the mean length of stay being 
30 days. The number of infectious syndromes identified during that period was 
821episodes, with a mean of 2 infectious syndromes per admission. The most 
common infection identified was pneumonia (41.66%) followed by urinary tract 
infections (27.16%). A total of 3891 microbiological cultures were taken with a 
mean of 5 cultures per infectious syndrome. The most commonly identified 
pathogens were Gram-negative bacteria (61.03%), with a high rate of 
multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (48.53%). The one-year mortality was 
86.4%. Using carbapenem antibiotic and pneumonia were the independent predictors 
used for the MDROs.
CONCLUSION: Our study reflects the high burden of infections, antimicrobial 
resistance, and hospital admissions among a population with limited life 
expectancy. A consensus regarding investigating and managing of infectious 
syndromes, and antimicrobial prescription is needed to reduce the harms 
associated with overuse of antimicrobials.

BACKGROUND: Adults with spinal deformity (ASD) are known to have postural 
malalignment affecting their quality of life. Classical evaluation and follow-up 
are usually based on full-body static radiographs and health related quality of 
life questionnaires. Despite being an essential daily life activity, formal gait 
assessment lacks in clinical practice.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the main alterations in gait kinematics of ASD and 
their radiological determinants?
METHODS: 52 ASD and 63 control subjects underwent full-body 3D gait analysis 
with calculation of joint kinematics and full-body biplanar X-rays with 
calculation of 3D postural parameters. Kinematics and postural parameters were 
compared between groups. Determinants of gait alterations among postural 
radiographic parameters were explored.
RESULTS: ASD had increased sagittal vertical axis (SVA:34 ± 59 vs -5 ± 20 mm), 
pelvic tilt (PT:19 ± 13 vs 11 ± 6°) and frontal Cobb (25 ± 21 vs 4 ± 6°) 
compared to controls (all p < 0.001). ASD displayed decrease walking speed 
(0.9 ± 0.3 vs 1.2 ± 0.2 m/s), step length (0.58 ± 0.11 vs 0.64 ± 0.07 m) and 
increased single support (0.45 ± 0.05 vs 0.42 ± 0.04 s). ASD walked with 
decreased hip extension in stance (-3 ± 10 vs -7 ± 8°), increased knee flexion 
at initial contact and in stance (10 ± 11 vs 5 ± 10° and 19 ± 7 vs 16 ± 8° 
respectively), and decreased knee flexion/extension ROM (55 ± 9 vs 59 ± 7°). ASD 
had increased trunk flexion (12 ± 12 vs 6 ± 11°) and reduced dynamic lumbar 
lordosis (-11 ± 12 vs -15 ± 7°, all p < 0.001). Sagittal knee ROM, walking speed 
and step length were negatively determined by SVA; lack of lumbar lordosis 
during gait was negatively determined by radiological lumbar lordosis.
SIGNIFICANCE: Static compensations in ASD persist during gait, where they 
exhibit a flexed attitude at the trunk, hips and knees, reduced hip and knee 
mobility and loss of dynamic lordosis. ASD walked at a slower pace with 
increased single and double support times that might contribute to their gait 
stability. These dynamic discrepancies were strongly related to static sagittal 
malalignment.
