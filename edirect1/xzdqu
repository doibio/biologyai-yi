Spine is a frequent site of bone metastases, with a 8.5 months median survival 
time after diagnosis. In most cases treatment is only palliative. Several 
advanced techniques can ensure a better Quality of Life (QoL) and increase life 
expectancy. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses alternating current to produce 
local heating and necrosis of the spinal lesion, preserving the healthy bone. 
RFA is supported by vertebral reinforcement through kyphoplasty and 
vertebroplasty in order to stabilize the fracture with polymethylmethacrylate 
(PMMA) injection, restoring vertebral body height and reducing the weakness of 
healthy bone. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and 
advantages of RFA plus vertebral reinforcement through PMMA vertebroplasty and 
fixation in patients affected by bone spinal metastases. We retrospectively 
analyzed 54 patients with thoraco-lumbar metastatic vertebral fractures admitted 
to our Unit between January 2014 and June 2020. Each patient underwent RFA 
followed by PMMA vertebroplasty and transpedicle fixation. We evaluated pain 
relief through the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score and PMMA vertebral filling 
based on the mean Saliou filling score. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to 
test pain relief with statistical significance for p<0.05. A total of 54 
patients (median age 63,44 years; range 34-86 years), with a total of 63 
infiltrated vertebrae, were treated with RFA, PMMA vertebroplasty and 
transpedicular screw fixation; average operative time was 60.4 min (range 
51-72). The preoperative average VAS score decreased significantly from 7.81 to 
2.50 (p < 0.05) after 12 months. Based on Saliou filling score, filling was 
satisfactory (12-18) in 20 vertebrae (31,7%), mediocre (6-11) in 33 vertebrae 
(52,4%), inadequate (0-5) in 10 vertebrae (15,9%). A consistent PMMA filling of 
vertebral bodies was successfully achieved with significant pain relief. 
Concomitant RFA, PMMA vertebroplasty and pedicle screw fixation represent a safe 
and effective technique for the management of spinal metastases, improving 
clinical outcome and pain control.

Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and can reduce 
life expectancy. Owing to the widespread use of antihypertensive drugs, patients 
with hypertension have improved blood pressure control over the past few 
decades. However, for a considerable part of the population, these drugs still 
cannot significantly improve their symptoms. In order to explore the reasons 
behind, pharmacomicrobiomics provide unique insights into the drug treatment of 
hypertension by investigating the effect of bidirectional interaction between 
gut microbiota and antihypertensive drugs. This review discusses the 
relationship between antihypertensive drugs and the gut microbiome, including 
changes in drug pharmacokinetics and gut microbiota composition. In addition, we 
highlight how our current knowledge of antihypertensive drug-microbiota 
interactions to develop gut microbiota-based personalized ways for disease 
management, including antihypertensive response biomarker, microbial-targeted 
therapies, probiotics therapy. Ultimately, a better understanding of the impact 
of pharmacomicrobiomics in the treatment of hypertension will provide important 
information for guiding rational clinical use and individualized use.

The population aging and an increased life expectancy are widely recognized 
social changes. Technologies are believed to improve the elderly's daily lives 
and maintain their health efficiently. Despite the advantage of adopting 
technologies, the elderly are slower to adopt new technologies compared to 
younger adults. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to 
identify the different antecedents prevailing in the literature on elderly 
technology adoption. The SLR classifies and analyzes 26 relevant articles on 
elderly's technology adoption. Our findings revealed that quantitative approach 
and cross-sectional studies predominate in this field, building fundamentally 
upon the technology-driven theories. We identify seven categories of antecedents 
influencing elderly's use of technology, namely, technology, psychological, 
social, personal, cost, behavior, and environment antecedents. A conceptual 
framework for elderly's technology adoption and recommendations were presented. 
Particular attention is given to the need for in depth study for the 
antecedents, development of new measurement scales and investigation on the 
effectiveness of the proposed benefits after technology adoption.

BACKGROUND: Suicide is a major public health concern with diversity in 
epidemiological aspects and applied methods. In this study, we estimate years of 
life lost (YLLs) related to completed suicidal in the Fars province, southern 
Iran.
METHODS: Our study included data of all mortality events during 2011-2018 from 
Fars Suicide Surveillance System (FSSS). The validity of qualitative and 
quantitative variables was assessed through contrasting data between different 
sources and phone call justification. Case-fatality rates, age-specific and 
gender-specific mortality rates, ASR (age standardized rate), and YLLs through 
WHO's 2015 "YLL template" were calculated.
RESULTS: During the study period, 2384 mortalities with a mean age of 
32.73±15.65 had been registered. Most of them were males (male: 70.05% vs. 
female: 29.95%; male-female ratio: 2.33), hanging was the most frequent method 
(29.94%), and an increasing pattern in successful suicidal attempts was 
observed. The total YLLs were calculated to be 58669 years (14.71 per 1000 
persons). Regardless of year or gender, suicide had the largest YLLs amongst 
those aged 15-29 years.
CONCLUSION: Regarding the increasing trend in YLLs and observing the highest 
rate of successful suicidal attempts amongst active and productive members of 
community, a comprehensive inter organizational reaction is demanded.

Rif1 is a large multifaceted protein involved in various processes of DNA 
metabolism - from telomere length regulation and replication to double-strand 
break repair. The mechanistic details of its action, however, are often poorly 
understood. Here, we report functional characterization of the Rif1 homologue 
from methylotrophic thermotolerant budding yeast Hansenula polymorpha DL-1. We 
show that, similar to other yeast species, H. polymorpha Rif1 suppresses 
telomerase-dependent telomere elongation. We uncover two novel modes of Rif1 
recruitment at H. polymorpha telomeres: via direct DNA binding and through the 
association with the Ku heterodimer. Both of these modes (at least partially) 
require the intrinsically disordered N-terminal extension - a region of the 
protein present exclusively in yeast species. We also demonstrate that Rif1 
binds Stn1 and promotes its accumulation at telomeres in H. polymorpha.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease is a neurodegenerative disease causing a 
progressive loss of autonomy. This requires long-term rehabilitation care. 
Currently, new technologies are being developed for use in daily life, and there 
is a progressive implementation of telerehabilitation.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study (the TELEP@RK study) is to evaluate the uses of 
a digital self-rehabilitation device in patients with Parkinson disease and 
their independent physiotherapists on the scale of a health territory.
METHODS: A total of 10 independent physiotherapists and 31 patients with 
Parkinson disease were followed for 1 year to evaluate the use of a 
telerehabilitation tool (digital tablet and inertial sensor) via questionnaires 
of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The 
questionnaires were submitted to participants at 0, 2, and 12 months from the 
start of follow-up. The averages of the scores of the different determinants and 
constructs of the UTAUT questionnaires were compared at the different follow-up 
times.
RESULTS: Among professionals, the averages of the various determinants were 
generally high at the beginning of the study with an average (out of 5) 
performance expectancy of 4.19, effort expectancy of 3.88, social influence of 
3.95, facilitating conditions of 4, and intention to use of 3.97. These averages 
decreased over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Acceptability, acceptance, and appropriation of the tool were very 
high among the physiotherapists as well as the patients, despite the tool's lack 
of evolution during the study. In the current health care context, these results 
allow us to envision a new organization of the care pathway for patients with 
chronic diseases, with the increased use of new technologies associated with 
telecare.

Digital Therapeutic Care Apps With Decision-Support Interventions for People 
With Low Back Pain in Germany: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.

Lewkowicz D(1), Wohlbrandt AM(1), Bottinger E(1)(2).

Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, NY, United States.

BACKGROUND: Digital therapeutic care apps provide a new effective and scalable 
approach for people with nonspecific low back pain (LBP). Digital therapeutic 
care apps are also driven by personalized decision-support interventions that 
support the user in self-managing LBP, and may induce prolonged behavior change 
to reduce the frequency and intensity of pain episodes. However, these 
therapeutic apps are associated with high attrition rates, and the initial 
prescription cost is higher than that of face-to-face physiotherapy. In Germany, 
digital therapeutic care apps are now being reimbursed by statutory health 
insurance; however, price targets and cost-driving factors for the formation of 
the reimbursement rate remain unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a 
digital therapeutic care app compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in Germany. We 
further aimed to explore under which circumstances the reimbursement rate could 
be modified to consider value-based pricing.
METHODS: We developed a state-transition Markov model based on a best-practice 
analysis of prior LBP-related decision-analytic models, and evaluated the cost 
utility of a digital therapeutic care app compared to TAU in Germany. Based on a 
3-year time horizon, we simulated the incremental cost and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) for people with nonacute LBP from the societal perspective. In the 
deterministic sensitivity and scenario analyses, we focused on diverging 
attrition rates and app cost to assess our model's robustness and conditions for 
changing the reimbursement rate. All costs are reported in Euro (€1=US $1.12).
RESULTS: Our base case results indicated that the digital therapeutic care 
strategy led to an incremental cost of €121.59, but also generated 0.0221 
additional QALYs compared to the TAU strategy, with an estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €5486 per QALY. The sensitivity analysis 
revealed that the reimbursement rate and the capability of digital therapeutic 
care to prevent reoccurring LBP episodes have a significant impact on the ICER. 
At the same time, the other parameters remained unaffected and thus supported 
the robustness of our model. In the scenario analysis, the different model time 
horizons and attrition rates strongly influenced the economic outcome. Reducing 
the cost of the app to €99 per 3 months or decreasing the app's attrition rate 
resulted in digital therapeutic care being significantly less costly with more 
generated QALYs, and is thus considered to be the dominant strategy over TAU.
CONCLUSIONS: The current reimbursement rate for a digital therapeutic care app 
in the statutory health insurance can be considered a cost-effective measure 
compared to TAU. The app's attrition rate and effect on the patient's prolonged 
behavior change essentially influence the settlement of an appropriate 
reimbursement rate. Future value-based pricing targets should focus on 
additional outcome parameters besides pain intensity and functional disability 
by including attrition rates and the app's long-term effect on quality of life.

OBJECTIVE: Economic evaluation of early surgery compared to the endoscopy-first 
approach in CP.
BACKGROUND: In patients with painful CP and a dilated main pancreatic duct, 
early surgery, as compared with an endoscopy-first approach, leads to more pain 
reduction with fewer interventions. However, it is unknown if early surgery is 
more cost-effective than the endoscopy-first approach.
METHODS: The multicenter Dutch ESCAPE trial randomized patients with CP and a 
dilated main pancreatic duct between early surgery (surgery within 6 weeks) or 
the endoscopy-first approach in 30 centers (April 2011-September 2016). 
Healthcare utilization was prospectively recorded up to 18 months after 
randomization. Unit costs of resources were determined, and cost-effectiveness 
and cost-utility analyses were performed from societal and healthcare 
perspectives. Primary outcomes were the costs per unit decrease on the Izbicki 
pain score and per gained quality-adjusted life-year.
RESULTS: In total, 88 patients were included in the analysis, with 44 patients 
randomized to each group. Total costs were lower in the early surgery group but 
did not reach statistical significance (mean difference €-4,815 (95% 
bias-corrected and accelerated confidence interval €-13,113 to €3411; P = 0.25). 
Early surgery had a probability percentage of 88.4% of being more cost-effective 
than the endoscopy-first approach at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €0 per 
day per unit decrease on the Izbicki pain score. The probability percentage per 
additional gained quality-adjusted life-year was 75.7% at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of €50,000.
CONCLUSION: In patients with painful CP and a dilated main pancreatic duct, 
early surgery was more cost-effective than the endoscopy-first approach.

IMPORTANCE: Short sleep duration has been recognized as a risk factor for 
obesity. Whether extending sleep duration may mitigate this risk remains 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a sleep extension intervention on 
objectively assessed energy intake, energy expenditure, and body weight in 
real-life settings among adults with overweight who habitually curtailed their 
sleep duration.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center, randomized clinical trial 
was conducted from November 1, 2014, to October 30, 2020. Participants were 
adults aged 21 to 40 years with a body mass index (calculated as weight in 
kilograms divided by height in meters squared) between 25.0 and 29.9 and had 
habitual sleep duration of less than 6.5 hours per night. Data were analyzed 
according to the intention-to-treat principle.
INTERVENTIONS: After a 2-week habitual sleep period at baseline, participants 
were randomized to either an individualized sleep hygiene counseling session 
that was intended to extend their bedtime to 8.5 hours (sleep extension group) 
or to continue their habitual sleep (control group). All participants were 
instructed to continue daily routine activities at home without any prescribed 
diet or physical activity.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in energy intake from 
baseline, which was objectively assessed as the sum of total energy expenditure 
and change in body energy stores. Total energy expenditure was measured by the 
doubly labeled water method. Change in body energy stores was computed using 
regression of daily home weights and body composition changes from dual-energy 
x-ray absorptiometry. Sleep duration was monitored by actigraphy. Changes from 
baseline were compared between the 2 groups using intention-to-treat analysis.
RESULTS: Data from 80 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 29.8 [5.1] years; 
41 men [51.3%]) were analyzed. Sleep duration was increased by approximately 1.2 
hours per night (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4 hours; P < .001) in the sleep extension 
group vs the control group. The sleep extension group had a significant decrease 
in energy intake compared with the control group (-270 kcal/d; 95% CI, -393 to 
-147 kcal/d; P < .001). The change in sleep duration was inversely correlated 
with the change in energy intake (r = -0.41; 95% CI, -0.59 to -0.20; P < .001). 
No significant treatment effect in total energy expenditure was found, resulting 
in weight reduction in the sleep extension group vs the control group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This trial found that sleep extension reduced energy 
intake and resulted in a negative energy balance in real-life settings among 
adults with overweight who habitually curtailed their sleep duration. Improving 
and maintaining healthy sleep duration over longer periods could be part of 
obesity prevention and weight loss programs.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of endometrial carcinoma (EC) is rising worldwide due 
to an increased life expectancy and obesity. Approximately 2% of patients with 
EC is under the age of 45. Because the incidence is also rising in young women, 
there is a clinical need for safe fertility sparing alternative treatments.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 32-year-old women was diagnosed with low-grade endometrioid 
EC. Hysteroscopic tumour resection and progestin treatment resulted in complete 
tumour regression. The patient became pregnant through in vitro fertilisation 
(IVF).
CONCLUSION: This case illustrates that fertility sparing treatment, with oral 
progestin treatment is an alternative treatment option in selected young women 
with low grade, early stage endometrial carcinoma to achieve pregnancy. This 
treatment is internationally accepted.

With cancer seriously hampering the increasing life expectancy of people, 
developing an instant diagnostic method has become an urgent objective. In this 
work, we developed a label-free laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) 
method for high-throughput recognition of tumor cells. LIBS spectra were 
straightly collected from cells dropped on a silicon substrate and built into a 
deep learning model for simultaneous classification of various cancers. To 
interpret the result of the deep learning algorithm, gradient-weighted class 
activation mapping was utilized to a one-dimensional convolution neural network 
(1D-CNN), and the saliency maps thus obtained amplified the differences between 
the spectra of cell lines. Overall results showed that the 1D-CNN algorithms 
achieved a mean sensitivity of 94.00%, a mean specificity of 98.47%, and a mean 
accuracy of 97.56%. Thus, the proposed method performed satisfactorily and is 
seen as an interpretable classification process for cancer cell lines.

Objective: To analyze mortality and its trend of chronic respiratory diseases 
(CRD) in China from 1990 to 2019. Methods: Based on the provincial results of 
China from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, the average annual 
percent change (AAPC) of standardized mortality rates of different CRDs were 
analyzed by using Joinpoint 4.8.0.1, and the age-standardized mortality rate of 
CRD was calculated by using the GBD 2019 world standard population. Based on the 
comparative risk assessment theory of GBD, the attributable deaths due to 12 CRD 
risk factors were estimated, including smoking, indoor air pollution, 
occupational gas exposure, particulates and smog exposure, environmental 
particulate pollution, low temperature, passive smoking, ozone pollution, 
occupational exposure to silica, occupational asthma, high body mass index, high 
temperature and occupational exposure to asbestos. Results: From 1990 to 2019, 
the number of deaths and standardized mortality of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) showed a downward trend (P<0.001). The number of COPD deaths 
decreased from 1 244 000 (912 000 - 1 395 000) in 1990 to 1 037 000 (889 000 - 1 
266 000) in 2019. AAPC=-0.9% (95%CI: -1.5% - -0.3%), P<0.001; The standardized 
mortality rate decreased from 217.9/100 000 (163.3/100 000 - 242.0/100 000) in 
1990 to 65.2/100 000 (55.5/100 000 - 80.1/100 000) in 2019. AAPC= -4.2% 
(95%CI:-5.2% - -3.2%), P<0.001. The number of deaths from asthma decreased from 
40 000 (30 000 - 58 000) in 1990 to 25 000 (20 000 - 31 000) in 2019. AAPC=-2.0% 
(95%CI: -2.6% - -1.4%), P<0.001; The standardized mortality rate of asthma 
decreased from 6.4/100 000 (4.7/100 000 - 9.5/100 000) in 1990 to 1.5/100 000 
(1.2/100 000 - 1.9/100 000) in 2019. AAPC=-5.1% (95%CI: -5.8% - -4.4%), P<0.001. 
The number of pneumoconiosis deaths decreased from 11 000 (8 000 - 14 000) in 
1990 to 10 000 (8 000 - 14 000) in 2019, AAPC=-0.2%(95%CI:-0.4% - 0.1%), 
P=0.200; The standardized mortality rate of pneumoconiosis decreased from 
1.4/100 000 (1.0/100 000 - 1.7/100 000) in 1990 to 0.5/100 000 (0.4/100 000 - 
0.7/100 000) in 2019. AAPC=-3.1% (95%CI: -3.4% - -2.8%), P<0.001. The number of 
deaths from pulmonary interstitial diseases and pulmonary sarcoidosis increased 
from 3 000 (3 000 - 6 000) in 1990 to 8 000 (6 000 - 10 000) in 2019, AAPC=3.5% 
(95%CI: 2.7% - 4.2%), P<0.001; The corresponding standardized mortality rate 
changed little from 1990 to 2019, and AAPC was not statistically significant.The 
age-standardized mortality rates of different CRDs were higher in men than those 
in women. In 1990 and 2019, the mortality rates of COPD, asthma, pneumoconiosis 
and interstitial pulmonary disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis increased with age. 
In 2019, the population attributable fractions (PAFs) for smoking, environmental 
particulate pollution, occupational gas exposure, particulate and smog exposure, 
low temperature exposure and passive smoking were 71.1% (68.0% - 74.3%), 24.7% 
(20.1% - 30.0%), 19.3% (13.0% - 25.4%), 15.7% (13.6% - 18.3%) and 8.8% (4.5% - 
13.1%) respectively in men, and the PAFs for environmental particulate 
pollution, smoking, low temperature exposure, occupational gas exposure, 
particulate and smog exposure, and passive smoking were 24.1% (19.6% - 29.3%), 
21.9% (18.7% - 25.2%), 16.4% (14.0% - 19.2%), 15.6% (10.2% - 21.1%) and 14.7% 
(7.9% - 21.3%) respectively in women. Conclusions: During 1990-2019, the overall 
death level of CRD decreased significantly in China, but it is still at high 
level in the world. Active prevention and control measures should be taken to 
reduce the death level caused by CRD.

Publisher: 目的： 分析1990-2019年我国慢性呼吸系统疾病（CRD）死亡情况及其变化趋势。 方法： 
利用2019年全球疾病负担（GBD）中国分省研究结果，采用GBD2019世界标准人口对CRD死亡率进行标化，应用Joinpoint 
4.8.0.1软件计算各类CRD死亡人数及标化死亡率的平均年度变化百分比（AAPC），基于GBD比较风险评估理论估计吸烟、室内空气污染、职业性气体、微粒和烟雾、环境颗粒物污染、低温、被动吸烟、臭氧污染、职业性接触二氧化硅、职业性哮喘、高体质指数（BMI）、高温和职业性接触石棉12个CRD危险因素的归因死亡数。 
结果： 
1990-2019年慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD）死亡人数和标化死亡率呈下降趋势（P<0.001），死亡人数从1990年的124.4万（91.2万~139.5万）例降至2019年的103.7万（88.9万~126.6万）例，AAPC=-0.9%（95%CI：-1.5%~-0.3%），P<0.001；标化死亡率从1990年的217.9/10万（163.3/10万~242.0/10万）降至2019年的65.2/10万（55.5/10万~80.1/10万），AAPC=-4.2%（95%CI：-5.2%~-3.2%），P<0.001。支气管哮喘死亡人数从1990年的4.0万（3.0万~5.8万）例降至2019年的2.5万（2.0万~3.1万）例，AAPC=-2.0%（95%CI：-2.6%~-1.4%），P<0.001；标化死亡率从1990年的6.4/10万（4.7/10万~9.5/10万）降至2019年的1.5/10万（1.2/10万~1.9/10万），AAPC=-5.1%（95%CI：-5.8%~-4.4%），P<0.001。尘肺死亡人数从1990年的1.1万（0.8万~1.4万）例降至2019年的1.0万（0.8万~1.4万）例，AAPC=-0.2%（95%CI：-0.4%~0.1%），P=0.200；标化死亡率从1990年的1.4/10万（1.0/10万~1.7/10万）降至2019年的0.5/10万（0.4/10万~0.7/10万），AAPC=-3.1%（95%CI：-3.4%~-2.8%），P<0.001；肺间质性疾病和肺结节病死亡人数从1990年的0.3万（0.3万~0.6万）例增至2019年的0.8万（0.6万~1.0万）例，AAPC=3.5%（95%CI：2.7%~4.2%），P<0.001；标化死亡率在1990-2019年变化不大，AAPC无统计学意义。不同种类CRD标化死亡率均为男性高于女性。1990年与2019年，COPD、支气管哮喘、尘肺、肺间质性疾病和肺结节病的死亡率均随年龄的增加呈上升趋势。2019年我国男性CRD死亡可归因于吸烟、环境颗粒物污染、职业性气体、微粒和烟雾、低温和被动吸烟的人群归因分值（PAF）分别为71.1%（68.0%~74.3%）、24.7%（20.1%~30.0%）、19.3%（13.0%~25.4%）、15.7%（13.6%~18.3%）和8.8%（4.5%~13.1%），女性可归因于环境颗粒物污染、吸烟、低温、职业性气体、微粒和烟雾和被动吸烟的PAF分别为24.1%（19.6%~29.3%）、21.9%（18.7%~25.2%）、16.4%（14.0%~19.2%）、15.6%（10.2%~21.1%）和14.7%（7.9%~21.3%）。 
结论： 1990-2019年中国CRD的总体死亡水平明显降低，但在全球仍处于较高水平，需采取积极防控措施降低CRD的死亡水平。.

Objective: To examine the associations between metabolic syndrome (MS) and the 
risks for impaired activities of daily living (ADL) in the middle-aged and 
elderly population in China and provide basis for improving healthy life 
expectancy. Methods: Prospective cohort study design was used in this study. 
Based the data of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) from 
2011 to 2018 and the baseline data in 2011, the follow up for ADL outcomes was 
conducted in 2013, 2015 and 2018 respectively, and the participants recruited in 
2013 and 2015 were new baseline populations. The participants with impaired ADL 
in three baseline populations were excluded. Cox proportional hazard model was 
used to estimate the effect of different components and number of MS components 
on the risk for ADL impairment in the middle-aged and elderly population in 
China. Results: In 59 795 person-years of follow-up, a total of 1 011 cases of 
ADL impairments were recorded. The incidence density of ADL impairment was 16.91 
per 1 000 person-year; The findings of Cox regression analysis showed that 
compared with the middle aged and elderly people without MS, the risk for ADL 
impairments was 1.29 times higher (95%CI: 1.12-1.50) for those with one 
component of MS, 1.32 times higher (95%CI:1.07-1.64) for those with hyperlipemia 
complicated with diabetes, 1.78 times higher (95%CI: 1.22-2.59) for those with 
obesity and one component of MS, 2.48 times higher (95%CI:1.59-3.85) for those 
with hypertension complicated with hyperlipemia, 3.51 times higher 
(95%CI:1.66-7.43) for those with hypertension complicated with diabetes, 1.80 
times higher (95%CI: 1.40-2.32) for those with ≥3 MS, respectively. Compared 
with the middle-aged and elderly population without MS, the risk for impaired 
ADL increased by 30% (HR=1.30, 95%CI: 1.13-1.51), 54% (HR=1.54, 95%CI: 
1.28-1.85) and 87% (HR=1.87, 95%CI:1.45-2.41), respectively, in the middle-aged 
and elderly with one, two, and more than three components of MS, with a 
significant dose-response relationship that ADL impaired risks increased as the 
number of MS components increased (P<0.001). Conclusions: Our findings suggested 
that MS is a risk factor for ADL impairment in middle-aged and elderly 
population in China. Prevention and early intervention of obesity, hypertension, 
hyperlipemia, diabetes and metabolic syndrome could help to reduce or delay the 
incidence of ADL impairment.

Publisher: 目的： 探讨我国中老年人代谢综合征（MS）与日常生活活动能力（ADL）受损的关联，为提高人口健康预期寿命提供依据。 方法： 
采用前瞻性队列研究设计，利用2011-2018年中国健康与养老追踪调查数据，以2011年数据为基线，分别在2013、2015和2018年随访ADL结局，且以2013年和2015年新进入队列的人群作为基线。剔除三次基线人群中已发生ADL的中老年人。采用Cox比例风险回归模型分析MS组分异常及异常数目对中老年人群ADL受损的影响。 
结果： 观察总人年数为59 795人年，发生ADL受损人数为1 011人，发病密度为16.91/1 
000人年。Cox模型分析结果显示，调整混杂因素后，分析MS组分异常种类发现，1种MS组分异常、血脂异常合并高血糖、超重/肥胖合并1种MS组分异常、高血压合并血脂异常、高血压合并高血糖及MS分别是没有MS组分异常中老年人发生ADL风险的1.29（95%CI：1.12~1.50）倍、1.32（95%CI：1.07~1.64）倍、1.78（95%CI：1.22~2.59）倍、2.48（95%CI：1.59~3.85）倍、3.51（95%CI：1.66~7.43）倍及1.80（95%CI：1.40~2.32）倍；与没有MS组分异常的中老年人比较，1、2和≥3种MS组分异常使中老年人ADL受损风险分别增加30%（HR=1.30，95%CI：1.13~1.51）、54%（HR=1.54，95%CI：1.28~1.85）和87%（HR=1.87，95%CI：1.45~2.41），随着MS组分异常数目的增加，中老年人发生ADL风险升高，并存在剂量-反应关系（P<0.001）。 
结论： MS组分异常是中老年人发生ADL受损的重要危险因素，早期预防和干预超重/肥胖、高血压、血脂异常、高血糖及MS可以降低或延缓ADL受损的发生。.

Lipomas are benign tumours of mesenchymal origin, representing one of the most 
common tumours of the body. They are often observed between the fourth and the 
sixth decade of life and in 13% of the cases they occur in the head and neck 
region. In case of symptoms, surgical removal is the treatment of choice; when 
the formation involves the temporal region, the surgical approach is often 
challenging due to the presence of the neurovascular structures, such as the 
temporalis branch of the facial nerve and their potential extension to the 
nearby structures under the zygomatic arch to either the infratemporal fossa or 
the buccal region. Recurrence can occur frequently only if there is incomplete 
removal of lipoma. In this paper, the authors discuss surgical pitfalls of a 
very rare case of a large-sized symptomatic lipoma extended to the infratemporal 
and pterygomaxillary fossa, surgically removed via trans-zygomatic hemicoronal 
approach.

INTRODUCTION: Motor imagery (MI) refers to the mental rehearsal of a physical 
action without muscular activity. Our previous studies showed that MI combined 
with rhythmic-auditory cues improved walking, fatigue and quality of life (QoL) 
in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Largest improvements were seen after 
music and verbally cued MI. It is unclear whether actual cued gait training 
achieves similar effects on walking as cued MI in pwMS. Furthermore, in pwMS it 
is unknown whether any of these interventions leads to changes in brain 
activation. The purpose of this study is therefore to compare the effects of 
imagined and actual cued gait training and a combination thereof on walking, 
brain activation patterns, fatigue, cognitive and emotional functioning in pwMS.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A prospective double-blind randomised parallel multicentre 
trial will be conducted in 132 pwMS with mild to moderate disability. Randomised 
into three groups, participants will receive music, metronome and verbal cueing, 
plus MI of walking (1), MI combined with actual gait training (2) or actual gait 
training (3) for 30 min, 4× per week for 4 weeks. Supported by weekly phone 
calls, participants will practise at home, guided by recorded instructions. 
Primary endpoints will be walking speed (Timed 25-Foot Walk) and distance (2 min 
Walk Test). Secondary endpoints will be brain activation patterns, fatigue, QoL, 
MI ability, anxiety, depression, cognitive functioning, music-induced 
motivation-to-move, pleasure, arousal and self-efficacy. Data will be collected 
at baseline, postintervention and 3-month follow-up. MRI reference values will 
be generated using 15 matched healthy controls.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study follows the Standard Protocol Items: 
Recommendations for Interventional Trials-PRO Extension. Ethical approval was 
received from the Ethics Committees of the Medical Universities of Innsbruck 
(1347/2020) and Graz (33-056 ex 20/21), Austria. Results will be disseminated 
via national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed 
journals.

Following a transtibial amputation (TTA), physical activity has known benefits 
for health and quality of life. Adults post-TTA, however, demonstrate reduced 
physical activity, predisposing them to adverse health outcomes. Identifying 
adults at the risk of sedentarism post-TTA via commonly used, objective clinical 
measures may enhance clinical decisions, including prosthesis prescription. The 
study's purpose was to determine whether residual and sound limb hip strength 
distinguishes between sedentary and nonsedentary adults post-TTA. A secondary 
analysis of a cross-sectional dataset (n = 44) was conducted. Participant 
residual and sound limb hip flexion, extension, abduction and adduction strength 
were assessed via handheld dynamometry. Physical activity was monitored for 7 
days and participants were classified as sedentary (<5000 steps/day; n = 13) or 
nonsedentary (≥5000 steps/day; n = 31). Receiver operating curves revealed that 
residual and sound limb hip extension, abduction and adduction strength 
distinguished between sedentary and nonsedentary adults post-TTA (P < 0.050). 
Preliminary cut-points for hip strength measures to classify adults at the risk 
of sedentarism were determined. A hip strength composite score (0-6) estimates a 
2.2× increased odds of being sedentary with each additional hip strength 
deficit. Post-TTA, residual and sound limb hip strength can help identify adults 
at risk of sedentarism to aid clinical decision making, including prosthesis 
prescription.

Future space missions by national space agencies and private industry, including 
space tourism, will include a diverse makeup of crewmembers with extensive 
variability in age, sex, and race or ethnic groups. The relative risk (RR) model 
is used to transfer epidemiology data between populations to estimate radiation 
risks. In the RR model cancer risk is assumed to be proportional to background 
cancer rates and limited by other causes of death, which are dependent on 
genetic, environmental and dietary factors that are population dependent. Here 
we apply the NSCR-2020 model to make the first predictions of age dependent 
space radiation cancer risks for several U.S. populations, which includes 
Asian-Pacific Islanders (API), Black, Hispanic (white and black), and White 
(non-Hispanic) populations. Results suggest that male API and Hispanic 
populations have the overall lowest cancer risks, while White females have the 
highest risk. Blacks have similar total cancer rates than Whites, however their 
reduced life expectancy leads to modestly lower lifetime radiation risks 
compared to Whites. There are diverse tissue specific cancer risk ranking across 
sex and race, which include sex specific organ risks, female's having larger 
lung, stomach, and urinary-bladder radiation risks, and male's having larger 
colon and brain risks.

BACKGROUND: Antioxidants attracted long-standing attention as promising 
preventive agents worldwide. Previous observational studies have reported that 
circulating antioxidants are associated with reduced mortality; however, 
randomized clinical trials indicate neutral or harmful impacts. The association 
of long-term circulating antioxidant exposure with longevity is still unclear.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to determine whether long-term circulating antioxidant 
exposure is causally associated with longevity in the general population using 
the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design.
METHODS: Genetic instruments for circulating antioxidants (ascorbate, lycopene, 
selenium, beta-carotene, and retinol) and antioxidant metabolites (ascorbate, 
alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, and retinol) were identified from the 
largest up-to-date genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Summary statistics 
of these instruments with individual survival to the 90th vs. 60th percentile 
age (11,262 cases and 25,483 controls) and parental lifespan (N = 1,012,240 
individuals) were extracted. The causal effect was estimated using the 
inverse-variance weighted method in the main analysis and complemented by 
multiple sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of results.
RESULTS: We found that genetically determined higher concentration of 
circulating retinol (vitamin A) metabolite was casually associated with a higher 
odds of longevity (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13; P < 0.01) and increased parental 
lifespan (lifespan years per 10-fold increase: 0.17; 95% CI, 0.07-0.27; P < 
0.01). Present evidence did not support a causal impact of circulating ascorbate 
(vitamin C), tocopherol (vitamin E), lycopene, selenium or beta-carotene on life 
expectancy. No evidence was identified to show the pleiotropic effects had 
biased the results.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term higher exposure to retinol metabolite is causally 
associated with longevity in the general population. Future MR analyses could 
assess the current findings further by utilizing additional genetic variants and 
greater samples from large-scale GWASs.

IMPORTANCE: More deaths in the US are attributed to cigarette smoking each year 
than to any other preventable cause. Approximately 34 million people and an 
estimated 14% of adults in the US smoke cigarettes. If they stopped smoking, 
they could reduce their risk of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and 
potentially gain up to 10 years of life.
OBSERVATIONS: Tobacco smoking is a chronic disorder maintained by physical 
nicotine dependence and learned behaviors. Approximately 70% of people who smoke 
cigarettes want to quit smoking. However, individuals who attempt to quit 
smoking make an average of approximately 6 quit attempts before achieving 
long-term abstinence. Both behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy while using 
nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products, varenicline, or bupropion are 
effective treatments when used individually, but they are most effective when 
combined. In a meta-analysis including 19 488 people who smoked cigarettes, the 
combination of medication and behavioral counseling was associated with a quit 
rate of 15.2% over 6 months compared with a quit rate of 8.6% with brief advice 
or usual care. The EAGLES trial, a randomized double-blind clinical trial of 
8144 people who smoked, directly compared the efficacy and safety of 
varenicline, bupropion, nicotine patch, and placebo and found a significantly 
higher 6-month quit rate for varenicline (21.8%) than for bupropion (16.2%) and 
the nicotine patch (15.7%). Each therapy was more effective than placebo (9.4%). 
Combining a nicotine patch with other NRT products is more effective than use of 
a single NRT product. Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action, such 
as varenicline and NRT, has increased quit rates in some studies compared with 
use of a single product. Brief or intensive behavioral support can be delivered 
effectively in person or by telephone, text messages, or the internet. The 
combination of a clinician's brief advice to quit and assistance to obtain 
tobacco cessation treatment is effective when routinely administered to tobacco 
users in virtually all health care settings.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Approximately 34 million people in the US smoke 
cigarettes and could potentially gain up to a decade of life expectancy by 
stopping smoking. First-line therapy should include both pharmacotherapy and 
behavioral support, with varenicline or combination NRT as preferred initial 
interventions.
