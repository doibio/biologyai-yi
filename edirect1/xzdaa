IMPORTANCE: Lifestyle interventions for obesity produce reductions in body 
weight that can decrease risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease but are 
limited by suboptimal maintenance of lost weight and inadequate dissemination in 
low-resource communities.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of extended care programs for obesity 
management delivered remotely in rural communities through the US Cooperative 
Extension System.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted 
from October 21, 2013, to December 21, 2018, in Cooperative Extension Service 
offices of 14 counties in Florida. A total of 851 individuals were screened for 
participation; 220 individuals did not meet eligibility criteria, and 103 
individuals declined to participate. Of 528 individuals who initiated a 4-month 
lifestyle intervention, 445 qualified for randomization. Data were analyzed from 
August 22 to October 21, 2019.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to extended care delivered 
via individual or group telephone counseling or an education control program 
delivered via email. All participants received 18 modules with posttreatment 
recommendations for maintaining lost weight. In the telephone-based 
interventions, health coaches provided participants with 18 individual or group 
sessions focused on problem solving for obstacles to the maintenance of weight 
loss.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in body weight from 
the conclusion of initial intervention (month 4) to final follow-up (month 22). 
An additional outcome was the proportion of participants achieving at least 10% 
body weight reduction at follow-up.
RESULTS: Among 445 participants (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [10.2] years; 368 [82.7%] 
women; 329 [73.9%] white), 149 participants (33.5%) were randomized to 
individual telephone counseling, 143 participants (32.1%) were randomized to 
group telephone counseling, and 153 participants (34.4%) were randomized to the 
email education control. Mean (SD) baseline weight was 99.9 (14.6) kg, and mean 
(SD) weight loss after the initial intervention was 8.3 (4.9) kg. Mean weight 
regains at follow-up were 2.3 (95% credible interval [CrI], 1.2-3.4) kg in the 
individual telephone counseling group, 2.8 (95% CrI, 1.4-4.2) kg for the group 
telephone counseling group, and 4.1 (95% CrI, 3.1-5.0) kg for the education 
control group, with a significantly smaller weight regain observed in the 
individual telephone counseling group vs control group (posterior probability 
>.99). A larger proportion of participants in the individual telephone 
counseling group achieved at least 10% weight reductions (31.5% [95% CrI, 
24.1%-40.0%]) than in the control group (19.1% [95% CrI, 14.1%-24.9%]) 
(posterior probability >.99).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that providing 
extended care for obesity management in rural communities via individual 
telephone counseling decreased weight regain and increased the proportion of 
participants who sustained clinically meaningful weight losses.

IMPORTANCE: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved life expectancy for 
individuals with HIV infection, but recent data comparing life span and 
comorbidity-free years by HIV status are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify the gap in life span and comorbidity-free years by HIV 
status among adults with access to care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This matched cohort study used data from 
insured adults with and without HIV infection (aged ≥21 years) matched 1:10 at 
medical centers of Kaiser Permanente in northern and southern California and the 
mid-Atlantic states of Washington DC, Maryland, and Virginia from January 1, 
2000, through December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2019, 
through March 31, 2020.
EXPOSURES: HIV status and, for individuals with HIV infection, ART initiation at 
a CD4 cell count of 500/μL or greater.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall life expectancy and expected years free of 
major chronic comorbidities, including chronic liver disease, chronic kidney 
disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.
RESULTS: Of 39 000 individuals with HIV infection and 387 785 matched uninfected 
adults, 374 421 (87.7%) were male, with a mean (SD) age of 41.4 (10.8) years. 
Among 359 244 individuals with known race/ethnicity, 90 177 (25.1%) were 
non-Hispanic black and 87 191 (24.3%) were Hispanic. From 2000 to 2003, overall 
life expectancy at age 21 years of age was 37.6 years among individuals with HIV 
infection and 59.7 years among uninfected adults, (difference, 22.1 years; 95% 
CI, 20.2-24.0 years). From 2014 to 2016, overall life expectancy at 21 years of 
age among individuals with HIV infection increased to 56.0 years compared with 
65.1 years among uninfected adults (difference, 9.1 years; 95% CI, 7.9-10.2 
years). During 2011 to 2016, individuals with HIV infection who initiated ART 
with a CD4 cell count of 500/μL or greater had a life expectancy at 21 years of 
age of 57.4 years compared with 64.2 years among uninfected adults (difference, 
6.8 years; 95% CI, 5.0-8.5 years). From 2000 to 2003, the expected number of 
comorbidity-free years remaining at 21 years of age was 11.3 for individuals 
with HIV infection and 26.6 years for uninfected adults (difference, 15.3 years; 
95% CI, 13.9-16.6 years). This difference in comorbidity-free years persisted 
over time but decreased to 9.5 years (95% CI, 7.7-11.2 years) for individuals 
with HIV infection who initiated ART at a CD4 cell count of 500/μL or greater.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results suggest that life expectancy of adults 
with HIV infection may be near that of life expectancy of individuals without 
HIV infection, but greater attention is needed to prevention of comorbidities 
among individuals with HIV infection.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to estimate individuals' expected 
longevity based on self-assessed survival probabilities and determine the 
predictors of such subjective life expectancy in a sample of elderly people 
(50 years and older) in Côte d'Ivoire.
METHODS: Paper-based questionnaires were administered to a sample (n = 267) of 
older adults residing in the city of Dabou, Côte d'Ivoire in May 2017. 
Information on subjective expectations regarding health, comorbidities, and 
self-assessed survival probabilities was collected. We estimated self-assessed 
life expectancy and its determinants using a two-pronged approach by: (i) 
estimating individuals' life expectancy using the self-assessed survival 
probabilities (SSPs), and (ii) applying a finite mixture of regression models to 
form homogenous groups of individuals (clusters/components) and investigate the 
determinants. A spline-based approach was used to estimate the overall 
distribution of life expectancy for each individual using two to four points of 
self-assessed survival probabilities. A finite mixture of regression models was 
used to identify homogeneous groups of individuals (i.e. clusters/components) of 
the overall subjective life expectancy distribution of the study participants.
RESULTS: The mean subjective life expectancy in older people varied according to 
four components/clusters. The average subjective life expectancy among the 
elderly was 79.51, 78.89, 80.02, and 77.79 years in the first, second, third, 
and fourth component of the subjects' overall subjective life expectancy, 
respectively. The effect of sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and 
lifestyle on subjective life expectancy varied across components. For instance, 
a U-shape relationship between household per capita income and subjective life 
expectancy was found for individuals classified into the third component, and an 
inverse U-shape relationship was found for individuals classified into the 
fourth component.
CONCLUSIONS: We extended the estimation of subjective life expectancy by 
accounting for heterogeneity in the distribution of the estimated subjective 
life expectancy. This approach improved the usual methods for estimating 
individual subjective life expectancies and may provide insight into the 
elderly's perception of aging, which could be used to forecast the demand for 
health services and long-term care needs.

What has contributed to the large sex differentials in lifespan variation and 
life expectancy in South Korea?

To date, research on sex differentials in lifespan variation and life expectancy 
has mainly been conducted in Western countries and there is a dearth of data 
from South Korea. This study aimed to further the understanding of mortality 
transition and life expectancy in South Korea, and the associated trajectories 
of age-at-death variation, through an analysis of life disparity by gender. 
Using complete life tables for South Korea for 1970-2015, sex differentials 
(female-male differences) in life disparity and life expectancy at birth were 
estimated, and sex differentials in life expectancy were decomposed by age and 
cause of death. The results showed that sex differentials in life expectancy at 
birth have not reduced significantly in the last 45 years (1970: 7.1 years; 
2015: 6.2 years). Life disparity has reduced more rapidly for females than 
males, and the difference increased from -0.1 year in 1981 to -1.6 years in 
2015. Sex differentials in life expectancy and life disparity in South Korea 
were higher during 1970-2015 than in several Western countries with high life 
expectancy. The elderly age group (60 and above) contributed 50% of the total 
sex difference in life expectancy at birth in 1970, and this increased to 70% in 
2015. The contribution of the age group 15-59 years reduced significantly over 
the period. Decomposition of life expectancy at birth by cause revealed that 
diseases of the circulatory system (2.2 years), followed by external causes (1.3 
years), were the most important causes of the sex differences in life expectancy 
at birth in 1983, and in 2015 neoplasms (2.2 years) and external causes (1.1 
years) explained half of the total sex differences. There has been a significant 
shift in the age-specific pattern of the contribution towards each cause of 
death. Overall, sex differentials in life disparity and life expectancy at birth 
have remained significant in South Korea in the last 45 years.

OBJECTIVES: Decision-analytic models for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been 
advanced to a discrete-event simulation (DES), in which individual-level 
modeling of disease progression across continuous severity spectra become 
feasible. This study aimed to apply DES to perform cost-effectiveness analysis 
of AD treatment in Thailand.
METHODS: A data set of Thai AD patients, representing unique demographic and 
clinical characteristics, was bootstrapped to generate a baseline cohort of 50 
000 patients. Each patient was cloned and assigned to donepezil, galantamine, 
rivastigmine, memantine, or no treatment. Correlated changes in cognitive and 
behavioral status over time were developed using patient-level data. Treatment 
effects were obtained from the most recent network meta-analysis. Treatment 
persistence; mortality; and predictive equations for functional status, costs 
(Thai baht in 2017), and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) were derived from 
country-specific real-world data.
RESULTS: From a societal perspective, only the prescription of donepezil to AD 
patients with all disease-severity levels was found to be cost-effective 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio): 138 524 Thai baht/QALY ($4062/QALY)]. 
Regardless of whether the treatment-stopping rule when the mini-mental state 
examination score <10 was introduced, providing early treatment with donepezil 
to mild AD patients further reduced the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. 
Extensive sensitivity analyses indicated robust simulation findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Discrete-event simulation greatly enhances the real-world 
representativeness of decision-analytic models for AD. Donepezil is the most 
cost-effective treatment option for AD in Thailand and is worth being considered 
for universal financial coverage. Application of DES in heath technology 
assessment should be encouraged, especially when the validity of the model is 
questionable with classical modeling methods.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate threshold prices for computer- and robot-assisted knee 
and hip replacement.
METHODS: A lifetime cohort Markov model provided the framework for analysis. 
Linked primary care and inpatient hospital records informed estimates of 
outcomes under current practice. Outcomes were estimated under a range of 
hypothetical relative improvements in quality of life if unrevised and in 
revision risk after computer or robot-assisted surgery. Threshold prices, a 
price at which the net health benefit from funding the intervention would be 
zero, for these improvements were estimated for a cost-effectiveness threshold 
of £20 000 per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: For average patient profiles under current knee and hip replacement 
practice, lifetime QALYs were 10.3 (9.9 to 10.7) and 11.0 (10.6 to 11.4), with 
costs of £6060 (£5947 to £6203) and £6506 (£6335 to £6710) for knee and hip 
replacement, respectively. A combined 50% relative reduction in risk of revision 
and 5% improvement in postoperative quality of life if unrevised would, for 
example, result in QALYs increasing to 10.9 (10.4 to 11.3) and 11.6 (11.2 to 
12.0), and costs falling to £5880 (£5816 to £5956) and £6258 (£6149 to £6376) 
after knee and hip replacement, respectively. These particular improvements 
would have an associated threshold price of £11 182 (£10 691 to £11 721) for 
knee replacement and £12 134 (£11 616 to £12 701) for hip replacement. The 50% 
reduction in revision rate alone would have associated threshold prices of £1094 
(£788 to £1488) and £1347 (£961 to £1842), and the 5% improvement in quality of 
life alone would have associated threshold prices of £9911 (£9476 to £10 296) 
and £10 578 (£10 171 to £10 982).
CONCLUSIONS: At current prices, computer- and robot-assisted knee and hip 
replacement will likely need to lead to improvements in patient-reported 
outcomes in addition to any reduction in the risk revision.

OBJECTIVES: Markov models characterize disease progression as specific health 
states based on clinical or biological measures. However, these measures are not 
always collected outside clinical trials. In this article, an alternative 
approach is presented that uses real-world data to define the health states and 
to model transitions between them, specific to a local setting, to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of telemonitoring (TM) versus no TM for heart failure.
METHODS: The incidence of hospitalization for usual care was estimated from 
hospital episode statistics (HES) data in the United Kingdom and converted into 
a monthly transition matrix with 5 health states (4 states are defined based on 
the number of hospitalizations in the previous year and death) to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of TM in a local UK primary care trust (PCT) using 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis from a healthcare perspective.
RESULTS: Geographical variation in hospitalization rates were present, which led 
to different health state transition matrices in different localities. In the 
PCT that was evaluated, TM accrued mean additional costs of £3610 and 0.075 
additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with usual care per 
patient, resulting in a mean incremental cost effectiveness ratio of £48 
172/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of administrative data to define health states and 
transition matrices based on health service events is feasible, and TM was not 
cost-effective in our analysis. Given the increasing emphasis on using 
real-world evidence, it is likely that these approaches will be used more in the 
future.

BACKGROUND: Limitation of active cervical range of motion as a sequel of both 
spinal instrumentation and neurological injury may occur after Cervical Spinal 
Cord Injury (CSCI) surgery. The majority of tasks performed in daily life 
require a minimum of Active Cervical Range of Motion (ACROM). The aim of this 
study was to report ACROM in patients with subaxial CSCI, and in a control group 
with asymptomatic cervical spine.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in 46 cases of traumatic complete 
motor CSCI and 41 asymptomatic cases. Patients underwent quantitative 
measurement of ACROM on six movements, using an analogue inclinometer, and 
rehabilitation status assessment on the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) 
III.
RESULTS: Forty-six CSCI cases and 41 asymptomatic controls were included. Mean 
flexion, extension, rotation, and lateral inclination were significantly lower 
in the CSCI group than in controls (P<0.0001). SCIMIII self-care subscores in 
the CSCI group showed significant correlation with mean cervical rotation 
(correlation coefficient, +0.508, P=0.0003). Regression analysis on mean ACROM 
in the CSCI group, yielded significant a negative correlation with age 
(P=0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: CSCI significantly affected ACROM. Also, restriction of cervical 
rotation had significant negative correlation with SCIM-III self-care subscores.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment (ROI) of 
the Dynamic Work (DW) Intervention, a worksite intervention aimed at reducing 
sitting time among office workers.
METHODS: In total, 244 workers were randomized to the intervention or control 
group. Overall sitting time, standing time, step counts, quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), and costs were measured over 12 months. The cost-effectiveness 
analysis was performed from the societal perspective and the ROI analysis from 
the employers' perspective.
RESULTS: No significant differences in effects and societal costs were observed 
between groups. Presenteeism costs were significantly lower in the intervention 
group. The probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 0.90 at a 
willingness-to-pay of 20,000&OV0556;/QALY. The probability of financial savings 
was 0.86.
CONCLUSION: The intervention may be considered cost-effective from the societal 
perspective depending on the willingness-to-pay. From the employer perspective, 
the intervention seems cost-beneficial.

BACKGROUND: Indications for the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) 
are broad and include prophylaxis for surgical site infections (SSIs). Existing 
evidence for the effectiveness of NPWT on postoperative wounds healing by 
primary closure remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of NPWT for preventing SSI in wounds healing 
through primary closure, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of NPWT in wounds 
healing through primary closure.
SEARCH METHODS: In June 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised 
Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid 
MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and 
EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries and references of 
included studies, systematic reviews and health technology reports. There were 
no restrictions on language, publication date or study setting.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included trials if they allocated participants to 
treatment randomly and compared NPWT with any other type of wound dressing, or 
compared one type of NPWT with another type of NPWT.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed 
trials using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, 
assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and quality assessment 
according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations 
methodology.
MAIN RESULTS: In this third update, we added 15 new randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) and three new economic studies, resulting in a total of 44 RCTs (7447 
included participants) and five economic studies. Studies evaluated NPWT in the 
context of a wide range of surgeries including orthopaedic, obstetric, vascular 
and general procedures. Economic studies assessed NPWT in orthopaedic, obstetric 
and general surgical settings. All studies compared NPWT with standard 
dressings. Most studies had unclear or high risk of bias for at least one key 
domain. Primary outcomes Four studies (2107 participants) reported mortality. 
There is low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision) showing no 
clear difference in the risk of death after surgery for people treated with NPWT 
(2.3%) compared with standard dressings (2.7%) (risk ratio (RR) 0.86; 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.47; I2 = 0%). Thirty-nine studies reported 
SSI; 31 of these (6204 participants), were included in meta-analysis. There is 
moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias) that NPWT 
probably results in fewer SSI (8.8% of participants) than treatment with 
standard dressings (13.0% of participants) after surgery; RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.55 
to 0.80 ; I2 = 23%). Eighteen studies reported dehiscence; 14 of these (3809 
participants) were included in meta-analysis. There is low-certainty evidence 
(downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision) showing no clear 
difference in the risk of dehiscence after surgery for NPWT (5.3% of 
participants) compared with standard dressings (6.2% of participants) (RR 0.88, 
95% CI 0.69 to 1.13; I2 = 0%). Secondary outcomes There is low-certainty 
evidence showing no clear difference between NPWT and standard treatment for the 
outcomes of reoperation and incidence of seroma. For reoperation, the RR was 
1.04 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; I2 = 13%; 12 trials; 3523 participants); for seroma, 
the RR was 0.72 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.05; I2 = 0%; seven trials; 729 participants). 
The effect of NPWT on occurrence of haematoma or skin blisters is uncertain 
(very low-certainty evidence); for haematoma, the RR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.28 to 
1.59; I2 = 0%; nine trials; 1202 participants) and for blisters the RR was 2.64 
(95% CI 0.65 to 10.68; I2 = 69%; seven trials; 796 participants). The overall 
effect of NPWT on pain is uncertain (very low-certainty evidence from seven 
trials (2218 participants) which reported disparate measures of pain); but 
moderate-certainty evidence suggests there is probably little difference between 
the groups in pain after three or six months following surgery for lower limb 
fracture (one trial, 1549 participants). There is also moderate-certainty 
evidence for women undergoing caesarean sections (one trial, 876 participants) 
and people having surgery for lower limb fractures (one trial, 1549 
participants) that there is probably little difference in quality of life scores 
at 30 days or 3 or 6 months, respectively. Cost-effectiveness Five economic 
studies, based wholly or partially on trials included in our review, assessed 
the cost-effectiveness of NPWT compared with standard care. They considered NPWT 
in four indications: caesarean sections in obese women; surgery for lower limb 
fracture; knee/hip arthroplasty and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. They 
calculated quality-adjusted life-years for treatment groups and produced 
estimates of the treatments' relative cost-effectiveness. The reporting quality 
was good but the grade of the evidence varied from moderate to very low. There 
is moderate-certainty evidence that NPWT in surgery for lower limb fracture was 
not cost-effective at any threshold of willingness-to-pay and that NPWT is 
probably cost-effective in obese women undergoing caesarean section. Other 
studies found low or very low-certainty evidence indicating that NPWT may be 
cost-effective for the indications assessed.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: People experiencing primary wound closure of their 
surgical wound and treated prophylactically with NPWT following surgery probably 
experience fewer SSI than people treated with standard dressings 
(moderate-certainty evidence). There is no clear difference in number of deaths 
or wound dehiscence between people treated with NPWT and standard dressings 
(low-certainty evidence). There are also no clear differences in secondary 
outcomes where all evidence was low or very low-certainty. In caesarean section 
in obese women and surgery for lower limb fracture, there is probably little 
difference in quality of life scores (moderate-certainty evidence). Most 
evidence on pain is very low-certainty, but there is probably no difference in 
pain between NPWT and standard dressings after surgery for lower limb fracture 
(moderate-certainty evidence). Assessments of cost-effectiveness of NPWT 
produced differing results in different indications. There is a large number of 
ongoing studies, the results of which may change the findings of this review. 
Decisions about use of NPWT should take into account surgical indication and 
setting and consider evidence for all outcomes.

BACKGROUND: N8-GP (turoctocog alfa pegol; Esperoct® , Novo Nordisk A/S, 
Bagsvaerd, Denmark) is a glycoPEGylated human recombinant factor VIII with a 
half-life of ~1.6-fold of standard FVIII products. pathfinder2 (NCT01480180) was 
a multi-national, open-label trial of N8-GP in previously treated adolescent and 
adult patients with severe hemophilia A.
OBJECTIVE: We report end-of-trial efficacy and safety of N8-GP from pathfinder2.
METHODS: pathfinder2 main phase and extension phase part 1 results have been 
previously reported. During extension phase part 2, patients could switch from 
N8-GP prophylaxis 50 IU/kg every fourth day (Q4D) or 75 IU/kg once weekly (Q7D), 
depending on bleeding status. Extension phase part 2 collected long-term safety 
and efficacy data for all regimens until trial end (first patient in main phase, 
30 January 2012; trial end, 10 December 2018).
RESULTS: Overall, 186 patients were exposed to N8-GP for up to 6.6 years (median 
5.4 years). The estimated annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was 2.14 (median 0.84) 
for the Q4D prophylaxis arm and 1.31 (median 1.67) for the Q7D prophylaxis arm. 
Nearly 30% of patients experienced zero bleeds throughout the entire duration of 
the trial, the hemostatic response was 83.2% across all treatment arms, and 
patient-reported outcomes were maintained or slightly improved. No safety 
concerns were detected.
CONCLUSION: Data from the completed pathfinder2 trial, one of the largest and 
longest-running clinical trials to investigate treatment of severe hemophilia A, 
demonstrate the efficacy and safety of N8-GP in previously treated adolescent 
and adult patients.

Improved medical care of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) has led to an 
increase in life expectancy to over the age of 60 years. In conjunction, there 
has been an increase in age-related co-occurring conditions including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding the factors that underlie symptom and 
age of clinical presentation of dementia in people with DS may provide insights 
into the mechanisms of sporadic and DS-associated AD (DS-AD). In March 2019, the 
Alzheimer's Association, Global Down Syndrome Foundation and the LuMind IDSC 
Foundation partnered to convene a workshop to explore the state of the research 
on the intersection of AD and DS research; to identify research gaps and unmet 
needs; and to consider how best to advance the field. This article provides a 
summary of discussions, including noting areas of emerging science and 
discovery, considerations for future studies, and identifying open gaps in our 
understanding for future focus.

INTRODUCTION: Cystic Fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations are critical events in the 
lives of people with CF that have deleterious effects on lung function, quality 
of life, and life expectancy. There are significant unmet needs in the 
management of exacerbations. We review here the associated inflammatory changes 
that underlie these events and are of interest for the development of biomarkers 
of exacerbation.
AREAS COVERED: Inflammatory responses in CF are abnormal and contribute to a 
sustained proinflammatory lung microenvironment, abundant in proinflammatory 
mediators and deficient in counter-regulatory mediators that terminate and 
resolve inflammation. There is increasing interest in these inflammatory 
pathways to discover novel biomarkers for pulmonary exacerbation management. In 
this review, we explore the inflammatory changes occurring during intravenous 
antibiotic therapy for exacerbation and how they may be applied as biomarkers to 
guide exacerbation therapy. A literature search was conducted using the PubMed 
database in February 2020.
EXPERT OPINION: Heterogeneity in inflammatory responses to treatment of a 
pulmonary exacerbation, a disease process with complex pathophysiology, limits 
the clinical utility of individual biomarkers. Biomarker panels may be a more 
successful strategy to capture informative changes within the CF population to 
improve pulmonary exacerbation management and outcomes.

Background: In 2013, eribulin was reimbursed under a coverage with evidence 
development (CED) as third or later chemotherapy line for advanced breast cancer 
(ABC) patients in the Netherlands because of uncertain cost effectiveness. In 
2016, the final decision of reimbursing eribulin was taken without considering 
the evidence collected during CED research. We analysed the cost effectiveness 
of eribulin versus non-eribulin chemotherapy, using real-world data.Methods: A 
three health states (progression-free, progressed disease, dead) partitioned 
survival model was developed. The SOuth East Netherlands Advanced BREast Cancer 
(SONABRE) registry informed the effectiveness and costs inputs. Health state 
utility values were obtained from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) between the eribulin and matched non-eribulin chemotherapy was 
estimated. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and scenario 
analyses were performed. The financial risk (i.e., the expected value of perfect 
information (EVPI) plus the expected monetary loss (eML) associated with 
reimbursing eribulin) and budget impact associated with reimbursing eribulin 
were calculated.Results: Eribulin led to higher health benefits (0.07 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY)) and costs (€15,321) compared with 
non-eribulin chemotherapy. This resulted in an ICER of €220,608. At a €80,000 
per QALY threshold, the risk of reimbursing eribulin was €9,791 per patient 
(EVPI €13, eML €9,778). Scaled up to the Dutch population, the estimated annual 
budget impact was €1.9 million and the annual risk of reimbursing eribulin was 
€2.7 million.Conclusion: From a Dutch societal perspective, eribulin is not cost 
effective when considering its list price as third and later chemotherapy line 
for ABC patients.

BACKGROUND: Serious mental illness (SMI), defined as a mental disorder causing 
functional impairment, affects 9.8 million Americans. SMI correlates with 
earlier onset, more extensive cardiac disease, and reduced life expectancy by 25 
years. The impact of SMI on patients undergoing cardiac surgery has not been 
extensively studied. We hypothesized that patients with SMI have worse cardiac 
surgery outcomes.
METHODS: Using our institution's Society of Thoracic Surgeons database of 16,781 
cardiac operations (2002-2017), a total of 1445 (8.7%) patients with SMI were 
identified and stratified into anxiety, mood disorders, and psychosis. The 
risk-adjusted impact on morbidity and mortality were evaluated using 
multivariable regression.
RESULTS: Patients with SMI were more often female patients, were younger, and 
had more comorbid disease. SMI patients were more likely to have had previous 
cardiac surgery and require urgent or emergent procedures (both P < .05). Among 
specific SMI diagnoses, patients with psychosis had worse outcomes compared with 
the general population, with higher operative mortality (9.1% vs 4.2%; P = 
.001), major morbidity (30.4% vs 15.8%; P < .0001), and cost ($50,211 vs 
$38,820; P < .001). After multivariable risk adjustment, SMI and psychosis 
remained independently associated with composite mortality and major morbidity 
(odds ratio, 1.21; P = .012; and odds ratio, 1.68; P = .003, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: SMI is independently associated with morbidity and mortality after 
cardiac surgery. SMI patients, especially the subset with psychosis, are 
complicated, high-risk, and resource-consuming. Refined strategies to reduce 
postoperative complications and improve care coordination are necessary in this 
population.
