not universal or sustained. Cost-effectiveness of ED-based screening could 
enhance implementation. We address the question: Is HIV screening in the ED 
cost-effective? Using the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, we conducted a 
systematic review of economic evaluations of ED-based HIV screening. We found 
311 studies with 12 duplicates. We excluded 276 studies that did not conduct 
economic evaluations and another three for lack of quantitative data, leaving 20 
articles for the full review. We reviewed cost-effectiveness ratios (CER), 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), and average costs per diagnosis, 
quality-adjusted life years, averted transmissions and per patient linked to 
care. CER and ICER were below CDC thresholds indicating that HIV screening in 
the ED is cost-effective. Therefore, ED-based HIV screening should be widely 
implemented, supported and sustained as a cost-effective tool for combating 
HIV/AIDS.

BACKGROUND: A number of German statutory health insurance companies are offering 
integrated care contracts for homeopathy (ICCHs) that cover the reimbursement of 
homeopathic treatment. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these 
contracts are highly debated.
METHODS: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatment after 
an additional enrollment in an ICCH, a comparative, prospective, observational 
study was conducted in which participants in the ICCH (HOM group) were compared 
with matched (on diagnosis, sex and age) insured individuals (CON group) who 
received usual care alone. Those insured with either migraine or headache, 
allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis and depression were included. 
Primary effectiveness outcomes were the baseline adjusted scores of 
diagnosis-specific questionnaires (e.g. RQLQ, AQLQ, DLQI, BDI-II) after 
6 months. Primary cost-effectiveness endpoints were the baseline adjusted total 
costs from an insurer perspective in relation to the achieved quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs). Costs were derived from health claims data and QALYs were 
calculated based on SF-12 data.
RESULTS: Data from 2524 participants (1543 HOM group) were analyzed. The primary 
effectiveness outcomes after six months were statistically significant in favor 
of the HOM group for migraine or headache (Δ = difference between groups, days 
with headache: - 0.9, p = 0.042), asthma (Δ-AQLQ(S): + 0.4, p = 0.014), atopic 
dermatitis (Δ-DLQI: - 5.6, p ≤ 0.001) and depression (Δ-BDI-II: - 5.6, 
p ≤ 0.001). BDI-II differences reached the minimal clinically important 
difference. For all diagnoses, the adjusted mean total costs over 12 months were 
higher in the HOM group from an insurer perspective, with migraine or headache, 
atopic dermatitis and depression suggesting cost-effectiveness in terms of 
additional costs per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: After an additional enrollment in the ICCH, the treatment of 
participants with depression showed minimally clinically relevant improvements. 
From an insurer perspective, treatment with an ICCH enrollment resulted in 
higher costs over all diagnoses but seemed to be cost-effective for migraine or 
headache, atopic dermatitis and depression according to international used 
threshold values. Based on the study design and further limitations, our 
findings should be considered cautiously and no conclusions regarding the 
effectiveness of specific treatment components can be made. Further research is 
needed to overcome limitations of this study and to confirm our findings.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have investigated the associations between ambient 
temperature and years of life lost (YLLs), but few focused on the difference of 
life loss attributable to temperature among different socioeconomic development 
levels.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated the disparity in temperature-YLL rate relationships 
and life loss per death attributable to nonoptimal temperature in regions with 
various development levels.
METHODS: Three hundred sixty-four Chinese counties or districts were classified 
into 92 high-development regions (HDRs) and 272 low-development regions (LDRs) 
according to socioeconomic factors of each location using K-means clustering 
approach. We used distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) and multivariate 
meta-analysis to estimate the temperature-YLL rate relationships. We calculated 
attributable fraction (AF) of YLL and temperature-related average life loss per 
death to compare mortality burden of temperature between HDRs and LDRs. 
Stratified analyses were conducted by region, age, sex and cause of death.
RESULTS: We found that non-optimal temperatures increased YLL rates in both HDRs 
and LDRs, but all subgroups in LDRs were more vulnerable. The disparity of cold 
effects between HDRs and LDRs was significant, while the difference in heat 
effect was insignificant. The overall AF of non-optimal temperature in LDRs 
[AF = 12.2, 95% empirical confidence interval (eCI):11.0-13.5%] was higher than 
that in HDRs (AF = 8.9, 95% eCI: 8.3-9.5%). Subgroups analyses found that most 
groups in LDRs had greater AFs than that in HDRs. The average life loss per 
death due to non-optimal temperature in LDRs (1.91 years, 95% eCI: 1.72-2.10) 
was also higher than that in HDRs (1.32 years, 95% eCI: 1.23-1.41). Most of AFs 
and life loss per death were caused by moderate cold in both HDRs and LDRs.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality burden caused by temperature was more significant in LDRs 
than that in HDRs, which means that more attention should be paid to vulnerable 
populations in LDRs in planning adaptive strategies.

The ability to work at older ages depends on health and education. Both 
accumulate starting very early in life. We assess how childhood disadvantages 
combine with education to affect working and health trajectories. Applying 
multistate period life tables to data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) 
for the period 2008-2014, we estimate how the residual life expectancy at age 50 
is distributed in number of years of work and disability, by number of childhood 
disadvantages, gender, and race/ethnicity. Our findings indicate that number of 
childhood disadvantages is negatively associated with work and positively with 
disability, irrespective of gender and race/ethnicity. Childhood disadvantages 
intersect with low education resulting in shorter lives, and redistributing life 
years from work to disability. Among the highly educated, health and work 
differences between groups of childhood disadvantage are small. Combining 
multistate models and inverse probability weighting, we show that the return of 
high education is greater among the most disadvantaged.

OBJECTIVE: Surveillance following colorectal cancer (CRC) resection uses optical 
colonoscopy (OC) to detect intraluminal disease and CT to detect extracolonic 
recurrence. CT colonography (CTC) might be an efficient use of resources in this 
situation because it allows for intraluminal and extraluminal evaluations with 
one test.
DESIGN: We developed a simulation model to compare lifetime costs and benefits 
for a cohort of patients with resected CRC. Standard of care involved annual CT 
for 3 years and OC for years 1, 4 and every 5 years thereafter. For the 
CTC-based strategy, we replace CT+OC at year 1 with CTC. Patients with lesions 
greater than 6 mm detected by CTC underwent OC. Detection of an adenoma 10 mm or 
larger was followed by OC at 1 year, then every 3 years thereafter. Test 
characteristics and costs for CTC were derived from a clinical study. Medicare 
costs were used for cancer care costs as well as alternative test costs. We 
discounted costs and effects at 3% per year.
RESULTS: For persons with resected stage III CRC, the standard-of-care strategy 
was more costly (US$293) and effective (2.6 averted CRC cases and 1.1 averted 
cancer deaths per 1000) than the CTC-based strategy, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of US$55 500 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Our 
analysis was most sensitive to the sensitivity of CTC for detecting polyps 10 mm 
or larger and assumptions about disease progression.
CONCLUSION: In a simulation model, we found that replacing the standard-of-care 
approach to postdiagnostic surveillance with a CTC-based strategy is not an 
efficient use of resources in most situations.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to analyse the cost-utility and budget impact of 
adding tocilizumab to the standard treatment for patients with refractory 
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in Thailand.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation using a decision-analytical model.
SETTING: Thailand.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with refractory sJIA who were ≥2 years old.
METHODS: The use of tocilizumab as an add-on therapy to standard treatment was 
compared with standard treatment alone. A simulated health state transition 
model was used to estimate the lifetime costs and health outcomes from a 
societal perspective. Direct medical costs were collected from tertiary hospital 
databases while direct non-medical costs were derived from interviews. 
Health-related quality of life (QoL) was measured using the proxy version of 
three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L). Future costs and 
outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. The base case population was 
patients aged 9.41 years old at refractory disease onset. The results were 
reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) in US dollar (USD). 
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to investigate 
parameter uncertainty. The 5-year budget impact was estimated from a 
governmental perspective.
RESULTS: The ICER of standard treatment plus tocilizumab was US$35 799 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with standard treatment alone, 
which was not cost-effective at the threshold of US$5128 per QALY gained. The 
estimated 5 years budget impact was approximately US$4.8 million.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of standard treatment plus tocilizumab was not 
cost-effective in the Thai context, which has limited data. However, there is 
currently no second-line treatment for refractory sJIA in the Thai National List 
of Essential Medicines; thus, patients must receive higher doses of standard 
treatment which can cause many side effects. In contrast, tocilizumab showed 
obvious efficacy in clinical trials in improving treatment response and QoL. 
Therefore, the price of tocilizumab should be negotiated to reduce the financial 
impact on the healthcare system.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the health economic burden of epilepsy for Australians 
of working age by using life table modeling and to model whether improved 
seizure control may result in substantial health economic benefits.
METHODS: Life table modeling was used for working age Australians aged 15-69 
years with epilepsy and the cohort was followed until age 70 years. Published 
2017 population and epilepsy-related data regarding epilepsy prevalence, 
mortality, and productivity were used. This model was then re-simulated, 
assuming the cohort no longer had epilepsy. Differences in outcomes between 
these cohorts were attributed to epilepsy. Scenarios were also simulated in 
which the proportion of seizure-free patients increased from baseline 70% up to 
75% and 80%.
RESULTS: In 2017, Australians of working age with epilepsy followed until age 70 
years were predicted to experience over 14,000 excess deaths, more than 78,000 
years of life lost, and over 146,000 productivity-adjusted life years lost due 
to epilepsy. This resulted in lost gross domestic product (GDP) of US $22.1 
billion. Increasing seizure freedom by 5% and 10% would reduce health care 
costs, save years of life, and translate to US $2.6 billion and US $5.3 billion 
GDP retained for seizure freedom rates of 75% and 80%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the considerable societal and economic burden 
of epilepsy. Relatively modest improvements in overall seizure control could 
bring substantial economic benefits.

The identification of genes and interventions that slow or reverse aging is 
hampered by the lack of non-invasive metrics that can predict the life 
expectancy of pre-clinical models. Frailty Indices (FIs) in mice are composite 
measures of health that are cost-effective and non-invasive, but whether they 
can accurately predict health and lifespan is not known. Here, mouse FIs are 
scored longitudinally until death and machine learning is employed to develop 
two clocks. A random forest regression is trained on FI components for 
chronological age to generate the FRIGHT (Frailty Inferred Geriatric Health 
Timeline) clock, a strong predictor of chronological age. A second model is 
trained on remaining lifespan to generate the AFRAID (Analysis of Frailty and 
Death) clock, which accurately predicts life expectancy and the efficacy of a 
lifespan-extending intervention up to a year in advance. Adoption of these 
clocks should accelerate the identification of longevity genes and aging 
interventions.

The ability to detect, respond and adapt to mitochondrial stress ensures the 
development and survival of organisms. Caenorhabditis elegans responds to 
mitochondrial stress by activating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response 
(UPRmt) to buffer the mitochondrial folding environment, rewire the metabolic 
state, and promote innate immunity and lifespan extension. Here we show that 
HDA-1, the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian histone deacetylase (HDAC) is 
required for mitochondrial stress-mediated activation of UPRmt. HDA-1 interacts 
and coordinates with the genome organizer DVE-1 to induce the transcription of a 
broad spectrum of UPRmt, innate immune response and metabolic reprogramming 
genes. In rhesus monkey and human tissues, HDAC1/2 transcript levels correlate 
with the expression of UPRmt genes. Knocking down or pharmacological inhibition 
of HDAC1/2 disrupts the activation of the UPRmt and the mitochondrial network in 
mammalian cells. Our results underscore an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of 
HDAC1/2 in modulating mitochondrial homeostasis and regulating longevity.

Currently, when determining treatment regimens, there is an emphasis on the 
quality of life (QOL), in addition to treatment efficacy. Especially in hormone 
receptor-positive breast cancer with distant metastases, unless death is 
imminent, a common first-line treatment is endocrine therapy, which has fewer 
side effects. In the present study, the differences in QOL were evaluated based 
on the age and prognostic indicators of 46 patients with hormone 
receptor-positive breast cancer with distant metastases (stage IV), who received 
first-line endocrine therapy at the Osaka City University Hospital (Osaka, 
Japan) between November 2007 and November 2016. QOL score before and after 
endocrine therapy was retrospectively analyzed, using the Quality of Life 
Questionnaire for Cancer Patients Treated with Anti-Cancer Drugs-Breast 
(QOL-ACD-B). There was no significant association between age and any of the 
clinicopathological features investigated. However, the QOL score of the elderly 
patient group was significantly higher compared with that of the younger group 
in the 'Satisfaction with treatment and coping with disease' subcategory 
(P=0.008). The QOL score of the younger age group in the same subcategory was 
significantly improved by the treatment (P=0.013). The patients that had an 
increased overall QOL score 3 months after treatment initiation had a 
significant extension of progression-free survival (PFS) rate compared to the 
patients with decreased or no change in QOL (P=0.032). In conclusion, 
psychological stress was more prominent in younger patients with stage IV breast 
cancer treated with hormonal therapy compared with elderly patients. 
Importantly, improving QOL within the 3 months after treatment initiation could 
lead to longer PFS rate.

Future approaches to clearing the latent human immunodeficiency virus reservoir: 
Beyond latency reversal.

Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: While combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) allows near-normal life 
expectancy for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), it is 
unable to cure the infection and so life long treatment is required.
OBJECTIVES: The main barrier to curing HIV is the latent reservoir of cells, 
which is stable and resistant to cART.
METHOD: Current approaches under investigation for clearing this reservoir 
propose a 'Shock and Kill' mechanism, in which active replication is induced in 
latent cells by latency reversal agents, theoretically allowing killing of the 
newly active cells.
RESULTS: However, previous studies have failed to achieve depletion of the T 
central memory cell reservoir, are unable to target other latent reservoirs and 
may be causing neurological damage to participants.
CONCLUSION: Future approaches to clearing the latent reservoir may bypass 
latency reversal through the use of drugs that selectively induce apoptosis in 
infected cells. Several classes of these pro-apoptotic drugs have shown promise 
in in vitro and ex vivo studies, and may represent the basis of a future 
functional cure for HIV.

BACKGROUND: The patterns of leukemia burden have dramatically changed in recent 
years. This study aimed to estimate the global trends of leukemia-related death 
and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: The data was acquired from the latest version of the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) study. Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated 
to estimate the trend of age-standardized rate (ASR) of death and DALYs due to 
leukemia and its main subtypes from 1990 to 2017.
RESULTS: Globally, the numbers of death and DALYs due to leukemia were 347.58 × 
103 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] = 317.26 × 103 -364.88 × 103 ) and 11975.35 × 
103 (95% UI = 10749.15 × 103 -12793.58 × 103 ) in 2017, with a 31.22% and 0.03% 
increase in absolute numbers from 1990 to 2017, respectively. Both of their ASR 
showed decreasing trends from 1990 to 2017 with the EAPCs being -1.04 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] = (-1.10--0.99) and -1.52 (95% CI = -1.59--1.44), 
respectively. Globally, the most pronounced decreasing trend of death and DALYs 
occurred in chronic myeloid leukemia with EAPCs of -2.76 (95% CI = -2.88--2.64) 
and -2.84 (95% CI = -2.97--2.70), respectively, while the trend increased in 
acute myeloid leukemia. The death and DALYs of leukemia decreased in most areas 
and countries with high socio-demographic index (SDI) including Bahrain, 
Finland, and Australia.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of death and DALYs due to leukemia decreased 
globally, and for most regions and countries from 1990 to 2017. However, the 
leukemia burden is still a substantial challenge globally and required adequate 
and affordable medical resources to improve the survival and quality of life of 
leukemia patients.

Hypertension is a common clinical problem in patients with cancer. This is 
explained by its high prevalence in the general population, by the improvement 
in life expectancy in oncology patients thanks to the progress of anti-cancer 
therapies, but also by cancer therapy, which is sometimes burdened with 
cardiovascular toxicity. Early detection of hypertension and proper management 
are crucial to ensure the continuation of oncology treatment and to protect 
patients from the consequences of hypertension. Renin-angiotensin system 
blockers and calcium channel blockers are the first-line treatments.

Publisher: L’hypertension artérielle (HTA) est un problème clinique fréquent 
chez les patients atteints d’un cancer. Cela s’explique par sa prévalence déjà 
élevée dans la population générale, par l’amélioration de l’espérance de vie des 
patients oncologiques grâce aux progrès des thérapies anticancéreuses, mais 
également par l’utilisation de traitements oncologiques qui sont parfois grevés 
d’une cardiotoxicité. Un dépistage précoce de l’HTA et une prise en charge 
adéquate sont alors capitaux afin d’assurer la pérennité des soins oncologiques 
et protéger les patients des conséquences de l’HTA. Les bloqueurs du système 
rénine angiotensine et les anticalciques représentent les traitements de 
première ligne.

With the rise of life-expectancy, the number of comorbidities can increase and 
lead to polypharmacy (≥ 5 drugs/day) and excessive polypharmacy (> 9 drugs/day). 
In order to define suitable therapeutic targets, it is essential to take into 
account the heterogeneity of this population which can be classified into 3 
categories : robust, vulnerable or dependent. In this context, the concept of 
deprescription, which englobes the process of tapering or stopping drugs, aimed 
at improving patient outcomes, becomes an important therapeutic tool. In the 
context of hypertension, this approach seems to be a safe, provided that 
patients can benefit from regular monitoring. It must be considered in 
vulnerable and dependent patients or patients institutionalized in nursing 
homes. Although, scientific evidence slowly accumulates, its levels remain 
moderate. Finally, the deprescribing process, can also be applied in specifics 
situations in order to prevent adverse events, such as during a heat wave.

Publisher: Avec le vieillissement de la population, le nombre de comorbidités 
augmente fréquemment et peut entraîner une polypharmacie (≥ 5 médicaments/jour) 
ou une polypharmacie excessive (> 9 médicaments/jour). Afin de définir des 
cibles thérapeutiques adaptées, il est primordial de tenir compte de 
l’hétérogénéité de cette population que l’on peut schématiquement classer en 3 
catégories : robustes, vulnérables et dépendants. Dans ce contexte, la 
déprescription, le fait d’arrêter ou de réduire la dose d’un médicament, est une 
action importante qu’il faut connaître et maîtriser. Pour l’hypertension, cette 
démarche semble être une pratique sûre, à condition, toutefois, que les patients 
puissent bénéficier d’un suivi régulier. Elle doit être considérée pour les 
personnes vulnérables et dépendantes, ou les patients institutionnalisés en 
établissements médico-sociaux. Bien que les évidences scientifiques commencent à 
s’accumuler, celles-ci restent d’un niveau modéré. Finalement, la déprescription 
peut également être ponctuelle afin de prévenir les effets indésirables d’une 
situation particulière, comme lors d’une canicule.

888. Deprescribing for Older Veterans: A Systematic Review [Internet].

Bloomfield H, Linsky A, Bolduc J, Greer N, Naidl T, Vardeny O, MacDonald R,

Washington (DC): Department of Veterans Affairs (US); 2019 Dec.
VA Evidence-based Synthesis Program Reports.

More than 40% of people in the United States age ≥65 years take 5 or more 
prescription medications on a regular basis to control and/or prevent disease 
symptoms and complications. Exposure to multiple medications, known as 
polypharmacy, is associated with increased risk of negative outcomes, such as 
falls, cognitive impairment and other geriatric syndromes, hospitalizations, and 
death. The number of medications a person is taking may be the single most 
important predictor of adverse drug effects. Furthermore, about 50% of older 
adults are taking 1 or more potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), 
including those without a clear indication, duplicative medications, and 
medications known to pose risks in the elderly. Efforts have been underway for 
more than 30 years to develop and test interventions to mitigate the adverse 
effects of polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use. Initially, drug 
discontinuation efforts were focused on stopping specific medications considered 
to be problematic in older adults. This has evolved into a more holistic 
approach, called “deprescribing”, that considers medications in the context of 
the individual’s co-morbidities, functional status, treatment goals, and life 
expectancy. Deprescribing has been defined as “the clinically supervised process 
of stopping or reducing the dose of medications when they cause harm or no 
longer provide benefit”. The Center for Medication Safety in Aging, a VA Patient 
Safety Center of Inquiry, was charged with development and implementation of 
deprescribing approaches in VA settings. The purpose of this evidence review, 
commissioned by the National Center for Patient Safety and endorsed by the VHA 
Pharmacy Benefits Management and the Geriatrics and Extended Care Services, is 
to inform that work.

University, Xiamen, Fujian Province, People's Republic of China.

PURPOSE: A considerable number of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients require 
amputation every year, which worsens their quality of life, aggravates the 
social burden, and shortens their life expectancy. Considering these negative 
effects, it is important to explore the relative risk factors affecting 
amputation in DFU patients.
METHODS: The PubMed, SCIE and Embase databases were comprehensively searched for 
prospective or retrospective studies published before October 31, 2019. All 
English language studies involving DFU patients were included, and RevMan 5.3 
software was used to analyse the data.
RESULTS: This meta-analysis includes 21 studies involving 6505 participants, 
including 2006 patients who required a lower limb amputation. The following 
variables were associated with an increased risk of amputation: male sex (odds 
ratios (OR) = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.16~1.46, P<0.00001), 
smoking history (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.04~1.35, P = 0.009), a history of foot 
ulcers (OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 2.00~3.07, P<0.00001), osteomyelitis (OR = 3.70, 95% 
CI = 3.02~4.53, P<0.00001), gangrene (OR = 10.90, 95% CI = 5.73~20.8, 
P<0.00001), a lower body mass index (mean difference IV (MD) = -0.88, 95% CI = 
-1.30~-0.47, P<0.0001), and a higher white blood cell count (MD = 2.42, 95% CI = 
2.02~2.82, P<0.00001). However, age (MD = 1.24, 95% CI = -0.45~2.93, P = 0.15), 
type of diabetes (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.61~1.52, P = 0.86), hypertension (OR = 
1.19, 95% CI = 0.96~1.47, P = 0.12), and HbA1c level (MD = 0.02, 95% CI = 
-0.28~0.33, P = 0.87) were not associated with amputation in patients with DFU.
CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis identified several risk factors for amputation in 
DFU patients, including the male sex, a smoking history, a history of foot 
ulcers, osteomyelitis, gangrene, a lower body mass index, and a higher white 
blood cell count. Once gangrene occurs, the risk of amputation rapidly 
increases.

OBJECTIVE: Children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP) have gait impairments 
resulting from decreased selective motor control, an inability to move the leg 
joints independently of one another, relying on excessive flexion or extension 
coupling across the 3 joints. Infants with white matter injury are at high risk 
of CP and have decreased selective motor control as early as 1 month corrected 
age. An in-home kicking-activated mobile task was developed to motivate more 
selective hip-knee control of infants at high risk of CP. The purposes of this 
study were to determine the feasibility of the in-home mobile task and to 
determine whether infants at high risk of CP and infants with typical 
development (TD) learn the association between their leg movements and mobile 
activation.
METHODS: Ten infants at high risk of CP based on neuroimaging and 11 infants 
with TD participated in this cohort study at 3.5 to 4.5 months corrected age. 
Each infant participated in the in-home kicking-activated mobile task for 8 to 
10 min/d, 5 d/wk, for 6 weeks. Learning was assessed weekly based on an increase 
in the time that the infant demonstrated the reinforced leg actions when 
interacting with the kicking-activated mobile compared with spontaneous kicking.
RESULTS: With regard to feasibility, participation averaged 92% for infants at 
high risk of CP and 99% for infants with TD. With regard to learning, the group 
at high risk of CP demonstrated learning of the task for 2 of 6 weeks, whereas 
the group with TD demonstrated learning for all 6 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Infants at high risk of CP demonstrated learning of the 
kicking-activated mobile task but at a reduced amount compared with infants with 
TD. Further research is necessary to determine whether the kicking-activated 
mobile task has potential as an intervention to motivate more selective hip-knee 
control and improve walking outcomes of infants at high risk of CP.
IMPACT: This study investigated the feasibility of an in-home kicking-activated 
mobile task, a discovery learning task designed to motivate infants at high risk 
of CP to engage in the intensive task practice necessary to promote their 
learning abilities and selective motor control.
LAY SUMMARY: CP is a lifelong disorder of movement caused by abnormal 
development or early damage to the brain. If an in-home infant kicking-activated 
mobile task could be used to motivate certain types of age-appropriate leg 
movements of infants who are at high risk of CP, the task could help improve 
walking outcomes, which eventually could contribute to improving children's 
ability to participate in daily life. This study showed that infants at high 
risk of CP did learn the infant kicking-activated mobile task but at a much 
reduced amount compared with infants who are developing typically; so, this is a 
first step in determining whether the task has potential to motivate more 
age-appropriate leg movements in infants at high risk of cerebral palsy.

F-Box Gene D5RF Is Regulated by Agrobacterium Virulence Protein VirD5 and 
Essential for Agrobacterium-Mediated Plant Transformation.

We previously reported that the Agrobacterium virulence protein VirD5 possesses 
transcriptional activation activity, binds to a specific DNA element D5RE, and 
is required for Agrobacterium-mediated stable transformation, but not for 
transient transformation. However, direct evidence for a role of VirD5 in plant 
transcriptional regulation has been lacking. In this study, we found that the 
Arabidopsis gene D5RF (coding for VirD5 response F-box protein, At3G49480) is 
regulated by VirD5. D5RF has two alternative transcripts of 930 bp and 1594 bp 
that encode F-box proteins of 309 and 449 amino acids, designated as D5RF.1 and 
D5RF.2, respectively. D5RF.2 has a N-terminal extension of 140 amino acids 
compared to D5RF.1, and both of them are located in the plant cell nucleus. The 
promoter of the D5RF.1 contains two D5RE elements and can be activated by VirD5. 
The expression of D5RF is downregulated when the host plant is infected with 
virD5 deleted Agrobacterium. Similar to VirD5, D5RF also affects the stable but 
not transient transformation efficiency of Agrobacterium. Some 
pathogen-responsive genes are downregulated in the d5rf mutant. In conclusion, 
this study further confirmed Agrobacterium VirD5 as the plant transcription 
activator and identified Arabidopsis thalianaD5RF.1 as the first target gene of 
VirD5 in regulation.

National Disaster Management System: COVID-19 Case in Korea.

Kim J(1), Ashihara K(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Business, Konkuk University, 120 Neungdong-ro, Seoul 05029, Korea.

The COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges for governments and 
societies around the world and represents a global crisis of hitherto 
unexperienced proportions. Our research seeks to analyse disaster management 
systems from a national perspective by examining the Korean management of the 
COVID-19 crisis according to a four-phase epidemiological disaster management 
system. Utilising a meta-study, official documents, reports and interviews, we 
explore the role of the control tower mechanism related to the life-cycle of 
disaster management, and Korea's sustainable containment strategy. This study 
begins with a discussion of the crisis and disaster management literature and 
provides specific information related to the Korean government's response to 
COVID-19. It continues by detailing specific strategies such as wide-spread 
testing, tracking, treatment and quarantine that have enabled Korea to prevent 
wide-spread community transmission. The study concludes emphasising the 
relevance of systematic national disaster management, providing insight into 
methods for containment in Korea - a system commended by the WHO. Implications 
include the extension and the efficient application of disaster management 
theory by empirical application and integration of concepts.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine the renal clearance of 
flunixin and meloxicam in pigs and compare plasma and urine concentrations and 
tissue residues. Urine clearance is important for livestock show animals where 
urine is routinely tested for these drugs. Fourteen Yorkshire/Landrace cross 
pigs were housed in individual metabolism cages to facilitate urine collection. 
This is a unique feature of this study compared to other reports. Animals 
received either 2.2 mg/kg flunixin or 0.4 mg/kg meloxicam via intramuscular 
injection and samples analyzed by mass spectrometry. Pigs were euthanized when 
drugs were no longer detected in urine and liver and kidneys were collected to 
quantify residues.
RESULTS: Drug levels in urine reached peak concentrations between 4 and 8 h 
post-dose for both flunixin and meloxicam. Flunixin urine concentrations were 
higher than maximum levels in plasma. Urine concentrations for flunixin and 
meloxicam were last detected above the limit of quantification at 120 h and 
48 h, respectively. The renal clearance of flunixin and meloxicam was 
4.72 ± 2.98 mL/h/kg and 0.16 ± 0.04 mL/h/kg, respectively. Mean apparent 
elimination half-life in plasma was 5.00 ± 1.89 h and 3.22 ± 1.52 h for flunixin 
and meloxicam, respectively. Six of seven pigs had detectable liver 
concentrations of flunixin (range 0.0001-0.0012 µg/g) following negative urine 
samples at 96 and 168 h, however all samples at 168 h were below the FDA 
tolerance level (0.03 µg/g). Meloxicam was detected in a single liver sample 
(0.0054 µg/g) at 72 h but was below the EU MRL (0.065 µg/g).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that pigs given a single intramuscular dose of 
meloxicam at 0.4 mg/kg or flunixin at 2.2 mg/kg are likely to have detectable 
levels of the parent drug in urine up to 2 days and 5 days, respectively, after 
the first dose, but unlikely to have tissue residues above the US FDA tolerance 
or EU MRL following negative urine testing. This information will assist 
veterinarians in the therapeutic use of these drugs prior to livestock shows and 
also inform livestock show authorities involved in testing for these substances.
