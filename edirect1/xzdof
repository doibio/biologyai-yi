Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) use was initially reported in cystic fibrosis (CF) 
in 1991 as a bridge to lung transplantation, and over the decades, the use of 
NIV has increased in the CF population. Individuals with CF are prone to various 
physiologic changes as lung function worsens, and they benefit from NIV for 
advanced lung disease. As life expectancy in CF has been increasing due to 
advances such as highly effective modulator therapy, people with CF may also 
benefit from NIV for other diagnosis beyond advanced lung disease. NIV can 
improve gas exchange, quality of sleep, exercise tolerance, and augment airway 
clearance in CF. CF providers can readily become comfortable with this 
therapeutic modality. In this review, we will summarize the physiologic basis 
for NIV use in CF, describe indications for initiation, and discuss how to order 
and monitor patients on NIV. We will discuss aspects unique to people with CF 
and the use of NIV, as well as suggestions on how to reduce risks such as 
infection. We hope that this serves as a resource for CF providers, in 
particular those who do not have dedicated training in sleep medicine as we all 
continue to care for the CF patient population.

Brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys (Stål) (Hemiptera: 
Pentatomidae), is a pest of concern that must be controlled for market access of 
host material and regulated articles to certain countries. This work outlines a 
rearing system for BMSB on live cowpea plants, Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. 
(Fabales: Fabaceae), including methods to induce adults to both enter and exit 
diapause. This scalable system affords continuous access to >600 specimens per 
week of each life stage and/or age group, which is particularly advantageous 
when developing treatment efficacy data.

PURPOSE: Early-onset (EO) colorectal cancer (CRC, age < 50 years) incidence is 
increasing. Decisions on optimal adjuvant therapy should consider treatment 
adherence, adverse events, and expected outcomes in a population with life 
expectancy longer than later-onset (LO) CRC (age ≥ 50 years).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individual patient data from six trials in the 
International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy database were 
analyzed. Characteristics, treatment adherence, and adverse events in stage II 
or III EO-CRC and LO-CRC were compared. To reduce confounders of 
non-cancer-related deaths because of age or comorbidities, time to recurrence 
(3-year relapse-free rate) and cancer-specific survival (5-year cancer-specific 
mortality rate) were considered.
RESULTS: Out of 16,349 patients, 1,564 (9.6%) had EO-CRC. Compared with LO-CRC, 
EO-CRC had better performance status (86% v 80%, P < .01), similar T stage (% 
T1-3/T4: 76/24 v 77/23, P = .97), higher N2 disease rate (24% v 22%, P < .01), 
more likely to complete the planned treatment duration (83.2% v 78.2%, P < .01), 
and received a higher treatment dose intensity, especially with 6-month 
regimens. Gastrointestinal toxicity was more common in EO-CRC; hematologic 
toxicity was more frequent in LO-CRC. Compared with LO-CRC, significantly worse 
cancer-specific outcomes were demonstrated especially in high-risk stage III 
EO-CRC: lower 3-year relapse-free rate (54% v 65%; hazard ratio [HR] 1.33; 95% 
CI, 1.14 to 1.55; P value < .001) and higher 5-year cancer-specific mortality 
rate (24% v 20%; HR 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.47; P value < .06). In this 
subgroup, no difference was observed with 3 or 6 months of therapy, with equally 
poor disease-free survival rates (57% v 56%; HR 0.97; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.29; P 
value = .85).
CONCLUSION: Young age is negatively prognostic in high-risk stage III CRC and 
associated with significantly higher relapse rate; this is despite better 
treatment adherence and higher administered treatment intensity, suggesting more 
aggressive disease biology.

INTRODUCTION: As a result of the increasing average human life expectancy and 
the related population growth in many countries, research on factors increasing 
seniors' quality of life is becoming particularly important. An event critical 
for seniors' functioning is retirement. A concept reflecting the dynamics of 
seniors' personality associated with the changes taking place in their life 
situation is psychological capital. This concept was identified as a factor that 
is constituted by four personality variables changing because of experiences: 
self-efficacy, optimism, psychological resilience, and hope of success. An 
interesting issue is the relationship between psychological capital and quality 
of life in seniors working after retirement.
AIM: The aim of this paper was to analyze the relationship between psychological 
capital (self-efficacy, dispositional optimism, psychological resilience) and 
quality of life in seniors working after retirement, as well as the mediating 
role of hope of success in this relationship.
METHODS: A total of 304 seniors-103 women and 201 men-participated in the study. 
The mean age was 65.24. The Quality-of-Life Scale (CASP-19), the Polish 
adaptation of Life Orientation Test (LOT-R), the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale 
(GSES), the Hope of Success Questionnaire (KNS), and polish adaptation of the 
Resilience Assessment Scale (SPP-25) were employed in the research. A mediation 
model was applied to explore the pathway from psychological capital via hope of 
success to quality of life.
RESULTS: The tested components of psychological capital correlate positively 
with working senior citizens' quality of life. The mediating role of hope of 
success between psychological capital and quality of life was confirmed. The 
study presented three mechanisms in which hope of success strengthens the 
relationships between the components of psychological capital and working senior 
citizens' quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The mediating role of hope of success between the remaining 
components of psychological capital and quality of life confirms pattern posited 
in the COR theory, namely, that increasing one resource leads to the activation 
of others, which results in a spiral of personal resources being generated. One 
the one hand, people who have greater resources have a greater capacity for 
generating spirals of gains. One the other hand, individuals who lack personal 
resources are both more exposed to losing them and less capable of starting a 
spiral of gains in resources.

BACKGROUND: The sex gap in life expectancy has been narrowing in Finland over 
the past 4-5 decades; however, on average, women still live longer than men. 
Epigenetic clocks are markers for biological aging which predict life span. In 
this study, we examined the mediating role of lifestyle factors on the 
association between sex and biological aging in younger and older adults.
METHODS: Our sample consists of younger and older twins (21‒42 years, n = 1 477; 
50‒76 years, n = 763) including 151 complete younger opposite-sex twin pairs 
(21‒30 years). Blood-based DNA methylation was used to compute epigenetic age 
acceleration by 4 epigenetic clocks as a measure of biological aging. Path 
modeling was used to study whether the association between sex and biological 
aging is mediated through lifestyle-related factors, that is, education, body 
mass index, smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity.
RESULTS: In comparison to women, men were biologically older and, in general, 
they had unhealthier life habits. The effect of sex on biological aging was 
partly mediated by body mass index and, in older twins, by smoking. Sex was 
directly associated with biological aging and the association was stronger in 
older twins.
CONCLUSIONS: Previously reported sex differences in life span are also evident 
in biological aging. Declining smoking prevalence among men is a plausible 
explanation for the narrowing of the difference in life expectancy between the 
sexes. Data generated by the epigenetic clocks may help in estimating the 
effects of lifestyle and environmental factors on aging and in predicting aging 
in future generations.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies highlight the equigenic potential of greenspaces by 
showing narrower socioeconomic health inequalities in greener areas. However, 
results to date have been inconsistent and derived from high-income countries. 
We examined whether urban greenness modifies the associations between area-level 
education, as a proxy for socioeconomic status, and life expectancy and 
cause-specific mortality in Latin American cities.
METHODS: We included 28 large cities, >137 million inhabitants, in nine Latin 
American countries, comprising 671 sub-city units, for 2012-2016. Socioeconomic 
status was assessed through a composite index of sub-city level education, and 
greenness was calculated using the normalized difference vegetation index. We 
fitted multilevel models with sub-city units nested in cities, with life 
expectancy or log(mortality) as the outcome.
FINDINGS: We observed a social gradient, with higher levels of education 
associated with higher life expectancy and lower cause-specific mortality. There 
was weak evidence supporting the equigenesis hypothesis as greenness 
differentially modified the association between education and mortality 
outcomes. We observed an equigenic effect, with doubling magnitudes in the 
violence-related mortality reduction by education in areas with low greenness 
compared to medium-high greenness areas among men (16% [95% CI 12%-20%] vs 8% 
[95% CI 4%-11%] per 1 SD increase in area-level education). However, in 
contradiction to the equigenesis hypothesis, the magnitude in cardiovascular 
diseases (CVD) mortality reduction by education was stronger in areas with 
medium-high greenness compared to areas with low greenness (6% [95% CI 4%-7%] vs 
1% [95% CI -1%-3%] and 5% [95% CI 3%-7%] vs 1% [95% CI -1%-3%] per 1 SD increase 
in area-level education, in women and men, respectively). Similarly, each 1-SD 
increase in greenness widened the educational inequality in life expectancy by 
0.15 years and 0.20 years, in women and men, respectively. The equigenic effect 
was not observed in violence-related mortality among women and in mortality due 
to communicable diseases, maternal, neonatal and nutritional conditions (CMNN).
INTERPRETATION: Our results confirm socioeconomic health inequalities in Latin 
American cities and show that the equigenic properties of greenspace vary by 
health outcome. Although mixed, our findings suggest that future greening 
policies should account for local social and economic conditions to ensure that 
greenspaces provide health benefits for all, and do not further exacerbate 
existing health inequalities in the region.

BACKGROUND: The effect of preventive health care on health expenditures is 
ambiguous. On the one hand, prevention reduces the costs of future morbidity. On 
the other hand, prevention leads to costs of life extension. The purpose of this 
paper is to develop a parsimonious model that determines for a preventive 
measure of interest whether savings from preventing morbidity are more than 
offset by the costs of living longer, resulting in a net expenditure increase.
METHODS: A theoretical model was built based on a Weibull survival function. It 
includes savings and life extension costs over the remaining lifetime. The model 
was applied to the example of obesity prevention.
RESULTS: The model shows that the cost consequences of prevention are 
essentially driven by two factors: i) the relative reduction of 
morbidity-related costs, which determines the amount of savings from avoiding 
morbidity; and ii) the hazard ratio of death, which determines the amount of 
life extension costs. In the application example, the model is able to validate 
the results of a more complex cost-effectiveness model on obesity prevention.
CONCLUSIONS: This work provides new insight into the lifetime cost consequences 
of prevention. The model can be used both to check plausibility of the results 
of other models and to conduct an independent analysis.

INTRODUCTION: Rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) remains a leading cause of 
hospitalization and death in children under five years of age in the 
Philippines. Rotavirus (RV) vaccination was introduced into the national 
immunization program (NIP) in 2012 but has since been limited to one region due 
to cost considerations and conflicting local cost-effectiveness estimates. 
Updated estimates of the cost-effectiveness of RV vaccination are required to 
inform prioritization of national immunization activities.
METHODS: We calculated the potential costs and benefits of rotavirus vaccination 
over a 10-year-period (2021-2031) from a government and societal perspective, 
comparing four alternative rotavirus vaccines: Rotavac, Rotasiil, Rotarix and 
Rotateq. For each vaccine, a proportionate outcomes model was used to calculate 
the expected number of disease events, DALYs, vaccination program costs, and 
healthcare costs, with and without vaccination. The primary outcome measure was 
the cost per DALY averted. Assuming each product would generate similar 
benefits, the dominant (lowest cost) product was identified. We then calculated 
the cost-effectiveness (US$ per Disability Adjusted Life Year [DALY] averted) of 
the least costly product and compared it to willingness-to-pay thresholds of 0.5 
and 1 times the national GDP per capita ($3,485), and ran deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Introducing any of the four rotavirus vaccines would avert around 40% 
of RVGE visits, hospitalizations, and deaths over the period 2021-2031. Over the 
same ten-year period, the incremental cost of vaccination from a government 
perspective was estimated to be around $104, $105, $220, and $277 million for 
Rotavac, Rotasiil, Rotarix and Rotateq, respectively. The equivalent cost from a 
societal perspective was $58, $60, $178 and $231 million. The cost-effectiveness 
of the least costly product (Rotavac) was $1,148 ($830-$1682) from a government 
perspective and $646 ($233-1277) from a societal perspective. All other products 
offered similar benefits but at a higher cost. There is a >99% probability that 
Rotavac would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold set at 0.5 
times the national GDP per capita.
CONCLUSION: Both Rotavac and Rotasiil are likely to be cost-effective options in 
the Philippines, but it is not possible to say definitively which product should 
be preferred. Rotarix and Rotateq are expected to offer similar benefits at more 
cost, so would need to be priced far more competitively to be considered for 
introduction.

Cost-Effectiveness of Screening Preschool Children for Hearing Loss in 
Australia.

OBJECTIVES: While all newborns in Australia are tested for congenital hearing 
loss through universal newborn hearing screening programs, some children will 
acquire hearing loss in their first five years of life. Delayed diagnosed or 
undiagnosed hearing loss in children can have substantial immediate- and 
long-term consequences. It can significantly reduce school readiness, language 
and communication development, social and emotional development, and mental 
health. It can also compromise lifetime educational achievements and employment 
opportunities and future economic contribution to society through lost 
productivity. The need for a universal hearing screening program for children 
entering their first year of primary school has been noted in two separate 
Australian Government hearing inquiries in the last decade. Sound Scouts is a 
hearing screening application (app) that tests for hearing loss in children 
using a tablet or mobile device, supervised by parents at home. It tests for 
sensorineural or permanent conductive hearing loss and central auditory 
processing disorder in children. In 2018 the Australian Government funded the 
roll-out of Sound Scouts to allow up to 600,000 children to test their hearing 
using Sound Scouts. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of screening 
5-year-old children for hearing loss using Sound Scouts at home, compared with 
no screening.
DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the incremental 
costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of administering Sound Scouts over 
a 20-year time horizon. Testing accuracy was based on comparing Sound Scouts 
test results to clinical test results while other parameters were based on 
published data. Costs were estimated from the perspective of the Australian 
health care system. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
undertaken.
RESULTS: Sound Scouts is estimated to result in an average incremental cost of 
A$61.02 and an average incremental increase in QALYs of 0.01. This resulted in 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A$5392 per QALY gained, which is 
likely to be considered cost-effective by Australian decision makers. Screening 
with Sound Scouts was found to have a 96.2 per cent probability of being 
cost-effective using a threshold of A$60,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Using Sound Scouts to screen five-year-old children for hearing 
loss (at home) is likely to be cost-effective. Screening children using Sound 
Scouts will result in early identification and intervention in childhood hearing 
loss, thereby reducing early childhood disadvantage through cumulative gains in 
quality of life, education, and economic outcomes over their lifetime.

Effect of Systemic Intraoperative Heparin Use on Upper Extremity Arteriovenous 
Fistula Patency in End-Stage Renal Disease Patients.

Bahi M(1).

Author information:
(1)MBChB, Department of Vascular Surgery, Wellington Hospital, Wellington, New 
Zealand.

The formation of the arteriovenous fistula is an important method of vascular 
access for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This allows renal 
filtration resulting in improved life quality and expectancy for ESRD patients. 
The biggest drawback to arteriovenous fistula formation is thrombosis, which can 
occur at an early or delayed stage. One suggested method of reducing 
postoperative arteriovenous fistula thrombosis rates is the administration of 
intraoperative systemic heparin. Heparin use in this context is debated, and 
there is currently no consensus on its use. There are a number of small 
randomised control studies trialling use of heparin but no large systematic 
trials. In this report, we collate existing evidence in the form of a review 
article and attempt to extrapolate a consensus of the evidence.

INTRODUCTION: Switzerland's fragmented healthcare system mirrors its federal 
structure and mix of cultures and languages. Although the Swiss have a higher 
life expectancy than most of their neighbours, their healthcare system faces 
similar challenges that call for more integrated care (IC).
AIM/METHOD: This article aims to provide insight into the specificities of and 
latest developments in Switzerland's healthcare system and how they may have 
influenced the development and implementation of IC there.
DESCRIPTION/DISCUSSION: The number of local IC initiatives has been growing 
steadily for 20 years. With a certain lag, various policies supporting IC have 
been established. Among them, a recent democratic debate on the federal 
mandatory health insurance law could either induce a radical move towards 
centralised support for IC or continue to support scattered local IC 
initiatives.
CONCLUSION: In the future, Switzerland's healthcare system will probably 
navigate between local IC initiatives and centralised, federal support for IC 
initiatives. This will be the reflection of a very Swiss way forward in a world 
without clear evidence on whether centralised or decentralised initiatives are 
more successful at developing IC.

Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is caused by mutations in the COL3A1 (collagen 
type III alpha-1) gene, resulting in loss of integrity of arteries and hollow 
organs. Patients are predisposed to dissection, aneurysm, and organ rupture. The 
median life expectancy is ∼51 years. We have described a unique presentation of 
spontaneous compartment syndrome, likely secondary to ischemia reperfusion 
injury, in a 32-year-old man with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The 
compartment syndrome was treated with four-compartment fasciotomy, and 
subsequent evaluation demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm of the tibioperoneal trunk. 
Endovascular intervention and stent graft deployment guided by intravascular 
ultrasound successfully excluded the pseudoaneurysm with three vessel run off 
preserved.

Stability of psychopathy in a prospective longitudinal study: Results from the 
Cambridge Study in delinquent development.

To further understand psychopathy within a Developmental and Life-Course 
Criminology perspective, the current article investigates the stability and 
change in psychopathy from childhood to middle age. The Cambridge Study in 
delinquent development is a prospective longitudinal study of 411 males, where 
psychopathy was coded based on contemporanously collected data from young people 
and in adulthood. Psychopathy in middle age was assessed in a medical interview. 
The findings indicate a high degree of stability of psychopathy across the 
life-course. To explain stability and change, childhood factors that might 
predict this were investigated. Few factors were related to stability and change 
across the life-course. Poor supervision, poor housing, a large family, and 
having a convicted father were associated with any change. A depressed mother 
was associated with a later decrease in psychopathy. This investigation has 
implications not only for the downward extension of psychopathy to childhood, 
but also for the understanding of the development of criminal and antisocial 
behavior.

Background Cardiovascular health (CVH) status is associated with cardiovascular 
diseases (CVD). However, evidence for association of CVH change with risk of CVD 
is scarce. Methods and Results Seven metrics (smoking status, body mass index, 
physical activity, diet, total cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting blood 
glucose) were used to evaluate the CVH status. Having 0 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 to 7 
ideal cardiovascular metrics were categorized as low, moderate, and high CVH 
status, respectively. Change in CVH status was assessed from 2006/2007 to 
2010/2011. We calculated lifetime risk of CVD using a modified Kaplan-Meier 
method, and life expectancy was evaluated via the multistate lifetable method. 
There were 82 349 participants included in our analysis. At 35 years index age, 
the age-adjusted incident rate and lifetime risk of CVD were increased with 
decreasing number of ideal CVH metrics. The direction of change in status of CVH 
was consistently associated with age-adjusted incident rate and lifetime risk of 
CVD. At 35 years index age, improvement from low to moderate (37.6% [95% CI, 
32.8%-42.4%]) or to high status (24.4% [95% CI, 12.7%-36.0%]) had lower lifetime 
risk of CVD compared with consistently low status (44.6% [95% CI, 40.8%-48.5%]). 
The improvement in CVH could prolong the years of life free from CVD. The 
pattern of incident rate and lifetime risk across change in CVH status was 
similar at 45 and 55 years index age. Conclusions Higher number of CVH metrics 
was associated with lower lifetime risk of CVD. The improvement of CVH status 
could reduce the lifetime risk of CVD and prolonged the year of life free from 
CVD.

Evaluation of a Medication Robot Through Participatory Design Methods - A Case 
Study in Denmark.

University of Southern Denmark.

The demographics in Denmark are changing. People's life expectancy is 
increasing, which puts a strain on the home care resources. The aim of this 
article is to get a deeper insight to how a specific medication robot in elders' 
homes can be further developed and modified to create more independence. An 
insight to the end users is created through the use of participatory design 
methods. The methods illuminate the fact that the medication robots design is 
gawky, its alarm volume is too low, the robot itself is too big and that it 
lacks the functionality of being transportable.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of pharmacist interventions in patients with heart 
failure in Thailand.

Arunmanakul P, Chaiyakunapruk N, Phrommintikul A, Ruengorn C, Permsuwan U.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with heart failure (HF) are likely to have multiple 
diseases with complex therapy regimens. Pharmacist intervention in HF treatment 
can reduce all-cause mortality and hospitalization, but the economic outcome is 
not known.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist 
contribution in HF setting compared with usual care.
METHODS: A decision analytical model was developed to estimate the cost and 
outcome from a health care system perspective in Thailand. Clinical inputs were 
obtained from literature review. Pharmacist costs, hospitalization cost for HF, 
risk of hospitalization death, risk of nonhospitalization death, and readmission 
rate were based on data from Thailand. The cost and outcome were discounted at 
3% annually.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated 
and presented for the year 2020. A series of sensitivity analysis was also 
performed.
RESULTS: Pharmacist intervention incurred higher total costs than usual care, 
because total cost of pharmacists was 186,040 THB (5936 USD) whereas usual care 
cost was 151,654 THB (4839 USD). It also provided more quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) than usual care, from 2.4 to 2.8. In addition, patient life years 
(LY) were increasing from 3.3-3.8. This yielded an ICER of 77,398 THB/LY (2467 
USD/LY) or 103,037 THB/QALYs (3288 USD/QALYs). This ICER is considered to be 
cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay level of 160,000 THB/QALY (5191.87 
USD).
CONCLUSION: At this current situation in Thailand, pharmacists may represent 
good value for the nation's limited health care resources. The information 
should be used in national policies to plan for pharmacist work force 
implementation and production line in the near future.

HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment remains a challenge even in the era of 
antiretroviral therapy (ART). Over 90% of people living with HIV are in low- and 
middle-income countries. Hence, it is not surprising that such countries bear a 
considerable burden of comorbidities like HIV-associated neurocognitive 
impairment despite an overall increase in life expectancy. The literature 
suggests differences in patient characteristics, clinical profile, prevalent HIV 
subtypes, treatment choices, pharmacogenetics, and socioeconomic factors between 
low- and middle-income countries compared with high-income countries. Therefore, 
we aimed to evaluate the effect of ART on neurocognitive outcomes in low- and 
middle-income countries. A comprehensive search of five databases (PubMed, 
CINAHL, CENTRAL, PsychInfo, Google scholar) for studies published between 1996 
to 2020 was performed to identify studies that reported neurocognitive outcomes 
in ART-treated and ART naïve HIV positive individuals. Two independent reviewers 
conducted study screening, data extraction, and evaluation of the risk of bias. 
Pooled effect size estimates (Hedges' g) and 95% CI were computed using 
random-effects models. Sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, meta-regression, 
and evaluation of publication bias were also conducted. Forty studies (24 
cross-sectional, 13 longitudinal studies, and two randomized controlled trials) 
contributed to a series of meta-analyses. We found significant small to moderate 
effects of antiretroviral therapy for global cognition (Hedges' g 
observed = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.44; k = 25; p = 0.0003; I2 = 92.1%; tau = 0.32; 
Q = 305.1), executive function (Hedges' g = 0.24, 95%CI: 0.02,0.46; p-0.04; 
k = 8; I2 = 37.5%; tau = 0.23; Q = 11.2), and speed of information processing 
(Hedges' g = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.45; k = 9; p = 0.02; I2 = 86.4%; tau = 0.21; 
Q = 58.9). We found no significant ART effect on attention-working memory, 
learning and memory, motor function, and verbal fluency. No significant effect 
was seen with the duration of therapy, efavirenz use, and Central Penetrating 
Effectiveness (CPE) of antiretroviral therapy. Subgroup analyses identified 
study design (between-group and within-group; cross-sectional and longitudinal) 
and normative scores as significant sources of heterogeneity. Meta-regression 
analysis indicated that nadir CD4 modified the magnitude of ART's effect on 
cognitive outcomes. Age, gender, and country income-group were not significant 
moderators. Our findings provide systematic evidence that antiretroviral therapy 
improves neurocognitive outcomes in the domains of global cognition, executive 
function and speed of information processing, of people living with HIV in low- 
and middle-income countries, especially those with advanced immunosuppression. 
However, these findings are not definitive as they are limited by the 
probability of publication bias, high heterogeneity, and exclusion of 
significant confounders. Prospero registration number: CRD42020203791.
