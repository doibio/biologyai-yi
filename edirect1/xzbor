delayed, response to a course of teriparatide treatment for 18 months but 
subsequently, and while on alendronate, sustained an insufficiency fracture at 
the left ischiopubic ramus. A second trial of teriparatide treatment resulted in 
further remarkable increase in total hip and femoral neck bone mineral density. 
We present the patient's response to sequential treatment during an 8-year 
follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Teriparatide could represent an alternative treatment for adults 
with TBD especially when long-term, sequential treatment is needed. Although 
there are limited data concerning retreatment, in selected cases, this might be 
considered.

While patients with sickle cell disease currently constitute a very small 
minority of the US dialysis population (0.1%), there is anticipated growth of 
this group as the life expectancy of those with sickle cell disease (SCD) 
increases. SCD patients suffer a high burden of morbidity, which is enhanced by 
the presence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In this review, we discuss the 
pathophysiology of SCD and the basic tenets of its management with focus on the 
dialysis patient with SCD. Anemia in dialysis patients with SCD is a unique 
challenge. The hemoglobin target in SCD dialysis patients with ESRD should not 
exceed 10 g/dl. SCD patients, and particularly those on dialysis, are likely to 
be poorly responsive to erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy and might 
be at increased risk for vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) with ESA. Iron chelation 
and hydroyxurea therapy require special considerations and modifications in 
dialysis patients with SCD. There are theoretical advantages to both 
hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) in SCD patients. With HD, there 
is a secure vascular access available for both standard and exchange blood 
transfusion in patients who need them. With PD, the absence of an acute rise in 
hematocrit with ultrafiltration (UF) might offer lower risk of VOC. During VOC, 
reduction in UF goals should be considered but administration of intravenous 
fluids should be reserved only for clear cases of volume depletion. Finally, 
renal transplantation appears to confer a survival advantage to dialysis in SCD 
patients and should be pursued when possible.

A moral liver allocation policy must be fair. We considered a 2-step, 
2-principle allocation system called "age mapping." Its first principle, equal 
opportunity, ensures that candidates of all ages have an equal chance of getting 
an organ. Its second principle, prudential lifespan equity, allocates younger 
donor grafts to younger candidates and older donors to older candidates in order 
to increase the likelihood that all recipients achieve a "full lifespan." Data 
from 2476 candidates and 1371 consecutive adult liver transplantations (from 
1999 to 2012) were used to determine whether age mapping can reduce the gap in 
years of life lost (YLL) between younger and older recipients. A parametric 
Weibull prognostic model was developed to estimate total life expectancy after 
transplantation using survival of the general population matched by sex and age 
as a reference. Life expectancy from birth was calculated by adding age at 
transplant and total life expectancy after transplantation. In multivariate 
analysis, recipient age, hepatitis C virus status, Model for End-Stage Liver 
Disease score at transplant of >30, and donor age were significantly related to 
prognosis after surgery (P < 0.05). The mean (and standard deviation) number of 
years of life from birth, calculated from the current allocation model, for 
various age groups were: recipients 18-47 years (n = 340) = 65.2 (3.3); 48-55 
years (n = 387) = 72.7 (2.1); 56-61 years (n = 372) = 74.7 (1.7) and for 
recipients >61 years (n = 272) = 77.4 (1.4). The total number of YLL equaled 523 
years. Redistributing liver grafts, using an age mapping algorithm, reduces the 
lifespan gap between younger and older candidates by 33% (from 12.3% to 8.3%) 
and achieves a 14% overall reduction of YLL (73 years) compared to baseline 
liver distribution. In conclusion, deliberately incorporating age into an 
allocation algorithm promotes fairness and increases efficiency.

compared to the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in elderly 
Japanese adults.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of severe disease worldwide, 
particularly in the elderly population. Due to increasing life expectancy in 
Japan and elsewhere, an effective vaccine which offers the possibility of 
prolonged protection is required. Protein conjugated pneumococcal vaccines, 
which have the ability to boost immunity (immunologic memory) on natural 
exposure or revaccination, may meet these requirements. An unconjugated 
23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) has been available for 
decades; however data on protection against pneumonia are inconsistent. For the 
first time, a randomized, modified double-blind trial comparing the 13-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) with PPSV23 was conducted in PPSV23-naive 
adults ≥65 years of age in Japan. This study showed that statistically 
significantly greater functional antibody responses as measured by 
opsonophagocytic assays 1 month after vaccination were elicited in the PCV13 
group (n = 366) compared with the PPSV23 group (n = 367) for 9 of the 
12 serotypes in common with both vaccines and for serotype 6A, unique to PCV13. 
Local reactions collected within 14 days of vaccination were more frequent in 
the PCV13 (57.5%, 211/367) than PPSV23 (44.9%, 166/370) group, although severity 
was generally mild to moderate; systemic and adverse events were similar across 
groups. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Consistent with 
global studies comparing PCV13 with PPSV23, PCV13 use in Japanese subjects was 
safe and well-tolerated and elicited greater functional immune responses than 
PPSV23 for the majority of PCV13-serotypes. PCV13 has the potential to protect 
against pneumococcal disease in Japanese elderly adults.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate health benefits and incremental cost-effectiveness of 
human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of pre-adolescent boys and girls compared 
with girls alone for preventing cervical cancer and genital warts.
DESIGN: Model-based economic evaluation.
SETTING: Southern Vietnam.
POPULATION: Males and females aged ≥9 years.
METHODS: We simulated dynamic HPV transmission to estimate cervical cancer and 
genital warts cases. Models were calibrated to epidemiological data from south 
Vietnam.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs): cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: Vaccinating girls alone was associated with reductions in lifetime 
cervical cancer risk ranging from 20 to 56.9% as coverage varied from 25 to 90%. 
Adding boys to the vaccination programme yielded marginal incremental benefits 
(≤3.6% higher absolute cervical cancer risk reduction), compared with 
vaccinating girls alone at all coverages. At ≤25 international dollars (I$) per 
vaccinated adolescent (I$5 per dose), HPV vaccination of boys was below the 
threshold of Vietnam's per-capita GDP (I$2800), with ICERs ranging from I$734 
per QALY at 25% coverage to I$2064 per QALY for 90% coverage. Including health 
benefits from averting genital warts yielded more favourable ICERs, and 
vaccination of boys at I$10/dose became cost-effective at or below 75% coverage. 
Using a lower cost-effectiveness threshold of 50% of Vietnam's GDP (I$1400), 
vaccinating boys was no longer attractive at costs above I$5 per dose regardless 
of coverage.
CONCLUSION: Vaccination of boys may be cost-effective at low vaccine costs, but 
provides little benefit over vaccinating girls only. Focusing on achieving high 
vaccine coverage of girls may be more efficient for southern Vietnam and similar 
low-resource settings.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Limited cervical cancer reduction from including boys in HPV 
vaccination of girls in low-resource settings.

Surgical and nonsurgical management of patent ductus arteriosus in cats: 28 
cases (1991-2012).

Hutton JE, Steffey MA, Runge JJ, McClaran JK, Silverman SJ, Kass PH.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical features and outcome of cats treated for 
patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with attenuation (extravascular or intravascular) 
versus medical treatment only.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
ANIMALS: 28 client-owned cats with congenital PDA.
PROCEDURES: Medical records for cats with PDA diagnosed by means of 
echocardiography were reviewed. Data retrieved included signalment; history; 
clinical signs; results of physical examination, ECG, echocardiography, and 
thoracic radiography; response to medical management if attempted; type of 
attenuation procedure if attempted (surgical or intravascular); procedural 
details; intraoperative and postoperative (≤ 2 weeks) complications; and 
long-term (> 2 weeks) complications. Follow-up was obtained from medical records 
and via telephone interviews.
RESULTS: All 28 cats were referred for evaluation of a cardiac murmur, but 17 of 
26 (65%) for which initial clinical signs were available did not have overt 
signs at initial evaluation. Multiple congenital cardiac defects were identified 
in 6 of 23 (26%) cats. Seventeen of 26 (65%) cats were documented as treated 
with 1 or more vascular attenuation procedures; vascular attenuation was not 
attempted in 11 cats receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or 
loop diuretic (n = 2) or no medical treatment (9). Surgical ligation was 
successful in 11 of 15 cats, and coil embolization was successful in 2 cats. 
Procedural or postoperative complications included death (n = 2), left-sided 
laryngeal paralysis (2), voice change (1), fever (1), hemorrhage (4), and 
chylothorax (1). Long-term follow-up was available for 16 of 28 (57%) cats. 
Three of 4 cats that did not undergo surgical attenuation died of 
cardiac-related disease.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that PDA occurs rarely in 
cats, and clinical signs and diagnostic findings were consistent with those 
previously reported for dogs. Surgical versus nonsurgical treatment did not 
result in a significant difference in life expectancy in this small cohort. 
Evaluation of laryngeal function after surgical ligation is recommended. Further 
study of the outcome associated with various treatment options in a larger 
population of patients is recommended.

Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.

OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of eltrombopag in the 
treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related thrombocytopenia.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed on the basis of the clinical trials 
ENABLE 1 and ENABLE 2. Three alternatives were considered: scenario 1; treatment 
with eltrombopag in both the enabling phase and during antiviral therapy, as in 
the ENABLE trial design; scenario 2; no eltrombopag treatment and no antiviral 
therapy; scenario 3; no eltrombopag treatment and subsequent administration of a 
reduced dose of peg-IFN.
RESULTS: Base case results demonstrate that scenario 1 is associated with a cost 
per QALY of €30,020.94 in comparison with scenario 2. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio reaches a value of €32,752.44 per QALY when scenario 1 
is compared with scenario 3.
CONCLUSION: The use of eltrombopag in HCV patients with thrombocytopenia is 
cost-effective as it leads to a reduction in disease progression and thus a drop 
in the number of patients with advanced liver disease.

Correlation Between Standard Upper Extremity Impairment Measures and 
Activity-based Function Testing in Upper Extremity Cerebral Palsy.

Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.

BACKGROUND: Although the treatment of cerebral palsy should be based on 
improving function as assessed by measures of impairment, activity, and 
participation, the standard indications for surgical treatment of upper 
extremity cerebral palsy (UECP) are impairment measures, primarily active and 
passive range of motion (ROM). Recently, validated activity measures have been 
developed for children with UECP. The purposes of this study were to determine 
the relationship between impairment and activity measures in this population, 
and whether measures of activity correlate with each other.
METHODS: A total of 37 children, ages 5 to 16 years, who met standard ROM 
surgical indications for UECP were evaluated with the impairment measures of 
active and passive ROM and stereognosis, as well as 3 activity measures 
[Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA), Box and Blocks test, and the Shriners 
Hospitals Upper Extremity Evaluation Dynamic Positional Analyses (SHUEE DPA)]. 
Impairment measures were correlated with activity measures using Spearman rank 
correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: Impairment measures showed inconsistent correlation with activity 
measures. Of the 12 comparisons, only 4 correlated: active forearm supination 
(ρ=0.47, P=0.003), wrist extension (ρ=0.55, P=0.001), and stereognosis scores 
(ρ=0.54, P=0.001) were correlated with AHA; and wrist extension was correlated 
with the SHUEE DPA (ρ=0.41, P=0.01). When the results of activity tests were 
compared, the AHA was correlated with the Box and Blocks tests (ρ=0.63, 
P<0.001), and the SHUEE DPA and Box and Blocks tests were correlated with each 
other (ρ=0.35, P=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The goal of surgery in UECP is to improve the child's ability to 
perform activities, and ultimately to participate in life situations. Impairment 
measures, such as ROM, were inconsistently correlated with validated measures of 
activity. Some activity measures correlated with each other, although they did 
not correlate with the same impairment measures. We conclude that impairment 
measures, including ROM, do not consistently predict functional dynamic ROM used 
to perform activities for children with UECP. Activity limitation measures may 
provide more appropriate indicators than impairment measures for upper extremity 
surgery for this population.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II-diagnostic.

Lifestyle-Related Factors Contributing to Decline in Knee Extension Strength 
among Elderly Women: A Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Cohort Study.

Morioka-machi, Obu-shi, Aichi, Japan.

This cross-sectional and 4-year longitudinal cohort study aimed to clarify how 
various lifestyle-related variables affect knee extension strength in elderly 
Japanese women. The participants were community-dwelling women (n = 575) living 
in the Itabashi Ward of Tokyo, Japan aged 75-85 years at baseline (in 2008) who 
returned for a follow-up examination 4 years later (in 2012). Maximum isometric 
knee extension strength in the dominant leg was measured during comprehensive 
medical check-ups at baseline and follow-up. Interviews with participants 
included questions on their history of 11 diseases and lifestyle-related factors 
such as physical activity as well as dietary, smoking, and drinking habits. 
Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses yielded inconsistent results regarding 
the associations between lifestyle-related factors and knee extension strength. 
While going out more frequently and regular physical exercise positively 
affected baseline knee extension strength, they did not affect knee extension 
strength in the longitudinal analysis. The longitudinal analysis revealed that 
more frequent intake of soy products or green and yellow vegetables at baseline 
decreased age-related knee extension strength decline. The inconsistent results 
from the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses indicate that conducting both 
types of analyses is crucial for researching this type of subject. The present 
study demonstrates that the age-related decline in muscle strength is lower in 
those who frequently eat soy products or green and yellow vegetables. Thus, 
recommending higher intake of soy products, and green and yellow vegetables for 
the elderly might help maintain their muscle health.

The purpose of making a "biobetter" biologic is to improve on the salient 
characteristics of a known biologic for which there is, minimally, clinical 
proof of concept or, maximally, marketed product data. There already are several 
examples in which second-generation or biobetter biologics have been generated 
by improving the pharmacokinetic properties of an innovative drug, including 
Neulasta(®) [a PEGylated, longer-half-life version of Neupogen(®) (filgrastim)] 
and Aranesp(®) [a longer-half-life version of Epogen(®) (epoetin-α)]. This 
review describes the use of protein fusion technologies such as Fc fusion 
proteins, fusion to human serum albumin, fusion to carboxy-terminal peptide, and 
other polypeptide fusion approaches to make biobetter drugs with more desirable 
pharmacokinetic profiles.

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is 
occurring more frequently in Crohn's disease patients on immunosuppressive 
medications, especially corticosteroids. Considering its excess mortality and 
the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis in reducing P. jiroveci pneumonia in acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome, there is debate without consensus on the need for 
chemoprophylaxis in Crohn's disease patients on corticosteroids.
AIMS: We sought to address this debate using insights from simulation modeling.
METHODS: We used a Markov microsimulation model to simulate the natural history 
of Crohn's disease in 1 million virtual patients receiving appropriate care and 
who faced P. jiroveci pneumonia risks that varied with corticosteroid use. We 
examined several chemoprophylaxis strategies and compared their population-level 
economic and clinical impact using various indices including costs, 
quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. We 
also performed several nested probabilistic sensitivity analyses to estimate the 
health and economic impact of chemoprophylaxis in patients on triple 
immunosuppressive therapy.
RESULTS: At the current PJP incidence, no PJP chemoprophylaxis was the preferred 
strategy from a population perspective. Considered chemoprophylactic strategies 
led to higher average costs and fewer P. jiroveci pneumonia cases. However, they 
also led to lower average quality-adjusted life expectancy and were thus 
dominated. Nevertheless, these alternative strategies became preferred with 
progressively higher risks of P. jiroveci pneumonia. Our results also suggest 
that PJP chemoprophylaxis may be cost-effective in patients on triple 
immunosuppressive therapy.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support a case-by-case consideration of P. jiroveci 
pneumonia chemoprophylaxis in Crohn's disease patients receiving 
corticosteroids.

Whether income inequality is related to population health is still open to 
debate. We aimed to critically assess the relationship between income inequality 
and mortality in 43 European countries using comparable data between 1987 and 
2008, controlling for time-invariant and time-variant country-level confounding 
factors. Annual data on income inequality, expressed as Gini index based on net 
household income, were extracted from the Standardizing the World Income 
Inequality Database. Data on life expectancy at birth and age-standardized 
mortality by cause of death were obtained from the Human Lifetable Database and 
the World Health Organization European Health for All Database. Data on infant 
mortality were obtained from the United Nations World Population Prospects 
Database. The relationships between income inequality and mortality indicators 
were studied using country fixed effects models, adjusted for time trends and 
country characteristics. Significant associations between income inequality and 
many mortality indicators were found in pooled cross-sectional regressions, 
indicating higher mortality in countries with larger income inequalities. Once 
the country fixed effects were added, all associations between income inequality 
and mortality indicators became insignificant, except for mortality from 
external causes and homicide among men, and cancers among women. The significant 
results for homicide and cancers disappeared after further adjustment for 
indicators of democracy, education, transition to national independence, armed 
conflicts, and economic freedom. Cross-sectional associations between income 
inequality and mortality seem to reflect the confounding effects of other 
country characteristics. In a European context, national levels of income 
inequality do not have an independent effect on mortality.

Application of a QMRA Framework to Inform Selection of Drinking Water 
Interventions in the Developing Context.

Petterson SR.

The aim of this study was to develop a modified quantitative microbial risk 
assessment (QMRA) framework that could be applied as a decision support tool to 
choose between alternative drinking water interventions in the developing 
context. The impact of different household water treatment (HWT) interventions 
on the overall incidence of diarrheal disease and disability adjusted life years 
(DALYs) was estimated, without relying on source water pathogen concentration as 
the starting point for the analysis. A framework was developed and a software 
tool constructed and then implemented for an illustrative case study for Nepal 
based on published scientific data. Coagulation combined with free chlorine 
disinfection provided the greatest estimated health gains in the short term; 
however, when long-term compliance was incorporated into the calculations, the 
preferred intervention was porous ceramic filtration. The model demonstrates how 
the QMRA framework can be used to integrate evidence from different studies to 
inform management decisions, and in particular to prioritize the next best 
intervention with respect to estimated reduction in diarrheal incidence. This 
study only considered HWT interventions; it is recognized that a systematic 
consideration of sanitation, recreation, and drinking water pathways is 
important for effective management of waterborne transmission of pathogens, and 
the approach could be expanded to consider the broader water-related context.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by a 
loss of tolerance toward the hepatocellular epithelium. Liver transplantation 
(LT) represents the ultimate therapeutic option for a fulminant course or 
end-stage liver disease. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical, 
serological, and genetic features of remission, relapse, and overall and LT-free 
survival. Between 2000 and 2014, 354 AIH patients from Hannover Medical School 
were included. Clinical, laboratory, and histological reports were analyzed. 
DRB1 allele analyses were performed in 264 AIH and 399 non-AIH patients. Cox's 
regression analysis was performed to identify factors significantly associated 
with survival. Patients diagnosed in childhood were at higher risk for relapses 
(P=0.003), requirement for LTs (P=0.014, log rank), and had a reduced life 
expectancy (P<0.001, log rank). Detection of soluble liver antigen/liver 
pancreas antigen (SLA/LP) antibodies was significantly associated with reduced 
overall and LT-free survival (P=0.037; P=0.021). Cirrhosis, which was evident in 
25% at first diagnosis, was found to be a predictor of poor survival and 
requirement for LT (P=0.003; P=0.009). DRB1*04:01-positive phenotype was 
associated with a higher rate of complete remissions and with a lower frequency 
of cirrhosis and LTs. There were no significant differences for subsequent 
relapses or survival in patients achieving either partial or complete remission.
CONCLUSION: Diagnosis<18 years, histological cirrhosis at first diagnosis and 
SLA/LP antibodies are major risk factors for a poor short- and long-term 
outcome. These patients are in need of high surveillance. Separating patients 
with positive SLA/LP antibodies into a third group may be reconsidered. 
DRB1*04:01 positivity has been identified in association with a favorable 
clinical outcome.

The academic geriatrics community has provided outstanding leadership in 
addressing frailty and complexity in older adults, but a minority of older 
adults are frail. Although resources to treat older adults are limited, and it 
is appropriate to focus clinical efforts on those with frailty and 
multimorbidity, there is also important expertise that can be brought to bear on 
the health of ALL older adults. A review of the literature suggests that 
attention to healthy or successful aging has failed to keep pace with the focus 
on frailty. By providing leadership to promote successful aging, the quality of 
life of older adults across the spectrum can be improved and transitions to 
frailty reduced. The template that leaders have established in understanding 
frailty-defining and operationalizing it, understanding outcomes, identifying 
pathophysiology-can be used as an approach to successful aging. Several 
community-based programs have been successful in promoting successful aging. 
These are potentially highly scalable and could have a substantial effect on the 
aging population, but their essential components need to be better understood. 
The geriatrics community is uniquely positioned to take on this role. This is a 
critical time to work together to make the lives of all older adults as healthy 
and fulfilling as possible.

Quality of life of craniopharyngioma patients can be severely impaired by 
derangement of hypothalamic function. A classification, taking into account 
preoperative hypothalamic damage, evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
and correlating it with postoperative weight change is still missing in the 
literature. The aim of our study is to identify objective radiological criteria 
as preoperative prognostic factors for hypothalamic damage. Pre- and 
post-operative MRI and clinical data of 47 patients, treated at our Institution 
for craniopharyngioma, were retrospectively analyzed, based on radiological 
variables, identified as prognostic factor for hypothalamic involvement. Main 
factors associated with postoperative obesity were hypothalamic hyperintensity 
in T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging (p < 0.033), mammillary body involvement according 
to Müller classification (p < 0.020), unidentifiable pituitary stalk (p < 
0.001), dislocated chiasm (p < 0.038), either not visible infundibular recess (p 
< 0.019) or unrecognizable supra-optic recess (p < 0.004), and retrochiasmatic 
tumor extension (p < 0.019). Accordingly, postoperative hypothalamic syndrome 
was associated with peritumoral edema in T2-weighted/FLAIR images (p < 0.003), 
unidentifiable hypothalamus (p < 0.024), hypothalamic compression (p < 0.006), 
fornix displacement (p < 0.032), and unrecognizable supra-optic recess (p < 
0.031). Ultimately, variables identified as predictive factors of postoperative 
hypothalamic syndrome were the degree of hypothalamic involvement according to 
the classification described by Sainte-Rose and Puget (p < 0.002; grade 0 vs 2 p 
< 0.001), Van Gompel (p < 0.002; grade 0 vs 1, p < 0.027; and grade 0 vs 2, p < 
0.002), and Muller (p < 0.006; grade 0 vs 1, p < 0.05; and grade 0 vs 2, p < 
0.004). The identification of these predictive factors will help to define and 
score the preoperative hypothalamic involvement in craniopharyngioma patients.

BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle strength, velocity, and power are markedly reduced 
in patients with heart failure, which contributes to their impaired exercise 
capacity and lower quality of life. This muscle dysfunction may be partially 
because of decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. We therefore sought to 
determine whether ingestion of inorganic nitrate (NO3 (-)) would increase NO 
production and improve muscle function in patients with heart failure because of 
systolic dysfunction.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized 
crossover design, we determined the effects of dietary NO3 (-) in 9 patients 
with heart failure. After fasting overnight, subjects drank beetroot juice 
containing or devoid of 11.2 mmol of NO3 (-). Two hours later, muscle function 
was assessed using isokinetic dynamometry. Dietary NO3 (-) increased 
(P<0.05-0.001) breath NO by 35% to 50%. This was accompanied by 9% (P=0.07) and 
11% (P<0.05) increases in peak knee extensor power at the 2 highest movement 
velocities tested (ie, 4.71 and 6.28 rad/s). Maximal power (calculated by 
fitting peak power data with a parabola) was therefore greater (ie, 4.74±0.41 
versus 4.20±0.33 W/kg; P<0.05) after dietary NO3 (-) intake. Calculated maximal 
velocity of knee extension was also higher after NO3 (-) ingestion (ie, 
12.48±0.95 versus 11.11±0.53 rad/s; P<0.05). Blood pressure was unchanged, and 
no adverse clinical events occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, acute dietary NO3 (-) intake was well 
tolerated and enhanced NO bioavailability and muscle power in patients with 
systolic heart failure. Larger-scale studies should be conducted to determine 
whether the latter translates into an improved quality of life in this 
population.

BACKGROUND: Cisplatin and gemcitabine is the standard first-line chemotherapy 
regimen for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer; expression of VEGF and 
its receptors is associated with adverse outcomes. We aimed to assess the effect 
of the addition of cediranib (an oral inhibitor of VEGF receptor 1, 2, and 3) to 
cisplatin and gemcitabine on progression-free survival.
METHODS: In this multicentre, placebo-controlled, randomised phase 2 study, we 
recruited patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed or 
cytologically confirmed advanced biliary tract cancer from hepatobiliary 
oncology referral centres in the UK. Patients were eligible if they had an ECOG 
performance status of 0-1 and an estimated life expectancy of longer than 3 
months. Patients were given first-line cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy 
(25 mg/m(2) cisplatin and 1000 mg/m(2) gemcitabine [on days 1 and 8 every 21 
days, for up to eight cycles]) with either 20 mg oral cediranib or placebo once 
a day until disease progression. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) with a 
minimisation algorithm, incorporating the stratification factors: extent of 
disease, primary disease site, previous treatment, ECOG performance status, and 
centre. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the 
intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT00939848, and was closed on Sept 30, 2014; results of the final 
analysis for the primary endpoint are presented.
FINDINGS: Between April 5, 2011, and Sept 28, 2012, we enrolled 124 patients (62 
in each group). With a median follow-up of 12·2 months (IQR 7·3-18·5), median 
progression-free survival was 8·0 months (95% CI 6·5-9·3) in the cediranib group 
and 7·4 months (5·7-8·5) in the placebo group (HR 0·93, 80% CI 0·74-1·19, 95% CI 
0·65-1·35; p=0·72). Patients who received cediranib had more grade 3-4 toxic 
effects than did patients who received placebo: hypertension (23 [37%] vs 13 
[21%]; p=0·05), diarrhoea (eight [13%] vs two [3%]; p=0·05); platelet count 
decreased (ten [16%] vs four [6%]; p=0·09), white blood cell decreased (15 [24%] 
vs seven [11%]; p=0·06) and fatigue (16 [24%] vs seven [11%]; p=0·04).
INTERPRETATION: Cediranib did not improve the progression-free survival of 
patients with advanced biliary tract cancer in combination with cisplatin and 
gemcitabine, which remains the standard of care. Although patients in the 
cediranib group had more adverse events, we recorded no unexpected toxic 
effects. The role of VEGF inhibition in addition to chemotherapy for patients 
with advanced biliary tract cancer remains investigational.

OBJECTIVES: Health technology reassessment and disinvestment can be difficult 
due to uncertainties regarding available evidence. Pathology testing to 
investigate cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency is a strong case in point. We 
conducted a 3-month economic evaluation of five strategies for diagnosing and 
treating cobalamin deficiency in adult patients hypothetically presenting with 
new unexplained fatigue in the primary care setting. The first consultation per 
patient was considered. Screening tests other than serum cobalamin were not 
included.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken using a decision tree to 
represent the diagnostic / treatment pathways, with relevant cost and utility 
scores assigned to different stages in the evaluation process. Input parameter 
values were estimated from published evidence, supplemented by expert opinion, 
with sensitivity analysis undertaken to represent parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: Ordering serum vitamin B12 to assess cobalamin deficiency among 
patients with unexplained fatigue was not cost-effective in any patient 
population, irrespective of pretest prevalence of this deficiency. For patients 
with a pretest prevalence above 1 percent, treating all with oral vitamin B12 
supplements without testing was most cost-effective, whereas watchful waiting 
with symptoms monitoring was most cost-effective for patients with lower pretest 
prevalence probabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Substantial evidence gaps exist for parameter estimation: 
questionable cobalamin deficiency levels in the fatigued; debatable treatment 
methods; unknown natural history of the condition. Despite this, we reveal a 
robust path for disinvestment decision making in the face of a paradox between 
the evidence required to inform disinvestment compared with its paucity in 
informing initial funding decisions.

INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 10-22% of the UK 
population, with England's annual National Health Service (NHS) costs amounting 
to more than £200 million. Abdominal pain, bloating and altered bowel habit 
affect quality of life, social functioning and time off work. Current treatment 
relies on a positive diagnosis, reassurance, lifestyle advice and drug 
therapies, but many people suffer ongoing symptoms. Cognitive behaviour therapy 
(CBT) and self-management can be helpful, but availability is limited.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: To determine the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of 
therapist delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (TCBT) and web-based CBT 
self-management (WBCBT) in IBS, 495 participants with refractory IBS will be 
randomised to TCBT plus treatment as usual (TAU); WBCBT plus TAU; or TAU alone. 
The two CBT programmes have similar content. However, TCBT consists of six, 
60 min telephone CBT sessions with a therapist over 9 weeks, at home, and two 
'booster' 1 hour follow-up phone calls at 4 and 8 months (8 h therapist contact 
time). WBCBT consists of access to a previously developed and piloted WBCBT 
management programme (Regul8) and three 30 min therapist telephone sessions over 
9 weeks, at home, and two 'booster' 30 min follow-up phone calls at 4 and 
8 months (2½ h therapist contact time). Clinical effectiveness will be assessed 
by examining the difference between arms in the IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS 
SSS) and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WASAS) at 12 months from 
randomisation. Cost-effectiveness will combine measures of resource use with the 
IBS SSS at 12 months and quality-adjusted life years.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has full ethical approval. It will be 
disseminated via peer reviewed publications and conference presentations. The 
results will enable clinicians, patients and health service planners to make 
informed decisions regarding the management of IBS with CBT.

Cost-effectiveness of Adolescent Bariatric Surgery.

BACKGROUND:  The current estimates of the prevalence of adolescent morbid 
obesity and severe morbid obesity are about 21% and 6.6%, respectively. Obesity, 
if left untreated, may result in a variety of comorbid conditions and earlier 
mortality. Adolescent bariatric surgery is an effective, but expensive means to 
ameliorate these conditions and the risk of earlier mortality. We aimed to 
develop a model to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of bariatric 
surgery.
METHODS: All adolescents who participated in our bariatric surgery 
multidisciplinary program from January 2010 to December 2013 were included if 
they had at least 12 months follow-up after their surgery. Intervention costs 
included all operative as well as preoperative and 12-month postoperative care. 
We used the US Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) to estimate the 
association between reductions in BMI after surgery with future savings from 
reduced medical care use and with increased health-related quality of life 
(HRQL). We linked BMI with life expectancy using data from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. A Markov cohort model was then used to project 
health care-related costs (2013 US$), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
over time starting at age 18. Incremental costs per QALY of surgery vs. no 
surgery from a health care system perspective were then estimated.
RESULTS:  At one year follow-up, mean weight loss was 37.5 (std. = 13.5) kg and 
the corresponding BMI was 35.4 (reduction of 13.2, p<0.01). Mean total 
intervention costs/person were $25,854 (std. = 2,044). A unit change in BMI was 
associated with future medical care savings of $157/year (p<0.01) and with an 
increase in HRQL of 0.004 (p<0.01) and life expectancy. At a threshold of a 
100,000/QALY, bariatric surgery was not cost-effective in the first three years, 
but became cost-effective after that ($80,065/QALY in year four and $36,570/QALY 
in year seven). 
CONCLUSION:  Our results suggest that bariatric surgery among adolescents may be 
cost-effective when evaluated over a long period of time. Future studies on a 
large scale are needed to show a continued improvement in QALYs and to evaluate 
earlier cost-effectiveness of the procedure.
