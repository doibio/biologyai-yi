OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of universal antenatal human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing in Hong Kong.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis from the health care provider's perspective.
SETTING: Public antenatal clinics in Hong Kong.
PARTICIPANTS: All pregnant women who gave birth in Hong Kong during the 
inclusive period 1 September 2001 and 31 December 2004.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoints were (i) the cost per HIV infection 
avoided and (ii) the cost per life-year gained.
RESULTS: From 2001 to 2004, a total of 160,878 deliveries were recorded in Hong 
Kong; and 75% of the corresponding women had HIV testing before delivery. In 
all, 28 women tested HIV-positive and gave birth to 15 babies, one of which was 
HIV-positive. The mother of the infected baby presented late in labour, without 
her HIV status being diagnosed and thus missed the opportunity for prompt 
intervention. Assuming a natural transmission rate of 25%, it was estimated that 
six out of seven anticipated HIV infections among the newborns had been avoided. 
The cost for implementation of the programme for the first 3 years was HKD12 227 
988. Hence, the average costs per HIV infection averted and per discounted 
life-year gained were HKD2 037 998 and HKD79 099, respectively. Sensitivity 
analysis showed that both the coverage and the loss-to-follow-up rate were the 
major determinants of the cost-effectiveness of the universal antenatal testing 
programme in Hong Kong.
CONCLUSION: The universal antenatal testing programme in Hong Kong is largely 
efficient. In view of the low prevalence of HIV infection, high rates of HIV 
testing and uptake of antiretroviral prophylaxis are crucial to the success of 
the programme.

AIMS: To determine the cost-effectiveness of four urogynaecological treatments.
MATERIALS: Two prospective trials were performed in which 205 women with urinary 
incontinence underwent urogynaecological treatments. The cost incurred and the 
improvement in quality of life (QOL) as a result of treatment was calculated as 
cost/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and then ranked in order of 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: The Nurse Continence Advisor (NCA) group (N = 73) and the 
Urogynaecologist (UG) group (N = 72) both had significant improvements in leaks 
per week and incontinence score. QOL improvement was also similar (1.5% vs 
1.2%). The economic data found a similar improvement in pad usage costs ($A2.90 
vs $A3.52). The clinician costs were significantly lower for the NCA group 
($A60.00 vs $A105.00) (P < 0.0001). The cost per QALY was significantly lower 
for the NCA group ($A28,009 vs $A35,312) (P = 0.03). Both groups had significant 
improvements in pad testing and leaks per week. The cure/improvement rates were 
also similar at three months (100% vs 89%). There was no significant difference 
in the improvement in QOL between the laparoscopic colposuspension (LC) and open 
colposuspension (OC) groups (2.09% vs 1.54%). The economic data found a similar 
improvement in pad usage costs ($A11.74 vs $A16.17). The theatre costs were 
significantly higher for the LC group ($A403.45 vs $A266.94) (P < 0.0001), 
however the overall costs were significantly lower ($A4,668 vs $A6,124) (P < 
0.0001). The cost/QALY was lower for the LC group ($A63,980 vs $A134,069), 
however this did not reach significance.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, on comparison of the cost/QALY's, conservative treatment 
of urinary incontinence by a NCA was the most cost-effective.

University, 106, Taipei, Taiwan.

Paecilomyces javanicus is an entomopathogenic fungus of coleopteran and 
lepidopteran insects. Here we report on cloning, characterization, and 
expression patterns of a chitinase from P. javanicus. A strong chitinase 
activity was detected in P. javanicus cultures added to chitin. The full-length 
cDNA, designated PjChi-1, was cloned from mycelia by using both degenerate 
primer/reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification 
and 5'-/3'-RACE extension. The 1.18-kb cDNA gene contains a 1035-bp open reading 
frame and encodes a 345-amino acid polypeptide with a deduced molecular mass of 
37 kDa. A conserved motif for chitinase activity -F82DGIDIDWE90- was present in 
deduced amino acid sequence. Both RT-PCR and Northern analysis revealed that the 
expression of the PjChi gene was constitutive at low level, but enhanced to high 
level when chitin was the substrate. Fungal inhibitory assay showed that PjChi-1 
inhibited the growth of phytopathogenic fungi such as Sclerotium rolfsii, 
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Aspergillus nidulans, and Rhizoctonia solani.

PURPOSE: The effect of innovative medicines and surgical interventions on the 
decline of (cardiovascular) mortality is often called into question. The 
increase in general economic prosperity is often seen as the main reason for the 
continuous increase in life expectancy. The purpose of this study is to 
investigate the extent to which mortality from cardiovascular diseases has been 
affected by pharmaceuticals and other medical interventions over the last 30 
years in Germany.
METHODS: Main outcome measures were the time series of direct method death rates 
(DMDR) of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortalities. To control for 
socioeconomic and secular trends the difference between both time series was 
calculated. The impact of interventions on mortality was analysed by developing 
two linear regression models: The onset model analyses whether the introduction 
of interventions influences mortality or not. The consumption model estimates 
the quantitative impact of interventions in two phases.
RESULTS: Cardiovascular mortality as a percentage of total mortality fell from 
40 to 38% over the study period. All investigated interventions had 
statistically significant effects on the decline of cardiovascular diseases, 
which is expressed by the standardised regression coefficient: onset model: 
preventive behaviour index (PBI) -8.3, angioplasty/CABG -0.6, antithrombotic 
agents -1.5, diuretics -0.9, beta-blockers -1.0, calcium channel blockers -0.8 
and ACE inhibitors -1.1 (all interventions p < 0.01); consumption model: 
innovative drugs phase I -7.5 (p = 0.017), innovative drugs phase II -6.9 (p < 
0.01), PBI -13.1 (p < 0.01) and angioplasty/CABG -9.9 (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: All innovative drug classes and surgical interventions had a 
positive effect on the decline of cardiovascular mortality.

[Monitoring hypoglycemia in elderly diabetic patients: a prospective study].

[Article in French]

Hypoglycaemia is often underestimated in the elderly diabetic patient, as 
clinical manifestations of hypoglycaemia in these patients are frequently 
atypical. This prospective study, enrolling 100 elderly diabetic patients (age: 
79.3 years) shows a great incidence of hypoglycaemic events (24%) during the 
first day of hospitalisation in a geriatric unit. According to the results of 
this study, common risk factors for hypoglycaemia in the elderly (advanced age, 
insulin therapy, renal insufficiency, polymedication, fragility) have no 
significant predictive value. It appears that screening for risk factors is not 
enough to prevent hypoglycaemia in the elderly diabetic patient, thereby a 
careful monitoring of glycaemia during the first days (and nights) of 
hospitalisation is required. Renewed efforts at better defining appropriate 
therapeutic goals, taking into account the patient's life expectancy and 
comorbidities, will help prevent the occurrence of hypoglycaemia in the elderly 
diabetic patient.

Presbyterian Hospital, 525 E. 68th Street, New York, NY 10021, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To define the efficacy and tolerability of sildenafil in elderly men, 
as epidemiological data show an increasing life-expectancy of the population, 
and age is not only correlated with increasing morbidity but also an increase in 
the prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED), for which sildenafil, available for 
>8 years, is effective and safe across a wide variety of medical comorbidities, 
severity and causes of ED.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A database was generated from all sildenafil users in one 
sexual medicine practice, and data were extracted for men aged >60 years. The 
database included data on patient demographics, comorbidities, International 
Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) scores and adverse events (AEs). The patients 
were subdivided into those aged 60-69 (group 1), 70-79 (group 2), and > or = 80 
years (group 3). Analysis of variance was used to assess differences among the 
three groups for several variables of demographics and erectile response.
RESULTS: In all, 167 patients were analysed; there were no significant 
differences in the duration of ED (5 +/- 3 years) or presence of comorbidities 
among the three groups. With a mean of two risk factors, the overall incidence 
of comorbidities was hypertension in 37%, dyslipidaemia in 28%, diabetes in 26%, 
coronary artery disease in 18% and lower urinary tract symptoms in 46%. The 
efficacy data showed that overall, 54% of men responded to sildenafil, with a 
mean increase in IIEF EF domain score of 5.7. Within the three groups there was 
a significant age-related decrease in response rate and IIEF EF domain score 
with age. However, there was no difference in AE incidence among the three 
groups, with an overall profile of 18% headache, 8% flushing, 8% dyspepsia, 5% 
nasal congestion and 2% visual changes. No overt cardiovascular events were 
reported.
CONCLUSIONS: From these data, sildenafil is an effective agent in elderly men, 
but had a lower efficacy rate with increasing age, especially in men aged >80 
years. The incidence of side-effects was similar to that in the general 
population taking sildenafil, with no difference in AEs among the different age 
groups.

The influence of tubule orientation on the transition from fatigue to fatigue 
crack growth in human dentin was examined. Compact tension (CT) and rectangular 
beam specimens were prepared from the coronal dentin of molars with three unique 
tubule orientations (i.e., 0 degrees , 45 degrees and 90 degrees). The CT 
specimens (N=25) were used to characterize fatigue crack initiation and 
steady-state cyclic extension, whereas the rectangular beams (N=132) were 
subjected to 4-pt flexure and used in quantifying the stress-life fatigue 
response. The transition behavior was analyzed using both the Kitagawa-Takahashi 
and El Haddad approaches. Results showed that both the fatigue crack growth and 
stress-life responses were dependent on the tubule orientation. The average 
Paris Law exponent for crack growth perpendicular (90 degrees) to the tubules 
(m=13.3+/-1.1) was significantly greater (p<0.05) than that for crack growth 
oblique (45 degrees) to the tubules (m=11.5+/-1.87). Similarly, the fatigue 
strength of dentin with 90 degrees tubule orientation was significantly lower 
(p<0.05) than that for the other two orientations, regardless of the range of 
cyclic stress. The apparent endurance strengths of specimens with 0 degrees 
(44MPa) and 45 degrees (53MPa) orientations were nearly twice that of the 90 
degrees (24MPa) orientation. Based on these results, human dentin exhibits the 
largest degree of anisotropy within the stress-life regime and the transition 
from fatigue to fatigue crack growth occurs under the lowest cyclic stress range 
when the tubules are aligned with the cyclic normal stress (90 degrees 
orientation).

    Rheumatology (Oxford). 2008 Feb;47(2):119-20.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the costs and benefits associated with long-term 
etanercept (ETN) treatment in patients with severe ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
in the UK in accordance with the BSR guidelines.
METHODS: A mathematical model was constructed to estimate the costs and benefits 
associated with ETN plus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) compared 
with NSAIDs alone. Individual patient data from Phase III RCTs was used to 
inform the proportion and magnitude of initial response to treatment and changes 
in health-related quality of life. A retrospective costing exercise on patients 
attending a UK secondary care rheumatology unit was used to inform disease 
costs. Published evidence on long-term disease progression was extrapolated over 
a 25-yr horizon. Uncertainty was examined using probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Over a 25-yr horizon, ETN plus NSAIDs gave 1.58 more QALYs at an 
additional cost of 35,978 pounds when compared with NSAID treatment alone. This 
equates to a central estimate of 22,700 pounds per QALY. The incremental cost 
per QALYs using shorter time periods were 27,600 pounds, 23,600 pounds and 
22,600 pounds at 2, 5 and 15 yrs, respectively. Using a 25-yr horizon, 93% of 
results from the probabilistic analyses fall below a threshold of 25,000 pounds 
per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential cost-effectiveness of ETN 
plus NSAIDs compared with NSAIDs alone in patients with severe AS treated 
according to the BSR guidelines in the UK.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent medical advances are increasing the life 
expectancy of children with Hurler syndrome; however, little is known about the 
motor abilities of children who have received these medical interventions. The 
purpose of this study was to describe the temporal and spatial gait parameters 
of children with Hurler syndrome following umbilical cord blood transplantation 
(UCBT) in reference to gait parameters of children with typical development.
SUBJECTS: The group with Hurler syndrome consisted of 18 children between 19.6 
and 96.8 months of age who were examined 1 to 4 times between 2.9 and 72.2 
months after UCBT. Four hundred thirty-eight children with typical development 
between the ages of 14.4 and 131.8 months served as a comparison group.
METHODS: Temporal and spatial gait parameters were assessed using a GAITRite 
electronic walkway. Step length, gait speed, and cadence were normalized for 
body stature.
RESULTS: Children with Hurler syndrome had slower gait speeds and shorter step 
lengths than children with typical development at 2 and 3 years of age. Time 
since transplantation was a predictor of gait speed and step length.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Children with Hurler syndrome after UCBT were delayed 
in maturation of temporal and spatial gait parameters.

A prospective multicenter program was performed to evaluate the combination of 
rituximab and high-dose (hd) sequential chemotherapy delivered with multiple 
autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) support (R-HDS-maps regimen) 
in previously untreated patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLB-CL) and 
age-adjusted International Prognostic Score (aaIPI) score 2-3. R-HDS-maps 
includes: (i) three APO courses; (ii) sequential administration of 
hd-cyclophosphamide (CY), hd-Ara-C, both supplemented with rituximab, 
hd-etoposide/cisplatin, PBPC harvests, following hd-CY and hd-Ara-C; (iii) 
hd-mitoxantrone (hd-Mito)/L-Pam + 2 further rituximab doses; (iv) involved-field 
radiotherapy. PBPC rescue was scheduled following Ara-C, etoposide/cisplatin and 
Mito/L-Pam. Between 1999 and 2004, 112 consecutive patients aged <65 years (74 
score 2, 38 score 3) entered the study protocol. There were five early and two 
late toxic deaths. Overall 90 patients (80%) reached clinical remission (CR); at 
a median 48 months follow-up, 87 (78%) patients are alive, 82 (73%) in 
continuous CR, with 4 year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) 
projections of 76% (CI 68-85%) and 73% (CI 64-81%), respectively. There were no 
significant differences in OS and EFS between subgroups with Germinal-Center and 
Activated B-cell phenotype. Thus, life expectancy of younger patients with aaIPI 
2-3 DLB-CL is improved with the early administration of rituximab-supplemented 
intensive chemotherapy compared with the poor outcome following conventional 
chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Screening elderly men for prostate cancer is not recommended because 
definitive treatments are unlikely to extend life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: Describe clinical outcomes after a negative prostate biopsy in a 
population-based cohort of men ages 65 and older.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: 9,410 Medicare-eligible men who underwent a prostate biopsy in Los 
Angeles or New Mexico in 1992.
MEASUREMENTS: We used Medicare and SEER databases to identify a cohort with an 
initial negative biopsy (n = 7,119) and to ascertain survival, subsequent PSA 
testing, prostate biopsies, and prostate cancer detection and treatment through 
1997.
RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival was 79.4% (95% CI 78.4-80.3), but only 
74.6% (72.4-76.7) for men ages 75-79 at the time of the initial negative biopsy 
and 55.0% (51.9-57.9) for men ages 80+. During a median 4.5 years follow-up, a 
cumulative 75.0% (73.9-76.1) of the cohort underwent PSA testing. Among men ages 
75-79 and 80+, the cumulative proportions that underwent PSA testing were 75.4% 
(73.0-77.8) and 74.3% (71.1-77.5), respectively. Additionally, 29.1% (26.7-31.6) 
of men ages 75-79 and 20.1% (17.6-23.1) of men ages 80+ underwent repeat 
prostate biopsy, and 10.9% (9.4-12.7) and 8.3% (6.6-10.4), respectively, were 
diagnosed with cancer. Among men ages 75+ with localized cancers, approximately 
34% received definitive treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: High proportions of men ages 75+ underwent PSA testing and repeat 
prostate biopsies after an initial negative prostate biopsy. Given the known 
harms and uncertain benefits for finding and treating localized cancer in 
elderly men, most continued PSA testing after a negative biopsy is potentially 
inappropriate.

OBJECTIVES: The study aim is to describe interest in breast cancer 
chemoprevention among older women without a history of breast cancer and to 
determine whether aging-related factors such as diminished life expectancy, 
increasing comorbidity and medication burden attenuate chemoprevention interest.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
SETTING: University of Pennsylvania Health System.
PARTICIPANTS: Four-hundred fifty-seven community-dwelling women aged 60-65 years 
old who were potentially eligible for breast cancer chemoprevention according to 
guidelines linking risk and eligibility to age.
MEASUREMENTS: Interest in breast cancer chemoprevention, Gail model breast 
cancer risk, perceived breast cancer risk, breast cancer worry, self-reported 
health status and comorbidities, and self-reported perceived life expectancy.
RESULTS: Of 457 participants, 11.2% reported being interested in taking 
chemoprevention, 40.9% reported no interest, and 47.9% reported being unsure 
about their interest in chemoprevention. Overall, interest in chemoprevention 
was not associated with individual Gail model breast cancer risk. In adjusted 
analysis, lack of interest among high-risk women was associated with low breast 
cancer worry and low perceived risk. Conversely, interest in chemoprevention 
among low risk women was associated with greater breast cancer worry. 
Age-related factors hypothesized to affect chemoprevention interest, including 
subjective life expectancy, increased comorbidity, and number of daily 
medications did not attenuate chemoprevention interest.
CONCLUSION: Breast cancer worry and perceived breast cancer risk contribute to 
the lack of correlation between interest in breast cancer chemoprevention and 
objective breast cancer risk. Perceived life expectancy, increased comorbidity, 
and medication burden do not attenuate chemoprevention interest among older 
women.

BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive antimalarial treatment in infants (IPTi) 
with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine reduces falciparum malaria and anemia but has not 
been evaluated in areas with intense perennial malaria transmission. It is 
unknown whether an additional treatment in the second year of life prolongs 
protection.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with 
administration of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine therapy at 3, 9, and 15 months of 
age was conducted with 1070 children in an area in Ghana where malaria is 
holoendemic. Participants were monitored for 21 months after recruitment through 
active follow-up visits and passive case detection. The primary end point was 
malaria incidence, and additional outcome measures were anemia, outpatient 
visits, hospital admissions, and mortality. Stratified analyses for 6-month 
periods after each treatment were performed.
RESULTS: Protective efficacy against malaria episodes was 20% (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 11%-29%). The frequency of malaria episodes was reduced after the 
first 2 sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine applications (protective efficacy, 23% [95% 
CI, 6%-36%] after the first dose and 17% [95% CI, 1%-30%] after the second 
dose). After the third treatment at month 15, however, no protection was 
achieved. Protection against the first or single anemia episode was only 
significant after the first IPTi dose (protective efficacy, 30%; 95% CI, 
5%-49%). The number of anemia episodes increased after the last IPTi dose 
(protective efficacy, -24%; 95% CI, -50% to -2%).
CONCLUSION: In an area of intense perennial malaria transmission, 
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-based IPTi conferred considerably lower protection 
than reported in areas where the disease is moderately or seasonally endemic. 
Protective efficacy is age-dependent, and extension of IPTi into the second year 
of life does not provide any benefit.

[The economics of mental health and health care- a blind spot?].

Mental disorders are associated with an immense burden of disease for patients, 
their social environment and for society as a whole. Neuropsychiatric diseases 
have been estimated to account for 27% of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) 
in the Euro-A region and have thus more impact on the global burden of disease 
than cardiovascular diseases or neoplasms. In the population younger than 30 
years even 65% of years lost due to disability are due to neuropsychiatric 
disorders. Moreover, the economic consequences of mental disorders pose a 
significant challenge on health care systems. For example, it has been estimated 
that 10% of direct health care costs in Germany were caused by mental and 
behavioural disorders in 2002. With limited available resources, it is becoming 
increasingly important to allocate health care budgets efficiently. It is 
therefore surprising that mental disorders as compared to other diseases are 
considerably underrepresented in the health economic evaluation of health care 
interventions. Health economic research has concentrated on the pharmacoeconomic 
assessment of new drugs so far while other interventions and alternative ways of 
care delivery, e.g., specialized day care, have rarely been subject to health 
economic evaluation and are thus systematically disadvantaged. Causes underlying 
the reservation towards mental disorders in health economics are being discussed 
and future perspectives are outlined.

RATIONALE: COPD is associated with reduced life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between small airway pathology and 
long-term survival after lung volume reduction in chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) and the effect of corticosteroids on this pathology.
METHODS: Patients with severe (GOLD-3) and very severe (GOLD-4) COPD (n = 101) 
were studied after lung volume reduction surgery. Respiratory symptoms, quality 
of life, pulmonary function, exercise tolerance, chest radiology, and 
corticosteroid treatment status were assessed preoperatively. The severity of 
luminal occlusion, wall thickening, and the presence of small airways containing 
lymphoid follicles were determined in resected lung tissue. Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the 
relationship between survival and small airway pathology. The effect of 
corticosteroids on this pathology was assessed by comparing treated and 
untreated groups.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The quartile of subjects with the greatest 
luminal occlusion, adjusted for covariates, died earlier than subjects who had 
the least occlusion (hazard ratio, 3.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.55-6.92; P = 
0.002). There was a trend toward a reduction in the number of airways containing 
lymphoid follicles (P = 0.051) in those receiving corticosteroids, with a 
statistically significant difference between the control and oral +/- inhaled 
corticosteroid-treated groups (P = 0.019). However, corticosteroid treatment had 
no effect on airway wall thickening or luminal occlusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Occlusion of the small airways by inflammatory exudates containing 
mucus is associated with early death in patients with severe emphysema treated 
by lung volume reduction surgery. Corticosteroid treatment dampens the host 
immune response in these airways by reducing lymphoid follicles without changing 
wall thickening and luminal occlusion.

Despite the fact that life expectancy has nearly doubled over the past century, 
the US public has become increasingly preoccupied with issues of health and 
illness. In this study, the authors investigated cohort differences in 
self-rated health between women born in 1935-1944 (preboomers) and women born in 
1945-1954 (baby boomers). A randomly selected, community-based sample of 618 
mothers, 314 preboomers, and 304 baby boomers was interviewed. Over three 
decades, self-rated health was assessed in 1975, 1983, 1985-1986, 1991-1994, and 
2001-2004. An individual growth model showed a linear decline (-0.61 per year, 
p<0.001) in self-rated health from mean ages 31-59 years combined, with a 
quadratic age effect (-0.03, p<0.001). Baby boomers reported lower self-rated 
health (mean difference, -5.30; p<0.001) and more rapid decline per year (slope 
difference, -0.52; p<0.001) than did preboomers of overlapping ages; those 
differences remained after adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic variables, 
personality factors, health behaviors, chronic illness, and depression symptoms. 
Study findings have important implications with regard to the potential growing 
burden on the nation's health care system, suggesting that generational changes 
in health evaluations and expectations may continue to increase demand for 
medical care.

Older adults' exercise behavior: roles of selected constructs of 
social-cognitive theory.

USA.

Exercise is consistently related to physical and psychological health benefits 
in older adults. Bandura's social-cognitive theory (SCT) is one theoretical 
perspective on understanding and predicting exercise behavior. Thus, the authors 
examined whether three SCT variables-self-efficacy, self-regulation, and 
outcome-expectancy value-predicted older adults' (N = 98) exercise behavior. 
Bivariate analyses revealed that regular exercise was associated with being 
male, White, and married; having higher income, education, and self-efficacy; 
using self-regulation skills; and having favorable outcome-expectancy values (p 
< .05). In a simultaneous multivariate model, however, self-regulation (p = 
.0097) was the only variable independently associated with regular exercise. 
Thus, exercise interventions targeting older adults should include components 
aimed at increasing the use of self-regulation strategies.

PURPOSE: To assess the benefits of adjuvant high-dose interferon alfa (HDI) 
treatment for patients with high-risk melanoma.
METHODS: We designed a decision-analytic probabilistic Markov model to simulate 
the natural history of patients with stage IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC melanoma and 
evaluate the outcomes with and without HDI treatment. Outcomes were in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs). Probability estimates and costs were derived from primary patient level 
data, while the efficacy of HDI and associated utilities were determined from 
published reports. The base-case analysis was a cohort of 50-year-old patients.
RESULTS: HDI increased the median life expectancy in patients with stage III 
melanoma from 3.75 years in the observation cohort to 4.42 years in the HDI 
cohort. The difference in QALYs ranged from 0.31 years for stage IIIA patients 
to 0.60 years for stage IIIC patients treated with HDI. HDI was cost effective 
in patients with stage IIIB and IIIC melanoma, with ICERs of $95,304 and $76,068 
per QALY gained, respectively. Using a threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained, 
HDI was cost effective for all stage III patients younger than 52 years. HDI was 
not cost effective for patients with stage IIIA disease and for subsets of 
patients older than 63 years with stage IIIB disease.
CONCLUSION: Our model demonstrates that the probability of HDI being cost 
effective varies substantially by melanoma substage. HDI showed the greatest 
benefit in terms of QALYs and was most cost effective in patients younger than 
60 years with stage IIIC disease.

Laboratory bioassays were conducted to evaluate the effects of spirodiclofen on 
life history and life-table parameters of two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus 
urticae Koch) females treated at pre-ovipositional period with a series of 
acaricide concentrations starting with the concentration discriminative for eggs 
and immatures i.e. the lowest concentration that causes 100% mortality of those 
stages. After a 24 h exposure, the proportion of females that survived 
treatments was 0.71 (6 mg/l), 0.51 (12 mg/l), 0.41 (24 mg/l), 0.30 (48 mg/l) and 
0.25 (96 mg/l). At the end of the trial, the survival rate of females treated 
with the lowest concentration was significantly lower than the survival rate of 
untreated females but it remained above that of females treated with higher 
concentrations. Total fecundity/fertility significantly decreased as 
concentrations of spirodiclofen increased. Viable eggs were laid by females 
treated with 6, 12 and 24 mg/l, and total fertility was reduced by 42, 84 and 
97%, respectively. Compared with control, the gross fecundity/fertility of the 
treated females was significantly reduced throughout the trial, except in 
females treated with 6 mg/l. All concentrations caused a significant reduction 
in the net fecundity/fertility throughout the trial. The females treated with 12 
mg/l had significantly reduced net reproductive rate (R0 = 6.45), compared to 
females treated with 6 mg/l (R0 = 23.35) and to untreated females (R0 = 28.92); 
there was no significant difference between the last two treatments. The 
intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) and finite rate of increase (lambda) were 
significantly reduced in treated females (r(m)) = 0.141, lambda = 1.156 and r(m) 
= 0.214, lambda = 1.232; 12 and 6 mg/l, respectively), compared to control (r(m) 
= 0.251, lambda = 1.276). The reduction was significantly greater in females 
treated with the highest concentration. As a result of the lowered r(m), the 
doubling time in treated females was significantly extended. Sublethal effects 
of spirodiclofen and its impact on T. urticae management are discussed.

The narrowing sex differential in life expectancy in high-income populations: 
effects of differences in the age pattern of mortality.

Glei DA(1), Horiuchi S.

Author information:
(1)University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. danaglei@berkeley.edu

Using data from the Human Mortality Database for 29 high-income national 
populations (1751-2004), we review trends in the sex differential in e(0). The 
widening of this gap during most of the 1900s was due largely to a slower 
mortality decline for males than females, which previous studies attributed to 
behavioural factors (e.g., smoking). More recently, the gap began to narrow in 
most countries, and researchers tried to explain this reversal with the same 
factors. However, our decomposition analysis reveals that, for the majority of 
countries, the recent narrowing is due primarily to sex differences in the age 
pattern of mortality rather than declining sex ratios in mortality: the same 
rate of mortality decline produces smaller gains in e(0) for women than for men 
because women's deaths are less dispersed across age (i.e., survivorship is more 
rectangular).

OBJECTIVE: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has emerged as a crucial mediator of mucosal 
defense in the gastrointestinal tract. Its metabolic pathway products, 
biliverdin/bilirubin and carbon monoxide, can reduce oxidative stress and 
inflammation, and promote resistance to apoptosis. The role of HO-1 in 
gastrointestinal malignancies, however, remains to be elucidated. The purpose of 
this study was to analyze HO-1 expression in human colon adenoma and cancer 
samples.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-five paraffin-embedded surgical specimens of 
colorectal cancer and 19 colonic adenoma samples were stained 
immunhistochemically for HO-1 expression using an anti-HO-1 monoclonal antibody. 
HO-1 expression was evaluated independently by two different investigators and 
subsequently correlated to clinical data and patients' life expectancy.
RESULTS: Focal HO-1 expression could be documented in 41.8% (23/55) of patients 
with colorectal cancer. HO-1 expression in colonic adenoma was detectable in 
36.8% (7/19) of cases. The rate of lymphatic tumor invasion was significantly 
lower in colorectal cancer samples expressing HO-1 (p=0.048). Additionally, 
fewer lymph node metastases were found in colorectal cancer samples with HO-1 
expression, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Mean 
observation period was 65.87+/-3.96 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a 
significantly better survival for colorectal cancer patients with colonic HO-1 
expression (p=0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that colonic HO-1 may be a prognostic 
marker of colorectal-cancer outcome.

Management strategies for pain in breast carcinoma patients: current opinions 
and future perspectives.

Sciences & G.T.B. Hospital, Delhi, India. prof_ashok@rediffmail.com

Breast cancer is the most frequently encountered carcinoma in women worldwide. 
Pain is the most distressing symptom in patients with breast carcinoma and can 
occur at all stages of the disease due to the cancer per se as well as due to 
various diagnostic and treatment modalities. A proper pain assessment helps in 
identification of pain syndromes and guides in formulating analgesic strategies. 
Primary therapies of breast carcinoma like surgery, chemotherapy, and 
radiotherapy for bony metastases can cause substantial pain relief. However, 
multimodal analgesic approaches incorporating pharmacological, interventional as 
well as non-conventional techniques should be employed prior to, in conjunction 
with, and after primary therapies of breast cancer. The prevalence of chronic 
neuropathic pain following breast cancer surgery may exceed 50% by current 
estimates, and with the increase in life expectancy of these patients, providing 
adequate pain relief is of paramount importance to improve their quality of 
life. In this review, we discuss prevailing methods of evaluation and management 
of pain in patients of breast carcinoma and the new techniques that may become 
the mainstay of pain management protocols in future.

Stent versus gastrojejunostomy for the palliation of gastric outlet obstruction: 
a systematic review.

<s.jeurnink@erasmusmc.nl>

BACKGROUND: Gastrojejunostomy (GJJ) is the most commonly used palliative 
treatment modality for malignant gastric outlet obstruction. Recently, stent 
placement has been introduced as an alternative treatment. We reviewed the 
available literature on stent placement and GJJ for gastric outlet obstruction, 
with regard to medical effects and costs.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed by searching PubMed 
for the period January 1996 and January 2006. A total of 44 publications on GJJ 
and stents was identified and reported results on medical effects and costs were 
pooled and evaluated. Results from randomized and comparative studies were used 
for calculating odds ratios (OR) to compare differences between the two 
treatment modalities.
RESULTS: In 2 randomized trials, stent placement was compared with GJJ (with 27 
and 18 patients in each trial). In 6 comparative studies, stent placement was 
compared with GJJ. Thirty-six series evaluated either stent placement or GJJ. A 
total of 1046 patients received a duodenal stent and 297 patients underwent GJJ.
