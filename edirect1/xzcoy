months) was significantly shorter than in the PC-DCM-AF group (21.9 months) or 
PC-DCM-SR group (29.1 months, P=0.001). CHF-DCM-AF in IW was associated with 
reduced life expectancy and CD, while most IW with preclinical DCM died from 
non-cardiac causes.

BACKGROUND: Early life adversity (ELA) increases major depressive disorder (MDD) 
and suicide risk and potentially affects dentate gyrus (DG) plasticity. We 
reported smaller DG and fewer granular neurons (GNs) in MDD. ELA effects on DG 
plasticity in suicide decedents with MDD (MDDSui) and resilient subjects (ELA 
history without MDD or suicide) are unknown.
METHODS: We quantified neural progenitor cells (NPCs), GNs, glia, and DG volume 
in whole hippocampus postmortem in four groups of drug-free, neuropathology-free 
subjects (N = 52 total): psychological autopsy-defined MDDSui and control 
subjects with and without ELA (before 15 years of age).
RESULTS: ELA was associated with larger DG (p < .0001) and trending fewer NPCs 
(p = .0190) only in control subjects in whole DG, showing no effect on NPCs and 
DG volume in MDDSui. ELA exposure was associated with more GNs (p = .0003) and a 
trend for more glia (p = .0160) in whole DG in MDDSui and control subjects. 
MDDSui without ELA had fewer anterior and mid DG GNs (p < .0001), fewer anterior 
DG NPCs (p < .0001), and smaller whole DG volume (p = .0005) compared with 
control subjects without ELA. In MDDSui, lower Global Assessment Scale score 
correlated with fewer GNs and smaller DG.
CONCLUSIONS: Resilience to ELA involves a larger DG, perhaps related to more 
neurogenesis depleting NPCs, and because mature GNs and glia numbers do not 
differ in the resilient group, perhaps there are effects on process extension 
and synaptic load that can be examined in future studies. In MDDSui without ELA, 
smaller DG volume, with fewer GNs and NPCs, suggests less neurogenesis and/or 
more apoptosis and dendrite changes.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: With chronic diseases on the rise, there is a growing demand 
for palliative care. The global landscape of the integration of palliative care 
into health-care systems is incipient, which leads to a lack of social awareness 
of this reality and consequently, to communication failures, particularly a 
conspiracy of silence. The aim of this study was to analyze the concept of 
conspiracy of silence in palliative care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Walker and Avant method of concept analysis was used. 
Review and synthesis of literature supported the analysis process. Forty-seven 
articles were analyzed.
RESULTS: Results showed that the conspiracy of silence in palliative care is a 
communication failure, typical of limited life expectancy prognosis, and 
involves patients, their families, and health-care teams. Lack of autonomy, 
overburden, family malfunctioning and coping, and health-care dehumanization are 
consequences of the conspiracy of silence in palliative care.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study had found that scales to measure this concept as 
well as interventions that consider important factors in the communication 
process in palliative care identified in this analysis are needed.

BACKGROUND: Malignant ascites is an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal 
cavity due to the manifestation of terminal metastatic malignancies. 
Accumulation of ascitic fluid could cause abdominal distention, early satiety, 
and shortness of breath. The onset and progression of these symptoms are not 
only distressing but also cause deterioration of the quality of life. Malignant 
ascites is associated with poor prognosis with anticipated life expectancy 
ranging from 1 to 4 months. Therapeutic paracentesis is the mainstay of 
palliation for malignant ascites. It only provides a temporary relief of 
symptoms, ascites re-accumulates, and paracentesis has to be repeated.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this case series was to evaluate our experiences when 
treating malignant ascites with placement of central venous catheter in the 
peritoneal cavity, with special emphasis on patient satisfaction, comfort of 
caregiver, technical success, and adverse events.
METHODS: Five patients with advanced disease and recurrent malignant ascites who 
required multiple paracentesis were selected for placement of 7-FG triple-port 
Central venous catheter in the peritoneal cavity. Maximum fluids that can be 
tapped were removed in ward. Patients and their relatives were assessed for 
satisfaction with the procedure.
RESULTS: Out of 5 patients, 3 were female and 2 male (age between 46 and 62 
years). Two patients had carcinoma gallbladder and one each of carcinoma ovary, 
breast, and prostate. All patients were followed up till 1 month from catheter 
placement. Patients and their relatives were well satisfied in terms of frequent 
hospital visit for paracentesis.
CONCLUSION: In summary, we suggest that central venous catheter may be used as 
indwelling peritoneal catheter for the symptom management of recurrent malignant 
ascites. It provides a relatively safe and cost-effective alternative to serial 
large-volume paracentesis that requires multiple hospital admissions.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend less aggressive target hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c) levels based on older age and lower life expectancy for older adults 
with diabetes. The effectiveness of electronic health record (EHR) clinical 
decision support (CDS) in promoting guideline adherence is undermined by alert 
fatigue and poor workflow integration. Integrating behavioral economics (BE) and 
CDS tools is a novel approach to improving adherence to guidelines while 
minimizing clinician burden.
METHODS: We will apply a systematic, user-centered design approach to 
incorporate BE "nudges" into a CDS module and will perform user testing in two 
"vanguard" sites. To accomplish this, we will conduct (1) semi-structured 
interviews with key informants (n = 8), (2) a 2-h, design-thinking workshop to 
derive and refine initial module ideas, and (3) semi-structured group interviews 
at each site with clinic leaders and clinicians to elicit feedback on three 
proposed nudge module components (navigator section, inbasket refill protocol, 
medication preference list). Detailed field notes will be summarized by module 
idea and usability theme for rapid iteration. Frequency of firing and user 
action taken will be assessed in the first month of implementation via EHR 
reporting to confirm that module components and related reporting are working as 
expected as well as assess utilization. To assess the utilization and 
feasibility of the new tools and generate estimates of clinician compliance with 
the Choosing Wisely guideline for diabetes management in older adults, a 
6-month, single-arm pilot study of the BE-EHR module will be conducted in six 
outpatient primary care clinics.
DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that a low burden, user-centered approach to design 
will yield a BE-driven, CDS module with relatively high utilization by 
clinicians. The resulting module will establish a platform for exploring the 
ability of BE concepts embedded within the EHR to affect guideline adherence for 
other use cases.

BACKGROUND: Patients with severe mental illness (SMI) have a reduced life 
expectancy of one to two decades as compared to the general population, with 
most years of life lost due to somatic diseases. Most previous studies on 
disorders constituting SMI, e.g. schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, have 
investigated the disorders separately and hence not compared the disorders in 
terms of mortality rates relative to the background population.
METHODS: A register-based cohort study including the entire Danish population 
comparing mortality rates relative to the background population, controlling for 
age and sex, i.e. standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) in patients diagnosed 
with schizophrenia with those in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder, 
during the study period from 1995 to 2014.
RESULTS: The SMR of patients with SMI was significantly higher than one for each 
calendar year in the study period with an overall SMR of 4.58, 95% CI 
(4.48-4.69) in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (n = 38,500) and of 2.57 
(95% CI 2.49-2.65) in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder (n = 23,092). 
When investigating time trends in SMR for schizophrenia and for bipolar 
disorder, respectively, an increase in SMR over time was shown with a mean 
increase of 0.03 per year for schizophrenia and 0.02 for bipolar disorder 
(p < 0.01 for both disorders). The ratio between SMR for schizophrenia and SMR 
for bipolar disorder for each calendar year over the study period was constant 
(p = 0.756).
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing SMRs over the last 20 years were found for both patients 
diagnosed with bipolar disorder and patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. 
Despite clear differences between the two disorders regarding SMRs, the 
increases in SMR over time were similar, which could suggest similar underlying 
factors influencing mortality rates in both disorders.

PURPOSE: This study investigated the psychometric gain, if any, from the 
extension of the EQ-5D with a cognition bolt-on (EQ-5D + C) in a large cohort 
injury patients with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI).
METHODS: Hospitalized adult injury patients filled out a survey 1 month after 
initial admission. The survey included the EQ-5D-3L, the cognition bolt-on item 
in EQ-5D format, and the visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). We compared ceiling and 
other distributional effects between EQ-5D and EQ-5D + C and TBI and non-TBI 
group, and assessed convergent validity using the predictive association with 
EQ-VAS. Also, we assessed explanatory power using regression analysis, and 
classification efficiency using Shannon indices.
RESULTS: In total, 715 TBI patients and 1978 non-TBI patients filled out the 
EQ-5D + C and EQ-VAS. Perfect health was reported by 7.9% (N = 214) on the 
EQ-5D, and 7.3% (N = 197) on the EQ-5D + C. Convergent validity was highest for 
EQ-5D + C in the TBI group (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = - 0.736) 
and lowest for EQ-5D in the non-TBI group (Spearman's rank correlation 
coefficient = - 0.652). For both TBI and non-TBI groups, the explanatory power 
of EQ-5D + C was slightly higher than of EQ-5D (R2 = 0.56 vs. 0.53 for TBI; 
R2 = 0.47 vs. 0.45 for non-TBI). Absolute classification efficiency was higher 
for EQ-5D + C than for EQ-5D in both TBI groups, whereas relative classification 
efficiency was similar.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychometric performance in general of both the EQ-5D and EQ-5D + C 
was better in TBI patients. Adding a cognitive bolt-on slightly improved the 
psychometric performance of the EQ-5D-3L.

The Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD) databases provide global, curated 
repositories for information regarding polymorphisms of genes of the immune 
system, thereby generating immense value for the research and clinical 
communities. The advent of high-throughput genotyping in immunogenetics has led 
to dramatically growing numbers of heretofore unknown HLA and lately also 
killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) alleles, which are to be curated 
and deposited in the IPD-IMGT/HLA and IPD-KIR databases, respectively. It is 
highly desirable that these novel alleles are characterised and submitted in 
full length, and that known alleles are extended to cover the complete gene 
sequence. However, the manual annotation and submission of sequences to European 
Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Nucleotide Archive and the IPD-IMGT/HLA 
and IPD-KIR databases is time-consuming and error-prone. Here, we report the 
substantial extension of the HLA allele submission tool TypeLoader, which now 
also supports the annotation and submission of KIR alleles. To enable a more 
widespread use of this tool, we have made it available as a stand-alone 
application that can easily be installed on standard Windows or Linux computers. 
Furthermore, an internal SQLite database was added to store a wide range of 
metadata about each allele. This allows TypeLoader2 to be used as a lab's 
central information platform for the annotation, curation and submission of 
full-length HLA and KIR allele sequences. The software is freely available from 
GitHub (https://github.com/DKMS-LSL/typeloader). We hope that the increased 
convenience and scope of TypeLoader2 will foster the submission of more 
full-length sequences to the IPD-IMGT/HLA and IPD-KIR databases, ultimately 
promoting the use of full-length sequencing for genotyping both HLA and KIR.

Foundation Trust, Sheffield, UK.

BACKGROUND: Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare form of cancer that affects 
patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and survival. Cabozantinib 
(Cometriq®; Ipsen, Paris, France) and vandetanib (Caprelsa®; Sanofi Genzyme, 
Cambridge, MA, USA) are currently the treatment modality of choice for treating 
unresectable progressive and symptomatic MTC.
OBJECTIVES: (1) To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of 
cabozantinib and vandetanib. (2) To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness 
of cabozantinib and vandetanib versus each other and best supportive care. (3) 
To identify key areas for primary research. (4) To estimate the overall cost of 
these treatments in England.
DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed publications (searched from inception to November 
2016), European Public Assessment Reports and manufacturers' submissions.
REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review [including a network meta-analysis (NMA)] 
was conducted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of cabozantinib 
and vandetanib. The economic analysis included a review of existing analyses and 
the development of a de novo model.
RESULTS: The systematic review identified two placebo-controlled trials. The 
Efficacy of XL184 (Cabozantinib) in Advanced Medullary Thyroid Cancer (EXAM) 
trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of cabozantinib in patients with 
unresectable locally advanced, metastatic and progressive MTC. The ZETA trial 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of vandetanib in patients with unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic MTC. Both drugs significantly improved 
progression-free survival (PFS) more than the placebo (p < 0.001). The NMA 
suggested that, within the symptomatic and progressive MTC population, the 
effects on PFS were similar (vandetanib vs. cabozantinib: hazard ratio 1.14, 95% 
credible interval 0.41 to 3.09). Neither trial demonstrated a significant 
overall survival benefit for cabozantinib or vandetanib versus placebo, although 
data from ZETA were subject to potential confounding. Both cabozantinib and 
vandetanib demonstrated significantly better objective response rates and 
calcitonin (CTN) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) response rates than placebo. 
Both cabozantinib and vandetanib produced frequent adverse events, often leading 
to dose interruption or reduction. The assessment group model indicates that, 
within the EU-label population (symptomatic and progressive MTC), the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for cabozantinib and vandetanib 
are > £138,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Within the 
restricted EU-label population (symptomatic and progressive MTC with CEA/CTN 
doubling times of ≤ 24 months), the ICER for vandetanib is expected to be 
> £66,000 per QALY gained. The maximum annual budget impact within the 
symptomatic and progressive population is estimated to be ≈£2.35M for 
cabozantinib and ≈£5.53M for vandetanib. The costs of vandetanib in the 
restricted EU-label population are expected to be lower.
LIMITATIONS: The intention-to-treat populations of the EXAM and ZETA trials are 
notably different. The analyses of ZETA subgroups may be subject to confounding 
as a result of differences in baseline characteristics and open-label vandetanib 
use. Attempts to statistically adjust for treatment switching were unsuccessful. 
No HRQoL evidence was identified for the MTC population.
CONCLUSIONS: The identified trials suggest that cabozantinib and vandetanib 
improve PFS more than the placebo; however, significant OS benefits were not 
demonstrated. The economic analyses indicate that within the EU-label 
population, the ICERs for cabozantinib and vandetanib are > £138,000 per QALY 
gained. Within the restricted EU-label population, the ICER for vandetanib is 
expected to be > £66,000 per QALY gained.
FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES: (1) Primary research assessing the long-term 
effectiveness of cabozantinib and vandetanib within relevant subgroups. (2) 
Reanalyses of the ZETA trial to investigate the impact of adjusting for 
open-label vandetanib use using appropriate statistical methods. (3) Studies 
assessing the impact of MTC on HRQoL.

Plain Language Summary: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare form of 
cancer that presents as a mass of tumours in the thyroid gland of the neck. MTC 
affects both patients’ health-related quality of life and survival. Targeted 
therapies (cabozantinib and vandetanib) are currently used to treat unresectable 
progressive and symptomatic MTC. The evidence for the use of cabozantinib and 
vandetanib in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC was 
reviewed, and two clinical trials were identified. The trials suggest that both 
drugs improve progression-free survival. Neither trial demonstrated significant 
survival benefits for cabozantinib or vandetanib. Both drugs produced frequent 
adverse events, often leading to dose interruption or reduction. Whether or not 
these therapies represent good value for money for the NHS was also assessed. 
Analyses indicate that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (a 
measure of cost-effectiveness) for cabozantinib and vandetanib versus best 
supportive care (BSC) in patients with symptomatic and progressive MTC are 
> £138,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Within a subgroup of 
patients with symptomatic and progressive MTC and carcinoembryonic antigen 
and/or calcitonin doubling times of ≤ 24 months, the ICER for vandetanib versus 
BSC remains > £66,000 per QALY gained.

A Review of Clinical Guidelines and Pharmacotherapeutic Management of 
Hypertension in Older Adults.

Lewis J, Gregorian T, Huntsberry AM, Tsu LV.

OBJECTIVE: To provide an up-to-date review of current hypertension (HTN) 
guidelines and discuss pharmacotherapeutic management of HTN in the older adult 
population.<br/> DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search of articles published through 
June 2018 was performed using a combination of the following words: elderly, 
older adults, geriatric, and HTN.<br/> STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant 
original research, review articles, and guidelines were assessed for the 
management of HTN in older adults. References from the above literature were 
also evaluated. Articles were selected for inclusion based on relevance to the 
topic, detailed methods, complete results, and after a thorough discussion among 
the authors.<br/> DATA SYNTHESIS: HTN is a common chronic disease state in older 
adults. Until recently, most guidelines recommended a higher threshold for blood 
pressure targets in this population, compared with the general adult population. 
In 2017, two new guidelines for the management of HTN were published, which 
provided conflicting recommendations for blood pressure goals in the older 
population. This article reviews current U. S. HTN guidelines published in 2014 
to 2017 that most commonly influence patient care, and it specifically addresses 
the blood pressure targets and pharmacotherapeutic management of HTN in older 
adults.<br/> CONCLUSION: Management of HTN in older adults is important to avoid 
further complications and improve outcomes in this population. Blood pressure 
targets and HTN management should be individualized in older adults based on 
comorbid conditions, life expectancy, and risk for adverse drug events.

Budd-Chiari syndrome and non-cirrhotic non-tumoral portal vein thrombosis are 2 
rare disorders, with several similarities that are categorized under the term 
splanchnic vein thrombosis. Both disorders are frequently associated with an 
underlying prothrombotic disorder. They can cause severe portal hypertension and 
usually affect young patients, negatively influencing life expectancy when the 
diagnosis and treatment are not performed at an early stage. Yet, they have 
specific features that require individual consideration. The current review will 
focus on the available knowledge on pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of 
both entities.

Pbx genes encode transcription factors that belong to the TALE (three-amino-acid 
loop extension) superclass of homeodomain proteins. We have witnessed a surge in 
information about the roles of this gene family as leading actors in the 
transcriptional control of development. PBX proteins represent a clear example 
of how transcription factors can regulate developmental processes by 
combinatorial properties, acting within multimeric complexes to implement 
activation or repression of transcription depending on their interaction 
partners. Here, we revisit long-emphasized functions of PBX transcription 
factors as cofactors for HOX proteins, major architects of the body plan. We 
further discuss new knowledge on roles of PBX proteins in different 
developmental contexts as upstream regulators of Hox genes-as factors that 
interact with non-HOX proteins and can work independently of HOX-as well as 
potential pioneer factors. Committed to building a perfect body, PBX proteins 
govern regulatory networks that direct essential morphogenetic processes and 
organogenesis in vertebrate development. Perturbations of PBX-dependent networks 
can cause human congenital disease and cancer.

    Am J Epidemiol. 2019 Jul 1;188(7):1213-1223.

The majority of people living with Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias 
are women. Longer life expectancy is one factor thought to contribute to this 
observation, but possible sex-specific biological mechanisms have received 
considerable attention from the research community. In the current issue of the 
Journal, Buckley et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2019;188(7):1213-1223) use death 
certificate information on all deaths occurring among adults aged ≥60 years in 
Australia between 2006 and 2014 to evaluate sex/gender differences in rates of 
death with dementia (all types), AD dementia, and vascular dementia listed on 
the death certificate. The paper by Buckley et al. highlights several important 
methodological challenges for research examining sex/gender differences in risk 
of AD and related dementias, including challenges in measurement, survival bias 
and competing risks, and selection bias arising from sample selection. The 
current evidence on possible sex-specific biological risk factors for AD is 
intriguing, but there are numerous alternative explanations for differences in 
AD dementia and AD biomarkers between women and men. Triangulation of evidence 
from study designs with different strengths and weaknesses and transdisciplinary 
collaboration will be vital to generating conclusive evidence about sex/gender 
differences in risk of AD and related dementias.

Neuromuscular impairment associated with cerebral palsy (CP) often leads to 
life-long walking deficits. Our goal was to evaluate the ability of a novel 
untethered wearable ankle exoskeleton to reduce the severity of gait pathology 
from CP. In this clinical feasibility study of five individuals with CP, we used 
instrumented gait analysis to quantify how powered plantar-flexor assistance 
affected gait mechanics following multi-visit acclimation. Compared to how each 
participant walked normally, walking with untethered exoskeleton assistance 
resulted in improved ankle plantar-flexion and knee extension; residual flexion 
deformity across the lower-extremity improved by a clinically significant 14.4° 
(p = 0.022). Powered plantar-flexor assistance increased average total positive 
ankle power by 44% (p = 0.037), and resulted in a 30% reduction in average 
negative biological ankle power (p = 0.004) and a 29% reduction in average 
positive hip power (p = 0.009). These findings suggest that powered ankle 
assistance augmented, rather than simply replaced, biological function to 
produce a more efficient gait pattern, which was corroborated by a 19% 
improvement in metabolic cost of transport (p = 0.011). This study provides 
evidence in support of the continued investigation of ankle assistance in 
mobility and rehabilitation interventions for this patient population.

The partial edentulous population is increasing because of an increasing aging 
population, increased life expectancy, and individuals retaining more teeth at 
an older age. Therefore, the need for fixed and removable partial denture (RPD) 
therapy will remain high and will continue into the future. RPDs provide 
minimally invasive, cost-effective, timely care, and are preferred to fixed 
dental prostheses using teeth or implant therapy in many clinical scenarios. 
This article discusses RPD classification systems to review basic concepts and 
special framework design considerations, and explores advancements in the field 
such as implant-assisted RPD, CAD/CAM RPD, and new polymer framework materials.

Lead is a ubiquitous dietary contaminant that occurs in food because of natural 
and anthropogenic sources and pathways of exposure. Lead adversely affects a 
number of tissues and organ systems and the severity of effect on each is 
dependent on the level and duration of exposure. The most sensitive and notable 
effects are those that occur on the nervous system. This is particularly the 
case in the exposure to the fetus, infant and child. Infants and children 
generally have higher lead exposures on a body weight basis. While lead exposure 
can come from many sources, a major source of exposure for at least some 
individuals comes from food. Estimates for the impact of dietary lead on IQ were 
developed from published total diet studies. While most of these were designed 
to characterize intake of chemical contaminants on a national basis, some 
sampled market baskets from a single city. To develop global estimates, default 
ranges were created for countries with no data which encompassed the values 
encountered elsewhere. Blood lead levels and IQ decrements were estimated using 
functions previously developed by the WHO Joint Expert Committee for Food 
Additives. Since both the exposure and dose response components were variable 
and uncertain, a two dimensional Monte-Carlo simulation was used to develop the 
estimates for the impact of dietary lead on IQ. In addition to estimating blood 
lead and IQ decrements attributable to dietary lead from those countries with 
published market basket data, simulations were also run for WHO regions that 
sampled in the variability dimension based on the population size of the 
individual countries in each region. Dietary exposure to lead occurs throughout 
the world. The global average IQ decrement attributable to dietary lead was 1.1. 
The total number of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) arising from those IQ 
decrements were estimated to be 5.2 million DALYs, with an uncertainty range of 
0-31 million DALYs. Significant uncertainties regarding exposure and 
dose-response relationships, however, warrant continued investigation.

INTRODUCTION: Approximately 400 000 Americans and 36 000 Canadians undergo 
cardiac surgery annually, and up to 56% will develop chronic postsurgical pain 
(CPSP). The primary aim of this study is to explore the association of 
pain-related beliefs and gender-based pain expectations on the development of 
CPSP. Secondary goals are to: (A) explore risk factors for poor functional 
status and patient-level cost of illness from a societal perspective up to 12 
months following cardiac surgery; and (B) determine the impact of CPSP on 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) borne by cardiac surgery, in addition to the 
incremental cost for one additional QALY gained, among those who develop CPSP 
compared with those who do not.
METHODS AND ANALYSES: In this prospective cohort study, 1250 adults undergoing 
cardiac surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting and open-heart 
procedures, will be recruited over a 3-year period. Putative risk factors for 
CPSP will be captured prior to surgery, at postoperative day 3 (in hospital) and 
day 30 (at home). Outcome data will be collected via telephone interview at 
6-month and 12-month follow-up. We will employ generalised estimating equations 
to model the primary (CPSP) and secondary outcomes (function and cost) while 
adjusting for prespecified model covariates. QALYs will be estimated by 
converting data from the Short Form-12 (version 2) to a utility score.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been approved by the responsible 
bodies at each of the hospital sites, and study enrolment began May 2015. We 
will disseminate our results through CardiacPain.Net, a web-based knowledge 
dissemination platform, presentation at international conferences and 
publications in scientific journals.

PURPOSE: To investigate statin use in the elderly by age (≥ 80 vs. 65-79 years) 
in relation to established indications.
METHODS: A population-based cohort, including data from four registers, 
encompassing inhabitants in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden, was used. Statin 
users were defined as those filling statin prescriptions ≥ 75% of the year 2010. 
Primary care and hospital diagnoses in 2005-2010 regarding ischemic heart 
disease, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, and diabetes were considered 
established indications.
RESULTS: A total of 278,205 individuals were analyzed. In individuals aged ≥ 80 
and 65-79 years (n = 81,885 and n = 196,320, respectively), 17% (95% confidence 
interval 17%; 18%) and 23% (23%; 23%) respectively, were statin users. Among the 
statin users, 74% (73%; 74%) of those aged ≥ 80 and 60% (59%; 60%) of those aged 
65-79 years had ≥ 1 established indication. Conversely, of those with ≥ 1 
established indication, 30% (30%; 31%) and 53% (52%; 53%) were on statins in the 
respective age groups. Logistic regression revealed that age, nursing home 
residence, and multi-dose drug dispensing were the most prominent negative 
predictors for statin use; adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval): 0.45 
(0.44; 0.46), 0.39 (0.36; 0.42), and 0.47 (0.44; 0.49), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In the oldest old (≥ 80 years), statin users were fewer and had 
more often an established indication, suggesting that physicians extrapolate 
scientific evidence for beneficial effects in younger age groups to the oldest, 
but require a more solid ground for treatment. As the oldest old, nursing home 
residents, and those with multi-dose drug-dispensing were statin users to a 
lesser extent, physicians may often refrain from treatment in those with lower 
life expectancy, either due to age or to severely reduced health status. In both 
age groups, our results however also indicate some over- as well as 
undertreatment.

Screening for Barrett's Esophagus: Balancing Clinical Value and 
Cost-effectiveness.

In predisposed individuals with long standing gastroesophageal reflux disease 
(GERD), esophageal squamous mucosa can transform into columnar mucosa with 
intestinal metaplasia, commonly called Barrett's esophagus (BE). Barrett's 
mucosa can develop dysplasia, which can be a precursor for esophageal 
adenocarcinoma (EAC). However, most EAC cases are identified when esophageal 
symptoms develop, without prior BE or GERD diagnoses. While several 
gastrointestinal societies have published BE screening guidelines, these vary, 
and many recommendations are not based on high quality evidence. These 
guidelines are concordant in recommending targeted screening of predisposed 
individuals (eg, long standing GERD symptoms with age > 50 years, male sex, 
Caucasian race, obesity, and family history of BE or EAC), and against 
population based screening, or screening of GERD patients without risk factors. 
Targeted endoscopic screening programs provide earlier diagnosis of high grade 
dysplasia and EAC, and offer potential for endoscopic therapy, which can improve 
prognosis and outcome. On the other hand, endoscopic screening of the general 
population, unselected GERD patients, patients with significant comorbidities or 
patients with limited life expectancy is not cost-effective. New screening 
modalities, some of which do not require endoscopy, have the potential to reduce 
costs and expand access to screening for BE.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) Type 3 may exhibit both 
primitive deformities and secondary fracture malunions on a femoral level. The 
orthopaedic surgeon's objective is to cure the deformities in order to prevent 
fractures and to treat the fractures in order to prevent deformities, by using 
telescopic nails as the gold standard method of fixation. However, the titanium 
elastic nail (TEN) is indicated as a possible alternative in certain selected 
cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Centre for Congenital Osteodystrophy of the Sapienza 
University of Rome follows 485 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. For the 
purpose of this study, we selected 36 patients with OI type 3 (15 females and 21 
males), aged between 2 and 10 years old, who were surgically treated for femur 
fractures with Titanium Elastic Nail (TEN) from January 2007 to December 2009. 
In 12 cases a single TEN was implanted, while 24 of the cases were treated by 
implanting 2 TENs with the Sliding Nail (SN) technique. A retrospective 
evaluation was carried out by analysing the data from the medical charts and 
dossiers related to pain symptoms, knee and hip Range of Motion (ROM), any 
possible complications that could cause implant revisions (infections, nail 
slide failure, nail migration, traumatic events following surgery, delayed 
consolidation, epiphysiodesis).
RESULTS: At the 60th post-surgical month, the revision rate was 75%, mostly due 
to migration, osteolysis, nail slide failure and nail fracture. The
