BACKGROUND: Obesity has become the main health issue in developed countries as 
it impacts life expectancy and increases mortality of cerebrovascular or 
cardiovascular diseases. The leptin is one of the adipokines which presents in 
the serum in proportion to the amount of adipose tissue and is translated from 
LEP gene. It involves in energy homeostasis, lipid and glucose metabolisms, 
modulation of immune systems, and thermogenesis. Many previous studies have 
revealed controversial results between LEP polymorphisms and leptin levels in 
different ages and ethnicities. Herein, we investigated the impacts of LEP 
polymorphism against leptin levels in Taiwanese subjects.
METHODS: In 599 Taiwanese subjects, excluding clinically overt systemic disease, 
age below 18 years old, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of above 10 mg/L, few 
of LEP polymorphisms were genotyped with TaqMan SNP genotyping assays, were 
further analyzed for association with leptin level in univariate and 
multivariate linear regression analyses with Bonferroni correction for multiple 
tests in stratified groups. The univariate and stepwise multivariate linear 
regression analyses were performed to determine the coefficient of determinant 
of LEP polymorphisms over leptin level.
RESULTS: Significant associations were found between LEP polymorphisms and 
leptin levels in obese women. Circulating leptin level was positively correlated 
with inflammatory, insulin resistance markers, and visceral obesity markers in 
all subjects. Furthermore, stratified and interaction analyses revealed that LEP 
polymorphisms, rs7799039 and rs2167270, were significantly associated with 
leptin levels in obese women-8%-10% of which could be explained by LEP 
polymorphisms.
CONCLUSION: The LEP polymorphisms are independently associated with leptin 
levels in Taiwanese obese women. Further, the genetic determinants for leptin 
levels may be different between obese and nonobese, and in different sex 
individuals. The obesity status and female sex may exert modification effect on 
transcription of LEP, particularly in obese women.

From 1987 to 2017, cardiovascular disease (CVD) had been ranking the first cause 
of death in Suzhou, and the mortality rate showed an upward trend annual 
percentage changes (APC=0.62%, P=0.001), while the standardized mortality rate 
showed a downward trend (APC=-2.65%, P<0.001). The probability of premature 
death of CVD declined consistently from 7.06% in 1987 to 2.00% in 2017 
(APC=-4.45%, P<0.001). When the life expectancy was set at 70, the potential 
years of life lost rate (PYLLR) decreased from 6.35‰ in 1987 to 3.30‰ in 2017, 
and the standardized PYLLR decreased from 7.30‰ to 2.68‰. When the life 
expectancy was set at 75, the PYLLR decreased from 10.12‰ to 5.19‰, and the 
standardized PYLLR decreased from 11.44‰ to 3.88‰. With the increase of years, 
all PYLLR and standardized PYLLR showed a significantly downward trend 
(APC=-2.51%--3.89%, P<0.001).

Acute environmental hypoxia may potentiate muscle hypertrophy in response to 
resistance training but the mechanisms are still unknown. To this end, twenty 
subjects performed a 1-leg knee extension session (8 sets of 8 repetitions at 
80% 1 repetition maximum, 2-min rest between sets) in normoxic or normobaric 
hypoxic conditions (FiO2 14%). Muscle biopsies were taken 15 min and 4 hours 
after exercise in the vastus lateralis of the exercised and the non-exercised 
legs. Blood samples were taken immediately, 2h and 4h after exercise. In vivo, 
hypoxic exercise fostered acute inflammation mediated by the 
TNFα/NF-κB/IL-6/STAT3 (+333%, +194%, + 163% and +50% respectively) pathway, 
which has been shown to contribute to satellite cells myogenesis. Inflammation 
activation was followed by skeletal muscle invasion by CD68 (+63%) and CD197 
(+152%) positive immune cells, both known to regulate muscle regeneration. The 
role of hypoxia-induced activation of inflammation in myogenesis was confirmed 
in vitro. Acute hypoxia promoted myogenesis through increased Myf5 (+300%), MyoD 
(+88%), myogenin (+1816%) and MRF4 (+489%) mRNA levels in primary myotubes and 
this response was blunted by siRNA targeting STAT3. In conclusion, our results 
suggest that hypoxia could improve muscle hypertrophic response following 
resistance exercise through IL-6/STAT3-dependent myogenesis and immune 
cells-dependent muscle regeneration.

AIMS: The role of tea consumption in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease remains unclear in cohort studies. This prospective 
cohort study aimed to investigate the associations of tea consumption with the 
risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.
METHODS: We included 100,902 general Chinese adults from the project of 
Prediction for ASCVD Risk in China (China-PAR) in 15 provinces across China 
since 1998. Information on tea consumption was collected through standardized 
questionnaires. Outcomes were identified by interviewing study participants or 
their proxies, and checking hospital records and/or death certificates. Cox 
proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios and 
their corresponding 95% confidence intervals related to tea consumption.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.3 years, 3683 atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease events, 1477 atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
deaths, and 5479 all-cause deaths were recorded. Compared with never or 
non-habitual tea drinkers, the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval among 
habitual tea drinkers was 0.80 (0.75-0.87), 0.78 (0.69-0.88), and 0.85 
(0.79-0.90) for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease incidence, 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease mortality, and all-cause mortality, 
respectively. Habitual tea drinkers had 1.41 years longer of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease-free years and 1.26 years longer of life expectancy at 
the index age of 50 years. The observed inverse associations were strengthened 
among participants who kept the habit during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: Tea consumption was associated with reduced risks of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, especially among those 
consistent habitual tea drinkers.

Neurodegenerative diseases are a leading apprehension in underdeveloped and 
developed countries. The advancement of medical science is synonymous with an 
increase in life expectancy, which results in an aging population. 
Neurodegenerative diseases in the older population are on the rise globally. 
This review sums up the novel therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's disease. Although most neurodegenerative diseases occur due to the 
accumulation of misfolded proteins, the mechanisms are not completely 
understood. Currently, only prophylactic therapies are available and none are 
preventive in nature. The World Health Organisation estimates that 
neurodegenerative diseases that cause cognitive and motor impairments will be 
the second most ubiquitous cause of death in the next decade, hence the need for 
novel therapeutic targets for these diseases is demanded. In Alzheimer's, 
β-amyloid and tau proteinopathies are prevalent, whereas a prion-like increase 
of α- synuclein is the characteristic trait of Parkinson's disease.

BACKGROUND: Pectin methylesterase (PME) is a hydrolytic enzyme that catalyzes 
the demethylesterification of homogalacturonans and controls pectin 
reconstruction, being essential in regulation of cell wall modification. During 
fruit ripening stage, PME-mediated cell wall remodeling is an important process 
to determine fruit firmness and softening. Strawberry fruit is a soft fruit with 
a short postharvest life, due to a rapid loss of firm texture. Hence, preharvest 
improvement of strawberry fruit rigidity is a prerequisite for extension of 
fruit refreshing time. Although PME has been well characterized in model plants, 
knowledge regarding the functionality and evolutionary property of PME gene 
family in strawberry remain limited.
RESULTS: A total of 54 PME genes (FvPMEs) were identified in woodland strawberry 
(Fragaria vesca 'Hawaii 4'). Phylogeny and gene structure analysis divided these 
FvPME genes into four groups (Group 1-4). Duplicate events analysis suggested 
that tandem and dispersed duplications effectively contributed to the expansion 
of the PME family in strawberry. Through transcriptome analysis, we identified 
FvPME38 and FvPME39 as the most abundant-expressed PMEs at fruit ripening 
stages, and they were positively regulated by abscisic acid. Genetic 
manipulation of FvPME38 and FvPME39 by overexpression and RNAi-silencing 
significantly influences the fruit firmness, pectin content and cell wall 
structure, indicating a requirement of PME for strawberry fruit softening.
CONCLUSION: Our study globally analyzed strawberry pectin methylesterases by the 
approaches of phylogenetics, evolutionary prediction and genetic analysis. We 
verified the essential role of FvPME38 and FvPME39 in regulation of strawberry 
fruit softening process, which provided a guide for improving strawberry fruit 
firmness by modifying PME level.

OBJECTIVE: To examine how a healthy lifestyle is related to life expectancy that 
is free from major chronic diseases.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The Nurses' Health Study (1980-2014; n=73 196) and the 
Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2014; n=38 366).
MAIN EXPOSURES: Five low risk lifestyle factors: never smoking, body mass index 
18.5-24.9, moderate to vigorous physical activity (≥30 minutes/day), moderate 
alcohol intake (women: 5-15 g/day; men 5-30 g/day), and a higher diet quality 
score (upper 40%).
MAIN OUTCOME: Life expectancy free of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and 
cancer.
RESULTS: The life expectancy free of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and 
cancer at age 50 was 23.7 years (95% confidence interval 22.6 to 24.7) for women 
who adopted no low risk lifestyle factors, in contrast to 34.4 years (33.1 to 
35.5) for women who adopted four or five low risk factors. At age 50, the life 
expectancy free of any of these chronic diseases was 23.5 (22.3 to 24.7) years 
among men who adopted no low risk lifestyle factors and 31.1 (29.5 to 32.5) 
years in men who adopted four or five low risk lifestyle factors. For current 
male smokers who smoked heavily (≥15 cigarettes/day) or obese men and women 
(body mass index ≥30), their disease-free life expectancies accounted for the 
lowest proportion (≤75%) of total life expectancy at age 50.
CONCLUSION: Adherence to a healthy lifestyle at mid-life is associated with a 
longer life expectancy free of major chronic diseases.

BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) has historically produced 
estimates of causes of injury such as falls but not the resulting types of 
injuries that occur. The objective of this study was to estimate the global 
incidence, prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) due to facial 
fractures and to estimate the leading injurious causes of facial fracture.
METHODS: We obtained results from GBD 2017. First, the study estimated the 
incidence from each injury cause (eg, falls), and then the proportion of each 
cause that would result in facial fracture being the most disabling injury. 
Incidence, prevalence and YLDs of facial fractures are then calculated across 
causes.
RESULTS: Globally, in 2017, there were 7 538 663 (95% uncertainty interval 6 116 
489 to 9 493 113) new cases, 1 819 732 (1 609 419 to 2 091 618) prevalent cases, 
and 117 402 (73 266 to 169 689) YLDs due to facial fractures. In terms of 
age-standardised incidence, prevalence and YLDs, the global rates were 98 (80 to 
123) per 100 000, 23 (20 to 27) per 100 000, and 2 (1 to 2) per 100 000, 
respectively. Facial fractures were most concentrated in Central Europe. Falls 
were the predominant cause in most regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Facial fractures are predominantly caused by falls and occur 
worldwide. Healthcare systems and public health agencies should investigate 
methods of all injury prevention. It is important for healthcare systems in 
every part of the world to ensure access to treatment resources.

BACKGROUND: Vietnam has been one of the fastest-growing world economies in the 
past decade. The burden of injuries can be affected by economic growth given the 
increased exposure to causes of injury as well as decreased morbidity and 
mortality of those that experience injury. It is of interest to evaluate the 
trends in injury burden that occurred alongside Vietnam's economic growth in the 
past decade.
METHODS: Results from Global Burden of Disease 2017 were obtained and reviewed. 
Estimates of incidence, cause-specific mortality, years lived with disability, 
years of life lost, disability-adjusted life years were analysed and reported 
for 30 causes of injury in Vietnam from 2007 to 2017.
RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2017, the age-standardised incidence rate of all 
injuries increased by 14.6% (11.5%-18.2%), while the age-standardised mortality 
rate decreased by 11.6% (3.0%-20.2%). Interpersonal violence experienced the 
largest increase in age-standardised incidence (28.3% (17.6%-40.1%)), while 
exposure to forces of nature had the largest decrease in age-standardised 
mortality (47.1% (37.9%-54.6%)). The five leading causes of injury in both 2007 
and 2017 were road injuries, falls, exposure to mechanical forces, interpersonal 
violence and other unintentional injuries, all of which increased in incidence 
from 2007 to 2017. Injury burden varied markedly by age and sex.
CONCLUSIONS: The rapid expansions of economic growth in Vietnam as well as 
improvements in the Sociodemographic Index have occurred alongside dynamic 
patterns in injury burden. These results should be used to develop and implement 
prevention and treatment programme.

BACKGROUND: Nepal is a low-income country undergoing rapid political, economic 
and social development. To date, there has been little evidence published on the 
burden of injuries during this period of transition.
METHODS: The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) is a comprehensive measurement 
of population health outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality. We analysed 
the GBD 2017 estimates for deaths, years of life lost, years lived with 
disability, incidence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from injuries 
to ascertain the burden of injuries in Nepal from 1990 to 2017.
RESULTS: There were 16 831 (95% uncertainty interval 13 323 to 20 579) deaths 
caused by injuries (9.21% of all-cause deaths (7.45% to 11.25%)) in 2017 while 
the proportion of deaths from injuries was 6.31% in 1990. Overall, the 
injury-specific age-standardised mortality rate declined from 88.91 (71.54 to 
105.31) per 100 000 in 1990 to 70.25 (56.75 to 85.11) per 100 000 in 2017. In 
2017, 4.11% (2.47% to 6.10%) of all deaths in Nepal were attributed to transport 
injuries, 3.54% (2.86% to 4.08%) were attributed to unintentional injuries and 
1.55% (1.16% to 1.85%) were attributed to self-harm and interpersonal violence. 
From 1990 to 2017, road injuries, falls and self-harm all rose in rank for all 
causes of death.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in injury-related deaths and DALYs in Nepal between 
1990 and 2017 indicates the need for further research and prevention 
interventions. Injuries remain an important public health burden in Nepal with 
the magnitude and trend of burden varying over time by cause-specific, sex and 
age group. Findings from this study may be used by the federal, provincial and 
local governments in Nepal to prioritise injury prevention as a public health 
agenda and as evidence for country-specific interventions.
