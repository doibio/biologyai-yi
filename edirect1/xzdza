Although sarcopenia has been dealt with in several studies, the standardized 
guidelines for preventing sarcopenia resulting from increased life expectancy 
are still insufficient. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of daily 
resistance exercise and the intake of leucine-rich protein supplements daily for 
12 weeks on the body composition and physical function of healthy adults aged 
>50 years living in Korea. The study analyzed 50 healthy people without medical 
conditions, who were randomly assigned to two groups (taking either protein 
powder or placebo powder) twice a day for 12 weeks. All participants performed 
resistance exercises regularly that could be repeated 8−12 times using a 
TheraBand for 12 weeks. A total of 41 participants completed the study. When 
measured via bioimpedance analysis (BIA), body fat mass (kg) and body fat (%) 
significantly decreased, and lean body mass (LBM) (kg) and skeletal muscle mass 
(SMM) (kg) significantly increased, in both groups. However, when measured via 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), LBM was significantly increased only in 
the protein powder group. The LBM and SMM change measured via BIA was 
significantly greater in the protein powder group than in the placebo powder 
group (LBM: 0.95 ± 0.91 kg in the protein powder group vs. 0.38 ± 1.06 kg in the 
placebo powder group, p = 0.043; SMM: 0.69 ± 0.58 kg in the protein powder group 
vs. 0.29 ± 0.65 kg in the placebo powder group, p = 0.039, respectively). In the 
senior fitness test (SFT), significant functional improvement was found within 
the two groups, but no significant difference was found between the groups in 
the degree of improvement. In conclusion, in older people aged >50, to prevent 
sarcopenia, is more effective to combine resistance exercise and leucine-rich 
protein supplementation than to simply perform resistance exercise.

This review summarizes the main pancreatic diseases from a nutritional approach. 
Nutrition is a cornerstone of pancreatic disease and is sometimes undervalued. 
An early identification of malnutrition is the first step in maintaining an 
adequate nutritional status in acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis and 
pancreatic cancer. Following a proper diet is a pillar in the treatment of 
pancreatic diseases and, often, nutritional counseling becomes essential. In 
addition, some patients will require oral nutritional supplements and 
fat-soluble vitamins to combat certain deficiencies. Other patients will require 
enteral nutrition by nasoenteric tube or total parenteral nutrition in order to 
maintain the requirements, depending on the pathology and its consequences. 
Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, defined as a significant decrease in 
pancreatic enzymes or bicarbonate until the digestive function is impaired, is 
common in pancreatic diseases and is the main cause of malnutrition. Pancreatic 
enzymes therapy allows for the management of these patients. Nutrition can 
improve the nutritional status and quality of life of these patients and may 
even improve life expectancy in patients with pancreatic cancer. For this 
reason, nutrition must maintain the importance it deserves.

BACKGROUND: The benefits of hepatitis C virus (HCV)eradication for 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 
stage B/C remain uncertain.
METHODS: In this hospital-based cohort study, all HCV-infected patients with 
BCLC stage B/C HCC during the period January 2017 to March 2021 were 
retrospectively screened, with 97 patients who had completed direct-acting 
antiviral (DAA) therapy being enrolled for final analysis.
RESULTS: In total, the sustained virological response (SVR) rate was 90.7%. In 
logistic regression analysis, progressive disease (PD) to prior tumor treatments 
was significantly associated with SVR failure (odds ratio 5.59, 95% CI 
1.30-24.06, p = 0.021). Furthermore, the overall survival (OS) rate was 
significantly higher in the SVR group than that in the non-SVR group (1-year OS: 
87.5% vs. 57.1%, p = 0.001). SVR was found to be an independent factor related 
to OS (hazard ratio 8.42, 95% CI 2.93-24.19, p = 0.001). However, even upon 
achieving SVR, the OS rates in BCLC stage C or Child-Pugh stage B patients 
remained poor.
CONCLUSIONS: In BCLC stage B/C HCC, DAA could achieve a high SVR rate except in 
those patients with PD to prior HCC treatments. SVR was related to improvements 
in OS; therefore, DAA therapy should be encouraged for patients diagnosed 
without a short life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Prognostic information, which consists of life expectancy, 
functional prognosis, and uncertainty, of cancer patients is essential. However, 
the evidence regarding the prognostic preferences of cancer patients is limited. 
To clarify the prognostic preferences of cancer patients and whether cancer 
patients want to be informed about their prognosis.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based anonymous survey through a 
private survey company in January 2022. We assessed whether patients would 
prefer to be informed about their life expectancy and functional prognosis, and 
explored correlations between patients' backgrounds.
RESULTS: A total of 132 patients responded to the survey. The mean age was 
63.1±9.3, and 67 (50.8%) were male. The most frequent primary tumor was 
gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary and pancreatic (n=43, 32.6%). Among the patients, 
26.6% answered "Strongly agree" or "Agree" to wanting to be informed about their 
life expectancy, and 33.6-46.9%. wanted to be informed of their functional 
prognosis. Experience of a family member that had died from cancer had a 
significant correlation with the preference to be informed about "Life 
expectancy" (rs=0.344, P<0.001), "Moving freely" (rs=0.210, P=0.016), and 
"Proper communication" (rs=0.344, P=0.038).
CONCLUSIONS: More cancer patients wanted to be informed about their functional 
prognosis than their life expectancy. In addition, the experience of a family 
member that had died of cancer had a significant correlation with the preference 
for wanting to be informed about their life expectancy and functional prognosis.

OBJECTIVES: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a vital instrument to 
account for individuals' well-being in various settings. However, no model of 
HRQoL allows for examining the effect of digital technology on HRQoL. Therefore, 
we extend an established HRQoL model by adding a digital technology-related 
construct. We refer to this extension as the technology-affected health-related 
quality of life (TA-HRQoL).
METHODS: We investigate the extended TA-HRQoL model through a survey. In the 
survey, we exemplify the use of digital technology through a device for 
self-managing bladder dysfunction. Hence, we explore whether the model extension 
proposed is valid and how determinants of the HRQoL affect patients with bladder 
dysfunction.
RESULTS: The results indicate that the use of digital technology improves the 
HRQoL. In our exemplary use scenario, the digital technology decreases 
bladder-related functional impairments and increases well-being and life 
satisfaction directly.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study may provide evidence for the influence of digital 
technologies on the HRQoL, thus supporting our model extension. We consider our 
proposed TA-HRQoL model as valid and as useful to account for the influence of 
digital technology on an individual's HRQoL. With the TA-HRQoL model, the impact 
of a digital technology on an individual's HRQoL can be assessed.

Research on Black-White disparities in mortality emphasizes the cumulative 
pathways through which racism gets "under the skin" to affect health. Yet this 
framing is less applicable in early life, when death is primarily attributable 
to external causes rather than cumulative, biological processes. We use 
mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System Multiple Cause of Death 
files and population counts from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result 
Program to analyze 705,801 deaths among Black and White males and females, ages 
15-24. We estimate age-standardized death rates and single-decrement life tables 
to show how all-cause and cause-specific mortality changed from 1990 to 2016 by 
race and sex. Despite overall declines in early-life mortality, Black-White 
disparities remain unchanged across several causes-especially homicide, for 
which mortality is nearly 20 times as high among Black as among White males. 
Suicide and drug-related deaths are higher among White youth during this period, 
yet their impact on life expectancy at birth is less than half that of homicide 
among Black youth. Critically, early-life disparities are driven by preventable 
causes of death whose impact occurs "outside the skin," reflecting racial 
differences in social exposures and experiences that prove harmful for both 
Black and White adolescents and young adults.

This paper analyses the influence of several determinants on life expectancy at 
birth in 36 OECD countries over the 1999-2018 period. We utilized a 
cross-country fixed-effects multiple regression analysis with year and country 
dummies and used dynamic models, backward stepwise selection, and Arellano-Bond 
estimators to treat potential endogeneity issues. The results show the influence 
of per capita health-care expenditure, incidence of out-of-pocket expenditure, 
physician density, hospital bed density, social spending, GDP level, 
participation ratio to labour, prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases, 
temperature, and total size of the population on life expectancy at birth. In 
line with previous studies, this analysis confirms the relevance of both health 
care expenditure and health care system (physicians and hospital beds in our 
analysis) in influencing a country's population life expectancy. It also 
outlines the importance of other factors related to population behaviour and 
social spending jointly considered on this outcome. Policy makers should 
carefully consider these mutual influences when allocating public funds, 
particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic period.

PURPOSE: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with other organ invasions is 
directly related to patient prognosis and quality of life; however, studies on 
the clinical outcomes of adjuvant radioactive iodine (RAI) for PTC with other 
organ invasions are limited. This study aimed to clarify the clinical outcomes 
and prognostic factors for patients with PTC with other organ invasions after 
adjuvant RAI.
METHODS: Patients with PTC with other organ invasions without distant metastases 
who underwent surgery and adjuvant RAI were retrospectively reviewed. We 
evaluated the initial responses based on the American Thyroid Association 
guidelines and survival rates. Prognostic factors for locoregional 
recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) were analyzed.
RESULTS: Between January 2005 and December 2019, 102 patients were included in 
the study. Their median age was 55 years. The median follow-up duration was 92 
months (range; 30-231 months). The excellent response rate after RAI was 42%. 
The 7-year overall survival, LRRFS, and recurrence-free survival rates were 
100%, 75%, and 75%, respectively. Metastatic lymph node size, resection margin 
status, and post-RAI suppressed thyroglobulin level were the independent 
prognostic factors for LRRFS.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that 75% of patients with PTC with other organ 
invasions could achieve long-term survival without recurrence after adjuvant 
RAI. Future development of effective treatment strategies for large metastatic 
lymph nodes, gross residual tumors, and high serum thyroglobulin levels is 
warranted.

IMPORTANCE: Adult hearing screening is not routinely performed, and most 
individuals with hearing loss (HL) have never had their hearing tested as 
adults.
OBJECTIVE: To project the monetary value of future research clarifying 
uncertainties around the optimal adult hearing screening schedule.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this economic evaluation, a validated 
decision model of HL (DeciBHAL-US: Decision model of the Burden of Hearing loss 
Across the Lifespan) was used to simulate current detection and treatment of HL 
vs hearing screening schedules. Key model inputs included HL incidence 
(0.06%-10.42%/y), hearing aid uptake (0.54%-8.14%/y), screening effectiveness 
(1.62 × hearing aid uptake), utility benefits of hearing aids (+0.11), and 
hearing aid device costs ($3690). Distributions to model parameters for 
probabilistic uncertainty analysis were assigned. The expected value of perfect 
information (EVPI) and expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) 
using a willingness to pay of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was 
estimated. The EVPI and EVPPI estimate the upper bound of the dollar value of 
future research. This study was based on 40-year-old persons over their 
remaining lifetimes in a US primary care setting.
EXPOSURES: Screening schedules beginning at ages 45, 55, 65, and 75 years, and 
frequencies of every 1 or 5 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were QALYs and costs (2020 US 
dollars) from a health system perspective.
RESULTS: The average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for yearly screening 
beginning at ages 55 to 75 years ranged from $39 200 to $80 200/QALY. Yearly 
screening beginning at age 55 years was the optimal screening schedule in 38% of 
probabilistic uncertainty analysis simulations. The population EVPI, or value of 
reducing all uncertainty, was $8.2 to $12.6 billion varying with willingness to 
pay and the EVPPI, or value of reducing all screening effectiveness uncertainty, 
was $2.4 billion.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this economic evaluation of US adult hearing 
screening, large uncertainty around the optimal adult hearing screening schedule 
was identified. Future research on hearing screening has a high potential value 
so is likely justified.

OBJECTIVE: The GOG 281/LOGS trial found that trametinib prolonged 
progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with recurrent low-grade serous 
ovarian cancer (LGSOC), compared with standard of care (SOC). The current study 
aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of trametinib versus standard of care 
for recurrent LGSOC from the US payer perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was adopted to compare the cost and effectiveness of 
trametinib and standard of care group in patients with recurrent LGSOC. Life 
years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. One-way, and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the model robustness.
RESULT: Trametinib group provided an additional 0.58 QALYs (1.14 LYs) and an 
incremental cost of $248,214 compared with the SOC group. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $424,097 per QALY. The results of one-way 
sensitivity analyses suggested that our model was sensitive to the hazard ratio 
of OS and PFS between trametinib and SOC group, utility of PFS and the cycle 
cost of trametinib. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses revealed that there was 
6% probability of the trametinib group being cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: From the US payer perspective, trametinib is not cost-effective for 
patients with recurrent LGSOC at the assumed WTP threshold of $150,000 per QALY. 
Based on the value standpoint, price reduction of trametinib is expected to 
improve the cost-effectiveness of trametinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC.

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is associated with a wide range of socioeconomic and 
health-related problems, as well as 10-25 potential life-years lost. While 
lifestyle choices, comorbidities, and choice of medication are associated with 
schizophrenia disease burden and mortality, real-world evidence on the impact of 
these factors on expected life-years among patients with schizophrenia is 
limited.
METHODS: In this study, register-based, nationwide data from patients with 
schizophrenia in Finland during 1972-2015 were analysed to determine influential 
factors associated with mortality and to demonstrate their impact on expected 
life-years in patients with schizophrenia.
RESULTS: Factors reducing all-cause mortality were use of antipsychotics: HR 
0.46 (95 % CI: 0.45, 0.47), ever use of lipid-modifying agents: HR 0.71 (95 % CI 
0.68, 0.73), antidepressants HR 0.87 (95 % CI 0.85, 0.90), and lithium HR 0.90 
(95 % CI 0.86, 0.95). Factors increasing all-cause mortality were cardiovascular 
disease: HR 2.41 (95 % CI: 2.34, 2.49), liver disease: HR 1.98 (95 % CI: 1.78, 
2.21), renal disease: HR 1.63 (95 % CI:1.56, 1.70), diabetes: HR 1.40 (95 % 
C:1.35, 1.45), history of switching antipsychotics: HR 1.39 (95 % CI: 1.35, 
1.44), longer duration of previous hospitalisations HR 1.96 (95 % CI: 1.90, 
2.02), history of substance abuse HR 1.38 (95 % CI: 1.30, 1.46), and ever use of 
benzodiazepines HR 1.12 (95 % CI: 1.09, 1.16).
CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study could serve to motivate clinicians to 
support and encourage patients to adhere to antipsychotic treatment and achieve 
a healthier lifestyle, which could, in turn, increase the expected life-years of 
patients with schizophrenia.

Vermicomposting is an eco-friendly way to manage agricultural wastes. Maize 
stover and cow dung were used as the substrates. Earthworm ingestion and 
respiration models were employed to quantify earthworm contributions to carbon 
mineralization. Decreased substrate C/N and slightly increased earthworm tissue 
C/N were observed. Earthworm biomass carbon first increased and then decreased. 
Bacterial biomass carbon decreased, while fungi increased and maintained a 
steady level until the end of the experiment. Bacteria dominated throughout the 
process. The earthworm feeding rate showed a decreasing trend. In the early, 
middle and later stages, earthworms directly led to carbon mineralization rates 
of 0.030, 0.032 and 0.023 g C m-2 month-1, and indirectly led to 0.197, 0.211 
and 0.153 g C m-2 month-1, respectively. It indicated that the driving force 
exerted by earthworms on microbes was more important. This study provides some 
new insights into the quantification of earthworm contributions to carbon 
mineralization during vermicomposting.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) in adults whose tumors expressed programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) with 
a tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 50% in the Irish healthcare setting.
METHODS: Effectiveness inputs were derived from the 5-year analysis of 
KEYNOTE-024 phase III clinical trial. The intervention was pembrolizumab 
monotherapy; the comparator was a weighted average of the 5 chemotherapy 
regimens from the trial. The population included those with previously untreated 
advanced PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% NSCLC. A de novo partitioned survival model was 
developed. Survival modeling was done using Bayesian model averaging on fitted 
parametric functions. Costs included drug acquisition, treatment initiation, 
administration and monitoring, adverse events, subsequent treatments, and 
terminal care. Costs and health state utilities were sourced from the literature 
and Irish sources. The model had a 20-year time horizon. The perspective taken 
was the Health Service Executive. A 4% discount rate was applied. Outcomes were 
expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), measured in terms 
of incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis and 1-way sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The model estimated a base case ICER of €54 237 per QALY. The 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimated an average ICER of €54 568 per QALY 
and a 11% probability of cost-effectiveness at the Irish cost-effectiveness 
threshold of €45 000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: At the current list price, first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy is 
not considered cost-effective for the treatment of advanced PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% 
NSCLC in the Irish healthcare setting.

BACKGROUND: Non-resectability is common in patients with pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) due to local invasion or distant metastases. Then, biliary 
or gastroenteric bypasses or both are often established despite associated 
morbidity and mortality. The current study explores outcomes after palliative 
bypass surgery in patients with non-resectable PDAC.
METHODS: From the prospectively maintained German StuDoQ|Pancreas registry, all 
patients with histopathologically confirmed PDAC who underwent non-resective 
pancreatic surgery between 2013 and 2018 were retrospectively identified, and 
the influence of the surgical procedure on morbidity and mortality was analyzed.
RESULTS: Of 389 included patients, 127 (32.6%) underwent explorative surgery 
only, and a biliary, gastroenteric or double bypass was established in 92 
(23.7%), 65 (16.7%) and 105 (27.0%). After exploration only, patients had a 
significantly shorter stay in the intensive care unit (mean 0.5 days [SD 1.7] 
vs. 1.9 [3.6], 2.0 [2.8] or 2.1 [2.8]; P < 0.0001) and in the hospital (median 
7 days [IQR 4-11] vs. 12 [10-18], 12 [8-19] or 12 [9-17]; P < 0.0001), and 
complications occurred less frequently (22/127 [17.3%] vs. 37/92 [40.2%], 29/65 
[44.6%] or 48/105 [45.7%]; P < 0.0001). In multivariable logistic regression, 
biliary stents were associated with less major (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ IIIa) 
complications (OR 0.49 [95% CI 0.25-0.96], P = 0.037), whereas-compared to 
exploration only-biliary, gastroenteric, and double bypass were associated with 
more major complications (OR 3.58 [1.48-8.64], P = 0.005; 3.50 [1.39-8.81], 
P = 0.008; 4.96 [2.15-11.43], P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with non-resectable PDAC, biliary, gastroenteric or 
double bypass surgery is associated with relevant morbidity and mortality. 
Although surgical palliation is indicated if interventional alternatives are 
inapplicable, or life expectancy is high, less invasive options should be 
considered.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the global burden of cataracts by year, age, region, 
gender, and socioeconomic status using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
and prevalence from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019.
METHODS: Global, regional, or national DALY numbers, crude DALY rates, and 
age-standardized DALY rates caused by cataracts, by year, age, and gender, were 
obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Socio-demographic Index 
(SDI) as a comprehensive indicator of the national or regional development 
status of GBD countries in 2019 was obtained from the GBD official website. 
Kruskal-Wallis test, linear regression, and Pearson correlation analysis were 
performed to explore the associations between the health burden with 
socioeconomic levels, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was used to investigate the 
gender disparity.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, global DALY numbers caused by cataracts rose by 
91.2%, crude rates increased by 32.2%, while age-standardized rates fell by 
11.0%. Globally, age-standardized prevalence and DALYs rates of cataracts peaked 
in 2017 and 2000, with the prevalence rate of 1283.53 [95% uncertainty interval 
(UI) 1134.46-1442.93] and DALYs rate of 94.52 (95% UI 67.09-127.24) per 100,000 
population, respectively. The burden was expected to decrease to 1232.33 (95% UI 
942.33-1522.33) and 91.52 (95% UI 87.11-95.94) by 2050. Southeast Asia had the 
highest blindness rate caused by cataracts in terms of age-standardized DALY 
rates (99.87, 95% UI: 67.18-144.25) in 2019. Gender disparity has existed since 
1990, with the female being more heavily impacted. This pattern remained with 
aging among different stages of vision impairments and varied through GBD super 
regions. Gender difference (females minus males) of age-standardized DALYs 
(equation: Y = -53.2*X + 50.0, P &lt; 0.001) and prevalence rates (equation: 
Y = - 492.8*X + 521.6, P &lt; 0.001) was negatively correlated with SDI in 
linear regression.
CONCLUSION: The global health of cataracts is improving but the steady growth in 
crude DALY rates suggested that health progress does not mean fewer demands for 
cataracts. Globally, older age, females, and lower socioeconomic status are 
associated with higher cataract burden. The findings of this study highlight the 
importance to make gender-sensitive health policies to manage global vision loss 
caused by cataracts, especially in low SDI regions.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease. The present 
study reported the burden of RA in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) 
region from 1990 to 2019 by age, sex, and socio-demographic index (SDI). 
Publicly available data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study was 
used to report the modelled point prevalence, annual incidence, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of RA, as counts and age-standardised 
rates with their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). In 2019, RA had 
an age-standardised point prevalence of 120.6 per 100,000 population 
(107.0-135.7) and an annual incidence rate of 5.9 (5.2-6.6) in MENA, which have 
increased 28.3% and 25.2%, respectively, since 1990. In 2019, the number of 
DALYs due to RA in the region was 103.6 thousand (74.2-136.7), with an 
age-standardised rate of 19.0 (13.9-24.9) DALYs per 100,000 population, which 
has increased by 18.6% since 1990 (6.7-28.2). The highest point prevalence was 
found in females aged 50-54, and in males aged 45-49. The highest number of 
DALYs was observed in the 50-54 age group. The MENA DALY rate was lower than the 
global rate (19.0 vs. 39.6 per 100,000), but the rate was higher in all age 
groups in 2019, when compared with 1990. In addition, from 1990 to 2019 an 
increased burden from RA was associated with an increase in SDI. In line with 
global trends, the burden of RA in the MENA region showed a steady increase from 
1990 to 2019. This highlights the increasing need for updating the available 
health data to design more accurate guidelines to enable the early detection and 
treatment of RA in the MENA countries.

Alcohol consumption is associated with a number of diseases and injuries, 
including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, mental and neurological disorders, 
as well as transport-related injuries. This article reports the 
alcohol-attributable burden of diseases and injuries at the regional and 
national levels in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region between 1990 
and 2019, by sex, age, underlying cause, and Socio-demographic Index (SDI). The 
regional deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to 
alcohol consumption were reported for the MENA region, between 1990 and 2019, 
using the methodological framework and analytical strategies adopted by the 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019. The estimates were all reported as 
counts, population-attributable fractions, and age-standardised rates per 
100,000 population, along with their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals 
(UIs). Also, the average annual percentage changes were used to represent the 
trends of age-standardised rates. In 2019, there were an estimated 22.0 thousand 
deaths (95% UI: 16.1-29.4) and 1.1 million DALYs (0.8-1.3) attributable to 
alcohol consumption in the MENA region. The number of DALYs attributable to 
alcohol consumption were much higher in men (878.0 thousand, 691.4-1104.8) than 
among women (181.8, 138.6-232.0). The overall age-standardised death and DALY 
rates attributable to alcohol consumption decreased by 34.5% (13.2-48.3) and 
31.9% (16.9-42.5), respectively, over the study period. Egypt (10.1 [5.7-16.6]) 
and Kuwait (1.1 [0.8-1.5]) had the highest and lowest age-standardised death 
rates attributable to alcohol consumption, respectively. In 2019, the number of 
deaths and DALYs in the MENA region were highest in those aged 60-64 and 
50-54 years, respectively. A negative association was observed between a 
country's SDI and their corresponding age-standardised DALY rates over the 
period 1990 to 2019. Digestive diseases were the main contributor to the 
alcohol-attributable burden. Over 1990-2019, the regional deaths and DALYs of 
diseases and injuries attributable to alcohol consumption decreased with AAPC of 
- 1.45 (- 1.78 to - 1.12) and - 1.31 (- 1.46 to - 1.15), respectively. The death 
and DALY rates attributable to alcohol consumption in the MENA region have 
decreased over the past three decades. Further decreases can be facilitated by 
implementing country-level policies and increasing public awareness.

Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling controls morphogenetic movements of 
gastrulation and neural tube closure.

Gastrulation and neurulation are successive morphogenetic processes that play 
key roles in shaping the basic embryonic body plan. Importantly, they operate 
through common cellular and molecular mechanisms to set up the three spatially 
organized germ layers and to close the neural tube. During gastrulation and 
neurulation, convergent extension movements driven by cell intercalation and 
oriented cell division generate major forces to narrow the germ layers along the 
mediolateral axis and elongate the embryo in the anteroposterior direction. 
Apical constriction also makes an important contribution to promote the 
formation of the blastopore and the bending of the neural plate. Planar cell 
polarity proteins are major regulators of asymmetric cell behaviors and 
critically involved in a wide variety of developmental processes, from 
gastrulation and neurulation to organogenesis. Mutations of planar cell polarity 
genes can lead to general defects in the morphogenesis of different organs and 
the co-existence of distinct congenital diseases, such as spina bifida, hearing 
deficits, kidney diseases, and limb elongation defects. This review outlines our 
current understanding of non-canonical Wnt signaling, commonly known as 
Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling, in regulating morphogenetic movements of 
gastrulation and neural tube closure during development and disease. It also 
attempts to identify unanswered questions that deserve further investigations.
