As part of its single technology appraisal (STA) process, the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer (Sanofi Genzyme) 
of sarilumab (SAR; Kevzara®) to submit evidence of its clinical effectiveness 
and cost-effectiveness for previously treated moderate or severe rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal 
Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent 
Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of the evidence 
for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the technology, based 
upon the company's submission to NICE. The clinical effectiveness evidence in 
the company's submission for SAR was based predominantly on five randomised 
controlled trials comparing the efficacy of SAR against adalimumab, tocilizumab 
or placebo. The clinical effectiveness review identified no head-to-head 
evidence on the efficacy of SAR against all the comparators within the scope. 
Therefore, the company performed three network meta-analyses (NMAs) in two 
different populations: two in patients who had had an inadequate response to 
conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) (one for 
combination therapies and one for monotherapies) and the other one in patients 
who had had an inadequate response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis). 
The company's NMAs concluded that SAR in combination with cDMARDs or as 
monotherapy has a statistically superior efficacy to cDMARDs and a comparable 
efficacy to most biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in 
both populations. The company submitted a Markov model that assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of SAR from the perspective of the National Health Service 
(NHS) and Personal Social Services in seven different populations: (1) patients 
with severe RA who have had an inadequate response to cDMARDs (cDMARD-IR); (2) 
cDMARD-IR patients with severe RA for whom methotrexate (MTX) is contraindicated 
or not tolerated; (3) patients with severe RA who have had an inadequate 
response to a TNFi (TNFi-IR); (4) TNFi-IR patients with severe RA for whom 
rituximab (RTX) is not an option; (5) TNFi-IR patients with severe RA for whom 
MTX is contraindicated or not tolerated; (6) TNFi-IR patients after RTX; and (7) 
cDMARD-IR patients with moderate RA whose 28-joint Disease Activity Score 
(DAS28) is between 4.0 and 5.1. The company's economic evaluation resulted in 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) lower than £20,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for SAR in combination with MTX or as 
monotherapy versus its comparators when the comparators were less effective, and 
it resulted in cost savings higher than £60,000 per QALY lost when SAR was less 
effective, except in TNFi-IR patients who are RTX eligible (where the ICER for 
SAR + MTX compared with RTX + MTX was £130,691 per QALY gained) and in patients 
with moderate RA and a DAS28 of > 4.0 (where the ICER of SAR + MTX compared with 
MTX was £38,254 per QALY gained). Following a critique of the model, the ERG 
undertook exploratory analyses after applying two changes to the company's 
model: (1) use of a latent class approach to model Health Assessment 
Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) progression for patients on cDMARDs; and 
(2) amendment of the company's modelling of patient progression from moderate to 
severe RA. The ICERs estimated by the ERG's exploratory analyses for SAR + MTX 
increased to £171,466 per QALY gained when compared with RTX + MTX in TNFi-IR 
patients who are RTX eligible, and to £63,438 per QALY gained when compared with 
MTX in patients with moderate RA and a DAS28 of > 4.0. The Appraisal Committee 
concluded that SAR in combination with MTX or as monotherapy is a cost-effective 
use of NHS resources in the considered populations, except in TNFi-IR patients 
who are RTX eligible and in patients with moderate RA and a DAS28 of > 4.0.

AIMS: The study objective was to develop an open-source replicate of a 
cost-effectiveness model developed by National Institute for Health and Care 
(NICE), in order to explore uncertainties in health economic modeling of novel 
pharmacological neuropathic pain treatments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The NICE model, consisting of a decision tree with 
branches for discrete levels of pain relief and adverse event (AE) severities, 
was replicated using R, and used to compare a hypothetical neuropathic pain drug 
to pregabalin. Model parameters were sourced from NICE's clinical guidelines and 
associated with probability distributions to account for underlying uncertainty. 
A simulation-based scenario analysis was conducted to assess how uncertainty in 
efficacy and AEs affected the net monetary benefit (NMB) for the hypothetical 
treatment at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY.
RESULTS: Relative to pregabalin, an increase in efficacy was associated with 
greater NMB than an improvement in tolerability. A greater NMB was observed when 
efficacy was marginally higher than that of pregabalin, while maintaining the 
same level of AEs than when efficacy was equivalent to pregabalin, but with a 
more substantial reduction in AEs. In the latter scenario, the NMB was only 
positive at a low cost-effectiveness threshold.
LIMITATIONS: The replicate model shares the limitations described in the NICE 
guidelines. There is a lack of support in scientific literature for the 
assumption that increased efficacy is associated with a greater reduction in 
tolerability. The replicate model also included a single comparator, unlike the 
NICE model.
CONCLUSIONS: Pain relief is a stronger driver of NMB than tolerability, at a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY. Health technology assessment 
decisions which are influenced by NICE's model may reward efficacy gains, even 
if they are associated with more severe AEs. This contrasts with recommendations 
from clinical guidelines for neuropathic pain, which place more equal weighting 
on improvements in efficacy and tolerability as value drivers.

BACKGROUND: Stroke has a significant disease burden in terms of acute and 
long-term disability in Italy and throughout the world. Endovascular treatments 
for the management of a stroke event have been coupled in the past years with 
the possibility to mechanically remove the occlusion by means of specially 
designed thrombectomy devices, and their exclusive use showed levels of 
effectiveness in line with those of the existing pharmacological treatments.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) with 
the Solitaire Revascularization Device (stent retriever) for the treatment of 
acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in patients with large vessel occlusions (LVOs), 
comparing MT plus intravenous tissue plasminogen activation (MT plus IV t-PA) vs 
IV t-PA alone, in Italy.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate costs and benefits of MT plus IV 
t-PA and IV t-PA alone over a 5-year time horizon and considering the 
perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS). Results are reported 
in terms of Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses are carried out in order to test the 
robustness of the results.
RESULTS: Total costs of MT plus IV t-PA and IV t-PA alone are equal to €31,798 
and €34,855, respectively. The MT allows incremental QALYs for 0.77, determining 
a dominant ICER. The utilities associated to the mRS health states are the 
parameters with the highest impact on the results. Multiway sensitivity analyses 
determined a 90% probability of dominance.
CONCLUSIONS: MT plus IV t-PA for AIS patients with LVO is cost-effective from 
year 1 through year 3, and cost-saving from year 4 onward in the Italian 
context, achieving better results, both in terms of efficacy and in terms of 
resource consumption.

Health and sociological indicators alert that life expectancy is increasing, 
hence so are the years that patients have to live with chronic diseases and 
co-morbidities. With the advancement in ICT, new tools and paradigms are been 
explored to provide effective and efficient health care. Telemedicine and health 
sensors stand as indispensable tools for promoting patient engagement, 
self-management of diseases and assist doctors to remotely follow up patients. 
In this paper, we evaluate a rapid prototyping solution for information merging 
based on five health sensors and two low-cost ubiquitous computing components: 
Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Our study, which is entirely described with the 
purpose of reproducibility, aimed to evaluate the extent to which portable 
technologies are capable of integrating wearable sensors by comparing two 
deployment scenarios: Raspberry Pi 3 and Personal Computer. The integration is 
implemented using a choreography engine to transmit data from sensors to a 
display unit using web services and a simple communication protocol with two 
modes of data retrieval. Performance of the two set-ups is compared by means of 
the latency in the wearable data transmission and data loss. PC has a delay of 
0.051 ± 0.0035 s (max = 0.2504 s), whereas the Raspberry Pi yields a delay of 
0.0175 ± 0.149 s (max = 0.294 s) for N = 300. Our analysis confirms that 
portable devices ( p < < 0 . 01 ) are suitable to support the transmission and 
analysis of biometric signals into scalable telemedicine systems.

Homochirality through Photon-Induced Denaturing of RNA/DNA at the Origin of 
Life.

Since a racemic mixture of chiral nucleotides frustrates the enzymeless 
extension of RNA and DNA, the origin of homochirality must be intimately 
connected with the origin of life. Homochirality theories have elected to 
presume abiotic mechanisms for prebiotic enantiomer enrichment and post 
amplification, but none, so far, has been generally accepted. Here I present a 
novel hypothesis for the procurement of homochirality from an asymmetry in 
right- over left-circularly polarized photon-induced denaturing of RNA and DNA 
at the Archean ocean surface as temperatures descended below that of RNA and DNA 
melting. This asymmetry is attributed to the small excess of right-handed 
circularly polarized submarine light during the afternoon, when surface water 
temperatures were highest and thus most conducive to photon-induced denaturing, 
and to a negative circular dichroism band extending from 230 to 270 nm for small 
oligos of RNA and DNA. Because D-nucleic acids have greater affinity for 
L-tryptophan due to stereochemistry, and because D-RNA/DNA+L-tryptophan 
complexes have an increased negative circular dichroism band between 230 and 270 
nm, the homochirality of tryptophan can also be explained by this hypothesis. A 
numerical model is presented, demonstrating the efficacy of such a mechanism in 
procuring homochirality of RNA or DNA from an original racemic solution in as 
little as 270 Archean years.

INTRODUCTION: Weaknesses in care programmes providing anti-retroviral therapy 
(ART) persist and are often instigated by late HIV diagnosis and poor linkage to 
care. We investigated the potential for a home-based counselling and testing 
(HBCT) campaign to be improved through the optimal timing and enhancement of 
testing rounds to generate greater health outcomes at minimum cost.
METHODS: Using a mathematical model of HIV care calibrated to longitudinal data 
from The Academic Model Providing Access To Healthcare (AMPATH) in Kenya, we 
simulated HBCT campaigns between 2016 and 2036, assessing the impact and total 
cost of care for each, for a further 20 years.
RESULTS: We find that simulating five equally spaced rounds averts 1.53 million 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) at a cost of $1617 million. By altering 
the timing of HBCT rounds, a four-round campaign can produce greater impact for 
lower cost. With "front-loaded" rounds, the cost per DALY averted is reduced by 
12% as fewer rounds are required ($937 vs. $1060). Furthermore, improvements to 
HBCT coverage and linkage to care avert over two million DALYs at a cost per 
DALY averted of $621 (41% less than the reference scenario).
CONCLUSIONS: Countries implementing HBCT can reduce costs by optimally timing 
rounds and generate greater health outcomes through improving linkage, coverage, 
and retention. Tailoring HBCT campaigns to individual settings can enhance 
patient outcomes for minimal cost.

This study assessed agreement between radiation oncologist- and cancer 
patient-reported perceptions about cancer diagnosis, time since diagnosis, 
treatment purpose, and whether life expectancy had been discussed; and described 
preferences for prognosis discussions. Adult cancer patients receiving 
radiotherapy at a Japanese hospital were invited to complete a touchscreen 
tablet survey. Patient survey responses were linked and comparisons made with a 
survey completed by their radiation oncologist. Among 146 cancer 
patient-oncologist dyads, there was almost perfect agreement on cancer diagnosis 
(ĸ = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.82-0.94), substantial agreement on time since diagnosis (ĸ 
= 0.70, 95% CI: 0.57-0.83) and moderate agreement on whether treatment goal was 
curative or palliative (ĸ = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.28-0.57; all p's < 0.0001). 
Agreement about whether a life expectancy discussion had occurred was less than 
expected by chance (κ = -0.06, p = 0.9). Radiation oncologists reported that 
they had spoken to over two thirds of patients about this, whilst less than one 
third of patients stated that this discussion had occurred with their radiation 
oncologist. Over half of the patients who had not discussed life expectancy 
wanted to. Patients had variable preferences for whether they (80%), their 
radiation oncologist (78%) or their partner/family (52%) should decide whether 
they discuss their life expectancy. Although patient self-reported information 
about diagnosis and time since diagnosis appears to be reasonably accurate 
(compared with clinician-reported information), limitations of self-reported 
data about prognostic discussions were highlighted by poor agreement between 
patient- and clinician-reported information about whether prognostic discussions 
have occurred. Additional support is needed to improve prognosis communication 
and understanding in radiation oncology settings.

INTRODUCTION: Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy (BSCL) is a rare 
autosomal recessive disease that affects the development of adipocytes and leads 
to an inability to store fat in adipocytes. This study aimed to evaluate the 
life expectancy and the causes of death of patients with BSCL.
METHOD: We analyzed death certificates, and medical records of BSCL patients who 
died between 1997 and 2017. If the death certificate was incomplete or 
unavailable, we reviewed the medical records, and if they were not available 
too, we collected information from the patient's relatives to understand how the 
death happened. We calculated the potential years of life lost as a result of 
premature death.
RESULTS: Twenty patients (12 female and 8 male) died between 1997 and 2017. The 
mean age at the time of death was 27.1±12.4 years (women 25.2±12.5 vs. men 
29.9±12.6 years, p = 0.41). Life expectancy for the study population was 
62.9±4.8 years. The potential number of years of life lost was 35.6±16.6 years. 
The causes of deaths were divided into three major groups: infections (7 
patients, 35%), liver disease (7 patients, 35%), and other causes (acute 
pancreatitis, one patient; renal failure, three patients; sudden 
death/myocardial infarction, two patients). Three patients had pulmonary 
fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: BSCL led to premature death, cutting the patients' lifespan by 30 or 
more years. The majority of these young patients died of liver disease or 
infection. Other studies are needed to understand better the mechanisms that 
predispose to infections, as well as to assess whether new therapies can alter 
the natural history of this disease.

Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy increases the likelihood of effective 
immune restoration, quality of life, and greater life expectancy for 
HIV-infected individuals. We evaluated the evolution of mean CD4+ cells count at 
diagnosis of HIV/AIDS in Salvador, Brazil from 2002 to 2015. We identified 
HIV/AIDS patients older than 18 years with diagnosis of HIV infection from 2002 
to 2015, who had their first laboratory evaluation at Complexo Hospitalar Prof. 
Edgard Santos, Federal University of Bahia. Initial mean CD4+ cells count and 
age, over time were evaluated. A total of 1801 patients randomly selected 
individuals were included in the analysis. Overall mean CD4+ count at diagnosis 
in the whole period was 279±265, varying from 191 in 2015 to 334 in 2011. There 
was no improvement in the immunological status at diagnosis from 2002 to 2015. 
In addition, a higher frequency of CD4+ cells count<200cells/mL in the last two 
years was observed. This suggests that the adopted strategies for early 
diagnosis of HIV/AIDS in Salvador, Brazil, are still ineffective.

Schizophrenia is among the top half of the 25 leading causes of disabilities 
worldwide with a 10-20 year decrease in life expectancy. Ineffective 
pharmacotherapy in the management of cognitive deficits and weight gain are 
known to be significant contributors; therefore interventions that may mitigate 
one, or both, of these parameters would be highly beneficial. Manipulation of 
the gut microbiome using dietary supplements such as prebiotics may be one such 
intervention. Preclinical studies have shown that a 2-4 week dietary 
supplementation with a prebiotic has beneficial effects on learning and memory, 
and prevents pro-inflammatory signals that are detrimental to cognitive 
processes. Furthermore, prebiotics influence metabolism, and in obesity they 
increase the expression of anorexigenic gut hormones such as peptide tyrosine 
tyrosine, glucagon-like peptide 1 and leptin, as well as decrease levels of 
orexigenic hormones such as ghrelin. Despite compelling evidence for the 
pro-cognitive and neuroprotective effects of prebiotics in rodents, their 
ability to alleviate cognitive deficits or enhance cognition needs to be 
evaluated in humans. Here we suggest that important symptoms associated with 
schizophrenia, such as cognitive impairment and weight gain, may benefit from 
concurrent prebiotic therapy.

BACKGROUND: Prior studies indicate that stratified care for low back pain 
results in better clinical outcome and reduced costs in healthcare compared to 
current practice. Stratified care may be associated with clinical benefits for 
patients with low back pain at a lower cost, but evidence is sparse. Hence this 
study aims to evaluate the clinical effects and cost-effectiveness of stratified 
care in patients with non-specific low back pain compared to current practice.
METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a two-armed randomised controlled trial in primary 
care in the Regions of Southern and Central Denmark (2.5 million citizens). 
Patients with non-specific low back will be recruited by paticpating GPs. 
Patients are randomised to either (1) stratified care or (2) current practice at 
participating physiotherapy clinics. In the stratified care arm, the 
intervention is based on the patient's STarT Back Tool classification and 
trained accordingly, whereas physiotherapists in the current pratice arm are 
blinded to the STarT score. Primary outcomes in the trial will be group 
differences in time off work, improvement in LBP disability measured by the 
Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and patient-reported global 
change. Secondary measures will be pain intensity, patient satisfaction, data on 
patient healthcare resource utilisation and quality-adjusted life year based on 
the EQ-5D-5L.
DISCUSSION: Stratified care that effectively targets treatment to relevant 
sub-groups of patients has potentially great impact on the treatment pathways of 
low back pain. Thus, if effective, this could result in better patient outcomes 
and at the same time reduce the costs for treatment of low back pain.

Every individual in his/her life experiences cervical pain at some stage which 
may restrict daily activities. Various approaches are available for the 
management of cervical pain, which include surgical, pharmacological and 
physical therapy. Different Manual therapy techniques are used for the treatment 
of neck pain. Muscle energy techniques and active isolated stretching are under 
consideration. This case series study was conducted at physical therapy 
department of North West General Hospital, Peshawar from August 2015 to January 
2016 to find out the effectiveness of muscles energy techniques on cervical 
range of motion and pain. A total of 20 patients suffering neck pain, both 
genders having age of 25 - 50 years, cervical ROM limitation and muscles spasm 
were included in the study. Patients were treated by muscles energy technique 
(MET). The patient's outcome measures were Inclinometer and Visual Analogue 
Scale (VAS). Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20. The mean age was 32.3±6.53 
years. The patient treated with muscles energy technique showed clinically 
improvement in the range of motion and pain. Results showed that pre and post 
treatment differences were statistically significant for cervical flexion 
(0.001), cervical extension (0.001), cervical right side rotation (0.001), 
cervical left side rotation (0.001), cervical right side bending (0.001), and 
cervical left side bending (0.01). Paired t-test finding for the pain showed 
statistically significant difference (0.005). It was concluded that Muscles 
Energy Technique is effective in the treatment of restricted range of motion and 
cervical pain.

BACKGROUND: Increasing global life expectancy has resulted in a greater demand 
for cancer surgery in aged patients. However, whether extreme age causes poorer 
clinical outcomes remains unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the 
impact of extreme age (≥80 years) on outcomes in patients after liver cancer 
surgery.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed to enrol relevant studies. Data were 
analysed using fixed-effects or random-effects models. Eight retrospective 
studies involving 253 participants older than 80 years were included.
RESULTS: Compared with younger patients, patients of extreme age (≥80 years) who 
had undergone curative liver cancer surgery experienced less operating time and 
blood loss (both P < 0.0001); a larger size (weighted mean difference = 0.48 cm, 
95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.87 cm; P = 0.02) and more advanced stage of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (risk ratio (RR) = 1.20, 95% CI 1.04-1.39; P = 0.01); a 
higher overall morbidity (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.47; P = 0.01); and more 
post-operative ileus (POI) (RR = 3.45, 95% CI 1.03-11.56; P = 0.04), delirium 
(RR = 3.04, 95% CI 1.36-6.78; P = 0.007) and cardiovascular events (RR = 6.17, 
95% CI 2.79-13.60; P < 0.00001). No significant difference was noted in overall 
(hazard ratio (HR) = 1.15, 95% CI 0.87-1.53; P = 0.32) or disease-free 
(HR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.75-1.24; P = 0.77) survival.
CONCLUSION: Although an extreme age may not be a contraindication for 
undertaking liver cancer surgery, it may cause more morbidity. Perioperative 
intervention should be considered for prevention and early treatment of POI, 
delirium and cardiovascular events.

AIM: Due to increasing life expectancy, patients with breast cancer remain at 
risk of dying due to breast cancer over a long time. This study aims to assess 
the impact of age on breast cancer mortality and other cause mortality 10 years 
after diagnosis.
METHODS: Postmenopausal patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer 
were included in the Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) 
trial between 2001 and 2006. Age at diagnosis was categorised as <65 years 
(n = 3369), 65-74 years (n = 1896) and ≥75 years (n = 854). Breast cancer 
mortality was assessed considering other cause mortality as competing event 
using competing risk analysis.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 9.8 years (interquartile range 8.0-10.3), 
cumulative incidence of breast cancer mortality increased with increasing age 
(age <65 years, 11.7% [95% confidence interval {CI}: 10.2-13.2]; 65-74 years, 
12.7% (11.2-14.2) and ≥75 years, 15.6% (13.1-18.0)). Univariate subdistribution 
hazard ratio (sHR) increased with increasing age (age: 65-74 years, sHR: 1.08, 
95% CI: 0.92-1.27 and ≥75 years sHR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.06-1.58, P = 0.013). 
Multivariable sHR adjusted for tumour and treatment characteristics increased 
with age but did not reach significance (age 65-74 years, sHR: 1.11, 95% CI: 
0.94-1.31; ≥75 years, sHR: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.94-1.48, P = 0.055).
CONCLUSION: Ten years after diagnosis, older age at diagnosis is associated with 
increasing breast cancer mortality in univariate analysis, but it did not reach 
significance in multivariable analysis. This is not outweighed by a 
substantially higher other cause mortality with older age. This underlines the 
need to improve the balance between undertreatment and overtreatment in older 
patients with breast cancer. The trial was registered in International Trial 
Databases (ClinicalTrials.govNCT00279448, NCT00032136, and NCT00036270; the 
Netherlands Trial Registry NTR267).

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of cigarette smoking is significantly higher among 
those living at or below the federal poverty level. Cell phone-based 
interventions among such populations have the potential to reduce smoking rates 
and be cost-effective.
METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of three smoking cessation 
interventions: Standard Care (SC) (brief advice to quit, nicotine replacement 
therapy and self-help written materials), Enhanced Care (EC) (SC plus cell 
phone-delivered messaging) and Intensive Care (IC) (EC plus cell phone-delivered 
counselling). Quit rates were obtained from Project ACTION (Adult smoking 
Cessation Treatment through Innovative Outreach to Neighborhoods). We evaluated 
shorter-term outcomes of cost per quit and long-term outcomes using cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY).
RESULTS: For men, EC cost an additional $541 per quit vs SC; however, IC cost an 
additional $5232 per quit vs EC. For women, EC was weakly dominated by IC-IC 
cost an additional $1092 per quit vs SC. Similarly, for men, EC had incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $426 per QALY gained vs SC; however, IC 
resulted in ICER of $4127 per QALY gained vs EC. For women, EC was weakly 
dominated; the ICER of IC vs SC was $1251 per QALY gained. The ICER was below 
maximum acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY under all 
alternative modelling assumptions.
DISCUSSION: Cell phone interventions for low socioeconomic groups are a 
cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Intensive Care was the most 
cost-effective strategy both for men and women.

Surface waters are important to humans because they are a significant water 
supply source. They are, however, under serious environmental stress and are 
being threatened as a consequence of developmental activities. The present study 
describes the physicochemical properties and water quality indices of five 
different rivers used for drinking and other domestic activities in rural and 
pre-urban communities in Edo North, Nigeria. The physicochemical variable ranges 
include pH [wet season (6.47 ± 0.30-6.89 ± 0.11), dry season 
(6.61 ± 0.14-7.84 ± 0.24)], electrical conductivity (EC) [wet season 
(3.33 ± 0.57-12.33 ± 2.51 μS/cm), dry season (5.33 ± 0.57-21.33 ± 2.08 μS/cm)], 
water temperature [wet season (24.23 ± 0.98-25.40 ± 1.15 °C), dry season 
(26.20 ± 0.55-27.10 ± 0.75 °C)], TDS [wet season 
(417.00 ± 15.87-433.33 ± 18.50 mg/L), dry season 
(319.33 ± 16.50-372.66 ± 22.30 mg/L)], turbidity [wet season 
(1.01 ± 0.11-2.08 ± 0.99 NTU), dry season (3.11 ± 0.01-5.41 ± 0.24 NTU)], and DO 
[wet season (2.65 ± 0.37-3.99 ± 0.01 mg/L), dry season 
(2.12 ± 0.11-2.44 ± 0.01 mg/L)]. For the wet and dry seasons, the water quality 
indices were 120.225 and 585.015 for River Osolo, 119.849 and 445.751 for River 
Foreign, 200.474 and 587.833 for Ijoh River, 105.261 and 512.498 for Ole River, 
and 150.114 and 489.992 for Ole Extension River, respectively. The pH was 
negatively correlated with DO (r = -0.648), and EC was negatively correlated 
with DO (r = -0.635). Most of the evaluated parameters were within recommended 
water safety guidelines. However, the water quality index shows that the water 
quality was very poor and/or unsuitable for drinking and other domestic uses, 
especially during the dry season. It is suggested that river water be treated 
prior to its use for drinking and other domestic purposes.

[Progress of surgical treatment for aortic valve diseases in children].

As the primary treatment of aortic valve stenosis in children, surgical aortic 
valvotomy (SAV) and balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) are widely used. With the 
similar early curative effect to BAV, SAV performs better in long-term 
follow-up. But the first choice for aortic valve stenosis is still 
controversial. These years, aortic valve repair is valued and different repair 
techniques have been reported and achieved good results. The complex repair 
techniques, as leaflet extension, leaflet replacement or valve reconstruction, 
are effective in treating diseased valves that cannot be repaired before. Ozaki 
technology, using glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium to replace the 
aortic valve, makes the surgery more standardized and reproducible by developing 
special instruments. Pulmonary autograft (Ross procedure) is considered to be 
superior to other valve replacement technologies due to the good hemodynamic 
performance and lower reoperation rate. Mechanical valve is still used in some 
cases, but the quality of life is low due to the lifelong anticoagulation, and 
it has a high reintervention rate. The biological valve has been rarely used in 
children because of its high rate of early calcification and structural failure.

儿童主动脉瓣狭窄的首选治疗方法目前仍有争议。主动脉瓣切开术和球囊主动脉瓣成形术早期疗效相仿，但前者中远期免于再干预率明显优于后者。主动脉瓣修复是目前学界的关注重点，瓣叶延长、瓣叶置换或瓣膜重建为原本无法修复的病变提供了治疗机会。Ozaki技术采用戊二醛处理的自体心包进行一个或多个瓣叶的置换，测量工具和裁剪模板的使用提高了该技术的标准化程度和可复制性，易于推广应用。自体肺动脉瓣移植具有良好的术后血流动力学表现和较低的再手术率，效果优于其他瓣膜置换术。机械瓣置换需终身抗凝治疗，具有较高的再干预率；生物瓣置换由于其早期钙化失功率较高，已很少用于儿童患者。.

Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and to explore the releated factors of 
antiretroviral therapy among HIV/AIDS patients in Liangshan Yi Autonomous 
Prefecture, Sichuan Province. Methods: The method of convenience sampling was 
adopted in July 2017 to select the research objects who were accepted 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) over 6 months, older than 18 years and had HIV 
viral load in 2016, totally 400 cases. A retrospective study was used to collect 
the data, including social demography, medicine use, information of medical 
service acquisition, their own behaviors and cognition. 395 questionnaires were 
effectively recovered. χ(2) test and logistic regression were performed to 
examine relationships between factors and effects. Results: All of the 395 
respondents were Yi-nationality. The average age of all cases was (39.23±7.52) 
years old and 223 were male (56.5%). Among 395 cases patients who were detect 
Viral load in 2016, 221 cases were under the number of 400 copies, thze 
effective rate of ART was 55.9%. Multivariate analysis showed that HIV/AIDS 
patients who missed the medication during the antiviral therapy had poor 
antiviral effects. Compared to those who adhered to medication, the 
treatment-ineffective OR (95%CI) of the patients missing the medication during 
the therapy was 7.06 (3.67-13.58); Compared to those who had adverse reactions 
that affect the therapy, the treatment-ineffective OR (95%CI) of the patients 
with mild adverse reactions that did not affect the therapy was 0.45 
(0.23-0.87); Compared to the patients who used drugs during the treatment, the 
treatment-ineffective OR (95%CI) value of the antiretroviral therapy effect of 
non-drug users was 0.39 (0.16-0.91);Compared to the patients who have a correct 
cognition that insisting on taking medicine correctly can extend their life 
expectancy as a common person, the treatment-ineffective OR (95%CI) values for 
those who hold the view that could be prolonged by 10-20 years and not/unknown 
were 4.18 (1.59-10.99) and 6.64 (2.67-16.53). Conclusion: The HIV/AIDS patients 
who receive ART were less effective in Liangshan, Prefecture. Missings drugs is 
one of the main influencing factors for the ineffective treatment.

395例调查对象均为彝族，年龄为（39.23±7.52）岁；其中男性为223（56.5%）例。2016年HIV病毒载量检测结果<400拷贝/ml者为221例，抗病毒治疗有效率55.9%。与坚持服药者相比，服药期间漏服药物的HIV感染者和艾滋病患者抗病毒治疗无效的OR（95%CI）值为7.06（3.67~13.58）；与服药期间发生不良反应影响继续服药的患者相比，发生不良反应轻微未影响继续服药者抗病毒治疗无效的OR（95%CI）值为0.45（0.23~0.87）；与服药期间有吸毒行为的患者相比，不吸毒者抗病毒治疗无效的OR（95%CI）值为0.39（0.16~0.91）；与认为坚持服药能接近健康人寿命的HIV感染者和艾滋病患者相比，认为能延长10~20年和不能/不知道者相对于正确认知的感染者和患者抗病毒治疗无效的OR（95%CI）值分别为4.18（1.59~10.99）和6.64（2.67~16.53）。 
结论： 凉山州接受抗病毒治疗的HIV感染者和艾滋病患者抗病毒治疗有效率较低，漏服药物是其治疗无效主要相关因素。.

Aims: Cross-country comparisons of mortality and longevity patterns of Nordic 
populations could contribute with novel insights into the compositional changes 
of these populations. We investigated three metrics of population ageing: the 
proportion of the population aged 75+ and 90+ years, the proportion of birth 
cohorts reaching 75 and 90 years, and life expectancy (LE) at age 75 and 
90 years in Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark and Finland, in the period 
1990-2014. Methods: Demographic information was collected from national 
statistical databases and the Human Mortality Database. Results: All metrics on 
population ageing increased during the study period, but there were some 
cross-country variations. Finland experienced a notably steep increase in the 
proportion of 75+ and 90+ year olds compared to the other countries. Regarding
