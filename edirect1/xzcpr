high prevalence of comorbidities may on the one hand reduce the therapeutic 
effects of administered drugs; on the other hand, it leads to increased 
vulnerability to drug toxicity and side effects. Therefore, management of APT is 
particularly challenging in elderly patients because of higher risk of both 
ischemic and bleeding events. The aim of the present paper is to review the 
current evidence, gaps in knowledge and ongoing research regarding APT in the 
setting of an ACS in elderly and very elderly patients, and in those with 
significant comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus 
and frailty.

Tildrakizumab (tildrakizumab-asmn in the USA) [Ilumetri®; Ilumya™] is a 
humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that selectively targets the p19 subunit of 
interleukin (IL)-23, thereby inhibiting the IL-23/IL-17 axis, the signalling 
pathway primarily implicated in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis. 
Administered subcutaneously, it is approved for the treatment of adults with 
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy 
(e.g. in the EU and Australia) and those who are candidates for systemic therapy 
or phototherapy (in the USA). In the pivotal phase III reSURFACE 1 and 2 trials, 
tildrakizumab was superior to placebo and efficacious compared with etanercept, 
in terms of the proportion of patients achieving a response [≥ 75% improvement 
from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity index score (PASI 75) and a 
Physician's Global Assessment score of 0/1] at week 12. Response rates peaked at 
week 22 and the vast majority of patients achieving PASI 75 at week 28 
maintained this response after a total of 3 years of treatment in the reSURFACE 
trials and their ongoing open-label extension studies. In addition, patients 
with a partial or no response to etanercept at week 28 benefitted from switching 
to the highest approved dose of tildrakizumab in the reSURFACE 2 trial and its 
ongoing extension. Treatment with tildrakizumab improved health-related quality 
of life and was generally well tolerated, both in the short- and longer-term. 
Tildrakizumab thus expands the range of useful therapeutic options for patients 
with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, particularly those with an inadequate 
response to phototherapy and conventional systemic agents.

In experimental evolution, scientists evolve organisms in the lab, typically by 
challenging them to new environmental conditions. How best to evolve a desired 
trait? Should the challenge be applied abruptly, gradually, periodically, 
sporadically? Should one apply chemical mutagenesis, and do strains with high 
innate mutation rate evolve faster? What are ideal population sizes of evolving 
populations? There are endless strategies, beyond those that can be exposed by 
individual labs. We therefore arranged a community challenge, Evolthon, in which 
students and scientists from different labs were asked to evolve Escherichia 
coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae for an abiotic stress-low temperature. About 30 
participants from around the world explored diverse environmental and genetic 
regimes of evolution. After a period of evolution in each lab, all strains of 
each species were competed with one another. In yeast, the most successful 
strategies were those that used mating, underscoring the importance of sex in 
evolution. In bacteria, the fittest strain used a strategy based on exploration 
of different mutation rates. Different strategies displayed variable levels of 
performance and stability across additional challenges and conditions. This 
study therefore uncovers principles of effective experimental evolutionary 
regimens and might prove useful also for biotechnological developments of new 
strains and for understanding natural strategies in evolutionary arms races 
between species. Evolthon constitutes a model for community-based scientific 
exploration that encourages creativity and cooperation.

The increase in life expectancy and Healthy Life Years in Europe is largely 
attributable to the success of cardiovascular medicine. Technical developments 
enable ever more detailed insights into disease processes and enable a precise, 
multimodal diagnosis of even complex diseases using digital imaging, cardiac 
biomarkers and genomic information. The rapid availability of this data, often 
in real time, allows optimized planning and performing of tailored 
interventional, surgical, or pharmacotherapies. But there are also completely 
new challenges due to the growing flood of data, the integration of which can no 
longer be achieved by the individual doctor. The active involvement and 
participation of the patient also requires new digital concepts and should 
include decision-making, treatment planning, (long-term) history, and feedback 
on success and adverse drug reactions. By using artificial intelligence, digital 
communication and decision support systems, economic benefits, quality 
improvements and acceleration of outpatient and inpatient treatment become 
possible.The DGK supports these developments in its own activities, both in 
project planning, communication with specialist groups, and in training and 
education. In this article you will find excerpts from current developments of 
digital cardiology.

The increase in population, greater life expectancy, and lifestyle choices have 
caused a drastic increase in the number of bone diseases such as bone tumours, 
osteoarthritis and bone fractures. This results in the dire need for treatment 
options such as suitable bone grafts that can be easily fabricated, and are 
economical. In this study, fabricated composite scaffolds are made from 
polysaccharide biopolymers, namely gellan and guar gum, and hydroxyapatite by 
freeze drying method. The developed scaffolds of optimum concentration showed a 
maximum percentage degradation of 13.7% only until 21 days in phosphate buffered 
saline solution, and minimum swelling capacity. The mechanically stable 
scaffolds (compressive strength equivalent to cancellous bone region, ˜3-30 MPa) 
amongst them were then subjected to characterization tests-scanning electron 
microscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, swelling 
ratio percentage determination, degradation profile study and water vapour 
transmission study. The cytotoxic evaluation of the optimised scaffolds was 
performed using MTT assay with murine fibroblast (L929) cells and osteosarcoma 
(MG63) cells. It was found that the scaffolds were non-cytotoxic and 
additionally, the cells had proliferated well within the scaffolds, which was 
confirmed by MTT assay at 1, 4 and 7 days after cell seeding onto the scaffolds.

BACKGROUND: Despite a consistent association with improved outcomes, public 
automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are rarely used in out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest. One of the barriers towards increased use might be 
cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: We compared the cost-effectiveness of public AEDs to no AEDs for 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States over a life-time horizon. 
The analysis assumed a societal perspective and results are presented as costs 
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Model inputs were based on reviews of the 
literature. For the base case, we modelled an annual cardiac arrest incidence 
per AED of 20%. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to account 
for joint parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: The no AED strategy resulted in 1.63 QALYs at a cost of $28,964. The 
AED strategy yielded an additional 0.26 QALYs for an incremental increase in 
cost of $13,793 per individual. The AED strategy yielded an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $53,797 per QALY gained. The yearly incidence of 
cardiac arrests occurring in the presence of an AED had minimal effect on the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio except at very low incidences. In several 
sensitivity analyses across a plausible range of health care and societal 
estimates, the AED strategy remained cost-effective. In the probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, the AED strategy was cost-effective in 43%, 85%, and 91% 
of the scenarios at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000, $100,000, and 
$150,000 per QALY gained, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Public AEDs are a cost-effective public health intervention in the 
United States. These findings support widespread dissemination of public AEDs.

Behaviourally specialized foragers are less efficient and live shorter lives 
than generalists in wasp colonies.

A widely held assumption in ecology is that specialists are more efficient than 
generalists. However, empirical evidence for this fundamental assumption is 
surprisingly scarce and often contradictory. Theoretically, the evolution of 
alternative life history strategies is underpinned by a trade-off between 
activity levels and survival. We investigated the consequences of specialization 
in a foraging context, by comparing the performance and longevity of closely 
related individuals in a social insect, the common wasp (Vespula vulgaris). 
Using radio-frequency identification technology, we monitored the lifetime 
foraging activity of individual wasps from three colonies kept under natural 
foraging conditions. Returning foragers were video-recorded as they passed the 
nest entrance so that their foraging load could be assessed. There were 
substantial differences in foraging activity and survival within and between 
colonies. At the colony level, foraging specialization was weak. Yet, workers 
within each nest demonstrated a remarkable range of foraging specialization 
levels (defined as the degree of overlap between individual and colony-level 
task allocation) and efficiencies (defined by the number of successful trips and 
trip duration). We found that specialist foragers were less efficient than 
generalist siblings within the same colony. Behavioural specialists accomplished 
fewer successful trips per foraging day, and their trips were typically 
relatively longer. Specialized foragers also showed reduced life expectancy. The 
mortality risk was higher for individuals spending relatively more time in the 
field, yet we found no link between the level of specialization and relative 
field exposure. Our extensive dataset of unprecedented detail provides strong 
empirical evidence that behavioural specialization is not associated with a 
better lifetime performance, on the contrary, the opposite appears true for the 
common wasp. We also show that the survival of genetically similar individuals 
can be linked to life-long differences in behaviour according to classical 
life-history theory predictions.

BACKGROUND: Despite the substantial global burden of disease, rheumatic heart 
disease research receives little funding globally.
METHODS: Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study and funding from the 
G-FINDER database, we propose a novel logarithmic disability neglect index (DNI) 
to describe disease burden using disability-adjusted life years relative to 
funding for 16 major tropical diseases.
RESULTS: Across a range of diseases, rheumatic heart disease received the least 
funding relative to disease burden (DNI=3.83). Other diseases facing similar 
underfunding include cysticercosis (DNI=2.71) and soil-transmitted helminths 
(DNI=2.41).
CONCLUSIONS: Rheumatic heart disease remains severely underfunded relative to 
disease burden.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of people with severe mental illness (SMI) is 
greatly shortened compared to the general population, and despite extensive 
research, this issue is unsolved. Although it is widely recognised that people 
with SMI need support from health care services to manage health related issues, 
profound health inequalities exist within provision of health care. The aim of 
this study was to examine how mental health care professionals accounted for 
their actions and responsibilities related to managing physical health issues 
among people with SMI.
METHODS: Three focus groups were conducted with 22 mental health care 
professionals, employed at three mental health care locations. Participants' 
situated accounts were subjected to discourse analysis.
RESULTS: Participants accounted for actions and responsibilities in three 
typical ways; 1) by positioning people with SMI as difficult to motivate and 
actively resisting intervention, 2) by positioning people with SMI as so 
impaired that intervention was futile, and 3) by arguing they are undertreated 
for physical conditions and might have physical illnesses that staff are not 
aware of because of prominent mental illness. These discursive strategies seemed 
to legitimise situations where participants described not responding to physical 
health issues, and to downplay potential trouble in situations where 
participants described not succeeding in facilitating lifestyle changes or 
promoting compliance to treatment of physical conditions.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Mental health care professionals need to increase 
their awareness of latent discriminating attitudes towards people with SMI. Such 
attitudes are suggested to reinforce barriers for people with SMI receiving 
physical health care.

BACKGROUND: Continuous developments in healthcare have led to an increase in 
average life expectancy. Obesity in aged persons is increasing and is more 
clearly associated with an increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, 
lipid abnormalities, mobility-limited problems, and other co-morbidities in this 
category of age.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to report the outcomes of 
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in patients >65 years of age.
SETTING: Private hospital, France.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed from patients aged >65 years who 
had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (June 2011-December 2017). The 
data analyzed included age, co-morbidities, preoperative body mass index, length 
of hospital stay, and postoperative complications.
RESULTS: A total of 93 patients were included with a mean age of 68.8 years 
(range, 65-78); 73 were female (78.5 %), and the mean preoperative body mass 
index was 43.6 ± 5.4 kg/m2. Revisional surgery was well represented in 34.4% of 
cases. Thirty-two patients had a previous gastric band converted to laparoscopic 
sleeve gastrectomy, with 12 cases of 1-step revision (37.5%). Eleven patients 
(11.8%) had concomitant cholecystectomy. All procedures were performed 
laparoscopically with no peroperative complications. The median hospital stay 
was 3.1 days (1-6 d). Complications included 1 hematoma treated conservatively. 
The 30-day mortality rate was 0%. The mean excess weight loss at 1 year 
postoperatively was 67.1% (range, 34%-107%) with a follow-up rate of 78.1%. 
Resolution or improvement was observed in 65% of patients presenting with 
diabetes, in 72.5% of patients presenting with HTA, in 47.1% of patients 
presenting with dyslipidemia, and in 63.6% of patients presenting with sleep 
apnea.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleeve gastrectomy in elderly patients seems to be safe in terms of 
complications. Surgery is associated with a low-morbidity profile. Sleeve 
gastrectomy is our preferred procedure in this category of patients.

OBJECTIVE: The life expectancy of women with cystic fibrosis (CF) has increased, 
enabling many to reach reproductive age. However, little is known about the 
childbearing concerns and information needs of women with CF or their 
preferences for information about the effect of their condition and its 
treatment on childbearing. The aim of this study was to identify the 
childbearing concerns and related information needs and preferences of women 
with CF.
METHODS: To ensure access to a diverse group of women with CF throughout 
Australia and to minimise the risk of cross infection, an online group was 
advertised and convened on Facebook from October through December 2017. In a 
closed-group moderated discussion, participants responded to questions about 
childbearing concerns and the related information needs and preferences of women 
with CF. Non-identifiable demographic information was sought via an online 
anonymous survey. The discussion transcript was analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Participants (n = 11) identified a number of concerns about 
childbearing including uncertainty about whether to have children; achieving or 
maintaining a pregnancy and giving birth; treatment and treatment adherence 
during pregnancy, breastfeeding and motherhood; and the impact of pregnancy and 
childbirth on future health. Women wanted information about childbearing as it 
related to their CF but reported difficulties accessing up-to-date accurate 
relevant information.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with CF want to be better informed about childbearing, and 
identified a need for personalised information as well as regular reviews with 
their CF treating team so that they can make informed decisions about having 
children.

AIM: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of the endowment of the same 
authority and responsibility in diabetes management to licensed GPs as licensed 
outpatient specialists in Hungary.
METHODS: The Syreon Diabetes Control Model (SDM) was used to evaluate life 
expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY) and direct medical costs 
over patient lifetimes. Cohort characteristics were derived from national 
database, clinical history data of 476,211 persons with diabetes were used, 
treatment effects and costs were derived from literature, national databases and 
expert opinions.
RESULTS: The purchase of one additional quality adjusted life year with the use 
of licensed general practitioners was EUR 51,420 compared to making the service 
available only through universal GPs. The purchase of one additional quality 
adjusted life year through the service of licensed GPs is EUR 459,950 compared 
to outpatient care provision.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of diabetes care with licensed GPs has the potential 
to improve patients health gains compared to the current patterns of care in 
Hungary in a cost-effective way if licensed GPs are reimbursed below the average 
current cost of outpatient diabetes services. Increase of the capitation for 
diabetic patients would be a practical way to reimburse the GP's additional 
service.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of a disabling non-traumatic shoulder lesion on 
work participation and working life expectancy.
METHODS: From a 70% random sample of the Finnish population, we selected 
30-59-year-old wage earners with prolonged sickness absence due to a shoulder 
lesion (n=7644). We followed the persons from 2006 to 2014 and calculated the 
proportion of time a person spent in different work participation statuses. The 
associations of potential determinants with a preterm exit from paid employment 
were tested using Cox regression. Years expected to be spent in different work 
participation statuses were estimated applying the Sullivan method for healthy 
life expectancy.
RESULTS: During 9 years of follow-up time spent at work was reduced from 77.7% 
to 46.7%, and 15.8% of the persons were granted disability retirement, mostly 
due to shoulder and other musculoskeletal diseases. Compared with the general 
population persons with a disabling shoulder disease are expected to lose from 
1.8 to 8.1 years of working life, depending on their age. Age, gender, 
education, duration of initial sickness absence due to the shoulder lesion, not 
being able to return to work sustainably and participation in vocational 
rehabilitation predicted preterm exit from work. Heavy lifting increased the 
risk of preterm exit marginally.
CONCLUSIONS: Working life expectancy is markedly reduced in persons with a 
disabling shoulder lesion, mainly because of disability retirement due to 
musculoskeletal problems. Clinicians should consider interventions targeted at 
improving musculoskeletal functioning and necessary work modifications before 
shoulder problems become chronic or the persons develop disabling comorbid 
musculoskeletal conditions.

INTRODUCTION: In older adults, dementia and depression are associated with 
individual distress and high societal costs. Music interventions such as group 
music therapy (GMT) and recreational choir singing (RCS) have shown promising 
effects, but their comparative effectiveness across clinical subgroups is 
unknown. This trial aims to determine effectiveness of GMT, RCS and their 
combination for care home residents and to examine heterogeneity of treatment 
effects across subgroups.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This large, pragmatic, multinational cluster-randomised 
controlled trial with a 2×2 factorial design will compare the effects of GMT, 
RCS, both or neither, for care home residents aged 65 years or older with 
dementia and depressive symptoms. We will randomise 100 care home units with 
≥1000 residents in total across eight countries. Each intervention will be 
offered for 6 months (3 months 2 times/week followed by 3 months 1 time/week), 
with extension allowed if locally available. The primary outcome will be the 
change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score at 6 months. 
Secondary outcomes will include depressive symptoms, cognitive functioning, 
neuropsychiatric symptoms, psychotropic drug use, caregiver burden, quality of 
life, mortality and costs over at least 12 months. The study has 90% power to 
detect main effects and is also powered to determine interaction effects with 
gender, severity and socioeconomic status.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained for one country and 
will be obtained for all countries. Results will be presented at national and 
international conferences and published in scientific journals.

Changing contribution of area-level deprivation to total variance in age at 
death: a population-based decomposition analysis.

OBJECTIVES: Two processes generate total variance in age at death: heterogeneity 
(between-group variance) and individual stochasticity (within-group variance). 
Limited research has evaluated how these two components have changed over time. 
We quantify the degree to which area-level deprivation contributed to total 
variance in age at death in Scotland between 1981 and 2011.
DESIGN: Full population and mortality data for Scotland were obtained and 
matched with the Carstairs score, a standardised z-score calculated for each 
part-postcode sector that measures relative area-level deprivation. A z-score 
above zero indicates that the part-postcode sector experienced higher 
deprivation than the national average. A z-score below zero indicates lower 
deprivation. From the aggregated data we constructed 40 lifetables, one for each 
deprivation quintile in 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 stratified by sex.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Total variance in age at death and the proportion 
explained by area-level deprivation heterogeneity (between-group variance).
RESULTS: The most deprived areas experienced stagnating or slightly increasing 
variance in age at death. The least deprived areas experienced decreasing 
variance. For males, the most deprived quintile life expectancy was between 7% 
and 11% lower and the SD is between 6% and 25% higher than the least deprived. 
This suggests that the effect of deprivation on the SD of longevity is 
comparable to its effect on life expectancy. Decomposition analysis revealed 
that contributions from between-group variance doubled between 1981 and 2011 but 
at most only explained 4% of total variance.
CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the emerging body of literature demonstrating 
that socio-economic groups have experienced diverging trends in variance in age 
at death. The contribution from area-level deprivation to total variance in age 
at death, which we were able to capture, has doubled since 1981. Area-level 
deprivation may play an increasingly important role in mortality inequalities.

BACKGROUND: Despite advances in life expectancy, low socioeconomic status is 
associated with a shorter lifespan. This study was conducted to investigate 
socioeconomic differences in mortality by comparing preventable with 
non-preventable causes of death in 39 506 participants from the Swedish Twin 
Registry born before 1935.
METHODS: Childhood social class, own education, own social class and social 
mobility were used as separate indicators of socioeconomic status. These data 
were linked to the Swedish Cause of Death Register. Cause of death was 
categorized as preventable or non-preventable mortality according to indicators 
presented in the Avoidable Mortality in the European Union (AMIEHS) atlas. Using 
Cox proportional hazard models, we tested the association between the 
socioeconomic measures and all-cause mortality, preventable mortality and 
non-preventable mortality. Additional co-twin control analyses indicated whether 
the associations reflected genetic confounding.
RESULTS: The social gradient for mortality was most prominent for the adult 
socioeconomic measures. There was a social gradient in both preventable 
mortality and non-preventable mortality, but with an indication of a moderately 
stronger effect in preventable causes of death. In analyses of social mobility, 
those who experienced life-time low socioeconomic status (SES) or downward 
social mobility had an increased mortality risk compared with those with 
life-time high SES and upward social mobility. Adjustments for genetic 
confounding did not change the observed associations for education, social class 
or social mobility and mortality. In the co-twin control analyses of 
reared-apart twins, the association between childhood social class and mortality 
weakened, indicating possible genetic influences on this association.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that there is an association between low adult 
socioeconomic status and increased mortality independent of genetic endowment. 
Thus, we do not find support for indirect social selection as the basis for 
mortality inequalities in Sweden.

PURPOSE: People with personality disorders have significantly reduced life 
expectancy and increased rates of cardiovascular disease compared to members of 
the general population. Given that more people die annually of cardiovascular 
disease across the globe than from any other cause, it is important to identify 
the evidence for interventions aimed at improving cardiovascular health among 
people with personality disorders.
METHODS: Systematic literature review. PsycINFO, MEDLINE and EMBASE were 
searched using NICE Healthcare Databases, as well as CENTRAL and trial 
registries. We sought to identify randomised controlled trials of interventions 
pertaining to adults with a primary diagnosis of personality disorder, where the 
primary outcome measure was cardiovascular health before and after the 
intervention.
RESULTS: A total of 1740 records were identified and screened by two independent 
reviewers. No papers meeting the inclusion criteria were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review did not identify any randomised controlled 
trials testing interventions aimed at improving the cardiovascular health of 
people with personality disorders. Research in this area could have important 
public health implications, spanning the fields of psychiatry and general 
medicine.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a secreted messenger molecule that 
is crucial for neuronal function and induction of synaptic plasticity. Although 
altered availability of BDNF underlies many neurological deficits and 
neurodegenerative disorders, secretion dynamics of endogenous BDNF are 
unexplored. We generated a BDNF-GFP knock-in (KiBE) mouse, in which GFP-labeled 
BDNF is expressed under the control of the unaltered endogenous mouse BDNF gene 
regulatory elements. This KiBE mouse model enables for the first time live cell 
imaging analysis of endogenous BDNF dynamics. We show that BDNF-GFP release and 
biological activity in vivo are unaffected by the GFP tag, since homozygous KiBE 
mice, which lack wild-type BDNF, are healthy and have a normal life expectancy. 
STED superresolution microscopy shows that 70% of BDNF-GFP vesicles in KiBE 
mouse neurites are localized in dendrites, being typically 200 nm away from 
synaptic release sites. Live cell imaging in hippocampal slices also reveals 
prominent targeting of endogenous BDNF-GFP vesicles to dendrites. Fusion pore 
opening and cargo release of dendritic BDNF vesicles start within 30 s after a 
strong depolarizing stimulus and continue for > 100 s thereafter, revealing an 
astonishingly delayed and prolonged release of endogenous BDNF.

Benefit-risk assessment is used in various phases along the drug lifecycle, such 
as marketing authorization and surveillance, health technology assessment (HTA), 
and clinical decisions, to understand whether, and for which patients, a drug 
has a favorable or more valuable profile with reference to one or more 
comparators. Such assessments are inherently preference-based as several 
clinical and nonclinical outcomes of varying importance might act as evaluation 
criteria, and decision makers must establish acceptable trade-offs between these 
outcomes. Different healthcare stakeholder perspectives, such as those from 
patients and healthcare professionals, are key for informing benefit-risk 
trade-offs. However, the degree to which such preferences inform the decision is 
often unclear as formal preference-based evaluation frameworks are generally not 
used for regulatory decisions, and, if used, rarely communicated in HTA 
decisions. We argue that for better decisions, as well as for reasons of 
transparency, preferences in benefit-risk decisions should more often be 
quantified and communicated explicitly.

Objective: To understand and analyze the incidence rate, risk factors, 
independent risk factors and the causes of death in elderly population with 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Furthermore, analyze the relationship 
between metabolic syndrome (MS) and mortality rate in patients with NAFLD to 
provide evidence for the prevention and control of NAFLD in the elderly 
population. Methods: A total of 7 619 elderly people aged over 60 years, and 
local household registered in Kunshan city, Jiangsu province in 2016 were 
included as subjects to analyze the incidence rate, influencing factors and 
causes of death in patients with NAFLD and the relationship between MS and 
mortality rate in patients with NAFLD. According to different data, using 
Kruskal-Wallis H test, analysis of variance, t-test, chi-square test or logistic 
regression analysis were performed. Results: The prevalence of NAFLD was14.10% 
(1 074/7 619) among the elderly over 60 years in Kunshan city, Jiangsu province
