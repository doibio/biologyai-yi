BACKGROUND: In the recent Pathway CH-1 study, on-demand stimulation of the 
sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) by means of an implantable neurostimulation system 
was proven to be a safe and effective therapy for the treatment of chronic 
cluster headache. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of SPG 
stimulation in the German healthcare system when compared to medical management.
METHODS: Clinical data from the Pathway CH-1 study were used as input for a 
model-based projection of the cost-effectiveness of SPG stimulation through 5 
years. Medical management as the comparator treatment was modeled on the basis 
of clinical events observed during the baseline period of CH-1. The costs of 
treatment were derived from a previously published cluster headache costing 
study and 2014 medication, neurostimulator, and procedure costs. We computed the 
5-year incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in euros per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY), with costs and effects discounted at 3 % per year.
RESULTS: SPG stimulation was projected to add 0.325 QALYs over the study period, 
while adding €889 in cost, resulting in a 5-year ICER of €2,736 per QALY gained. 
Longer follow-up periods, higher baseline attack frequency, and higher 
utilization of attack-aborting medications led to overall cost savings. SPG 
stimulation was found either cost-effective or cost-saving across all scenarios 
investigated in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model-based analysis suggests that SPG stimulation for the 
treatment of chronic cluster headache, under the assumption of sustained therapy 
effectiveness, leads to meaningful gains in health-related quality of life and 
is a cost-effective treatment strategy in the German healthcare system.

Transplant tourism and organ trafficking: Ethical implications for the nursing 
profession.

Corfee FA(1).

Organ availability for transplantation has become an increasingly complex and 
difficult question in health economics and ethical practice. Advances in 
technology have seen prolonged life expectancy, and the global push for organs 
creates an ever-expanding gap between supply and demand, and a significant cost 
in bridging that gap. This article will examine the ethical implications for the 
nursing profession in regard to the procurement of organs from an impoverished 
seller's market, also known as 'Transplant Tourism'. This ethical dilemma 
concerns itself with resource allocation, informed consent and the concepts of 
egalitarianism and libertarianism. Transplant Tourism is an unacceptable 
trespass against human dignity and rights from both a nursing and collective 
viewpoint. Currently, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Council, the Royal 
college of Nursing Australia, The Royal College of Nursing (UK) and the American 
Nurses Association do not have position statements on transplant tourism, and 
this diminishes us as a force for change. It diminishes our role as advocates 
for the most marginalised in our world to have access to care and to choice and 
excludes us from a very contemporary real debate about the mismatch of organ 
demand and supply in our own communities. As a profession, we must have a voice 
in health policy and human rights, and according to our Code of Ethics in 
Australia and around the world, act to promote and protect the fundamental human 
right to healthcare and dignity.

The Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a heterogeneous group of bacteria 
comprising around 20 related species. These bacteria are important opportunistic 
pathogens, especially in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, and are associated with 
a worse prognosis and decreased life expectancy. The taxonomic position of 20 
Bcc isolates retrieved from CF patients receiving care at Hospital Santa Maria 
(HSM), in Lisbon, from 1995 to 2006, was re-examined in the present work. These 
isolates, formerly classified as Burkholderia cepacia (taxon K), are here 
reclassified as Burkholderia contaminans, including the former B. cepacia 
IST408, which was the focus of previous studies regarding the biosynthesis of 
the exopolysaccharide 'cepacian'. The CF population examined has been previously 
described as having an exceptionally high representation of B. cepacia, 
presumably due to a contamination arising from saline solutions for nasal 
application. Twenty-one additional isolates, obtained from a chronically 
infected patient, from 2006 to 2010, were also identified as B. contaminans. 
This study also provides insight into the potential clinical impact of B. 
contaminans, a species that is rarely associated with CF infections. Isolates 
belonging to this species were shown to be involved in chronic and transient 
respiratory infections, and were associated with severe lung function 
deterioration and with a case of death with cepacia syndrome. However, since the 
patients were co-infected with Burkholderia cenocepacia and other 
non-Burkholderia bacteria, the role played by B. contaminans is unclear. 
Nevertheless, B. contaminans isolates were found to prevail over B. cenocepacia 
isolates during co-infection of at least one chronically infected patient.

01-211 Warsaw, Poland, e-mail: dorota.sands@imid.med.pl.

BACKGROUND: Together with increasing life expectancy of patients with cystic 
fibrosis *CF*, there is a growing need to deal with unforeseen problems and 
complications. Among others renal dysfunction has become of great concern.
AIM: Evaluation of renal function in CF children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed cross-sectional study on a group of 11 
teenage inpatients with CF. Physical examination, past medical history analysis, 
renal function measurements and analysis were conducted in all of them. Renal 
assessment included: serum cystatin C and creatinine levels, measured and 
estimated creatinine clearance, estimated cystatin C clearance, urine indicators 
of crystallization risk and renal ultrasonography.
RESULTS: One patient had elevated serum cystatin C level and diminished McIsaac 
equation. Renal ultrasound revealed non-congenital anomaly in 1 case - it was 
nephrolithiasis. All the individuals had elevated at least 1 urine indicator of 
crystallization risk.
CONCLUSION: There is a great need of good, standardized test of renal function 
in cystic fibrosis patients. The focus of research should turn towards finding a 
tool similar to faecal elastase, which is cheap, easy to perform, sensitive and 
specific, and can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

Congenital defects of the pericardium: a review.

Pericardial defects are a rare disorder that can be characterized as acquired or 
congenital. Congenital defects can be further characterized by location and size 
of the defect, e.g. left- or right-sided and partial or complete absence of the 
pericardium. While physical examination and electrocardiogram are not 
diagnostic, chest radiographs and echocardiography have findings that should 
alert the clinician to the absence of the pericardium as a possible diagnosis. 
Despite its limitations with visualizing the normal pericardium in areas of 
minimal adipose, cardiac magnetic resonance is currently the gold standard for 
diagnosing the congenital absence of the pericardium. Patients have a similar 
life expectancy to those without pericardial defects; however in certain cases, 
herniation and strangulation of cardiac chambers can be life threatening and 
lead to sudden cardiac death. Treatment is tailored to the patient's symptoms, 
presentation, and the size and location of the defect.

Management and rehabilitation of neurologic patients with lower urinary tract 
dysfunction.

Drake MJ(1).

Author information:
(1)Bristol Urological Institute, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK. Electronic 
address: Marcus.Drake@nbt.nhs.uk.

Diverse lower urinary tract problems arise in neurologic disease, caused by 
dysfunctions of the bladder and outlet, both during urine storage and voiding. 
Most neurologic diseases cause some lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD), and 
the type of dysfunction is related to the location of the nervous system lesion. 
Clinical evaluation requires identification of risk factors for major morbidity, 
particularly renal dysfunction, and mechanisms underlying symptoms. A holistic 
approach is needed to cover influential aspects (e.g., cognitive function, 
mobility, and urinary tract infections) and related issues (e.g., sexual 
function, bowel function, and autonomic dysreflexia), requiring a 
multidisciplinary team. Comprehensive history and examination are supported by a 
bladder diary, urinalysis, and renal assessment, supplemented by urodynamic 
tests. The simplest classification of neurogenic LUTD describes both bladder and 
sphincter function, cataloging each structure as normal, overactive, or 
underactive. Treatment aims to protect life expectancy and improve quality of 
life, noting the possibility of neurologic disease progression and comorbid 
disorders. Conservative measures include fluid advice and assessment of suitable 
containment products. Urine storage can be improved with antimuscarinic 
medications, bladder injections with botulinum neurotoxin A, and less 
established methods such as nerve stimulation, intravesical instillations, and 
beta-3 agonist. For severe storage dysfunction, sacral neuromodulation or 
surgery to improve reservoir function, increase outlet resistance, or divert the 
urinary tract may be needed. Voiding is usually replaced by intermittent or 
indwelling catheterization, which has largely superseded triggered reflex 
voiding, bladder expression, or sphincterotomy. Treatment selection is hampered 
by a limited, low-quality evidence base.

BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that chronic exposure to transportation 
related noise and air pollution affects human health. However, health burden to 
a country of these two pollutants have been rarely compared.
AIMS: As an input for external cost quantification, we estimated the 
cardiorespiratory health burden from transportation related noise and air 
pollution in Switzerland, incorporating the most recent findings related to the 
health effects of noise.
METHODS: Spatially resolved noise and air pollution models for the year 2010 
were derived for road, rail and aircraft sources. Average day-evening-night 
sound level (Lden) and particulate matter (PM10) were selected as indicators, 
and population-weighted exposures derived by transportation source. 
Cause-specific exposure-response functions were derived from a meta-analysis for 
noise and literature review for PM10. Years of life lost (YLL) were calculated 
using life table methods; population attributable fraction was used for deriving 
attributable cases for hospitalisations, respiratory illnesses, visits to 
general practitioners and restricted activity days.
RESULTS: The mean population weighted exposure above a threshold of 48dB(A) was 
8.74dB(A), 1.89dB(A) and 0.37dB(A) for road, rail and aircraft noise. 
Corresponding mean exposure contributions were 4.4, 0.54, 0.12μg/m(3) for PM10. 
We estimated that in 2010 in Switzerland transportation caused 6000 and 14,000 
YLL from noise and air pollution exposure, respectively. While there were a 
total of 8700 cardiorespiratory hospital days attributed to air pollution 
exposure, estimated burden due to noise alone amounted to 22,500 hospital days.
CONCLUSIONS: YLL due to transportation related pollution in Switzerland is 
dominated by air pollution from road traffic, whereas consequences for morbidity 
and indicators of quality of life are dominated by noise. In terms of total 
external costs the burden of noise equals that of air pollution.

Long-Term Outcome of Prosthetic Valve Replacement in Japanese Patients Aged 65 
Years or Older: Are Guidelines for Prosthetic Valve Selection Based on Overseas 
Data Appropriate for Japanese Patients?

Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.

BACKGROUND: Based on the revised AHA/ACC guidelines, it might be necessary to 
take into consideration the average life expectancy of Japanese people and 
revise the Japanese guidelines accordingly. Accordingly, we performed the 
present study to compare the long-term outcome in patients aged 65 years or 
older who underwent prosthetic valve replacement at our hospital using 
mechanical valves or biological valves.
METHODS: We have performed valve replacement in 416 patients aged 65 years or 
older (mechanical: 157; biological: 244).
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the mechanical and 
biological valve for the actuarial survival rate. As for the valve-related 
complication free rate, in the mechanical valve group, the rates were 
significantly higher for all patients, aortic valve replacement (AVR) patients, 
and mitral valve replacement (MVR) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Following revision of the AHA/ACC guidelines for selection of 
prosthetic valves, it is necessary to investigate whether patients aged 60-70 
represent the gray zone for selecting valves as in US and European guidelines, 
or whether a higher age is more appropriate in view of the longer average life 
expectancy in Japan. Accordingly, further evaluation of the long-term outcome 
for mechanical and biological valves in Japanese patients is needed to obtain 
evidence for preparation of original Japanese guidelines on prosthetic valve 
selection.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for childhood anxiety disorders 
is associated with modest outcomes in the context of parental anxiety disorder.
OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated whether or not the outcome of CBT for children 
with anxiety disorders in the context of maternal anxiety disorders is improved 
by the addition of (i) treatment of maternal anxiety disorders, or (ii) 
treatment focused on maternal responses. The incremental cost-effectiveness of 
the additional treatments was also evaluated.
DESIGN: Participants were randomised to receive (i) child cognitive-behavioural 
therapy (CCBT); (ii) CCBT with CBT to target maternal anxiety disorders 
[CCBT + maternal cognitive-behavioural therapy (MCBT)]; or (iii) CCBT with an 
intervention to target mother-child interactions (MCIs) (CCBT + MCI).
SETTING: A NHS university clinic in Berkshire, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and eleven children with a primary anxiety disorder, 
whose mothers also had an anxiety disorder.
INTERVENTIONS: All families received eight sessions of individual CCBT. Mothers 
in the CCBT + MCBT arm also received eight sessions of CBT targeting their own 
anxiety disorders. Mothers in the MCI arm received 10 sessions targeting 
maternal parenting cognitions and behaviours. Non-specific interventions were 
delivered to balance groups for therapist contact.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary clinical outcomes were the child's primary 
anxiety disorder status and degree of improvement at the end of treatment. 
Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 and 12 months. Outcomes in the 
economic analyses were identified and measured using estimated quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). QALYS were combined with treatment, health and social care 
costs and presented within an incremental cost-utility analysis framework with 
associated uncertainty.
RESULTS: MCBT was associated with significant short-term improvement in maternal 
anxiety; however, after children had received CCBT, group differences were no 
longer apparent. CCBT + MCI was associated with a reduction in maternal 
overinvolvement and more confident expectations of the child. However, neither 
CCBT + MCBT nor CCBT + MCI conferred a significant post-treatment benefit over 
CCBT in terms of child anxiety disorder diagnoses [adjusted risk ratio (RR) 
1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.62, p = 0.29; adjusted RR 
CCBT + MCI vs. control: adjusted RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.67, p = 0.20, 
respectively] or global improvement ratings (adjusted RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00 to 
1.59, p = 0.05; adjusted RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.53, p = 0.13). CCBT + MCI 
outperformed CCBT on some secondary outcome measures. Furthermore, primary 
economic analyses suggested that, at commonly accepted thresholds of 
cost-effectiveness, the probability that CCBT + MCI will be cost-effective in 
comparison with CCBT (plus non-specific interventions) is about 75%.
CONCLUSIONS: Good outcomes were achieved for children and their mothers across 
treatment conditions. There was no evidence of a benefit to child outcome of 
supplementing CCBT with either intervention focusing on maternal anxiety 
disorder or maternal cognitions and behaviours. However, supplementing CCBT with 
treatment that targeted maternal cognitions and behaviours represented a 
cost-effective use of resources, although the high percentage of missing data on 
some economic variables is a shortcoming. Future work should consider whether or 
not effects of the adjunct interventions are enhanced in particular contexts. 
The economic findings highlight the utility of considering the use of a broad 
range of services when evaluating interventions with this client group.

We deduce hypotheses from theories on religious change to explain changes in 
church attendance rates. Using a new dataset with 51 countries across a long 
period we apply panel regression models, which enable us to test well-known 
theories in a more strict and dynamic fashion than do cross-sectional studies. 
Our results provide new evidence for a few old ideas, but also show striking 
lack of evidence for ideas that appear well-accepted. Tertiary education proved 
to be a strong predictor of changes in church attendance. Theories about 
individualization were also supported. The evidence of existential insecurity as 
a cause of change was ambiguous: economic development and life expectancy showed 
significant effects but income inequality did not. We found no support for 
theories on social globalization and social benefit policy. Finally, we found 
that income inequality and urbanization were driving forces of change during the 
70s and 80s, but not since 1990.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and Alzheimer's disease: Partners 
in crime? The hypothesis.

Ulusu NN(1).

Author information:

Turkey. Electronic address: nulusu@ku.edu.tr.

Alzheimer's disease is a multifaceted brain disorder which involves various 
coupled irreversible, progressive biochemical reactions that significantly 
reduce quality of life as well as the actual life expectancy. Aging, genetic 
predispositions, head trauma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, deficiencies in 
insulin signaling, dysfunction of mitochondria-associated membranes, 
cerebrovascular changes, high cholesterol level, increased oxidative stress and 
free radical formation, DNA damage, disturbed energy metabolism, and synaptic 
dysfunction, high blood pressure, obesity, dietary habits, exercise, social 
engagement, and mental stress are noted among the risk factors of this disease. 
In this hypothesis review I would like to draw the attention on 
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and its relationship with 
Alzheimer's disease. This enzymopathy is the most common human congenital defect 
of metabolism and defined by decrease in NADPH+H(+) and reduced form of 
glutathione concentration and that might in turn, amplify oxidative stress due 
to essentiality of the enzyme. This most common enzymopathy may manifest itself 
in severe forms, however most of the individuals with this deficiency are not 
essentially symptomatic. To understand the sporadic Alzheimer's disease, the 
writer of this paper thinks that, looking into a crystal ball might not yield 
much of a benefit but glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency could 
effortlessly give some clues.

[Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy: Report of seven patients].

[Article in Spanish]

Cea G, Jiménez D.

BACKGROUND: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is the third most common 
muscular dystrophy with an estimated prevalence of 1 per 20.000 and a normal 
life expectancy in the majority of patients. However, approximately 15% of 
patients become wheelchair bound in the course of their life. It is a hereditary 
autosomal dominant disease with high (95%) penetrance by the age of 20, but with 
variable degree of phenotypic expression even in the same family group. Symptoms 
frequently start in the second decade of life, with facial and scapular 
weakness.
AIM: To report the clinical features of seven patients with the disease, seen at 
a public hospital.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis of seven patients with genetic study seen in a 
public Hospital in Santiago.
RESULTS: The age of patients fluctuated from 18 to 61 years and four were 
females. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 29 years and four had a family 
history of the disease. The usual presenting complaint was arm or shoulder 
asymmetric weakness. Four patients had bone pain. Facial involvement was present 
in four. A genetic study was done in five patients, the other two patients were 
relatives, confirming the contraction or lower number of repetitions in D4Z4 
region. After 12 years of follow up only 2 patients older than 60 years cannot 
work and one female patients is in a semi dependent state at the age of 30.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical workup in the diagnosis and the timely indication of 
genetic studies are highlighted, to avoid unnecessary and invasive procedures. 
The variability in the phenotypic expression in a similar genetic defect is 
discussed and the genetic or epigenetic mechanisms of this muscular dystrophy 
are described.

Coordination of stem cell activity with inflammatory responses is critical for 
regeneration and homeostasis of barrier epithelia. The temporal sequence of cell 
interactions during injury-induced regeneration is only beginning to be 
understood. Here we show that intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are regulated by 
macrophage-like haemocytes during the early phase of regenerative responses of 
the Drosophila intestinal epithelium. On tissue damage, haemocytes are recruited 
to the intestine and secrete the BMP homologue DPP, inducing ISC proliferation 
by activating the type I receptor Saxophone and the Smad homologue SMOX. 
Activated ISCs then switch their response to DPP by inducing expression of 
Thickveins, a second type I receptor that has previously been shown to 
re-establish ISC quiescence by activating MAD. The interaction between 
haemocytes and ISCs promotes infection resistance, but also contributes to the 
development of intestinal dysplasia in ageing flies. We propose that similar 
interactions influence pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease and 
colorectal cancer in humans.

[Gout and chronic kidney disease: specific diagnostic and therapeutic features].

[Article in Italian]

Cirillo P, Gesualdo L.

In the last decades, the increase in life expectancy, changes in diet and 
lifestyle have resulted in raising of incidence and prevalence of gout in all 
countries. The phenotype of patients with gout has changed a lot over the years: 
more and more frequently they have several co-morbidities such as hypertension, 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
metabolic syndrome that influence the progression and challenge the therapeutic 
management. The management of gout in CKD patients demands more attention and 
specific features in diagnosis and therapeutic approach. This article summarizes 
the most recent published evidences on how to best diagnose and treat the gouty 
patients with CKD, how to better manage medications for the treatment of acute 
gouty flares and for the chronic hyperuricemia management.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of belimumab in patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presenting positive biomarkers and active 
disease despite standard treatment (ST), from the Spanish social perspective.
METHODS: A microsimulation model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
belimumab plus ST versus ST alone. A treatment duration of two years with a 
life-time horizon were considered. Efficacy data were obtained from belimumab 
clinical trials and the evolution of the disease was simulated from John Hopkins 
´ patient cohort data in the United States. Utility data were obtained from 
literature review. Direct and indirect costs were calculated based on Spanish 
published data (€, 2014), applying a discount rate (DR) of 3% to both costs and 
effects. Results were expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
in terms of gained life years (LY) and quality of life adjusted life years 
(QALYs). Probabilistic (PSA) and deterministic sensitivity analyses (DR of 0% 
and 5%, 5-years treatment duration and excluding indirect costs) were performed 
to determine the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 16,647€ per life 
year gained, with an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of 23,158€ per 
additional QALY gained. In 68% of the scenarios simulated in the PSA, belimumab 
was found to be a cost-effective alternative, considering a threshold of 
30,000€/ QALY.
CONCLUSION: Belimumab can be regarded as a cost-effective alternative from the 
Spanish social perspective.

Publisher: Objetivo: Estimar el coste-efectividad (CE) de belimumab en aquellos 
pacientes con biomarcadores positivos y enfermedad activa a pesar del 
tratamiento estandar (TE) desde la perspectiva social espanola. Métodos: A 
partir de un modelo de microsimulacion, que permite simular la evolucion natural 
de la enfermedad, se estimo el CE de belimumab + TE vs. TE. Se considero una 
duracion del tratamiento de dos anos y un horizonte temporal de toda la vida. La 
extrapolacion de eficacia a largo plazo se baso en los ensayos clinicos de 
belimumab y en la cohorte de pacientes John Hopkins de Estados Unidos; los datos 
de utilidades se obtuvieron de la literatura. Se calcularon costes directos e 
indirectos en base a datos espanoles publicados (€, 2014), aplicando una tasa de 
descuento (TD) del 3% tanto a costes como a efectos. Los resultados se 
expresaron como ratio coste- efectividad incremental (ICER) en terminos de anos 
de vida ganados (AVG) y anos de vida ajustados por calidad (AVAC). Se realizaron 
analisis de sensibilidad deterministicos (TD al 0% y 5%, duracion de tratamiento 
5 anos y exclusion de costes indirectos) asi como probabilisticos (PSA). 
Resultados: El ICER de belimumab + TE vs. TE fue de 16.647€/ AVG y 23.158€/AVAC 
respectivamente. La variacion de la TD supuso la mayor variacion de los 
resultados respecto al escenario base. En el 68% de los escenarios simulados en 
el PSA, belimumab fue una alternativa coste-efectiva considerando como umbral 
30.000€/AVAC. Conclusiones: Belimumab puede considerarse una alternativa 
coste-efectiva desde la perspectiva social espanola.

Trastuzumab emtansine in locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive breast 
cancer; GENESIS-SEFH drug evaluation report.

Miranda Romero P(1), Marín Gil R(2).

Trastuzumab emtansina (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate directed against the 
HER2 for the treatment of HER2+ mestastatic breast cancer (MBC), who has 
previously received trastuzumab plus a taxane. According to the results of the 
EMILIA trial versus lapatinib plus capecitabine T-DM1 shows an improvement in 
progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS). It has a 
favorable profile reducing the incidence of grade 3-4 adverse reactions such as 
hand-foot syndrome and diarrhea. On the contrary increases significantly severe 
thrombocytopenia; bleeding risk and liver function should also be monitored. 
With the current import price T-DM1 has a cost per QALY of over 120,000 €. The 
price of the drug for the Spanish NHS has not yet been established. Drug cost 
would be the key factor in the sensitivity analysis and a 50% reduction in the 
price of the drug would place it close to the threshold of cost-effectiveness 
usually considered in our midst. According to the budget impact model used, a 
maximum of 1,218 patients / year and the budgetary impact throughout the Spanish 
state would be at € 70,490,850. In the initial analysis no advantage was found 
for T-DM1 in those patients without visceral involvement. Although a subsequent 
re-analysis of the results of PFS in which the definition of visceral 
involvement was specified a significant benefit was shown in this subgroup. We 
believe that this approach introduces a high degree of uncertainty, which does 
not guarantee the benefit achieved for this subgroup of patients.

Publisher: T-DM1 es un conjugado anticuerpo-farmaco dirigido contra el HER2 para 
el tratamiento del cancer de mama metastasico (CMM) HER2 +, que ha recibido 
previamente trastuzumab mas un taxano. De acuerdo con los resultados del ensayo 
EMILIA frente a lapatinib mas capecitabina T-DM1 muestra una mejora en la 
supervivencia libre de progresion (SLP) y la supervivencia global (SG). Tiene un 
perfil favorable reducir la incidencia de reacciones adversas grado 3-4 tales 
como el sindrome mano- pie y la diarrea. Sin embargo, aumenta significativamente 
el riesgo de trombocitopenia grave y debe monitorizarse el riesgo de hemorragia 
y la funcion hepatica. Con el precio de importacion actual T-DM1 tiene un coste 
por AVAC de mas de 120.000 €. El precio del farmaco para el Sistema Nacional de 
Salud en Espana aun no ha sido establecido. El precio del farmaco seria el 
factor clave en el analisis de sensibilidad y una reduccion del 50% en el precio 
lo situaria cerca del umbral de coste-efectividad generalmente considerada en 
nuestro medio como aceptable. De acuerdo con el modelo de impacto presupuestario 
utilizado, se trataria un maximo de 1.218 pacientes / ano y el impacto 
presupuestario de todo el estado espanol estaria entorno a 70.490.850 € para 
este volumen de pacientes. En el analisis inicial no se encontro ninguna ventaja 
para T-DM1 en aquellos pacientes sin afectacion visceral. Aunque un re-analisis 
posterior de los resultados de SLP en el que se especifica la definicion de la 
afectacion visceral se muestra un beneficio significativo en este subgrupo. 
Creemos que este enfoque presenta un alto grado de incertidumbre, y no garantiza 
el beneficio logrado para este subgrupo de pacientes.

[Kidney Transplantation and inborn errors of metabolism].

[Article in Italian]

Capelli I, Battaglino G, Baraldi O, Ravaioli M, Cuna V, Moretti I, Angeletti A, 
Mencarelli F, Pasini A, Montini G, Pinna AD, La Manna G.

Inherited kidney diseases constitute at least 150 different disorders and they 
have an overall prevalence of about 6080 cases per 100 000 in Europe and in USA. 
At least 10% of adults and nearly all children who progress to renal-replacement 
therapy have an inherited kidney disease, representing the fifth most common 
cause of end-stage renal disease after diabetes, hypertension, 
glomerulonephritis, and pyelonephritis. These conditions include both structural 
and functional disorders, among which are counted diseases resulting from inborn 
errors of metabolism (IEM). Some inborn errors of metabolism primarily affect 
kidney and because of progress in renal replacement therapy, patients with 
inherited kidney disorders rarely die when their disease progresses and can live 
for many years. However, these patients often have compromised health with a 
poor quality of life. Renal transplantation offers a viable treatment option for 
those inborn errors of metabolism characterized by primary renal damage caused 
by dysfunction of a mutated protein, as in cystinuria. In this case, the 
indication to renal transplantation makes it possible to overcome the specific 
enzyme defect. However this option remains valid even when the genetic defect is 
expressed systemically and renal involvement is just one of the clinical 
manifestations of the disease, as in Anderson-Fabry disease, cystinosis, 
hereditary amyloidosis and primary hyperoxaluria. In these conditions, renal 
transplantation is combined with the liver (primary hyperoxaluria) or cardiac 
transplant (familial amyloidosis) improving the quality and life expectancy of 
patients.

INTRODUCTION: Cost-utility assessment of first-line actinic keratosis (AK) 
treatments for max 25 cm2 AK field.
METHODS: A probabilistic, 2-year decision tree model was used to assess costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), 
cost-effectiveness efficiency frontier, cost-effectiveness acceptability 
frontier (CEAF), and expected value of perfect information (EVPI) of AK 
treatments from the Finnish health care payer perspective with 3% discounting 
per annum. In the model, the first-line AK treatment resulted in complete 
clearance (CC) or non-CC with or without local skin responses (LSR), or AK 
recurrence. Non-CC AK was treated with methyl aminolevulinate+photodynamic 
therapy (MAL+PDT), and AK recurrence was retreated with the previous effective 
treatment. Costs included primary and secondary health care, outpatient drugs, 
and LSR management. QALYs were assessed with the EuroQol (EQ-5D-3L). Result 
robustness was assessed with sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The mean simulated per patient QALYs (costs) were 1.526 (€982) for 
MAL+PDT, 1.524 (€794) for ingenol mebutate gel (IngMeb) 0.015% (3 days), 1.522 
(€869) for IngMeb 0.05% (2 days), 1.520 (€1062) for diclofenac 3% (12 weeks), 
1.518 (€885) for imiquimod 3.75% (6 weeks), 1.517 (€781) for imiquimod 5% (4/8 
weeks), and 1.514 (€1114) for cryosurgery when treating AK affecting any body 
part. IngMeb 0.015% was less costly and more effective (dominating) than other 
AK treatments indicated for face and scalp area with the exception of imiquimod 
5% for which the ICER was estimated at €1933/QALY gained and MAL+PDT, which had 
an ICER of €82,607/QALY gained against IngMeb 0.015%. With willingness-to-pay 
€2526-18,809/QALY gained, IngMeb 0.015% had >50% probability for 
cost-effectiveness on the CEAF. IngMeb 0.05% dominated AK treatments indicated 
for trunk and extremities. EVPIs for face and scalp (trunk and extremities) 
analyses were €26 (€0), €86 (€58), and €250 (€169) per patient with the 
willingness-to-pay of €0, €15,000, and €30,000 per QALY gained, respectively.
CONCLUSION: IngMebs were cost-effective AK treatments in Finland.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of celecoxib and non-selective 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of osteoarthritis in 
clinical practice in Spain.
METHODS: A decision-tree model using distribution, doses, treatment duration and 
incidence of GI and CV events observed in the pragmatic PROBE-designed 
«GI-Reasons» trial was used for cost-effectiveness. Effectiveness was expressed 
in terms of event averted and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained. QALY 
were calculated based on utility decrement in case of any adverse events 
reported in GI-Reasons trial. The National Health System perspective in Spain 
was applied; cost calculations included current prices of drugs plus cost of 
adverse events occurred. The analysis was expressed as an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained and per event averted. One-way and 
probabilistic analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Compared with non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, at 
current prices, celecoxib treatment had higher overall treatment costs €201 and 
€157, respectively. However, celecoxib was associated with a slight increase in 
QALY gain and significantly lower incidence of gastrointestinal events (p<.001), 
with mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €13,286 per QALY gained and 
€4,471 per event averted. Sensitivity analyses were robust, and confirmed the 
results of the base case.
CONCLUSION: Celecoxib at current price may be considered as a cost-effective 
alternative vs. non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the 
treatment of osteoarthritis in daily practice in the Spanish NHS.

BACKGROUND: Dietary patterns have been associated with the incidence or 
mortality of individual non-communicable diseases, but their association with 
disease burden has received little attention.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to relate dietary patterns to health 
expectancy using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as outcome parameter.
METHODS: Data from the EPIC-NL study were used, a prospective cohort study of 
33,066 healthy men and women aged 20-70 years at recruitment. A lifestyle 
questionnaire and a validated food frequency questionnaire were administered at 
study entry (1993-1997). Five dietary patterns were studied: three a priori 
patterns (the modified Mediterranean Diet Score (mMDS), the WHO-based Healthy 
Diet Indicator (HDI) and the Dutch Healthy Diet index (DHD-index)) and two a 
posteriori data-based patterns. QALYs were used as a summary health measure for 
healthy life expectancy, combining a person's life expectancy with a weight 
reflecting loss of quality of life associated with having chronic diseases.
RESULTS: The mean QALYs of the participants were 74.9 (standard deviation 4.4). 
A higher mMDS and HDI were associated with a longer life in good health. 
Participants who had a high mMDS score (6-9) had 0.17 [95% CI, 0.05; 0.30] more 
QALYs than participants with a low score (0-3), equivalent to two months longer 
life in good health. Participants with a high HDI score also had more QALYs 
(0.15 [95% CI, 0.03; 0.27]) than participants with a low HDI score.
CONCLUSION: A Mediterranean-type diet and the Healthy Diet Indicator were 
associated with approximately 2months longer life in good health.

The health benefits of exercise are well established, yet individuals with 
serious mental illness (SMI) have a shorter life expectancy due in large part to 
physical health complications associated with poor diet and lack of exercise. 
There is a paucity of research examining exercise in this population with the 
majority of studies having examined interventions with limited feasibility and 
sustainability. Before developing an intervention, a thorough exploration of 
client and clinician perspectives on exercise and its associated barriers is 
warranted. Twelve clients and fourteen clinicians participated in focus groups 
aimed at examining exercise, barriers, incentives, and attitudes about walking 
groups. Results indicated that clients and clinicians identified walking as the 
primary form of exercise, yet barriers impeded consistent participation. 
Distinct themes arose between groups; however, both clients and clinicians 
reported interest in a combination group/pedometer based walking program for 
individuals with SMI. Future research should consider examining walking programs 
for this population.

Medical technology has impacted the overall life expectancy. Many conditions 
traditionally considered fatal are now curable. Surviving chronic diseases and 
aging of the population have increased the number of people with chronic pain. 
Many devices are also available to manage severe refractory pain. As such, 
implantable drug-delivery system (IDDS) is a small battery-powered, programmable 
pump implanted under the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen and connected to a 
small catheter tunneled into the spine. Implantable drug-delivery system is used 
for the administration of morphine, ziconotide, baclofen, or their mixtures into 
the cerebrospinal fluid. Like many medical devices, IDDS has technical glitch 
which limits its performance under certain conditions. Implantable drug-delivery 
system is susceptible to magnetic field such as a magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) which can temporarily stall the rotor of the pump motor and suspend drug 
delivery. We encountered a patient from out of town seen at emergency department 
with increased pain and symptoms of opiates withdrawal after intermittent IDDS 
malfunction. He denied any exposure to magnetic fields or MRI. However, the pump 
interrogation showed multiple motor stall events in the event log. After a 
detailed inquiry, the most likely cause of pump malfunction appears to be 
frequent placement of a laptop computer on his abdomen close to the pump. The 
magnets in the laptop speakers may have caused the rotor of the pump motor to 
stall during the computer use, and frequent stall has caused symptoms of 
withdrawal. No other mechanical failures were found. The patient was discharged 
home after the symptoms resolved, and the pump was reprogrammed.

Diabetes is one of the most common chronic medical disorders in children. The 
management of diabetes remains a substantial burden on children with diabetes 
and their families, despite improvements in treatment and rates of morbidity and 
mortality. Although most children with diabetes have type 1 diabetes, the 
increasing recognition of type 2 diabetes and genetic forms of diabetes in the 
paediatric population has important treatment implications. Diabetes therapy
