Extension of the medicinal chemistry toolbox is in the vital interest of drug 
designers. However, the diffusion of an innovation can be a lengthy process. 
Along these lines, it took almost 70 years before the use of the sulfoximine 
group reached a critical mass in medicinal chemistry. Even though interest in 
this versatile functional group has increased exponentially in recent years, 
there is ample room for further innovative applications. This Review highlights 
emerging trends and opportunities for drug designers for the utilization of the 
sulfoximine group in medicinal chemistry, such as in the construction of complex 
molecules, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody-drug conjugates 
(ADCs) and novel warheads for covalent inhibition.

INTRODUCTION: Aspiration pneumonia is a common problem among older adults; it 
has a high mortality rate and the prevalence is increasing. Reports on the risk 
factors for mortality in patients with aspiration pneumonia are limited. This 
study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for 90-day survival in patients with 
aspiration pneumonia.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted at Seirei 
Mikatahara General Hospital between 1 April 2015 and 31 March 2016. Patients 
with aspiration pneumonia who had dysphagia or aspiration confirmed by modified 
water swallow test or VideoEndoscopic examination of swallowing were included. 
The primary endpoint was 90-day survival. We performed univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression analyses with survival and non-survival at 
90 days as the independent variables.
RESULTS: A total of 276 patients were recruited for this study. The A-DROP score 
(odds ratio [OR] = 2.440; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.400-4.270; p < 0.01), 
Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index score (OR = 0.383; 95% CI, 0.178-0.824; 
p < 0.05) and sex (OR = 0.365; 95% CI, 0.153-0.869; p < 0.05) were independent 
early predictors of mortality.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that nutritional status and the severity of 
pneumonia are important factors that predict life expectancy in patients with 
aspiration pneumonia.

OBJECTIVES: Evaluate effects of long-term bimekizumab treatment on 
patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, symptoms and the impact of PsA on 
patients.
METHODS: Patients with active PsA were enrolled into BE ACTIVE, a 48-week 
randomised controlled trial (NCT02969525). After Week 48, patients could enter a 
104-week open-label extension (NCT03347110), receiving bimekizumab 160 mg every 
four weeks. PRO measures assessed included arthritis pain visual analogue scale 
(VAS), PsA Impact of Disease (PsAID)-9, 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) and 
HAQ-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Results were analysed as mean (S.E.M.) changes 
from baseline (CfB) from Week 0 to the end of the open-label extension (3 years) 
and as percentage of patients reaching patient-acceptable symptom state (PASS) 
for global impact (PsAID-9 total score ≤4) and normal function (HAQ-DI total 
score <0.5). Non-responder imputation was applied to missing binary outcomes.
RESULTS: In 206 patients (mean age 49.3 years, 51.0% male), completion rate was 
high; 161 (78.2%) patients completed Week 152. Bimekizumab treatment was 
associated with long-term sustained improvements in pain [arthritis pain VAS 
CfB; Week 48: -29.9 (1.9); Week 152: -32.0 (1.9)] and fatigue [PsAID-9 fatigue 
CfB; -2.4 (0.2); -2.7 (0.2)]. High percentages of patients achieved acceptable 
symptom state (PsAID-9 PASS: 75.2%; 65.0%) and normalised function (HAQ-DI <0.5: 
49.0%; 46.1%). Improvements in patient global assessment and SF-36 Physical 
Component Summary were also sustained.
CONCLUSIONS: Bimekizumab treatment was associated with long-term sustained 
improvements in pain and fatigue, reducing overall impact of PsA on patients. 
Physical function and quality of life improved up to 3 years.

Optimization of Dechlorination Experiment Design Using Lightweight Deep Learning 
Model.

This exploration intends to remove chloride ions in production and life, enhance 
buildings' durability, and protect the natural environment from pollution. The 
current dechlorination technology is discussed based on the relevant theories, 
such as the lightweight deep learning (DL) model and chloride ion 
characteristics. Next, data statistics and comparative analysis methods are used 
to study the adsorption and desorption performance of dechlorination adsorbents. 
Finally, the lightweight DL model is introduced into the chloride diffusion 
prediction experiment of slag powder and fly ash concrete. The results show that 
in the study of dechlorination adsorption performance, the chloride ion 
concentration decreases gradually with the extension of adsorption time. 
However, with the increasing temperature, the chloride ion removal rate is 
increasing. The removal rate of chloride ions in water can decrease slowly with 
the increase of adsorbent. Therefore, selecting the 2 mol/L sodium hydroxide as 
the alkali concentration for adsorbent regeneration is the most appropriate. 
Besides, the regeneration performance of the adsorbent gradually declines with 
the increase of sodium chloride concentration in the solution. The lightweight 
DL model is applied to the chloride diffusion prediction experiment of slag 
powder and fly ash concrete. It is found that when the curing age is selected at 
18 days, 90 days, and 180 days, respectively, the error between the lightweight 
DL model and the experimental results is about 0.2. It shows that the 
lightweight DL model is feasible for predicting the diffusion of chloride ions. 
Therefore, this exploration designs and studies the dechlorination experiment 
based on the lightweight DL model, which provides a new theoretical basis and 
optimization direction for removing chloride ions in the future industry.

Management of Physical Symptoms in Patients with Advanced Cancer during the Last 
Weeks and Days of Life.

Azhar A(1), Hui D(1).

University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

Patients with advanced cancer are faced with many devastating symptoms in the 
last weeks and days of life, such as pain, delirium, dyspnea, bronchial 
hypersecretions (death rattle) and intractable seizures. Symptom management in 
the last weeks of life can be particularly challenging because of the high 
prevalence of delirium complicating symptom assessment, high symptom expression 
secondary to psychosocial and spiritual factors, limited life-expectancy 
requiring special considerations for prognosis-based decision-making, and 
distressed caregivers. There is a paucity of research involving patients in the 
last weeks of life, contributing to substantial variations in clinical practice. 
In this narrative review, we shall review the existing literature and provide a 
practical approach to in-patient management of several of the most distressing 
physical symptoms in the last weeks to days of life.

BACKGROUND: The Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12) is a generic 
patient-reported outcome measure derived from the widely used 36- and 12-item 
Short Form Health Surveys. We aimed to estimate a Canadian preference-based 
scoring algorithm for the VR-12, enabling the derivation of health utility 
values for generating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
METHODS: We conducted a discrete-choice experiment in a sample of the Canadian 
population in January and February 2019. Participants - recruited from a 
consumer research panel - completed an online survey, in English or French, that 
included 11 discrete-choice questions, each comprising 2 health profiles. We 
defined the health profiles using 8 VR-12 items and a duration attribute. Using 
conditional logit regressions, where each level of the respective VR-12 items 
was interacted with duration, we applied the coefficients to estimate health 
utility values interpretable on a scale of 0 (dead) to 1 (full health). Negative 
values reflect states considered worse than dead.
RESULTS: A total of 3380 individuals completed the survey. Of these, 1688 
(49.9%) were females, and 3101 (91.7%) completed the English version of the 
survey. Across all models, "feel downhearted and blue all of the time" and "pain 
interferes with your normal work extremely" were associated with the largest 
decrements in health utility. Excluding the 685 respondents (20.3%) who provided 
inconsistent responses had a negligible effect on the results. The recommended 
model, weighted to match population demographics, had health utility values 
ranging from -0.589 to 1.000.
INTERPRETATION: Health utility values that reflect the preferences of the 
Canadian population can now be derived from responses to the VR-12. These values 
can be used to generate QALYs in future analyses.

BACKGROUND: Between 2 and 43% of patients who receive a new prescription in PC 
do not initiate their treatments. Non-initiation is associated with poorer 
clinical outcomes, more sick leave and higher costs to the healthcare system. 
Existing evidence suggests that shared decision-making positively impacts 
medication initiation. The IMA-cRCT assesses the effectiveness of the IMA 
intervention in improving adherence and clinical parameters compared to usual 
care in patients with a new treatment for cardiovascular disease and diabetes 
prescribed in PC, and its cost-effectiveness, through a cRCT and economic 
modelling.
METHODS: The IMA intervention is a shared decision-making intervention based on 
the Theoretical Model of Non-initiation. A cRCT will be conducted in 24 PC teams 
in Catalonia (Spain), randomly assigned to the intervention group (1:1), and 
community pharmacies in the catchment areas of the intervention PC teams. 
Healthcare professionals in the intervention group will apply the intervention 
to all patients who receive a new prescription for cardiovascular disease or 
diabetes treatment (no other prescription from the same pharmacological group in 
the previous 6 months). All the study variables will be collected from 
real-world databases for the 12 months before and after receiving a new 
prescription. Effectiveness analyses will assess impact on initiation, secondary 
adherence, cardiovascular risk, clinical parameters and cardiovascular events. 
Cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted as part of the cRCT from a 
healthcare and societal perspective in terms of extra cost per cardiovascular 
risk reduction and improved adherence; all analyses will be clustered. Economic 
models will be built to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of the IMA 
intervention, in terms of extra cost for gains in QALY and life expectancy, 
using clinical trial data and data from previous studies.
DISCUSSION: The IMA-cRCT represents an innovative approach to the design and 
evaluation of behavioural interventions that use the principles of complex 
interventions, pragmatic trials and implementation research. This study will 
provide evidence on the IMA intervention and on a new methodology for developing 
and evaluating complex interventions. The results of the study will be 
disseminated among stakeholders to facilitate its transferability to clinical 
practice.

BACKGROUND: Global plastic production has increased exponentially since the 
1960s, with more than 6300 million metric tons of plastic waste generated to 
date. Studies have found a range of human health outcomes associated with 
exposure to plastic chemicals. However, only a fraction of plastic chemicals 
used have been studied in vivo, and then often in animals, for acute 
toxicological effects. With many questions still unanswered about how long-term 
exposure to plastic impacts human health, there is an urgent need to map human 
in vivo research conducted to date, casting a broad net by searching terms for a 
comprehensive suite of plastic chemical exposures and the widest range of health 
domains.
METHODS: This protocol describes a scoping review that will follow the 
recommended framework outlined in the 2017 Guidance for the Conduct of Joanna 
Briggs Institute (JBI) Scoping Reviews, to be reported in accordance with 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for 
Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Checklist. A literature search of primary clinical 
studies in English from 1960 onwards will be conducted in MEDLINE (Ovid) and 
EMBASE (Ovid) databases. References eligible for inclusion will be identified 
through a quality-controlled, multi-level screening process. Extracted data will 
be presented in diagrammatic and tabular form, with a narrative summary 
addressing the review questions.
DISCUSSION: This scoping review will comprehensively map the primary research 
undertaken to date on plastic exposure and human health. Secondary outputs will 
include extensive databases on plastic chemicals and human health 
outcomes/impacts.

Most of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases are sporadic and occur after age 65. With 
prolonged life expectancy and general population aging, AD is becoming a 
significant public health concern. The immune system supports brain development, 
plasticity, and homeostasis, yet it is particularly vulnerable to aging-related 
changes. Aging of the immune system, called immunosenescence, is the 
multifaceted remodeling of the immune system during aging. Immunosenescence is a 
contributing factor to various age-related diseases, including AD. Age-related 
changes in brain immune cell phenotype and function, crosstalk between immune 
cells and neural cells, and neuroinflammation work together to promote 
neurodegeneration and age-related cognitive impairment. Although numerous 
studies have confirmed the correlation between systemic immune changes and AD, 
few studies focus on the immune state of brain microenvironment in aging and AD. 
This review mainly addresses the changes of brain immune microenvironment in 
aging and AD. Specifically, we delineate how various aspects of the brain immune 
microenvironment, including immune gateways, immune cells, and molecules, and 
the interplay between immune cells and neural cells, accelerate AD pathogenesis 
during aging. We also propose a theoretical framework of therapeutic strategies 
selectively targeting the different mechanisms to restore brain immune 
homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: Menopause is an important life stage for women, which can bring 
along sex- ual and cardiac problems. Increased heart rate variability is an 
indicator of parasympa- thetic activity and is associated with mental and 
physical health and life expectancy. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of 
sexual activity (only penile-vaginal intercourse but not masturbation or 
non-coital sex with a partner) on heart rate variability in healthy menopausal 
women.
METHODS: We evaluated 130 menopausal patients aged 45-60 years, without chronic 
dis- ease. The average weekly sexual activity numbers remembered in the last 1 
year were questioned. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the 
presence of sexual activity. The sexually active group was divided into 
subgroups as 1 per week and 2 or more per week. Menopause Rating Scale was 
applied for menopausal symptoms. Heart rate variability was analyzed from the 
24-hour electrocardiography Holter recording.
RESULTS: Heart rate variability parameters were higher in the sexually active 
group than in the sexually inactive group (mean of the standard deviations of 
all the NN intervals for each 5 min segment of a 24-hour heart rate variability 
recording: P = .004; root mean square of differences between adjacent normal RR 
intervals, expressed in ms: P=.001; number of NN intervals exceeding 50 
milliseconds: P = .011; percentage of adjacent RR intervals with a difference of 
duration >50 ms: P = .009; low frequency: P = .011; high fre- quency: P=.008, 
low frequency/high frequency: P=.018). When assessed by multiple linear 
regression analysis by adjusting for age, body mass index, and menopause dura- 
tion, the variables mean of the standard deviations of all the NN intervals for 
each 5 min segment of a 24-hour heart rate variability recording, root mean 
square of differences between adjacent normal RR intervals, expressed in ms, and 
low frequency were inde- pendently associated with the number of sexual 
activities per week (B = 2.89 ± 1.02, 95% CI = 0.866-4.91, P = .005; B = 4.57 ± 
1.83, 95% CI = 0.94-8.2, P = .014; and B = 1174.9 ± 592.2, 95% CI = 2.9-2346.9, 
P = .049, respectively).
CONCLUSION: In healthy menopausal women, continued sexual activity with 
penile-vagi- nal intercourse is associated with better health outcomes on 
cardiac autonomic function through higher heart rate variability, an index of 
parasympathetic activity.

Aquatic food products (AFPs) are primarily preferred by consumers due to their 
high-quality protein content, omega 3 fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and low 
calories. However, AFPs are easily degraded by microbial, enzymatic, and 
chemical reactions. The cold storage, freezing, chemical preservation, salting 
as well as vacuum packaging systems are the major preservation techniques. 
However, they are insufficient to extend the shelf life of AFPs. Therefore, 
researchers have focused on the availability of nanotechnology to be used in 
AFPs in line with the changing consumer demands. Studies on the effectiveness of 
nanoemulsion, nanoparticle, and nanofiber forms to increment the shelf life of 
AFPs are rapidly increasing. In this review, the degradation mechanisms of AFPs, 
the nano-preservation approaches, and possible mechanisms of action are reviewed 
with the current knowledge. The article highlights that nano-preservation 
approaches in AFPs have better microbial and physicochemical parameters such as 
total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), peroxide value 
(PV), free fatty acid (FFA), pH as well as the shelf life extension compared to 
the conventional methods. The antimicrobial activity of nanostructures reduces 
the microbial load of AFPs and delays the onset of oxidative degradation. 
Consequently, researchers suggest that nano-approaches may have great potential 
in extending the shelf life of AFPs.

Due to the high morbidity and mortality with limited life expectancy of dialysis 
patients, it is essential to implement advance care planning in order to know 
patients' values and care preferences and respect their autonomy. However, 
advance care planning is rarely carried out, due to the difficulties in 
initiating end-of-life discussions, both by patients and healthcare 
professionals. The use of "serious games" in the form of card games has shown 
promise in supporting the implementation of advance care planning. In this 
article, we present the development process of an advance care planning 
intervention for dialysis patients using a card game (the Go Wish), in the 
Division of Nephrology of the University Hospitals of Geneva.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality in 
Argentina, considering temporal trends in life expectancy at birth and premature 
mortality rate during 2010-2020.
METHODS: Based on demographic projections, this ecological time-series study 
compares a "normal" versus a "COVID-19" mortality scenario for 2020 over a set 
of 11 Argentine provinces. Annual life expectancy at birth and age-standardized 
rates of premature mortality were estimated from 2010 to 2020. Joinpoint 
regression and multilevel models were used.
RESULTS: A potential reduction in life expectancy at birth (a gap between 
scenarios >1 year) was observed. A significant (negative) point of inflection in 
temporal trends was identified for the country and most of the provinces, under 
the COVID-19 mortality scenario. However, our findings reveal disparities 
between provinces in the estimated life expectancy reduction toward 2020 (values 
range from -0.63 to -1.85 year in females and up to -2.55 years in males). While 
men showed more accentuated declines in life expectancy at birth in 2020 (a 
national gap between scenarios of -1.47 year in men vs. -1.35 year in women), 
women experienced more unfavorable temporal trends of premature mortality. In 
the absence of COVID-19, an improvement in both indicators was estimated toward 
2020 in both sexes, while a return to levels reported in the past was observed 
under the COVID-19 scenario.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic might seriously affect the trends of mortality 
and exacerbate health disadvantages in Argentina. A temporal and contextual 
perspective of health inequities merits special attention in the COVID-19 
research.

Even though formal education is considered a key determinant of individual 
well-being globally, enrollment in secondary schooling remains low in many low- 
and middle-income countries, suggesting that the perceived returns to such 
schooling may be low. We jointly estimate survival and monetary benefits of 
secondary schooling using detailed demographic and surveillance data from the 
Boucle du Mouhoun region, Burkina Faso, where national upper secondary schooling 
completion rates are among the lowest globally (<10%). We first explore 
surveillance data from the Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance System from 
1992 to 2016 to determine long-term differences in survival outcomes between 
secondary and higher and primary schooling using Cox proportional hazards 
models. To estimate average increases in asset holdings associated with 
secondary schooling, we use regionally representative data from the Burkina Faso 
Demographic Health Surveys (2003, 2010, 2014, 2017-18; N = 3,924). Survival was 
tracked for 14,892 individuals. Each year of schooling was associated with a 
mortality reduction of up to 16% (95% CI 0.75-0.94), implying an additional 1.9 
years of life expectancy for men and 5.1 years for women for secondary schooling 
compared to individuals completing only primary school. Relative to individuals 
with primary education, individuals with secondary or higher education held 26% 
more assets (SE 0.02; CI 0.22-0.30). Economic returns for women were 3% points 
higher than male returns with 10% (SE 0.03; CI 0.04-0.16) vs. 7% (SE 0.02; CI 
0.02-0.012) and in rural areas 20% points higher than in urban areas with 30% 
(SE 0.06; CI 0.19-0.41) vs. 4% (SE 0.01; CI 0.02-0.07). Our results suggest that 
secondary education is associated with substantial health and economic benefits 
in the study area and should therefore be considered by researchers, 
governments, and other major stakeholders to create for example school promotion 
programs.

BACKGROUND: Taenia solium is the most significant global foodborne parasite and 
the leading cause of preventable human epilepsy in low and middle-income 
countries in the form of neurocysticercosis.
OBJECTIVES: This scoping review aimed to examine the methodology of 
peer-reviewed studies that estimate the burden of T. solium using 
disability-adjusted life years.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies must have calculated disability-adjusted life 
years relating to T. solium.
CHARTING METHODS: The review process was managed by a single reviewer using 
Rayyan. Published data relating to disease models, data sources, 
disability-adjusted life years, sensitivity, uncertainty, missing data, and key 
limitations were collected.
RESULTS: 15 studies were included for review, with seven global and eight 
national or sub-national estimates. Studies primarily employed attributional 
disease models that relied on measuring the occurrence of epilepsy before 
applying an attributable fraction to estimate the occurrence of 
neurocysticercosis-associated epilepsy. This method relies heavily on the 
extrapolation of observational studies across populations and time periods; 
however, it is currently required due to the difficulties in diagnosing 
neurocysticercosis. Studies discussed that a lack of data was a key limitation 
and their results likely underestimate the true burden of T. solium. Methods to 
calculate disability-adjusted life years varied across studies with differences 
in approaches to time discounting, age weighting, years of life lost, and years 
of life lived with disability. Such differences limit the ability to compare 
estimates between studies.
CONCLUSIONS: This review illustrates the complexities associated with T. solium 
burden of disease studies and highlights the potential need for a burden of 
disease reporting framework. The burden of T. solium is likely underestimated 
due to the challenges in diagnosing neurocysticercosis and a lack of available 
data. Advancement in diagnostics, further observational studies, and new 
approaches to parameterising disease models are required if estimates are to 
improve.

BACKGROUND: In breast cancer management, age-related practice variation is 
widespread, with older women having lower rates of surgery and chemotherapy than 
younger women, based on the premise of reduced treatment tolerance and benefit. 
This may contribute to inferior outcomes. There are currently no age- and 
fitness-stratified guidelines on which to base treatment recommendations.
AIM: We aimed to optimise treatment choice and outcomes for older women (aged 
≥ 70 years) with operable breast cancer.
OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to (1) determine the age, comorbidity, frailty, 
disease stage and biology thresholds for endocrine therapy alone versus surgery 
plus adjuvant endocrine therapy, or adjuvant chemotherapy versus no 
chemotherapy, for older women with breast cancer; (2) optimise survival outcomes 
for older women by improving the quality of treatment decision-making; (3) 
develop and evaluate a decision support intervention to enhance shared 
decision-making; and (4) determine the degree and causes of treatment variation 
between UK breast units.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was used to determine age and fitness 
thresholds for treatment allocation. Mixed-methods research was used to 
determine the information needs of older women to develop a decision support 
intervention. A cluster-randomised trial was used to evaluate the impact of this 
decision support intervention on treatment choices and outcomes. Health economic 
analysis was used to evaluate the cost–benefit ratio of different treatment 
strategies according to age and fitness criteria. A mixed-methods study was used 
to determine the degree and causes of variation in treatment allocation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were enhanced age- and 
fitness-specific decision support leading to improved quality-of-life outcomes 
in older women (aged ≥ 70 years) with early breast cancer.
RESULTS: (1) Cohort study: the study recruited 3416 UK women aged ≥ 70 years 
(median age 77 years). Follow-up was 52 months. (a) The surgery plus adjuvant 
endocrine therapy versus endocrine therapy alone comparison: 2854 out of 3416 
(88%) women had oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer, 2354 of whom received 
surgery plus adjuvant endocrine therapy and 500 received endocrine therapy 
alone. Patients treated with endocrine therapy alone were older and frailer than 
patients treated with surgery plus adjuvant endocrine therapy. Unmatched overall 
survival and breast-cancer-specific survival were higher in the surgery plus 
adjuvant endocrine therapy group (overall survival: hazard ratio 0.27, 95% 
confidence interval 0.23 to 0.33; p < 0.001; breast-cancer-specific survival: 
hazard ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.58; p < 0.001) than in the 
endocrine therapy alone group. In matched analysis, surgery plus adjuvant 
endocrine therapy was still associated with better overall survival (hazard 
ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.98; p = 0.04) than endocrine 
therapy alone, but not with better breast-cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio 
0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.40 to 1.37; p = 0.34) or 
progression-free-survival (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 
2.26; p = 0.78). (b) The adjuvant chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy 
comparison: 2811 out of 3416 (82%) women received surgery plus adjuvant 
endocrine therapy, of whom 1520 (54%) had high-recurrence-risk breast cancer 
[grade 3, node positive, oestrogen receptor negative or human epidermal growth 
factor receptor-2 positive, or a high Oncotype DX® (Genomic Health, Inc., 
Redwood City, CA, USA) score of > 25]. In this high-risk population, there were 
no differences according to adjuvant chemotherapy use in overall survival or 
breast-cancer-specific survival after propensity matching. Adjuvant chemotherapy 
was associated with a lower risk of metastatic recurrence than no chemotherapy 
in the unmatched (adjusted hazard ratio 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 
0.68; p = 0.002) and propensity-matched patients (adjusted hazard ratio 0.43, 
95% confidence interval 0.20 to 0.92; p = 0.03). Adjuvant chemotherapy improved 
the overall survival and breast-cancer-specific survival of patients with 
oestrogen-receptor-negative disease. (2) Mixed-methods research to develop a 
decision support intervention: an iterative process was used to develop two 
decision support interventions (each comprising a brief decision aid, a booklet 
and an online tool) specifically for older women facing treatment choices 
(endocrine therapy alone or surgery plus adjuvant endocrine therapy, and 
adjuvant chemotherapy or no chemotherapy) using several evidence sources (expert 
opinion, literature and patient interviews). The online tool was based on models 
developed using registry data from 23,842 patients and validated on an external 
data set of 14,526 patients. Mortality rates at 2 and 5 years differed by < 1% 
between predicted and observed values. (3) Cluster-randomised clinical trial of 
decision support tools: 46 UK breast units were randomised (intervention, 
n = 21; usual care, n = 25), recruiting 1339 women (intervention, n = 670; usual 
care, n = 669). There was no significant difference in global quality of life at 
6 months post baseline (difference –0.20, 95% confidence interval –2.7 to 2.3; 
p = 0.90). In women offered a choice of endocrine therapy alone or surgery plus 
adjuvant endocrine therapy, knowledge about treatments was greater in the 
intervention arm than the usual care arm (94% vs. 74%; p = 0.003). Treatment 
choice was altered, with higher rates of endocrine therapy alone than of surgery 
in the intervention arm. Similarly, chemotherapy rates were lower in the 
intervention arm (endocrine therapy alone rate: intervention sites 21% vs. 
usual-care sites 15%, difference 5.5%, 95% confidence interval 1.1% to 10.0%; 
p = 0.02; adjuvant chemotherapy rate: intervention sites 10% vs. usual-care site 
15%, difference 4.5%, 95% confidence interval 0.0% to 8.0%; p = 0.013). Survival 
was similar in both arms. (4) Health economic analysis: a probabilistic economic 
model was developed using registry and cohort study data. For most health and 
fitness strata, surgery plus adjuvant endocrine therapy had lower costs and 
returned more quality-adjusted life-years than endocrine therapy alone. However, 
for some women aged > 90 years, surgery plus adjuvant endocrine therapy was no 
longer cost-effective and generated fewer quality-adjusted life-years than 
endocrine therapy alone. The incremental benefit of surgery plus adjuvant 
endocrine therapy reduced with age and comorbidities. (5) Variation in practice: 
analysis of rates of surgery plus adjuvant endocrine therapy or endocrine 
therapy alone between the 56 breast units in the cohort study demonstrated 
significant variation in rates of endocrine therapy alone that persisted after 
adjustment for age, fitness and stage. Clinician preference was an important 
determinant of treatment choice.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, for older women with 
oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer, there is a cohort of women with a 
life expectancy of < 4 years for whom surgery plus adjuvant endocrine therapy 
may offer little benefit and simply have a negative impact on quality of life. 
The Age Gap decision tool may help make this shared decision. Similarly, 
although adjuvant chemotherapy offers little benefit and has a negative impact 
on quality of life for the majority of older women with 
oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer, for women with 
oestrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy is beneficial. 
The negative impacts of adjuvant chemotherapy on quality of life, although 
significant, are transient. This implies that, for the majority of fitter women 
aged ≥ 70 years, standard care should be offered.
LIMITATIONS: As with any observational study, despite detailed propensity score 
matching, residual bias cannot be excluded. Follow-up was at median 52 months 
for the cohort analysis. Longer-term follow-up will be required to validate 
these findings owing to the slow time course of oestrogen-receptor-positive 
breast cancer.
FUTURE WORK: The online algorithm is now available (URL: 
https://agegap.shef.ac.uk/; accessed May 2022). There are plans to validate the 
tool and incorprate quality-of-life and 10-year survival outcomes.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as ISRCTN46099296.
