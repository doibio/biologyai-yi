OBJECTIVES: Population-based epidemiologic data for paraneoplastic neurologic 
syndromes (PNSs) in the United States are lacking. Our objective was to evaluate 
the incidence, prevalence, and associated morbidity of PNS.
METHODS: We performed a population-based epidemiology study in Olmsted County, 
Minnesota, with patients identified between January 1, 1987, and December 31, 
2018, using the medical records linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology 
Project (REP) who met the definite/probable 2021 PNS criteria and 2004 PNS 
criteria. Patients with dermatomyositis and myasthenia gravis with underlying 
tumors were included. Age- and sex-specific population counts were obtained from 
REP resources for January 1, 2014 (prevalence denominator) and annually for 
1987-2018 (incidence denominator). Morbidity was estimated using 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; years lived with disability [YLD] plus 
years of life lost [YLL]).
RESULTS: There were 28 patients with PNS identified (50% female) residing in 
Olmsted County, Minnesota, with median age at diagnosis of 54.5 (IQR 46.5-69.0) 
years. All patients had a cancer diagnosis, and 18 (64%) patients were neural 
autoantibody positive including antineuronal nuclear autoantibody type 1 
(ANNA-1/anti-Hu; n = 1), ANNA-2/anti-Ri (n = 1), muscle-type acetylcholine 
receptor (AChR; n = 6), Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody type 1 
(PCA-1/anti-Yo; n = 1), kelch-like protein 11 (KLH11; n = 3), collapsin response 
mediator protein 5 (CRMP-5/anti-CV2; n = 2), 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (n = 1), 
neurofilament light chain (n = 1), leucine zipper 4 (LUZP4; n = 1), and 
unclassified neural antibodies (n = 1). PNS incidence was 0.6/100,000 
person-years and increased over time from 0.4/100,000 person-years (1987-2002) 
to 0.8/100,000 person-years (2003-2018) (p = 0.06). Prevalence was 5.4/100,000 
people. The median follow-up period after PNS diagnosis was 3.1 years (IQR, 
1.1-9.9 years). Total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 28 patients 
with PNS were 472.7 years, based on total years of life lost (YLL) for patients 
dying between 1987 and 2018 (n = 15) of 445.3 years plus years lived with 
disability (YLD) 27.4 years.
DISCUSSION: PNSs are rare neurologic disorders but are associated with severe 
morbidity and mortality. The estimated number of prevalent PNS cases in the 
United States is 17,099, and predicted DALY for all US PNS cases is 292,393 
years. Their apparent increasing rate of detection is attributable to increasing 
physician awareness and availability of serologic testing.

Comment in
    Nat Rev Cancer. 2022 Mar;22(3):129.

Cancer is a ubiquitous disease of metazoans, predicted to disproportionately 
affect larger, long-lived organisms owing to their greater number of cell 
divisions, and thus increased probability of somatic mutations1,2. While 
elevated cancer risk with larger body size and/or longevity has been documented 
within species3-5, Peto's paradox indicates the apparent lack of such an 
association among taxa6. Yet, unequivocal empirical evidence for Peto's paradox 
is lacking, stemming from the difficulty of estimating cancer risk in non-model 
species. Here we build and analyse a database on cancer-related mortality using 
data on adult zoo mammals (110,148 individuals, 191 species) and map 
age-controlled cancer mortality to the mammalian tree of life. We demonstrate 
the universality and high frequency of oncogenic phenomena in mammals and reveal 
substantial differences in cancer mortality across major mammalian orders. We 
show that the phylogenetic distribution of cancer mortality is associated with 
diet, with carnivorous mammals (especially mammal-consuming ones) facing the 
highest cancer-related mortality. Moreover, we provide unequivocal evidence for 
the body size and longevity components of Peto's paradox by showing that cancer 
mortality risk is largely independent of both body mass and adult life 
expectancy across species. These results highlight the key role of life-history 
evolution in shaping cancer resistance and provide major advancements in the 
quest for natural anticancer defences.

Warming temperatures are greatly impacting wild organisms across the globe. Some 
of the negative impacts of climate change can be mitigated behaviorally, for 
example, by changes in habitat and oviposition site choice. Temperatures are 
reportedly warming faster at night than during the day, yet studies assessing 
the impacts of increasing night temperature are rare. We used the Finnish 
Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) as study species and exposed 
adult butterflies of both sexes to warmer night conditions. Under a seminatural 
outdoor enclosure, we assessed whether females base their oviposition choices 
primarily on habitat site characteristics (open, suggestive of dry meadows, 
versus covered by a coarse canopy, suggestive of pastures) or on plant condition 
(dry vs. lush), and if their choice is altered by the thermal conditions 
experienced at night. As exposure to warmer environmental conditions is expected 
to increase resting metabolic rate and potentially reduce life expectancy, we 
further assessed the fitness implications of warm-night temperatures. We found 
that females prefer open sites for oviposition and that females do not switch 
their oviposition strategy based on the thermal conditions they experienced at 
night prior to the reproductive event. Exposure to warm nights did not influence 
female lifespan, but the egg hatching success of their offspring was reduced. In 
addition, we found that males exposed to warm nights sired larger clutches with 
higher hatching rate. As warm-night exposure reduced male lifespan, this may 
imply a switch in male resource allocation strategy toward increased offspring 
quality. The present work adds on to the complex implications of climate warming 
and highlights the importance of the often-neglected role of males in shaping 
offspring performance.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Current hemodialysis (HD) treatments have limited ability 
to clear larger-molecular-weight uremic toxins. Retention is associated with 
increased symptom burden, low health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and high 
mortality. Improved clearance, using novel medium cut-off dialyzers, termed 
expanded HD (HDx), may be associated with improved subjective experience. We 
have previously developed a dynamic patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) 
instrument to allow iterative recording to better appreciate the overall burden 
of disease and assess the impact of therapy changes.
STUDY DESIGN: Single-center interventional pilot study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 28 patients established on maintenance HD, London, 
Ontario, Canada.
INTERVENTION: Initial study consisting of 2-week observation 
(baseline-conventional high-flux HD) followed by 12 weeks of HDx. HRQoL was 
assessed using the dynamic PROM instrument thrice weekly (enabled in a dedicated 
app as the London Evaluation of Illness [LEVIL]). Extension phase; 2-week 
baseline with 24 weeks of HDx and 8-week washout.
OUTCOMES: Principal aim was to establish whether HDx therapy was associated with 
improved HRQoL, evidence of dose-dependant response, and whether effects were 
durable over time, using LEVIL.
RESULTS: Patients with lower LEVIL scores (<70/100) at baseline showed 
improvement in overall HRQoL after 8 weeks of therapy with similar carryover 
effect. General well-being, energy, and sleep quality were improved 
significantly as a consequence of HDx therapy. There were no detrimental effects 
of HDx detected in patients with higher baseline HRQoL.
LIMITATIONS: Small nonrandomized sample size. The coronavirus disease 2019 
pandemic interfered with the extension phase.
CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic PROM assessment effectively identified patients with lower 
HRQoL and higher symptom burden, demonstrating durable time/dose-dependent 
improvements across a range of symptom domains. The use of this instrument may 
allow targeted selection of patients most likely to benefit from HDx therapy and 
assist in monitoring response and defining effect size and treatment duration to 
allow optimal design of further definitive randomized controlled trials of this 
newly introduced technology.

OBJECTIVE: Children with thalassemia major (TM) are prone to growth failure and 
micronutrient deficiency. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate nutritional status, 
anthropometrics, and bone mineralization defects in patients with regular blood 
transfusion.
METHODS: Data obtained were analyzed by evaluating laboratory tests, 
anthropometric measures, and bone mineral density.
RESULTS: This study included 29 patients (62% male and 38% female) with a mean 
age of 12.26±4.74 years, mean pre-transfusion hemoglobin of 8.64±1.01 g/dL, and 
mean serum ferritin of 1158.6±556.8 ng/ mL. Vitamin D (72.4%), selenium (72.4%), 
and folate (37.9%) deficiencies were most frequent. Hypocalcemia was observed in 
17.2%, hypomagnesemia in 3.5%, and decreased ceruloplasmin in 10.3% of patients. 
Folate was higher between 2 and 6 years old (p=0.028). Ceruloplasmin was higher 
between 6 and 10 years old (p=0.018). Selenium was significantly higher in 
patients with a ferritin of ≥1,500 (p=0.008). No significant ferritin-related 
differences were found in other micronutrients (p>0.05). Body mass index (BMI) 
were <5 percentile (p) in 31% of patient, whereas none was >95 p. Height in 
24.5% and weight in 20.7% of patients were <3 p, whereas none with >97 p. BMI of 
patients aged 10-18 years was significantly higher (p=0.001). Anthropometric 
percentiles did not significantly differ in the mean serum ferritin and 
micronutrient levels. Hypoparathyroidism was observed in 13.8% and 
hypothyroidism in 3.5% of patients. Low bone density was detected in 14.8% (2 
osteopenic and 2 osteoporotic) of patients. Bone mineral density did not 
significantly differ in the ferritin and micronutrient levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional support and deficiency prevention are important to 
minimize the burden of complications and increase the life expectancy and 
quality in patients with TM.

Glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer, demonstrates the least life expectancy 
among all brain cancers. Because of the regulation of diverse signaling pathways 
in cancers, the chemotherapeutic approaches used to suppress their 
multiplication and spread are restricted. Sensitivity towards chemotherapeutic 
agents has been developed because of the pathological and drug-evading abilities 
of these diverse mechanisms. As a result, the identification and exploration of 
strategies or treatments, which can overcome such refractory obstacles to 
improve glioblastoma response to treatment as well as recovery, is essential. 
Medicinal herbs contain a wide variety of bioactive compounds, which could 
trigger aggressive brain cancers, regulate their anti-cancer mechanisms and 
immune responses to assist in cancer elimination, and cause cell death. Numerous 
tumor-causing proteins, which facilitate invasion as well as metastasis of 
cancer, tolerance of chemotherapies, and angiogenesis, are also inhibited by 
these phytochemicals. Such herbs remain valuable for glioblastoma prevention and 
its incidence by effectively being used as anti-glioma therapies. This review 
thus presents the latest findings on medicinal plants using which the extracts 
or bioactive components are being used against glioblastoma, their mechanism of 
functioning, pharmacological description, and recent clinical studies conducted 
on them.

Different melanoma subtypes exhibit specific and non-overlapping sets of 
oncogene and tumor suppressor mutations, despite a common cell of origin in 
melanocytes. For example, activation of the Gαq/11 signaling pathway is a 
characteristic initiating event in primary melanomas that arise in the dermis, 
uveal tract, or central nervous system. It is rare in melanomas arising in the 
epidermis. The mechanism for this specificity is unknown. Here, we present 
evidence that in the mouse, crosstalk with the epidermal microenvironment 
actively impairs the survival of melanocytes expressing the GNAQQ209L oncogene. 
We found that GNAQQ209L, in combination with signaling from the interfollicular 
epidermis (IFE), stimulates dendrite extension, leads to actin cytoskeleton 
disorganization, inhibits proliferation, and promotes apoptosis in melanocytes. 
The effect was reversible and paracrine. In contrast, the epidermal environment 
increased the survival of wildtype and BrafV600E expressing melanocytes. Hence, 
our studies reveal the flip side of Gαq/11 signaling, which was hitherto 
unsuspected. In the future, the identification of the epidermal signals that 
restrain the GNAQQ209L oncogene could suggest novel therapies for GNAQ and GNA11 
mutant melanomas.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of individuals with spina bifida has continued to 
improve over the past several decades. However, little is known about the 
longitudinal course of scoliosis in individuals with myelomeningocele (MMC), a 
spina bifida subtype, across their lifespan. Specifically, it is not known 
whether management during or after the transition years from adolescence to 
adulthood is associated with comorbidities in adulthood nor if these individuals 
benefit from scoliosis treatment later in life.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In this systematic review, we asked: (1) Is the risk of 
secondary impairments (such as bladder or bowel incontinence, decreased 
ambulation, and skin pressure injuries) higher among adolescents and adults with 
MMC and scoliosis than among those with MMC without scoliosis? (2) Is there 
evidence that surgical management of scoliosis is associated with improved 
functional outcomes in adolescents and adults with MMC? (3) Is surgical 
management of scoliosis associated with improved quality of life in adolescents 
and adults with MMC?
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of articles in Medline and Embase from 
2000 until February 5, 2021. Search terms such as "spinal dysraphism," "spina 
bifida," "meningomyelocele," and "scoliosis" were applied in diverse 
combinations. A total of 1429 publications were identified, and 13 were eligible 
for inclusion. We included original studies reporting on scoliosis among 
individuals older than 15 years with MMC. When available, we extracted the 
prevalence of MMC and scoliosis, studied population age, percentage of patients 
experiencing complications, functional outcomes, and overall physical function. 
We excluded non-English articles and those with fewer than 10 individuals with 
scoliosis and MMC. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-analyses, and registered the review before data collection (PROSPERO: 
CRD42021236357). We conducted a quality assessment using the Methodologic Index 
for Nonrandomized Studies (MINORS) tool. In 13 included studies, there were 556 
individuals with MMC and scoliosis. Most were retrospective case series, 
although a minority were retrospective/comparative studies. The mean MINORS 
score was 12.3 ± 1.65 (a MINORS score over 12 generally is considered good 
reporting quality, scores below 12 are considered at high risk of bias).
RESULTS: In general, studies found that individuals with MMC and scoliosis were 
more likely to have secondary impairments such as bladder/bowel incontinence, 
decreased ambulation, and pressure injuries than were patients with MMC without 
scoliosis. These secondary impairments were associated with hydrocephalus and 
high-level MMC lesions. However, when one study evaluated mortality, the results 
showed that although most deceased individuals who had spina bifida had 
scoliosis, no association was found between the age of death and scoliosis. 
Among the studies evaluating functional outcomes, none supported strong 
functional improvement in individuals with MMC after surgery for scoliosis. No 
correlation between the Cobb angle and sitting balance was noted; however, the 
degree of pelvic obliquity and the level of motor dysfunction showed a strong 
correlation with scoliosis severity. There was no change in sitting pressure 
distributions after spinal surgery. The lesion level and scoliosis degree 
independently contributed to the degree of lung function impairment. Although 
studies reported success in correcting coronal deformity and stopping curve 
progression, they found no clear benefit of surgery on health-related quality of 
life and long-term outcomes. These studies demonstrated that the level of 
neurologic function, severity of hydrocephalus, and brainstem dysfunction are 
greater determinants of quality of life than spinal deformity.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review found that adolescents and adults with MMC 
and scoliosis are more likely to have secondary impairments than their peers 
with MMC only. The best-available evidence does not support strong functional 
improvement or health-related quality of life enhancement after scoliosis 
surgery in adolescents and adults with MMC. The level of neurologic dysfunction, 
hydrocephalus, and brainstem dysfunction are greater determinants of quality of 
life. Future prospective studies should be designed to answer which individuals 
with MMC and scoliosis would benefit from spinal surgery. Our findings suggest 
that the very modest apparent benefits of surgery should cause surgeons to 
approach surgical recommendations in this patient population with great caution, 
and surgeons should counsel patients and their families that the risk of 
complications is high and the benefits may be small.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

Neoplasms of melanocytic origin are diseases relevant to dogs and cats' 
ophthalmic oncology due to their incidence, potential visual loss, and 
consequent decrease in life quality and expectancy. Despite its non-specific 
clinical presentation, melanocytic neoplasms can be histologically distinguished 
in melanocytomas, which present benign characteristics, and malignant melanomas. 
The diagnosis often occurs in advanced cases, limiting the therapeutic options. 
Surgery, cryotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and laser are 
currently available therapeutic strategies. As no clinical guidelines are 
available, the treatment choice is primarily based on the clinician's 
preference, proficiency, and the owner's financial constraints. While surgery is 
curative in benign lesions, ocular melanomas present a variable response to 
treatments, besides the potential of tumour recurrences or metastatic disease. 
This review presents the currently available therapies for ocular melanocytic 
neoplasms in dogs and cats, describing the therapeutic, indications, and 
limitations. Additionally, new therapeutics being developed are presented and 
discussed, as they can improve the current treatment options.

Powered wheelchairs have enhanced the mobility and quality of life of people 
with special needs. The next step in the development of powered wheelchairs is 
to incorporate sensors and electronic systems for new control applications and 
capabilities to improve their usability and the safety of their operation, such 
as obstacle avoidance or autonomous driving. However, autonomous powered 
wheelchairs require safe navigation in different environments and scenarios, 
making their development complex. In our research, we propose, instead, to 
develop contactless control for powered wheelchairs where the position of the 
caregiver is used as a control reference. Hence, we used a depth camera to 
recognize the caregiver and measure at the same time their relative distance 
from the powered wheelchair. In this paper, we compared two different approaches 
for real-time object recognition using a 3DHOG hand-crafted object descriptor 
based on a 3D extension of the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and a 
convolutional neural network based on YOLOv4-Tiny. To evaluate both approaches, 
we constructed Miun-Feet-a custom dataset of images of labeled caregiver's feet 
in different scenarios, with backgrounds, objects, and lighting conditions. The 
experimental results showed that the YOLOv4-Tiny approach outperformed 3DHOG in 
all the analyzed cases. In addition, the results showed that the recognition 
accuracy was not improved using the depth channel, enabling the use of a 
monocular RGB camera only instead of a depth camera and reducing the 
computational cost and heat dissipation limitations. Hence, the paper proposes 
an additional method to compute the caregiver's distance and angle from the 
Powered Wheelchair (PW) using only the RGB data. This work shows that it is 
feasible to use the location of the caregiver's feet as a control signal for the 
control of a powered wheelchair and that it is possible to use a monocular RGB 
camera to compute their relative positions.

IMPORTANCE: The association between incarceration and long-term mortality risk 
is unknown and may contribute to racial disparities in overall life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether incarceration in the US is associated with an 
increase in mortality risk and whether this association is different for Black 
compared with non-Black populations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This generational retrospective cohort study 
used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, a nationally 
representative cohort of noninstitutionalized youths aged 15 to 22 years, from 
January 1 to December 31, 1979, with follow-up through December 31, 2018. A 
total of 7974 non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic non-Black participants were 
included. Statistical analysis was performed from October 26, 2019, to August 
31, 2021.
EXPOSURES: Time-varying exposure of having experienced incarceration during 
follow-up.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was time to death. Cox proportional 
hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs, 
adjusted for baseline sociodemographic, economic, and behavioral risk factors. 
Models were evaluated for the full cohort and stratified by race.
RESULTS: Of the 7974 individuals included in our sample, 4023 (50.5%) were male, 
and 2992 (37.5%) identified as Black (median age, 18 [IQR, 17-20] years). During 
a median follow-up of 35 years (IQR, 33-37 years), 478 participants were 
incarcerated and 818 died. Unadjusted exposure to at least 1 incarceration 
between 22 and 50 years of age was 11.5% (95% CI, 10.4%-12.7%) for Black 
participants compared with 2.5% (95% CI, 2.1%-2.9%) for non-Black participants. 
In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model with the full cohort, 
time-varying exposure to incarceration was associated with an increased 
mortality rate (adjusted HR [aHR], 1.35; 95% CI, 0.97-1.88), a result that was 
not statistically significant. In the models stratified by race, incarceration 
was significantly associated with increased mortality among Black participants 
(aHR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.18-2.31) but not among non-Black participants (aHR, 1.17; 
95% CI, 0.68-2.03).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study with 4 decades of follow-up, 
incarceration was associated with a higher mortality rate among Black 
participants but not among non-Black participants. These findings suggest that 
incarceration, which was prevalent and unevenly distributed, may have 
contributed to the lower life expectancy of the non-Hispanic Black population in 
the US.

The elderly are the fastest-growing population on waiting lists for kidney 
transplantation (KTx). Recognized barriers to KTx in the elderly is early 
post-transplant mortality and morbidity. To analyze the outcomes of KTx in 
recipients older than 60 years and, simultaneously, in their younger paired 
recipients, receiving a graft from the same donor.We included 328 kidney 
transplant recipients in the study. The elderly kidney transplant recipients 
(EKT) group included 164 patients aged 65 standard deviation (SD4) years. They 
were paired with younger kidney transplant recipients (YKT) aged 45 (SD12) 
years.The studied groups (EKT vs YKT) did not differ from the graft function 
estimated 1 year after the transplantation (50.7 mL/min vs 54.0 mL/min), while 
the estimated glomerular filtration rate decline was significantly faster in the 
YKT group. One-year patient survival (93.9% vs 97.0%), 1-year graft survival 
(90.4% vs 82.3%), and incidences of delayed graft function and acute rejection 
did not differ between the EKT and YKT groups. Significantly more cardiovascular 
complications and post-transplant diabetes mellitus were noticed in the EKT 
group. The long-term patient and graft survivals were poorer in the EKT group 
versus the YKT group, but death-censored graft survivals were the same. After 
having excluded donor-derived graft factors, there were no differences in the 
first-year outcome of KTx between recipients younger and older than 60 years. As 
life expectancy is lower in the EKT group, the probability of patient and graft 
survival was also significantly lower in this group. However, death-censored 
graft survival was not different in the EKT and YKT groups.

Animal microbiomes are occasionally considered as an extension of host anatomy, 
physiology, and even their genomic architecture. Their compositions encompass 
variable and constant portions when examined across multiple hosts. The latter, 
termed the core microbiome, is viewed as more accommodated to its host 
environment and suggested to benefit host fitness. Nevertheless, discrepancies 
in its definitions, characteristics, and importance to its hosts exist across 
studies. We survey studies that characterize the core microbiome, detail its 
current definitions and available methods to identify it, and emphasize the 
crucial need to upgrade and standardize the methodologies among studies. We 
highlight ruminants as a case study and discussthe link between the core 
microbiome and host physiology and genetics, as well as potential factors that 
shape it. We conclude with main directives of action to better understand the 
host-core microbiome axis and acquire the necessary insights into its controlled 
modulation.

INTRODUCTION: Few economic evaluations have assessed the cost-effectiveness of 
screening type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in different healthcare settings. This 
study aims to evaluate the value for money of various T2DM screening strategies 
in Vietnam.
METHODS: A decision analytical model was constructed to compare costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of T2DM screening in different health care 
settings, including (1) screening at commune health station (CHS) and (2) 
screening at district health center (DHC), with no screening as the current 
practice. We further explored the costs and QALYs of different initial screening 
ages and different screening intervals. Cost and utility data were obtained by 
primary data collection in Vietnam. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 
calculated from societal and payer perspectives, while uncertainty analysis was 
performed to explore parameter uncertainties.
RESULTS: Annual T2DM screening at either CHS or DHC was cost-effective in 
Vietnam, from both societal and payer perspectives. Annual screening at CHS was 
found as the best screening strategy in terms of value for money. From a 
societal perspective, annual screening at CHS from initial age of 40 years was 
associated with 0.40 QALYs gained while saving US$ 186.21. Meanwhile, one-off 
screening was not cost-effective when screening for people younger than 35 years 
old at both CHS and DHC.
CONCLUSIONS: T2DM screening should be included in the Vietnamese health benefits 
package, and annual screening at either CHS or DHC is recommended.

BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a major public health 
issue worldwide, but there is a paucity of literature on their burden and trends 
globally. We aimed to assess the global disease burden and trends of STIs from 
1990 to 2019.
METHODS: In this observational trend study, we collected data on incident cases, 
age-standardised incidence rate, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and 
calculated age-standardised DALY rates, for five STIs (syphilis, chlamydia, 
gonorrhoea, trichomonas, and genital herpes) between 1990 and 2019, by sex, 
geographical region, and cause using data exclusively from the Global Burden of 
Disease study 2019. The estimated annual percentage changes in the 
age-standardised incidence rate and age-standardised DALY rate were calculated 
to quantify the changing trend.
FINDINGS: Globally, the age-standardised incidence rate of STIs showed a 
decreasing trend with an estimated annual percentage change of -0·04 (95% 
uncertainty interval [UI] -0·08 to 0·00) from 1990 to 2019, reaching 9535·71 per 
100 000 person-years (8169·73 to 11 054·76) in 2019. The age-standardised DALY 
rate showed a decreasing trend with an estimated annual percentage change of 
-0·92 (-1·01 to -0·84) and reached 22·74 per 100 000 person-years (14·37 to 
37·11) in 2019. The sub-Saharan African region had the highest age-standardised 
incidence rate (19 973·12 per 100 000 person-years, 17 382·69 to 23 001·57) and 
age-standardised DALY rate (389·32 per 100 000 person-years, 154·27 to 769·74). 
Adolescents had the highest incidence rate (18 377·82 per 100 000 person-years, 
14 040·38 to 23 443·31) and showed stable total STI trends, except for an upward 
trend of syphilis between 2010 (347·65 per 100 000 person-years, 203·58 to 
590·69) and 2019 (423·16 per 100 000 person-years, 235·70 to 659·01). Male 
individuals had a higher age-standardised incidence rate (10 471·63 per 100 000 
person-years, 8892·20 to 12 176·10) than female individuals (8602·40 per 100 000 
person-years, 7358·00 to 10001·18), whereas female individuals had a higher 
age-standardised DALY rate (33·31 per 100 000 person-years, 21·05 to 55·25) than 
male individuals (12·11 per 100 000 person-years, 7·63 to 18·93).
INTERPRETATION: Although most countries showed a decrease in age-standardised 
rates of incidence and DALYs for STIs, the absolute incident cases and DALYs 
increased from 1990 to 2019. Therefore, STIs still represent a global public 
health challenge, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, which 
warrants more attention and health prevention service.

OBJECTIVES: This study is aimed to summarize the declining trends of suicide 
rates by gender in China and in each of its provinces, and to explain the 
changes from a public health perspective.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a study with existing data.
METHODS: Data of suicide mortality were provided by China CDC (1990 to 2017). 
Data of suicide in each of the 33 provinces were aggregated every five years, 
except for the year of 2017. A statistical model was performed with the 
provincial region as the unit of analysis.
RESULTS: The overall suicide rate in China decreased from 20.9/100,000 in 1990 
to 7.2 in 2017, marking a decrease of suicide rate in China by 65%. The gender 
ratio has increase from 0.88 in 1990 to 1.56 in 2017. Suicide rates have been 
going down in each of the 33 provinces. The national suicide rates are 
negatively correlated with GDP per capita, population density, and life 
expectancy, but positively related to rural population density.
CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of suicide rates in China is explained by the 
reduction of psychological strains which is a consequence of the fast-growing 
economy in the country. Given its large population and rapid decrease of the 
suicide deaths, China contributed to the global reduction of suicide 
mortalities.

Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Leigh Syndrome Based on SURF1: Genotype and 
Phenotype.

SURF1 encodes the assembly factor for maintaining the antioxidant of cytochrome 
c oxidase (COX) stability in the human electron respiratory chain. Mutations in 
SURF1 can cause Leigh syndrome (LS), a subacute neurodegenerative 
encephalopathy, characterized by early onset (infancy), grave prognosis, and 
predominant symptoms presenting in the basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, 
cerebellum, and peripheral nerves. To date, more than sixty different SURF1 
mutations have been found to cause SURF1-associated LS; however, the 
relationship between genotype and phenotype is still unclear. Most 
SURF1-associated LS courses present as typical LS and cause early mortality 
(before the age of ten years). However, 10% of the cases present with atypical
