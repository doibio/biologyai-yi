β-carotene and lycopene content in fruit flesh, fruit shape index, skin 
thickness, flesh color, and rind color. By investigating the mapping intervals, 
we identified 33 candidate genes containing variants in the coding sequence. 
Among them, Cla97C01G008760 was annotated as a phytoene synthase with a 
single-nucleotide variant (A → G) in the first exon at 9,539,129 bp of 
chromosome 1 that resulted in the conversion of a lysine to glutamic acid, 
indicating that this gene might regulate flesh color changes at the protein 
level. These findings not only prove the importance of a phytoene synthase gene 
in pigmentation but also explain an important reason for the color change of 
watermelon flesh.

Adoption of improved agricultural technologies can help achieve the two 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of no poverty and zero hunger by 2030. This 
study investigates the determinants of farmers' adoption of hand tractors in the 
HKH region of Pakistan using binary logit model. We also examine what 
facilitates and what impedes the adoption of hand tractor adoption using key 
informant interviews. Results show that household head education, farming 
experience, knowledge of hand tractor use, access to credit, extension contact, 
and trust in technology positively affect the adoption of hand tractor; however 
farm size is negatively related. The findings reveal that ethnic conflicts, 
political conflicts, elite capture in decision making, unavailability of 
functional community-based entities, weak extension-farmers contact, as well as 
weak inter- and intra-community linkages are key barriers affecting hand tractor 
adoption. Similarly, observed changes on neighbors' fields, experiencing hand 
tractor on trial basis, communication networks, risk observations, and trust 
propensities motivate hand tractor adoption in the study region. Thus, to 
effectively disseminate improved agricultural technologies, policymakers should 
consider these factors.

Life expectancy inequities between more- and less-educated groups have grown by 
1 to 2 years over the last several decades in the United States. Simultaneously, 
employment conditions for many workers have deteriorated. Researchers 
hypothesize that these adverse conditions mediate educational inequities in 
mortality. However, methodological barriers have impeded research on the role of 
employment conditions and other hazards as mediating factors in health 
inequities. Indeed, traditional mediation analysis methods are often biased in 
occupational health settings, including in those with exposure-mediator 
interactions and mediator-outcome confounders that are caused by exposure. In 
this paper, we outline-and provide code for-a marginal structural modeling (MSM) 
approach for estimating total effects and controlled direct effects originally 
proposed elsewhere, which can be applied to common mediation analysis settings 
in occupational health research. As an example, we apply our approach to assess 
the extent to which disparities in employment quality (EQ)-a multidimensional 
construct characterizing the terms and conditions of the worker-employer 
relationship-explained educational inequities in mortality in a 1999-2015 US 
Panel Study of Income Dynamics sample of workers with mortality follow-up 
through 2017. Under certain strong assumptions described in the text, our 
estimates suggest that over 70% of the educational inequity in mortality would 
have been eliminated if EQ had been at the 80th percentile (100th  = best) 
across exposure groups.

The prevention, mitigation and treatment of depression has become a global issue 
that needs to be solved urgently. Sayram Ketteki, a traditional natural 
fermented yoghurt from the region with the world's fourth highest life 
expectancy, has been known as the "longevity secret", whose longevity and 
anti-depression factors are speculated to come from its rich microorganisms. 
Therefore, for the first time, we systematically studied in depth the microbes 
of Sayram Ketteki, screened a new edible probiotic strain, Lactiplantibacillus 
plantarum R6-3, and explored its anti-depression effect in chronic unpredictable 
mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression in mice. It is encouraging that L. 
plantarum R6-3 was significantly superior to the classic anti-depressant drug, 
fluoxetine, in the performance of promoting sucrose preference test (SPT) 
behavior by 18% (p < 0.001), lowering the serum CORT content by 5.6% (p < 0.05), 
accelerating the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level by 5.9% (p < 
0.01), increasing the serum IL-10 concentration by 2.3% (p < 0.05), 
up-regulating the expression of BDNF and phosphorylated-ERK by 74% (p < 0.01) 
and 45% (p < 0.001), respectively, and facilitating the secretion of fecal 
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including n-butyric, n-valeric, and isovaleric 
acid by 47% (p < 0.01), 42% (p < 0.05) and 38% (p < 0.05), respectively. Through 
the microbiota-gut-brain axis, L. plantarum R6-3 promoted the secretion of 
intestinal SCFAs through regulation of the composition and function of the gut 
microbiota, and activated the production of the monoamine neurotransmitter, 
renewed the level of brain neurotrophic factor, and suppressed the hyperactivity 
of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by adjusting the hippocampal 
BDNF/TrkB/ERK/CREB signaling pathway, thereby improving the immune and oxidative 
stress status, protecting hippocampal tissue from damage, maintaining a healthy 
weight and preventing CUMS-induced depressive behavior in mice. It has great 
prospects for the development of natural functional foods, the prevention and 
treatment of depression and in innovative microecological preparations.

BACKGROUND: Several early phase studies have demonstrated that 
psilocybin-assisted therapy has rapid-acting and persisting antidepressant 
effects from just one or two doses. However, methodological limitations (e.g., 
placebo-control, blinding) limit interpretability of the existing literature.
METHODS: In an exploratory placebo-controlled, within-subject, fixed-order 
study, individuals with moderate to severe major depressive disorder were 
administered placebo (n = 19) followed by psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) (n = 15) 4 
weeks later. Dosing sessions were embedded within an manualized course of 
psychotherapy. Enhanced blinding procedures were used. Depression, anxiety, and 
quality of life were measured over a 16-week study period.
RESULTS: Depression and anxiety significantly improved following both placebo 
and psilocybin with no significant difference in the degree of change between 
the two conditions. However, antidepressant effect sizes were larger after 
psilocybin (d' = 1.02-2.27) than after placebo (d' = 0.65-0.99) and there were 
high rates of response (66.7%) and remission (46.7%) following psilocybin 
administration. Antidepressant effects following psilocybin persisted, on 
average, for 2 months and there were persisting improvements in mood-related 
quality of life domains. The strength of mystical-type experience during 
psilocybin dosing was not correlated with subsequent antidepressant effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this exploratory study highlight the complex 
interplay between expectancy, therapy effects, and drug/placebo effects in 
psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy studies. Nonetheless, the acute and 
persisting clinical improvements observed following psilocybin support further 
study of its potential in the treatment of major depression. Future studies 
should more explicitly mitigate and measure expectancy effects and assess the 
impact of repeated dosing and different forms of psychotherapeutic support.

DNA logic gates have shown outstanding magic in intelligent biology 
applications, but it remains challenging to construct a portable, affordable and 
convenient DNA logic gate. Herein, logic gates of gas pressure were innovatively 
developed for multiplex analysis of metal ions. Hg2+ and Ag+ were input to 
interact specifically with the respective mismatched base pairs, which activated 
DNA extension reaction by polymerase and led to the enrichment of platinum 
nanoparticles for catalyzing the decomposition of peroxide hydrogen. Thus, the 
gas pressure obtained from a sealed well was used as output for detecting or 
identifying metal ions. Hg2+ and Ag+ were sensitively and selectively detected, 
and the assay of the real samples was also satisfactory. Based on this, DNA 
logic gates, including YES, NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, INHIBIT, and XOR were 
successfully established using a portable and hand-held gas pressure meter as 
detector. So, the interactions between DNA and metal ions were intelligently 
transferred into the output of gas pressure, which made metal ions to be 
detected portably and identified intelligently. Given the remarkable merits of 
simplicity, logic operation, and portable output, the metal ion-driven DNA logic 
gate of gas pressure provides a promising way for intelligent and portable 
biosensing.

BACKGROUND: Practicing healthy lifestyles can reduce the risk to develop 
noncommunicable diseases and the related mortality. Studies showed that 
practicing healthy lifestyles could enhance disease-free life expectancy and 
preserve bodily functions. However, engagement in healthy lifestyle behavior was 
suboptimal.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to define individuals' lifestyle characteristics 
before and during COVID-19 and determine the factors associated with practicing 
a healthy lifestyle. This cross-sectional study was conducted using data from 
the 2019 and 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys.
METHODS: US individuals aged ≥18 years were interviewed via phone call. Healthy 
lifestyles were assessed through corresponding questions regarding the 
maintenance of optimal body weight, physical activity, daily consumption of at 
least five portions of fruits and vegetables, current smoking status, and 
alcohol consumption. Missing data were imputed using a package in the R 
statistical software. The effects of practicing a healthy lifestyle on cases 
without missing data and those with imputation were reported.
RESULTS: There were 550,607 respondents (272,543 and 278,064 from 2019 and 2021, 
respectively) included in this analysis. The rates of practicing a healthy 
lifestyle were 4% (10,955/272,543) and 3.6% (10,139/278,064) in 2019 and 2021, 
respectively. Although 36.6% (160,629/438,693) of all 2021 respondents had 
missing data, the results of the logistic regression analysis for cases without 
missing data and those with imputation were similar. Of the cases with 
imputation, women (odds ratio [OR] 1.87) residing in urban areas (OR 1.24) with 
high education levels (OR 1.73) and good or better health status (OR 1.59) were 
more likely to practice healthier lifestyles than young individuals (OR 
0.51-0.67) with a low household income (OR 0.74-0.78) and chronic health 
conditions (OR 0.48-0.74).
CONCLUSIONS: A healthy lifestyle should be strongly promoted at the community 
level. In particular, factors associated with a low rate of practice of healthy 
lifestyles should be targeted.

The imbalance between energy intake and expenditure in an environment of 
continuous food availability can lead to metabolic disturbances in the body and 
increase the risk of obesity and a range of chronic noncommunicable diseases. 
Intermittent fasting (IF) is one of the most popular nonpharmacological 
interventions to combat obesity and chronic noncommunicable diseases. The 3 most 
widely studied IF regimens are alternate-day fasting, time-restricted feeding, 
and the 5:2 diet. In rodents, IF helps optimize energy metabolism, prevent 
obesity, promote brain health, improve immune and reproductive function, and 
delay aging. In humans, IF's benefits are relevant for the aging global 
population and for increasing human life expectancy. However, the optimal model 
of IF remains unclear. In this review, the possible mechanisms of IF are 
summarized and its possible drawbacks are discussed on the basis of the results 
of existing research, which provide a new idea for nonpharmaceutical dietary 
intervention of chronic noncommunicable diseases.

A broad spectrum of long-term sequelae may be present in venous thromboembolism 
(VTE) survivors, affecting their quality of life and functioning. To monitor 
recovery and improve the prognosis of patients with persistent functional 
limitations, the development of a new outcome measure that could better capture 
the consequences of VTE was an unmet need. Starting as a call to action, the 
Post-VTE Functional Status (PVFS) scale was developed to meet this need. The 
PVFS scale is an easy-to-use clinical tool to measure and quantify functional 
outcomes after VTE by focusing on key aspects of daily life. As the scale was 
considered useful in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients as well, the 
Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) scale was introduced early in the 
pandemic after slight adaptation. The scale has been well incorporated into both 
the VTE and COVID-19 research communities, contributing to the shift of focus 
toward patient-relevant functional outcomes. Psychometric properties have been 
evaluated, mainly for the PCFS scale but recently also for the PVFS scale, 
including validation studies of translations, showing adequate validity and 
reliability. In addition to serving as outcome measure in studies, guidelines 
and position papers recommend using the PVFS and PCFS scale in clinical 
practice. As broad use of the PVFS and PCFS scale in clinical practice is 
valuable to capture what matters most to patients, widespread implementation is 
a crucial next step. In this review, we discuss the development of the PVFS 
scale and introduction in VTE and COVID-19 care, the incorporation of the scale 
in research, and its application in clinical practice.

Veterinary Medicine, Nippon Veterinary and Life Science University, Tokyo, 
Japan.

OBJECTIVE:  The aim of this study was to determine the factors related to 
functional patella alta, with which the proximodistal patellar position exceeds 
the reference range of healthy small dogs proximally when the stifle is at full 
extension.
STUDY DESIGN:  Mediolateral-view radiographs of dogs weighing less than 15 kg 
were obtained and classified into the medial patellar luxation (MPL) and control 
groups. The reference range of the proximodistal patellar position was 
determined from the control group. In both groups, a patellar position exceeding 
this reference range proximally was considered functional patella alta. Multiple 
logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the factors related to 
functional patella alta. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 
made for each factor.
RESULTS:  Overall, radiographs of 127 stifles of 75 dogs were obtained. Eleven 
stifles in the MPL group and one stifle in the control group were determined to 
be functional patella alta. The factors associated with functional patella alta 
included a greater full extension angle of the stifle joint, longer patellar 
ligament, and shorter femoral trochlear length. The full extension angle of the 
stifle joint had the biggest area under the ROC curve.
CONCLUSION:  Mediolateral radiographs of the stifle joint in full extension are 
clinically important in dogs with MPL because some dogs might have a proximally 
positioned patella that is recognizable only when the stifles are extended.

BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy, the prevalence of nonagenarians 
with cardiovascular disease is steadily growing. However, this population is 
underrepresented in randomized trials and thus poorly defined, with little 
quality evidence to support and guide optimal management. The aim of the present 
study was to evaluate the clinical management, therapeutic approach, and 
outcomes of nonagenarians admitted to a tertiary care center intensive coronary 
care unit (ICCU).
METHODS: We prospectively collected all patients admitted to a tertiary care 
center ICCU between July 2019 - July 2022 and compared nonagenarians to all 
other patients. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 3807 patients were included in the study. Of them 178 (4.7%) 
were nonagenarians and 93 (52%) females. Each year the prevalence of 
nonagenarians has increased from 4.0% to 2019, to 4.2% in 2020, 4.6% in 2021 and 
5.3% in 2022. Admission causes differed between groups, including a lower rate 
of acute coronary syndromes (27% vs. 48.6%, p < 0.001) and a higher rate of 
septic shock (4.5% vs. 1.2%, p < 0.001) in nonagenarians. Nonagenarians had more 
comorbidities, such as hypertension, renal failure, and atrial fibrillation (82% 
vs. 59.6%, 23% vs. 12.9%, 30.3% vs. 14.4% p < 0.001, respectively). Coronary 
intervention was the main treatment approach, although an invasive strategy was 
less frequent in nonagenarians in comparison to younger subjects. In-hospital 
mortality rate was 2-fold higher in the nonagenarians (5.6% vs. 2.5%, 
p = 0.025).
CONCLUSION: With increasing life expectancy, the prevalence of nonagenarians in 
ICCU's is expected to increase. Although nonagenarian patients had more 
comorbidities and higher in-hospital mortality, they generally have good 
outcomes after admission to the ICCU. Hence, further studies to create 
evidence-based practices and to support and guide optimal management in these 
patients are warranted.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common genetic disease in the Caucasion 
population. Thanks to the CFTR modulators therapy, life expectancy will 
significantly improve. New therapeutic challenges can be expected, including 
diseases associated with ageing and higher incidence of cancer, as evidenced by 
recent epidemiological studies. The increasing incidence of tumors includes also 
breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer is higher in CF patients compared to 
the general population. Sex hormones, especially estrogens, also affect on the 
pathophysiology and immunology of the CF. Previous research, has demonstrated 
unequivocal survival rates for female CF patients compared to their male 
counterparts. Is demonstrated, that chemotherapy used for breast cancer affects 
the CFTR channel and CFTR modulator therapy has frequent side effects on breast 
tissue. In this review, we focus on the effects of female sex hormones on CF 
disease, pathophysiological relationships between CF and breast cancer, and the 
impact of antitumor treatment on both, malignant disease and CF. The potential 
for further investigation is also discussed.

Vanillic Acid Improves Stress Resistance and Substantially Extends Life Span in 
Caenorhabditis elegans.

Aging is the root cause of several pathologies like neurological and 
cardiovascular diseases. Identifying compounds that improve health span and 
extend life span, called geroprotectors, could be crucial to preventing or at 
least delaying the onset of age-related diseases. In this regard, the nematode 
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is emerging as an easy, efficient, low-cost 
model system to screen natural products and identify novel geroprotectors. 
Phenolic acids can be found in a wide range of natural products that are part of 
the human diet. Vanillic acid (VA) is a phenolic acid that has previously been 
attributed with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective features. To 
determine whether these beneficial health effects amount to an extension of 
health span and life span, in this work, we thoroughly explore the effect of VA 
on C. elegans stress resistance and life span. We found that VA increases 
thermotolerance (19.4%), reduces protein aggregation (between 30% and 40%), 
improves motility, and extends life span by almost 50%, an extent hardly ever 
achieved with a natural compound. The increased thermotolerance induced by VA is 
independent of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway but 
requires heat shock factor-1 and is associated with increased heat shock 
protein-4 (HSP-4) and hsp-16.2 expression. These results provide new insight 
into understanding the therapeutical properties of VA and warrant further 
investigation of VA as a novel geroprotector.

The burden of disease due to COVID-19 in Sweden 2020-2021: A disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) study.

BACKGROUND: The burden of COVID-19 disease can be measured in terms of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which is composed of two components: the 
years of life lost through premature death (YLL) and the number of years lived 
with disability (YLD), adjusted for level of disability. This study measured 
DALYs due to COVID-19 in Sweden and compared it to the burden of other diseases.
METHODS: The methodology used in the calculation of DALYs was based on the 
Global Burden of Disease guidelines. The number of patients diagnosed with 
mild/moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 and/or post-COVID-19 condition 
between March 2020 and October 2021 was extracted from national registries and 
used for YLD calculations. In addition, the numbers of death due to COVID-19 in 
different age groups were used for the YLL calculation.
RESULTS: During the study period, 152,877 DALYs were lost to COVID-19 in Sweden, 
99.3% of which was attributed to YLL. Loss of DALYs occurred mainly among the 
elderly, with 66.8% of DALYs attributed to individuals >70 years old. Compared 
to other diseases, the burden of COVID-19 in 2020 ranked as the eighth leading 
cause of DALY lost.
CONCLUSIONS: Similar to other countries, the burden of COVID-19 in Sweden was 
concentrated mainly among the elderly, who contributed most of the DALY lost due 
to premature mortality. Yet, DALY loss remained lower for COVID-19 than for 
several other diseases. The contribution of YLD to DALYs lost was minimal. 
However empirical data on the occurrence and disability of post-COVID-19 
condition are scarce, and YLD may therefore be underestimated.

BACKGROUND: Pinch-off syndrome is a rare late complication characterized by the 
occurrence of spontaneous fracture and embolization of a port-a-cath implanted 
via subclavian venous access. It may lead to serious cardiovascular outcomes.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a successful percutaneous transvenous removal of 
intravascular fractured port catheter embolized into the right ventricle by 
using the 'lasso' technique in an 85-year-old man with type B non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy and long estimated life expectancy.
DISCUSSION: Knowledge of pinch-off syndrome among physicians is essential for 
early intervention, thereby preventing adverse events. Percutaneous approach 
seems an effective, safe, and simple procedure.

Giant Sac Growth: A Hybrid Approach to Treat a Misdiagnosed Late Type IIIb 
Endoleak.

INTRODUCTION: Endoleaks are a common complication following endovascular 
aneurysm repair, yet type IIIb are rare, especially with newer devices, and 
associated with high morbidity due to repressurisation of the sac. As endografts 
are used in patients with longer life expectancy, late type IIIb endoleaks are 
to be expected. This is a report of a giant common iliac aneurysm resulting from 
a misdiagnosed type IIIb endoleak.
REPORT: An 85 year old man with history of right common iliac artery aneurysm, 
treated in 2003 with an EXCLUDER AAA Endoprosthesis (WL Gore, Flagstaff, AZ, 
USA) with iliac limb extension into the external iliac artery, presented at the 
emergency department with abdominal pain, hypotension, and syncope. He had a 
known endoleak, unsuccessfully treated by relining the right iliac stent graft 
overlap zones for a suspected type IIIa endoleak (2009), coil embolisation, and 
computed tomography (CT) guided thrombin injection of the aneurysmatic sac for a 
type II (2010), none of which managed to treat the cause with continuous 
aneurysm growth. The patient refused further treatments, but agreed to maintain 
surveillance. At admission, CT angiography showed common iliac aneurysm (185 × 
134 mm) sac rupture without a visible endoleak. Resuscitative endovascular 
balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) technique was performed to obtain 
haemodynamic control, then the aneurysm was approached through a midline 
incision. A type IIIb endoleak was identified due to a fabric tear on the right 
iliac limb extension. Suture was attempted without success, then relining of the 
lesion with an Endurant II Limb (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was performed, 
which managed to repair the endoleak.
DISCUSSION: Type IIIb endoleaks are uncommon and underdiagnosed due to fabric 
defects being too small or leaking intermittently. They can mimic other types of 
endoleaks and may cause aneurysm growth and rupture. One should consider this 
type of endoleak if previous treatments for other types were unsuccessful.

OBJECTIVES: Trauma-focussed psychological interventions are the treatments of 
choice for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As many clinical services 
receive high demand for PTSD interventions, strategies to improve treatment 
efficiency are needed. Some people seek help in the early phase post-trauma, 
including as soon as the first few months. It is unclear whether all components 
of trauma-focussed CBT are needed in this initial stage. Providing brief 
intervention in this early phase without work on trauma memories may be feasible 
and effective. This service evaluation study describes a case series of five 
participants experiencing PTSD following recent traumas.
METHODS: Participants completed a shortened 6-week form of Internet-delivered 
Cognitive Therapy for PTSD (iCT-PTSD), which used fewer treatment modules and 
focussed primarily on psychoeducation about PTSD, and two key treatment 
components, 'reclaiming your life' and trigger discrimination. Unlike the full 
course of iCT-PTSD, this format did not include working directly with trauma 
memories.
RESULTS: The intervention was associated with large reductions in symptoms of 
PTSD, depression and anxiety at the 6-week timepoint, which were maintained at 
3-month follow-up. Scores on the composite PTSD measure showed an average 
reduction of 91% between baseline and end of follow-up. One client required an 
extension to the weekly phase of treatment and received further treatment 
modules. All were discharged after follow-up and did not require further 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide preliminary evidence that this briefer format 
of iCT-PTSD was of benefit for those seeking support following recent traumas. 
Further examination in a larger controlled study is required.

[Viral diseases of the nervous system-Selected new and old viruses].

Viral diseases of the nervous system are ancient and poliomyelitis was described 
in Egypt as early as 2000 BC. They can cause a wide range of neurological 
symptoms, such as meningitis, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, 
Guillain-Barré-like syndrome and stroke, often leaving mild to severe residuals. 
Depending on the pathogen, the symptoms appear quickly within hours, or lead to 
increasing chronic symptoms within 1 week or months. The severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was newly identified in 
January 2020 and occurs worldwide, illustrates the sequelae of a phenomenon that 
has been known for centuries, the possible rapid spread of pathogen-related 
infectious diseases. Due to vaccination programs some pathogens are becoming 
rarer or are considered to be eradicated. Nevertheless, vaccination programs, 
especially in the poorer regions, are repeatedly interrupted, for example by 
wars. The most recent example is the interruption of vaccination against 
poliomyelitis in Ukraine. As life expectancy continues to rise and years of life 
lost to infectious diseases decrease, the new infectious disease threat is 
likely to come from emerging and re-emerging infections; however, according to 
a recent analysis of population data from 29 countries, life expectancy during 
the corona pandemic has decreased, e.g., by 28 months in the USA and by 6 months 
in Germany. Climate change, rapid urbanization and changing land-use patterns 
could increase the risk in the coming decades. In particular, the climate change 
can alter the spectrum of global pathogens and especially vector-borne 
infections can spread to new areas. A sustained increase in travel, trade and 
mobility enables the pathogens to spread quickly.

Publisher: Virale Erkrankungen des Nervensystems sind uralt, bereits 
2000 v. Chr. wurde die Poliomyelitis in Ägypten beschrieben. Sie können ein 
breites Spektrum an neurologischen Symptomen wie Meningitis, Enzephalitis, 
Meningoenzephalitis, Guillain-Barré-ähnliche Syndrome sowie Schlaganfälle 
verursachen, oft bleiben leichte bis schwere Residuen zurück. Je nach Erreger 
treten die Beschwerden rasch, innerhalb von Stunden ein oder führen innerhalb 
einer Woche oder von Monaten zu einer zunehmenden chronischen Symptomatik. Das 
in 01/2020 neu identifizierte, weltweit vorkommende Virus SARS-CoV‑2 („severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2“) verdeutlicht die Folgen eines 
seit Jahrhunderten bekannten Phänomens, die mögliche rasche Ausbreitung 
erregerbedingter Infektionserkrankungen. Aufgrund von Impfprogrammen werden 
einige Erreger immer seltener oder gelten als ausgerottet. Dennoch werden 
Impfprogramme, gerade in den ärmeren Regionen immer wieder bspw. durch Kriege 
unterbrochen, jüngstes Beispiel ist die Unterbrechung der Schutzimpfung gegen 
Poliomyelitis in der Ukraine. Während die Lebenserwartung weiter steigt und die 
durch Infektionskrankheiten verlorenen Lebensjahre abnehmen, wird die neue 
Bedrohung durch Infektionskrankheiten wahrscheinlich von neu auftretenden und 
wieder auftretenden Infektionen ausgehen. Jedoch ist die Lebenserwartung während 
der Corona-Pandemie laut einer aktuellen Analyse der Bevölkerungsdaten aus 
29 Ländern zurückgegangen, bspw. um 28 Monate in den USA und um 6 Monate in 
Deutschland. Klimawandel, rasche Urbanisierung und veränderte Landnutzungsmuster 
könnten das Risiko in den kommenden Jahrzehnten erhöhen. Besonders der 
Klimawandel kann das Spektrum globaler Krankheitserreger verändern, insbesondere 
vektorübertragene Infektionen können sich in neuen Gebieten ausdehnen. Ein 
anhaltender Anstieg bei Reisen, Handel und Mobilität ermöglicht den Erregern 
eine schnelle Ausbreitung.

Latest clinical trials have indicated favorable outcomes following transcatheter 
aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in low surgical risk patients with severe aortic 
stenosis. However, there are unanswered questions particularly in younger 
patients with longer life expectancy. While current evidence are limited to 
short duration of clinical follow-up, there are certain factors which may impair 
patients clinical outcomes and quality-of-life at long-term. Contemporary issues 
in the current TAVR era include prosthesis-patient mismatch, heart failure 
hospitalization, subclinical thrombosis, future coronary access, and valve 
durability. In this review, the authors review available evidence and discuss 
each remaining issues and theoretical treatment strategies in lifetime 
management of TAVR patients.

Trials show that low-dose computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening in 
long-term (ex-)smokers reduces lung cancer mortality. However, many individuals 
were exposed to unnecessary diagnostic procedures. This project aims to improve 
the efficiency of lung cancer screening by identifying high-risk participants, 
and improving risk discrimination for nodules. This study is an extension of the 
Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening Trial, with a focus on 
personalized outcome prediction (NELSON-POP). New data will be added on 
genetics, air pollution, malignancy risk for lung nodules, and CT biomarkers 
beyond lung nodules (emphysema, coronary calcification, bone density, vertebral 
height and body composition). The roles of polygenic risk scores and air 
pollution in screen-detected lung cancer diagnosis and survival will be 
established. The association between the AI-based nodule malignancy score and 
lung cancer will be evaluated at baseline and incident screening rounds. The 
association of chest CT imaging biomarkers with outcomes will be established. 
Based on these results, multisource prediction models for pre-screening and 
post-baseline-screening participant selection and nodule management will be 
developed. The new models will be externally validated. We hypothesize that we 
can identify 15-20% participants with low-risk of lung cancer or short life 
expectancy and thus prevent ~140,000 Dutch individuals from being screened 
unnecessarily. We hypothesize that our models will improve the specificity of 
nodule management by 10% without loss of sensitivity as compared to assessment 
of nodule size/growth alone, and reduce unnecessary work-up by 40-50%.

Obesity is an increasing global challenge for healthcare providers. According to 
the World Health Organization (WHO), the worldwide prevalence of obesity has 
nearly tripled since 1975, with more than 1.9 billion adults overweight and 650 
million with obesity in 2016. Obesity is associated with a lower life 
expectancy. It is a risk factor for several chronic diseases, such as 
hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes, as well as a range of mental 
disorders. Many individuals with obesity experience discrimination and 
stigmatization. Global healthcare costs for patients with obesity are 
approximately 30% higher than for individuals without obesity.  The literature
