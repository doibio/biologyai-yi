partly explained by gender differences in diseases and also by their greater 
strength, size, and stamina. Gender differences in risk factors for disease have 
changed over time with the prevalence and treatment of risk as well as 
differential behavior by gender. Examination of what are seen as basic molecular 
and cellular measures related to aging indicates men age faster than women; 
however, even these basic biological measures result from a combination of 
biology, behavior, and social factors.

OBJECTIVE: To assess public support of tailored and targeted public health 
interventions for marginalized communities.
METHODS: We conducted a discrete choice experiment using a web-based survey 
advertised to Facebook and Instagram users living in Canada, aged > 16. 
Participants were asked to choose between funding two hypothetical public health 
programs. Each program was described by its purpose; expected increase in life 
expectancy; and target audience. Demographically weighted generalized linear 
mixed-effects models were constructed to identify program factors associated 
with program selection.
RESULTS: Participants completed up to 8 discrete choice comparison exercises 
each resulting in 23,889 exercises were completed by 3054 participants. Selected 
programs were less likely to focus on prevention (vs. treatment). For each 
1-year increase in the marginal years of life gained, there was a 15% increase 
in the odds of a program being selected. Interventions tailored to marginalized 
communities or targeting stigmatized health conditions were less likely to be 
selected compared to interventions targeted to the general population or 
targeting chronic health conditions. Noteworthy exceptions included an increased 
preference for interventions aligning with the perceived needs or cultural 
expectations for marginalized communities.
CONCLUSIONS: Stigmatizing perceptions of health conditions and key populations 
likely influence public health programming preferences of Canadians.
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: Informational campaigns highlighting disparities 
experienced by marginalized populations may improve support for targeted and 
tailored interventions.

BACKGROUND: Werner syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive premature ageing 
disease that causes accelerated ageing-like symptoms after puberty. Previous 
studies conducted in the late 2000s reported that malignant neoplasms and 
atherosclerotic diseases were the two leading causes of death, with life 
expectancies in the mid-50 s. However, the recent lifespan and cause of death in 
patients with WS remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To clarify the latest lifespan and causes of death in patients with 
WS.
METHOD: We conducted a questionnaire-based survey in 2020 among the primary 
doctors of WS patients who were identified in previous nationwide surveys in 
Japan and clarified the following: the age of WS patients (age of death, if the 
patient had already died), sex, and cause of death. Patients who died in 2010 or 
earlier were excluded from the analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 123 living patients were identified at the time of the 
survey in 2020. Fourteen WS patients died between 2011 and 2020, with a mean age 
of 59.0 ± 8.9 years (mean ± SD). The most common cause of death was 
non-epithelial tumours, accounting for eight deaths, while no patient died of 
atherosclerotic diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to previous studies, this study suggests that the lifespan 
of patients with WS has been extended. Although there were no deaths due to 
atherosclerotic diseases, non-epithelial tumours were still the leading cause of 
death. Further development of screening and treatment methods for these tumours 
is required.

BACKGROUND: The populations of many countries-including Malaysia-are rapidly 
growing older, causing a shift in leading causes of disease and death. In such 
rapidly ageing populations, it is critical to monitor trends in burden of 
disease and health of older adults by identifying the leading causes of 
premature mortality and measuring years of life lost (YLL) to these. The 
objective of this study, therefore, is to describe the burden (quantified by 
YLL) associated with major causes of premature mortality among older adults in 
Malaysia in 2019.
METHODS: All deaths that occurred in older adults aged 60 and above in Malaysia 
in the year 2019 were included in this study. YLL was calculated by summing the 
number of deaths for the disease category at 5-year age intervals, multiplied by 
the remaining life expectancy for the specific age and sex group. Both life 
expectancy and mortality data were obtained from the Department of Statistics 
Malaysia.
RESULTS: In 2019, older adults accounted for 67.4% of total deaths in Malaysia 
(117,102 out of 173,746). The total number of YLL among older adults in Malaysia 
in 2019 was estimated at 1.36 million YLL, accounting for 39.6% of the total YLL 
(3.44 million) lost to all premature deaths in that year. The major causes of 
premature mortality among older adults were ischaemic heart disease (29.5%) 
followed by cerebrovascular disease (stroke) (20.8%), lower respiratory 
infections (15.9%), diabetes mellitus (8.1%) and trachea, bronchus and lung 
cancers (5.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Non-communicable diseases (NCD) remained the largest contributor to 
premature mortality among older adults in Malaysia. Implementation of 
population-level NCD health promotion programmes, screening programmes among 
high-risk groups and holistic intervention programmes among populations living 
with NCD are critical in reducing the overall burden of premature mortality.

BACKGROUND: Although the effectiveness of screening tools for detecting 
depression in pregnancy has been investigated, there is limited evidence on the 
cost-effectiveness. This is vital in providing full information to decision 
makers. This study aimed to explore the cost-effectiveness of different 
screening tools to identify depression in early pregnancy compared to no 
screening.
METHODS: A decision tree was developed to model the identification and treatment 
pathways of depression from the first antenatal appointment to 3-months 
postpartum using the Whooley questions, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale 
(EPDS) and the Whooley questions followed by the EPDS, compared to no screening. 
The economic evaluation took an NHS and Personal Social Services perspective. 
Model parameters were taken from a combination of sources including a 
cross-sectional survey investigating the diagnostic accuracy of screening tools, 
and other published literature. Cost-effectiveness was assessed in terms of the 
incremental cost per quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost-effectiveness 
planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were produced using a 
net-benefit approach based on Monte Carlo simulations of cost-outcome data.
RESULTS: In a 4-way comparison, the Whooley, EPDS and Whooley followed by the 
EPDS each had a similar probability of being cost-effective at around 30% for 
willingness to pay values from £20,000-30,000 per QALY compared to around 20% 
for the no screen option.
CONCLUSIONS: All three screening approaches tested had a higher probability of 
being cost-effective than the no-screen option. In the absence of a clear 
cost-effectiveness advantage for any one of the three screening options, the 
choice between the screening approaches could be made on other grounds, such as 
clinical burden of the screening options. Limitations include data availability 
and short time horizon, thus further research is needed.

BACKGROUND: Non-specific neck pain is the most prevailing musculoskeletal 
disorder which has a large socioeconomic burden worldwide. It is associated with 
poor posture and neck strain which may lead to pain and restricted mobility. 
Physical therapists treat such patients through several means. Post isometric 
relaxation and Myofascial release therapy are used in clinical practice with 
little evidence to be firmed appropriately. So, this study was conducted to 
explore the effect of Post-isometric relaxation in comparison to Myofascial 
release therapy for patients having non-specific neck pain.
METHODOLOGY: Sixty patients were randomly allocated to Post isometric group and 
the Myofascial group. The treatment period was of 2 weeks. All the patients were 
evaluated using the Visual analogue scale (VAS), Neck disability index (NDI), 
Universal Goniometer, and WHO BREF Quality of life-100 in the 1st and 6th 
sessions. Recorded data was entered on SPSS 21. Data were examined using two-way 
repeated ANOVA to measure the variance of analysis (group x time).
RESULTS: Analysis of the baseline characteristics revealed that both groups were 
homogenous in terms of age and gender i.e. a total of 60 participants were 
included in this research study 30 in each group. Out of 60 patients, there were 
20(33.3%) males and 40(66.7%) females with a mean age of 32.4(5.0) years. 
Participants in the Post Isometric group demonstrated significant improvements 
(p < 0.025) in VAS, NDI, Cervical Extension, left side rotation ranges, and QoL 
(Social Domain) at the 2-week follow-up compared with those in the Myofascial 
group. In addition, the Myofascial group indicated significantly better 
improvement in the mean score of CROM (flexion and right and left side bending).
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated patients with nonspecific neck pain can 
benefit from the post isometric relaxation with significant improvement in pain, 
disability, cervical ROM, and Quality of life compared with myofascial release 
therapy.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex and multisystem neurobehavioral 
disease, which is caused by the lack of expression of paternally inherited 
imprinted genes on chromosome15q11.2-q13.1. The clinical manifestations of PWS 
vary with age. It is characterized by severe hypotonia with poor suck and 
feeding difficulties in the early infancy, followed by overeating in late 
infancy or early childhood and progressive development of morbid obesity unless 
the diet is externally controlled. Compared to Western PWS patients, Chinese 
patients have a higher ratio of deletion type. Although some rare disease 
networks, including PWS Cooperation Group of Rare Diseases Branch of Chinese 
Pediatric Society, Zhejiang Expert Group for PWS, were established recently, 
misdiagnosis, missed diagnosis and inappropriate intervention were usually noted 
in China. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an integrated multidisciplinary 
approach to facilitate early diagnosis and optimize management to improve 
quality of life, prevent complications, and prolong life expectancy. Our purpose 
is to evaluate the current literature and evidences on diagnosis and management 
of PWS in order to provide evidence-based guidelines for this disease, specially 
from China.

BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is associated with disproportionate short stature and 
significant and potentially severe medical complications. Vosoritide is the 
first medicine to treat the underlying cause of achondroplasia and data from 
phase 3 and phase 2 extension studies showed effects on growth and body 
proportions. However, there are currently no long-term data available on the 
direct impact on endpoints such as medical complications and health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL). This study explored the perceived impact of 
achondroplasia on medical complications, HRQoL, healthcare resource use and 
mortality, and potential modifying effects of vosoritide, based on published 
evidence and expert opinion. Structured expert opinion was obtained by an 
international modified Delphi study among 14 experts in managing achondroplasia 
performed on a virtual platform and consisting of an explorative phase followed 
by an anonymous individual rating round.
RESULTS: Overall, the panelists expect that in individuals starting long-term 
treatment between 2 years of age and puberty, growth velocity increases observed 
in the clinical trials will be maintained until final height is reached (92% 
agreement) and will likely result in clinically meaningful improvements in 
upper-to-lower body segment ratio (85%). Earlier treatment initiation will 
likely result in a greater final height (100%) and more likely improve 
proportionality (92%) than later treatment. Although current data are 
limited, ≥ 75% of panelists find it conceivable that the earlier long-term 
treatment is started, the greater the probability of a positive effect on the 
lifetime incidence of symptomatic spinal stenosis, kyphosis, obstructive sleep 
apnea, and foramen magnum stenosis. These are among the most clinically 
important complications of achondroplasia because of their high impact on 
comorbidity, mortality, and/or HRQoL. A positive effect of vosoritide on the 
incidence of surgeries through lifetime was considered more likely with earlier 
long-term treatment (90%).
CONCLUSIONS: This explorative study, based on international expert opinion, 
provides further insight into the medical and functional impacts of 
achondroplasia and how these might be modified through long-term use of 
vosoritide. The results can be used to guide the direction and design of future 
research to validate the assumptions and to discuss potential treatment outcomes 
with disease modifying therapies with families and clinicians.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the leading cancers, with a high burden 
worldwide. As a developing country, Iran is facing with population growth, 
widespread tobacco use, demographic and epidemiologic changes, and environmental 
exposures, which lead to cancers becoming a severe concern of public health in 
Iran. We aimed to examine the burden of lung cancer and its risk factors in 
Iran.
METHODS: We utilized the Global Burden of Disease 2019 data and analyzed the 
total burden of the lung cancer and seven related risk factors by sex, age at 
national and sub-national levels from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: The lung cancer age-standardized death rate increased from 11.8 (95% 
Uncertainty Interval: 9.7-14.4) to 12.9 (11.9-13.9) per 100,000 between 1990 and 
2019. This increase was among women from 5 (4.2-7.1) to 8 (7.2-8.8) per 100,000; 
in contrast, there was a decline among men from 18.5 (14.8-22.6) to 17.8 
(16.2-19.4) per 100,000. The burden of lung cancer is concentrated in the 
advanced age groups. Smoking with 53.5% of total attributable deaths 
(51.0%-55.9%) was the leading risk factor. At the provincial level, there was a 
wide range between the lowest and highest, from 8.3 (7.0-10.0) to 19.1 
(16.4-22.0) per 100,000 population in the incidence rate and from 8.7 (7.3-10.3) 
to 20.6 (17.7-24.0) per 100,000 population in mortality rate, respectively in 
Tehran and West Azerbaijan provinces in 2019.
CONCLUSION: The increasing trend of lung cancer burden among the entire Iranian 
population, the inter-provincial disparities, and the significant rise in burden 
of this cancer in women necessitate the urgent implementation and development of 
policies to prevent and manage lung cancer burden and strategies to reduce 
exposure to risk factors.

Functional Medicine Past, Present, and Future.

Bland JS.

Embedded within the Functional Medicine model is the potential for reversibility 
of altered function. This perspective is inherently different from the Mendelian 
concept of genetics, which is grounded in the construct of dominate and 
recessive genetic characteristics. Mendel's work was obviously groundbreaking, 
but it has also contributed to a deterministic mindset about disease. Many 
people-even today-believe that health and disease are locked into the genes of 
every individual. Modern genomic research continues to reveal that the concept 
of genetic determinism can be (and should be) challenged. The functional 
interaction of our lifestyle, diet, environment, behavior, and social structure 
with our genome and epigenome greatly determines our health outcomes. It has 
been discovered that our aging epigenome can even be rejuvenated. The epigenomic 
structure is also a powerful predictor of disease outcome and life expectancy. 
As our understanding of genetic and epigenetic expression patterns grows, the 
implications for personalized Functional Medicine intervention programs are 
truly revolutionary.

Strategies for Protecting Mitochondria From Metals and Chemicals.

Pizzorno J.

Mitochondria are required for life, and dysfunction leads to chronic disease and 
shortened life expectancy. Unfortunately, suboptimal mitochondrial function is 
very common. While genetic mutations play a role, far more common is the damage 
from nutrient deficiencies and regular accidental and intentional exposure to 
mitotoxic metals and chemicals. Alcohol, antibiotics, metals, bisphenols, 
phthalates, pesticides and herbicides, and statins-the list is long-all impair 
mitochondrial function. Fortunately, toxins can be avoided and their elimination 
from the body can be enhanced. In addition, many natural health molecules help 
protect mitochondria and restore function.

Background Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the United 
States, yet a significant proportion of adults at high risk remain undetected by 
standard screening practices. Polygenic risk score for coronary artery disease 
(CAD-PRS) improves precision in determining the 10-year risk of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease but health benefits and health care costs associated with 
CAD-PRS are unknown. We examined the cost-effectiveness of including CAD-PRS as 
a risk-enhancing factor in the pooled cohort equation (PCE)-the standard of care 
for determining the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease-versus PCE 
alone. Methods and Results We applied a Markov model on a cohort of 40-year-old 
individuals with borderline or intermediate 10-year risk (5% to <20%) for 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to identify those in the top quintile of 
the CAD-PRS distribution who are at high risk and eligible for statin prevention 
therapy. Health outcomes examined included coronary artery disease (CAD; ie, 
myocardial infarction) and ischemic stroke. The model projected medical costs 
(2019 US$) of screening for CAD, statin prevention therapy, treatment, and 
monitoring patients living with CAD or ischemic stroke and quality-adjusted 
life-years for PCE+CAD-PRS versus PCE alone. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were performed to examine uncertainty 
in parameter inputs. PCE+CAD-PRS was dominant compared with PCE alone in the 5- 
and 10-year time horizons. We found that, respectively, PCE+CAD-PRS had 0.003 
and 0.011 higher mean quality-adjusted life-years and $40 and $181 lower mean 
costs per person screened, with 29 and 50 fewer events of CAD and ischemic 
stroke in a cohort of 10 000 individuals compared with PCE alone. The risk of 
developing CAD, the effectiveness of statin prevention therapy, and the cost of 
treating CAD had the largest impact on the cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained. However, this cost remained below the $50 000 willingness-to-pay 
threshold except when the annual risk of developing CAD was <0.006 in the 5-year 
time horizon. Results from Monte Carlo simulation indicated that PCE+CAD-PRS 
would be cost-effective. with the probability of 94% and 99% at $50 000 
willingness-to-pay threshold in the 5- and 10-year time horizon, respectively. 
Conclusions Implementing CAD-PRS as a risk-enhancing factor in the PCE to 
determine the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease reduced the mean 
cost per individual, improved quality-adjusted life-years, and averted future 
events of CAD and ischemic stroke when compared with PCE alone.

Severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, affect ≈1% 
of the population who, as a group, experience significant disadvantage in terms 
of physical health and reduced life expectancy. In this review, we explore the 
interaction between race, ethnicity, severe mental illness, and cardiovascular 
disease, with a focus on cardiovascular care pathways. Finally, we discuss 
strategies to investigate and address disparities in cardiovascular care for 
patients with severe mental illness.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this post-hoc analysis was to assess the impact of 
lurasidone monotherapy on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adults with 
bipolar depression.
METHODS: Data were analyzed from a 6-week randomized, double-blind (DB), 
placebo-controlled trial of lurasidone monotherapy (NCT00868699) and a 6-month 
open label extension (OLE; NCT00868959). Patients who received lurasidone 
monotherapy or placebo during the DB trial were eligible to continue or switch 
to lurasidone monotherapy during the OLE. The 16-item Quality of Life Enjoyment 
and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) was collected at DB 
baseline, DB week 6/OLE baseline, OLE month 3, and OLE month 6. Effect size (ES) 
and mean changes from baseline were reported for Q-LES-Q-SF total and item 
scores during the DB trial and OLE, respectively.
RESULTS: Of 485 patients in the DB trial (lurasidone monotherapy: n = 323; 
placebo: n = 162), 316 patients continued or switched to lurasidone monotherapy 
during the OLE. Significant improvements in Q-LES-Q-SF scores in lurasidone vs. 
placebo were reported for 13 of 16 items (all p < .05) at DB week 6. The 
greatest improvements were overall life satisfaction (ES = 0.57), social 
relationships (0.55), medication satisfaction (0.48), family relationships 
(0.46), and ability to function in daily life (0.45, all p < .001). Improvements 
in Q-LES-Q-SF total and item scores were sustained at OLE month 6.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with lurasidone provided a significant improvement across 
HRQoL items including overall life satisfaction, social and family 
relationships, medication satisfaction, and ability to function in daily life. 
Improvements were sustained during the 6-month OLE.

What constitutes meaningful improvement in myelodysplastic syndromes?

Chandhok NS(1), Sekeres MA(1).

Author information:

Miami, Miami, FL, USA.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous spectrum of clonal stem cell 
disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and resulting peripheral 
blood cytopenias. Clinical manifestations of the disorder are varied and range 
from mild asymptomatic anemia to a markedly truncated life expectancy, 
underscoring the importance of risk-adapted therapy. MDS therapy for both lower- 
and higher-risk patients is an area of immense therapeutic opportunity. This is 
partly due to the diversity of treatment goals between patients and defining 
what constitutes meaningful benefit from a patient's viewpoint. Correlating 
metrics such as hematologic improvement or response rate to develop novel 
therapies can be falsely reassuring to physicians and patients, specifically if 
the interventions are burdensome, disconnected from a patient's sense of 
wellbeing and do not correlate with an improvement in quality of life or 
longevity. We discuss aligning drug development goals with patient goals that 
will lead to meaningful improvement in MDS clinical care.

BACKGROUND: The loss in life expectancy, LLE, is defined as the difference in 
life expectancy between patients with cancer and that of the general population. 
It is a useful measure for summarizing the impact of a cancer diagnosis on an 
individual's life expectancy. However, it is less useful for making comparisons 
of cancer survival across groups or over time, because the LLE is influenced by 
both mortality due to cancer and other causes and the life expectancy in the 
general population.
METHODS: We present an approach for making LLE estimates comparable across 
groups and over time by using reference expected mortality rates with flexible 
parametric relative survival models. The approach is illustrated by estimating 
temporal trends in LLE of patients with colon cancer in Sweden.
RESULTS: The life expectancy of Swedish patients with colon cancer has improved, 
but the LLE has not decreased to the same extent because the life expectancy in 
the general population has also increased. When using a fixed population and 
other-cause mortality, that is, a reference-adjusted approach, the LLE decreases 
over time. For example, using 2010 mortality rates as the reference, the LLE for 
females diagnosed at age 65 decreased from 11.3 if diagnosed in 1976 to 7.2 if 
diagnosed in 2010, and from 3.9 to 1.9 years for women 85 years old at 
diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The reference-adjusted LLE is useful for making comparisons across 
calendar time, or groups, because differences in other-cause mortality are 
removed.
IMPACT: The reference-adjusted approach enhances the use of LLE as a comparative 
measure.

among Black Americans.

Columbia, South Carolina, USA.

Black Americans have the lowest life expectancy and health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL; a strong predictor of premature mortality) of any racial/ethnic 
group in the United States. Low rates of physical activity and engagement in 
healthy eating are two known contributors to low HRQoL. Black Americans are more 
likely to live in environments that inhibit engagement in these two 
contributors. The present study examined sense of community as a buffer against 
the adverse effects of low physical activity and healthy eating on HRQoL among 
Black Americans. A sample of 290 Black American adults were recruited for the 
present study. Results indicate that sense of community buffers against the 
adverse effects of low physical activity on HRQoL. The results of the present 
study can be used by health promotion interventionists and policy-makers to 
improve HRQoL and reduce premature mortality among Black Americans.

OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer (LC) remains a burden for patients and healthcare 
systems, with most cases only diagnosed once disease is late stage. Screening 
for LC with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has shown a stage shift and led 
to a lung cancer-specific mortality reduction. Economic evaluations have been 
conducted which explore the benefits and costs of screening, however, previous 
systematic reviews concluded results were heterogeneous. LC screening has 
evolved and there have been further cost-effectiveness analyses conducted. The 
aim of this study was to provide an up-to-date systematic review of the 
cost-effectiveness of LC screening with LDCT.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Databases were searched for full papers published in 
English 01/1994-02/2022. Inclusion criteria was full economic evaluation of LC 
screening using LDCT compared to either no screening or chest X-ray.
RESULTS: Forty-five evaluations were identified, three conducted alongside 
trials and 42 modelling studies. Thirty-nine evaluations (86.7%) found LC 
screening with LDCT to be cost-effective. Several findings were broadly 
consistent across studies: cost-effectiveness was optimal in those age 
55-75 years and smoking history of at least 20 pack-years. Biennial screening 
was often more cost-effective than annual screening and would likely result in 
less additional findings and radiation exposure. A smoking cessation 
intervention alongside screening improved cost-effectiveness, but which 
intervention was optimal was unclear. Risk predictions models using more 
parameters to target participants for screening did not have more benefits than 
those using age and smoking alone, and cost-effectiveness was equivalent. 
Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to cost and specificity of LDCT, and disutility 
associated with screening.
CONCLUSION: Overall, LC screening with LDCT is cost-effective in a high-risk 
population. Questions remain regarding risk prediction models, smoking cessation 
interventions and appropriateness of utility values in the screened population. 
Once these uncertainties are addressed, further economic evaluation may be 
required to inform policymakers prior to implementation.

INTRODUCTION: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients frequently have major 
comorbidities but there is scarce data regarding the impact of these conditions 
on management strategies. We used simulation modeling to compare different 
treatments for stage I NSCLC for patients with common major comorbidities.
METHODS: We used data on NSCLC patinet outcomes and quality of life from: (1) 
the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database linked to Medicare 
claims; (2) Kaiser Permanente Southern California electronic health records; and 
(3) SEER-Medical Health Outcomes Survey to parameterize a novel simulation model 
of management and outcomes for stage I NSCLC. Relative efficacy of treatment 
modalities (lobectomy, segmentectomy, wedge resection and stereotactic body 
radiotherapy [SBRT]) was collected from existing literature and combined using 
evidence synthesis methods. We then simulated multiple randomized trials 
comparing these treatments in a variety of scenarios, estimating quality 
adjusted life expectancy (QALE) according to age, tumor size, histologic 
subtype, and comorbidity status.
RESULTS: Lobectomy and segmentectomy yielded the greatest QALE gains among all 
simulated age, tumor size and comorbidity groups. Optimal treatment strategies 
differed by patient sex and age; wedge resection was among the optimal 
strategies for women aged 80-84 with tumors 0-2 cm in size. SBRT was included in 
some optimal strategies for patients aged 80-84 with multimorbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: In simulated comparative trials of four common treatments for stage 
I NSCLC, aggressive surgical management was typically associated with the 
greatest projected QALE gains despite the presence of comorbidities, although 
less aggressive strategies were predicted to be non-inferior in some older 
comorbid patient groups.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer is the leading cause of death among children.
OBJECTIVES: We report on the latest estimates of the burden of cancer among 
children at the global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, children's cancer 
data were analyzed by sex, age, year, and location. Age-standardized rates were 
used to compare the burdens among regions and nations. Joinpoint analysis was 
applied to assess the temporal trend of the global childhood cancer burden.
RESULTS: In 2019, 291,319 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 254,239 to 331,993) 
new cases and 98,834 (86,124 to 113,581) deaths from childhood cancer were 
documented globally. Further, 8,302,464 (7,230,447 to 9,555,118) DALYs and 
1,806,630 (1,567,808 to 2,089,668) prevalent cases were recorded in the same 
year. Age-standardized incidence and prevalence rates of childhood cancer were 
greatest in higher SDI settings and increased most significantly in Australasia 
and Southern Latin America over the last 30 years. However, although 
age-standardized death and DALY rates of childhood cancer have remarkably 
decreased in all regions since 1990, countries with a lower SDI showed the 
highest rates in 2019, particularly in countries in Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Among all cancers, leukemia has shown the largest decrease in burden since 1990. 
Despite this, leukemia was still the most common cancer and the leading cause of 
death among children in 2019, followed by brain and central nervous system 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: On a global scale, the childhood cancer burden has significantly 
fallen over the last 30 years, but is still higher in lower SDI countries. 
Effective interventions and collaborations among nations should be facilitated 
to improve healthcare among children with cancer in countries with lower SDI.
