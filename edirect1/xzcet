however, as represented by longevity. This paper incorporates longevity into an 
overall assessment of the evolution of cross-country inequality and shows that 
it is quantitatively important. The absence of reduction in cross-country 
inequality up to the 1990s documented in previous work is in stark contrast to 
the reduction in inequality after incorporating gains in longevity. Throughout 
the post–World War II period, health contributed to reduce significantly welfare 
inequality across countries. This paper derives valuation formulas for 
infra-marginal changes in longevity and computes a "full" growth rate that 
incorporates the gains in health experienced by 96 countries for the period 
between 1960 and 2000. Incorporating longevity gains changes traditional 
results; countries starting with lower income tended to grow faster than 
countries starting with higher income. We estimate an average yearly growth in 
"full income" of 4.1 percent for the poorest 50 percent of countries in 1960, of 
which 1.7 percentage points are due to health, as opposed to a growth of 2.6 
percent for the richest 50 percent of countries, of which only 0.4 percentage 
points are due to health. Additionally, we decompose changes in life expectancy 
into changes attributable to 13 broad groups of causes of death and three age 
groups. We show that mortality from infectious, respiratory, and digestive 
diseases, congenital, perinatal, and “ill-defined” conditions, mostly 
concentrated before age 20 and between ages 20 and 50, is responsible for most 
of the reduction in life expectancy inequality. At the same time, the recent 
effect of AIDS, together with reductions in mortality after age 50--due to 
nervous system, senses organs, heart and circulatory diseases--contributed to 
increase health inequality across countries.

While average human life expectancy has increased dramatically in the last 
century, the maximum life span has only modestly increased. These observations 
prompted the notion that human life span might have reached its maximal natural 
limit of ~115 years. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted a systematic 
analysis of all-cause human mortality throughout the 20th century. Our analyses 
revealed that, once cause of death is accounted for, there is a proportional 
increase in both median age of death and maximum life span. To examine whether 
pathway targeted aging interventions affected both median and maximum life span, 
we analyzed hundreds of interventions performed in multiple organisms (yeast, 
worms, flies, and rodents). Three criteria: median, maximum, and last survivor 
life spans were all significantly extended, and to a similar extent. Altogether, 
these findings suggest that targeting the biological/genetic causes of aging can 
allow breaking the currently observed ceiling of human maximal life span.

AIMS: Post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) occurs in 20-50% of patients 
amid post-operative stay after Cardiac Surgery. We intend to determine whether 
colchicine therapy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is a cost-effective 
strategy for prevention of POAF. To undertake cost utility analysis and 
calculate incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) for colchicine therapy in these 
subgroup of patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS DESIGN: Decision tree model to calculate the ICUR comparing 
two treatment strategies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. One wherein 
patients received colchicine along with usual care and second where they 
received placebo or just usual care. Cost utility analysis was undertaken using 
relevant data from the systematic review and meta-analysis of the available 
randomized controlled trials till June 2016 and mean cost calculations from 
validated available sources across various jurisdictions.
RESULTS: Colchicine treatment based on mean costs for life expectancy calculated 
at 10 years' post-surgery using recommended discounting rates of 3.5% was 
€ 17544.80 cheaper per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The incremental 
cost is negative and the incremental effect (QALY) is positive (South East 
quadrant), Hence the intervention of colchicine treatment is unequivocally 
cost-effective, meaning it is dominant and achieves better outcomes at a lower 
cost.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a benchmark for current and future analyses 
relating to effectiveness of colchicine on POAF events after cardiac surgery. 
Currently, there are few reports that provide cutting edge estimates of the 
higher expenses associated with POAF. Future analyses should likewise explore 
the impact of added costs from using pharmacologic efforts to prevent and treat 
POAF after cardiac surgery.

BACKGROUND: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), including E. coli 
O157:H7, are responsible for numerous foodborne outbreaks annually worldwide. E. 
coli O157:H7, as well as pathogenic non-O157:H7 STECs, can cause life-threating 
complications, such as bloody diarrhea (hemolytic colitis) and hemolytic-uremic 
syndrome (HUS). Previously, we developed a real-time PCR assay to detect E. coli 
O157:H7 in foods by targeting a unique putative fimbriae protein Z3276. To 
extend the detection spectrum of the assay, we report a multiplex real-time PCR 
assay to specifically detect E. coli O157:H7 and screen for non-O157 STEC by 
targeting Z3276 and Shiga toxin genes (stx1 and stx2). Also, an internal 
amplification control (IAC) was incorporated into the assay to monitor the 
amplification efficiency.
METHODS: The multiplex real-time PCR assay was developed using the Life 
Technology ABI 7500 System platform and the standard chemistry. The optimal 
amplification mixture of the assay contains 12.5 μl of 2 × Universal Master Mix 
(Life Technology), 200 nM forward and reverse primers, appropriate 
concentrations of four probes [(Z3276 (80 nM), stx1 (80 nM), stx2 (20 nM), and 
IAC (40 nM)], 2 μl of template DNA, and water (to make up to 25 μl in total 
volume). The amplification conditions of the assay were set as follows: 
activation of TaqMan at 95 °C for 10 min, then 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 
°C for 10 s and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 60 s.
RESULTS: The multiplex assay was optimized for amplification conditions. The 
limit of detection (LOD) for the multiplex assay was determined to be 200 fg of 
bacterial DNA, which is equivalent to 40 CFU per reaction which is similar to 
the LOD generated in single targeted PCRs. Inclusivity and exclusivity 
determinants were performed with 196 bacterial strains. All E. coli O157:H7 (n = 
135) were detected as positive and all STEC strains (n = 33) were positive for 
stx1, or stx2, or stx1 and stx2 (Table 1). No cross reactivity was detected with 
Salmonella enterica, Shigella strains, or any other pathogenic strains tested.
CONCLUSIONS: A multiplex real-time PCR assay that can rapidly and simultaneously 
detect E. coli O157:H7 and screen for non-O157 STEC strains has been developed 
and assessed for efficacy. The inclusivity and exclusivity tests demonstrated 
high sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex real-time PCR assay. In 
addition, this multiplex assay was shown to be effective for the detection of E. 
coli O157:H7 from two common food matrices, beef and spinach, and may be applied 
for detection of E. coli O157:H7 and screening for non-O157 STEC strains from 
other food matrices as well.

The strange case of Mr. H. Starting dialysis at 90 years of age: clinical 
choices impact on ethical decisions.

BACKGROUND: Starting dialysis at an advanced age is a clinical challenge and an 
ethical dilemma. The advantages of starting dialysis at "extreme" ages are 
questionable as high dialysis-related morbidity induces a reflection on the 
cost- benefit ratio of this demanding and expensive treatment in a person that 
has a short life expectancy. Where clinical advantages are doubtful, ethical 
analysis can help us reach decisions and find adapted solutions.
CASE PRESENTATION: Mr. H is a ninety-year-old patient with end-stage kidney 
disease that is no longer manageable with conservative care, in spite of optimal 
nutritional management, good blood pressure control and strict clinical and 
metabolic evaluations; dialysis is the next step, but its morbidity is 
challenging. The case is analysed according to principlism (beneficence, 
non-maleficence, justice and respect for autonomy). In the setting of care, 
dialysis is available without restriction; therefore the principle of justice 
only partially applied, in the absence of restraints on health-care expenditure. 
The final decision on whether or not to start dialysis rested with Mr. H 
(respect for autonomy). However, his choice depended on the balance between 
beneficence and non-maleficence. The advantages of dialysis in restoring 
metabolic equilibrium were clear, and the expected negative effects of dialysis 
were therefore decisive. Mr. H has a contraindication to peritoneal dialysis 
(severe arthritis impairing self-performance) and felt performing it with 
nursing help would be intrusive. Post dialysis fatigue, poor tolerance, 
hypotension and intrusiveness in daily life of haemodialysis patients are 
closely linked to the classic thrice-weekly, four-hour schedule. A personalized 
incremental dialysis approach, starting with one session per week, adapting the 
timing to the patient's daily life, can limit side effects and "dialysis shock".
CONCLUSIONS: An individualized approach to complex decisions such as dialysis 
start can alter the delicate benefit/side-effect balance, ultimately affecting 
the patient's choice, and points to a narrative, tailor-made approach as an 
alternative to therapeutic nihilism, in very old and fragile patients.

INTRODUCTION: Optimizing radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy through 
advanced imaging and accelerated radiation schemes shows promising results in 
locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study compared the 
cost-effectiveness of positron emission tomography-computed tomography based 
isotoxic accelerated sequential chemo-radiation (SRT2) and concurrent 
chemo-radiation with daily low-dose cisplatin (CRT2) with standard sequential 
(SRT1) and concurrent chemo-radiation (CRT1).
METHODS: We used an externally validated mathematical model to simulate the four 
treatment strategies. The model was built using data from 200 NSCLC patients 
treated with curative sequential chemo-radiation. For concurrent strategies, 
data from a meta-analysis and a single study were included in the model. Costs, 
utilities, and resource use estimates were obtained from literature. Primary 
outcomes were the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratio (ICUR) 
of each strategy. Scenario analyses were carried out to investigate the impact 
of uncertainty.
RESULTS: Total undiscounted costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for 
SRT1, CRT1, SRT2, and CRT2 were EUR 17,288, EUR 18,756, EUR 19,072, EUR 17,360 
and QALYs 1.10, 1.15, 1.40, and 1.40, respectively. Compared with SRT1, the 
ICURs were EUR 38,024/QALY for CRT1, EUR 6,249/QALY for SRT2, and EUR 346/QALY 
for CRT2. CRT2 was highly cost-effective compared with SRT1. Moreover, CRT2 was 
more effective and less costly than CRT1 and SRT2. Therefore, these strategies 
were dominated by CRT2.
CONCLUSION: Optimized sequential and concurrent chemo-radiation strategies are 
more effective and cost-effective than the current conventional sequential and 
concurrent strategies. Concurrent chemo-radiation with a daily low dose 
cisplatin regimen is the most cost-effective treatment option for locally 
advanced inoperable NSCLC patients.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate of all cancers 
worldwide. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung 
cancers and has an extremely poor prognosis. Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB 
family blocker designed to suppress cellular signaling and inhibit cellular 
growth and is approved in Europe after platinum-based therapy for squamous 
NSCLC. The objective of the present analysis was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of afatinib after platinum-based therapy for squamous NSCLC 
in France.
METHODS: The study population was based on the LUX-Lung 8 trial that compared 
afatinib with erlotinib in patients with squamous NSCLC. The analysis was 
performed from the perspective of all health care funders and affected patients. 
A partitioned survival model was developed to evaluate cost-effectiveness based 
on progression-free survival and overall survival in the trial. Life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life expectancy and direct costs were evaluated over a 10-year 
time horizon. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 4% annually. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Model projections indicated that afatinib was associated with greater 
life expectancy (0.16 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.094 
quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) than that projected for erlotinib. The 
total cost of treatment over a 10-year time horizon was higher for afatinib than 
erlotinib, EUR12,364 versus EUR9,510, leading to an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR30,277 per QALY gained for afatinib versus 
erlotinib. Sensitivity analyses showed that the base case findings were stable 
under variation of a range of model inputs.
CONCLUSION: Based on data from the LUX-Lung 8 trial, afatinib was projected to 
improve clinical outcomes versus erlotinib, with a 97% probability of being 
cost-effective assuming a willingness to pay of EUR70,000 per QALY gained, after 
platinum-based therapy in patients with squamous NSCLC in France.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy has increased significantly among chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) patients due to the extensive use of polypharmacy practice for 
medication prescriptions. This predisposes them to potential drug-drug 
interactions (DDIs), which can lead to an increase in morbidity, mortality, 
length of hospital stay, and health care cost.
METHODS: This was a 30-month retrospective study that reviewed the medical case 
records of consenting adult CKD patients from January 2014 to June 2016. The 
Medscape drug reference database was used to evaluate patients' medications for 
potential DDIs.
RESULTS: This study involved 123 adult CKD patients (63 [51.22%] males and 60 
[48.78%] females) with a mean age of 53.81±16.03 years. The most common comorbid 
conditions were hypertension (112 [91.10%]) and diabetes mellitus (45 [36.60%]). 
Regarding the form of nephrological interventions being offered, the majority of 
the respondents - 66 (53.66%) were on maintenance dialysis, followed by 53 
(43.09%) respondents on conservative care, while 4 (3.25%) respondents were on 
renal transplantation. A total of 1264 prescriptions were made, and the mean 
number of prescribed medications per patient was 10.28±3.85. The most frequently 
prescribed medications were furosemide (88 [71.6%]), heparin (67 [54.47%]), 
lisinopril (65 [52.9%]), oral calcium carbonate (CaCO3) (63 [51.2%]), α-calcidol 
(62 [50.4%]), and erythropoietin (61 [49.6%]). A total number of 1851 potential 
DDIs were observed among 118 patients. The prevalence of potential DDIs in this 
study was 78.0%, while the mean DDI per prescription was 1.50. Among the 
potential DDIs observed, the severity was mild in 639 (34.5%) patients, moderate 
in 1160 (62.7%) patients, and major in 51 (2.8%) patients and only 1 (0.1%) 
patient was of contraindicated drug combination. The most frequent DDIs' pattern 
observed was between oral CaCO3 and oral ferrous sulfate. There was a 
statistically significant association between the number of prescribed 
medications and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; pre-ESRD and 
ESRD staging) with a P-value of 0.00000119. This implies that the number of 
prescribed medications increases as the eGFR declines in advance CKD stage 
patients.
CONCLUSION: Most of these interactions have moderate severity and delayed onset, 
hence the need to follow-up these patients after prescription in order to reduce 
associated morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and health care cost. 
Physicians and clinical pharmacists should utilise available interaction 
software to avoid harmful DDIs in these patients.

CASES: Traumatic intracranial aneurysm following blunt head injury is uncommon 
but can be induced by extension of skull base fracture and causes unexpected 
hemorrhagic complications. We present two cases of traumatic intracranial 
aneurysm in the paraclinoid area that was revealed by delayed massive epistaxis. 
Lack of initial neurological deficits omitted screening for cerebrovascular 
injury.
OUTCOME: Internal trapping was carried out using endovascular techniques in both 
cases, with extracranial-intracranial bypass in one case. No recurrent bleeding 
occurred in either case.
CONCLUSION: To prevent unexpected delayed life-threatening hemorrhagic 
accidents, careful assessment of skull-base fracture is prerequisite, even in 
cases of mild facial injury.

Nonacog beta pegol [Refixia® (EU)] is an intravenously-administered, 
glycoPEGylated recombinant factor IX (FIX), with an extended terminal half-life. 
It is approved in the EU for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in 
patients aged ≥ 12 years with haemophilia B. The therapeutic efficacy and safety 
of nonacog beta pegol was demonstrated in the phase 3 Paradigm trials in 
previously treated adolescents and adults with haemophilia B. In Paradigm 2, 
nonacog beta pegol showed good haemostatic effects when treating bleeds 
on-demand, and reduced annualized bleeding rates when used as a once-weekly 
prophylaxis. It also improved some health-related quality of life measures in 
adult patients. The longer-term efficacy of nonacog beta pegol was demonstrated 
in the open-label extension Paradigm 4 trial. In Paradigm 3, nonacog beta pegol 
effectively maintained intraoperative and postoperative haemostasis. Nonacog 
beta pegol was well tolerated in phase 3 clinical trials in patients with 
haemophilia B, with no evidence of FIX inhibitor formation, allergic reactions 
or thromboembolic complications. In conclusion, nonacog beta pegol is effective 
and well tolerated in the on-demand, prophylaxis and perioperative settings in 
adolescent and adults with haemophilia B. Its extended half-life allows for 
once-weekly prophylaxis. Therefore, nonacog beta pegol is a useful additional 
treatment option for patients with haemophilia B.

BACKGROUND: Recent short-term clinical trials in patients with Duchenne Muscular 
Dystrophy (DMD) have indicated greater disease variability in terms of 
progression than expected. In addition, as average life-expectancy increases, 
reliable data is required on clinical progression in the older DMD population.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of corticosteroids on major clinical 
outcomes of DMD in a large multinational cohort of genetically confirmed DMD 
patients.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we analysed clinical data from 5345 
genetically confirmed DMD patients from 31 countries held within the TREAT-NMD 
global DMD database. For analysis patients were categorised by corticosteroid 
background and further stratified by age.
RESULTS: Loss of ambulation in non-steroid treated patients was 10 years and in 
corticosteroid treated patients 13 years old (p = 0.0001). Corticosteroid 
treated patients were less likely to need scoliosis surgery (p < 0.001) or 
ventilatory support (p < 0.001) and there was a mild cardioprotective effect of 
corticosteroids in the patient population aged 20 years and older (p = 0.0035). 
Patients with a single deletion of exon 45 showed an increased survival in 
contrast to other single exon deletions.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides data on clinical outcomes of DMD across many 
healthcare settings and including a sizeable cohort of older patients. Our data 
confirm the benefits of corticosteroid treatment on ambulation, need for 
scoliosis surgery, ventilation and, to a lesser extent, cardiomyopathy. This 
study underlines the importance of data collection via patient registries and 
the critical role of multi-centre collaboration in the rare disease field.

OBJECTIVE: Malignant glioma (MG) is a devastating neuro-oncologic disease with 
almost invariably poor prognosis, yet many families facing malignant glioma have 
poor prognostic awareness (PA), or the awareness of the patient's incurable 
disease and shortened life expectancy. Accurate PA is associated with favorable 
medical outcomes at end-of-life for patients and psychosocial outcomes for 
informal caregivers (ICs) through bereavement. To date, however, no study has 
specifically examined PA among MG ICs and the information they receive that 
shapes their awareness.
METHODS: Thirty-two ICs of patients with malignant glioma completed a 
semi-structured assessment of their awareness of the incurability and life 
expectancy of their loved one's illness, and to understand their sources of 
prognostic information and preferences for communication of prognostic 
information.
RESULTS: Twenty-two (69%) ICs had full PA-awareness of the incurability of 
malignant glioma and accurate estimates of their loved ones' life expectancy. 
Twenty-three (72%) felt that prognostic information was extremely or very 
important to possess, and 16 (50%) desired more prognostic information. The 
majority of ICs received prognostic information from physicians and the 
Internet. Qualitative analyses revealed that many ICs had difficulty navigating 
medical encounters in which they concurrently wanted to elicit prognostic 
information from physicians and protect patients from such information.
CONCLUSIONS: Accurate and timely PA is necessary for ICs to serve as critical 
members of health care teams. Interventions are needed to foster ICs' skills in 
navigating prognostic communication with patients and health care providers and 
thereby improve their ability to advocate for their loved one's wishes.

Mortality Reductions, Educational Attainment, and Fertility Choice.

Soares RR(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Economics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD.

This paper develops a model where reductions in mortality are the main force 
behind economic development. The model generates a pattern of changes similar to 
the demographic transition, where gains in life expectancy at birth are followed 
by reductions in fertility and increases in the rate of human capital 
accumulation. The onset of the transition is characterized by a critical level 
of life expectancy at birth, which marks the movement of the economy from a 
Malthusian equilibrium to an equilibrium with investments in human capital and 
the possibility of long-run growth.

BACKGROUND: The CheckMate 141 trial found that nivolumab improved survival for 
patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer (HNC). Despite the 
improved survival, nivolumab is much more expensive than standard therapies. 
This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab for the treatment of 
HNC.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to simulate treatment with nivolumab or 
standard single-agent therapy for patients with recurrent or metastatic 
platinum-refractory HNC. Transition probabilities, including disease 
progression, survival, and probability of toxicity, were derived from clinical 
trial data, while costs (in 2017 US dollars) and health utilities were estimated 
from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), expressed as 
dollar per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), were calculated, with values of 
less than $100 000/QALY considered cost-effective from a health care payer 
perspective. We conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to 
assess model uncertainty.
RESULTS: Our base case model found that treatment with nivolumab increased 
overall cost by $117 800 and improved effectiveness by 0.400 QALYs compared with 
standard therapy, leading to an ICER of $294 400/QALY. The model was most 
sensitive to the cost of nivolumab, though nivolumab only became cost-effective 
if the cost per cycle decreased from $13 432 to $3931. The model was not 
particularly sensitive to assumptions about survival. If one assumed that all 
patients alive at the end of the CheckMate 141 trial were cured of their 
disease, nivolumab was still not cost-effective (ICER $244 600/QALY).
CONCLUSION: While nivolumab improves overall survival, at its current cost it 
would not be considered a cost-effective treatment option for patients with HNC.

OBJECTIVES: Ninety-five per cent of those operated on for popliteal artery 
aneurysm (PA) are men. Thus, PAs in women are difficult to investigate. The aim 
was to study the disease in women.
METHODS: Women treated for PA in 1987-2012, prospectively registered in the 
Swedish vascular registry, Swedvasc, supplemented by case records, were compared 
with the larger male cohort. Survival was determined through cross linkage with 
the National Population Registry.
RESULTS: 1509 patients (men and women), 1872 legs, were identified; of these 74 
patients (4.9%) were women, 81 legs (4.3%). The median age was 70 years in women 
versus 69 in men. Twenty-nine centres operated on women (range 1-7 
women/centre). There were no time trends in the proportion of women operated on 
(p=.5). Bilateral PA occurred in 9.5% of women and 27.0% of men (p=.002). For 
symptomatic aneurysms, there was a larger proportion of small aneurysms (<2 cm) 
among women than men (24% vs. 8%, p=.005), there was no such difference in 
asymptomatic aneurysms. Distribution between asymptomatic and symptomatic PA was 
31% versus 69%, similar to men. The prevalence of concomitant aneurysms in the 
aorto-iliac and femoral arteries, and the frequency of presenting symptoms were 
similar compared with men. Three PA were ruptured (3.7%). Thrombolysis was used 
in 23 of 45 legs treated for acute ischaemia (51%). Eight legs were treated with 
endovascular stent grafts (9.8%), compared with 7.9% in men (p=.5). Seven legs 
were amputated (8.6%). Crude survival was similar to men.
CONCLUSIONS: PA is similar in women and men, but bilateral disease was less 
common in women and symptomatic PA were more often <2 cm in diameter. Women had 
the same survival as men, despite women generally having better life expectancy. 
Although the largest series ever published on women with PA, the sample size is 
small, making it prone to type II statistical error.

The built environment has a significant influence on population levels of 
physical activity (PA) and therefore health. However, PA-related health benefits 
are seldom considered in transport and urban planning (i.e. built environment 
interventions) cost-benefit analysis. Cost-benefit analysis implies that the 
benefits of any initiative are valued in monetary terms to make them 
commensurable with costs. This leads to the need for monetised values of the 
health benefits of PA. The aim of this study was to explore a method for the 
incorporation of monetised PA-related health benefits in cost-benefit analysis 
of built environment interventions. Firstly, we estimated the change in 
population level of PA attributable to a change in the built environment due to 
the intervention. Then, changes in population levels of PA were translated into 
monetary values. For the first step we used estimates from the literature for 
the association of built environment features with physical activity outcomes. 
For the second step we used the multi-cohort proportional multi-state life table 
model to predict changes in health-adjusted life years and health care costs as 
a function of changes in PA. Finally, we monetised health-adjusted life years 
using the value of a statistical life year. Future research could adapt these 
methods to assess the health and economic impacts of specific urban development 
scenarios by working in collaboration with urban planners.

Over the past 30 years, there have been significant advancements in the field of 
nanomaterials. The possibility to use them in applications such as cancer 
treatment is extremely promising; however, the toxicity of many nanomaterials as 
well as the high costs associated with their use is still a concern. This paper 
aims to study the connection between nanomaterial toxicity and cost. This 
synergy may be interpreted as a different version of the classic "Prisoner's 
Dilemma" game, which in this case attempts to explain the possible outcomes of 
cooperation versus conflict between science advocating for the use of high-risk, 
possibly toxic materials due to their high returns, and society that might be 
dubious about the use of high-risk materials. In an effort to create diverse 
evaluation methodologies, this work uses a forecast horizon to evaluate the 
current status and expected future of the nanomaterials market. The historical 
progress of each market, toxicity information, and possible returns stemming 
from their use is taken into account to analyze the predictions. Our results 
suggest various trends for the associated costs and nanotoxicity of the studied 
materials.

OBJECTIVES: People with mental illnesses are more likely to experience 
diabetes-related complications that can reduce life expectancy by 10 to 15 
years. Diabetes management and outcomes can be improved when lifestyle 
interventions addressing healthful eating habits and physical activity use 
content tailored to the learning needs of individuals or groups. Understanding 
the challenges that prevent adherence to diabetes recommendations can start to 
inform the design of tailored diabetes education care. The purpose of this pilot 
study was to explore the perspectives of clients with mental illnesses and type 
2 diabetes with regard to challenges faced when engaging in diabetes self-care 
behaviours.
METHODS: Focus groups were held with 17 people who had type 2 diabetes and 
mental illnesses, including depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety 
disorder, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. In the groups, 
participants were asked to share their experiences with diabetes self-care and 
access to diabetes-education services. Data were transcribed verbatim, assessed 
for quality and saturation and coded to identify relationships and meanings 
among identified themes.
RESULTS: Participants identified many challenges and unmet needs that created 
multidimensional and interrelated barriers to care, ultimately resulting in poor 
diabetes self-care behaviours. Some challenges were psychological in nature and 
related to emotional states, lifestyles and food habits, perceptions of 
affordability, health literacy and value of health information. Other challenges 
included the physical states of health and social environments.
CONCLUSIONS: Multidimensional diabetes education programs that consider 
psychological, physical and social challenges are needed to address the needs of 
people with mental illnesses.
