beginning in the Anthropocene epoch (300 years ago). A review of human immune 
health and adaptations responding to environmental (biological, chemical, 
physical, and psychological) stresses, which are influenced by social 
conditions, emphasize the involvement of fluctuations in immune cell subsets 
affecting influential gene-environment interactions. The literature from a 
variety of fields (anthropological, immunological, and environmental) is 
incorporated to present an expanded perspective on shifts in diseases within the 
context of immune balance and function and environmental immunology. The 
influences between historical and contemporary human ecology are examined in 
relation to human immunity. Several examples of shifts in human physiology and 
immunity support the premise that increased incidences of chronic diseases are a 
consequence of human modification of environment and lifestyle. Although the 
development of better health care and a broader understanding of human health 
have helped with better life quality and expectancy, the transition of morbidity 
and mortality rates from infections to chronic diseases is a cause for concern. 
Combinations of environmental stressors/pollutants and human behaviors and 
conditions are modulating the immune-neuroendocrine network, which compromises 
health benefits.

INTRODUCTION: One of the major complications in total hip arthroplasty (THA) is 
dislocation of the prosthesis. To prevent early dislocation, patients are 
instructed with movement restrictions. The first goal in this development is to 
obtain insight in the movement restrictions that are reported to have low levels 
of self-efficacy during activities of daily life. The second goal is to reveal 
the design needs for an ambulant hip dislocation alert system (HipDas) and the 
third goal is to explore its usability among patients.
METHODS: Patient-centered experiences with THA were explored by the use of a 
questionnaire and a semistructured focus group. The questionnaire was 
administered among n = 32 THA patients at 1 week preoperative and at 3 and 6 
weeks postoperative. The questions addressed self-efficacy, performance and 
effort expectancy, and usefulness and social influence. The focus group 
consisted of patient journeys and scenario composition. The usability of a 
prototype version of the HipDas system was evaluated (n = 5).
RESULTS: Flexion of the hip >90°, bending over while sitting in a chair, and 
sleeping in a supine position are the restrictions that have the lowest 
self-efficacy. The majority of patients (>86.6%) believe that a future HipDas is 
useful. Focus group outcomes suggest there is a gradual decrease in the 
threshold for feedback. The system is preferably used in the first 6 weeks after 
surgery and appeared to be usable and highly clinically relevant.
DISCUSSION: HipDas is considered an interesting concept that can accelerate 
functional recovery of patients following THA by providing support on how to 
properly apply postoperative movement restrictions to prevent a dislocation.

Dear Editor, the association between lymphomas and autoimmune manifestations, as 
well as the prevalence of the cases of coexistent lymphomas and autoimmune 
conditions, has not been completely established (1-3). Since cutaneous T-cell 
lymphoma (CTCL) cases are rare, any hypothesis can only be based on case reports 
or small case series. We present the case of a male patient with folliculotropic 
mycosis fungoides (FMF) and synchronous autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) with 
extremely high levels of cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9). The patient was under 
the supervision of a multidisciplinary team consisting of dermatologists, 
hepatologists, and hematologists. The patient died 15 months after the diagnoses 
of FMF and AIH were established and 3.5 years after the first skin changes. 
Based on our knowledge and search of medical databases, this is the first case 
of AIH in a patient with CTCL, i.e. with MF. A 53-year-old male patient was 
admitted to our Dermatology Clinic in September 2014 after being briefly treated 
with acitretin. During hospitalization, he was diagnosed with FMF, autoimmune 
hepatitis, and newly developed diabetes mellitus. At the time of hospital 
admission, about 70 percent of the surface of the skin was affected, infiltrated 
with numerous cysts on the face, neck, and upper thorax. The patient also 
presented with alopecia affecting most of the scalp, loss of eyebrows and 
eyelashes (Figure 1), and complained of intensive itching. The clinical 
presentation suggested the diagnosis of FMF, which was later confirmed based on 
histological (Figure 2) and immunohistochemical (Figure 3) findings. The 
histochemical staining method PAS-Alcian did not reveal mucin deposits. 
Immunohistochemical findings revealed tumor cells to show aberrant 
T-immunophenotypes - CD3+, CD2+, CD5-, CD7-, CD4+, CD8-, CD30-. Due to elevated 
serum conjugated bilirubin and extremely high levels of hepatocellular and 
cholestatic liver enzymes, the patient was transferred to the Gastroenterology 
Department. Diagnosis of AIH was established based on the liver biopsy (highly 
active autoimmune hepatitis) and the exclusion of viral etiology, drug-induced 
hepatotoxicity, and inherited metabolic disorders of the liver. CA 19-9 level 
was extremely high (4475.0; RR <37.0 µg/L). In March 2015, CA 19-9 decreased to 
365.3. In April 2015, erythroderma and small isolated tumors on the trunk and 
extremities developed. The patient was treated with RE-PUVA and radio-therapy. 
In June 2015, due to systemic symptoms, the patient was started on PUVA with 
IFNα. In November 2015, erythroderma persisted together with larger and 
ulcerated tumors. The patient was treated at the Hematological Department with 
two cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and 
methylprednisolone. From March 2015, the patient was continuously treated with 
ursodeoxycholic acid, prednisolone, azathioprine, analog insulin, and 
allopurinol. MSCT revealed lymphoma infiltrates in the liver, spleen, and 
peritoneum (gross tumors). The immunophenotypic analysis of the cells in ascites 
revealed atypical lymphocytes with convoluted nuclei - LCA+, CD3+, CD20-. The 
patient died in December 2015 due to sepsis with febrile neutropenia. Before 
death, he suffered from candidiasis and toxic liver damage due to fluconazole. 
FMF is an aggressive MF variant with infiltration of lymph nodes, visceral 
involvement at an earlier stage, and decreased life expectancy (4). Autoimmune 
hepatitis (AIH) is still an unclear progressive liver disease of unknown 
etiology which features hypergammaglobulinemia, detectable autoantibodies, and 
interface hepatitis (5). Being exposed to xenobiotic (acitretin) with consequent 
liver damage could lead to the formation of self-antigens to which the patient's 
immune system might have sensitized, and the autoimmune attack continued (6). 
Slightly elevated CA 19-9 levels in autoimmune hepatitis were reported by other 
authors (7-9). It should be noted that the liver involvement with atypical 
lymphocytes can be diffuse without any detectable nodules on a CT scan (4). 
Soluble liver antigen and liver-pancreas antibodies, together with CA 19-9, need 
to be implemented as routine diagnostic tools to rationalize the usage of tumor 
markers in day-to-day practice as well in diagnosis of AIH (10).

Health systems strengthening (HSS) interventions are increasingly being 
implemented to improve maternal and child health (MCH) services in low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs). This study reviews global literature on 
cost-effectiveness of HSS interventions in improving MCH. A systematic review 
was conducted. Keywords, based on World Health Organization framework on health 
systems and prior studies, were applied to search in bibliographic databases and 
on the web. Articles that estimated cost-effectiveness of HSS interventions in 
LMICs were included in the analysis. Each of the 24 selected studies from 15 
countries was assessed in terms of quality and biases using Cochrane's criteria. 
Review Manager and an Excel template were used to extract data and synthesize 
findings. HSS interventions concentrated on the components of service delivery, 
health financing, human resources and quality improvement. Within each 
component, there existed diverse strategies to strengthen health systems. Among 
the 24 studies, 15 were rated as high quality, 5 as medium and 4 as low quality. 
A majority of studies reported cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) 
averted or cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained; other studies 
reported cost per life saved or life year gained. However, studies used mixed 
perspectives of analyses. Compared with gross domestic product per capita, 
interventions in studies reporting cost per DALY averted or QALY gained were all 
cost-effective, including performance-based financing, health insurance and 
quality improvement. This review shows the diversity of HSS interventions in 
improving MCH, and their potential cost-effectiveness. However, the different 
perspectives employed in the studies, costing components included in the 
analyses, and heterogeneous measures of effectiveness and outputs, made it 
challenging to compare cost-effectiveness across all studies, calling for more 
and standardized cost-effectiveness studies. For policy making, it is critical 
to examine long-term cost-effectiveness of programs and cost-effectiveness of 
synergistic demand- and supply-side interventions.

BACKGROUND: In the USA, an epidemic of opioid overdose deaths is occurring, many 
of which are from heroin. Combining naloxone distribution with linkage to 
addiction treatment or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention 
through syringe service programmes has the potential to save lives and be 
cost-effective. We estimated the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of five 
alternative strategies: no additional intervention, naloxone distribution, 
naloxone distribution plus linkage to addiction treatment, naloxone distribution 
plus PrEP, and naloxone distribution plus linkage to addiction treatment and 
PrEP.
METHODS: We developed a decision analytical Markov model to simulate opioid 
overdose, HIV incidence, overdose-related deaths, and HIV-related deaths in 
people who inject drugs in Connecticut, USA. Model input parameters were derived 
from published sources. We compared each strategy with no intervention, as well 
as simultaneously considering all strategies. Sensitivity analysis was done for 
all variables. Linkage to addiction treatment was referral to an opioid 
treatment programme for methadone. Endpoints were survival, life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), number and percentage of overdose deaths 
averted, number of HIV-related deaths averted, total costs (in 2015 US$) 
associated with each strategy, and incremental cost per QALY gained.
FINDINGS: In the base-case analysis, compared with no additional intervention, 
the naloxone distribution strategy yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of $323 per QALY, and naloxone distribution plus linkage to 
addiction treatment was cost saving compared with no additional intervention 
(greater effectiveness and less expensive). The most efficient strategies (ie, 
those conferring the greatest health benefit for a particular budget) were 
naloxone distribution combined with linkage to addiction treatment (cost 
saving), and naloxone distribution combined with PrEP and linkage to addiction 
treatment (ICER $95 337 per QALY) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000. 
In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the combination of naloxone distribution, 
PrEP, and linkage to addiction treatment was the optimal strategy in 37% of 
iterations and the combination of naloxone distribution and linkage to addiction 
treatment was the optimal strategy in 34% of iterations.
INTERPRETATION: Naloxone distribution through syringe service programmes is 
cost-effective compared with syringe distribution alone, but when combined with 
linkage to addiction treatment is cost saving compared with no additional 
services. A strategy that combines naloxone distribution, PrEP, and linkage to 
addiction treatment results in greater health benefits in people who inject 
drugs and is also cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Health outcomes are known to vary at both the country and local 
levels, but trends in mortality across a detailed and comprehensive set of 
causes have not been previously described at a very local level. Life expectancy 
in King County, WA, USA, is in the 95th percentile among all counties in the 
USA. However, little is known about how life expectancy and mortality from 
different causes of death vary at a local, neighbourhood level within this 
county. In this analysis, we estimated life expectancy and cause-specific 
mortality within King County to describe spatial trends, quantify disparities in 
mortality, and assess the contribution of each cause of death to overall 
disparities in all-cause mortality.
METHODS: We applied established so-called garbage code redistribution algorithms 
and small area estimation methods to death registration data for King County to 
estimate life expectancy, cause-specific mortality rates, and years of life lost 
(YLL) rates from 152 causes of death for 397 census tracts from Jan 1, 1990, to 
Dec 31, 2014. We used the cause list developed for the Global Burden of Disease 
2015 study for this analysis. Deaths were tabulated by age group, sex, census 
tract, and cause of death. We used Bayesian mixed-effects regression models to 
estimate mortality overall and from each cause.
FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2014, life expectancy in King County increased by 5·4 
years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 5·0-5·7) among men (from 74·0 years 
[73·7-74·3] to 79·3 years [79·1-79·6]) and by 3·4 years (3·0-3·7) among women 
(from 80·0 years [79·7-80·2] to 83·3 years [83·1-83·5]). In 2014, life 
expectancy ranged from 68·4 years (95% UI 66·9-70·1) to 86·7 years (85·0-88·2) 
for men and from 73·6 years (71·6-75·5) to 88·4 years (86·9-89·9) for women 
among census tracts within King County. Rates of YLL by cause also varied 
substantially among census tracts for each cause of death. Geographical areas 
with relatively high and relatively low YLL rates differed by cause. In general, 
causes of death responsible for more YLLs overall also contributed more 
significantly to geographical inequality within King County. However, certain 
causes contributed more to inequality than to overall YLLs.
INTERPRETATION: This census tract-level analysis of life expectancy and 
cause-specific YLL rates highlights important differences in health among 
neighbourhoods in King County that are masked by county-level estimates. Efforts 
to improve population health in King County should focus on reducing 
geographical inequality, by targeting those health conditions that contribute 
the most to overall YLLs and to inequality. This analysis should be replicated 
in other locations to more fully describe fine-grained local-level variation in 
population health and contribute to efforts to improve health while reducing 
inequalities.

BACKGROUND: No studies have estimated disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) 
lost due to hip fractures using real-life follow-up cohort data. We aimed to 
quantify the burden of disease due to incident hip fracture using DALYs in 
prospective cohorts in the CHANCES consortium, and to calculate population 
attributable fractions based on DALYs for specific risk factors.
METHODS: We used data from six cohorts of participants aged 50 years or older at 
recruitment to calculate DALYs. We applied disability weights proposed by the 
National Osteoporosis Foundation and did a series of sensitivity analyses to 
examine the robustness of DALY estimates. We calculated population attributable 
fractions for smoking, body-mass index (BMI), physical activity, alcohol intake, 
type 2 diabetes and parity, use of hormone replacement therapy, and oral 
contraceptives in women. We calculated summary risk estimates across cohorts 
with pooled analysis and random-effects meta-analysis methods.
FINDINGS: 223 880 men and women were followed up for a mean of 13 years (SD 6). 
7724 (3·5%) participants developed an incident hip fracture, of whom 413 (5·3%) 
died as a result. 5964 DALYs (27 per 1000 individuals) were lost due to hip 
fractures, 1230 (20·6%) of which were in the group aged 75-79 years. 4150 
(69·6%) DALYs were attributed to disability. Current smoking was the risk factor 
responsible for the greatest hip fracture burden (7·5%, 95% CI 5·2-9·7) followed 
by physical inactivity (5·5%, 2·1-8·5), history of diabetes (2·8%, 2·1-4·0), and 
low to average BMI (2·0%, 1·4-2·7), whereas low alcohol consumption (0·01-2·5 g 
per day) and high BMI had a protective effect.
INTERPRETATION: Hip fracture can lead to a substantial loss of healthy 
life-years in elderly people. National public health policies should be 
strengthened to reduce hip fracture incidence and mortality. Primary prevention 
measures should be strengthened to prevent falls, and reduce smoking and a 
sedentary lifestyle.

The coordination of plural logics of action and its consequences: Evidence from 
plural medical systems.

Shim JM(1).

Drawing on the theory of social action in organizational and institutional 
sociology, this paper examines the behavioral consequences of plural logics of 
action. It addresses the question based on the empirical case of plural medical 
systems that are composed of both biomedicine and alternative medicine. Applying 
mixed methods of a cross-national panel data analysis and a content analysis of 
medical journal articles, it finds that plural systems affect health outcomes 
negatively when tensions between biomedicine and alternative medicine are 
unaddressed. In contrast, plural systems produce tangible health benefits when 
biomedicine and alternative medicine are coordinated through government policies 
or by health care organizations/professionals. This paper proposes plurality 
coordination as an important mechanism that modifies the behavioral consequences 
of plural logics. This proposition contributes to providing theoretical answers 
to the sociological puzzle that plural logics of action produce inconsistent 
behavioral consequences.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes treatment includes very diverse drugs. It is essential to 
identify which drugs offer the best value for their costs.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate comparative cost effectiveness for treating diabetes 
mellitus with dulaglutide, liraglutide, or glargine in Colombia.
METHODS: A Markov model including diabetic microvascular and macrovascular 
complications was used to estimate cost-effectiveness. We used annual cycles, a 
5-year time horizon, 5% discount rate, and third-party payer's perspective. Main 
outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Transition probabilities were obtained from 
primary studies and costs from local databases and studies. We used a threshold 
of 3 times the Colombian per capita gross domestic product (US $17,270 for 2015; 
US $1 = 2,743 Columbian pesos) to assess cost effectiveness.
RESULTS: Total costs related to dulaglutide, liraglutide, and glargine were US 
$8,633, US $10,756, and US $5,783, yielding 3.311 QALYs, 3.229 QALYs, and 3.156 
QALYs, respectively. Dulaglutide dominated liraglutide given lower total costs 
and higher QALYs. The estimated ICER for dulaglutide compared with glargine was 
US $18,385, greater than the accepted threshold. Sensibility analysis shows that 
decreased dulaglutide cost, increased consumption of glargine, nondaily 
injection, and number and cost of glucometry could result in ICERs lower than 
the threshold. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed consistent results.
CONCLUSIONS: This estimation indicates that dulaglutide dominates liraglutide. 
Its ICER is, however, greater than the accepted threshold for Colombia in base 
case compared with glargine. By increasing population weight or glargine 
consumption, dulaglutide becomes cost effective compared with glargine, which 
could identify a niche where dulaglutide is the best option.

OBJECTIVES: To conduct an economic evaluation of intracranial pressure (ICP) 
monitoring on the basis of current evidence from pediatric patients with severe 
traumatic brain injury, through a statistical model.
METHODS: The statistical model is a decision tree, whose branches take into 
account the severity of the lesion, the hospitalization costs, and the 
quality-adjusted life-year for the first 6 months post-trauma. The inputs 
consist of probability distributions calculated from a sample of 33 surviving 
children with severe traumatic brain injury, divided into two groups: with ICP 
monitoring (monitoring group) and without ICP monitoring (control group). The 
uncertainty of the parameters from the sample was quantified through a 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis using the Monte-Carlo simulation method. The 
model overcomes the drawbacks of small sample sizes, unequal groups, and the 
ethical difficulty in randomly assigning patients to a control group (without 
monitoring).
RESULTS: The incremental cost in the monitoring group was Mex$3,934 (Mexican 
pesos), with an increase in quality-adjusted life-year of 0.05. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was Mex$81,062. The cost-effectiveness acceptability 
curve had a maximum at 54% of the cost effective iterations. The incremental net 
health benefit for a willingness to pay equal to 1 time the per capita gross 
domestic product for Mexico was 0.03, and the incremental net monetary benefit 
was Mex$5,358.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the model suggest that ICP monitoring is cost 
effective because there was a monetary gain in terms of the incremental net 
monetary benefit.

INTRODUCTION: The U.S. spends more than any other country on health care, yet 
Americans have lower life expectancy than people in most industrialized 
countries. Recent studies suggest that lower expenditures on social policies in 
the U.S. may contribute to less-favorable trends in life expectancy. This study 
tests the hypothesis that greater social spending will be positively associated 
with life expectancy across the countries of the Organisation of Economic 
Co-operation and Development and that the magnitude of these associations will 
outweigh those between government healthcare spending and life expectancy.
METHODS: In 2016, longitudinal data on six domains of social expenditures for 
the U.S. and 19 other wealthy nations between 1980 and 2010 were used to 
estimate the associations between prior year expenditures on education, family, 
unemployment, incapacity, old age, and active labor market programs, and period 
life expectancy using fixed effects models.
RESULTS: Controlling for a wide set of confounders and government healthcare 
expenditures, a 1% increase in prior year education expenditures was associated 
with 0.160 (95% CI=0.033, 0.286) of a year gain in life expectancy, whereas a 1% 
increase in prior year incapacity benefit expenditures was associated with 0.168 
(95% CI=0.003, 0.333) of a year gain in life expectancy. Counterfactual models 
suggest that if the U.S. were to increase expenditures on education and 
incapacity to the levels of the country with the maximum expenditures, life 
expectancy would increase to 80.12 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The U.S. life expectancy lag could be considerably smaller if U.S. 
expenditures on education and incapacity programs were comparable with those in 
other high-income countries.

PURPOSE: Proton therapy can be a highly effective strategy for the treatment of 
tumours. However, compared with X-ray therapy it is more expensive and has 
limited availability. In addition, it is not always clear whether it will 
benefit an individual patient more than a course of traditional X-ray therapy. 
Basing a treatment decision on outcomes of clinical trials can be difficult due 
to a shortage of data. Predictive modelling studies are becoming an attractive 
alternative to supplement clinical decisions. The aim of the current work is to 
present a Markov framework that compares clinical outcomes for proton and X-ray 
therapy.
METHODS: A Markov model has been developed which estimates the radiobiological 
effect of a given treatment plan. This radiobiological effect is estimated using 
the tumour control probability (TCP), normal tissue complication probability 
(NTCP) and second primary cancer induction probability (SPCIP). These metrics 
are used as transition probabilities in the Markov chain. The clinical outcome 
is quantified by the quality adjusted life expectancy. To demonstrate 
functionality, the model was applied to a 6-year-old patient presenting with 
skull base chordoma.
RESULTS: The model was successfully developed to compare clinical outcomes for 
proton and X-ray treatment plans. For the example patient considered, it was 
predicted that proton therapy would offer a significant advantage compared with 
volumetric modulated arc therapy in terms of survival and mitigating injuries.
CONCLUSIONS: The functionality of the model was demonstrated using the example 
patient. The proposed Markov method may be a useful tool for deciding on a 
treatment strategy for individual patients.

Individuals with higher educational attainment live healthier and longer lives. 
However, not everyone benefits equally from higher education. In particular, the 
black-white gap in life expectancy is greater at higher levels of educational 
attainment. Furthermore, recent research suggests that disadvantaged African 
Americans in the rural Southeast who attend college have worse physical health 
than their similarly disadvantaged peers who do not attend college. The extent 
to which this pattern generalizes to a nationally representative, mixed-race 
sample is unknown. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent 
to Adult Health, we test whether the health benefits associated with college 
completion vary by level of childhood disadvantage for depression and metabolic 
syndrome in young adulthood, across race/ethnicity. We find uniform lower 
depression associated with college completion regardless of childhood 
disadvantage, and across non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic 
young adults. College completion is associated with lower metabolic syndrome for 
whites across all levels of childhood disadvantage. In contrast, college 
completion is associated with higher metabolic syndrome among black and Hispanic 
young adults from disadvantaged childhood environments. Our findings suggest 
that, for minorities from disadvantaged backgrounds, finishing college pays 
substantial dividends for mental health but simultaneously exacts costs with 
regard to physical health. This pattern contrasts starkly with whites and 
minorities from more privileged backgrounds, for whom college completion is 
associated with benefits to both mental and physical health. These results 
suggest that racial disparities in health may persist in part because the health 
of upwardly mobile minorities is compromised in young adulthood.

Whole cell responses arise from coordinated interactions between diverse human 
gene products functioning within various pathways underlying sub-cellular 
processes (SCP). Lower level SCPs interact to form higher level SCPs, often in a 
context specific manner to give rise to whole cell function. We sought to 
determine if capturing such relationships enables us to describe the emergence 
of whole cell functions from interacting SCPs. We developed the Molecular 
Biology of the Cell Ontology based on standard cell biology and biochemistry 
textbooks and review articles. Currently, our ontology contains 5,384 genes, 753 
SCPs and 19,180 expertly curated gene-SCP associations. Our algorithm to 
populate the SCPs with genes enables extension of the ontology on demand and the 
adaption of the ontology to the continuously growing cell biological knowledge. 
Since whole cell responses most often arise from the coordinated activity of 
multiple SCPs, we developed a dynamic enrichment algorithm that flexibly 
predicts SCP-SCP relationships beyond the current taxonomy. This algorithm 
enables us to identify interactions between SCPs as a basis for higher order 
function in a context dependent manner, allowing us to provide a detailed 
description of how SCPs together can give rise to whole cell functions. We 
conclude that this ontology can, from omics data sets, enable the development of 
detailed SCP networks for predictive modeling of emergent whole cell functions.

Adenosine Receptors As Drug Targets for Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial 
Hypertension.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a clinical condition characterized by 
pulmonary arterial remodeling and vasoconstriction, which promote chronic vessel 
obstruction and elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance. Long-term right 
ventricular (RV) overload leads to RV dysfunction and failure, which are the 
main determinants of life expectancy in PAH subjects. Therapeutic options for 
PAH remain limited, despite the introduction of prostacyclin analogs, endothelin 
receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and soluble guanylyl 
cyclase stimulators within the last 15 years. Through addressing the pulmonary 
endothelial and smooth muscle cell dysfunctions associated with PAH, these 
interventions delay disease progression but do not offer a cure. Emerging 
approaches to improve treatment efficacy have focused on beneficial actions to 
both the pulmonary vasculature and myocardium, and several new targets have been 
investigated and validated in experimental PAH models. Herein, we review the 
effects of adenosine and adenosine receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) on the 
cardiovascular system, focusing on the A2A receptor as a pharmacological target. 
This receptor induces pulmonary vascular and heart protection in experimental 
models, specifically models of PAH. Targeting the A2A receptor could potentially 
serve as a novel and efficient approach for treating PAH and concomitant RV 
failure. A2A receptor activation induces pulmonary endothelial nitric oxide 
synthesis, smooth muscle cell hyperpolarization, and vasodilation, with 
important antiproliferative activities through the inhibition of collagen 
deposition and vessel wall remodeling in the pulmonary arterioles. The 
pleiotropic potential of A2A receptor activation is highlighted by its 
additional expression in the heart tissue, where it participates in the 
regulation of intracellular calcium handling and maintenance of heart chamber 
structure and function. In this way, the activation of A2A receptor could 
prevent the production of a hypertrophic and dysfunctional phenotype in animal 
models of cardiovascular diseases.

Probabilistic population projections for countries with generalized HIV/AIDS 
epidemics.

In 2015, the United Nations (UN) issued probabilistic population projections for 
all countries up to 2100, by simulating future levels of total fertility and 
life expectancy and combining the results using a standard cohort component 
projection method. For the 40 countries with generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics, the 
mortality projections used the Spectrum/Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) 
model, a complex, multistate model designed for short-term projections of 
policy-relevant quantities for the epidemic. We propose a simpler approach that 
is more compatible with existing UN projection methods for other countries. 
Changes in life expectancy are projected probabilistically using a simple time 
series regression and then converted to age- and sex-specific mortality rates 
using model life tables designed for countries with HIV/AIDS epidemics. These 
are then input to the cohort component method, as for other countries. The 
method performed well in an out-of-sample cross-validation experiment. It gives 
similar short-run projections to Spectrum/EPP, while being simpler and avoiding 
multistate modelling.

Graft and mesh use in vaginal surgery.

Rizvi RM(1), Chughtai NG(1).

Pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence are among the most common chronic 
disorders in women. These are common problems whose pathogenesis remains 
unclear. As life expectancy increases, significantly greater number of women now 
present with pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence requiring surgical 
intervention. Currently, the lifetime risk of undergoing prolapse or continence 
surgery is one in 11, and up to 30% of patients will require repeat 
reconstructive surgery and repeat surgery for incontinence in 10%. In an attempt 
to improve surgical outcomes and to preserve vaginal capacity and coital 
function, a number of synthetic and biological prostheses have been developed. 
This review aims to look at the role of graft and mesh in vaginal surgery. We 
conducted a search for English-language articles published during 1997 to 2016, 
using MEDLINE, PubMed and United States' National Library of Medicine databases. 
We reviewed around 50 papers but referenced only 30 for this article. The 
literature review provided us a new insight regarding safety of mesh. 
Polypropylene mesh is safe for vaginal surgery if used by experienced surgeons. 
The safety of mesh becomes compromised in the hands of commercial surgical kit 
providers. All the new mesh tailored kits should undergo evidence-based trials 
and then can be safely used worldwide.

For patients with end-stage lung diseases, lung transplant may significantly 
extend survival and improve quality of life. Identifying patients that are 
likely to benefit from a lung transplant is essential to positive outcomes and 
to maximizing life expectancy for each patient. Prompt referral to and 
communication with an experienced lung transplant center allows for timely 
completion of the formal evaluation of candidacy and placement on the organ 
transplant waiting list. This article summarizes the selection criteria for lung 
transplant candidates, including when physicians should refer patients to 
transplant centers for evaluation and placement on the lung transplant waiting 
list.

[Medicaments and oral healthcare 6. Oral side effects of -medications commonly 
used by older people].

[Article in Dutch; Abstract available in Dutch from the publisher]

Bakker MH, Vissink A, de Baat C, Visser A.

In the coming decades the western world will experience a double ageing of its 
population; there will be an increase in both the number of older people and the 
average age. The increase in life expectancy will also mean more and more older 
people who suffer from multiple systemic diseases that are treated with 
medications. At this moment, 45% of those over 65 use 5 or more medications and 
20% of those over 75 use as many as 10 or more. The more medications used, the 
greater the risk of side effects and therefore oral side effects, like symptoms 
of dry mouth or the development of candidiasis, angioedema, gingival 
hyperplasia, lichenoid reaction of the oral mucosa, dysgeusia, halitosis and 
osteonecrosis. Considering the wide range of oral side effects, it is important 
for dentists to be well aware of the medications being used by older patients as 
well as having a thorough knowledge of their oral side effects.

Publisher: De komende decennia is in de westerse wereld sprake van een dubbele 
vergrijzing. Dit houdt in dat zowel het aantal ouderen als de gemiddelde 
leeftijd toeneemt. De toegenomen levensverwachting betekent tevens steeds meer 
ouderen die lijden aan een of meerdere systemische ziekten waarvoor medicamenten 
worden gebruikt. Op dit moment gebruikt 45% van de 65-plussers 5 of meer 
medicamenten en 20% van de 75-plussers zelfs 10 of meer medicamenten. Hoe meer 
medicamenten worden gebruikt, des te groter is de kans op bijwerkingen en dus 
ook orale bijwerkingen, zoals het gevoel van een droge mond of het ontwikkelen 
van candidose, angio-oedeem, hyperplasie van de gingiva, lichenoïde reactie van 
het orale slijmvlies, smaakstoornissen, halitose en osteonecrose. Gezien het 
brede scala aan orale bijwerkingen, is het voor tandartsen van belang om een 
goed inzicht te hebben in de medicamenten die ouderen gebruiken en kennis te 
hebben van de daarbij behorende (orale) bijwerkingen.
