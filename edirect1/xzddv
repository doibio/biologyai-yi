BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of esophageal cancer (EC) can elucidate its causes 
and risk factors and help develop prevention strategies. We aimed to provide an 
overview of the burden, trends, and risk factors of EC in China from 1990 to 
2017. We also investigated the differences between China, Japan, and South Korea 
and discussed the possible causes of the disparities.
METHODS: We used the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 to obtain data on 
incident cases, deaths, disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) cases, 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized death rate (ASDR), and 
age-standardized DALY rate of EC in China, Japan, and South Korea from 1990 to 
2017. Trend analysis was performed using joinpoint analysis. We measured the 
associations between ASIR, ASDR, and age-standardized DALY rate and the 
socio-demographic index (SDI) for 1990-2017. We also analyzed the risk factors 
associated with EC deaths and DALYs.
RESULTS: China recorded 234,624 (95% uncertainty intervals: 223,240-246,036) 
incident cases of and 212,586 (202,673-222,654) deaths from EC in 2017. The ASIR 
and ASDR declined from 1990 to 2017. Until 2017, the ASIR was 12.23, and ASDR 
was 11.25 per 100,000 persons. The DALYs were 4,464,980 (4,247,816-4,690,846) 
with an age-standardized rate of 222.58 per 100,000 persons in 2017. The ASIR, 
ASDR, and age-standardized DALY rate in China were twice those of Japan and 
South Korea. These three indicators showed a decreasing trend, whereas SDI 
increased, in all three countries from 1990 to 2017. Tobacco and alcohol use 
remained the major risk factors for EC death and DALYs, especially for men in 
China and women in Japan and South Korea. High body mass index (BMI) and 
low-fruit diet were the main risk factors for women in China.
CONCLUSIONS: The incident cases and deaths of EC in China, Japan, and South 
Korea increased from 1990 to 2017, whereas the ASIR, ASDR, and age-standardized 
DALY rate declined. China had the greatest burden of EC among three countries. 
SDI and aging along with tobacco use, alcohol use, high BMI, and low-fruit diet 
were the main risk factors of death and DALYs and should be paid more attention.

Life expectancy in most developed countries has been rising over the past 
century. In the UK alone, there are about 12 million people over 65 years old 
and centenarians have increased by 85% in the past 15 years. As a result of the 
ageing population, which is due mainly to improvements in medical treatments, 
public health, improved housing and lifestyle choices, there is an associated 
increase in the prevalence of pathological conditions, such as metabolic 
disorders, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, many 
types of cancer and others. Statistics suggest that nearly 54% of elderly people 
in the UK live with at least two chronic conditions, revealing the urgency for 
identifying interventions that can prevent and/or treat such disorders. 
Non-pharmacological, dietary interventions such as energetic restriction (ER) 
and methionine restriction (MR) have revealed promising outcomes in increasing 
longevity and preventing and/or reversing the development of ageing-associated 
disorders. In this review, we discuss the evidence and mechanisms that are 
involved in these processes. Fibroblast growth factor 1 and hydrogen sulphide 
are important molecules involved in the effects of ER and MR in the extension of 
life span. Their role is also associated with the prevention of metabolic and 
cognitive disorders, highlighting these interventions as promising modulators 
for improvement of health span.

Species invasion is an important cause of global biodiversity decline and is 
often mediated by shifts in environmental conditions such as climate change. To 
investigate this relationship, a mechanistic Dynamic Energy Budget model (DEB) 
approach was used to predict how climate change may affect spread of the 
invasive mussel Mytilopsis sallei, by predicting variation in the total 
reproductive output of the mussel under different scenarios. To achieve this, 
the DEB model was forced with present-day satellite data of sea surface 
temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), and SST under two 
warming RCP scenarios and decreasing current Chl-a levels, to predict future 
responses. Under both warming scenarios, the DEB model predicted the 
reproductive output of M. sallei would enhance range extension of the mussel, 
especially in regions south of the Yangtze River when future declines in Chl-a 
were reduced by less than 10%, whereas egg production was inhibited when Chl-a 
decreased by 20-30%. The decrease in SST in the Yangtze River may, however, be a 
natural barrier to the northward expansion of M. sallei, with colder 
temperatures resulting in a strong decrease in egg production. Although the 
invasion path of M. sallei may be inhibited northwards by the Yangtze River, 
larger geographic regions south of the Yangtze River run the risk of invasion, 
with subsequent negative impacts on aquaculture through competition for food 
with farmed bivalves and damaging aquaculture facilities. Using a DEB model 
approach to characterise the life history traits of M. sallei, therefore, 
revealed the importance of food availability and temperature on the reproductive 
output of this mussel and allowed evaluation of the invasion risk for specific 
regions. DEB is, therefore, a powerful predictive tool for risk management of 
already established invasive populations and to identify regions with a high 
potential invasion risk.

Goldfish have been subjected to over 1,000 y of intensive domestication and 
selective breeding. In this report, we describe a high-quality goldfish genome 
(2n = 100), anchoring 95.75% of contigs into 50 pseudochromosomes. Comparative 
genomics enabled us to disentangle the two subgenomes that resulted from an 
ancient hybridization event. Resequencing 185 representative goldfish variants 
and 16 wild crucian carp revealed the origin of goldfish and identified genomic 
regions that have been shaped by selective sweeps linked to its domestication. 
Our comprehensive collection of goldfish varieties enabled us to associate 
genetic variations with a number of well-known anatomical features, including 
features that distinguish traditional goldfish clades. Additionally, we 
identified a tyrosine-protein kinase receptor as a candidate causal gene for the 
first well-known case of Mendelian inheritance in goldfish-the transparent 
mutant. The goldfish genome and diversity data offer unique resources to make 
goldfish a promising model for functional genomics, as well as domestication.

The continuous increase in life expectancy results in a steady increase of 
cancer risk, which consequently increases the population of older adults with 
cancer. Older adults have their age-related nutritional needs and often suffer 
from comorbidities that may affect cancer therapy. They frequently are 
malnourished and present advanced-stage cancer. Therefore, this group of 
patients requires a special multidisciplinary approach to optimize their therapy 
and increase quality of life impaired by aging, cancer, and the side effects of 
therapy. Evaluation strategies, taking advantage of comprehensive geriatric 
assessment tools, including the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), can 
help individualize treatment. As epigenetics, an emerging element of the 
regulation of gene expression, is involved in both aging and cancer and the 
epigenetic profile can be modulated by the diet, it seems to be a candidate to 
assist with planning a nutritional intervention in elderly populations with 
cancer. In this review, we present problems associated with the diet and 
nutrition in the elderly undergoing active cancer therapy and provide some 
information on epigenetic aspects of aging and cancer transformation. 
Nutritional interventions modulating the epigenetic profile, including caloric 
restriction and basal diet with modifications (elimination diet, supplementary 
diet) are discussed as the ways to improve the efficacy of cancer therapy and 
maintain the quality of life of older adults with cancer.

Nutrition Management in Older Adults with Diabetes: A Review on the Importance 
of Shifting Prevention Strategies from Metabolic Syndrome to Frailty.

Geriatric Hospital, 35-2 Sakae-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-0015, Japan.

The increasing prevalence of older adults with diabetes has become a major 
social burden. Diabetes, frailty, and cognitive dysfunction are closely related 
to the mechanisms of aging. Insulin resistance, arteriosclerosis, chronic 
inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction may be common 
mechanisms shared by frailty and cognitive impairment. Hyperglycemia, 
hypoglycemia, obesity, vascular factors, physical inactivity, and malnutrition 
are important risk factors for cognitive impairment and frailty in older adults 
with diabetes. The impact of nutrients on health outcomes varies with age; thus, 
shifting diet therapy strategies from the treatment of obesity/metabolic 
syndrome to frailty prevention may be necessary in patients with diabetes who 
are over 75 years of age, have frailty or sarcopenia, and experience 
malnutrition. For the prevention of frailty, optimal energy intake, sufficient 
protein and vitamin intake, and healthy dietary patterns should be recommended. 
The treatment of diabetes after middle age should include the awareness of 
proper glycemic control aimed at extending healthy life expectancy with proper 
nutrition, exercise, and social connectivity. Nutritional therapy in combination 
with exercise, optimal glycemic and metabolic control, and social 
participation/support for frailty prevention can extend healthy life expectancy 
and maintain quality of life in older adults with diabetes mellitus.

The motion of the Italian National Bioethics Committee entitled "Aggressive 
treatment or therapeutic obstinacy on young children with limited life 
expectancy" comprises a premise that rejects therapeutic obstinacy and makes 12 
recommendations. Recommendation no. 1 states the general rules: it ascribes a 
cardinal role to a shared care plan, it supports pain management therapy and 
pain relief, it opposes ineffective and disproportionate clinical treatment and 
defensive medicine. The other recommendations are correlated to the enacting of 
a national law establishing clinical ethics committees in paediatric hospitals; 
participation of parents and their fiduciaries in the decision-making processes; 
recourse to courts only as extrema ratio in the event of irremediable 
disagreement between the medical team and the family members; accompaniment at 
the end of life also through continuous deep sedation combined with pain 
therapy; access to palliative care; the need to reinforce research on pain and 
suffering in children; clinical trials and research studies conducted in 
children; the training of doctors, healthcare personnel and psychologists, to 
support parents in emotional and practical terms; the facilitation of the 
closeness of parents to children in extremely precarious clinical conditions; 
the relevant role of the associations of parents of sick children. Comments are 
made, in particular, about the innovative recommendations respectively relating 
to the adoption of care planning, the establishment, by law, of clinical ethics 
committees in paediatric hospitals and the limitation of recourse to courts-only 
as extrema ratio-in the event of irremediable disagreement between the medical 
team and the family members.

Current clinical trials are testing the life-extending benefits of the diabetes 
drug metformin in healthy individuals without diabetes. However, the metabolic 
response of a non-diabetic cohort to metformin treatment has not been studied. 
Here, we show in C. elegans and human primary cells that metformin shortens 
lifespan when provided in late life, contrary to its positive effects in young 
organisms. We find that metformin exacerbates ageing-associated mitochondrial 
dysfunction, causing respiratory failure. Age-related failure to induce 
glycolysis and activate the dietary-restriction-like mobilization of lipid 
reserves in response to metformin result in lethal ATP exhaustion in 
metformin-treated aged worms and late-passage human cells, which can be rescued 
by ectopic stabilization of cellular ATP content. Metformin toxicity is 
alleviated in worms harbouring disruptions in insulin-receptor signalling, which 
show enhanced resilience to mitochondrial distortions at old age. Together, our 
data show that metformin induces deleterious changes of conserved metabolic 
pathways in late life, which could bring into question its benefits for older 
individuals without diabetes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In the REFLECT trial, lenvatinib showed superior 
clinical benefits to sorafenib in terms of progression-free survival and was 
non-inferior for overall survival in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of lenvatinib compared with 
sorafenib for patients with advanced HCC in Australia.
METHOD: A partitioned-survival model was built to perform a cost-effectiveness 
analysis comparing lenvatinib and sorafenib from an Australian health-system 
perspective. Survival curves were obtained from the REFLECT trial and fitted 
with parametric survival functions for extrapolation purposes beyond the trial 
follow-up. Cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were accrued over the 
10-year time horizon of the model. Deterministic and probability sensitivity 
analysis (PSA) were carried out to verify the validity of the model.
RESULTS: Lenvatinib incurred higher costs (A$96,325) and superior health 
outcomes (QALYs: 1.205), while sorafenib had lower costs (A$92,394) and inferior 
health outcomes (QALYs: 1.086). Thus, lenvatinib yielded an incremental 
cost-utility ratio of A$33,028/QALY gained. Further, the results of the PSA 
found that the probability of lenvatinib being cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of A$50,000/QALY was 64%.
CONCLUSION: Our study found that, at current prices, lenvatinib is a 
cost-effective treatment option compared with sorafenib for the first-line 
treatment of patients with advanced HCC.

BACKGROUND: Rare genetic variations in the leptin-melanocortin signalling 
pathway can severely impair appetite regulation and cause extreme obesity in 
early childhood.
CASE PRESENTATION: Our case reports describe the diagnostic and therapeutic 
procedures in a girl as well as in a non-related boy of non-consanguineous, 
German parents with severe early-onset obesity, pronounced hyperphagia, and 
permanent food-seeking behaviour. Excessive weight gain within the first year of 
life initiated extensive diagnostics without finding a causal diagnosis. 
Furthermore, a wide range of intensive, interdisciplinary, and behavioural 
therapies for weight control were unsuccessful. Prior to bariatric surgery, the 
18-year-old girl and the 14-year-old boy reached a BMI of 67.7 kg/m2 and 
55.2 kg/m2, respectively. However, even surgical outcomes were unsatisfactory. A 
subsequently initiated genetic analysis including sequencing of the leptin 
receptor gene revealed compound heterozygous variants as a cause of the severe 
early-onset obesity in both patients (c.2598-3_2607delTAGAATGAAAAAG and 
c.2227 T>C; c.1874G>A and c.2051A>C). Both patients were enrolled in the 
clinical study RM-493-015 and treated with melanocortin receptor agonist 
setmelanotide. Currently, they are still on setmelanotide treatment in the 
extension trial RM-493-022.
CONCLUSION: Our case report illustrates the urgent necessity of early genetic 
diagnostics in children with severe early-onset obesity to avoid frustrating and 
potentially damaging therapies. Thus, genetic examination should precede 
bariatric surgery. In the future, several pharmacological therapies will be 
available for some forms of monogenetic obesity.

INTRODUCTION: After endoscopic resection (ER) of neoplasia in Barrett's 
esophagus (BE), it is recommended to ablate the remaining BE to minimize the 
risk for metachronous disease. However, we report long-term outcomes for a 
nationwide cohort of all patients who did not undergo ablation of the remaining 
BE after ER for early BE neoplasia, due to clinical reasons or performance 
status.
METHODS: Endoscopic therapy for BE neoplasia in the Netherlands is centralized 
in 8 expert centers with specifically trained endoscopists and pathologists. 
Uniformity is ensured by a joint protocol and regular group meetings. We report 
all patients who underwent ER for a neoplastic lesion between 2008 and 2018, 
without further ablation therapy. Outcomes include progression during endoscopic 
FU and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Ninety-four patients were included with mean age 74 (± 10) years. ER 
was performed for low-grade dysplasia (LGD) (10%), high-grade dysplasia (HGD) 
(25%), or low-risk esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) (65%). No additional ablation 
was performed for several reasons; in 73 patients (78%), the main argument was 
expected limited life expectancy. Median C2M5 BE persisted after ER, and during 
median 21 months (IQR 11-51) with 4 endoscopies per patient, no patient 
progressed to advanced cancer. Seventeen patients (18%) developed HGD/EAC: all 
were curatively treated endoscopically. In total, 29/73 patients (40%) with 
expected limited life expectancy died due to unrelated causes during FU, none of 
EAC.
CONCLUSION: In selected patients, ER monotherapy with endoscopic surveillance of 
the residual BE is a valid alternative to eradication therapy with ablation.

BACKGROUND: At Canadian Blood Services, platelet concentrate (PC) shelf life was 
extended to 7 days with a large-volume, delayed-sampling bacterial screening 
algorithm. We present the development study and postimplementation results.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In the development study, PCs inoculated with five 
bacteria (various concentrations) were incubated for 7 days with daily sampling 
for BacT/ALERT cultures and bacterial quantification. After implementation, from 
August 2017 to December 2019, a total of 223 156 pools and 39 725 apheresis 
units and 5310 outdated PCs were screened. Since March 2018, cocomponents 
associated to false-positive results have been released to inventory.
RESULTS: In the development study, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, 
and Staphylococcus aureus were detected at concentrations of at least 
0.01 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL at 24 hours postinoculation. However, 
Staphylococcus epidermidis was detected at concentrations of less than 
0.16 CFUs/mL only more than 48 hours postinoculation. After implementation, 776 
(0.35%) and 303 (0.77%) initial-positive results and 201 (0.09%) and 16 (0.04%) 
confirmed-positive results were obtained for pools and apheresis units, 
respectively, predominantly with Cutibacterium acnes. Other organisms included 
staphylococci, streptococci, Klebsiella oxytoca and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One 
nonfatal reaction involving a 7-day pool contaminated with S. epidermidis 
occurred. Approximately, 1-in-1000 false-negative screening results were 
obtained during testing of outdated PCs. Approximately 1000 cocomponents 
associated with false-positive results were released into inventory. Combined PC 
outdating at Canadian Blood Services and hospitals was reduced from 18.9% to 
13.1%.
CONCLUSION: Screening of 7-day PCs increased bacterial detection mainly of 
anaerobes and reduced outdating. The incidence of septic transfusion events has 
decreased approximately threefold. A longer surveillance period is needed to 
evaluate the value of anaerobic cultures and residual safety risk.

BACKGROUND: Loss of arm function is common after stroke. Robot-assisted training 
may improve arm outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to determine the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted training, compared with an enhanced upper 
limb therapy programme and with usual care.
DESIGN: This was a pragmatic, observer-blind, multicentre randomised controlled 
trial with embedded health economic and process evaluations.
SETTING: The trial was set in four NHS trial centres.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with moderate or severe upper limb functional limitation, 
between 1 week and 5 years following first stroke, were recruited.
INTERVENTIONS: Robot-assisted training using the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology-Manus robotic gym system (InMotion commercial version, Interactive 
Motion Technologies, Inc., Watertown, MA, USA), an enhanced upper limb therapy 
programme comprising repetitive functional task practice, and usual care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was upper limb functional recovery 
'success' (assessed using the Action Research Arm Test) at 3 months. Secondary 
outcomes at 3 and 6 months were the Action Research Arm Test results, upper limb 
impairment (measured using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment), activities of daily 
living (measured using the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index), quality of 
life (measured using the Stroke Impact Scale), resource use costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years.
RESULTS: A total of 770 participants were randomised (robot-assisted training, 
n = 257; enhanced upper limb therapy, n = 259; usual care, n = 254). Upper limb 
functional recovery 'success' was achieved in the robot-assisted training 
[103/232 (44%)], enhanced upper limb therapy [118/234 (50%)] and usual care 
groups [85/203 (42%)]. These differences were not statistically significant; the 
adjusted odds ratios were as follows: robot-assisted training versus usual care, 
1.2 (98.33% confidence interval 0.7 to 2.0); enhanced upper limb therapy versus 
usual care, 1.5 (98.33% confidence interval 0.9 to 2.5); and robot-assisted 
training versus enhanced upper limb therapy, 0.8 (98.33% confidence interval 0.5 
to 1.3). The robot-assisted training group had less upper limb impairment (as 
measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment motor subscale) than the usual care group 
at 3 and 6 months. The enhanced upper limb therapy group had less upper limb 
impairment (as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment motor subscale), better 
mobility (as measured by the Stroke Impact Scale mobility domain) and better 
performance in activities of daily living (as measured by the Stroke Impact 
Scale activities of daily living domain) than the usual care group, at 3 months. 
The robot-assisted training group performed less well in activities of daily 
living (as measured by the Stroke Impact Scale activities of daily living 
domain) than the enhanced upper limb therapy group at 3 months. No other 
differences were clinically important and statistically significant. 
Participants found the robot-assisted training and the enhanced upper limb 
therapy group programmes acceptable. Neither intervention, as provided in this 
trial, was cost-effective at current National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence willingness-to-pay thresholds for a quality-adjusted life-year.
CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted training did not improve upper limb function 
compared with usual care. Although robot-assisted training improved upper limb 
impairment, this did not translate into improvements in other outcomes. Enhanced 
upper limb therapy resulted in potentially important improvements on upper limb 
impairment, in performance of activities of daily living, and in mobility. 
Neither intervention was cost-effective.
FUTURE WORK: Further research is needed to find ways to translate the 
improvements in upper limb impairment seen with robot-assisted training into 
improvements in upper limb function and activities of daily living. Innovations 
to make rehabilitation programmes more cost-effective are required.
LIMITATIONS: Pragmatic inclusion criteria led to the recruitment of some 
participants with little prospect of recovery. The attrition rate was higher in 
the usual care group than in the robot-assisted training or enhanced upper limb 
therapy groups, and differential attrition is a potential source of bias. 
Obtaining accurate information about the usual care that participants were 
receiving was a challenge.

Plain Language Summary: Many people who have arm weakness following a stroke 
feel that insufficient attention is paid by rehabilitation services to recovery 
of their arm. Unfortunately, it is currently unclear how best to provide 
rehabilitation to optimise recovery, but robot-assisted training and therapy 
programmes that focus on practising functional tasks are promising and require 
further evaluation. The Robot-Assisted Training for the Upper Limb after Stroke 
(RATULS) trial evaluated three approaches to rehabilitation for people with 
moderate or severe difficulty using their arm. These approaches were 
robot-assisted training using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Manus 
robotic gym system (InMotion commercial version, Interactive Motion 
Technologies, Inc., Watertown, MA, USA), an enhanced upper limb therapy 
programme based on repetitive practice of functional tasks and usual care. 
Robot-assisted training and the enhanced upper limb therapy programme were 
provided in an outpatient setting for 45 minutes per session, three times per 
week, for 12 weeks, in addition to usual care. The Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology-Manus robotic gym system was selected as it was felt to be the best 
available technology. The participant sits at a table, places their affected arm 
onto the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Manus arm support and attempts to 
move their arm to play a game on the computer screen. Movements are assisted by 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Manus if the patient cannot perform 
the movements themselves. The results of the RATULS trial show that 
robot-assisted training did not result in additional improvement in stroke 
survivors’ arm use when compared with the enhanced upper limb therapy programme 
or usual care. Stroke survivors who received enhanced upper limb therapy 
experienced meaningful improvements in undertaking activities of daily living, 
when compared with those participants who received either robot-assisted 
training or usual care. Participants who received enhanced upper limb therapy 
also experienced benefits in their mobility, compared with usual care 
participants. Participants and therapists found both therapies acceptable, and 
described various benefits. A health economic analysis found that neither 
robot-assisted training nor the enhanced upper limb therapy programme was a 
cost-effective treatment for the NHS.

Recipients of Medical Aid, a government-funded social assistance program for the 
poor, have a shorter life expectancy than National Health Insurance 
beneficiaries in Korea. This study aims to explore the contributions of age and 
major causes of death to the life expectancy difference between the two groups. 
We used the National Health Information Database provided by the National Health 
Insurance Service individually linked to mortality registration data of 
Statistics Korea between 2008 and 2017. Annual abridged life tables were 
constructed and Arriaga's life expectancy decomposition method was employed to 
estimate age- and cause-specific contributions to the life expectancy gap 
between National Health Insurance beneficiaries and Medical Aid recipients. The 
life expectancy difference between National Health Insurance beneficiaries and 
Medical Aid recipients was 14.5 years during the period of 2008-2017. The age 
groups between 30 and 64 years accounted for 78.7% and 67.5% of the total life 
expectancy gap in men and women, respectively. Cancer was the leading cause of 
death contributing to excess mortality among Medical Aid recipients compared to 
National Health Insurance beneficiaries. More specifically, alcohol-attributable 
deaths (such as alcoholic liver disease, liver cancer, liver cirrhosis, and 
alcohol/substance abuse), suicide, and cardiometabolic risk factor-related 
deaths (such as cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes) 
were the leading contributors to the life expectancy gap. To decrease excess 
deaths in Medical Aid recipients and reduce health inequalities, effective 
policies for tobacco and alcohol regulation, suicide prevention, and 
interventions to address cardiometabolic risk factors are needed.

Obesity is currently considered a major source of morbidity, with dramatic 
complications on health status and life expectancy. Several studies demonstrated 
the positive effects of Brassicaceae vegetables on obesity and related diseases, 
partially attributing these beneficial properties to glucosinolates and their 
derivatives isothiocyanates. Recently, isothiocyanates have been described as a 
hydrogen sulfide (H2 S)-releasing moiety, suggesting that H2 S may be at least 
in part responsible for the beneficial effects of Brassicaceae. In this work, 
the metabolic effects of an extract obtained from Eruca sativa Mill. seeds 
(E.S., Brassicaceae), containing high levels of glucoerucin, were evaluated in 
an experimental model of obesity. Male balb/c mice were fed for 10 weeks with 
standard (Std) diet or high fat (HF) diet supplemented with E.S. E.S. 
significantly contained the body weight gain in this obesity model, improving 
also glucose homeostasis. Interestingly, lower values of white adipose tissue 
mass and a significant reduction of adipocytes size were also observed. 
Moreover, E.S. enhanced the adipocytes metabolism, improving the citrate 
synthase activity and reduced triglyceride levels in mice fed with HF diet. 
Taken together, these results suggest that E.S. is endowed with an interesting 
translational and nutraceutical value in the prevention of metabolic disorders, 
suggesting that H2 S could be a key player.

A consistent finding from contemporary Western societies is that women outlive 
men. However, what is unclear is whether sex differences in survival are 
constant across varying socio-ecological conditions. We test the universality of 
the female survival advantage with mortality data from a nineteenth century 
population in the Baja California peninsula of Mexico. When examined simply, we 
find evidence for a male-biased survival advantage. However, results from Cox 
regression clearly show the importance of age intervals for variable survival 
patterns by sex. Our key findings are that males: (i) experience significantly 
lower mortality risk than females during the ages 15-30 (RR = 0.69), (ii) are at 
a significantly increased risk of dying in the 61+ category (RR = 1.30) and 
(iii) do not experience significantly different mortality risk at any other age 
interval (0-14, 31-45, 46-60). We interpret our results to stem from differing 
intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for sex-biased mortality across age 
intervals, highlighting the relevance of a lifecourse approach to the study of 
survival advantage. Ultimately, our results make clear the need to more broadly 
consider variability in mortality risk factors across time and place to allow 
for a clearer understanding of human survival differences.

The running single-leg jump (RSLJ), including certain non-extension movements 
(movements not induced by lower-limb extension works), is the highest jumping 
mode in humans. Here, we show the substantial contributions of non-extension 
movements, in generating mechanical energy directly contributing to the jumping 
height (Evert) in RSLJ. We determined the component of increase in Evert due to 
each segment movement in RSLJs by 13 male high-jumpers. The stance-leg shank 
forward rotation (rotation opposite to the actions of the knee extensors and 
ankle plantar flexors on the shank), increased Evert (0.76 ± 0.70 J/kg). Evert 
due to the stance-leg thigh forward rotation (4.39 ± 0.57 J/kg) was 
substantially larger than the inflowing energy into the thigh (difference: 
2.36 ± 0.42 J/kg). These results suggest that the forward rotations of the shank 
and thigh transformed horizontal kinetic energy (Ehori) to Evert.Evert was 
increased by the elevation of the free-leg side of the pelvis (0.53 ± 0.22 J/kg) 
and rotation of free-leg thigh (1.52 ± 0.26 J/kg). The non-extension movements 
contributed to over half (59 ± 6%) the increase in Evert during the take-off 
phase. Human-specific morphologies are essential for the contributions of 
non-extension movements; fully extensible knee joints and relatively longer legs 
with respect to body mass for the transformation from Ehori to Evert by shank 
and thigh rotations, and a wide and short pelvis for increasing Evert by pelvic 
elevation. This study provides quantifiable evidence to indicate how 
substantially non-extension movements contribute to higher RSLJ.

OBJECTIVES: To develop and test the performance of computerized ultrasound image 
analysis using deep neural networks (DNNs) in discriminating between benign and 
malignant ovarian tumors and to compare its diagnostic accuracy with that of 
subjective assessment (SA) by an ultrasound expert.
METHODS: We included 3077 (grayscale, n = 1927; power Doppler, n = 1150) 
ultrasound images from 758 women with ovarian tumors, who were classified 
prospectively by expert ultrasound examiners according to IOTA (International 
Ovarian Tumor Analysis) terms and definitions. Histological outcome from surgery
