BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic resection (ER) is an efficacious treatment for 
complex colon polyps (CCPs). Many patients are referred for surgical resection 
because of concerns over procedural safety, incomplete polyp resection, and 
adenoma recurrence after ER. Efficacy data for both resection strategies are 
widely available, but a paucity of data exist on the cost-effectiveness of each 
modality. The aim of this study was to perform an economic analysis comparing ER 
and laparoscopic resection (LR) strategies in patients with CCP.
METHODS: A decision analysis tree was constructed using decision analysis 
software. The 2 strategies (ER vs LR) were evaluated in a hypothetical cohort of 
patients with CCPs. A hybrid Markov model with a 10-year time horizon was used. 
Patients entered the model after colonoscopic diagnosis at age 50. Under 
Strategy I, patients underwent ER followed by surveillance colonoscopy at 3 to 6 
months and 12 months. Patients with failed ER and residual adenoma at 12 months 
were referred for LR. Under Strategy II, patients underwent LR as primary 
treatment. Patients with invasive cancer were excluded. Estimates regarding ER 
performance characteristics were obtained from a systematic review of published 
literature. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (2012-2013) and the 
2012 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project databases were used to determine 
the costs and loss of utility. We assumed that all procedures were performed 
with anesthesia support, and patients with adverse events in both strategies 
required inpatient hospitalization. Baseline estimates and costs were varied by 
using a sensitivity analysis through the ranges.
RESULTS: LR was found to be more costly and yielded fewer quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) compared with ER. The cost of ER of a CCP was $5570 per 
patient and yielded 9.640 QALYs. LR of a CCP cost $18,717 per patient and 
yielded fewer QALYs (9.577). For LR to be more cost-effective, the thresholds of 
1-way sensitivity analyses were (1) technical success of ER for complete 
resection in <75.8% of cases, (2) adverse event rates for ER > 12%, and (3) LR 
cost of <$14,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that ER is a cost-effective strategy for removal 
of CCPs. The effectiveness is driven by high technical success and low adverse 
event rates associated with ER, in addition to the increased cost of LR.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
apixaban compared with to warfarin, current standard of care, for stroke 
prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in Japan.
METHODS: A previously published lifetime Markov model was adapted to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of apixaban compared with warfarin in patients with NVAF 
in Japan. In the same model, the costs associated with each clinical event and 
background mortality were replaced with Japanese data. Whenever available, some 
of the utility parameters were derived from Japanese published literature. 
Lifetime horizon was selected to evaluate the value of the treatment benefit 
(stroke prevention) against potential risks (such as major bleedings) among 
patients with NVAF. Direct medical cost, long-term care cost, and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from the payers' 
perspective.
FINDINGS: Compared with warfarin, treatment with apixaban was estimated to 
increase life expectancy by 0.231 year or 0.240 QALYs while treatment cost 
increased by ¥511,692 (US $5117 at an exchange rate of US $1 = ¥100). The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was ¥2,135,743 per QALY (US $21,357 per 
QALY). On the basis of the results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 
when the willingness-to-pay threshold was set at approximately ≥¥2,250,000 (US 
$22,500) per QALY, the probability of apixaban being cost-effective was ≥50%. 
Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of ¥5,000,000 (US $50,000) and 
¥6,700,000 (US $67,000) in Japan, the probability of apixaban being 
cost-effective was 85% and 91%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Although most participants in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke 
and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial used 
for the efficacy data of apixaban in the model were non-Japanese patients, the 
impact of the limitations on our results was considered small, and our results 
were deemed robust because of the additional effect in Japanese patients 
compared with that in the global population according to the subanalysis of 
Japanese patients in the trial. Therefore, based on an adaptation of a published 
Markov model, apixaban is a cost-effective alternative to warfarin in Japan for 
stroke prevention among patients with NVAF.

Patients with thin, low-risk melanomas have an excellent long-term prognosis and 
higher quality of life than those who are diagnosed at later stages. From an 
economic standpoint, treatment of early stage melanoma consumes a fraction of 
the health care resources needed to treat advanced disease. Consequently, early 
diagnosis of melanoma is in the best interest of patients, payers, and health 
care systems. This review describes strategies to ensure that patients receive 
an early diagnosis through interventions ranging from better utilization of 
primary care clinics, to in vivo diagnostic technologies, to new "apps" 
available in the market. Strategies for screening those at high risk due to age, 
male sex, skin type, nevi, genetic mutations, or family history are discussed. 
Despite progress in identifying those at high risk for melanoma, there remains a 
lack of general consensus worldwide for best screening practices. Strategies to 
ensure early diagnosis of recurrent disease in those with a prior melanoma 
diagnosis are also reviewed. Variations in recurrence surveillance practices by 
type of provider and country are featured, with evidence demonstrating that 
various imaging studies, including ultrasound, computed tomography, positron 
emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, provide only minimal gains 
in life expectancy, even for those with more advanced (stage III) disease. 
Because the majority of melanomas are attributable to ultraviolet radiation in 
the form of sunlight, primary prevention strategies, including sunscreen use and 
behavioral interventions, are reviewed. Recent international government 
regulation of tanning beds is described, as well as issues surrounding the 
continued use artificial ultraviolet sources among youth. Health care 
stakeholder strategies to minimize UV exposure are summarized. The 
recommendations encompass both specific behaviors and broad intervention targets 
(eg, individuals, social spheres, organizations, celebrities, governments).

The global trend for increasing life expectancy is resulting in aging 
populations in a number of countries. This brings to bear a pressure to provide 
effective care for the older population with increasing constraints on available 
resources. Providing care for and maintaining the independence of an older 
person in their own home is one way that this problem can be addressed. The EU 
Funded Unobtrusive Smart Environments for Independent Living (USEFIL) project is 
an assistive technology tool being developed to enhance independent living. As 
part of USEFIL, a wrist wearable unit (WWU) is being developed to monitor the 
physical activity (PA) of the user and integrate with the USEFIL system. The WWU 
is a novel application of an existing technology to the assisted living problem 
domain. It combines existing technologies and new algorithms to extract PA 
parameters for activity monitoring. The parameters that are extracted include: 
activity level, step count and worn state. The WWU, the algorithms that have 
been developed and a preliminary validation are presented. The results show that 
activity level can be successfully extracted, that worn state can be correctly 
identified and that step counts in walking data can be estimated within 3% 
error, using the controlled dataset.

Colour-reproduction algorithm for transmitting variable video frames and its 
application to capsule endoscopy.

Presented is a new power-efficient colour generation algorithm for wireless 
capsule endoscopy (WCE) application. In WCE, transmitting colour image data from 
the human intestine through radio frequency (RF) consumes a huge amount of 
power. The conventional way is to transmit all R, G and B components of all 
frames. Using the proposed dictionary-based colour generation scheme, instead of 
sending all R, G and B frames, first one colour frame is sent followed by a 
series of grey-scale frames. At the receiver end, the colour information is 
extracted from the colour frame and then added to colourise the grey-scale 
frames. After a certain number of grey-scale frames, another colour frame is 
sent followed by the same number of grey-scale frames. This process is repeated 
until the end of the video sequence to maintain the colour similarity. As a 
result, over 50% of RF transmission power can be saved using the proposed 
scheme, which will eventually lead to a battery life extension of the capsule by 
4-7 h. The reproduced colour images have been evaluated both statistically and 
subjectively by professional gastroenterologists. The algorithm is finally 
implemented using a WCE prototype and the performance is validated using an 
ex-vivo trial.

[Projections about the future number of dementia sufferers: increasing life 
expectancy not sufficiently considered?].

BACKGROUND: Several authors pointed out that in the next decades dementia will 
affect a considerably increasing number of the elderly. The question was raised 
if life-expectancy was projected to conservative, resulting in revisions with 
higher life-expectancy and larger numbers of the oldest population. The present 
paper analyses the influence of such revisions on the future numbers of dementia 
sufferers in Austria.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: For this purpose we used meta-analyses of epidemiological 
studies and the population projections for the period until 2050 of the Austrian 
Bureau of Statistics as well as of the United Nations Population Division of the 
year 2001 as well of the year 2005.
RESULTS: Using the extrapolations of the Austrian Bureau of Statistics of the 
year 1999 as well as of the United Nations Population Division of the year 2001, 
the number of dementia cases in Austria in the year 2050 will rise to about 233 
thousands. According to the four years later performed extrapolations of the 
United Nations Population Division of the year 2005, dementia cases in Austria 
will raise to about 262 thousands in the year 2050.
CONCLUSIONS: In the next decades, the number of persons suffering from dementia 
will rise considerably. Increasing life-expectancy will result in markedly 
higher numbers of persons with dementia than estimated from earlier population 
projections. Nevertheless, this is the first analysis of future dementia cases 
based on projections from two different dates, but using the same source. We 
must conclude that the dramatically increasing number of dementia cases requires 
comprehensive planning of the health and social care system.

BACKGROUND: Because of improving life expectancy in the world in recent times, 
the focus has shifted to the issue of the quality and nature of life and how to 
assist successful aging (SA) rather than increasing physical survival and 
lifespan. SA is a multidimensional, relative, and context-dependent concept with 
different paths and outcomes. The purpose of this qualitative study was to 
explore older women's strategies for SA in a specific context.
METHODS: Following a grounded theory design approach, we conducted 
semi-structured individual interviews with 21 women between the ages of 28 and 
96 years. We analyzed the data from interviews, written narratives, and field 
notes using the grounded theory approach.
RESULTS: We identified four categories: prevention of threats, internal 
self-control against threats, coping with threats, and optimizing the passage of 
time according to opportunity. These described the strategies for SA when 
encountering with age-related changes. Utilizing these strategies, the women 
accompanied the caravan of life in the context of threats and opportunities.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that SA is a continuous process in confronting 
changes related to age. The identified strategies can help to promote SA by 
familiarizing older women with the threats and opportunities of life and 
training them in how to use these strategies.

What Can We Expect from Value-Based Funding of Medicines? A Retrospective Study.

OBJECTIVE: Deciding on public funding for pharmaceuticals on the basis of value 
for money is now widespread. We suggest that evidence-based assessment of value 
has restricted the availability of medicines in Australia in a way that reflects 
the relative bargaining power of government and the pharmaceutical industry. We 
propose a simple informal game-theoretic model of bargaining between the funding 
agency and industry and test its predictions using a logistic multiple 
regression model of past funding decisions made by the Pharmaceutical Benefits 
Advisory Committee in Australia.
METHOD: The model estimates the probability of a drug being recommended for 
subsidy as a function of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), 
as well as other drug and market characteristics. Data are major submissions or 
resubmissions from 1993 to 2009 where there was a claim of superiority and 
evidence of a difference in quality of life. Independent variables measure the 
incremental cost per QALY, the cost to the public budget, the strength and 
quality of the clinical and economic evidence, need as measured by severity of 
illness and the availability of alternative treatments, whether or not a 
resubmission, and newspaper reports as a measure of public pressure. We report 
the odds ratio for each variable and calculate the ratio of the marginal effect 
of each variable to the marginal effect of the cost per QALY as a measure of the 
revealed willingness to pay for each of the variables that influence the 
decision.
RESULTS: The results are consistent with a bargaining model where a 10,000 
Australian dollar ($A) fall in value (increase in cost per QALY) reduces the 
average probability of public funding from 37 to 33% (95% CI 34-32). If the 
condition is life threatening or the drug has no active comparator, then the 
odds of a positive recommendation are 3.18 (95% CI 1.00-10.11) and 2.14 (95% CI 
0.95-4.83) greater, equivalent to a $A33,000 and a $A21,000 increase in value 
(fall in cost per QALY). If both conditions are met, the odds are increased by 
4.41 (95% CI 1.28-15.24) times, equivalent to an increase in value of $A46,000. 
Funding is more likely as time elapses and price falls, but we did not find 
clear evidence that public or corporate pressure influences decisions.
CONCLUSION: Evidence from Australia suggests that the determinants of public 
funding and pricing decisions for medicines reflect the relative bargaining 
power of government and drug companies. Value for money depends on the quality 
of evidence, timing, patient need, perceived benefit and opportunity cost; these 
factors reflect the potential gains from striking a bargain and the risk of loss 
from not doing so.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The strength of the associations of dietary scores with 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in elderly vary 
considerably between a priori scores. To assess whether healthy eating lowers 
the risk of CVD and all-cause mortality among elderly men.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The Zutphen Elderly Study (age 65-84 years) was divided 
into men with (n = 210) and without (n = 616) cardiovascular-metabolic diseases 
at baseline in 1985. Diet was assessed with the cross-check dietary history 
method. We created the "Dutch Healthy Nutrient and Food Score" (DHNaFS) and the 
"Dutch Undesirable Nutrient and Food Score" (DUNaFS). Associations of the scores 
with CVD and all-cause mortality were assessed using multivariable Cox 
regression models. Associations of scores with life years gained used general 
linear models. During a median follow-up of 10.6 years (IQR 5.8-15.9) 806 
participants died, of whom 359 from CVD. In all men, diet scores did not predict 
death. Among men with cardiovascular-metabolic diseases, DHNaFS was associated 
with lower CVD (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.35-0.93) and all-cause mortality risk (HR: 
0.64; 95% CI: 0.44-0.94) comparing the highest vs. the lowest score tertiles. 
Men with cardiovascular-metabolic diseases in the highest vs. the lowest tertile 
of the DHNaFS lived approximately 2.5 years longer. The DHNaFS was not 
associated with CVD and all-cause mortality in men without 
cardiovascular-metabolic diseases. The DUNaFS was not associated with any of the 
outcomes.
CONCLUSION: A high quality diet was associated with a 40% lower mortality risk 
and 2.5 years longer life expectancy in elderly men with, but not without, 
cardiovascular-metabolic diseases.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common disease, with a prevalence as 
high as 1 in 400 women and 1 in 1000 men, and most are asymptomatic. Patients 
with PHPT have hypercalcemia with inappropriately normal levels of parathyroid 
hormone. Parathyroidectomy is the only curative therapy, and the procedure has 
become more common and more safe. Among asymptomatic patients, parathyroidectomy 
halts the progression of disease, improves quality of life, and may decrease 
risk of fracture and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, surgery should be 
considered in all patients with asymptomatic PHPT who have minimal perioperative 
risk and sufficient life expectancy, regardless of chronologic age.

As an extension of the Outlier FLOODing (OFLOOD) method [Harada et al., J. 
Comput. Chem. 2015, 36, 763], the sparsity of the outliers defined by a 
hierarchical clustering algorithm, FlexDice, was considered to achieve an 
efficient conformational search as sparsity-weighted "OFLOOD." In OFLOOD, 
FlexDice detects areas of sparse distribution as outliers. The outliers are 
regarded as candidates that have high potential to promote conformational 
transitions and are employed as initial structures for conformational resampling 
by restarting molecular dynamics simulations. When detecting outliers, FlexDice 
defines a rank in the hierarchy for each outlier, which relates to sparsity in 
the distribution. In this study, we define a lower rank (first ranked), a medium 
rank (second ranked), and the highest rank (third ranked) outliers, 
respectively. For instance, the first-ranked outliers are located in a given 
conformational space away from the clusters (highly sparse distribution), 
whereas those with the third-ranked outliers are nearby the clusters (a 
moderately sparse distribution). To achieve the conformational search 
efficiently, resampling from the outliers with a given rank is performed. As 
demonstrations, this method was applied to several model systems: Alanine 
dipeptide, Met-enkephalin, Trp-cage, T4 lysozyme, and glutamine binding protein. 
In each demonstration, the present method successfully reproduced transitions 
among metastable states. In particular, the first-ranked OFLOOD highly 
accelerated the exploration of conformational space by expanding the edges. In 
contrast, the third-ranked OFLOOD reproduced local transitions among neighboring 
metastable states intensively. For quantitatively evaluations of sampled 
snapshots, free energy calculations were performed with a combination of 
umbrella samplings, providing rigorous landscapes of the biomolecules.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to examine whether the time horizon 
of time trade-off (TTO) and standard gamble (SG) utility assessment influences 
utility scores and discrimination between health states.
METHODS: In two phases, UK general population participants rated three 
osteoarthritis health states in TTO and SG procedures with two time horizons: 
(1) 10-year and (2) a time horizon derived from self-reported additional life 
expectancy (ALE). The two time horizons were compared in terms of mean utilities 
and discrimination among health states.
RESULTS: In Phase 1, the 10-year tasks were completed by 80 participants, 35 of 
whom also completed utility assessment with the ALE. In Phase 2, all 101 
participants completed procedures with both time horizons. Utility scores tended 
to be lower with the ALE than the 10-year, a difference that was statistically 
significant for two health states with SG in Phase 1 (P < 0.05), two health 
states with TTO in Phase 2 (P < 0.01), and one health state with SG in Phase 2 
(P < 0.001). In Phase 1, rates of discrimination between mild and moderate 
osteoarthritis health states were significantly higher with the ALE than the 
10-year (TTO: P = 0.03; SG: P = 0.001). This pattern of discrimination was 
similar in Phase 2.
DISCUSSION: Results suggest that the time horizon could influence utility scores 
and discrimination among health states. When designing utility evaluations, 
researchers should carefully consider the time horizon so that the value of 
health states is accurately represented in cost-utility models.

BACKGROUND: The main aim of this paper is to see to what extent mortality 
patterns between migrants living in the Netherlands converge. This might be an 
indicator of health and health care acculturation.
METHODS: This is an observational study on the basis of standard mortality 
registration data collected between 1996 and 2007. Eight ethnic groups living in 
Amsterdam are examined to see if mortality converges or diverges over time. 
Trends in mortality are studied using Poisson regression. The life expectancy 
between groups is compared for three time periods.
RESULTS: The data showed that for males and females the life expectancy and 
death rates improved between 1996-1999 and 2004-2007. Most ethnic groups, both 
males and females, followed this positive trend. For most indicators the ethnic 
groups converged in terms of mortality. The data also shows the healthy migrant 
effect with those in Amsterdam from Dutch origin having a relatively high 
mortality and low life expectancy.
DISCUSSION: In this paper the "healthy migrant effect" can be clearly observed. 
An important cause is the emigration of the original and relatively affluent and 
healthy Dutch population to suburban areas. Mortality trends tend to converge 
between ethnic groups during the period 1997-2000 and 2004-2007. The data 
presented here shows further that trends in mortality and life expectancy which 
apply to all ethnic groups are much more powerful as this convergence. One 
wonders if bridging the mortality gap between groups is of much benefit for 
minority groups, or that minority groups would benefit more from an overall 
decrease in mortality.
CONCLUSION: Mortality trends that apply to all groups tend to be much stronger 
compared with trends for individual groups. This shows that dynamics affecting 
all groups similarly have a considerably stronger effect on mortality outcomes 
in various ethnic groups compared with possible convergence.

USA Triangle R&D Center, Kufur Qara 30075, Israel ameed.saabneh@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: Studies about the health status of ethnic minorities in the Middle 
East are rare. This article examines changes in the life expectancy gap during 
1970-2010 between the Arab-Palestinian minority and the Jewish majority in 
Israel, a persistent gap that has widened over the last 20 years. It examines 
the gap in a period over which the minority group was undergoing an 
epidemiological transition and demonstrates consequences of the transition on 
changes in the main causes of death contributing to the life expectancy gap.
METHODS: Decomposition methods estimate the contribution of specific age groups 
and causes of death to the total gap in life expectancy at any given year and 
changes in these contributions over the studied period.
RESULTS: The contribution of mortality differentials at ages <45 years to the 
Arab-Jewish gap in life expectancy declined while that of differentials at ages 
>45 has been gradually growing reaching >70% of the total gap. For both males 
and females, trends in cancer and diabetes mortality differentials contributed 
to widening the gap among the elderly. Trends in heart mortality lead to 
increasing the gap among males but to decreasing it among females.
CONCLUSIONS: While differences in infant and child mortality have declined, 
old-age (>45) mortality differentials have emerged and have been gradually 
widening. These findings calls for a special attention to the various factors 
responsible for the widening mortality gap including social inequality between 
Arabs and Jews and higher levels of smoking and obesity among the Arab 
population.

Bayesian Reconstruction of Two-Sex Populations by Age: Estimating Sex Ratios at 
Birth and Sex Ratios of Mortality.

The original version of Bayesian reconstruction, a method for estimating 
age-specific fertility, mortality, migration and population counts of the recent 
past with uncertainty, produced estimates for female-only populations. Here we 
show how two-sex populations can be similarly reconstructed and probabilistic 
estimates of various sex ratio quantities obtained. We demonstrate the method by 
reconstructing the populations of India from 1971 to 2001, Thailand from 1960 to 
2000, and Laos from 1985 to 2005. We found evidence that in India, sex ratio at 
birth exceeded its conventional upper limit of 1.06, and, further, increased 
over the period of study, with posterior probability above 0.9. In addition, 
almost uniquely, we found evidence that life expectancy at birth (e0) was lower 
for females than for males in India (posterior probability for 1971-1976 equal 
to 0.79), although there was strong evidence for a narrowing of the gap through 
to 2001. In both Thailand and Laos, we found strong evidence for the more usual 
result that e0 was greater for females and, in Thailand, that the difference 
increased over the period of study.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment 
for chronic myelogenous leukemia.

AIM: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed for sequential treatments of 
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) after 
failure of 1st line imatinib, from a commercial payer perspective in the US.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate lifetime treatment costs and 
health outcomes for TKI sequences for treatment of patients resistant or 
intolerant to 1st-line imatinib. Five health states were included, chronic phase 
2nd-line TKI, chronic phase 3rd-line TKI, chronic phase post-TKI, advanced 
phases, and death. Efficacy (response achievement, loss of response, 
transformation, death) and safety (adverse events incidence, discontinuation) 
data are based on clinical trials. Resource utilization, costs, and utilities 
were based on product labels and publically available data. Uncertainty analyses 
were conducted for key inputs.
RESULTS: In patients failing imatinib, dasatinib-initiating treatment sequences 
provide the most survival (ΔLYs = 0.2-2.0), QALYs (ΔQALYs = 0.2-1.9), and accrue 
highest CML-related costs (ΔCosts = $64,000-$222,000). The average ICER per QALY 
for dasatinib- vs imatinib-initiating sequences is $100,000 for an 
imatinib-resistant population. The average ICER per QALY for dasatinib- vs 
nilotinib-initiating sequences is $170,000 for an imatinib-resistant population, 
and $160,000 for an imatinib-intolerant population.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that dasatinib is associated with increased 
survival and quality of life compared to high dose imatinib and to a smaller 
extent with nilotinib, among patients resistant or intolerant to 1st-line 
imatinib, primarily based on higher cytogenetic response rates observed in 
clinical studies of dasatinib. Head-to-head studies of sequential use of 
dasatinib and nilotinib are needed to validate the model findings of improved 
survival (LYs) with better quality-of-life (QALYs) for patients initiating 
dasatinib in 2nd-line. However, the model findings (in light of higher 
cytogenetic response rates with dasatinib) are supported by other studies 
showing improved quality-of-life for responders, and improved survival for 
patients achieving cytogenetic response.

Parkinson's Disease in the Gulf Countries: An Updated Review.

Alamri Y(1), MacAskill M, Anderson T, Benamer H.

Author information:
(1)New Zealand Brain Research Institute, University of Otago, Christchurch, New 
Zealand.

BACKGROUND: The Arabian Gulf region is a rapidly developing part of the world. 
With the increase in average life-expectancy, idiopathic Parkinson's disease 
(PD), is also expected to increase in prevalence. Furthermore, the high rate of 
consanguinity among Arabs probably makes familial cases of PD more likely to be 
encountered than other areas in the world. This review provides an update on the 
published literature on sporadic and familial PD in Gulf Arabs.
SUMMARY: Although the Arab population of this region shares religious beliefs 
and demographic characteristics with other Arabs, their environmental exposures 
and genetic makeup may be different. This could account for the relatively low 
prevalence of PD reported in the Al-Thugba study (27 per 100,000) compared with 
prevalence rates by most other studies on Arab (mainly North African) 
populations (31.4-557.4 per 100,000).
KEY MESSAGES: Gulf countries are considered rich countries, which makes 
conducting nation-wide or even international studies logistically easier than it 
is in many other countries. Such multinational research can be organized by the 
existing Gulf Cooperation Council, or through a collaboration of the Ministries 
of Health. This would, hopefully, culminate in the introduction of more research 
centers, as well as the implementation of better health care policies and 
practices for the ageing community.

BACKGROUND: In Ontario, Canada, the Comprehensive Vascular Disease Prevention 
and Management Initiative (CVDPMI) was undertaken to improve the vascular health 
in communities. The CVDPMI significantly improved cardiovascular (CV) risk 
factor profiles from baseline to follow-up visits including the 10 year 
Framingham Risk Score (FRS). Although the CVDPMI improved CV risk, the economic 
value of this program had not been evaluated.
METHODS: We examined the cost effectiveness of the CVDPMI program compared to no 
CVDPMI program in adult patients identified at risk for an initial or subsequent 
vascular event in a primary care setting. A one year and a ten year cost 
effectiveness analyses were conducted. To determine the uncertainty around the 
cost per life year gained ratio, a non-parametric bootstrap analysis was 
conducted.
RESULTS: The overall population base case analysis at one year resulted in a 
cost per CV event avoided of $70,423. FRS subgroup analyses showed the high risk 
cohort (FRS >20%) had an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) that was 
dominant. In the moderate risk subgroup (FRS 10%-20%) the ICER was $47,439 per 
CV event avoided and the low risk subgroup (FRS <10%) showed a highly cost 
ineffective result of greater than $5 million per CV event avoided. The ten year 
analysis resulted in a dominant ICER.
CONCLUSIONS: At one year, the CVDPMI program is economically acceptable for 
patients at moderate to high risk for CV events. The CVDPMI results in increased 
life expectancy at an incremental cost saving to the healthcare system over a 
ten year period.

[Social inequalities in the occurrence of chronic diseases].

The risks of the occurrence of most chronic diseases are unequally distributed. 
The highest risks occur in men and women with the lowest incomes, the lowest 
educational qualifications, and in occupations with the lowest decision 
latitude. Education, occupational position, and income as indicators of 
socio-economic position differ with regard to their latent content and can thus 
not be considered to be interchangeable. The relative magnitudes of their 
effects differ according to the diseases considered, but all three are not 
available in all studies. After an explanation of the latent content of the most 
frequently used indicators of social differentiation, health inequalities are 
considered by using four groups of chronic illnesses: oral, type 2 diabetes, 
cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. The description is not designed to be an 
exhaustive assessment of the available empirical findings, but rather a 
representative presentation of the results and the explanatory value of 
education, occupation and income.

Nurse Practitioners and Men's Primary Health Care.

Rosu MB(1), Oliffe JL(1), Kelly MT(1).

Author information:
(1)1 University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Though life expectancy sex differences are decreasing in many Western countries, 
men experience higher mortality rates at all ages. Men are often reluctant to 
seek medical care because health help-seeking is strongly linked to femininity, 
male weakness, and vulnerability. Many men are also more likely to access 
emergency care services in response to injury and/or severe pain instead of 
engaging primary health care (PHC) services. Nurse practitioners are well 
positioned to increase men's engagement with PHC to waylay the pressure on 
emergency services and advance the well-being of men. This article demonstrates 
how nurse practitioners can work with men in PHC settings to optimize men's 
self-health and illness prevention and management. Four recommendations are 
discussed: (1) leveling the hierarchies, (2) talking it through, (3) seeing 
diversity within patterns, and (4) augmenting face-to-face PHC services. In 
terms of leveling the hierarchies nurse practitioners can engage men in 
effectual health decision making. Within the interactions detailed in the 
talking it through section are strategies for connecting with male patients and 
mapping their progress. In terms of seeing diversity with in patterns and 
drawing on the plurality of masculinities, nurse practitioners are encouraged to 
adapt a variety of age sensitive assessment tools to better intervene and guide 
men's self-health efforts. Examples of community and web based men's health 
resources are shared in the augmenting face-to-face PHC services section to 
guide the work of nurse practitioners. Overall, the information and 
recommendations shared in this article can proactively direct the efforts of 
nurse practitioners working with men.

OBJECTIVES: To assess and explore over 1 year poststroke (1) the societal costs, 
(2) changes in costs and quality of life (QoL) and (3) the relation between 
costs and QoL.
DESIGN: The current study is a burden of disease study focusing on the 
cost-of-illness (in Euros) and QoL (in utilities) after stroke.
SETTING: Adult patients with stroke were recruited from stroke units in 
hospitals and followed for 1 year.
PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from 395 patients with stroke.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs and QoL expressed in utilities.
METHODS: Cost categories were identified through a bottom-up method. The Dutch 
3-level 5-dimensional EuroQol (EQ-5D-3L) was used to calculate utilities. 
Non-parametric bootstrapping was applied to test for statistical differences in 
costs. Subgroup analyses were performed to identify predictors for costs and 
QoL. Robustness of results was tested via sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The total societal costs for 1 year poststroke were €29 484 (n=352) of 
which 74% were in the first 6 months. QoL remained stable over time. The 
discharge location was a significant predictor for cost and QoL; men had a 
significantly higher QoL than women and younger patients (<65) had significantly 
more costs than older patients (>65). Ceiling effects appear on all dimension of 
the EQ-5D-3L. Costs and QoL show a weak correlation (r=-0.29). Sensitivity 
analyses showed robustness of results.
CONCLUSIONS: We found lower patient costs and higher QoL than expected. This may 
be explained by the good state of health of our study population and by change 
in the Dutch healthcare system, which has led to considerable shorter 
hospitalisation poststroke. Future research must question the use of the 
EQ-5D-3L in a similar population due to ceiling effects.

Lifespan variation adds to life expectancy by measuring the inequality 
surrounding age of death that a population faces. Countries that tackle 
premature mortality generally have decreasing lifespan variation but this is the 
first study to compare and statistically assess when and to what extent trends 
in lifespan variation have changed across Western Europe. Lifespan variation was 
measured using e† and joinpoint regression analysed the timing and rate of 
change. Trends have been mostly downward with the recent exception of men in 
Scotland, Northern Ireland, Ireland and Finland where trends have flattened or 
show slight increases. Future research aimed at identifying the ages and causes 
of death, driving trends in these countries, is key to preventing increasing 
inequalities.
