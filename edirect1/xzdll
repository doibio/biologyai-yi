BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend breast and colorectal cancer screening for 
older adults with a life expectancy >10 years. Most mortality indexes require 
clinician data entry, presenting a barrier for routine use in care. Electronic 
health records (EHR) are a rich clinical data source that could be used to 
create individualized life expectancy predictions to identify patients for 
cancer screening without data entry.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and internally validate a life expectancy calculator from 
structured EHR data.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using national Veteran's Affairs (VA) EHR 
databases.
PATIENTS: Veterans aged 50+ with a primary care visit during 2005.
MAIN MEASURES: We assessed demographics, diseases, medications, laboratory 
results, healthcare utilization, and vital signs 1 year prior to the index 
visit. Mortality follow-up was complete through 2017. Using the development 
cohort (80% sample), we used LASSO Cox regression to select ~100 predictors from 
913 EHR data elements. In the validation cohort (remaining 20% sample), we 
calculated the integrated area under the curve (iAUC) and evaluated calibration.
KEY RESULTS: In 3,705,122 patients, the mean age was 68 years and the majority 
were male (97%) and white (85%); nearly half (49%) died. The life expectancy 
calculator included 93 predictors; age and gender most strongly contributed to 
discrimination; diseases also contributed significantly while vital signs were 
negligible. The iAUC was 0.816 (95% confidence interval, 0.815, 0.817) with good 
calibration.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a life expectancy calculator using VA EHR data with 
excellent discrimination and calibration. Automated life expectancy prediction 
using EHR data may improve guideline-concordant breast and colorectal cancer 
screening by identifying patients with a life expectancy >10 years.

IMPORTANCE: Therapist-guided, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy is 
an effective treatment option for children and adolescents with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, but to our knowledge, its cost-effectiveness 
compared with traditional in-person treatment has not been established.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of guided internet-delivered 
cognitive behavioral therapy implemented within a stepped-care model compared 
with in-person cognitive behavioral therapy for young people with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation of a randomized 
noninferiority trial conducted at 2 specialist obsessive-compulsive disorder 
clinics in Sweden enrolled 152 children and adolescents aged 8 to 17 years with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, mainly through clinician referrals (110 [72%]). 
Recruitment began October 6, 2017, and ended May 24, 2019. Follow-up ended April 
14, 2020.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive either guided 
internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy or in-person cognitive 
behavioral therapy during a 16-week period. At the 3-month follow-up, 
nonresponders in both groups were offered additional in-person cognitive 
behavior therapy sessions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Health outcomes were treatment response rates 
(primary outcome), remission rates, and quality-adjusted life-years. Cost data 
were collected before treatment, after treatment, at 3-month follow-up, and at 
6-month follow-up (primary end point) and are presented in 2020 US dollars. The 
differences in incremental costs and health outcomes were compared between the 
groups and presented from the health care professional, health care sector, and 
societal perspectives.
RESULTS: A total of 152 participants (94 girls [62%]; mean [SD] age, 13.4 [2.5] 
years) were randomized; 151 (99%) completed the trial. At the 6-month follow-up, 
50 of 74 participants (68%) in the stepped-care group and 52 of 77 participants 
(68%) in the in-person cognitive behavioral therapy group were classified as 
treatment responders (odds ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.51-1.98]; P = .99). Health 
economic analyses showed that the stepped-care group used fewer therapist 
resources than the in-person cognitive behavioral therapy group, resulting in a 
mean cost savings of $2104 (95% CI, $1202-$3006) per participant for the full 
study period of 10 months, corresponding to a relative savings of 39%. The cost 
savings remained largely comparable when taking wider health care sector and 
societal perspectives.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that, for young people with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, a low-cost digital intervention followed by 
in-person treatment for nonresponders was cost-effective compared with in-person 
cognitive behavior therapy alone.

BACKGROUND: The Turkish healthcare system has seen broad population-based 
improvements in expanded health insurance coverage and access to healthcare 
services. Hospital performance in this national system is understudied. We aimed 
to identify trends in hospital performance over time following implementation of 
the Health Transformation Program and describe how regional outcomes correlate 
with regional vital statistics.
OBJECTIVE: We examine hospital performance data collected by the PHA from 2013 
to 2015. We aim to identify the temporal variation in hospital performance for 
nearly 30 individual measures and to describe the relationship between 
hospital-level performance measures and regional vital statistics.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 674 public hospitals in 
Turkey using baseline data from 2013 and follow-up data from 2014-15 collected 
by the Turkish Statistical Institution and the Public Hospital Agency. We report 
demographic and socioeconomic data across 12 geographic regions and analyze 29 
hospital-level performance measures across four domains: (i) health services; 
(ii) administrative services; (iii) financial services and (iv) quality 
measures. We examine temporal variation, and study correlation between 
performance measures and regional vital statistics. We fit mixed-effects linear 
regression models to estimate linear trend over time accounting for 
within-hospital residual correlation. We prepared our manuscript in accordance 
with guidelines set by the STROBE statement for cohort studies.
RESULTS: During the 3 years of study period, 21 of 29 measures improved and 8 
measures worsened. All but three measures demonstrated significant differences 
across regions of the country. Several measures, including inpatient efficiency, 
patient satisfaction and audit score, are associated with regional infant 
mortality and life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of temporal improvement in hospital-level performance may 
suggest some positive changes within the Turkish national healthcare system. 
Correlation of some measures with regional level health outcomes suggests a 
quality measurement strategy to monitor performance changes in the future. 
Although hospital-level functions have improved performance, the results of our 
study may help achieve further improvement for the health of the country's 
citizens.

The ramified morphology of microglia and the dynamics of their membrane 
protrusions are essential for their functions in central nervous system 
development, homeostasis, and disease. Although their ability to change and 
control shape critically depends on the actin and actomyosin cytoskeleton, the 
underlying regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we 
systematically analyzed the actomyosin cytoskeleton and regulators downstream of 
the small GTPase RhoA in the control of microglia shape and function. Our 
results reveal that (i) Myh9 controls cortical tension levels and affects 
microglia protrusion formation, (ii) cofilin-mediated maintenance of actin 
turnover regulates microglia protrusion extension, and (iii) Myh10 influences 
microglia inflammatory activation. Overall we uncover molecular pathways that 
regulate microglia morphology and identify type-II myosins as important 
regulators of microglia biology with differential roles in the control of cell 
shape (Myh9) and functions (Myh10).

The objective of this study is to provide comprehensive and up-to-date estimates 
on the disease burden of BPH in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 
2019. Data about incidence, year lived with disability (YLD), and their 
age-standardized rates (ASRs) for 21 regions, 5 Socio-demographic Index (SDI) 
quintiles, 204 countries and territories, and 12 age categories from 1990 to 
2019 were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study. Estimated 
annual percentage changes (EAPCs) of the ASRs and the associations between SDI 
and the ASRs were estimated. The effects of population growth, population aging, 
and age-specific rate on the changes in the absolute numbers of incidence and 
YLD were quantified. Globally, there were 11.26 million (95% uncertainty 
interval [UI]: 8.79, 14.46) new cases and 1.86 million (95%UI: 1.13, 2.78) YLD 
due to BPH in 2019. The global ASRs of incidence (EAPC: -0.031, 95% CI: -0.050, 
-0.012) and YLD (EAPC: -0.058, 95% CI: -0.084, -0.031) decreased slightly from 
1990 to 2019, whereas the absolute numbers increased dramatically from 1990 
(incidence by 105.7% and YLD by 110.6%), mainly driven by the population growth 
(53.5% for incidence and 54.4% for YLD) and population aging (55.7% for 
incidence and 63.2% for YLD). The burden of BPH varied markedly among different 
regions, socioeconomic status, and countries. As the population is growing and 
aging, great efforts are required to develop effective prevention, treatment and 
management strategies to meet the high and increasing burden of BPH worldwide.

Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is an aggressive B-cell 
lymphoma arising from thymic B-cells having clinicopathologic features distinct 
from systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). PMBCL comprises 2% to 4% of 
all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), 7% of DLBCL and seen predominantly in young 
females with a median age of 35 years at diagnosis. The annual incidence of 
PMBCL is 0.4 per million with a 5-year survival rate exceeding 70% with 
improving supportive care and genetic characterization of the disease. 
Pathogenesis involves dysregulation of Janus kinase-signal transducer and 
activator of transcription (JAK-STAT), nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) pathways and 
amplification of the 9p24.1 region of chromosome 9. PMBCL patients have a 
prolonged life expectancy necessitating the need for treatment approaches that 
are based on maximizing cure with minimal long-term toxicity. Due to rarity and 
its recognition as a distinct entity, therapeutic decisions are guided by 
clinical presentation, clinician and center experience, and analysis of patients 
with PMBCL within DLBCL registries. Historically R-CHOP has been the usual first 
line treatment for PMBCL followed by involved site radiotherapy (ISRT), however 
clinical practice varies across centers with emerging consensus to avoid upfront 
RT by utilizing dose intense regimens (DA-EPOCH-R) in younger and fit patients. 
Prognosis of relapsed refractory PMBCL not responding to salvage chemotherapy is 
dismal, however there are many emerging options including Brentuximab Vedotin, 
immune check point inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. In 
this article, we focus on the pathogenesis, current and evolving treatments, and 
provide recommendations for optimal management of patients with PMBCL.

Although the concept of precision medicine, in which healthcare is tailored to 
the molecular and clinical characteristics of each individual, is not new, its 
implementation in clinical practice has been heterogenous. In some medical 
specialties, precision medicine has gone from being just a promise to a reality 
that achieves better patient outcomes. This is a fact if we consider, for 
example, the great advances made in the genetic diagnosis and subsequent 
treatment of countless hereditary diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, which have 
improved the life expectancy of many of the affected children. In the field of 
oncology, the development of targeted therapies has prolonged the survival of 
patients with breast, lung, colorectal, melanoma, and hematological 
malignancies. In other disciplines, clinical milestones are perhaps less well 
known, but no less important. The current challenge is to expand and generalize 
the use of technologies that are central to precision medicine, such as 
massively parallel sequencing, to improve the management (prevention and 
treatment) of complex conditions such as cardiovascular, kidney, or autoimmune 
diseases. This process requires investment in specialized expertise, 
multidisciplinary collaboration, and the nationwide organization of genetic 
laboratories for diagnosis of specific diseases.

Medical interventions that increase life expectancy of patients result in 
additional consumption of non-medical goods and services in 'added life years'. 
This paper focuses on the distributional consequences across socio-economic 
groups of including these costs in cost effectiveness analysis. In that context, 
it also highlights the role of remaining quality of life and household economies 
of scale. Data from a Dutch household spending survey was used to estimate 
non-medical consumption and household size by age and educational attainment. 
Estimates of non-medical consumption and household size were combined with life 
tables to estimate what the impact of including non-medical survivor costs would 
be on the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of preventing a death at a 
certain age. Results show that including non-medical survivor costs increases 
estimated ICERs most strongly when interventions are targeted at the higher 
educated. Adjusting for household size (lower educated people less often live 
additional life years in multi-person households) and quality of life (lower 
educated people on average spend added life years in poorer health) mitigates 
this difference. Ignoring costs of non-medical consumption in economic 
evaluations implicitly favors interventions targeted at the higher educated and 
thus potentially amplifies socio-economic inequalities in health.

Road injury burden in Mexico 1990 to 2019: Secondary data analysis from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study.

Road injuries have been a major cause of premature mortality and disability in 
Mexico. The objective of this paper is to report the findings from the Global 
Burden of Disease study (GBD-2019) on road injuries in Mexico at a national and 
subnational scale from 1990 to 2019, and to assess the association between road 
injury burden and the socio-demographic index. Following the 2019 Global Burden 
of Disease study road injury mortality, premature mortality, the years lived 
with disability and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) are reported. While 
the number of deaths from road injuries increased between 1990 and 2019, the 
age-standardized mortality rates declined. Pedestrian road injuries and motor 
vehicle road injuries accounted for 8 of every 10 deaths from road injury in 
2019. Road injury mortality and DALY rates decreased nationally, but stagnated 
since 2011. The road injury burden was higher for men in all age groups. 
Pedestrian and motor vehicle road injuries caused the highest DALY rate in both 
males and females. There was no significant association between the SDI and the 
road injury age-standardized DALY rates. This study presents a comprehensive 
report of road injury burden of disease in Mexico. Mexico continues to have an 
incomplete, fragmented and poorly enforced legislative framework, with a large 
diversity between its 32 states. Thus, an integrated legislative and juridical 
effort is needed to continue reducing the road injury disease burden, which is 
tailored for specific age groups, vulnerable road users and high-burden areas.

CONTEXT: There are few international studies about the continuous use of 
sedatives (CUS) in the last days of life.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to describe the experiences and opinions regarding CUS of 
physicians caring for terminally ill patients in seven countries.
METHODS: Questionnaire study about practices and experiences with CUS in the 
last days of life among physicians caring for terminally ill patients in Belgium 
(n = 175), Germany (n = 546), Italy (n = 214), Japan (n = 513), the Netherlands 
(n = 829), United Kingdom (n = 114) and Singapore (n = 21).
RESULTS: The overall response rate was 22%. Of the respondents, 88-99% reported 
that they had clinical experience of CUS in the last 12 months. More than 90% of 
respondents indicated that they mostly used midazolam for sedation. The use of 
sedatives to relieve suffering in the last days of life was considered 
acceptable in cases of physical suffering (87%-99%). This percentage was lower 
but still substantial in cases of psycho-existential suffering in the absence of 
physical symptoms (45%-88%). These percentages were lower when the prognosis was 
at least several weeks (22%-66% for physical suffering and 5%-42% for 
psycho-existential suffering). Of the respondents, 10% or less agreed with the 
statement that CUS is unnecessary because suffering can be alleviated with other 
measures. A substantial proportion (41%-95%) agreed with the statement that a 
competent patient with severe suffering has the right to demand the use of 
sedatives in the last days of life.
CONCLUSION: Many respondents in our study considered CUS acceptable for the 
relief of physical and psycho-existential suffering in the last days of life. 
The acceptability was lower regarding CUS for psycho-existential suffering and 
regarding CUS for patients with a longer life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: We have recently reported on a recombinant von Willebrand factor 
(VWF) D'D3 albumin fusion protein (rD'D3-FP) developed to extend the half-life 
of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) for the treatment of hemophilia A. Based on 
predictive modelling presented in this study, we hypothesized that modifying 
rD'D3-FP to improve FVIII interaction would reduce exchange with endogenous VWF 
and provide additional FVIII half-life benefit.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify novel rD'D3-FP variants with 
enhanced therapeutic efficacy in extending FVIII half-life.
METHODS: Through both directed mutagenesis and random mutagenesis using a novel 
mammalian display platform, we identified novel rD'D3-FP variants with increased 
affinity for FVIII (rVIII-SingleChain) under both neutral and acidic conditions 
and assessed their ability to extend FVIII half-life in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: In rat preclinical studies, rD'D3-FP variants with increased affinity 
for FVIII displayed enhanced potency, with reduced dose levels required to 
achieve equivalent rVIII-SingleChain half-life extension. In cell-based imaging 
studies in vitro, we also demonstrated reduced dissociation of rVIII-SingleChain 
from the rD'D3-FP variants within acidic endosomes and more efficient 
co-recycling of the rD'D3-FP/rVIII-SingleChain complex via the FcRn recycling 
system.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, at potential clinical doses, the rD'D3-FP variants 
provide marked benefits with respect to dose levels and half-life extension of 
co-administered FVIII, supporting their development for use in the treatment of 
hemophilia A.

BACKGROUNDS: Cancer is one of the main causes of death worldwide, seriously 
threatening human health and life expectancy. We aimed to analyze the cancer 
incidence and mortality rates during 2016 in Zhejiang Province, Southeast China.
METHODS: Data were collected from 14 population-based cancer registries across 
Zhejiang Province of China. Cancer incidence and mortality rates stratified by 
sex and region were analyzed. The crude rate, age-standardized rate, 
age-specific and region-specific rate, and cumulative rate were calculated. The 
proportions of 10 common cancers in different groups and the incidence and 
mortality rates of the top five cancers in different age groups were also 
calculated. The Chinese national census of 2000 and the world Segi population 
was used for calculating the age-standardized incidence and mortality rates.
RESULTS: The 14 cancer registries covered a population of 14,250,844 
individuals, accounting for 29.13% of the population of Zhejiang Province. The 
total reported cancer cases and deaths were 55,835 and 27,013, respectively. The 
proportion of morphological verification (MV%) was 78.95% of the population, and 
percentage of incident cases identified through death certificates only (DCO%) 
was 1.23% with a mortality-to-incidence ratio (M/I ratio) of 0.48. The crude 
incidence rate in Zhejiang cancer registration areas was 391.80/105; the 
age-standardized incidence rate of the Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and 
the age-standardized incidence rate of the world standard population (ASIRW) 
were 229.76/105 and 220.96/105, respectively. The incidence rate in men was 
higher than that in women. The incidence rate increased rapidly after 45 years 
of age and peaked in individuals aged 80 to 84 years. The top 10 incidence rates 
of cancers were lung cancer, female breast cancer, thyroid cancer, colorectal 
cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, 
esophageal cancer, and pancreatic cancer (from highest to lowest). The crude 
mortality rate in Zhejiang cancer registration areas was 189.55/105; the 
age-standardized mortality rate of the Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and 
the age-standardized mortality rate of the world standard population (ASMRW) 
were 94.46/105 and 93.42/105, respectively. The mortality rate in men was higher 
than that in women, and the male population in rural areas was higher than that 
in urban areas. The cancer mortality rate increased rapidly after 50 years of 
age and peaked in individuals aged 85+ years. The top 10 mortality rates of 
cancers were lung cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, 
pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, female breast cancer, prostate cancer, 
lymphoma, and leukemia (from highest to lowest).
CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer, female breast cancer, thyroid cancer, colorectal 
cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, and stomach cancer were the most common 
cancers in Zhejiang Province. Effective prevention and control measures should 
be established after considering the different characteristics of cancers in 
urban and rural areas.

STUDY DESIGN: General population utility valuation study.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a technique for calculating 
utilities from the Spine Oncology Study Group Outcomes Questionnaire v2.0 
(SOSGOQ2.0).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The ability to calculate quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) for metastatic spine disease would enhance treatment decision-making and 
facilitate economic analysis. QALYs are calculated using utilities.
METHODS: Using a hybrid concept-retention and factorial analysis shortening 
approach, we first shortened the SOSGOQ2.0 to eight items (SOSGOQ-8D). This was 
done to lessen the cognitive burden of the utility valuation exercise. A general 
population sample of 2730 adults was then asked to evaluate 12 choice sets based 
on SOSGOQ-8D health states in a Discrete Choice Experiment. A utility scoring 
rubric was then developed using a mixed multinomial-logit regression model.
RESULTS: We were able to reduce the SOSGOQ2.0 to an SOSGOQ-8D with a mean error 
of 0.003 and mean absolute error of 3.078 compared to the full questionnaire. 
The regression model demonstrated good predictive performance and was used to 
develop a utility scoring rubric. Regression results revealed that participants 
did not regard all SOSGOQ-8D items as equally important.
CONCLUSION: We provide a simple technique for converting the SOSGOQ2.0 to 
utilities. The ability to evaluate QALYs in metastatic spine disease will 
facilitate economic analysis and patient counseling. We also quantify the 
importance of individual SOSGOQ-8D items. Clinicians should heed these findings 
and offer treatments that maximize function in the most important items.Level of 
Evidence: 3.

To evaluate the individual responses in skeletal muscle outcomes following bed 
rest, data from three studies (21-day PlanHab; 10-day FemHab and LunHab) were 
combined. Subjects (n = 35) participated in three cross-over campaigns within 
each study: normoxic (NBR) and hypoxic bed rest (HBR), and hypoxic ambulation 
(HAMB; used as control). Individual variability (SDIR) was investigated as √(SD 
Exp2 -SD Con2 ), where SDExp and SDCon are the standard deviations of the change 
score (i.e., post - pre) in the experimental (NBR and HBR) and the control 
(HAMB) groups, respectively. Repeatability and moderators of the individual 
variability were explored. Significant SDIR was detected for knee extension 
torque, and thigh and calf muscle area, which translated into an individual 
response ranging from 3 to -17% for knee extension torque, -2 to -12% for calf 
muscle area, and -1 to -8% for thigh muscle area. Strong correlations were found 
for changes in NBR vs. HBR (i.e., repeatability) in thigh and calf muscle area 
(r = 0.65-0.75, P < 0.0001). Change-scores in knee extension torque, and thigh 
and calf muscle area strongly correlated with baseline values (P < 0.001; r 
between -0.5 and -0.9). Orthogonal partial least squares regression analysis 
explored if changes in the investigated variables could predict calf muscle area 
alterations. This analysis indicated that 43% of the variance in calf muscle 
area could be attributed to changes in all of the other variables. This is the 
first study using a validated methodology to report clinically relevant 
individual variability after bed rest in knee extension torque, calf muscle 
area, and (to a lower extent) thigh muscle area. Baseline values emerged as a 
moderator of the individual response, and a global bed rest signature served as 
a moderately strong predictor of the individual variation in calf muscle area 
alterations.

Many biologically active natural products are synthesized by nonribosomal 
peptide synthetases (NRPSs), polyketide synthases (PKSs) and their hybrids. 
These megasynthetases contain modules possessing distinct catalytic domains that 
allow for substrate initiation, chain extension, processing and termination. At 
the end of a module, a terminal domain, usually a thioesterase (TE), is 
responsible for catalyzing the release of the NRPS or PKS as a linear or 
cyclized product. In this review, we address the general cyclization mechanism 
of the TE domain, including oligomerization and the fungal C-C bond forming 
Claisen-like cyclases (CLCs). Additionally, we include examples of cyclization 
catalysts acting within or at the end of a module. Furthermore, 
condensation-like (CT) domains, terminal reductase (R) domains, reductase-like 
domains that catalyze Dieckmann condensation (RD), thioesterase-like Dieckmann 
cyclases, trans-acting TEs from the penicillin binding protein (PBP) enzyme 
family, product template (PT) domains and others will also be reviewed. The 
studies summarized here highlight the remarkable diversity of NRPS and PKS 
cyclization catalysts for the production of biologically relevant, complex 
cyclic natural products and related compounds.

Invasive sinus aspergillosis is a rare life-threatening condition usually found 
in immunocompromised patients. The fungus spreads from paranasal sinuses into 
the central nervous system by direct extension or through blood vessels. 
Perineural spread is an uncommon mechanism of spread in invasive aspergillosis. 
A mycotic aneurysm is a dangerous complication of invasive sinus aspergillosis 
because of its insidious development and is often diagnosed only post-mortem 
after causing fatal intracranial hemorrhage. Intracranial vascular complications 
of invasive sinus aspergillosis require prompt recognition and treatment and 
should always be considered when a diagnosis of CNS aspergillosis is made. We 
present a case of invasive sinus aspergillosis in an apparently immunocompetent 
patient that manifested with a brain abscess, perineural spread of the 
infection, and mycotic aneurysm of the vertebral artery with subsequent rupture 
and fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. This case highlights the possibility of 
perineural spread and hemorrhagic complications in invasive cerebral 
aspergillosis.

The aging of population has become an issue of great concern because of its 
rapid increase. Aging is an important risk factor of many chronic diseases. 
Resveratrol could be found in many foods, such as grapes, red wine, peanuts, and 
blueberries. Many studies reported that resveratrol possessed various 
bioactivities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular 
protection, anticancer, antidiabetes mellitus, antiobesity, neuroprotection, and 
antiaging effects. The antiaging mechanisms of resveratrol were mainly 
ameliorating oxidative stress, relieving inflammatory reaction, improving 
mitochondrial function, and regulating apoptosis. Resveratrol could be an 
effective and safe compound for the prevention and treatment of aging and 
age-related diseases. In this review, we summarize the effects of resveratrol on 
aging, life extension, and several age-related diseases, with special attention 
paid to the mechanisms of antiaging action.

Lactococcus garvieae is a fish pathogen and an uncommon cause of human 
infections. There is a growing body of evidence showing its potential for 
causing endocarditis especially in those with prior valve surgery. In this case 
report, we present what we believe is the first case of endocarditis by L. 
garvieae affecting a valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement that 
was successfully treated. Specific guidelines for the management of these 
patients are lacking. Our experience can contribute to the current knowledge 
regarding this life-threatening infection as well as to the future care of these 
patients. We aim to emphasize that despite not being recognized as a typical 
endocarditis microorganism by the Duke Criteria, the possibility of endocarditis 
needs to be highly entertained in patients with L. garvieae bacteremia, 
especially when prosthetic valves are present. Consequently, clinicians should 
pursue further this diagnosis with transesophageal echocardiogram and/or 
alternative imaging modalities (e.g., PET-CT scan and MRI) regardless of an 
initial negative transthoracic echocardiogram. Reaching a diagnosis of L. 
garvieae endocarditis led us to the decision of prolonging the antibiotic course 
for 6 weeks with successful results. Ultimately, surgery was not required owing 
to the absence of prosthetic aortic valve dysfunction and paravalvular extension 
of the infection.
