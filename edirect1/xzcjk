Patients with severe mental disorders die on average 20 years prior to the 
general population. This mortality gap is mainly due to the higher prevalence of 
physical diseases and the adoption of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors.The 
LIFESTYLE trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of a new psychosocial group 
intervention (including psychoeducational, motivational, and problem-solving 
techniques) focused on healthy lifestyle behavior compared to a brief 
educational group intervention in a community sample of patients with severe 
mental disorders. The trial is a national-funded, multicentric, randomized 
controlled trial with blinded outcome assessments, which is carried out in six 
outpatient units of the Universities of Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli" in Naples, 
Bari, Genova, L'Aquila, Pisa, and Rome-Tor Vergata. All patients are assessed at 
the following time points: baseline (T0); 2 months post-randomization (T1); 4 
months post-randomization (T2); 6 months post-randomization (T3); 12 months 
post-randomization (T4); and 24 months post-randomization (T5). T1 and T2 
assessments include only anthropometric tests. The BMI, a reliable and feasible 
anthropometric parameter, has been selected as primary outcome. In particular, 
the mean value of BMI at 6 months from baseline (T3) will be evaluated through a 
Generalized Estimated Equation model. The work hypothesis is that the LIFESTYLE 
psychosocial group intervention will be more effective than the brief 
educational group intervention in reducing the BMI. We expect a mean difference 
between the two groups of at least one point (and standard deviation of two 
points) at BMI. Secondary outcomes are: the improvement in dietary patterns, in 
smoking habits, in sleeping habits, physical activity, personal and social 
functioning, severity of physical comorbidities, and adherence to medications. 
The expected sample size consists of 420 patients (70 patients for each of the 
six participating centers), and they are allocated with a 1:1 ratio 
randomization, stratified according to center, age, gender, and educational 
level. Heavy smoking, sedentary behavior, and unhealthy diet pattern are very 
frequent and are associated with a reduced life expectancy and higher levels of 
physical comorbidities in people with severe mental disorders. New interventions 
are needed and we hope that the LIFESTYLE protocol will help to fill this gap.

Popliteal artery aneurysms account for 70% of peripheral aneurysms and must be 
treated surgically. The results of endovascular treatment are controversial. The 
objective of this study is to conduct a literature review on comparisons between 
open surgery and endovascular treatment for popliteal artery aneurysms. Searches 
were run on the LILACS and MEDLINE databases using the appropriate search terms 
and 15 articles were selected. A total of 5,166 surgical procedures were 
compared, 3,930 open surgeries and 1,236 endovascular surgeries. Open surgery 
with venous bypass is still the gold standard. Endovascular surgery offers 
shorter length of hospital stay and is a viable option for elective patients, 
those with short life expectancy, high surgical risk, comorbidities, and more 
advanced age. However, long-term studies are needed to establish the true 
benefits and indications for the two techniques, such as randomized clinical 
trials.

Os aneurismas de artéria poplítea correspondem a 70% dos aneurismas periféricos 
e o tratamento é cirúrgico, com controvérsias sobre os resultados da via 
endovascular. Este estudo objetivou realizar uma revisão da literatura sobre a 
comparação entre cirurgia aberta e endovascular no tratamento dos aneurismas da 
artéria poplítea. A pesquisa foi realizada utilizando os termos apropriados nos 
portais de periódicos LILACS e MEDLINE, com a seleção de 15 artigos. Um total de 
5.166 procedimentos cirúrgicos foram comparados, sendo 3.930 cirurgias abertas e 
1.236 cirurgias endovasculares. A cirurgia aberta com bypass venoso continua 
sendo o padrão-ouro. A cirurgia endovascular apresenta menor tempo de internação 
e é uma opção viável em pacientes eletivos, com baixa expectativa de vida, alto 
risco cirúrgico, comorbidades e mais idosos, desde que tenham anatomia favorável 
para o procedimento. Contudo, são necessários estudos de longo prazo para 
estabelecer os reais benefícios e indicações das duas técnicas, como o ensaio 
clínico randomizado controlado.

AIMS: The purpose of this study was to examine long-term life expectancy 
including cerebrovascular events (CVE) and fate of the leg in patients with 
peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with or without cerebral infarction (CI) 
detected by computed tomography (CT).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective cohort study was performed in 932 patients 
with PAD. The endpoints were overall survival (OS), CVE, stroke-free survival 
(SFS), freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and freedom from 
major adverse cardiovascular and limb events (MACLE). The prevalence of CI on CT 
was 56.8%. There were 413 deaths (44.3%) during follow-up. The rate of 
cardiovascular deaths among those who died was 53.5%. The 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS 
rates were 82.0%, 76.9%, and 46.2%, respectively. In Cox multivariate analyses, 
age, ankle brachial pressure index (ABI), critical limb ischaemia (CLI), 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albumin level, and CI were 
independent factors associated with OS (P < 0.05); age, ABI, CLI, atrial 
fibrillation (AF), and CI were related to CVE (P < 0.05); age, ABI, CLI, 
diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), AF, eGFR, lower albumin, and CI were 
related to SFS (P < 0.05); age, ABI, CLI, diabetes, CHD, eGFR, lower albumin, 
and CI were associated with MACE (P < 0.05); and age, ABI, diabetes, CHD, eGFR, 
lower albumin and CI were related to MACLE (P < 0.05). Statins improved MACE and 
MACLE (P < 0.05), and AF increased MACLE (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: CI on CT was an independent predictor for mortality, CVE, SFS, 
MACE, and MACLE. Statins improved MACE and MACLE, but AF increased CVE and MACLE 
in patients with PAD.

Sarilumab (Kevzara®), a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 (IL-6) 
receptor, is approved in various countries, including the USA, those of the EU, 
and Japan, as a subcutaneous treatment administered every 2 weeks for moderately 
to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults who have responded 
inadequately to, or are intolerant of, one or more DMARDs. In placebo-controlled 
trials, sarilumab improved the signs and symptoms of RA, as well as physical 
function and health-related quality-of-life (HR-QOL), when administered in 
combination with conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) therapy in patients with 
an inadequate response to methotrexate or an inadequate response to, or 
intolerance of, at least one tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor; benefits 
were sustained over ≤ 3 years' therapy in an open-label extension. Sarilumab 
plus methotrexate inhibited the progression of structural damage in patients who 
had inadequately responded to methotrexate. As monotherapy in patients who were 
inappropriate for continued treatment with methotrexate, sarilumab was more 
effective than adalimumab in reducing the signs and symptoms of RA and improving 
physical function. The safety profile of sarilumab was consistent with the 
anticipated effects of IL-6 inhibition. In the minority of patients who tested 
positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), ADAs did not impact efficacy or 
increase adverse reactions. Thus, sarilumab extends the available treatment 
options for adults with moderately to severely active RA who have responded 
inadequately to, or are intolerant of, at least one DMARD.

Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) are central to the biosynthesis and 
modification of the plant cell wall. An ancient clade of bifunctional plant 
endo-glucanases (EG16 members) was recently revealed and proposed to represent a 
transitional group uniting plant xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase 
(XTH) gene products and bacterial mixed-linkage endo-glucanases in the phylogeny 
of glycoside hydrolase family 16 (GH16). To gain broader insights into the 
distribution and frequency of EG16 and other GH16 members in plants, the 
PHYTOZOME, PLAZA, NCBI and 1000 PLANTS databases were mined to build a 
comprehensive census among 1289 species, spanning the broad phylogenetic 
diversity of multiple algae through recent plant lineages. EG16, newly 
identified EG16-2 and XTH members appeared first in the green algae. Extant EG16 
members represent the early adoption of the β-jellyroll protein scaffold from a 
bacterial or early-lineage eukaryotic GH16 gene, which is characterized by loop 
deletion and extension of the N terminus (in EG16-2 members) or C terminus (in 
XTH members). Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of EG16 and EG16-2 
sequences are directly concordant with contemporary estimates of plant 
evolution. The lack of expansion of EG16 members into multi-gene families across 
green plants may point to a core metabolic role under tight control, in contrast 
to XTH genes that have undergone the extensive duplications typical of cell-wall 
CAZymes. The present census will underpin future studies to elucidate the 
physiological role of EG16 members across plant species, and serve as roadmap 
for delineating the closely related EG16 and XTH gene products in bioinformatic 
analyses of emerging genomes and transcriptomes.

BACKGROUND: The current study assessed the feasibility of a mentored home-based 
vegetable gardening intervention and examined changes in health-related outcomes 
among breast cancer survivors (BCS).
METHODS: BCS were randomized to either a year-long vegetable gardening 
intervention to begin immediately or a wait-list control. Master Gardeners 
mentored participants in planning, planting, and maintaining 3 seasonal gardens 
over the course of 1 year. Participant accrual, retention, and satisfaction 
rates of ≥80% served as feasibility (primary outcome) benchmarks. Secondary 
outcomes (ie, vegetable consumption, physical activity, performance and 
function, anthropometrics, biomarkers, and health-related quality of life) were 
collected at baseline and post-intervention (1-year follow-up) using subjective 
and objective measures.
RESULTS: The trial surpassed all feasibility benchmarks at 82% of targeted 
accrual, 95% retention, and 100% satisfaction (ie, experience ratings of "good 
to excellent" and willingness to "do it again"). Compared with the controls, 
intervention participants reported significantly greater improvements in 
moderate physical activity (+14 vs -17 minutes/week) and demonstrated 
improvements in the 2-Minute Step Test (+22 vs + 10 steps), and Arm Curl (+2.7 
vs + 0.1 repetitions) (P values < .05). A trend toward improved vegetable 
consumption was observed (+0.9 vs + 0.2 servings/day; P = .06). Approximately 
86% of participants were continuing to garden at the 2-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest that a mentored, 
home-based vegetable gardening intervention is feasible and offers an 
integrative and durable approach with which to improve health behaviors and 
outcomes among BCS. Harvest for Health led to the establishment of a group of 
trained Master Gardeners and gave rise to local and global community-based 
programs. Larger studies are needed to confirm the results presented herein and 
to define applicability across broader populations of survivors.

Background: In Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT), patients with low back 
pain (LBP) are classified into subgroups to guide a management strategy. A 
common subgroup where symptoms improve with lumbar extension is labeled 
posterior derangement syndrome. A less common subgroup where symptoms improve 
with lumbar flexion is labeled anterior derangement syndrome. Case Presentation: 
The patient was a 23-year-old woman with intermittent LBP and discomfort over 
the left lower extremity was initially diagnosis with posterior derangement 
syndrome. At the initial and second consultations, postural correction and home 
exercises with lumbar extension were prescribed. However, at the third 
consultation, sustained lumbar extension revealed worsening of symptoms and 
function, which resulted in a revised diagnosis of anterior derangement 
syndrome. Complete recovery was achieved using exercises with lumbar flexion 
over 6 weeks. Outcomes: The patient wore the LUMOback in daily life, which is a 
wearable device measuring pelvic angle and acceleration, for 1 week before the 
initial MDT consultation and for 6 weeks until discharge. The posture scores (%) 
is the proportion of time in a week with neutral pelvic tilt. In this patient, 
the posture score decreased greater than a minimum detectable change of 11.7% 
when MDT classification changed to anterior derangement. Conclusions: This case 
report indicates the importance of sustained loading to identify the correct 
derangement syndrome, and follow-up sessions to confirm or reject the initial 
diagnosis by monitoring symptom and functional changes carefully. Habitual 
posture may be associated with reduction and aggravation of symptoms.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy of patients with limited-stage small cell lung 
cancer (LS-SCLC) continues to rise; thus, characterization of long-term 
toxicities is essential. Although there are emerging data linking cardiac 
irradiation doses with survival for non-small cell lung cancer, there are 
currently minimal data on cardiac-specific mortality (CSM) in LS-SCLC. The goal 
of this investigation was to evaluate CSM between left- and right-sided cases.
METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried 
for stage I-III primary SCLC patients receiving radiotherapy; CSM was compared 
between left- and right-sided diseases. Accounting for mortality from other 
causes, Gray's test compared cumulative incidences of CSM between both groups. 
Multiple multivariate models examined the independent effect of laterality on 
CSM, including the Fine and Gray competing risk model and the Cox proportional 
hazards model.
RESULTS: Of 19,692 patients, 7991 (41%) were left-sided and 11,701 (59%) were 
right-sided. Left-sided patients experienced significantly higher CSM overall 
(3.3% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.004). Laterality was an independent predictor of CSM in 
the overall population in the Fine and Gray competing risk model (p = 0.006) as 
well as the Cox proportional hazards model (p = 0.007). The overall hazard ratio 
for CSM by disease laterality was 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.50). 
Laterality had no statistical association with non-cardiac mortality in the Fine 
and Gray competing risk model (p = 0.130).
CONCLUSIONS: Although causation between radiotherapy and CSM in LS-SCLC cannot 
be stated based on these data, we encourage clinical attentiveness to 
cardiac-sparing radiotherapy for LS-SCLC, along with further investigation 
evaluating dosimetric correlates for cardiotoxicity.

BACKGROUND: Thalassemia minor (Tm) individuals, are generally considered 
healthy. However, the prognosis of Tm individuals has not been extensively 
studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognosis of Tm versus 
controls without β-thalassemia carrier state.
METHODS: A total of 26,006 individuals seeking thalassemia screening at the AOOR 
Villa Sofia-V. Cervello, Palermo (Italy) were retrospectively studied. Logistic 
penalised regression model was used to estimate risk of potential complications 
and survival techniques were used to study mortality.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 4943 Tm and 21,063 controls. Tm was associated 
with significantly higher risks of hospitalisation for cirrhosis (OR 1·94, 95% 
CI 1·30 to 2·90, p = 0·001), kidney disorders (OR 2·11, 95% CI 1·27 to 3·51, 
p = 0·004), cholelithiatis (OR 1·39, 95% CI 1·08 to 1·79, p = 0·010), and mood 
disorders (OR 2·08, 95% CI 1·15 to 3·75, p = 0·015). No statistically difference 
in life expectancy between thalassemia minor and control group was found (HR 
1·090, 95% CI 0·777 to 1·555, p < 0·590; log-rank test p = .426).
CONCLUSION: This study shows that Tm affects the prognosis of Tm carriers 
regarding health expectation. Probably, iron overload and anaemia for several 
years may be at the basis of these effects.

Allergic diseases have increased in developed countries during the past decades. 
A cohort of Slovak children was followed from birth to track allergic symptoms 
dynamics in early childhood. Information on allergic symptoms (atopic 
dermatitis = AD, rhino conjunctivitis = RC, wheezing = Wh, urticaria = Ur) and 
food allergies among children was based on clinical evaluation of children by 
allergists at three developmental stages (infant, toddler, preschool). Out of 
320 cases of allergies, 64 infants, 145 toddlers, and 195 preschool children 
suffered from AD, RC, Wh, Ur, or their combinations (i.e., significant increase 
with age, p < 0.001). AD first appeared in infants, Wh and/or RC rose mainly in 
toddlers, and Ur among preschool children. AD in infants or toddlers disappeared 
in the subsequent developmental stage in approximately one third of all cases. 
Single AD persistence without remission or extension was not common and 
accounted only for 6.9% of AD infants' allergic manifestations. In addition to 
single-symptom allergic diseases, this study also identified several 
combinations of atopic symptoms.Conclusions: The proportion of multi-symptom 
allergies increased while single-symptom forms decreased. The observed temporal 
trends of allergic symptoms correspond to the atopic march. What is Known: • The 
observed temporal trends of allergic symptoms correspond to the atopic march. 
What is New: • Allergic diseases in children were first manifested as single 
forms, with atopic dermatitis (AD) commonly functioning as the "entry point" to 
allergies. • The overall proportion of single-symptom allergic disorders 
decreased over time while the proportion of multi-symptom allergies increased.

The International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) 
standard for full-field electroretinography (ERG) describes a minimum procedure, 
but encourages more extensive testing. This ISCEV extended protocol describes an 
extension to the ERG standard, namely the dark-adapted (DA) red flash ERG. The 
DA red flash ERG can be incorporated conveniently within the ISCEV standard ERG 
protocol after a minimum of 20-min DA and recorded after the DA 0.01 ERG to a 
flash strength of 0.3 phot cd s m-2, eliciting a waveform with two positive 
peaks in healthy individuals. The first positive component is the cone-mediated 
x-wave with a peak at 30-50 ms; the second is a rod-mediated b-wave with a peak 
time of approximately 100 ms. Shorter DA times may be desirable to shorten the 
recording time or to alter the prominence of the early cone-mediated x-wave 
relative to the rod-mediated b-wave. The DA red flash ERG is used to aid the 
diagnosis of achromatopsia (rod monochromacy), cone dystrophy and other forms of 
cone system dysfunction, including "Bradyopsia" (RGS9/R9AP-retinopathy), when 
the DA red flash ERG x-wave is preserved in the absence of ISCEV standard LA 
ERGs. The DA red flash ERG can also help determine the origin of residual DA 
ERGs in cases of severe rod dysfunction, for example in disorders such as 
vitamin A deficiency, fundus albipunctatus (RDH5-retinopathy), Oguchi disease 
(SAG- or GRK1-retinopathy) and some rod-cone dystrophies. To shorter DA periods, 
the x-wave may be elicited without the following rod b-wave, shown to be helpful 
in abbreviated protocols for children.

A sedentary lifestyle has been linked to a number of metabolic disorders that 
have been associated with sub-optimal mitochondrial characteristics and an 
increased risk of premature death. Endurance training can induce an increase in 
mitochondrial content and/or mitochondrial functional qualities, which are 
associated with improved health and well-being and longer life expectancy. It is 
therefore important to better define how manipulating key parameters of an 
endurance training intervention can influence the content and functionality of 
the mitochondrial pool. This review focuses on mitochondrial changes taking 
place following a series of exercise sessions (training-induced mitochondrial 
adaptations), providing an in-depth analysis of the effects of exercise 
intensity and training volume on changes in mitochondrial protein synthesis, 
mitochondrial content and mitochondrial respiratory function. We provide 
evidence that manipulation of different exercise training variables promotes 
specific and diverse mitochondrial adaptations. Specifically, we report that 
training volume may be a critical factor affecting changes in mitochondrial 
content, whereas relative exercise intensity is an important determinant of 
changes in mitochondrial respiratory function. As a consequence, a dissociation 
between training-induced changes in mitochondrial content and mitochondrial 
respiratory function is often observed. We also provide evidence that 
exercise-induced changes are not necessarily predictive of training-induced 
adaptations, we propose possible explanations for the above discrepancies and 
suggestions for future research.

BACKGROUND: Clinical guidance is needed to initiate, continue, and discontinue 
drug treatments near the end of life.
AIM: To identify drugs and drug classes most often adequate, questionable, or 
inadequate for older people at the end of life.
DESIGN: Delphi consensus survey.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Forty European experts in geriatrics, clinical 
pharmacology, and palliative medicine from 10 different countries. Panelists 
were asked to characterize drug classes as "often adequate," "questionable," or 
"often inadequate" for use in older adults aged 75 years or older with an 
estimated life expectancy of ≤ 3 months. We distinguished the continuation of a 
drug class that was previously prescribed from the initiation of a new drug. 
Consensus was considered achieved for a given drug or drug class if the level of 
agreement was ≥ 75%.
RESULTS: The expert panel reached consensus on a set of 14 drug classes deemed 
as "often adequate," 28 drug classes deemed "questionable," and 10 drug classes 
deemed "often inadequate" for continuation during the last 3 months of life. 
Regarding the initiation of new drug treatments, the panel reached consensus on 
a set of 10 drug classes deemed "often adequate," 23 drug classes deemed 
"questionable," and 23 drug classes deemed "often inadequate". Consensus 
remained unachieved for some very commonly prescribed drug treatments (e.g., 
proton-pump inhibitors, furosemide, haloperidol, olanzapine, zopiclone, and 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).
CONCLUSION: In the absence of high-quality evidence from randomized clinical 
trials, these consensus-based criteria provide guidance to rationalize drug 
prescribing for older adults near the end of life.

BACKGROUND: The rate of device replacement in pacemaker recipients has not been 
investigated in detail.
HYPOTHESIS: Current pacemakers with automatic management of atrial and 
ventricular pacing output provide sufficient longevity to minimize replacement 
rate.
METHODS: We considered a cohort of 542 pacemaker patients (age 78 ± 9 years, 60% 
male, 71% de-novo implants) and combined 1-month projected device longevity with 
survival data and late complication rate in a 3-state Markov model tested in 
several Monte Carlo computer simulations. Predetermined subgroups were: age < or 
≥ 70; gender; primary indication to cardiac pacing.
RESULTS: At the 1-month follow-up the reported projected device longevity was 
153 ± 45 months. With these values the proportion of patients expected to 
undergo a device replacement due to battery depletion was higher in patients 
aged <70 (49.9%, range 32.1%-61.9%) than in age ≥70 (24.5%, range 19.9%-28.8%); 
in women (39.9%, range 30.8%-48.1%) than in men (32.0%, range 24.7%-37.5%); in 
sinus node dysfunction (41.5%, range 30.2%-53.0%) than in atrio-ventricular 
block (33.5%, range 27.1-38.8%) or atrial fibrillation with bradycardia (27.9%, 
range 18.5%-37.0%). The expected replacement rate was inversely related to the 
assumed device longevity and depended on age class: a 50% increase in battery 
longevity implied a 5% reduction of replacement rates in patients aged ≥80.
CONCLUSIONS: With current device technology 1/4 of pacemaker recipients aged ≥70 
are expected to receive a second device in their life. Replacement rate depends 
on age, gender, and primary indication owing to differences in patients' 
survival expectancy. Additional improvements in device service time may modestly 
impact expected replacement rates especially in patients ≥80 years.

The monetary value of a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is frequently used to 
assess the benefits of health interventions and inform funding decisions. 
However, there is little consensus on methods for the estimation of this 
monetary value. In this study, we use life satisfaction as an indicator of 
'experienced utility', and estimate the dollar equivalent value of a QALY using 
a fixed effect model with instrumental variable estimators. Using a 
nationally-representative longitudinal survey including 28,347 individuals 
followed during 2002-2015 in Australia, we estimate that individual's 
willingness to pay for one QALY is approximately A$42,000-A$67,000, and the 
willingness to pay for not having a long-term condition approximately A$2000 per 
year. As the estimates are derived using population-level data and a wellbeing 
measurement of life satisfaction, the approach has the advantage of being 
socially inclusive and recognizes the significant meaning of people's subjective 
valuations of health. The method could be particularly useful for nations where 
QALY thresholds are not yet validated or established.

Euthanasia is ending life in a way that minimizes or eliminates pain and 
distress. It requires techniques that induce loss of consciousness followed by 
cardiac and respiratory arrest and loss of brain function. Although euthanasia 
is the objective for uncontrollable animal suffering, it is not always possible. 
Euthanasia of animals using barbiturates or barbituric acid derivatives is 
impractical for situations that require mass euthanasia of multiple animals. 
Selection of the most appropriate disposal method depends on number of 
carcasses, potential environmental impact, climatic conditions, and other 
factors. Preplanning and training are requirements for proper application of 
euthanasia procedures and disposal of carcasses.

PURPOSE: To explore Canadian and Australian community pharmacists' practice 
experiences in caring for people at risk of suicide.
METHODS: We conducted a thematic analysis of 176 responses to an open-ended 
extension question in an online survey.
RESULTS: Four themes were identified and include referrals and triage, 
accessibility for confiding, emotional toll, and stigma. Subthemes included 
gatekeeping the medication supply, sole disclosure, planning for end of life, 
concerns of support people, assessing the validity of suicidality, gaps in the 
system, not directly asking, ill-equipped, resources in the pharmacy, relying on 
others to continue care, and attention seeking.
CONCLUSIONS: Community pharmacists are caring for patients at risk of suicide 
frequently, and often with patients seeking the help of pharmacists directly. 
Pharmacists engage in activities and actions that would be considered outside of 
the traditional dispensing roles and provide support and intervention to people 
at risk of suicide through collaboration and other mechanisms. Further research 
to determine appropriate education and training and postvention supports is 
required.

BACKGROUND: Globally, illness and life expectancy follow a social gradient that 
puts people of lower socioeconomic status (SES) at higher risk of dying 
prematurely. Alcohol consumption has been shown to be a factor contributing to 
socioeconomic differences in mortality. However, little evidence is available 
from low- and middle-income countries. The objective of this study was to 
quantify mortality attributable to alcohol consumption in the adult (15+ years) 
general population of South Africa in 2015 by SES, age, and sex.
METHODS: A comparative risk assessment was performed using individual and 
aggregate data from South Africa and risk relations reported in the literature. 
Alcohol-attributable fractions (AAFs) and alcohol-attributable mortality rates 
were estimated for cause-specific mortality by SES, sex, and age. Monte Carlo 
simulation techniques were used to calculate 95% uncertainty intervals (UI).
RESULTS: Overall, approximately 62,300 (95% UI 27,000-103,000) adults died from 
alcohol-attributable causes in South Africa in 2015, with 60% of deaths 
occurring in people in the low and 15% in the high SES groups. Age-standardized, 
alcohol-attributable mortality rates per 100,000 adults were highest for the low 
SES group (727 deaths, 95% UI 354-1208 deaths) followed by the middle (377 
deaths, 95% UI 165-687 deaths) and high SES groups (163 deaths, 95% UI 71-289 
deaths). The socioeconomic differences were highest for mortality from 
infectious diseases. People of low SES had a lower prevalence of current alcohol 
use but heavier drinking patterns among current drinkers. Among men, AAFs were 
elevated at low and middle SES, particularly for the middle and higher age 
groups (35+). Among women, AAFs differed less across SES groups and, in the 
youngest age group (15-34), women of high SES had elevated AAFs.
CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol use contributed to vast socioeconomic differences in 
mortality. Where observed, elevated AAFs for people of low and middle SES arose 
from higher levels of consumption among current drinkers and not from the 
prevalence of current alcohol use per se. The findings can direct preventive 
measures and interventions on those at highest risk. Future research is needed 
to investigate socioeconomic differences in the risk functions relating alcohol 
use to cause-specific mortality.
