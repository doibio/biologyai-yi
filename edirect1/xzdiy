BACKGROUND: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is one of the most common conditions in 
clinical practice. In spite of its prevalence, FD is associated with major 
uncertainties in terms of its definition, underlying pathophysiology, diagnosis, 
treatment, and prognosis.
METHODS: A Delphi consensus was initiated with 41 experts from 22 European 
countries who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 87 
statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated using the grading of 
recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) criteria. 
Consensus (defined as >80% agreement) was reached for 36 statements.
RESULTS: The panel agreed with the definition in terms of its cardinal symptoms 
(early satiation, postprandial fullness, epigastric pain, and epigastric 
burning), its subdivision into epigastric pain syndrome and postprandial 
distress syndrome, and the presence of accessory symptoms (upper abdominal 
bloating, nausea, belching), and overlapping conditions. Also, well accepted are 
the female predominance of FD, its impact on quality of life and health costs, 
and acute gastrointestinal infections, and anxiety as risk factors. In terms of 
pathophysiological mechanisms, the consensus supports a role for impaired 
gastric accommodation, delayed gastric emptying, hypersensitivity to gastric 
distention, Helicobacter pylori infection, and altered central processing of 
signals from the gastroduodenal region. There is consensus that endoscopy is 
mandatory for establishing a firm diagnosis of FD, but that in primary care, 
patients without alarm symptoms or risk factors can be managed without 
endoscopy. There is consensus that H. pylori status should be determined in 
every patient with dyspeptic symptoms and H. pylori positive patients should 
receive eradication therapy. Also, proton pump inhibitor therapy is considered 
an effective therapy for FD, but no other treatment approach reached a 
consensus. The long-term prognosis and life expectancy are favorable.
CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: A multinational group of European experts summarized 
the current state of consensus on the definition, diagnosis and management of 
FD.

OBJECTIVE: Despite the high burden of vascular disease that is assessed, 
investigated, and managed by generalists, no specific medical school curriculum 
is in use for vascular surgery (VS). In the present scoping review, we aimed to 
map the available evidence on the provision of VS education in the medical 
school curriculum worldwide.
METHODS: The present review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 
(preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) extension 
for scoping reviews. The inclusion criterion was reported research studies on VS 
education in the medical curriculum.
RESULTS: A total of 20 studies were included. Three main themes were identified. 
VS was perceived as an essential part of the general medical student curriculum 
by VS applicants. Exposure to VS varied considerably, and students generally 
expressed a need for an increase in VS coverage. The most important positive 
determinants when choosing VS as a career were having a VS mentor, the technical 
aspects of VS, and participation in a VS rotation. Frequently cited deterrents 
were the long training time and demanding lifestyle potentially compromising 
family life.
CONCLUSIONS: The present scoping review has provided a starting point to better 
understand the provision of VS education in medical schools across the world. 
Our review has demonstrated the variability in VS exposure at medical school and 
described students' sentiments toward VS. We have highlighted the need to 
determine whether the current curricula are adequate from the perspective of 
multiple stakeholders (eg, vascular surgeons, educators, general practitioners, 
a variety of specialists) with a crucial role in the treatment of patients with 
vascular conditions.

BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are an increasing public 
health threat. Measuring disease burden in disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) allows the combination of morbidity and mortality into one figure, as it 
represents the summation of years lived with disability and years of life lost.
AIM: To evaluate the incidence, attributable deaths and burden of the most 
significant HAIs in Italy.
METHODS: Prevalence data from the study sample of the 2016 national Point 
Prevalence Survey of HAIs in acute-care settings were used to estimate the 
incidence of five HAIs. The methodology from the Burden of Communicable Diseases 
in Europe (BCoDE)-project was employed for DALY calculations, adapting the 
disease models to the Italian population.
FINDINGS: We estimated a total of 641,065 (95% uncertainty interval, UI 
585,543.00-699,207.90) new yearly cases of HAIs and 29,375 (95% UI 
23,705.97-35,905.80) deaths in Italy in 2016. The total annual DALYs were 
estimated to be 424,657.45 (95% UI 346,240.35-513,357.28), corresponding to 
702.53 DALYs (95% UI 575.22-844.66) per 100,000 general population. Bloodstream 
infections accounted for the majority of total DALYs (59%), 
healthcare-associated pneumonia for 29%, surgical site infections for 9%, CDI 
for 2% and urinary tract infections accounted for less than 1% of total DALYs.
CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest HAIs have a substantial burden in 
Italy. Reducing the burden of HAIs through infection prevention and control 
efforts is an achievable goal. This study provides data that could be used to 
guide policy-makers in the implementation of these measures.

Safer spaces: The impact of a reduction in road fatalities on the life 
expectancy of South Africans.

In this paper we determine the burden on society of fatalities resulting from 
road traffic injuries (RTIs) in South Africa. We express the burden in terms of 
reduced life expectancy and years of potential life lost (YPLL). Our main data 
source is the Injury Mortality Survey (IMS), a retrospective descriptive study 
carried out in South Africa. Using the mortality rates by sex and age from the 
IMS we calculate actual life expectancy at birth. In our counterfactual analysis 
we assume a 15 % reduction in road fatalities per year over a period of 10 
years. A comparison of the estimated actual and counterfactual life expectancies 
suggests that the average gain in life expectancy at birth would be 0.58 years. 
Since the overwhelming majority of road traffic fatalities are male (75.7 %), 
there is a considerable gender difference. Men would gain on average 0.85 years 
while women would gain 0.30 years in life expectancy, closing the gender gap in 
life expectancy by about 14 %. We then discuss how a reduction in RTIs could be 
achieved. South Africa's legislation addresses several of the important aspects 
of road safety (e.g. seat belt use, drink driving restrictions, speed limits, 
infrastructure improvements), however, enforcement is relatively weak and should 
be improved. There are a raft of measures that have been well researched in 
other countries, most interventions aim to modify the behaviour of road users 
and have been found to be cost effective. In addition to stricter enforcement, 
evidence from social science suggests that compliance could be increased through 
a change in social norms regarding road usage.

INTRODUCTION: Telotristat ethyl is indicated for use in combination with 
somatostatin analogs (SSAs) to treat carcinoid syndrome (CS) diarrhea 
uncontrolled by SSAs alone in adults, but long-term safety and efficacy data 
beyond 48 weeks are needed.
OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to evaluate the long-term safety and 
tolerability of telotristat ethyl and its effect on quality of life (QOL) in 
patients with CS.
METHODS: In this phase 3, nonrandomized, multicenter, open-label, long-term 
extension study (TELEPATH), patients who participated in phase 2 or 3 trials of 
telotristat ethyl continued treatment at their present dose level (250 or 500 mg 
thrice daily) for 84 weeks. Safety and tolerability, the primary endpoint, were 
assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, AEs of special 
interest (AESIs; including liver-related AEs, depression, and gastrointestinal 
AEs), and deaths. The secondary objective was to evaluate changes in patients' 
QOL using validated cancer questionnaires and a subjective global assessment of 
CS symptoms.
RESULTS: In 124 patients exposed to telotristat ethyl for a mean of 102.6 ± 53.2 
weeks, the type and frequency of AEs were consistent with those reported in 
previous trials. The occurrence of AESIs was not related to dosage or duration 
of therapy. Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity, and no deaths were 
related to telotristat ethyl. QOL scores remained stable, and the majority of 
patients reported adequate symptom relief throughout the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Safety results of TELEPATH support the long-term use of telotristat 
ethyl in patients with CS diarrhea. Telotristat ethyl was well-tolerated and 
associated with sustained improvement in QOL scores (NCT02026063).

BACKGROUND: Old age is associated with a significantly increased mortality in 
COVID-19 patients exposed to long-term controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) 
and suggested to be due to the hyperinflammatory response associated with the 
viral infection. However, our understanding of age-related differences in the 
response to CMV in the absence of a viral infection remains insufficient.
METHODS: Young (7-8 months) and old (28-32 months) F344 BN hybrid rats were 
exposed to the ICU condition for 5 days, i.e., complete immobilization, 
mechanical ventilation, and extensive monitoring. Transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) and 
proteomics (Proximity Extension Assay) analyses of the diaphragm and proteomics 
analysis of plasma were conducted to investigate the molecular differences 
between young and old rats exposed to the ICU condition.
RESULTS: According to multi-omics analyses, significant differences were 
observed in the diaphragm between young and old rats in response to 5 days CMV 
and immobilization. In young rats, metabolic pathways were primarily 
downregulated in response to immobilization (post-synaptic blockade of 
neuromuscular transmission). In old rats, on the other hand, dramatic immune and 
inflammatory responses were observed, i.e., an upregulation of specific related 
pathways such as "IL-17 signaling pathway", along with a higher level of 
inflammatory factors and cytokine/chemokine in plasma.
CONCLUSIONS: The dramatically increased mortality in old ICU patients with 
COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation and cytokine storm need not only reflect 
the viral infection but may also be associated with the ventilator induced 
diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD) and hyperinflammatory responses induced by 
long-term CMV per se. Although mechanical ventilation is a life-saving 
intervention in COVID-19 ICU patients, CMV should be cautiously used especially 
in old age and other means of respiratory support may be considered, such as 
negative pressure ventilation.

Chronic pulmonary methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) disease in 
cystic fibrosis (CF) has a high probability of recurrence following treatment 
with standard-of-care antibiotics and represents an area of unmet need 
associated with reduced life expectancy. We developed a lipoglycopeptide therapy 
customized for pulmonary delivery that not only demonstrates potent activity 
against planktonic MRSA, but also against protected colonies of MRSA in biofilms 
and within cells, the latter of which have been linked to clinical antibiotic 
failure. A library of next-generation potent lipoglycopeptides was synthesized 
with an emphasis on attaining superior pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
pharmacodynamics to similar compounds of their class. Our strategy focused on 
hydrophobic modification of vancomycin, where ester and amide functionality were 
included with carbonyl configuration and alkyl length as key variables. 
Candidates representative of each carbonyl attachment chemistry demonstrated 
potent activity in vitro, with several compounds being 30 to 60 times more 
potent than vancomycin. Selected compounds were advanced into in vivo nose-only 
inhalation PK evaluations in rats, where RV94, a potent lipoglycopeptide that 
utilizes an inverted amide linker to attach a 10-carbon chain to vancomycin, 
demonstrated the most favorable lung residence time after inhalation. Further in 
vitro evaluation of RV94 showed superior activity to vancomycin against an 
expanded panel of Gram-positive organisms, cellular accumulation and efficacy 
against intracellular MRSA, and MRSA biofilm killing. Moreover, in vivo efficacy 
of inhaled nebulized RV94 in a 48 h acute model of pulmonary MRSA (USA300) 
infection in neutropenic rats demonstrated statistically significant 
antibacterial activity that was superior to inhaled vancomycin.

OBJECTIVE: Identification of patients with shortened life expectancy is a major 
obstacle to delivering palliative/end-of-life care. We previously developed the 
modified Hospitalised-patient One-year Mortality Risk (mHOMR) model for the 
automated identification of patients with an elevated 1-year mortality risk. Our 
goal was to investigate whether patients identified by mHOMR at high risk for 
mortality in the next year also have unmet palliative needs.
METHOD: We conducted a prospective observational study at two quaternary 
healthcare facilities in Toronto, Canada, with patients admitted to general 
internal medicine service and identified by mHOMR to have an expected 1-year 
mortality risk of 10% or more. We measured patients' unmet palliative needs-a 
severe uncontrolled symptom on the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale or 
readiness to engage in advance care planning (ACP) based on Sudore's ACP 
Engagement Survey.
RESULTS: Of 518 patients identified by mHOMR, 403 (78%) patients consented to 
participate; 87% of those had either a severe uncontrolled symptom or readiness 
to engage in ACP, and 44% had both. Patients represented frailty (38%), cancer 
(28%) and organ failure (28%) trajectories were admitted for a median of 6 days, 
and 94% survived to discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: A large majority of hospitalised patients identified by mHOMR have 
unmet palliative needs, regardless of disease, and are identified early enough 
in their disease course that they may benefit from a palliative approach to 
their care. Adoption of such a model could improve the timely introduction of a 
palliative approach for patients, especially those with non-cancer illness.

The need for precision medicine approaches to monitor health and disease makes 
it important to develop sensitive and accurate assays for proteome profiles in 
blood. Here, we describe an approach for plasma profiling based on proximity 
extension assay combined with next generation sequencing. First, we analyze the 
variability of plasma profiles between and within healthy individuals in a 
longitudinal wellness study, including the influence of genetic variations on 
plasma levels. Second, we follow patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 
before and during therapeutic intervention using plasma proteome profiling. The 
studies show that healthy individuals have a unique and stable proteome profile 
and indicate that a panel of proteins could potentially be used for early 
diagnosis of diabetes, including stratification of patients with regards to 
response to metformin treatment. Although validation in larger cohorts is 
needed, the analysis demonstrates the usefulness of comprehensive plasma 
profiling for precision medicine efforts.

Morels are some of the most highly prized edible and medicinal mushrooms, with 
great economic and scientific value. Outdoor cultivation has been achieved and 
expanded on a large scale in China in recent years. Sclerotial formation is one 
of the most important phases during the morel life cycle, and previous reports 
indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role. However, 
ROS response mechanisms at sclerotial initiation (SI) stage are poorly 
understood. In this study, comparative transcriptome analyses were performed 
with sclerotial and hyphal cells at different areas in the same plate at SI 
stage. Gene expression was significantly different at SI stage between 
sclerotial formation and mycelia growth areas. GO and KEGG analyses indicated 
more vigorous metabolic characteristics in the hyphae area, while transcription 
process, DNA repair, and protein processing were enriched in sclerotial cells. 
Gene expression related to H2O2 production was high in the hyphae area, while 
expression of H2O2-scavenging genes was high in sclerotial cells, leading to a 
higher H2O2 concentration in the hyphal region than in the sclerotium. Minor 
differences were observed in gene expression of H2O2-induced signaling pathway 
in sclerotial and hyphal cells; however, expression levels of the target genes 
of transcription factor MSN2, important in the H2O2-induced signaling pathways, 
were significantly different. MSN2 enhanced stress response regulation in 
sclerotia by regulating these target genes. Small molecular HSPs were also found 
upregulated in sclerotial cells. This study indicated that sclerotial cells are 
more resistant to ROS stress than hyphal cells through transcriptional 
regulation of related genes.

Investigating Factors of Active Aging Among Chinese Older Adults: A Machine 
Learning Approach.

USA.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With the extension of healthy life expectancy, 
promoting active aging has become a policy response to rapid population aging in 
China. Yet, it has been inconclusive about the relative importance of the 
determinants of active aging. By applying a machine learning approach, this 
study aims to identify the most important determinants of active aging in 3 
domains, i.e., paid/unpaid work, caregiving, and social activities, among 
Chinese older adults.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were drawn from the first wave of the China 
Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, which surveys a nationally 
representative sample of adults aged 60 years and older (N = 7,503). We 
estimated Random Forest and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
regression models (LASSO) to determine the most important factors related to 
active aging.
RESULTS: Health has a generic effect on all outcomes of active aging. Our 
findings also identified the domain-specific determinants of active aging. 
Urban/rural residency is among the most important factors determining the 
likelihood of engaging in paid/unpaid work. Living in a multigenerational 
household is especially important in predicting caregiving activities. 
Neighborhood infrastructure and facilities have the strongest influence on older 
adults' participation in social activities.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The application of feature selection models 
provides a fruitful first step in identifying the most important determinants of 
active aging among Chinese older adults. These results provide evidence-based 
recommendations for policies and practices promoting active aging.

OBJECTIVES: Health state utilities (HSUs) are an input metric for estimating 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) in cost-utility analyses. Currently, there is 
a paucity of data on association of knee symptoms with HSUs for middle-aged 
populations. We aimed to describe the association of knee symptoms and change in 
knee symptoms with SF-6D HSUs and described the distribution of HSUs against 
knee symptoms' severity.
METHODS: Participants (36-49-years) were selected from the third follow-up 
(completed 2019) of Australian Childhood Determinants of Adult Health study. 
SF-6D HSUs were generated from the participant-reported SF-12. Association 
between participant-reported WOMAC knee symptoms' severity, change in knee 
symptoms over 6-9 years, and HSUs were evaluated using linear regression models.
RESULTS: For the cross-sectional analysis, 1,567 participants were included; 
mean age 43.5 years, female 54%, BMI ± SD 27.18 ± 5.31 kg/m2. Mean ± SD HSUs for 
normal, moderate, and severe WOMAC scores were 0.820 ± 0.120, 0.800 ± 0.120, and 
0.740 ± 0.130, respectively. A significant association was observed between 
worsening knee symptoms and HSUs in univariable and multivariable analyses after 
adjustment (age and sex). HSU decrement for normal-to-severe total-WOMAC and 
WOMAC-pain was - 0.080 (95% CI - 0.100 to - 0.060, p < 0.01) and - 0.067 (- 
0.085 to - 0.048, p < 0.01), exceeding the mean minimal clinically important 
difference (0.04). Increase in knee pain over 6-9 years was associated with a 
significant reduction in HSU.
CONCLUSION: In a middle-aged population-based sample, there was an independent 
negative association between worse knee symptoms and SF-6D HSUs. Our findings 
may be used by decision-makers to define more realistic and conservative 
baseline and ongoing HSU values when assessing QALY changes associated with 
osteoarthritis interventions.

BACKGROUND: Statistical evidence on breast cancer (BC) burden related to health 
and lifestyle risk factors are valuable for health policy-making. This study 
aimed to compare the trends in BC mortality and disability adjusted life years 
(DALYs) attributable to various health and life style risk factors among 
different world's regions according to sociodemographic index (SDI).
METHODS: We extracted the age-standardized and age-specific rate of mortality 
and DALYs of women BC during 1990-2017 using the comparative risk assessment 
framework of the 2017 global burden of disease (GBD) study. We performed 
hierarchical age-period-cohort analysis to estimate age- and time-related 
trends, and effect of interactions between different risk factors on BC risk.
RESULTS: During 1990-2017, the age-standardized rate of mortality and DALYs of 
women BC was increasing in less developed and under developing regions. The risk 
factor alcohol use [RR 51.3(95%CI 17.6-149.7)] and smoking [5.9(2.0-17.3)] were 
significantly highly contributor to increased mortality risk in high SDI region. 
Whereas in the low-SDI region, the greater mortality risk was observed in 
alcohol use [6.9(2.4-17)] and high FPG [2.7(1.5-3.1)]-related deaths. The 
adjusting for individual age, period, and risk factor effects, the significant 
interaction effect between metabolic risk factors and older ages were observed 
in all SDI regions and globally as well. However, an increasing cohort effect of 
alcohol, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and smoking-related death, and DALYs 
was observed during 1960 to 1985 cohorts among low-SDI regions.
CONCLUSIONS: The age-standardized rates of mortality and DALYs due to BC has 
been increasing in low-SDI region. Alcohol consumption, high body mass index 
(BMI), high FPG, and smoking are potential BC risk factors particularly in older 
ages that leading to adverse disease outcomes. Therefore, rapid aging and 
prevalence of these prospective risk factors may strengthen the increasing 
mortality and DALYs of BC in low-SDI region. Hence, preventive measure along 
with strict action against concerned BC risk factors should be taken to reduce 
the disease burden specifically among lower-SDI regions.

Brain organoids: A promising model to assess oxidative stress-induced central 
nervous system damage.

Oxidative stress (OS) is one of the most significant propagators of systemic 
damage with implications for widespread pathologies such as vascular disease, 
accelerated aging, degenerative disease, inflammation, and traumatic injury. OS 
can be induced by numerous factors such as environmental conditions, lifestyle 
choices, disease states, and genetic susceptibility. It is tied to the 
accumulation of free radicals, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insufficient 
antioxidant protection, which leads to cell aging and tissue degeneration over 
time. Unregulated systemic increase in reactive species, which contain harmful 
free radicals, can lead to diverse tissue-specific OS responses and disease. 
Studies of OS in the brain, for example, have demonstrated how this state 
contributes to neurodegeneration and altered neural plasticity. As the worldwide 
life expectancy has increased over the last few decades, the prevalence of 
OS-related diseases resulting from age-associated progressive tissue 
degeneration. Unfortunately, vital translational research studies designed to 
identify and target disease biomarkers in human patients have been impeded by 
many factors (e.g., limited access to human brain tissue for research purposes 
and poor translation of experimental models). In recent years, stem cell-derived 
three-dimensional tissue cultures known as "brain organoids" have taken the 
spotlight as a novel model for studying central nervous system (CNS) diseases. 
In this review, we discuss the potential of brain organoids to model the 
responses of human neural cells to OS, noting current and prospective 
limitations. Overall, brain organoids show promise as an innovative 
translational model to study CNS susceptibility to OS and elucidate the 
pathophysiology of the aging brain.

BACKGROUND: To plan for cancer services in the future, the long view of cancer 
prevalence is essential. It might be suspected that cancer prevalence before 
tobacco and industrial revolution pollutants was quite different to today.
METHODS: To quantify the degree to which cancer prevalence may be changing over 
time, the authors analyzed 143 skeletons from 6 cemeteries from the Cambridge 
area (6th-16th centuries). Visual inspection coupled with screening using both 
plain radiographs and computed tomography scans was used to detect malignant 
lesions.
RESULTS: A total of 3.5% of individuals showed evidence for metastases. 
Factoring in modern data for the proportion of those with cancer that die with 
bone metastases, this suggests a minimum prevalence of all cancers at the time 
of death in medieval Britain to be approximately 9% to 14% of adults.
CONCLUSIONS: This figure compares with a 40% to 50% prevalence of cancer at the 
time of death for modern Britain. The difference may be explained by the effects 
of modern carcinogens, the spread of viruses that trigger malignancy, industrial 
pollutants, and longer life expectancy.
LAY SUMMARY: Until now, no one has been able to work out how common cancer was 
before the time people were exposed to tumor-inducing chemicals from tobacco and 
industrial factories. In this novel study, the authors have determined the 
percentage of people living in medieval Britain who had cancer metastases to 
bone at the time of their death and then compared that with modern data. It was 
found that cancer was approximately 25% as common in medieval times as it is 
today. This article suggests cancer was much more widespread in medieval times 
than was previously realized.

BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) cause premature mortality among 
youth. Associated with lifestyle and behavioural choices, these diseases and 
deaths can and should be prevented among young people. This article presents 
data showing the gains in life expectancy among youth in the absence of NCD 
causes of death.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the levels of NCD mortality among youth (15 - 24 years 
of age) in South Africa (SA) and show the current and projected additional years 
of life gained with the elimination of heart disease, cancer and diabetes.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using 20 years of death notification 
forms from SA (1997 - 2016). The data were nationally representative and the 
sample was 62 395 youth deaths (age 15 - 24 years) from the selected NCDs. 
Cause-specific mortality rates, expressed as percentages, were estimated by age 
group and sex. Cause-deleted life-table techniques were used to estimate current 
and projected life expectancy (ex) and life expectancy in the absence of 
specific NCDs (e-ix).
RESULTS: Death rates from NCDs are increasing over time among youth. Total death 
rates from cancer increased from 1.09% in 1997 - 2001 to 1.51% in 2012 - 2016. 
Female death rates from heart disease are almost double those for males. The 
number of additional years of life gained with elimination of these causes 
ranges from 2.2 to 10.3. Projected life expectancies show that males could gain 
as much as 1 additional year and females 1.06 years by 2035.
CONCLUSIONS: Urgent action needs to be taken to prevent further mortality from 
non-communicable causes among youth. The results of this study are important to 
the SA healthcare system and to public health practitioners whose aim is to 
reduce the strain on public resources and reduce mortality among youth. Future 
studies should estimate the extent of NCD mortality in households and 
communities with the aim of developing macro-level interventions.

Both shorter telomeres and schizophrenia have been associated with a decrease in 
life expectancy. Furthermore, several studies found a shorter telomere length 
(TL) in schizophrenia. Understanding whether or not telomere shortening is 
directly related to pathophysiology of schizophrenia or is a consequence of a 
cumulative exposure to chronic stress is of major importance. Comparing the TL 
of subjects at the very beginning of the disease (FEP) and control subjects 
could help to decide between these two hypotheses. The aim of the present study 
was to compare TL between FEP subjects (N=91) and controls (N=137). After 
accounting for multiple potential confounders, no significant association was 
observed between FEP and TL. Our result is consistent with the hypothesis that 
psycho-social stress / adversities and stressful situations in people with 
schizophrenia affect TL rather than that telomere erosion contributes to the 
development of this disorder.

Neoplasms derived from follicular tissue are extremely rare. Clinically, they 
are reported as non-symptomatic, slow-growing nodules. These lesions are mainly 
benign, but the malignant type can occur. Mainly middle-aged people (50-60 years 
of age) are affected. These carcinomas are mainly localized on the head and neck 
or torso. They can be locally aggressive and infiltrate surrounding tissue and 
metastasize to regional lymph nodes. In the minority of cases, distant 
metastases are diagnosed. Quick and relevant diagnosis is the basis of a 
treatment for all types of tumors. The patient's life expectancy depends on 
multiple prognostic factors, including the primary tumor size and its mitotic 
count. Patients should be referred to a specialized skin cancer center to 
receive optimal multidisciplinary treatment. This article tries to summarize all 
the information that is currently available about pathogenesis, diagnosis, and 
treatment methods of follicular tumors.
