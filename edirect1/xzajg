(QALYs). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were constructed to represent 
uncertainty around cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Rehabilitation (regardless of whether Indiv-rehab or Grp-rehab) cost 
224 pounds (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 184 pounds, 262 pounds) more per 
person than usual primary care. The probability of rehabilitation being more 
cost-effective than usual primary care was 90% if decision makers were willing 
to pay 1,900 pounds for improvements in functioning. Indiv-rehab cost 314 
pounds/person and Grp-rehab 125 pounds/person. Indiv-rehab cost 189 pounds (95% 
CI 168 pounds, 208 pounds) more per person than Grp-rehab. The probability of 
Indiv-rehab being more cost-effective than Grp-rehab increased as willingness to 
pay (WTP) increased, reaching 50% probability at WTP 5,500 pounds. The lack of 
differences in QALYs across the arms led to lower probabilities of 
cost-effectiveness based on this outcome.
CONCLUSION: Provision of ESCAPE-knee pain had small cost implications, but it 
was more likely to be cost-effective in improving function than usual primary 
care. Group rehabilitation reduces costs without compromising clinical 
effectiveness, increasing probability of cost-effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Patients with renal insufficiency tend to suffer from advanced 
atherosclerosis and exhibit a reduced life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: This prospective study investigated the relation between 
renal dysfunction and long-term all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a 
population of nonsurgical patients with lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 357 patients with symptomatic LEAD underwent 
baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation by the 4-variable 
Modification Diet in Renal Diseases equation, and were then followed for 4.2 
years (range: 1-17).
RESULTS: During follow-up, 131 patients died (8.6 deaths per 100 patient-years), 
79 of whom (60%) from cardiovascular causes. All-cause death rates were 3.8, 
6.6, and 15.5 per 100 patient-years, respectively, in the groups with normal 
GFR, mild reduction in GFR (60-89 mL min(-1) per 1.73 m2) and chronic kidney 
disease (CKD; <60 mL min(-1) per 1.73 m2; P < 0.001 by log-rank test). Compared 
to patients with normal renal function, the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular 
death was significantly higher in patients with CKD [hazard ratio, respectively, 
2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16-4.34, P = 0.017; 2.15, 95% CI: 
1.05-4.43, P = 0.03]. The association of CKD with all-cause and cardiovascular 
mortality were independent of age, LEAD severity, cardiovascular risk factors 
and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, 
hypolipidaemic and antiplatelet drugs. The power of GFR in predicting all-cause 
death was higher than that of ankle-brachial pressure index (P = 0.029) and 
Framingham risk score (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Chronic kidney disease strongly predicts long-term mortality in 
patients with symptomatic LEAD irrespective of disease severity, cardiovascular 
risk factors and concomitant treatments.

Cape Town, South Africa. was@telkomsa.net

BACKGROUND: The cost effective treatment of cancer in developing countries 
remains challenging. In the elderly with possible limited life expectancy, the 
health expenditure associated with standard treatment regimes should be 
carefully considered. We present the results of conservative management of 
breast cancer in the aged in a resource-limited environment.
METHODS: Patients aged 70 or older with early breast cancer were treated with 
tumour excision or simple mastectomy and adjuvant tamoxifen. The records of 
patients presenting to the Breast Unit between January 1990 and December 2004 
were retrieved and demographic, clinical, pathological and oncological data were 
reviewed. Survival statistics were calculated using the life table method.
RESULTS: A total of 483 patients above 70 years of age were identified. One 
hundred and eighty eight patients were managed according to the conservative 
protocol. Forty-one had a simple mastectomy and 147 tumour excision. Their mean 
age was 77.3 years. The mean follow-up is 62 months. Thirty-one patients (16.4%) 
were not compliant with tamoxifen use. TNM staging was 0 in 4 patients, I in 42 
patients, II in 116 patients and III in 26 patients. There was no 30-day 
mortality. The cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 3.3% at 5 and 10 
years. The cumulative incidence of regional recurrence was 3.3% at 5 years and 
4.5% at 10 years. The cumulative incidence of distant recurrence was 6.2% at 5 
years and 12.2% at 10 years. The cumulative overall, disease specific and 
disease free survival at 10 years was 59%, 88% and 81% respectively.
CONCLUSION: Limited surgery and tamoxifen provide excellent control of breast 
cancer in the elderly in a resource restricted environment. Radiotherapy and 
axillary dissection and can be safely omitted thereby reducing health care 
resource utilization.

Glucose restriction extends Caenorhabditis elegans life span by inducing 
mitochondrial respiration and increasing oxidative stress.

Increasing cellular glucose uptake is a fundamental concept in treatment of type 
2 diabetes, whereas nutritive calorie restriction increases life expectancy. We 
show here that increased glucose availability decreases Caenorhabditis elegans 
life span, while impaired glucose metabolism extends life expectancy by inducing 
mitochondrial respiration. The histone deacetylase Sir2.1 is found here to be 
dispensable for this phenotype, whereas disruption of aak-2, a homolog of 
AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK), abolishes extension of life span due to impaired 
glycolysis. Reduced glucose availability promotes formation of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), induces catalase activity, and increases oxidative stress 
resistance and survival rates, altogether providing direct evidence for a 
hitherto hypothetical concept named mitochondrial hormesis or "mitohormesis." 
Accordingly, treatment of nematodes with different antioxidants and vitamins 
prevents extension of life span. In summary, these data indicate that glucose 
restriction promotes mitochondrial metabolism, causing increased ROS formation 
and cumulating in hormetic extension of life span, questioning current 
treatments of type 2 diabetes as well as the widespread use of antioxidant 
supplements.

Cost-effectiveness of screening and vaccinating Asian and Pacific Islander 
adults for hepatitis B.

Hutton DW(1), Tan D, So SK, Brandeau ML.

Author information:
(1)Stanford University, Asian Liver Center, and Stanford University School of 
Medicine, Stanford, California 94305-4026, USA.

BACKGROUND: As many as 10% of Asian and Pacific Islander adults in the United 
States are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and up to two 
thirds are unaware that they are infected. Without proper medical management and 
antiviral therapy, up to 25% of Asian and Pacific Islander persons with chronic 
HBV infection will die of liver disease.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of 4 HBV screening and vaccination 
programs for Asian and Pacific Islander adults in the United States.
DESIGN: Markov model with costs and benefits discounted at 3%.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature and expert opinion.
TARGET POPULATION: Asian and Pacific Islander adults (base-case age, 40 years; 
sensitivity analysis conducted on ages 20 to 60 years).
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: U.S. societal.
INTERVENTIONS: A universal vaccination strategy in which all individuals are 
given a 3-dose vaccination series; a screen-and-treat strategy, in which 
individuals are given blood tests to determine whether they are chronically 
infected, and infected persons are monitored and treated; a screen, treat, and 
ring vaccinate strategy, in which all individuals are tested for chronic HBV 
infection and close contacts of infected persons are screened and vaccinated if 
needed; and a screen, treat, and vaccinate strategy, in which all individuals 
are tested and then vaccinated with a 3-dose series if needed. In all cases, 
persons found to be chronically infected are monitored and treated if indicated.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs (2006 U.S. dollars), quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with the status quo, the 
screen-and-treat strategy has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $36,088 
per QALY gained. The screen, treat, and ring vaccinate strategy gains more QALYs 
than the screen and treat strategy and incurs modest incremental costs, leading 
to incremental cost-effectiveness of $39,903 per QALY gained compared with the 
screen and treat strategy. The universal vaccination and screen, treat, and 
vaccinate strategies were weakly dominated by the other 2 strategies.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Over a wide range of variables, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of the screen and treat and screen, treat, and ring 
vaccinate strategies were less than $50,000 per QALY gained.
LIMITATIONS: Results depend on the accuracy of the underlying data and 
assumptions. The long-term effectiveness of new and future HBV treatments is 
uncertain.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening programs for HBV among Asian and Pacific Islander adults 
are likely to be cost effective. Clinically significant benefits accrue from 
identifying chronically infected persons for medical management and vaccinating 
their close contacts. Such efforts can greatly reduce the burden of 
HBV-associated liver cancer and chronic liver disease in the Asian and Pacific 
Islander population.

Patient satisfaction and quality of life among persons attending chronic disease 
clinics in South Trinidad, West Indies.

Joseph C(1), Nichols S.

Author information:
(1)Department of Agricultural Economics and Extension, The University of the 
West Indies, St Agustine, Trinidad and Tobago.

OBJECTIVE: Patient satisfaction and quality of life are increasingly being 
recognized as central elements in the monitoring and evaluation of healthcare. 
In this survey, the level of patient satisfaction and quality of life were 
investigated in regular attendees at public health chronic disease facilities in 
South Trinidad.
METHOD: A random sample of 200 clients attending the three public chronic 
disease clinics during the period August 12, 2002 to December 31, 2002, 
completed self-administered questionnaires consisting of socio-demographic, 
quality of life (SF 12) and health service items.
RESULTS: Participants had an average of four annual visits and 75% of them were 
50 years and older. Approximately two-thirds of participants gave health and 
support staff a rating of good to excellent. Overall clinic experience was rated 
as poor to fair by 41.5%. Forty-five and a half per cent gave a rating of the 
explanations given by doctors and nurses about their illnesses. Fifty-three and 
a half per cent and 58% gave a poor to fair rating for the length of the waiting 
time and explanation offered when there was a significant delay in the starting 
times of clinics respectively. In regression analyses controlling for age, 
gender and number of illnesses, ratings of clinic experience and all categories 
of clinic staff were significantly associated with SF-12 mental and physical 
component summary scores.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that in this population of regular clinic 
attendees, levels of client satisfaction and numbers of illnesses are associated 
with subjective quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody, which has 
demonstrated significant activity in metastatic colorectal cancer. The aim of 
this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding bevacizumab to 
chemotherapy for patients with untreated metastatic colorectal cancer.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs 
and benefits of adding bevacizumab to irinotecan plus FU/LV (IFL) or 5-FU/LV 
alone. Effectiveness outcomes, health utilities and resource use data were 
derived from recent bevacizumab RCTs and from the literature.
RESULTS: Adding bevacizumab to IFL costs approximately pound62,857 per QALY 
gained. Adding bevacizumab to 5-FU/LV costs approximately pound88,436 per QALY 
gained. The acquisition cost of bevacizumab is a key determinant of its 
cost-effectiveness. The probability that bevacizumab has a cost-effectiveness 
ratio that is better than pound30,000 per QALY gained is close to zero.
CONCLUSIONS: Given high acquisition costs in relation to clinical benefits, 
bevacizumab is unlikely to represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources.

Mechanical stress and formation of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative 
disorders.

Misfolded protein aggregates and inclusion bodies have been associated with 
various protein conformation disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and prion 
diseases including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Models have been 
proposed as plausible explanations for the extension and progression of protein 
aggregates; however, little is known about the initiation process of protein 
aggregation, particularly in sporadic neurodegenerative diseases. 
Epidemiological data have suggested a tight association between sporadic 
neurodegenerative diseases and history of mechanical stresses such as trauma, 
head injury, and occupational exposures, including professional soccer and 
boxer's brain that carries histological hallmarks of AD/PD. Here, we propose 
that mechanical stress is an environmental factor that provokes a disturbance in 
cellular quality control systems and molecular chaperones that target misfolded 
proteins. This subsequently initiates protein aggregation and results in 
sporadic neurodegenerative disorders. Further, continuous and repetitive 
exposure to environmental mechanical stress, mostly in an unrecognized manner, 
is inevitable in daily life and thus, it functions as a potential driving force 
for protein aggregation. In this regard, a recent identification of the fact 
that an intracellular mechanosensor actually exists may support our notion. 
Reduction in the mechanical stress in combination with other conventional 
aspects should facilitate the development of rational therapeutics for these 
neurodegenerative disorders.

Therapeutic challenges for systemic sclerosis: facts and future targets.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an important cause of death in systemic 
sclerosis (SSc), despite the improvement of therapies. An early diagnosis and 
the use of drugs interfering with the main pathogenic pathways of PAH is pivotal 
for the improvement of prognosis in primary PAH and PAH secondary to autoimmune 
rheumatic diseases, mainly SSc. Lately, new specific therapies have been 
developed targeting prostacyclin, endothelin, and nitric oxide pathways, the 
major pathogenic pathways leading to endothelial dysfunction in PAH. 
Epoprostenol improved life expectancy of patients with primary and secondary 
PAH, but its continuous intravenous administration requires experienced centers. 
More stable analogues of prostacyclin, administrated by intravenous (iloprost, 
treprostinil), subcutaneous, inhalatory (treprostinil, iloprost), and oral route 
(Beraprost) have shown efficacy in PAH. Bosentan, the first oral endothelin 
receptor antagonist (with affinity for endothelin A and B receptors) improves 
exercise function and survival in PAH, both primary and secondary to autoimmune 
rheumatic diseases. This is confirmed also for Sitaxsentan and Ambrisentan, 
selective A receptor antagonists. Because of its short half-life and systemic 
side effects, short-term NO inhalation is used only in short-term management of 
PAH in critically ill adults. Inhibitors of NO degradation, such as sildenafil, 
a phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 5 inhibitor, improved functional and hemodynamic 
parameters without significant side effects. Vardenafil and taladafil, 
longer-acting PDE inhibitors, also have vascular pulmonary selectivity. All 
these drugs may be used in combination, to maximize their clinical benefit not 
only in patients unresponsive to single drugs, but also potentially as initial 
therapy of PAH.

A clinical and economic evaluation of endoscopic ultrasound for patients at risk 
for familial pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Approximately 10% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is familial. 
Approximately 50% of 1st-degree relatives (FDRs) have endoscopic ultrasound 
(EUS) findings of chronic pancreatitis. We modeled the natural history of these 
patients to compare 4 management strategies.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review, and created a Markov model for 
45-year-old male FDRs, with findings of chronic pancreatitis on screening EUS. 
We compared 4 strategies: doing nothing, prophylactic total pancreatectomy 
(PTP), annual surveillance by EUS, and annual surveillance with EUS and fine 
needle aspiration (EUS/FNA). Outcomes incorporated mortality, quality of life, 
procedural complications, and costs.
RESULTS: In the Do Nothing strategy, the lifetime risk of cancer was 20%. Doing 
nothing provided the greatest remaining years of life, the lowest cost, and the 
greatest remaining quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). PTP provided the fewest 
remaining years of life, and the fewest remaining QALYs. Screening with EUS 
provided nearly identical results to PTP, and screening with EUS/FNA provided 
intermediate results between PTP and doing nothing. PTP provided the longest 
life expectancy if the lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer was at least 46%, and 
provided the most QALYs if the risk was at least 68%.
CONCLUSIONS: FDRs from familial pancreatic cancer kindreds, who have EUS 
findings of chronic pancreatitis, have increased risk for cancer, but their 
precise risk is unknown. Without the ability to further quantify that risk, the 
most effective strategy is to do nothing.

Autophagy is required for dietary restriction-mediated life span extension in C. 
elegans.

Center, Dallas, Texas 75390-9113, USA.

Dietary restriction extends life span in diverse species including 
Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the downstream cellular targets regulated by 
dietary restriction are largely unknown. Autophagy, an evolutionary conserved 
lysosomal degradation pathway, is induced under starvation conditions and 
regulates life span in insulin signaling C. elegans mutants. We now report that 
two essential autophagy genes (bec-1 and Ce-atg7) are required for the longevity 
phenotype of the C. elegans dietary restriction mutant (eat-2(ad1113) animals. 
Thus, we propose that autophagy mediates the effect, not only of insulin 
signaling, but also of dietary restriction on the regulation of C. elegans life 
span. Since autophagy and longevity control are highly conserved from C. elegans 
to mammals, a similar role for autophagy in dietary restriction-mediated life 
span extension may also exist in mammals.

Health economic evaluation of ferucarbotran-enhanced MRI in the diagnosis of 
liver metastases in colorectal cancer patients.

PURPOSE: The objective of our study was to analyze the health economic impact of 
ferucarbotran-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of 
hepatic colorectal cancer metastases based on observed changes in medical 
management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision tree simulating a patient's medical management 
was designed, comparing two scenarios: contrast-enhanced spiral computed 
tomography-based vs ferucarbotran-enhanced MRI-based (Resovist, Bayer Schering 
Pharma AG, Germany) diagnosis. A clinical trial in patients with presumed liver 
metastases (n=36) provided data on clinical decisions regarding the medical 
management options in relation to diagnostic outcomes: resection, chemotherapy, 
or best supportive care. A "gold standard" was established afterward, combining 
all the available clinical, imaging, laboratory, and pathology findings. A 
multidisciplinary panel formed by a hepatologist, a liver surgeon, and an 
interventional radiologist decided on the recommended medical management for 
each patient. Costs of medical resources associated with each management option 
(all expressed in Euro) were obtained from the public health insurance (average 
European values). Life expectancies for the different options were obtained from 
literature.
RESULTS: Despite an initial extra cost of 338 Euro, a significant net saving of 
1,443 Euro was obtained with ferucarbotran-enhanced MRI mainly because of 
avoiding unnecessary surgery. There was no significant difference in the 
predicted life expectancy between both arms, despite the large difference in 
medical decision.
CONCLUSION: In this comparative medical decision analysis, it was shown that 
ferucarbotran-enhanced MRI has the potential to improve medical management and 
save health care costs.

Allomermis solenopsi n. sp. (Mermithidae: Nematoda) is described from the fire 
ant Solenopsis invicta Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in Argentina. Diagnostic 
characters of the new species include stiff and erect processes on the surface 
of the mature egg, small female amphids, extension of the latero-medial rows of 
male genital papillae beyond the middle rows, an obliquely truncate spicule tip 
and a ventrally swollen male terminus. This is the first record of Allomermis 
Steiner, 1924 from South America and the first host record for members of this 
genus. Previous records of mermithids from Solenopsis spp. are summarised. The 
placement in Allomermis was confirmed by molecular analyses based on nuclear 18S 
ribosomal DNA sequences, the first such molecular framework for the Mermithidae. 
The possible life-cycle of the parasite is discussed, with the aim of using A. 
solenopsi as a biological control agent for fire ants in the United States.

[Range of motion of shoulder and elbow in activities of daily life in 3D motion 
analysis].

AIM: Three-dimensional motion analysis of the lower limb has been an approved 
method of diagnosis and therapy planning for several years. In this study we 
observed the range of motion of the shoulder and elbow in 10 activities of daily 
life (ADL) with a marker-based biomechanical model for the upper extremity. With 
this database we hope to improve the evaluation of different handicaps of the 
upper limb.
METHOD: The used biomechanical model is based on 14 infrared light-reflecting 
markers. The ranges of motion in ADL for shoulder and elbow were measured in a 
standardised case setting in seven test persons with a mean age of 25 years (SD 
15 years). The 10 observed ADL were eating with a spoon, combing hair, genital 
hygiene, using a telephone, typing on a keyboard, drinking from a glass, turning 
a key, turning a page, pouring water in a glass and drawing.
RESULTS: For the ten explored ADL, the test persons needed a range of motion in 
the shoulder of 91 - 0 - 9 degrees (total 100 degrees) flexion/extension, 112 - 
23 - 0 degrees (total 89 degrees) abduction/adduction, and 91 - 0 - 114 degrees 
(total 205 degrees) external/internal rotation. Most of the ADL were performed 
in external rotation and, excluding the motion genital hygiene, the test persons 
only needed an internal rotation of 10 degrees. Maximal shoulder flexion was 
used with opening a door, the minimum was reached with genital hygiene. The 
maximum angles of abduction and rotation were reached with combing hair and the 
minimum values were reached with genital hygiene. To perform the ADL, an elbow 
extension/flexion of 0 - 36 - 146 degrees (total 110 degrees), and 55 - 0 - 72 
degrees (total 127 degrees) pro-/supination was needed. Maximal pronation was 
reached with "pour from a pitcher". Maximal supination was present with genital 
hygiene.
CONCLUSIONS: The decisive benefit of 3D motion analysis is the exact capturing 
of complex and dynamic movements at any time. Therefore, not only static joint 
positions can be recorded, but also the dynamic course of a movement can be 
traced. By using our model on every day movements, we were able to collect data 
that can serve as the basis for the desired range of motion of the upper 
extremities in patients.

The "metabolic syndrome" consists of some common risk factors for cardiovascular 
diseases: central obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension. 
The metabolic syndrome (MTS) leads to increased morbidity and mortality and to 
higher direct and indirect healthcare costs. The MTS can be diagnosed using the 
NCEP/ATP III criteria. The prevalence of the MTS in Germany is estimated at 
23.8% and is expected to rise further, due to increasing obesity among children 
and adolescents. Studies have shown that the MTS leads to increased 
cardiovascular and total mortality and thus to a decreased life expectancy. 
Studies estimating the total costs of MTS are missing, but after addition of the 
costs for all the risk factors it is assumed that MTS costs amount to 5% of 
total healthcare costs. This is the result of the more frequent demand of health 
services and longer hospitalisation of patients with MTS. Even moderate weight 
loss can decrease the rates of morbidity and healthcare costs.

Was there compression of disability for older Americans from 1992 to 2003?

Medical advances and the growth of the elderly population have focused interest 
on trends in the health of the elderly. Three theories have been advanced to 
describe these trends: compression of morbidity, expansion of morbidity, and 
dynamic equilibrium. We applied multistate life table methods to the Medicare 
Current Beneficiary Survey to estimate active and disabled life expectancy from 
1992 to 2003, defining disability as having difficulty with instrumental 
activities of daily living or activities of daily living. We found increases in 
active life expectancy past age 65 and decreases in life expectancy with severe 
disability. These trends are consistent with elements of both the theory of 
compression of morbidity and the theory of dynamic equilibrium.

The association of childhood socioeconomic conditions with healthy longevity at 
the oldest-old ages in China.

    Demography. 2007 Nov;44(4):following table of contents.

Based on unique data from the largest-ever sample of the Chinese oldest-old aged 
80 and older, our multivariate logistic regression analyses show that either 
receiving adequate medical service during sickness in childhood or never/rarely 
suffering from serious illness during childhood significantly reduces the risk 
of being ADL (activities of daily living) impaired, being cognitively impaired, 
and self-reporting poor health by 18%-33% at the oldest-old ages. Estimates of 
effects for five other indicators of childhood conditions are similarly positive 
but mostly not statistically significant. Multivariate survival analysis shows 
that better childhood socioeconomic conditions in general tend to reduce the 
four-year period mortality risk among the oldest-old. But after additional 
controls for 14 covariates are put into the model, the effects are not 
statistically significant, thus suggesting that most of the effects of childhood 
conditions on oldest-old mortality are indirect-at least to the point of 
affecting current health status at the oldest-old ages, which itself is strongly 
associated with mortality. While acknowledging limitations of the present 
analyses due to a lack of information on childhood illness, the 
oldest-olds'recollection errors, and other data problems, we conclude, based on 
this and other studies, that policies that enhance childhood health care and 
children's socioeconomic well-being can have large and long-lasting benefits up 
to the oldest-old ages.

A fixed-effects multilevel analysis of how community family structure affects 
individual mortality in Norway.

By using register data for the entire Norwegian population aged 50-89 in the 
period 1980-1999, during which there were about 720,000 deaths, I estimate how 
the proportions of persons who were divorced or never married in the 
municipality affected all-cause mortality, net of individual marital status. The 
data include individual histories of changes in marital status and places of 
residence, providing a rare opportunity to enter municipality fixed effects into 
the model, thereby capturing the time-invariant unobserved factors at that 
level. The positive health externality of marriage that is suggested in the 
literature is supported by some of the estimates for women. Other 
estimates--especially those for men--point in the opposite direction. One 
possible interpretation of these findings is that social cohesion is perhaps not 
as beneficial for people's health as often claimed, at least not for both sexes. 
Alternatively, the results may reflect that marriage perhaps undermines rather 
than strengthens social cohesion, or that other mechanisms are involved-for 
example, those that are related to people 's perceptions of their health 
relative to the health of others. Estimates from models without such 
municipality fixed effects are markedly different, but these also shed doubt on 
the notion that a high proportion of unmarried persons generally increases 
individual mortality.

Diet and healthy ageing 2100: will we globalise local knowledge systems?

Diet and health clearly are linked intrinsically. Today, more than ever food is 
functionalized and tailor made for specific groups (e.g. athletes, the elderly, 
and people with specific conditions). Increased life expectancy has resulted in 
an increase in the quest for diets which allow for a healthy ageing. In looking 
back 100 years, we try to assess how of our diets will evolve in the next 100 
years and how this may be linked to a 'healthier ageing'. Our argument centres 
around a series of dichotomies which we used to explain the main changes in 
dietary habits and how this impacts on health--the continuous move from dietary 
traditions which are local, low in technological input and based on empiricism, 
to diets which are global, require high technological input and are 
science-based. The innovations our societies have achieved over the last century 
have allowed us to improve our diet based on a better scientific understanding 
of the health benefits of such diets, but this is often not achieved due to 
commercial considerations. This will require that all sectors of the food 
industry work towards healthy and economically affordable diets. In addition, 
there will be a continuous demand by the consumers to ascertain that 'our' foods 
are not only healthy but also convenient and easy to prepare. Healthy ageing 
will require us to look at a multitude of aspects of foods, to integrate this 
knowledge and to apply it in all sectors of food production.

An examination of life expectancy in 1963 reveals twin peaks in the empirical 
distribution across countries: one group of countries clustered around a life 
expectancy of 40 years and a second group clustered around a life expectancy of 
65 years. By 2003, the mode of each cluster had moved up by approximately 10 
years. Although the two groups are similar in that within each of them, there is 
progress toward higher life expectancy, a number of countries appear to have 
made the jump from the high-mortality cluster to the low-mortality cluster. We 
reject the hypothesis that these changes reflect a simple convergence process. 
The data instead suggest continuous advances among many countries within 
clusters, with advances in life expectancy in some nations resulting in a jump 
from one cluster to the other.

OBJECTIVE: This study explored the cost-effectiveness of quality-improvement 
interventions for depression in primary care, relative to usual care, among 
patients with subthreshold depression or depressive disorder.
METHODS: A total of 746 primary care patients in managed care organizations with 
12-month depressive disorder and 502 with current depressive symptoms but no 
disorder (subthreshold depression) participated in a group-level randomized 
controlled trial initiated between June 1996 and March 1997. Matched clinics 
were randomly assigned to enhanced usual care or one of two quality improvement 
interventions that provided education to manage depression over time and 
resources to facilitate access to medication management or psychotherapy for six 
to 12 months.
RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness ratio for the pooled intervention groups versus 
usual care was $2,028 for patients with subthreshold depression (95% confidence 
interval [CI]=-$17,225 to $21,282) and $53,716 for those with depressive 
disorder (CI=$14,194 to $93,238), by using a measure of quality-adjusted life 
years (QALY) based on the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey. Similar results were 
obtained when alternative QALY measures were used.
CONCLUSIONS: Although precision was limited, even the upper limit of the 95% CIs 
suggests that such interventions are as cost-effective for patients with 
subthreshold depression as are many widely used medical therapies. Despite lack 
of evidence for efficacy of treatments for subthreshold depression, disease 
management programs that support clinical care decisions over time for patients 
with subthreshold depression or depressive disorder can yield cost-effectiveness 
ratios comparable to those of widely adopted medical therapies. Achieving 
greater certainty about average cost-effectiveness would require a much larger 
study.

[Which are the causes of death among Chileans today?. Long-term perspectives].

During the last decades, Chile experienced substantial socioeconomic, 
epidemiological and demographic changes. These resulted, among other 
consequences, in a deceleration of population growth, a notorious decrease in 
fertility rates, and one of the most rapid and deepest drop in general and 
infant mortality rates in the Latin American region. These changes resulted in a 
sustained increase of life expectancy and a substantial ageing of the Chilean 
population. This process is also changing the disease burden of the population. 
Infectious and perinatal diseases lost relevance as major causes of mortality, 
and have been replaced by chronic non transmissible diseases, specifically 
cardiovascular conditions and cancer, that are becoming the main causes of 
death. High blood pressure, cardiovascular risk, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, 
overweight and obesity, smoking, sedentary lifestyle and depression will have a 
great impact on health conditions during the XXI century. These factors and a 
persistent social inequity will hinder the efforts to reduce the impact and 
consequences of chronic non transmissible, diseases in the Chilean population.

Adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: a cost-utility analysis of FEC-D vs. 
FEC 100.

BACKGROUND: Adjuvant 5-flurouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide-docetaxel 
(FEC-D) has been shown to improve disease-free and overall survival (DFS and 
OS), compared to FEC 100, for node-positive breast cancer. An economic 
evaluation was undertaken to examine the cost-utility (CU) of FEC-D relative to 
FEC 100 given possible differences in cost between the two regimens.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to calculate the cumulative costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained over a 10-year horizon for a 
hypothetical cohort of 1,000 women with node-positive breast cancer treated with 
FEC 100 or FEC-D. Event rates, costs, and utilities were derived from the 
literature. Efficacy outcomes were based primarily on the hazard ratio of DFS 
for all patients, but separate analyses were also conducted according to age and 
menopausal status as per the PACS 01 subgroup analysis results. The model took a 
third-party direct payer perspective and reports results in 2006 Canadian 
dollars ($). Both costs and benefits were discounted at 3%.
RESULTS: FEC-D is associated with 0.156 QALY gain and a $2,280 incremental cost 
compared to FEC 100, with a CU of $14,612/QALY gained. Results were robust to 
model assumptions and input parameters in a sensitivity analysis but were 
marginal in pre-menopausal and younger women.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant FEC-D is a cost-effective alternative to FEC 100, with a 
cost-effectiveness ratio well below commonly employed thresholds. The CU 
according to age and menopausal status should be considered in view of the 
potential differences in efficacy in these subgroups, if any.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the potential economic 
efficiency of third-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with 
alemtuzumab versus fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR).
METHODS: The target population for this study were patients with CLL who were 
able to tolerate third-line treatment with either FCR or alemtuzumab. The 
perspective used was that of the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Management Agency 
(PHARMAC)/District Health Board. Health outcomes considered were survival time 
from commencement of treatment and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. 
Average costs and outcomes and incremental cost per patient treated, per 
survival month and per QALY gained, were calculated. All costs were presented in 
2006 New Zealand dollars.
RESULTS: Base-case direct medical costs for alemtuzumab per treatment regimen 
per patient were $NZ15 303 lower than those for FCR. The average direct medical 
cost per survival month gained for alemtuzumab was $NZ3144 and for FCR was 
$NZ4101, and the average direct medical cost per QALY gained was $NZ46,016 and 
for FCR was $NZ60,012.
CONCLUSION: Third-line treatment of eligible patients with alemtuzumab was found 
to be $NZ15,303 less costly than FCR per patient.

Prior studies have shown that disruption of mitochondrial electron transport 
chain (ETC) function in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can result in life 
extension. Counter to these findings, many mutations that disrupt ETC function 
in humans are known to be pathologically life-shortening. In this study, we have 
undertaken the first formal investigation of the role of partial mitochondrial 
ETC inhibition and its contribution to the life-extension phenotype of C. 
elegans. We have developed a novel RNA interference (RNAi) dilution strategy to 
incrementally reduce the expression level of five genes encoding mitochondrial 
proteins in C. elegans: atp-3, nuo-2, isp-1, cco-1, and frataxin (frh-1). We 
observed that each RNAi treatment led to marked alterations in multiple ETC 
components. Using this dilution technique, we observed a consistent, three-phase 
lifespan response to increasingly greater inhibition by RNAi: at low levels of 
inhibition, there was no response, then as inhibition increased, lifespan 
responded by monotonically lengthening. Finally, at the highest levels of RNAi 
inhibition, lifespan began to shorten. Indirect measurements of whole-animal 
oxidative stress showed no correlation with life extension. Instead, larval 
development, fertility, and adult size all became coordinately affected at the 
same point at which lifespan began to increase. We show that a specific signal, 
initiated during the L3/L4 larval stage of development, is sufficient for 
initiating mitochondrial dysfunction-dependent life extension in C. elegans. 
This stage of development is characterized by the last somatic cell divisions 
normally undertaken by C. elegans and also by massive mitochondrial DNA 
expansion. The coordinate effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on several cell 
cycle-dependent phenotypes, coupled with recent findings directly linking cell 
cycle progression with mitochondrial activity in C. elegans, lead us to propose 
that cell cycle checkpoint control plays a key role in specifying longevity of 
mitochondrial mutants.

MSN2 and MSN4 link calorie restriction and TOR to sirtuin-mediated lifespan 
extension in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Medvedik O(1), Lamming DW, Kim KD, Sinclair DA.

Author information:

of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of 
America.

Calorie restriction (CR) robustly extends the lifespan of numerous species. In 
the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CR has been proposed to extend lifespan by 
boosting the activity of sirtuin deacetylases, thereby suppressing the formation 
of toxic repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) circles. An alternative theory is that 
CR works by suppressing the TOR (target of rapamycin) signaling pathway, which 
extends lifespan via mechanisms that are unknown but thought to be independent 
of sirtuins. Here we show that TOR inhibition extends lifespan by the same 
mechanism as CR: by increasing Sir2p activity and stabilizing the rDNA locus. 
Further, we show that rDNA stabilization and lifespan extension by both CR and 
TOR signaling is due to the relocalization of the transcription factors Msn2p 
and Msn4p from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they increase expression of 
the nicotinamidase gene PNC1. These findings suggest that TOR and sirtuins may 
be part of the same longevity pathway in higher organisms, and that they may 
promote genomic stability during aging.
