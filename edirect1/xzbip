The conventional incision for donor hepatectomy is a right subcostal incision 
with a midline extension. With increased experience in both donor hepatectomy 
and laparoscopy, the conventional incision can be shortened to a significant 
extent. Laparoscopic mobilization of the liver coupled with a hand port allows 
the insertion of one hand inside the abdomen for control; this makes 
small-incision donor hepatectomy a technically feasible alternative. We compared 
26 right lobe donor hepatectomies performed with a laparoscopy-assisted 
technique (the laparoscopy-assisted donor hepatectomy group) to 24 donor 
hepatectomies performed with the conventional open technique (the conventional 
donor hepatectomy group). The donors in both groups and their recipients were 
followed for 6 months. Pain, discomfort related to the scar [including abdominal 
wall sensorineural deficits (numbness and differences in tactile and temperature 
sensations) and tightness around the scar], and donor quality of life (assessed 
with the International Quality of Life Assessment Short Form 8 scoring system) 
were compared between the 2 groups. In conclusion, laparoscopy-assisted surgery 
can be a technically feasible alternative in experienced hands, and as with 
other minimally invasive surgeries, it has advantages such as significantly less 
pain, reduced incision-related complications, and better donor quality of life 
during the early postoperative period without compromising donor safety.

According to World Health Organization, the life expectancy at birth is 
increasing. An increase in life expectancy might result in increased morbidity 
and mortality in elderly. The increase in the elderly population also leads to 
an increase in medico-legal problems, as well. Autopsy is of high importance for 
determination of cause of death in clinical and forensic cases. The purpose of 
this study was to find out general characteristics elderly deaths by examining 
forensic autopsy records. Out of 7033 forensic autopsies performed between years 
of 2007 and 2011, 1324 were elderly deaths and were included in the scope of the 
study. The records of public prosecutor office, crime scene investigation and 
autopsy findings were examined. The majority of victims (70.6%) were male, while 
29.4% were female, with a male to female ratio of 2.4/1. Victims' ages ranged 
between 65 and 96 years, and the mean age was 74.8 years. A great number of 
presented elderly deaths were due to unnatural causes, followed by natural 
deaths cases. Out of unnatural deaths, 63.2% were related to accidents, 23.7% 
were suicides, and remaining 13.1% were homicides. More than half (56.6%) of all 
suicidal deaths were due to hanging. Of natural deaths, the majority (82.7%) 
were due to cardiovascular system disease. In the presented series the cause of 
death was determined in 90.9% of all elderly deaths, which validates the need 
for a forensic autopsy. Data obtained through autopsy procedures is of high 
importance for death statistics.

The incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is increasing. Squamous cell 
carcinoma of the skin (SCC) is a tumor of the elderly. Due to the increasing 
life expectancy, SCC will become more and more frequent in the future. Generally 
SCC has a favorable prognosis. Standard therapy is microscopically- controlled 
excision. Therapy of advanced and metastatic SCC is still challenging. Patients 
with regional lymph node metastasis have ten-year survival rates less than 20%; 
patients with distant metastases less than 10%. Immunosuppression has been shown 
to be one of the key prognostic factors for metastasis. The article reviews SCC 
and focusses on patients being at risk for an unfavorable course.

Racial Disparities in Mortality Among Middle-Aged and Older Men: Does Marriage 
Matter?

Based on longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study, this study 
assesses the importance of marital status in explaining racial disparities in 
all-cause mortality during an 18-year follow-up among White and African American 
men aged 51 to 61 years in 1992. Being married was associated with significant 
advantages in household income, health behaviors, and self-rated health. These 
advantages associated with marriage at baseline also got translated into better 
survival chance for married men during the 1992-2010 follow-up. Both marital 
selection and marital protection were relevant in explaining the mortality 
advantages associated with marriage. After adjusting for the effect of selected 
variables on premarital socioeconomic status and health, about 28% of the 
mortality gap between White and African American men in the Health and 
Retirement Study can be explained by the relatively low rates of marriage among 
African American men. Addressing the historically low rates of marriage among 
African Americans and their contributing factors becomes important for reducing 
racial disparities in men's mortality.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We aimed to compare clinical outcomes and safety after 
sorafenib therapy between patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 
stage B or C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) aged ≥75 years (aged group, n=179) 
and those with BCLC stage B or C HCC aged <75 years (control group, n=279).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared overall survival (OS), progression free 
survival (PFS), best treatment response and sorafenib related serious adverse 
events (SAEs) of grade 3 or more in the two groups. Furthermore, for reducing 
the selection bias, we compared clinical outcome of these two groups using 
propensity score matching analysis.
RESULTS: The median OS and PFS intervals were 9.7 and 3.8 months in the aged 
group and 8.2 and 3.3 months in the control group (P=0.641 for OS and P=0.068 
for PFS). Disease control rates were 49.2% (88/179) in the aged group and 49.1% 
(137/279) in the control group (P>0.999). Objective response rates were 15.1% 
(27/179) in the aged group and 14.3% (40/279) in the control group (P=0.892). 
Treatment related SAEs of grade 3 or more were observed in 51 patients (28.5%) 
in the aged group and in 69 patients (24.7%) in the control group (P=0.385). In 
the propensity score matched cohort (132 pairs), no significant difference in 
the two groups was observed in terms of OS (P=0.898) and PFS (P=0.407).
CONCLUSION: In BCLC stage B or C HCC patients treated with sorafenib, life 
expectancy, disease progression, treatment efficacy and SAEs are unaffected by 
age over 75 years.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the physiologic and psychological effects of an 
equine-assisted therapy protocol (EAT) in breast cancer survivors.
METHODS: Twenty women (mean age, 45.61±2.71 years) whose breast cancer treatment 
had concluded at least 6 months previously underwent a screening protocol to 
certify their eligibility to participate in noncompetitive sports. The patients 
were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=10) or a control group 
(n=10). Intervention patients participated in a 16-week EAT protocol consisting 
of 2 hours of activity per week. All patients were tested before and after the 
intervention for maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), fat mass percentage, total 
body water percentage, strength of principal muscular groups (measured on five 
weight-lifting machines [leg press, leg extension, leg curl, shoulder press, 
vertical traction]), and quality of life using the Functional Assessment of 
Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue questionnaire (FACIT-F).
RESULTS: After intervention, the intervention group showed an improvement in 
VO2max (28.29%; p<.001), a decrease in fat mass percentage (change, -7.73%; 
p<0.002), an increase in total body water percentage (6.90%; p=0.027), and an 
increase in strength (leg press, 17.75% [p=0.018]; leg extension, 21.55% 
[p=0.005]; leg curl, 26.04% [p<0.001]; shoulder press, 49.72% [p=0.003]; 
vertical traction, 19.27% [p=0.002]). Furthermore, the increase in the three 
FACIT-F scores (FACIT-F trial outcome: 9.29% [p=0.010]; Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy-General total score, 14.80% [p=0.022]; FACIT-F total score, 
11.48% [p=0.004]) showed an increase in quality of life. No significant changes 
for any variable were found for the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: EAT had positive effects on both physiologic and psychological 
measures, enhancing quality of life of breast cancer survivors. RESULTS suggest 
a new method for rehabilitation intervention strategies after cancer in a 
nonmedical environment.

BACKGROUND: Many analyses of HIV treatment decisions assume a fixed formulary of 
HIV drugs. However, new drugs are approved nearly twice a year, and the rate of 
availability of new drugs may affect treatment decisions, particularly when to 
initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART).
OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of considering the availability of new drugs 
on the optimal initiation criteria for ART and outcomes in patients with 
HIV/AIDS.
METHODS: We enhanced a previously described simulation model of the optimal time 
to initiate ART to incorporate the rate of availability of new antiviral drugs. 
We assumed that the future rate of availability of new drugs would be similar to 
the past rate of availability of new drugs, and we estimated the past rate by 
fitting a statistical model to actual HIV drug approval data from 1982-2010. We 
then tested whether or not the future availability of new drugs affected the 
model-predicted optimal time to initiate ART based on clinical outcomes, 
considering treatment initiation thresholds of 200, 350, and 500 cells/mm3. We 
also quantified the impact of the future availability of new drugs on life 
expectancy (LE) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE).
RESULTS: In base case analysis, considering the availability of new drugs raised 
the optimal starting CD4 threshold for most patients to 500 cells/mm3. The 
predicted gains in outcomes due to availability of pipeline drugs were generally 
small (less than 1%), but for young patients with a high viral load could add as 
much as a 4.9% (1.73 years) increase in LE and a 8% (2.43 QALY) increase in 
QALE, because these patients were particularly likely to exhaust currently 
available ART regimens before they died. In sensitivity analysis, increasing the 
rate of availability of new drugs did not substantially alter the results. 
Lowering the toxicity of future ART drugs had greater potential to increase 
benefit for many patient groups, increasing QALE by as much as 10%.
CONCLUSIONS: The future availability of new ART drugs without lower toxicity 
raises optimal treatment initiation for most patients, and improves clinical 
outcomes, especially for younger patients with higher viral loads. Reductions in 
toxicity of future ART drugs could impact optimal treatment initiation and 
improve clinical outcomes for all HIV patients.

Measurement of utility.

Thavorncharoensap M.

The Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is the most widely recommended health 
outcome measure for use in economic evaluations. The QALY gives a value to the 
effect of a given health intervention in terms of both quantity and quality. 
QALYs are calculated by multiplying the duration of time spent in a given health 
state, in years, by the quality of life weighted, known as utility. Utility can 
range from 0 (the worst health state-the equivalent of death) to 1 (the best 
health state-full health). This paper provides an overview of the various 
methods that can be used to measure utility and outlines the recommended 
protocol for measuring utility, as described in the Guidelines for Health 
Technology Assessment in Thailand (second edition). The recommendations are as 
follows: Wherever possible, primary data collection using EQ-5D-3L in patients 
using Thai value sets generated from the general public should be used. Where 
the EQ-5D-3L is considered inappropriate, other methods such as Standard gamble 
(SG), Time-trade-off (TTO), Visual analogue scale (VAS), Health Utilities Index 
(HUI), SF-6D, or Quality of well being (QWB) can be used. However, justification 
and full details on the chosen instrument should always be provided.

Handling time in economic evaluation studies.

Permsuwan U, Guntawongwan K, Buddhawongsa P.

The discount rates and time horizons used in a health technology assessment 
(HTA) can have a significant impact on the results, and thus the prioritization 
of technologies. Therefore, it is important that clear guidance be provided on 
the appropriate discount rates for cost and health effect and appropriate time 
horizons. In this paper we conduct a review of relevant case studies and 
guidelines and provide guidance for all researchers conducting economic 
evaluations of health technologies in the Thai context. A uniform discount rate 
of 3% is recommended for both costs and health effects in base case analyses. A 
sensitivity analysis should also be conducted, with a discount range of 0-6%. 
For technologies where the effects are likely to sustain for at least 30y ears, 
a rate of 4% for costs and 2% for health effects is recommended. The time 
horizon should be long enough to capture the full costs and effects of the 
programs.

Sensitivity analysis for handling uncertainty in an economic evaluation.

Limwattananon S.

To meet updated international standards, this paper revises the previous Thai 
guidelines for conducting sensitivity analyses as part of the decision analysis 
model for health technology assessment. It recommends both deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses to handle uncertainty of the model 
parameters, which are best represented graphically. Two new methodological 
issues are introduced-a threshold analysis of medicines' unit prices for 
fulfilling the National Lists of Essential Medicines' requirements and the 
expected value of information for delaying decision-making in contexts where 
there are high levels of uncertainty. Further research is recommended where 
parameter uncertainty is significant and where the cost of conducting the 
research is not prohibitive.

Systematic review, network meta-analysis and exploratory cost-effectiveness 
model of randomized trials of minimally invasive techniques versus surgery for 
varicose veins.

Comment in
    Br J Surg. 2014 Aug;101(9):1037-9.

BACKGROUND: A Health Technology Assessment was conducted to evaluate the 
relative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of minimally invasive 
techniques (foam sclerotherapy (FS), endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and 
radiofrequency ablation (RFA)) for managing varicose veins, in comparison with 
traditional surgery.
METHODS: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was undertaken 
to assess the effectiveness of minimally invasive techniques compared with other 
treatments, principally surgical stripping, in terms of recurrence of varicose 
veins, Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), pain and quality of life. Network 
meta-analysis and exploratory cost-effectiveness modelling were performed.
RESULTS: The literature search conducted in July 2011 identified 1453 unique 
citations: 31 RCTs (51 papers) satisfied the criteria for effectiveness review. 
Differences between treatments were negligible in terms of clinical outcomes, so 
the treatment with the lowest cost appears to be most cost-effective. Total FS 
costs were estimated to be lowest, and FS was marginally more effective than 
surgery. However, relative effectiveness was sensitive to the model time 
horizon. Threshold analysis indicated that EVLA and RFA might be considered 
cost-effective if their costs were similar to those for surgery. These findings 
are subject to various uncertainties, including the risk of bias present in the 
evidence base and variation in reported costs.
CONCLUSION: This assessment of currently available evidence suggests there is 
little to choose between surgery and the minimally invasive techniques in terms 
of efficacy or safety, so the relative cost of the treatments becomes one of the 
deciding factors. High-quality RCT evidence is needed to verify and further 
inform these findings.

INTRODUCTION: Despite the many benefits that have been demonstrated by the 
continuous administration of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in persistent asthma, 
a new strategy for mild-asthma is emerging, consisting of using intermittent or 
as-needed ICS treatment in conjunction with short-acting beta2 agonists in 
response to symptoms. However, no previous studies have reported an economic 
evaluation comparing these two therapeutic strategies.
METHODS: A Markov-type model was developed in order to estimate costs and health 
outcomes of a simulated cohort of pediatric patients with persistent asthma 
treated over a 12-month period. Effectiveness parameters were obtained from a 
systematic review of the literature. Cost data were obtained from official 
databases provided by the Colombian Ministry of Health. The main outcome was the 
variable "quality-adjusted life-years" (QALYs).
RESULTS: For the base-case analysis, the model showed that compared to 
intermittent ICS, daily therapy with ICS had lower costs (US$437.02 vs. 585.03 
and US$704.62 vs. 749.81 average cost per patient over 12 months for school 
children and preschoolers, respectively), and the greatest gain in QALYs (0.9629 
vs. 0.9392 QALYs and 0.9238 vs. 0.9130 QALYS for school children and 
preschoolers, respectively), resulting in daily therapy being considered 
dominant.
CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis shows that compared to intermittent therapy, 
daily therapy with ICS for treating pediatric patients with recurrent wheezing 
and mild persistent asthma is a dominant strategy (more cost effective), because 
it showed a greater gain in QALYs with lower total treatment costs.

Together and apart: a typology of re-partnering in old age.

Koren C(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Social Work and The Center for the Study of Society,University of 
Haifa,Mt. Carmel,Israel.

BACKGROUND: The human need for love, friendship, and physical contact, and the 
fear of loneliness do not diminish with age. Widowhood and late-life divorce and 
increased life expectancy are likely to lead to alternative relationships, such 
as re-partnering. The purpose of this paper is to explore interplays between 
emotional and physical components of re-partnering in old age.
METHODS: Theoretical sampling of 20 couples included men who re-partnered at the 
age of 65+ years and women at the age of 60+ years, following termination of 
lifelong marriages due to death or divorce. Living arrangements included married 
or unmarried cohabitation under the same roof or in separate homes. Forty 
semi-structured interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The 
couple was the unit of analysis.
RESULTS: Interplays between physical and emotional dimensions were examined 
using five abductive parameters derived from data analysis resulting in a 
fourfold typology of emotional and physical closeness/distance in re-partnering 
in old age: (1) living together (physically and emotionally); (2) living apart 
(physically) together (emotionally); (3) living together (physically) apart 
(emotionally); and (4) living apart (physically and emotionally).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings revealed types of partner relationships that are different 
from lifelong marriages. The typology could help professionals working with 
older persons regarding what to expect in re-partnering in old age and be 
included in developmental theories as an option in old age. A quantitative tool 
for research and therapy purposes, entitled The Re-partnering in Old Age 
Typology Scale (RPOAT Scale), based on abductive parameters, could be 
established for measuring re-partnering relationship quality and classifying 
re-partnering couples.

Polyketide natural products constitute a broad class of compounds with diverse 
structural features and biological activities. Their biosynthetic machinery, 
represented by type I polyketide synthases (PKSs), has an architecture in which 
successive modules catalyse two-carbon linear extensions and keto-group 
processing reactions on intermediates covalently tethered to carrier domains. 
Here we used electron cryo-microscopy to determine sub-nanometre-resolution 
three-dimensional reconstructions of a full-length PKS module from the bacterium 
Streptomyces venezuelae that revealed an unexpectedly different architecture 
compared to the homologous dimeric mammalian fatty acid synthase. A single 
reaction chamber provides access to all catalytic sites for the intramodule 
carrier domain. In contrast, the carrier from the preceding module uses a 
separate entrance outside the reaction chamber to deliver the upstream 
polyketide intermediate for subsequent extension and modification. This study 
reveals for the first time, to our knowledge, the structural basis for both 
intramodule and intermodule substrate transfer in polyketide synthases, and 
establishes a new model for molecular dissection of these multifunctional enzyme 
systems.

The polyketide synthase (PKS) mega-enzyme assembly line uses a modular 
architecture to synthesize diverse and bioactive natural products that often 
constitute the core structures or complete chemical entities for many clinically 
approved therapeutic agents. The architecture of a full-length PKS module from 
the pikromycin pathway of Streptomyces venezuelae creates a reaction chamber for 
the intramodule acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain that carries building blocks 
and intermediates between acyltransferase, ketosynthase and ketoreductase active 
sites (see accompanying paper). Here we determine electron cryo-microscopy 
structures of a full-length pikromycin PKS module in three key biochemical 
states of its catalytic cycle. Each biochemical state was confirmed by bottom-up 
liquid chromatography/Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass 
spectrometry. The ACP domain is differentially and precisely positioned after 
polyketide chain substrate loading on the active site of the ketosynthase, after 
extension to the β-keto intermediate, and after β-hydroxy product generation. 
The structures reveal the ACP dynamics for sequential interactions with 
catalytic domains within the reaction chamber, and for transferring the 
elongated and processed polyketide substrate to the next module in the PKS 
pathway. During the enzymatic cycle the ketoreductase domain undergoes dramatic 
conformational rearrangements that enable optimal positioning for reductive 
processing of the ACP-bound polyketide chain elongation intermediate. These 
findings have crucial implications for the design of functional PKS modules, and 
for the engineering of pathways to generate pharmacologically relevant 
molecules.

Is expanding HPV vaccination programs to include school-aged boys likely to be 
value-for-money: a cost-utility analysis in a country with an existing 
school-girl program.

BACKGROUND: Similar to many developed countries, vaccination against human 
papillomavirus (HPV) is provided only to girls in New Zealand and coverage is 
relatively low (47% in school-aged girls for dose 3). Some jurisdictions have 
already extended HPV vaccination to school-aged boys. Thus, exploration of the 
cost-utility of adding boys' vaccination is relevant. We modeled the incremental 
health gain and costs for extending the current girls-only program to boys, 
intensifying the current girls-only program to achieve 73% coverage, and 
extension of the intensive program to boys.
METHODS: A Markov macro-simulation model, which accounted for herd immunity, was 
developed for an annual cohort of 12-year-olds in 2011 and included the future 
health states of: cervical cancer, pre-cancer (CIN I to III), genital warts, and 
three other HPV-related cancers. In each state, health sector costs, including 
additional health costs from extra life, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
were accumulated. The model included New Zealand data on cancer incidence and 
survival, and other cause mortality (all by sex, age, ethnicity and 
deprivation).
RESULTS: At an assumed local willingness-to-pay threshold of US$29,600, 
vaccination of 12-year-old boys to achieve the current coverage for girls would 
not be cost-effective, at US$61,400/QALY gained (95% UI $29,700 to $112,000; 
OECD purchasing power parities) compared to the current girls-only program, with 
an assumed vaccine cost of US$59 (NZ$113). This was dominated though by the 
intensified girls-only program; US$17,400/QALY gained (95% UI: dominant to 
$46,100). Adding boys to this intensified program was also not cost-effective; 
US$128,000/QALY gained, 95% UI: $61,900 to $247,000).Vaccination of boys was not 
found to be cost-effective, even for additional scenarios with very low vaccine 
or program administration costs - only when combined vaccine and administration 
costs were NZ$125 or lower per dose was vaccination of boys cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that adding boys to the girls-only HPV 
vaccination program in New Zealand is highly unlikely to be cost-effective. In 
order for vaccination of males to become cost-effective in New Zealand, vaccine 
would need to be supplied at very low prices and administration costs would need 
to be minimised.

AIM: To determine whether the trend of improved survival among individuals with 
cerebral palsy (CP) in California during the 1980s and 1990s has continued 
during the most recent decade.
METHOD: In an observational cohort study we evaluated individuals with CP, aged 
4 years and older, who were clients of the California Department of 
Developmental Services. Medical diagnoses, functional disabilities, and special 
health care requirements were assessed with Client Development Evaluation 
Reports made between 1983 and 2010. Trends in birth cohort survival were 
analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression. Calendar year period 
effects were analyzed with Poisson regression.
RESULTS: A total of 51,923 persons with CP (28,789 males [55%], 23,134 females 
[45%]; mean age 14y 11mo, SD 14y 1mo, range 4y 0mo to 96y 10mo) collectively 
contributed 662,268 years of follow-up. There were 7690 deaths for an overall 
mortality rate of 11.6 per 1000 persons per year. No significant birth cohort 
effects on survival were observed in 4-year-olds who had no severe disabilities. 
By contrast, children who did not lift their heads in prone position who were 
born in more recent years had significantly lower mortality rates (Cox hazard 
ratio 0.971, p<0.001) than those with comparable disabilities born earlier. With 
regard to calendar year period effects, we found that age-, sex-, and 
disability-specific mortality rates declined by 1.5% (95% CI 0.9-2.1) 
year-over-year from 1983 to 2010. The estimate increased to 2.5% (95% CI 
1.9-3.1) per year when we additionally controlled for tube-feeding status. 
Mortality rates in tube fed adolescents and adults, ages 15 to 59 years, 
declined by 0.9% (95% CI, 0.4-1.4) per year. No improvement was observed for 
adolescents or adults who fed orally or for those over age 60. In fact, the 
ratio of age-specific mortality rates for these latter groups to those in the 
general population, increased by 1.7% (95% CI 1.3-2.0) per year during the study 
period.
INTERPRETATION: The trend toward improved survival has continued throughout the 
most recent decade. Declines in CP childhood mortality are comparable to the 
improvements observed in the United States general population (i.e. the 
mortality ratio in childhood has remained roughly constant over the last three 
decades). In contrast, the mortality ratio for most adolescents and adults with 
CP, relative to the general population, has increased.

Functional impairment, disability, and frailty in adults aging with 
HIV-infection.

The integration of antiretroviral therapy (i.e., ART) into HIV care has 
dramatically extended the life expectancy of those living with HIV. However, in 
comparison to similar HIV-uninfected populations, HIV-infected persons 
experience an excess of morbidity and mortality with an early onset of aging 
complications including neurocognitive decline, osteoporosis, impaired physical 
function, frailty, and falls. Recent consensus guidelines encourage clinicians 
and researchers to consider functional impairment of HIV-infected adults as a 
measure to understand the impact of aging across a range of abilities. Despite 
the importance of assessing function in persons aging with HIV infection, a lack 
of consistent terminology and standardization of assessment tools has limited 
the application of functional assessments in clinical or research settings. 
Herein, we distinguish between different approaches used to assess function, 
describe what is known about function in the aging HIV population, and consider 
directions for future research.

Several alternative approaches have been described to avoid the complications 
related to the olecranon osteotomy used to treat distal articular humerus 
fractures. The published experience with the triceps-sparing approach is scant. 
In this prospective study, a total of 12 patients with an articular humeral 
fracture were treated using this approach. At a mean followup of 1,7 years, the 
average range of motion was 112.8° (range from 85° to 135°); the elbow flexion 
averaged 125.5° (range from 112° to 135°) and the deficit of elbow extension 
14.6° (range from 0° to 30°). All the elbows were stable. The Mayo Elbow 
Performance Score (MEPS) averaged 93.3 (range from 80 to 100). In the present 
series no failure of the triceps reattachment to the olecranon was found, and 
all the patients recalled returning to their previous daily life activities 
without impairment with a satisfactory MEPS. As a conclusion, the 
triceps-sparing approach can be considered for treating distal articular humerus 
fractures. We consider that three clinical settings can be more favorable to use 
this approach: those cases in which a total elbow prosthesis might be needed, 
cases of ipsilateral diaphyseal fracture, or presence of previous hardware in 
the olecranon.

Improving adherence to lipid-lowering therapy in a community pharmacy 
intervention program: a cost-effectiveness analysis.

BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies has been shown to 
improve adherence to chronic therapies. Long-term impact on clinical outcomes or 
medical cost savings, however, remains understudied. 
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmaceutical care 
intervention program in Dutch community pharmacies that improved patients' 
adherence to lipid-lowering therapy. 
METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed using a time-dependent Markov 
model from the health care payer perspective. Participants were patients 
initiating lipid-lowering therapy for primary prevention (40%) or secondary 
prevention (60%) of cardiovascular events (CVEs). The intervention was the 
pharmaceutical care program MeMO (Medication Monitoring and Optimisation) in 9 
community pharmacies in the Netherlands, based on continuous monitoring and 
optimization of lipid-lowering therapy in new patients. The follow-up period of 
the program was 1 year. The main outcome of the intervention program was 
discontinuation of lipid-lowering therapy. This outcome was extrapolated in the 
economic model to lifelong costs, quality of life, reductions in cardiovascular 
events, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Patients in the MeMO program had a lower risk for therapy 
discontinuation, RR = 0.49 (0.37 to 0.66); the effectiveness was similar in 
primary and secondary prevention. In a cohort of 1,000 primary and secondary 
prevention patients, the MeMO program resulted in a reduction of 7 nonfatal 
strokes, 2 fatal strokes, 16 nonfatal myocardial infarctions (MIs), 7 fatal MIs, 
and 16 revascularizations over patients' lifetime. Additional medication, 
disease management, and intervention costs in the MeMO program were €411,000; 
the cost savings due to reduced CVEs were €443,000. The MeMO program resulted in 
84 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and net cost savings of €32,000. 
Clinical benefits and cost savings were highest in the secondary prevention 
population.
CONCLUSION: Pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies can improve statin 
therapy adherence, resulting in better prevention of CVEs. The MeMO program 
resulted in considerable clinical benefits and net cost savings. Programs by 
community pharmacies targeted at improving adherence may provide good value for 
money, and health care insurers should consider reimbursing these activities.

BACKGROUND: The elderly population size is growing worldwide due increased life 
expectancy and decreased mortality in the elderly. This has lead to an increase 
in the number of centenarians, and their numbers are predicted to increase 
further. Little is known about suicide rates in centenarians.
METHODS: Data on the number of suicides (ICD-10 codes, X60-84) in entenarians of 
both gender for as many years as possible from 2000 were ascertained from three 
sources: colleagues, national statisics office websites and e-mail contact with 
the national statistics offices of as many countries as possible. The number of 
centernarians for the corresponding years was estimated for each country using 
data provided by the United Nations website.
RESULTS: Data were available from 17 countries. The suicide rate was 57 (95% 
confidence interval 45-69) per 100, 000 person years in men and 6.8 (95% 
confidence interval 5.1-8.5) per 100,000 person years in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Suicide rates were sufficiently large amongst centenarians for 
there to constitute a public health concern given the anticipated rise in the 
centenarian population and the paucity of data on risk and protective factors 
for suicide in this age group.

INTRODUCTION: Excessive alcohol consumption is a leading cause of premature 
mortality in the United States. The objectives of this study were to update 
national estimates of alcohol-attributable deaths (AAD) and years of potential 
life lost (YPLL) in the United States, calculate age-adjusted rates of AAD and 
YPLL in states, assess the contribution of AAD and YPLL to total deaths and YPLL 
among working-age adults, and estimate the number of deaths and YPLL among those 
younger than 21 years.
METHODS: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 
Alcohol-Related Disease Impact application for 2006-2010 to estimate total AAD 
and YPLL across 54 conditions for the United States, by sex and age. AAD and 
YPLL rates and the proportion of total deaths that were attributable to 
excessive alcohol consumption among working-age adults (20-64 y) were calculated 
for the United States and for individual states.
RESULTS: From 2006 through 2010, an annual average of 87,798 (27.9/100,000 
population) AAD and 2.5 million (831.6/100,000) YPLL occurred in the United 
States. Age-adjusted state AAD rates ranged from 51.2/100,000 in New Mexico to 
19.1/100,000 in New Jersey. Among working-age adults, 9.8% of all deaths in the 
United States during this period were attributable to excessive drinking, and 
69% of all AAD involved working-age adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Excessive drinking accounted for 1 in 10 deaths among working-age 
adults in the United States. AAD rates vary across states, but excessive 
drinking remains a leading cause of premature mortality nationwide. Strategies 
recommended by the Community Preventive Services Task Force can help reduce 
excessive drinking and harms related to it.

Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) dramatically reduces AIDS-related 
complications, yet the life expectancy of long-term ART-treated HIV-infected 
patients remains shortened compared to that of uninfected controls, due to 
increased risk of non-AIDS related morbidities. Many propose that these 
complications result from translocated microbial products from the gut that 
stimulate systemic inflammation--a consequence of increased intestinal 
paracellular permeability that persists in this population. Concurrent 
intestinal immunodeficiency and structural barrier deterioration are postulated 
to drive microbial translocation, and direct evidence of intestinal epithelial 
breakdown has been reported in untreated pathogenic SIV infection of rhesus 
macaques. To assess and characterize the extent of epithelial cell damage in 
virally-suppressed HIV-infected patients, we analyzed intestinal biopsy tissues 
for changes in the epithelium at the cellular and molecular level. The 
intestinal epithelium in the HIV gut is grossly intact, exhibiting no decreases 
in the relative abundance and packing of intestinal epithelial cells. We found 
no evidence for structural and subcellular localization changes in intestinal 
epithelial tight junctions (TJ), but observed significant decreases in the 
colonic, but not terminal ileal, transcript levels of TJ components in the HIV+ 
cohort. This result is confirmed by a reduction in TJ proteins in the descending 
colon of HIV+ patients. In the HIV+ cohort, colonic TJ transcript levels 
progressively decreased along the proximal-to-distal axis. In contrast, 
expression levels of the same TJ transcripts stayed unchanged, or progressively 
increased, from the proximal-to-distal gut in the healthy controls. Non-TJ 
intestinal epithelial cell-specific mRNAs reveal differing patterns of 
HIV-associated transcriptional alteration, arguing for an overall change in 
intestinal epithelial transcriptional regulation in the HIV colon. These 
findings suggest that persistent intestinal epithelial dysregulation involving a 
reduction in TJ expression is a mechanism driving increases in colonic
