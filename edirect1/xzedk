November 2018 were selected for a primary observational longitudinal study using 
questionnaires to assess upper limb and elbow function (DASH and MEPS), quality 
of life (SF-12), pain (visual analog scale - VAS), and radiographic evaluation 
in anteroposterior and lateral views of the elbow.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients were male, and the mean age was 46.8 years. All 
participants had their fractures consolidated, with no radiolgraphic signs of 
implant failure, or degenerative arthritis. Mean range of motion was reduced 
relative to the contralateral limb: 102.6º for flexion-extension and 132.8º for 
pronation-supination. The mean MEPS and DASH scores were 89.6 and 16.5 
respectively. There was no residual pain in 84% of the cases according to the 
VAS.
CONCLUSION: The surgical treatment proposed for transolecranon 
fracture-dislocations showed satisfactory results according to MEPS, DASH scores 
and quality of life measures. Evidence Level IV; Retrospective observational 
study.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Avaliar os resultados funcionais do protocolo de tratamento 
da fratura-luxação transolecraniana, por redução cirúrgica e osteossíntese com 
placa e parafusos, nos pacientes atendidos em hospital de referência para trauma 
ortopédico, com seguimento mínimo de seis meses.
MÉTODOS: vinte e cinco indivíduos tratados cirurgicamente de janeiro de 2014 a 
novembro de 2018 foram selecionados para um estudo longitudinal observacional 
primário, utilizando questionários para avaliar a função do membro superior e 
cotovelo (DASH e MEPS), qualidade de vida (SF-12), dor (visual escala analógica 
- EVA), e avaliação radiográfica nas incidências anteroposterior e perfil do 
cotovelo.
RESULTADOS: Quinze pacientes eram do sexo masculino e a média de idade foi de 
46,8 anos. Todos os participantes tiveram suas fraturas consolidadas, sem sinais 
radiográficos de falha do implante ou artrite degenerativa. A amplitude média do 
movimento foi reduzida em relação ao membro contralateral: 102,6º para 
flexo-extensão e 132,8º para pronossupinação. Os escores médios de MEPS e DASH 
foram 89,6 e 16,5, respectivamente. Não houve dor residual em 84% dos casos de 
acordo com a EAV.
CONCLUSÃO: O tratamento cirúrgico proposto para a fratura-luxação 
transolecraniana apresentou resultados satisfatórios de acordo com MEPS, escores 
DASH e medidas de qualidade de vida. Nível de evidência IV; Estudo observacional 
retrospectivo.

BACKGROUND: According to Europe's Beating Cancer Plan, the number of cancer 
survivors is growing every year and is now estimated at over 12 million in 
Europe. A main objective of the European Commission is to ensure that cancer 
survivors can enjoy a high quality of life, underlining the role of digital 
technology and eHealth apps and tools to achieve this.
OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is the development of a 
user-centered artificial intelligence system to facilitate the input and 
integration of patient-related biopsychosocial data to improve posttreatment 
quality of life, well-being, and health outcomes and examine the feasibility of 
this digitally assisted workflow in a real-life setting in patients with 
colorectal cancer and acute myeloid leukemia.
METHODS: A total of 60 patients with colorectal cancer and 30 patients with 
acute myeloid leukemia will be recruited from 2 clinical centers: 
Universitätsmedizin der Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz (Mainz, Germany) 
and IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori "Dino Amadori" (IRST, 
Italy). Psychosocial data (eg, emotional distress, fatigue, quality of life, 
subjective well-being, sleep problems, and appetite loss) will be collected by 
questionnaires via a smartphone app, and physiological data (eg, heart rate, 
skin temperature, and movement through step count) will be collected by a 
customizable smart wrist-worn sensor device. Each patient will be assessed every 
2 weeks over their 3-month participation in the ONCORELIEF study. Inclusion 
criteria include patients with the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia or 
colorectal cancer, adult patients aged 18 years and older, life expectancy 
greater than 12 months, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 
≤2, and patients who have a smartphone and agree to use it for the purpose of 
the study. Exclusion criteria include patients with a reduced cognitive function 
(such as dementia) or technological illiteracy and other known active malignant 
neoplastic diseases (patients with a medical history of treated neoplastic 
disease are included).
RESULTS: The pilot study started on September 1, 2022. As of January 2023, we 
enrolled 33 patients with colorectal cancer and 7 patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia. As of January 2023, we have not yet started the data analysis. We 
expect to get all data in June 2023 and expect the results to be published in 
the second semester of 2023.
CONCLUSIONS: Web-based and mobile apps use methods from mathematical decision 
support and artificial intelligence through a closed-loop workflow that connects 
health professionals and patients. The ONCORELIEF system has the potential of 
continuously identifying, collecting, and processing data from diverse patient 
dimensions to offer health care recommendations, support patients with cancer to 
address their unmet needs, and optimize survivorship care.

INTRODUCTION: Premature mortality refers to deaths that occur before the 
expected age of death in a given population. Years of life lost (YLL) is a 
standard parameter that is frequently used to quantify some component of an 
"avoidable" mortality burden.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the studies on premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
mortality and synthesise their findings on YLL based on the regional area, main 
CVD types, sex, and study time.
METHOD: We conducted a systematic review of published CVD mortality studies that 
reported YLL as an indicator for premature mortality measurement. A literature 
search for eligible studies was conducted in five electronic databases: PubMed, 
Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials (CENTRAL). The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of 
the included studies. The synthesis of YLL was grouped into years of potential 
life lost (YPLL) and standard expected years of life lost (SEYLL) using 
descriptive analysis. These subgroups were further divided into WHO (World 
Health Organization) regions, study time, CVD type, and sex to reduce the effect 
of heterogeneity between studies.
RESULTS: Forty studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Of these, 17 
studies reported premature CVD mortality using YPLL, and the remaining 23 
studies calculated SEYLL. The selected studies represent all WHO regions except 
for the Eastern Mediterranean. The overall median YPLL and SEYLL rates per 
100,000 population were 594.2 and 1357.0, respectively. The YPLL rate and SEYLL 
rate demonstrated low levels in high-income countries, including Switzerland, 
Belgium, Spain, Slovenia, the USA, and South Korea, and a high rate in 
middle-income countries (including Brazil, India, South Africa, and Serbia). 
Over the past three decades (1990-2022), there has been a slight increase in the 
YPLL rate and the SEYLL rate for overall CVD and ischemic heart disease but a 
slight decrease in the SEYLL rate for cerebrovascular disease. The SEYLL rate 
for overall CVD demonstrated a notable increase in the Western Pacific region, 
while the European region has experienced a decline and the American region has 
nearly reached a plateau. In regard to sex, the male showed a higher median YPLL 
rate and median SEYLL rate than the female, where the rate in males 
substantially increased after three decades.
CONCLUSION: Estimates from both the YPLL and SEYLL indicators indicate that 
premature CVD mortality continues to be a major burden for middle-income 
countries. The pattern of the YLL rate does not appear to have lessened over the 
past three decades, particularly for men. It is vitally necessary to develop and 
execute strategies and activities to lessen this mortality gap.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of surgery in reducing neurological symptoms 
in patients with focal brain tuberculosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients with tuberculosis 
meningoencephalitis were studied. Among them, 20 people with a life expectancy 
of at least 6 months were identified, in whom foci with a ring-shaped 
accumulation of contrast along the periphery were determined during MSCT of the 
brain. Formed tuberculomas and abscesses were removed from 7 patients (group 1) 
under neuronavigation control. Indications for the operation were: the absence 
of a reduction in size for 3-4 months, the limitation of the lesion to 1-2 foci 
with reduction of perifocal edema according to MSCT and normalization of 
cerebrospinal fluid. Six patients had contraindications or refusals from 
operations (group 2). In 7 patients, there was a decrease in formations by the 
control period (group 3). Neurological symptoms in the groups at the beginning 
of the observation were similar. The duration of observation was 6-8 months.
RESULTS: In group 1, patients were discharged with improvement, postoperative 
cysts were determined in all of them at discharge. In group 2, 67% died. In 
group 3, 43% of patients had a complete reduction of foci during conservative 
treatment, in 57% cysts formed in place of foci. Neurological symptoms decreased 
in all groups, with the most decrease in group 1. However, statistical analysis 
did not show significant differences between the groups regarding the reduction 
of neurological symptoms. A significant difference in the mortality criterion 
between groups 1 and 2 was obtained.
CONCLUSION: Despite the absence of a significant effect on the reduction of 
neurological symptoms, the high survival rate of operated patients shows the 
need to remove tuberculosis formations in all the cases.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Оценка эффективности хирургического лечения в 
отношении остаточной неврологической симптоматики у больных с очаговым 
туберкулезным поражением головного мозга.
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: Обследованы 74 пациента с туберкулезным менингоэнцефалитом. 
Среди них выделены 20 больных с длительностью жизни от момента постановки 
диагноза не менее 6 мес, у которых при мультиспиральной компьютерной томографии 
(МСКТ) головного мозга определялись очаги с кольцевидным накоплением контраста 
по периферии. У 7 больных (1-я группа) под нейронавигационным контролем удалены 
сформировавшиеся туберкулемы и абсцессы. Показаниями к операции были отсутствие 
уменьшения размеров в течение 3—4 мес, ограниченность поражения 1—2 очагами при 
уменьшении перифокального отека по данным МСКТ и нормализации цереброспинальной 
жидкости (ЦСЖ). У 6 пациентов (2-я группа) были противопоказания или отказы от 
операций. У 7 больных (3-я группа) было отмечено уменьшение образований к 
контрольному сроку. Неврологические проявления в группах в начале наблюдения 
были однородными. Длительность наблюдения составляла 6—8 мес.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ И ОБСУЖДЕНИЕ: В 1-й группе пациенты выписаны с улучшением, при 
выписке на МСКТ у всех определялись послеоперационные ликворные кисты. Во 2-й 
группе умерли 67% больных. В 3-й группе в процессе консервативного лечения у 43% 
больных отмечена полная редукция очагов, у остальных — формирование на их месте 
кистозных образований. Неврологические проявления уменьшились во всех группах, в 
1-й группе — несколько больше. Однако статистический анализ не показал 
существенных различий между группами в отношении редукции неврологической 
симптоматики. Получена достоверная разница летальности между 1-й и 2-й группами.
ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ: Несмотря на отсутствие существенного влияния на редукцию 
неврологической симптоматики, высокая выживаемость прооперированных пациентов 
показывает необходимость удаления туберкулезных образований во всех наблюдениях.

BACKGROUND: Patients with spinal epidural metastases (SEM) often experience a 
reduction in ambulatory status and, thus, the quality of life. Predicting which 
patients will benefit from a surgical intervention remains a challenge. Life 
expectancy is an essential factor to be considered in surgical decision-making, 
although not the only one. Prediction models can add value in surgical 
decision-making. The goal of this study was to develop and internally validate a 
novel model (Limburg spinal metastases score [LSMS]) and compare the predictive 
value with 2 commonly used models: modified Bauer score and Oswestry Spinal Risk 
Index (OSRI).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 144 consecutive patients who underwent 
surgical decompression for SEM in our centers between November 2006 and December 
2020. Clinical and surgical parameters were evaluated. The novel prediction 
model was based on multivariate analysis and was internally validated. External 
validation of the 2 most commonly used prediction models was performed.
RESULTS: The median survival was 17 months, 55.7% of the immobile patients 
regained ambulation postoperatively. In 50 patients (34.7%), at least 1 
complication occurred within 30 days after surgery. The LSMS consists of 4 
parameters: primary tumor type, Karnofsky performance score, presence of 
visceral metastases, and presence of multiple spinal metastases. Bootstrap 
internal validation of the model developed on this cohort yielded an 
optimism-corrected c-statistic of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.71-0.80). The c-statistic of 
the OSRI score and the Bauer score was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.64-0.74) and 0.67 (95% 
CI: 0.62-0.72), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The LSMS consists of 4 parameters to assist surgical decision-making 
for patients with SEM. The score is easy to use and appears more accurate in our 
population in comparison with previous existing models.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A novel prediction model was developed to aid in surgical 
decision-making for patients with spinal epidural metastases.

Aging is associated with the generalized deterioration of the organism, being of 
great relevance experienced by homeostatic systems such as the nervous, immune, 
and endocrine systems, which increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. 
Among the lifestyle strategies that have been researched to improve these 
systems and achieve greater healthy longevity, this review will focus on the 
social environment. In order to verify the effectiveness of these both in the 
improvement of homeostasis and in life expectancy, the research carried out with 
experimental animals that have allowed this to be done will be discussed. In 
addition, as it has been observed that physical contact is crucial for the 
positive outcomes of social interaction on homeostatic systems and longevity to 
occur, we will focus on that mechanism, as well as some of the possible 
molecular pathways underlying the effects found.

BACKGROUND: Recently, the DESTINY-Breast04 trial revealed that trastuzumab 
deruxtecan (T-DXd) significantly prolonged overall survival in patients with 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low metastatic breast cancer 
(MBC). Considering the extraexpensive price of the new drug, a 
cost-effectiveness analysis of T-DXd is necessary to perform in the United 
States. In addition, because T-DXd has not been marketed in China, the pricing 
is a very important driver for the cost-effectiveness of T-DXd. The range of 
drug costs for which T-DXd could be considered cost-effective from a Chinese 
healthcare system perspective was explored.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of T-DXd 
versus physician's choice of chemotherapy (PCC). The simulation time horizon for 
this model was the life-time of patients. Transition probabilities were based on 
data from the DESTINY-Breast04 trial. Health utility data were derived from 
published studies. Outcome measures were costs (in 2022 US$), life-years (LYs), 
quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed the uncertainty 
of key model parameters and their joint impact on the base-case results.
RESULTS: The model predicted that T-DXd provided an improvement of 0.84 LYs and 
0.58 QALYs compared to PCC, with an ICER of $259,452.05 per QALY in the United 
States and $87,646.40 per QALY in China. The one-way sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that the price of T-DXd had the greatest impact on ICERs. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted that the probabilities of T-DXd 
being cost-effective compared to PCC were 7.2% and 0% at a willingness-to-pay of 
$150,000 per QALY in the United States and $36,475 per QALY (3 times the per 
capita gross domestic product) in China, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed 
that T-DXd was more effective for patients without visceral disease at baseline, 
followed by patients with Asian ethnic, patients without prior CDK 4/6 
inhibitors therapy, and patients with HER2-1+ (IHC detection) status.
CONCLUSION: T-DXd was unlikely to offer a reasonable value for the money spent 
compared to PCC for patients with HER2-low MBC in the United States. A 
value-based price for T-DXd was reduced by 51% in the United States and less 
than $1950 per cycle in China.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Abaloparatide (ABL) significantly increases bone 
mineral density in men with osteoporosis similar to what was reported in 
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The cost effectiveness of sequential 
treatment with ABL followed by alendronate (ALN) in men at high fracture risk 
was compared to relevant alternative treatments.
METHODS: A Markov-based microsimulation model based on a lifetime US healthcare 
decision maker perspective was developed to evaluate the cost (expressed in 
US$2021) per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained of sequential ABL/ALN. 
Comparators were sequential treatment unbranded teriparatide (TPTD)/ALN, generic 
ALN monotherapy, and no treatment. Discount rates of 3% were used. Consistent 
with practice guidelines, patients received 18 months of ABL or TPTD followed by 
ALN for 5 years, or 5 years of ALN monotherapy. Analyses were conducted in 
high-risk men aged over 50 years defined as having a bone mineral density 
T-score ≤-2.5 and a recent fracture. Time-specific risk of subsequent fracture 
after a recent fracture, incremental costs up to 5 years following fractures, 
real-world medication adherence, and mostly US men-specific data were included 
in the model. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
assess the robustness of results.
RESULTS: Over the full age range, sequential ABL/ALN led to more QALYs for lower 
costs than sequential unbranded TPTD/ALN, while no treatment was dominated (more 
QALYs, lower costs) by ALN monotherapy. The costs per QALY gained of sequential 
ABL/ALN were lower than the US threshold of US$150,000 versus generic ALN 
monotherapy. The probabilities that sequential ABL/ALN was cost effective 
compared to ALN monotherapy were estimated at 51% in men aged 50 years and 
between 88 and 90% in those aged ≥ 60 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Sequential therapy using ABL/ALN may be cost effective compared 
with generic ALN monotherapy in US men aged ≥ 50 years at high fracture risk, 
especially in those aged ≥ 60 years. Unbranded TPTD/ALN and no treatment were 
dominated interventions (less QALY, more costs) compared with ABL/ALN or ALN 
monotherapy.

OBJECTIVES: Tetanus is a serious infectious disease. In recent decades, the 
epidemiology and disease characteristics of tetanus have been reported by many 
medical workers, but these studies usually have limited sample sizes.
METHODS: We retrieved all the epidemiological data related to tetanus from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, and a secondary analysis was performed to 
report the global epidemiology and disease burden of tetanus.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the incidence and death rate of tetanus decreased 
worldwide. In general, high sociodemographic index (SDI) countries have lower 
age-standard incidence rates and age-standard death rates than low SDI 
countries. Moreover, in low SDI regions, newborns were the highest-risk group 
for tetanus. In high SDI areas, half of the tetanus cases occurred in the 70+ 
years age group. The disease burden of tetanus was significantly higher in males 
than in females.
CONCLUSION: The disease burden of tetanus decreased significantly worldwide from 
1990 to 2019. Neonatal tetanus is serious in low SDI areas, whereas the 
proportion of elderly tetanus is the highest in high SDI areas. The containment 
of tetanus in all age groups and sex still requires effort from all sectors.

The demand for organic table grapes is increasing worldwide. However, 
comprehensive information of quality parameters and phytochemical compounds in 
organically grown fruit remain unclear. Furthermore, table grapes are perishable 
and postharvest quality retention and waste prevention is very important. In 
this study we have compared the differences between organic and non-organic 
table grapes in terms of phytochemical compounds and quality parameters as well 
as the changes in the expression levels of pathogen related and lytic genes 
during storage. Organic fruit showed higher levels of phenolics, flavonoids, 
caffeic acid, hydrogen peroxide, protein content, antioxidant and anti-stress 
enzymes and total antioxidant activities at harvest and during storage. 
Although, the expression levels of polygalactronases, pectin methyl esterase, 
chitinase and glucanase genes was lower in organically grown table grapes at 
harvest, but the expression of all these genes was significantly increased 
during cold storage. After 60 days of cold storage the expression levels of 
pectin methyl esterase, chitinase and glucanase genes was significantly higher 
than the conventionally grown grape berries in organic ones. The highest 
expression of polygalacturonase was recorded in organic samples after 30 days of 
storage. There was no significant difference between the two types of table 
grapes for decay extension and tissue deterioration rate. The results of this 
study indicate that due to higher levels of phytochemicals and antioxidant 
compounds the organic table grapes have a higher nutritional quality. 
Furthermore, the increase in PR and pectolytic genes expression levels is enough 
for decreasing the fruit susceptibility to decay pathogens and enhancing the 
postharvest life of organic grapes.

The efficacy and applicability of Plasma Activated Ice (PAI) -produced by cold 
atmospheric plasma (CAP) technology- on microorganisms and quality 
characteristics of perishable fresh sea bream (Sparus aurata) fillets, were 
evaluated. The changes in microbiological load and quality characteristics of 
fish fillets were investigated during storage with ice from deionized water 
(Control), PAI and ice from artificially produced water (Artificial) of H2O2 
concentrations equal to those of PAI. Fresh sea bream fillets were packed under 
ice flakes (produced from PAI or Artificial or Control) on layers (as typically 
done in the relevant industry) and stored at 0.5 °C for 27 days. PAI application 
inhibited significantly the growth of microbial load of the fillets resulting in 
reduced growth rates while simultaneously significantly retarded the quality 
deterioration compared to the other disinfectant media. The use of PAI (with 
10 mg/L H2O2) led to a 11-day and 6-day extension, i.e., 2-fold and a ∼ 1.5-fold 
extension, of the fillets shelf-life compared to the samples treated with 
Control and Artificial ice, respectively. The results proved the efficiency of 
PAI in extending the shelf-life of perishable foods during storage (or/and 
transportation), by validating its antimicrobial properties and cooling 
capacity.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is defined as a "distressing, 
persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness 
or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to 
recent activity and interferes with usual functioning." CRF is frequently 
observed in cancer patients even before the initiation of tumor therapy. Its 
cause is not clear, but in addition to primary effects of therapy, a 
tumor-induced elevated level of inflammatory cytokines may play a role. 
Transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a noninvasive way to 
activate central nervous pathways and modulate pain perception and the immune 
system. It has positive effects on autoimmune conditions and can also improve 
fatigue associated with Sjogren's syndrome. It is the main purpose of this 
feasibility study to investigate the feasibility of daily taVNS against CRF. 
Therefore, the stimulation protocol of the newly introduced smartphone app of 
the manufacturer is evaluated. Additionally, the effect taVNS on CRF and quality 
of life (QoL) shall be evaluated.
METHODS: Thirty adult patients with gastrointestinal tumors during or after 
treatment, relevant CRF (Hornheide questionnaire) and life expectancy > 1 year, 
are enrolled. Patients are randomized to treatment or sham arm and be informed 
that they will either feel the stimulation or not. Treatment group will receive 
left-sided tragus above-threshold stimulation with 25 Hz, 250 µs pulse width, 
and 28-s/32-s on/off paradigm for 4 h throughout the day for 4 weeks. Sham group 
will receive no stimulation via a nonfunctional electrode. A daily stimulation 
protocol with time and average intensity is automatically created by a 
smartphone app connected to the stimulator via Bluetooth®. Multidimensional 
Fatigue Inventory-20, Short-Form 36 and Beck Depression Inventory questionnaires 
will be filled out before and after 4 weeks of stimulation.
DISCUSSION: Primarily, the patients' daily stimulation time and intensity will 
be evaluated through the electronic protocol after 4 weeks. Secondarily, the 
effect of taVNS on cancer-related fatigue and QoL will be measured through the 
questionnaires. As taVNS seems to modulate inflammatory cytokines, this 
noninvasive method may - if accepted by the patients - be a promising adjunct in 
the treatment of cancer-related fatigue.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by local ethics committee (21-7395) 
and registered at the DRKS database (DRKS00027481).

INTRODUCTION: Adults with Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) are at increased 
risk for psychiatric comorbidities, personality traits, and abnormality in 
executive function. But studies on adolescents and their impact on quality of 
life are scarce in the literature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed between August 
2019 and October 2022 to compare the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in 
adolescents with JME and age and gender-matched healthy controls. After 
completing DSM-5 Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-5) initially in all 
patients, we measured the severity of individual psychiatric problems like 
anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms by using an appropriate psychometric 
scale. We also measured both groups' intelligence quotient (IQ), executive 
function, and quality of life.
RESULTS: One hundred patients with JME (14.3 ± 2.5 years, 48 boys) and 100 
controls were enrolled. Psychiatric disorders were observed in 46% of JME and 6% 
of controls (p < 0.01). Psychiatric comorbidities noted in the patients with JME 
were: somatic symptom and related disorders(n = 14), anxiety (n = 13), 
adjustment disorders (n = 12), depression (n = 11), oppositional defiant 
disorder (n = 6), conduct disorder (n = 5), anorexia nervosa (n = 3), 
narcissistic (n = 3), histrionic (n = 1), substance-related disorder (n = 1), 
borderline (n = 2) and antisocial personality disorder (n = 2). The prevalence 
of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, adjustment disorders, somatic 
symptoms, related disorders, and any personality disorder was significantly more 
in the JME group (p < 0.01 for all). Female gender, higher Epilepsy Stigma Scale 
score, and lower Epilepsy Outcome Expectancy Scale were significantly associated 
with depressive disorders (p = 0.04, 0.03, 0.03 respectively). Similarly, for 
anxiety, only female gender and lower Epilepsy Outcome Expectancy Scale were 
significant associated factors (p = 0.03, 0.02 respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric disorders like anxiety, depression, and personality 
disorders are more frequent in adolescents with JME than in controls.

Although nodal metastasis (NM) is an important prognostic factor of ampullary 
adenocarcinoma, the prognostic implication of extranodal extension (ENE) is not 
well characterized. NM with ENE status was investigated in 279 surgically 
resected ampullary adenocarcinoma patients and compared with other 
clinicopathologic factors, including overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free 
survival (RFS). Expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, 
including E-cadherin, Twist, and Snail, was assessed in a subset of the cohort. 
NM was observed in 94 cases (33.7%), of which ENE was observed in 32 cases 
(34%). NM with ENE was more frequently associated with tumors with poor 
differentiation than NM without ENE (P = .017). The 5-year OS and RFS rates of 
patients with NM and ENE was significantly worse (13.0% and 6.3%) than those 
with NM without ENE (37.7% and 21.4%) and those without NM (57.6% and 50.2%, 
respectively; P < .001). When pN category was matched, the OS and RFS was worse 
in patients with ENE than in those without ENE (P < .05). Moreover, the 
expression of E-cadherin and Twist was significantly different between NM areas 
with and without ENE (all, P < .001). Since ENE was associated with poorly 
differentiated ampullary adenocarcinomas and showed different expression of EMT 
markers, EMT could be a possible mechanism of ENE. Ampullary adenocarcinoma 
patients with ENE had worse OS and RFS than those without ENE. Therefore, 
evaluation of ENE can provide additional survival information for patients with 
surgically resected ampullary carcinoma.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with schizophrenia have a 15- to 20-year shorter life 
expectancy compared with the general population. The aim of this study was to 
explore these patients' perception of their physical health.
METHODS: A patient reported outcomes measure (PROM) has been developed by 
patients with severe mental disease. This survey had to better capture 
undetected, under-rated and non-prioritized physical domains by traditional 
routine clinical scales that are important for people who live with mental 
health disease. These patients have tested the applicability of this PROM with 
peers with severe mental disease in medical, social and community-based centers 
from Hauts-de-France.
RESULTS: Two and a half years have been required to develop this PROM, to test 
its applicability to patients with severe mental disease and to analyze the 
results. The study process has been slowed by the sanitary context induced by 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty-two questionnaires have been collected by the 
participants. Despite this low number of data, participants have been satisfied 
by the results and their experience. The results show that people with severe 
mental disease consider physical health as a major concern, notably pain and 
somatic diseases. External factors (such as accessibility to health care and 
medication) and internal factors (such as self-esteem, cognitive and negative 
symptoms, sleep, alimentation, and substance use) have been identified as 
barriers for physical health.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the development of PROMs highlighting 
personal experience of people with severe mental disease. The data obtained 
thanks to these measures will allow to build programs to help them to cope with 
barriers for physical health.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To determine the cost-effectiveness of anti-obesity 
medications (AOM): tirzepatide, semaglutide, liraglutide, phentermine plus 
topiramate (PpT), and naltrexone plus bupropion (NpB).
METHODS AND RESULTS: From a U.S. perspective we developed a Markov model to 
simulate weight change over a 40-year time horizon using results from clinical 
studies. According to the body mass index (BMI), cardiovascular diseases, 
diabetes and mortality risk were the health states considered in the model, 
being mutually exclusive. Costs of AOM, adverse events, cardiovascular events, 
and diabetes were included. We applied a 3% per-year discount rate and 
calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
incorporated uncertainty in input parameters. A deterministic analysis was 
conducted to determine the robustness of the model. The model included a cohort 
of 78.2% females with a mean age of 45 years and BMI of 37.1 (SD 4.9) for 
females and 36.8 (SD 4.9) for males. NpB and PpT were the least costly
