have recently investigated a drug conjugate consisting of an affibody molecule 
targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), fused to an 
albumin-binding domain (ABD) for half-life extension, loaded with the cytotoxic 
maytansine derivative DM1. In this study, we investigated the impact of the 
cytotoxic payload on binding properties, cytotoxicity and biodistribution by 
comparing DM1 with the auristatins MMAE and MMAF, as part of the drug conjugate. 
All constructs had specific and high affinity binding to HER2, human and mouse 
albumins with values in the low- to sub-nM range. ZHER2-ABD-mcMMAF demonstrated 
the most potent cytotoxic effect on several HER2-over-expressing cell lines. In 
an experimental therapy study, the MMAF-based conjugate provided complete tumor 
regression in 50% of BALB/c nu/nu mice bearing HER2-over-expressing SKOV3 tumors 
at a 2.9 mg/kg dose, while the same dose of ZHER2-ABD-mcDM1 provided only a 
moderate anti-tumor effect. A comparison with the non-targeting ZTaq-ABD-mcMMAF 
control demonstrated HER2-targeting specificity. In conclusion, a combination of 
potent cytotoxicity in vitro, with minimal uptake in normal organs in vivo, and 
efficient delivery to tumors provided a superior anti-tumor effect of 
ZHER2-ABD-mcMMAF, while maintaining a favorable toxicity profile with no 
observed adverse effects.

CONTEXT: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are widely used in the management 
of patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC). However, its performance 
in aUC patients with poor performance status (PS) remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the impact of patients' performance status on the 
oncologic outcomes in patients with aUC treated with ICIs.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from 
inception until July 2022 to identify studies assessing the association between 
the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS and the oncologic outcomes in 
patients with aUC treated with ICIs in randomised (RCTs) and nonrandomised 
(NRCTs) control studies according to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The outcomes of our 
interests were overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), 
progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR).
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Overall, six RCTs comprising 5428 patients and 32 NRCTs 
comprising 6069 patients were included. The meta-analysis of the RCTs revealed 
that patients with ECOG PS = 0 and PS ≥1 had a trend towards better OS with ICIs 
compared with those treated with chemotherapy (pooled hazard ratio [HR]: 0.86, 
95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-1.04, and HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.53-1.03, 
respectively). There was no significant difference in terms of response to ICIs 
between patients with poor and good PS (I2 = 0%, p = 0.46). The meta-analysis of 
the NRCTs revealed that patients with PS ≥2 had significantly worse OS than 
those with PS <2 (pooled HR: 2.52, 95% CI: 2.00-3.17), as well as worse CSS 
(pooled HR: 3.35, 95% CI: 1.90-5.91), PFS (pooled HR: 2.89, 95% CI: 1.67-5.01), 
and ORR (pooled odds ratio: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.27-0.82). Similarly, patients with 
PS ≥1 had significantly worse oncologic outcomes than those with PS = 0.
CONCLUSIONS: In the NRCTs, poor PS was correlated with worse oncologic outcomes 
in aUC patients treated with ICIs. In the RCTs, ICIs performed better than 
chemotherapy across all PS categories. These findings should be interpreted with 
caution due to the high heterogeneity across the studies and patient 
populations. More RCTs including poor PS are needed to assess the impact of PS 
on ICI therapy outcomes.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Immune therapy for patients with urothelial carcinoma should 
not be restricted on the grounds of performance status. However, patients with 
poor performance status should be considered for other factors such as life 
expectancy and comorbidities.

Deciphering information hidden in the gene expression assays for identifying 
disease subtypes has significant importance in precision medicine. However, 
computational limitations thwart this process due to the intricacy of the 
biological networks and the curse of dimensionality of gene expression data. 
Therefore, clustering in such scenarios often becomes the first choice of 
exploratory data analysis to identify natural structures and intrinsic patterns 
in the data. However, sparse and high dimensional nature of omics data prevents 
conventional clustering algorithms to discover subtypes that are clinically 
relevant and statistically significant. Hence, non-linear dimensionality 
reduction techniques coupled with clustering in such scenarios often becomes 
imperative to improve the clustering results. In this study, we present a robust 
pipeline to discover disease subtypes with clinical relevance. Specifically, we 
focus on discovering patient sub-groups that have a residual life patterns 
remarkably different from other sub-groups. This is significant because by 
refining prognosis, subtyping can reduce uncertainty in approximating patients 
expected outcome. The methodology present is based on robust correlation 
estimation, UMAP- a non-linear dimensionality reduction method and mapper- a 
tool from topology. Notably, we suggest a method for improving the robustness of 
the correlation matrix of gene expression data for improving the clustering 
results. The performance of the model is evaluated by applying to five cancer 
datasets obtained through TCGA and comparisons are performed with some state of 
the art methods of NEMO, RSC-OTRI and SNF with regard to log-rank test and 
Restricted Life Expectancy Difference. For example in GBM dataset, the minimum 
separation for any two discovered subtypes is 221 days which is significantly 
higher than the other methodologies. We also compared the results without using 
the robust correlation based estimate and observed that robust correlation 
improves separability between survival curves significantly. From the results we 
infer that our methodology performs better compared to other methodologies with 
regard to separating survival curves of patient sub-groups despite using single 
omics profiles of patients compared to multiple omics profiles of SNF and NEMO. 
Pathway over-representation analysis is performed on the final clustering 
results to investigate the biological underpinnings characterizing each subtype.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of food insecurity and its relationship to diet 
quality are factors impacting the health of persons living across the United 
States-affiliated Pacific region (USAP).
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe characterize the relationship 
between household food security status and diet quality of 2- to 8-y-old 
children across jurisdictions in the USAP.
METHODS: Baseline data from 2- to 8-y-olds (n = 3099) enrolled in the Children's 
Healthy Living Program for Remote Underserved Minority Populations in the 
Pacific region, an obesity prevention study conducted in communities across 
Alaska, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), 
Guam, and Hawaii, and a concomitant prevalence study in communities across the 
Freely Associated States (FAS) (the Federated States of Micronesia: Kosrae, 
Pohnpei, Chuuk, Yap; Republic of Marshall Islands; Republic of Palau) were 
collected in 2012. Caregivers self-reported sociodemographic data and food 
insecurity. Assisted by their caregiver, children completed two dietary records 
on nonconsecutive, randomly assigned days. The Healthy Eating Index 2005 
(HEI-2005) was used to assess the diet quality. Data were summarized overall and 
by jurisdiction. Differences in HEI-2005 and HEI component scores among 
jurisdictions and by household food security status were tested using 1-factor 
ANOVA.
RESULTS: Half or more of participants from American Samoa, Guam, CNMI, and FAS 
reported household food insecurity (n = 295, 59.7%; n = 292, 49.9%; n = 267, 
54.6%; n = 572, 69.0%, respectively). HEI-2005 scores varied by jurisdiction (P 
< 0.001) and were significantly lower among FAS participants (54.7 ± 1.2) than 
among all other jurisdictions (P < 0.05). Total diet quality scores did not 
differ by food security status (59.9 ± 0.8 food secure compared with 58.3 ± 1.1 
food insecure, P = 0.07); however, most diet quality adequacy component scores 
were significantly higher and moderation component scores significantly lower 
among participants in food secure households than those in food insecure 
households.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in children's diet quality and household 
food security existed across USAP jurisdictions.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a structured, short-term 
psychotherapy approach that may have positive effects in terms of relieving 
postoperative pain. The main objective of this study was to determine the effect 
of CBT on pain and joint function in patients after total joint arthroplasty.
METHODS: We searched 3 electronic databases including randomized controlled 
studies (RCTs) using CBT as an intervention. The main results of this study were 
to determine pain intensity by NRS, VAS, WOMAC pain Scale, PCS, and joint 
function by HHS, OKS, EQ-5D, ROM. Data extraction and quality assessment of 
included RCTs were independently performed by the authors and date analysis was 
performed by RevMan V.5.4.
RESULTS: Among the 605 studies, 9 RCTS were included in this systematic review 
and meta-analysis. The study showed that the difference between CBT and usual 
care groups in PCS (≤3months), NRS, VAS (≤3months) were statistically 
significant (P < 0.05); the difference between CBT and usual care groups in PCS 
(≥12months), WOMAC Pain Scale, and VAS (≥12months) were not statistically 
significant (P > 0.05), indicating that CBT can improve pain in patients after 
arthroplasty in the early term. In addition, the difference between CBT and 
usual care groups in OKS (≤3months), HSS, ROM (≤3months), EQ-5D (≤3months) were 
not statistically significant (P > 0.05); the difference between CBT and usual 
care groups in EQ-5D (≥12months) were statistically significant (P < 0.05), 
indicating that the quality of life in patients after total joint arthroplasty 
were improved with the extension of follow-up time.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that CBT can relieve pain in patients with total 
joint arthroplasty in the early postoperative period and improve quality of life 
to some extent over time.

Parenteral Nutrition in Pediatric Patients with Neurodisability: Current 
Perspectives.

Pediatric neurodisability describes functional limitations in children with 
varied severity and complexity often attributed to brain or neuromuscular 
abnormalities. The life expectancy of children with neurodisability is 
improving, but many will require significant medical support. The 
gastrointestinal tract is usually affected in children with neurodisability and 
can lead to a wide range of symptoms. In gastrointestinal (GI) dystonia, a newly 
coined term, feeding will trigger a distressing dystonia and symptoms can 
improve with cessation of feed. Parenteral nutrition (PN) is often viewed as a 
viable option in severe GI dystonia or when enteral feeding does not support 
sufficient nutrition. The use of PN in children with severe neurodisability is 
complex. It involves an intricate interplay between medical, psychological and 
ethical factors. In the absence of a universally agreed guidance on the use of 
PN in this cohort, paediatricians should maintain the individual need of the 
child at the centre of the decision-making process and work closely with 
families and other healthcare professionals before initiating or withholding PN 
in children with severe neurodisability. In this article, we discuss the complex 
and multifaceted approach to the use of PN in children with severe 
neurodisability and aimed to explore the medical, psychological and ethical 
aspect dilemmas facing clinicians looking after children with declining gut 
function who may require PN support.

Background: Patients with symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) have 
hip strength deficits, instability, and increased risk for concomitant injury. 
While surgical intervention is an effective method of treatment for FAI, more 
information is needed about the recovery process. Purposes: We sought to 
understand how patients with FAI recover from surgical correction in the short 
term. Do patients' perceptions of improvement correspond with measured 
improvements in hip strength? Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study 
of 17 patients (11 male, age range: 16-38 years) who were diagnosed with 
symptomatic FAI at a single surgeon's practice. Hip strength (flexion, 
extension, and abduction) was measured preoperatively and at 14, 26, and 52 
weeks postoperatively. Patient-reported outcomes using the modified Harris Hip 
Score (mHHS) and Hip Outcome Osteoarthritis Score (HOOS) subscales were measured 
at the same time points and at 2 weeks postoperatively. Results: Compared with 
preoperative values, there was a significant increase in postoperative values at 
26 and 52 weeks in normalized isokinetic hip extension (29% and 38%, 
respectively) and normalized hip abduction (48% and 55%, respectively). No 
differences in strength were observed at 14 weeks. Modified Harris Hip Score and 
all HOOS subscales were decreased by 2 weeks postoperatively, and by 14 weeks 
mHHS improved by 21%, and HOOS subscales improved as well (activities of daily 
living by 18%, pain by 34%, quality of life by 69%, sport and recreation by 36%, 
and symptoms by 28%). Conclusion: We observed that patient-reported outcomes 
including symptoms, function, and satisfaction improved at 14 weeks, while 
objective measures of hip strength improved at 26 weeks following surgical 
correction of FAI. More rigorous study is indicated.

Non-responders to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) represent a high-risk, 
and difficult to treat population of heart failure patients. Studies have shown 
that these patients have a lower quality of life and reduced life expectancy 
compared to those who respond to CRT. Whilst the first-line treatment for 
dyssynchronous heart failure is "conventional" biventricular epicardial CRT, a 
range of novel pacing interventions have emerged as potential alternatives. This 
has raised the question whether these new treatments may be useful as a 
second-line pacing intervention for treating non-responders, or indeed, whether 
some patients may benefit from these as a first-line option. In this review, we 
will examine the current evidence for four pacing interventions in the context 
of treatment of conventional CRT non-responders: CRT optimization; multisite 
left ventricular pacing; left ventricular endocardial pacing and conduction 
system pacing.

BACKGROUND: As it becomes increasing clear that managing Crohn's disease (CD) 
requires more than medical treatment alone, further research to identify 
second-line approaches for managing CD and its symptoms such as physical 
activity (PA) are necessary to address this public health concern.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of descriptive, cross-sectional, and 
experimental studies to synthesize evidence regarding PA rates, determinants, 
health consequences, and interventions specifically in adults with CD. Adhering 
to the Preferred Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for 
scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, published literature was searched to 
identify articles that examined PA or exercise in adults with CD.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight articles met inclusion criteria: 13 included a 
cross-sectional design, 4 a case-control design, 2 cohort designs, and 9 
intervention designs. Adults with CD appear to be similar to somewhat less 
physically active than the general population, though self-report and objective 
rates of PA vary widely by geographical location. PA may be associated with the 
reduced risk of future active disease in adults with CD in clinical remission, 
as well as improve health-related quality of life, fatigue, cardiorespiratory 
fitness, and depression. Preliminary findings from interventional studies 
demonstrate that moderate-intensity PA is feasible, safe, and may have 
beneficial effects on disease activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the benefits that can be accrued from regular PA are quite 
diverse; however, a substantially larger body of evidence is needed to provide 
firmer conclusions on the health benefits of PA that might underlie 
exercise-related changes in function and disease activity in adults with CD.

INTRODUCTION: Achieving and maintaining glycemic control is the cornerstone of 
type 1 diabetes management, with the aim of reducing the incidence of 
diabetes-related complications over the long term. However, many individuals 
fail to reach glycemic targets. The present study evaluated the clinical and 
economic burden associated with poor glycemic control in people with type 1 
diabetes in the Netherlands, and the improvements in outcomes that can be 
achieved by improving treatment.
METHODS: Immediate glycemic control, defined as achieving a glycated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c) target of 7.0% at the start of the analysis, was compared with delays in 
achieving control of 1, 3 and 7 years, with outcomes projected using the IQVIA 
CORE Diabetes Model. Projections of life expectancy, quality-adjusted life 
expectancy, and direct and indirect costs (expressed in 2021 euros [EUR]) were 
made at a patient level and extrapolated to the population level.
RESULTS: Improving HbA1c from 8.0% to 7.0% and 9.0% to 7.0% resulted in gains of 
up to 0.66 and 1.37 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient over a 
lifetime, respectively. At a population level, achieving immediate glycemic 
control was associated with gains of 9438, 27,171 and 72,717 QALYs and cost 
savings of up to EUR 224 million, EUR 556 million and EUR 1.3 billion compared 
with remaining in poor control for 1, 3 and 7 years, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The clinical and economic burden of poor glycemic control in people 
with type 1 diabetes in the Netherlands was projected to be substantial, but 
considerable gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy and cost savings could be 
achieved through early and effective treatment.

INTRODUCTION: The development of social infrastructure projects in medicine 
corresponds to transforming public priorities toward social development in 
general and health care in particular. Therefore, there is a need to develop 
comprehensive quantitative methods for evaluating such projects.
METHODS: This paper uses a combination of two approaches: first, cost-benefit 
analysis taking into account the relationship between financial and economic 
efficiency; second, the study of the efficiency of participation in a 
public-private partnership concerning project efficiency. The model's financial 
bloc is focused on analyzing the return on investment in fixed and working 
capital, considering the terminal value. The economic bloc includes social and 
tax effects (along with environmental, price, indirect, and other specific 
public effects). We apply fixed effects regression models to calculate 
multipliers used to estimate the social effects. Multipliers are based on: 
public health expenditure, human development index, and life expectancy. The 
proposed methodology has been adapted for evaluating the Seven Polyclinics' 
project as a flagship project for developing social infrastructure in the 
Novosibirsk Region.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The evaluation results revealed a deficient level of 
financial efficiency of the project characterized by negative net present value 
and low internal rate of return. Simultaneously, the efficiency of participation 
in the project for private investors using the public-private partnership 
mechanism is characterized by high rates of return on private investment. In the 
transition to the economic analysis, the results fundamentally change, taking 
into account social and tax effects and detecting an exceptionally high level of 
all economic indicators of the project. As the project's primary beneficiaries, 
the economic analysis identified polyclinic patients who received the 
opportunity to acquire new medical services. At the same time, within the 
financial analysis framework, the mechanisms for implementing the project were 
determined, ensuring the consistency of interests. The distribution of effects 
among the project participants was compared for various funding methods, 
including the public-private partnerships mechanism. It is shown that the 
project implementation leads to significant social effects and provides a 
noticeable improvement in population health. The proposed methodology can be 
used for decision making on the implementation of similar projects.

PURPOSE: To study the status quo of the cognitive function of the breast cancer 
patients with (who went through) the endocrine therapy by the epidemiological 
investigation, analyze the key factor of the cognition impairment and explore 
the impact of the endocrine therapy time on the cognition decline after using 
Propensity Score Matching to balance the covariates.
METHODS: In this study, the epidemiological questionnaire information was 
collected from 226 female breast cancer endocrine treatment patients who visited 
the Breast Clinic of Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of 
Chinese Medicine from November 2020 to February 2022, and the results of the 
overall cognitive function, the function test of each cognitive domain, the 
patient's self-cognition, quality of life, and emotional status evaluation of 
the patients. In this study, according to the principle of random matching, the 
nearest matching method with a matching tolerance of 0.2 and a matching ratio of 
1:2 was used for orientation score matching. After the covariant such as age, 
BMI, and duration of education were balanced, the effects of the duration of 
endocrine therapy on the overall cognitive function and the functions of each 
cognitive domain were analyzed.
RESULTS: In 226 cases of female breast cancer patients (who went through) the 
endocrine therapy, the propensity score matching was performed, ultimately, 99 
were ruled out, successful matched ones were 49 of the cognition-decline group 
and 78 of the standard group. With age, education time, BMI and other covariates 
balanced, the endocrine therapy duration was the risk factor of the cognition 
impairment (P < 0.05, OR = 1.296, 95% CI = 1.008-1.665), with the extension of 
endocrine treatment time, there was a rising risk of the cognition impairment 
(LLA statistic = 5.872, P < 0.05). The cognitive domain scores in the 
cognition-decline group were lower than the standard group (P < 0.05), but there 
was a difference in self-report cognition.
CONCLUSION: The endocrine therapy duration was the risk factor for the cognition 
impairment of the breast cancer patients, and with prolonged endocrine 
treatment, there was a rising (an increasing) risk for the cognition impairment.

Japan.

BACKGROUND: We investigated the prognosis, sequelae, and related factors of 
severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients who required invasive mechanical 
ventilation 6 months after discharge from the hospital.
METHODS: COVID-19 patients admitted to Kishiwada Tokusyukai Hospital between 
April 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021, and treated with an invasive mechanical 
ventilator were included in this study. We conducted a telephone visit 6 months 
after discharge to confirm survival and asked questions about sequelae.
RESULTS: The mortality rate 6 months after discharge was 7.4%. Tracheostomy 
(odds ratio [OR], 0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.003-0.26), high Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (16.0 [interquartile range 
[IQR], 11.5-17.2] vs. 11.0 [IQR, 8.0-14.0]), prolonged hospital stay (17.0 [IQR, 
12.7-24.5] vs. 10.0 [IQR, 8.0-13.0]), and prolonged ventilation duration (12.5 
[IQR, 10.7-20.0] vs. 8.0 [IQR, 6.0-11.0]) were associated with the risk of 
death. Moreover, 49% of the patients had residual disability. The most common 
sequelae were hoarseness, respiratory distress on exertion (31% of symptomatic 
patients), and muscle weakness (22%). The prone positioning therapy (OR, 5.55; 
95% CI, 1.35-32.97) was associated with hoarseness, and the use of muscle 
relaxants (OR, infinity; 95% CI, 1.14-infinity) was a risk factor for muscle 
weakness.
CONCLUSION: Although the mortality rate after the acute phase of COVID-19 was 
not high, many patients experienced sequelae. Careful treatment should be 
continued after the end of acute treatment for patients with prolonged 
respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Muscle relaxants and prone positioning 
therapy may cause sequelae and should be performed carefully.

BACKGROUND: Spinal fusion is a well-established procedure in the treatment of 
degenerative spinal diseases. Previous research shows that the use of this 
operative treatment has been growing in recent decades in industrialized 
countries and has become one of the most cost-intensive surgical procedures. It 
seems that in some countries such as Germany-with its large, industrialized, 
European population-this increase is mainly driven by demographic changes with 
low fertility rates, increasing life expectancy, and an aging population. Based 
on current projections, however, Germany faces a population trend that many 
other countries are likely to follow within a few decades. An increasingly 
shrinking and aging working population may eventually put the healthcare system 
under enormous pressure, with greater demands for spinal fusions and associated 
higher costs. Thus, we aimed to provide reliable projections regarding the 
future demand for posterior spinal fusion procedures including age- and 
gender-related trends up to 2060, which will be necessary for future resource 
planning and possible improvements in actual treatment strategies.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) How is the use of posterior spinal fusions in Germany 
expected to change from 2019 through 2060, if currents trends continue? (2) How 
is the use of posterior spinal fusions in Germany expected to change depending 
on patients' age and gender during this time period?
METHODS: Comprehensive nationwide data provided by the Federal Statistical 
Office, the official institution for documenting all data on operations and 
procedures performed in Germany, were used to quantify posterior spinal fusion 
rates as a function of calendar year, age, and gender. Because there is a lack 
of evidence regarding future trends in the use of posterior spinal fusions, an 
autoregressive integrated moving average model on historical procedure rates 
from 2005 to 2019 in relation to official population projections from 2020 to 
2060 was chosen to forecast future absolute numbers and incidence rates of this 
procedure in Germany. Long-term forecasting is more prone to unexpected 
disruptions than forecasting over short-term periods; however, longer spans 
facilitate estimates of how trends may challenge future healthcare systems if 
those trends continue, and thus are useful for research and planning.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of posterior spinal fusion was projected to increase 
by approximately 83% (95% CI 28% to 139%) to 102% per 100,000 inhabitants (95% 
CI 71% to 133%) in 2060, with a 1.3-fold higher rate of women undergoing surgery 
in terms of absolute numbers. The highest increase identified by the model 
occurred in patients 75 years and older with 38,974 (95% CI 27,294 to 50,653) 
posterior spinal fusions in 2060, compared with 14,657 in 2019. This trend 
applied for both women and men, with a 246% (95% CI 138% to 355%) increase in 
the total number of posterior spinal fusions for women 75 years and older and a 
296% (95% CI 222% to 370%) increase for men 75 years and older. At the same 
time, posterior spinal fusions in all age groups younger than 55 years were 
projected to follow a constant or even negative trend up to 2060.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that increasing use of posterior spinal fusion, 
particularly in patients 75 years and older, will challenge healthcare systems 
worldwide if current trends persist. This study may serve as a model for many 
other industrialized countries facing similar demographic and procedure-specific 
developments in the future. This emphasizes the need to focus on frailty 
research as well as appropriate financial and human resource management. 
Effective perioperative medical management, multidisciplinary treatment, and 
interinstitutional protocols are warranted, especially in older patients as we 
attempt to manage these trends in the future.

PURPOSE: The prevalence of pressure injury (PI) in hospitalized patients ranges 
from 5 to 15%, and is significantly greater in critical care and palliative care 
units. Prevalence of PI is considered an indicator of health care quality and is 
associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The study aims to determine 
the features of PI and its association with mortality among hospitalized 
patients in the inpatient service of a university hospital.
METHODS: The present study comprised 89 patients hospitalized on the internal 
medicine inpatient service who had PI at the time of hospitalization and or who 
developed PI during hospitalization. Patients were categorized based on the 
state of PI closure (complete/incomplete). Mortality rates for 1 month, 
3 months, 6 months, and 1 year were computed.
RESULTS: The median age was 74. (IQR: 62-82). Forty-eight patients were female, 
and 15.7% of hospitalized patients had PI. A third of patients died during their 
index hospitalization. Patients with completely closed PI had decreased 
one-month, three-month, six-month, and one-year mortality rates. Complete 
closure of PI influenced all four mortality rates independently of other 
parameters, as determined by Cox regression analysis of the factors impacting 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: As life expectancy rises, the frequency of PI increases, resulting 
in a rise in health care expenses. To reduce these expenses, prevention, early 
identification, and treatment of PI are essential. The primary finding of the 
study is that complete closure of PI in hospitalized patients reduces the risk 
of death.

In today's world, the key variable for measuring population health is life 
expectancy (LE). The purpose of this research is to find out how life expectancy 
is related to other factors and develop a model to account for the predictors 
that contribute to LE. This study is also conducted to investigate and measure 
the effect of socioeconomic variables on LE in Bangladesh. In this study, the 
predictor variables are employment rate, gross national income (GNI), population 
growth rate, unemployment rate, and age dependency ratio. Path analysis 
disintegrated bivariate analysis and showed that employment rate, GNI, and age 
dependency ratio are significantly related to life expectancy, although 
bivariate analysis showed all variables are significantly related to LE. The 
maximum values of significant factors, GNI and employment rates, are $1930 and 
21.32% happened in 2019, which is positively correlated with life expectancy. 
Also, the maximum value of the age dependency ratio (81.52%) happened in 1991, 
whereas the maximum value of the dependent variable LE (72.59 years) happened in 
2019. It has been observed that LE, GNI, and employment rates all rise with one 
another. There exists an adverse relationship between LE and age dependency 
ratio. Based on comparisons with other highly developed nations, Bangladesh's 
GNI needs to grow faster than other significant factors to boost life 
expectancy. We have forecasted variables that were significantly related to LE 
until 2030 for the purpose of sustainable development goals, especially the 3rd 
goal.

AIMS: We seek to understand the coexisting effects of population aging and a 
rising burden of diabetes on healthy longevity in South Africa.
METHODS: We used longitudinal data from the 2015 and 2018 waves of the "Health 
and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH Community in South 
Africa" (HAALSI) study to explore life expectancy (LE) and disability-free life 
expectancy (DFLE) of adults aged 45 and older with and without diabetes in rural 
South Africa. We estimated LE and DFLE by diabetes status using Markov-based 
microsimulation.
RESULTS: We find a clear gradient in remaining LE and DFLE based on diabetes 
status. At age 45, a man without diabetes could expect to live 7.4 [95% CI 3.4 - 
11.7] more years than a man with diabetes, and a woman without diabetes could 
expect to live 3.9 [95% CI: 0.8 - 6.9] more years than a woman with diabetes. 
Individuals with diabetes lived proportionately more years subject to disability 
than individuals without diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: We find large and important decrements in disability-free aging for 
people with diabetes in South Africa. This finding should motivate efforts to 
strengthen prevention and treatment efforts for diabetes and its complications 
for older adults in this setting.
