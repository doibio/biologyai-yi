METHODS: Functional vision was assessed in a semicontrolled setup using 
unfiltered (normal camera) and distance-filtered (stereo camera) imagery. All 
tasks were forced choice designs and an extension of signal detection theory to 
latent (unobservable) variables was used to analyze the data, allowing 
estimation of person ability (person measures) and task difficulty (item 
measures) on the same axis.
RESULTS: All subjects performed better with the distance filter compared with 
the unfiltered image (P  < 0.001 on all tasks except localization).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that depth filtering using a disparity-based 
algorithm has significant benefits for people with Argus II implants.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The improvement in functional vision with the distance 
filter found in this study may have an important impact on vision rehabilitation 
and quality of life for people with visual prostheses and ultra low vision.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the changes in motor function and health-related quality 
of life after pancreatectomy and identify factors influencing postoperative 
physical functioning in health-related quality of life.
METHODS: This single-centre, prospective, observational study measured 6-min 
walking distance, grip strength, knee extension strength and health-related 
quality of life variables in patients with pancreatic cancer, before and after 
surgery. Paired t- and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare pre- and 
postoperative motor function and health-related quality-of-life variables. 
Factors associated with postoperative physical functioning scores of 
health-related quality of life were assessed using multiple regression analysis.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine individuals were enrolled. Motor function values decreased 
significantly postoperatively, including 6-min walking distance (mean ± standard 
deviation: 402.5 ± 95.4 vs. 497.7 ± 80.4 m, p < 0.001), knee extensor strength 
(0.42 ± 0.10 vs. 0.47 ± 0.10 kgf/kg, p < 0.001) and grip strength (22.0 ± 8.9 
vs. 24.5 ± 9.2 kg, p = 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed significant 
association between 6-min walking distance change and postoperative physical 
functioning scores of health-related quality of life (p = 0.036).
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that motor function decreases postoperatively, 
and a decrease in 6-min walking distance after surgery is associated with 
postoperative physical functioning in patients with pancreatic cancer.

The low expression rate of exogenous genes in cyanobacteria is one of the 
bottlenecks of cyanobacteria genetic engineering. The T7 RNA polymerase 
expression system has achieved the efficient expression of exogenous genes in 
Escherichia coli. Cyanobacteria and E. coli are both Gram-negative bacteria with 
high genetic homology. The construction of T7 RNA polymerase expression system 
in cyanobacteria may improve the expression of foreign genes. In order to 
construct the T7 RNA polymerase expression system in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, 
methods such as overlapping extension PCR and digestion-ligation technique were 
used to construct a site-specific integration vector pEASY-T1-F1-TacT7RNAPCmR-F2 
and a shuttle expression vector pRL-T7-hG-CSF. The site-specific integration 
vector is capable of expressing T7 RNA polymerase, and the shuttle expression 
vector expresses hG-CSF driven by the T7 promoter. Then we introduced the 
site-specific integration vector into the wild type cyanobacteria by 
electroporation and transferred the shuttle expression vector into the 
site-integrated transgenic cyanobacteria by triparental conjugative transfer. In 
the end, we identified the presence of foreign genes in cyanobacteria by PCR, 
tested the transcription level of foreign genes in cyanobacteria by RT-PCR, and 
detected the protein expression of foreign genes in cyanobacteria by Western 
blotting. The two vectors were successfully constructed, the T7 RNA polymerase 
gene and hG-CSF gene were transferred into cyanobacteria well, and both genes 
were also expressed in cyanobacteria. In summary, the T7 RNA polymerase 
expression system was successfully constructed in cyanobacteria, and the 
expression rate of hG-CSF gene was doubled than the traditional cyanobacteria 
expression systems. This expression system will provide a better tool for the 
application of cyanobacteria genetic engineering and will promote the 
development of cyanobacteria as a chassis cell in the fields of synthetic 
biology in the future.

LESSONS LEARNED: SCB01A is a novel microtubule inhibitor with vascular 
disrupting activity. This first-in-human study demonstrated SCB01A safety, 
pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity. SCB01A is safe and well 
tolerated in patients with advanced solid malignancies with manageable 
neurotoxicity.
BACKGROUND: SCB01A, a novel microtubule inhibitor, has vascular disrupting 
activity.
METHODS: In this phase I dose-escalation and extension study, patients with 
advanced solid tumors were administered intravenous SCB01A infusions for 3 hours 
once every 21 days. Rapid titration and a 3 + 3 design escalated the dose from 2 
mg/m2 to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). 
SCB01A-induced cellular neurotoxicity was evaluated in dorsal root ganglion 
cells. The primary endpoint was MTD. Safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and tumor 
response were secondary endpoints.
RESULTS: Treatment-related adverse events included anemia, nausea, vomiting, 
fatigue, fever, and peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy. DLTs included grade 4 
elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in the 4 mg/m2 cohort; grade 3 gastric 
hemorrhage in the 6.5 mg/m2 cohort; grade 2 thromboembolic event in the 24 mg/m2 
cohort; and grade 3 peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, grade 3 elevated 
aspartate aminotransferase, and grade 3 hypertension in the 32 mg/m2 cohort. The 
MTD was 24 mg/m2 , and average half-life was ~2.5 hours. The area under the 
curve-dose response relationship was linear. Nineteen subjects were stable after 
two cycles. The longest treatment lasted 24 cycles. SCB01A-induced neurotoxicity 
was reversible in vitro.
CONCLUSION: The MTD of SCB01A was 24 mg/m2 every 21 days; it is safe and 
tolerable in patients with solid tumors.

Covid-19 has demonstrated again that epidemics can affect minorities more than 
the population in general. We consider one of the last major epidemics in the 
United States: HIV/AIDS from ca. 1980-2000. We calculate life expectancy and 
lifespan disparity (a measure of variance in age at death) for thirty US states, 
finding noticeable differences both between states and between the black and 
white communities. Lifespan disparity allows us to examine distributional 
effects, and, using decomposition methods, we find that for six states lifespan 
disparity for blacks increased between 1980 and 1990, while life expectancy 
increased less than for whites. We find that we can attribute most of this to 
the impact of HIV/AIDS.

INTRODUCTION: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a common, 
life-threatening event encountered routinely by first responders, including 
police, fire and emergency medical services (EMS). Current literature suggests 
that there is significant regional variation in outcomes, some of which may be 
related to modifiable factors. Yet, there is a persistent knowledge gap 
regarding strategies to guide quality improvement efforts in OHCA care and, by 
extension, survival. The Enhancing Prehospital Outcomes for Cardiac Arrest 
(EPOC) study aims to fill these gaps and to improve outcomes.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This mixed-methods study includes three aims. In aim I, we 
will define variation in OHCA survival to the emergency department (ED) among 
EMS agencies that participate in the Michigan Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance 
Survival (CARES) in order to sample EMS agencies with high-survival and 
low-survival outcomes. In aim II, we will conduct site visits to emergency 
medical systems-including 911/dispatch, police, non-transport fire, and EMS 
agencies-in approximately eight high-survival and low-survival communities 
identified in aim I. At each site, key informant interviews and a 
multidisciplinary focus group will identify themes associated with high OHCA 
survival. Transcripts will be coded using a structured codebook and analysed 
through thematic analysis. Results from aims I and II will inform the 
development of a survey instrument in aim III that will be administered to all 
EMS agencies in Michigan. This survey will test the generalisability of factors 
associated with increased OHCA survival in the qualitative work to ultimately 
build an EPOC Toolkit which will be distributed to a broad range of stakeholders 
as a practical 'how-to' guide to improve outcomes.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The EPOC study was deemed exempt by the University of 
Michigan Institutional Review Board. Findings will be compiled in an 'EPOC 
Toolkit' and disseminated in the USA through partnerships including, but not 
limited to, policymakers, EMS leadership and health departments.

Population viability in a host-parasitoid system is mediated by interactions 
between population stage structure and life stage differential susceptibility to 
toxicants.

The effects of toxicants, such as pesticides, may be more severe for some life 
stages of an organism than others. However, in most toxicity studies, data is 
developed for only one life stage, which may lead to misleading interpretations. 
Furthermore, population stage-structure may interact with differential 
susceptibility, especially when populations consist of higher proportions of 
individuals in more susceptible stages at the time of toxicant exposure. We 
explore the interaction of differential stage susceptibility and stage 
distribution using a stage-structured Lefkovitch matrix model. We incorporate 
lab-derived toxicity data for a common parasitoid, the braconid Diaeretiella 
rapae (M'Intosh), a common natural enemy of the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne 
brassicae L.), exposed to the pesticide imidacloprid. We compare population 
outcomes of simulations in which we vary both the population stage structure 
along with the susceptibility of each stage to toxicants. Our results illustrate 
an interaction between differential susceptibility and initial stage 
distribution, highlighting the fact that both of these demographic features 
should be considered in interpreting toxicity data and the development of 
ecological risk assessments.

Closely related phytophagous insects that specialize on different host plants 
may have divergent responses to environmental factors. Rhagoletis pomonella 
(Walsh) and Rhagoletis zephyria Snow (Diptera: Tephritidae) are sibling, 
sympatric fly species found in western North America that attack and mate on 
plants of Rosaceae (~60 taxa) and Caprifoliaceae (three taxa), respectively, 
likely contributing to partial reproductive isolation. Rhagoletis zephyria 
evolved from R. pomonella and is native to western North America, whereas R. 
pomonella was introduced there. Given that key features of the flies' ecology, 
breeding compatibility, and evolution differ, we predicted that adult eclosion 
patterns of the two flies from Washington State, USA are also distinct. When 
puparia were chilled, eclosion of apple- and black hawthorn-origin R. pomonella 
was significantly more dispersed, with less pronounced peaks, than of 
snowberry-origin R. zephyria within sympatric and nonsympatric site comparisons. 
Percentages of chilled puparia that produced adults were ≥67% for both species. 
However, when puparia were not chilled, from 13.5 to 21.9% of apple-origin R. 
pomonella versus only 1.2% to 1.9% of R. zephyria eclosed. The distinct 
differences in eclosion traits of R. pomonella and R. zephyria could be due to 
greater genetic variation in R. pomonella, associated with its use of a wider 
range of host plants than R. zephyria.

Plastic pollution and the numerous consequences it has on aquatic life have 
become a huge concern in recent years. While many studies have been conducted in 
marine environments, studies in freshwater ecosystems are scarce and 
insufficient. The Paraná River is the most important water course in the La 
Plata River basin and the fifth in the world with a mean annual discharge of 
18,000 m3 per second. Currently available studies show the presence of plastic 
in river shores and fish gut, but more research should be carried out in order 
to know the extension and origin of plastic contamination. Therefore, the aim of 
this study was to quantify and characterize macro-, meso-, and microplastics 
found in the riverine beaches next to Rosario city, the most populated city 
standing by the lower Paraná River coast in Argentina. The results show that 
plastic pollution is ubiquitous, but the city shores are significantly more 
polluted than the wetland shore with a mean of 30,780 and 6375 microplastics per 
square meter respectively (p = 0.024). The food and beverage industry packaging 
combined were the most frequent macroplastics found. Also, 3 out of 4 meso- and 
microplastics were white/transparent, the color that is most likely to be 
ingested by fish and invertebrates. Finally, all micro- and mesoplastics found 
were secondary and, in the case of microplastics, they were mainly fibers 
(93.4%) which highlight its ecological relevance. As a whole, plastic 
contamination is a serious issue in the Rosario area, specially single-use 
plastics and short-lived products. The anthropic effect of the cities and how it 
contributes to plastic pollution are evident.

We present the hypothesis that advanced stage cancer is also a heart failure 
syndrome. It can develop independently of or in addition to cardiotoxic effects 
of anti-cancer therapies. This includes an increased risk of ventricular 
arrhythmias. We suggest the pathophysiologic link for these developments 
includes generalized muscle wasting (i.e. sarcopenia) due to tissue homeostasis 
changes leading to cardiac wasting associated cardiomyopathy. Cardiac wasting 
with thinning of the ventricular wall increases ventricular wall stress, even in 
the absence of ventricular dilatation. In addition, arrhythmias may be 
facilitated by cellular wasting processes affecting structure and function of 
electrical cells and conduction pathways. We submit that in some patients with 
advanced cancer (but not terminal cancer), heart failure therapy or 
defibrillators may be relevant treatment options. The key points in selecting 
patients for such therapies may be the predicted life expectancy, quality of 
life at intervention time, symptomatic burden, and consequences for further 
anti-cancer therapies. The cause of death in advanced cancer is difficult to 
ascertain and consensus on event definitions in cancer is not established yet. 
Clinical investigations on this are called for. Broader ethical considerations 
must be taken into account when aiming to target cardiovascular problems in 
cancer patients. We suggest that focused attention to evaluating cardiac wasting 
and arrhythmias in cancer will herald a further evolution in the rapidly 
expanding field of cardio-oncology.

During central nervous system (CNS) development, proper and timely induction of 
neurite elongation is critical for generating functional, mature neurons, and 
neuronal networks. Despite the wealth of information on the action of 
extracellular cues, little is known about the intrinsic gene regulatory factors 
that control this developmental decision. Here, we report the identification of 
Prox1, a homeobox transcription factor, as a key player in inhibiting neurite 
elongation. Although Prox1 promotes acquisition of early neuronal identity and 
is expressed in nascent post-mitotic neurons, it is heavily down-regulated in 
the majority of terminally differentiated neurons, indicating a regulatory role 
in delaying neurite outgrowth in newly formed neurons. Consistently, we show 
that Prox1 is sufficient to inhibit neurite extension in mouse and human 
neuroblastoma cell lines. More importantly, Prox1 overexpression suppresses 
neurite elongation in primary neuronal cultures as well as in the developing 
mouse brain, while Prox1 knock-down promotes neurite outgrowth. Mechanistically, 
RNA-Seq analysis reveals that Prox1 affects critical pathways for neuronal 
maturation and neurite extension. Interestingly, Prox1 strongly inhibits many 
components of Ca2+ signaling pathway, an important mediator of neurite extension 
and neuronal maturation. In accordance, Prox1 represses Ca2+ entry upon 
KCl-mediated depolarization and reduces CREB phosphorylation. These observations 
suggest that Prox1 acts as a potent suppressor of neurite outgrowth by 
inhibiting Ca2+ signaling pathway. This action may provide the appropriate time 
window for nascent neurons to find the correct position in the CNS prior to 
initiation of neurites and axon elongation.

OBJECTIVES: The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) has been long debated, but 
alternative estimation approaches have not been comprehensively evaluated. Our 
objective was to identify alternatives, characterize them by implementation 
feasibility, and evaluate the impact of implementing feasible options in 
cost-effectiveness models developed for the Institute for Clinical and Economic 
Review reports.
METHODS: We conducted a literature review combining keywords relating to QALYs, 
methodology alternatives, and cost-effectiveness in PubMed, EconLit, Web of 
Science, and MEDLINE. Articles that discussed alternatives to the conventional 
QALY were included. Alternatives were characterized by type, data availability, 
calculation burden, and overall implementation feasibility. The subset of 
feasible alternatives, that is, sufficient data and methodology compatible with 
incorporation into common modeling approaches, were evaluated according to 
impact on incremental QALYs, incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB), 
intervention rankings, and proportion of interventions with a positive iNMB.
RESULTS: We identified 28 articles discussing 9 alternatives. Feasible 
alternatives were using patient preference (PP) data; equity weighting according 
to baseline utility, fair innings, or proportional QALY shortfall; and the equal 
value of life-years-gained approach. All alternatives affected the incremental 
QALY and iNMB outcomes, rankings, and proportion of interventions with a 
positive iNMB. The PP alternative had the largest and most consistent impact. 
The PP impact on the proportion of interventions with a positive iNMB, was in 
the negative direction.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first comprehensive evaluation of proposed 
alternatives to the conventional QALY. We found robust literature but few 
options that were feasible to be implemented in current healthcare 
decision-making processes.

OBJECTIVES: Reexamine cost-effectiveness of riluzole in the treatment of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in light of recent advances in disease 
staging and understanding of stage-specific drug effect.
METHODS: ALS was staged according to the "fine'til 9" (FT9) staging method. 
Stage-specific health utilities (EQ-5D, US valuation) were estimated from an 
institutional cohort, whereas literature informed costs and transition 
probabilities. Costs at 2018 prices were disaggregated into recurring costs 
(RCs) and "one-off" transition/"tollgate" costs (TCs). Five- and 10-year 
horizons starting in stage 1 disease were examined from healthcare sector and 
societal perspectives using Markov models to evaluate riluzole use, at a 
threshold of $100 000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Probabilistic and 
deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Mean EQ-5D utilities for stages 0 to 4 were 0.79, 0.74, 0.63, 0.54, and 
0.46, respectively. From the healthcare sector perspective at the 5-year 
horizon, riluzole use contributed to 0.182 QALY gained at the cost difference of 
$12 348 ($5403 riluzole cost, $8870 RC and -$1925 TC differences), translating 
to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $67 658/QALY. Transition 
probability variation contributed considerably to ICER uncertainty (-30.2% 
to +90.0%). ICER was sensitive to drug price and RCs, whereas higher TCs 
modestly reduced ICER due to delayed tollgates.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a framework for health economic studies of ALS 
treatments using FT9 staging. Prospective stage-specific and disaggregated cost 
measurement is warranted for accurate future cost-effectiveness analyses. 
Appropriate separation of TCs from RCs substantially mitigates the high burden 
of background cost of care on the ICER.

OBJECTIVES: Testing and treatment for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) infection are highly effective, high-impact interventions. This 
article aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of scaling up these 
interventions by scenarios, regions, and income groups.
METHODS: We modeled costs and impacts of hepatitis elimination in 67 low- and 
middle-income countries from 2016 to 2030. Costs included testing and treatment 
commodities, healthcare consultations, and future savings from cirrhosis and 
hepatocellular carcinomas averted. We modeled disease progression to estimate 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. We estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) by regions and World Bank income groups, 
according to 3 scenarios: flatline (status quo), progress (testing/treatment 
according to World Health Organization guidelines), and ambitious (elimination).
RESULTS: Compared with no action, current levels of testing and treatment had an 
ICER of $807/DALY for HBV and -$62/DALY (cost-saving) for HCV. Scaling up to 
progress scenario, both interventions had ICERs less than the average gross 
domestic product/capita of countries (HBV: $532/DALY; HCV: $613/DALY). Scaling 
up from flatline to elimination led to higher ICERs across countries (HBV: 
$927/DALY; HCV: $2528/DALY, respectively) that remained lower than the average 
gross domestic product/capita. Sensitivity analysis indicated discount rates and 
commodity costs were main factors driving results.
CONCLUSIONS: Scaling up testing and treatment for HBV and HCV infection as per 
World Health Organization guidelines is a cost-effective intervention. 
Elimination leads to a much larger impact though ICERs are higher. Price 
reduction strategies are needed to achieve elimination given the substantial 
budget impact at current commodity prices.

OBJECTIVES: The study had two main aims. First, we assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of transplanting deceased donor kidneys of differing quality 
levels based on the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI). Second, we assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of remaining on the waiting list until a high-quality kidney 
becomes available compared to transplanting a lower-quality kidney.
METHODS: A decision analytic model to estimate cost-effectiveness was developed 
using a Markov process. Separate models were developed for 4 separate KDPI 
bands, with higher values indicating lower quality. Models were simulated in 
1-year cycles for a 20-year time horizon, with transitions through distinct 
health states relevant to the kidney recipient from the healthcare payer's 
perspective. Weibull regression was used to calculate the time-dependent 
transition probabilities in the base analysis. The impact uncertainty arising in 
model parameters was included by probabilistic sensitivity analysis using the 
Monte Carlo simulation method. Willingness to pay was considered as Australian 
$28 000.
RESULTS: Transplanting a kidney of any quality is cost-effective compared to 
remaining on a waitlist. Transplanting a lower KDPI kidney is cost-effective 
compared to a higher KDPI kidney. Transplanting lower KDPI kidneys to younger 
patients and higher KDPI kidneys to older patients is also cost-effective. 
Depending on dialysis in hopes of receiving a lower KDPI kidney is not a 
cost-effective strategy for any age group.
CONCLUSION: Efforts should be made by the health systems to reduce the discard 
rates of low-quality kidneys with the view of increasing the transplant rates.

The question as to whether the clinical benefits of video-assisted thoracoscopic 
esophagectomy (VATE) do outweigh its increased costs remains unanswered. Here, 
we analyzed the cost-effectiveness of VATE versus open esophagectomy (OE) in a 
real-world setting. Using 2008-2015 Taiwanese Health Insurance claim data, we 
identified 3271 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent transthoracic 
esophagectomy. By taking into account nine confounding variables, we constructed 
a 1:1 propensity score-matched sample of patients who underwent VATE or OE 
(n = 629 each). Direct costs incurred within three years after surgery and 
survival were analyzed. There were no significant intergroup differences in 
terms of R0 resection rates, length of stay, as well as 30- and 90-day mortality 
and unplanned readmission rates. However, the number of dissected nodes was 
higher in the VATE group (median: 24 vs. 18, P < 0.001). While VATE had higher 
index hospitalization costs (median, 12331 USD vs. 10730 USD, P < 0.001), cost 
differences were reduced over time. The average accumulated cost person-month of 
VATE declined below that of OE at 14 months after hospital discharge. Overall 
survival (OS) figures were more favorable for patients treated with VATE (3-year 
OS: 47% vs. 41%; life expectancy: 4.04 life-years [LY] vs. 3.30 LY). The 
cost-effectiveness plane showed that only 0.3% of all VATE procedures were more 
costly and less effective than OE. The probabilities for VATE to be 
cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of 10000 and 50000 
USD/LY were 63.5% and 92.4%, respectively. Using commonly accepted WTP 
thresholds, VATE was more cost-effective than OE for patients with esophageal 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Smoking and obesity are 2 modifiable risk factors for disability. We 
examine the impact of smoking and obesity on disability-free life expectancy 
(DFLE) at older ages, using 2 levels of disability.
METHOD: We used the DYNOPTA dataset, derived by harmonizing and pooling risk 
factors and disability outcomes from 5 Australian longitudinal aging studies. We 
defined mobility disability as inability to walk 1 km, and more severe 
(activities of daily living [ADL]) disability by the inability to dress or 
bathe. Mortality data for the analytic sample (N = 20 401; 81.2% women) were 
obtained from Government Records via data linkage. We estimated sex-specific 
total life expectancy, DFLE, and years spent with disability by Interpolated 
Markov Chain (IMaCh) software for each combination of smoking (never vs ever), 
obesity (body mass index ≥30 vs 18.5 to <30), and education (left school age 14 
or younger vs age 15 or older).
RESULTS: Compared to those without either risk factor, high educated nonobese 
smokers at age 65 lived shorter lives (men and women: 2.5 years) and fewer years 
free of mobility disability (men: 2.1 years; women: 2.0 years), with similar 
results for ADL disability. Obesity had the largest effect on mobility 
disability in women; high educated obese nonsmoking women lived 1.3 years less 
than nonsmoking, not obese women but had 5.1 years fewer free of mobility 
disability and 3.2 fewer free of ADL disability. Differences between risk factor 
groups were similar for the low educated.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest eliminating obesity would lead to an absolute 
reduction of disability, particularly in women.

Chitin was isolated from Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) shell by 
demineralization and deproteinization using 1 M HCl (1:20, w/v) for 2 hr and 1 M 
NaOH (1:30 w/v) for 80 min at 70ºC, respectively, with 29.96% optimum yield. 
Thereafter, the chitin was deacetylated at various temperatures for different 
times, in which the chitosan prepared at 130ºC for 4 hr (CS-130-4) showed higher 
yield (73.11%), crystallinity index (19.75%), and 85.28% degree of deacetylation 
(DDA) as measured by 1 H-NMR. CS-130-4 was then conjugated to epigallocatechin 
gallate (EGCG) at various concentrations (2-8%, w/w of chitosan). CS-130-4 was 
grafted with 8% EGCG (CE-8) had the higher conjugation efficiency (92.63%) and 
antimicrobial/antioxidant activities as compared to other conjugates (p < .05). 
1 H-NMR analysis also confirmed the successful conjugation of CE-8. All the 
conjugates were completely water soluble. Therefore, CE-8 may be used as the 
natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agents in various food products. PRACTICAL 
APPLICATIONS: Shrimp shells are generally considered as processing by-products 
of the shellfish industries and can cause environmental pollution when 
improperly disposed. Chitosan from shrimp shells has been widely produced but it 
is soluble mainly in acidic solutions, which limits its applications. However, 
grafting of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) onto chitosan yielded water-soluble 
conjugates with enhanced antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Although 
several preservatives have been applied in foods, their health hazards have been 
a major concern. To mitigate this limitation, chitosan-EGCG conjugates could be 
employed as alternative natural preservatives or additives for shelf-life 
extension of various foods.

Specialized proresolving mediators in infection and lung injury.

Sandhaus S(1), Swick AG(1).

Author information:
(1)Life Extension Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA.

Specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) are endogenous lipid metabolites of 
long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that are involved in promoting the 
resolution of inflammation. Many disease conditions characterized by excessive 
inflammation have impaired or altered SPM biosynthesis, which may lead to 
chronic, unresolved inflammation. Exogenous administration of SPMs in infectious 
conditions has been shown to be effective at improving infection clearance and 
survival in preclinical models. SPMs have also shown tremendous promise in the 
context of inflammatory lung conditions, such as acute respiratory distress 
syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mostly in preclinical 
settings. To date, SPMs have not been studied in the context of the novel 
Coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), 
however their preclinical efficacy in combatting infections and improving acute 
respiratory distress suggest they may be a valuable resource in the fight 
against Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Overall, while the research on SPMs 
is still evolving, they may offer a novel therapeutic option for inflammatory 
conditions.

With an over 80 million population, Iran is the second-largest country in the 
Middle East. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread over all 31 
provinces of Iran, leading to the most cases and death among the Eastern 
Mediterranean countries. At the same time, Iran is under the United States 
political and economic sanctions that compromised Iran's health system. Although 
medicines and basic medical equipment exempted from the economic sanctions, 
direct and indirect effects of sanctions have restricted Iran's banking system, 
and consequently has led to a wide range of limitation on trade, manufacturing 
sector, insurance and ventures. All these circumstances have meant that Iran is 
restricted to provide the essential basic medical equipment for diagnosis, 
treatment and prevention of the COVID-19. Although sanctions are not the sole 
reason for this high rate of mortality and morbidity in a short time period, the 
chronic and long-term effects of sanctions may be more tangible than their acute 
impact. In conclusion, providing health services is one of the major problems of 
Iran's health system during this pandemic that potentially influence on 
morbidity and mortality of the COVID-19. Iran needs to be free from sanctions 
for battling against this crisis.Key messagesIran is one of the countries that 
significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.Iran is under political and 
economic sanctions that consequently influence on their health system during the 
COVID-19 crisis.The chronic and long-term effects of sanctions may be more 
tangible than their acute impact.

OBJECTIVE: Slowed processing speed and executive dysfunction are associated with 
poor outcomes in Late Life Depression (LLD), though it is unclear why. We 
investigated whether these variables interfere with the development of positive 
treatment expectancies in an antidepressant trial.
METHODS: Depressed older subjects were randomized to Open (intended to increase 
patient expectancy) or Placebo-controlled (termed 'Hidden,' intended to decrease 
expectancy) administration of antidepressant medication for 8 weeks. Analysis of 
covariance analyzed the between-group difference on expectancy (Credibility and 
Expectancy Scale [CES]) and depression (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 
[HRSD], Clinical Global Impressions [CGI] Severity). Moderator analyses examined 
whether these Open versus Hidden differences varied based on higher versus lower 
processing speed and executive function.
RESULTS: Among the 108 participants, a significant between-group difference was 
observed on expectancy (effect size [ES, Cohen's d] = 0.51 on CES Item 2; 
ES = 0.64 on Item 4), indicating the manipulation was effective. Processing 
speed as measured by the Stroop Color-Word Test (number color-words named in 
congruent condition) was a significant moderator of the Open versus Hidden 
effect on expectancy. Depressive symptom improvement was greater on average for 
Open versus Hidden participants who received active drug (CGI-severity 
ES = 1.25, HRSD ES = 0.41), but no neurocognitive moderators of the 
between-group difference reached statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: Slowed processing speed impairs the development of expectancies in 
antidepressant trials for LLD, which may help explain lower antidepressant 
response among older adults. Future studies may address whether interventions to 
optimize treatment expectancies are capable of improving treatment outcomes.
