Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second more common neurodegenerative disease 
with increasing incidence worldwide associated to the population ageing. Despite 
increasing awareness and significant research advancements, treatment options 
comprise dopamine repleting, symptomatic therapies that have significantly 
increased quality of life and life expectancy, but no therapies that halt or 
reverse disease progression, which remain a great, unmet goal in PD research. 
Large biomarker development programs are undertaken to identify disease 
signatures that will improve patient selection and outcome measures in clinical 
trials. In this review, we summarize PD-related mechanisms that can serve as 
targets of therapeutic interventions aiming to slow or modify disease 
progression, as well as previous and ongoing clinical trials in each field, and 
discuss future perspectives.

BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) serves as a direct measure of 
individuals' health, life expectancy and the impact that the utilization of 
health care has on quality of life. The purpose of this study is to assess the 
HRQoL of people living with HIV (PLHIV), and to ascertain its association with 
the social inequalities and clinical determinants among people living with HIV 
in Benishangul Gumuz Regional State, Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2016 and 
February 2017; 390 people at two referral hospitals and three health centers 
participated in the study. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
System Global Health Scale (PROMIS Global 10) was used to measure key HRQoL 
domains. Global Physical Health (GPH) and Global Mental Health (GPH) summary 
scores were employed. GPH and GMH summary scores below 50 (the standardized mean 
score) were determined as poor HRQoL. Bivariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with GPH and GMH 
summary scores.
RESULTS: This study included 259 (66.4%) females and 131 (33.6%) males. The GPH 
summary scores ranged from 16.2 to 67.7 with a mean of 48.8 (SD = 8.9). Almost 
44.6% of the study population has a GPH summary score of below 50; the GMH 
summary scores ranged from 28.4 to 67.6 with a mean of 50.8 (SD = 8.1). About 
41.8% of the study population has a GMH summary score of below 50. Unemployment, 
household food insecurity and comorbidities with HIV were associated with both 
poor GPH and poor GMH summary scores. Age below 25 years and being a member of 
Christian fellowship were inversely associated with poor GPH. The least wealth 
index score and CD4 count below 350 cells/mL were also associated with poor GMH.
CONCLUSION: Overall, socioeconomic inequalities and HIV-related clinical factors 
play an important role in improving the HRQoL of PLHIV. Many of these 
determinants are alterable risk factors. Appropriate strategies can improve the 
holistic management of chronic HIV care and maximize PLHIVs' HRQoL. Such 
strategies require the adoption of comprehensive interventions, including 
policies and programmes that would improve the health, wellbeing and livelihood 
of PLHIV.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of nurse-led stroke aftercare 
addressing psychosocial outcome at 6 months post stroke, compared with 
care-as-usual.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation within a comparative effectiveness research design.
SETTING: Primary care (2016-2017) and community settings (2011-2013) in the 
Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: Persons who suffered from ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, or a 
transient ischaemic attack and were discharged home after visiting the emergency 
department, hospitalisation or inpatient rehabilitation.
INTERVENTIONS: Nurse-led stroke aftercare at 6 months post stroke addressing 
psychosocial functioning by providing screening, psycho-education, emotional 
support and referral to specialist care when needed. Care-as-usual concerned 
routine follow-up care including secondary prevention programmes and a 
consultation with the neurologist at 6 weeks post stroke.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measure of 
cost-effectiveness was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated by the 
quality of life measured by the five-dimensional, three-level EuroQol. Costs 
were assessed using a cost-questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were mood (Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale) and social participation (Utrecht Scale for 
Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation) restrictions subscale.
RESULTS: Health outcomes were significantly better in stroke aftercare for QALYs 
(Δ=0.05; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.09) and social participation (Δ=4.91; 95% CI 1.89 to 
7.93) compared with care-as-usual. Total societal costs were €1208 higher in 
stroke aftercare than in care-as-usual (95% CI -€3881 to €6057). Healthcare 
costs were in total €1208 higher in stroke aftercare than in care-as-usual 
(95% CI -€3881 to €6057). Average costs of stroke aftercare were €91 (SD=€3.20) 
per person. Base case cost-effectiveness analyses showed an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of €24 679 per QALY gained. Probability of stroke 
aftercare being cost-effective was 64% on a €50 000 willingness-to-pay level.
CONCLUSIONS: Nurse-led stroke aftercare addressing psychosocial functioning 
showed to be a low-cost intervention and is likely to be a cost-effective 
addition to care-as-usual. It plays an important role by screening and 
addressing psychosocial problem, not covered by usual care.

Many competing criteria are under consideration for prioritizing COVID-19 
vaccination. Two criteria based on age are demographic: lives saved and years of 
future life saved. Vaccinating the very old against COVID-19 saves the most 
lives, but, since older age is accompanied by falling life expectancy, it is 
widely supposed that these two goals are in conflict. We show this to be 
mistaken. The age patterns of COVID-19 mortality are such that vaccinating the 
oldest first saves the most lives and, surprisingly, also maximizes years of 
remaining life expectancy. We demonstrate this relationship empirically in the 
United States, Germany, and South Korea and with mathematical analysis of life 
tables. Our age-risk results, under usual conditions, also apply to health 
risks.

Migraines are a common form of primary headache, affecting women more than men 
(17.4% and 5.7% of US population, respectively, a total of 12%) that carry 
significant morbidity and disability, as well as a hefty healthcare price tag. 
They are most prevalent in women of reproductive ages and are estimated to be 
the 6th disease in order of causing global burden. They are estimated to cause 
45.1 million years lived with disability, or 2.9% of global years lost to 
disability. Migraine treatment divides into acute, abortive treatment for relief 
of an ongoing migraine attack, and prophylactic therapy to reduce the occurrence 
of migraines, specifically for patients suffering from chronic and frequent 
episodic migraines. Traditional abortive treatment usually begins with NSAID and 
non-specific analgesics that are effective in curbing mild to moderate attacks. 
5HT1-agonists, such as triptans, are often used for second-line and for severe 
attacks. Triptans are generally better tolerated in the longterm than NSAIDs and 
other analgesics, though they carry a significant side-effect profile and are 
contraindicated in large parts of the population. Prophylactic therapy is 
usually reserved for patients with frequent recurrence owing to medication side 
effects and overall poor adherence to the medication schedule. Importantly, 
medication overuse may actually lead to the development of chronic migraines 
from previously episodic attacks. Recent research has shed more light on the 
pathophysiology of migraine and the role of CGRP in the trigeminovascular 
system. Recent pharmacological advances were made in developing more specific 
drugs based on this knowledge, including CGRP neutralizing antibodies, receptor 
antagonists, and the development of ditans. These novel drugs are highly 
specific to peripheral and central 5-HT1F receptors and effective in the 
treatment of acute migraine attacks. Binding these receptors reduces the 
production of CGRP and Glutamate, two important ligands in the nociceptive 
stimulus involved with the generation and propagation of migraines. Several 
large clinical studies showed Lasmiditan to be effective in the treatment of 
acute migraine attacks. Importantly, due to its receptor specificity, it lacks 
the vasoconstriction that is associated with triptans and is thus safer is 
larger parts of the population, specifically in patients with cardiac and 
vascular disease. Though more research is required, specifically with 
aftermarket surveillance to elucidate rare potential side effects, Lasmiditan is 
a targeted anti-migraine drug that is both safe and effective, and carries an 
overall superior therapeutic profile to its predecessors. It joins the array of 
medications that target CGRP signaling, such as gepants and CGRP-antibodies, to 
establish a new line of care for this common disabling condition.

Background: The aim of this study is to evaluate the pharmacoeconomic profile of 
adding enzalutamide to first-line treatment for metastatic, hormone-sensitive 
prostate cancer (mHSPC) from the US and Chinese payers' perspectives. Materials 
and Methods: A Markov model with three health states: progression-free survival 
(PFS), progressive disease (PD), and death, was constructed. All patients were 
assumed to enter the model in the PFS state and transit according to the 
transition structure. Efficacy data were derived from the ENZAMET trial and 
Weibull distribution curves were modeled to fit the survival curves. Costs in 
the model included cost of drugs, best-supportive care (BSC), follow-up, tests, 
and adverse events (AEs)-related treatments. The primary endpoint of the study 
was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). In addition, the impact of 
several key parameters on the results of the cost-effectiveness analysis was 
tested with one-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. 
Results: Overall, ICERs were $430,933.95/QALY and $225,444.74/QALY of addition 
of enzalutamide to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) vs. ADT from the US and 
Chinese payers' perspective, respectively. The most influential factors were the 
utility for the PFS state and the cost of enzalutamide. At the 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $100,000.00/QALY in the US and 
$28,988.40/QALY in China, the probability of adding enzalutamide to first-line 
treatment being a cost-effective option for mHSPC was 0%. Conclusions: Based on 
the data from the ENZAMET trial and the current price of enzalutamide, adding 
enzalutamide to first-line treatment is not cost-effective for patients with 
mHSPC from the US and Chinse payers' perspectives.

BACKGROUND: The health and wellbeing of Autistic people are well below those of 
their non-Autistic counterparts. With studies showing a reduced life expectancy 
and poor physical and mental health, it is important that healthcare 
professionals strive towards improving the lives of Autistic people by 
recognising those who are undiagnosed and/or misdiagnosed and providing 
meaningful support.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to empower general practitioners (GPs) to 
feel comfortable in recognising potentially undiagnosed Autistic adults. The 
authors aim to further the understanding of the Autistic experience, including 
frequently co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, and to give GPs 
some tools to make the experience of accessing healthcare less problematic for 
Autistic people.
DISCUSSION: The healthcare experiences of Autistic adults will be greatly 
improved with a knowledgeable, understanding and accepting GP as the cornerstone 
of their care.

AIMS: The objective of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
KTE-X19 versus standard of care (SoC) in the treatment of relapsed/refractory 
(R/R) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients from a US healthcare perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A three-state partitioned-survival model 
(pre-progression, post-progression, and death) with a cycle length of 1 month 
was used to extrapolate progression-free and overall survival (OS) over a 
lifetime horizon. Due to the long tail of the OS curve, OS was modeled applying 
a mixture-cure methodology, using the assumption that patients whose disease had 
not progressed after 5 years experienced long-term remission. Population inputs 
were derived from the ZUMA-2 trial. This was also the source of KTE-X19 efficacy 
and safety data, while this data was obtained from the literature for SoC. Costs 
and resource use inputs were derived from the published literature and publicly 
available data sources. Health state utilities were derived from the ZUMA-2 
trial (NCT02601313), applying the US tariff. Adverse event disutilities were 
derived from the published literature. Costs and health outcomes were discounted 
at 3% per year. The model estimated expected life years (LY), quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY), and total costs for KTE-X19 vs SoC. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Median survival was 9.71 years for KTE-X19 and 2.13 for SoC. Discounted 
LYs, QALYs, and lifetime costs were 8.99, 7.39, and $693,832 for KTE-X19 vs 
4.47, 3.65, and $574,263 for SoC, respectively. The KTE-X19 vs SoC cost per QALY 
was $31,985. The most influential model parameter was the utility for patients 
with long-term remission. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per 
QALY, the probability that KTE-X19 was cost-effective was 99%.
CONCLUSION: The treatment of R/R MCL with KTE-X19 presents a potentially 
cost-effective alternative to the current SoC, deriving its value from 
incremental survival and health-related quality-of-life benefits.

Aim: To assess the cost-effectiveness of first-line treatment with dacomitinib 
compared with gefitinib in patients newly diagnosed with advanced NSCLC 
EGFR-positive in the context of Spain. Materials & methods: A partitioned 
survival model was developed including costs, utilities and disutilities to 
estimate quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio when treating with dacomitinib versus gefitinib. Results: Dacomitinib 
presented higher QALYs (0.51) compared with gefitinib (0.45). Dacomitinib costs 
were €33,061 in comparison with €26,692 for gefitinib arm. An incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of €111,048 was obtained for dacomitinib. Conclusion: 
Dacomitinib was more effective in terms of QALYs gained than gefitinib. However, 
to obtain a cost-effectiveness alternative, a discount greater than 25% in 
dacomitinib acquisition cost is required.

BACKGROUND: A new prolonged-release formulation of potassium citrate and 
potassium bicarbonate, ADV7103, has been shown to improve metabolic control, 
palatability, and gastrointestinal safety in patients with distal renal tubular 
acidosis (dRTA) when compared to standard of care (SoC) treatments. The present 
work evaluates safety and efficacy of ADV7103 during 24 months.
METHODS: Thirty pediatric and adult patients were included in an open-label 
extension study after a phase II/III trial. Safety and tolerability were 
assessed. Plasma bicarbonate and potassium levels, as well as urine parameters, 
were evaluated over time. Acceptability, adherence, and quality of life were 
also assessed. The evolution of clinical consequences of dRTA in the cohort was 
explored.
RESULTS: There were 104 adverse events (AEs) reported, but only 9 
gastrointestinal events observed in five patients (17%) were considered to be 
related to ADV7103 treatment. There were no AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation. Plasma bicarbonate and potassium levels were in the normal 
ranges at the different visits, respectively, in 69-86% and 83-93% of patients. 
Overall adherence rates were ≥ 75% throughout the whole study in 79% patients. 
An average improvement of quality of life of 89% was reported at 24 months of 
study.
CONCLUSIONS: Common AEs concerned metabolism and gastrointestinal disorders; the 
former being related to the disease. Less than half of the gastrointestinal AEs 
were related to ADV7103 treatment and they were mostly mild in severity. 
Metabolic parameters were maintained in the normal ranges in most patients. 
Patient satisfaction was high and adherence to treatment was good and remained 
stable.

Although the life expectancy of women is over 80 years in many countries, oral 
sensation has scarcely been compared between adults ≥ 80 years and younger age 
groups. The purpose of this study was to clarify age-related changes in oral 
sensation throughout adulthood. After exclusion of individuals with factors that 
might have confounded somatosensory performance, 123 female participants were 
divided into four age groups: 20-39 years, 40-59 years, 60-79 years, and 
80-96 years. Perceptions of tactile and thermal sensations were examined at 
points on the anterior and posterior palate, anterior and posterior tongue, 
lower labial-attached gingiva, lower lip, and buccal mucosa; two-point 
discrimination was examined only on the tongue. The tactile and two-point 
discrimination thresholds for the anterior and posterior tongue were 
significantly higher in the 80-96-year-old group than in any other age group 
(p < 0.05). The tactile threshold for the buccal mucosa was significantly higher 
in the 80-96-year-old group than in the 60-79-year-old group (p < 0.05). The 
percentage of participants able to perceive a warm stimulus (50 °C) in the 
buccal mucosa was significantly lower in the 80-96-year-old group than in the 
20-39-year-old group (p < 0.05). Only the topography of the warm sensation 
perception changed with age. This cross-sectional study suggests that oral 
tactile and thermal sensation for warm stimuli deteriorates with age in a 
site-specific manner, especially after the age of 80 years, but the same does 
not occur with cool stimuli.

Biochemical properties and flexibility of nitrogenous bases allow DNA to fold 
into higher-order structures. Among different DNA secondary structure, 
G-quadruplexes (tetrapelexes-G4) - which are formed in guanine rich sequences - 
have gained more attention because of their biological significance, therapeutic 
intervention, and application in molecular device and biosensor. G4-quadruplex 
studies categorize into three main fields, in vivo, in vitro, and in silico. The 
in vitro field includes G4 synthetic oligonucleotides. This review focuses on 
the G-quadruplex synthetic aptamers structure features and considers the 
applicability of G4-aptamers for cancer biomarkers detection. Various biosensing 
methods will be reviewed based on G-quadruplex aptamers for cancer detection.

Edible coatings have potential to decrease the postharvest losses of several 
horticultural commodities however; there is no systematic investigation focusing 
on fresh herbaceous aromatic plants such as basil. Herein, the effects of 
chitosan (CS), chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) and thyme volatile oil (TVO) 
loaded CSNPs (TVO-CSNPs) as edible coatings on preserving the quality of sweet 
basil leaves were investigated. All CS coatings considerably extended the shelf 
life and decreased the weight loss of basil leaves relative to the control. 
Using TVO-CSNPs showed 2.4-fold higher shelf life than the control. The loss in 
photosynthetic pigments and volatile oil content were significantly retarded by 
CS applications more so with TVO-CSNPs treatment. Contrary, treated leaves 
produced lower malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 and therefore retained the 
membrane functions compared to the control. All CS applications particularly 
with TVO-CSNPs considerably motivated the activities of catalase (CAT) and 
superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes and reduced the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and 
lipoxyganase (LOX) activities relative to uncoated leaves. Overall, using 
TVO-CSNPs as an edible coating has a great potential in shelf life extension of 
basil leaves with satisfactory exterior and interior quality. Thus, it can be a 
promising approach to preserve the quality of fresh cut aromatic herbs.

Tinnitus is the perception of a phantom sound and the patient's reaction to it. 
Although much progress has been made, tinnitus remains a scientific and clinical 
enigma of high prevalence and high economic burden, with an estimated prevalence 
of 10%-20% among the adult population. The EU is funding a new collaborative 
project entitled "Unification of Treatments and Interventions for Tinnitus 
Patients" (UNITI, grant no. 848261) under its Horizon 2020 framework. The main 
goal of the UNITI project is to set the ground for a predictive computational 
model based on existing and longitudinal data attempting to address the question 
of which treatment or combination of treatments is optimal for a specific 
patient group based on certain parameters. Clinical, epidemiological, genetic 
and audiological data, including signals reflecting ear-brain communication, as 
well as patients' medical history, will be analyzed making use of existing 
databases. Predictive factors for different patient groups will be extracted and 
their prognostic relevance validated through a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) 
in which different patient groups will undergo a combination of tinnitus 
therapies targeting both auditory and central nervous systems. From a scientific 
point of view, the UNITI project can be summarized into the following research 
goals: (1) Analysis of existing data: Results of existing clinical studies will 
be analyzed to identify subgroups of patients with specific treatment responses 
and to identify systematic differences between the patient groups at the 
participating clinical centers. (2) Genetic and blood biomarker analysis: High 
throughput Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) will be performed in well-characterized 
chronic tinnitus cases, together with Proximity Extension Assays (PEA) for the 
identification of blood biomarkers for tinnitus. (3) RCT: A total of 500 
patients will be recruited at five clinical centers across Europe comparing 
single treatments against combinational treatments. The four main treatments are 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), hearing aids, sound stimulation, and 
structured counseling. The consortium will also make use of e/m-health 
applications for the treatment and assessment of tinnitus. (4) Decision Support 
System: An innovative Decision Support System will be implemented, integrating 
all available parameters (epidemiological, clinical, audiometry, genetics, 
socioeconomic and medical history) to suggest specific examinations and the 
optimal intervention strategy based on the collected data. (5) Financial 
estimation analysis: A cost-effectiveness analysis for the respective 
interventions will be calculated to investigate the economic effects of the 
interventions based on quality-adjusted life years. In this paper, we will 
present the UNITI project, the scientific questions that it aims to address, the 
research consortium, and the organizational structure.

Seoul, Seoul, South Korea yoonsj02@korea.ac.kr.

OBJECTIVES: In 2018, South Korea's suicide mortality rate was 26.59 deaths per 
100 000 people; this figure is 2.2 times higher than that of the year 2000, 
during which 12.22 deaths per 100 000 people were ascribed to suicide. This 
study aims to observe the trend of disease burden in years of life lost (YLL) 
due to suicide from 2000 to 2018 in South Korea and investigate the related 
sociodemographic risk factors.
DESIGN: This quantitative research used secondary data-including claim data, 
cause of death statistics, life tables and census data-from national health 
insurance corporation and Statistics Korea. Based on the methodology of Korean 
National Burden of Disease study, this study used an incidence-based approach to 
measure YLL.
RESULTS: The total YLL due to suicide during the last two decades was 4 298 886 
years; the average YLL per death was 18.65 years. The YLL rate per 100 000 
people was 482 (male: 664, female: 300) in 2018, 1.7 times higher than the 387 
(male 387, female 183) in 2000. Low education levels and non-marital status were 
shown to be related to the increase in YLL rate.
CONCLUSION: These results show the increasing disease burden of suicide in South 
Korea and suggest the necessity of more in-depth research to analyse correlation 
and causation with sociodemographic risk factors.

The purpose of the in silico study was to compare free breathing volumetric 
modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to standard deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) 
three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and determine whether the 
former is a viable option for elderly patients with left-sided early stage 
breast cancer. Data from 22 patients with early-stage left breast carcinoma 
requiring breast-only radiation therapy were used for this planning study. The 
robustness of VMAT plans when using the free breathing method was compared to 
that of standard 3DCRT plans using the DIBH method. The endpoints for evaluation 
were the target dose coverage as well as doses to the organs-at-risk. The free 
breathing VMAT plans produced a significantly higher mean dose to the heart and 
right breast than the DIBH-3DCRT plans. Free breathing VMAT plans resulted in 
significantly better target coverage than did 3DCRT using DIBH. The external 
volume that received more than 40 Gy was significantly smaller in the VMAT 
plans. Free breathing VMAT is a viable alternative to DIBH 3DCRT in elderly 
patients with a limited life expectancy and in subjects who are unable to 
perform DIBH. The choice of treatment should be individualized, and all relevant 
risks ought to be considered.

A meta-analysis to investigate the difference in fracture risk between 
individuals with and without HIV infection was performed. People living with HIV 
had lower bone mineral density (BMD) and greater risks of overall fractures and 
fragility fractures. Reducing fragility and maintaining skeletal strength for 
PLWH are urgently needed for this population.
PURPOSE: The introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy increased the life 
expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH). This population now faces problems 
related to aging such as decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased 
fracture risk. Some antiretroviral therapies may also negatively impact bone 
health. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the difference in the 
fracture risk between individuals with and without HIV infection.
METHODS: We compared BMD, risk of fragility fracture, and risk of all fracture 
between the two groups. This study included 35 articles with 106,994 PLWH and 
228,794,335 controls.
RESULTS: PLWH had lower lumbar spine and hip BMD than controls. PLWH had a 
higher prevalence of all fracture events (4.08% versus 0.44%) and fragility 
fractures (2.66% versus 2.19%). The relative risks of all and fragility 
fractures of PLWH were 1.91 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.46-2.49; p < 0.001) 
and 1.68 (95% CI: 1.40-2.01; p < 0.001). PLWH also had more vertebral fractures 
(1.26% versus 0.37%; RR, 1.97; 95% CI: 1.22-3.2; p < 0.05), hip fractures (1.38% 
versus 0.81%; RR, 1.88; 95% CI: 0.99-3.57; p = 0.05), and wrist fractures (1.38% 
versus 1.29%; RR, 1.67; 95% CI: 1.13-2.45; p < 0.05) than healthy controls. The 
pooled incidence of fractures was 1.72 per 100 person-years in PLWH and 1.29 in 
healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: PLWH had lower BMD and greater risks of all fractures and fragility 
fractures. Reducing fragility and maintaining skeletal strength for PLWH are 
urgently needed for this population.
