The present study was conducted to evaluate the lipid and protein oxidation 
responses of cold stored turkey meat using chitosan-contained nanoemulsions 
supplemented with the essential oils of two aromatic plants including Zataria 
multiflora Boiss and Bunium persicum Boiss. Chemical traits such as total 
volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric reactive 
substances (TBARs), free fatty acids (FFA), fatty acid composition and TC (total 
carbonyl) of samples were carried out at 4°C. Moreover, their pH and sensory 
properties were also determined at the same conditions. The initial value of the 
TVB-N (2.24 mg N/100 g) reached 20.81 mg N/100 g. TVB-N values achieved for all 
meat samples were lower than the highest acceptable limit (28-29 mg N/100 g). In 
all the treatments, PV and TBARs values were increased until day 10, and 
afterward a decrease was observed until day 20 of storage. TBARs values of the 
samples (mg MDA/kg) ranged from 1.97 ± 0.04 to 4.48 ± 0.39 in CNE + ZEO 1% to 
2.72 ± 0.32 to 6.66 ± 0.21 in CON at zero time and day 5, respectively. FFA and 
TC were enhanced at a slower rate in the treated samples. The most efficient 
treatment against chemical deterioration was found to be CNE + ZEO 1%. Chitosan 
and sonicated chitosan treatments had the highest color score and lowest odor 
score at zero time. The obtained results suggested coating turkey meat fillets 
with ZEO and BEO as an effective strategy to delay at their chemical 
deterioration. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The spoilage risk of fresh products is 
higher than other foods. Turkey meat spoils because of biological reactions such 
as the oxidation of lipids and protein, the action of endogenous enzymes, and 
the metabolic activities of microorganisms that end in a short shelf life. The 
oxidation of lipids not only reduces or retards, but also inhibits by edible 
coatings. Edible coatings formed from bioactive compounds would effectively 
provide possibility of active compounds onto surface of minimally processed 
foods. Therefore, application chitosan-loaded nanoemulsion coating containing 
Zataria multiflora Boiss and Bunium persicum Boiss essential oils is recommended 
in food industry especially for poultry industry to increase the chemistry and 
sensory quality of turkey breast fillets.

AbstractIntroduction: Usage of automated insulin delivery systems is increasing 
for the treatment of people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). This study compared 
long-term cost-effectiveness of the Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop MiniMed 780G 
(AHCL) system versus sensor augmented pump (SAP) system with predictive low 
glucose management (PLGM) or multiple daily injections (MDI) plus intermittently 
scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) in people with T1D in Greece. 
Methods: Analyses were performed using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model, with 
clinical input data sourced from various studies. In the AHCL versus SAP plus 
PLGM analysis, patients were assumed to have 7.5% baseline glycated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c), when comparing AHCL with MDI plus isCGM baseline HbA1c was assumed to 
be 7.8%. HbA1c was reduced to 7.0% following AHCL treatment initiation but 
remained at baseline levels in the comparator arms. Analyses were performed from 
a societal perspective over a lifetime time horizon. Future costs and clinical 
outcomes were discounted at 1.5% per annum. Results: AHCL was associated with 
increased quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.284 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and EUR 10,173 lower mean total lifetime costs with SAP plus PLGM. 
Compared with MDI plus isCGM, AHCL was associated with increased 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 2.708 QALYs, EUR 76,396 higher mean total 
lifetime costs, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 29,869 per 
QALY. Extensive sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of results. 
Conclusions: Over patient lifetime, the MiniMed 780G system is likely to be cost 
saving compared with the SAP plus PLGM system and cost-effective compared with 
MDI plus isCGM in people with T1D in Greece.

We analyze risk factors correlated with the initial transmission growth rate of 
the recent COVID-19 pandemic in different countries. The number of cases follows 
in its early stages an almost exponential expansion; we chose as a starting 
point in each country the first day di with 30 cases and we fitted for 12 days, 
capturing thus the early exponential growth. We looked then for linear 
correlations of the exponents α with other variables, for a sample of 126 
countries. We find a positive correlation, i.e. faster spread of COVID-19, with 
high confidence level with the following variables, with respective p-value: low 
Temperature (4 ⋅ 10-7), high ratio of old vs. working-age people (3 ⋅ 10-6), 
life expectancy (8 ⋅ 10-6), number of international tourists (1 ⋅ 10-5), earlier 
epidemic starting date di (2 ⋅ 10-5), high level of physical contact in greeting 
habits (6 ⋅ 10-5), lung cancer prevalence (6 ⋅ 10-5), obesity in males 
(1 ⋅ 10-4), share of population in urban areas (2 ⋅ 10-4), cancer prevalence 
(3 ⋅ 10-4), alcohol consumption (0.0019), daily smoking prevalence (0.0036), and 
UV index (0.004, 73 countries). We also find a correlation with low Vitamin D 
serum levels (0.002 - 0.006), but on a smaller sample,  ∼ 50 countries, to be 
confirmed on a larger sample. There is highly significant correlation also with 
blood types: positive correlation with types RH- (3 ⋅ 10-5) and A+ (3 ⋅ 10-3), 
negative correlation with B+ (2 ⋅ 10-4). We also find positive correlation with 
moderate confidence level (p-value of 0.02 ∼ 0.03) with: CO2/SO emissions, 
type-1 diabetes in children, low vaccination coverage for Tuberculosis (BCG). 
Several of the above variables are correlated with each other, and so they are 
likely to have common interpretations. We thus performed a Principal Component 
Analysis, to find the significant independent linear combinations of such 
variables. The variables with loadings of at least 0.3 on the significant PCA 
are: greeting habits, urbanization, epidemic starting date, number of 
international tourists, temperature, lung cancer, smoking, and obesity in males. 
We also analyzed the possible existence of a bias: countries with low GDP-per 
capita might have less intense testing, and we discuss correlation with the 
above variables.

Obesity has been associated with increased incidence of comorbidities and 
shorter life expectancy, and it has generally been assumed that patients with 
obesity should have inferior outcomes after surgery. Previous literature has 
often demonstrated equivalent or even improved rates of mortality after cardiac 
surgery when compared to their lower-weight counterparts, coined the obesity 
paradox. Herein, we aim to review the literature investigating the impact of 
obesity on surgical valve interventions. PubMed and Embase were systematically 
searched for articles published from 1 January 2000 to 15 October 2021. A total 
of 1315 articles comparing differences in outcomes between patients of varying 
body mass index (BMI) undergoing valve interventions were reviewed and 25 were 
included in this study. Patients with higher BMI demonstrated equivalent or 
reduced rates of postoperative myocardial infarction, stroke, reoperation rates, 
acute kidney injury, dialysis and bleeding. Two studies identified increased 
rates of deep sternal wound infection in patients with higher BMI, although the 
majority of studies found no significant difference in deep sternal wound 
infection rates. The obesity paradox has described counterintuitive outcomes 
predominantly in coronary artery bypass grafting and transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement. Recent literature has identified similar trends in other heart 
valve interventions. While the obesity paradox has been well characterized, its 
causes are yet to be identified. Further study is essential in order to identify 
the causes of the obesity paradox so patients of all body sizes can receive 
optimal care.

This document is a focused update to the 2017 colorectal cancer (CRC) screening 
recommendations from the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, 
which represents the American College of Gastroenterology, the American 
Gastroenterological Association, and the American Society for Gastrointestinal 
Endoscopy. This update is restricted to addressing the age to start and stop CRC 
screening in average-risk individuals and the recommended screening modalities. 
Although there is no literature demonstrating that CRC screening in individuals 
under age 50 improves health outcomes such as CRC incidence or CRC-related 
mortality, sufficient data support the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force to suggest 
average-risk CRC screening begin at age 45. This recommendation is based on the 
increasing disease burden among individuals under age 50, emerging data that the 
prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasia in individuals ages 45 to 49 
approaches rates in individuals 50 to 59, and modeling studies that demonstrate 
the benefits of screening outweigh the potential harms and costs. For 
individuals ages 76 to 85, the decision to start or continue screening should be 
individualized and based on prior screening history, life expectancy, CRC risk, 
and personal preference. Screening is not recommended after age 85.

Dendrite growth and low Coulombic efficiency caused by uneven diffusion and 
electrodeposition of Zn2+ ions have emerged as a barrier to exploit the Zn metal 
anode. In this work, we demonstrate the stoichiometric halogenated MXenes 
(Ti3C2Cl2, Ti3C2Br2, and Ti3C2I2) as an artificial layer that can induce the 
uniform Zn deposition. The efficient redistribution effect results from the 
coherent heterogeneous interface reconstruction and regulated ion tiling by 
halogen surficial termination. The synergetic effects of high lattice matching 
(90%) between the adopted MXenes and Zn, as well as the positive halogen 
regulation, Zn2+ ions are guided to nucleate uniformly on the most extensive 
(000l) crystal plane of the MXene matrix and grow in a planar manner. In terms 
of Zn ion regulation, Cl termination is found to be more effective than O/F, Br, 
and I due to its moderate adsorption and diffusion coefficiency for Zn2+ ions. 
The Ti3C2Cl2-Zn anode achieves a life extension of over 12 times (840 h at 2 mA 
cm-2//1 mAh cm-2) over that of the bare Zn anode and serves more than 9000 
cycles in a battery with a Ti3C2I2 cathode at a high rate of 3 A g-1. Given the 
abundance of lattice parameters and terminations of MXene materials, the 
developed strategy is expected to be extended to other metal anode systems.

Cystic fibrosis is a multi-systemic disease of impaired sodium and chloride 
transport across epithelial surfaces. Cystic fibrosis is one of the most common 
autosomal recessive diseases among Caucasian children. However, recent 
epidemiologic studies suggest that the disease in Hispanic, African American, 
and Asian American populations may be more common than previously recognized. 
The phenotypic expression is characterized by the constellation of pulmonary, 
pancreatic, hepatobiliary, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Progressive 
obstructive lung disease is the hallmark of cystic fibrosis, and end-stage 
respiratory failure is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. The most 
significant advance in the care has been the development of cystic fibrosis 
modulators, a class of drugs that restore cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator folding, intracellular processing, or function. Improved 
diagnostic abilities, a multidisciplinary approach to medical management, and 
the use of cystic fibrosis modulators have led to improvement in the quality of 
life and life expectancy. These patients undergo range of procedures such as 
nasal polypectomy, placement of gastrostomy tubes, vascular access device 
placement, transbronchial lung biopsies, and other thoracic surgeries. The 
anesthetic care of children with advanced cystic fibrosis disease is complex. 
Preoperative optimization can help improve postoperative outcomes. Strategies 
for pain control should rely on non-opiate, multimodal adjuncts, and regional or 
neuraxial techniques. Unfortunately for some children, a progressive respiratory 
disease often leads to end-stage respiratory failure and lung transplant surgery 
remains the only viable treatment option. Widespread use of lung transplant 
surgery as a treatment option is severely constraint by donor organ 
availability. Primary graft dysfunction is the most common cause of early death 
and can be seen within 48 h of surgery. Median long-term survival after lung 
transplant remains modest. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction, opportunistic 
infections, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder are the most common 
causes of morbidity and mortality among long-term survivors.

Socio-demographic development and burden of mental, substance use disorders, and 
self-harm: An ecological analysis using the Global Burden of Disease study 2019.

OBJECTIVES: Whether a country's level of development is associated with an 
increased or decreased burden of mental and behavioural problems is an important 
yet unresolved question. Here, we examined the association between the burden of 
mental and substance use disorders and self-harm with socio-demographic 
development along temporal and geographical dimensions.
METHODS: We collected data from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019, which 
uses robust statistical modelling techniques to calculate disease burden 
estimates where data are sparse or unavailable. We extracted age-standardized 
Disability Adjusted Life Year rates as a measure of disease burden for 204 
countries and territories, as well as the Socio-Demographic Index, a measure of 
development reflecting income per capita, fertility rate and level of education. 
We tested the association between Socio-Demographic Index and Disability 
Adjusted Life Years for mental and substance use disorders and self-harm, 
between 1990 and 2019, and across six geographical regions as defined by the 
World Health Organization.
RESULTS: The association between Socio-Demographic Index and Disability Adjusted 
Life Years was heterogeneous across world regions for all mental and behavioural 
conditions. For substance use disorders and self-harm, these regional variations 
were further moderated by time period. Our findings were robust to down-weighing 
outlier observations, as well as controlling for other socio-demographic 
variables, and the number of data sources available in each country.
CONCLUSION: Based on data from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019, we 
demonstrated that the association between mental and substance use disorders and 
self-harm with socio-demographic development is dependent on geographical 
regions and temporal periods. This heterogeneity is likely related to 
geographical and temporal variations in socio-cultural norms, attitudes towards 
mental problems, as well as health care and social policies. Better knowledge of 
this spatial and temporal heterogeneity is crucial to ensure that countries do 
not develop at the expense of a higher burden of mental and behavioural 
conditions.

Body Composition Impacts Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Outcomes in Both 
Autologous and Allogeneic Transplants: A Systematic Review.

Price S(1), Kim Y(1).

Author information:

USA.

According to World Health Organization, over 50,000 hematopoietic stem cell 
transplants (HSCTs) are performed annually worldwide. Though HSCT can extend 
life-expectancy and improve disease-related health burdens, it is not without 
risks. Post-transplant overall survival is improving; therefore, it is 
imperative that factors contributing to or impeding further improvements are 
well understood. The purpose of this systematic review is to explore current 
data on body composition (specifically weight loss, BMI, obesity and sarcopenia) 
and the relation to HSCT outcomes. A literature search was conducted via PubMed 
and Web of Science databases. Key words included "body composition," 
"sarcopenia," "hematopoietic stem cell transplant," "malnutrition," "body mass 
index," and "obesity." Results indicated that 16 out of 18 analyzed studies 
found a statistically significant relationship between body composition, in 
particular higher BMI and weight loss, and at least one survival-related outcome 
variable (eg., non-relapse mortality, overall survival and/or relapse). Based on 
the findings of this review, body composition, whether evaluated before or 
during HSCT, can impact a wide variety of post-transplant outcomes. This speaks 
to the importance of evaluating patients pre-transplant, identifying potential 
risk factors for worsened outcomes, and providing immediate interventions in 
order to optimize transplant outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer (EC) is the sixth leading cause of tumor-related 
deaths worldwide. Estimates of the EC burden are necessary and could offer 
evidence-based suggestions for local cancer control.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to predict the disease burden of EC in 
China through the estimation of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 
direct medical expenditure by sex from 2013 to 2030.
METHODS: A dynamic cohort Markov model was developed to simulate EC prevalence, 
DALYs, and direct medical expenditure by sex. Input data were collected from the 
China Statistical Yearbooks, Statistical Report of China Children's Development, 
World Population Prospects 2019, and published papers. The JoinPoint Regression 
Program was used to calculate the average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 
DALY rates, whereas the average annual growth rate (AAGR) was applied to analyze 
the changing direct medical expenditure trend over time.
RESULTS: From 2013 to 2030, the predicted EC prevalence is projected to increase 
from 61.0 to 64.5 per 100,000 people, with annual EC cases increasing by 11.5% 
(from 835,600 to 931,800). The DALYs will increase by 21.3% (from 30,034,000 to 
36,444,000), and the years of life lost (YLL) will account for over 90% of the 
DALYs. The DALY rates per 100,000 people will increase from 219.2 to 252.3; 
however, there was a difference between sexes, with an increase from 302.9 to 
384.3 in males and a decline from 131.2 to 115.9 in females. The AAPC was 0.8% 
(95% CI 0.8% to 0.9%), 1.4% (95% CI 1.3% to 1.5%), and -0.7% (95% CI -0.8% to 
-0.7%) for both sexes, males, and females, respectively. The direct medical 
expenditure will increase by 128.7% (from US $33.4 to US $76.4 billion), with an 
AAGR of 5.0%. The direct medical expenditure is 2-3 times higher in males than 
in females.
CONCLUSIONS: EC still causes severe disease and economic burdens. YLL are 
responsible for the majority of DALYs, which highlights an urgent need to 
establish a beneficial policy to reduce the EC burden.

BACKGROUND: When healthcare budgets are exogenous, cost-effectiveness thresholds 
(CETs) used to inform funding decisions should represent the health opportunity 
cost (HOC) of such funding decisions, but HOC-based CET estimates have not been 
available until recently. In recent years, empirical HOC-based CETs for multiple 
countries have been published, but the use of these CETs in the 
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) literature has not been investigated. Analysis 
of the use of HOC-based CETs by researchers undertaking CEAs in countries with 
different decision-making contexts will provide valuable insights to further 
understand barriers and facilitators to the acceptance and use of HOC-based 
CETs.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify the CET values used to interpret the results of 
CEAs published in the scientific literature before and after the publication of 
jurisdiction-specific empirical HOC-based CETs in four countries.
METHODS: We undertook a scoping review of CEAs published in Spain, Australia, 
the Netherlands and South Africa between 2016 (2014 in Spain) and 2020. CETs 
used before and after publication of HOC estimates were recorded. We conducted 
logit regressions exploring factors explaining the use of HOC values in 
identified studies and linear models exploring the association of the reported 
CET value with study characteristics and results.
RESULTS: 1171 studies were included in this review (870 CEAs and 301 study 
protocols). HOC values were cited in 28% of CEAs in Spain and in 11% of studies 
conducted in Australia, but they were not referred to in CEAs undertaken in the 
Netherlands and South Africa. Regression analyses on Spanish and Australian 
studies indicate that more recent studies, studies without a conflict of 
interest and studies estimating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
below the HOC value were more likely to use the HOC as a threshold reference. In 
addition, we found a small but significant impact indicating that for every 
dollar increase in the estimated ICER, the reported CET increased by US$0.015. 
Based on the findings of our review, we discuss the potential factors that might 
explain the lack of adoption of HOC-based CETs in the empirical CEA literature.
CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of HOC-based CETs by identified published CEAs has 
been uneven across the four analysed countries, most likely due to underlying 
differences in their decision-making processes. Our results also reinforce a 
previous finding indicating that CETs might be endogenously selected to fit 
authors' conclusions.

OBJECTIVE: As governments grapple with ageing populations, there is a need to 
understand more about the aged care workforce and how it is managed.
METHODS: We undertook a scoping review according to the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Scopus and PubMed were used to identify papers 
published between 2010 and 2020. We mapped the breadth and scale of the evidence 
base according to the QuInnE indicators of job quality.
RESULTS: Out of 642 titles and abstracts that were screened, 122 were selected. 
Outcomes were measured across a range of domains, including wages, employment 
quality, education and training, working conditions, work/life balance and 
consultative participation and collective representation. These were distributed 
unevenly, revealing evidence gaps.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified significant knowledge gaps regarding Australia's aged 
care workforce at a time when the sector is coming under fresh scrutiny and 
projections indicate that it will face critical labour shortfalls going forward.

BACKGROUND: Despite government legislations for protection of women, domestic 
violence (DV) continues to remain as a public health problem in India. 
Objectives 1. To find out the prevalence of various types of self-reported DV 
among married women of 18-45 years of age and to identify its social 
determinants and their help-seeking behavior. 2. To understand the solutions 
from key informants' point of view.
METHODS: It was a sequential explanatory mixed methods study design, which 
consisted of quantitative (Survey) followed by qualitative (Interviews) phase. A 
representative sample of 360 married women was chosen by two-stage cluster 
sampling from villages in Tamil Nadu, South India. The female investigator 
conducted the survey by house to house visit. Post-survey, six key informant 
interviews were conducted to explore the solutions and suggestions from experts' 
point of view. Bivariate and multivariate regression analysis was carried out to 
identify the significant predictors of DV. Manual content analysis of 
qualitative data was done.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of spousal DV was 49.5% [95% CI: 44.3-54.6] in 
the last one year. In multivariate analysis, two factors namely 'current 
alcoholism in husband' and 'controlling behavior of husband' were found to be 
the significant predictors of DV. In order to prevent alcoholism in husband, the 
key informants suggested deaddiction services and measures to limit access to 
alcohol. Furthermore, to prevent controlling behavior of husband, the key 
informants suggested women's empowerment, employment, helplines, responsible 
parenting, social change in dowry practice and gender equality.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of spousal DV was found to be high. Current alcohol 
consumption and controlling behavior of the husband were the important 
determinants of domestic violence. Key informants suggested interprofessional 
approach consisting of deaddiction services, women empowerment and strengthening 
of family life to address the problem of DV.

The Mediating Influence of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of 
Technology on the Relationship Between Internal Health Locus of Control and 
Mobile Health Adoption: Cross-sectional Study.

BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) as an innovative form of information and 
communications technology can efficiently deliver high-quality health care by 
enhancing communication and health management, reducing costs, and increasing 
access to health services. An individual's internal health locus of control 
(HLOC) is found to be associated with the behavioral intent to adopt mHealth. 
However, little is known about the underlying mechanism of this association.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to test the mediation 
influence of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) on 
the relationship between internal HLOC and the behavioral intention to use 
mHealth.
METHODS: A total of 374 responses were collected from Malaysian adult users of 
mHealth, using convenience and snowball sampling methods. Partial least squares 
structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Data were collected 
for variables, including demographics, internal HLOC, and modified UTAUT 
constructs (ie, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social 
influence).
RESULTS: The results showed that there was no direct relationship between 
internal HLOC and the behavioral intention to use mHealth (β=-0.039, P=.32). The 
indirect relationship between internal HLOC and the intent to adopt mHealth was 
supported, indicating that the UTAUT constructs performance expectancy (β=0.104, 
P<.001), effort expectancy (β=0.056, P=.02), and social influence (β=0.057, 
P=.002) mediated this relationship. The results showed full mediation, with 
total variance explained at 47.2%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study developed an integrative model, where a health-related 
disposition (internal HLOC), mHealth-related beliefs (performance expectancy and 
effort expectancy), and normative pressure (social influence) were combined to 
explain the underlying mechanism of the behavioral intent to adopt mHealth. The 
results showed that the intention to adopt mHealth is mediated by the influence 
of UTAUT factors, while HLOC has no direct effect on adoption intention. The 
findings provide insights into augmenting mHealth adoption among the public by 
enhancing the perceived benefits of mHealth, helping design more effective and 
user-friendly mHealth tools, and capitalizing on social normative influence to 
adopt mHealth. This study utilized the constructs of the UTAUT model to 
determine the intention to use mHealth. Future research should focus on other 
health- and technology-related theories to ascertain other possible factors 
influencing the behavioral intent of mHealth adoption.

The ever-debated question of triage and allocating the life-saving ventilator 
during the COVID-19 pandemic has been repeatedly raised and challenged within 
the ethical community after shortages propelled doctors before life and death 
decisions (Anderson-Shaw and Zar 2020; Huxtable 2020; Jongepier 2020; Peterson, 
Largent, and Karlawish 2020). The British Medical Association's ethical guidance 
highlighted the possibility of an initial surge of patients that would outstrip 
the health system's ability to deliver care "to existing standards," where 
utilitarian measures have to be applied, and triage decisions need to maximize 
"overall benefit" (British Medical Association 2020, 3) In these emergency 
circumstances, triage that "grades according to their needs and the probable 
outcomes of intervention" will prioritize or eliminate patients for treatment, 
and health professionals may be faced with obligations to withhold or withdraw 
treatments to some patients in favour of others (British Medical Association 
2020, 4). This piece is a response and extension to articles published on the 
manner of involvement for ethics and ethicists in pandemic triage decisions, 
particularly examining the ability and necessity of establishing triage 
committees to ameliorate scarce allocation decisions for physicians.

BACKGROUND: Chikungunya and dengue are emerging diseases that have caused large 
outbreaks in various regions of the world. Both are both spread by Aedes aegypti 
and Aedes albopictus mosquitos. We developed a dynamic transmission model of 
chikungunya and dengue, calibrated to data from Colombia (June 2014 -December 
2017).
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated the health benefits and 
cost-effectiveness of residual insecticide treatment, long-lasting 
insecticide-treated nets, routine dengue vaccination for children aged 9, 
catchup vaccination for individuals aged 10-19 or 10-29, and portfolios of these 
interventions. Model calibration resulted in 300 realistic transmission 
parameters sets that produced close matches to disease-specific incidence and 
deaths. Insecticide was the preferred intervention and was cost-effective. 
Insecticide averted an estimated 95 chikungunya cases and 114 dengue cases per 
100,000 people, 61 deaths, and 4,523 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). In 
sensitivity analysis, strategies that included dengue vaccination were 
cost-effective only when the vaccine cost was 14% of the current price.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Insecticide to prevent chikungunya and dengue in 
Colombia could generate significant health benefits and be cost-effective. 
Because of limits on diagnostic accuracy and vaccine efficacy, the cost of 
dengue testing and vaccination must decrease dramatically for such vaccination 
to be cost-effective in Colombia. The vectors for chikungunya and dengue have 
recently spread to new regions, highlighting the importance of understanding the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policies aimed at preventing these 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: In an aging society with increasing old age life expectancy, it has 
become increasingly important to monitor the health development in the 
population. This paper combines information on mortality and disability and 
explores educational inequalities in disability-free life expectancy in the 
aging population in Sweden, and to what extent these inequalities have increased 
or decreased over time.
METHODS: A random sample of the Swedish population aged 77 years and above 
(n=2895) provided information about disability in the population in the years 
2002, 2004, 2011 and 2014. The prevalence of disability was assessed by five 
items of personal activities of daily living and incorporated in period life 
tables for the corresponding years, using the Sullivan method. The analyses were 
stratified by sex and educational attainment. Estimates at ages 77 and 85 years 
are presented.
RESULTS: Disability-free life expectancy at age 77 years increased more than 
total life expectancy for all except men with lower education. Women with higher 
education had a 2.7-year increase and women with lower education a 1.6-year 
increase. The corresponding numbers for men were 2.0 and 0.8 years. The 
educational gap in disability-free life expectancy increased by 1.2 years at age 
77 years for both men and women.
CONCLUSIONS: While most of the increase in life expectancy was years free from 
disability, men with lower education had an increase of years with disability. 
The educational differences prevailed and increased over the period as the gains 
in disability-free life expectancy were smaller among those with lower 
education.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic Lower Limb Lymphedema (CL-LL) secondary to Kaposi sarcoma 
(KS) has not been recognized as a risk factor for cellulitis. The aim was to 
describe the clinical spectrum and use of antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients 
with cellulitis and CL-LL due to KS.
METHODS: HIV patients with KS, CL-LL, and at least one episode of cellulitis 
seen at the AIDS Cancer Clinic at INCan in Mexico from 2004 to 2019 were 
included. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from medical records.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine men all with CL-LL were included. Clinical factors 
associated with cellulitis were groin and/or lymph-node KS infiltration (69.2%), 
onychomycosis and/or tinea pedis (44.7%), ulcerated lesions (38.4%), and obesity 
(2.5%). Eighteen (46.1%) were hospitalized in the first episode and eight 
(20.5%) in recurrence. Six (25.3%) died, two of toxic shock syndrome (TSS), and 
one of septic shock. Fourteen (35.8%) had at least one recurrent episode of 
cellulitis. Twenty-five (64.1%) received prophylaxis. Patients without 
prophylaxis had significantly more unfavorable outcomes (hospitalization and 
recurrences) than those with prophylaxis.
CONCLUSIONS: CL-LL due to KS is a risk factor for cellulitis and severe 
complications in patients with a long life expectancy. Antimicrobial prophylaxis 
needs to be explored as it could prevent complications.

Background: Hypertension has become the second-leading risk factor for death 
worldwide. However, the fragmented three-level "county-township-village" medical 
and healthcare system in rural China cannot provide continuous, coordinated, and 
comprehensive health care for patients with hypertension, as a result of which 
rural China has a low rate of hypertension control. This study aimed to explore 
the costs and benefits of an integrated care model using three intervention 
modes-multidisciplinary teams (MDT), multi-institutional pathway (MIP), and 
system global budget and performance-based payments (SGB-P4P)-for hypertension 
management in rural China. Methods: A Markov model with 1-year per cycle was 
adopted to simulate the lifetime medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) for patients. The interventions included Option 1 (MDT + MIP), Option 2 
(MDT + MIP + SGB-P4P), and the Usual practice (usual care). We used the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), net monetary benefit (NMB), and net 
health benefit (NHB) to make economic decisions and a 5% discount rate. One-way 
and probability sensitivity analyses were performed to test model robustness. 
Data on the blood pressure control rate, transition probability, utility, annual 
treatment costs, and project costs were from the community intervention trial 
(CMB-OC) project. Results: Compared with the Usual practice, Option 1 yielded an 
additional 0.068 QALYs and an additional cost of $229.99, resulting in an ICER 
of $3,373.75/QALY, the NMB was -$120.97, and the NHB was -0.076 QALYs. Compared 
with the Usual practice, Option 2 yielded an additional 0.545 QALYs, and the 
cost decreased by $2,007.31, yielding an ICER of -$3,680.72/QALY. The NMB was 
$2,879.42, and the NHB was 1.801 QALYs. Compared with Option 1, Option 2 yielded 
an additional 0.477 QALYs, and the cost decreased by $2,237.30, so the ICER was 
-$4,688.50/QALY, the NMB was $3,000.40, and the NHB was 1.876 QALYs. The one-way 
sensitivity analysis showed that the most sensitive factors in the model were 
treatment cost of ESRD, human cost, and discount rate. The probability 
sensitivity analysis showed that when willingness to pay was $1,599.16/QALY, the 
cost-effectiveness probability of Option 1, Option 2, and the Usual practice was 
0.008, 0.813, and 0.179, respectively. Conclusions: The integrated care model 
with performance-based prepaid payments was the most beneficial intervention, 
whereas the general integrated care model (MDT + MIP) was not cost-effective. 
The integrated care model (MDT + MIP + SGB-P4P) was suggested for use in the 
community management of hypertension in rural China as a continuous, 
patient-centered care system to improve the efficiency of hypertension 
management.

Troponin-based Ca2+ regulation of striated muscle contraction emerged 
approximately 700 million years ago with largely conserved functions during 
evolution. Troponin I (TnI) is the inhibitory subunit of troponin and has
