reduced.
RESULTS: Population screening would reduce variant-attributable cancers by 
28.8%, cancer deaths by 31.2%, and CF/SMA/FXS cases by 24.8%, compared with 
targeted testing. Assuming AUD$400 per test, investment required would be 
between 4 and 5 times higher than current expenditure. However, screening would 
lead to substantial savings in medical costs and DALYs prevented, at a highly 
cost-effective ICER of AUD$4038/DALY. At AUD$200 per test, screening would 
approach cost-saving for the health system (ICER = AUD$22/DALY).
CONCLUSION: Preventive genomic screening in early adulthood would be highly 
cost-effective in a single-payer health-care system, but ethical issues must be 
considered.

Earlier work on RF metasurfaces for preclinical MRI has targeted applications 
such as whole-body imaging and dual-frequency coils. In these studies, a 
nonresonant loop was used to induce currents into a metasurface that was 
operated as a passive inductively powered resonator. However, as we show in this 
study, the strategy of using a resonant metasurface reduces the impact of the 
loop on the global performance of the assembled coil. To mitigate this 
deficiency, we developed a new approach that relies on the combination of a 
commercial surface coil and a coupled-wire structure operated away from its 
resonance. This strategy enables the extension of the sensitive volume of the 
surface coil while maintaining its local high sensitivity without any hardware 
modification. A wireless coil based on a two parallel coupled-wire structure was 
designed and electromagnetic field simulations were carried out with different 
levels of matching and coupling between both components of the coil. For 
experimental characterization, a prototype was built and tested at two 
frequencies, 300 MHz for 1 H and 282.6 MHz for 19 F at 7 T. Phantom and in vivo 
MRI experiments were conducted in different configurations to study signal and 
noise figures of the structure. The results showed that the proposed strategy 
improves the overall sensitive volume while simultaneously maintaining a high 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Metasurfaces based on coupled wires are therefore 
shown here as promising and versatile elements in the MRI RF chain, as they 
allow customized adjustment of the sensitive volume as a function of SNR yield. 
In addition, they can be easily adapted to different Larmor frequencies without 
loss of performance.

BACKGROUND: The drainage, irrigation and fibrinolytic therapy (DRIFT) trial, 
conducted in 2003-6, showed a reduced rate of death or severe disability at 2 
years in the DRIFT compared with the standard treatment group, among preterm 
infants with intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and post-haemorrhagic 
ventricular dilatation.
OBJECTIVES: To compare cognitive function, visual and sensorimotor ability, 
emotional well-being, use of specialist health/rehabilitative and educational 
services, neuroimaging, and economic costs and benefits at school age.
DESIGN: Ten-year follow-up of a randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Neonatal intensive care units (Bristol, Katowice, Glasgow and Bergen).
PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two of the original 77 infants randomised.
INTERVENTIONS: DRIFT or standard therapy (cerebrospinal fluid tapping).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary - cognitive disability. Secondary - vision; 
sensorimotor disability; emotional/behavioural function; education; 
neurosurgical sequelae on magnetic resonance imaging; preference-based measures 
of health-related quality of life; costs of neonatal treatment and of subsequent 
health care in childhood; health and social care costs and impact on family at 
age 10 years; and a decision analysis model to estimate the cost-effectiveness 
of DRIFT compared with standard treatment up to the age of 18 years.
RESULTS: By 10 years of age, 12 children had died and 13 were either lost to 
follow-up or had declined to participate. A total of 52 children were assessed 
at 10 years of age (DRIFT, n = 28; standard treatment, n = 24). Imbalances in 
gender and birthweight favoured the standard treatment group. The unadjusted 
mean cognitive quotient (CQ) score was 69.3 points [standard deviation (SD) 30.1 
points] in the DRIFT group compared with 53.7 points (SD 35.7 points) in the 
standard treatment group, a difference of 15.7 points, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) -2.9 to 34.2 points; p = 0.096. After adjusting for the prespecified 
covariates (gender, birthweight and grade of IVH), this evidence strengthened: 
children who received DRIFT had a CQ advantage of 23.5 points (p = 0.009). The 
binary outcome, alive without severe cognitive disability, gave strong evidence 
that DRIFT improved cognition [unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.6 (95% CI 1.2 to 
11.0; p = 0.026) and adjusted OR 10.0 (95% CI 2.1 to 46.7; p = 0.004)]; the 
number needed to treat was three. No significant differences were found in any 
secondary outcomes. There was weak evidence that DRIFT reduced special school 
attendance (adjusted OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.05; p = 0.059). The neonatal stay 
(unadjusted mean difference £6556, 95% CI -£11,161 to £24,273) and subsequent 
hospital care (£3413, 95% CI -£12,408 to £19,234) costs were higher in the DRIFT 
arm, but the wide CIs included zero. The decision analysis model indicated that 
DRIFT has the potential to be cost-effective at 18 years of age. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (£15,621 per quality-adjusted life-year) was below the 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold. The 
cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to adjustment for birthweight and 
gender.
LIMITATIONS: The main limitations are the sample size of the trial and that 
important characteristics were unbalanced at baseline and at the 10-year 
follow-up. Although the analyses conducted here were prespecified in the 
analysis plan, they had not been prespecified in the original trial 
registration.
CONCLUSIONS: DRIFT improves cognitive function when taking into account 
birthweight, grade of IVH and gender. DRIFT is probably effective and, given the 
reduction in the need for special education, has the potential to be 
cost-effective as well. A future UK multicentre trial is required to assess 
efficacy and safety of DRIFT when delivered across multiple sites.

OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis is a prevalent disease in the population (range 
0.5% to 1%) and involves both orthopedic and rheumatologic treatment. The Time 
Trade-Off (TTO) technique, which determines the number of years the patient or 
the professional would be allowed before a successful procedure in terms of life 
expectancy and value of the procedure, has been gaining ground in clinical 
protocols. From this standpoint, we sought to compare evaluations provided by 
the patients, orthopedists, and rheumatologists in determining the TTO and to 
correlate their responses with the clinical repercussions using previously 
established scores such as the Brief Michigan Hand Questionnaire and the Disease 
Activity Score-28 (DAS-28).
METHODS: A prospective study was conducted that involved 37 patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis, orthopedists, and rheumatologists. The TTO questionnaire 
was administered by an independent evaluator for evaluation using the DAS-28 and 
the Brief Michigan Hand Questionnaire.
RESULTS: The descriptive analysis revealed similar medians between the 
orthopedists, rheumatologists, and patients for single assessments. However, 
there was a weak correlation between the results from the patient and 
rheumatologist, the patient and Brief Michigan Questionnaire, and those of the 
orthopedic surgeon and the DAS-28.
CONCLUSION: Similar median values demonstrated equivalent TTO among the 
orthopedist, rheumatologist, and patient. However, given the weak correlations 
between the scores, it was not possible to substitute results using a single 
evaluation scale. Level of Evidence II, Prognostic Studies.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Artrite reumatoide é uma doença prevalente na população 
(0,5% a 1%), envolvendo tratamento tanto ortopédico, quanto reumatológico. A 
técnica do “Time Trade Off”, que determina a quantidade de anos que o paciente 
ou o profissional daria para ter sucesso absoluto em determinado procedimento, 
vem ganhando espaço nos protocolos modernos. Diante disto, comparamos a 
avaliação dada pelo paciente, pelo ortopedista e pelo reumatologista usando 
“Time Trade Off” e correlacionamos com repercussão clínica e escores já 
estabelecidos: Brief Michigan Questionnaire (Anexo I) e Disease Activity 
Score-28 (DAS-28) (Anexo II).
MÉTODOS: Estudo prospectivo com 37 pacientes diagnosticados com artrite 
reumatoide, que foram submetidos ao questionário “Time Trade Off” pelo 
ortopedista, pelo reumatologista e por um avaliador independente, e avaliação 
através do DAS-28 e do Brief Michigan.
RESULTADOS: Através da análise descritiva, notou-se medianas semelhantes entre 
ortopedista, reumatologista e paciente. Entretanto, evidenciou-se correlação 
fraca entre paciente e reumatologista, paciente e o Brief Michigan; e 
ortopedista e o DAS-28.
CONCLUSÃO: Valores de mediana semelhantes demonstram “Time Trade Off” 
equivalentes entre ortopedista, reumatologista e paciente. Mas, diante das 
correlações fracas entre os escores, não foi possível substituí-los por uma 
escala única de avaliação. Nível de Evidência II, Estudo Prognóstico.

Human aging is currently defined as a physiological decline of biological 
functions in the body with a continual adaptation to internal and external 
damaging. The endocrine system plays a major role in orchestrating cellular 
interactions, metabolism, growth, and aging. Several in vivo studies from worms 
to mice showed that downregulated activity of the GH/IGF-1/insulin pathway could 
be beneficial for the extension of human life span, whereas results are 
contradictory in humans. In the present review, we discuss the potential role of 
the IGF-1 system in modulation of longevity, hypothesizing that the endocrine 
and metabolic adaptation observed in centenarians and in mammals during caloric 
restriction may be a physiological strategy for extending lifespan through a 
slower cell growing/metabolism, a better physiologic reserve capacity, a shift 
of cellular metabolism from cell proliferation to repair activities and a 
decrease in accumulation of senescent cells. Therefore, understanding of the 
link between IGF-1/insulin system and longevity may have future clinical 
applications in promoting healthy aging and in Rehabilitation Medicine.

BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a life-threatening mental disorder that is 
associated with substantial caregiver burden. Carers of individuals with AN 
report high levels of distress and self-blame, and insufficient knowledge to 
help their loved ones. However, carers can have a very important role to play in 
aiding recovery from AN, and are often highly motivated to assist in the 
treatment process. This manuscript presents the protocol for a randomised 
controlled trial (RCT) of We Can, a web-based intervention for carers for people 
with AN. The study aims to investigate the effectiveness of We Can delivered 
with different intensities of support.
METHODS: The study takes the form of a multi-site, two-country, three group RCT, 
comparing We Can (a) with clinician messaging support (We Can-Ind), (b) with 
moderated carer chatroom support (We Can-Chat) and (c) with online forum only 
(We Can-Forum). Participants will be 303 carers of individuals with AN as well 
as, where possible, the individuals with AN themselves. Recruitment will be via 
specialist eating disorder services and carer support services in the UK and 
Germany. Randomisation of carers to one of the three intervention conditions in 
a 1:1:1 ratio will be stratified by whether or not the individual with AN has 
(a) agreed to participate in the study and (b) is a current inpatient. The We 
Can intervention will be provided to carers online over a period of 12 weeks. 
Participants will complete self-report questionnaires at pre-intervention (T1), 
mid-intervention (mediators only; 4-weeks post-randomisation), post-intervention 
(T2; 3-months post randomisation), and 6 months (T3) and 12 months (T4) after 
randomisation. The primary outcome variables are carer symptoms of depression 
and anxiety. Secondary outcome variables will be measured in both carers and 
individuals with AN. Secondary carer outcome variables will include alcohol and 
drug use and quality of life, caregiving behaviour, and the acceptability and 
use of We Can and associated supports. Secondary outcomes measured in 
individuals with AN will include eating disorder symptoms, and symptoms of 
depression and anxiety. The study will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
the three We Can conditions, and test for mediators and moderators of the 
effects of We Can. The trial is registered at the International Standard 
Randomisation Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) database, registration number: 
ISRCTN11399850.
DISCUSSION: The study will provide insight into the effectiveness of We Can and 
its optimal method/s of delivery.

In the present study, binding of cellulase protein to different clay minerals 
were tested using fluorescent-protein complex and microscopic techniques. 
Cellulase gene (Cel5H) was cloned into three fluorescent vectors and expressed 
as fusion enzymes. Binding of Cel5H-mineral particles was confirmed by confocal 
microscopy, and enzyme assay. Among the Cel5H-fusion enzymes, green-fusion 
enzyme showed higher intensity compared with other red and yellow 
fusion-proteins. Intensity of fusion-proteins was dependent on the pH of the 
medium. Confocal microscopy revealed binding of the all three fusion proteins 
with different clay minerals. However, montmorillonite displayed higher binding 
capacity than kaolinite clay. Likewise, atomic force microscopy (AFM) image 
profile analysis showed proteins appeared globular molecules in free-state on 
mica surface with an average cross sectional diameter of 110 ± 2 nm and rough 
surface of montmorillonite made protein appear flattened due to structural 
alteration. Even surface of kaolinite also exerted some strain on protein 
molecular conformation after binding to surface. Our results provide further 
evidence for 3D visualization of enzyme-soil complex and encourage furthering 
study of the force involved interactions. Therefore, our results indicate that 
binding of proteins to clay minerals was external and provides a molecular 
method to observe the interaction of clay minerals-enzyme complex.

On the Etiopathogenesis and Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease: A 
Comprehensive Theoretical Review.

Alzheimers' disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, with an estimated 
5 million new cases occurring annually. Among the elderly, AD shortens life 
expectancy, results in disability, decreases quality of life, and ultimately, 
leads to institutionalization. Despite extensive research in the last few 
decades, its heterogeneous pathophysiology and etiopathogenesis have made it 
difficult to develop an effective treatment and prevention strategy. Aging is 
the biggest risk factor for AD and evidence suggest that the total number of 
older people in the population is going to increase astronomically in the next 
decades. Also, there is evidence that air pollution and increasing income 
inequality may result in higher incidence and prevalence of AD. This makes the 
need for a comprehensive understanding of the etiopathogenesis and 
pathophysiology of the disease extremely critical. In this paper, a quintuple 
framework of thyroid dysfunction, vitamin D deficiency, sex hormones, and 
mitochondria dysfunction and oxidative stress are used to provide a 
comprehensive description of AD etiopathogenesis and pathophysiology. The 
individual role of each factor, their synergistic and genetic interactions, as 
well as the limitations of the framework are discussed.

IMPORTANCE: Recent US health care reforms incentivize improved population health 
outcomes and primary care functions. It remains unclear how much improving 
primary care physician supply can improve population health, independent of 
other health care and socioeconomic factors.
OBJECTIVES: To identify primary care physician supply changes across US counties 
from 2005-2015 and associations between such changes and population mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This epidemiological study evaluated US 
population data and individual-level claims data linked to mortality from 2005 
to 2015 against changes in primary care and specialist physician supply from 
2005 to 2015. Data from 3142 US counties, 7144 primary care service areas, and 
306 hospital referral regions were used to investigate the association of 
primary care physician supply with changes in life expectancy and cause-specific 
mortality after adjustment for health care, demographic, socioeconomic, and 
behavioral covariates. Analysis was performed from March to July 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age-standardized life expectancy, cause-specific 
mortality, and restricted mean survival time.
RESULTS: Primary care physician supply increased from 196 014 physicians in 2005 
to 204 419 in 2015. Owing to disproportionate losses of primary care physicians 
in some counties and population increases, the mean (SD) density of primary care 
physicians relative to population size decreased from 46.6 per 100 000 
population (95% CI, 0.0-114.6 per 100 000 population) to 41.4 per 100 000 
population (95% CI, 0.0-108.6 per 100 000 population), with greater losses in 
rural areas. In adjusted mixed-effects regressions, every 10 additional primary 
care physicians per 100 000 population was associated with a 51.5-day increase 
in life expectancy (95% CI, 29.5-73.5 days; 0.2% increase), whereas an increase 
in 10 specialist physicians per 100 000 population corresponded to a 19.2-day 
increase (95% CI, 7.0-31.3 days). A total of 10 additional primary care 
physicians per 100 000 population was associated with reduced cardiovascular, 
cancer, and respiratory mortality by 0.9% to 1.4%. Analyses at different 
geographic levels, using instrumental variable regressions, or at the individual 
level found similar benefits associated with primary care supply.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Greater primary care physician supply was associated 
with lower mortality, but per capita supply decreased between 2005 and 2015. 
Programs to explicitly direct more resources to primary care physician supply 
may be important for population health.

Pinellia ternata is a traditional Chinese herb that has been shown to suffer 
from continuous cropping. Deterioration in continuous P. ternata cropping soils 
and the effect of alteration of crop rotation on the soil were evaluated by 
using Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. Soil physicochemical 
properties and fungal diversity were significantly lower in continuous P. 
ternate cropping soil compared with those of uncultivated soil. In contrast, 
significant increases in soil factors and fungal diversity were detected after 
the continuous cropping soil was subjected to rotational cropping treatments, 
indicating a remediation effect of crop rotation on continuous cropping soil. 
Moreover, with the extension of wheat cropping in the rotations, fungal richness 
and most physicochemical properties exhibited a significantly increasing trend, 
suggesting that the remediation effect of crop rotation could be enhanced by 
extending the cropping of break crops. Furthermore, compared with those of 
continuous cropping soils, microbes that were potentially beneficial to P. 
ternate were enriched in the rhizosphere by rotational cropping, whereas 
micro-organisms that supposedly lead to soil deterioration were suppressed. 
Redundancy analysis indicated that Podospora and Alternaria were the major 
microbes that were responsible for increasing soil physicochemical properties; 
by contrast, the deterioration in soil fertility was mainly attributed to 
Fusarium micro-organisms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Knowledge of 
deterioration in continuous Pinellia ternate cropping soils and how crop 
rotations alter the deteriorated soil is still limited, especially regarding the 
presence of fungi and soil fertility. This research found remediation effects of 
crop rotation on continuous P. ternate cropping soils and indicates that these 
effects could be enhanced by extending the cropping of break crops. Community 
shifts between the continuous and rotational cropping soils and the associated 
changes in soil fertility will have a considerable impact on the diagnosis of 
obstacles to continuous P. ternate cropping and enhancement of the remediation 
effects of crop rotation.

Compared to the general population, individuals diagnosed with Schizophrenia 
(SCZ) experience a higher frequency and an earlier onset of chronic medical 
disorders, resulting in a reduction in life expectancy by an average of 15-25 
years. Recently, it has been hypothesized that SCZ is a syndrome of accelerated 
aging. Childhood adversity was also associated with the pathogenesis and course 
of SCZ. Our hypothesis was that both SCZ patients and their unaffected siblings 
would have shorter telomere length (TL) compared to of non-clinical controls. 
Our additional goals were to determine (1) whether shorter TL correlates with 
intermediate phenotypes of SCZ (i.e. Psychosis-like symptoms and schizotypal 
traits); and (2) whether childhood adversities have a moderating role in TL 
shortening among SCZ and their unaffected siblings. To this end, SCZ patients 
(n = 100), their unaffected siblings (n = 100) and non-clinical controls 
(n = 100) were enrolled. The main variables were TL, measured by aTL-qPCR; 
psychotic-like and schizotypal symptoms, assessed by The Community Assessment of 
Psychic Experience (CAPE) and the Structured Interview for Schizotypy-Revised 
(SIS-R), respectively; and childhood adversities evaluated by the Childhood 
Experience of Care and Abuse (CECA)-Interview. Potentially relevant variables 
also included in the analyses were: Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) 
scores, cognitive performance, and socio-demographic features. In contrast to 
our hypothesis patients had similar TL when compared to the non-clinical 
controls. Interestingly, unaffected siblings had longer TL compared to both 
patients and controls (p < 0.001). Independent from group status a negative 
correlation was observed between TL and psychotic-like symptoms as rated by the 
CAPE (p < 0.01). Childhood adversities, especially loneliness between ages 0 and 
11 were also negatively associated with TL (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that 
psychometric liability to psychosis and childhood adversities may be associated 
with shorter TL. Unaffected siblings had longer TL, suggesting the potential 
role of resilience on both the TL and the clinical presentation. These findings 
must be considered preliminary, calling for larger-scale replication efforts.

BACKGROUND: The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is used for 
universal infant vaccination in Turkey.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost effectiveness of replacing PCV13 with 
pneumococcal nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine 
(PHiD-CV).
METHODS: A Markov cohort model with monthly cycles following 1 cohort of infants 
over a 10-year time horizon was used. Local input parameters were obtained from 
published sources and expert consultation whenever possible. The model was 
adapted to estimate the health benefits and economic impact of each vaccine on 
invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM). An 
annual discount rate of 3% was used for benefits and costs (2016 euros).
RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, vaccinating 1 birth cohort of 1 325 783 
infants with PHiD-CV instead of PCV13 was predicted to have the same impact on 
meningitis and pneumonia, a similar impact on bacteremia (+30 cases), but 
greater reductions in AOM-related general practitioner visits (-34 955) and 
hospitalizations (-624). Assuming equal vaccine prices, PHiD-CV was predicted to 
be dominant over PCV13 (176 additional quality-adjusted life-years while saving 
€635 330 [discounted]). One-way sensitivity analysis indicated that varying the 
vaccine price differential had the largest effect on the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, and then AOM parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis predicted PHiD-CV to be dominant over PCV13 in 92.4% of simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Any difference in price between PHiD-CV and PCV13 is expected to be 
the key driver of vaccine choice for preventing childhood pneumococcal disease 
in Turkey. At price parity, PHiD-CV use is likely to be a dominant strategy over 
the use of PCV13.

BACKGROUND: The U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recently 
developed recommendations for use of a new recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with RZV compared 
with zoster vaccine live (ZVL) and no vaccination, the cost-effectiveness of 
vaccination with RZV for persons who have previously received ZVL, and the 
cost-effectiveness of preferential vaccination with RZV over ZVL.
DESIGN: Simulation (state-transition) model using U.S. epidemiologic, clinical, 
and cost data.
DATA SOURCES: Published data.
TARGET POPULATION: Hypothetical cohort of immunocompetent U.S. adults aged 50 
years or older.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal and health care sector.
INTERVENTION: Vaccination with RZV (recommended 2-dose regimen), vaccination 
with ZVL, and no vaccination.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: For vaccination with RZV compared with no 
vaccination, ICERs ranged by age from $10 000 to $47 000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY), using a societal perspective and assuming 100% completion of 
the 2-dose RZV regimen. For persons aged 60 years or older, ICERs were less than 
$60 000 per QALY. Vaccination with ZVL was dominated by vaccination with RZV for 
all age groups 60 years or older.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were most sensitive to changes in 
vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, herpes zoster incidence, and 
probability of postherpetic neuralgia. Vaccination with RZV after previous 
administration of ZVL yielded an ICER of less than $60 000 per QALY for persons 
aged 60 years or older. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, RZV remained the 
preferred strategy in at least 95% of simulations, including those with 50% 
completion of the second dose.
LIMITATION: Few data were available on risk for serious adverse events, 
adherence to the recommended 2-dose regimen, and probability of recurrent 
zoster.
CONCLUSION: Vaccination with RZV yields cost-effectiveness ratios lower than 
those for many recommended adult vaccines, including ZVL. Results are robust 
over a wide range of plausible values.

BACKGROUND: The proportion of older people has dramatically increased in recent 
decades. Moreover, social and demographic trends show a global increase of older 
people at risk of loneliness and lack of social relationships. The objective of 
this study was to evaluate the process, the effectiveness and the 
cost-effectiveness of a planned 22 weekly group sessions called School of Health 
for Older People to reduce social isolation.
METHODS: This is a mixed methods multi-approach evaluation that includes: 1) A 
qualitative evaluation among coordinators and participants taking part in the 
intervention, through in depth-interviews and focus groups, respectively. The 
main topics covered will be positive and negative aspects of the intervention, 
suggestions for its improvement, opinions on different aspects of the 
intervention, and perceived benefits; 2) A quantitative quasi-experimental 
design, comparing a group of individuals taking part in the intervention with 
another group with similar characteristics not receiving the intervention. Data 
will be collected at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Social 
support will be measured through questions drawn from the Medical Outcomes Study 
and the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project questionnaires. 
Psychological morbidity will be measured through Goldberg's General Health 
Questionnaire, and Health-related Quality of Life will be measured through the 
EuroQoL questionnaire. Information on visits to the primary care center in the 
years before and after the intervention will be obtained from the electronic 
records of the primary care centers; 3) A cost-utility analysis, which will be 
conducted from a health system (primary care) perspective, including direct 
costs of the program and the primary care health services used. The effects of 
the intervention will be measured on quality-adjusted life years.
DISCUSSION: There is an urgent need for studies assessing the effectiveness and 
the efficiency of potential interventions to reduce social isolation among older 
persons. The results of this study will help to fill the knowledge gap in this 
area and might be especially useful for the development of social and public 
health policies and programs for older people in disadvantaged neighborhoods in 
urban areas.

BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy results in more elderly people struggling 
with age related diseases and functional conditions. This poses huge challenges 
towards establishing new approaches for maintaining health at a higher age. An 
important aspect for age related deterioration of the general patient condition 
is frailty. The frailty syndrome is associated with a high risk for falls, 
hospitalization, disability, and finally increased mortality. Using predictive 
data mining enables the discovery of potential risk factors and can be used as 
clinical decision support system, which provides the medical doctor with 
information on the probable clinical patient outcome. This enables the 
professional to react promptly and to avert likely adverse events in advance.
METHODS: Medical data of 474 study participants containing 284 health related 
parameters, including questionnaire answers, blood parameters and vital 
parameters from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging (TSHA) was used. Binary 
classification models were built in order to distinguish between frail and 
non-frail study subjects.
RESULTS: Using the available TSHA data and the discovered potential predictors, 
it was possible to design, develop and evaluate a variety of different 
predictive models for the frailty syndrome. The best performing model was the 
support vector machine (SVM, 78.31%). Moreover, a methodology was developed, 
making it possible to explore and to use incomplete medical data and further 
identify potential predictors and enable interpretability.
CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that it is feasible to use incomplete, 
imbalanced medical data for the development of a predictive model for the 
frailty syndrome. Moreover, potential predictive factors have been discovered, 
which were clinically approved by the clinicians. Future work will improve 
prediction accuracy, especially with regard to separating the group of frail 
patients into frail and pre-frail ones and analyze the differences among them.

CONTEXT: Cardiovascular disease in the U.S. accounted for healthcare cost and 
productivity losses of $330 billion in 2013-2014 and diabetes accounted for $327 
billion in 2017. The impact is disproportionate on minority and low-SES 
populations. This paper examines the available evidence on cost, economic 
benefit, and cost effectiveness of interventions that engage community health 
workers to prevent cardiovascular disease, prevent type 2 diabetes, and manage 
type 2 diabetes.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Literature from the inception of databases through July 
2016 was searched for studies with economic information, yielding nine studies 
in cardiovascular disease prevention, seven studies in type 2 diabetes 
prevention, and 13 studies in type 2 diabetes management. Analyses were done in 
2017. Monetary values are reported in 2016 U.S. dollars.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The median intervention cost per patient per year was $329 
for cardiovascular disease prevention, $600 for type 2 diabetes prevention, and 
$571 for type 2 diabetes management. The median change in healthcare cost per 
patient per year was -$82 for cardiovascular disease prevention and -$72 for 
type 2 diabetes management. For type 2 diabetes prevention, one study saw no 
change and another reported -$1,242 for healthcare cost. One study reported a 
favorable 1.8 return on investment from engaging community health workers for 
cardiovascular disease prevention. Median cost per quality-adjusted life year 
gained was $17,670 for cardiovascular disease prevention, $17,138 (mean) for 
type 2 diabetes prevention, and $35,837 for type 2 diabetes management.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions engaging community health workers are cost effective 
for cardiovascular disease prevention and type 2 diabetes management, based on a 
conservative $50,000 benchmark for cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. 
Two cost per quality-adjusted life year estimates for type 2 diabetes prevention 
were far below the $50,000 benchmark.

OBJECTIVE: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic aneurysms 
(AAAs) is the standard treatment for anatomically suitable patients. EVAR has 
been associated with a lower perioperative morbidity and mortality compared with 
open surgical repair (OSR) at the expense of increased reinterventions and 
costs. We aimed to compare the outcomes of EVAR and OSR for elective AAA repair. 
The primary end point was cost per QALY at 3 years. Secondary end points were 
perioperative morbidity and mortality; freedom from reintervention; length of 
hospital, high-dependency unit, and intensive care unit stay; and freedom from 
all-cause mortality.
METHODS: The project was approved by the Galway Clinical Research Ethics 
Committee. This project followed the Declaration of Helsinki. This was an audit 
of interventions that had already taken place. No active clinical intervention 
was undertaken, and patients' anonymity was preserved; thus, individual patient 
consent was not obtained. Data on all elective AAA repairs at a tertiary 
referral vascular center were collected from 2002 to 2015. Demographics and 
outcomes were reported according to the Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines. 
QALY was measured on the basis of a quality-adjusted time without symptoms or 
toxicity assessment. Data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric 
tests.
RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2015, a total of 494 patients required elective AAA 
surgery; 401 underwent EVAR and 93 underwent OSR. Demographics and 
vascular-related risk factors were similar in both groups. Median (interquartile 
range) cost per QALY at 3 years was €5776 (€5541-€6481) for EVAR vs €7101 
(€5812-€8952) for OSR (P < .001). EVAR was associated with reduced perioperative 
morbidity (12.2% vs 50%; P < .001). There was no significant association between 
procedure and perioperative mortality (EVAR, 1.7%; OSR, 4.3%; P = .130). There 
was no significant association found between the procedure and reintervention 
(P = .502). Our subgroup analysis found no association between procedure and 
improvement in all-cause mortality, QALYs, costs, or cost per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: EVAR is cost-effective with improved cost per QALY compared with 
OSR.
