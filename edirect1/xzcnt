Background: Model structure, despite being a key source of uncertainty in 
economic evaluations, is often not treated as a priority for model development. 
In oncology, partitioned survival models (PSMs) and Markov models, both types of 
cohort model, are commonly used, but patient responses to newer immuno-oncology 
(I-O) agents suggest that more innovative model frameworks should be explored. 
Objective: A discussion of the theoretical pros and cons of cohort level vs 
patient level simulation (PLS) models provides the background for an 
illustrative comparison of I-O therapies, namely nivolumab/ipilimumab 
combination and ipilimumab alone using patient level data from the CheckMate 067 
trial in metastatic melanoma. PSM, Markov, and PLS models were compared on the 
basis of coherence with short-term clinical trial endpoints and long-term cost 
per QALY outcomes reported. Methods: The PSM was based on Kaplan-Meier curves 
from CheckMate 067 with 3-year data on progression free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS). The Markov model used time independent transition 
probabilities based on the average trajectory of PFS and OS over the trial 
period. The PLS model was developed based on baseline characteristics 
hypothesized to be associated with disease as well as significant mortality and 
disease progression risk factors identified through a proportional hazards 
model. Results: The short-term Markov model outputs matched the 1-3 year 
clinical trial results approximately as well as the PSMs for OS but not PFS. The 
fixed (average) cohort PLS results corresponded as well as the PSMs for OS in 
the combination therapy arm and PFS in the monotherapy arm. Over the lifetime 
horizon, the PLS produced an additional 5.95 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) 
associated with combination therapy relative to ipilimumab alone, resulting in 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £6,474 per QALY, compared with 
£14,194 for the PSMs which gave an incremental benefit of between 2.2 and 2.4 
QALYs. The Markov model was an outlier (∼ £49,000 per QALY in the base case). 
Conclusions: The 4- and 5-state versions of the PSM cohort model estimated in 
this study deviate from the standard 3-state approach to better capture I-O 
response patterns. Markov and PLS approaches, by modeling state transitions 
explicitly, could be more informative in understanding I-O immune response, the 
PLS particularly so by reflecting heterogeneity in treatment response. However, 
both require a number of assumptions to capture the immune response effectively. 
Better I-O representation with surrogate endpoints in future clinical trials 
could yield greater model validity across all models.

PURPOSE: Clinical experience suggests that functional decline (FD) during 
treatment may have a major adverse impact on outcome. Geriatric assessment of 
older patients before cancer treatment is usually based on use of a screening 
tool (such as G8) followed by comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). However, 
many oncology teams cannot implement geriatric oncology management due to 
non-availability of geriatricians. Consequently, we decided to evaluate whether 
a procedure using G8 and routinely available factors could help oncologists 
foresee the outcome in patients ≥70: we firstly evaluated whether functional 
decline is a determinant of early death, then searched for predictors of early 
functional decline (measured before initiation of the second cycle of 
chemotherapy), including G8 but voluntarilly excluding CGA.
METHODS: We tested the value of clinical, biological factors and early FD to 
predict early death on a cohort of 292 patients (≥70 years) treated with 
first-line chemotherapy. We then used a logistic regression model to search for 
pretreatment predictors of FD, including the same factors and G8 but excluding 
CGA.
RESULTS: FD occurred in 48 patients. In multivariate analyses, early FD 
(OR = 4.13, 95% CI [1.89; 9.04], p < .01), disease extension (OR = 4.55, 95% CI 
[1.96; 10.57]; p < .01), and being male (OR = 2.59, 95% CI [1.12; 5.97], p 
= .02) were significant prognostic factors for early death; G8 was the only 
significant factor associated with FD (OR = 4.38, 95% CI [1.28; 14.92], 
p = .018).
CONCLUSIONS: FD has an important prognostic significance in patients ≥70 treated 
with chemotherapy, and G8 predicts for its occurrence. These data reinforce the 
routine use of G8 in the management of these patients.

Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent guidelines on colorectal cancer (CRC) screening 
recommend starting screening earlier than before. We performed a simulation 
study to examine and compare the optimal ages to have once-only screening 
colonoscopy and repeated colonoscopies.
METHODS: A Markov model was set up using data from the German national screening 
colonoscopy registry to simulate the natural history of the adenoma-carcinoma 
process. CRC deaths and years of potential life lost (YPLL) for a hypothetical 
unscreened 50-year-old German population were estimated for a single screening 
colonoscopy or 2 or 3 screening colonoscopies with 10-year intervals at various 
ages.
RESULTS: One single screening colonoscopy performed between 50 and 65 years of 
age was expected to reduce CRC death by 49% to 69% and YPLL by 51% to 68%. An 
inverted U-shaped association was found between screening age and proportion of 
CRC deaths or YPLL prevented. The optimal age for once-only colonoscopy that 
yielded the highest reductions in YPLL was around 54 years for men and 56 years 
for women. Estimates were approximately 6 to 8 years higher when proportions of 
CRC deaths prevented were examined. For 2 or 3 screening colonoscopies, the 
optimal starting age fell to around 50 years or even younger for both genders.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the YPLL estimates, in a high CRC incidence and high life 
expectancy country like Germany, the optimal age for once-only screening 
colonoscopy is around 55 years and possibly slightly younger for men than for 
women. When 2 or more screening colonoscopies are offered with 10-year 
intervals, screening should start at age 50 at the latest or possibly even 
younger for both genders.

For centuries there has been an ongoing search to identify the secrets of long 
life and healthy aging. Recently, multiple factors have been identified, 
including genetics, the introduction of antibiotics, vaccines, and public 
health, effective management of cardiovascular risk factors, advances in 
surgery, eliminating or modifying high-risk behaviors, family and social 
supports, eliminating wars and poverty, luck, exercise and nutrition, and 
psychological factors such as optimism and conscientiousness. To increase a 
maximum life span now estimated to be 115-120 years will involve manipulation of 
genes and the body's stem cells and the potential use of senolytic drugs (that 
kill old cells), which will need to be investigated. This is a worthy pursuit if 
these interventions will also maintain or enhance quality of life.

Variations in access to health care are known to contribute to differences in 
life expectancy, morbidity and health-related quality-of-life across population 
subgroups. We undertook a scoping review to identify what is known about 
in-country variations in access to services for adults with multiple sclerosis 
and to identify gaps in the literature to inform future research and national 
policies. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PSYCHINFO, SocINDEX and Social 
Science Abstracts from inception to end of December 2016 for quantitative 
studies which had investigated differences in access to prevention services, 
healthcare services, treatments and social care between inequality groups, 
defined using the PROGRESS-PLUS framework. A total of 4959 unique abstracts 
yielded 36 papers which met our eligibility criteria. Only 3 studies were cohort 
studies and only 4 were population-based; most were from the United States 
(n = 27). There were 6 studies on access to MS focused care and 6 on access to 
Disease Modifying drugs. There were 3 studies on access to prevention/lifestyle 
programmes and none on access to welfare services or information support. There 
were no papers examining inequalities in access for 'vulnerable' groups, such 
as, those with learning disability. In the available studies, there was evidence 
of inequalities in access to services with a trend for worse access among men, 
older age groups, those from lower socio-economic groups or the least educated, 
non-caucasians, those with mental health problems and those from rural areas. In 
the studies on access to disease modifying treatments, older age and lower 
socioeconomic status were consistently associated with a lower rate of uptake, 
while race and gender were not. Inequalities or disparities in access to all 
levels of services and treatments will need to be addressed through a strategic 
research agenda with an emphasis on population-based studies and development and 
evaluation of interventions to reduce inequality.

OBJECTIVE: Both endovascular coiling and the Pipeline embolization device (PED) 
have been shown to be safe and clinically effective for treatment of small (< 10 
mm) aneurysms. The authors conducted a comparative effectiveness analysis to 
compare the utility of these treatment methods in terms of health benefits.
METHODS: A decision-analytical study was performed with Markov modeling methods 
to simulate patients with small unruptured aneurysms undergoing endovascular 
coiling, stent-assisted coiling (SAC), or PED placement for treatment. Input 
probabilities were derived from prior literature, and 1-way, 2-way, and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess model and input 
parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: The base case calculation for a 50-year-old man reveals PED to have a 
higher health benefit (17.48 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) than coiling 
(17.44 QALYs) or SAC (17.36 QALYs). PED is the better option in 6020 of the 
10,000 iterations in probabilistic sensitivity analysis. When the retreatment 
rate of PED is lower than 9.53%, and the coiling retreatment is higher than 
15.6%, PED is the better strategy. In the 2-way sensitivity analysis varying the 
retreatment rates from both treatment modalities, when the retreatment rate of 
PED is approximately 14% lower than the retreatment rate of coiling, PED is the 
more favorable treatment strategy. Otherwise, coiling is more effective. SAC may 
be better than PED when the unfavorable outcome risk of SAC is lower than 70% of 
its reported current value.
CONCLUSIONS: With the increasing use of PEDs for treatment of small unruptured 
aneurysms, the current study indicates that these devices may have higher health 
benefits due to lower rates of retreatment compared to both simple coiling and 
stent-assisted techniques. Longer follow-up studies are needed to document the 
rates of recurrence and retreatment after coiling and PED to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of these strategies.

Bone is the most frequent site of metastasis of the most common cancers in men 
and women. Bone metastasis incidence has been steadily increasing over the 
years, mainly because of higher life expectancy in oncologic patients. Although 
bone metastases are sometimes asymptomatic, their consequences are most often 
devastating, impairing both life quality and expectancy, due to the occurrence 
of the skeletal-related events, including bone fractures, hypercalcemia and 
spinal cord compression. Up to 75% of patients endure crippling cancer-induced 
bone pain (CIBP), against which we have very few weapons. This review's purpose 
is to discuss the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to CIBP, including 
how cancer cells convert the bone "virtuous cycle" into a cancer-fuelling 
"vicious cycle", and how this leads to the release of molecular mediators of 
pain, including protons, neurotrophins, interleukins, chemokines and ATP. 
Preclinical tests and assays to evaluate CIBP, including the incapacitance 
tester (in vivo), and neuron/glial activation in the dorsal root ganglia/spinal 
cord (ex vivo) will also be presented. Furthermore, current therapeutic options 
for CIBP are quite limited and nonspecific and they will also be discussed, 
along with up-and-coming options that may render CIBP easier to treat and let 
patients forget they are patients.

BACKGROUND: Medical oncology outpatients are a group for whom advance care 
planning (ACP) activities are particularly relevant. Patient views can help 
prioritise areas for improving end of life communication. The study aimed to 
determine in a sample of medical oncology outpatients: (1) the perceived 
importance of participating in ACP activities; (2) the proportion of patients 
who have ever participated in ACP activities; and (3) the proportion of patients 
who had not yet participated in ACP activities who were willing to do so in next 
month.
METHODS: Adult medical oncology outpatients in two Australian cancer treatment 
centres were consecutively approached to complete a pen-and-paper survey. Items 
explored perceived importance, previous participation, and willingness to 
participate across key ACP activities including: discussing wishes with their 
family or doctor; recording wishes in a written document; appointing a 
substitute decision maker (SDM); and discussing life-expectancy.
RESULTS: 185 participants completed the survey (51% consent rate). Most patients 
agreed it was important to: discuss end of life wishes with family (85%) and 
doctors (70%) and formally record wishes (73%). Few had discussed end of life 
wishes with a doctor (11%), recorded their wishes (15%); chosen a SDM (28%); 
discussed life expectancy (30%); or discussed end of life wishes with family 
(30%). Among those who had not participated in ACP, most were willing to discuss 
life expectancy (66%); discuss end of life wishes with family (57%) and a doctor 
(55%); and formally record wishes (56%) in the next month. Fewer wanted to 
appoint a SDM (40%).
CONCLUSION: Although medical oncology outpatients perceive ACP activities are 
important, rates of uptake are relatively low. The willingness of many patients 
to engage in ACP activities suggests a gap in current ACP practice. Efforts 
should focus on ensuring patients and families have clarity about the legal and 
other ramifications of ACP activities, and better education and training of 
health care providers in initiating conversations about end of life issues.

Animals respond to mitochondrial stress with the induction of mitochondrial 
unfolded protein response (UPRmt). A cascade of events occur upon UPRmt 
activation, ultimately triggering a transcriptional response governed by two 
transcription factors: DVE-1 and ATFS-1. Here we identify SUMO-specific 
peptidase ULP-4 as a positive regulator of C. elegans UPRmt to control 
SUMOylation status of DVE-1 and ATFS-1. SUMOylation affects these two axes in 
the transcriptional program of UPRmt with distinct mechanisms: change of DVE-1 
subcellular localization vs. change of ATFS-1 stability and activity. Our 
findings reveal a post-translational modification that promotes immune response 
and lifespan extension during mitochondrial stress.

INTRODUCTION: In the KEYNOTE-024 trial, pembrolizumab demonstrated significant 
improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) versus 
Standard-of-Care (SoC) platinum-based doublets for first-line treatment of PD-L1 
-positive (≥50%) metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients with no 
EGFR mutations or ALK translocations. This study aims to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus SoC platinum-based chemotherapy from 
the French healthcare system perspective.
METHODS: A three-state partitioned-survival model was adapted to project 
outcomes and costs of squamous and non-squamous NSCLC patients respectively, 
over a 10-year time horizon. Clinical and utility data were collected from the 
trial. A network meta-analysis was performed to consider platinum-based triplets 
also used for non-squamous NSCLC. Direct medical costs were considered based on 
ressources identified from the trial and literature. Costs and outcomes were 
discounted at 4% per year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
calculated as cost per Life Year (LY) and cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year 
(QALY). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to assess the 
robustness of results.
RESULTS: For squamous NSCLC, pembrolizumab was projected to increase life 
expectancy of patients by 0.93 LY (11 months), and 0.74 QALY (9 months) for an 
incremental cost of €62,032 compared with platinum-based doublets. The ICER of 
pembrolizumab versus platinum-based doublets was €66,825/LY and €84,097/QALY. 
For non-squamous NSCLC, pembrolizumab was projected to increase life expectancy 
of patients by 0.85-1.32 LYs (10.2-15.8 months) and 0.64-1.02 QALYs (7.7-12.2 
months) for an incremental cost varying from €-14,947-+47,064 depending on the 
specific comparator. The ICER of pembrolizumab versus platinum-based 
chemotherapy with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab was €62,846/LY and €78,729/QALY; 
regimens including pemetrexed were dominated. Results were most sensitive to 
extrapolations of survival outcomes and assumptions for continued effectiveness 
and treatment duration of pembrolizumab.
CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab appears cost-effective versus SoC chemotherapy for 
first-line treatment of PD-L1-positive (50%) metastatic NSCLC patients in 
France, assuming willingness-to-pay under 100,000€/QALY (OECD threshold in the 
discussion section).

PURPOSE: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) of the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) are becoming the standard treatments for Chinese patients with 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an EGFR mutation. However, 
the economic impact is unclear yet in China.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to simulate 
1-month patient transitions in a 10-year time horizon from Chinese heath care 
system perspective. The health and economic outcomes of four first-line 
strategies (pemetrexed plus cisplatin [PC], gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib) 
among NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations were estimated and assessed via 
indirect comparisons. Costs in the Chinese setting were estimated by using local 
hospital data and literatures. A 5% annual discount rate was applied to both 
costs and outcomes. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Afatinib achieved additional 0.382, 0.216 and 0.174 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) with marginal $7930, $3680 and $2818 costs in comparison with 
PC, gefitinib and erlotinib, which resulted in the ICERs of $20,758, $17,693 and 
$16,197 per QALY gained, respectively. The hazard ratios (HR) of overall 
survival (OS) of afatinib against gefitinib, erlotinib and PC strategy had 
substantial influential parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: First-line afatinib is cost-effective compared with gefitinib, 
erlotinib and PC treatment for Chinese patients with EGFR mutation-positive 
NSCLC.

Aim of the paper is to quantify effects of socioeconomic factors on Alzheimer's 
Disease Mortality in the Slovak Republic. We applied potential gains in life 
expectancy (PGLE) method to measure the impact of elimination of Alzheimer's 
disease on life expectance in Slovak regions. PGLE is based on life table 
adjustment according to elimination of mortality caused by specific diagnosis. 
Our dataset consists of all deceased from Slovak Republic from 2001 to 2015. We 
analyse the impact of unemployment rate, GDP per capita, average wage, and 
education on life expectance in Slovak regions. To estimate that impact, 
ordinary least squares (OLS) is applied. According to our model, gross domestic 
product, average wage, and education influence mortality caused by Alzheimer's 
disease.

AIM: The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in Canada is estimated to be 7.6% and 
rising. Given the substantial economic burden associated with Type 2 diabetes 
treatment, optimizing healthcare expenditure is extremely important. In the 
present analysis, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of dulaglutide 1.5 mg, a 
once-weekly glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist as third-line therapy relative to 
insulin glargine from the perspective of a Canadian healthcare payer.
METHODS: A patient-level cost-utility model of Type 2 diabetes was developed to 
capture seven microvascular and macrovascular complications and severe and 
nonsevere hypoglycemia. Cohort characteristics and the relative efficacy of 
dulaglutide 1.5 mg and insulin glargine were derived from the AWARD-2 
head-to-head trial, which was identified by systematic literature review. Cost 
data were derived from Canadian sources and expressed in 2016 Canadian dollars 
(CAD), and future cost and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) estimates 
were discounted at 1.5% per annum. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Based on the AWARD-2 trial, relative to insulin glargine, dulaglutide 
1.5 mg was projected to increase QALE by 0.38 quality-adjusted life years and 
increase costs by CAD 19,773, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of CAD 52,580 per quality-adjusted life year gained.
CONCLUSION: A computer simulation analysis showed that dulaglutide 1.5 mg would 
likely be cost-effective relative to insulin glargine in patients with Type 2 
diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and sulfonylurea in Canada.

Purpose To compare the effectiveness of personalized treatment for small (≤4 cm) 
renal tumors versus routine partial nephrectomy (PN), accounting for various 
competing causes of mortality. Materials and Methods A state-transition 
microsimulation model was constructed to compare life expectancy of management 
strategies for small renal tumors by using 1 000 000 simulations in the 
following ways: routine PN or personalized treatment involving percutaneous 
ablation for risk factors for worsening chronic kidney disease (CKD), and 
otherwise PN; biopsy, with triage of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to PN or 
ablation depending on risk factors for worsening CKD; active surveillance for 
growth; and active surveillance when MRI findings are indicative of papillary 
RCC. Transition probabilities were incorporated from the literature. Effects of 
parameter variability were assessed in sensitivity analysis. Results In patients 
of all ages with normal renal function, routine PN yielded the longest life 
expectancy (eg, 0.67 years in 65-year-old men with nephrometry score [NS] of 4). 
Otherwise, personalized strategies extended life expectancy versus routine PN: 
in CKD stages 2 or 3a, moderate or high NS, and no comorbidities, MRI guidance 
for active surveillance extended life expectancy (eg, 2.60 years for MRI vs PN 
in CKD 3a, NS 10); and with Charlson comorbidity index of 1 or more, biopsy or 
active surveillance for growth extended life expectancy (eg, 2.70 years for 
surveillance for growth in CKD 3a, NS 10). CKD 3b was most effectively managed 
by using MRI to help predict papillary RCC for surveillance. Conclusion For 
patients with chronic kidney disease and small renal tumors, personalized 
treatment selection likely extends life expectancy. © RSNA, 2019 Online

Three amino acid loop extension homeodomain transcription factors (TALE HD TFs) 
act as life cycle regulators in green algae and land plants. In mosses these 
regulators are required for the deployment of the sporophyte developmental 
program. We demonstrate that mutations in either of two TALE HD TF genes, 
OUROBOROS or SAMSARA, in the brown alga Ectocarpus result in conversion of the 
sporophyte generation into a gametophyte. The OUROBOROS and SAMSARA proteins 
heterodimerise in a similar manner to TALE HD TF life cycle regulators in the 
green lineage. These observations demonstrate that TALE-HD-TF-based life cycle 
regulation systems have an extremely ancient origin, and that these systems have 
been independently recruited to regulate sporophyte developmental programs in at 
least two different complex multicellular eukaryotic supergroups, Archaeplastida 
and Chromalveolata.

BACKGROUND: The health economic evidence about the value and optimal targeting 
of genetic testing in the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) events has 
remained limited and ambiguous. The objective of this study is to optimize the 
population-level use and targeting of genetic testing alongside traditional risk 
factors in the prevention of CHD events and, thereby, to assess the cost-benefit 
of genetic testing.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We compare several strategies for using traditional and 
genetic testing in the prevention of CHD through statin therapy. The targeting 
of tests to different patient segments within these strategies is optimized by 
using a decision-analytic model, in which a patient's estimated risk of CHD is 
updated based on test results using Bayesian methods. We adopt the perspective 
of healthcare sector. The data for the model is exceptionally wide and combined 
from national healthcare registers, the Finnish Institute for Molecular 
Medicine, and published literature. Our results suggest that targeting genetic 
testing in an optimal way to those patients about which traditional risk factors 
do not provide sufficiently accurate information results in the highest expected 
net benefit. In particular, compared to the use of traditional risk factors 
only, the optimal use of genetic testing would decrease the expected costs of an 
average patient aged 45 years or more by 2.54€ in a 10-year follow-up period 
while maintaining the level of the expected health outcome. Thus, genetic 
testing is found to be a part of a cost-beneficial testing strategy alongside 
traditional risk factors. This conclusion is robust to reasonable changes in 
model inputs.
CONCLUSIONS: If targeted optimally, the use of genetic testing alongside 
traditional risk factors is cost-beneficial in the prevention of CHD.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKI) have near-normal life expectancy. However, lifelong TKI 
therapy is associated with reduced quality of life and significant economic 
burden. Currently, the management of CML is shifting from continuous TKI therapy 
towards the goal of TKI cessation which is discussed in this review.
RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies in the last decade have demonstrated the 
feasibility and safety of TKI discontinuation in selected patients with CML who 
achieve deep and sustained molecular response with TKI. This has moved 
prime-time into clinical practice although open questions remain in terms of 
understanding the disease biology that leads to successful TKI cessation in some 
patients while not in others. Cessation of TKI for CML patients is a feasible 
approach. Ongoing research aims to find out optimal strategies to sustain 
ongoing treatment-free remission (TFR) and increase the number of patients who 
achieve TFR.

University, Tempe, Arizona.

BACKGROUND: This study examined the extent to which the developmental pattern of 
prevalence of binge drinking in the past 2 weeks from ages 18 through 30 has 
changed across 29 cohorts of U.S. young adults, and whether the changes differed 
by gender.
METHODS: Analyses used national longitudinal data from 58,019 12th-grade 
students (from graduating high school classes 1976 to 2004) participating in the 
Monitoring the Future study followed through modal age 30 (with age 29/30 data 
collected from 1987 to 2016). Weighted time-varying effect modeling was used to 
model cohort group differences in age-related patterns of binge drinking.
RESULTS: The age of peak binge drinking prevalence increased across cohorts 
(from age 20 in 1976 to 1985 to 22 in 1996 to 2004 for women, and from 21 in 
1976 to 1985 to 23 in 1996 to 2004 for men). Historical change in the 
developmental pattern of binge drinking across all ages of young adulthood 
differed for men and women. Even after controlling for key covariates, women in 
the more recent cohort group reported significantly higher binge drinking 
prevalence than women in earlier cohorts from ages 21 through 30. Men in the 
more recent cohort group reported higher binge drinking prevalence at ages 25 to 
26, but prevalence levels then converged to those seen in earlier cohort groups 
by age 30.
CONCLUSIONS: An older age of peak binge drinking and a decreased rate of decline 
in the prevalence of binge drinking in later young adulthood among more recent 
cohorts have resulted in an extension of individual and societal risks 
associated with binge drinking, particularly for women, across young adulthood. 
High-risk alcohol use prevention efforts are needed throughout at least the 
third decade of life.

IMPORTANCE: Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is first-line treatment 
for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who cannot 
undergo surgery. However, up to 1 in 6 such patients will develop isolated local 
recurrence (iLR) or isolated regional recurrence (iRR). Little is known about 
outcomes when disease recurs after SABR, or about optimal management strategies 
for such recurrences.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize long-term outcomes for patients with iLR or iRR after 
SABR for early-stage NSCLC with the aim of informing treatment decision making 
for these patients with potentially curable disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, a retrospective review 
was conducted of 912 patients prospectively enrolled in an institutional 
database at a tertiary cancer center from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 
2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival, progression-free survival, 
recurrence patterns, demographics, salvage techniques, patterns of salvage 
failure, and toxic effects.
RESULTS: Of the 912 patients in the study (456 women and 456 men; median age, 72 
years [range, 46-91 years]), 756 (82.9%) had T1 tumors at initial diagnosis; 502 
tumors (55.0%) were adenocarcinomas and 309 tumors (33.9%) were squamous cell 
carcinomas. Of 912 patients with early-stage I to II NSCLC who received 
definitive SABR (50 Gy in 4 fractions or 70 Gy in 10 fractions), 102 developed 
isolated recurrence (49 with iLR and 53 with iRR), and 658 had no recurrence. 
Median times to recurrence after SABR were 14.5 months (range, 1.5-60.8 months) 
for iLR and 9.0 months (range, 1.9-70.7 months) for iRR; 39 of 49 patients 
(79.6%) with iLR and 48 of 53 patients (90.6%) with iRR underwent salvage with 
reirradiation, surgery, thermal ablation, or chemotherapy. Median follow-up 
times for patients with iLR or iRR were 57.2 months (interquartile range, 
37.7-87.6 months) from initial SABR and 38.5 months (interquartile range, 
19.9-69.3 months) from recurrence. Rates of overall survival at 5 years from 
initial SABR were no different between patients with iLR and salvage treatment 
(57.9%) and patients with no recurrence (54.9%; hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 
0.56-1.43; P = .65) but were lower for patients with iRR and salvage treatment 
(31.1%; hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.00-2.34; P = .049). Patients receiving 
salvage treatment had longer overall survival than patients who did not (median, 
37 vs 7 months after recurrence; hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.09-0.66; 
P = .006). Twenty-four of 87 patients (27.6%) who received salvage treatment for 
iLR or iRR subsequently developed distant metastases. No patient experienced 
grade 5 toxic effects after salvage treatment.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Life expectancy after salvage treatment for iLR was 
similar to that for patients without recurrence, but survival after salvage 
treatment for iRR was similar to that of patients with stage III NSCLC. Patients 
who received salvage treatment had significantly improved survival. Because 
salvage treatment for iLR or iRR was based on a consistent multidisciplinary 
approach, this may help in clinical decision making.

IMPORTANCE: Financial incentives shared between physicians and patients were 
shown to significantly reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels 
in a randomized clinical trial, but it is not known whether these health 
benefits are worth the added incentive and utilization costs required to achieve 
them.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of financial incentives 
on LDL-C level control.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this economic evaluation, a previously 
validated microsimulation computer model was parameterized using 
individual-level data from the randomized clinical trial on financial 
incentives, National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for model 
population inputs, and other published sources. The study was conducted from 
April 15, 2016, to March 29, 2018.
INTERVENTIONS: The following interventions were used: (1) usual care, (2) trial 
control strategy (increased cholesterol level monitoring and use of electronic 
pill bottles), (3) financial incentives for physicians, (4) financial incentives 
for patients, and (5) incentives shared between physicians and patients.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Discounted costs (2017 US dollars), lifetime 
cardiovascular disease risk, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: The model population (n = 1 000 000 [30.7% women]) had similar mean 
(SD) age (61.5 [11.9] years) and LDL-C level (153.9 mg/dL) as the observed trial 
population (n = 1503 [42.7% women]; age, 62.0 [8.7] years; and LDL-C level, 
160.6 mg/dL). Using base-case assumptions (including a 10-year waning period of 
LDL-C level reductions), the usual-care strategy was dominated (higher costs and 
lower QALYs) by all other strategies. Strategies for physician- or patient-only 
incentives were dominated by the shared-incentives strategy, which had an ICER 
of $60 000/QALY compared with the trial control strategy. In a sensitivity 
analysis regarding the duration of LDL-C level reductions, the shared-incentives 
strategy remained cost-effective (ICERs <$100 000/QALY and <$150 000/QALY) for 
scenarios with LDL-C level reductions lasting, with linear waning, at least 7 
and 5 years, respectively. In the 1-way sensitivity analysis for the time 
horizon of the analysis, the ICER of the shared-incentives strategy exceeded
