sensory properties. In the present work, lemongrass oil (LMO) microcapsules were 
prepared by the emulsification-separation method using sodium caseinate as wall 
material. Microcapsules had an average size of 22 μm and contained over 51 % oil 
in their nucleus. The release kinetics of the LMO components was studied for 
both, microcapsules and microcapsule containing films. Experimental data for the 
controlled release of LMO components showed good correlation with Peppas and 
Weibull models. The effect of the alginate matrix on the release parameters of 
the mathematical models could be detected by the modification of the b constant 
of the Weibull equation which changed from 0.167 for the microcapsules to 0.351 
for the films. Films containing LMO at concentrations of 1250, 2500 and 5000 ppm 
were able to inhibit growth of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Listeria 
monocytogenes ISP 65-08 in liquid cultures. A possible future application of 
these films for shelf life extension of fresh food is discussed.

Werner syndrome (WS) is a progeroid or premature aging syndrome characterized by 
early onset of age-related pathologies and cancer. The average life expectancy 
of affected people is 52.8 years and tends to increase. The major causes of 
death are malignancy and myocardial infarction. Increased telomere attrition and 
decay are thought to play a causative role in the clinical and pathological 
manifestations of the disease. Although telomere length, with or without 
germline mutation, is known to be associated with interstitial lung disease, the 
latter is not associated with WS. To the best of our knowledge, we report the 
first case describing a WS patient with fatal ILD. This case suggests that older 
patients with WS could develop ILD. Clinical outcome of WS patients may thus be 
improved by counselling them regarding smoking cessation or other exposure and 
by proposing antifibrotic therapy.

BACKGROUND: Bloom syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
extraordinary cancer incidence early in life and an average life expectancy of 
~27 years. Premature stop codons in BLM, which encodes a DNA helicase that 
functions in DNA double-strand-break repair, make up the vast majority of Bloom 
syndrome mutations, with only 13 single amino acid changes identified in the 
syndrome. Sequencing projects have identified nearly one hundred single 
nucleotide variants in BLM that cause amino acid changes of uncertain 
significance.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, in addition to identifying five BLM variants 
incapable of complementing certain defects of Bloom syndrome cells, making them 
candidates for new Bloom syndrome causing mutations, we characterize a new class 
of BLM variants that cause some, but not all, cellular defects of Bloom 
syndrome. We find elevated sister-chromatid exchanges, a delayed DNA damage 
response and inefficient DNA repair. Conversely, hydroxyurea sensitivity and 
quadriradial chromosome accumulation, both characteristic of Bloom syndrome 
cells, are absent. These intermediate variants affect sites in BLM that function 
in ATP hydrolysis and in contacting double-stranded DNA.
CONCLUSION: Allele frequency and cellular defects suggest candidates for new 
Bloom syndrome causing mutations, and intermediate BLM variants that are 
hypomorphic which, instead of causing Bloom syndrome, may increase a person's 
risk for cancer or possibly other Bloom-syndrome-associated disorders, such as 
type-2 diabetes.

patient in Turkey.

Medicine , Turkey.

A 49-year-old woman was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C 7 years ago. She 
began haemodialysis at the same time. She was on the waiting list for kidney 
transplantation (KTx). The real-time PCR technique revealed an HCV RNA viral 
load of 212,000 IU/ml, genotype 1a, IL28B the rs12979860 minor allele 
heterozygous CT (rs8099917 TT homozygous). She had a history of first antiviral 
treatment for 48 weeks of PEG-IFN-alpha 2a, 135 μg/week in 2011, but the HCV 
infection relapsed. Considering her relatively young age, candidacy for renal 
transplant, and the heterozygous pattern of IL28B, we decided to proceed with a 
second (and last) antiviral treatment using triple therapy with telaprevir at 
the regular dose of 750 mg every 8 hours+PEG-IFN-alpha 2a 135 μg/week sc+200 mg 
RBV three times a week. At the end of 6-month therapy, HCV RNA was found to be 
negative at months 3, 5, and 6.The patient has reached the sustained virological 
response (SVR) and is ready for KTx. All renal transplant candidates 
(dialysis-dependent, or not) with HCV should be assessed for antiviral treatment 
given the increased risk of progressive liver disease due to immunosuppressive 
therapy, increased life expectancy compared to other HCV-positive patients on 
dialysis, and the inability to receive interferon after transplantation.

Two species of parasitic copepods from the genus Bomolochus von Nordmann, 1832 
(Cyclopoida: Bomolochidae) are redescribed in detail, based on material 
collected from the gills of Red Sea fishes. Host material was caught at El-tor, 
near Sharm El-Sheikh, and in the Gulf of Suez, Egypt. Both sexes of Bomolochus 
bellones Burmeister, 1835 were collected from the gills of a needlefish 
Tylosurus choram (Rüppell) caught in the Gulf of Suez. This is a new host 
record. The female is well characterised so only the male is described. Adult 
females of Bomolochus minus Lin & Ho, 2005 were obtained from the branchial 
cavities and gills of mojarra Gerres oyena (Forsskål). This species was known 
only from its original description in Taiwan, and this report constitutes a new 
host record and a significant range extension. Both parasite species are new 
records for Egyptian Red Sea waters.

University, Suwon 440-746, Korea.

Biodemographic analysis would be essential to understand population ecology and 
aging of tyrannosaurs. Here we address a methodology that quantifies tyrannosaur 
survival and mortality curves by utilizing modified stretched exponential 
survival functions. Our analysis clearly shows that mortality patterns for 
tyrannosaurs are seemingly analogous to those for 18th-century humans. This 
result suggests that tyrannosaurs would live long to undergo aging before 
maximum lifespans, while their longevity strategy is more alike to big birds 
rather than 18th-century humans.

BACKGROUND: Ischemic strokes result in significant healthcare expenditures 
(direct costs) and loss of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (indirect costs). 
Interventional therapy has demonstrated improved functional outcomes in patients 
with large vessel occlusions (LVOs), which are likely to reduce the economic 
burden of strokes.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a novel real-world dollar model to assess the direct and 
indirect cost-benefit of mechanical embolectomy compared with medical treatment 
with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) based on shifts in 
modified Rankin scores (mRS).
METHOD: A cost model was developed including multiple parameters to account for 
both direct and indirect stroke costs. These were adjusted based upon functional 
outcome (mRS). The model compared IV tPA with mechanical embolectomy to assess 
the costs and benefits of both therapies. Direct stroke-related costs included 
hospitalization, inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation, home care, skilled 
nursing facilities, and long-term care facility costs. Indirect costs included 
years of life expectancy lost and lost QALYs. Values for the model cost 
parameters were derived from numerous resources and functional outcomes were 
derived from the MR CLEAN study as a reflective sample of LVOs. Direct and 
indirect costs and benefits for the two treatments were assessed using Microsoft 
Excel 2013.
RESULTS: This cost-benefit model found a cost-benefit of mechanical embolectomy 
over IV tPA of $163 624.27 per patient and the cost benefit for 50 000 patients 
on an annual basis is $8 181 213 653.77.
CONCLUSIONS: If applied widely within the USA, mechanical embolectomy will 
significantly reduce the direct and indirect financial burden of stroke ($8 
billion/50 000 patients).

BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with adverse outcomes and increased costs 
after total knee arthroplasty. Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for 
morbid obesity, but its cost-effectiveness for weight loss prior to total knee 
arthroplasty is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery prior to total knee arthroplasty for 
patients in whom medical treatment of obesity and knee osteoarthritis had 
failed.
METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was constructed to compare the 
cost-utility of two treatment protocols for patients with morbid obesity and 
end-stage knee osteoarthritis: (1) immediate total knee arthroplasty and (2) 
bariatric surgery two years prior to the total knee arthroplasty. The 
probability of transition for each health state and its utility were derived 
from the literature. Costs, expressed in 2012 United States dollars, were 
estimated with use of administrative and claims data. Costs and utilities were 
discounted at 3% annually, and effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). The principal outcome measure was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed, using $100,000 per QALY as the threshold willingness to 
pay.
RESULTS: Morbidly obese patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty alone had 
lower QALYs gained than patients who underwent bariatric surgery two years prior 
to the total knee arthroplasty. The ICER between these two procedures was 
approximately $13,910 per QALY, well below the threshold willingness to pay. 
Results were stable across broad value ranges for independent variables. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that the median ICER was $14,023 per 
QALY (95% confidence interval, $4875 to $51,210 per QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: This model supports bariatric surgery prior to total knee 
arthroplasty as a cost-effective option for improving outcomes in morbidly obese 
patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis who are indicated for total knee 
arthroplasty.

Pulmonary Arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic and progressive disease 
characterized by an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance due to severe 
remodeling of the small pulmonary arteries. In PAH, the endothelial cells fail 
to maintain their homeostatic balance, with the consequent impaired production 
of vasodilators and over-expression of vasoconstrictors and proliferators. 
Current treatment of PAH is based on the discovery of three main pathways of 
endothelial dysfunction (prostacyclin, nitric oxide and endothelin-1), and 
includes drugs such as prostacyclin analogs, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and 
endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs). Recently approved drugs that act through 
these classic pathways include riociguat (cyclic GMP stimulator) and macitentan 
(a tissue specific dual ERA). However, several new drugs and new pathways are 
under study. New targeted therapies include tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Rho 
kinase inhibitors and serotonin receptor blockers. There are now ten drugs 
approved for the treatment of PAH that, alone or in combination, have changed 
the natural history of this disease. The new drugs will allow us to further 
modified the patients' life expectancy and move towards a cure.

Due to improved health care, diet and infrastructure in developed countries, 
since 1840 life expectancy has increased by approximately 2 years per decade. 
Accordingly, by 2050, a quarter of Europe's population will be over 65 years, 
representing a 10 % rise in half a century. With this rapid rise comes an 
increased prevalence of diseases of ageing and associated healthcare 
expenditure. To address the health consequences of global ageing, research in 
model systems (worms, flies and mice) has indicated that reducing the rate of 
organ growth, via reductions in protein synthetic rates, has multi-organ health 
benefits that collectively lead to improvements in lifespan. In contrast, human 
pre-clinical, clinical and large cohort prospective studies demonstrate that 
ageing leads to anabolic (i.e. growth) impairments in skeletal muscle, which in 
turn leads to reductions in muscle mass and strength, factors directly 
associated with mortality rates in the elderly. As such, increasing muscle 
protein synthesis via exercise or protein-based nutrition maintains a strong, 
healthy muscle mass, which in turn leads to improved health, independence and 
functionality. The aim of this review is to critique current literature relating 
to the maintenance of muscle mass across lifespan and discuss whether 
maintaining or reducing protein synthesis is the most logical approach to 
support musculoskeletal function and by extension healthy human ageing.

BACKGROUND: Long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as the intrauterine 
device (IUD), remain underutilised in Pakistan with high discontinuation rates. 
Based on a 24-month prospective client follow-up (nested within a larger 
quasi-experimental study), this paper presents the comparison of two 
intervention models, one using private mid-level providers branded as "Suraj" 
and the other using community midwives (CMWs) of Maternal Newborn and Child 
Health Programme, for method continuation among IUD users. Moreover, 
determinants of IUD continuation and the reasons for discontinuation, and 
switching behaviour were studied within each arm.
METHODS: A total of 1,163 IUD users, 824 from Suraj and 339 from the CMW model, 
were enrolled in this 24-month prospective client follow-up. Participants were 
followed-up by female community mobilisers physically every second month to 
ascertain continued IUD usage and to collect information on associated factors, 
switching behaviour, reasons for discontinuation, and pregnancy occurrence. The 
probabilities of IUD continuation and the risk factors for discontinuation were 
estimated by life table analysis and Cox proportional-hazard techniques, 
respectively.
RESULTS: The cumulative probabilities of IUD continuation at 24 months in Suraj 
and CMW models were 82% and 80%, respectively. The difference between the two 
intervention areas was not significant. The probability distributions of IUD 
continuation were also similar in both interventions (Log rank test: 
χ(2) = 0.06, df = 1, P = 0.81; Breslow test: χ(2) = 0.6, df = 1, P = 0.44). 
Health concerns (Suraj = 57.1%, CMW = 38.7%) and pregnancy desire 
(Suraj = 29.3%, CMW = 40.3%) were reported as the most prominent reasons for IUD 
discontinuation in both intervention arms. IUD discontinuation was significantly 
associated with place of residence in Suraj and with age (15-25 years) in the 
CMW model.
CONCLUSION: CMWs and private providers are equally capable of providing quality 
IUD services and ensuring higher method continuation. Pakistan's National 
Maternal Newborn and Child Health programme should consider training CMWs and 
providing IUDs through them. Moreover, private sector mid-level providers could 
be engaged in promoting the use of IUDs.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained 
by total joint arthroplasty (TJA), and assess the QALYs attributed to specific 
postoperative rehabilitation interventions.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of 2 multicenter, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
with 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up.
SETTING: Two university hospitals, 2 municipal hospitals, and 1 rural hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=827) who underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA) or 
total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
INTERVENTIONS: RCT A: 465 patients were randomly assigned to receive aquatic 
therapy (pool exercises aimed at training of proprioception, coordination, and 
strengthening) 6 versus 14 days after THA or TKA.
RCT B: 362 patients were randomly assigned to either perform or not perform 
ergometer cycling beginning 2 weeks after THA or TKA.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: QALYs, based on the Short Form-6 Dimensions utility, 
measured at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months' follow-up.
RESULTS: After hip arthroplasty, the lifetime QALYs increased by 2.35 years in 
the nonergometer group, and by 2.30 years in the early aquatic therapy group. 
However, after knee arthroplasty, the lifetime QALYs increased by 1.81 years in 
the nonergometer group, and by 1.60 years in the early aquatic therapy group. By 
ergometer cycling, .55 additional QALYs could be gained after hip and .10 
additional QALYs after knee arthroplasty, while the additional QALYs attributed 
to the timing of aquatic therapy were .12 years after hip and .01 years after 
knee arthroplasty.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides a sound estimate for the determination of 
the lifetime QALYs gained by THA and TKA. In addition, this analysis 
demonstrates that specific postoperative rehabilitation can result in an 
additional mean QALY gain of .55 years, which represents one fourth of the 
effect of surgery. Even if this is interpreted as a small effect at an 
individual level, it is important when extrapolated to all patients undergoing 
TJA. At a national level, these improvements appear to have a similar magnitude 
of QALY gain when compared with published data regarding medications to lower 
blood pressure in all persons with arterial hypertension.

OBJECTIVES: The use of bilateral internal thoracic arteries (BITAs) is 
associated with improved long-term survival after coronary artery bypass 
grafting (CABG). However, it is unclear whether the addition of a radial artery 
(RA) in patients already receiving BITA confers any additional survival benefit 
over that of a saphenous vein (SV). As such, we reviewed our multicentre 
experience and compared both strategies.
METHODS: From 1995 to 2010, 1497 patients underwent primary isolated CABG for 
three-vessel coronary disease using BITAs. An SV was used as a third conduit in 
460 (31%) patients and an RA in 1037 (69%). A total of 1258 distal anastomoses 
were performed using RAs and these were to the diagonal territory in 169, the 
circumflex in 454 and the right coronary in 635. Survival data were obtained 
using the National Death Index and propensity-score matching was used for 
risk-adjustment.
RESULTS: The overall cohort was young (mean age 61 ± 9 years). Patients 
receiving RAs were more likely to be younger, and were less likely to have 
experienced a prior myocardial infarction. At 30 days, mortality was similar 
(BITA + SV: 5, 1.1% vs BITA + RA: 9, 0.9%, P = 0.77). At 15 years, BITA + RA 
patients experienced improved unadjusted survival (BITA + SV: 67 ± 4.6% vs BITA 
+ RA: 82 ± 3.2%, P < 0.0001). Multivariable Cox regression in the entire cohort 
also showed the BITA + RA group to be associated with better survival (HR 0.58, 
95% CI 0.44-0.75, P < 0.001). After propensity-score matching of 262 
patient-pairs, BITA + RA experienced similar 30-day mortality (BITA + SV: 3, 
1.1% vs BITA + RA: 3, 1.1%, P > 0.99). However, at 15 years, BITA + RA patients 
experienced improved risk-adjusted survival (BITA + SV: 72 ± 6.0% vs BITA + RA: 
82 ± 5.2%, P = 0.021). The RA was associated with better risk-adjusted survival 
for grafting of the right coronary and its branches (148 matched pairs; SV-RCA: 
74 ± 7.8% vs RA-RCA: 86 ± 6.5%, P = 0.0046 at 15 years).
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of an RA graft even in patients already receiving 
BITAs is associated with a survival benefit. In younger patients with a 
reasonable long-term life expectancy, surgeons should strive to achieve total 
arterial revascularization with BITAs and radial arteries.

Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been shown to markedly improve 
survival and quality of life in patients with end-stage heart failure. However, 
despite ongoing improvements in survival and quality of life, significant 
challenges still exist in the management of these patients, including a high 
rate of recurrent heart failure and rehospitalizations. Similar challenges exist 
in the non-LVAD heart failure population as well, and recent efforts to utilize 
remote hemodynamic monitoring techniques to improve outcomes have shown promise. 
No data currently exist demonstrating extension of this benefit into the LVAD 
population, although a theoretical benefit can be extrapolated. Herein we review 
current remote hemodynamic methods and potential applications towards LVAD 
patients.

Despite the frequency of stillbirths, the subsequent implications are overlooked 
and underappreciated. We present findings from comprehensive, systematic 
literature reviews, and new analyses of published and unpublished data, to 
establish the effect of stillbirth on parents, families, health-care providers, 
and societies worldwide. Data for direct costs of this event are sparse but 
suggest that a stillbirth needs more resources than a livebirth, both in the 
perinatal period and in additional surveillance during subsequent pregnancies. 
Indirect and intangible costs of stillbirth are extensive and are usually met by 
families alone. This issue is particularly onerous for those with few resources. 
Negative effects, particularly on parental mental health, might be moderated by 
empathic attitudes of care providers and tailored interventions. The value of 
the baby, as well as the associated costs for parents, families, care providers, 
communities, and society, should be considered to prevent stillbirths and reduce 
associated morbidity.

Measurement invariance (MI) is a property of measurement that is often 
implicitly assumed, but in many cases, not tested. When the assumption of MI is 
tested, it generally involves determining if the measurement holds 
longitudinally or cross-culturally. A growing literature shows that other 
groupings can, and should, be considered as well. Additionally, it is noted that 
the standard techniques for investigating MI have been focused almost 
exclusively on the case of 2 groups, with very little work on the case of more 
than 2 groups, even though the need for such techniques is apparent in many 
fields of research. This paper introduces and illustrates a model building 
technique to investigating MI for more than 2 groups. This technique is an 
extension of the already-existing hierarchy for testing MI introduced by 
Meredith (1993). An example using data on father involvement in 5 different 
groups of families of children with and without developmental disabilities from 
the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort dataset will be given. We 
show that without considering the possible differential functioning of the 
measurements on multiple developmental groups, the differences present between 
the groups in terms of the measurements may be obscured. This could lead to 
incorrect conclusions.

BACKGROUND: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the most severe form of peripheral 
artery occlusive disease and is characterized by high amputation, morbidity and 
mortality rates. Therefore, revascularization is the essential step in therapy 
for retention of the affected limb.
OBJECTIVES: Although for a long time bypass surgery represented the gold 
standard in the treatment of CLI, in recent years there has been a 
disproportionate increase of endovascular treatment despite the lack of 
level-data. In this review the indications and results of endovascular therapy 
of CLI are presented on the basis of published data.
METHODS: A literature search was carried out to identify publications that 
compared the results of endovascular and surgical therapy as well as 
observational studies about different endovascular techniques.
RESULTS: The BASIL study provided the highest quality data comparing 
endovascular and surgical treatment of CLI. The long-term data of the BASIL 
trial showed that apart from patients with a suitable vein and a life expectancy 
of more than 2 years, first line endovascular therapy is equivalent to surgical 
treatment. The equivalence could also be demonstrated in a meta-analysis 
comparing operative and endovascular treatment of CLI.
CONCLUSION: The CLI is a disease with high mortality and morbidity risks. Due to 
the comparable amputation-free survival times with lower complication rates in 
the published data, in most patients an endovascular first strategy in 
experienced centers can be justified.

PURPOSE: As life expectancy increases, oncologic outcome in elderly patients 75 
years old or older is a salient topic requiring further investigation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the records of 13,997 patients who underwent 
radical prostatectomy from 2006 to 2013. Known prognosticators were compared 
according to age at radical prostatectomy in 13,732 patients younger than 75 
years vs 265 patients 75 years old or older. Univariate and multivariate Cox 
regressions were used to estimate the impact of age on biochemical 
recurrence-free, metastasis-free, cancer specific and overall survival.
RESULTS: Median followup was 47.3 months. Compared to patients younger than 75 
years those 75 years old or older had a higher pathological Gleason score 
(p <0.001) and were more likely to harbor a nonorgan confined tumor (p <0.001), 
have a positive surgical margin (p = 0.004) and positive lymph nodes (p = 
0.028), and receive salvage androgen deprivation therapy (p = 0.002). Five-year 
biochemical recurrence-free, metastasis-free, cancer specific and overall 
survival rates were 64.2%, 84.7%, 98.4% and 91.3% in patients 75 years old or 
older, and 76.9%, 96.2%, 99.0% and 96.2%, respectively, in patients younger than 
75 years. On univariate and multivariate analysis age 75 years or greater was 
associated with worse biochemical recurrence-free and metastasis-free survival. 
Patients 75 years old or older were more likely to die of other causes than 
cancer. Nevertheless, noncancer related mortality was low.
CONCLUSIONS: Older patients who underwent radical prostatectomy had more 
advanced disease. Age itself is an independent predictor of worse biochemical 
recurrence-free and metastasis-free survival. Healthy and highly selected 
patients 75 years old or older in our sample showed good long-term overall 
survival. Therefore, older age in well selected men should not be a 
contraindication to radical prostatectomy, especially in patients harboring high 
risk disease.

Bioconjugates represent an emerging class of medicines, which offer therapeutic 
opportunities overtaking those of the individual components. Many novel 
bioconjugates have been explored in order to address various emerging medical 
needs. The last decade has witnessed the exponential growth of new 
site-selective bioconjugation techniques, however very few methods have made the 
way into human clinical trials. Here we discuss various applications of 
site-selective conjugation in biomedicines, including half-life extension, 
antibody-drug conjugates, conjugate vaccines, bispecific antibodies and cell 
therapy. The review is intended to highlight both the progress and challenges, 
and identify a potential roadmap to address the gap.

AIMS: Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive rats (W) has 
significant changes in bone metabolism. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate whether, the genetic predisposition, is sufficient to induce changes 
in the osteoblast differentiation and osteogenic markers in the BMSCs or in the 
femoral bone. For this we use young SHR rats without hypertension, but, with 
genetic predisposition in compared with young W.
MAIN METHODS: BMSCs were cultured in a proliferation medium (MEM) or osteogenic 
medium. Osteogenic differentiation was analyzed by proliferation, total protein, 
alkaline phosphatase, mineralization, and the mRNA expression of RUNX-2, 
β-cathenin, osterix, bone morphogenetic protein-2(BMP-2), osteocalcin (OCN), 
bone sialoprotein (BSP), collagen type I (Col I), and osteopontin (OPN).
KEY FINDINGS: Osteoblast differentiation in SHR BMSCs (SHRC) had an increased 
proliferation compared with W BMSCs (WC). After osteogenic induction, there was 
greater reduction in proliferation in SHR (SHROM) than in W, in the same 
condition (WOM). On day 7, although no significant difference in the ALP 
activity was observed between SHROM and WOM, poor mineralization and osteoblast 
differentiation was noted in SHROM. The Osterix and β-catenin are involved in 
the reduced osteoblast differentiation in SHROM. The decreased expression of 
osteoblast-associated proteins such as OCN, BSP, COL I and OPN revealed poor 
quality of extracellular matrix (ECM) in SHROM. In the femoral bone, the 
immunostaining of COL1, BALP, OPN and OCN in SHR was decreased compared with the 
W. TRAP-positive immunoreactions were observed in major extension in the SHR 
femur.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study is the first to compare osteoblast differentiation in 
vitro and femoral bone from SHR and W rats. Our results demonstrated that young 
SHR (4weeks old), without hypertension, but with genetic predisposition, had 
alterations in osteoblast differentiation of BMSCs and in the femoral bone when 
compared with their progenitor strain, W.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: There is limited information about the impact of type 1 
diabetes on life expectancy in a contemporary population. We examined the life 
expectancy of type 1 diabetic patients and explored the contribution of 
mortality at different ages and of different causes of death to years of life 
lost (YLL) compared with the general population.
METHODS: We derived mortality rates of Australians with type 1 diabetes listed 
on the National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS) between 1997 and 2010 
(n = 85,547) by linking the NDSS to the National Death Index. The Chiang method 
was used to estimate life expectancy and Arriaga's method was used to estimate 
the contributions of age-specific and cause-specific mortality to the YLL.
RESULTS: A total of 5,981 deaths were identified during the 902,136 person-years 
of follow up. Type 1 diabetic patients had an estimated life expectancy at birth 
of 68.6 years (95% CI 68.1, 69.1), which was 12.2 years (95% CI 11.8, 12.7) less 
than that in the general population. The improvement in life expectancy at birth 
in 2004-2010 compared with 1997-2003 was similar for both type 1 diabetic 
patients (men, 1.9 years [95% CI 0.4, 3.3]; women, 1.5 years [95% CI 0.0, 3.2]) 
and the general population (men, 2.2 years; women, 1.4 years). Deaths at age 
<60 years accounted for 60% of the YLL from type 1 diabetes for men and 45% for 
women. The major contribution to YLL was mortality from endocrine and metabolic 
disease at age 10-39 years (men, 39-59%; women, 35-50%) and from circulatory 
disease at age ≥40 years (men, 43-75%; women, 34-75%).
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Data from 1997 to 2010 showed that Australian type 1 
diabetic patients had an estimated loss in life expectancy at birth of 
12.2 years compared with the general population.

BACKGROUND: Hereditary angio-oedema (HAE) is manifested by repeated episodes of 
localised subcutaneous or sub-mucosal oedema. Symptoms are extremely variable in 
frequency, localisation, and severity. Atypical or mild clinical symptoms of the 
disease may lead to erroneous diagnosis, causing diagnostic delay. The goal of 
this study was to assess how diagnostic delay has changed over 33 years at a 
single referral centre.
METHODS: We analysed diagnostic delay and first symptoms of HAE in patients who 
were diagnosed at an immunology department between 1980 and 2013. Patient's 
records were analysed.
RESULTS: The median diagnostic delay in 77 HAE type 1 and 2 patients was seven 
(range, 0-42) years. The difference observed in diagnostic delay between 
probands (18 [0-42] years) and others (1 [0-37] year) was significant (p<0.001). 
Our data show a significant negative correlation between the length of 
diagnostic delay and the year of diagnosis in our group of patients (p=0.024). 
The median age of first symptoms among all HAE patients (N=64) was 17 (1-40) 
years. The first symptoms of HAE in 64 patients were analysed. Twenty-six 
patients had abdominal, seventeen peripheral, five facial, two urogenital, and 
three had laryngeal oedema as the first manifestation of the disease. The last 
death that was attributed to HAE was in 1977.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observations demonstrate improved awareness of HAE among 
physicians, as documented by the significant decrease in diagnostic delay. It is 
believed that earlier treatment will improve patient quality of life and life 
expectancy.
