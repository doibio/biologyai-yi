direct chemical sensing, etc. In this contribution, we summarize some recent 
development in optical waveguide spectroscopy using nanoporous thin films as the 
planar substrates that can guide the light just as well as bulk thin films. This 
is because the nanoporosity is at a spacial length-scale that is far below the 
wavelength of the guided light; hence, it does not lead to an enhanced 
scattering or additional losses of the optical guided modes. The pores have 
mainly two effects: they generate an enormous inner surface (up to a factor of 
100 higher than the mere geometric dimensions of the planar substrate) and they 
allow for the exchange of material and charges between the two sides of the 
solid thin film. We demonstrate this for several different scenarios including 
anodized aluminum oxide layers for the ultrasensitive determination of the 
refractive index of fluids, or the label-free detection of small analytes 
binding from the pore inner volume to receptors immobilized on the pore surface. 
Using a thin film of Ti metal for the anodization results in a nanotube array 
offering an even further enhanced inner surface and the possibility to apply 
electrical potentials via the resulting TiO2 semiconducting waveguide structure. 
Nanoporous substrates fabricated from SiNx thin films by colloid lithography, or 
made from SiO2 by e-beam lithography, will be presented as examples where the 
porosity is used to allow for the passage of ions in the case of tethered lipid 
bilayer membranes fused on top of the light-guiding layer, or the transport of 
protons through membranes used in fuel cell applications. The final example that 
we present concerns the replication of the nanopore structure by polymers in a 
process that leads to a nanorod array that is equally well suited to guide the 
light as the mold; however, it opens a totally new field for integrated optics 
formats for direct chemical and biomedical sensing with an extension to even 
molecularly imprinted structures. Graphical abstract.

Several studies indicate that prognosis for survival in Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy (DMD) has improved in recent decades. However, published evidence is 
inconclusive and some estimates may be obsolete due to improvements in standards 
of care, in particular the routine use of mechanical ventilatory support in 
advanced stages of the disease. In this systematic review and meta-analysis 
(PROSPERO identifier: CRD42019121800), we searched MEDLINE (through PubMed), 
CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for studies published from 
inception up until December 31, 2018, reporting results of life expectancy in 
DMD. We pooled median survival estimates from individual studies using the 
median of medians, and weighted median of medians, methods. Risk of bias was 
established with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results were stratified by 
ventilatory support and risk of bias. We identified 15 publications involving 
2662 patients from 12 countries from all inhabited continents except Africa. 
Median life expectancy without ventilatory support ranged between 14.4 and 
27.0 years (pooled median: 19.0 years, 95% CI 18.0-20.9; weighted pooled median: 
19.4 years, 18.2-20.1). Median life expectancy with ventilatory support, 
introduced in most settings in the 1990s, ranged between 21.0 and 39.6 years 
(pooled median: 29.9 years, 26.5-30.8; weighted pooled median: 31.8 years, 
29.3-36.2). Risk of bias had little impact on pooled results. In conclusion, 
median life expectancy at birth in DMD seems to have improved considerably 
during the last decades. With current standards of care, many patients with DMD 
can now expect to live into their fourth decade of life.

Outcomes in economic evaluations, such as health utilities and costs, are 
products of multiple variables, often requiring complete item responses to 
questionnaires. Therefore, missing data are very common in cost-effectiveness 
analyses. Multiple imputations (MI) are predominately recommended and could be 
made either for individual items or at the aggregate level. We, therefore, aimed 
to assess the precision of both MI approaches (the item imputation vs. aggregate 
imputation) on the cost-effectiveness results. The original data set came from a 
cluster-randomized, controlled trial and was used to describe the missing data 
pattern and compare the differences in the cost-effectiveness results between 
the two imputation approaches. A simulation study with different missing data 
scenarios generated based on a complete data set was used to assess the 
precision of both imputation approaches. For health utility and cost, patients 
more often had a partial (9% vs. 23%, respectively) rather than complete missing 
(4% vs. 0%). The imputation approaches differed in the cost-effectiveness 
results (the item imputation: - 61,079€/QALY vs. the aggregate imputation: 
15,399€/QALY). Within the simulation study mean relative bias (< 5% vs. < 10%) 
and range of bias (< 38% vs. < 83%) to the true incremental cost and incremental 
QALYs were lower for the item imputation compared to the aggregate imputation. 
Even when 40% of data were missing, relative bias to true cost-effectiveness 
curves was less than 16% using the item imputation, but up to 39% for the 
aggregate imputation. Thus, the imputation strategies could have a significant 
impact on the cost-effectiveness conclusions when more than 20% of data are 
missing. The item imputation approach has better precision than the imputation 
at the aggregate level.

AIMS: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy reduces mortality in 
patients with heart failure and current guidelines advise implantation of ICDs 
in patients with a life expectancy of >1 year. We examined trends in all-cause 
mortality in patients who underwent primary or secondary prevention ICD 
placement in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health System.
METHODS AND RESULTS: US veterans receiving a new ICD placement for primary or 
secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death between January 2007 and January 
2015, who had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) were included 
in the analysis. We assessed all-cause mortality 1 year post-ICD implantation. 
ICD implantation and HFrEF diagnosis were established with associated ICD-9 
codes. The VA death registry was utilized to identify mortality rates following 
ICD placement. Results were subsequently age-stratified. There were 17 901 
veterans with HFrEF with ICD placement nationwide. There was no statistically 
significant difference in 1-year mortality from 2007 (13.1%) to 2014 (13.4%, 
P > 0.05). There was a significant increase in 1-year mortality in patients in 
the oldest age quartile (81.6 years, 32.3% mortality) compared to the youngest 
quartile (55.5 years, 7% mortality). The finding of diverging clinical outcomes 
extended to the 30-day but also 8-year mark.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest there is a high 1-year mortality in aging HFrEF 
patients undergoing primary and secondary prevention ICD placement. This 
highlights the importance of developing better predictive models for mortality 
in our ICD eligible patient population.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that the A1A2A3 domains of von 
Willebrand factor (VWF) play a key role in regulating macrophage-mediated 
clearance in vivo. In particular, the A1-domain has been shown to modulate 
interaction with macrophage low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 
(LRP1) clearance receptor. Furthermore, N-linked glycans within the A2-domain 
have been shown to protect VWF against premature LRP1-mediated clearance. 
Importantly, however, the specific regions within A1A2A3 that enable macrophage 
binding have not been defined.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To address this, we utilized site-directed PEGylation and 
introduced novel targeted N-linked glycosylation within A1A2A3-VWF and 
subsequently examined VWF clearance.
RESULTS: Conjugation with a 40-kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety 
significantly extended the half-life of A1A2A3-VWF in VWF-/- mice in a 
site-specific manner. For example, PEGylation at specific sites within the 
A1-domain (S1286) and A3-domain (V1803, S1807) attenuated VWF clearance in vivo, 
compared to wild-type A1A2A3-VWF. Furthermore, PEGylation at these specific 
sites ablated binding to differentiated THP-1 macrophages and LRP1 cluster II 
and cluster IV in-vitro. Conversely, PEGylation at other positions 
(Q1353-A1-domain and M1545-A2-domain) had limited effects on VWF clearance or 
binding to LRP1.Novel N-linked glycan chains were introduced at N1803 and N1807 
in the A3-domain. In contrast to PEGylation at these sites, no significant 
extension in half-life was observed with these N-glycan variants.
CONCLUSIONS: These novel data demonstrate that site specific PEGylation but not 
site specific N-glycosylation modifies LRP1-dependent uptake of the A1A2A3-VWF 
by macrophages. This suggests that PEGylation, within the A1- and A3-domains in 
particular, may be used to attenuate LRP1-mediated clearance of VWF.

BACKGROUND: In primary care, multiple priorities and system pressures make 
closing the gap between evidence and practice challenging. Most implementation 
studies focus on single conditions, limiting generalisability. We compared an 
adaptable implementation package against an implementation control and assessed 
effects on adherence to four different evidence-based quality indicators.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We undertook two parallel, pragmatic cluster-randomised 
trials using balanced incomplete block designs in general practices in West 
Yorkshire, England. We used 'opt-out' recruitment, and we randomly assigned 
practices that did not opt out to an implementation package targeting either 
diabetes control or risky prescribing (Trial 1); or blood pressure (BP) control 
or anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation (AF) (Trial 2). Within trials, each 
arm acted as the implementation control comparison for the other targeted 
indicator. For example, practices assigned to the diabetes control package acted 
as the comparison for practices assigned to the risky prescribing package. The 
implementation package embedded behaviour change techniques within audit and 
feedback, educational outreach, and computerised support, with content tailored 
to each indicator. Respective patient-level primary endpoints at 11 months 
comprised the following: achievement of all recommended levels of haemoglobin 
A1c (HbA1c), BP, and cholesterol; risky prescribing levels; achievement of 
recommended BP; and anticoagulation prescribing. Between February and March 
2015, we recruited 144 general practices collectively serving over 1 million 
patients. We stratified computer-generated randomisation by area, list size, and 
pre-intervention outcome achievement. In April 2015, we randomised 80 practices 
to Trial 1 (40 per arm) and 64 to Trial 2 (32 per arm). Practices and trial 
personnel were not blind to allocation. Two practices were lost to follow-up but 
provided some outcome data. We analysed the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, 
adjusted for potential confounders at patient level (sex, age) and practice 
level (list size, locality, pre-intervention achievement against primary 
outcomes, total quality scores, and levels of patient co-morbidity), and 
analysed cost-effectiveness. The implementation package reduced risky 
prescribing (odds ratio [OR] 0.82; 97.5% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.99, p = 
0.017) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £1,359 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY), but there was insufficient evidence of effect 
on other primary endpoints (diabetes control OR 1.03, 97.5% CI 0.89-1.18, p = 
0.693; BP control OR 1.05, 97.5% CI 0.96-1.16, p = 0.215; anticoagulation 
prescribing OR 0.90, 97.5% CI 0.75-1.09, p = 0.214). No statistically 
significant effects were observed in any secondary outcome except for reduced 
co-prescription of aspirin and clopidogrel without gastro-protection in patients 
aged 65 and over (adjusted OR 0.62; 97.5% CI 0.39-0.99; p = 0.021). Main study 
limitations concern our inability to make any inferences about the relative 
effects of individual intervention components, given the multifaceted nature of 
the implementation package, and that the composite endpoint for diabetes control 
may have been too challenging to achieve.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that a multifaceted implementation 
package was clinically and cost-effective for targeting prescribing behaviours 
within the control of clinicians but not for more complex behaviours that also 
required patient engagement.

Pulmonary hypertension is a complex, multifactorial disease that results in 
right heart failure and premature death. Since the initial reports of pulmonary 
hypertension in the late 1800s, the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension has 
evolved with respect to its definition, screening tools, and diagnostic 
techniques. This historical perspective traces the earliest roots of pulmonary 
hypertension detection and diagnosis through to the current recommendations for 
classification. We highlight the diagnostic tools used in the past and present, 
and end with a focus on the future directions of early detection. Early 
detection of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary arterial hypertension and the 
proper determination of etiology are vital for the early therapeutic 
intervention that can prolong life expectancy and improve quality of life. The 
search for a non-invasive screening tool for the identification and 
classification of pulmonary hypertension is ongoing, and we discuss the role of 
animal models of the disease in this search.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) comorbidities have become clinically more 
important due to antiretroviral therapy. Although therapy increases life 
expectancy, it does not completely suppress immune activation and its associated 
complications. The simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaque 
(Macaca mulatta) represents a valuable model for the investigation of 
SIV-associated diseases. Although cardiovascular (CV) changes are common in 
HIV-infected patients, there are only a few reports on the incidence of CV 
findings in SIV-infected animals. In addition, potential associations between 
pathohistological findings and hematological parameters are still unclear. We 
therefore conducted a retrospective analysis of 195 SIV-infected rhesus macaques 
that were euthanized with AIDS-related symptoms at the German Primate Center, 
Goettingen, over a 25-year period. Pathological findings were correlated with 
hematological data. The main findings included myocarditis (12.8 %), 
endocarditis (9.7 %), and arteriopathy (10.3 %) in various organs. 
Thrombocytopenia occurred more frequently in macaques with endocarditis or 
arteriopathy than in macaques without CV disease (80 % in animals with 
endocarditis, 60 % in animals with arteriopathy, p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0016 , 
respectively). Further investigations of the interaction between coagulation 
markers, proinflammatory cytokines, and biomarkers associated with endothelial 
dysfunction (e.g., D-dimers) and histological data (vascular wall structure) may 
unravel the mechanisms underlying HIV/SIV-associated CV comorbidities.

INTRODUCTION: Falls in older aged adults are an important public health problem. 
Insight into differences in fall-related injury rates between countries can 
serve as important input for identifying and evaluating prevention strategies. 
The objectives of this study were to compare Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 
estimates on incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due 
to fall-related injury in older adults across 22 countries in the Western 
European region and to examine changes over a 28-year period.
METHODS: We performed a secondary database descriptive study using the GBD 2017 
results on age-standardised fall-related injury in older adults aged 70 years 
and older in 22 countries from 1990 to 2017.
RESULTS: In 2017, in the Western European region, 13 840 per 100 000 
(uncertainty interval (UI) 11 837-16 113) older adults sought medical treatment 
for fall-related injury, ranging from 7594 per 100 000 (UI 6326-9032) in Greece 
to 19 796 per 100 000 (UI 15 536-24 233) in Norway. Since 1990, fall-related 
injury DALY rates showed little change for the whole region, but patterns varied 
widely between countries. Some countries (eg, Belgium and Netherlands) have lost 
their favourable positions due to an increasing fall-related injury burden of 
disease since 1990.
CONCLUSIONS: From 1990 to 2017, there was considerable variation in fall-related 
injury incidence, mortality, DALY rates and its composites in the 22 countries 
in the Western European region. It may be useful to assess which fall prevention 
measures have been taken in countries that showed continuous low or decreasing 
incidence, death and DALY rates despite ageing of the population.

Besides lifetime risks, we estimated life expectancy (LE), expected years of 
life lost (EYLL), lifetime costs, and cost-per-LY (life-year) stratified by 
different stages of esophageal cancer (EC). From the Taiwan Cancer Registry, we 
collected 14,420 EC to estimate the incidence rates during 2008-2014. They were 
followed to 2015 to obtain the survival function, which was extrapolated to 
lifetime by a semiparametric method. We abstracted the monthly healthcare 
expenditures from the reimbursement database of National Health Insurance, which 
were multiplied with the corresponding survival probabilities to quantify 
lifetime cost and cost-per-LY after adjustments. About 93.7% of patients were 
male; 90.8% had squamous cell carcinoma. Most patients were diagnosed at 
advanced stages, with 44.6% and 28.3% at stages III and IV. The lifetime risk of 
EC in males increased in Taiwan with a cumulative incidence rate (CIR30-84) of 
0.0146% (2008~2010) to 0.0165% (2013-2014). The EYLL for stages I-IV were 15.8, 
17.5, 20.5, and 22.5, while the average of cost-per-LY for stages I-IV were US$ 
6,987, $8,776, $12,153, and $22,426. EC in Taiwan appears to have shifted into 
younger ages groups and incidence is still increasing. Strategies for 
prevention, early diagnosis and treatment are warranted to improve the 
cost-effectiveness and control of this cancer.

Imatinib was the first BCR-ABL inhibitor used in clinical practice to treat 
chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and significantly improve the life expectancy of 
CML patients in the chronic phase. However, a portion of CML patients are 
resistant to imatinib. This study aimed to determine whether menadione (Vitamin 
K3) can improve imatinib efficacy in CML and to thoroughly explore the 
combination regimen mechanism between imatinib and menadione. Menadione improved 
imatinib efficacy in K562 cells by downregulating ABCB1 expression and increased 
the intracellular concentration of imatinib, which confirmed that this 
combination regimen is more effective than imatinib monotherapy. The results 
demonstrate that menadione and imatinib combination therapy may be a promising 
approach to refractory CML.

OBJECTIVES: BAY 81-8973 (Kovaltry® ), a full-length, unmodified, recombinant 
human factor VIII, provided excellent bleeding control for patients with 
haemophilia A in the pivotal 1-year LEOPOLD I trial. The LEOPOLD I extension 
evaluated long-term efficacy and safety of BAY 81-8973 prophylaxis.
METHODS: After completing LEOPOLD I, patients continued receiving 20-50 IU/kg 
BAY 81-8973 two- or three-times weekly in the extension. Outcomes included 
annualised bleeding rate (ABR) and haemostasis during surgery.
RESULTS: Fifty-five patients aged 12-65 years participated in the extension. 
Median (range) exposure days during the 2-year total study period was 309 
(115-355). No patient switched regimens. Median (Q1; Q3) ABR for all bleeds was 
2.0 (1.0; 6.1) during the pivotal study, 2.0 (0.0; 5.2) during the extension, 
and 2.0 (0.5; 5.5) combined. The proportion of joint bleeds affecting target 
joints decreased (pivotal study: 90.9%, extension: 60.0%). Haemostasis was 
assessed as excellent/good in all five major surgeries. One serious adverse 
event (myocardial infarction) occurred in a patient with cardiovascular risk 
factors. No patients developed inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: BAY 81-8973 prophylaxis efficacy outcomes in the pivotal study were 
maintained or, in the case of joint protection, improved during the extension, 
with a safety and tolerability profile consistent with previous experience.

BACKGROUND: Obstetric health care relies on an adequate antepartum risk 
selection. Most guidelines used for risk stratification, however, do not assess 
absolute risks. In 2017, a prediction tool was implemented in a Dutch region. 
This tool combines first trimester prediction models with obstetric care paths 
tailored to the individual risk profile, enabling risk-based care.
OBJECTIVE: To assess impact and cost-effectiveness of risk-based care compared 
to care-as-usual in a general population.
METHODS: A before-after study was conducted using 2 multicenter prospective 
cohorts. The first cohort (2013-2015) received care-as-usual; the second cohort 
(2017-2018) received risk-based care. Health outcomes were (1) a composite of 
adverse perinatal outcomes and (2) maternal quality-adjusted life-years. Costs 
were estimated using a health care perspective from conception to 6 weeks after 
the due date. Mean costs per woman, cost differences between the 2 groups, and 
incremental cost effectiveness ratios were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed to evaluate the robustness of the findings.
RESULTS: In total 3425 women were included. In nulliparous women there was a 
significant reduction of perinatal adverse outcomes among the risk-based care 
group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.94), but not 
in multiparous women. Mean costs per pregnant woman were significantly lower for 
risk-based care (mean difference, -€2766; 95% confidence interval, -€3700 to 
-€1825). No differences in maternal quality of life, adjusted for baseline 
health, were observed.
CONCLUSION: In the Netherlands, risk-based care in nulliparous women was 
associated with improved perinatal outcomes as compared to care-as-usual. 
Furthermore, risk-based care was cost-effective compared to care-as-usual and 
resulted in lower health care costs.

We previously reported endo-β-1,3-glucanase ENG in combination with 
β-glucosidase BGL2 at low concentration induced stipe cell wall extension. This 
study further explored ENG could be replaced by endo-β-1,3(4)-glucanase ENG16A 
in combination with BGL2 to induce stipe cell wall extension; similarly, BGL2 
could be replaced by β-glucosidase BGL1 to cooperate with ENG to induce stipe 
cell wall extension. However, ENG could not be replaced by exo-β-1,3-glucanase 
EXG in combination with BGL2 to induce stipe cell wall extension, although EXG 
alone released higher level of soluble sugars from the stipe cell walls during 
the reconstituted wall extension than that released from the stipe cell walls by 
a combination of ENG16A or ENG and BGL2 or BGL1, which was different from 
chitinase-mediated stipe cell wall extension. These results indicate 
endo-β-1,3-glucanases loosen the stipe cell wall, whereas exo-β-1,3-glucanases 
and β-glucosidases play a synergistic role to maintain a low and efficient 
concentration of endo-β-1,3-glucanases for stipe cell wall extension. 
Furthermore, ENG was expressed at a very high level in the matured pilei, in 
contrast, ENG16A was expressed at a very high level in the elongating apical 
stipe. Therefore, ENG16A might be involved in stipe elongation growth, while ENG 
might participate in autolysis of pilei.

BACKGROUND: cART has significantly improved the life expectancy of people living 
with HIV (PLWH). However, it fails to eliminate the long-lived reservoir of 
latent HIV-infected cells. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) relies on antigen-specific 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for targeted delivery of lethal doses of ionizing 
radiation to cells. Previously, we have demonstrated that human mAb 2556 against 
HIV gp41 conjugated with 213Bismuth radioisotope (t1/2 = 46 min, alpha-emitter) 
selectively killed HIV-infected cells. 225Actinium (t1/2 = 9.92 d, 
alpha-emitter) and 177Lutetium (t1/2 = 6.7 d, beta-emitter) are two long-lived 
clinically proven radioisotopes for cancer treatment which might be more 
effective in killing infected cells systemically and in CNS.
METHODS: In this study we have conjugated 2556 mAb with 213Bi, 225Ac and 177Lu, 
and compared their ability to kill HIV-infected human peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes. PBMCs and monocytes from healthy donors 
were infected with HIVp49.5 and treated in vitro with increasing concentrations 
of 213Bi (4-20 μCi)-, 225Ac (20-100 nCi)- and 177Lu (4-50 μCi)-2556 mAb.
RESULTS: After three days post-treatment of infected PBMCs and monocytes, 213Bi- 
and 177Lu-conjugated 2556 mAb reduced virus production measured by p24 level in 
a dose-dependent manner, whereas, 225Ac-2556 showed minimal effect. However, 
seven days post-treatment all three radioisotopes showed significantly more 
pronounced reduction of virus replication as compared to control labeled mAb 
with 225Ac-2556 showing the least non-specific killing.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that RIT holds promise as a novel treatment 
option for the eradication of HIV-infected cells that merits further study in 
combination with cART and reactivation drugs.

OBJECTIVES: Direct-acting antivirals containing nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) 
inhibitors administered over 8 to 12 weeks are effective in ∼95% of patients 
with hepatitis C virus. Nevertheless, patients resistant to NS5A inhibitors have 
lower cure rates over 8 weeks (<85%); for these patients, 12 weeks of treatment 
produces cure rates greater than 95%. We evaluated the lifetime 
cost-effectiveness of testing for NS5A resistance at baseline and optimizing 
treatment duration accordingly in genotype 1 noncirrhotic treatment-naïve 
patients from the perspective of the UK National Health Service.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model compared (1) standard 12-week treatment (no 
testing), (2) shortened 8-week treatment (no testing), and (3) baseline testing 
with 12-/8-week treatment for those with/without NS5A polymorphisms. Patients 
who failed first-line therapy were retreated for 12 weeks. Model inputs were 
derived from published studies. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and the 
probability of cost-effectiveness were calculated.
RESULTS: Baseline testing had an incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) of £11 
838 versus standard 12 weeks of therapy (no testing) and low probability (31%) 
of being the most cost-effective, assuming £30 000 willingness to pay. Shortened 
8 weeks of treatment (no testing) had an INMB of £12 294 and the highest 
probability (69%) of being most cost-effective. Scenario analyses showed 
baseline testing generally had the highest INMB and probability of being most 
cost-effective if first- and second-line drug prices were low (<£20k).
CONCLUSIONS: Optimizing treatment duration based on NS5A polymorphisms for 
genotype 1 noncirrhotic treatment-naive patients in the United Kingdom is not 
cost-effective if the drug costs are high; the strategy is generally most 
cost-effective when drug prices are low (<£20k).

BACKGROUND: A major debate in the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) literature 
concerns whose preferences should be used to estimate health state values (HSVs) 
and to calculate QALYs.
OBJECTIVES: This study explores differences between public and patient values 
for multiple sclerosis (MS) health states, described using an MS-specific 
classification system (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-8 Dimensions [MSIS-8D]).
METHODS: The MSIS-8D is an existing preference-based measure of health-related 
quality of life in MS, which has 2 tariffs of HSVs, based on the preferences of 
a representative sample of the UK general population (n = 1702) and of people 
with MS living in the United Kingdom (n = 1635), elicited using the time 
trade-off technique. Here, we explore differences between HSVs by sample type, 
using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression methods.
RESULTS: Overall, the survey of people with MS produced significantly higher 
HSVs; estimated values ranged from 0.079 to 0.883 for the general population 
survey and from 0.138 to 0.894 for the MS survey. Differences in HSVs were more 
pronounced for severe health states. The difference between patient and public 
values varied across the dimensions of the MSIS-8D. People with MS placed 
greater importance on cognition than the general population, leading to lower 
HSVs when impairment was at a worse level; the reverse was true for the daily 
activities, fatigue, and depression dimensions.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified significant differences in HSVs by sample type. Using 
patient rather than public values may influence the results of economic 
evaluations, depending on the dimensions of health-related quality of life 
affected by the intervention being assessed, and may therefore have important 
consequences for reimbursement decisions.
