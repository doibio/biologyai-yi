BACKGROUND: Our previous studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggested that 
glutamine broadly improves cellular readiness to respond to stress and acts as a 
neuroprotectant both in vitro and in AD mouse models. We now expand our studies 
to a second neurodegenerative disease, ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). Unlike AD, 
where clinically significant cognitive decline does not typically occur before 
age 65, A-T symptoms appear in early childhood and are caused exclusively by 
mutations in the ATM (A-T mutated) gene.
RESULTS: Genetically ATM-deficient mice and wild type littermates were 
maintained with or without 4 % glutamine in their drinking water for several 
weeks. In ATM mutants, glutamine supplementation restored serum glutamine and 
glucose levels and reduced body weight loss. Lost neurophysiological function 
assessed through the magnitude of hippocampal long term potentiation was 
significantly restored. Glutamine supplemented mice also showed reduced thymus 
pathology and, remarkably, a full one-third extension of lifespan. In vitro 
assays revealed that ATM-deficient cells are more sensitive to glutamine 
deprivation, while supra-molar glutamine (8 mM) partially rescued the reduction 
of BDNF expression and HDAC4 nuclear translocation of genetically mutant 
Atm(-/-) neurons. Analysis of microarray data suggested that glutamine 
metabolism is significantly altered in human A-T brains as well.
CONCLUSION: Glutamine is a powerful part of an organism's internal environment. 
Changes in its concentrations can have a huge impact on the function of all 
organ systems, especially the brain. Glutamine supplementation thus bears 
consideration as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human A-T and 
perhaps other neurodegenerative diseases.

AIM: To propose a method for estimating the lifetime advantage of statins.
METHODS: Kaplan-Meier survival curves from published 4S and LIPID studies with 
5.8- and 6.1-year follow-up were digitized. Gompertz distributions were fit up 
to the end of the trials, and then extrapolated out to the end of the patients' 
predicted lifetimes for each study.
RESULTS: The method results in a 9.9 (95% CI: 8.7-11.9) and 2.8 (95% CI: 
2.3-3.3) years' increases for the statin groups for 4S and LIPID studies, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Previous analysis of the same data was limited by the trials' 
relatively short run time. As such, we propose a method for correctly estimating 
the true effect of statin therapy in terms of total lifetime extension.

BACKGROUND: Historically, the survival of patients with von Hippel-Lindau 
disease (vHL) has been poorer than that of the general population. We aimed to 
determine whether the survival of VHL mutation carriers and their risk of 
vHL-related death has changed over time and how it has been affected by sex, 
genotype and surveillance attendance.
METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we included all known Danish vHL 
families with a VHL mutation. We assessed the survival and causes of death for 
143 VHL mutation carriers using Cox regression models and compared vHL survival 
with that of 137 siblings without vHL. vHL life expectancy was compared with the 
general population using a relative survival model.
RESULTS: The estimated mean life expectancies for male and female patients born 
in 2000 were 67 and 60 years, respectively. Survival is influenced by the sex 
and genotype of the patient. Female patients have a significantly higher risk of 
vHL-related death than male patients (HR=2.25, 95% CI 1.20 to 4.20, p=0.011). 
Overall, 79% (53 of 67) of deaths were vHL-related, but the risk of vHL-related 
death has decreased over time, as has the frequency of renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC)-related death. Surveillance is especially beneficial for truncating 
mutation carriers, who have the greatest RCC and central nervous system (CNS) 
hemangioblastoma risk.
CONCLUSIONS: vHL survival has improved over time and has become closer to that 
of siblings without vHL and the general population. Even though the risk of 
vHL-related death has decreased significantly, the main cause of death is still 
CNS hemangioblastomas and hence improved treatment options are essential.

OBJECTIVE: To understand the main influencing factors related to healthy life 
expectancy (HALE) among adults in Beijing.
METHODS: The calculation on health-adjusted life expectancy was performed by 
Sullivan METHODS. Data from the self-reported health survey program on adults in 
Beijing 2012 was gathered. Hierarchical ordered probit model was used to 
estimate the severity-weighted prevalence of disability and then combined with 
the period life table to obtain the HALE. Factors associated with the 
severity-adjusted prevalence of the disabled were analyzed under the generalized 
additive models (GAM).
RESULTS: The main influencing factors of HALE would include age (t=40.351, 
P<0.001), sex (t=9.689, P<0.001), levels of education (t=5.021, P< 0.001), 
exercise (t=5.487, P<0.001) and alcohol intake (t=-2.380, P=0.017) etc. The 
influence of per capita monthly income (χ(2) =3.949, P=0.044) showed as 
non-linear.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of income would directly influence the severity-weighted 
prevalence of the disability, which also affecting the HALE. Programs on 
improving healthy life style and health care in women should be promoted.

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has set the global goal 
of ending the AIDS world epidemic by 2030. In order to end this epidemic they 
have established a 90-90-90 goal to be achieved by 2020, which may be 
problematic, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This goal includes 
90% of individuals with HIV globally being diagnosed, on treatment, and 
virologically suppressed. Based on global estimates from 2014-2015, 
approximately 36.9 million individuals are living with HIV. Of those, 53% have 
been diagnosed with HIV, 41% are on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 32% have 
viral suppression with <1000 copies/ml. Comprehensive approaches are needed to 
improve the number of people living with HIV (PLWH) who are diagnosed, linked, 
and engaged in care. Once PLWH are retained in care, treatment is key to both 
HIV prevention and transmission. The development and advancement of new ART is 
necessary to assist in reaching these goals by improving safety profiles, 
decreasing pill burden, improving quality of life and life expectancy, and 
creating new mechanisms to overcome resistance. The focus of this review is to 
highlight and review data for antiretroviral agents recently added to the market 
as well as discuss agents in various stages of development (new formulations and 
mechanisms of action).

In the southeastern USA, catfish aquaculture is burdened by predation from 
piscivorous birds and the digenetic trematodes they carry. In addition to 
cultured ictalurid fish, other forage or incidental fish species inhabit catfish 
production ponds. Of these, the inland silverside Menidia beryllina was recently 
found to harbor larval metacercariae of several trematode species. Three species 
of metacercariae were reported, two of which represent the first morphological 
descriptions of an Austrodiplostomum sp. and Bolbophorus sp. metacercaria, 
respectively. A total of 15 silversides were collected from a commercial catfish 
pond and examined for trematode infection. These fish were parasitized by 
metacercariae of an Austrodiplostomum sp. (100 % prevalence) in the eyes and 
brain, a Bolbophorus sp. (86.7 % prevalence) in the musculature, and Clinostomum 
marginatum (33.3 % prevalence) in the musculature and fins. All three trematode 
species were characterized morphologically and molecularly by sequencing of the 
cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (CO1). In addition, the internal transcribed 
spacer 1 region (ITS1), 5.8S rRNA gene, and ITS2 region were determined for the 
Bolbophorus sp., which linked this metacercaria to a Bolbophorus sp. cercaria 
from a planorbid snail Planorbella trivolvis and an unnamed Bolbophorus sp. 
adult from the American white pelican Pelecanus erythrorhynchos. Furthermore, 
Biomphalaria havanensis snails were collected from the same pond and found 
actively shedding cercariae morphologically and molecularly consistent with a 
diplostomid cercaria reported from Bi . havanensis in catfish ponds in 
Mississippi, USA. Sequence comparisons deemed these cercariae conspecific to the 
Austrodiplostomum sp. from inland silverside described here. Channel catfish 
fingerlings were exposed to these cercariae at doses of 50 and 100 cercariae per 
fish. The infectivity of this Austrodiplostomum sp. in channel catfish was 
assessed at 10 and 20 days post exposure (dpe). Metacercariae were observed in 
both the eyes and brain of infected channel catfish, supporting molecular data 
that suggests the cercaria and metacercaria are both stages of a previously 
unidentified Austrodiplostomum sp. life cycle.

An update on adjuvant systemic therapy for elderly patients with early breast 
cancer.

(1)a Department of Medicine , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada.

INTRODUCTION: Elderly women with early breast cancer require an individualized 
approach to risk assessment and treatment. Unfortunately, there are limited data 
to inform optimal adjuvant therapy decisions in this population. Cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, biologic treatments and endocrine agents, while important in 
reducing breast cancer recurrence and mortality, are associated with the 
potential for adverse effects that may be of particular significance to elderly 
patients.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, we summarize the evidence for geriatric 
assessment in elderly patients with early breast cancer, outline special 
considerations for the use of chemotherapy and trastuzumab in older adults, and 
describe the age-specific risks of endocrine therapy in the adjuvant breast 
cancer setting.
EXPERT OPINION: The treatment of elderly women with early breast cancer should 
take into account cancer risk, life expectancy, comorbidities, functional 
status, physiologic changes, and patient values. Formal geriatric assessment may 
better inform treatment recommendations for individual patients. In general, 
there is no strong evidence to suggest that older women benefit less from 
standard adjuvant therapies than do their younger counterparts. When choosing 
between endocrine therapies, the differential risks associated with each agent 
should be considered and particular attention to the fracture risk on aromatase 
inhibitors (AIs) is warranted. Enrolment of women over 70 years of age into 
breast cancer clinical trials should be encouraged to better inform treatment 
guidelines.

experiment of the general public and biomedical and health researchers.

OBJECTIVES: (1) To test the use of best-worst scaling (BWS) experiments in 
valuing different types of biomedical and health research impact, and (2) to 
explore how different types of research impact are valued by different 
stakeholder groups.
DESIGN: Survey-based BWS experiment and discrete choice modelling.
SETTING: The UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Current and recent UK Medical Research Council grant holders and a 
representative sample of the general public recruited from an online panel.
RESULTS: In relation to the study's 2 objectives: (1) we demonstrate the 
application of BWS methodology in the quantitative assessment and valuation of 
research impact. (2) The general public and researchers provided similar 
valuations for research impacts such as improved life expectancy, job creation 
and reduced health costs, but there was less agreement between the groups on 
other impacts, including commercial capacity development, training and 
dissemination.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the second time that a discrete choice experiment has been 
used to assess how the general public and researchers value different types of 
research impact, and the first time that BWS has been used to elicit these 
choices. While the 2 groups value different research impacts in different ways, 
we note that where they agree, this is generally about matters that are 
seemingly more important and associated with wider social benefit, rather than 
impacts occurring within the research system. These findings are a first step in 
exploring how the beneficiaries and producers of research value different kinds 
of impact, an important consideration given the growing emphasis on funding and 
assessing research on the basis of (potential) impact. Future research should 
refine and replicate both the current study and that of Miller et al in other 
countries and disciplines.

BACKGROUND:  Diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection during 
early infancy (commonly known as "early infant HIV diagnosis" [EID]) followed by 
prompt initiation of antiretroviral therapy dramatically reduces mortality. EID 
testing is recommended at 6 weeks of age, but many infant infections are missed.
DESIGN/METHODS:  We simulated 4 EID testing strategies for HIV-exposed infants 
in South Africa: no EID (diagnosis only after illness; hereafter, "no EID"), 
testing once (at birth alone or at 6 weeks of age alone; hereafter, "birth 
alone" and "6 weeks alone," respectively), and testing twice (at birth and 6 
weeks of age; hereafter "birth and 6 weeks"). We calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), using discounted costs and life expectancies 
for all HIV-exposed (infected and uninfected) infants.
RESULTS:  In the base case (guideline-concordant care), the no EID strategy 
produced a life expectancy of 21.1 years (in the HIV-infected group) and 61.1 
years (in the HIV-exposed group); lifetime cost averaged $1430/HIV-exposed 
infant. The birth and 6 weeks strategy maximized life expectancy (26.5 years in 
the HIV-infected group and 61.4 years in the HIV-exposed group), costing 
$1840/infant tested. The ICER of the 6 weeks alone strategy versus the no EID 
strategy was $1250/year of life saved (19% of South Africa's per capita gross 
domestic product); the ICER for the birth and 6 weeks strategy versus the 6 
weeks alone strategy was $2900/year of life saved (45% of South Africa's per 
capita gross domestic product). Increasing the proportion of caregivers who 
receive test results and the linkage of HIV-positive infants to antiretroviral 
therapy with the 6 weeks alone strategy improved survival more than adding a 
second test.
CONCLUSIONS:  EID at birth and 6 weeks improves outcomes and is cost-effective, 
compared with EID at 6 weeks alone. If scale-up costs are comparable, programs 
should add birth testing after strengthening 6-week testing programs.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the risk of developing cancer in relation to the typical 
radiation doses received from a range of X-ray guided cardiac catheterisations 
in children, taking variable survival into account.
METHODS: Radiation doses were estimated for 2749 procedures undertaken at five 
UK hospitals using Monte Carlo simulations. The lifetime attributable risk (LAR) 
of cancer incidence was estimated using models developed by the Biological 
Effects of Ionising Radiation committee, based on both normal life expectancy, 
and as a function of attained age, from 20 to 80 years, to take reduced life 
expectancy into account.
RESULTS: The radiation-related risks from these procedures are dominated by lung 
and breast cancer (for females). Assuming normal life expectancy, central LAR 
estimates for cancer incidence, based on median doses, ranged from <1 in 2000 
for atrial septal defect occlusions to as high as 1 in 150 for valve 
replacements. For a reduced life expectancy of 50 years, estimated risks are 
lower by a factor of around 7. For conditions with especially poor survival (age 
20 years), such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, estimated cancer risks 
attributable to radiation were <1 in 20 000.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on recent UK radiation dose levels, the risk of cancer 
following cardiac catheterisations is relatively low and strongly modified by 
survival and the type of procedure. The risk of breast cancer, especially 
following pulmonary artery angioplasty and valve replacements, is the greatest 
concern.

Major depressive disorders (MDDs) are a widespread and burdensome mental illness 
associated with a high comorbidity with other conditions and a significantly 
reduced life expectancy compared to the general population. Therefore, targeted 
actions are needed to improve physical health in people with MDDs, in addition 
to ongoing efforts to enhance psychological well-being. Meanwhile, the positive 
effects of exercise training on the treatment of MDDs are well documented, while 
compelling evidence exists that exercise interventions can improve 
cardiorespiratory fitness in clinically meaningful ways. On the flipside, the 
long-term effects of exercise therapy are still not well documented, and recent 
studies suggest that initial improvements in MDDs dissipate if regular exercise 
participation is discontinued after the end of interventions. A recent survey 
among Swiss psychiatric hospitals further shows that all institutions provide 
some form of physical activity and exercise program. However, only a limited 
number of patients participate in these programs, mainly because participation 
is voluntary and no particular efforts are undertaken to engage patients with 
the lowest physical activity levels. We argue that more systematic efforts are 
needed to fully exploit the potential of physical activity and exercise programs 
in psychiatric care. We also emphasize that initiating and maintaining regular 
physical activity among psychiatric patients is a major challenge because 
specific dysfunctional cognitive-emotional processes might interfere with their 
capacity to self-regulate health-related behaviors. Specifically, we claim that 
behavioral skill training should be used to support patients with MDDs in 
overcoming barriers to initiating and maintaining physical activity. Moreover, 
we suggest that the assessment of physical activity and cardiorespiratory 
fitness should become routine in psychiatric practice.

Health care decision-making requires evidence of the cost-effectiveness of 
medical therapies. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of exercise-based cardiac 
rehabilitation (ECR) implemented according to guidelines. All the patients 
(n = 204) had experienced a recent acute coronary syndrome and were randomized 
to a 1-year ECR (n = 109) or usual care (UC) group (n = 95). The patients' 
health-related quality of life was followed using the 15D instrument and health 
care costs were collected from electronic health registries. The 
cost-effectiveness of ECR was estimated based on intervention and health care 
costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. The total average cost per 
patient was lower in ECR than in UC. The incremental cost was divided by the 
baseline-adjusted incremental QALYs (0.045), yielding an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of -€24511/QALYs. A combined endpoint of mortality, 
recurrent coronary event, or hospitalization for a heart failure occurred for 
five patients in ECR and 16 patients in UC (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.4-10.6, P = 0.004, 
relative risk reduction 73%, number needed to treat eight). ECR is a dominant 
treatment option and decreases the occurrence of adverse cardiac events. These 
results are useful for decision-making when planning optimal utilization of 
resources in Finnish health care.

BACKGROUND: India's High Level Expert Group on Universal Health Coverage in 2011 
recommended a universal, public-funded and national health coverage policy. As a 
plausible forward-looking macroeconomic reform in the health sector, this policy 
proposal on universal health coverage (UHC) needs to be evaluated for age 
structure transition effect and fiscal sustainability to strengthen its current 
design and future implementation.
OBJECTIVE: Macroeconomic analyses of the long-term implications of age structure 
transition and fiscal sustainability on India's proposed UHC policy.
METHODS: A new measure of age-specific UHC is developed by combining the age 
profile of public and private health consumption expenditure by using the 
National Transfer Accounts methodology. Different projections of age-specific 
public health expenditure are calculated over the period 2005-2100 to account 
for the age structure transition effect. The projections include changes in: (1) 
levels of the expenditure as gross domestic product grows, (2) levels and shape 
of the expenditure as gross domestic product grows and expenditure converges to 
that of developed countries (or convergence scenario) based on the Lee-Carter 
model of forecasting mortality rates, and (3) levels of the expenditure as India 
moves toward a UHC policy. Fiscal sustainability under each health expenditure 
projection is determined by using the measures of generational imbalance and 
sustainability gap in the Generational Accounting methodology.
RESULTS: Public health expenditure is marked by age specificities and the 
elderly population is costlier to support for their healthcare needs in the 
future. Given the discount and productivity growth rates, the proposed UHC is 
not fiscally sustainable under India's current fiscal policies except for the 
convergence scenario. However, if the income elasticity of public expenditure on 
social welfare and health expenditure is less than one, fiscal sustainability of 
the UHC policy is attainable in all scenarios of projected public health 
expenditures. These new results strengthen the proposed UHC policy by accounting 
for age structure transition effect and justifying its sustainability within the 
framework of India's current fiscal policies.
CONCLUSION: The age structure transition effect is important to incorporate the 
age-specific cost and benefit of the proposed UHC policy, especially as India 
moves toward an ageing society. Fiscal sustainability is essential to ensure 
that the proposed UHC is implementable on a long-term basis and within the 
framework of current fiscal policies.

A next generation nonavalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine ("HPV9 vaccine") 
is being introduced in several countries. The aims of this study were to 
evaluate whether cervical screening will remain cost-effective in cohorts 
offered nonavalent vaccines and if so, to characterize the optimal number of 
screening tests. We used a dynamic model of HPV vaccination and cervical 
screening to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies involving varying 
numbers of primary HPV tests per lifetime for cohorts offered the nonavalent 
vaccine as 12 year-olds. For each of four countries-the USA, New Zealand (NZ), 
Australia and England-we considered local factors including vaccine uptake rates 
(USA/NZ uptake ∼50%; Australia/England uptake >70%), attributable fractions of 
HPV9-included types, demographic factors, costs and indicative 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. Extensive probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis was performed. We found that, in the USA, four screens per lifetime was 
the most likely scenario, with 34% probability of being optimal at WTP 
US$50,000/LYS, increasing to 84% probability at US$100,000/LYS. In New Zealand, 
five screens per lifetime was the most likely scenario, with 100% probability of 
being optimal at NZ$42,000/LYS, given the assumptions used. In Australia, two 
screens per lifetime was the most likely scenario, with 62% probability of being 
optimal at AU$50,000/LYS. In England, four screens per lifetime was the most 
likely scenario, with 32% probability of being optimal at GB£20,000/LYS, 
increasing to 96% probability at GB£30,000/LYS. We conclude that some cervical 
screening will remain cost-effective, even in countries with high vaccination 
coverage. However, the optimal number of screens may vary between countries.

In recent decades, the management of sinonasal tumors abutting the orbit has 
been widely discussed. A real guideline has yet to be proposed, as prospective 
randomized studies on this topic are very difficult to organize, given the 
relative rarity of this pathology, the wide spectrum of histologic patterns, and 
the different clinical behavior of tumors. Nevertheless, in recent years, a 
better assessment of tumor extension has been obtained thanks to the refinement 
of preoperative imaging tools and, therefore, more conservative approaches could 
be adopted, with no worsening of the oncological outcomes and, at the same time, 
with more attention given to the post-surgical quality of life. Currently, 
tumors that extend to the bony orbital walls with or without focal infiltration 
of the periorbit are amenable to orbital preservation. On the other hand, 
infiltration of extraocular muscles and neurovascular structures are an 
indication to orbital exenteration. The ideal surgical treatment in cases of 
limited involvement of orbital fat still remains a matter of debate. We report 
and discuss the recent English literature on this interesting topic.

When screening for cancer in older adults, it is important to consider the risks 
of screening, how long it takes to benefit from screening, and the patient's 
comorbidities and life expectancy. Delivering high-value care requires the 
consideration of evidence-based screening guidelines and careful selection of 
patients. This article considers the impact of cancer. It explores perspectives 
on the costs of common cancer screening tests, illustrates how using life 
expectancy can help clinicians determine who will benefit most from screening, 
and provides tools to help clinicians discuss with their older patients when it 
may be appropriate to stop screening for cancer.

BACKGROUND: Lack of consensus in management guidelines for women with minor 
cervical lesions, coupled with novel screening approaches, such as human 
papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping, necessitate revisiting prevention policies. We 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness and resource trade-offs of alternative triage 
strategies to inform cervical cancer prevention in Norway.
METHODS: We used a decision-analytic model to compare the lifetime health and 
economic consequences associated with ten novel candidate approaches to triage 
women with minor cervical lesions. Candidate strategies varied by: 1) the triage 
test(s): HPV testing in combination with cytology, HPV testing alone with or 
without genotyping for HPV-16 and -18, and immediate colposcopy, and 2) the 
length of time between index and triage testing (i.e., 6, 12 or 18months). Model 
outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime societal costs, 
and resource use (e.g., colposcopy referrals).
RESULTS: The current Norwegian guidelines were less effective and more costly 
than candidate strategies. Given a commonly-cited willingness-to-pay threshold 
in Norway of $100,000 per QALY gained, the preferred strategy involved HPV 
genotyping with immediate colposcopy referral for HPV-16 or -18 positive and 
repeat HPV testing at 12months for non-HPV-16 or -18 positive ($78,010 per QALY 
gained). Differences in health benefits among candidate strategies were small, 
while resource use varied substantially. More effective strategies required a 
moderate increase in colposcopy referrals (e.g., a 9% increase for the preferred 
strategy) compared with current levels.
CONCLUSION: New applications of HPV testing may improve management of women with 
minor cervical lesions, yet are accompanied by a trade-off of increased 
follow-up procedures.

Coarctation of Aorta is not rare in general population. Aortic Coarctation 
represents about 5-8% of all congenital cardiac diseases, and it is commonly 
associated with bicuspid aortic valve. Coarctation of Aorta is typically a 
disease of childhood and early adulthood, reducing life expectancy in patients, 
who have not undergone correction. Many case reports of Coarctation of Aorta 
patients presenting with anterior wall myocardial infraction have been published 
in various journals, but to the best of our knowledge, no case of Coarctation of 
Aorta with acute anterior wall myocardial in 30-year-old male is reported till 
date. We are presenting a rare case of anterior wall myocardial infraction in 
young male with asymptomatic Coarctation of Aorta.

Nanoparticle transport inside the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a crucial factor 
affecting the therapeutic success. In this work, two in vitro ECM models - a 
neutrally charged collagen I network with an effective pore size of 0.47μm and 
Matrigel, a basement membrane matrix with strong negative charge and effective 
pore size of 0.14μm - were assessed for barrier function in the context of 
diffusing nanoparticles. Nanoparticles with a size of 120nm were coated with 
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) of different molecular weights - 2, 5 and 20kDa - 
over a range of gradually increasing coating densities - precisely 0.2, 2, 8 and 
20PEG/nm2. The PEG corona was imaged in its native state without any drying 
process by atomic force microscopy, revealing that the experimentally determined 
arrangement of PEG at the surface did not match with what was theoretically 
expected. In a systematic investigation of nanoparticle mobility via 
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, increasing both PEG MW and 
PEGylation density gradually improved diffusion properties predominately in 
collagen. Due to its smaller pore size and electrostatic obstruction, diffusion 
coefficients were about ten times lower in Matrigel than in the collagen network 
and an extension of the PEG MW and density did not necessarily lead to better 
diffusing particles. Consequently, collagen gels were revealed to be a poor 
model for nanoparticle mobility assessment, as neither their pore size nor their 
electrostatic properties reflect the expected in vivo conditions. In Matrigel, 
diffusion proceeded according to a sigmoidal increase with gradually increasing 
PEG densities showing threshold zeta potentials of 11.6mV (PEG2kDa) and 13.8mV 
(PEG5kDa), below which particles were regarded as mobile. Irrespective of the 
molecular weight particles with a PEGylation density lower than 2PEG/nm2 were 
defined as immobile and those with a PEG coverage of more than 8PEG/nm2 as 
mobile.

The average age of the global human population is increasing, leading to 
increased interest in the effects of chronic disease and multimorbidity on 
health resources and patient welfare. It has been posited that the average age 
of the general veterinarian-attended horse population of the UK is also 
increasing, and therefore it could be assumed that chronic diseases and 
multimorbidity would pose an increasing risk here also. However, evidence for 
this trend in ageing is very limited, and the current prevalence of many chronic 
diseases, and of multimorbidity, is unknown. Using text mining of first-opinion 
electronic medical records from seven veterinary practices around the UK, 
Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard modelling, we were able to estimate the 
apparent prevalence among veterinarian-attended horses of nine chronic diseases, 
and to assess their relative effects on median life expectancy following 
diagnosis. With these methods we found evidence of increasing population age. 
Multimorbidity affected 1.2% of the study population, and had a significant 
effect upon survival times, with co-occurrence of two diseases, and three or 
more diseases, leading to 6.6 and 21.3 times the hazard ratio compared to no 
chronic disease, respectively. Laminitis was involved in 74% of cases of 
multimorbidity. The population of horses attended by UK veterinarians appears to 
be aging, and chronic diseases and their co-occurrence are common features, and 
as such warrant further investigation.

Hope is a future expectancy characterized by an individual's perception that a 
desirable future outcome can be achieved. Though scales exist to measure hope, 
they may have limited relevance in low resource, high HIV prevalence settings. 
We developed and validated a hope scale among young women living in rural South 
Africa. We conducted formative interviews to identify the key elements of hope. 
Using items developed from these interviews, we administered the hope scale to 
2533 young women enrolled in an HIV-prevention trial. Women endorsed scale items 
highly and the scale proved to be unidimensional in the sample. Hope scores were 
significantly correlated with hypothesized psycholosocial correlates with the 
exception of life stressors. Overall, our hope measure was found to have 
excellent reliability and to show encouraging preliminary indications of 
validity in this population. This study presents a promising measure to assess 
hope among young women in South Africa.

Hazardous alcohol consumption in Germany is a main threat to health. By using 
insurance claim data from the German Statutory Health Insurance and a 
classification strategy based on ICD10 diagnoses-codes we analyzed a sample of 
146,000 subjects with more than 19,000 hazardous alcohol consumers. Employing 
different regression models with a control function approach, we calculate life 
years lost due to alcohol consumption, annual direct and indirect health costs, 
and the burden of pain and suffering measured by the Charlson-Index and assessed 
pain diagnoses. Additionally, we simulate the net accumulated premium payments 
over expenses in the German Statutory Health Insurance and the Statutory Pension 
Fund for hazardous alcohol consumers from a lifecycle perspective. In total, 
€39.3 billion each year result from hazardous alcohol consumption with an 
average loss of 7 years in life expectancy. Hazardous alcohol consumers clearly 
do not "pay their way" in the two main German social security systems and also 
display a higher intangible burden according to our definitions of pain and 
suffering.
