management practices in these settings.
METHODS: Medicaid claims records and clinician data were linked with hospital 
and regional data for individuals with a principal diagnosis of any mental 
disorder admitted to psychiatric inpatient units in New York State from 2012 to 
2013. A modified Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) score was calculated for 
each unique individual (n = 14,458). Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of having a 
medical comorbidity were calculated using logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: 74.9% of psychiatric inpatients had at least one medical comorbidity, 
including 57.5% of people ages 18-24. Higher rates of medical comorbidity were 
associated with older age, female gender, non-schizophrenia diagnoses, and 
engagement in care prior to hospitalization. Patients with medical comorbidities 
had lower odds (AOR 0.54; 99% CI 0.35-0.83) of being treated in hospitals with 
100 or more total beds compared to smaller hospitals.
CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of common medical diagnoses among psychiatric 
inpatients underscores the importance of adequate detection and medical 
treatment of medical comorbidities in psychiatric inpatient settings.

The prevalence of diabetes is increasing particularly in the older age group due 
to the increased life expectancy. Ageing is associated with vascular and renal 
changes that predispose older people with diabetes to an increased risk of 
cardio-renal complications. This manuscript is set to review the use of the 
sodium glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and the glucagon like peptide-1 
receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) in older population with diabetes especially in 
those with comorbidities and frailty. The recently introduced (SGLT-2) 
inhibitors and the GLP1-RA have shown promising cardio-renal protective 
outcomes. In addition to the favourable effect of glycaemic control on 
cardio-renal complications, these new agents seem to add additional benefits 
independent of their hypoglycaemic properties. The favourable outcomes have been 
shown in the older age group (>65 years) who were reasonably represented in the 
randomised controlled clinical trials. However, the evidence for those ≥75 years 
old is limited due to the small number of the included participants and the few 
clinical events. Data from both real world and post-hoc analyses of clinical 
trials is assuring about the use of these new agents in older people. However, 
it remains reasonable to express caution in using these agents in frail older 
people with diabetes due to high risk of adverse events in this group.

INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis is a common chronic skin inflammatory disease. Its 
presentation, apart from affected skin areas, involves other unpleasant 
symptoms, such as pain. Pain deteriorates the patient's quality of life, 
impairing their daily behaviour and functioning. Therefore, the alleviation of 
pain in patients with psoriasis should be one of the most desired outcomes of 
successful treatment. The aim of this study is to summarise available evidence 
about pain in patients with psoriasis using systematic scoping review 
methodology in order to map the relevant literature.
METHODS AND ANALYSES: Our scoping systematic review will provide evidence 
synthesis of the literature, both quantitative and qualitative, about the pain 
associated with psoriasis, including pain associated with psoriatic arthritis. 
Any types of studies will be eligible for inclusion, and we will not have any 
time, language or publication status restrictions. We will search MEDLINE, 
Embase and PsycINFO via OVID, as well as Cochrane Central Register of Clinical 
Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Cochrane Library, CINAHL via 
EBSCO, OpenGrey and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. All databases will 
be searched from the date of their inception. Retrieved bibliographic records 
and potentially relevant full texts will be screened by two authors 
independently. Two researchers will extract data independently. Any 
discrepancies will be resolved via discussion or consultation of the third 
author, if necessary. To appraise studies, we will use a Mixed Methods Appraisal 
Tool, AMSTAR 2, Cochrane risk of bias tool and ROBINS. Our findings will be 
reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The proposed study will not be conducted with human 
participants. We will only use published data and therefore ethics approval is 
not required. Our findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed manuscript and 
conference reports.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common worldwide and closely 
associated with metabolic dysfunction. NAFLD leads to a higher risk of 
development of severe liver diseases, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH), liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, no 
pharmacotherapy targeting NAFLD has received general approval. Adlay is a plant 
that has been used as traditional herbal medicine in Asia and is a promising 
candidate to solve this global issue. We have established a mouse model of NAFLD 
by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks. Here, ethanolic or water extracts 
of adlay seed (ASE and ASW, respectively), mixed with HFD, were fed to the mice 
for 10 weeks. The ASE and ASW treatment ameliorated hyperglycemia and improved 
the glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in the HFD mice. Hyperlipidemia in 
HFD mice was prevented by the ASE and ASW diet. In addition, the ASE and ASW 
supplementation attenuated hepatic steatosis and inflammation, improved liver 
function, and caused no harm to the kidneys. Moreover, the mechanism of the 
effect of ASE and ASW on inhibiting hepatic lipogenesis and inducing fatty acid 
β-oxidation was certified by the simulated human fatty liver cell model. Our 
study showed the regulatory potential of the extracts of adlay seeds for 
alleviating NAFLD, as well as related liver and metabolic diseases.

Owing to advancement of medical technology and current knowledge, the population 
has a longer life expectancy, leading to an increase in the proportion of 
elderly.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the effect of action observation (AO) 
combined with gait training on gait and cognition in elderly with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Thirty-three participants were randomly allocated to action observation 
with gait training (AOGT), gait training (GT), and control (CT) groups. The AOGT 
and GT groups received a program of observation and gait training protocol with 
the same total duration of 65 min for 12 sessions. For the observation, the AGOT 
group watched a video of normal gait movement, while the GT group watched an 
abstract picture and the CT group received no training program. All participants 
were assessed for gait parameters during single- and dual-tasks using an 
electronic gait mat system and were assessed for cognitive level using the 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline, after training and at 1-month 
follow-up.
RESULTS: The results showed that the AOGT group had significant improvements in 
gait speeds during single- and dual-tasks, as well as better MoCA score, while 
the GT group had significant improvement only in gait speed.
CONCLUSION: The adjunct treatment of AO with gait training provides greater 
benefits for both gait and cognitive performances in elderly with MCI.

Publisher: Com o avanço da tecnologia médica e do conhecimento atual, a 
população tem uma expectativa de vida mais longa, levando a um aumento na 
proporção de idosos.
OBJETIVO: O estudo teve como objetivo investigar o efeito da observação de ação 
(AO) combinada com o treinamento da marcha na marcha e cognição em idosos com 
comprometimento cognitivo leve (CCL).
MÉTODOS: Trinta e três participantes foram alocados aleatoriamente para 
observação de ação com grupos de treinamento de marcha (AOGT), treinamento de 
marcha (GT) e controle (CT). Os grupos AOGT e GT receberam um programa de 
observação e protocolo de treinamento de marcha com a mesma duração total de 65 
minutos por 12 sessões. Na observação, o grupo AGOT assistiu a um vídeo de 
movimento normal da marcha, enquanto o grupo GT assistiu a uma figura abstrata e 
o grupo CT não recebeu nenhum programa de treinamento. Todos os participantes 
foram avaliados quanto aos parâmetros da marcha durante tarefas simples e 
duplas, utilizando um sistema eletrônico de esteira da marcha e avaliados quanto 
ao nível cognitivo, utilizando a Avaliação Cognitiva de Montreal (MoCA) na linha 
de base, após o treinamento e 1 mês de acompanhamento.
RESULTADOS: Os resultados mostraram que o grupo AOGT apresentou melhorias 
significativas nas velocidades da marcha durante tarefas simples e duplas, além 
do escore MoCA, enquanto o grupo GT teve melhora significativa apenas na 
velocidade da marcha.
CONCLUSÃO: O tratamento adjunto da AO com o treinamento da marcha proporciona 
maiores benefícios tanto do desempenho da marcha quanto do desempenho cognitivo 
em idosos com CCL.

University, Nagoya, Japan.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) 
supplementation on motor unit adaptation following resistance training in older 
adults. Twenty-five older males and females took MFGM (n = 12) or a placebo 
(PLA; n = 12) while performing 8 weeks of isometric knee extension training. 
During the training, the motor unit firing pattern during submaximal 
contractions, muscle thickness, and maximal muscle strength of knee extensor 
muscles were measured every 2 weeks. None of the measurements showed significant 
differences in muscle thickness or maximal muscle strength (MVC) between the two 
groups (p > .05). Significant decreases in motor unit firing rate following the 
intervention were observed in PLA, that is, 14.1 ± 2.7 pps at 0 weeks to 
13.0 ± 2.4 pps at 4 weeks (p = .003), but not in MFGM (14.4 ± 2.5 pps to 
13.8 ± 1.9 pps). Motor unit firing rates in MFGM were significantly higher than 
those in PLA at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of the intervention, that is, 15.1 ± 2.3 
pps in MFGM and 14.5 ± 3.3 pps in PLA at 70% of MVC for motor units recruited at 
40% of MVC at 6 weeks (p = .034). Significant differences in firing rates among 
motor units with different recruitment thresholds were newly observed following 
the resistance training intervention in MFGM, indicating that motor unit firing 
pattern is changed in this group. These results suggest that motor unit 
adaptation following resistance training is modulated by MFGM supplementation in 
older adults.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the creation of a percutaneous proximal radial 
artery-radial vein arteriovenous fistula with Ellipsys® instead of the usual 
first-stage brachial artery fistula prior to a second-stage brachial vein 
elevation, in patients with inadequate cephalic and basilic veins.
METHODS: Single center study of eight patients (six males, mean = 54 years) who 
underwent a two-stage brachial vein elevation procedure between May 2017 and 
October 2019. Inclusion criteria were life expectancy > 6 months, patent 
brachial and proximal radial artery (>2 mm in diameter) absent/inadequate 
cephalic and basilic veins, existence of a brachial vein >3 mm in diameter, and 
in continuity with a proximal radial vein > 2 mm in diameter.
RESULTS: Technical success was 100%. Four patients required angioplasty of a 
juxta-anastomotic stenosis, accounting for a 6-month primary and secondary 
patency rates were 68% and 100%, respectively. Access flow averaged 982 mL/min 
(range 768-1586) at final follow-up evaluation. There were no significant 
adverse events related to the procedures. All fistulae were elevated at 4-12 
(mean: 8) weeks post creation and were successfully cannulated with two needles 
after healing was completed (2-4 weeks after elevation). No patients developed 
hand ischemia or arm edema.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous creation of a proximal radial artery-radial vein 
fistula followed by brachial vein elevation is a safe and reliable option for 
autogenous access creation in patients with inadequate cephalic or basilic 
veins. Minimally invasive radial artery inflow and longer available length of 
the targeted brachial vein available for elevation are the main advantages in 
skilled hands.

OBJECTIVES: This study constructed an Active Aging Index (AAI) for Vietnam and 
compares Vietnam's AAI with those of China, Korea, Taiwan, and 28 countries in 
the European Union.
METHODS: A survey of 1,105 people aged 55 or above in three provinces from the 
northern, central, and southern parts of Vietnam was conducted. Active aging was 
measured using the AAI; its 22 indicators were grouped into four domains: 
employment, social participation, independent/healthy/secure living, and 
enabling environments.
RESULTS: Of the 32 countries reviewed, Vietnam ranked 11th. It ranked high for 
employment (1st) and social participation (5th) but low for 
independent/healthy/secure living (32nd) and enabling environments (26th).
CONCLUSION: Three policy priorities were identified: maintaining a high 
preference-driven social and workforce participation rate among older adults; 
promoting medical care and healthy behaviors among older adults; and improving 
other poorly performing aspects of active aging, including voluntary activities, 
poverty risk, Internet usage, and lifelong learning.

Improvement and development of technologies for laboratory and instrumental 
examination of patients in recent years have greatly facilitated the diagnosis 
of ischemic myocardial damage. However, a decrease in the rating of 
cardiovascular diseases is not expected in the short term. This is due to an 
increase in the life expectancy of the population, general aging of the 
population and improving diagnostic capabilities and the provision of medical 
care. The time for verification of the diagnosis of ischemic disease, simplified 
the decision on treatment tactics were significantly reduced by introduction of 
X-ray contrast visualization examination methods such as angiography, 
quantitative and qualitative laboratory tests, development of diagnostic 
criteria based on the results of ultrasound and electrophysiological examination 
methods. Unfortunately, all these techniques are secondary in nature and are 
applied, when organ damage is for the most part already irreversible. Full 
restoration of organs is possible only if the patient is successfully evacuated 
to the hospital and there are specialists of the appropriate level of 
experiebce, X-ray surgical equipment with suitable supplies or pharmacological 
agents, usefull for quickly restoration the patency of the great vessels and 
normal blood flow. A large number of studies appear on the phenomenon of 
preconditioning at the present stage of development of fundamental medical 
science. The purpose of this article is to reveal the possibilities of using 
molecular markers of the phenomenon of preconditioning in the framework of the 
early detection of hypoxic conditions, the assessment of their diagnostic use in 
the clinic and the prevention of hypoxia-associated diseases.

Publisher: Совершенствование и развитие технологий лабораторного и 
инструментального обследования пациентов в последнее время существенно облегчили 
диагностику ишемических повреждений миокарда. Однако в ближайшей перспективе не 
предвидится снижение рейтинга сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний. Это связано с 
увеличением продолжительности жизни населения, общим старением популяции, а 
также совершенствованием диагностических возможностей и оказания медицинской 
помощи. Внедрение рентгенконтрастных визуализационных методов обследования, 
таких как ангиография, количественных и качественных лабораторных тестов, 
разработка диагностических критериев по результатам ультразвуковых и 
электрофизиологических методов обследования существенно сократили время 
верификации диагноза ишемического заболевания, упростили принятие решения о 
тактике лечения. К сожалению, все эти методики носят вторичный характер и 
применяются, когда повреждение органов в большинстве своем носит уже необратимый 
характер. Полное восстановление органов возможно только в случае удачной 
эвакуации пациента в стационар и наличия в нем специалистов соответствующего 
уровня, рентген-хирургического оборудования с подходящими расходными материалами 
или фармакологическими агентами, способными в кратчайшие сроки восстановить 
проходимость магистральных сосудов и нормальный кровоток. На современном этапе 
развития фундаментальной медицинской науки появляется большое количество 
исследований, посвященных феномену прекондиционирования. Целью данной статьи 
является раскрытие возможностей использования молекулярных маркеров феномена 
прекондиционирования в рамках раннего выявления гипоксических состояний, оценки 
их диагностического применения в клинике и профилактике гипоксия-ассоциированных 
заболеваний.

[Systemic manifestations of inflammatory bowel diseases].

The article is devoted to the current data regarding the pathogenesis, 
classification and frequency of extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) in 
inflammatory bowel diseases. We discuss two distinct theories of EIMs 
pathogenesis. First, EIMs arise from an extension of antigen-specific immune 
responses from the intestine to non-intestinal sites. Second, EIMs are 
independent inflammatory events initiated or perpetuated by the presence of IBD 
or by shared genetic or environmental risk factors in the host. These mechanisms 
are not mutually exclusive and may contribute to varying degrees in different 
EIMs. Early diagnosis of EIMs contributes to prevention disability and 
enhancement of quality of life of IBD patients. It is concluded that treatment 
of extraintestinal manifestations should be carried out taking into account the 
course of the IBD and the multidisciplinary approach, which requires close 
cooperation of doctors of various specialties. Assessment of prognostic markers 
and predictors for EIM in IBD will be part of a future investigation.

Publisher: В статье приведены сведения о патогенезе, классификации и частоте 
внекишечных проявлений (ВКП) воспалительных заболеваний кишечника (ВЗК). 
Рассмотрены два пути патогенеза ВКП, один из которых осуществляется посредством 
антиген-специфичного иммунного ответа из кишечника в другие органы. Второй путь 
ВКП является независимым воспалительным процессом, который инициируется или 
поддерживается наличием ВЗК или имеет общие факторы риска генетической 
предрасположенности и окружающей среды. Эти механизмы не исключают друг друга и 
могут вносить свой вклад в различные проявления ВКП. Ранняя диагностика ВКП 
необходима для предотвращения инвалидизации пациентов с ВЗК и повышения качества 
их жизни. Для реализации данного подхода необходимо тесное взаимодействие врачей 
различных специальностей, которые в своей повседневной практике могут наблюдать 
подобных больных. Необходимы дальнейшие исследования по оценке прогностических 
маркеров и предикторов развития ВКП ВЗК, а также влияния на них различных 
методов терапии.

AIM: To study the epidemiology of multiple myeloma in the city of Moscow and 
compare the results obtained with data from similar studies in other countries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study is based on information from a database of case 
histories of 3942 patients suffering from symptomatic MM, residents of the city 
of Moscow, which is maintained at the Hematologic Moscow City Center of S.P. 
Botkin Municipal Clinical Hospital. The control of the completeness of inclusion 
was carried out by cross - comparison with the data of the Moscow Cancer 
Register and the Register of Program 7 (beginning in 2019 - 12) of Highly 
Expensive Nosologies. The assessment was made according to data as of January 1, 
2019. The calculations were carried out taking into account the data of Rosstat 
at the beginning of 2019 on the population of Moscow in different gender and age 
categories.
RESULTS: Among the 3942 patients with active MM 1707 men - 43% and 2241 women - 
57%, the median of the current age was 68 (28-94) years. The median time of 
observation of patients since the diagnosis of the disease 34 (1-423) months. 
The peak incidence was in the age range of more than 60 years. There were no 
significant differences in gender ratio in different age strata with a breakdown 
of 10 years. The number of cases of newly diagnosed MM per year for the period 
from 2009 (n=219) to 2018 (n=385) increased by 75.8%. At the same time, the 
demonstrated increase in the incidence rate for the described period turned out 
to be fair only for groups of patients over 50 years old, with the maximum 
increase in this indicator over the described period in the age range of 60-69 
years. This is mainly due to the increase in life expectancy in Moscow in recent 
years. The study demonstrated that over the past 10 years, the average annual 
mortality rate from MM has decreased in Moscow, and as a result, its prevalence 
has increased. The rate of 2-year overall survival of patients with MM was 76%, 
5-year - old - 49%, 10-year - old - 27%. The median overall survival of patients 
under the age of 65 when diagnosing the disease was 79 months, and 48 months. 
The distribution of patients within international classifications was consistent 
with international data.
CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a significant dynamic of the epidemiological 
situation concerning MM in Moscow. Over the past 10 years there has been an 
increase in the incidence of MM, as a result of an increase in the life 
expectancy of the population. The use of modern diagnostics and therapy of MM in 
real clinical practice has led to a significant reduction in mortality. Due to 
these factors, an increase in the prevalence of MM in Moscow has taken place, 
and this process will no doubt progress in the future.

Publisher: Цель - изучить эпидемиологию множественной миеломы (ММ) в городе 
Москве и сравнить полученные результаты с данными аналогичных исследований в 
других странах. Материалы и методы. Исследование основано на информации базы 
данных историй болезни 3942 пациентов, страдающих симптоматической ММ, жителей 
города Москвы, которая ведется в Московском городском гематологическом центре 
ГБУЗ «Городская клиническая больница им. С.П. Боткина» ДЗМ. Контроль полноты 
включения осуществлялся путем перекрестного сопоставления с данными Московского 
ракового регистра и Регистра программы «7 (с 2019 г. - 12) высокозатратных 
нозологий». Оценка произведена по данным на 1 января 2019 г. Расчеты проводились 
с учетом данных Росстата начала 2019 г. о численности населения г. Москвы в 
разных гендерных и возрастных категориях. Результаты. Среди 3942 пациентов с 
активной ММ было 1707 (43%) мужчин и 2241 (57%) женщина, медиана текущего 
возраста составила 68 (28-94) лет. Медиана времени наблюдения пациентов с 
момента диагностики заболевания была 34 (1-423) мес. Пик заболеваемости 
приходился на возрастной промежуток более 60 лет. Достоверных отличий по 
гендерному соотношению в разных возрастных стратах с разбивкой по 10 лет не 
было. Количество случаев впервые диагностируемой ММ в год за период с 2009 
(n=219) по 2018 г. (n=385) возросло на 75,8%. Увеличение уровня заболеваемости 
за описываемый период оказалось справедливым только для групп пациентов старше 
50 лет, с максимальным приростом данного показателя в возрастном интервале 60-69 
лет. В основном это связано с увеличением продолжительности жизни в Москве в 
последние годы. За последние 10 лет в Москве уменьшился показатель среднегодовой 
смертности от ММ в результате внедрения инновационных методов терапии и как 
следствие вырос уровень ее распространенности. Показатель 2-летней общей 
выживаемости (ОВ) пациентов с ММ составил 76%, 5-летней - 49%, 10-летней - 27%. 
Медиана ОВ больных, не достигших при диагностике заболевания 65 лет, составила 
79 мес, достигших - 48 мес. Распределение пациентов в рамках международных 
классификаций соответствовало международным данным. Заключение. За последние 10 
лет наблюдается рост заболеваемости ММ в результате увеличения продолжительности 
жизни населения. Применение своевременной диагностики и современной терапии ММ в 
реальной клинической практике привело к значительному снижению смертности. 
Благодаря этим факторам произошло увеличение распространенности ММ в Москве, и 
этот процесс в дальнейшем, несомненно, будет прогрессировать.

The review is devoted to the urgent problem of modern pulmonology: the 
differential diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ILF). ILF occupies a 
special place among many interstitial lung diseases for a number of reasons: 1) 
it is a deadly disease; 2) early diagnosis and adequate antifibrotic therapy 
significantly extend the life expectancy of patients; 3) anti-inflammatory drugs 
(corticosteroids) and cytostatics with ILF that are widely used in other forms 
of interstitial lung diseases are ineffective and accelerate the progression of 
the process; 4) the commonality of the main clinical signs (increasing 
respiratory failure) of various interstitial lung diseases. The list of 
respiratory diseases with which ILF should be differentiated is huge, and if 
with diffuse lung lesions of a known nature (disseminated pulmonary 
tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis, etc.) with a certain experience/qualification, the 
diagnosis is relatively simple, then the isolation of ILF from the group of 
idiopathic interstitial pneumonias always represents certain difficulties. The 
main methods used in the diagnosis of ILF are summarized taking into account 
current international and national recommendations.

Publisher: Обзор посвящен актуальной проблеме современной пульмонологии: 
дифференциальной диагностике идиопатического легочного фиброза (ИЛФ). ИЛФ 
занимает особое место среди множества интерстициальных болезней легких по ряду 
причин: 1) это смертельная болезнь; 2) ранняя диагностика и адекватная 
антифибротическая терапия существенно удлиняют продолжительность жизни больных; 
3) широко применяемые при других формах интерстициальных болезней легких 
противовоспалительные препараты (кортикостероиды) и цитостатики при ИЛФ 
неэффективны и ускоряют прогрессирование процесса; 4) общность основных 
клинических признаков (нарастающая дыхательная недостаточность) различных 
интерстициальных болезней легких. Перечень заболеваний органов дыхания, с 
которыми следует дифференцировать ИЛФ, огромен, и если с диффузными поражениями 
легких известной природы (диссеминированный туберкулез легких, пневмокониозы и 
др.) при определенном опыте/квалификации диагностика относительно проста, то 
выделение ИЛФ из группы идиопатических интерстициальных пневмоний всегда 
представляет определенные трудности. Суммируются основные методы, используемые в 
диагностике ИЛФ, с учетом современных международных и национальных рекомендаций.

Muscle strength is sex-related and declines with advancing age; yet, a 
comprehensive comparative evaluation of age-related strength loss in human 
females and males has not been undertaken. To do so, segmented piecewise 
regression analysis was performed on aggregated data from studies published from 
1990 to 2018 and are available in CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO 
databases. The search identified 5613 articles that were reviewed for physical 
assessment results stratified by sex and age. Maximal isometric and isokinetic 
60°·s-1 knee extension (KE) and knee flexion (KF) contractions from 57 studies 
and 15 283 subjects (N = 7918 females) had sufficient data reported on females 
and males for meaningful statistical evaluation to be undertaken. The analysis 
revealed that isometric KE and KF strength undergo similar rapid declines in 
both sexes late in the sixth decade of life. Yet, there is an abrupt age-related 
decline in KE 60°·s-1 peak torque earlier in females (aged 41.8 years) than 
males (aged 66.7 years). In the assessment of KF peak torque, an age-related 
acceleration in strength loss was only identified in males (aged 49.3 years). 
The results suggest that age-related isometric strength loss is similar between 
sexes while the characteristics of KE and KF peak torque decline are 
sex-related, which likely explains the differential rate of age-related 
functional decline. Novelty Inclusion of muscle strength and torque of KE and KF 
data from >15 000 subjects. Isometric KE and KF strength loss are similar 
between sexes. Isokinetic 60°·s-1 KE torque decline accelerates 25 years earlier 
in females and female age-related KF peak torque decline does not accelerate 
with age.

OBJECTIVE: Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) in DSM, characterized 
by severe, chronic irritability, currently excludes children <6 years of age. 
However, capitalizing on a burgeoning developmental science base to 
differentiate clinically salient irritability in young children may enable 
earlier identification. The objective of this study was to advance an 
empirically derived framework for early childhood DMDD (EC-DMDD) by modeling and 
validating DMDD patterns in early childhood and generating clinically 
informative, optimized behaviors with thresholds.
METHOD: Data (N = 425) were from 3 longitudinal assessments of the MAPS Study, 
spanning preschool (means = 4.7 and 5.5 years) to early school age (mean = 6.8 
years). The Multidimensional Assessment Profile of Disruptive Behavior (MAP-DB) 
Temper Loss scale captured irritability, the Family Life Impairment Scale (FLIS) 
assessed cross-domain impairment at the preschool time points and the Schedule 
for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS) was 
used to assess clinical status at early school age. Latent transition analyses 
differentiated children with EC-DMDD from children with low, transient, or 
nonimpairing irritability.
RESULTS: Developmental patterning of irritability proved important for 
normal:abnormal differentiation. Of children, 27% had initially high 
irritability, but only two-thirds of these were persistently highly irritable. 
Thus, "false positives" based on a single screen would be substantial. Yet, 
"false negatives" are low, as <1% of children with baseline low irritability 
demonstrated later high irritability. Based on the sequential preschool-age time 
points, 6.7% of children were identified with EC-DMDD, characterized by 
persistent irritability with pervasive impairment, similar to prevalence at 
older ages. Specific behaviors included low frustration tolerance; dysregulated, 
developmentally unexpectable tantrums; and sustained irritable mood, all of 
which sensitively (0.85-0.96) and specifically (0.80-0.91) identified EC-DMDD. 
EC-DMDD predicted irritability-related syndromes (DMDD, oppositional defiant 
disorder) at early school age better than downward extension of DSM DMDD 
criteria to preschool age.
CONCLUSION: These findings provide empirical thresholds for preschool-age 
clinical identification of DMDD patterns. The results lay the foundation for 
validation of DMDD in early childhood and inform revision of DSM criteria.

CONTEXT: The use of continuous sedation until death (CSD) has been highly 
debated for many years. It is unknown how the use of CSD evolves over time. 
Reports suggest that there is an international increase in the use of CSD for 
terminally ill patients.
OBJECTIVE: To gain insight in developments in the use of CSD in various 
countries and subpopulations.
METHODS: We performed a search of the literature published between January 2000 
and April 2020, in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Library by 
using the Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis 
protocols guidelines. The search contained the following terms: continuous 
sedation, terminal sedation, palliative sedation, deep sedation, end-of-life 
sedation, sedation practice, and sedation until death.
RESULTS: We found 23 articles on 16 nationwide studies and 38 articles on 37 
subpopulation studies. In nationwide studies on frequencies of CSD in deceased 
persons varied from 3% in Denmark in 2001 to 18% in The Netherlands in 2015. 
Nationwide studies indicate an increase in the use of CSD. Frequencies of CSD in 
the different subpopulations varied too widely to observe time trends. Over the 
years, more studies reported on the use of CSD for nonphysical symptoms 
including fear, anxiety, and psycho-existential distress. In some studies, there 
was an increase in requests for sedation of patients from their families.
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of CSD seems to increase over time, possibly partly 
because of an extension of indications for sedation, from mainly physical 
symptoms to also nonphysical symptoms.

PURPOSE: With the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), life 
expectancy has increased among persons living with HIV, but so too has risk for 
comorbidities including osteoporosis and fragility fracture. To explore whether 
HIV status and cART influence three-dimensional measures of BMD, bone 
microarchitecture and strength we aimed to compare these outcomes between women 
living with HIV (WLWH; n = 50; 50.4 ± 1.2 years, 44% postmenopausal) and without 
HIV (controls; n = 50; 51.8 ± 1.2 years, 52% postmenopausal).
METHODS: Outcomes were lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck areal BMD by 
DXA; distal radius and tibia trabecular BMD, thickness and number, and cortical 
BMD and area by HR-pQCT; and finite element analysis-derived bone strength 
(failure load). Multivariable regression analysis compared bone outcomes between 
groups adjusting for known osteoporosis risk factors. Within WLWH, we examined 
associations between bone outcomes and HIV-related factors including disease 
severity and cART duration.
RESULTS: WLWH were diagnosed 20 ± 4 years ago, were on cART for 123 ± 37 months 
and 80% had HIV plasma viral load <40 copies/mL. For women ≥50 years (n = 61), 
total hip aBMD T-Score was lower among WLWH than controls. Adjusted distal 
radius trabecular BMD and thickness and distal tibia trabecular BMD and failure 
load were 8-19% lower in WLWH than controls (p < 0.05). Cortical BMD and area 
did not differ between groups at either site. Lifetime cART duration and current 
plasma viral load were not associated with bone outcomes in WLWH; however, 
previous treatment with tenofovir was negatively associated with distal radius 
trabecular BMD and trabecular number and LS aBMD T-score.
CONCLUSIONS: WLWH have compromised BMD, bone microarchitecture and strength vs. 
controls of similar age and reproductive status. Treatment with tenofovir may 
contribute to bone deficits in WLWH.

PURPOSE: People with epilepsy (PWE) come from a wide variety of social 
backgrounds and educational skillsets, making self-management (SM) education for 
improving their condition challenging. Here, we evaluated whether a mobile 
technology-based personalized epilepsy SM education intervention, PAUSE to Learn 
Your Epilepsy (PAUSE), improves SM measures such as self-efficacy, epilepsy SM 
behaviors, epilepsy outcome expectations, quality of life (QOL), and personal 
impact of epilepsy in adults with epilepsy.
METHODS: Recruitment for the PAUSE study occurred from October 2015 to March 
2019. Ninety-one PWE were educated using an Internet-enabled computer tablet 
application that downloads custom, patient-specific educational programs from 
Epilepsy.com. Validated self-reported questionnaires were used for outcome 
measures. Participants were assessed at baseline (T0), the first follow-up at 
completion of the PWE-paced 8-12-week SM education intervention (T1), and the 
second follow-up at least 3 months after the first follow-up (T2). Multiple 
linear regression was used to assess within-subject significant changes in 
outcome measures between these time points.
RESULTS: The study population was diverse and included individuals with a wide 
variety of SM educational needs and abilities. The median time for the first 
follow-up assessment (T1) was approximately 4 months following the baseline (T0) 
and 8 months following baseline for the second follow-up assessment (T2). 
Participants showed significant improvement in all SM behaviors, self-efficacy, 
outcome expectancy, QOL, and personal impact of epilepsy measures from T0 to T1. 
Participants who scored lower at baseline tended to show greater improvement at 
T1. Similarly, results showed that participant improvement was sustained in the 
majority of SM measures from T1 to T2.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a mobile technology-based personalized 
SM intervention is feasible to implement. The results provide evidence that 
epilepsy SM behavior and practices, QOL, outcome expectation for epilepsy 
treatment and management, self-efficacy, and outcome expectation and impact of 
epilepsy significantly improve following a personalized SM education 
intervention. This underscores a greater need for a pragmatic trial to test the 
effectiveness of personalized SM education, such as PAUSE to Learn Your 
Epilepsy, in broader settings specifically for the unique needs of the 
hard-to-reach and hard-to-treat population of PWE.

PURPOSE: Cervical Necrotizing fasciitis (CNF) has been reported as an unusual 
rapidly progressive, life-threatening, inflammatory disease that is known to 
affect predominately immunocompromised patients. Few case reports have been 
sporadically published involving immunocompetent adults. This is the first study 
presents a series of immunocompetent CNF patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review study was performed on 
immunocompetent adults with CNF from January 2003 to December 2019. The 
diagnosis was histologically confirmed. We analyzed epidemiological, clinical, 
laboratory and imaging findings and discussed them along with the treatment 
plan.
RESULTS: A total of eleven adult patients were included in the study. The 
average age was 43 years, ranging from 17 to 62 years. The average 
hospitalization time was 28 days, ranging from 10 to 129 days. All patients 
presented with cervical erythema and odynophagia. The causative factors are 
known in nine patients. Tissue cultures demonstrated mixed flora in six
