BACKGROUND: Deaths in the first year of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic in England and Wales were unevenly distributed socioeconomically and 
geographically. However, the full scale of inequalities may have been 
underestimated to date, as most measures of excess mortality do not adequately 
account for varying age profiles of deaths between social groups. We measured 
years of life lost (YLL) attributable to the pandemic, directly or indirectly, 
comparing mortality across geographic and socioeconomic groups.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used national mortality registers in England and Wales, 
from 27 December 2014 until 25 December 2020, covering 3,265,937 deaths. YLLs 
(main outcome) were calculated using 2019 single year sex-specific life tables 
for England and Wales. Interrupted time-series analyses, with panel time-series 
models, were used to estimate expected YLL by sex, geographical region, and 
deprivation quintile between 7 March 2020 and 25 December 2020 by cause: direct 
deaths (COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases), cardiovascular disease and 
diabetes, cancer, and other indirect deaths (all other causes). Excess YLL 
during the pandemic period were calculated by subtracting observed from expected 
values. Additional analyses focused on excess deaths for region and deprivation 
strata, by age-group. Between 7 March 2020 and 25 December 2020, there were an 
estimated 763,550 (95% CI: 696,826 to 830,273) excess YLL in England and Wales, 
equivalent to a 15% (95% CI: 14 to 16) increase in YLL compared to the 
equivalent time period in 2019. There was a strong deprivation gradient in 
all-cause excess YLL, with rates per 100,000 population ranging from 916 (95% 
CI: 820 to 1,012) for the least deprived quintile to 1,645 (95% CI: 1,472 to 
1,819) for the most deprived. The differences in excess YLL between deprivation 
quintiles were greatest in younger age groups; for all-cause deaths, a mean of 
9.1 years per death (95% CI: 8.2 to 10.0) were lost in the least deprived 
quintile, compared to 10.8 (95% CI: 10.0 to 11.6) in the most deprived; for 
COVID-19 and other respiratory deaths, a mean of 8.9 years per death (95% CI: 
8.7 to 9.1) were lost in the least deprived quintile, compared to 11.2 (95% CI: 
11.0 to 11.5) in the most deprived. For all-cause mortality, estimated deaths in 
the most deprived compared to the most affluent areas were much higher in 
younger age groups, but similar for those aged 85 or over. There was marked 
variability in both all-cause and direct excess YLL by region, with the highest 
rates in the North West. Limitations include the quasi-experimental nature of 
the research design and the requirement for accurate and timely recording.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed strong socioeconomic and geographical 
health inequalities in YLL, during the first calendar year of the COVID-19 
pandemic. These were in line with long-standing existing inequalities in England 
and Wales, with the most deprived areas reporting the largest numbers in 
potential YLL.

BACKGROUND: The therapeutic landscape for spinal muscular atrophy has changed in 
the last few years, encompassing respiratory/motor function and life expectancy 
benefits. However, physicians still have the challenge of tailoring individuals' 
treatment to therapeutic goals, disease progression, patient/caregiver's 
preferences, and personal experience to achieve an optimal risk/benefit balance. 
This study aims to provide insight into the preferred treatment choices of 
pediatric neurologists managing spinal muscular atrophy in their daily practice 
and to recognize behavioral factors that may influence decision-making.
METHODS: This is a noninterventional, cross-sectional pilot study involving 50 
pediatric neurologists managing spinal muscular atrophy in Spain. We designed an 
online platform that contains 13 simulated case scenarios of common 
presentations of patients with spinal muscular atrophy. The primary study 
outcome will be treatment preferences according to the percentages of 
participants who select treatment initiation when recommended, switch therapies 
when there is evidence of disease progression, and select treatment 
discontinuation when disease progression puts patients outside treatment 
recommendation (11 case scenarios). Secondary outcomes include therapeutic 
inertia prevalence (11 case scenarios), herding phenomenon prevalence (2 case 
scenarios), care-related regret prevalence (specific questions) and intensity 
(10-item Regret Intensity Scale), occupational burnout prevalence 
(nonproprietary single-item measure), and risk preferences (uncertainty test and 
risk aversion assessment).
CONCLUSIONS: The study findings will contribute to better understand relevant 
factors associated with therapeutic decisions of pediatric neurologists in 
spinal muscular atrophy, identifying treatment preferences and evaluating the 
role of behavioral aspects such as therapeutic inertia, herding, regret, and 
workplace burnout.

A Fat-Promoting Botanical Extract From Artemisia scoparia Exerts Geroprotective 
Effects on Caenorhabditis elegans Life Span and Stress Resistance.

Like other biological processes, aging is not random but subject to molecular 
control. Natural products that modify core metabolic parameters, including fat 
content, may provide entry points to extend animal life span and promote healthy 
aging. Here, we show that a botanical extract from Artemisia scoparia (SCO), 
which promotes fat storage and metabolic resiliency in mice, extends the life 
span of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans by up to 40%. Notably, this 
life-span extension depends significantly on SCO's effects on fat; SCO-treated 
worms exhibit heightened levels of unsaturated fat, and inhibition of Δ9 
desaturases, which oversee biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, prevents 
SCO-dependent fat accumulation and life-span extension. At an upstream signaling 
level, SCO prompts changes to C. elegans fat regulation by stimulating nuclear 
translocation of transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO, an event that requires 
AMP-activated protein kinase under this condition. Importantly, animals treated 
with SCO are not only long-lived but also show improved stress resistance in 
late adulthood, suggesting that this fat-promoting intervention may enhance some 
aspects of physiological health in older age. These findings identify SCO as a 
natural product that can modify fat regulation for longevity benefit and add to 
growing evidence indicating that elevated fat can be prolongevity in some 
circumstances.

BACKGROUND: In the context of ever-growing health expenditure and limited 
resources, economic evaluations aid in making evidence-informed policy 
decisions. Cost-utility analysis (CUA) is often used, and CUA data synthesis is 
also desirable, but methodological issues are challenged. Hence, we aim to 
provide a step-by-step process to prepare the CUA data for meta-analysis.
METHODS: Data harmonisation methods were constructed specifically considering 
CUA methodology, including inconsistent reports, economic parameters, 
heterogeneity (i.e., country's income, time horizon, perspective, modelling 
approaches, currency, willingness to pay). An incremental net benefit (INB) and 
its variance were estimated and pooled across studies using a basic 
meta-analysis by COMER.
RESULTS: Five scenarios show how to obtain INB and variance with various 
reported data: Study reports the mean and variance (Scenario 1) or 95% 
confidence interval (Scenario 2) of ΔC, ΔE, and ICER for INB/variance 
calculations. Scenario 3: ΔC, ΔE, and variances are available, but not for the 
ICER; a Monte Carlo was used to simulate ΔC and ΔE data, variance and covariance 
can be then estimated leading INB calculation. Scenario-4: Only the CE plane was 
available, ΔC and ΔE data can be extracted; means of ΔC, ΔE, and 
variance/covariance can be estimated accordingly, leading to INB/variance 
estimates. Scenario-5: Only mean cost/outcomes and ICER are available but not 
for variance and the CE-plane. A variance INB can be borrowed from other studies 
which are similar characteristics, including country income, ICERs, 
intervention-comparator, time period, country region, and model type and inputs 
(i.e., discounting, time horizon).
CONCLUSION: Out data harmonisation and meta-analytic methods should be useful 
for researchers for the synthesis of economic evidence to aid policymakers in 
decision making.

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Assessing peri-implant marginal bone loss (MBL) and its 
risk factors with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) may clarify the risk 
factors for the all-on-4 (5 or 6) strategy and further improve its survival 
rate.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective clinical study was to evaluate the 
implant survival rate, MBL, and associated risk factors of all-on-4 (5 or 6) 
prostheses after 1 to 4 years of follow-up with CBCT.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 56 participants rehabilitated with 325 implants 
by using the all-on-4 (5 or 6) concept between October 2015 and December 2019 
were included. Outcome measures were cumulative implant survival (life-table 
analysis) and MBL. Four CBCT scans, a scan immediately after surgery (T0), a 
scan 1 year after surgery (T1), a scan 2 years after surgery (T2), and a scan 3 
to 4 years after treatment (T3), were obtained to evaluate the MBL. The Pearson 
correlation coefficient analysis and linear mixed models were performed to 
assess the potential risk factors for MBL (α=.05).
RESULTS: The implant survival rate was 99.38%, and the prosthesis survival rate 
was 100%. The reductions in the vertical buccal bone height (△VBBH) were 0.74 
±0.10 mm (T0-T1), 0.37 ±0.12 mm (T1-T2), and 0.15 ±0.14 mm (T2-T3). Except for 
T2-T3, the △VBBH showed a significant difference at T0-T1 and T1-T2 (P≤.05). The 
alterations in vertical mesial bone height (VMBH), vertical distal bone height 
(VDBH), and vertical lingual bone height (VLBH) were similar to the trend 
observed in VBBH. The △VBBH (T0-T3) was negatively correlated with the 
horizontal buccal bone thickness (HBBT) (T0) (r=-.394, P<.001). Linear mixed 
models revealed that factors such as smoking (P=.001), mandible implant site 
(P<.001), immediate implant (P=.026), tilted implant (P<.001), female sex 
(P=.003), systemic disease (P=.025), and bruxism (P=.022) negatively affected 
MBL. The cantilever length (CL) also had a negative effect on MBL around the 
implants at the distal extension (P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The high implant and prosthesis survival rates and low MBL 
confirmed the predictability of the all-on-4 (5 or 6) concept. Smoking, mandible 
implant site, systemic disease, bruxism, female sex, immediate implant, tilted 
implant, and CL were identified as potential risk factors for MBL.

BACKGROUND: As people with cystic fibrosis (CF) are living longer, men with CF 
increasingly face both general and disease-specific sexual and reproductive 
health (SRH) concerns. This study explored the SRH experiences and preferences 
of men with CF in health care in the era of widespread use of highly effective 
CF modulator therapies.
METHODS: We recruited men with CF aged 18 years and older to participate in a 
qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured telephone interviews to 
explore experiences and preferences related to CF SRH care. Two independent 
researchers coded interview transcripts and conducted content and thematic 
analysis using an inductive approach.
FINDINGS: We interviewed 24 participants (mean age 33.7 ± 11.8 years, range 
19-60) and identified five major themes: 1) CF SRH concerns, specifically 
infertility, can have negative impacts on men's perceptions of masculinity, 
relationships, and mental health; 2) As life expectancy increases, addressing 
male SRH is increasingly important in CF care; 3) Men with CF experience lack of 
SRH counseling and care; 4) Conversations about SRH should begin in early 
adolescence and be addressed regularly by CF providers in a stepwise fashion; 5) 
Men with CF value peer support and SRH information featuring the experiences of 
other men with CF.
CONCLUSIONS: Men with CF acknowledge the need for comprehensive CF care that 
includes SRH and value early, stepwise, provider-initiated SRH conversations. 
Future work should seek a broader understanding of the impact of SRH on the 
mental health of men with CF as these concerns can have significant effects on 
the lives and self-identities of men with CF.

BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation is an important component of patient critical 
care, but it adds expense to an already high-cost setting. This study evaluates 
the cost-utility of 2 modes of ventilation: proportional-assist ventilation with 
load-adjustable gain factors (PAV+ mode) versus pressure-support ventilation 
(PSV).
METHODS: We adapted a published Markov model to the Canadian hospital-payer 
perspective with a 1-year time horizon. The patient population modelled includes 
all patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation who have completed the 
acute phase of ventilatory support and have entered the recovery phase. Clinical 
and cost inputs were informed by a structured literature review, with the 
comparative effectiveness of PAV+ mode estimated via pragmatic meta-analysis. 
Primary outcomes of interest were costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
the (incremental) cost per QALY for patients receiving mechanical ventilation. 
Results were reported in 2017 Canadian dollars. We conducted probabilistic and 
scenario analyses to assess model uncertainty.
RESULTS: Over 1 year, PSV had costs of $50 951 and accrued 0.25 QALYs. Use of 
PAV+ mode was associated with care costs of $43 309 and 0.29 QALYs. Compared to 
PSV, PAV+ mode was considered likely to be cost-effective, having lower costs 
(-$7642) and increased QALYs (+0.04) after 1 year. In cost-effectiveness 
acceptability analysis, 100% of simulations would be cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY gained.
INTERPRETATION: Use of PAV+ mode is expected to benefit patient care in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) and be a cost-effective alternative to PSV in the 
Canadian setting. Canadian hospital payers may therefore consider how best to 
optimally deliver mechanical ventilation in the ICU as they expand ICU capacity.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the length and dispersion level of lifespan for the 
subnational populations in China, identify the urban-rural gap and sex 
differences, and analyse the contribution made by causes of death.
SETTING: Cause-specific mortality data extracted from the Chinese Disease 
Surveillance Points system, grouped by sex and urban/rural residence.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy and lifespan disparity are used to 
measure the length and dispersion level of lifespan, respectively. 
Cause-specific contributions are obtained by contrasting cause-deleted life 
expectancy and lifespan disparities with observed values.
PARTICIPANTS: Aggregated national data gathered from over 605 surveillance 
points across China, covering over 264 million people by 2016 (about 19.14% of 
the total Chinese population).
RESULTS: In the decade under observation, all subpopulations in China, by area 
and sex, experienced increases in life expectancy and decreases in lifespan 
disparity, while causes of deaths contributed differently. For example, based on 
the 2016 data, if cardiovascular diseases were deleted, there would be an 
increase in life expectancy that ranges from 5.59 years for urban males to 6.69 
years for rural females. However, also lifespan disparity would increase, 
ranging from 0.81 years for urban females to 1.37 years for rural males.
CONCLUSIONS: In China, the urban-rural gaps in both life expectancy and lifespan 
disparity are shrinking as the rural residents are catching up fast, while the 
gender gaps remain large, and even widening. Causes of death with different age 
distribution patterns contribute differently to the level and direction of the 
urban-rural and sex differentials in life expectancy and lifespan disparity. Sex 
differentials were observed in cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, 
lung and liver cancers, and external causes, while urban-rural differences were 
found in lung and breast cancers, and external causes.

BACKGROUND: Consistent with evolutionarily theorized costs of reproduction 
(CoR), reproductive history in women is associated with life expectancy and 
susceptibility to certain cancers, autoimmune disorders and metabolic disease. 
Immunological changes originating during reproduction may help explain some of 
these relationships.
METHODOLOGY: To explore the potential role of the immune system in female CoR, 
we characterized leukocyte composition and regulatory processes using DNA 
methylation (DNAm) in a cross-sectional cohort of young (20-22 years old) women 
differing in reproductive status.
RESULTS: Compared to nulliparity, pregnancy was characterized by differential 
methylation at 828 sites, 96% of which were hypomethylated and enriched for 
genes associated with T-cell activation, innate immunity, pre-eclampsia and 
neoplasia. Breastfeeding was associated with differential methylation at 1107 
sites (71% hypermethylated), enriched for genes involved in metabolism, immune 
self-recognition and neurogenesis. There were no significant differences in DNAm 
between nulliparous and parous women. However, compared to nullipara, pregnant 
women had lower proportions of B, CD4T, CD8T and natural killer (NK) cells, and 
higher proportions of granulocytes and monocytes. Monocyte counts were lower and 
NK counts higher among breastfeeding women, and remained so among parous women.
IMPLICATIONS: Our findings point to widespread differences in DNAm during 
pregnancy and lactation. These effects appear largely transient, but may 
accumulate with gravidity become detectable as women age. Nulliparous and parous 
women differed in leukocyte composition, consistent with more persistent effects 
of reproduction on cell type. These findings support transient (leukocyte DNAm) 
and persistent (cell composition) changes associated with reproduction in women, 
illuminating potential pathways contributing to CoR. Lay Summary: Evolutionary 
theory and epidemiology support costs of reproduction (CoR) to women's health 
that may involve changes in immune function. We report differences in immune 
cell composition and gene regulation during pregnancy and breastfeeding. While 
many of these differences appear transient, immune cell composition may remain, 
suggesting mechanisms for female CoR.

BACKGROUND: Longevity is increasing, accompanied by a rise in disability and 
chronic diseases with physical activity (PA) delaying disability, ensuring 
successful ageing (SA) and independent living in older adults.
AIM: This study aimed to determine objectively measure PA levels, health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL), life-space mobility and SA of older adults as well as 
their mutual associations.
SETTING: KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.
METHODS: A total of 210 older adults aged 65-92 years were purposively sampled 
and completed the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, the 
Life-Space Mobility, and Successful Ageing questionnaires. Physical activity 
levels were measured using an Omron Pedometer, which the participants wore for 
seven consecutive days.
RESULTS: The average number of steps taken per day for the 7 days was 2025, with 
98.6% of the entire study population classified as sedentary. The Vitality 
domain (one of 8 categorised) reflected the best health status (M = 59.9, s.d. ± 
18.8) with a significant 93% of the participants indicating that they had not 
visited places outside their immediate neighbourhood (p < 0.0005). A 
significant, negative association between the average number of steps taken in 7 
days and all three SA variables, namely, the physical (r = -0.152, p = 0.027), 
sociological (r = -0.148, p = 0.032) and psychological (r = -0.176, p = 0.010), 
and a significant, positive association with life-space mobility (r = 0.224, p = 
0.001) was noted.
CONCLUSION: The majority of the older adults were sedentary, affecting their 
HRQoL, life-space mobility, and SA negatively.
CONTRIBUTION: It is imperative to develop effective physical activity programmes 
to ensure successful ageing by improving older adults' quality of life and 
physical activity levels.

Significant gaps remain in understanding the response of plant reproduction to 
environmental change. This is partly because measuring reproduction in 
long-lived plants requires direct observation over many years and such datasets 
have rarely been made publicly available. Here we introduce MASTREE+, a data set 
that collates reproductive time-series data from across the globe and makes 
these data freely available to the community. MASTREE+ includes 73,828 
georeferenced observations of annual reproduction (e.g. seed and fruit counts) 
in perennial plant populations worldwide. These observations consist of 5971 
population-level time-series from 974 species in 66 countries. The mean and 
median time-series length is 12.4 and 10 years respectively, and the data set 
includes 1122 series that extend over at least two decades (≥20 years of 
observations). For a subset of well-studied species, MASTREE+ includes extensive 
replication of time-series across geographical and climatic gradients. Here we 
describe the open-access data set, available as a.csv file, and we introduce an 
associated web-based app for data exploration. MASTREE+ will provide the basis 
for improved understanding of the response of long-lived plant reproduction to 
environmental change. Additionally, MASTREE+ will enable investigation of the 
ecology and evolution of reproductive strategies in perennial plants, and the 
role of plant reproduction as a driver of ecosystem dynamics.

With the increased aging of the population, the extension of lifespan and the 
improvement of healthspan have become important. Our previous studies showed 
that the rice bran peptide KF-8 exerts an antioxidant effect in cells and mice. 
In this study, we evaluated the effects of KF-8 on the healthspan and lifespan 
of Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that KF-8 prolonged the life of nematodes 
and showed no reproductive toxicity towards nematodes. In addition, KF-8 
improved the motility of nematodes and resulted in an extended body length. 
Using hydrogen peroxide and juglone as stress inducers, we found that KF-8 
improved the anti-stress ability of nematodes. In addition, KF-8 upregulated the 
expressions of skn-1, daf-16 and antioxidant genes. In addition, the 
life-prolonging effect of KF-8 was lost in skn-1 mutant strains and daf-16 
mutant strains, indicating that KF-8 may exert anti-aging effects through skn-1 
and daf-16.

Mental disorders are the main cause of the young and economically active 
population worldwide and in Brazil to live with disabilities, being an important 
public health problem nowadays. The objective was to estimate the burden of 
mental disorders among professionals working to combat endemic diseases in a 
state in northeastern Brazil. Medical records of workers linked to the Brazilian 
Ministry of Health in Ceará State and fighting endemic diseases were surveyed 
and, from this, a historical cohort was made. The individual quantification of 
absenteeism by mental disorders (ICD F-chapter referring to mental disorders) 
was conducted considering a period of about 35 years, from admission (the 1980s) 
to December 2017. The global burden of disease was measured by the YLD indicator 
(years lost to disability). Considering that no deaths due to mental disorders 
were observed, the YLL indicator (years of life lost) was composed. The high 
mental disorders burden in this group of workers stands out, whose mood 
disorders, including depression, conferred a YLD equal to 18.6. This represents 
just over 18 years of work lived with a disability. Our findings reinforce the 
need to implement surveillance and health promotion actions in workers to 
promote effective interventions capable of contributing to the reduction of 
morbidity in workers and economically active people.

Accurate full-length sequencing of a purified unknown protein is still 
challenging nowadays due to the error-prone mass-spectrometry (MS)-based 
methods. De novo identified peptide sequence largely contain errors, undermining 
the accuracy of assembly. Bias on the detectability of the peptides also makes 
low-coverage regions, resulting in gaps. Although recent advances on 
multi-enzyme hydrolysis and algorithms showed complete assembly of full-length 
protein sequences in a few examples, the robustness in practical application is 
still to be improved. Here, inspired by genome assembly strategies, we 
demonstrate a contig-scaffolding strategy to assemble protein sequences with 
high robustness and accuracy. This strategy integrates multiple unspecific 
hydrolysis methods to minimize the bias in the hydrolysis process. After de novo 
identification of the peptides, our assembly algorithm, named Multiple Contigs & 
Scaffolding (MuCS), assembles the peptide sequences in a multistep, i.e., 
contig-scaffold manner, with error correction in each step. MS data from 
different hydrolysis experiments complement each other for robust contig 
extension and error correction. We demonstrated that our strategy on three 
proteins and three replications all reached 100% coverage (except one with 
98.85%) and 98.69-100% accuracy. It can also efficiently deal with the membrane 
protein, although the transmembrane region was missing due to the limitation of 
the MS. The three replicates reached 88.85-92.57% coverage and 97.57-100% 
accuracy. In sum, we provided a practical, robust, and accurate solution for 
full-length protein sequencing. The MuCS software is available at 
http://chi-biotech.com/mucs/.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to establish the effect of endoscopic 
endonasal surgery on longitudinal quality of life (QOL) in patients with 
anterior skull base meningioma.
METHODS: A prospectively collected cohort of consecutively operated anterior 
skull base meningiomas was analyzed. All cases were performed using the 
endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA). Sinonasal-specific and overall QOL were 
measured using the 22-Item Sinonasal Outcome Test and the Anterior Skull Base 
Questionnaire longitudinally (at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months) 
across the first postoperative year. The relationship between surgical and QOL 
outcomes to clinical and radiological characteristics was analyzed using 
multivariate regression.
RESULTS: Fifty cases were available, with a mean age of 61.5 years and female 
predominance (74.0%). Visual dysfunction and headache were the most common 
presenting symptoms, and tumors commonly took origin from the planum (46.0%), 
tuberculum (44.0%), and olfactory groove (24.0%). Median tumor volume was 4.6 
cm3. Visual improvement was noted in 73.1% of cases with preoperative field 
deficits, while nonimprovement was associated with greater tumor height (p = 
0.04). Gross-total resection was not possible in patients with 360° vessel 
encasement and high-grade cavernous sinus extension with ophthalmoplegia. 
Postoperative diabetes insipidus was observed only in cases with suprasellar 
extension. Sinonasal-specific QOL worsened transiently after surgery but 
returned to baseline levels after 3 weeks. Olfaction and taste scores returned 
to preoperative baseline scores within the year. Overall QOL at presentation was 
worse in those with larger tumors (p = 0.04) and visual failure (p = 0.04) and 
better in those presenting with headache (p = 0.04). Transient worsening of QOL 
was seen in the first 3 weeks, which returned to baseline by 6 weeks, and then 
improved to above preoperative levels at 6 months and beyond. Worse QOL at 
baseline (p = 0.01) and visual improvement (p = 0.01) predicted QOL improvement 
after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal QOL in anterior skull base meningioma has been 
examined for the first time. Endoscopic endonasal surgery improves overall QOL 
after a transient 3-week worsening due to the sinonasal morbidity of the 
approach. Visual function is intimately tied to QOL, with worse vision 
associated with worse preoperative QOL, and QOL improving in parallel with 
visual restoration after surgery. The EEA is associated with better visual 
outcomes and should be the preferred approach in accessible tumors.

OBJECTIVES: Without intervention, experts predict that antimicrobial resistance 
will rank among leading drivers of mortality by 2050. New drugs are desperately 
needed, but given the lengthy development timelines for antimicrobial research 
and development (R&D), existing economic incentives fail to support a robust 
pipeline of new products. This study aims to elicit the preferences of 
stakeholders for adequate antimicrobial R&D incentive programs.
METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted in which stakeholders 
(representatives from small or medium and large pharmaceutical companies, 
academics, clinicians, and policy makers) were asked in 12 choice tasks to 
select their preferred incentive combinations among two hypothetical options, 
differing in five attributes: form of monetary incentive, total amount of 
monetary incentive, market exclusivity extensions, transferable exclusivity 
extensions vouchers, and priority review vouchers. A subgroup analysis 
comprising only participants from the pharmaceutical industry was also 
conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 50 stakeholders (including 24 from the pharmaceutical 
industry) completed the survey in full. Participants preferred longer 
transferable exclusivity extensions and larger amounts of monetary rewards. The 
levels that were perceived as having the highest utility were $1 billion as 
total amount of incentives and transferable exclusivity extension for 18 months. 
The subgroup analysis provided similar findings.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that survey participants viewed transferable 
exclusivity vouchers for an 18-mo term and higher ($1 billion) monetary rewards 
as the preferred incentives to promote antimicrobial R&D. Further work is needed 
to design specific incentives and ensure they are implemented effectively.
