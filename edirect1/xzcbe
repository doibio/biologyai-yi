arterial disease. The superficial femoral and popliteal arteries are the most 
commonly diseased vessels in such patients and are being increasingly treated 
using endovascular revascularisation techniques. However, it is currently 
unknown whether drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons confer additional 
clinical benefits over more established techniques using plain balloons and bare 
metal stents, or whether they represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources.
METHODS: The BASIL-3 trial is a UK National Institute for Health Research, 
Health Technology Assessment Programme-funded, multicentre, randomised 
controlled trial (RCT) comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of plain 
balloon angioplasty with or without bail-out bare metal stenting, drug-coated 
balloon angioplasty with or without bail-out bare metal stenting, and primary 
stenting with drug-eluting stents for SLI secondary to femoro-popliteal disease. 
Patients with 'multilevel' disease may receive aorto-iliac and/or infrapopliteal 
treatments concurrently with their randomised femoro-popliteal intervention. The 
primary clinical outcome is amputation-free survival defined as the time to 
major (above the ankle) amputation of the index limb or death from any cause. 
The primary outcome for the economic analysis is cost per quality-adjusted life 
year. Secondary outcome measures include overall survival, major adverse limb 
events, major adverse cardiac events, relief of ischaemic pain, healing of 
tissue loss, and quality of life. The required sample size has been calculated 
at 861 participants (287 on each arm). These patients will be recruited over 
3 years and followed-up for between 2 and 5 years.
DISCUSSION: BASIL-3 is a pragmatic RCT designed to reflect current UK clinical 
practice. The results will inform decision-making regarding the appropriateness 
of funding the use of drug-coated balloons and drug-eluting stents, by the NHS, 
for the management of SLI due to femoro-popliteal disease.

Patients with Patau's syndrome (Trisomy 13) have multiple craniofacial, cardiac, 
neurological and renal anomalies with very less life expectancy. Among 
craniofacial anomalies cleft lip and palate are common. These craniofacial and 
cardiac anomalies present difficulties with anesthesia. We therefore describe 
the anesthetic management in the case of a Trisomy 13 child for operated for 
cleft lip at 10 months of age.

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women worldwide. One in eight 
women will develop the disease in her lifetime. Notwithstanding the incredible 
progress made in this field, BC still represents the second most common cause of 
cancer-related death in women. Targeted drugs have revolutionised breast cancer 
treatment and improved the prognosis as well as the life expectancy of millions 
of women. However, the phenomenon of primary and secondary pharmacological 
resistance is becoming increasingly evident, limiting the efficacy of these 
agents and calling for a better in-depth knowledge and understanding of the 
biology as well as the biochemical crosstalk underlying the disease. The advent 
of laboratory technologies in the clinical setting such as the routine use of 
next generation sequencing has allowed identification of new genetic alterations 
as well as providing a precise picture of the molecular landscapes of each 
tumour. Consequently, new specific therapeutic approaches are becoming available 
to minimise or delay the occurrence of resistance. In this review, we analyse 
the latest research and news from the clinical development side for each BC 
subtype.

BACKGROUND: The burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remains unclear in many 
regions of the world.
OBJECTIVES: The GBD (Global Burden of Disease) 2015 study integrated data on 
disease incidence, prevalence, and mortality to produce consistent, up-to-date 
estimates for cardiovascular burden.
METHODS: CVD mortality was estimated from vital registration and verbal autopsy 
data. CVD prevalence was estimated using modeling software and data from health 
surveys, prospective cohorts, health system administrative data, and registries. 
Years lived with disability (YLD) were estimated by multiplying prevalence by 
disability weights. Years of life lost (YLL) were estimated by multiplying 
age-specific CVD deaths by a reference life expectancy. A sociodemographic index 
(SDI) was created for each location based on income per capita, educational 
attainment, and fertility.
RESULTS: In 2015, there were an estimated 422.7 million cases of CVD (95% 
uncertainty interval: 415.53 to 427.87 million cases) and 17.92 million CVD 
deaths (95% uncertainty interval: 17.59 to 18.28 million CVD deaths). Declines 
in the age-standardized CVD death rate occurred between 1990 and 2015 in all 
high-income and some middle-income countries. Ischemic heart disease was the 
leading cause of CVD health lost globally, as well as in each world region, 
followed by stroke. As SDI increased beyond 0.25, the highest CVD mortality 
shifted from women to men. CVD mortality decreased sharply for both sexes in 
countries with an SDI >0.75.
CONCLUSIONS: CVDs remain a major cause of health loss for all regions of the 
world. Sociodemographic change over the past 25 years has been associated with 
dramatic declines in CVD in regions with very high SDI, but only a gradual 
decrease or no change in most regions. Future updates of the GBD study can be 
used to guide policymakers who are focused on reducing the overall burden of 
noncommunicable disease and achieving specific global health targets for CVD.

BACKGROUND: Half of all lifetime anxiety disorders emerge before age 12 years; 
however, access to evidence-based psychological therapies for affected children 
is poor. We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of two 
brief psychological treatments for children with anxiety referred to routine 
child mental health settings. We hypothesised that brief guided parent-delivered 
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) would be associated with better clinical 
outcomes than solution-focused brief therapy and would be cost-effective.
METHODS: We did this randomised controlled trial at four National Health Service 
primary child and mental health services in Oxfordshire, UK. Children aged 5-12 
years referred for anxiety difficulties were randomly allocated (1:1), via a 
secure online minimisation tool, to receive brief guided parent-delivered CBT or 
solution-focused brief therapy, with minimisation for age, sex, anxiety 
severity, and level of parental anxiety. The allocation sequence was not 
accessible to the researcher enrolling participants or to study assessors. 
Research staff who obtained outcome measurements were masked to group allocation 
and clinical staff who delivered the intervention did not measure outcomes. The 
primary outcome was recovery, on the basis of Clinical Global Impressions of 
Improvement (CGI-I). Parents recorded patient-level resource use. 
Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for use in cost-utility analysis were 
derived from the Child Health Utility 9D. Assessments were done at baseline 
(before randomisation), after treatment (primary endpoint), and 6 months after 
treatment completion. We did analysis by intention to treat. This trial is 
registered with the ISCRTN registry, number ISRCTN07627865.
FINDINGS: Between March 23, 2012, and March 31, 2014, we randomly assigned 136 
patients to receive brief guided parent-delivered CBT (n=68) or solution-focused 
brief therapy (n=68). At the primary endpoint assessment (June, 2012, to 
September, 2014), 40 (59%) children in the brief guided parent-delivered CBT 
group versus 47 (69%) children in the solution-focused brief therapy group had 
an improvement of much or very much in CGI-I score, with no significant 
differences between groups in either clinical (CGI-I: relative risk 1·01, 95% CI 
0·86-1·19; p=0·95) or economic (QALY: mean difference 0·006, -0·009 to 0·02; 
p=0·42) outcome measures. However, brief guided parent-delivered CBT was 
associated with lower costs (mean difference -£448; 95% CI -934 to 37; p=0·070) 
and, taking into account sampling uncertainty, was likely to represent a 
cost-effective use of resources compared with solution-focused brief therapy. No 
treatment-related or trial-related adverse events were reported in either group.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings show no evidence of clinical superiority of brief 
guided parent-delivered CBT. However, guided parent-delivered CBT is likely to 
be a cost-effective alternative to solution-focused brief therapy and might be 
considered as a first-line treatment for children with anxiety problems.

Metastasis of cancer makes up the vast majority of cancer-related deaths, and it 
usually initiates from tumor cells invasiveness and develops through tumor 
neovasculature. In this work, we have fabricated a CD44/neuropilin dual 
receptor-targeting nanoparticulate system (tLyP-1-HT NPs) with endogenous or FDA 
approved components for treating metastatic triple negative breast cancer 
(TNBC). The enhanced specific targeting of tLyP-1-HT NPs to both metastatic 
tumor cells and metastasis-supporting tumor neovasculature was contributed by 
means of CD44/neuropilin dual receptor-mediated interaction. The NPs not only 
effectively suppress the invasive capability of tumor cells themselves, but also 
significantly restrain the metastasis incidence via extravasation as well as the 
eventual colonization in lungs. In all the three types of TNBC-bearing mice 
models, orthotopic, post-metastasis and metastasis prevention models, the 
docetaxel-loaded tLyP-1-HT NPs exhibited markedly enhanced anti-tumor and 
anti-metastasis efficacy. The inhibitory rates of tLyP-1-HT NPs against 
orthotopic tumor growth and lung metastasis achieved 79.6% and 100%, 
respectively. The metastasis inhibition rate and life extension rate of the 
tLyP-1-HT NPs against post-pulmonary metastasis mice reached 85.1% and up to 
62.5%, respectively. All the results demonstrated the designed dual 
receptor-targeting multifunctional NPs hold great potential in treating 
metastatic TNBC and lung metastasis.

Hormones and Human and Nonhuman Primate Growth.

Bernstein RM.

The aim of this paper was to review information pertaining to the hormonal 
regulation of nonhuman primate growth, with specific focus on the growth hormone 
(GH)-insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis and adrenal androgens. Hormones of 
the GH-IGF axis are consistently associated with measures of growth - linear, 
weight, or both - during the growth period; in adulthood, concentrations of 
IGF-I, IGF-binding protein-3, and GH-binding protein are not associated with any 
measures of size. Comparing patterns of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA 
sulfate (DHEAS) may be especially relevant for understanding whether the 
childhood stage of growth and development is unique to humans and perhaps other 
apes. Genetic, hormonal, and morphological data on adrenarche in other nonhuman 
primate species suggest that this endocrine transition is delayed in humans, 
chimpanzees, and possibly gorillas, while present very early in postnatal life 
in macaques. This suggests that although perhaps permitted by an extension of 
the pre-adolescent growth period, childhood builds upon existing developmental 
substrates rather than having been inserted de novo into an ancestral growth 
trajectory. Hormones can provide insight regarding the evolution of the human 
growth trajectory.

"Naming and Framing": The Impact of Labeling on Health State Values for Multiple 
Sclerosis.

INTRODUCTION: Health state valuation is a key input in many economic evaluations 
that inform resource allocation across competing healthcare interventions. 
Empirical evidence has shown that, in preference elicitation surveys, 
respondents may value a health state differently if they are aware of the 
condition causing it ('labeling effects'). This study investigates the impact of 
including a multiple sclerosis (MS) label for valuation of MS health states.
METHODS: Health state values for MS were elicited using two internet-based 
surveys in representative samples of the UK population ( n = 1702; n = 1788). In 
one survey respondents were not informed that health states were caused by MS. 
The second survey included a condition label for MS. Surveys were identical in 
all other ways. Health states were described using a MS-specific 
eight-dimensional classification system (MSIS-8D), and the time trade-off 
valuation technique was used. Differences between values for labeled and 
unlabeled states were assessed using descriptive statistics and multivariate 
regression methods.
RESULTS: Adding a MS condition label had a statistically significant effect on 
mean health state values, resulting in lower values for labeled MS states v. 
unlabeled states. The data suggest that the MS label had a more significant 
effect on values for less severe states, and no significant effect on values for 
the most severe states. The inclusion of the MS label had a differential impact 
across the dimensions of the MSIS-8D. Across the MSIS-8D, predicted values 
ranged from 0.079 to 0.883 for unlabeled states, and 0.066 to 0.861 for labeled 
states.
CONCLUSION: Differences reported in health state values, using labeled and 
unlabeled states, demonstrate that condition labels affect the results of 
valuation studies, and can have important implications in decision-analytic 
modelling and in economic evaluations.

OBJECTIVE: To calculate and analyse the contributions of changes in mortality by 
age groups and selected causes of death to sex differences in life expectancy at 
birth in Spain from 1980 to 2012.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study with three time points (1980, 1995, and 2012). We 
used data from Human Cause-of-Death Database and Human Mortality Database. We 
use a decomposition method of the differences in life expectancy and gender 
differences in life expectancy from changes in mortality by 5-year age groups 
and causes of death between women and men.
RESULTS: From 1980 to 1995, the lower mortality of women from 25 years old, and 
the differences in mortality by HIV/AIDS, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary diseases contributed to the gap increase. From 1995 to 2012, greatest 
improvement in mortality of males under 74 years of age, and in improving male 
mortality from HIV/AIDS, acute myocardial infarction and traffic accidents 
contributed to the narrowing.
CONCLUSIONS: The difference in life expectancy at birth between men and women 
has decreased since 1995 due to a greater improvement in mortality from causes 
of death associated with risky behaviours and habits of the working age male 
population.

Plasma-mediated ab interno trabeculectomy with the trabectome was first approved 
by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004 for use in adult and pediatric 
glaucomas. Since then, increased clinical experience and updated outcome data 
have led to its expanded use, including a range of glaucomas and angle 
presentations, previously deemed to be relatively contraindicated. The main 
benefits are a high degree of safety, ease, and speed compared to traditional 
filtering surgery and tube shunts. The increasing burden of glaucoma and 
expanding life expectancy has resulted in demand for well-trained surgeons. In 
this article, we discuss the results of trabectome surgery in standard and 
nonstandard indications. We present training strategies of the surgical 
technique that include a pig eye model, and visualization exercises that can be 
performed before and at the conclusion of standard cataract surgery in patients 
who do not have glaucoma. We detail the mechanism of enhancing the conventional 
outflow pathway and describe methods of visualization and function testing.

Regular moderate exercise training is effective for the prevention and treatment 
of many common chronic diseases and improves cardiovascular health and life 
expectancy. However, long-term excessive endurance exercise may induce 
pathological structural remodeling of the heart. The athlete's heart is 
characterized by enlargement of cardiac chambers and eccentric hypertrophy with 
preserved myocardial function as normal physiological adaptations for prolonged 
and intense endurance physical stress. However, recent studies have demonstrated 
transient right ventricular dysfunction and elevation of cardiac biomarkers 
following intense endurance exercise. Repeated bouts of acute stress may cause 
patchy fibrosis of the right heart and interventricular septum, creating an 
arrhythmogenic substrate. The following review summarizes the current medical 
literature on the effects of intense and prolonged endurance exercise on cardiac 
structure and function and its clinical significance.

[THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN OBESITY AND CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE 
(COPD)].

Sciences, Ben-Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and 
treatable disease, with major respiratory and systemic expressions. Obesity is 
defined as a BMI>30 kg/ m2 and its prevalence has doubled in recent decades. The 
possible relationship of obesity to COPD, and its influence on respiratory 
pathophysiology, is considered a mystery. Studies show obesity to be a survival 
advantage among COPD patients, unlike in the general population, in which 
obesity correlates to decreased life expectancy. This study aims to assess the 
differences between obese and non-obese COPD patients. The main clinical aspect 
assessed is the number of COPDexacerbation related hospital admissions.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 323 COPD patients (95 
obese, 228 non-obese), who had been followed from 2003-2010 by the Pulmonology 
Institute at the Soroka Medical Center. We collected demographics, medical 
history, BMI, lung function tests, information about hospital admissions and 
mortality.
RESULTS: Non-obese COPD patients are 1.6 times more likely to be hospitalized 
due to COPD exacerbation. Additionally, women are 1.8 times more likely to be 
hospitalized due to COPD exacerbation. The FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratios, which were 
measured latest during the study period, were higher among obese COPD patients. 
There was no significant difference in mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and male gender act as protective factors against COPD 
exacerbations requiring hospitalization. Lung function test values are higher 
among obese patients. Despite this, obesity has no influence on COPD patient 
survival. Subsequent studies are required, in order to define nutrition 
recommendations and target weights for COPD patients.

Hospital, Manchester, UK.

Objective To assess the cost-effectiveness of strategies to increase cervical 
cancer screening uptake at first invitation (STRATEGIC trial). Methods We 
performed an economic analysis alongside the STRATEGIC trial, comparing each of 
seven novel interventions for improving cervical screening uptake with control 
general practices in Greater Manchester and Grampian (United Kingdom). A 
template was developed to measure the intervention costs. Trial estimates of 
screening uptake were combined with data from the literature to estimate 
healthcare costs of each intervention. The added lifetime costs and quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs) of attending cervical screening were estimated by a 
systematic literature review, with relevant results pooled and weighted by study 
quality. Trial results and estimated lifetime costs and benefits of screening 
were then combined in a decision analytic model, giving an incremental cost per 
QALY gained for each intervention. Uncertainty was addressed in probabilistic 
and univariate sensitivity analyses. Results Intervention costs per screening 
round per woman attending varied from about £1.20 (2014 UK) for the nurse 
navigator intervention to £62 for the unrequested HPV self-sampler kit. The 
meta-analysis revealed a lifetime discounted benefit from screening of 0.043 
QALYs per woman attending, at an additional lifetime discounted cost of £234. 
The incremental cost per QALY gained in all interventions was below £13,000. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested that only unrequested self-sampling 
and timed appointments have a high probability of being cost-effective. 
Conclusions Unrequested self-sampling and timed appointments are likely to be 
cost-effective interventions. Further research is required on the duration of 
effects and on implementing combinations of interventions.

States.

BACKGROUND: The approval of new immunotherapies has dramatically changed the 
treatment landscape of metastatic melanoma. These survival gains come with 
trade-offs in side effects and costs, as well as important considerations for 
third-party payer systems, physicians, and patients.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a Markov model to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
nivolumab, ipilimumab, and nivolumab-ipilimumab combination as firstline therapy 
in metastatic melanoma, while accounting for differential effectiveness in 
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive and negative patients.
METHODS: A 3-state Markov model (PD-L1 positive stable disease, PD-L1 negative 
stable disease, and progression and/or death) was developed using a U.S. 
societal perspective with a lifetime time horizon of 14.5 years. Transition 
probabilities were calculated from progression-free (PF) survival data reported 
in the CheckMate-067 trial. Costs were expressed in 2015 U.S. dollars and were 
determined using national sources. Adverse event (AE) management was determined 
using immune-related AE (irAE) data from CheckMate-067, irAE management guides 
for nivolumab and ipilimumab, and treatment guidelines. Utilities were obtained 
from published literature, using melanoma-specific studies when available, and 
were weighted based on incidence and duration of irAEs. Base case, one-way 
sensitivity, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Nivolumab-ipilimumab combination therapy was not the cost-effective 
choice ($454,092 per PF quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) compared with 
nivolumab monotherapy in a base case analysis at a willingness-to-pay threshold 
of $100,000 per PFQALY. Combination therapy and nivolumab monotherapy were 
cost-effective choices compared with ipilimumab monotherapy. PD-L1 positive 
status, utility of nivolumab and combination therapy, and medication costs 
contributed the most uncertainty to the model. In a population of 100% PD-L1 
negative patients, nivolumab was still the optimal treatment, but combination 
therapy had an improved incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $295,903 
per PFQALY. Combination therapy became dominated by nivolumab, when 68% of the 
sample was PD-L1 positive. In addition, the cost of ipilimumab would have to 
decrease to < $21,555 per dose for combination therapy to have an ICER < 
$100,000 per PFQALY and to < $19,151 (a 42% reduction) to be more cost-effective 
than nivolumab monotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab-ipilimumab combination therapy was not cost-effective 
compared with nivolumab monotherapy, which was the most cost-effective option. 
Professionals in managed care settings should consider the pharmacoeconomic 
implications of these new immunotherapies as they make value-based formulary 
decisions, and future cost-effectiveness studies are completed.

INTRODUCTION    Blood transfusion after transcatheter aortic valve implantation 
(TAVI) is frequently required owing to the high vulnerability of this patient 
group and procedure-related bleeding. OBJECTIVES    We assessed the impact of 
postprocedural blood transfusion and the age of transfused red blood cell (RBC) 
units on prognosis after TAVI. PATIENTS AND METHODS    This was a single-center, 
observational analysis conducted between the years 2009 and 2014. The adopted 
endpoints were early and long-term mortality after TAVI. The risk factors for 
mortality included in-hospital bleeding and vascular complications, the number 
of transfused RBC units, transfusion of at least 2 RBC units, the age of 
transfused RBCs, and standard deviation of the age of RBCs. RESULTS    The study 
included 178 patients (mean [SD] age, 80.07 [7.47] years; range, 55-91 years). 
The follow-up ranged between 1 month and 5.8 years (mean [SD], 20.1 [15.2] 
months) after discharge; 14 early deaths (7.8%) and 27 late deaths (16.5%) were 
noted. In-hospital bleeding and vascular complications increased the risk of 
early deaths (hazard ratio [HR], 2.113; 95% CI, 1.011-4.418; P = 0.046 and HR, 
2.265; 95% CI, 1.270-4.039; P = 0.005). Transfusion of younger RBCs (HR, 1.044; 
95% CI, 1.004-1.085; P = 0.028) and a greater discrepancy in the age of 
transfused RBCs (HR, 1.153; 95% CI, 1.042-1.275; P = 0.006) were positively 
correlated with the risk of late deaths only in a univariate analysis. A higher 
number of transfused RBC units was the only independent predictor of long-term 
mortality (HR, 1.149; 95% CI, 1.024-1.291; P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS    The higher 
number of RBC units transfused early after TAVI worsens long-term prognosis. 
Shorter-storage RBCs and a greater discrepancy in RBC age in multitransfused 
elderly patients after TAVI might have a deleterious effect on life expectancy.

The wide-spread dissemination of evidence-based programs that can improve health 
outcomes among older populations often requires an understanding of factors 
influencing community adoption of such programs. One such program is Texercise 
Select, a community-based health promotion program previously shown to improve 
functional health, physical activity, nutritional habits and quality of the life 
among older adults. This paper assesses the cost-effectiveness of Texercise 
Select in the context of supportive environments to facilitate its delivery and 
statewide sustainability. Participants were surveyed using self-reported 
instruments distributed at program baseline and conclusion. Program costs were 
based on actual direct costs of program implementation and included costs of 
recruitment and outreach, personnel costs and participant incentives. Program 
effectiveness was measured using quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, as 
well as health outcomes, such as healthy days, weekly physical activity and 
Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test scores. Preference-based EuroQol (EQ-5D) scores were 
estimated from the number of healthy days reported by participants and converted 
into QALYs. There was a significant increase in the number of healthy days (p < 
0.05) over the 12-week program. Cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $1374 to 
$1452 per QALY gained. The reported cost-effective ratios are well within the 
common cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000 for a gained QALY. Some 
sociodemographic differences were also observed in program impact and cost. 
Non-Hispanic whites experienced significant improvements in healthy days from 
baseline to the follow-up period and had higher cost-effectiveness ratios. 
Results indicate that the Texercise Select program is a cost-effective strategy 
for increasing physical activity and improving healthy dietary practices among 
older adults as compared to similar health promotion interventions. In line with 
the significant improvement in healthy days, physical activity and 
nutrition-related outcomes among participants, this study supports the use of 
Texercise Select as an intervention with substantial health and cost benefits.

INTRODUCTION: Randomised controlled trials have shown that targeted therapies 
like sunitinib are effective in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Little 
is known about the current use of these therapies, and their associated costs 
and effects in daily clinical practice. We estimated the real-world 
cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies comprising one or more 
sequentially administered drugs.
METHODS: Analyses were performed using patient-level data from a Dutch 
population-based registry including patients diagnosed with primary mRCC from 
January 2008 to December 2010 (i.e., treated between 2008 and 2013). The full 
disease course of these patients was estimated using a patient-level simulation 
model based on regression analyses of the registry data. A healthcare sector 
perspective was adopted; total costs included healthcare costs related to mRCC. 
Cost-effectiveness was expressed in cost per life-year and cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was 
conducted to estimate the overall uncertainty surrounding cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: In current daily practice, 54% (336/621) of all patients was treated 
with targeted therapies. Most patients (84%; 282/336) received sunitinib as 
first-line therapy. Of the patients receiving first-line therapy, 30% (101/336) 
also received second-line therapy; the majority was treated with everolimus 
(40%, 40/101) or sorafenib (28%, 28/101). Current treatment practice (including 
patients not receiving targeted therapy) led to 0.807 QALYs; mean costs were 
€58,912. This resulted in an additional €105,011 per QALY gained compared to not 
using targeted therapy at all. Forty-six percent of all patients received no 
targeted therapy; of these patients, 24% (69/285) was eligible for sunitinib. If 
these patients were treated with first-line sunitinib, mean QALYs would improve 
by 0.062-0.076 (where the range reflects the choice of second-line therapy). 
This improvement is completely driven by the health gain seen amongst patients 
eligible to receive sunitinib but did not receive it, who gain 0.558-0.684 QALYs 
from sunitinib. Since additional costs would be €7,072-9,913, incremental costs 
per QALY gained are €93,107-111,972 compared to current practice.
DISCUSSION: Health can be gained if more treatment-eligible patients receive 
targeted therapies. Moreover, it will be just as cost-effective to treat these
