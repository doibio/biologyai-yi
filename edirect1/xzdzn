variety of short-term outcomes in offspring, but long-term effects are rarely 
examined. The present study evaluated the impact of advanced paternal age on 
offspring's longevity.
METHODS: We studied the effect of paternal reproductive age on the lifespan of 
male offspring using a Chinese genealogy data set that spans 226 years of the 
Qing Dynasty (1683-1909). Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analyses of 1274 
men with survival data were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of advanced 
parental age at reproduction. We also evaluated whether the lifespan of brothers 
differed when they were born to the same parents at different ages.
RESULTS: In models adjusted for maternal age, advanced paternal age was 
negatively associated with the lifespan of male offspring. Individuals born to 
fathers aged >40 years had a 32 % higher HR of a lifespan shorter than those 
born to fathers aged 25-29 years (adjusted HR 1.320, 95 % CI: 1.066-1.634). The 
adjusted HR for offspring born to fathers aged 35-39 years was 1.232 (95 % CI: 
1.013-1.500). Older brothers born to fathers aged 20-34 years had a 
significantly lower risk of a reduced lifespan compared with their younger 
brothers with fathers aged ≥35 years at reproduction (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Advanced paternal age at reproduction is a negative factor for male 
offspring's life expectancy. With the sustained increase in paternal age over 
the past generation, further investigation is warranted into the impact on birth 
outcomes and public health.

Alternations of redox metabolism have been associated with the extension of 
lifespan in roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, caused by moderate mitochondrial 
dysfunction, although the underlying signalling cascades are largely unknown. 
Previously, we identified transcriptional factor Krüppel-like factor-1 (KLF-1) 
as the main regulator of cytoprotective longevity-assurance pathways in the C. 
elegans long-lived mitochondrial mutants. Here, we show that KLF-1 translocation 
to the nucleus and the activation of the signalling cascade is dependent on the 
mitochondria-derived hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced during late developmental 
phases where aerobic respiration and somatic mitochondrial biogenesis peak. We 
further show that mitochondrial-inducible superoxide dismutase-3 (SOD-3), 
together with voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC-1), is required for the 
life-promoting H2O2 signalling that is further regulated by peroxiredoxin-3 
(PRDX-3). Increased H2O2 release in the cytoplasm activates the p38 MAPK 
signalling cascade that induces KLF-1 translocation to the nucleus and the 
activation of transcription of C. elegans longevity-promoting genes, including 
cytoprotective cytochrome P450 oxidases. Taken together, our results underline 
the importance of redox-regulated signalling as the key regulator of 
longevity-inducing pathways in C. elegans, and position precisely timed 
mitochondria-derived H2O2 in the middle of it.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a plasma protein that is one of the most expressed 
proteins in acute phase inflammation cases. It is a well-known biomarker for 
inflammatory disorders. There is a significant correlation between increasing 
CRP concentration and the risk of being exposed to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) 
and sepsis; thus, monitoring and quantifying CRP levels in a simple, 
inexpensive, and quick manner can improve clinical diagnostics and help prevent 
major inflammatory conditions. Here a nanobiosensor was developed, benefiting 
from the LSPR property of gold-nanorod (GNR) to measure CRP concentration. 
Nanorods were fabricated using One-pot synthesis by trimethyl ammonium bromide 
(CTAB) as a surfactant. This method provides the advantage of both step and time 
reduction in synthesis and decreases the contamination probability of nanorods 
as the products. The nanorods were characterized using TEM with an average size 
of (24 ± 1 nm) × (5 ± 1 nm) and a typical aspect ratio of ∼4.9. The surface of 
the rods was modified with a specific aptamer for the target protein, and the 
LSPR shifts due to the gold nanorod's refractive index change as the result of 
protein interaction with the biosensor investigated using a 100-900 nm UV 
absorption device. The results indicated that the nanobiosensor could respond to 
different CRP concentrations within 30 min. The selectivity test has shown 
nonresponsive results of nanobiosensor to BSA and TNF-α proteins which are used 
to evaluate the biosensor behavior in non-target proteins. The detection limit 
was evaluated at 2 nM, and the sensor's linear response ranged between 2 - 
20 nM.

BACKGROUND: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) significantly reduces women's 
quality of life (QoL). Use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is increasing in 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), thus standardization is important to ensure 
reporting completeness. We aim to evaluate completeness of reporting of RCTs for 
surgical management of SUI in women based on an adaptation of the Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials statement with PRO extension (CONSORT-PRO).
STUDY DESIGN: A literature search was conducted and all RCTs meeting inclusion 
criteria were evaluated using the CONSORT-PRO adapted checklist and the Cochrane 
Collaboration risk of bias assessment tool (RoB). We calculated a completion 
percentage score for each trial's adherence to the CONSORT-PRO adapted checklist 
and used bivariate regression analysis to examine associations between trial 
characteristics and completion percentage scores.
RESULTS: Forty-three RCTs underwent data extraction and analysis. Mean 
completion percentage of the CONSORT-PRO was 50.53% (SD = 15.63). A total of 38 
(of 43; 88.37%) RCTs received an RoB 2.0 rating of "some concern." RCTs with 
follow-up longer than 3 months had statistically significantly higher 
CONSORT-PRO completion: 3-6 months (p = .049), 6-12 months (p = .009), more than 
12 months (p = .021). Compared with studies without a conflict of interest 
statement, studies reporting a conflict of interest (p < .001) or reporting no 
conflict of interest (p = .048) had higher reporting completeness.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest many RCTs addressing surgical management of SUI 
in women have poor adherence to CONSORT-PRO reporting guidelines. Improving 
reporting completeness through adherence to the CONSORT-PRO checklist can better 
inform clinical decision making and improve QoL.

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a complex, heritable and polygenic neuropsychiatric 
disease, which disables the patients as well as decreases their life expectancy 
and quality of life. Common and rare variants studies on SCZ subjects have 
provided >100 genomic loci that hold importance in the context of SCZ 
pathophysiology. Transcriptomic studies from clinical samples have informed 
about the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and non-coding RNAs in SCZ 
patients. Despite these advancements, no causative genes for SCZ were found and 
hence SCZ is difficult to recapitulate in animal models. In the last decade, 
induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)-based models have helped in understanding 
the neural phenotypes of SCZ by studying patient iPSC-derived 2D neuronal 
cultures and 3D brain organoids. Here, we have aimed to provide a simplistic 
overview of the current progress and advancements after synthesizing the 
enormous literature on SCZ genetics and SCZ iPSC-based models. Although further 
understanding of SCZ genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms using these 
technological advancements is required, the recent approaches have allowed to 
delineate important cellular mechanisms and biological pathways affected in SCZ.

Currently, the life expectancy of people living with the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) and the general population are similar. Hypertension is a major 
public health issue in Africa and is largely underdiagnosed. Most HIV-infected 
individuals, especially those on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) have 
hypertension. Our project aims to determine the prevalence of hypertension and 
associated factors amongst HIV-infected adults treated by ART in Burundi. A 
cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV-infected subjects over the age of 
20, managed in five healthcare centers for people living with HIV (PLWH). The 
World Health Organization STEPWISE survey and anthropometric measurements were 
employed. Blood pressure was measured according to the ESC 2018 recommendations. 
1 250 HIV-infected patients aged between 35.4 and 50.2 years were included 
(18.4% men). The prevalence of hypertension was 17.4% (95% CI 13.2-22.1). 
Approximately 47.25% of HIV patients with hypertension were previously 
undiagnosed. Other factors were associated with HTN, such as being overweight 
(OR 2.88; 95% CI 1.46-5.62), obesity (OR 2.65; 95% CI 1.27-5.55), longer 
duration of HIV infection: ≥ 10 years (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.14-3.20), diabetes (OR 
2.1; 95% CI 1.37-3.32) and age (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.09-1.14). Despite their young 
age, almost 20% of HIV-ART treated patients had hypertension, 50% of these were 
undiagnosed. Blood pressure monitoring is crucial in these patients, especially 
those identified as high-risk, with prompt life and disability-saving 
interventions.

OBJECTIVES: The International Valuation Protocol for the valuation of the 
EQ-5D-Y-3L provides baseline guidance, but country-specific context is also 
important. This study aimed to obtain US stakeholders' input on key 
considerations for youth valuation in the US.
METHODS: A total of 14 stakeholders representing various backgrounds were 
identified via the investigators' networks. A 2-h online meeting was held to 
discuss (1) the need for a US value set for the EQ-5D-Y-3L; (2) willingness to 
pay more for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains for children versus adults; 
(3) sampling strategies; (4) framing perspectives; and (5) other challenges. The 
session was recorded, transcribed, and summarized.
RESULTS: Several stakeholders supported paying more for QALY gains for children 
in recognition of their potential future contributions to society, as well as to 
avoid potential undervaluation and promote access to innovative treatments. 
Concerns regarding possible double counting, lack of data to showcase long-term 
benefits, and dangers of paying more for certain subgroups were also expressed. 
Most of the stakeholders felt that adolescents could relate to a 10-year-old's 
perspective better than adults and were capable of self-completing valuation 
tasks, and thus should be directly included in the valuation study. There were 
concerns that adults would be inconsistent in their views about a 10-year-old, 
partly depending on their status as a parent.
CONCLUSIONS: US stakeholders provided insights relevant to youth valuation in a 
US context and were open to continued dialogue with investigators. This study 
could be useful to investigators who are conducting youth valuation studies in 
different countries and seeking stakeholder input.

BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal cancers are a critical global cancer burden, and 
tracking their trends would inform the health policies.
METHODS: Trends of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability 
(YLDs) caused by three common gastrointestinal cancers were estimated using 
annual percentage change (EAPC) and age-standardized rate (ASR). Data was 
extracted from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019.
RESULTS: The ASR per 100,000 population-year of YLLs caused by esophageal 
cancer, stomach cancer, and colorectal cancer were 137.98, 264.15, and 282.51 in 
2019, respectively. Their overall trends of YLLs declined during 1990-2019, with 
the respective EAPCs being - 1.42 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: - 1.71 
to - 1.13), - 2.13 (95%CI: - 2.29 to - 1.96), and - 0.25 (95%CI: - 0.30 
to - 0.19). Meanwhile, decreasing trends of YLDs caused by esophageal cancer and 
stomach cancer were observed, in which the EAPCs were - 0.67 (95%: - 0.94 
to - 0.40) and - 0.85 (95%CI: - 0.97 to - 0.73), respectively. However, an 
increasing trend was seen in that of colorectal cancer (EAPC = 0.83, 95%CI: 0.77 
to 0.89). Among countries, the largest decrease in trend of YLLs was that of 
stomacher cancer in the Republic of Korea (EAPC =  - 5.88, 95%CI: - 6.07 
to - 5.69). However, pronounced increasing trend of YLDs caused by colorectal 
cancer occurred in China (EAPC = 4.40, 95%CI: 4.07 to 4.72).
CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing trends in YLLs and YLDs caused by esophageal cancer, 
stomach cancer, and colorectal cancer were observed in most countries and 
regions, indicating that the great progress had been achieved over the past 
decades. However, the cancer burden was geographical heterogeneity, and 
cost-effective measures were still required to decline the burden caused by 
gastrointestinal cancers.

Cross-sectional data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe 
(SHARE) are a common source of information in comparative studies of population 
health in Europe. In the largest part, these data are based on longitudinal 
samples, which are subject to health-specific attrition. This implies that 
estimates of population health based on cross-sectional SHARE datasets are 
biased as the data are selected on the outcome variable of interest. We examine 
whether cross-sectional datasets are selected based on health status. We compare 
estimates of the prevalence of full health, healthy life years at age 50 (HLY), 
and rankings of 18 European countries by HLY based on the observed, 
cross-sectional SHARE wave 7 datasets and full samples. The full samples consist 
of SHARE observed and attrited respondents, whose health trajectories are 
imputed by microsimulation. Health status is operationalized across the global 
index of limitations in activities of daily living (GALI). HLY stands for life 
expectancy free of activity limitations. Cross-sectional datasets are selected 
based on health status, as health limitations increase the odds of attrition 
from the panel in older age groups and reduce them in younger ones. In older age 
groups, the prevalence of full health is higher in the observed cross-sectional 
data than in the full sample in most countries. In most countries, HLY is 
overestimated based on the cross-sectional data, and in some countries, the 
opposite effect is observed. While, due to the small sample sizes of national 
surveys, the confidence intervals are large, the direction of the effect is 
persistent across countries. We also observe shifts in the ranking of countries 
according to HLYs of the observed data versus the HLYs of the full sample. We 
conclude that estimates on population health based on cross-sectional datasets 
from longitudinal, attrited SHARE samples are over-optimistic.

Objective: To analyze the impact of malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular 
diseases, respiratory diseases and diabetes (four major chronic diseases) on the 
increase of life expectancy of local population in Ji'nan during 2015-2020. 
Methods: Based on 2015-2020 cause-of-death surveillance information and 
population data of Ji'nan, we used abbreviated life expectancy table and Arriaga 
decomposition method to analyze the overall and disease specific contributions 
of four major chronic diseases to the increase of life expectancy, and the 
gender and age specific contributions of mortality rates of four major chronic 
diseases to the increase of life expectancy of local population from 2015 to 
2020. Results: Life expectancy of the local population in Ji'nan increased by 
1.59 years from 2015 to 2020. The decline in mortality rates of the four major 
chronic diseases contributed 1.25 years, with a contribution of 78.62%. The life 
expectancy in men increased by 1.66 years, with a contribution of 1.18 years 
from the decline in mortality rate of four major chronic diseases, and the life 
expectancy in women increased by 1.52 years, with a contribution of 1.35 years 
from the decline in mortality of four major chronic diseases. The declines in 
the mortality rates of malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory 
diseases and diabetes contributed 0.42, 0.62, 0.20, and 0.01 years to life 
expectancy, respectively. The decline mortality rate of gastric cancer 
contributed more to the increase of life expectancy compared with lung cancer. 
The increase in the mortality rate of hypertensive heart disease resulted in a 
negative contribution. Asthma and diabetes contributed very little to the 
increase of life expectancy. Conclusions: The increase in the life expectancy of 
local population in Ji'nan from 2015 to 2020 was mainly attributed to the 
decline in mortality of four major chronic diseases. It is necessary to pay 
close attention to the diseases which contributed very little or even had 
negative contribution to the increase of life expectancy, such as lung cancer, 
diabetes and hypertensive heart disease.

Objective: To analyze the influencing factors of healthy life expectancy (HLE). 
Methods: Seven Chinese and English databases were used for the retrieval of 
related literatures published by May 7, 2022 to identify influencing factors of 
HLE, including diseases and injuries and their risk factors. Based on the 
ecological model of health determinants, this study classifies the risk factors 
of diseases and injuries into five levels: personal characteristics, individual 
behavior and lifestyle, social network, living and working conditions, and 
macroscopic socio-economic, cultural and environmental conditions. Contents of 
research area, HLE indicators, research population, influencing factors, data 
sources and results were extracted. The frequencies of reported documents of 
different HLE indicators and influencing factors of different dimensions were 
visualized by using evidence map, and the empirical studies of four 
authoritative English medical journals and Chinese core medical journals were 
further compared and described. Results: A total of 90 studies were selected, in 
which 26 were conducted in China (28.9%). Fifty-three studies are about diseases 
and injuries in the first dimension, and all of them have studied 
non-communicable diseases, accounting for the highest proportion (58.9%). There 
were 77 studies about the analysis on the determinants of health at five levels 
by an ecological model, all the studies reported multi-level results. Among 
them, 53 studies reported personal characteristics (58.9%), 47 studies reported 
individual behavior and lifestyle (52.2%), 10 studies reported social networks 
(11.1%), 35 studies reported living and working environment (38.9%), 8 studies 
reported social economy, culture status and environment condition (8.9%). The 
literatures about HLE published by 4 authoritative English medical journals and 
21 Chinese core medical journals in recent three years were selected. 
Non-communicable diseases and personal characteristics were the top two most 
commonly studied factors of HLE, and 11 (52.3%) and 12 (57.1%) studies reported 
these two kinds of factors respectively. The most important factor contributing 
to the global disability-adjusted life years of non-communicable diseases was 
individual behavior and lifestyle, which was the most changeable factor. 
Conclusions: In recent three years, studies involving influencing factors of HLE 
were mainly non-communicable diseases and personal characteristics. In the 
future, individual behavior, lifestyle and working environment should be 
strengthened.

Evidence supporting the effectiveness of pancreatic cancer (PC) screening is 
scant. Most clinical studies concern small populations with short follow-up 
durations. Mathematical models are useful to estimate long-term effects of PC 
screening using short-term indicators. This systematic review aims to evaluate 
the impact of PC screening on life expectancy (LE) in model-based studies. 
Therefore, we searched four databases (Embase, Medline, Web-of-science, 
Cochrane) until 30 May 2022 to identify model-based studies evaluating the 
impact of PC screening on LE in different risk populations. Two authors 
independently screened identified papers, extracted data and assessed the 
methodological quality of studies. A descriptive analysis was performed and the 
impact of screening strategies on LE of different risk groups was reported. Our 
search resulted in 419 studies, of which eight met the eligibility criteria 
(mathematical model, PC screening, LE). Reported relative risks (RR) for PC 
varied from 1 to 70. In higher risk individuals (RR > 5), annual screening (by 
imaging with 56% sensitivity for HGD/early stage PC) predicted to increase LE of 
screened individuals by 20 to 260 days. In the general population, one-time PC 
screening was estimated to decrease LE (2-110 days), depending on the test 
characteristics and treatment mortality risk. In conclusion, although the models 
use different and sometimes outdated or unrealistic assumptions, it seems that 
PC screening in high-risk populations improves LE, and that this gain increases 
with a higher PC risk. Updated model studies, with data from large clinical 
trials are necessary to predict the long-term effect of PC screening more 
accurately.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of single-use hydrophilic-coated 
intermittent catheters (HCICs) versus single-use uncoated intermittent catheters 
(UICs) for urinary catheterization.
METHODS: The evaluation took a UK national health service (NHS) perspective. The 
population of interest were people using intermittent catheters, with either a 
spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis. A Markov model was developed that 
estimated costs and clinical evidence over the lifetime of a hypothetical cohort 
and applied health-related quality-of-life estimates. Model inputs were sourced 
from published evidence, including a network meta-analysis to inform the 
treatment effect (reduction in catheter-associated urinary tract infections 
[CAUTIs]), and were supported by expert opinion. The model outputs included 
per-patient lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER). Event counts were also produced.
RESULTS: Using HCICs instead of UICs could prevent seven CAUTI events per 
patient over a lifetime horizon (1.8 requiring secondary care). Overall, 
lifetime use of HCICs is £3,183 more expensive than use of UICs per patient. 
However, for these additional costs, 0.55 QALYs are gained. The ICER is £5,755 
per additional QALY gained. Key drivers of the model results were identified and 
subject to sensitivity analyses. The results were found to be robust to 
parameter uncertainty.
CONCLUSION: HCICs are likely to be a cost-effective alternative to UICs, a 
result driven by substantial reductions in the number of CAUTIs. Their adoption 
across clinical practice could avoid a substantial number of infections, freeing 
up resources in the NHS and reducing antibiotic use in urinary catheter users.

Plain Language Summary: A new economic model was developed from a United Kingdom 
National Health Service perspective, to explore whether hydrophilic-coated 
intermittent catheters would be “worth” introducing for intermittent catheter 
users with either a spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis. More specifically, 
costs were analyzed alongside clinical evidence and health-related 
quality-of-life data to investigate whether hydrophilic-coated intermittent 
catheters would offer a notable health benefit when compared with uncoated 
intermittent catheters for the assessed population, whilst keeping costs to the 
National Health Service sufficiently low. Model inputs were sourced from 
published evidence where possible, and experts were consulted otherwise. The 
results showed that, whilst lifetime use of hydrophilic-coated intermittent 
catheters is £3,183 more expensive than use of uncoated intermittent catheters 
per patient, the health benefit with hydrophilic-coated intermittent catheters 
offsets these costs, by definition a cost-effective result. This means that 
hydrophilic-coated intermittent catheters are likely to be a cost-effective 
alternative to uncoated intermittent catheters. Their adoption across clinical 
practice could avoid a substantial number of infections, thereby freeing up 
healthcare resources in the National Health Service and reducing antibiotic use 
in urinary catheter users.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic skin disease affecting infants, 
adolescents, and adults. The cause of SD is not known. Previous studies 
suggested genetic and environmental roles in the etiology of the disease. 
However, epidemiological data on SD have been scarce. The study aimed to analyze 
the burden of SD. We analyzed national and macro-regional SD data from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019) resources. Regression analysis 
was performed to compute the annual percent change (APC) and identify 
significant changes in the temporal prevalence trends of SD from 1990 to 2019 
relative to age-standardized and crude world population. Pearson correlation 
test was used to evaluate the association between prevalence and 
Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) at a macro-regional level. Over the years, from 
1990 to 2019, the age-standardized prevalence of SD had a slow growth trend, 
with an APC of + 0.10% (p < 0.001), while crude prevalence has been showing a 
greater increase with an APC of +0.32 (p < 0.001). In 2019, the regions with the 
highest prevalence in the world were Sub-Saharan Africa and North America, while 
Central Asia and Eastern Europe showed the lowest prevalence. Prevalence 
distribution by age showed an increase starting at the age class 60-64, then 
peaked at the age class 80-84, and a subsequent decrease. Males appeared to be 
slightly more affected than females at older ages. Correlation patterns between 
prevalence and SDI were not significant. In this study, we found that the 
prevalence of SD varies between the geographical regions. However, the overall 
age-standardized prevalence of the disease has been stable throughout 30 years 
(1990-2019).

OBJECTIVE: Compassion is widely regarded as an important component of 
high-quality healthcare. However, its conceptualization, use, and associated 
outcomes in the care of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) have not been 
synthesized. The aim of this review is to scope the peer reviewed academic 
literature on the conceptualization, use, and outcomes associated with 
compassion in the care of PwMS.
METHODS: Studies were eligible for inclusion if reporting primary research data 
from quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods studies on the 
conceptualization, use, and outcomes associated with compassion in the care of 
PwMS. Relevant studies were identified through searching five electronic 
databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) in January 
2022. We followed the guidance outlined in the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) 
manual for evidence synthesis, and also referred to the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews 
Checklist (PRISMA-ScR). Simple descriptive methods were used to chart 
quantitative findings, and a descriptive approach with basic content analysis 
was employed to describe qualitative findings.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included (participant n = 1722): eight 
quantitative, six mixed-methods, one exclusively qualitative. Synthesized 
qualitative data revealed that PwMS conceptualize compassion as involving 
self-kindness, agency, and acceptance. PwMS report using self-compassion in 
response to unpleasant sensations and experiences. Quantitative findings suggest 
that compassion may mediate benefit finding, reduced distress, and improved 
quality of life (QoL) in PwMS, that those with the condition may become more 
compassionate through time, and that self-compassion specifically can be 
increased through training in mindfulness. In this context, greater 
self-compassion in PwMS correlates with less depression and fatigue, better 
resilience and QoL. Among studies, self-compassion was the most common outcome 
measure for PwMS.
CONCLUSIONS: A nascent literature exists on the conceptualization, use, and 
outcomes associated with compassion in the care of PwMS. Further research is 
required to better understand what compassion means to PwMS and those caring for 
them. However, self-compassion can be cultivated among PwMS and may be helpful 
for managing unpleasant somatic symptoms and in benefit finding. Impact on other 
health outcomes is less clear. The use of compassion by health care providers in 
the care of PwMS is unstudied.

The Future of Nursing 2020 to 2030: Charting a Path to Achieve Health Equity 
(2021) highlights inequality throughout healthcare. People of color exhibit 
lower life expectancy levels than their White counterparts. LGTBQ individuals 
are 2.7 times more likely than heterosexuals to experience a violent crime . 
Lower-income individuals report their health status at lower levels than 
high-income earners. Health and healthcare in America are not equitable. With 
only 58% of healthcare organizations considering "Heath Equity" as a top-three 
priority, there is a substantial and dire need for innovation to fill the gap 
between the healthcare that is needed and what is being provided. This article 
explores the Build. Measure. Share. model for healthcare innovation as an 
approach to encourage and empower healthcare professionals to take meaningful 
steps toward creating an equitable and just health system.

OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to estimate the need for palliative care in an 
urban resettlement colony of Dakshinpuri Extension, New Delhi.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a community-based cross-sectional study conducted 
in New Delhi. We trained four multipurpose workers to screen the households 
during their routine household-to-household visits. The screening for the need 
for palliative care was done using three questions - that is, (1) presence of a 
bedridden patient or (2) person in need for help in activities of daily living 
or (3) not able to go for work due to any physical chronic illness. If the 
answer to any of the three screening questions was yes for any member in a 
household, then these households were visited by a community physician trained 
in palliative care and a medical social service officer to confirm the need for 
palliative care. Patients were administered a semi-structured questionnaire 
containing the sociodemographic details and an assessment of disease status and 
review of health records was done. The patient and his/her caregiver were also 
assessed for awareness regarding palliative care.
RESULTS: A total of 2028 households were screened and the need for palliative 
care was found to be 1.5/1000 population (95% CI: 0.9-2.1). The mean age (SD) of 
patients who need palliative care was 60 years (SD-12.9). The common diseases 
which required palliative care were stroke with a focal neurological deficit 
(45.8%), osteoarthritis with marked dependence (20.8%) and cancer (12.5%). None 
of the patients was receiving palliative care as patients and their caregivers 
were not aware of the term palliative care/end of life care/home care for 
bedridden people/community-based care.
CONCLUSION: The need for palliative care in an urban resettlement colony of 
North India was found to be 1.1/1000 population. Further studies are required to 
estimate the need for palliative care in North India.

BACKGROUND: People with schizophrenia have a high premature mortality risk. 
Obesity is a key potential underlying risk factor that is relatively unevaluated 
to date.
AIMS: In this study, we investigated the associations of routinely recorded body 
size with all-cause mortality and deaths from common causes in a large cohort of 
people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.
METHODS: We assembled a retrospective observational cohort using data from a 
large mental health service in South London. We followed all patients over the 
age of 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders 
from the date of their first recorded body mass index (BMI) between 1 January 
2007 and 31 March 2018.
RESULTS: Of 11 900 patients with a BMI recording, 1566 died. The Cox 
proportional hazards regression models, after adjusting for sociodemographic, 
socioeconomic variables and comorbidities, indicated that all-cause mortality 
was only associated with underweight status compared with healthy weight status 
(hazard ratio (HR): 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01 to 1.76). Obesity 
(HR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.52) and morbid obesity (HR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.03 to 
2.42) were associated with all-cause mortality in the 18-45 years age range, and 
obesity was associated with lower risk (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.87) in those 
aged 65+ years. Cancer mortality was raised in underweight individuals (HR: 
1.93, 95% CI: 1.03 to 4.10) and respiratory disease mortality raised in those 
with morbid obesity (HR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.02 to 5.22).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, being underweight was associated with higher mortality in 
this disorder group; however, this was potentially accounted for by frailty in 
older age groups, and obesity was a risk factor for premature mortality in 
younger ages. The impact of obesity on life expectancy for people with 
schizophrenia spectrum disorders is clear from our findings. A deeper biological 
understanding of the relationship between these diseases and schizophrenia will 
help improve clinical practice.

The majority of patients with esophageal cancer are diagnosed at an advanced, 
incurable stage. Palliation of symptoms, specifically dysphagia, is a crucial 
component to improve quality of life and optimize nutritional status. Despite 
multiple available treatment modalities, there is not one accepted or 
recommended to be the preferred treatment option. Palliative management is often 
decided by a multidisciplinary team considering factors including local 
availability, preference, patient life expectancy, and symptom severity. 
Systemic therapies such as chemotherapy are the most commonly used palliative 
modalities. Oncologists are most familiar with radiation for dysphagia 
palliation, especially for advanced metastatic cancer patients with good 
performance status. One common approach used by endoscopist is self-expandable 
metal stents. This is preferred for patients with short-term survival and poor 
functional status as it provides rapid relief of dysphagia. Cryotherapy is a 
relatively new endoscopic ablative modality and appears to be a promising option
