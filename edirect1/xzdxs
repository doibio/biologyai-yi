BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an endocrine and metabolic disease caused 
by a variety of pathogenic factors, including genetic factors, environmental 
factors and behavior. In recent decades, the number of cases and the prevalence 
of diabetes have steadily increased, and it has become one of the most 
threatening diseases to human health in the world. Currently, insulin is the 
most effective and direct way to control hyperglycemia for diabetes treatment at 
a low cost. However, hypoglycemia is often a common complication of insulin 
treatment. Moreover, with the extension of treatment time, insulin resistance, 
considered the typical adverse symptom, can appear. Therefore, it is urgent to 
develop new targets and more effective and safer drugs for diabetes treatment to 
avoid adverse reactions and the insulin tolerance of traditional hypoglycemic 
drugs.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: In recent years, it has been found that some fibroblast growth 
factors (FGFs), including FGF1, FGF19 and FGF21, can safely and effectively 
reduce hyperglycemia and have the potential to be developed as new drugs for the 
treatment of diabetes. FGF23 is also closely related to diabetes and its 
complications, which provides a new approach for regulating blood glucose and 
solving the problem of insulin tolerance.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: This article reviews the research progress on the physiology 
and pharmacology of fibroblast growth factor in the treatment of diabetes. We 
focus on the application of FGFs in diabetes care and prevention.

OBJECTIVES: Substantial regional variation in smoking behaviour in Germany has 
been well documented. However, little is known about how these regional 
differences in smoking affect regional mortality disparities. We aim to assess 
the contribution of smoking to regional mortality differentials in Germany over 
the last four decades.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using official cause-specific mortality data by 
German Federal State aggregated into five macro-regions: East, North, South, 
West-I and West-II.
PARTICIPANTS: The entire population of Germany stratified by sex, age and region 
during 1980-2019.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Smoking-attributable fraction estimated using the 
Preston-Glei-Wilmoth method; life expectancy at birth before and after the 
elimination of smoking-attributable deaths.
RESULTS: In all macro-regions, the burden of past smoking has been declining 
among men but growing rapidly among women. The hypothetical removal of 
smoking-attributable deaths would eliminate roughly half of the contemporary 
advantage in life expectancy of the vanguard region South over the other 
macro-regions, apart from the East. In the latter, smoking only explains around 
a quarter (0.5 years) of the 2-year difference in male life expectancy compared 
with the South observed in 2019. Among women, eliminating smoking-attributable 
deaths would put the East in a more disadvantageous position compared with the 
South as well as the other macro-regions.
CONCLUSION: While regional differences in smoking histories explain large parts 
of the regional disparities in male mortality, they are playing an increasingly 
important role for female mortality trends and differentials. Health policies 
aiming at reducing regional inequalities should account for regional differences 
in past smoking behaviour.

INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an 
under-recognised cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with a strong female 
predominance. There are currently limited prospective studies and no randomised 
controlled trials that inform on SCAD's best clinical care. Little is also known 
about predictors of acute SCAD deterioration or recurrence. We describe the 
study design of a multi-centre prospective and historical cohort study 
recruiting patients with SCAD across 15-20 sites in Australia/New Zealand (NZ). 
The primary aim is to describe the clinical presentation, management and 
outcomes along with predictors of acute deterioration and recurrence in a large 
Australian/NZ SCAD cohort, with international data pooling.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Consented patients diagnosed with SCAD during a hospital 
admission for an ACS will be prospectively followed at 30 days then yearly, for 
up to 5 years. Each recruiting site will also retrospectively identify 
historical cases of SCAD from the proceeding 10 years, with a waiver of consent. 
For historical cases, data will be collected in a de-identified manner with date 
of last follow-up or death obtained from the medical records. All cases undergo 
core laboratory adjudication of coronary angiography and any accompanying 
imaging to confirm SCAD diagnosis. The primary endpoint will be occurrence of 
major adverse cardiovascular events; a composite of all-cause mortality, 
recurrent myocardial infarction (including SCAD recurrence), stroke/transient 
ischaemic attack, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest/ventricular 
arrhythmia, heart transplantation and, repeat/unplanned revascularisation. 
Secondary endpoints will include each individual primary outcome as well as 
acute SCAD extension and quality of life/Seattle Angina Score in prospectively 
recruited participants. Endpoints will be assessed at the end of the hospital 
admission and at 30-days, 1 year, and median long-term follow-up.
ETHICS: Multicentre ethics approval has been granted from the Western Sydney 
Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee (2021/ETH00040).
DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS: The analysed results will be published in 
peer-reviewed journals on completion of the historical data collection and then 
on completion of the prospective data collection.
REGISTRATION DETAILS: The ANZ-SCAD registry has been prospectively registered 
with the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry 
(ACTRN12621000824864).

We evaluated the anti-leishmanial efficacy of different saturated medium-chain 
fatty acids (FAs, C8-C18) where FA containing C8 chain, caprylic acid (CA), was 
found to be most potent against Leishmania donovani, the causative agent for 
visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Different analogs of CA with C8 linear chain, but 
not higher, along with a carboxyl/ester group showed a similar anti-leishmanial 
effect. Ergosterol depletion was the major cause of CA-mediated cell death. 
Molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies indicated the enzyme 
mevalonate kinase (MevK) of the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway as a possible 
target of CA. Enzyme assays with purified recombinant MevK and CA/CA analogs 
confirmed the target with a competitive inhibition pattern. Using biochemical 
and biophysical studies; strong binding interaction between MevK and CA/CA 
analogs was established. Further, using parasites with overexpressed MevK and 
proteomics studies of CA-treated parasites the direct role of MevK as the target 
was validated. We established the mechanism of the antileishmanial effect of CA, 
a natural product, against VL where toxicity and drug resistance with current 
chemotherapeutics demand an alternative. This is the first report on the 
identification of an enzymatic target with kinetic parameters and mechanistic 
insights against any organism for a natural medium-chain FA.

Cancer is a vital barrier to increase the life expectancy and the foremost cause 
of death globally. The initial diagnosis and proper management of cancer can 
expand the survival rate of individuals. This review provides an in-depth 
investigation of cancer causes symptoms, types of cancer, and worldwide 
distribution of cancer. The relation between nutrition (i.e., various food 
items) and cancer is also emphasized to offer a framework of nutrition 
management in different cancer types. The microbiota is closely associated with 
the occurrence of cancer. Thus, genomics of intestinal microbes and 
nutrigenomics have been discussed based on the reported meta-analysis studies. A 
dramatic increase in cancer rates has been observed due to intake of alcohol, 
microbial infections, and deficiency of nutrition. Malnutrition is a substantial 
problem in cancer patients linked with improper treatment and increased 
morbidity. The detail studies of cancer and nutrigenomics are an eminent 
approach to comprehend the relation between microbes and the consumption of 
certain food types which can further reduce the cancer risk. The incorporation 
of specific nutrients and probiotics improved the gut microbial health, 
increased life expectancy, and also decreased the incidence of tumorigenesis in 
individuals.

The increase in life expectancy along with technological advances has translated 
into a higher number of pituitary adenomas (PA) diagnosed from the age of 65. In 
the elderly, symptoms related to comorbidities might overlap with endocrine 
dysfunction, in addition to increasing anesthetic and surgical risks. This study 
aimed to compare baseline clinical and tumor features between patients with PA 
from different age groups: younger adults (YA), 18 to 64 years, and older adults 
(OA), ≥65 years. As secondary outcomes, we also intended to assess: clinical 
characteristics and tumor features in patients undergoing surgical intervention 
and surgical data and complications in patients undergoing transphenoidal 
surgery (TSS). This retrospective cohort study included patients diagnosed with 
PA in adulthood divided into YA and OA groups. The secondary outcomes were 
evaluated in the subgroups: patients who underwent pituitary surgery and 
patients specifically submitted to TSS, who had completed postoperative 
follow-up ≥ 6 months until July/2020. A total of 401 patients were included, 327 
(81.5%) in the YA and 74 (18.5%) in the OA group. Hormone-secreting effects were 
more common in the YA group (P < .001) and mass effects in the OA group 
(P = .070). The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes was higher in the OA 
group (P = .002, P = .011). A larger proportion of nonfunctioning (NF) PA and 
prolactinomas was found in OA (P < .001) and YA (P = .012), respectively. 
Macroadenomas were more common in the OA group (P < .001). No differences were 
found in terms of invasiveness. In the secondary outcome analysis, there was a 
higher prevalence of NF-PA in those who underwent pituitary surgery. The rate of 
TSS-related complications was similar between the groups for major, minor and 
endocrine/electrolyte complications. OA-PA clinically differ from the younger: 
tend to present more frequently with chronic comorbidities and less frequently 
with hormone-secreting effects, are more often NF and larger in size without a 
significant increase in invasiveness. The TSS results were reassuring, proving 
to be equally safe for the elderly.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive tumor with a poor 
prognosis. In our study, we aimed to investigate the specific clinical, 
laboratory, and radiological features of the tumor and the prognostic effect of 
SUVmax (maximum standardized uptake values) according to PET/CT (positron 
emission tomography). Demographic, therapeutic, clinical, and survival 
information of patients diagnosed with histologically-validated pleural 
mesothelioma in our hospital between January 2010 to December 2019 will be 
retrospectively scanned from the hospital records. A total of 116 patients, 61 
men (52.6%), and 55 women (47.4%), were analyzed. Thirty five patients (30.2%) 
were over the age of 65. Percentage of patients over 65 years of age, neutrophil 
count, and PET SUV Max values, asbestos exposure and pleural thickening rate 
were significantly higher in the deceased patients' group than in the living 
patients' group (P = .042, P = .039, P = .002, P = .004, P = .037). T stage 
(tumor stage), N stage (lymph nodes stage), metastasis stage, and Grade 
distribution were significantly higher in the deceased patients' group than in 
the living patients' group (P < .000, P < .000, P = .003, P < .000). The rates 
of chemotherapy and surgical treatment, right lung location, and epithelioid 
pathology were significantly lower in the deceased patients' group compared to 
the living patients' group (P = .016, P = .030, P = .018, P = .008). The mean 
follow-up time was 13 months. Key determinants of survival in MPM include age, 
male gender, neutrophil increase, pleural thickening, high PET SUV max values, 
stage, histological type, asbestos exposure, and treatment regimen.

Protein turnover maintains the proteome's functional integrity. Here, protein 
turnover efficiency over time in wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans was assessed 
using inverse [15N]-pulse labeling up to 7 days after the egg-laying phase at 20 
°C. Isotopic analysis of some abundant proteins was executed favoring data 
quality over quantity for mathematical modeling. Surprisingly, isotopic 
enrichment over time reached an upper limit showing an apparent cessation of 
protein renewal well before death, with protein fractions inaccessible to 
turnover ranging from 14 to 83%. For life span modulation, worms were raised at 
different temperatures after egg laying. Mathematical modeling of isotopic 
enrichment points either to a slowdown of protein turnover or to an increasing 
protein fraction resistant to turnover with time. Most notably, the estimated 
time points of protein turnover cessation from our mathematical model were 
highly correlated with the observed median life span. Thrashing and pumping 
rates over time were linearly correlated with isotopic enrichment, therefore 
linking protein/tracer intake to protein turnover rate and protein life span. If 
confirmed, life span extension is possible by optimizing protein turnover rate 
through modulating protein intake in C. elegans and possibly other organisms. 
While proteome maintenance benefits from a high protein turnover rate, protein 
turnover is fundamentally energy-intensive, where oxidative stress contributes 
to damage that it is supposed to repair.

The health risk and burden of disease induced by exposure to inorganic arsenic 
(iAs) through drinking water and foodstuffs in Iran were assessed. The iAs 
levels in drinking water and foodstuffs (15 food groups) in the country were 
determined through systematic review of three international databases (PubMed, 
Scopus, and Web of Science) and meta-analysis. Based on the results of the 
systematic review and meta-analysis, the average iAs levels in drinking water 
and all the food groups at the national level were lower than the maximum 
permissible levels. The total average non-carcinogenic risk of dietary exposure 
to iAs in terms of hazard index (HI) was 3.4. The average incremental lifetime 
cancer risk (ILCR) values of dietary exposure to iAs were determined to be 1.5 × 
10-3 for skin cancer, 1.0 × 10-3 for lung cancer, and 4.0 × 10-4 for bladder 
cancer. Over two-thirds of the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk of dietary 
exposure to iAs was attributed to bread and cereals, drinking water, and rice. 
The total annual cancer incidence, deaths, disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs), death rate, and DALY rate (per 100,000 people) were assessed to be 3347 
(95 % uncertainty interval: 1791 to 5999), 1302 (697 to 2336), 72,606 (38,833 to 
130,228), 1.6 (0.87 to 2.9), and 91 (49 to 160). The contribution of mortality 
in the attributable burden of disease was 95.1 %. The contributions of the 
causes in the attributable burden of disease were 72 % for lung cancer, 16 % for 
bladder cancer, and 12 % for skin cancer. Due to the significant attributable 
burden of disease, national and subnational action plans consisting of 
multi-disciplinary approaches for risk management of dietary exposure to iAs, 
especially for the higher arsenic-affected areas and high-risk population groups 
in the country are recommended.

The formulation of new bionanocomposite (BNC) films using whey protein isolates 
(WPI, 3.3-11.7 %)-jujube polysaccharide (JPS, 1.59-18.41 %)/starch nanocrystals 
(SNCs, 0.32-3.68 %) blends was optimized. The ultrasound-assisted acid 
hydrolysis produced ~63.1 nm SNCs from native starch with -24.3 mV ζ-potential. 
The extracted JPS purification led to a single symmetrical peak for 
galactoarabinan-rich fraction (1.35 × 105 Da). The optimal levels of barrier 
(oxygen (11.85 cm3 m-2 d-1 atm-1) and water vapor (3.22 × 10-10 g m-1 s-1 Pa-1) 
permeability rate), optical (opacity index (2.7 AU μm-1), total color difference 
(18.69), and whiteness index (77.40)), and thermal (glass transition temperature 
(-8.29 °C) and melting point (110.38 °C)) properties were obtained at 5.0 % WPI, 
15.0 % JPS, and 3.0 % SNCs. The film-forming solution of optimal BNCs had a 
significant antibacterial effect against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia 
coli. The improved crystallinity of BNCs at an optimal SNC level was confirmed 
by the X-ray diffraction (XRD). The field emission-scanning electron (FE-SEM) 
and atomic force (AFM) microscopy images confirmed a continuous and uniform 
network for the optimal BNCs without any pores or cracks accompanied by low 
surface roughness. The FTIR spectroscopy proved covalent interaction and 
hydrogen bonding among chemical functional groups of WPI and JPS reinforced with 
SNCs. The optimal BNC could preserve banana fruits with favorable 
physicochemical and microbial quality during storage.

BACKGROUND: The devolution of public services from central to local government 
can increase sensitivity to local population needs but might also reduce the 
expertise and resources available. Little evidence is available on the impact of 
devolution on population health. We evaluated the effect of devolution affecting 
health services and wider determinants of health on life expectancy in Greater 
Manchester, England.
METHODS: We estimated changes in life expectancy in Greater Manchester relative 
to a control group from the rest of England (excluding London), using a 
generalised synthetic control method. Using local district-level data collected 
between Jan 1, 2006 and Dec 31, 2019, we estimated the effect of devolution on 
the whole population and stratified by sex, district, income deprivation, and 
baseline life expectancy.
FINDINGS: After devolution, from November, 2014, life expectancy in Greater 
Manchester was 0·196 years (95% CI 0·182-0·210) higher than expected when 
compared with the synthetic control group with similar pre-devolution trends. 
Life expectancy was protected from the decline observed in comparable areas in 
the 2 years after devolution and increased in the longer term. Increases in life 
expectancy were observed in eight of ten local authorities, were larger among 
men than women (0·338 years [0·315-0·362] for men; 0·057 years [0·040-0·074] for 
women), and were larger in areas with high income deprivation (0·390 years 
[0·369-0·412]) and lower life expectancy before devolution (0·291 years 
[0·271-0·311]).
INTERPRETATION: Greater Manchester had better life expectancy than expected 
after devolution. The benefits of devolution were apparent in the areas with the 
highest income deprivation and lowest life expectancy, suggesting a narrowing of 
inequalities. Improvements were likely to be due to a coordinated devolution 
across sectors, affecting wider determinants of health and the organisation of 
care services.

BACKGROUND: Lower life expectancy, higher rates of chronic disease, and poorer 
uptake of health services are common in remote patient populations. Patients 
with poor health literacy (HL) are less likely to attend appointments, adhere to 
medications, and have higher rates of chronic illness. Evidence underpinning the 
relationship between HL and inequity in remote critical care populations is 
sparse.
OBJECTIVES: The primary study aim was to explore a multidimensional HL profile 
of patients requiring critical care in a remote area health service. Secondary 
aims were to explore HL in subgroups of the sample and to explore associations 
between HL and emergency department representation and discharge against medical 
advice.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of consecutive eligible patients 
admitted to the Mount Isa hospital intensive care unit. The Health Literacy 
Questionnaire was administered in a semistructured interview.
RESULTS: In a 5-month period, there were 141 patient admissions to the five-bed 
intensive care unit, 67 patients (47.5%) met inclusion criteria and were not 
discharged prior to recruitment, and 37 (26.2%) agreed to participate. 
Participants felt understood and supported by healthcare providers, had 
sufficient information to manage their health, proactively engaged with 
healthcare providers, and had strong social supports. More challenging was their 
capacity to advocate on their own behalf, to explore and appraise information 
and to navigate healthcare systems. Patients who represented to the emergency 
department (n = 8, 21.6%) felt more empowered to seek healthcare advice. Of the 
11 patients that discharged against medical advice, only one participated in the 
study.
CONCLUSION: Trends in the data showed that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
participants were marginally less likely to be information explorers and to 
understand all written information. Findings provide guidance for the 
development of interventions to progress a reduction in health disparities 
experienced by this population.

OBJECTIVES: The Munich Breathlessness Service (MBS) significantly improved 
control of breathlessness measured by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire 
(CRQ) Mastery in a randomized controlled fast track trial with waitlist group 
design spanning 8 weeks in Germany. This study aimed to assess the within-trial 
cost-effectiveness of MBS from a societal perspective.
METHODS: Data included generic (5-level version of EQ-5D) health-related quality 
of life and disease-specific CRQ Mastery. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
were calculated based on 5-level version of EQ-5D utilities valued with German 
time trade-off. Direct medical costs and productivity loss were calculated based 
on standardized unit costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) and 
cost-effectiveness-acceptance curves were calculated using adjusted mean 
differences (AMD) in costs (gamma-distributed model) and both effect parameters 
(Gaussian-distributed model) and performing 1000 simultaneous bootstrap 
replications. Potential gender differences were investigated in stratified 
analyses.
RESULTS: Between March 2014 and April 2019, 183 eligible patients were enrolled. 
MBS intervention demonstrated significantly better effects regarding generic 
(AMD of QALY gains of 0.004, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0003 to 0.008) and 
disease-specific health-related quality of life at nonsignificantly higher costs 
(AMD of €605 [95% CI -1109 to 2550]). At the end of the intervention, the ICER 
was €152 433/QALY (95% CI -453 545 to 1 625 903) and €1548/CRQ Mastery point 
(95% CI -3093 to 10 168). Intervention costs were on average €357 (SD = 132). 
Gender-specific analyses displayed dominance for MBS in males and higher effects 
coupled with significantly higher costs in females.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a high ICER for MBS. Considering dominance for MBS 
in males, implementing MBS on approval within the German health care system 
should be considered.

BACKGROUND: Prevention of domino effects after distal radius fractures is 
important for improving life expectancy. Fragility fractures secondary to falls 
are associated with decreased bone mineral density, muscle strength, and 
exercise capacity. Grip strength is one of the simplest and most useful tests to 
comprehensively judge muscle strength. The purpose of this study was to examine 
whether grip strength is associated with bone mineral density, limb muscle mass, 
muscle strength, and exercise capacity, by comparing patient backgrounds based 
on the presence or absence of grip weakness in female patients with distal 
radius fractures.
METHODS: This study included women with distal radius fractures who visited our 
orthopedics outpatient department between April 2015 and April 2020. Bone 
mineral density, limb muscle mass, skeletal muscle mass index, muscle strength 
(grip strength on unaffected side and quadriceps muscle strength), the Timed Up 
and Go test, and the Two-Step test were evaluated six to eight weeks after 
injury. Patients were divided into two groups according to the cutoff value of 
grip strength (18-21 kg), and 90 age-adjusted and matched participants were 
compared and examined.
RESULTS: At the cutoff value of 18 kg, a significant decrease in lumbar spine 
and total proximal femur bone mineral density (p < 0.05, p < 0.05), limb muscle 
mass and skeletal muscle mass index (p < 0.01, p < 0.05), quadriceps femoris 
muscle strength (p < 0.01), the Timed Up and Go test (p < 0.05), and the 
Two-Step test (p < 0.01), was observed in the grip-weakness group compared to 
that in the no-grip-weakness group.
CONCLUSIONS: In women with distal radius fracture and grip strength <18 kg on 
the unaffected side, bone mineral density, limb muscle mass, quadriceps femoris 
strength, and exercise capacity may be reduced. These results suggest reduced 
grip strength may be an indicator for further testing to prevent domino effects.

BACKGROUND: Cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) is becoming increasingly common 
in patients with hypertension, and it is well established that healthy lifestyle 
plays a key role in the prevention of hypertension. However, the association 
between combined lifestyle factors and CMM in patients with hypertension is 
uncertain.
METHODS: This prospective analysis included the data (obtained from the UK 
biobank) of participants with hypertension who did not have coronary heart 
disease (CHD), stroke, or diabetes. The outcome was the occurrence of CMM, 
defined as ≥ 1 disease of CHD, stroke, and diabetes that occurred in 
participants with hypertension. Four lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol 
consumption, diet, and physical activity) were assessed using a weighted healthy 
lifestyle score, and participants were divided into four groups: the very 
unhealthy, unhealthy, healthy, and very healthy groups. The flexible parameter 
Royston-Parmar proportional hazard model was used to estimate hazard ratios 
(HRs) between lifestyles and CMM, as well as the difference in CMM-free life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12.2 years, 9812 (18.4%) of the 53,397 
hypertensive patients occurred CMM. Compared with the very unhealthy group, the 
very healthy group had a 41% reduction in the risk for CMM in hypertensive 
patients and a 32-50% reduction in the risk for specific cardiometabolic 
diseases such as CHD, stroke, and diabetes. For each lifestyle factor, 
non-smoking had the greatest protective effect against CMM (HR: 0.64, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.60-0.68). A lifestyle combining multiple healthy 
factors extended CMM-free life expectancy (e.g., six years longer at age 
45 years for participants in the very healthy group).
CONCLUSIONS: Combined healthy lifestyle factors were associated with a lower 
risk for CMM in hypertensive patients. This suggests that combined healthy 
lifestyle should be supported to decrease disease burden.

Yunnan Province is the main planting area of the precious Chinese herbal 
medicines (CHM) Panax notoginseng; however, it locates the geological area with 
high soil heavy metals in China. The frequent land replacement due to continuous 
cropping obstacles and excessive application of chemicals makes P. notoginseng 
prone to be contaminated by heavy metals under the farmland P. notoginseng (FPn) 
planting. To overcome farmland shortage, understory P. notoginseng (UPn) was 
developed as a new ecological planting model featured by no chemicals input. 
However, this newly developed planting system requires urgently the soil-plant 
heavy metal characteristics and risk assessment. This study aimed to evaluate 
the pollution status of eight heavy metals in the tillage layer (0-20 cm), 
subsoil layer (20-40 cm) and the plants of UPn in Lancang County, Yunnan 
Province. Pollution index (Pi) showed that the contamination degree of heavy 
metals in the tillage layer and subsoil layer was 
Cd > Pb > Ni > Cu > Zn > Cr > Hg > As and Pb > Cd > Cu > Ni > Cr > Hg > Zn > As, 
respectively. Potential ecological risk index (PERI) for the tillage layer and 
subsoil layer was slight and middle, respectively. The exceeding standard rate 
of Cd, As, Pb, Hg, Cu in the UPn roots was 5.33%, 5.33%, 13.33%, 26.67% and 
1.33%, respectively, while only Cd and Hg in the UPn leaves exceeded the 
standard 10% and 14%, respectively. The enrichment abilities of Cd and Hg in the 
roots and leaves of UPn were the strongest, while that of Pb was the weakest. 
The Hazard index (HI) and target hazard quotient (THQ) of eight heavy metals in 
the roots and leaves of UPn were less than 1.Therefore, our results prove that 
Upn has no human health risk and provide a scientific basis for the safety 
evaluation and extension of UPn.

Substantially reduced life expectancy for people with serious mental illness 
compared with the general population is primarily driven by physical health 
issues, of which cardiovascular disease is the leading cause. In this narrative 
review, we examine the evidence base for use of metformin and other antidiabetic 
agents as a means for reducing this excess cardiometabolic disease burden. 
Evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) suggests substantial potential 
for metformin to prevent or manage weight gain and glycaemic impairment induced 
by atypical antipsychotic medications, whereas the impact of metformin on other 
cardiometabolic risk factors is less consistent. Evidence from RCTs also 
suggests potential benefits from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
(GLP-1RAs), particularly for addressing cardiometabolic risk factors in people 
using atypical antipsychotic medications, but this is based on a small number of 
trials and remains an emerging area of research. Trials of both metformin and 
GLP-1RAs suggest that these medications are associated with a high prevalence of 
mild-moderate gastrointestinal side effects. The heterogeneous nature of 
participant eligibility criteria and of antipsychotic and antidiabetic drug 
regimens, alongside short trial durations, small numbers of participants and 
paucity of clinical endpoints as trial outcomes, warrants investment in 
definitive trials to determine clinical benefits for both metformin and 
GLP-1RAs. Such trials would also help to confirm the safety profile of 
antidiabetic agents with respect to less common but serious adverse effects. The 
weight of RCT evidence suggests that an indication for metformin to address 
antipsychotic-induced weight gain is worth considering in Australia. This would 
bring us into line with other countries.
