BACKGROUND: Due to rising costs caused by increasing demand for sexually 
transmitted infection (STI) care, the Dutch government changed the funding of 
STI clinics. In 2015, a more restrictive testing policy was introduced with 
syphilis and HIV tests only on indication for younger, heterosexual clients. We 
evaluated intended savings and missed syphilis and/or HIV infections and 
explored efficiency of possible test policies.
METHODS: Using surveillance data from 2011 to 2013 with extensive testing for 
all, we estimated effects of restrictive testing on test costs, number of 
infections missed, costs per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) lost, and 
calculated the net monetary benefit from a government perspective.
RESULTS: The 2015 policy led to estimated savings of €1.1 million, while missing 
approximately three HIV infections and seven syphilis infections annually. 
Savings were €435,000/QALY lost. If testing second-generation immigrants for 
syphilis and HIV, savings rose to €525,000/QALY lost. Offering an HIV test when 
diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhoea savings were €568,000/QALY lost. In a 
sensitivity analysis, the willingness-to-pay threshold had the highest impact on 
results.
CONCLUSIONS: The 2015 testing policy resulted in a modest decline of detected 
HIV and syphilis infections, generating substantial savings. Syphilis and HIV 
tests for both first- and second-generation immigrants and an HIV test in case 
of positive chlamydia or gonorrhoea diagnosis could reduce missed infections in 
a cost-effective way.

OBJECTIVE: To complete an economic evaluation within a randomised controlled 
trial (RCT) comparing the use of an electronic discharge communication tool 
(eDCT) compared with usual care.
SETTING: Patients being discharged from a single tertiary care centre's internal 
medicine Medical Teaching Units.
PARTICIPANTS: Between January 2012 and December 2013, 1399 patients were 
randomised to a discharge mechanism. Forty-five patients were excluded from the 
economic evaluation as they did not have data for the index hospitalisation 
cost; 1354 patients contributed to the economic evaluation.
INTERVENTION: eDCT generated at discharge containing structured content on 
reason for admission, details of the hospital stay, treatments received and 
follow-up care required. The control group was discharged via traditional 
dictation methods.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary economic outcome was the 
cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Secondary outcomes included 
the cost per death avoided and the cost per readmission avoided.
RESULTS: The average transcription cost was $C22.28 per patient, whereas the 
estimated cost of the eDCT was $C13.33 per patient. The cost per QALY gained was 
$C239 933 in the eDCT arm compared with usual care due to the very small gains 
in effectiveness and approximately $C800difference in resource utilisation 
costs. The bootstrap analyses resulted in eDCT being more effective and more 
costly in 29.2% of samples, less costly and more effective in 29.2% of samples, 
less effective and more costly in 23.9% of samples and finally, less costly and 
less effective in 17.7% of samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The eDCT reduced per patient costs of the generation of discharge 
summaries. The bootstrap estimates demonstrate considerable uncertainty 
supporting the finding of neutrality reported in the clinical component of the 
RCT. The immediate transcription cost savings and previously documented provider 
and patient satisfaction may increase the impetus for organisations to invest in 
such systems, provided they have a foundation of eHealth infrastructure and 
readiness.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab (IXE), an 
interleukin 17A antagonist, in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) after 52 
weeks in a phase III study.
METHODS: Patients were initially randomly assigned to IXE 80 mg every 2 weeks 
(IXEQ2W) or every 4 weeks (IXEQ4W) after a 160-mg starting dose, placebo (PBO), 
or adalimumab (ADA) 40 mg Q2W. At Week 24 (Week 16 for inadequate responders), 
ADA (8-week washout before starting IXE) and PBO patients were rerandomized to 
IXEQ2W or IXEQ4W. Six treatment groups were evaluated in the extension period 
(weeks 24-52): IXEQ2W/IXEQ2W, IXEQ4W/IXEQ4W, ADA/IXEQ2W, ADA/IXEQ4W, PBO/IXEQ2W, 
and PBO/IXEQ4W. The extension period population (EPP) included patients who 
received ≥ 1 dose of study medication during the extension period.
RESULTS: There were 381/417 (91.4%) patients who entered the extension period. 
In the IXEQ4W/IXEQ4W and IXEQ2W/IXEQ2W groups (EPP), respectively, American 
College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 (69.1% and 68.8%), ACR50 (54.6% and 53.1%), and 
ACR70 (39.2% and 39.6%) response rates were sustained at Week 52. Patients 
rerandomized to IXE also demonstrated efficacy measured by ACR response rates at 
Week 52. A similar pattern was observed for Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
outcomes. Radiographic progression in all 6 groups was minimal. The most 
frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (≥ 4%) were 
nasopharyngitis, injection site reaction, injection site erythema, upper 
respiratory tract infection, and back pain. No deaths were reported, and serious 
adverse event frequency was 0-4% with IXE.
CONCLUSION: During the extension period, IXEQ4W or IXEQ2W treatment demonstrated 
sustained efficacy in key PsA domains with a safety profile consistent with 
other studies investigating IXE. Clinical trial number: NCT01695239; EudraCT 
2011-002326-49.

BACKGROUND: Treatment with biologics may be indicated for patients with 
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, but comparative evidence on 
cost-effectiveness is limited. Switching of biologics is common, but it is 
unclear what the effect is of differences in sequences of biologics.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different biologic treatment 
sequences for psoriasis based on real-world evidence.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A sequence model was developed to evaluate the costs and 
health effects of three consecutive lines of biologic treatments [for example 
adalimumab-etanercept-ustekinumab (Ada-Eta-Ust) vs. Eta-Ust-Ada] over a 10-year 
time horizon in the Netherlands. The model was populated with data from the 
Dutch BioCAPTURE registry and scientific literature. Analyses were conducted of 
cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and uncertainty was addressed by 
probabilistic as well as scenario analyses.
RESULTS: Treatment of psoriasis with biologics for a 10-year period was 
estimated to be associated with a cost of €141 962 to €148 442 per patient 
depending on the treatment sequence used. Cumulative health effects ranged from 
7·79 to 8·03 QALYs. Starting with Ada or Ust seems favourable concerning cost 
and utilities compared with strategies starting with Eta, although credible 
intervals were partly overlapping.
CONCLUSIONS: The order in which biologics are used influences treatment 
cost-effectiveness, both in terms of costs and health effects. Initiation of a 
biologic treatment sequence for psoriasis might best be done with Ada or Ust; 
Eta seems less optimal from a health-economic perspective.

Hepatitis D virus (HDV) contains a single-stranded circular RNA genome that 
encodes two forms of hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), the small delta antigen 
(HDAg-S) and the large delta antigen (HDAg-L). The two proteins have an 
identical amino acid sequence, except that HDAg-L has a 19-amino-acid extension 
at the C terminus. The domain spanning amino acid residues 198-210 of the HDAg-L 
(HDAg-L(198-210)) contains a nuclear export signal (NES), which is important for 
the nuclear export of HDV ribonucleoprotein to the cytoplasm. In this study, we 
established a cell permeable TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein using an E. 
coli protein expression system, to determine its function during HDV infection. 
The cytotoxicity of the TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein was investigated 
using an MTT assay, while a GST pull-down assay revealed that the 
TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein interfered with the interaction between 
HDAg-L and clathrin heavy chain (CHC). In addition, the cellular distribution of 
HDAg-L, in the presence of HBsAg, was observed by immunofluorescence staining 
and the TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein was found to impede the nuclear 
export of HDAg-L. Furthermore, assembly of HDV virus-like particles (VLPs) was 
decreased by the expression of the TAT-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein. The 
TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein also inhibited virus particle assembly and 
HDV secretion in a mouse model. These results suggest that the 
TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein inhibits the nuclear export of HDAg-L and 
competes with the C terminus of HDAg-L for interaction with CHC, and may have 
potential as a therapeutic agent for HDV infection.

Aortoenteric fistula (AEF) is one of the most challenging diagnostic and 
therapeutic entities in vascular surgery. AEF can occur either primarily 
involving the aorta and the gastrointestinal tract or, more commonly, secondary 
to previous aortic reconstructive surgery. Traditionally, the treatment of AEF 
includes graft excision and extra-anatomic bypass surgery or in situ graft 
replacement. However, recently endovascular repair has emerged as an alternative 
therapeutic option. In this article, we present published and current evidence 
for endovascular repair of primary and secondary AEF. When endovascular 
treatment is applied where appropriate, early outcomes seem to be superior 
compared to open surgery. This benefit may be lost during long-term follow-up, 
implying that a staged approach with early conversion to in situ grafting may 
realize the best patient survival and morbidity. Lifelong administration of 
antibiotics is associated with a reduction in re-infection. An endovascular 
approach used as a bridging procedure in unstable patients is recommended, 
followed by definitive open therapy, if feasible, in patients with good life 
expectancy.

AIMS: Following chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer, the addition 
of contact X-ray brachytherapy (CXB) in partial responders might increase the 
proportion of patients with a clinical complete response (cCR) and who are thus 
suitable for watch and wait management. However, the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of this approach has not been evaluated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Decision analytical modelling and a Markov simulation 
were used to compare long-term costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
cost-effectiveness from a third-party payer (National Health Service) 
perspective for treatment strategies after chemoradiotherapy; watch and wait 
with CXB when a cCR was not initially achieved after external beam radiotherapy 
(EBRT) (WWCXB), watch and wait with EBRT alone (WWEBRT) and radical surgery for 
all patients. The effect of uncertainty in model parameters and patient 
demographics was investigated.
RESULTS: WWCXB had a higher QALY payoff than both radical surgery and WWEBRT and 
was less costly in most scenarios and demographic cohorts. In all plausible 
scenarios, WWCXB was the most cost-effective, at a threshold of £20 000/QALY. 
This finding was insensitive to uncertainty associated with model parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: WWCXB is likely to be cost-effective compared with both WWEBRT 
alone and radical surgery. These findings support the use of CXB boost as an 
adjunct to a watch and wait strategy.

    Lancet Glob Health. 2018 Feb;6(2):e122-e123.

BACKGROUND: Achieving universal health coverage, including quality essential 
service coverage and financial protection for all, is target 3.8 of the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). As a result, an index of essential health 
service coverage indicators was selected by the UN as SDG indicator 3.8.1. We 
have developed an index for measuring SDG 3.8.1, describe methods for compiling 
the index, and report baseline results for 2015.
METHODS: 16 tracer indicators were selected for the index, which included four 
from within each of the categories of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child 
health; infectious disease; non-communicable diseases; and service capacity and 
access. Indicator data for 183 countries were taken from UN agency estimates or 
databases, supplemented with submissions from national focal points during a WHO 
country consultation. The index was computed using geometric means, and a subset 
of tracer indicators were used to summarise inequalities.
FINDINGS: On average, countries had primary data since 2010 for 72% of the final 
set of indicators. The median national value for the service coverage index was 
65 out of 100 (range 22-86). The index was highly correlated with other summary 
measures of health, and after controlling for gross national income and mean 
years of adult education, was associated with 21 additional years of life 
expectancy over the observed range of country values. Across 52 countries with 
sufficient data, coverage was 1% to 66% lower among the poorest quintile as 
compared with the national population. Sensitivity analyses suggested ranks 
implied by the index are fairly stable across alternative calculation methods.
INTERPRETATION: Service coverage within universal health coverage can be 
measured with an index of tracer indicators. Our universal health coverage 
service coverage index is simple to compute by use of available country data and 
can be refined to incorporate relevant indicators as they become available 
through SDG monitoring.

INTRODUCTION: Irradiation is one of the intervention strategies for effective 
control of food-borne pathogen microorganisms, which reduces microbial load and 
extends the meat shelf life.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This experimental study was carried out on quail meat. 
Quail meat samples were treated with electron beam irradiation at doses of 0.5, 
1, and 3 kGy and stored at 4 ± 1 °C for 15 days. Five days after irradiation, 
the chemical and organoleptic changes in the quail meat were evaluated for 15 
days. Total volatile basic nitrogen and TBA were also measured to investigate 
chemical changes.
RESULTS: Irradiation significantly reduced the amount of total volatile basic 
nitrogen in irradiated samples. Furthermore, the increase of TBA level was 
significant in irradiated samples, which had a direct correlation with 
irradiation dose and storage/shelf life duration. Despite the increase of 
thiobarbituric acid, irradiation had no significant effect on the sensory 
properties of quail meat.
CONCLUSION: Irradiation of quilt meat resulted in extension of the meat shelf 
life to at least two weeks at refrigeration temperature by decreasing the 
corrosion-causing microorganisms and improving microbial quality, while the 
sensory properties of meat were preserved. Regarding the increase in the 
oxidation level at high doses of the electron beam and the absence of 
significant differences in the studied dosages in reducing the total amount of 
total volatile basic nitrogen, it is recommended to apply electron beam 
irradiation at doses of 1.5 and 3 kGy to extend the meat shelf life and preserve 
the quality/health of the quail meat.

Life expectancy has considerably increased over the last decades. The negative 
consequence of this augmented longevity has been a dramatic increase of 
age-related chronic neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's 
and multiple sclerosis. Epidemiology is telling us there exists a strong 
correlation between the neuronal loss characterizing these disorders and 
metabolic dysfunction. This review aims at presenting the evidence supporting 
the existence of a molecular system linking metabolism with neurodegeneration, 
with a specific focus on the role of two hormones with a key role in the 
regulatory cross talk between metabolic imbalance and the damage of nervous 
system: leptin and ghrelin. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 
'Metabolic Impairment as Risk Factors for Neurodegenerative Disorders.'

HYPOTHESIS: This study assessed, if there was a difference in surgical decision 
making for metastatic humeral lesions based on; orthopaedic subspecialty, tumor 
characteristics.
STUDY TYPE: Cross sectional survey study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four case scenarios were created by combining: 
tumor type, life expectancy, fracture type, and anatomical location. 
Participants were asked for every case: what treatment would you recommend? 
Participants were 78 (48%) orthopaedic oncologists and 83 (52%) orthopaedic 
surgeons that were not regularly involved in the treatment of bone tumors.
RESULTS: There was a difference between orthopaedic oncologists and other 
subspecialty surgeons in recommendation for specific treatments: intramedullary 
nailing was less often recommended by orthopaedic oncologists (53%, 95%CI: 
47-59) compared to other surgeons (62%, 95%CI: 57-67) (p=0.023); while 
endoprosthetic reconstruction (orthopaedic oncologists: 8.8% [95%CI: 6.6-11], 
other surgeons: 3.6%[95%CI: 2.3-4.8], p<0.001) and plate-screw fixation 
(orthopaedic oncologists: 19%[95%CI: 14-25], other surgeons: 9.5%[95%CI: 
5.9-13], p=0.003) were more often recommended by orthopaedic oncologists. There 
was no difference in recommendation for nonoperative management. There were 
differences in recommendation for specific treatments based on tumor type, life 
expectancy, and anatomical location, but not fracture type.
DISCUSSION: Subspecialty training and patient and tumor characteristics 
influence the decision for operative management and the decision for a specific 
implant in metastatic humeral fractures.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3.

BACKGROUND: Controversy exists about the differences in air pollution exposure 
and inhalation dose between mode of transport. We aimed to review air pollution 
exposure and inhaled dose according to mode of transport and pollutant and their 
effect in terms of years of life expectancy (YLE).
METHODS: In this systematic review, we searched ten online databases from 
inception to April 13, 2016, without language or temporal restrictions, for 
cohort, cross-sectional, and experimental studies that compared exposure to 
carbon monoxide, black carbon, nitrogen dioxide, and fine and coarse particles 
in active commuters (pedestrian or cyclist) and commuters using motorised 
transport (car, motorcycle, bus, or massive motorised transport [MMT-ie, train, 
subway, or metro]). We excluded studies that measured air pollution exposure 
exclusively with biomarkers or on the basis of simulated data, reviews, 
comments, consensuses, editorials, guidelines, in-vitro studies, meta-analyses, 
ecological studies, and protocols. We extracted average exposure and commuting 
time per mode of transport and pollutant to calculate inhaled doses. We 
calculated exposure and inhaled dose ratios using active commuters as the 
reference and summarised them with medians and IQRs. We also calculated 
differences in YLE due to fine particle inhaled dose and physical activity.
FINDINGS: We identified 4037 studies, of which 39 were included in the 
systematic review. Overall, car commuters had higher exposure to all pollutants 
than did active commuters in 30 (71%) of 42 comparisons (median ratio 1·22 [IQR 
0·90-1·76]), followed by those who commuted by bus in 57 (52%) of 109 (1·0 
[0·79-1·41]), by motorcycle in 16 (50%) of 32 (0·99 [0·86-1·38]), by a car with 
controlled ventilation settings in 39 (45%) of 86 (0·95 [0·66-1·54]), and by MMT 
in 21 (38%) of 55 (0·67 [0·49-1·13]). Overall, active commuters had higher 
inhalation doses than did commuters using motorised transport (median ratio car 
with controlled ventilation settings 0·16 [0·10-0·28]; car 0·22 [0·15-0·30]; 
motorcycle 0·38 [0·26-0·78]; MMT 0·49 [0·34-0·81]; bus 0·72 [IQR 0·50-0·99]). 
Commuters using motorised transport lost up to 1 year in YLE more than did 
cyclists.
INTERPRETATION: Proximity to traffic and high air interchange increased the 
exposure to air pollution of commuters using motorised transport. Larger 
inhalation rates and commuting time increased inhaled dose among active 
commuters. Benefits of active commuting from physical activity are larger than 
the risk from an increased inhaled dose of fine particles.

Over the years, the life expectancy for individuals with Down syndrome (DS) has 
increased significantly. This fact involves a higher risk for developing 
numerous medical conditions associated with the aging of adults with DS. A high 
level of awareness is required by the professional, due to the lack of clinical 
expressiveness and their higher pain threshold, often makes the diagnosis 
difficult. Health care professionals must be aware of the specific 
recommendations for the appropriate care of the adult population with DS. The 
aim of this article is to describe the most frequent comorbidities in adults 
with DS adults, to summarise the specific preventive recommendations after 
comparing the main guidelines published, and to evaluate them according to their 
specific needs.

Metastatic Osseous Pain Control: Radiation Therapy.

Kang J(1), Formenti SC(1).

Author information:

Cornell Medical Center, New York, New York.

Metastatic disease to the bone is a common manifestation of advanced cancer, and 
can result in pain, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and overall functional 
compromise. External beam radiation is a proven, highly efficacious, and 
noninvasive therapy that can provide symptomatic relief from painful osseous 
lesions. When deciding upon the best treatment regimen, it is important to 
consider patient factors such as overall life expectancy, performance status, 
disease burden, and site of osseous metastatic pain. Determination of best 
treatment ideally requires multidisciplinary input from radiologists, medical 
oncologists, surgeons, pain management, and palliative care specialists together 
with radiation oncologists.

Nociceptive and/or neuropathic pain can be present in all phases of cancer 
(early and metastatic) and are not adequately treated in 56 to 82.3% of 
patients. In these patients, radiotherapy achieves overall pain responses 
(complete and partial responses combined) up to 60 and 61%. On the other hand, 
nowadays, ablation is included in clinical guidelines for bone metastases and 
the technique is governed by level I evidence. Depending on the location of the 
lesion in the peripheral skeleton, either the Mirels scoring or the Harrington 
(alternatively the Levy) grading system can be used for prophylactic fixation 
recommendation. As minimally invasive treatment options may be considered in 
patients with poor clinical status or limited life expectancy, the aim of this 
review is to detail the techniques proposed so far in the literature and to 
report the results in terms of safety and efficacy of ablation and cementoplasty 
(with or without fixation) for bone metastases. Percutaneous image-guided 
treatments appear as an interesting alternative for localized metastatic lesions 
of the peripheral skeleton.

Bleeding is a common and often challenging complication of malignancy. 
Etiologies of hemorrhage in this patient population vary, and bleeding may 
present as an acute, life-threatening emergency or a chronic, low-volume blood 
loss. For patients with advanced malignancies, interventions to manage bleeding 
must be balanced by the patient's life expectancy and quality of life. As such, 
minimally invasive procedures such as transarterial embolization are useful 
therapeutic options in appropriately selected patients. There is a rich history 
of palliative transarterial embolization for refractory bleeding in cancer 
patients. This technique was first applied in the 1970s and has since become an 
established treatment tool for malignancy-related bleeding throughout the body. 
While the preponderance of published data comprised case reports and small 
retrospective studies, the use of embolization continues to expand as experience 
grows and techniques are refined. In this review, we summarize the literature 
and provide our perspective on embolization for refractory bleeding in cancer 
patients.

HIV and the menopause: A review.

Bull L(1), Tittle V(1), Rashid T(1), Nwokolo N(1).

Author information:
(1)9762 Chelsea and Westminster Hospital , London, UK.

Effective antiretroviral therapy has resulted in a close to normal life 
expectancy for people living with HIV. This has led to a shift in the age 
distribution of women living with HIV in the UK, with one in three attending for 
HIV care estimated to be aged 45-56 years in 2014. The lack of experience of 
many HIV physicians in managing menopause, and the perceived complexity of 
managing menopause in women living with HIV by general practitioners means that 
many women are unable to access appropriate care and support. This is aggravated 
by the relative paucity of data on menopause in women living with HIV and 
conflicting results in this field, for example with regard to age of onset of 
menopause and symptomatology experienced. Furthermore, women living with HIV 
have unique considerations such as potential interactions between antiretroviral 
therapy and menopause hormone therapy (previously called hormone replacement 
therapy) and other physiological concerns such as a multifactorial propensity 
towards decreased bone mineral density and potentially increased cardiovascular 
risk. On the whole, menopause hormone therapy is probably underutilised in this 
group of women due to perceived concerns around drug-drug interactions, as well 
as fears shared with women in the general population about menopause hormone 
therapy. Menopausal women should be given adequate information on 
symptomatology, lifestyle modification and treatment options including menopause 
hormone therapy. Furthermore, a holistic approach which considers the increased 
burden of poor mental health in this population is essential.

Cost-Effective Hearing Conservation: Regulatory and Research Priorities.

Dobie RA(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery University of Texas 
Health Science Center at San Antonio Texas, USA.

Hearing conservation programs (HCPs) mandated by the US Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration (OSHA) cost about $350/worker/year. Are they 
cost-effective? A cross-sectional model of the US adult population with and 
without HCPs incorporates (1) the American Medical Association's method for 
estimating binaural hearing impairment and whole-person impairment; (2) the 
model of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for estimating 
both age-related and noise-induced hearing loss; and (3) an acceptable cost of 
$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year. The ISO model's outputs were audiometric 
thresholds for groups of people with different age, sex, and noise exposure 
history. These thresholds were used to estimate cost per quality-adjusted life 
year saved for people in HCPs with different noise exposure levels. Model 
simulations suggest that HCPs may be cost-effective only when time-weighted 
average (TWA) noise exposures are ≥ 90 dBA. Enforcing existing regulations, 
requiring engineering noise control at high exposure levels, and using new 
methods that can document hearing protection device performance could improve 
cost-effectiveness. If the OSHA action level remains at 85 dBA-TWA, reducing the 
permissible exposure limit to the same level would simplify management and 
slightly improve cost-effectiveness. Research should evaluate employer 
compliance across industries, determine whether workers currently excluded from 
HCP regulations are at risk of noise-induced hearing loss, and develop 
cost-effective HCPs for mobile workers in construction, agriculture, and oil and 
gas drilling and servicing. Research on HCP cost-effectiveness could be extended 
to incorporate sensitivity analyses of the effects of a wider range of 
assumptions.

We report the synthesis of guanosine 5'-(4-methylimidazolyl)phosphonate (ICG), 
the third member of a series of nonhydrolyzable nucleoside 
5'-phosphoro-2-methylimidazolide (2-MeImpN) analogues designed for mechanistic 
studies of nonenzymatic RNA primer extension. The addition of a 2-MeImpN monomer 
to a primer is catalyzed by the presence of a downstream activated monomer, yet 
the three nonhydrolyzable analogues do not show catalytic effects under standard 
mildly basic primer extension conditions. Surprisingly, ICG, which has a pKa 
similar to that of 2-MeImpG, is a modest catalyst of nonenzymatic primer 
extension at acidic pH. Here we show that ICG reacts with 2-MeImpC to form a 
stable 5'-5'-imidazole-bridged guanosine-cytosine dinucleotide, with both a 
labile nitrogen-phosphorus and a stable carbon-phosphorus linkage flanking the 
central imidazole bridge. Cognate RNA primer-template complexes react with this 
GC-dinucleotide by attack of the primer 3'-hydroxyl on the activated N-P side of 
the 5'-5'-imidazole bridge. These observations support the hypothesis that 
5'-5'-imidazole-bridged dinucleotides can bind to cognate RNA primer-template 
duplexes and adopt appropriate conformations for subsequent phosphodiester bond 
formation, consistent with our recent mechanistic proposal that the formation of 
activated 5'-5'-imidazolium-bridged dinucleotides is responsible for 
2-MeImpN-driven primer extension.

A temporal trend can be seen in recent human history where the dominant causes 
of death have shifted from infectious to chronic diseases in industrialized 
societies. Human influences in the current "Anthropocene" epoch are 
exponentially impacting the environment and consequentially health. Changing 
ecological niches are suggested to have created health transitions expressed as 
modifications of immune balance from infections inflicting pathologies in the 
Holocene epoch (12,000 years ago) to human behaviors inflicting pathologies
