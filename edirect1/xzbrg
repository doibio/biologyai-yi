out in Campinas (Campinas Health Survey 2008/09) corresponding to 957 people, 
and data from the Mortality Information System (MIS) between 2009 and 2011. 
Prevalences and prevalence ratios were analyzed in order to verify the 
differences between men and women regarding socioeconomic and demographic 
variables, health behaviors, morbidities and consultations in the last two 
weeks. Mortality rates and the ratio between coefficients considering the 
underlying causes of death were calculated.
RESULTS: Women had a greater disadvantage in socioeconomic indicators, chronic 
diseases diagnosed by a health professional and referred health problems as well 
as make more use of health services, while men presented higher frequency of 
most unhealthy behaviors and excessive mortality for all causes investigated.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings contribute to the discussion of gender paradox and 
demonstrate the need to employ health actions that consider the differences 
between men and women in the various health dimensions analyzed. The premature 
male mortality from preventable causes was outstanding, making clear the need 
for more effective prevention and health promotion directed to this segment of 
the population.

Fungal endophytes have shown to affect plant growth and to confer stress 
tolerance to the host; however, effects of endophytes isolated from water plants 
have been poorly investigated. In this study, fungi isolated from stems (stem-E) 
and roots (root-E) of Mentha aquatica L. (water mint) were identified, and their 
morphogenetic properties analysed on in vitro cultured Arabidopsis (L.) Heynh., 
14 and 21 days after inoculation (DAI). Nineteen fungi were analysed and, based 
on ITS analysis, 17 isolates showed to be genetically distinct. The overall 
effect of water mint endophytes on Arabidopsis fresh (FW) and dry weight (DW) 
was neutral and positive, respectively, and the increased DW, mainly occurring 
14 DAI, was possibly related to plant defence mechanism. Only three fungi 
increased both FW and DW of Arabidopsis at 14 and 21 DAI, thus behaving as plant 
growth promoting (PGP) fungi. E-treatment caused a reduction of root depth and 
primary root length in most cases and inhibition-to-promotion of root area and 
lateral root length, from 14 DAI. Only Phoma macrostoma, among the water mint 
PGP fungi, increased both root area and depth, 21 DAI. Root depth and area 14 
DAI were shown to influence DWs, indicating that the extension of the root 
system, and thus nutrient uptake, was an important determinant of plant dry 
biomass. Reduction of Arabidopsis root depth occurred to a great extent when 
plants where treated with stem-E while root area decreased or increased under 
the effects of stem-E and root-E, respectively, pointing to an influence of the 
endophyte origin on root extension. M. aquatica and many other perennial 
hydrophytes have growing worldwide application in water pollution remediation. 
The present study provided a model for directed screening of endophytes able to 
modulate plant growth in the perspective of future field applications of these 
fungi.

Commonly used decision-analytic models for cost-effectiveness analysis simulate 
time in discrete steps. Use of discrete-time steps can introduce errors when 
calculating cumulative outcomes such as costs and quality-adjusted life-years. 
There are a number of myths or misconceptions concerning how to correct these 
errors and the need to do so. This tutorial shows that, by neglecting to apply 
within-cycle (sometimes referred to as half-cycle or continuity) correction 
methods to the results of discrete-time models, the analyst may arrive at the 
wrong recommendation regarding the use of a technology. We show that the 
standard half-cycle correction method results in the same cumulative outcome as 
the trapezoidal rule and life-table method. However, the trapezoidal rule has 
the added advantage of applying the correction at each cycle, not just the 
initial and final cycle. We further show that the Simpson's 1/3 rule is more 
accurate than the trapezoidal rule. We recommend using the Simpson's 1/3 rule in 
the base-case analysis and, if needed, showing the results with other methods in 
the sensitivity analysis. We also demonstrate that both the trapezoidal and 
Simpson's rules can easily be implemented in commonly used software.

Independent researchers have reported an alarming decline in life expectancy 
after 1990 among US non-Hispanic whites with less than a high school education. 
However, US educational attainment rose dramatically during the twentieth 
century; thus, focusing on changes in mortality rates of those not completing 
high school means looking at a different, shrinking, and increasingly vulnerable 
segment of the population in each year. We analyzed US data to examine the 
robustness of earlier findings categorizing education in terms of relative rank 
in the overall distribution of each birth cohort, instead of by credentials such 
as high school graduation. Estimating trends in mortality for the bottom 
quartile, we found little evidence that survival probabilities declined 
dramatically. We conclude that widely publicized estimates of worsening 
mortality rates among non-Hispanic whites with low socioeconomic position are 
highly sensitive to how educational attainment is classified. However, 
non-Hispanic whites with low socioeconomic position, especially women, are not 
sharing in improving life expectancy, and disparities between US blacks and 
whites are entrenched. Findings underscore the urgency of an agenda to equitably 
disseminate new medical technologies and to deepen knowledge of social 
determinants of health and how that knowledge can be applied, to promote the 
objective of achieving population health equity.

BACKGROUND: This study attempted to examine the discordance between family 
caregivers and cancer patients in their poor-prognosis disclosure preferences in 
mainland China and then ascertained the associations between quality of life 
(QoL), perceived stress, and poor-prognosis disclosure preferences.
METHODS: Six hundred fifty-one pairs of inpatients and their matched caregivers 
(participation rate = 92.2%) were recruited in this cross-sectional survey. A 
set of paired self-administered questionnaires were completed independently by 
patient-caregiver dyads.
RESULTS: Fewer family caregivers than cancer patients felt that poor prognosis 
should be disclosed to patients (61.2% vs. 90.0%, p < 0.001). Patients' positive 
poor-prognosis disclosure preference was associated with patients' better QoL 
(p < 0.05) and caregivers' reduced perceived stress levels (p = 0.013). However, 
caregivers' poor-prognosis disclosure preference correlated only with their own 
physical state (p = 0.028). Moreover, the caregivers who concurred with patients 
in positive poor-prognosis disclosure preference were more likely to experience 
a better QoL (p < 0.05) and lower perceived stress levels (p = 0.048) in the 
III-IV stage subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant discrepancy in poor-prognosis disclosure 
preference between cancer patients and caregivers in China. The caregivers' 
preference of concealing poor prognosis from patients was not related to cancer 
patients' QoL or perceived stress. In addition, caregivers had better QoL and 
lower stress levels when they held the same positive poor-prognosis disclosure 
preference as the patients. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

BACKGROUND: Increases in population and life expectancy of Americans may result 
in shortages of endocrinologists by 2020. This study aims to assess variations 
in geographic accessibility to endocrinologists in the US, by age group at state 
and county levels, and by urban/rural status, and distance.
METHODS: We used the 2012 National Provider Identifier Registry to obtain office 
locations of all adult and pediatric endocrinologists in the US. The population 
with geographic access to an endocrinologist within a series of 6 distance 
radii, centered on endocrinologist practice locations, was estimated using the 
US Census 2010 block-level population. We assumed that persons living within the 
same circular buffer zone of an endocrinologist location have the same 
geographic accessibility to that endocrinologist. The geographic accessibility 
(the percentage of the population with geographic access to at least one 
endocrinologist) and the population-to-endocrinologist ratio for each geographic 
area were estimated.
RESULTS: By using 20 miles as the distance radius, geographic accessibility to 
at least one pediatric/adult endocrinologist for age groups 0-17, 18-64, and ≥ 
65 years was 64.1%, 85.4%, and 82.1%. The overall population-to-endocrinologist 
ratio within 20 miles was 39,492:1 for children, 29,887:1 for adults aged 18-64 
years, and 6,194:1 for adults aged ≥ 65 years. These ratios varied considerably 
by state, county, urban/rural status, and distance.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that there are geographic variations of 
accessibility to endocrinologists in the US. The areas with poorer geographic 
accessibility warrant further study of the effect of these variations on disease 
prevention, detection, and management of endocrine diseases in the US 
population. Our findings of geographic access to endocrinologists also may 
provide valuable information for medical education and health resources 
allocation.

Comment in
    Curr Biol. 2016 Mar 7;26(5):R202-4.

Senescence, the increase in mortality and decline in fertility with age after 
maturity, was thought to be inevitable for all multicellular species capable of 
repeated breeding. Recent theoretical advances and compilations of data suggest 
that mortality and fertility trajectories can go up or down, or remain constant 
with age, but the data are scanty and problematic. Here, we present compelling 
evidence for constant age-specific death and reproduction rates in Hydra, a 
basal metazoan, in a set of experiments comprising more than 3.9 million days of 
observations of individual Hydra. Our data show that 2,256 Hydra from two 
closely related species in two laboratories in 12 cohorts, with cohort age 
ranging from 0 to more than 41 y, have extremely low, constant rates of 
mortality. Fertility rates for Hydra did not systematically decline with 
advancing age. This falsifies the universality of the theories of the evolution 
of aging that posit that all species deteriorate with age after maturity. The 
nonsenescent life history of Hydra implies levels of maintenance and repair that 
are sufficient to prevent the accumulation of damage for at least decades after 
maturity, far longer than the short life expectancy of Hydra in the wild. A high 
proportion of stem cells, constant and rapid cell turnover, few cell types, a 
simple body plan, and the fact that the germ line is not segregated from the 
soma are characteristics of Hydra that may make nonsenescence feasible. 
Nonsenescence may be optimal because lifetime reproduction may be enhanced more 
by extending adult life spans than by increasing daily fertility.

Reduced growth hormone signaling and methionine restriction: interventions that 
improve metabolic health and extend life span.

Brown-Borg HM(1).

Medicine and Health Sciences, Grand Forks, North Dakota.

Interventions that improve health are often associated with longevity. Reduced 
growth hormone signaling has been shown to increase life span in mice by over 
50%. Similarly, reductions in dietary intake of methionine, in rats and mice, 
result in life-span extension. Many factors affect metabolic health, 
mitochondrial function, and resistance to stressors, each of which influence 
aging and life span. This paper presents a comparison of these two 
interventions, as well as the results of a study combining these interventions, 
to understand potential mechanisms underlying their effectiveness in enhancing 
healthy aging.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence and losses in quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) associated with 20 child health conditions.
METHODS: Using data from the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special 
Health Care Needs, preference weights were applied to 14 functional difficulties 
to summarize the quality of life burden of 20 health conditions.
RESULTS: Among the 14 functional difficulties, "a little trouble with breathing" 
had the highest prevalence (37.1 %), but amounted to a loss of just 0.16 QALYs 
from the perspective of US adults. Though less prevalent, "a lot of behavioral 
problems" and "chronic pain" were associated with the greatest losses (1.86 and 
3.43 QALYs). Among the 20 conditions, allergies and asthma were the most 
prevalent but were associated with the least burden. Muscular dystrophy and 
cerebral palsy were among the least prevalent and most burdensome. Furthermore, 
a scatterplot shows the association between condition prevalence and burden.
CONCLUSIONS: In child health, condition prevalence is negatively associated with 
quality of life burden from the perspective of US adults. Both should be 
considered carefully when evaluating the appropriate role for public health 
prevention and interventions.

BACKGROUND: Sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) provides a useful adjunct 
relative to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) alone. It can 
provide early warning of the onset of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia and has the 
functionality to suspend insulin delivery if sensor glucose levels fall below a 
predefined threshold. The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of SAP with 
low glucose suspend (LGS) versus CSII alone in type 1 diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the CORE 
Diabetes Model, using published clinical input data. The analysis was performed 
in two cohorts: one with uncontrolled glycated hemoglobin at baseline and one at 
elevated risk for hypoglycemic events. The analysis was conducted from a 
healthcare payer perspective over a lifetime time horizon; future costs and 
clinical outcomes were discounted at 4% per annum.
RESULTS: In patients with uncontrolled glycated hemoglobin at baseline, 
SAP + LGS resulted in improved discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy 
(QALE) versus CSII (10.55 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] vs. 9.36 QALYs) 
but higher mean lifetime direct costs (€84,972 vs. €49,171) resulting in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €30,163 per QALY gained. In 
patients at elevated risk for hypoglycemia, the ICER was €22,005 per QALY gained 
for SAP + LGS versus CSII as lifetime costs were higher (€88,680 vs. €57,097), 
but QALE was also higher (18.46 QALYs vs. 18.30 QALYs).
CONCLUSIONS: In France, projected improvements in outcomes with SAP + LGS versus 
CSII translated into an ICER generally considered as good value for money, 
particularly in patients who experience frequent and/or problematic hypoglycemic 
events.

OBJECTIVE: The chance to improve survival from pancreatic adenocarcinoma relies 
on early diagnosis through screening, but any screening program is subject to 
lead-time bias and no data are available in this regard. Aim of the present 
study was to evaluate the benefit obtainable from a screening program for early 
detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, considering screen-related biases.
METHODS: Monte Carlo simulation was performed using data from 1000 pancreatic 
cancer patients admitted in a tertiary referral hospital and from pertinent 
literature. Lead-time bias was assessed and subtracted from expected survival.
RESULTS: Mean expected life expectancy was 13.0 months. Assuming a 20%, 30%, or 
50% stage III/IV reduction with screening, pancreatic resections would increase 
from 217 to 290 in front of a 20% stage III/IV reduction to 324 in front of a 
30% reduction and to 385 in front of a 50% reduction. After lead-time 
adjustment, life expectancies were 14.0, 14.6, and 15.9 months, respectively. 
The number-needed-to-screen calculation suggests that screening can be harmful 
in a proportion of patients inversely dependent on the length of follow-up and a 
significant improvement of survival after diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma screening program would probably be 
successful in the presence of a considerable improvement of postdiagnostic 
survival; otherwise, it only increases surgical procedure amount.

OBJECTIVES: A considerable gap exists in health and social emotional well-being 
between Indigenous people and non-Indigenous Australians. Recent research in 
stress neurobiology highlights biological pathways that link early adversity and 
traumas as well as life stresses to ill health. We argue that the 
neurobiological stress response and its maladaptive changes, termed allostatic 
load, provide a useful framework to understand how adversity leads to physical 
and mental illness in Indigenous people. In this paper we review the biology of 
allostatic load and make links between stress-induced systemic hormonal, 
metabolic and immunological changes and physical and mental illnesses.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to chronic stress throughout life results in an increased 
allostatic load that may contribute to a number of metabolic, cardiovascular and 
mental disorders that shorten life expectancy in Indigenous Australians.

BACKGROUND: The cumulative incidence of periprosthetic fractures around the knee 
is increasing further because of an extended indication for knee replacement, 
previous revision arthroplasty, rising life expectancy and comorbidities.
AIM OF THE WORK: The relevance of local parameters such as malalignment, osseous 
defects, neighbouring implants, aseptic loosening and low-grade infections may 
sometimes be hidden behind the manifestation of a traumatic fracture. A 
differentiated diagnostic approach before the treatment of a periprosthetic 
fracture is of paramount importance, while the physician in-charge should also 
have particular expertise in fracture treatment and in advanced techniques of 
revision endoprosthetics. The following work gives an overview of this topic.
RESULTS: Valid classifications are available for categorising periprosthetic 
fractures of the femur, the tibia and the patella respectively, which are 
helpful for the selection of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: With the wide-ranging modern treatment portfolio bearing in mind 
the substantial rate of complications and the heterogeneous functional outcome, 
the adequate analysis of fracture aetiology and the corresponding transformation 
into an individualised treatment concept offer the chance of an acceptable 
functional restoration of the patient at early full weight-bearing and prolonged 
implant survival. The management of complications is crucial to the final 
outcome.

Single-gene mutations that extend longevity have revealed regulatory pathways 
related to aging and longevity. RPD3 is a conserved histone deacetylase (Class I 
HDAC). Previously we showed that Drosophila rpd3 mutations increase longevity. 
Here we tested the longevity effects of RPD3 on multiple nutrient levels. 
Dietary restriction (DR) has additive effects on RPD3-mediated longevity 
extension, but the effect may be modestly attenuated relative to controls. RPD3 
and DR therefore appear to operate by distinct but interacting mechanisms. Since 
RPD3 regulates transcription, the mRNA levels for two proteins involved in 
nutrient signaling, 4E-BP and Tor, were examined in rpd3 mutant flies. 4E-BP 
mRNA was reduced under longevity-increasing conditions. Epistasis between RPD3 
and 4E-BP with regard to longevity was then tested. Flies only heterozygous for 
a mutation in Thor, the 4E-BP gene, have modestly decreased life spans. Flies 
mutant for both rpd3 and Thor show a superposition of a large RPD3-mediated 
increase and a small Thor-mediated decrease in longevity at all food levels, 
consistent with each gene product having distinct effects on life span. However, 
DR-mediated extension was absent in males carrying both mutations and lessened 
in females. Our results support the view that multiple discrete but interacting 
mechanisms regulate longevity.

In the late 1980s, a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding for the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel was 
identified to be the primary cause of cystic fibrosis (CF); a fatal 
multiple-organ disorder that mostly affects Caucasians. To date, approximately 
2000 genetic mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene 
(http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/app). The most common cause of morbidity 
and mortality in persons with CF is a progressive deterioration in lung function 
leading ultimately to respiratory collapse. The median life expectancy of CF 
patients currently is estimated to be 39 years in the US. The most prevalent 
CFTR mutation, F508del, accounts for 70% of CF cases and causes a processing 
defect in the protein leading to premature endoplasmic reticulum-associated 
degradation (ERAD) and reduced F508del-CFTR delivery to the cell surface. A CF 
corrector is defined as a chemical chaperone that increases cell-surface levels 
of F508del-CFTR. A series of CF correctors have been developed, and VX-809 
(lumacaftor) has been cited as the most effective symptomatic CF corrector to 
date. VX-809 improves the function of the mutant protein by approximately 15% in 
in vitro culture systems. However, this effect did not completely translate 
clinically, with only a marginal improvement observed in lung function of the 
F508del-homozygous patients undergoing the therapy. New studies revealed that 
even after successful ER retrieval, rescued F508del-CFTR (rF508del-CFTR) once at 
the cell surface does not function properly, exhibiting poor stability and 
channel gating and structural abnormalities. This becomes further complicated by 
the existence of genes termed CFTR modifiers, which can alter CFTR function to 
be additionally defective and exacerbate the CF phenotype while also 
alternatively suggested be potentially targeted to improve F508del-CFTR 
functional outcome. It is necessary to understand the biology of F508del-CFTR 
post-ER and at the plasma membrane where the protein might also confront the 
modifiers and how we can incorporate these components into CF therapeutics. 
Additionally, the notion that CF individuals would eventually benefit from more 
of a personalized medicine is becoming increasingly accepted. Here, we review 
how CF therapeutics may be simplified by understanding the complexities of 
rescued F508del-CFTR biology and eventually move toward more personalized 
medicine for patients suffering with CF.

Recently, dRYamides-1 and -2 have been identified as ligands of the neuropeptide 
Y-like receptor CG5811 in Drosophila melanogaster. It has also been reported in 
brief that injection of dRYamide-1suppresses the early feeding behavior called 
proboscis extension reflex (PER) in the blowfly Phormia regina. 
Immunohistochemical analyses by our group using anti-dRYamide-1 antiserum 
indicated symmetrical localization of 32 immunoreactive cells in the brain of P. 
regina. In order to analyze the mechanism of feeding regulation, we further 
investigated the effects of dRYamide-1 and -2 on intake volume, PER exhibition, 
and activity of the sugar receptor neuron. After injection of dRYamide-1 or -2, 
flies showed little change in the intake volume of sucrose solution, but a 
significant depression of PER to sucrose. Injection of dRYamide-1 revealed a 
significant decrease in the responsiveness of the sugar receptor neuron, 
although the injection of dRYamide-2 did not. These results suggest that the 
dRYamide peptides decrease feeding motivation in flies, as evaluated by PER 
threshold, through a mechanism that partially involves desensitization of the 
sugar receptor neuron.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common life-shortening genetic 
diseases, has no cure, but people living with it have seen improvements in their 
health and survival. The rising life expectancy and increased availability of 
treatment options has likely increased the lifetime costs of people living with 
CF. In addition, a recent drug approval for a therapy that targets the cause of 
the disease is one of the most expensive drugs worldwide. In light of these 
circumstances, it is important to have an updated understanding of the costs of 
CF therapy and management. This study aims to determine the extent of available 
literature that quantifies CF costs.
METHODS: We used a scoping review framework to identify the sources and types of 
evidence available to determine the costs of CF therapy and management compared 
to the general population or a comparable population of people with other 
complex chronic conditions. We searched 14 databases for peer-reviewed studies 
and grey literature published in English since 1998. The search was conducted in 
August 2013 and updated in October 2014.
RESULTS: We identified 28 studies that estimated overall, general CF costs. Of 
these, three studies compare CF costs to healthcare costs of a general 
population and only one of those provides a direct comparison of CF costs to the 
general population in order to calculate the incremental cost associated with 
CF. We estimate there are 98 systematic reviews that quantify the costs of 
comparable conditions and potentially provide a comparison group for people with 
CF.
CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence available that attempts to quantify overall, 
general healthcare costs of people with CF, although much of it is outdated. 
However, there is much less evidence available that provides a comparison of 
these costs with either the general population or people with comparable 
conditions.

OBJECTIVE: To study the cost-utility of simultaneous bilateral cochlear 
implantation (CI) versus unilateral CI.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial (RCT).
SETTING: Five tertiary referral centers.
PATIENTS: Thirty-eight postlingually deafened adults eligible for cochlear 
implantation.
INTERVENTIONS: A cost-utility analysis was performed from a health insurance 
perspective.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Utility was assessed using the HUI3, TTO, VAS on hearing, 
VAS on general health and EQ-5D. We modeled the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of unilateral versus bilateral CI over periods 
of 2, 5, 10, 25 years, and actual life-expectancy.
RESULTS: Direct costs for unilateral and bilateral CI were €43,883 ± €11,513(SD) 
and €87,765 ± €23,027(SD) respectively. Annual costs from the second year onward 
were €3,435 ± €1,085(SD) and €6,871 ± €2,169(SD), respectively. A cost-utility 
analysis revealed that a second implant became cost-effective after a 5- to 
10-year period, based on the HUI3, TTO, and VAS on hearing.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study that describes a cost-utility analysis to 
compare unilateral with simultaneous bilateral CI in postlingually deafened 
adults, using a multicenter RCT. Compared with accepted societal 
willingness-to-pay thresholds, simultaneous bilateral CI is a cost-effective 
treatment for patients with a life expectancy of 5-10 years or longer.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effect of country-level school 
life expectancy on Tuberculosis (TB) incidence to gain further understanding of 
substantial variation in TB incidence across Europe.
METHODS: An ecological study examined the prospective association between 
baseline country-level education in 2000 measured by school life expectancy and 
TB incidence in 2000-2010 in 40 countries of the WHO European region using 
quantile regression. Subsequently, to validate the ecological associations 
between education and TB incidence, an individual-level analysis was performed 
using case-based data in 29 EU/EEA countries from the European Surveillance 
System (TESSy) and simulating a theoretical control group.
RESULTS: The ecological analysis showed that baseline school life expectancy had 
a negative prospective association with TB incidence. We observed consistent 
negative effects of school life expectancy on individuals' TB infections 
prospectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggests that country-level education is an 
important determinant of individual-level TB infection in the region, and in the 
absence of a social determinants indicator that is routinely collected for 
reportable infectious diseases, the adoption of country-level education for 
reportable infectious diseases would significantly advance the field.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term outcome after stereotactic radiosurgery 
(SRS) for temporal bone paragangliomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 11 
patients with temporal bone paragangliomas (10 patients with a glomus jugulare 
tumor and 1 patient with a glomus tympanicum tumor) treated between January 1997 
and July 2012 at the University of Florida with SRS to a median dose of 15 Gy in 
1 fraction. Ten previously unirradiated patients received SRS as did 1 patient 
who received prior fractionated radiotherapy (FRT) and then received salvage SRS 
for a local recurrence. The major outcome endpoint was local control, meaning no 
further growth or shrinkage on follow-up computed tomography or magnetic 
resonance imaging scans.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 5.3 years. Two patients developed a local 
recurrence after SRS, including the patient who received salvage SRS after prior 
FRT. The overall local control rates at 5 and 10 years were both 81%. The 
cause-specific survival rates at 5 and 10 years were both 88%. The distant 
metastasis-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were both 100%. The overall 
survival rates at 5 and 10 years were both 78%. There were no severe 
complications.
CONCLUSIONS: SRS for benign head and neck paragangliomas is a safe and 
efficacious treatment associated with minimal morbidity. SRS is suitable for 
patients with skull base tumors <3 cm when FRT is logistically unsuitable. 
Surgery is reserved for patients in good health whose risk of associated 
morbidity is low. Observation is a reasonable option for asymptomatic patients 
with a limited life expectancy.
