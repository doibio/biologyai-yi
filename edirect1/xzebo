INTRODUCTION: Data are lacking on the extent to which patients with non-valvular 
atrial fibrillation (AF) who are aged ≥80 years benefit from ablation treatment. 
The question pertains especially to patients' postablation quality of life (QoL) 
and long-term clinical outcomes.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are initiating a prospective, registry-based, 
multicentre observational study that will include patients aged ≥80 years with 
non-valvular AF who choose to undergo treatment by catheter ablation and, for 
comparison, such patients who do not choose to undergo ablation (either 
according to their physician's advice or their own preference). Study subjects 
are to be enrolled from 52 participant hospitals and three clinics located 
throughout Japan from 1 June 2022 to 31 December 2023, and each will be followed 
up for 1 year. The planned sample size is 660, comprising 220 ablation group 
patients and 440 non-ablation group patients. The primary endpoint will be the 
composite incidence of stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or systemic 
embolism (SE), another cardiovascular event, major bleeding and/or death from 
any cause. Other clinical events such as postablation AF recurrence, a fall or 
bone fracture will be recorded. We will collect standard clinical background 
information plus each patient's Clinical Frailty Scale score, AF-related 
symptoms, QoL (Five-Level Version of EQ-5D) scores, Mini-Mental State 
Examination (optional) score and laboratory test results, including measures of 
nutritional status, on entry into the study and 1 year later, and serial changes 
in symptoms and QoL will also be secondary endpoints. Propensity score matching 
will be performed to account for covariates that could affect study results.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki and 
the Ethical Guidelines for Clinical Studies issued by the Ministry of Health, 
Labour and Welfare, Japan. Results of the study will be published in one or more 
peer-reviewed journals.

BACKGROUND: The emergence of COVID-19 has resulted in health, socio-economic, 
and political crises. The overall health impact of this disease can be measured 
by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) which is the sum of the life years 
lost due to disability (YLDs) and the years life lost due to premature death 
(YLLs). The overarching objective of this systematic review was to identify the 
health burdens of COVID-19 and summarise the literature that can aid health 
regulators to make evidence-based decisions on COVID-19 mitigation strategies.
METHODS: This systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. 
DALYs-based primary studies were collected from databases, manual searches, and 
included studies' references. The primary studies published in English language, 
conducted since the emergence of COVID-19, and using DALYs or its subsets (years 
life lost due to disability and/or years life lost due to premature death) as 
health impact metrics, were the inclusion criteria. The combined disability and 
mortality health impact of COVID-19 was measured in DALYs. The risk of bias due 
to literature selection, identification, and reporting processes was assessed 
using the Joanna Bridges Institute critical appraisal tool for cross-sectional 
studies, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE Pro tool.
RESULT: Of the 1459 identified studies, twelve of them were eligible for 
inclusion in the review. The years life lost due to COVID-19 related mortality 
was dominant over the years life lost due to COVID-19 related disability 
(disability times from the onset of COVID-19 to recovery, from diseases 
occurrence to mortality, and the long-term consequences of COVID-19) in all 
included studies. The long-term consequence disability time and the pre-death 
disability time were not assessed by most of the reviewed articles.
CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID-19 on both the length and quality of life has 
been substantial and has been causing considerable health crises worldwide. The 
health burden of COVID-19 was greater than other infectious diseases. Further 
studies focussing on issues examining increasing preparedness for future 
pandemics, public sensitization, and multi-sectorial integration are 
recommended.

BACKGROUND: Cancer remains a global health concern and constitutes an important 
barrier to increasing life expectancy. Malignant cells rapidly develop drug 
resistance leading to many clinical therapeutic failures. The importance of 
medicinal plants as an alternative to classical drug discovery to fight cancer 
is well known. Brucea antidysenterica is an African medicinal plant 
traditionally used to treat cancer, dysentery, malaria, diarrhea, stomach aches, 
helminthic infections, fever, and asthma. The present work was designed to 
identify the cytotoxic constituents of Brucea antidysenterica on a broad range 
of cancer cell lines and to demonstrate the mode of induction of apoptosis of 
the most active samples.
METHODS: Seven phytochemicals were isolated from the leaves (BAL) and stem (BAS) 
extract of Brucea antidysenterica by column chromatography and structurally 
elucidated using spectroscopic techniques. The antiproliferative effects of the 
crude extracts and compounds against 9 human cancer cell lines were evaluated by 
the resazurin reduction assay (RRA). The activity in cell lines was assessed by 
the Caspase-Glo assay. The cell cycle distribution, apoptosis via propidium 
iodide (PI) staining, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) through 
5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide 
(JC-1) staining, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) via 
2´,7´-dichlorodihydrofluoresceine diacetate (H2DCFH-DA) staining, were 
investigated by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Phytochemical studies of the botanicals (BAL and BAS) led to the 
isolation of seven compounds. BAL and its constituents 3, 
(3-(3-Methyl-1-oxo-2-butenyl))1H indole (1) and hydnocarpin (2), as well as the 
reference compound, doxorubicin, had antiproliferative activity against 9 cancer 
cell lines. The IC50 values varied from 17.42 µg/mL (against CCRF-CEM leukemia 
cells) to 38.70 µg/mL (against HCT116 p53-/- colon adenocarcinoma cells) for 
BAL, from 19.11 µM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 47.50 µM (against MDA-MB-231-BCRP 
adenocarcinoma cells) for compound 1, and from 4.07 µM (against MDA-MB-231-pcDNA 
cells) to 11.44 µM (against HCT116 p53+/+ cells) for compound 2. Interestingly, 
hypersensitivity of resistant cancer cells to compound 2 was also observed. BAL 
and hydnocarpin induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells mediated by caspase 
activation, the alteration of MMP, and increased ROS levels.
CONCLUSION: BAL and its constituents, mostly compound 2, are potential 
antiproliferative products from Brucea antidysenterica. Other studies will be 
necessary in the perspective of the discovery of new antiproliferative agents to 
fight against resistance to anticancer drugs.

BACKGROUND: Food insecurity adversely affects human health, which means food 
security and nutrition are crucial to improving people's health outcomes. Both 
food insecurity and health outcomes are the policy and agenda of the 2030 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, there is a lack of macro-level 
empirical studies (Macro-level study means studies at the broadest level using 
variables that represent a given country or the whole population of a country or 
economy as a whole. For example, if the urban population (% of the total 
population) of XYZ country is 30%, it is used as a proxy variable to represent 
represent country's urbanization level. Empirical study implies studies that 
employ the econometrics method, which is the application of math and 
statistics.) concerning the relationship between food insecurity and health 
outcomes in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries though the region is highly 
affected by food insecurity and its related health problems. Therefore, this 
study aims to examine the impact of food insecurity on life expectancy and 
infant mortality in SSA countries.
METHODS: The study was conducted for the whole population of 31 sampled SSA 
countries selected based on data availability. The study uses secondary data 
collected online from the databases of the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP), the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), and the World Bank (WB). 
The study uses yearly balanced data from 2001 to 2018. This study employs a 
multicountry panel data analysis and several estimation techniques; it employs 
Driscoll-Kraay standard errors (DKSE), a generalized method of momentum (GMM), 
fixed effects (FE), and the Granger causality test.
RESULTS: A 1% increment in people's prevalence for undernourishment reduces 
their life expectancy by 0.00348 percentage points (PPs). However, life 
expectancy rises by 0.00317 PPs with every 1% increase in average dietary energy 
supply. A 1% rise in the prevalence of undernourishment increases infant 
mortality by 0.0119 PPs. However, a 1% increment in average dietary energy 
supply reduces infant mortality by 0.0139 PPs.
CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity harms the health status of SSA countries, but food 
security impacts in the reverse direction. This implies that to meet SDG 3.2, 
SSA should ensure food security.

OBJECTIVE: Tetralogy of Fallot patients with pulmonary atresia (TOFPA) have a 
largely varying source of pulmonary perfusion with often hypoplastic and even 
absent central pulmonary arteries. A retrospective single center study was 
undertaken to assess outcome of these patients regarding type of surgical 
procedures, long-term mortality, achievement of VSD closure and analysis of 
postoperative interventions.
METHODS: 76 consecutive patients with TOFPA operated between 01.01.2003 and 
31.12.2019 are included in this single center study. Patients with ductus 
dependent pulmonary circulation underwent primary single stage full correction 
including VSD closure and right ventricular to pulmonary conduit implantation 
(RVPAC) or transanular patch reconstruction. Children with hypoplastic pulmonary 
arteries and MAPCAs without double supply were predominantly treated by 
unifocalization and RVPAC implantation. The follow up period ranges between 0 
and 16,5 years.
RESULTS: 31 patients (41%) underwent single stage full correction at a median 
age of 12 days, 15 patients could be treated by a transanular patch. 30 days 
mortality rate in this group was 6%. In the remaining 45 patients the VSD could 
not be closed during their first surgery which was performed at a median age of 
89 days. A VSD closure was achieved later in 64% of these patients after median 
178 days. 30 days mortality rate after the first surgery was 13% in this group. 
The estimated 10-year-survival rate after the first surgery is 80,5% ± 4,7% 
showing no significant difference between the groups with and without MAPCAs 
(p > 0,999). Median intervention-free interval (surgery and transcatheter 
intervention) after VSD closure was 1,7 ± 0,5 years [95% CI: 0,7-2,8 years].
CONCLUSIONS: A VSD closure could be achieved in 79% of the total cohort. In 
patients without MAPCAs this was possible at a significant earlier age 
(p < 0,01). Although patients without MAPCAs predominantly underwent single 
stage full correction at newborn age, the overall mortality rate and the 
interval until reintervention after VSD closure did not show significant 
differences between the two groups with and without MAPCAs. The high rate of 
proven genetic abnormalities (40%) with non-cardiac malformations did also pay 
its tribute to impaired life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: Healthy life expectancy (HLE) remains the principal target of 
various health plans. We aimed to identify the areas of priority and 
determinants of mortality to extend HLE across local governments in Japan.
METHODS: HLE according to secondary medical areas was calculated using the 
Sullivan method. People requiring long-term care of level 2 or higher were 
considered unhealthy. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for major causes of 
death were calculated using vital statistics data. The association between HLE 
and SMR was analyzed using simple and multiple regression analyses.
RESULTS: The average (standard deviation) HLE values were 79.24 (0.85) and 83.76 
(0.62) years for men and women, respectively. A comparison of HLE revealed 
regional health gaps of 4.46 (76.90-81.36) and 3.46 (81.99-85.45) years for men 
and women, respectively. The coefficients of determination for the SMR of 
malignant neoplasms with HLE were the highest and were 0.402 and 0.219 among men 
and women, respectively, followed by those of cerebrovascular diseases, suicide, 
and heart diseases among men and those of heart disease, pneumonia, and liver 
disease among women. When all major preventable causes of death were analyzed 
simultaneously in a regression model, the coefficients of determination were 
0.738 and 0.425 among men and women, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that local governments should prioritize 
preventing cancer deaths via cancer screening and smoking cessation measures in 
health plans, with a special focus on men.

OBJECTIVE: Standards of care and new genetic and molecular therapies have 
contributed to increasing life expectancy of patients with neuromuscular 
diseases (NMDs). This review presents the clinical evidence for an adequate 
transition from pediatric to adult care in patients with NMDs considering both 
physical and psychosocial aspects and attempts at identifying a general pattern 
of transition in the literature that can be used for all patients with NMDs.
METHOD: A search was performed on PubMed, Embase and Scopus using generic terms 
that could be referred to the transition construct specifically related to NMDs. 
A narrative approach was used to summarise the available literature.
RESULTS: Our review shows that few or no studies explored the transition process 
from pediatric to adult care in neuromuscular diseases and tried to identify a 
general pattern of transition applicable to all NMDs.
CONCLUSIONS: A transition process taking into consideration physical, 
psychological, social needs of patient and caregiver could produce positive 
outcomes. However, there is still no unanimous agreement in the literature on 
what it consists of and how to achieve an optimal and effective transition.

Carry-over effects and fitness trade-offs in marine life histories: The costs of 
complexity for adaptation.

Most marine organisms have complex life histories, where the individual stages 
of a life cycle are often morphologically and ecologically distinct. 
Nevertheless, life-history stages share a single genome and are linked 
phenotypically (by "carry-over effects"). These commonalities across the life 
history couple the evolutionary dynamics of different stages and provide an 
arena for evolutionary constraints. The degree to which genetic and phenotypic 
links among stages hamper adaptation in any one stage remains unclear and yet 
adaptation is essential if marine organisms will adapt to future climates. Here, 
we use an extension of Fisher's geometric model to explore how both carry-over 
effects and genetic links among life-history stages affect the emergence of 
pleiotropic trade-offs between fitness components of different stages. We 
subsequently explore the evolutionary trajectories of adaptation of each stage 
to its optimum using a simple model of stage-specific viability selection with 
nonoverlapping generations. We show that fitness trade-offs between stages are 
likely to be common and that such trade-offs naturally emerge through either 
divergent selection or mutation. We also find that evolutionary conflicts among 
stages should escalate during adaptation, but carry-over effects can ameliorate 
this conflict. Carry-over effects also tip the evolutionary balance in favor of 
better survival in earlier life-history stages at the expense of poorer survival 
in later stages. This effect arises in our discrete-generation framework and is, 
therefore, unrelated to age-related declines in the efficacy of selection that 
arise in models with overlapping generations. Our results imply a vast scope for 
conflicting selection between life-history stages, with pervasive evolutionary 
constraints emerging from initially modest selection differences between stages. 
Organisms with complex life histories should also be more constrained in their 
capacity to adapt to global change than those with simple life histories.

Camelina sativa is a self-pollinating and facultative outcrossing oilseed crop. 
Genetic engineering has been used to improve camelina yield potential for 
altered fatty acid composition, modified protein profiles, improved seed and oil 
yield, and enhanced drought resistance. The deployment of transgenic camelina in 
the field posits high risks related to the introgression of transgenes into 
non-transgenic camelina and wild relatives. Thus, effective bioconfinement 
strategies need to be developed to prevent pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) from 
transgenic camelina. In the present study, we overexpressed the cleistogamy 
(i.e. floral petal non-openness)-inducing PpJAZ1 gene from peach in transgenic 
camelina. Transgenic camelina overexpressing PpJAZ1 showed three levels of 
cleistogamy, affected pollen germination rates after anthesis but not during 
anthesis, and caused a minor silicle abortion only on the main branches. We also 
conducted field trials to examine the effects of the overexpressed PpJAZ1 on 
PMGF in the field, and found that the overexpressed PpJAZ1 dramatically 
inhibited PMGF from transgenic camelina to non-transgenic camelina under the 
field conditions. Thus, the engineered cleistogamy using the overexpressed 
PpJAZ1 is a highly effective bioconfinement strategy to limit PMGF from 
transgenic camelina, and could be used for bioconfinement in other dicot 
species.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare nonmalignant clonal 
hematological disorder that is characterized by a deficiency of the GPI-linked 
complement regulators on the membrane of hematopoietic cells, which renders them 
susceptible to complement-mediated damage. Intravascular hemolysis (IVH), 
increased tendency for thrombosis, and bone marrow failure constitutes hallmark 
features of the disease and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. 
The introduction of C5 inhibitors radically changed disease outcomes, offering a 
near-normal life expectancy to PNH patients. However, residual IVH and 
extravascular hemolysis (EVH) continue to occur during C5-inhibitor treatment, 
leaving a significant proportion of patients' anemic and some remaining 
transfusion dependent. Quality of life (QoL) has also been an issue with the 
regular intravenous (IV) administrations of the currently licensed C5 
inhibitors. This has led to the exploration and development of novel agents, 
targeting different parts of the complement cascade, or having different 
formulations allowing for self-administration. Longer-acting and subcutaneous 
formulations of C5 inhibitors have shown equal safety and efficacy, whereas the 
development of proximal complement inhibitors is changing completely the 
therapeutic landscape of PNH, limiting both IVH and EVH and showing superior 
efficacy over C5 inhibitors, especially in improving haemoglobin. Combination 
treatments have also been tested with promising results. This review summarizes 
the current therapeutic options, gaps in anti-complement therapy and discusses 
emerging therapeutic approaches for PNH.

Update of
    medRxiv. 2022 Jun 01;:

The COVID-19 pandemic has had overwhelming global impacts with deleterious 
social, economic, and health consequences. To assess the COVID-19 death toll, 
researchers have estimated declines in 2020 life expectancy at birth (e0). When 
data are available only for COVID-19 deaths, but not for deaths from other 
causes, the risks of dying from COVID-19 are typically assumed to be independent 
of those from other causes. In this research note, we explore the soundness of 
this assumption using data from the United States and Brazil, the countries with 
the largest number of reported COVID-19 deaths. We use three methods: one 
estimates the difference between 2019 and 2020 life tables and therefore does 
not require the assumption of independence, and the other two assume 
independence to simulate scenarios in which COVID-19 mortality is added to 2019 
death rates or is eliminated from 2020 rates. Our results reveal that COVID-19 
is not independent of other causes of death. The assumption of independence can 
lead to either an overestimate (Brazil) or an underestimate (United States) of 
the decline in e0, depending on how the number of other reported causes of death 
changed in 2020.

The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa adapts to solid surfaces to 
enhance virulence and infect its host. Type IV pili (T4P), long and thin 
filaments that power surface-specific twitching motility, allow single cells to 
sense surfaces and control their direction of movement. T4P distribution is 
polarized to the sensing pole by the chemotaxis-like Chp system via a local 
positive feedback loop. However, how the initial spatially resolved mechanical 
signal is translated into T4P polarity is incompletely understood. Here, we 
demonstrate that the two Chp response regulators PilG and PilH enable dynamic 
cell polarization by antagonistically regulating T4P extension. By precisely 
quantifying the localization of fluorescent protein fusions, we show that 
phosphorylation of PilG by the histidine kinase ChpA controls PilG polarization. 
Although PilH is not strictly required for twitching reversals, it becomes 
activated upon phosphorylation and breaks the local positive feedback mechanism 
established by PilG, allowing forward-twitching cells to reverse. Chp thus uses 
a main output response regulator, PilG, to resolve mechanical signals in space 
and employs a second regulator, PilH, to break and respond when the signal 
changes. By identifying the molecular functions of two response regulators that 
dynamically control cell polarization, our work provides a rationale for the 
diversity of architectures often found in non-canonical chemotaxis systems.

We report the formation, growth, and dynamics of model protocell superstructures 
on solid surfaces, resembling single cell colonies. These structures, consisting 
of several layers of lipidic compartments enveloped in a dome-shaped outer lipid 
bilayer, emerged as a result of spontaneous shape transformation of lipid 
agglomerates deposited on thin film aluminum surfaces. Collective protocell 
structures were observed to be mechanically more stable compared to isolated 
spherical compartments. We show that the model colonies encapsulate DNA and 
accommodate nonenzymatic, strand displacement DNA reactions. The membrane 
envelope is able to disassemble and expose individual daughter protocells, which 
can migrate and attach via nanotethers to distant surface locations, while 
maintaining their encapsulated contents. Some colonies feature 
"exocompartments", which spontaneously extend out of the enveloping bilayer, 
internalize DNA, and merge again with the superstructure. A continuum 
elastohydrodynamic theory that we developed suggests that a plausible driving 
force behind subcompartment formation is attractive van der Waals (vdW) 
interactions between the membrane and surface. The balance between membrane 
bending and vdW interactions yields a critical length scale of 236 nm, above 
which the membrane invaginations can form subcompartments. The findings support 
our hypotheses that in extension of the "lipid world hypothesis", protocells may 
have existed in the form of colonies, potentially benefiting from the increased 
mechanical stability provided by a superstructure.

BACKGROUND: Temporary drug treatment cessation might alleviate toxicity without 
substantially compromising efficacy in patients with cancer. We aimed to 
determine if a tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug-free interval strategy was 
non-inferior to a conventional continuation strategy for first-line treatment of 
advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
METHODS: This open-label, non-inferiority, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 
trial was done at 60 hospital sites in the UK. Eligible patients (aged ≥18 
years) had histologically confirmed clear cell renal cell carcinoma, inoperable 
loco-regional or metastatic disease, no previous systemic therapy for advanced 
disease, uni-dimensionally assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumours-defined measurable disease, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) at baseline to 
a conventional continuation strategy or drug-free interval strategy using a 
central computer-generated minimisation programme incorporating a random 
element. Stratification factors were Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
prognostic group risk factor, sex, trial site, age, disease status, tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor, and previous nephrectomy. All patients received standard 
dosing schedules of oral sunitinib (50 mg per day) or oral pazopanib (800 mg per 
day) for 24 weeks before moving into their randomly allocated group. Patients 
allocated to the drug-free interval strategy group then had a treatment break 
until disease progression, when treatment was re-instated. Patients in the 
conventional continuation strategy group continued treatment. Patients, treating 
clinicians, and the study team were aware of treatment allocation. The 
co-primary endpoints were overall survival and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs); non-inferiority was shown if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI 
for the overall survival hazard ratio (HR) was 0·812 or higher and if the lower 
limit of the two-sided 95% CI of the marginal difference in mean QALYs was 
-0·156 or higher. The co-primary endpoints were assessed in the 
intention-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomly assigned 
patients, and the per-protocol population, which excluded patients in the ITT 
population with major protocol violations and who did not begin their 
randomisation allocation as per the protocol. Non-inferiority was to be 
concluded if it was met for both endpoints in both analysis populations. Safety 
was assessed in all participants who received a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The 
trial was registered with ISRCTN, 06473203, and EudraCT, 2011-001098-16.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 13, 2012, and Sept 12, 2017, 2197 patients were screened 
for eligibility, of whom 920 were randomly assigned to the conventional 
continuation strategy (n=461) or the drug-free interval strategy (n=459; 668 
[73%] male and 251 [27%] female; 885 [96%] White and 23 [3%] non-White). The 
median follow-up time was 58 months (IQR 46-73 months) in the ITT population and 
58 months (46-72) in the per-protocol population. 488 patients continued on the 
trial after week 24. For overall survival, non-inferiority was demonstrated in 
the ITT population only (adjusted HR 0·97 [95% CI 0·83 to 1·12] in the ITT 
population; 0·94 [0·80 to 1·09] in the per-protocol population). Non-inferiority 
was demonstrated for QALYs in the ITT population (n=919) and per-protocol 
(n=871) population (marginal effect difference 0·06 [95% CI -0·11 to 0·23] for 
the ITT population; 0·04 [-0·14 to 0·21] for the per-protocol population). The 
most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were hypertension (124 [26%] of 485 
patients in the conventional continuation strategy group vs 127 [29%] of 431 
patients in the drug-free interval strategy group); hepatotoxicity (55 [11%] vs 
48 [11%]); and fatigue (39 [8%] vs 63 [15%]). 192 (21%) of 920 participants had 
a serious adverse reaction. 12 treatment-related deaths were reported (three 
patients in the conventional continuation strategy group; nine patients in the 
drug-free interval strategy group) due to vascular (n=3), cardiac (n=3), 
hepatobiliary (n=3), gastrointestinal (n=1), or nervous system (n=1) disorders, 
and from infections and infestations (n=1).
INTERPRETATION: Overall, non-inferiority between groups could not be concluded. 
However, there seemed to be no clinically meaningful reduction in life 
expectancy between the drug-free interval strategy and conventional continuation 
strategy groups and treatment breaks might be a feasible and cost-effective 
option with lifestyle benefits for patients during tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
therapy in patients with renal cell carcinoma.
