BACKGROUND: The majority of frail elderly who live in long-term care (LTC) are 
not treated for osteoporosis despite their high risk for fragility fractures. 
Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis 
provide guidance for the management of individuals 50 years and older at risk 
for fractures, however, they cannot benefit LTC residents if physicians perceive 
barriers to their application. Our objectives are to explore current practices 
to fracture risk assessment by LTC physicians and describe barriers to applying 
the recently published Osteoporosis Canada practice guidelines for fracture 
assessment and prevention in LTC.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with the Ontario Long-Term Care 
Physicians Association using an online questionnaire. The survey included 
questions that addressed members' attitudes, knowledge, and behaviour with 
respect to fracture risk assessment in LTC. Closed-ended responses were analyzed 
using descriptive statistics and thematic framework analysis for open-ended 
responses.
RESULTS: We contacted 347 LTC physicians; 25% submitted completed surveys (81% 
men, mean age 60 (Standard Deviation [SD] 11) years, average 32 [SD 11] years in 
practice). Of the surveyed physicians, 87% considered prevention of fragility 
fractures to be important, but a minority (34%) reported using validated 
fracture risk assessment tools, while 33% did not use any. Clinical risk factors 
recommended by the OC guidelines for assessing fracture risk considered 
applicable included; glucocorticoid use (99%), fall history (93%), age (92%), 
and fracture history (91%). Recommended clinical measurements considered 
applicable included: weight (84%), thyroid-stimulating hormone (78%) and 
creatinine (73%) measurements, height (61%), and Get-Up-and-Go test (60%). 
Perceived barriers to assessing fracture risk included difficulty acquiring 
necessary information, lack of access to tests (bone mineral density, x-rays) or 
obtaining medical history; resource constraints, and a sentiment that assessing 
fracture risk is futile in this population because of short life expectancy and 
polypharmacy.
CONCLUSION: Perceived barriers to fracture risk assessment and osteoporosis 
management in LTC have not changed recently, contributing in part to the ongoing 
care gap in osteoporosis management. Our findings highlight the importance to 
adapt guidelines to be applicable to the LTC environment, and to develop 
partnerships with stakeholders to facilitate their use in clinical practice.

therapy versus 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for head-and-neck 
cancer.

PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of intensity modulated radiation 
therapy (IMRT) versus 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in the 
treatment of head-and neck-cancer (HNC).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used a Markov model to simulate radiation 
therapy-induced xerostomia and dysphagia in a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old 
HNC patients. Model input parameters were derived from PARSPORT (CRUK/03/005) 
patient-level trial data and quality-of-life and Medicare cost data from 
published literature. We calculated average incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) from the US health care perspective as cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained and compared our ICERs with current cost-effectiveness 
standards whereby treatment comparators less than $50,000 per QALY gained are 
considered cost-effective.
RESULTS: In the first 2 years after initial treatment, IMRT is not 
cost-effective compared with 3D-CRT, given an average ICER of $101,100 per QALY 
gained. However, over 15 years (remaining lifetime on the basis of average life 
expectancy of a 65-year-old), IMRT is more cost-effective at $34,523 per QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSION: Although HNC patients receiving IMRT will likely experience reduced 
xerostomia and dysphagia symptoms, the small quality-of-life benefit associated 
with IMRT is not cost-effective in the short term but may be cost-effective over 
a patient's lifetime, assuming benefits persist over time and patients are 
healthy and likely to live for a sustained period. Additional data quantifying 
the long-term benefits of IMRT, however, are needed.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the immediate effect on restricted active ankle joint 
dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM), after a single intervention of myofascial 
trigger point (MTrP) therapy on latent triceps surae MTrPs in recreational 
runners.
DESIGN: A crossover randomised controlled trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two recreational runners (11 men and 11 women; mean age 
24.57; ±8.7 years) with a restricted active ankle joint dorsiflexion and 
presence of latent MTrPs.
INTERVENTION: Participants were screened for a restriction in active ankle 
dorsiflexion in either knee flexion (soleus) or knee extension (gastrocnemius) 
and the presence of latent MTrPs. Participants were randomly allocated a week 
apart to both the intervention (combined pressure release and 10 s passive 
stretch) and the control condition.
RESULTS: A clinically meaningful (large effect size) and statistically 
significant increase in ankle ROM in the intervention compared to the control 
group was achieved, for the soleus (p = 0.004) and the gastrocnemius 
(p = 0.026).
CONCLUSION: Apart from the statistical significance (p < 0.05), these results 
are clinically relevant due to the immediate increase in ankle dorsiflexion. 
These results must be viewed in caution due to the carry-over effect in the RCT 
crossover design and the combined MTrP therapy approach.

Some of the more unusual patterns of recurrence in previously treated low grade 
gliomas are demonstrated. As treatment choices develop and life expectancy is 
prolonged, patterns of tumour recurrence are likely to change within such a 
heterogeneous group of tumours, including metastatic spread via cerebrospinal 
fluid pathways.

Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus warfarin anticoagulation for the 
prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism: a U.S. perspective.

Pittsburgh, USA.

INTRODUCTION: Rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that is 
noninferior to warfarin in the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism 
(VTE). Whether rivaroxaban is cost-effective in the prevention of recurrent VTE, 
however, is not known.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: To assess the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared 
with warfarin in the prevention of recurrent VTE, we built a Markov 
state-transition model over a 10-year time horizon. The base case analysis 
consisted of a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old patients with an initial VTE 
who received secondary prophylaxis with either rivaroxaban or warfarin for 3 to 
12months. Cost estimates were derived from the Healthcare and Utilization 
Project and other sources. Probabilities were based on literature values. 
Outcomes included costs in 2011 United States dollars, quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over 
10years from a societal perspective.
RESULTS: Compared with warfarin, the rivaroxaban strategy cost less ($3,195 vs. 
$6,188) and was more effective (9.29 QALYs vs 9.14 QALYs). Our results were 
highly robust in sensitivity analyses. Warfarin was no longer dominated by 
rivaroxaban when the risk of major bleeding with rivaroxaban exceeds 3.8% (base 
case estimate: 0.96%).
CONCLUSION: In summary, prophylactic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban appears to 
be a cost effective, and perhaps cost saving, alternative to warfarin for the 
prevention of recurrent VTE.

OBJECTIVE: With increasing life expectancy, there is a focus on "healthy 
ageing". Most activities in this area focus on the elderly. However, the ageing 
process starts much earlier. Childhood offers an important window to lay a base 
for future healthy ageing. Thus, to address the full ageing process, we should 
include younger populations in ageing research. If we aim for healthy ageing 
across the life course, we need to clarify the meaning of health at different 
ages. The aim of this paper was to develop a conceptual framework for child 
health, which can be used as a starting point for healthy ageing research from a 
life course perspective.
RESULTS: We conceptualize child health as: "a dynamic state, not merely the 
absence of disease or disability, but also adequate resilience that permits 
optimal physical, mental, and social functioning, and optimal quality of life in 
order to achieve full potential and to become an independent, functional, and 
social individual." We propose five core dimensions of child health: Absence of 
physical disease; absence of psychiatric disorders; optimal physical, mental, 
and social functioning, including adequate development; good quality of life or 
well-being; and adequate resilience.
CONCLUSION: This conceptualization of child health and its dimensions can be 
seen as a first step towards building a framework for future studies into 
healthy ageing across the life course.

OBJECTIVE: Retrograde dissection is now recognized as an important complication 
after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), but its treatment is poorly 
understood. Our objectives were to investigate the risks, describe the repair 
methods, and assess the outcomes of this complication.
METHODS: From 2000 to 2012, 766 patients underwent TEVAR. Of these patients, 14 
(1.8%), plus 1 who had undergone TEVAR elsewhere (n = 15), developed retrograde 
dissection after stent grafting. They had undergone TEVAR for distal aortic 
dissection in 7, intramural hematoma in 5, aneurysm in 2, and transection in 1. 
Their mean age was 65 ± 9 years. At the initial TEVAR, the left subclavian 
artery was covered in 9, the mean stent graft diameter was 34 ± 2 mm, and >1 
device was used in 8 patients. The site of entry tear was at the greater 
curvature in 11 and lesser curvature in 4. One patient ruptured and died 12 days 
after TEVAR and never made it to the operating room. The other 14 underwent 
proximal aortic repair. The median interval between TEVAR and repair of 
retrograde dissection was 6 months; 3 patients presented within 1 month. The 
repair techniques included reverse frozen elephant trunk in 5, total arch repair 
in 4, ascending or hemiarch repair in 4, and ascending TEVAR in 1. Concomitant 
procedures included aortic valve repair in 4, replacement in 2, root remodeling 
in 1, and coronary bypass in 1.
RESULTS: No operative mortality occurred. One patient underwent reoperation for 
bleeding. Two required a tracheostomy for respiratory failure. However, no renal 
failure, stroke, or spinal injury occurred. At a median follow-up of 26 months, 
4 aortic reoperations had occurred: 1 distal stent graft extension for type 1b 
endoleak, 2 hybrid thoracoabdominal completion repairs for growth of residual 
distal disease, and 1 emergency TEVAR for aortobronchial fistula. The latter 
patient died of septic complications, and 3 other late noncardiac deaths 
occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde ascending dissection can present as an early or a late 
complication after descending stent grafting because of aortic instability or 
disease progression and has usually been associated with descending dissection 
or intramural hematoma. It is a life-threatening complication that can be 
managed safely with early recognition and rapid delivery of open or hybrid 
repair.

BACKGROUND: The optimal management of morbidly obese patients awaiting renal 
transplant is controversial and unknown. The objective of this study was to 
compare the impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) versus diet and exercise 
on the survival of morbidly obese patients with end-stage renal disease awaiting 
renal transplant.
METHODS: A decision analytic Markov state transition model was designed to 
simulate the life of morbidly obese patients with end-stage renal disease 
awaiting transplant. Life expectancy after RYGB and after 1 and 2 years of diet 
and exercise was estimated and compared in the framework of 2 clinical scenarios 
in which patients above a body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m(2) or above a BMI of 
40 kg/m(2) were ineligible for transplantation, reflecting the BMI restrictions 
of many transplant centers. In addition to base case analysis (45 kg/m(2) BMI 
preintervention), sensitivity analysis of initial BMI was completed. Markov 
model parameters were extracted from the literature.
RESULTS: RYGB improved survival compared with diet and exercise. Patients who 
underwent RYGB received transplants sooner and in higher frequency. Using 40 
kg/m(2) as the upper limit for transplant eligibility, base case patients who 
underwent RYGB gained 5.4 years of life, whereas patients who underwent 1 and 2 
years of diet and exercise gained 1.5 and 2.8 years of life, respectively. Using 
35 kg/m(2) as the upper limit, RYGB base case patients gained 5.3 years of life, 
whereas patients who underwent 1 and 2 years of diet and exercise gained .7 and 
1.5 years of life, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In morbidly obese patients with end-stage renal disease, RYGB may 
be more effective than optimistic weight loss outcomes after diet and exercise, 
thereby improving access to renal transplantation.

BACKGROUND: Opioids are a potential new treatment for severe restless legs 
syndrome. We investigated the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of 
prolonged release oxycodone-naloxone for patients with severe restless legs 
syndrome inadequately controlled by previous, mainly dopaminergic, treatment.
METHODS: This multicentre study consisted of a 12-week randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial and 40-week open-label extension phase done at 55 sites 
in Austria, Germany, Spain, and Sweden. Patients had symptoms for at least 6 
months and an International RLS Study Group severity rating scale sum score of 
at least 15; patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a 
history of sleep apnoea syndrome were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned 
(1:1) to either study drug or matched placebo with a validated interactive 
response technology system in block sizes of four. Study drug was oxycodone 5·0 
mg, naloxone 2·5 mg, twice per day, which was up-titrated according to 
investigator's opinion to a maximum of oxycodone 40 mg, naloxone 20 mg, twice 
per day; in the extension, all patients started on oxycodone 5·0 mg, naloxone 
2·5 mg, twice per day, which was up-titrated to a maximum of oxycodone 40 mg, 
naloxone 20 mg, twice per day. The primary outcome was mean change in severity 
of symptoms according to the International RLS Study Group severity rating scale 
sum score at 12 weeks. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number 
NCT01112644) and with EudraCT (number 2009-011107-23).
FINDINGS: We screened 495 patients, of whom 306 were randomly assigned and 276 
included in the primary analysis (132 to prolonged release oxycodone-naloxone vs 
144 to placebo). 197 patients participated in the open-label extension. Mean 
International RLS Study Group rating scale sum score at randomisation was 31·6 
(SD 4·5); mean change after 12 weeks was -16·5 (SD 11·3) in the prolonged 
release oxycodone-naloxone group and -9·4 (SD 10·9) in the placebo group (mean 
difference between groups at 12 weeks 8·15, 95% CI 5·46-10·85; p<0·0001). After 
the extension phase, mean sum score was 9·7 (SD 7·8). Treatment-related adverse 
events occurred in 109 of 150 (73%) patients in the prolonged release 
oxycodone-naloxone group and 66 of 154 (43%) in the placebo group during the 
double-blind phase; during the extension phase, 112 of 197 (57%) had 
treatment-related adverse events. Five of 306 (2%) patients had serious 
treatment-related adverse events when taking prolonged release 
oxycodone-naloxone (vomiting with concurrent duodenal ulcer, constipation, 
subileus, ileus, acute flank pain).
INTERPRETATION: Prolonged release oxycodone-naloxone was efficacious for 
short-term treatment of patients with severe restless legs syndrome inadequately 
controlled with previous treatment and the safety profile was as expected. Our 
study also provides evidence of open-label long-term efficacy of this treatment. 
Opioids can be used to treat patients with severe restless legs syndrome who 
have had no benefit with first-line drugs.

Caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs) have been developed to mimic the effects of 
caloric restriction (CR). However, research reports for the effects of CRMs are 
often times inconsistent across different research groups. Therefore, in this 
study, we compared seven identified CRMs which extend the lifespans of various 
organisms including caffeine, curcumin, dapsone, metformin, rapamycin, 
resveratrol, and spermidine to CR for mitochondrial function in a single model, 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this organism, rapamycin extended chronological 
lifespan (CLS), but other CRMs failed to extend CLS. Rapamycin enhanced 
mitochondrial function like CR did, but other CRMs did not. Both CR and 
rapamycin worked on mitochondrial function, but they worked at different windows 
of time during the chronological aging process.

BACKGROUND: falls in hospitals are a major problem and contribute to substantial 
healthcare burden. Advances in sensor technology afford innovative approaches to 
reducing falls in acute hospital care. However, whether these are clinically 
effective and cost effective in the UK setting has not been evaluated.
METHODS: pragmatic, parallel-arm, individual randomised controlled trial of bed 
and bedside chair pressure sensors using radio-pagers (intervention group) 
compared with standard care (control group) in elderly patients admitted to 
acute, general medical wards, in a large UK teaching hospital. Primary outcome 
measure number of in-patient bedside falls per 1,000 bed days.
RESULTS: 1,839 participants were randomised (918 to the intervention group and 
921 to the control group). There were 85 bedside falls (65 fallers) in the 
intervention group, falls rate 8.71 per 1,000 bed days compared with 83 bedside 
falls (64 fallers) in the control group, falls rate 9.84 per 1,000 bed days 
(adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-1.22; P 
= 0.51). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect 
to time to first bedside fall (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 0.95; 95% CI: 
0.67-1.34; P= 0.12). The mean cost per patient in the intervention group was 
£7199 compared with £6400 in the control group, mean difference in QALYs per 
patient, 0.0001 (95% CI: -0.0006-0.0004, P= 0.67).
CONCLUSIONS: bed and bedside chair pressure sensors as a single intervention 
strategy do not reduce in-patient bedside falls, time to first bedside fall and 
are not cost-effective in elderly patients in acute, general medical wards in 
the UK.

INTRODUCTION: Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the world. 
The prevalence of smoking is higher in people infected with HIV than in the 
general population. Although it is biologically plausible that smoking increases 
the morbidity and mortality of people living with HIV/AIDS, few studies in 
developing countries have analyzed the determinants and consequences of smoking 
in HIV infected people.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of smoking and identify the socioeconomic 
factors associated with smoking and smoking cessation in patients with HIV by 
sex.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with baseline data, obtained from 
an ongoing prospective cohort study of patients with HIV attending two referral 
centers in Recife, Northeast Region of Brazil, between July 2007 and October 
2009.
RESULTS: The prevalence of current smoking was 28.9%. For both sexes, smoking 
was independently associated with heavy alcohol drinking and marijuana use. 
Among women, smoking was associated with living alone, not being married and 
illiteracy; and among men, being 40 years or older, low income and using crack. 
Compared with ex-smokers, current smokers were younger and more likely to be 
unmarried, heavy drinkers and marijuana users.
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to incorporate smoking cessation interventions for 
the treatment of heavy alcohol drinkers and marijuana users with HIV/AIDS, which 
may increase life expectancy and quality of life, as smoking is related to risk 
of death, relapse of tuberculosis, and non communicable diseases.

The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has reduced 
mortality and improved life expectancy of HIV-positive patients. However, 
increased survival is associated with increased prevalence of comorbidities, 
such as cardiovascular disease, hepatic and renal disease. Kidney disease, 
including HIV-associated nephropathy, acute renal failure and chronic kidney 
disease, represents one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality, 
especially if associated to other risk factors, i.e. hypertension, diabetes, 
older age, black race and hepatitis C coinfection. Careful evaluation of renal 
function may help identifying kidney disease in its early stages. In addition, 
proper management of hypertension and diabetes is recommended. Even if HAART has 
changed the natural course of HIV-associated nephropathy, reducing the risk of 
End-stage Renal Disease (ERDS), some antiretroviral regimens have been related 
with the development of acute or chronic kidney disease. Further studies are 
needed to optimize the management of renal disease among HIV-infected patients.

Life expectancy for people diagnosed with HIV has improved dramatically however 
the number of new infections in the UK remains high. Understanding patterns of 
sexual behaviour among people living with diagnosed HIV, and the factors 
associated with having condom-less sex, is important for informing HIV 
prevention strategies and clinical care. In addition, in view of the current 
interest in a policy of early antiretroviral treatment (ART) for all people 
diagnosed with HIV in the UK, it is of particular importance to assess whether 
ART use is associated with increased levels of condom-less sex. In this context 
the ASTRA study was designed to investigate current sexual activity, and 
attitudes to HIV transmission risk, in a large unselected sample of HIV-infected 
patients under care in the UK. The study also gathered background information on 
demographic, socio-economic, lifestyle and disease-related characteristics, and 
physical and psychological symptoms, in order to identify other key factors 
impacting on HIV patients and the behaviours which underpin transmission. In 
this paper we describe the study rationale, design, methods, response rate and 
the demographic characteristics of the participants. People diagnosed with HIV 
infection attending 8 UK HIV out-patient clinics in 2011-2012 were invited to 
participate in the study. Those who agreed to participate completed a 
confidential, self-administered pen-and-paper questionnaire, and their latest 
CD4 count and viral load test results were recorded. During the study period, 
5112 eligible patients were invited to take part in the study and 3258 completed 
questionnaires were obtained, representing a response rate of 64% of eligible 
patients. The study includes 2248 men who have sex with men (MSM), 373 
heterosexual men and 637 women. Future results from ASTRA will be a key resource 
for understanding HIV transmission within the UK, targeting prevention efforts, 
and informing clinical care of individuals living with HIV.

Infant mortality in Kyrgyzstan before and after the break-up of the Soviet 
Union.

There is a great deal of uncertainty over the levels of, and trends in, infant 
mortality in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia. As a result, the 
impact of the break-up of the Soviet Union on infant mortality in the region is 
not known, and proper monitoring of mortality levels is impaired. In this paper, 
a variety of data sources and methods are used to assess levels of infant 
mortality and their trend over time in one Central Asian republic, Kyrgyzstan, 
between 1980 and 2010. An abrupt halt to an already established decline in 
infant mortality was observed to occur during the decade following the break-up 
of the Soviet Union, contradicting the official statistics based on vital 
registration. Infants of Central Asian ethnicity and those born in rural areas 
were also considerably more at risk of mortality than suggested by the official 
sources. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for health policy 
in this seldom studied part of the former Soviet Union and for our understanding 
of the health crisis which it currently faces.

Over the past decade, India has experienced rapid economic growth along with 
increases in levels of air pollution. Our goal is to examine how alternative 
policies for air pollution abatement affect well-being there. In particular, we 
estimate the effects of policies to reduce the levels of ambient fine 
particulates (PM2.5), which are especially harmful to human health, on 
well-being, quantified using the United Nations' human development index (HDI). 
Two of the three dimensions of this index are based on gross domestic product 
(GDP) per capita and life expectancy. Our approach allows reductions in PM2.5 to 
affect both of them. In particular, economic growth is affected negatively 
through the costs of the additional pollution control measures and positively 
through the increased productivity of the population. We consider three 
scenarios of PM2.5 abatement, corresponding to no further control, current 
Indian legislation, and current European legislation. The overall effect in both 
control scenarios is that growth in GDP is virtually unaffected relative to the 
case of no further controls, life expectancy is higher, and well-being, as 
measured by the HDI, is improved. In India, air pollution abatement investments 
clearly improve well-being.

Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) or transthyretin (TTR) amyloid 
polyneuropathy is a progressive sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy of adult 
onset, which is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In addition to 
neurologic symptoms, FAP may be associated with weight loss, cardiac and renal 
failure and ocular complications. FAP is a devastating disease, causing death 
within 10years after the first symptoms. The TTR Val30Met mutation is the most 
common of more than 100 amyloidogenic mutations identified worldwide. Liver 
transplantation (LT) is currently the only treatment for preventing synthesis of 
the amyloidogenic variants of TTR. LT can halt progression of the neuropathy in 
up to 70% of cases and doubles the overall median survival of young Val30Met 
patients. Oral administration of tafamidis, which prevents deposition of mutated 
TTR, is now available to delay neurologic complications in early stages of the 
disease. Ocular manifestations of FAP are frequent and mainly include 
keratoconjunctivitis sicca, secondary glaucoma, vitreous deposits and pupillary 
abnormalities. Retinal and choroidal vascular abnormalities are more rare. Since 
ocular TTR is synthesized, at least in part, in the retinal pigment epithelium, 
LT does not influence the course of ocular involvement. The effects of tafamidis 
on the latter are still unknown. Because LT and symptomatic treatments greatly 
improve life expectancy of patients with FAP, ocular involvement is becoming a 
more frequent challenge to address. This review summarizes the pathophysiology, 
clinical findings and possible treatments of ocular manifestations of FAP.

Cerebrospinal fluid-targeted delivery of neutralizing anti-IFNγ antibody delays 
motor decline in an ALS mouse model.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the selective and gradual loss of motoneurons in the brain and 
spinal cord. A persistent inflammation, typified by the activation of astrocytes 
and microglia, accompanies the progressive degeneration of motoneurons. 
Interferon gamma (IFNγ), a potent proinflammatory cytokine that is aberrantly 
present in the spinal cord of ALS mice and patients, has been proposed to 
contribute to motoneuron death by eliciting the activation of the lymphotoxin-β 
receptor (LT-βR) through its ligand LIGHT. However, the implication of IFNγ in 
the pathogenic process remains elusive. Here, we show that an antagonistic 
anti-IFNγ antibody efficiently rescues motoneurons from IFNγ-induced death. When 
transiently delivered in the cerebrospinal fluid through a subcutaneously 
implanted osmotic minipump, the neutralizing anti-IFNγ antibody significantly 
retarded motor function decline in a mouse model of ALS. However, this transient 
infusion of anti-IFNγ antibody did not increase the life expectancy of ALS mice. 
Our results suggest that IFNγ contributes to ALS pathogenesis and represents a 
potential therapeutic target for ALS.

Province, China.

The objective of this paper was to study the in vitro and in vivo inhibitory 
effect of Bidens bipinnata L. extract on growth of cervical carcinoma U14 cells. 
MTT method was used to determine the inhibitory effect of Bidens bipinnata L. 
extract on U14 tumour cells, and the effects of Bidens bipinnata L. extract on 
inhibition rate of solid tumour and life prolongation rate of ascites tumour 
were observed through the establishment of two animal models of mouse cervical 
carcinoma U14 solid tumour and ascites tumour. In the in vitro MTT assay, the 
inhibition rate gradually increased with the increase of dose of Bidens 
bipinnata L. and the extension of time. Its inhibition rate was 70.44% at a 
concentration of 80µg/L. Solid tumour inhibition rates in the high- and low-dose 
groups and cisplatin group were 49.13%, 2.26% and 75.72% respectively; life 
prolongation rates in each ascites tumour group were 63.63%, 34.86% and 87.34% 
respectively. The Bidens bipinnata L. extract has a certain inhibitory effect on 
growth of mouse cervical carcinoma U14.

Institute for Futures Studies in Health, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, 
Kerman, Iran.

OBJECTIVE: Iran as a developing country is in the transition phase, which might 
have a big impact on the Burden of Disease and Injury (BOD). This study aims to 
estimate Burden of Disease and Injury (BOD) in Iran up to 2025 due to four broad 
cause groups using Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY).
METHODS: The impacts of demographic and epidemiological changes on BOD (DemBOD 
and EpiBOD) were assessed separately. We estimated DemBOD in nine scenarios, 
using different projections for life expectancy and total fertility rate. EpiBOD 
was modeled in two scenarios as a proportion of DemBOD, based on the extracted 
parameters from an international study.
FINDINGS: The BOD is projected to increase from 14.3 million in 2003 to 19.4 
million in 2025 (95% uncertainty interval: 16.8, 21.9), which shows an overall 
increase of 35.3%. Non-communicable diseases (12.7 million DALY, 66.0%), 
injuries (4.6 million DALY, 24.0%), and communicable diseases, except HIV/AIDS 
(1.8 million DALY, 9%) will be the leading causes of losing healthy life. Under 
the most likely scenario, the maximum increase in disease burden due to DemBOD 
is projected to be observed in HIV/AIDS and Non-communicable diseases (63.9 and 
62.4%, respectively) and due to EpiBOD in HIV/AIDS (319.5%).
CONCLUSION: It seems that in the following decades, BOD will have a sharp 
increase in Iran, mainly due to DemBOD. It seems that communicable diseases 
(except HIV/AIDS) will have less contribution, and especially non-communicable 
diseases will play a more significant role.

Evaluation of the cost-utility of insulin degludec vs insulin glargine in 
Sweden.

Ericsson Å(1), Pollock RF, Hunt B, Valentine WJ.

Author information:
(1)Novo Nordisk Scandinavia AB , Malmö , Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the annual cost-utility of insulin degludec compared with 
glargine in patients with: type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes receiving 
basal-only therapy (T2D-BOT), and type 2 diabetes receiving basal-bolus therapy 
(T2B-BB) in Sweden.
METHODS: A cost-utility model was programmed in Microsoft Excel to evaluate 
clinical and economic outcomes. The clinical trials were designed as 
treat-to-target, with insulin doses adjusted in order to achieve similar 
glycemic control between treatments, thus long-term modeling is not meaningful. 
Basal and bolus insulin doses, incidence of hypoglycemic events, frequency of 
self-monitoring of blood glucose, and possibility for flexibility in timing of 
dose administration were specified for each insulin in three diabetes 
populations, based on data collected in Swedish patients with diabetes and a 
meta-analysis of clinical trials with degludec. Using these characteristics, the 
model estimated costs from a societal perspective and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) in the two scenarios.
RESULTS: Use of degludec was associated with a QALY gain compared with glargine 
in T1D (0.31 vs 0.26 QALYs), T2D-BOT (0.76 vs 0.69 QALYs), and T2D-BB (0.56 vs 
0.47 QALYs), driven by reduced incidence of hypoglycemia and possibility for 
flexibility around timing of dose administration. Therapy regimens containing 
degludec were associated with increased costs compared to glargine-based 
regimens, driven by the increased pharmacy cost of basal insulin, but partially 
offset by other cost savings. Based on estimates of cost and clinical outcomes, 
degludec was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of SEK 19,766 
per QALY gained, SEK 10,082 per QALY gained, and SEK 36,074 per QALY gained in 
T1D, T2-BOT, and T2-BB, respectively.
LIMITATIONS: The hypoglycemic event rates in the base case analysis were derived 
from a questionnaire-based study that relied on patient interpretation and 
recall of hypoglycemic symptoms. The relative rates of hypoglycemia with 
degludec compared to glargine were derived from a meta-analysis of phase III 
trials, which may not reflect the relative rates observed in real-world clinical 
practice. Both of these key limitations were explored in one-way sensitivity 
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on reduced incidence of hypoglycemia and possibility for 
flexibility around timing of dose administration, use of degludec is likely to 
be cost-effective compared to glargine from a societal perspective in T1D, 
T2-BOT, and T2-BB in Sweden over a 1-year time horizon.

this supplement issue.

OBJECTIVES: We modeled rates of family and single-adult homelessness in the 
United States in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan regions and as a function of 
community-level demographic, behavioral, health, economic, and safety net 
characteristics.
METHODS: We entered community-level characteristics and US Department of Housing 
and Urban Development point-in-time counts for a single night in January 2009 
into separate mixed-effects statistical analyses that modeled homelessness rates 
for 4 subpopulations: families and single adults in metropolitan and 
nonmetropolitan regions.
RESULTS: Community-level factors accounted for 25% to 50% of the variance in 
homelessness rates across models. In metropolitan regions, alcohol consumption, 
social support, and several economic indicators were uniquely associated with 
family homelessness, and drug use and homicide were uniquely associated with 
single-adult homelessness. In nonmetropolitan regions, life expectancy, 
religious adherence, unemployment, and rent burden were uniquely associated with 
family homelessness, and health care access, crime, several economic indicators, 
and receipt of Supplemental Security Income were uniquely associated with 
single-adult homelessness.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering homeless families and single adults separately enabled 
more precise modeling of associations between homelessness rates and 
community-level characteristics, indicating targets for interventions to reduce 
homelessness among these subpopulations.

Tobacco smoking (i.e. cigarettes, rolled tobacco, pipes, etc.) is associated 
with significant health risks, reduced life expectancy and negative personal and
