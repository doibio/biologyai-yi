(mini-laparotomy) specimen extraction (RPLS-CSE). Patients were matched by 
propensity scores 1:1 for tumor diameter, AJCC stage, American Society of 
Anesthesiologists score and tumor location.
RESULTS: Of 119 eligible patients, 104 were matched (52 RPLS-NOSE; 52 RPLS-CSE) 
by propensity scores. Compared with RPLS-CSE, RPLS-NOSE was associated with 
longer operative time (223.9 vs. 188.7 min; p = 0.003), decreased use of 
analgesics (morphine dose 33.9 vs. 43.4 mg; p = 0.011) and duration of hospital 
stay (4.2 vs. 5.1 days; p = 0.001). No statistically significant difference was 
found in morbidity or wound-related complication rates between the two groups. 
After a median follow-up of 34.3 months, no local recurrence was observed in 
RPLS-NOSE. The 3-year disease-free survival did not differ statistically 
significantly between groups (90.9 vs. 90.5%; p = 0.610).
CONCLUSION: NOSE enhances the advantages of RPLS by avoiding the need for 
abdominal wall specimen extraction in patients with tumor diameter ≤ 5 cm. 
Surgical and oncologic safety are comparable to RPLS with CSE.

BACKGROUND: Men have a greater risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) than women, but 
population screening currently starts at the same age for both sexes.
AIM: This analysis investigates whether, in a resource-constrained setting, it 
would be more effective and cost-effective for men and women to start screening 
for CRC at different ages.
METHODS AND RESULTS: An economic modeling analysis was carried out using the 
Microsimulation Model in Cancer of the Bowel to compare sex-stratification 
against screening everyone from the same age, taking an English National Health 
Service perspective. Screening men from age 56 and women from age 60, rather 
than screening everyone from age 58 using a Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) 
threshold of 120 μg/g is expected to produce an additional 0.0004 QALYs for a 
cost of £0.55 per person at model start (Incremental Cost-effectiveness 
Ratio = £1392), and to reduce CRC cases and mortality by 25 and 19 per 100 000 
people respectively, while using a similar amount of screening resources. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates a 61% probability that 
sex-stratification is more cost-effective than screening everyone at age 58. 
Similar benefits of sex-stratification are found at other FIT thresholds, but 
become negligible if mean screening start age is reduced to 50.
CONCLUSION: Where resources are constrained and it is not feasible to screen 
everyone from the age of 50, starting screening earlier in men than women is 
likely to be more cost-effective and gain more health benefits overall than 
strategies where men and women start screening at the same age.

Men are usually considered to be the stronger sex. However, when it comes to 
health, they are evidently weaker than their female counterparts. In almost all 
countries around the world, men consistently live shorter lives than women. The 
gender gap in longevity has once again been evident during the ongoing 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which kills men 
disproportionately. Drawing on the relevant scientific literature and updated 
information, this article aimed to provide useful insights into the biological 
and social mechanisms that potentially underlie the gender gap in life 
expectancy.

Aloe vera (ALV) with its unique nutritional profile is being used for food, 
health, and nutraceutical industries globally. Due to its organic nature, ALV 
gel coating has created lot of interest for exploring its potential in extending 
the shelf and storage life of fresh produce. ALV gel coating plays imperative 
role in delaying fruit ripening by lowering ethylene biosynthesis, respiration 
rate, and internal metabolic activities associated with fruit softening, color 
development, enzymatic browning, and decay. ALV gel coating reduces the 
microbial spoilage due to its antifungal properties and maintains visual 
appearance, firmness, sugar: acid ratio, total antioxidants, and phenolic 
contents with conserved eating quality. ALV coated fruits and vegetables showed 
reduced weight loss, superoxide ion ( O2-∙ ), hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), ion 
leakage, and soluble solids content and exhibited higher acidity, anthocyanins, 
ascorbic acid, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ascorbate 
peroxidase (APX) activities. It also delayed the enzymatic browning by inducing 
peroxidase (POD) activity during storage. Recent local studies also revealed 
that ALV gel coating markedly conserved higher consuming quality and extended 
storage period (>1.34-fold) of different fruits and vegetables. Overall, Aloe 
vera gel coating alone or in combination with other organic compounds has shown 
great potential as a food-safe and eco-friendly coating for maintaining the 
quality of fruits and vegetables over extended period and reducing postharvest 
losses in the supply chain. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: ALV gel is a plant-based 
natural coating of eco-friendly nature. The present review summarizes the 
updated information of ALV gel coating application, methods of extraction, 
combinations with other postharvest coatings, and its impact on quality of 
various fruits and vegetables. It also provides future insights for the 
development of commercially applicable ALV gel coating protocols through 
simulation studies. So, being a natural coating, ALV gel has tremendous 
potential to be used in fruit and vegetable industries around the globe.

Effect of Direct Endovascular Revascularization Based on the Angiosome Model on 
Risk of Major Amputations and Life Expectancy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients with 
Critical Limb Ischemia and Foot Ulceration.

Iacopi E, Coppelli A, Goretti C, Bargellini I, Cicorelli A, Cioni R, Piaggesi A.

BACKGROUND: We evaluated whether direct or indirect endovascular 
revascularization based on the angiosome model affects outcomes in type 2 
diabetes and critical limb ischemia.
METHODS: From 2010 to 2015, 603 patients with type 2 diabetes were admitted for 
critical limb ischemia and submitted to endovascular revascularization. Among 
these patients, 314 (52%) underwent direct and 123 (20%) indirect 
revascularization, depending on whether the flow to the artery directly feeding 
the site of ulceration, according to the angiosome model, was successfully 
acquired; 166 patients (28%) were judged unable to be revascularized. Outcomes 
were healing, major amputation, and mortality rates.
RESULTS: An overall healing rate of 62.5% was observed: patients who did not 
receive percutaneous transluminal angioplasty presented a healing rate of 58.4% 
(P < .02 versus revascularized patients). A higher healing rate was observed in 
the direct versus the indirect group (82.4% versus 50.4%; P < .001). The major 
amputation rate was significantly higher in the indirect versus the direct group 
(9.2% versus 3.2%; P < .05). The overall mortality rate was 21.6%, and it was 
higher in the indirect versus the direct group (24% versus 14%; P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: These data show that direct revascularization of arteries supplying 
the diabetic foot ulcer site by means of the angiosome model is associated with 
a higher healing rate and lower risk of amputation and death compared with the 
indirect procedure. These results support use of the angiosome model in type 2 
diabetes with critical limb ischemia.

Before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, patients 
infected with HIV experienced poor prognosis including high rates of 
opportunistic infections, rapid progression to AIDS, and significant mortality. 
Increased life expectancy after therapeutic improvements has led to an increase 
in other chronic diseases for these patients, including cardiovascular disease 
and, in particular, end-stage heart failure. Historically, HIV infection was 
deemed an absolute contraindication for transplantation. Since the development 
of highly active antiretroviral therapy, however, life expectancy for 
HIV-positive patients has significantly improved. In addition, there is a low 
incidence of opportunistic infections and the current antiretrovirals have an 
improved toxicity profile. Despite this, the current status of cardiac 
transplants in HIV-positive patients remains unclear. With this in mind, we 
conducted a narrative review on cardiac transplantation in patients with HIV.

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating the 
cost-effectiveness (CE) of interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes (T2D) among 
high-risk individuals and whole populations.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Interventions targeting high-risk individuals are 
those that identify people at high risk of developing T2D and then treat them 
with either lifestyle or metformin interventions. Population-based prevention 
strategies are those that focus on the whole population regardless of the level 
of risk, creating public health impact through policy implementation, campaigns, 
and other environmental strategies. We systematically searched seven electronic 
databases for studies published in English between 2008 and 2017. We grouped 
lifestyle interventions targeting high-risk individuals by delivery method and 
personnel type. We used the median incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), 
measured in cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) or cost saved to measure 
the CE of interventions. We used the $50,000/QALY threshold to determine whether 
an intervention was cost-effective or not. ICERs are reported in 2017 U.S. 
dollars.
RESULTS: Our review included 39 studies: 28 on interventions targeting high-risk 
individuals and 11 targeting whole populations. Both lifestyle and metformin 
interventions in high-risk individuals were cost-effective from a health care 
system or a societal perspective, with median ICERs of $12,510/QALY and 
$17,089/QALY, respectively, compared with no intervention. Among lifestyle 
interventions, those that followed a Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) 
curriculum had a median ICER of $6,212/QALY, while those that did not follow a 
DPP curriculum had a median ICER of $13,228/QALY. Compared with lifestyle 
interventions delivered one-on-one or by a health professional, those offered in 
a group setting or provided by a combination of health professionals and lay 
health workers had lower ICERs. Among population-based interventions, taxing 
sugar-sweetened beverages was cost-saving from both the health care system and 
governmental perspectives. Evaluations of other population-based 
interventions-including fruit and vegetable subsidies, community-based education 
programs, and modifications to the built environment-showed inconsistent 
results.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the T2D prevention interventions included in our review 
were found to be either cost-effective or cost-saving. Our findings may help 
decision makers set priorities and allocate resources for T2D prevention in 
real-world settings.

OBJECTIVE: To synthesize updated evidence on the cost-effectiveness (CE) of 
interventions to manage diabetes, its complications, and comorbidities.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of 
studies from high-income countries evaluating the CE of diabetes management 
interventions recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and 
published in English between June 2008 and July 2017. We also incorporated 
studies from a previous CE review from the period 1985-2008. We classified the 
interventions based on their strength of evidence (strong, supportive, or 
uncertain) and levels of CE: cost-saving (more health benefit at a lower cost), 
very cost-effective (≤$25,000 per life year gained [LYG] or quality-adjusted 
life year [QALY]), cost-effective ($25,001-$50,000 per LYG or QALY), marginally 
cost-effective ($50,001-$100,000 per LYG or QALY), or not cost-effective 
(>$100,000 per LYG or QALY). Costs were measured in 2017 U.S. dollars.
RESULTS: Seventy-three new studies met our inclusion criteria. These were 
combined with 49 studies from the previous review to yield 122 studies over the 
period 1985-2017. A large majority of the ADA-recommended interventions remain 
cost-effective. Specifically, we found strong evidence that the following 
ADA-recommended interventions are cost-saving or very cost-effective: In the 
cost-saving category are 1) ACE inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker 
(ARB) therapy for intensive hypertension management compared with standard 
hypertension management, 2) ACEI/ARB therapy to prevent chronic kidney disease 
and/or end-stage renal disease in people with albuminuria compared with no 
ACEI/ARB therapy, 3) comprehensive foot care and patient education to prevent 
and treat foot ulcers among those at moderate/high risk of developing foot 
ulcers, 4) telemedicine for diabetic retinopathy screening compared with office 
screening, and 5) bariatric surgery compared with no surgery for individuals 
with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2). In the very 
cost-effective category are 1) intensive glycemic management (targeting A1C <7%) 
compared with conventional glycemic management (targeting an A1C level of 8-10%) 
for individuals with newly diagnosed T2D, 2) multicomponent interventions 
(involving behavior change/education and pharmacological therapy targeting 
hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, microalbuminuria, 
nephropathy/retinopathy, secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with 
aspirin) compared with usual care, 3) statin therapy compared with no statin 
therapy for individuals with T2D and history of cardiovascular disease, 4) 
diabetes self-management education and support compared with usual care, 5) T2D 
screening every 3 years starting at age 45 years compared with no screening, 6) 
integrated, patient-centered care compared with usual care, 7) smoking cessation 
compared with no smoking cessation, 8) daily aspirin use as primary prevention 
for cardiovascular complications compared with usual care, 9) self-monitoring of 
blood glucose three times per day compared with once per day among those using 
insulin, 10) intensive glycemic management compared with conventional insulin 
therapy for T2D among adults aged ≥50 years, and 11) collaborative care for 
depression compared with usual care.
CONCLUSIONS: Complementing professional treatment recommendations, our 
systematic review provides an updated understanding of the potential value of 
interventions to manage diabetes and its complications and can assist clinicians 
and payers in prioritizing interventions and health care resources.

Dose Optimization of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: A 
New Therapeutic Challenge.

University, Policlinico Umberto 1, 00161 Rome, Italy.

The chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) therapeutic landscape has dramatically 
changed with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) development, which allows a 
near-normal life expectancy. However, long-term TKI exposure has been associated 
with persistent adverse events (AEs) which negatively impact on quality of life 
(QoL) and have the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. In 
clinical practice, TKI dose reduction is usually considered to reduce AEs and 
improve QoL, but dose optimization could have also another aim, i.e., the 
achievement and maintenance of cytogenetic and molecular responses. While 
therapy cessation appeared as a safe option for about half of the patients 
achieving an optimal response, no systematic assessment of long-term TKI dose 
de-escalation has been made. The present review is focused on the most recent 
evidences for TKIs dose modifications in CML clinical studies and in the 
real-life setting. It will consider TKI dose modifications in newly diagnosed 
patients, dose reduction for AEs, or in deep molecular response, either as a 
prelude to treatment-free remission (TFR) or as continuous maintenance therapy 
in those patients not wishing to attempt TFR. In addition, it will focus on 
patients not achieving a molecular response deep enough to go to TFR, and for 
whom dose reduction could be an option to avoid AEs.

Department, Bucharest E-mail: trausan@gmail.com

The main objective of this study is to provide an overview of the evolution of 
the medical system in Wallachia between 1840 and 1860 and the very important 
role of physician Nicolae Gussi (1802-1869), protomedicus of Wallachia between 
1840 and 1859, to transform medicine into a modern public service, accessible to 
the entire population. Particularly, we will refer to the medical reform project 
of 1853, which Gussi implemented during the time he headed the medical-sanitary 
administration. We will insist on the details of the project because it was 
designed to create a network of county hospitals that would improve the health 
of the population and, in the medium and long term, would reduce mortality and 
increase life expectancy. Another dimension of the study aims at the tenure of 
physicians in county hospitals and describes the medical services they provided 
to patients, particularly from the poor population.

BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy in China, no large population-based 
studies have been done on the trend for musculoskeletal disorders in China. We 
have investigated the pattern and trend of five major musculoskeletal disorders 
in China from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 and its association with 
sociodemographic index (SDI).
METHODS: The main outcome measures were incidence, prevalence, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, 
low back pain, neck pain, and gout. Average annual percent change (AAPC) and 
annual percent change (APC) between 1990 and 2017 were analyzed with Joinpoint 
regression.
RESULTS: The age-standardized rate of incidence, prevalence, and DALYs for the 
five major musculoskeletal disorders increased with age. For SDI, the 
age-standardized rate of DALYs was zigzagged increasing for rheumatoid arthritis 
and curvilinear increasing for gout, curvilinear decreasing for low back pain, 
and reaching to the highest point for osteoarthritis and neck pain with an SDI 
value of 0.61. The AAPC in age-standardized rate of DALYs indicated an 
increasing trend for rheumatoid arthritis (0.20, 95% CI 0.07, 0.34), 
osteoarthritis (0.26, 95% CI 0.20, 0.31), neck pain (0.09, 95% CI 0.07, 0.12), 
and gout (0.25, 95% CI 0.23, 0.27), but a decreasing trend for low back pain 
(- 0.96, 95% CI - 0.98, - 0.93). The AAPC of risk factors indicated a decreasing 
trend in smoking (- 0.14, 95% CI - 0.24, - 0.04) for rheumatoid arthritis, 
smoking (- 0.22, 95% CI - 0.24, - 0.19) and occupational ergonomic factors 
(- 1.25, 95% CI - 1.29, - 1.21) for low back pain, and impaired kidney function 
(- 0.95, 95% CI - 1.00, - 0.90) for gout, but an increasing trend in high 
body-mass index for osteoarthritis (3.10, 95% CI 3.03, 3.17), low back pain 
(3.07, 95% CI 2.99, 3.14), and gout (3.12, 95% CI 3.04, 3.20). Comparing the 
burden of five musculoskeletal diseases in China with the 19 countries of G20, 
China ranked first to second in the number of DALYs, and 12th to 16th in 
age-standardized rate of DALYs.
CONCLUSION: There are remarkably complex temporal patterns in disease burden and 
risk factors for five major musculoskeletal disorders across past three decades. 
Population-wide initiatives targeting high body-mass index may mitigate the 
burden of musculoskeletal disorders.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular toxicity is a notorious complication of doxorubicin 
(DXR) therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Although surveillance 
of well-known biological markers for cardiovascular disease (CVD) as NTproBNP 
and Troponins may be helpful, there are no established markers to monitor for 
evolving CVD during treatment. New possibilities have arisen with the emergence 
of newer techniques allowing for analysis of plasma proteins that can be 
associated with cardiovascular disease. Proximity Extension Assay is one of 
them.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to illustrate the incidence of CVD in DLBCL patients 
treated with DXR and to establish whether there are plasma proteins associated 
with pre-existing or emerging CVD.
METHODS: In 95 patients, 182 different proteins from OLINK panels, NTproBNP, 
Troponin I and CRP were assessed prior to, during and after treatment. For 
comparison, samples from controls were analyzed.
RESULTS: In the DLBCL cohort, 33.3% had pre-treatment CVD compared to 5.0% in 
the controls and 23.2% developed new CVD. Of the 32.6% who died during follow 
up, CVD was the cause in 4 patients. Spondin-1 (SPON-1) correlated to 
pre-treatment CVD (1.22 fold change, 95% CI 1.10-1.35, p = 0.00025, q = 0.045). 
Interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1RT1) was associated to emerging CVD (1.24 
fold change, 95% CI 1.10-1.39, p = 0.00044, q = 0.082).
CONCLUSION: We observed a higher prevalence of CVD in DLBCL patients compared to 
controls prior to DXR therapy. Two proteins, SPON-1 and IL-1RT1, were related to 
pre-existing and emerging CVD in DXR treated patients. If confirmed in larger 
cohorts, IL-1RT1 may emerge as a reliable biomarker for unfolding CVD in DLBCL.

BACKGROUND: People diagnosed with a serious mental illness have worse physical 
health and lower life expectancy than the general population. Integration of 
mental and physical health services is seen as one service development that 
could better support this. This protocol describes the evaluation of the 
provision of a Virtual Physical Health Clinic (VPHC) and Consultant Connect (CC) 
services to one UK-based mental health Trust.
METHODS: Prospective, formative, pragmatic evaluation using both quantitative 
and qualitative techniques and driven by implementation science theoretical 
frameworks. The VPHC and CC are described along with the methodology being used 
to rapidly evaluate their implementation, effectiveness and potential economic 
impact in order to inform future roll out. We will assess the implementation 
process through quantitative data on uptake and reach and through self-reported 
data to be collected from interviews and the use of validated implementation 
outcome assessment measures. We will assess implementation strategies using the 
Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) strategies as a framework. 
We will assess the health economic impact of both services using established 
health economic methods including cost comparison scenarios and health service 
utilisation analyses.
DISCUSSION: Supporting the physical health management of people in psychiatric 
inpatient units is important in improving the physical health of this 
population. Integration of mental and physical health can help this to happen 
effectively. This initiative provides one of the first service evaluation 
protocols of its kind to be reported in the UK at the time of the COVID-19 
pandemic.

AIMS: There is evidence that patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders 
present higher mortality in comparison with the general population. The aim of 
this study was to analyse the causes of mortality and sociodemographic factors 
associated with mortality, standardised mortality ratios (SMRs), life expectancy 
and potential years of life lost (YLL) in patients with schizophrenia spectrum 
disorders in Spain.
METHODS: The study included a cohort of patients from the Malaga Schizophrenia 
Case Register (1418 patients; 907 males; average age 42.31 years) who were 
followed up for a minimum of 10 years (median = 13.43). The factors associated 
with mortality were analysed with a survival analysis using Cox's proportional 
hazards regression model.
RESULTS: The main causes of mortality in the cohort were circulatory disease 
(21.45%), cancer (17.09%) and suicide (13.09%). The SMR of the cohort was more 
than threefold that of the population of Malaga (3.19). The life expectancy at 
birth was 67.11 years old, which is more than 13 years shorter than that of the 
population of Malaga. The YLL was 20.74. The variables associated with a higher 
risk of mortality were age [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 1.069, p < 0.001], 
male gender (AHR = 1.751, p < 0.001) and type of area of residence (p = 0.028; 
deprived urban zone v. non-deprived urban area, AHR = 1.460, p = 0.028). In 
addition, receiving welfare benefit status in comparison with employed status 
(AHR = 1.940, p = 0.008) was associated with increased mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: There is excess mortality in patients with schizophrenia spectrum 
disorders and also an association with age, gender, socioeconomic inequalities 
and receiving welfare benefits. Efforts directed towards improved living 
conditions could have a positive effect on reducing mortality.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 
genes and affects multiple organs, including kidney, lung, and brain. In the 
kidney, TSC presents with the enlargement of benign tumors (angiomyolipomata) 
and cysts, which eventually leads to kidney failure. The factors promoting cyst 
formation and tumor growth in TSC are incompletely understood. Here, we report 
that mice with principal cell-specific inactivation of Tsc1 develop numerous 
cortical cysts, which are overwhelmingly composed of hyperproliferating 
A-intercalated (A-IC) cells. RNA sequencing and confirmatory expression studies 
demonstrated robust expression of Forkhead Transcription Factor 1 (Foxi1) and 
its downstream targets, apical H+-ATPase and cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase 2 
(CAII), in cyst epithelia in Tsc1 knockout (KO) mice but not in Pkd1 mutant 
mice. In addition, the electrogenic 2Cl-/H+ exchanger (CLC-5) is significantly 
up-regulated and shows remarkable colocalization with H+-ATPase on the apical 
membrane of cyst epithelia in Tsc1 KO mice. Deletion of Foxi1, which is vital to 
intercalated cells viability and H+-ATPase expression, completely abrogated the 
cyst burden in Tsc1 KO mice, as indicated by MRI images and histological 
analysis in kidneys of Foxi1/Tsc1 double-knockout (dKO) mice. Deletion of CAII, 
which is critical to H+-ATPase activation, caused significant reduction in cyst 
burden and increased life expectancy in CAII/Tsc1 dKO mice vs. Tsc1 KO mice. We 
propose that intercalated cells and their acid/base/electrolyte transport 
machinery (H+-ATPase/CAII/CLC-5) are critical to cystogenesis, and their 
inhibition or inactivation is associated with significant protection against 
cyst generation and/or enlargement in TSC.

Gochujang is a Korean fermented hot pepper paste beneficial to human health by 
providing various nutrients. In this study, its physicochemical characteristics 
were identified, and its microbial communities were analyzed by high-throughput 
sequencing. The interrelationship between physicochemical characteristics and 
microbial composition was investigated to reveal the properties of gochujang 
before and after fermentation. After fermentation, all samples showed decreased 
salt concentration, pH, and reducing sugar content, while the acidity and 
amino-type nitrogen increased. The water content, salt concentration, amino-type 
nitrogen, and reducing sugar differed according to the batches of samples. 
Bacillus, Aerosakkonema, and Enterococcus were identified as the predominant 
bacterial genera. Furthermore, Aerosakkonema was the most abundant genus before 
fermentation; however, it was replaced by Bacillus as it decreased after 
fermentation. For the fungi, Aspergillus dominated before fermentation, whereas 
Zygosaccharomyces and Millerozyma dominated after fermentation. The high level 
of amino-type nitrogen in gochujang was related to the relative abundance of B. 
haynesii/B. licheniformis before fermentation. Additionally, the high abundance 
of Z. rouxii after fermentation was related to the flavor of gochujang. This 
comprehensive analysis of the microbial community associated with the 
physicochemical properties of gochujang could help in understanding the factors 
affecting the quality of the product.

Background: Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) has a significant negative 
impact on women's overall health and relationships with their partners. Primary 
analyses from the RECONNECT clinical trials demonstrated statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful improvements in sexual desire and related 
distress with bremelanotide relative to placebo in premenopausal women with 
HSDD. Exit surveys and patient interviews were conducted to evaluate the impact 
of HSDD and bremelanotide treatment from the patient's perspective. Materials 
and Methods: Upon completion of the double-blind study but before participation 
in the open-label extension, up to 250 participants were recruited to complete 
the quantitative exit survey (17 questions). A subset of up to 90 patients was 
invited to participate in the telephone interview (17 questions). Patients who 
volunteered to participate remained blinded to study drug until the survey and 
interviews were completed. Results: Quantitative exit surveys were completed by 
242 RECONNECT participants; 80 of these women also completed qualitative 
telephone exit interviews. Participants who received bremelanotide described 
increased feelings of sexual desire, physical arousal, and improvements in 
overall quality of their sexual activities in their partner relationship. In 
comparison, women taking placebo reported benefits that did not include the 
physiological responses described by women receiving bremelanotide, such as 
positive experiences of seeking HSDD treatment and improved communication with 
their partner. Conclusions: Exit surveys and patient interviews support the 
primary findings from RECONNECT and provide quantitative and qualitative 
assessments of the impact of HSDD on patients' quality of life and the patients' 
perspectives on the impact of bremelanotide. Clinical trial numbers NCT02333071, 
NCT02338960.

BACKGROUND: The MAO enzyme is presented in the brain and peripheral tissues and 
is a significant enzyme that is responsible for the deamination of biogenic 
amines and thus the regulation of neurotransmitter levels. The reaction of these 
neurotransmitters with the MAO enzyme produces aldehyde and free amine. MAO 
enzyme consists of two isoforms, MAO-A and MAO-B, which are characterized by 
amino acid sequence, three-dimensional structure, substrate preference, and 
inhibitor selectivity. Dopamine, tyramine, and tryptamine are substrates of both 
MAO isoforms and MAO inhibitors such as clorgiline and selegiline, which are 
used as medications in neurodegenerative and neurological diseases. In 
particular, MAO-A inhibitors are used in the treatment of depression, while 
MAO-B inhibitors are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is also 
investigated whether MAO-B inhibitors are effective in the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease. Nowadays, life expectancy has increased, as a result, 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease have 
started to occur more frequently. The elderly population is increasing day by 
day. As a result of these common diseases in elderly people, these people are 
unable to do their jobs and need care. Therefore, these diseases have become a 
significant health problem in society.
METHODS: In this study, review, inclusion, and exclusion criteria were used. 
Peer-reviewed research articles were searched. The quality of the examined 
articles was evaluated with standard tools. The information obtained was 
analyzed conceptually by using qualitative content analysis methodology.
RESULTS: One hundred and five papers were included in the review. The current 
MAO-B inhibitors and their usage areas are discussed together with the 
structures of the drugs; also, their possible effects in Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's treatment are evaluated. In addition, different articles have been 
compiled in which structures such as arylalkylamines, chalcones, benzoquinone, 
benzoxazinone, and chromen are substituted with various functional groups and 
aromatic rings, along with thestructures of 44 different compounds that have 
recently been developed and their inhibitory effects on MAO-B enzyme. As a 
result, the structure required for MAO-B inhibition and SAR studies is 
discussed.
CONCLUSION: Many studies demonstrate that MAO-B activity increases with age in 
brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and platelets in Alzheimer's patients. 
This suggests that MAO-B inhibitor drugs, which may be effective in the 
treatment of Parkinson's disease, may also be effective in the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease. This article was written to explain the multifaceted MAO-B 
inhibitor molecules.

IMPORTANCE: Select research methods in cost-utility analysis (incremental 
cost-effectiveness analysis) might potentially bias against patient value 
(quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) gain and cost-effectiveness associated with 
common ophthalmic interventions in disabled, elderly, and African American 
populations.
OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether using nonpatient vision utilities and/or a 
maximum limit model constraining vision utility gain to the systemic comorbidity 
utility level biases against ophthalmic cost-utility outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation predominantly used 
data from the Center for Value-Based Medicine database to perform 
preference-based comparative effectiveness and cost-utility analyses for 
cataract surgery and intravitreal ranibizumab therapy for neovascular 
age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD) using vision utilities acquired from 
patients with ophthalmic disease (ophthalmic patient utilities) and from 
surrogate individuals (nonophthalmic patient vision utilities) with and without 
integrating systemic comorbidity utility limits on vision utility gain. 
Ophthalmic patient data were collected from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 
2016, and analyzed from April 1 to July 1, 2020.
INTERVENTIONS: Cost-utility analysis with 3% discount rate in 2018 US dollars.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: QALY gains and dollars expended per QALY gain (the 
cost-utility ratio).
RESULTS: A total of 309 participants in the nonophthalmic patient cohort and 505 
patients in the ophthalmic patient cohort were included. A reference case of 
first-eye cataract surgery using ophthalmic patient vision utilities and no 
systemic comorbidity utility limits yielded a 2.574 (34.2%) QALY gain vs 
observation. Substituting nonophthalmic patient utilities resulted in a 1.502 
(15.5%) QALY gain, whereas using the 0.76 patient systemic comorbidity utility 
to limit cataract surgery vision utility gain yielded a 1.337 (17.8%) QALY gain. 
Using both nonophthalmic patient utilities and systemic comorbidity utility 
limits yielded a 0.839 (8.7%) QALY gain. The substitutions decreased cataract 
surgery cost-effectiveness by 71.3% (95% CI, 70.6%-72.1%) for nonophthalmic 
patient utilities, 92.5% (95% CI, 51.9%-133.1%) for patient systemic comorbidity 
utility, and 206.8% (95% CI, 202.6%-211.2%) for both. The NVAMD ranibizumab 
therapy reference case yielded a 1.339 (26.1%) QALY gain. Similar substitutions 
resulted in QALY gains of 1.164 (22.7%) for nonophthalmic patient utilities 
while reducing cost-effectiveness by 16.4%, 1.001 (19.5%) for 
systematic-limiting comorbidity utility while reducing cost-effectiveness by 
33.8%, and 0.971 (18.9%) for both while reducing cost-effectiveness by 37.9%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using nonophthalmic patient vision utilities and/or 
the maximum limit model of limiting patient utility gains to the population 
systemic comorbidity utility level resulted in large decreases in patient value 
(QALY) gain and cost-effectiveness for common ophthalmic interventions. 
Ophthalmologists should realize these phenomena and consider correcting the 
potential discrimination against disabled, elderly, and African American 
populations. This negative potential bias could theoretically result in 
beneficial intervention denial, less research dollars, curbed therapeutic 
advances, and decreased interventional reimbursement.

The self is a crucial component of the psychic life and plays a central role for 
the adaptation to the environment. In daily life, this adaptative function is 
ensured, inter alia, by numerous biases filtering information and favoring those 
which are self-related. After succinctly reviewing the most documented among 
them which are affective and mnesic biases, the current paper provides a 
critical review of literature about a bias which is supposed to be perceptive, 
the self-prioritization effect (SPE). That has been revealed by Sui et al. 
(2012, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 
38(5), 1105) with an astute matching task and consists in the fact that 
arbitrarily tagging shapes to a word referring to the participant (e.g., 
you-square) leads to faster and more accurate responses as compared to shapes 
tagged to a word referring to another identity (e.g., strange-circle). The 
methodological variations of this task and the SPE's both extension and putative 
origins will be presented, as well as the restrictions which border it, related 
to the individuals, to the experimental situation and to some more general 
properties of the self. Finally, some avenues for future research will be 
proposed, drawing some promising paths: beyond being a robust and intriguing
