The rotator cuff (RC) insertions according to most anatomical texts are 
described as being separate from one another. However, clear fusion of the RC 
tendon fibres exists with prior studies showing this interdigitation forming a 
common, continuous insertion onto and around the lesser and greater tubercles 
(LT and GT) of the humerus. Current surgical repair methods (especially 
arthroscopic techniques) rarely mention or consider these connections during 
repair and suture anchor implantation. The general principles of RC surgery 
remain a controversial subject, due to various available techniques, surgeon 
experience and preference, and the contradicting success rates. This results 
from old-fashioned knowledge of the anatomy of the RC complex and its functional 
aspects. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to visualise and define the 
RC footprint and extension insertions with the aim of enhancing and improving 
knowledge of the basic anatomy in the hopes that this will be considered during 
orthopaedic repair. Twenty shoulders (16 cadaveric and 4 fresh) were used in the 
study. The fresh shoulders were received from the National Tissue Bank, and 
ethical clearance was obtained (239/2015). Reverse dissection was performed to 
better visualise the RC unit exposing the interdigitated rotator hood (extension 
insertions), as well as the complete RC unit (tendons + internal capsule) 
separated from the scapula and humerus. Once the insertions were exposed and 
documented, the RC muscle footprint (articular surface area) was measured and 
recorded, using AutoCAD 2016. No statistical significant difference between left 
and right (p = 0.424) was noted, but a significant difference between males and 
females (p = 0.000) was. Collectively, these findings indicate and strengthen 
evidence towards the notion that the RC muscles/tendons and the internal capsule 
are one complete and inseparable unit/complex. The fact that the RC unit is more 
complex in its structure and attachment places importance on the biomechanical 
stresses encountered after repair. Functions of one RC muscle are not 
necessarily isolated but instead can be influenced by surrounding muscles as 
well. In addition to providing greater understanding of the basic anatomy of the 
RC unit, these findings also provide clarity for surgeons with the goal of 
improving and enhancing surgical methods for better post-operative patient 
outcome.

What is the central question of this study? Do tendon and/or muscle-tendon unit 
stiffness influence rate of torque development? What is the main finding and its 
importance? In our experimental conditions, some measures of relative (to 
maximal voluntary torque and tissue length) muscle-tendon unit stiffness had 
small correlations with voluntary/evoked rate of torque development over 
matching torque increments. However, absolute and relative tendon stiffness were 
unrelated to voluntary and evoked rate of torque development. Therefore, the 
muscle aponeurosis but not free tendon influences the relative rate of torque 
development. Factors other than tissue stiffness more strongly determine the 
absolute rate of torque development. The influence of musculotendinous tissue 
stiffness on contractile rate of torque development (RTD) remains opaque. In 
this study, we examined the relationships between both patellar tendon (PT) and 
vastus lateralis muscle-tendon unit (MTU) stiffness and the voluntary and evoked 
knee-extension RTD. Fifty-two healthy untrained men completed duplicate 
laboratory sessions. Absolute and relative RTD were measured at 50 N m or 25% 
maximal voluntary torque (MVT) increments from onset and sequentially during 
explosive voluntary and evoked octet isometric contractions (supramaximal 
stimulation; eight pulses at 300 Hz). Isometric MVT was also assessed. Patellar 
tendon and MTU stiffness were derived from simultaneous force and ultrasound 
recordings of the PT and vastus lateralis aponeurosis during constant RTD ramp 
contractions. Absolute and relative (to MVT and resting tissue length) stiffness 
(k) was measured over identical torque increments as RTD. Pearson's correlations 
tested relationships between stiffness and RTD measurements over matching 
absolute/relative torque increments. Absolute and relative PT k were unrelated 
to equivalent voluntary/evoked (r = 0.020-0.255, P = 0.069-0.891). Absolute MTU 
k was unrelated to voluntary or evoked RTD (r ≤ 0.191, P ≥ 0.184), but some 
measures of relative MTU k were related to relative voluntary/evoked RTD (e.g. 
RTD for 25-50% MVT, r = 0.374/0.353, P = 0.007/0.014). In conclusion, relative 
MTU k explained a small proportion of the variance in relative voluntary and 
evoked RTD (both ≤19%), despite no association of absolute MTU k or 
absolute/relative PT k with equivalent RTD measures. Therefore, the 
muscle-aponeurosis component but not free tendon was associated with relative 
RTD, although it seems that an overriding influence of MVT negated any 
relationship of absolute MTU k and absolute RTD.

In this study, we evaluated the adaptability of the small brown planthopper 
(SBPH), Laodelphax striatellus (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) to four rice cultivars 
including Shengdao13 (SD13), Shengdao14 (SD14), Shengdao15 (SD15), and 
Zixiangnuo (ZXN) using the age-stage, two-sex life table with a simplified 
method for recording egg production (i.e., every five days vs. daily). The 
intrinsic rate of increase (r) of the SBPH was the highest (0.1067 d-1) on 
cultivar SD15, which was similar to the rate on SD14 (0.1029 d-1), but was 
significantly higher than that occurring on ZXN (0.0897 d-1) and SD13 (0.0802 
d-1). The differences of the finite rate of increase (λ) on the four rice 
cultivars were consistent with the r values. Population projection predicted an 
explosive population growth of the SBPH occurring in a relatively short time 
when reared on SD14 and SD15. These findings demonstrated that the SBPH can 
successfully survive on the four rice cultivars, although there were varying 
host adaptabilities.

BACKGROUND: Over 200 million people worldwide live with groin hernia and 20 
million are operated on each year. In resource-scarce settings, the superior 
surgical technique using a synthetic mesh is not affordable. A low-cost 
alternative is needed. The objective of this study was to calculate and compare 
costs and cost-effectiveness of inguinal hernia mesh repair using a low-cost 
versus a commercial mesh in a rural setting in Uganda.
METHODS: This is a cost-effectiveness analysis of a double-blinded RCT comparing 
outcomes from groin hernia mesh repair using a low-cost mesh and a commercially 
available mesh. Cost-effectiveness was expressed in US dollars (with euros in 
parentheses, exchange rate 30 December 2016) per disability-adjusted life-year 
(DALY) averted and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: The cost difference resulting from the choice of mesh was $124·7 
(€118·1). In the low-cost mesh group, the cost per DALY averted and QALY gained 
were $16·8 (€15·9) and $7·6 (€7·2) respectively. The corresponding costs were 
$58·2 (€55·1) and $33·3 (€31·5) in the commercial mesh group. A sensitivity 
analysis was undertaken including cost variations and different health outcome 
scenarios. The maximum costs per DALY averted and QALY gained were $148·4 
(€140·5) and $84·7 (€80·2) respectively.
CONCLUSION: Repair using both meshes was highly cost-effective in the study 
setting. A potential cost reduction of over $120 (nearly €120) per operation 
with use of the low-cost mesh is important if the mesh technique is to be made 
available to the many millions of patients in countries with limited resources.

Reduced somatotrophic signaling through the growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like 
growth factor pathways (IGF1) can delay aging, although the degree of 
life-extension varies markedly across studies. By collating data from previous 
studies and using meta-analysis, we tested whether factors including sex, 
hormonal manipulation, body weight change and control baseline mortality 
quantitatively predict relative life-extension. Manipulations of GH signaling 
(including pituitary and direct GH deficiencies) generate significantly greater 
extension in median life span than IGF1 manipulations (including IGF1 
production, reception, and bioactivity), producing a consistent shift in 
mortality risk of mutant mice. Reduced Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 
expression produces more similar life-extension to reduced GH, although effects 
are more heterogeneous and appear to influence the demography of mortality 
differently. Life-extension with reduced IGF1 signaling, but neither GH nor IRS 
signaling, increases life span significantly more in females than males, and in 
cohorts where control survival is short. Our results thus suggest that reduced 
GH signaling has physiological benefits to survival outside of its actions on 
circulating IGF1. In addition to these biological moderators, we found an 
overrepresentation of small sample sized studies that report large improvements 
in survival, indicating potential publication bias. We discuss how this could 
potentially confound current conclusions from published work, and how this 
warrants further study replication.

Objectives To understand why mortality increased in England and Wales in 2015. 
Design Iterative demographic analysis. Setting England and Wales Participants 
Population of England and Wales. Main outcome measures Causes and ages at death 
contributing to life expectancy changes between 2013 and 2015. Results The 
long-term decline in age-standardised mortality in England and Wales was 
reversed in 2011. Although there was a small fall in mortality rates between 
2013 and 2014, in 2015 we then saw one of the largest increases in deaths in the 
post-war period. Nonetheless, mortality in 2015 was higher than in any year 
since 2008. A small decline in life expectancy at birth between 2013 and 2015 
was not significant but declines in life expectancy at ages over 60 were. The 
largest contributors to the observed changes in life expectancy were in those 
aged over 85 years, with dementias making the greatest contributions in both 
sexes. However, changes in coding practices and diagnosis of dementia demands 
caution in interpreting this finding. Conclusions The long-term decline in 
mortality in England and Wales has reversed, with approximately 30,000 extra 
deaths compared to what would be expected if the average age-specific death 
rates in 2006-2014 had continued. These excess deaths are largely in the older 
population, who are most dependent on health and social care. The major 
contributor, based on reported causes of death, was dementia but caution was 
advised in this interpretation. The role of the health and social care system is 
explored in an accompanying paper.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism after Discharge: Duration of Therapy and Follow-up 
Testing.

Perugia, Perugia, Italy.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a frequent cause of death and serious disability with 
a risk extending far beyond the acute phase of the disease. Anticoagulant 
treatment reduces the risk for death and recurrent VTE after a first PE. The 
optimal duration of anticoagulation after a first episode of PE remains 
controversial and should be made on an individual basis, balancing the estimated 
risk for recurrence without anticoagulant treatment against bleeding risk under 
anticoagulation. Current recommendations on duration of anticoagulation are 
based on a 3% per year risk of major bleeding expected during long-term warfarin 
treatment. Anticoagulant therapy should be discontinued after the initial 3 to 6 
months in those patients who had the first episode in association with temporary 
risk factors. After 3 to 6 months of anticoagulant treatment, patients with a 
first unprovoked event and an estimated low risk for bleeding complications 
should be evaluated for indefinite treatment on an individualized basis. None of 
the clinical prediction models for recurrent VTE are able to actually drive 
duration of anticoagulation. If the favorable safety profile of direct oral 
anticoagulants from clinical trials would be confirmed in real-life, extension 
of anticoagulation could be reconsidered in large proportions of patients after 
an unprovoked PE. The most feared late sequela of PE is chronic thromboembolic 
pulmonary hypertension. Although there has been progress in both the diagnosis 
and management of this disease in recent years, further data are needed to 
provide recommendations regarding long-term follow-up after PE.

The function of the ocelloid and piston in the dinoflagellate Erythropsidinium 
(Gymnodiniales, Dinophyceae).

Gómez F(1).

Author information:
(1)Carmen Campos Panisse 3, E-11500, Puerto de Santa María, Spain.

The marine dinoflagellate Erythropsidinium possesses an ocelloid, the most 
elaborate photoreceptor organelle known in a unicellular organism, and a piston, 
a fast contractile appendage unknown in any other organism. The ocelloid is able 
to rotate, often before the cell swims. The ocelloid contains lenses that 
function to concentrate light. The flagellar propulsion is atrophied, and the 
piston is responsible for locomotion through successive extensions and 
contractions. During the "locomotion mode", the contraction is ~4 times faster 
than the extension. The piston attained up to 50 mm · s-1 and the cell jumps 
backwards at -4 mm · s-1 , while during the piston extension the cell moves 
forwards. The net speed of ~-1 mm · s-1 is faster than other dinoflagellates. 
The piston usually moved in the "static mode" without significant cell swimming. 
This study suggests that the piston is also a tactile organelle that scans the 
surrounding waters for prey. Erythropsidinium feeds on copepod eggs by 
engulfing. The end of the piston possesses a "suction cup" able to attach the 
prey and place it into the posterior cavity for engulfing. The cylindrical shape 
of Erythropsidinium, and the anterior position of the ocelloid and nucleus, are 
morphological adaptations that leave space for the large vacuole. Observations 
are provided on morphological development during cell division. Most of the 
described species of Erythropsidinium apparently correspond to distinct life 
stages of known species, and the genus Greuetodinium (=Leucopsis) corresponds to 
an earlier division stage.

BACKGROUND: Spanish population is rather homogeneous in its genetic and 
sociocultural characteristics, but allergen sensitization shows wide 
geographical variations. We aimed at assessing whether sensitization to 
different allergens in the diverse geographical areas induced different clinical 
and quality-of-life characteristics in adult patients with a first-time 
diagnosis of rhinitis and/or asthma.
METHODS: Two sequential, identically designed studies were carried out to 
evaluate such associations (PERFILAR I and II). PERFILAR II was an extension of 
PERFILAR I with additional allergens being included. Both phases were 
epidemiological, descriptive, cross-sectional, nonintervention multicenter 
studies. Participants were required to have lived for at least the last 2 years 
in the geographical zone. Asthma control assessment was based on ACQ-5. 
Health-related quality of life was evaluated with validated scales for rhinitis 
(ESPRINT-15) and asthma (Mini-AQLQ). Skin prick tests were used to identify 
sensitization to involved allergens.
RESULTS: A total of 301 physicians recruited 2711 patients for PERFILAR I+II. 
Sensitization to allergens was significantly different in patients with rhinitis 
with/without asthma. Seasonal allergens were associated with rhinitis, a longer 
time to asthma development, and more severe and commonly intermittent rhinitis. 
HDM were associated with more common rhinitis, and Alternaria was associated 
with asthma. The study confirms an association of geographical areas with 
relevant allergens and allergic clinical picture.
CONCLUSION: Different types of aeroallergens and specific sensitization profiles 
are associated with different allergic clinical pictures (rhinitis with/without 
asthma), different clinical symptoms, and different levels of severity. This 
could have implications to predict later clinical course and to select 
appropriate management approaches.

PURPOSE: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of first-line treatments of 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) (dimethyl fumarate [DMF] 240 mg PO 
BID, teriflunomide 14 mg once daily, glatiramer acetate 20 mg SC once daily, 
interferon [IFN]-β1a 44 µg TIW, IFN-β1b 250 µg EOD, and IFN-β1a 30 µg IM QW) and 
best supportive care (BSC) in the health care payer setting in Finland.
METHODS: The primary outcome was the modeled incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER; €/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained, 3%/y discounting). 
Markov cohort modeling with a 15-year time horizon was employed. During each 
1-year modeling cycle, patients either maintained the Expanded Disability Status 
Scale (EDSS) score or experienced progression, developed secondary progressive 
MS (SPMS) or showed EDSS progression in SPMS, experienced relapse with/without 
hospitalization, experienced an adverse event (AE), or died. Patients׳ 
characteristics, RRMS progression probabilities, and standardized mortality 
ratios were derived from a registry of patients with MS in Finland. A 
mixed-treatment comparison (MTC) informed the treatment effects. Finnish EuroQol 
Five-Dimensional Questionnaire, Three-Level Version quality-of-life and 
direct-cost estimates associated with EDSS scores, relapses, and AEs were 
applied. Four approaches were used to assess the outcomes: cost-effectiveness 
plane and efficiency frontiers (relative value of efficient treatments); 
cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier, which demonstrated optimal treatment 
to maximize net benefit; Bayesian treatment ranking (BTR); and an impact 
investment assessment (IIA; a cost-benefit assessment), which increased the 
clinical interpretation and appeal of modeled outcomes in terms of absolute 
benefit gained with fixed drug-related budget. Robustness of results was tested 
extensively with sensitivity analyses.
FINDINGS: Based on the modeled results, teriflunomide was less costly, with 
greater QALYs, versus glatiramer acetate and the IFNs. Teriflunomide had the 
lowest ICER (24,081) versus BSC. DMF brought marginally more QALYs (0.089) than 
did teriflunomide, with greater costs over the 15 years. The ICER for DMF versus 
teriflunomide was 75,431. Teriflunomide had >50% cost-effectiveness 
probabilities with a willingness-to-pay threshold of <€77,416/QALY gained. 
According to BTR, teriflunomide was first-best among the disease-modifying 
therapies, with potential willingness-to-pay thresholds of up to €68,000/QALY 
gained. In the IIA, teriflunomide was associated with the longest incremental 
quality-adjusted survival and time without cane use. Generally, primary outcomes 
results were robust, based on the sensitivity analyses. The results were 
sensitive only to large changes in analysis perspective or mixed-treatment 
comparison.
IMPLICATIONS: The results were sensitive only to large changes in analysis 
perspective or MTC. Based on the analyses, teriflunomide was cost-effective 
versus BSC or DMF with the common threshold values, was dominant versus other 
first-line RRMS treatments, and provided the greatest impact on investment. 
Teriflunomide is potentially the most cost-effective option among first-line 
treatments of RRMS in Finland.

There are considerable cross-national differences in public attitudes towards 
antibiotics use, use of prescribed antibiotics, and self-medication with 
antibiotics even within Europe. This study was aimed at investigating the 
relationships between socio-economic factors, cultural values, national 
personality characteristics and the antibiotic use in Europe. Data included 
scores from 27 European countries (14 countries for personality analysis). 
Correlations between socio-economic variables (Gross National Income per capita, 
governance quality, life expectancy, mean years of schooling, number of 
physicians), Hofstede's cultural value dimensions (power distance, 
individualism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, 
indulgence), national personality characteristic (extraversion, neuroticism, 
social desirability) and antibiotic use were calculated and three regression 
models were constructed. Governance quality (r=-.51), mean years of schooling 
(r=-.61), power distance (r=.59), masculinity (r=.53), and neuroticism (r=.73) 
correlated with antibiotic use. The highest amount of variance in antibiotic use 
was accounted by the cultural values (65%) followed by socio-economic factors 
(63%) and personality factors (55%). Results show that socio-economic factors, 
cultural values and national personality characteristics explain cross-national 
differences in antibiotic use in Europe. In particular, governance quality, 
uncertainty avoidance, masculinity and neuroticism were important factors 
explaining antibiotics use. The findings underline the importance of 
socio-economic and cultural context in health care and in planning public health 
interventions.

OBJECTIVES: We used findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 to 
report the burden of musculoskeletal disorders in the Eastern Mediterranean 
Region (EMR).
METHODS: The burden of musculoskeletal disorders was calculated for the EMR's 22 
countries between 1990 and 2013. A systematic analysis was performed on 
mortality and morbidity data to estimate prevalence, death, years of live lost, 
years lived with disability and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
RESULTS: For musculoskeletal disorders, the crude DALYs rate per 100 000 
increased from 1297.1 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 924.3-1703.4) in 1990 to 
1606.0 (95% UI 1141.2-2130.4) in 2013. During 1990-2013, the total DALYs of 
musculoskeletal disorders increased by 105.2% in the EMR compared with a 58.0% 
increase in the rest of the world. The burden of musculoskeletal disorders as a 
proportion of total DALYs increased from 2.4% (95% UI 1.7-3.0) in 1990 to 4.7% 
(95% UI 3.6-5.8) in 2013. The range of point prevalence (per 1000) among the EMR 
countries was 28.2-136.0 for low back pain, 27.3-49.7 for neck pain, 9.7-37.3 
for osteoarthritis (OA), 0.6-2.2 for rheumatoid arthritis and 0.1-0.8 for gout. 
Low back pain and neck pain had the highest burden in EMR countries.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a high burden of musculoskeletal disorders, with a 
faster increase in EMR compared with the rest of the world. The reasons for this 
faster increase need to be explored. Our findings call for incorporating 
prevention and control programmes that should include improving health data, 
addressing risk factors, providing evidence-based care and community programmes 
to increase awareness.

University, Republic of Korea.

[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of restricted 
spinal motion on kinematic changes in the lower extremities using a rigid 
thoracolumbosacral orthosis. [Subjects and Methods] Forty healthy males in their 
20s were selected as the sample, which was randomly and evenly divided into two 
groups: (1) the WT group (with a thoracolumbosacral orthosis) and (2) the WOT 
group (without a thoracolumbosacral orthosis). The spinal orthosis used in this 
study was a thoracolumbosacral orthosis called a plastic body jacket. [Results] 
The sagittal plane; in the level ground walking measurements, significance 
differences were found at the H2 (Hip maximum flexion/extension in midstance 
phase) and K2 (Knee maximum flexion/extension in midstance phase) between the WT 
group and the WOT group. [Conclusion] It can be concluded that a spinal orthosis 
is useful in stabilizing the lower extremities during stair gaiting, and that 
appropriate application of the orthosis plays a supporting role in the 
activities of daily life and therapeutic intervention.

The role of maintenance pemetrexed in the treatment of non-small-cell lung 
cancer.

Rafii S(1), Cullen MH(1).

Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 2TH, United Kingdom.

Until recently, the weight of evidence has supported the discontinuation of 
chemotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after 4-6 cycles of 
induction therapy. This allows patients with limited life expectancy a 
"treatment holiday." A minority of cases then go on to receive second-line 
therapy, although many deteriorate rapidly and never receive further active 
treatment. There has been renewed interest in the concept of maintenance from 
trials with pemetrexed and erlotinib. Both these agents can be given for long 
periods without serious cumulative toxicity in most patients. Both trials have 
shown significant extension of progression free survival in placebo-controlled 
trials. In cases who are not receiving pemetrexed as induction therapy, a 
statistically significant 5-month prolongation of overall survival in 
nonsquamous NSCLC has been reported. Treatment was well tolerated. This effect 
may reflect the early administration of an active second-line agent and it 
remains to be seen whether similar benefits will accrue to patients having 
pemetrexed as induction therapy.

OBJECTIVES: An economic evaluation was conducted in conjunction with a 
prospective, multicenter, randomized trial, to compare pemetrexed with erlotinib 
in pretreated patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in 
Greece.
METHODS: The effectiveness of treatments examined was comparable; thus, cost 
minimization analysis was conducted to evaluate which option is less costly. 
Patient-level resource utilization data were combined with unit cost data, which 
were aggregated to compute the total treatment cost for each patient. The 
analysis was conducted with respect to the individual incurring the cost. Due to 
the limited life-expectancy of the patients, discounting was unnecessary. Since 
data were right censored, the Bang and Tsiatis method was employed to identify 
unbiased estimators of the mean cost per treatment arm, while other methods were 
employed for sensitivity analysis. To analyze uncertainty and to construct 
uncertainty intervals (UI), stochastic analysis was performed based on 5000 
bootstrap replications.
RESULTS: The one-year survival rate was 28.3% in the pemetrexed arm and 31.7% in 
the erlotinib arm, while the corresponding median survival over the follow-up 
period was 7.1 and 6.7 months, respectively (P = 0.765). Total cost in the 
pemetrexed arm was €10508 (95% UI: €9552-€11488), while in the erlotinib arm the 
cost was €9563 (95% UI: €8499-€10711); thus, no statistically significant 
difference was found between the comparators (P = 0.206). Results remained 
constant for all sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no survival or cost difference between erlotinib and 
pemetrexed; thus, these therapies are equivalent. Further studies are needed to 
determine whether other parameters, such as quality of life, differ among 
treatment options.

Proesmans M(1).

Author information:
(1)Dept of Pediatric Pulmonology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, 
Belgium.

KEY POINTS: Children with neurocognitive impairment often present with chronic 
or recurrent respiratory problems.The respiratory problems have an important 
impact on quality of life and life expectancy.The underlying causes are 
multiple: risk of aspiration, insufficient cough, upper airway obstruction and 
progressive kyphoscoliosis.There is often a complex interplay between these 
known risk factors.The diagnostic and therapeutic approach should be 
multidisciplinary.
EDUCATIONAL AIMS: To provide data on the prevalence of respiratory problems in 
children with disability and to increase awareness on this topic.To provide 
insight into the complex interplay of the underlying causes and risk factors for 
chronic lung infection and respiratory failure.To give an overview of the 
diagnostic approaches relevant in this context.To highlight possible therapeutic 
approaches.To touch on ethical considerations in this group of vulnerable and 
complex patients.

Background: Economic burden due to premature mortalities is significant both on 
health system and on the society as a whole. This study aimed to determine the 
productivity costs and years of potential life lost associated with five leading 
causes of death in Iran from 2006 to 2010. Methods: Data on mortality by sex and 
age-groups due to five main leading causes of death (myocardial infarction (MI), 
cerebral vascular diseases (CVD), transport accidents (TA), hypertensive heart 
disease (HHD) and gastric cancer (GC)) were obtained from the Ministry of Health 
and Medical Education from 2006 to 2010 for 29 providences of Iran (data on 
Tehran province was not available). Three measures including years of potential 
life lost (YPLL), years of potential productive life lost (YPPLL) and the cost 
of productivity loss (CPL) due to premature mortality were used. To estimate the 
CPL and YPLL, the human capital approach and life expectancy method were used, 
respectively. Results: There were 518,815 deaths due to the five main leading 
causes of death; of which, 58% occurred in males. The estimated YPPLL resulted 
in 209,552,135 YPPLL from 2006 to 2011; of which, 141,966,592 (67%) were in 
males and 67,585,543 (33%) in females. The total cost of productivity loss 
caused by premature deaths due to the five leading causes of death was 7.86 
billion dollars (US$) from 2006 to 2010, ranging from 1.63 billion dollars in 
2006 to 1.31 billion dollars in 2010. Conclusion: This study revealed that the 
economic burden of premature mortalities due to the five main causes of death is 
substantial, and that these five leading causes should be considered in 
policy/decision making and prevention programms. The allocation of financial 
resources to control these causes may decrease their economic burden, resulting 
in higher level of health and well-being.

We constructed a Markov microsimulation model among hypothetical cohorts of 
community-dwelling elderly osteoporotic Japanese women without prior hip or 
vertebral fractures over a lifetime horizon. Compared with weekly oral 
alendronate for 5 years, denosumab every 6 months for 5 years is cost-saving or 
cost-effective at a conventionally accepted threshold.
INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to examine the cost-effectiveness 
of subcutaneous denosumab every 6 months for 5 years compared with weekly oral 
alendronate for 5 years in Japan.
METHODS: We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs] (2016 US 
dollars [$] per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]), using a Markov 
microsimulation model among hypothetical cohorts of community-dwelling 
osteoporotic Japanese women without prior hip or vertebral fractures at various 
ages of therapy initiation (65, 70, 75, and 80 years) over a lifetime horizon 
from three perspectives: societal, healthcare sector, and government.
RESULTS: Denosumab was cost-saving compared with alendronate at ages 75 and 
80 years from any of the three perspectives. The ICERs of denosumab compared 
with alendronate were $25,700 and $5000 per QALY at ages 65 and 70 years from a 
societal perspective and did not exceed a willingness-to-pay of $50,000 per QALY 
from the other two perspectives. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, results 
were sensitive to changes in the effectiveness of denosumab for reducing hip 
fracture and clinical vertebral fracture and the rate ratio of non-persistence 
with denosumab compared to alendronate. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, 
the probabilities of denosumab being cost-effective compared with alendronate 
were 89-100% at a willingness-to-pay of $50,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Among community-dwelling elderly osteoporotic women in Japan, 
denosumab every 6 months for 5 years is cost-saving or cost-effective at a 
conventionally accepted threshold of willingness-to-pay at all ages examined,
