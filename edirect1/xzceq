INTRODUCTION: Femoral periprosthetic fracture (FPF) is a frequent complication 
in dependent elderly persons, with a limited life expectancy. Their management 
is difficult and the choice between osteosynthesis and prosthesis is still 
matter of discussion. To date, there is no study on unlocked plate with 
integrated cerclage cable and trochanteric hook for this indication. The 
objectives of this study were to analyze fracture healing, complication rate and 
functional outcome. Our hypothesis is that this technique allows a high rate of 
consolidation and a return to the previous state in terms of autonomy and place 
of residence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study between 
2010 and 2015. The inclusion criteria were: patients with type A and B FPF 
according to the classification of Vancouver who received osteosynthesis hook 
plate. The evaluation focused on the consolidation period, complications and pre 
and postoperative Parker and Katz scores. Death, nonunion, dislocation, 
infection and failure of fixation were considered major complications.
RESULTS: Forty-five patients met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated at 
mean 20 months (6-72). All fractures consolidated at a mean 7 weeks (6-10), 
except one that has not undergone further surgery in the absence of functional 
impairment. Parker score decreased from 6.4 to 4.9 (p=0.03) and Katz score from 
4.8 to 4.3 (p=0.045). Five patients died within the year of the operation. Five 
patients living at home preoperatively were admitted to an institution, the 
others returned to their retirement home or nursing home.
CONCLUSION: This plate allows for a quick and effective management of patients 
with FPF. The low rate of complications and the very good consolidation rate 
lead us to use the same plate even for class B2 or B3 fractures in some patients 
with precarious health condition who cannot tolerate major revision surgery: 
Elderly, ASA score >3, loss of autonomy, Katz score <4.

BACKGROUND: Despite significant improvement in clinical care, operative 
strategies, and technology, neurosurgery is still risky, and optimal 
preoperative planning and anatomical assessment are necessary to minimize the 
risks of serious complications. Our purpose was to document the dural venous 
sinuses (DVS) and their variations identified during routine 3-dimensional (3D) 
venography created through 3D models for the teaching of complex cerebral 
anatomy.
METHODS: 3D models of the DVS networks were printed. Compared with the controls, 
cases with cortical venous thrombosis have altered venous anatomy, which has not 
been previously compared.
RESULTS: Geometrical changes between the neighboring DVS could be easily 
manipulated and explored from different angles. Modeling helped to conduct the 
examination in detail with reference to geometrical features of DVS, degree of 
asymmetry, its extension, location, and presence of hypoplasia/atresia channels. 
Challenging DVS anatomy was exposed with models of adverse anatomical variations 
of the DVS network, including highly angulated, asymmetrical view, narrowed 
lumens, and hypoplasia and atresia structures. It assisted us in comprehending 
spatial anatomy configuration of life-like models.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient-specific models of DVS geometry could provide an improved 
understanding of the complex brain anatomy and better navigation in difficult 
areas and allow surgeons to anticipate anatomical issues that might arise during 
the operation. Such models offer opportunities to accelerate the development of 
expertise with respect to new and novel procedures as well as new surgical 
approaches and innovations, thus allowing novice neurosurgeons to gain valuable 
experience in surgical techniques without exposing patients to risk of harm.

INTRODUCTION: Placebo effects (true biopsychological effects not attributable to 
the active ingredients of medical technical interventions) can be attributed to 
several mechanisms, such as expectancy manipulation and empathy manipulation 
elicited by a provider's communication. So far, effects have primarily been 
shown in laboratory settings. The aim of this study is to determine the separate 
and combined effects of expectancy manipulation and empathy manipulation during 
preoperative and postoperative tonsillectomy analgesia care on clinical adult 
patients' outcomes.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using a two-by-two randomised controlled trial, 128 adult 
tonsillectomy patients will be randomly assigned to one out of four conditions 
differing in the level of expectancy manipulation (standard vs enhanced) and 
empathy manipulation (standard vs enhanced). Day care ward nurses are trained to 
deliver the intervention, while patients are treated via the standard analgesia 
protocol and hospital routines. The primary outcome, perceived pain, is measured 
via hospital routine by a Numeric Rating Scale, and additional 
prehospitalisation, perihospitalisation and posthospitalisation questionnaires 
are completed (until day 3, ie, 2 days after the operation). The manipulation is 
checked using audio recordings of nurse-patient interactions.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Although communication is manipulated, the 
manipulations do not cross norms or values of acceptable behaviour. Standard 
medical care is provided. The ethical committee of the UMC Utrecht and the local 
OLVG hospital committee approved the study. Results will be published via 
(inter)national peer-reviewed journals and a lay publication.

OBJECTIVES: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most common inherited 
disorder of the peripheral nervous system, yet no studies have compared the 
mortality in patients with CMT with that of the general population, and 
prevalence estimates vary considerably. We performed a nationwide register-based 
study to investigate the prevalence, incidence and mortality of CMT in Denmark.
DESIGN: We used the Danish National Patient Registry to select all records with 
primary diagnostic codes for CMT between 1977 and 2012 given at a neurological, 
neurophysiological, paediatric or clinical genetic clinic. The prevalence was 
estimated by 31 December 2012, and the incidence rate was calculated based on 
data from 1988 to 2012. We calculated a standardised mortality ratio (SMR) and 
an absolute excess mortality rate (AER) stratified according to age categories 
and disease duration.
RESULTS: A total of 1534 patients (652 women) were identified. The prevalence 
proportion was 22.5 per 100 000 (95% CI 21.2 to 23.7) and the incidence rate was 
0.98 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.04) per 100 000 person-years. The SMR was 1.36 (95% CI 
1.21 to 1.53), and the AER was 4.87 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 2.77 to 6.96). 
We found a significantly higher SMR in cases below 50 years of age, and in cases 
with disease duration of more than 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a reduced life expectancy among patients diagnosed with 
CMT. To our knowledge, this is the first study of CMT to use nationwide 
register-based data, and the first to report an SMR and an AER.

Pharmacokinetic (PK) extension is no longer just a means to create improved 
second generation biologics (so-called biobetters), but constitutes an accepted 
strategy in biopharmaceutical drug development today. Although PEGylation has 
become a widely applied methodology to furnish therapeutic proteins and peptides 
with prolonged plasma half-life, the immunogenicity and missing biodegradability 
of this synthetic polymer has prompted an evident need for alternatives. 
PASylation is based on biological polypeptides made of the small l-amino acids 
Pro, Ala and/or Ser (PAS), which adopt a random coil structure in aqueous 
buffers with surprisingly similar biophysical properties as PEG. In contrast, 
PAS sequences can be conjugated to pharmaceutically active proteins and peptides 
both via chemical coupling and at the genetic level, as so-called fusion 
proteins. PASylation has been successfully applied to numerous biologics, 
including cytokines, growth factors, antibody fragments, enzymes as well as 
various peptides, and validated in diverse animal models, from mice to monkeys. 
Here we compare PASylation with other current strategies for half-life extension 
and we discuss the utility of these approaches for the design of innovative 
peptide-based therapeutics.

Comment in
    Lancet. 2018 Jan 6;391(10115):4-6.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients regularly receive bare-metal stents (BMS) instead 
of drug-eluting stents (DES) to shorten the duration of double antiplatelet 
therapy (DAPT). The aim of this study was to compare outcomes between these two 
types of stents with a short duration of DAPT in such patients.
METHODS: In this randomised single-blind trial, we recruited patients from 44 
centres in nine countries. Patients were eligible if they were aged 75 years or 
older; had stable angina, silent ischaemia, or an acute coronary syndrome; and 
had at least one coronary artery with a stenosis of at least 70% (≥50% for the 
left main stem) deemed eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 
Exclusion criteria were indication for myocardial revascularisation by coronary 
artery bypass grafting; inability to tolerate, obtain, or comply with DAPT; 
requirement for additional surgery; non-cardiac comorbidities with a life 
expectancy of less than 1 year; previous haemorrhagic stroke; allergy to aspirin 
or P2Y12 inhibitors; contraindication to P2Y12 inhibitors; and silent ischaemia 
of less than 10% of the left myocardium with a fractional flow reserve of 0·80 
or higher. After the intended duration of DAPT was recorded (1 month for 
patients with stable presentation and 6 months for those with unstable 
presentation), patients were randomly allocated (1:1) by a central computer 
system (blocking used with randomly selected block sizes [two, four, eight, or 
16]; stratified by site and antiplatelet agent) to either a DES or similar BMS 
in a single-blind fashion (ie, patients were masked), but those assessing 
outcomes were masked. The primary outcome was to compare major adverse cardiac 
and cerebrovascular events (ie, a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, or ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation) between 
groups at 1 year in the intention-to-treat population, assessed at 30 days, 180 
days, and 1 year. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT02099617.
FINDINGS: Between May 21, 2014, and April 16, 2016, we randomly assigned 1200 
patients (596 [50%] to the DES group and 604 [50%] to the BMS group). The 
primary endpoint occurred in 68 (12%) patients in the DES group and 98 (16%) in 
the BMS group (relative risk [RR] 0·71 [95% CI 0·52-0·94]; p=0·02). Bleeding 
complications (26 [5%] in the DES group vs 29 [5%] in the BMS group; RR 0·90 
[0·51-1·54]; p=0·68) and stent thrombosis (three [1%] vs eight [1%]; RR 0·38 
[0·00-1·48]; p=0·13) at 1 year were infrequent in both groups.
INTERPRETATION: Among elderly patients who have PCI, a DES and a short duration 
of DAPT are better than BMS and a similar duration of DAPT with respect to the 
occurrence of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and 
ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation. A strategy of combination of a 
DES to reduce the risk of subsequent repeat revascularisations with a short 
BMS-like DAPT regimen to reduce the risk of bleeding event is an attractive 
option for elderly patients who have PCI.

BACKGROUND: The achievement of high rates of sustained virological response 
(SVR) with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected 
patients will reduce decompensating terminal events.
AIMS: To investigate whether hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence could 
change due to the DAA-induced increase in life-expectancy.
METHODS: A Markov model was built on clinical data of 494 cirrhotic patients and 
available literature to estimate probabilities of "death before HCC" and of "HCC 
occurrence" without and with DAA.
RESULTS: In comparison to untreated patients, DAA therapy reduced the 20-year 
mortality before HCC by 21.9% in patients without varices and by 21.5% in those 
with varices, considering an SVR of 95% and no direct effect on 
hepatocarcinogenesis. Tumour occurrence increased by 5%-8.2% and the proportion 
of HCCs diagnosed in compensated stages increased to >98%. If we consider DAA as 
having "anti-tumoral" effects, the benefit becomes greater, achieving a 20-year 
survival of 81.5% in patients without varices, and 52.2% in patients with 
varices. Instead, if we consider DAA as having a "pro-tumoral" effect, then, the 
increased incidence of HCC nullifies the survival benefits.
CONCLUSION: DAAs drastically reduce the mortality caused by the liver function 
worsening, increasing the proportion of HCCs diagnosed in compensated stages. 
Knowledge of the DAA effect on hepatocarcinogenesis remains pivotal.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Individuals with cystic fibrosis are at increased risk of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with the general population, and risk is higher 
among those who received an organ transplant. We performed a cost-effectiveness 
analysis to determine optimal CRC screening strategies for patients with cystic 
fibrosis.
METHODS: We adjusted the existing Microsimulation Screening Analysis-Colon model 
to reflect increased CRC risk and lower life expectancy in patients with cystic 
fibrosis. Modeling was performed separately for individuals who never received 
an organ transplant and patients who had received an organ transplant. We 
modeled 76 colonoscopy screening strategies that varied the age range and 
screening interval. The optimal screening strategy was determined based on a 
willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per life-year gained. Sensitivity and 
supplementary analyses were performed, including fecal immunochemical test (FIT) 
as an alternative test, earlier ages of transplantation, and increased rates of 
colonoscopy complications, to assess if optimal screening strategies would 
change.
RESULTS: Colonoscopy every 5 years, starting at an age of 40 years, was the 
optimal colonoscopy strategy for patients with cystic fibrosis who never 
received an organ transplant; this strategy prevented 79% of deaths from CRC. 
Among patients with cystic fibrosis who had received an organ transplant, 
optimal colonoscopy screening should start at an age of 30 or 35 years, 
depending on the patient's age at time of transplantation. Annual FIT screening 
was predicted to be cost-effective for patients with cystic fibrosis. However, 
the level of accuracy of the FIT in this population is not clear.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a Microsimulation Screening Analysis-Colon model, we found 
screening of patients with cystic fibrosis for CRC to be cost effective. Because 
of the higher risk of CRC in these patients, screening should start at an 
earlier age with a shorter screening interval. The findings of this study 
(especially those on FIT screening) may be limited by restricted evidence 
available for patients with cystic fibrosis.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has a major effect on life expectancy with 
functional degeneracy of the lungs and right heart. Interleukin-13 (IL-13), one 
of the type 2 cytokines mainly associated with allergic diseases, has recently 
been reported to be associated with Schistosomiasis-associated PAH which shares 
pathological features with other forms of PAH, such as idiopathic PAH and 
connective tissue disease-associated PAH. But a direct pathological role of 
IL-13 in the development of PAH has not been explored. We examined the effects 
of recombinant human IL-13 on the function of primary human pulmonary artery 
endothelial cells (HPAECs) to examine how IL-13 influences exacerbation of PAH. 
IL-13 increased the expression of Rictor, which is a key molecule of mammalian 
target of rapamycin complex 2. Treatment of IL-13 induced HPAEC migration via 
Rictor. Rictor was directly regulated by both miR-424 and 503 (miR-424/503). 
Therefore, IL-13 increases Rictor level by regulating miR-424/503, causing the 
increase of HPAEC migration. Since enhancement of HPAEC migration in the lung is 
thought to be associated with PAH, these data suggest that IL-13 takes some 
roles in exacerbating PAH.

Chitosan/silk fibroin/glycerophosphate gels were loaded with nerve growth factor 
(NGF) and further processed into multi-tubule fillers. NGF was loaded into the 
fillers in such a way so that a NGF gradient was established longitudinally 
along the filler length. A type of poly(lactide-co-glycolide)(PLGA)/chitosan(CH) 
porous conduit was fabricated using a pre-crosslinking method. The filler was 
fully filled into the lumen of conduits to build multi-tubule conduit-filler 
constructs that are intended for long-gap peripheral nerve repair. In vitro 
degradation in a lysozyme-contained medium revealed that constructs had 
degradation-tolerant features and the optimized multi-tubule filler was capable 
of maintaining its multi-tubules unblocked for around 10-week. After being 
degraded for various periods up to 8 weeks, the optimal conduit-filler 
constructs showed confirmative ability to retain their compressive load, 
deformation recovery and tensile strength at about 80N/m, 75% and 15N/cm2 in wet 
state, respectively. The constructs were able to administer NGF release and to 
maintain persistent NGF gradients longitudinally distributed inside the PLGA/CH 
conduit for about 6 weeks or even longer. The PC12 cell neurite extension assay 
confirmed that the presently developed multi-tubule conduit-filler constructs 
were reliable for effectively preserving the bioactivity of released NGF.

Clinical and economic evaluation of modulated electrohyperthermia concurrent to 
dose-dense temozolomide 21/28 days regimen in the treatment of recurrent 
glioblastoma: a retrospective analysis of a two-centre German cohort trial with 
systematic comparison and effect-to-treatment analysis.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of modulated 
electrohyperthermia (mEHT) concurrent to dose-dense temozolomide (ddTMZ) 21/28 
days regimen versus ddTMZ 21/28 days alone in patients with recurrent 
glioblastoma (GBM).
DESIGN: A cohort of 54 patients with recurrent GBM treated with ddTMZ+mEHT in 
2000-2005 was systematically retrospectively compared with five pooled ddTMZ 
21/28 days cohorts (114 patients) enrolled in 2008-2013.
RESULTS: The ddTMZ+mEHT cohort had a not significantly improved mean survival 
time (mST) versus the comparator (p=0.531) after a significantly less mean 
number of cycles (1.56 vs 3.98, p<0.001). Effect-to-treatment analysis (ETA) 
suggests that mEHT significantly enhances the efficacy of the ddTMZ 21/28 days 
regimen (p=0.011), with significantly less toxicity (no grade III-IV toxicity vs 
45%-92%, p<0.0001). An estimated maximal attainable median survival time is 
10.10 months (9.10-11.10). Cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that, unlike 
ddTMZ 21/28 days alone, ddTMZ+mEHT is cost-effective versus the applicable 
cost-effectiveness thresholds €US$25 000-50 000/quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY). Budget impact analysis suggests a significant saving of 
€8 577 947/$11 201 761 with 29.1-38.5 QALY gained per 1000 patients per year. 
Cost-benefit analysis suggests that mEHT is profitable and will generate 
revenues between €3 124 574 and $6 458 400, with a total economic effect 
(saving+revenues) of €5 700 034 to $8 237 432 per mEHT device over an 8-year 
period.
CONCLUSIONS: Our ETA suggests that mEHT significantly improves survival of 
patients receiving the ddTMZ 21/28 days regimen. Economic evaluation suggests 
that ddTMZ+mEHT is cost-effective, budget-saving and profitable. After 
confirmation of the results, mEHT could be recommended for the treatment of 
recurrent GBM as a cost-effective enhancer of ddTMZ regimens, and, probably, of 
the regular 5/28 days regimen. mEHT is applicable also as a single treatment if 
chemotherapy is impossible, and as a salvage treatment after the failure of 
chemotherapy.

No published studies have compared the outcome after transcatheter aortic valve 
implantation (TAVI) with the outcome in the general population. Thus, it is 
unknown whether TAVI restores normal life expectancy and stroke risk. 
Furthermore, despite the increasing use of TAVI, only little is known about the 
temporal trends for TAVI regarding patient characteristics and outcomes. We 
identified all Danish patients treated with TAVI from 2006 to 2014 (n = 1,631) 
and 9,737 general population controls matched by gender, age, and co-morbidity. 
The primary end point was a composite end point of all-cause mortality and 
stroke. During the first 90 days, the risk of the combined end point, the stroke 
risk, and mortality were significantly higher among TAVI patients compared with 
controls (9.4%, 7.5%, and 2.5%, respectively, in TAVI patients compared with 
2.0%, 1.6%, and 0.5% in controls). After 90 days, there were no differences 
(adjusted mortality rate ratio, stroke rate ratio, and mortality or stroke rate 
ratio 0.92 [0.79 to 1.06], 1.32 [0.98 to 1.78], and 1.00 [0.90 to 1.10], 
respectively). During the study period, there were small changes in the 
characteristics of patients treated with TAVI; however, more patients were 
treated by transfemoral access; fewer needed blood transfusions, hospital stays 
were shorter, and the overall mortality rate decreased. In conclusion, 90 days 
after TAVI, the stroke risk and mortality of the TAVI patients were comparable 
with the stroke risk and mortality of the general population. Over time, the 
patient risk profiles have remained largely unchanged; however, outcomes have 
improved substantially, including lower short- and long-term mortality.

People's life expectancy is increasing throughout the world as a result of 
improved living standards and medical advances. The natural ageing process is 
accompanied by physiological changes which can have significant consequences for 
mobility. As a consequence, older people tend to make fewer journeys than other 
adults and may change their transport mode. Access to public transport can help 
older people to avail themselves of goods, services, employment and other 
activities. With the current generation of older people being more active than 
previous generations of equivalent age, public transport will play a crucial 
role in maintaining their active life style even when they are unable to drive. 
Hence, public transport is important to older people's quality of life, their 
sense of freedom and independence. Within the European Commission funded GOAL 
(Growing Older and staying mobile) project, the requirements of older people 
using public transport were studied in terms of four main issues: Affordability, 
availability, accessibility and acceptability. These requirements were then 
analysed in terms of five different profiles of older people defined within the 
GOAL project - 'Fit as a Fiddle', 'Hole in the Heart', 'Happily Connected', An 
'Oldie but a Goodie' and 'Care-Full'. On the basis of the analysis the paper 
brings out some areas of knowledge gaps and research needed to make public 
transport much more attractive and used by older people in the 21st century.

In this short review, the author performs a database search, summarizes, and 
discusses studies that provide information on the need to perform awake surgery 
to preserve quality of life/return to work of adult patients who undergo 
resection for a supratentorial low-grade glioma (LGG). Based upon the currently 
available data, the author concludes that in LGG, patients with no or only mild 
deficits at diagnosis, non-awake surgery can no longer be achieved. Indeed, 
awake craniotomy with intrasurgical electrical mapping has resulted in an 
increase of the extent of resection and overall survival in LGG. Furthermore, in 
order to resume a normal familial, social, and professional life, LGG patients 
with a prolonged survival expectancy have to benefit not only from language 
mapping when the tumor involves the left "dominant" hemisphere, but also from 
intraoperative mapping of sensorimotor, visuospatial, higher cognitive, and 
emotional functions under local anesthesia, even for gliomas situated within 
presumed "non-language" areas such as the right "non-dominant" hemisphere. In 
other words, the ultimate goal is to map the functional connectome for each 
patient in order to perform the resection up to the eloquent networks and then 
to optimize the onco-functional balance of LGG surgery. To this end, an 
objective neuropsychological assessment has to be achieved in a more systematic 
manner before and after resection. Early postoperative cognitive rehabilitation 
is also recommended, whenever needed.

AIMS: Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is used to treat acute ischemic stroke 
up to 4.5 h after symptom onset. Its cost-effectiveness in developing countries 
is not specified yet. This study aimed to study cost-effectiveness of tPA in 
Iran.
METHODS: This is a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the third 
party payer to compare IV tPA with no tPA of ischemic stroke. A Markov model 
with a lifetime horizon was used to analyze the costs and outcomes. Cost data 
were extracted from the 94 patients admitted in two hospitals in Iran. All costs 
were calculated based on US dollars in 2016. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
were extracted from previously published literature. Cost-effectiveness was 
determined by calculating ICER by TreeAge Pro 2011 software.
RESULTS: Lifetime costs of no tPA strategy were higher than tPA ($10,718 in the 
no tPA group compared with $8,796 in the tPA group). The tPA arm gained 0.20 
QALY compared with no tPA. ICER was $8,471 per QALY. ICER value suggests that 
tPA is cost-effective compared with no tPA.
LIMITATIONS: The limitations of the present study are the reliance on calculated 
QALY value of other countries and difficulty in accessing patients treated with 
tPA.
CONCLUSIONS: The balance of hospitalization and rehabilitation costs and QALYs 
support the conclusion that treatment with intravenous tPA in the 4.5-h time 
window is cost-effective from the perspectives of the third party payer and 
inclusion of tPA in the insurance benefit package being reasonable.

Late-onset type I endoleak characterized by contrast enhanced ultrasound after 
endovascular repair of aortic aneurysm.

We report in the case of a patient with an intra-abdominal aortic aneurysm 
treated with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) who developed renal impairment 
during the period of follow up. The repair was complicated with an early-onset 
type II endoleak which later evolved into a late-onset type I endoleak. It was 
treated with proximal extension of stent graft, with treatment success and 
follow-up documented on contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). This case 
illustrates the usefulness of CEUS in post-EVAR surveillance and emphasizes the 
need for life-long monitoring as late-onset complications are not uncommon.

AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a two-component intervention designed 
to increase attendance at the NHS Stop Smoking Services (SSSs) in England.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial 
(Start2quit).
SETTING: NHS SSS and general practices in England.
PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 4384 smokers aged 16 years or more identified 
from medical records in 99 participating practices, who were motivated to quit 
and had not attended the SSS in the previous 12 months.
INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention was a personalized and tailored letter 
sent from the general practitioner (GP) and a personal invitation and 
appointment to attend a taster session providing information about SSS. Control 
was a standard generic letter from the GP advertising SSS and asking smokers to 
contact the service to make an appointment.
MEASUREMENTS: Costs measured from an NHS/personal social services perspective, 
estimated health gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) measured with 
EQ-5D and incremental cost per QALY gained during both 6 months and a life-time 
horizon.
FINDINGS: During the trial period, the adjusted mean difference in costs was £92 
[95% confidence interval (CI) = -£32 to -£216) and the adjusted mean difference 
in QALY gains was 0.002 (95% CI = -0.001 to 0.004). This generates an 
incremental cost per QALY gained of £59 401. The probability that the tailored 
letter and taster session is more cost-effective than the generic letter at 6 
months is never above 50%. In contrast, the discounted life-time health-care 
cost was lower in the intervention group, while the life-time QALY gains were 
significantly higher. The probability that the intervention is more 
cost-effective is more than 83% using a £20 000-30 000 per QALY-gained 
decision-making threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: An intervention designed to increase attendance at the NHS Stop 
Smoking Services (tailored letter and taster session in the services) appears 
less likely to be cost-effective than a generic letter in the short term, but is 
likely to become more cost-effective than the generic letter during the long 
term.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most commonly 
recognized cause of recurrent diarrhea. Bezlotoxumab, administered concurrently 
with antibiotics directed against C. difficile (standard of care [SoC]), has 
been shown to reduce the recurrence of CDI, compared with SoC alone. This study 
aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of bezlotoxumab administered concurrently 
with SoC, compared with SoC alone, in subgroups of patients at risk of 
recurrence of CDI.
METHODS: A computer-based Markov health state transition model was designed to 
track the natural history of patients infected with CDI. A cohort of patients 
entered the model with either a mild/moderate or severe CDI episode, and were 
treated with SoC antibiotics together with either bezlotoxumab or placebo. The 
cohort was followed over a lifetime horizon, and costs and utilities for the 
various health states were used to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs). Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
used to test the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness model showed that, compared with placebo, 
bezlotoxumab was associated with 0.12 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained 
and was cost-effective in preventing CDI recurrences in the entire trial 
population, with an ICER of $19824/QALY gained. Compared with placebo, 
bezlotoxumab was also cost-effective in the subgroups of patients aged ≥65 years 
(ICER of $15298/QALY), immunocompromised patients (ICER of $12597/QALY), and 
patients with severe CDI (ICER of $21430/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Model-based results demonstrated that bezlotoxumab was 
cost-effective in the prevention of recurrent CDI compared with placebo, among 
patients receiving SoC antibiotics for treatment of CDI.

Cost-effectiveness of screening type 2 diabetes patients for chronic kidney 
disease progression with the CKD273 urinary peptide classifier as compared to 
urinary albumin excretion.

BACKGROUND: In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) progression may occur without detectable changes in urinary albumin 
excretion (UAE) rate. A new urinary peptide classifier (CKD273) has exhibited 
greater ability to detect CKD progression, however, its cost-effectiveness 
remains unknown. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of screening for 
CKD progression with the CKD273 classifier, as compared to UAE, in diabetic 
patients.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to estimate costs and 
health outcomes [including overall survival and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs)] from a health system perspective for adopting a new annual screening 
strategy based on the CKD273 classifier as compared to annual UAE-based 
screening in a hypothetical cohort of T2DM patients. High-risk patients were 
defined as T2DM patients with at least one concomitant risk factor (i.e. 
patients with background genetic risk for developing the disease, obesity, 
hypertension and/or smoking history) for developing diabetic nephropathy 
secondary to cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related complications. Low-risk T2DM 
patients, were defined as those not having any of the aforementioned concomitant 
risk factors.
RESULTS: Over the projected course of a patient's lifetime, in all T2DM patients 
annual screening with the CKD273 classifier was more costly, but also more 
effective, than annual screening with UAE. The incremental costs incurred with 
screening based on the CKD273 classifier were €3,053 per patient, while patients 
gained 0.13 QALYs. Hence, in all patients, annual screening with the CKD273 
classifier was cost effective [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
€23,903/QALY gained], notably below current government thresholds for funding 
such health care interventions. For patients at high risk of developing diabetic 
nephropathy secondary to CVD-related complications, screening based on the 
CKD273 classifier was cost-saving (i.e. dominant, being both more effective and 
less expensive than UAE-based screening). Finally, in low-risk patients, CKD273 
classifier-based screening was not cost effective (ICER €73,140/QALY) given 
current government willingness-to-pay thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: In diabetic patients, annual CKD273 classifier-based screening is 
more costly but also more effective in QALYs gained as compared to UAE. From a 
health provider perspective, the observed benefits are greatest when such 
screening is implemented in patients at high risk for diabetes-associated renal 
or cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).

With increasing life expectancy, fragility fractures of the pelvic ring are seen 
more frequently. Although their osteosynthesis can be very challenging, specific 
biomechanical studies for investigation of the fixation stability are still 
lacking. The aim of this study was to biomechanically evaluate four different 
fixation methods for sacrum Denis type II fractures in osteoporotic bone. 
Unstable Denis type II vertical sacrum fractures were created in 16 human 
pelves. Their osteosynthesis was performed with one sacro-iliac screw, posterior 
sacral plating, triangular fixation, or spino-pelvic fixation. For that purpose, 
each pelvis was randomly assigned to two paired groups for treatment with either 
SI-screw/posterior sacral plating or triangular fixation/spino-pelvic fixation. 
Each hemi-pelvis was cyclically tested under progressively increasing axial 
compression. Relative interfragmentary movements were investigated via optical
