Aim: Delayed diagnosis of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) 
represents a missed opportunity for intervention. This study estimates the 
health benefits of timely diagnosis and treatment with tafamidis. Methods: A 
disease simulation model was developed to predict health outcomes under 
scenarios of timely and delayed diagnosis and treatment. Efficacy and quality of 
life (QoL) profiles were derived from the pivotal tafamidis trial and diagnostic 
delay durations from the literature. Results: Timely diagnosis and treatment 
were predicted to extend mean life expectancy by 5.46 and 7.76 years, relative 
to delayed diagnosis, for wild-type and hereditary ATTR-CM, respectively. 
Corresponding QALY gains were 4.50 and 6.22. Conclusion: Timely diagnosis and 
treatment with tafamidis are predicted to significantly improve survival and QoL 
for ATTR-CM patients.

BACKGROUND: There has been little in the way of study of nonagenarians with 
acute kidney injury (AKI, defined in lines with KDIGO guidelines), but the rise 
in their life expectancy makes further study of this population necessary. The 
aim of this study is to assess mortality in nonagenarians with AKI during 
hospitalization.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients with AKI during hospitalization 
between 2013-2014 were included. At baseline, epidemiological variables, 
comorbidities and treatments were collected. Analytics and mortality were 
studied during hospitalisation. Univariate analysis was carried out to evaluate 
mortality-associated variables. A logistic regres-sion analysis was carried out 
to demonstrate independent predictors for mortality.
RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-four nonagenarian patients were included. Mean 
age was 93±3 years, 73 (27.7?%) of whom were men. During hospitalization, 79 
patients (29.9?%) died. Comorbidities related to mortality were history of heart 
failure (p?=?0.018), diastolic dysfunction (p?<?0.042) and higher dependence 
according to the modified Barthel index (p?=?0.003). The clinical variables 
related to mortality at hospital admission were lower systolic (p?=?0.016) and 
diastolic blood pressure (p?=?0.013), higher white blood cell count (p?=?0.003), 
greater severity of AKI (p?=?0.003) and L-?lactic (p?=?0.005). In an adjusted 
multivariate analysis, history of heart failure (OR?=?2.31, 95%CI: 1.07-5.00, 
p?=?0.036), depend-ence according to the Barthel index (OR?=?0.80, 95%CI: 
0.67-0.97, p?=?0.016) and L-?lactic acid (OR?=?1.31, 95%IC: 1.06-1.61, 
p?=?0.005) were independent predictors of mortality.
CONCLUSION: Heart failure, dependence according to the Barthel index and 
L-?lactic acid at admission are independent predictors of mortality in 
nonagenarians hospitalized with AKI.

FUNDAMENTO: El desarrollo de un fracaso renal agudo (FRA, definido siguiendo las 
guías KDIGO) durante una hospitalización en pacientes nonagenarios ha sido poco 
estudiado. El objetivo del presente estudio es analizar la mortalidad en 
pacientes nonagenarios hospitalizados que desarrollan un FRA.
MÉTODOS: Se recogieron todos los pacientes nonagenarios que desarrollaron FRA 
durante el ingreso hospitalario entre 2013 y 2014. Basalmente, se recogieron 
variables epidemiológicas, comorbilidades y, durante el ingreso, variables 
analíticas y mortalidad. Se analizaron las variables asociadas a mortalidad 
durante el episodio de FRA y los predictores independientes mediante regresión 
logística.
RESULTADOS: Se incluyeron 264 pacientes nonagenarios con FRA. La edad media fue 
93±3 años, siendo 73 (27,7 %) varones. Durante la hospitalización fallecieron 79 
pacientes (29,9 %). Las comorbilidades asociadas a mortalidad fueron la 
insuficiencia cardiaca (p = 0,018), la disfunción diastólica (p = 0,042) y un 
mayor nivel o grado de dependencia (p = 0,003). Las variables clínicas en el 
momento del ingreso que se asociaron a mortalidad fueron presión arterial 
sistólica y diastólica más baja (p = 0,016 y 0,013, respectivamente), 
leucocitosis (p = 0,003), mayor severidad del FRA valorado por AKIN (p = 0,003) 
y valor de ácido L- láctico más alto (p = 0,005). Los predictores independientes 
de mortalidad fueron la insuficiencia cardiaca (OR = 2,31; IC95%: 1,07-5,00; p = 
0,036), la dependencia valorada por el índice de Barthel modificado (OR = 0,80; 
IC95%: 0,67-0,97; p < 0,016) y el L- láctico al ingreso (OR = 1,31; IC95%: 
1,06-1,61; p = 0,005).
CONCLUSIÓN: La insuficiencia cardiaca, el nivel de dependencia y el ácido L- 
láctico al ingreso son predictores independientes de mortalidad en pacientes 
nonagenarios hospitalizados con FRA.

OBJECTIVES: Although several randomized clinical trials performed in children 6 
years and older with Omalizumab as add-on therapy have reported improvements in 
diverse clinical outcomes, the evidence regarding its cost effectiveness is not 
sufficient, especially in less-affluent countries, where the clinical and 
economic burden of the disease is the greatest. The aim of the present study was 
to perform a cost-utility analysis of adding omalizumab to standard treatment 
for treating pediatric patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma in 
Colombia, a middle-income country (MIC).
METHODS: A Markov-type model was developed to estimate costs and health outcomes 
of a simulated cohort of pediatric patients with persistent asthma treated over 
a 5-year period. The effectiveness data and transition probabilities were 
obtained from various sources, including systematic reviews with meta-analysis. 
Cost data were obtained from official databases provided by the Colombian 
Ministry of Health. The study was carried out from the perspective of the 
national healthcare system in Colombia. The main outcome was the variable 
''quality-adjusted life-years'' (QALYs).
RESULTS: For the base-case analysis, the cost-utility analysis showed that 
compared with the standard treatment strategy, the omalizumab strategy involved 
higher costs (US$72,142.3 vs. $20,243.4 average cost per patient) and greater 
gain in QALYs (0.8718 vs. 0.8222 QALYs on average per patient). The incremental 
cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of omalizumab compared with standard treatment was 
US$82,748.1 per QALY CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that in Colombia, an MIC, 
compared with standard treatment, omalizumab is not a cost-effective strategy 
for treating pediatric patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma.

The maximal power generating capacity of a muscle declines with age and has a 
negative impact on the performance of daily life activities. As muscle power is 
the product of force and velocity, we recruited 20 young (10 men, 10 women: 
20-31 years) and 20 older (10 men, 10 women: 65-86 years) people to investigate 
which of these components contributes to the lower power and performance in old 
age. After determination of the maximal isometric knee extension torque (MVC), 
they performed a countermovement jump (CMJ) in 1) the normal situation (normal), 
2) with an extra load of 15% body weight (loaded) and 3) 15% lower body weight 
(unloaded with a pulley system), and a timed up-and-go test (TUG) in the normal 
or loaded condition. The TUG and CMJ performance was lower in old than young 
participants (p<0.001). Below a critical CMJ peak power of ~23.7 W·kg-1 TUG 
showed a progressive decrease. The CMJ take-off velocity (Voff) in the normal 
condition was lower in old than young participants (p<0.001). However, the Voff 
vs. body weight/MVC relationship of the normal, loaded and unloaded data 
combined was similar in the old and young participants and fitted the Hill 
equation (R2 = 0.396). This indicates that 1) only when peak power drops below a 
critical threshold TUG becomes impaired and 2) there was no evidence for 
intrinsic slowing of the muscle contractile properties in older people, but 
rather the older people were working on a slower part of the force-velocity 
relationship due to weaker muscles.

WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Smoking is more common among people with serious 
mental illness, and it contributes to a reduced life expectancy. Several Western 
countries have successfully introduced smoke-free policies in inpatient mental 
health units. There is virtually no information about attitudes to smoking bans 
in mental health units from countries in the Middle East and North Africa 
region. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: We surveyed mental health 
professionals working in Qatar's main mental health service to determine support 
for and attitudes towards a proposed total smoking ban in psychiatric wards. 
Most staff who completed the survey supported an inpatient smoking ban. However, 
further analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, showed markedly ambivalent 
attitudes, that is staff simultaneously held attitudes that supported and 
opposed a smoking ban. Professionals who did not support a ban were more likely 
to have not received smoking cessation training in the last 5 years, to be a 
psychiatrist rather than a nurse or allied mental health professional, to be 
current smokers and to be a Middle Eastern and North African national. WHAT ARE 
THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Further staff training is necessary to achieve 
more consistent attitudes that support a total smoking ban and increase the 
likelihood of successful implementation. The attitudes in this study showed 
similarities and differences to those reported for mental health professionals 
in Western countries. This highlights that local research is necessary to help 
shape training and successfully implement smoke-free policies. ABSTRACT: 
Introduction Despite the fact that patients with serious mental illness (SMI) 
have high rates of smoking and an increased standardized mortality, there is 
virtually no information about attitudes to smoking bans in mental health units 
from countries in the Middle East and North Africa region. Aim To assess support 
for, and attitudes towards, a proposed total smoking ban in psychiatric wards 
among mental health clinicians in Qatar. Method Cross-sectional survey of mental 
health professionals working in Qatar's primary mental health service. Results 
The response rate was 68% (353/520). Support for a ban was assessed with a 
single-item question; 73% of respondents supported a ban with opposition 
significantly (p < .05) associated with being a current smoker, a Middle Eastern 
and North African (MENA) national, a psychiatrist versus a mental health nurse 
or allied health professional and not receiving smoking cessation training in 
the last 5 years. A 21-item questionnaire assessed attitudes to a total smoking 
ban. It showed marked ambivalence with multiple linear regression identifying 
MENA nationality, male gender and current smoking status as independent 
variables influencing attitudes. The most strongly held attitude supporting a 
ban was concern about passive smoking and against a ban was concern it may 
increase patient agitation. Qualitative data confirmed ambivalent views. 
Discussion The results show similarities and differences to research from other 
countries suggesting that cultural factors influence some attitudes to 
smoke-free policies. Implications for Practice Staff support and smoking 
cessation education are necessary to achieve more consistent staff attitudes to 
support smoke-free policies.

BACKGROUND: . In CLEAR-108-a phase 3, randomised, open-label study-once-daily 
amikacin liposome inhalation suspension (ALIS) was noninferior to twice-daily 
tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) in improving lung function in patients with 
cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection after 3 
treatment cycles (28 days on/28 days off). The CLEAR-110 extension study 
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01316276; EudraCT: 2011-000443-24) assessed long-term 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ALIS in eligible patients who completed 
CLEAR-108.
METHODS: . Patients received once-daily ALIS 590 mg for 12 treatment cycles (96 
weeks). Patients were grouped by prior treatment: the "prior-ALIS" cohort 
received ALIS in CLEAR-108, and the "ALIS-naive" cohort received TIS in 
CLEAR-108.
RESULTS: . Overall, 206 patients (prior-ALIS, n=92; ALIS-naive, n=114) entered 
CLEAR-110 and received ≥1 dose of ALIS. Most patients (88.8%) experienced ≥1 
treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) through day 672 (end of year 2). Most 
TEAEs (72.3%) were mild or moderate in severity. Severe TEAEs were reported in 
31 patients (15.0%). Two life-threatening TEAEs (haemoptysis; intestinal 
obstruction) and 1 death (cardiac failure) were reported. Twenty-one patients 
(10.2%) discontinued treatment due to a TEAE (mostly infective pulmonary 
exacerbation of CF). Mean change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 
second percent predicted at day 672 was -3.1% (prior-ALIS, -4.0%; ALIS-naive, 
-2.3%). Mean change from baseline in sputum density of P. aeruginosa at day 672 
was 0.02 (prior-ALIS, -0.16; ALIS-naive, 0.19) log CFU/g.
CONCLUSIONS: . Long-term treatment with ALIS was well tolerated with a 
favourable adverse event profile and demonstrated continued antibacterial 
activity in CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection.

OBJECTIVES: To develop criteria for identifying potentially inappropriate 
prescribing of medications for symptomatic relief in older adults (≥65 years) 
with cancer who are receiving palliative care and have an estimated life 
expectancy of <1 year.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-round Delphi exercise was conducted using web-based 
questionnaires. A panel of 18 expert stakeholders with expertise in palliative 
care, oncology and/or geriatric medicine across Ireland and the United Kingdom 
rated their level of agreement with each statement using a 5-point Likert scale 
and had the option of adding free-text comments throughout the questionnaire. A 
priori decision rules were used to accept or reject criteria.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight criteria were presented in Round 1. Group consensus was 
achieved for 15 criteria which were included in the final set of criteria. 
Following a review of the panel's ratings and additional comments for the 
remaining 13 criteria, four criteria were removed from Round 2. Group consensus 
was achieved for all nine criteria included in Round 2. The final set comprised 
24 criteria relating to: anorexia-cachexia (n = 1); anxiety (n = 2); 
constipation (n = 5); delirium (n = 1); depression (n = 3); diarrhoea (n = 1); 
dyspnoea/breathlessness (n = 1); fatigue (n = 2); insomnia (n = 2); nausea and 
vomiting (n = 2); pain (n = 3); duplicate drug classes (n = 1).
CONCLUSION: A consensus-agreed set of prescribing criteria has been developed 
for identifying potentially inappropriate prescribing of medications for 
symptomatic relief in older adults with cancer who are receiving palliative care 
and have an estimated life expectancy of less than one year. Future studies 
should examine the application and validity of these criteria.

BACKGROUND: Severe obesity is associated with adverse health outcomes and 
increased risk of death. This study evaluates the real-world cost-utility of 
therapy for severe obesity, from the publicly funded health care system and 
societal perspectives.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis using primary data from a 
prospective observational cohort of adults living with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 35 
kg/m2 and a major medical comorbidity or BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) who were enrolled in a 
regional obesity program over 2 years. We extrapolated 10-year and lifetime 
Markov models, validated and supplemented with literature sources, to compare 
medical, surgical and standard care therapies. We performed deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The cohort included 500 adults living with severe obesity, 150 of whom 
received laparoscopic surgical therapy. From a publicly funded health system 
perspective, at 2 years, surgical therapy had an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of $54 456 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with 
standard care therapy. Over a lifetime, it had an ICER of $14 056 per QALY. From 
the societal perspective, at 2 years, surgical therapy had an ICER of $340 per 
QALY; over a lifetime, it was the dominant option. The results were robust to 
sensitivity analysis.
INTERPRETATION: From a public health care perspective, surgery for severe 
obesity is cost effective, and when approached from a societal perspective, it 
becomes cost saving. Real-world data support using surgical therapy for severe 
obesity, and our results contribute to the health economic and clinical 
literature with regard to a robust analysis from a societal perspective.

Improved therapeutic modalities in chronic kidney diseases (CKD) children and 
consequent extension of life expectancy, draws more attention towards secondary 
complications. Cardiovascular adaptations precipitating such terminal events, 
begin in pre-dialysis CKD. Hence, it's imperative to identify modifiable risk 
factors to direct care and resources in haltering CKD progression, evade 
long-term dialysis and anticipate kidney transplantation to avert cardiac 
complications in predialysis period. One hundred and six pre-dialysis patients 
aged one year to 15 years, with estimated glomerular filtration rate of <90 
mL/min/1.73 m2 and proteinuria were included. Patient's history, weight, height 
and blood pressures (BPs) performed. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) 
calculated to correct for patient height to determine raised values of >38.6 
g/m2.7 and of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) >55 g/m2.7. Shortening fraction 
and ejection fraction measured to assess systolic function. Diastolic function 
assessed by Doppler measuring the mitral inflow (e/a) ratio. Hemoglobin, calcium 
phosphorous product, parathyroid hormone and hypertension measured to assess 
cardiac risk factor. The total prevalence of cardiac abnormality was found in 
66.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 57.6%-75.2%. Raised LVMI was seen in 64%, 
among which 34.9% had LVH. Diastolic and systolic dysfunction was found in 12.2% 
and 11.3% respectively. The cardiac abnormality was more prevalent in CKD grade 
IV and V. The independent risk factors were anemia and abnormal diastolic BP 
index which increase the risk for LVH by 3-fold and 5-fold respectively. 
Proportion of cardiac abnormalities were more prevalent in CKD IV and V. Anemia 
and diastolic hypertension were independent risk factors for LVH.

Due to advances in medical science and technology, the number of cancer 
survivors continues to increase. The workplace needs and employment difficulties 
cancer survivors face after treatment need to be addressed to protect these 
individuals' right to work and to maintain the overall labor force of the 
country. We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a follow-up period from 
2004 to 2010. All data analyzed in the study were obtained from the Labor 
Insurance Database, the Taiwan Cancer Registry of the Ministry of Health and 
Welfare, and the National Health Insurance Research Database. The relationships 
between risk factors and the presence of returning to work were analyzed by a 
Cox proportional hazard model. The survival rates of patients with different 
cancer stages were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Among the 
employees with an initial diagnosis of cancer, 70.4% remained employed through 
1 year after the diagnosis, accounting for 83.4% of all cancer survivors; only 
51.1% remained employed through 5 years after the diagnosis, accounting for 
78.7% of all cancer survivors, a notable decrease. Age, gender, salary, 
treatment method, company size, and cancer stage were the factors that affected 
whether employees could return to work or not. The long-term survival of people 
diagnosed with cancer depends on their chances of returning to work. 
Strengthening existing return-to-work policies and assisting cancer survivors 
with returning to work after the treatment should be priorities for protecting 
these individuals' right to work and for maintaining the overall labor force.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential effectiveness of different screening 
strategies for cardiovascular diseases prevention in a community-based Chinese 
population from economically developed area of China.
METHODS: Totally 202 179 adults aged 40 to 74 years without cardiovascular 
diseases at baseline (January 1, 2010) were enrolled from the Chinese electronic 
health records research in Yinzhou (CHERRY) study. Three scenarios were 
considered: the screening strategy based on risk charts recommended by the 2020 
Chinese guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in 
Chinese adults aged 40-74 years (Strategy 1); the screening strategy based on 
the prediction for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in China 
(China-PAR) models recommended by the 2019 Guideline on the assessment and 
management of cardiovascular risk in China in Chinese adults aged 40-74 years 
(Strategy 2); and the screening strategy based on the China-PAR models in 
Chinese adults aged 50-74 years (Strategy 3). According to the guidelines, 
individuals who were classified into medium- or high-risk groups after 
cardiovascular risk assessment by the corresponding strategies would be 
introduced to lifestyle intervention, while high-risk population would take 
medication in addition. Markov model was used to simulate different screening 
scenarios for 10 years (cycles), using parameters mainly from the CHERRY study, 
as well as published data, Meta-analyses and systematic reviews for Chinese 
populations. The life year gained, quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, 
number of cardiovascular disease events/deaths could be prevented and number 
needed to be screened (NNS) were calculated to compare the effectiveness between 
the different strategies. One-way sensitivity analysis on uncertainty of 
cardiovascular disease incidence rate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis on 
uncertainty of distributions for the hazard ratios were conducted.
RESULTS: Compared with non-screening strategy, QALYs gained were 1 433 [95% 
uncertainty interval (UI): 969-1 831], 1 401 (95%UI: 936-1 807), and 716 (95%UI: 
265-1 111) for the Strategies 1, 2, and 3; and the NNS per QALY in the above 
strategies were 141 (95%UI: 110-209), 144 (95%UI: 112-216), and 198 (95%UI: 
127-529), respectively. The Strategies 1 and 2 based on different guidelines 
showed similar effectiveness, while more benefits were found for screening using 
China-PAR models in adults aged 40-74 years than those aged 50-74 years. The 
results were consistent in the sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Screening for cardiovascular diseases in Chinese adults aged above 
40 years seems effective in coastal developed areas of China, and the different 
screening strategies based on risk charts by the 2020 Chinese guideline on the 
primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases or China-PAR models by the 2019 
Guideline on the assessment and management of cardiovascular risk in China may 
have similar effectiveness.

CHERRY)的队列人群中，评估我国不同指南最新推荐的心血管病筛查策略的效果。
方法: 研究对象为2010年1月1日基线未患心血管病的40~74岁的202 179名我国沿海经济发达地区的社区人群。本研究比较的筛查策略包括: 
策略1，在40~74岁人群中采用2020年《中国心血管病一级预防指南》推荐的风险流程图的定性筛查策略; 
策略2，在40~74岁人群中采用2019年《中国心血管病风险评估和管理指南》推荐的中国动脉粥样硬化性心血管病风险预测研究(prediction for 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in China, China-PAR)风险评估模型的定量筛查策略; 
策略3，在50~74岁人群中采用China-PAR模型的定量筛查策略。根据指南推荐，采用上述不同的筛查策略进行风险分层后，对中危及以上人群进行生活方式干预，对高危人群额外进行药物治疗干预。使用马尔可夫模型仿真，研究期限为10年，比较的效果指标包括获得的生命年、质量调整生命年(quality-adjusted 
life year, 
QALY)、可预防的心血管病发病数、心血管病死亡数与全因死亡数以及对应的需筛查人数。马尔可夫模型的参数主要来源于CHERRY队列人群、公开发表的中国人群研究数据、Meta分析及系统综述。采用单因素敏感性分析探讨一般人群心血管病发病率的不确定性对结果的影响，采用概率敏感性分析探讨风险比参数的不确定性。
结果: 与不筛查相比，采用策略1、2、3获得的增量QALYs分别为1 433年[95%不确定性区间(uncertainty interval, UI): 
969~1 831]、1 401年(95%UI: 936~1 807)和716年(95%UI: 265~1 
111)，每获得1个QALY的需筛查人数分别为141人(95%UI: 110~209)、144人(95%UI: 112~216)和198人(95%UI: 
127~529)。在40~74岁人群采用风险流程图的定性筛查策略与China-PAR模型的定量筛查策略效果相似，采用China-PAR模型的定量筛查策略在40~74岁人群进行筛查比在50~74岁人群筛查能够获得更多的健康收益。单因素敏感性分析和概率敏感性分析的结果与主要分析结果一致。
结论: 
在我国沿海经济发达地区的40岁以上社区人群中开展心血管病筛查能够获得更多的健康收益，采用2020年《中国心血管病一级预防指南》推荐的风险流程图的定性筛查策略与2019年《中国心血管病风险评估和管理指南》推荐的China-PAR模型的定量筛查策略可获得相似的筛查效果。

PURPOSE: The incidence and mortality rate of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has 
changed in recent years. Our goal is to determine the epidemiological pattern of 
NPC to help policymakers allocate limited medical resources.
METHODS: Detailed information about NPC from 2009 to 2019 was collected from the 
Global Burden of Disease 2019 database. Age-standardized rates (ASRs) and 
corresponding estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to 
assess NPC's incidence and mortality trends.
RESULTS: Globally, there was a consistent increase in the NPC incidence cases 
from 2009 to 2019 (from 121.65 × 103 cases in 2009 to 176.50 × 103 cases in 
2019, increasing by 45.09%). The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of NPC 
increased from 1.81 in 2009 to 2.12 in 2019 (EAPC = 1.59, 95% CI 1.36-1.81). On 
the contrary, the mortality of NPC showed a downward trend (ASDR: 0.93 in 2009 
and 0.86 in 2019; EAPC = - 0.63, 95% CI - 0.78 to - 0.48), and it was negatively 
correlated with the social demographic index (SDI) in most regions. Both 
incidence and mortality rates of high-incidence territories tended to be stable 
or decline. Males had significantly higher incidence and mortality of NPC than 
females. The number of patients with onset age greater than 50 years old 
accounted for the highest proportion. We found that smoking, occupational 
exposure to formaldehyde, and alcohol use were the main risk factors for 
NPC-related mortality.
CONCLUSION: Globally, the incidence rate of NPC has been slightly increasing, 
while the mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) have been 
decreasing. NPC burden in high-middle and middle SDI areas was the heaviest. The 
current prevention strategy should be repositioned, and some countries should 
formulate more targeted approaches to reduce the current burden of NPC.

Life expectancy for long-term survivors of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (alloHSCT), defined as those living ≥5 years 
post-transplantation, is significantly lower compared with that of the 
age-matched general population despite a relatively low primary disease relapse 
rate at >2 years post-transplantation. Among several factors, patient sex is 
increasingly recognized as a prognostic indicator of long-term survival. We 
examined the influence of patient sex and donor-recipient sex matching on 
overall survival (OS) in a landmark analysis of long-term survivors. Using our 
institutional database supplemented with individual patient record review, we 
retrospectively investigated the relative influence of recipient sex and 
donor-recipient sex matching on outcomes of long-term survivors of alloHSCT 
between 1994 and 2014. Over this 20-year period, 247 met inclusion criteria for 
analysis; males and females had similar demographic and treatment 
characteristics. However, significantly more deaths after the 5-year landmark 
occurred in male recipients. Interestingly, donor sex did not have a significant 
impact on OS in multivariate analysis, and differences in OS of donor-recipient 
sex pairs was driven by recipient sex. In addition to recipient sex, only 
chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) retained significance as a covariate 
with an impact on OS in multivariate analysis. Men experienced slightly higher, 
but statistically nonsignificant, rates and increased severity of cGVHD, and had 
higher cGVHD-related mortality compared with females. In this long-term survival 
analysis of adult alloHSCT recipients, one of the only to include follow-up to 
15 years, our results show that women survive significantly longer than men 
irrespective of their age at transplantation. This outcome is independent of 
other common pretransplantation prognostic indicators, such as donor sex or 
performance status at transplantation. The inferior survival in males is 
consistent with survival outcomes described in the transplantation literature. 
Increasing evidence suggests a biological basis for long-term sex-determined 
outcomes, possibly owing to differing rates or severity of cGVHD or sustained 
alloimmune tolerance in females. Larger studies are warranted to validate these 
retrospective clinical results.

OBJECTIVE: This study tests the argument that industrialisation was accompanied 
by a dramatic worsening of urban health in England.
MATERIALS: Family reconstitutions derived from baptism, marriage and burial 
records for the period before 1837, and from civil registration of deaths and 
census populations between 1837 and 1900.
METHODS: Age-specific mortality rates are used as indicators of population 
health.
RESULTS: The available evidence indicates a decline in urban mortality in the 
period c.1750-1820, especially amongst infants and (probably) rural-urban 
migrants. Mortality at ages 1-4 years demonstrated a more complex pattern, 
falling between 1750 and 1830 before rising abruptly in the mid-nineteenth 
century.
CONCLUSIONS: These patterns are better explained by changes in breastfeeding 
practices and the prevalence or virulence of particular pathogens than by 
changes in sanitary conditions or poverty. Mortality patterns amongst young 
adult migrants were affected by a shift from acute to chronic infectious 
diseases over the period.
SIGNIFICANCE: Pathogen evolution, infant care and migration exerted major 
influences on mortality trends and should be given greater attention in studies 
of the health impacts of British industrialisation.
LIMITATIONS: Evidence of urban mortality rates is very limited before 1837 and 
may not be fully representative of industrialising populations. Mortality also 
provides only a partial picture of the health of urban populations and may be 
distorted by migration patterns.
FURTHER RESEARCH: There is enormous scope for collaboration between 
archaeologists and historians to investigate the health of industrial 
populations, through the triangulation and contextualisation of diverse sources 
of evidence.

BACKGROUND: It is not clear which method is more cost-effective: To initially 
provide all depressed patients with combination therapy (COMB; i.e. cognitive 
behavioural therapy plus pharmacotherapy), followed by antidepressant treatment 
(AD) for those still in depression; or, to first provide AD for all patients, 
followed by COMB for non-remission patients. The aim is to investigate whether a 
COMB-first strategy would be more cost-effective than an AD-first strategy, in 
treating depression.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to perform the analysis. The primary 
outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) at 104 weeks. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario 
analysis were performed, to investigate the uncertainty associated with the 
clinical parameters and the impact of CBT's cost on the results, respectively.
RESULTS: The ICER per QALY at 104 week, was JPY 591,822 (USD 5,725) for moderate 
depression and JPY 499,487 (USD 4,832) for severe one. The scenario analysis 
revealed the ICER became JPY 1,147,518 (USD 11,101) for moderate and JPY 968,484 
(USD 9,369) for severe when the CBT cost was set as JPY 14,400 (USD 139)(i.e. 
GBP 96: the unit cost of CBT in UK), which is well below the threshold 
recommended by NICE (i.e. GBP 20,000-30,000).
LIMITATIONS: This is a model-based analysis which was conducted from the health 
insurance perspective. Then, the analysis from the societal perspective would 
generate different results.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a COMB-first strategy would be more cost 
effective than an AD-first strategy.

INTRODUCTION: Use of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 
nonimmunocompromised adults aged ≥65 years is controversial. Higher-valency 
conjugate vaccines (15-valent and 20-valent ) are under development; their 
potential cost effectiveness in older adults is unknown, particularly when 
potential indirect (herd immunity) effects from childhood vaccination are 
considered.
METHODS: A Markov model estimated the cost effectiveness of current U.S. 
recommendations and alternative strategies using currently available and 
in-development pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in seniors. Separately, 
strategies using a hypothetical 20-valent vaccine adding the 7 most common 
disease-causing non-13-valent vaccine serotypes were considered. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed and alternative scenarios were examined. Data were 
gathered and the analyses were performed in 2020.
RESULTS: In analyses considering only existing and in-development vaccines, sole 
20-valent vaccine use cost $172,491/quality-adjusted life year gained compared 
with current U.S. recommendations under baseline assumptions (equal serotype 
effectiveness and no childhood vaccination indirect effects). Strategies using 
15-valent vaccine were more costly and less effective. When 13-valent/20-valent 
vaccines were assumed ineffective against pneumococcal serotype 3 and 15-valent 
vaccine was fully effective, 15-valent vaccine cost $237,431/quality-adjusted 
life year gained. With indirect effects considered, 15-valent or 20-valent 
vaccine cost >$449,000/quality-adjusted life year gained. When adding 
hypothetical 20-valent vaccine under baseline assumptions, hypothetical 
20-valent vaccine cost $139,348/quality-adjusted life year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: In-development pneumococcal conjugate vaccines may be economically 
unreasonable in older adults, regardless of serotype effectiveness assumptions, 
particularly when considering potential indirect effects from use of those 
vaccines in children. Adult vaccines containing high-risk serotypes not 
contained in childhood vaccines may be more promising.

OBJECTIVE: Combination strategies generate health benefits through improved 
health outcomes among people living with HIV (PLHIV) and prevention of new 
infections. We aimed to determine health benefits attributable to improved 
health among PLHIV versus HIV prevention for a set of combination strategies in 
six US cities.
DESIGN: A dynamic HIV transmission model.
METHODS: Using a model calibrated for Atlanta, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami, 
New York City (NYC) and Seattle, we assessed the health benefits of 
city-specific optimal combinations of evidence-based interventions implemented 
at publicly documented levels and at ideal (90% coverage) scale-up (2020-2030 
implementation, 20-year study period). We calculated the proportion of health 
benefit gains (measured as quality-adjusted life-years) resulting from averted 
and delayed HIV infections; improved health outcomes among PLHIV; and improved 
health outcomes due to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
RESULTS: The HIV-specific proportion of total benefits ranged from 68.3% (95% 
credible interval: 55.3-80.0) in Seattle to 98.5% (97.5-99.3) in Miami, with the 
rest attributable to MOUD. The majority of HIV-specific health benefits in five 
of six cities were attributable HIV prevention, and ranged from 33.1% 
(26.1-41.1) in NYC to 83.1% (79.6-86.6) in Atlanta. Scaling up to ideal service 
levels resulted in three to seven-fold increases in additional health benefits, 
mostly from MOUD, with HIV-specific health gains primarily driven by HIV
