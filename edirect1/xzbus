Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale Preference-Based Measure (MSIS-PBM). 
Deterministic and Monte-Carlo simulation-based ICERs were estimated for 
glatiramer acetate versus symptom management using a lifetime Markov model.
RESULTS: For both UK and Dutch perspectives, mapped and condition-specific 
utility values expressed significantly higher quality of life for the worst 
health state of the model than did EQ-5D. The ICER of glatiramer acetate with 
EQ-5D was US$182,291 for The Netherlands and US$153,476 for the UK. Ratios for 
mapped and condition-specific utilities were between 20 and 60 % higher.
CONCLUSION: The overestimation of quality of life of patients with MS by mapped 
EQ-5D or condition-specific utility values, relative to observed EQ-5D, 
increases the ICER substantially in a lifetime Markov model.

As the world population ages, so the prevalence increases of individuals aged 
100 years or more, known as centenarians. Reaching this age has been described 
as exceptional longevity (EL) and is attributed to both genetic and 
environmental factors. Many genetic variations known to affect life expectancy 
exist in centenarians. This review of studies conducted on centenarians and 
supercentenarians (older than 110 years) updates knowledge of the impacts on 
longevity of the twenty most widely investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs).

Research on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is faced with the challenge of 
understanding how a traumatic experience produces long-lasting detrimental 
effects on behavior and brain functioning, and more globally, how stress 
exacerbates somatic disorders, including cardiovascular disease. Moreover, the 
design of translational research needs to link animal models of PTSD to 
clinically relevant risk factors which address why only a subset of traumatized 
individuals develop persistent psychopathology. In this review, we have 
summarized our psychosocial stress rodent model of PTSD which is based on 
well-described PTSD-inducing risk factors, including a life-threatening 
experience, a sense of horror and uncontrollability, and insufficient social 
support. Specifically, our animal model of PTSD integrates acute episodes of 
inescapable exposure of immobilized rats to a predator with chronic daily social 
instability. This stress regimen produces PTSD-like effects in rats at 
behavioral, cognitive, physiological, pharmacological and epigenetic levels of 
analysis. We have discussed a recent extension of our animal model of PTSD in 
which stress exacerbated coronary pathology following an ischemic event, 
assessed in vitro. In addition, we have reviewed our research investigating 
pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies which may have 
value in clinical approaches toward the treatment of traumatized people. 
Overall, our translational approach bridges the gap between human and animal 
PTSD research to create a framework with which to enhance our understanding of 
the biological basis of trauma-induced pathology and to assess therapeutic 
approaches in the treatment of psychopathology.

OBJECTIVE: Hip fractures cause significant morbidity and mortality. Determining 
the optimal diagnostic strategy for the subset of patients with potential occult 
hip fracture remains challenging. We determined the most cost-effective strategy 
for the diagnosis of occult hip fractures from the choices of performing only 
computed tomography (CT), performing only magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
performing CT and if negative performing MRI (MRI-selective strategy) or 
discharging the patient without advanced imaging.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to compare outcomes and costs of 
different diagnostic strategies for the diagnosis of an occult hip fracture from 
a societal perspective. Model inputs were derived from charge data, Medicare 
reimbursements, and the literature. Strategies with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) below $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained were considered cost-effective. We tested the robustness of our 
results using probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Compared to a CT strategy, MRI provides an additional 0.05 QALY at an 
incremental cost of $1,227 and ICER of $25,438/QALY. For facilities without MRI 
capability, if the cost of transfer is below $1,228, transferring the patient to 
a MRI-capable facility is the most cost-effective strategy. Above this cost, 
employing a CT and if negative transfer to a MRI-capable facility strategy was 
more cost-effective. When the cost of a transfer reached more than $4,039, it 
became more cost-effective to only obtain a CT.
CONCLUSION: MRI is a cost-effective strategy for the diagnosis of an occult hip 
fracture. For facilities without MRI capability, the most cost-effective 
strategy depends on the cost of the interfacility transfer.

Gouty arthritis is one of the most common arthritides. Due to increasing life 
expectancy and changing life style, a rising incidence and prevalence of gout 
can be expected. Because of associations with the diseases metabolic syndrome 
and cardiovascular morbidity, gout patients often suffer from significant 
morbidity. Besides the consequent usage of conventional therapeutics, new 
treatments for gout attacks and for lowering urate levels are available even for 
patients refractory to conventional therapy.

Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare cancer type caused mainly by asbestos 
exposure. The median overall survival time of a mesothelioma cancer patient is 
less than 1-year from diagnosis. Currently there are no curative treatment 
modalities for malignant mesothelioma, however treatments such as surgery, 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy can help to improve patient prognosis and increase 
life expectancy. Pemetrexed-Cisplatin is the only standard of care (SoC) 
chemotherapy for malignant mesothelioma, but the median PFS/OS (progression-free 
survival/overall survival) from the initiation of treatment is only up to 12 
months. Therefore, new treatment strategies against malignant mesothelioma are 
in high demand. ONCOS-102 is a dual targeting, chimeric oncolytic adenovirus, 
coding for human GM-CSF. The safety and immune activating properties of 
ONCOS-102 have already been assessed in phase 1 study (NCT01598129). In this 
preclinical study, we evaluated the antineoplastic activity of combination 
treatment with SoC chemotherapy (Pemetrexed, Cisplatin, Carboplatin) and 
ONCOS-102 in xenograft BALB/c model of human malignant mesothelioma. We 
demonstrated that ONCOS-102 is able to induce immunogenic cell death of human 
mesothelioma cell lines in vitro and showed anti-tumor activity in the treatment 
of refractory H226 malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) xenograft model. While 
chemotherapy alone showed no anti-tumor activity in the mesothelioma mouse 
model, ONCOS-102 was able to slow down tumor growth. Interestingly, a 
synergistic anti-tumor effect was seen when ONCOS-102 was combined with 
chemotherapy regimens. These findings give a rationale for the clinical testing 
of ONCOS-102 in combination with first-line chemotherapy in patients suffering 
from malignant mesothelioma.

AIMS: Brain damage at birth can cause lifelong neurodevelopmental deficits. 
Recently, stem cell therapies have been used in several fields of medicine. We 
previously reported that CD133(+) cells, endothelial progenitor cells derived 
from human umbilical cord blood, induce nerve extension in an ex vivo 
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy model. Here, we used an in vivo model to examine 
the effect of CD133(+) cells in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.
MAIN METHODS: Hypoxic-ischemic brain lesions were induced in neonatal severe 
combined immunodeficiency mice using the Rice-Vannucci method. CD133(+) cells 
were administered by intraperitoneal injection 24h after injury.
KEY FINDINGS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that intraperitoneally 
transplanted CD133(+) cells migrate towards the brain 48h after injection. 
Moreover, in CD133(+) cell-treated animals, motor function improved and the 
brain was protected from the hypoxic-ischemic insult compared with untreated 
animals.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that CD133(+) cells derived from human 
umbilical cord blood have therapeutic potential in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic 
encephalopathy.

BACKGROUND: With dramatic improvements in life expectancy for cystic fibrosis 
(CF) patients, contraception for women with CF has become an important issue. 
There are theoretical concerns that hormonal contraceptive use among women with 
CF may impact disease severity or risk for other adverse health outcomes, 
including thrombosis and poor bone health, as well as concerns that 
malabsorption or altered drug metabolism might impact contraceptive 
effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate evidence on the safety and effectiveness of contraceptive 
methods among women with CF.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the PubMed database for all articles published from 
database inception through October 2015.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies that examined measures of disease 
severity, other health outcomes or indicators of contraceptive effectiveness 
among women with CF initiating or continuing a contraceptive method.
RESULTS: Seven studies met our inclusion criteria. Three observational studies 
of fair to poor quality suggest that use of oral contraceptives (OCs) does not 
negatively impact CF disease severity, defined as changes in pulmonary function, 
number of exacerbations or need for intravenous antibiotics. Three small studies 
of poor quality reported on contraceptive failure among women with CF using 
combined hormonal contraceptives (combined OCs, patch or ring). One pregnancy 
was reported in a patch user out of 43 hormonal contraceptive users across all 
studies. One pharmacokinetic study reported that women with CF achieve steroid 
hormone plasma concentrations similar to healthy women after ingestion of 
combined OCs.
CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence suggests that hormonal contraceptive use does not 
negatively impact disease severity among women with CF and that hormonal 
contraceptive effectiveness is not impaired by CF. Studies were limited by small 
sample sizes and short duration of follow-up. No studies examined the effect of 
hormonal contraception on thrombosis or bone health among women with CF.

The story of a unique molecule in hemophilia A: recombinant single-chain factor 
VIII.

Vienna, Vienna, Austria. Electronic address: Ingrid.pabinger@meduniwien.ac.at.

For patients with hemophilia A, replacement of deficient factor VIII (FVIII) 
using plasma-derived or recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) products to restore 
hemostatic control can reduce bleeding complications and preserve 
musculoskeletal function. Despite the clinical availability of several of these 
products, challenges remain in the treatment of hemophilia A, the most notable 
of which are the risk of inhibitor development and the limited half-life of 
existing FVIII concentrates, which can make prophylaxis burdensome for patients. 
The use of recombinant protein technology may lead to novel FVIII products with 
improved properties. This article describes the story of a unique recombinant 
FVIII protein, rVIII-SingleChain, which is currently in development. In contrast 
to native FVIII and other commercially available rFVIII preparations, 
rVIII-SingleChain uses a strong, covalent bond to connect the light and heavy 
chains, thereby creating a stable, single-chain rFVIII. It has enhanced 
intrinsic stability, better integrity after reconstitution, and a higher binding 
affinity to von Willebrand factor. The physicochemical profile of 
rVIII-SingleChain and preclinical data on its activity and phamacokinetics 
strengthened the rationale for its clinical investigation. Available data from 
the AFFINITY clinical trial program are promising; indicating that it has good 
hemostatic efficacy when used on demand, for prophylaxis, and in the surgical 
setting, and is also very well tolerated. A pediatric study and an extension 
study are ongoing as part of the AFFINITY program.

Entering new areas in known fields: recombinant fusion protein linking 
recombinant factor VIIa with recombinant albumin (rVIIa-FP) - advancing the

The novel fusion protein linking recombinant factor VIIa with recombinant 
albumin (rVIIa-FP) is designed to extend the half-life of recombinant factor 
VIIa (rFVIIa) and improve the care of hemophilia A or B patients with 
inhibitors. Preclinical studies in various animal models have demonstrated 
markedly improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, as well as 
prolonged retention in the joint tissues, of rVIIa-FP compared with a 
commercially available rFVIIa (NovoSeven®). A phase I study in healthy 
volunteers - the first study in the PROLONG-7FP program - confirmed that 
rVIIa-FP has a good tolerability profile in doses of up to 1,000μg/kg and has 
demonstrated enhanced pharmacodynamic activity relative to rFVIIa. The half-life 
of rVIIa-FP at the highest dose investigated in the study was 8.5hours, which 
represents a 3- to 4-fold half-life extension compared with rFVIIa. Encouraging 
results from preclinical and phase I studies have led to the initiation of 
clinical studies of rVIIa-FP in patients with congenital hemophilia A or B and 
inhibitors, and in patients with confirmed factor VII deficiency. The results 
from these studies are awaited with interest by clinicians and patients alike.

Down syndrome (DS) is the most diffused genetic cause of intellectual disability 
and, after the age of forty, is invariantly associated with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). In the last years, the prolongation of life expectancy in people with DS 
renders the need for intervention paradigms aimed at improving mental disability 
and counteracting AD pathology particularly urgent. At present, however, there 
are no effective therapeutic strategies for DS and concomitant AD in mid-life 
people. The most intensively studied mouse model of DS is the Ts65Dn line, which 
summarizes the main hallmarks of the DS phenotype, included severe learning and 
memory deficits and age-dependent AD-like pathology. Here we report for the 
first time that middle-age Ts65Dn mice display a marked increase in soluble Aβ 
oligomer levels in their hippocampus. Moreover, we found that long-term exposure 
to environmental enrichment (EE), a widely used paradigm that increases 
sensory-motor stimulation, reduces Aβ oligomers and rescues spatial memory 
abilities in trisomic mice. Our findings underscore the potential of EE 
procedures as a non-invasive paradigm for counteracting brain aging processes in 
DS subjects.

Cancer may be a complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or its 
treatments. In older Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients, the risk 
of malignancy is of particular concern. IBD diagnosis at an advanced age is 
associated with earlier development of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. 
Thiopurine use in older IBD patients is tied to an increased risk of 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and urinary tract cancers. 
Additionally, older age is accompanied by multimorbidity, an increased risk of 
malnutrition, and decreased life expectancy, factors that complicate the 
management of cancer in the elderly. The optimal approach to the increased risk 
of malignancy in older age IBD is appropriate cancer screening and medical 
treatment. This may include age-specific colorectal cancer screening and 
limiting UV radiation exposure. With a growing number of older IBD patients, 
further studies are necessary to delineate the risk of cancer in this 
population.

Cribra orbitalia (CO), or porotic hyperostosis (PH) of the orbital roof, is one 
of the most common pathological conditions found in archaeological subadult 
skeletal remains. Reaching frequencies higher than 50% in many prehistoric 
samples, CO has been generally attributed to a variety of factors including 
malnutrition (e.g., megaloblastic anemia) and parasitism. In this study, we 
tested the relationship between CO, trace element concentrations, and stable 
isotope values (δ13C, δ15N, δ18O) in subadult skeletons from a 17th to 18th 
century cemetery in the historic town of Jēkabpils, Latvia. A total of 28 
subadults were examined, seven of which (25%) showed evidence of CO. 
Bioarchaeological evidence indicated high mortality for children in this 
cemetery: half of the burials were subadults under the age of 14, while a third 
were under the age of four. Life expectancy at birth was estimated to have been 
only 21.6 years. Trace element concentrations measured by Inductively Coupled 
Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) showed no relationship between presence or 
absence of CO and levels of manganese, zinc, strontium, barium, copper, cadmium, 
or lead in the bones (p>0.05). However, a significant correlation (p<0.05) was 
found between the presence of CO and decreased levels of iron. The correlations 
between CO and decreased levels of copper and lead approached significance 
(p=0.056 for both elements). Individuals with CO furthermore displayed 
significantly lower δ15N isotope values, suggesting greater consumption of lower 
trophic level food resources than those unaffected by CO; δ13C and δ18O values, 
in contrast, showed no significant differences. These results suggest that the 
prevalence of CO may be related to dietary deficiencies. In this case, low iron 
levels may also signify a diet low in other key vitamins (e.g., B9 and B12), 
which are known to cause megaloblastic anemia.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
manufacturer of vortioxetine (Lundbeck) to submit clinical and 
cost-effectiveness evidence for vortioxetine for the treatment of major 
depressive episodes (MDEs), as part of the Institute's Single Technology 
Appraisal (STA) process. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for 
Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the 
independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of 
the company submission, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance TA367 
issued in November 2015. The ERG critically reviewed the evidence presented in 
the manufacturer's submission and identified areas requiring clarification, for 
which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. Two phase III randomised 
controlled trials for a second-line population involving vortioxetine were 
identified-REVIVE and TAK318. These two trials represent only 972 of over 7000 
patients included in trials of vortioxetine. In REVIVE, there was a 
statistically significant difference in depression scores favouring vortioxetine 
compared with agomelatine [mean Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale 
(MADRS) score difference of 2.16 points; 95 % confidence interval 0.81-3.51]. 
The ERG concluded that, based on all the evidence, rather than the substantially 
restricted subset of evidence originally considered by the manufacturer, 
vortioxetine is likely to be similar in efficacy to other analysed 
antidepressants [citalopram, sertraline, escitalopram and venlafaxine extended 
release (XR)], and may be more efficacious than agomelatine and inferior to 
duloxetine. The ERG concluded that vortioxetine may be more tolerable than other 
analysed antidepressants (sertraline, venlafaxine XR and bupropion), although 
the limited data prevent firm conclusions. The base-case incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vortioxetine reported by the manufacturer was 
£378 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with venlafaxine. Given 
considerable concerns about the indirect treatment comparison undertaken by the 
manufacturer, the use of only a restrictive subset of the available evidence, 
and concerns regarding comparators and structural model assumptions, the ERG 
believes that this is not a valid estimate of the cost effectiveness of 
vortioxetine. Following corrections made to the model made by the ERG, the 
estimated cost effectiveness of vortioxetine was sensitive to the source of 
evidence used, in addition to whether certain comparators were excluded. The 
NICE thus asked the manufacturer to provide a revised economic model, which 
incorporated the broader evidence base and considered the cost effectiveness of 
vortioxetine as a third-line treatment. Assuming equal efficacy, vortioxetine 
was shown to be less costly and generate a higher QALY gain than relevant 
comparators at the third-line of treatment owing to its tolerability and adverse 
event profile. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended vortioxetine as an 
option for treating MDEs in adults whose condition has responded inadequately to 
two antidepressants within the current episode.

BACKGROUND: Vaccination has been one of the most successful and cost-effective 
public health interventions in the last century and has saved millions of lives. 
In 1984, the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) was launched in Iran as one 
of the main components of Primary Health Care (PHC). 
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the burden of four vaccine-preventable 
diseases from 1990 to 2010 in Iran.
METHODS: GBD study 2010 includes death rates, Years of Life Lost (YLLs), Years 
Lived with Disability (YLDs) and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). YLLs is 
calculated through multiplying the number of deaths in each age group by a 
reference life expectancy for the same age group, while YLDs can be obtained 
from the prevalence of a disease multiplied by the disability weight (DW) for 
the same disease. The sum of these two indices yields DALYs. In the present 
study, we tried to produce new graphs and explain more about Iran results.  We 
also describe the GBD study limitations.
RESULTS: Regardless of gender differences, DALYs rates for measles at all ages 
were 86.1220 and 5.5703 per 100 000 in 1990 and 2010, respectively, indicating 
approximately 94% decrease in this disease. The maximum and minimum rates of 
deaths from whooping cough for males aged under 5 was 4.0674 and 0.2713 per 100 
000 in 1990 and 2000, respectively, which shows 93% decline in whooping cough 
from in this period.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that vaccination has had a positive impact 
on the control of communicable diseases. But the results of this study have some 
limitations similar to GBD study which may pave the way for decision makers 
about other public health interventions. Moreover, since measuring the impact of 
various diseases on health plays an important role in public health, it can be 
an important step toward prioritization in health.

Vertebral Augmentation Involving Vertebroplasty or Kyphoplasty for 
Cancer-Related Vertebral Compression Fractures: An Economic Analysis.

Health Quality Ontario.

BACKGROUND: Untreated vertebral compression fractures can have serious clinical 
consequences and impose a considerable impact on patients' quality of life and 
on caregivers. Since non-surgical management of these fractures has limited 
effectiveness, vertebral augmentation procedures are gaining acceptance in 
clinical practice for pain control and fracture stabilization. The objective of 
this analysis was to determine the cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of 
kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty compared with non-surgical management for the 
treatment of vertebral compression fractures in patients with cancer.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of health economic studies to identify 
relevant studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of kyphoplasty or 
vertebroplasty with non-surgical management for the treatment of vertebral 
compression fractures in adults with cancer. We also performed a primary 
cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the clinical benefits and costs of 
kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty compared with non-surgical management in the same 
population. We developed a Markov model to forecast benefits and harms of 
treatments, and corresponding quality-adjusted life years and costs. Clinical 
data and utility data were derived from published sources, while costing data 
were derived using Ontario administrative sources. We performed sensitivity 
analyses to examine the robustness of the results. In addition, a 1-year budget 
impact analysis was performed using data from Ontario administrative sources. 
Two scenarios were explored: (a) an increase in the total number of vertebral 
augmentation procedures performed among patients with cancer in Ontario, 
maintaining the current proportion of kyphoplasty versus vertebroplasty; and (b) 
no increase in the total number of vertebral augmentation procedures performed 
among patients with cancer in Ontario but an increase in the proportion of 
kyphoplasties versus vertebroplasties.
RESULTS: The base case considered each of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty versus 
non-surgical management. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty were associated with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $33,471 and $17,870, respectively, per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained. The budgetary impact of funding vertebral 
augmentation procedures for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures in 
adults with cancer in Ontario was estimated at about $2.5 million in fiscal year 
2014/15. More widespread use of vertebral augmentation procedures raised total 
expenditures under a number of scenarios, with costs increasing by $67,302 to 
$913,386.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the use of kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty 
in the management of vertebral compression fractures in patients with cancer may 
be a cost-effective strategy at commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds. 
Nonetheless, more widespread use of kyphoplasty (and vertebroplasty to a lesser 
extent) would likely be associated with net increases in health care costs.

Osteoporosis affects a substantial proportion of patients with chronic liver 
disease. Pathologic fracture in osteoporosis significantly affects quality of 
life and life expectancy. By some estimates, 40% of patients with chronic liver 
disease may experience osteoporotic fracture. In this study we review the 
pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of specific liver disease entities and 
their relation to osteoporosis.

Conservation biology integrates multiple disciplines to expand the ability to 
identify threats to populations and develop mitigation for these threats. Road 
ecology is a branch of conservation biology that examines interactions between 
wildlife and roadways. Although the direct threats of road mortality and habitat 
fragmentation posed by roads have received much attention, a clear understanding 
of the indirect physiological effects of roads on wildlife is lacking. Chronic 
physiological stress can lower immune function, affect reproductive rates and 
reduce life expectancy; thus, it has the potential to induce long-lasting 
effects on populations. Reptiles are globally in decline, and roads are known to 
have negative effects on reptile populations; however, it is unknown whether 
individual responses to roads and traffic result in chronic stress that creates 
an additional threat to population viability. We successfully extracted reliable 
measures of corticosterone (CORT), a known, commonly used biomarker for 
physiological stress, from claw trimmings from painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) 
captured at three study sites (road-impacted site, control site and validation 
site). Corticosterone levels in claws were evaluated as a measure of chronic 
stress in turtles because CORT is deposited during growth of the claw and could 
provide an opportunity to examine past long-term stress levels. While male 
turtles had higher CORT levels on average than females, there was no difference 
in the level of CORT between the road-impacted and control site, nor was there a 
relationship between CORT and turtle body condition. In validating a novel 
approach for non-invasive measurement of long-term CORT levels in a keratinized 
tissue in wild reptiles, our study provides a new avenue for research in the 
field of stress physiology.

BACKGROUND: The highest incidence of lung cancer is seen in North America and 
the lowest incidence in central Africa. Socioeconomic factors of inequality 
reflect regional disparities in human development. Due to the importance of 
awareness about incidence and mortality of lung cancer in health programming and 
the possible role of the human development index (HDI), this study was done with 
the aim to investigate the epidemiology of lung cancer in the world and its 
relationship with HDI.
METHODS: The study was conducted based on data from the world data of cancer and 
the World Bank (including the HDI and its components). Data about the 
age-specific incidence and mortality rate (ASR) for every country in 2012 were 
getting from the global cancer project. To analyze data, correlation tests 
between incidence and death rates, and HDI and its components were employed with 
a significance level of 0.05 using SPSS software.
RESULTS: Lung cancer with standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and standardized 
mortality rate (ASMR), equal to 23.1 and 19.7 (in 100,000 people), respectively. 
The highest and lowest values of mortality incidence ratio (MIR) for lung cancer 
due to continents division were 0.93 and 0.71 for Eastern Africa and 
Australia/New Zealand, respectively. Univariate analysis showed significant 
relationship (P<0.0001) between ASIR and ASMR with life expectancy at birth and 
mean years of schooling.
CONCLUSIONS: The highest MIR for lung cancer was for medium human development 
countries. Linear regression analysis showed a reverse significant relationship 
between MIR and HDI.

Earlier studies suggest that lumbar radicular pain following disc herniation may 
be associated with a local or systemic inflammatory process. In the present 
study, we investigated the serum inflammatory protein profile of such patients. 
All 45 patients were recruited from Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål, Norway, 
during the period 2007-2009. The new multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA) 
technology was used to analyze the levels of 92 proteins. Interestingly, the 
present data showed that patients with radicular pain 12 months after disc 
herniation may be different from other patients with regard to many measurable 
serum cytokines. Given a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.10 and 0.05, we 
identified 41 and 13 proteins, respectively, which were significantly 
upregulated in the patients with severe pain one year after disc herniation. On 
the top of the list ranked by estimated increase we found C-X-C motif chemokine 
5 (CXCM5; 217% increase), epidermal growth factor (EGF; 142% increase), and 
monocyte chemotactic protein 4 (MCP-4; 70% increase). Moreover, a clear overall 
difference in the serum cytokine profile between the chronic and the recovered 
patients was demonstrated. Thus, the present results may be important for future 
protein serum profiling of lumbar radicular pain patients with regard to 
prognosis and choice of treatment. We conclude that serum proteins may be 
measurable molecular markers of persistent pain after disc herniation.

The health of an organism is orchestrated by a multitude of molecular and 
biochemical networks responsible for ensuring homeostasis within cells and 
tissues. However, upon aging, a progressive failure in the maintenance of this 
homeostatic balance occurs in response to a variety of endogenous and 
environmental stresses, allowing the accumulation of damage, the physiological 
decline of individual tissues, and susceptibility to diseases. What are the 
molecular and cellular signaling events that control the aging process and how 
can this knowledge help design therapeutic strategies to combat age-associated 
diseases? Here we provide a comprehensive overview of the evolutionarily 
conserved biological processes that alter the rate of aging and discuss their 
link to disease prevention and the extension of healthy life span.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the morbidity rate due to 
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in the Polish population during 2008-2012, calculated 
per 1,000 inhabitants, and taking into account the differences between 
provincess, area of residence (urban or rural) and gender.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: From the NFZ IT systems, PESEL number information was 
obtained for all 17 types of services contracted in 2008-2012, for patients 
whose main diagnosis in the report was the ICD-10 disease code: M05.X - 
seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, or M06.X - other rheumatoid arthritis. The 
number of patients, gender and age were calculated based on the PESEL number 
provided in the statistical reports of the patient with the analysed ICD-10 
diagnosis. Urban and rural cases were compared using commune zip codes. The 
basis for classifying the patient as a member of an urban or rural population 
was the Zip Code of the declared place of residence. Urban and rural areas are 
classified based on administrative criteria provided by the Central Statistical 
Office: the National Official Register of Territorial Division of the Country 
(TERYT).
RESULTS: During the studied period the number of RA patients increased from 
173,844-230,892. In urban areas, the most patients were recorded in the Śląskie 
Province, the least in Lubuskie Province. Patients from rural areas were approx. 
1/3(rd) of the total population of patients in Poland. In rural areas, the most 
patients were recorded in the Mazowieckie Province, the least in Lubuskie 
Province. The morbidity rate in cities was 5.08 in 2008 and increased to 8.14 in
