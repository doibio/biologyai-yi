OBJECTIVES: Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy is an effective but expensive 
therapy for acute ischaemic stroke with proximal anterior circulation occlusion. 
This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy 
in China, which is the largest developing country.
DESIGN: A combination of decision tree and Markov model was developed. Outcome 
and cost data were derived from the published literature and claims database. 
The efficacy data were derived from the meta-analyses of nine trials. One-way 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed in order to assess the 
uncertainty of the results.
SETTING: Hospitals in China.
PARTICIPANTS: The patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by proximal 
anterior circulation occlusion within 6 hours.
INTERVENTIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours with intravenous tissue 
plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment within 4.5 hours versus intravenous tPA 
treatment alone.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The benefit conferred by the treatment was assessed by 
estimating the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in the long 
term (30 years).
RESULTS: The addition of mechanical thrombectomy to intravenous tPA treatment 
compared with standard treatment alone yielded a lifetime gain of 0.794 QALYs at 
an additional cost of CNY 50 000 (US$7700), resulting in a cost of CNY 63 010 
(US$9690) per QALY gained. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that 
mechanical thrombectomy was cost-effective in 99.9% of the simulation runs at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of CNY 125 700 (US$19 300) per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke caused by 
proximal anterior circulation occlusion within 6 hours was cost-effective in 
China. The data may be used as a reference with regard to medical resources 
allocation for stroke treatment in low-income and middle-income countries as 
well as in the remote areas in the developed countries.

Life expectancy of crab-eating foxes in captivity is approximately 11 years, 
which favours the development of diseases including orthopaedic disorders. 
However, to understand disorders that may affect these animals, it is worth 
determining a normal range of measurements. Therefore, this study aimed to 
evaluate radiographic measurements of joint angles of the hindlimbs and the 
ratio of patellar ligament length to patellar length in healthy crab-eating 
foxes. Fifteen captive crab-eating foxes (Cerdocyon thous), eight males and 
seven females, aged more than 1 year old, weighing 5.5-7.9 kg were used. 
Anatomic and mechanical femoral joint angles were assessed in ventrodorsal 
radiographic views, and mediolateral views were taken to measure patellar 
ligament length and patellar length, and the tibial plateau angle. The right and 
left hindlimbs were evaluated. All measurements were conducted in triplicate by 
the same investigator. No statistically significant differences were observed 
between sides in the radiographic measurements. The anatomic lateral proximal 
femoral angle and the anatomic lateral distal femoral angle recorded mean values 
of 95.43° and 92.75°, respectively. The mechanical lateral proximal femoral 
angle and the mechanical lateral distal femoral angle recorded mean values of 
93.39° and 96.75°, respectively. Inclination angles measured according to the 
Tomlinson, Hauptman A and Hauptman B methods were 133.80°, 147.32° and 128.63°, 
respectively. The tibial plateau recorded 18.77°, and the ratio of the patellar 
ligament length to the patellar length was 1.99. In conclusion, the collected 
data are important to characterize the normal values of crab-eating fox limbs.

Background Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) continues to gain 
popularity in the management of patients with severe aortic stenosis (SAS). 
Distribution of resources to maximise appropriate use remains a priority. Design 
& methods To determine the current perceptions and behaviours regarding SAS 
patient management, an 18-point multiple-choice questionnaire was distributed to 
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Council for Cardiology Practice (CCP) 
e-journal and/or electronic newsletter subscribers. Respondents to all questions 
were considered. Sub-analyses based on respondent age, practice setting and 
geographical location were performed. Results Of 1245 full respondents, 41.5% 
were aged ≥ 51 years, 22.7% were aged 41-50 years and 35.8% were aged ≤ 40 
years. The majority were located in Europe (77.5%), followed by Asia/Oceania 
(11.6%), America (7.6%) and Africa (3.4%). In-hospital and out-of-hospital 
cardiologists accounted for 57.4% of and 28.5% of the sample, respectively, with 
the remainder being general practitioners/other. The majority of respondents 
(70.1%) claimed to diagnose between one and five cases of SAS per month. Free 
access to TAVI was reported by 41.2%, being less common for those aged ≤ 40 
years (32.7%; p < 0.001), those located in Asia/Oceania, America and Africa 
(20.1%, 18.1% and 2.4%, respectively; p < 0.01 in each case) and in-hospital 
compared to out-of-hospital cardiologists (35.7% vs. 54.5%, respectively; 
p < 0.001). The most common reason for not referring a patient for an aortic 
valve intervention was assessment that the patient was high risk/non-operable 
(55.5%), followed by short life expectancy (30.5%). The most common reason for 
referring a patient for TAVI over surgical replacement was surgical risk score 
(56.9%). The most commonly perceived main complication of TAVI was stroke 
(28.9%), while the most frequently selected main benefit was improvement in 
quality of life (37.2%). A high proportion (82.5%) of respondents believed that 
TAVI is/may become a viable option for lower-risk SAS patients in future. 
Conclusion The population of potential TAVI is significant worldwide, with key 
barriers to referral being access limitations and poor physician education. 
Strategies to minimise these factors are paramount.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the fourth most diffuse cause of death in the 
world and local recurrence is associated with a reduced long-term life 
expectancy, with a reduced quality of life. Rectal washout at the anastomosis 
site leads to a statistically significant reduction of local recurrences.
METHODS: We developed the idea of a new laparoscopic stapler with an integrated 
washout system that could decontaminate the rectal stump before resection, 
without the need to enlarge the standard surgical incision or even to distort 
the incision site, closing the rectal stump just below the inferior part of the 
cancer, and then proceeding with the resection and stapling of the distal part 
of the tumor. Combined with these canonical functionalities, the new device, 
equipped with a patented washout system (patent number EP 3103401A1) will also 
allow to inject in the closed bowel a physiologic saline liquid.
RESULTS: In force of the mechanical action of the liquid injected, carcinogenic 
exfoliated cells eventually floating in the affected region of the colonic lumen 
will be expelled through the anal orifice. The intraoperative rectal washout, 
both in minimally invasive and in traditional open surgery, thus becomes a 
simple, effective, and reproducible procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe the technical features and the possible clinical 
applications of a potentially new surgical laparoscopic stapler coupled with an 
integrated irrigation system. We have patented the system and we are developing 
a prototype with the aim to start an experimental pilot study.

OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into the most suitable foreign value set among 
Malaysian, Singaporean, Thai, and UK value sets for calculating the EuroQol 
five-dimensional questionnaire index score (utility) among patients with 
cervical cancer in Indonesia.
METHODS: Data from 87 patients with cervical cancer recruited from a referral 
hospital in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia, from an earlier study of 
health-related quality of life were used in this study. The differences among 
the utility scores derived from the four value sets were determined using the 
Friedman test. Performance of the psychometric properties of the four value sets 
versus visual analogue scale (VAS) was assessed. Intraclass correlation 
coefficients and Bland-Altman plots were used to test the agreement among the 
utility scores. Spearman ρ correlation coefficients were used to assess 
convergent validity between utility scores and patients' sociodemographic and 
clinical characteristics. With respect to known-group validity, the 
Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine the differences in utility according to 
the stages of cancer.
RESULTS: There was significant difference among utility scores derived from the 
four value sets, among which the Malaysian value set yielded higher utility than 
the other three value sets. Utility obtained from the Malaysian value set had 
more agreements with VAS than the other value sets versus VAS (intraclass 
correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plot tests results). As for the 
validity, the four value sets showed equivalent psychometric properties as those 
that resulted from convergent and known-group validity tests.
CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of an Indonesian value set, the Malaysian value set 
was more preferable to be used compared with the other value sets. Further 
studies on the development of an Indonesian value set need to be conducted.

Pathom, Thailand. Electronic address: PONGMESA_T@su.ac.th.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the health-related quality of life and functional ability 
of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Thai EuroQol 
five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) and the Thai Health Assessment 
Questionnaire (HAQ), and to analyze correlations between the scores from both 
questionnaires.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 221 patients with RA 
aged 18 years or older at a tertiary care hospital in Thailand. Data collection 
methods included individual patient interviews and data gathering from medical 
records. The correlations between the EQ-5D and HAQ scores were analyzed using 
Spearman's rank correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: Most patients were female (78.3%), aged 41 to 60 years (57.0%), having 
had RA for 12 to 60 months (43.0%), and being in an active disease state 
(60.6%). From the EQ-5D, most patients reported no problems in each dimension, 
except for mobility and pain/discomfort. For the HAQ, most patients reported no 
difficulty for almost all activities, except for arising. The medians 
(interquartile ranges) for the EQ-5D utility, EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ 
VAS), and HAQ scores were 0.65 (0.55-0.73), 70 (50-80), and 0.25 (0.00-0.81), 
respectively. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were 0.42 for the 
EQ-5D utility and EQ VAS scores (P = 0.01), -0.65 for the EQ-5D utility and HAQ 
scores (P < 0.001), and -0.39 for the EQ VAS and HAQ scores (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The health-related quality of life and functional ability of most 
patients in our study were partially affected by the disease. The EQ-5D and HAQ 
scores significantly correlated at a moderate to strong level.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between racial residential segregation, a 
prominent manifestation of systemic racism, and the White-Black survival gap in 
a contemporary cohort of adults, and to assess the extent to which socioeconomic 
inequality explains this association.
DESIGN: This was a cross sectional study of White and Black men and women aged 
35-75 living in 102 large US Core Based Statistical Areas. The main outcome was 
the White-Black survival gap. We used 2009-2013 CDC mortality data for Black and 
White men and women to calculate age-, sex- and race adjusted White and Black 
mortality rates. We measured segregation using the Dissimilarity index, obtained 
from the Manhattan Institute. We used the 2009-2013 American Community Survey to 
define indicators of socioeconomic inequality. We estimated the CBSA-level 
White-Black gap in probability of survival using sequential linear regression 
models accounting for the CBSA dissimilarity index and race-specific 
socioeconomic indicators.
RESULTS: Black men and women had a 14% and 9% lower probability of survival from 
age 35 to 75 than their white counterparts. Residential segregation was strongly 
associated with the survival gap, and this relationship was partly, but not 
fully, explained by socioeconomic inequality. At the lowest observed level of 
segregation, and with the Black socioeconomic status (SES) assumed to be at the 
White SES level scenario, the survival gap is essentially eliminated.
CONCLUSION: White-Black differences in survival remain wide notwithstanding 
public health efforts to improve life expectancy and initiatives to reduce 
health disparities. Eliminating racial residential segregation and bringing 
Black socioeconomic status (SES) to White SES levels would eliminate the 
White-Black survival gap.

INTRODUCTION: The PFMR® proximal femoral modular reconstruction implant (Protek, 
Sulzer Orthopedics, Switzerland) is a straight modular stem in sanded titanium 
with press-fit anchorage, intended to achieve spontaneous bone reconstruction 
following Wagner's principle. The aim of the present study was to analyze 
long-term clinical and radiological outcome.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A single-center retrospective study included 48 PFMR stems 
implanted in 47 patients between 1998 and 2002. Results in this series were 
previously reported at 7 years' follow-up. Clinical assessment used PMA and 
Harris scores. Radiologic assessment focused on stem stability and 
osseointegration, and bone stock following Le Béguec.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were seen at a mean 14.5 years' follow-up (13 
deceased, 11 lost to follow-up), including 1 with bilateral implants, i.e., 24 
stems. PMA and Harris scores, stem stability and osseointegration and bone stock 
were stable with respect to the 7-year findings. Radiology found 7 stem 
fractures in the Morse taper, i.e., in 29% of implants. Two of these cases 
required femoral implant replacement; 5 were asymptomatic.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Long-term outcome for PFMR stems was clinically and 
radiologically satisfactory for the 16 patients free of mechanical 
complications. The Morse taper fracture rate was high, and higher than reported 
elsewhere. The usual risk factors for implant fracture were not found in the 
present series. The modular design of the press-fit revision implant is its weak 
point; monoblock implants should be used in patients with good life-expectancy.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV (retrospective study).

BACKGROUND: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a skin disease with itchy 
hives and/or angio-oedema that last for at least 6 weeks without an obvious 
external trigger.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab relative to 
standard of care (SoC; up to four times the daily dose of H1 -antihistamines) in 
the Netherlands from a societal perspective.
METHODS: The Markov model used consisted of five health states based on 
Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days. Model settings and characteristics of the 
Dutch patient population were based on an online survey among clinical experts 
and were validated during an expert committee meeting. Transition probabilities 
were derived from the GLACIAL trial. Healthcare consumption, quality of life 
(using EuroQol-5D) and productivity losses were derived from a burden-of-illness 
study (ASSURE-CSU) among 93 Dutch patients. Healthcare consumption and 
productivity losses were evaluated using the Dutch costing manual. The 
comparator treatment was SoC, consisting of (updosed) antihistamines. A 10-year 
time horizon was used.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of omalizumab vs. SoC 
was €17 502 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Productivity costs 
played an important role in the value of the ICER; discarding productivity costs 
resulted in an ICER of €85 310 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Omalizumab is cost-effective compared with SoC. The outcomes of 
this study were used to establish omalizumab as third-line therapy in the Dutch 
treatment guidelines for CSU.

Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is as a potential zoonotic agent with a wide 
host range. Here, applying gene splicing by overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR), we 
describe a simple method for producing single-chain variable fragment (scFv) 
antibody against EMCV that configurates in the orientation of VH-(GGGGS)4 -VL. 
DNA template was resverse transcribed by total RNA that derived from 
hyperimmunized antibody positive mice spleen after inoculation inactivated 
EMCV-PV21 as antigen. Using the degenerate primers designed for the variable 
regions of IgG of murine antibody, the 417 bp of gene encoding VH-linker (VHL) 
and 360 bp of gene encoding linker-VL (LVL) of the anti-EMCV was individually 
amplified from DNA template by PCR, repectively. The 762 bp gene encoding 
anti-EMCV scFv was constructed by SOE-PCR when the mixed VHL and LVL genes were 
used as the template. The amplified gene subcloned into pGEX-6P1 to yield 
pGEX-6P1/EMCV-scFv. Recombinant vector transformed into the Escherichia coli 
BL21 (DE3) and a 53 KDa GST-scFv fusion protein was obtained by SDS-PAGE 
electrophoresis. Animal experiment results showed that the pretective rate of 
mice in group A which challenged 500 μL 104 TCID50 EMCV per mouse for 7 d 
post-inoculation scFv 3 d (0.5 mg purified recombinant scFv per mouse) was 
91.67% (11/12). The serum anti-EMCV antibody titer in group A mice was most 
significantly higher than that in positive control mouse (P < 0.01), coversely 
the serum relative mRNA copies were significantly lower than that in positive 
control mouse (P < 0.05). These findings indicated that recombinant anti-EMCV 
scFv has remarkable anti-EMCV effect in mice.

OBJECTIVE: To examine how frequently patients report that their urologist 
recommended forgoing definitive treatment and assess the impact of these 
recommendations on treatment choice and perceived quality of cancer care.
METHODS: We mailed surveys to men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer 
between 2014 and 2015 (adjusted response rate of 51.3%). Men reported whether 
their urologist recommended forgoing definitive treatment. Using logistic 
regression models, we assessed patient-level predictors of receiving a 
recommendation to forgo definitive treatment and estimated associations of 
receiving this recommendation with receipt of definitive treatment and perceived 
quality of cancer care among men with low-risk tumors and limited life 
expectancies.
RESULTS: Nearly two-thirds (62.2%) of men with low-risk tumors and 46.4% with 
limited life expectancies received recommendations from their urologists to 
forgo definitive treatment. Among men with limited life expectancies, those with 
low-risk tumors were more likely to receive this recommendation compared with 
men with high-risk tumors (odds ratio [OR] 3.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
2.17-5.37). Men with low-risk tumors who were recommended to forgo definitive 
treatment were less likely to receive definitive treatment (OR 0.48; 95% CI 
0.32-0.73) but did not report lower perceived quality of care (OR 0.97; 95% CI 
0.63-1.48).
CONCLUSION: In this population-based study, a majority of men with low-risk 
prostate cancer report receiving recommendations from their urologists to forgo 
definitive treatment. Our results suggest that urologists have a strong 
influence on patient treatment choice and could increase active surveillance 
uptake in men eligible for expectant management without patients perceiving 
lower quality of cancer care.

The third section of our Special Task Force report identifies and defines a 
series of elements that warrant consideration in value assessments of medical 
technologies. We aim to broaden the view of what constitutes value in health 
care and to spur new research on incorporating additional elements of value into 
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). Twelve potential elements of value are 
considered. Four of them-quality-adjusted life-years, net costs, productivity, 
and adherence-improving factors-are conventionally included or considered in 
value assessments. Eight others, which would be more novel in economic 
assessments, are defined and discussed: reduction in uncertainty, fear of 
contagion, insurance value, severity of disease, value of hope, real option 
value, equity, and scientific spillovers. Most of these are theoretically well 
understood and available for inclusion in value assessments. The two exceptions 
are equity and scientific spillover effects, which require more theoretical 
development and consensus. A number of regulatory authorities around the globe 
have shown interest in some of these novel elements. Augmenting CEA to consider 
these additional elements would result in a more comprehensive CEA in line with 
the "impact inventory" of the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and 
Medicine. Possible approaches for valuation and inclusion of these elements 
include integrating them as part of a net monetary benefit calculation, 
including elements as attributes in health state descriptions, or using them as 
criteria in a multicriteria decision analysis. Further research is needed on how 
best to measure and include them in decision making.

The fourth section of our Special Task Force report focuses on a health plan or 
payer's technology adoption or reimbursement decision, given the array of 
technologies, on the basis of their different values and costs. We discuss the 
role of budgets, thresholds, opportunity costs, and affordability in making 
decisions. First, we discuss the use of budgets and thresholds in private and 
public health plans, their interdependence, and connection to opportunity cost. 
Essentially, each payer should adopt a decision rule about what is good value 
for money given their budget; consistent use of a cost-per-quality-adjusted 
life-year threshold will ensure the maximum health gain for the budget. In the 
United States, different public and private insurance programs could use 
different thresholds, reflecting the differing generosity of their budgets and 
implying different levels of access to technologies. In addition, different 
insurance plans could consider different additional elements to the 
quality-adjusted life-year metric discussed elsewhere in our Special Task Force 
report. We then define affordability and discuss approaches to deal with it, 
including consideration of disinvestment and related adjustment costs, the 
impact of delaying new technologies, and comparative cost effectiveness of 
technologies. Over time, the availability of new technologies may increase the 
amount that populations want to spend on health care. We then discuss potential 
modifiers to thresholds, including uncertainty about the evidence used in the 
decision-making process. This article concludes by discussing the application of 
these concepts in the context of the pluralistic US health care system, as well 
as the "excess burden" of tax-financed public programs versus private programs.

The fifth section of our Special Task Force report identifies and discusses two 
aggregation issues: 1) aggregation of cost and benefit information across 
individuals to a population level for benefit plan decision making and 2) 
combining multiple elements of value into a single value metric for individuals. 
First, we argue that additional elements could be included in measures of value, 
but such elements have not generally been included in measures of 
quality-adjusted life-years. For example, we describe a recently developed 
extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) that provides a good example of how 
to use a broader concept of utility. ECEA adds two features-measures of 
financial risk protection and income distributional consequences. We then 
discuss a further option for expanding this approach-augmented CEA, which can 
introduce many value measures. Neither of these approaches, however, provide a 
comprehensive measure of value. To resolve this issue, we review a technique 
called multicriteria decision analysis that can provide a comprehensive measure 
of value. We then discuss budget-setting and prioritization using multicriteria 
decision analysis, issues not yet fully resolved. Next, we discuss deliberative 
processes, which represent another important approach for population- or 
plan-level decisions used by many health technology assessment bodies. These use 
quantitative information on CEA and other elements, but the group decisions are 
reached by a deliberative voting process. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of 
stated preference methods for developing "hedonic" value frameworks, and 
conclude with some recommendations in this area.

BACKGROUND: Estimating individual-level medication costs in an economic 
evaluation can involve extensive data collection and handling. Implications of 
detailed versus general approaches are unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To compare costing approaches in a trial-based economic evaluation.
METHODS: We applied four costing approaches to prescribed medication data from 
the Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors Against Combination Intensive Therapy 
randomized controlled trial. A detailed micro-costing approach was used as a 
base case, against which other approaches were compared: costing medications 
used by at least 1.5% of patients; costing medications on the basis of only 
chemical name; applying a generic prescription charge rather than a 
medication-specific cost. We quantitatively examined resulting estimates of 
prescribed medication and total care costs, and qualitatively examined trial 
conclusions.
RESULTS: Medication costs made up 6% of the total health and social care costs. 
There was good agreement in prescribed medication costs (concordance correlation 
coefficient [CCC] 0.815, 0.819, and 0.989) and excellent agreement in total 
costs (CCC 0.990, 0.995, and 0.995) between approaches 1 and 2. Approaches 3 and 
4 had poor agreement with approach 1 on prescribed medication costs (CCC 
0.246-0.700 and 0.033-0.333, respectively), but agreement on total care costs 
remained good (CCC 0.778-0.993 and 0.729-0.986, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Because medication costs comprised only a small proportion of total 
costs, the less resource-intensive approaches had substantial impacts on 
medication cost estimates, but had little impact on total care costs and did not 
significantly impact the trial's cost-effectiveness conclusions. There is room 
for research efficiencies without detriment to an evaluation in which medication 
costs are likely to form a small proportion of total costs.

OBJECTIVES: To assess cost effectiveness of abatacept versus adalimumab, each 
administered with methotrexate, in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) stratified according to baseline anticitrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) 
levels (marker of poor prognosis in RA).
METHODS: A payer-perspective cost-effectiveness model simulated disease 
progression in patients with RA who had previously failed conventional 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and were starting biologic therapy. 
Patients commenced treatment with abatacept or adalimumab plus methotrexate and 
were evaluated after 6 months. Therapy continuation was based on the European 
League Against Rheumatism treatment response; disease progression was based on 
the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score. These score changes 
were used to estimate health state utilities and direct medical costs. 
Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY gained were 
calculated by baseline ACPA groups (Q1, 28-234 AU/ml; Q2, 235-609 AU/ml; Q3, 
613-1045 AU/ml; and Q4, 1060-4894 AU/ml). Scenario analysis and one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate robustness of model 
assumptions.
RESULTS: Abatacept resulted in QALY gain versus adalimumab in ACPA Q1, Q3, and 
Q4; between-treatment difference (difference: Q1, -0.115 Q2, -0.009 Q3, 0.045; 
and Q4, 0.279). Total lifetime discounted cost was higher for abatacept versus 
adalimumab in most quartiles (Q2, £77,612 vs. £77,546; Q3, £74,441 vs. £73,263; 
and Q4, £78,428 vs. £76,696) because of longer time on treatment. Incremental 
cost per QALY for abatacept (vs. adalimumab) was the lowest in the high ACPA 
titer group (Q4, £6200/QALY), followed by the next lowest titer group (Q3, 
£26,272/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Abatacept is a cost effective alternative to adalimumab in patients 
with RA with high ACPA levels.

BACKGROUND: When proven effective, decision making regarding reimbursement of 
new health technology typically involves ethical, social, legal, and health 
economic aspects and constraints. Nevertheless, when applying standard value of 
information (VOI) analysis, the value of collecting additional evidence is 
typically estimated assuming that only cost-effectiveness outcomes guide such 
decisions.
OBJECTIVES: To illustrate how decision makers' constraints can be incorporated 
into VOI analyses and how these may influence VOI outcomes.
METHODS: A simulation study was performed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
a new hypothetical technology compared with usual care. Constraints were defined 
for the new technology on 1) the maximum acceptable rate of complications and 2) 
the maximum acceptable additional budget. The expected value of perfect 
information (EVPI) for the new technology was estimated in various scenarios, 
both with and without incorporating these constraints.
RESULTS: For a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year, the probability that the new technology was cost-effective equaled 
57%, with an EVPI of €1868 per patient. Applying the complication rate 
constraint reduced the EVPI to €1137. Similarly, the EVPI reduced to €770 when 
applying the budget constraint. Applying both constraints simultaneously further 
reduced the EVPI to €318.
CONCLUSIONS: When decision makers explicitly apply additional constraints, 
beyond a willingness-to-pay threshold, to reimbursement decisions, these 
constraints can and should be incorporated into VOI analysis as well, because 
they may influence VOI outcomes. This requires continuous interaction between 
VOI analysts and decision makers and is expected to improve both the relevance 
and the acceptance of VOI outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To identify which specifications and approaches to model selection 
better predict health preferences, the International Academy of Health 
Preference Research (IAHPR) hosted a predictive modeling competition including 
18 teams from around the world.
METHODS: In April 2016, an exploratory survey was fielded: 4074 US respondents 
completed 20 out of 1560 paired comparisons by choosing between two health 
descriptions (e.g., longer life span vs. better health). The exploratory data 
were distributed to all teams. By July, eight teams had submitted their 
predictions for 1600 additional pairs and described their analytical approach. 
After these predictions had been posted online, a confirmatory survey was 
fielded (4148 additional respondents).
RESULTS: The victorious team, "Discreetly Charming Econometricians," led by 
Michał Jakubczyk, achieved the smallest χ2, 4391.54 (a predefined criterion). 
Its primary scientific findings were that different models performed better with 
different pairs, that the value of life span is not constant proportional, and 
that logit models have poor predictive validity in health valuation.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated the diversity and potential of new 
analytical approaches in health preference research and highlighted the 
importance of predictive validity in health valuation.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the heterogeneity in cost-effectiveness analyses of 
patient-tailored complex interventions.
METHODS: Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed on data from a randomized 
controlled trial evaluating a patient-tailored case management strategy for 
patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). LCA was 
conducted on detailed process variables representing service variation in the 
intervention group. Features of the identified latent classes were compared for 
consistency with baseline demographic, clinical, and economic characteristics 
for each class. Classes for the control group, corresponding to the identified 
latent classes for the intervention group, were identified using multinomial 
logistic regression. Cost-utility analyses were then conducted at the class 
level, and uncertainty surrounding the point estimates was assessed by 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The LCA identified three distinct classes: the psychologically care 
class, the extensive COPD care class, and the limited COPD care class. Patient 
baseline characteristics were in line with the features identified in the LCA. 
Evaluation of cost-effectiveness revealed highly disparate results, and case 
management for only the extensive COPD care class appeared cost-effective with 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £26,986 per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained using the threshold value set by the National Institute of 
Health and Care Excellence.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that researchers evaluating patient-tailored 
complex interventions need to address both supply-side variation and demand-side 
heterogeneity to link findings with outcome. The article specifically proposes 
the use of LCA because it is believed to have the potential to enable more 
appropriate targeting of complex care strategies.
