number of patients presenting with bone metastasis and experiencing episodes of 
cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP). CIBP is a crippling, chronic, morbid state 
interfering significantly with the functional capacity and the quality of life 
(QoL). CIBP is characterized by a complex multifactorial pathophysiological 
mechanism involving tumor cells, bone cells, inflammatory microenvironment, and 
the neuronal tissue. It may not be possible to mitigate pain completely; 
therefore, the aim should be to reach the lowest possible level of pain that 
allows for an acceptable QoL to the patient. Multimodality approach of surgical, 
radiation, medical and behavioral techniques is thus recommended to manage CIBP. 
This review discusses the pathogenesis and pathophysiological mechanism 
accompanying bone metastasis and CIBP, currently approved therapies for the 
management of CIBP, and the future perspective.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Cervical Cancer is the 6th most common and 3rd most deadly 
cancer among women. Despite the fact that the majority of the countries in Asia 
and Africa have a similar economy and low life expectancy, the mean 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of cervical cancer is substantially 
higher in Africa than in Asia. This study identified the correlates of the 
higher ASIR rates in Africa relative to Asia against two timelines; 2004-2009 
and 2010-2017.
METHODS: Peer-reviewed articles published between 2004 and 2017 were selected 
using the PRISMA standard. Sources of articles included Google Scholar, Scopus, 
PubMed Central, and EMBASE. Search keywords included: HPV genotypes, cervical 
cancer, HPV vaccine, and multiple infections in Africa and Asia.
RESULT: Twenty-nine and seventeen full-length articles were selected from Africa 
and Asia, respectively. The pooled prevalence of HPV infection up to 2017 was 
higher in Africa (41.8%; 95% CI: 35.9, 47.7) than in Asia (24.2%; 95% CI: 16.22, 
32.2) at p< 0.001. Between 2004-2009 and 2010-2017 timelines, the pooled 
prevalence of HPV infection decreased from 49.1% to 36.7% (OR': 1.66, 95% CI: 
1.51-1.80) in Africa and increased from 16.9% to 20.5% (OR': 0.79, 95% CI: 
0.71-0.86) in Asia. However, the pooled prevalence of multiple HPV infections 
and non-vaccine high-risk HPV infections were higher among African women 
diagnosed with cancer (30.9% and 5.2%) than their Asian counterparts (21.0% and 
2.0%, respectively) at p< 0.001. Additionally, the pooled prevalence of the five 
most prevalent high-risk HPV types in Africa were HPV16 (35.3%), HPV52 (14.2%), 
HPV35 (12.4%), HPV18 (10.4%), and HPV58 (10.0%), while that of Asia were HPV16 
(37.3%), HPV52 (16.2%), HPV58 (14.7%), HPV33 (7.4%) and HPV18 (7.2%).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the higher prevalence of HPV, multiple HPV 
and non-vaccine HPV infections could be responsible for the higher ASIR in 
Africa than in Asia.

BACKGROUND: The silastic tube technique, in which a chest tube is placed into 
the vertebral body defect and impregnated with polymethyl methacrylate, showed 
good results in patients with lumbar and thoracic neoplastic diseases. There has 
been only 1 study about the effectiveness and safety of this technique in 
patients with cervical metastases. We aimed to report our experience in using 
this technique to reconstruct the spine after corpectomy for cervical 
metastasis.
METHODS: All patients with cervical spinal metastasis who underwent surgical 
treatment using a chest tube impregnated with polymethyl methacrylate in 
conjunction with anterior cervical plate stabilization were retrospectively 
recruited. Demographics, tumor histology, revised Tokuhashi score, preoperative 
and postoperative American Spinal Injury Association score, preoperative and 
postoperative ambulatory status, perioperative complications, and survival time 
were collected.
RESULTS: This study included 16 patients. The most common primary tumor site was 
the lung (6 patients; 37.5%). The mean (SD) survival time was 408 (795) days 
(range, 1-2797 days), and the median survival time was 72 days (95% confidence 
interval 28-116 days). Four patients (25%) died within 30 postoperative days. 
There was no surgical site infection or instrument failure after the surgery. 
Five patients (31.2%) lived >180 days, and 3 patients (18.8%) lived >360 days. 
One patient (6.2%) was still alive at the end of the study.
CONCLUSIONS: The silastic tube technique in conjunction with anterior cervical 
plate stabilization might be safe, effective, and cost-effective for patients 
with cervical spine metastasis.

BACKGROUND: Examining the distribution of the burden of different communicable 
and non-communicable diseases and injuries worldwide can present proper evidence 
to global policymakers to deal with health inequality. The present study aimed 
to determine socioeconomic inequality in the burden of 25 groups of diseases 
between countries around the world in 2019.
METHODS: In the current study data according to 204 countries in the world was 
gathered from the Human Development Report and the Global Burden of Diseases 
study. Variables referring to incidence, prevalence, years of life lost (YLL), 
years lived with disability (YLD) and disability adjusted life years (DALY) 
resulting by 25 groups of diseases and injuries also human development index was 
applied for the analysis. For measurement of socioeconomic inequality, 
concentration index (CI) and curve was applied. CI is considered as one of the 
popular measures for inequality measurement. It ranges from - 1 to + 1. A 
positive value implies that a variable is concentrated among the higher 
socioeconomic status population and vice versa.
RESULTS: The findings showed that CI of the incidence, prevalence, YLL, YLD and 
DALY for all causes were - 0.0255, - 0.0035, - 0.1773, 0.0718 and - 0.0973, 
respectively. CI for total Communicable, Maternal, Neonatal, and Nutritional 
Diseases (CMNNDs) incidence, prevalence, YLL, YLD and DALY were estimated as 
- 0.0495, - 0.1355, - 0.5585, - 0.2801 and - 0.5203, respectively. Moreover, 
estimates indicated that CIs of incidence, prevalence, YLL, YLD and DALY for 
Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) were 0.1488, 0.1218, 0.1552, 0.1847 and 0.1669, 
respectively. Regarding injuries, the CIs of incidence, prevalence, YLL, YLD and 
DALY were determined as 0.0212, 0.1364, - 0.1605, 0.1146 and 0.3316, 
respectively. In the CMNNDs group, highest and lowest CI of DALY were related to 
the respiratory infections and tuberculosis (- 0.4291) and neglected tropical 
diseases and malaria (- 0.6872). Regarding NCDs, the highest and lowest CI for 
DALY is determined for neoplasms (0.3192) and other NCDs (- 0.0784). Moreover, 
the maximum and minimum of CI of DALY for injuries group were related to the 
transport injuries (0.0421) and unintentional injuries (- 0.0297).
CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of all-causes and CMNNDs burden were more 
concentrated in low-HDI countries and there are pro-poor inequality. However, 
there is a pro-rich inequality for NCDs' burden i.e. it was concentrated in 
high-HDI countries. On the other hand, the concentration of DALY, YLD, 
prevalence, and incidence in injuries was observed in the countries with higher 
HDI, while YLL was concentrated in low-HDI countries.

BACKGROUND: The acceleration of the epigenetic clock has been associated with a 
reduction in life expectancy. Individuals diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder 
have a reduction in life expectancy, and some studies have correlated it with 
accelerated aging.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to explore whether the presence of any 
psychiatric disorder could accelerate the epigenetic clock in monozygotic twins.
METHODS: A total of 15 pairs of monozygotic twins were included. Epigenetic age 
in peripheral blood cells was estimated by previously published algorithms, 
using the 450K Beadchip microarray.
RESULTS: We found that in twins with a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, the 
epigenetic clock could increase compared to their twin without a psychiatric 
disorder.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The presence of some psychiatric disorder could 
accelerate the epigenetic clock in homozygous twins, but studies with larger 
samples are required to clarify this relationship.

Although there is a large gap between Black and White American life 
expectancies, the gap fell 48.9% between 1990 and 2018, mainly due to mortality 
declines among Black Americans. We examine age-specific mortality trends and 
racial gaps in life expectancy in high- and low-income US areas and with 
reference to six European countries. Inequalities in life expectancy are starker 
in the United States than in Europe. In 1990, White Americans and Europeans in 
high-income areas had similar overall life expectancy, while life expectancy for 
White Americans in low-income areas was lower. However, since then, even 
high-income White Americans have lost ground relative to Europeans. Meanwhile, 
the gap in life expectancy between Black Americans and Europeans decreased by 
8.3%. Black American life expectancy increased more than White American life 
expectancy in all US areas, but improvements in lower-income areas had the 
greatest impact on the racial life expectancy gap. The causes that contributed 
the most to Black Americans' mortality reductions included cancer, homicide, 
HIV, and causes originating in the fetal or infant period. Life expectancy for 
both Black and White Americans plateaued or slightly declined after 2012, but 
this stalling was most evident among Black Americans even prior to the COVID-19 
pandemic. If improvements had continued at the 1990 to 2012 rate, the racial gap 
in life expectancy would have closed by 2036. European life expectancy also 
stalled after 2014. Still, the comparison with Europe suggests that mortality 
rates of both Black and White Americans could fall much further across all ages 
and in both high-income and low-income areas.

Programmed Multi-Level Ventilation: A Strategy for Ventilating Non-Homogenous 
Lungs.

Mechanical ventilation (MV) has been an integral method used in ICU care for 
decades. MV is typically viewed as a life-supporting intervention. However, it 
can also contribute to lung injury through stress and strain, as evidenced by 
ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), even in previously healthy lungs. The 
negative impact may be worsened when significant lung non-homogeneity is 
present, eg. ALI and ARDS. Protective lung strategies to minimize VILI are to 
use low tidal volumes (Vt 4-6 mL/kg/PBW), plateau pressures (Pplat) <30 cmH2O 
and relatively high positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP). Yet, use of 
constantly high PEEP levels is well recognized to result in hemodynamic 
compromise of the right ventricle, increased stress and strain through high 
mechanical energy impact on the lung and overdistension of relatively healthy 
lung tissue. Taking these issues into consideration, a different approach to 
mechanical ventilation was developed specifically for patients with 
non-homogeneity. This review focuses on a feature called programmed multi-level 
ventilation (PMLV). It is not a ventilation mode per se, but rather a form of 
extension that adjusts and modifies any ventilation mode (eg PCV,PSV, VCV, SIMV, 
etc.). PMLV is based on measured time constants (Tau) of the whole respiratory 
system, including artificial airways, breathing circuits, humidification devices 
and mechanical ventilator. Using a physiology-based approach presents a method 
to ventilate non-homogenous lungs through cyclic changes of different PEEP 
levels; recruitment takes place in lung areas with long time constants but 
protects relatively healthy lung areas from overdistension thus minimizing 
excessive mechanical power to the lung tissue.

OBJECTIVE: The provision of healthcare facilities remains high on the manifesto 
of various political parties in Pakistan and healthcare spending has witnessed a 
significant surge in the last two decades that is expected to positively 
influence health outcomes in the country. Therefore, this research aims to 
explore the effects of healthcare expenditures on the actual health status of 
the masses in Pakistan for the period 1995Q1 to 2017Q1.
METHODS: We apply the Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) approach 
for estimation purposes. This is the most recent and emerging estimation 
technique in time series analysis.
RESULTS: Our findings confirm that public healthcare spending significantly 
impacts health outcomes in Pakistan both in the short-run and long-run. Public 
healthcare spending improves life expectancy and reduces death rate and infant 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: The study concludes that public healthcare is the main focus of the 
current regime. It is noticed that spending on healthcare significantly 
contributes to the health outcomes in Pakistan. These efforts by the government 
significantly promote life expectancy and drop down the mortality ratio in the 
country. Based on these notable facts, the government should allocate sufficient 
resources towards the latest healthcare technologies and equipment to optimize 
health outcomes in the country.

This study examines how socioeconomic status (SES) across the life course is 
associated with individuals' lifetime dementia experience - the years of life 
persons can expect to live and without with dementia. Conceptually, 
dementia-free life expectancy reflects the ability to postpone dementia onset 
while dementia life expectancy reflects the average lifetime period with the 
condition. How SES across the life course contributes to dementia-status life 
expectancy is the focus of this study. We assess whether persons who are 
advantaged in their lifetime SES live the most years without dementia and the 
fewest years with dementia compared to less advantaged persons. Using the Health 
and Retirement Study (2000-2016), we examine these questions for U.S. adults 
aged 65 and older using multistate life tables and a microsimulation approach. 
The results show that higher SES persons can expect to live significantly more 
years of life without dementia and that the period of life with dementia is 
compressed compared to less advantaged persons. The results also underscore that 
importance of cumulative exposure, showing that adults from disadvantaged 
childhoods who achieve high education levels often have dementia experiences 
that are similar to or better than those of adults from advantaged childhoods 
who achieved low education levels.

Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is one of the leading causes of death in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) due to its high morbidity and mortality among 
immunocompromised patients. Early diagnosis of IFI is typically infeasible 
because of the lack of clinical signs and symptoms. By virtue of the cationic 
conjugated polymer-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (CCP-FRET) 
technology, we develop a rapid, visible, simple, and sensitive method for 
simultaneous detection and discrimination of three types of pathogens, including 
Candida albicans (C. albicans), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), and 
Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans). The CCP-FRET system contains a CCP 
fluorescent probe and pathogen-specific DNA labeled with fluorescent dyes. These 
two components spontaneously self-assemble into the complex under electrostatic 
attraction, resulting in an efficient FRET from CCP to fluorescent dyes when 
irradiated with a 380 nm ultraviolet (UV) light. The CCP-FRET method can 
specifically identify the DNA molecules that are extracted from culture pathogen 
strains or blood samples via PCR and single base extension (SBE) reactions, 
without any cross-reactions on the DNA of nonspecific strains. In particular, 
the sensitivity of this method is down to 0.03125 ng, which is ten times higher 
than that of real-time PCR. We further evaluate its detection efficiency by 
testing 15 blood samples from neonatal patients who suffer from pathogen 
infections, in which some of them have undergone antipathogen treatments. Using 
the CCP-FRET method, 33.3% (5/15) of samples tested positive for C. albicans 
and/or K. pneumoniae infections, whereas no pathogen DNAs are recognized with 
real-time PCR, despite using the same primers. Interestingly, the CCP-FRET 
method can output unique fluorescent color as well as RGB patterns to different 
types of pathogen infections, by which the infection type can be conveniently 
determined. Collectively, the CCP-FRET method is a sensitive and reliable 
detection platform for rapid identification of fungal and bacterial multiple 
infections, holding great promise for uses in clinical testing.

Background Ischemic heart disease (IHD) imposes the greatest disease burden 
globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aim to 
examine the population-attributable fraction and risk-attributable death and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for IHD in 137 low- and middle-income 
countries. Methods and Results Using comparative risk assessment framework from 
the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study, the population-attributable fraction 
and IHD burden (death and DALYs) attributable to risk factors in low-income 
countries, lower-middle-income countries (LMCs), and upper-middle-income 
countries were assessed from 2000 to 2019. In 2019, the population-attributable 
fraction (%) of IHD deaths in relation to all modifiable risk factors combined 
was highest in lower-middle-income countries (94.2; 95% uncertainty interval, 
91.9-96.2), followed by upper-middle-income countries (93.5; 90.4-95.8) and 
low-income countries (92.5; 90.0-94.7). There was a >13-fold difference between 
Peru and Uzbekistan in age-standardized rates (per 100 000) of attributable 
death (44.3 versus 660.4) and DALYs (786.7 versus 10506.1). Dietary risks 
accounted for the largest proportion of IHD's behavioral burden in low- and 
middle-income countries, primarily attributable to diets low in whole grains. 
High systolic blood pressure and high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
remained the 2 leading causes of DALYs, with the former topping the list in 116 
countries, while the latter led in 21 of the 137 countries. Compared with 2000 
to 2010, the increases in risk-attributable deaths and DALYs among upper-middle 
income countries were slower from 2010 to 2019, while the trends in low-income 
countries and lower-middle income countries were opposite. Conclusions IHD's 
attributable burden remains high in low- and middle-income countries. 
Considerable heterogeneity was observed among different income-classified 
regions and countries.

BACKGROUND: Given the large number of palliative patients cared for by the 
emergency services, education and training in palliative care topics are playing 
an increasingly important role. To support decision-making in an emergency 
setting a palliative or emergency card has been introduced in many cities.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the success of educational interventions and the effect of 
the palliative or emergency card, a questionnaire was developed and validated to 
determine palliative knowledge and palliative self-efficacy expectations in the 
emergency services.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Delphi process was applied for development and content 
validation. Factor analysis was used for construct validation. Criterion 
validity was assessed with the help of 22 nurses specially trained in palliative 
care. Reliability was determined using Cronbach's alpha as a measure of internal 
consistency.
RESULTS: In all, 291 of 750 paramedics participated in the voluntary survey. 
After completion of the Delphi process, there was consensus that the important 
topics of pain, dyspnea, sedation, end-of-life care, euthanasia, and legal 
aspects were covered in the questionnaire. Factor analysis was in favor of a 
six-factor solution. Criterion validation revealed a significant difference in 
palliative knowledge between palliative care nurses (MRang 289.73) and 
paramedics (MRang 146.97, U = 281.000, r = 0.40, p < 0.001). Cronbach's alpha 
was 0.70 for the knowledge questions and 0.82 for the palliative care 
self-efficacy expectancy subscale.
CONCLUSIONS: The Paramedic Palliative Care Test (PARPACT) is a validated 
measurement tool for testing educational interventions in paramedicine.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Angesichts der Vielzahl von 
Palliativpatienten, die vom Rettungsdienst versorgt werden, spielen Aus- und 
Weiterbildung in palliativmedizinischen Themen eine immer größere Rolle. Zur 
Verbesserung der Entscheidungsfindung in Rettungssituationen wurde in vielen 
Städten ein Palliativ- bzw. Notfallausweis eingeführt.
ZIEL DER ARBEIT: Um den Erfolg von Bildungsmaßnahmen und den Effekt des 
Palliativ- bzw. Notfallausweises zu überprüfen, wurde ein Fragebogen zur 
Ermittlung von palliativem Wissen und palliativer Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung im 
Rettungsdienst entwickelt und validiert.
MATERIAL UND METHODEN: Die Entwicklung und Inhaltsvalidierung erfolgte mithilfe 
eines Delphi-Prozesses. Zur Konstruktvalidierung wurde die Faktorenanalyse 
genutzt. Die Kriteriumsvalidität wurde anhand von 22 speziell in Palliative Care 
geschulten Pflegekräften überprüft. Die Reliabilität wurde mittels Cronbachs α 
als Maß der internen Konsistenz ermittelt.
ERGEBNISSE: 291 von 750 Rettungsdienstmitarbeitern nahmen an der freiwilligen 
Befragung teil. Nach Abschluss des Delphi-Prozesses bestand Konsens, dass die 
wichtigen Themen Schmerz, Dyspnoe, Sedierung, Sterbebegleitung, Sterbehilfe und 
rechtliche Aspekte im Fragebogen abgedeckt sind. Das Ergebnis der 
Faktorenanalyse sprach für eine 6‑Faktoren-Lösung. Bei der Kriteriumsvalidierung 
zeigte sich ein signifikanter Unterschied im palliativen Wissen zwischen den 
Palliative-Care-Pflegekräften (MRang 289,73) und den Rettungsdienstmitarbeitern 
(MRang 146,97, U = 281.000, r = 0,40, p < 0,001). Cronbachs α lag für die 
Wissensfragen bei 0,70 und für die Subskala der palliativen 
Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung bei 0,82.
DISKUSSION: Mit dem Paramedic Palliative Care Test (PARPACT) liegt ein 
validiertes Messinstrument zur Überprüfung von Bildungsmaßnahmen im 
Rettungsdienst vor.

INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The treatment of ischemic stroke due to large-vessel 
occlusion has been revolutionized by mechanical thrombectomy (MT), as multiple 
trials have consistently shown improved functional outcomes compared to standard 
medical management both in the early and late time windows after symptom onset. 
However, MT is an interventional procedure that is more costly than best 
supportive care (BSC).
METHODS: We set out to study the cost-utility and budget impact of MT + BSC 
versus BSC alone for large-vessel occlusion using a combined decision tree and 
Markov model. The analysis was conducted from a Belgian payer perspective over a 
lifetime horizon, and health states were defined by the modified Rankin Scale 
(mRS). The treatment effect of MT + BSC combined clinical outcomes from all 
published early and late treatment window studies showing improved mRS after 
90 days. Resource use and utilities were informed by an observational Belgian 
study of 569 stroke patients. Long-term mRS transitions were sourced from the 
Oxford Vascular study.
RESULTS: MT + BSC generated 1.31 additional quality-adjusted life years and 
resulted in cost savings of €10,216 per patient over lifetime. Deterministic 
sensitivity analyses demonstrated dominance of MT over a wide range of parameter 
inputs. In a Belgian setting, adding MT to BSC within an early time window for 
1575 eligible stroke patients every year produced cost savings between €6.3 
million (year 1) and €14.6 million (year 5), or a total cost saving of €56.2 
million over 5 years.
CONCLUSION: Mechanical thrombectomy is a highly cost-effective treatment for 
ischemic stroke patients, providing quality-adjusted survival at lower health 
care cost, both when given in an early time window, as well as in a late time 
window.

Thrips hawaiiensis (Morgan) is a flower-inhabiting thrips with a wide range of 
host plants, but little is known regarding its biological and ecological 
characteristics on vegetable hosts. Here, we evaluated the development, 
survival, and oviposition of T. hawaiiensis on five vegetable species (Capsicum 
annuum, Solanum melongena, Cucurbita moschata, Lablab purpureus, and Brassica 
oleracea), and constructed its life tables on these vegetables. There were 
significant differences in the development of T. hawaiiensis on the five 
vegetables, and the developmental times from egg to adult were 12.19 days, 
11.59 days, 11.12 days, 10.78 days, and 10.51 days on C. moschata, B. oleracea, 
L. purpureus, C. annuum, and S. melongena, respectively. There were also 
significant differences in T. hawaiiensis' survival rate on these plants, with 
S. melongena (71.00%) > C. annuum (67.33%) > L. purpureus (63.33%) > B. oleracea 
(57.00%) > C. moschata (49.33%). The greatest and lowest fecundity levels of T. 
hawaiiensis were found on S. melongena (44.28) and C. moschata (30.16), 
respectively. T. hawaiiensis had the greatest net reproductive rate on S. 
melongena (19.22), followed by C. annuum (16.11), L. purpureus (15.17), B. 
oleracea (11.10), and C. moschata (8.47), and the intrinsic rate of increase 
showed a similar trend, with values of 0.140, 0.125, 0.121, 0.112, and 0.093, 
respectively. Thus, S. melongena and C. moschata were the most and least 
suitable hosts for the population development of T. hawaiiensis among the five 
tested vegetable hosts. This study could provide important information for the 
key control of T. hawaiiensis on different crops.

BACKGROUND: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is one of the most common conditions in 
clinical practice. In spite of its prevalence, FD is associated with major 
uncertainties in terms of its definition, underlying pathophysiology, diagnosis, 
treatment, and prognosis.
METHODS: A Delphi consensus was initiated with 41 experts from 22 European 
countries who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 87 
statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated using the grading of 
recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) criteria. 
Consensus (defined as >80% agreement) was reached for 36 statements.
RESULTS: The panel agreed with the definition in terms of its cardinal symptoms 
(early satiation, postprandial fullness, epigastric pain, and epigastric 
burning), its subdivision into epigastric pain syndrome and postprandial 
distress syndrome, and the presence of accessory symptoms (upper abdominal 
bloating, nausea, belching), and overlapping conditions. Also, well accepted are 
the female predominance of FD, its impact on quality of life and health costs, 
and acute gastrointestinal infections, and anxiety as risk factors. In terms of 
pathophysiological mechanisms, the consensus supports a role for impaired 
gastric accommodation, delayed gastric emptying, hypersensitivity to gastric 
distention, Helicobacter pylori infection, and altered central processing of 
signals from the gastroduodenal region. There is consensus that endoscopy is 
mandatory for establishing a firm diagnosis of FD, but that in primary care, 
patients without alarm symptoms or risk factors can be managed without 
endoscopy. There is consensus that H. pylori status should be determined in 
every patient with dyspeptic symptoms and H. pylori positive patients should 
receive eradication therapy. Also, proton pump inhibitor therapy is considered 
an effective therapy for FD, but no other treatment approach reached a 
consensus. The long-term prognosis and life expectancy are favorable.
CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: A multinational group of European experts summarized 
the current state of consensus on the definition, diagnosis and management of 
FD.

BACKGROUND: The Herpesviridae family plays a significant etiological role in 
central nervous system viral infections during primary infection or reactivation 
from a latent form. Early detection is crucial because prescribing some 
antivirals can prevent severe side effects or life-threatening conditions.
METHODS: In this study, 251 CSF specimens were collected from patients with 
clinical suspicion of viral encephalitis in Pars Hospital, Tehran, Iran. DNA was 
extracted, and a multiplex PCR was designed to investigate the presence of 
herpes simplex virus-1, herpes simplex virus-2, varicella zoster virus, 
Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus.
RESULTS: Overall, 59 cases of the 251 CSF samples were positive for multiplex 
PCR (23.5%). The most frequent positive findings were EBV and HSV, with a 
prevalence of 10.3% and 8.7% (5.5% HSV-1 and 3.1% HSV-2), respectively. Four 
co-infections were also seen in this study.
CONCLUSIONS: This multiplex PCR assay detects simultaneously different 
herpesviruses in CSF samples of patients with suspected encephalitis in 2 rounds 
of PCR amplification; therefore, it is a reliable and cost-saving diagnostic 
method for evaluating patients infected with herpesvirus with neurological 
disorders.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy has greatly increased, generating an improvement in 
screening programs for disease prevention, lifesaving drugs and medical devices. 
The impact of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the very 
elderly is not well-established. Our aim was to explore the association of 
LDL-C, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and lipid lowering drugs 
(LLDs) on cognitive decline, malignancies and overall survival.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Our study comprised 1498 (72.7%) 
males and 561 (27.3%) females, aged ≥70 who had attended the Institute for 
Medical Screening (IMS), Sheba Medical Center, Israel at least twice during 
2013-2019. Data were obtained from the computerized database of the IMS. A 
manual quality control to identify potential discrepancies was performed.
RESULTS: Overall, 6.3% of the subjects treated with LLDs (95/1421) versus 4.2% 
not treated (28/638), cognitively declined during the study years. No 
statistically significant effects of LDL-C, HDL-C and LLDs on cognitive decline 
were observed after correcting for age, prior stroke and other vascular risk 
factors. With regard to cancer, after adjusting for confounders and multiple 
inferences, no definite relationships were found.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of an elderly, high socioeconomic status cohort 
suggests several relationships between the use of LLDs and health outcomes, some 
beneficial, especially, with regard to certain types of cancer, but with a 
higher risk of cognitive decline. Further studies are warranted to clarify the 
health effects of these medications in the elderly.
