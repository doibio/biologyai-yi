recalcitrant pemphigus not responding to several previous treatments, who 
received treatment with apremilast over a period of 32 weeks. Desmoglein 
autoantibody levels were assessed by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), 
whereas disease severity and quality of life were assessed by the Autoimmune 
Bullous Skin Disorder Intensity Score (ABSIS). In an attempt to explain the 
effects of apremilast in pemphigus, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
were analyzed for the duration of treatment by flow cytometry for the 
distribution of specialized T cell subsets. The frequencies of circulating T 
helper (Th) 1, Th2, Th17, Th17.1 and T follicular helper (Tfh) 1, Tfh2, Tfh17, 
and Tfh17.1 were analyzed by CCR6, CXCR3, and CXCR5 expression of CD4+ T cells. 
Further, based on the different expressions of CXCR5, CD127, and CD25, we 
analyzed the T regulatory (Treg) and T follicular regulatory (Tfreg) 
compartment.
RESULTS: In response to apremilast treatment, Dsg-specific autoantibody titers 
decreased, blistering ceased and lesions healed, showing a long-lasting effect. 
While the frequencies of most of the Th and Tfh cell subsets remained unchanged, 
we observed a continuous increase in Treg and Tfreg cell levels.
CONCLUSION: Our findings are encouraging and warrant extension of the beneficial 
effect of PDE4 inhibition on a larger cohort of pemphigus patients.

Intracranial metastasis from prostate adenocarcinoma is rare. A 70-year-old 
African American male with a history of prostate adenocarcinoma for the last 
14 years, presented to our hospital complaining of generalized weakness for the 
past 2 weeks. He was found to have fever with left ptosis and mild eyelid edema. 
Brain MRI showed dural metastasis. Two months after the first presentation, he 
was readmitted with a suspected acute cerebral vascular accident (CVA). CT brain 
showed vasogenic edema in the right subcortical, likely from intracranial 
metastasis. His acute neurological symptoms improved with intravenous 
dexamethasone. This case highlights the possibility of intracranial metastasis 
from prostate adenocarcinoma. With the advent of novel therapies for prostate 
cancer, which prolong life expectancy, intracranial metastasis from prostate 
adenocarcinoma may become an increasingly frequent clinical scenario.

Cell and tissue polarity due to the extracellular signaling and intracellular 
gene cascades, in turn, signals the directed cell behaviors and asymmetric 
tissue architectures that play a crucial role in organogenesis and 
embryogenesis. The notochord is a characteristic midline organ in chordate 
embryos that supports the body structure and produces positioning signaling. 
This review summarizes cellular and tissue-level polarities during notochord 
development in ascidians. At the early stage, planar cell polarity (PCP) is 
initialized, which drives cell convergence extension and migration to form a 
rod-like structure. Subsequently, the notochord undergoes a 
mesenchymal-epithelial transition, becoming an unusual epithelium in which cells 
have two opposing apical domains facing the extracellular lumen deposited 
between adjacent notochord cells controlled by apical-basal (AB) polarity. 
Cytoskeleton distribution is one of the main downstream events of cell polarity. 
Some cytoskeleton polarity patterns are a consequence of PCP: however, an 
additional polarized cytoskeleton, together with Rho signaling, might serve as a 
guide for correct AB polarity initiation in the notochord. In addition, the 
notochord's mechanical properties are associated with polarity establishment and 
transformation, which bridge signaling regulation and tissue mechanical 
properties that enable the coordinated organogenesis during embryo development.

Modeling realistic human decision-making is an important feature of good policy 
design processes. The use of an agent-based modeling framework allows for 
quantitative human decision-models that assume fully rational agents. This 
research introduces a dynamic human decision-making sub-model. The 
parameterisation of human memory and "rationality" in a decision-making model 
represents an important extension of decision-making in ABMs. A data driven 
model of herd movement within a dynamic natural environment is the context for 
evaluating the cognitive decision-making model. The natural and human 
environments are linked via memory and rationality that affect herdsmen 
decision-making to vaccinate cattle using a once-for-life vaccine (Rift Valley 
fever) and an annual booster vaccine (Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia). The 
simulation model uses environmental data from Samburu county, Kenya from 2004 to 
2015. The cognitive parameters of memory and "rationality" are shown to 
successfully differentiate between vaccination decisions that are characterized 
by annual and once-for-life choices. The preliminary specifications and findings 
from the dynamic cognition-pastoralist agent-based model (PastoralScape) 
indicate that the model offers much to livestock vaccination modeling among 
small-scale herders.

An assay for accurately diagnosing early stage Parkinson's Disease (PD) is 
currently unavailable, and therefore, there is an urgent and unmet need. Such a 
diagnostic assay will enable prompt institution of appropriate supportive 
management measures to prevent rapid deterioration of disease and improve both 
quality of life and life expectancy of PD patients. A reliable assay platform 
will also be of great benefit to drug discovery and drug development in the area 
of PD. To this end, we describe the development of two indirect, competitive, 
semiquantitative enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), each employing a disparate 
singularly specific mouse monoclonal antibody (ssMAb) against pathological 
aggregates of human α-Synuclein (αSynagg), a well-established biomarker 
pathognomonic of PD. Our results demonstrate that these EIAs in tandem 
accurately discriminated between αSynagg serum concentrations from PD patients 
and age-matched healthy control (HC) individuals (PD = 1700 ± 220 ng/mL; HC = 
870 ± 120 ng/mL with an overall sensitivity of 56%, specificity of 63%, positive 
predictive value of 60%, and negative predictive value of 59%). The limits of 
detection of αSynagg were 400 and 300 pg/mL for ssMAbs 3C5 and 5H6, 
respectively. These tandem EIAs have the potential to add to the repertoire of 
tools for earlier diagnosis of this debilitating disorder, as well as for drug 
development strategies.

Safety and efficacy of repeat transcatheter aortic valve replacement for the 
treatment of transcatheter prosthesis dysfunction.

Introduction: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has recently 
expanded toward the treatment of younger patients with lower surgical risk and 
longer life expectancy. Thus, transcatheter heart valve (THV) durability has 
become a central issue, and an important increase in the number of TAVR-in-TAVR 
is expected in the coming years. Areas covered: Overview of the current status 
of TAVR-in-TAVR for the treatment of THV dysfunction, focusing on safety and 
efficacy of repeat TAVR procedures. Expert opinion: An accurate analysis of the 
pre-procedure cardiac computed tomography, incorporating new parameters such as 
the position of the top of the first THV in relation to the 
sinotubular-junction, will be necessary to assess the risk of coronary 
occlusion. Subsequent coronary angiography will be necessary in a proportion of 
TAVR-in-TAVR patients, but coronary access may be very difficult or even 
impossible in some of them. Therefore, the choice between TAVR and SAVR in young 
low-risk patients should incorporate the potential need for treating coronary 
events at mid- to long-term follow-up. Likewise, the choice of the valve type 
and the implantation position at the time of the first TAVR procedure should 
take into account the possibility of TAVR-in-TAVR in the future.Abbreviations

BACKGROUND: Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of novel rapid 
diagnostic tests: rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDT), digital immunoassays 
(DIA), rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), and other treatment 
algorithms for influenza in high-risk patients presenting to hospital with 
influenza-like illness (ILI).
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of diagnostic test strategies (RIDT, DIA, NAAT, clinical judgement, batch 
polymerase chain reaction) preceding treatment; no diagnostic testing and 
treating everyone; and not treating anyone. We modeled high-risk 65-year old 
patients from a health payer perspective and accrued outcomes over a patient's 
lifetime. We reported health outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
healthcare costs, and net health benefit (NHB) to measure cost-effectiveness per 
cohort of 100,000 patients.
RESULTS: Treating everyone with no prior testing was the most cost-effective 
strategy, at a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000/QALY, in over 85% of 
simulations. This strategy yielded the highest NHB of 15.0344 QALYs, but 
inappropriately treats all patients without influenza. Of the novel rapid 
diagnostics, NAAT resulted in the highest NHB (15.0277 QALYs), and the least 
number of deaths (1,571 per 100,000). Sensitivity analyses determined that 
results were most impacted by the pretest probability of ILI being influenza, 
diagnostic test sensitivity, and treatment effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our model, treating high-risk patients presenting to 
hospital with influenza-like illness, without performing a novel rapid 
diagnostic test, resulted in the highest NHB and was most cost-effective. 
However, consideration of whether treatment is appropriate in the absence of 
diagnostic confirmation should be taken into account for decision-making by 
clinicians and policymakers.

IMPORTANCE: Guidelines recommend targeting preventive interventions toward older 
adults whose life expectancy is greater than the intervention's time to benefit 
(TTB). The TTB for statin therapy is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a survival meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of 
statins to determine the TTB for prevention of a first major adverse 
cardiovascular event (MACE) in adults aged 50 to 75 years.
DATA SOURCES: Studies were identified from previously published systematic 
reviews (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and US Preventive Services Task 
Force) and a search of MEDLINE and Google Scholar for subsequently published 
studies until February 1, 2020.
STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials of statins for primary prevention 
focusing on older adults (mean age >55 years).
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two authors independently abstracted survival 
data for the control and intervention groups. Weibull survival curves were fit, 
and a random-effects model was used to estimate pooled absolute risk reductions 
(ARRs) between control and intervention groups each year. Markov chain Monte 
Carlo methods were applied to determine time to ARR thresholds.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to ARR thresholds 
(0.002, 0.005, and 0.010) for a first MACE, as defined by each trial. There were 
broad similarities in the definition of MACE across trials, with all trials 
including myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality.
RESULTS: Eight trials randomizing 65 383 adults (66.3% men) were identified. The 
mean age ranged from 55 to 69 years old and the mean length of follow-up ranged 
from 2 to 6 years. Only 1 of 8 studies showed that statins decreased all-cause 
mortality. The meta-analysis results suggested that 2.5 (95% CI, 1.7-3.4) years 
were needed to avoid 1 MACE for 100 patients treated with a statin. To prevent 1 
MACE for 200 patients treated (ARR = 0.005), the TTB was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.0-1.7) 
years, whereas the TTB to avoid 1 MACE for 500 patients treated (ARR = 0.002) 
was 0.8 (95% CI, 0.5-1.0) years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that treating 100 adults (aged 
50-75 years) without known cardiovascular disease with a statin for 2.5 years 
prevented 1 MACE in 1 adult. Statins may help to prevent a first MACE in adults 
aged 50 to 75 years old if they have a life expectancy of at least 2.5 years. 
There is no evidence of a mortality benefit.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We examined retrospectively whether the combination 
of standard dacarbazine (DTIC) and/or fotemustine chemotherapy and autologous 
peptide-loaded dendritic cell (DC) vaccination may improve survival of stage IV 
melanoma patients. Furthermore, a small cohort of long-term survivors was 
studied in more detail.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1998 and 2008, 41 patients were vaccinated at 
least three times with DCs while receiving chemotherapy and compared to all 
other 168 patients in our database who only received chemotherapy (1993-2008).
RESULTS: Median life expectancy of patients receiving additional DC-vaccination 
was 18 months, compared to eleven months for patients under standard 
chemotherapy alone. In contrast to patients with other haplotypes, the HLA-A1/A1 
subset of DC-treated patients showed significantly lower median survival (12 vs. 
25 months). Autoantibodies were frequently detected in serum of both vaccinated 
and non-vaccinated patients, and there was no correlation between titers, loss 
or appearance of autoantibodies and survival. Additionally, phenotyping of DCs 
and PBMCs also did not reveal any conspicuous correlation with survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining standard chemotherapy and DC vaccination appears superior 
to chemotherapy alone. The impact of HLA haplotypes on survival emphasizes the 
importance of a careful selection of patients with specific, well-defined HLA 
haplotypes for future vaccination trials using peptide-pulsed DCs, possibly 
combined with checkpoint inhibitors.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness studies on pacemakers have increased in the last 
years. However the number of long-term cost-utility studies is limited. The 
objective of this study was to perform a cost-utility analysis comparing remote 
monitoring (RM) versus conventional monitoring (CM) in hospital of older 
patients with pacemakers, 5 years after implant.
METHODS: Under a controlled, not randomized, nor masked clinical trial, 83 
patients with pacemakers were initially selected. After five years of follow-up, 
a total of 55 patients (CM = 34; RM = 21) completed the study. A cost-utility 
analysis of RM in terms of costs per gained quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
was conducted. The costs from the Public Health System (PHS) as well as patients 
and their relatives were taken into account for the study. The robustness of the 
results was verified by the probabilistic analyses through Monte-Carlo 
simulations.
RESULTS: After a five-year follow-up period, total costs were lower in the RM 
group by 23.02% than in the CM group (€274.52 versus €356.62; p = 0.033) because 
of a cost saving from patients' perspective (€59.05 versus €102.98; p = 0.002). 
However, the reduction of in-hospital visits derived from RM exhibited 
insignificant impact on the costs from the PHS perspective, with a cost saving 
of 15.04% (€215.48 vs. €253.64; p = 0.144). Costs/QALYs obtained by the RM group 
were higher as compared to the CM group, although there were no significant 
differences. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CM in comparison to RM 
became positive (€301.16).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms RM of older patients with pacemakers appears 
still as a cost-utility alternative to CM in hospital after 5 years of 
follow-up.

BACKGROUND: The increase in average life expectancy increases the risk of 
illness and frailty in the elderly, especially in the cognitive arena. This 
study has the objective to estimate the prevalence and incidence of cognitive 
impairment, in a representative sample of 65 to 85 years old followed for a mean 
period of 6-years.
METHODS: Subjects aged 65-85 years (n = 586) were screened at baseline 
(1999-2004) to estimate the prevalence of cognitive impairment using the 
Mini-Mental State Examination. A total of 287 individuals with a normal MMSE at 
baseline were reassessed after 6.2 mean years (± 4.30 years) to evaluate the 
incidence of cognitive impairment, defined as scoring below the age and 
education-adjusted MMSE cut-off points adapted for the Portuguese population. We 
did not exclude Dementia.
RESULTS: The baseline prevalence of cognitive impairment was 15.5% (95% CI: 
12.7-18.7). Higher in women (18.9%; 95% CI: 14.9-23.3), that in men (10.4%; 95% 
CI: 6.7-15.1). Increased with age and was highest for participants without any 
schooling. The overall incidence rate was 26.97 per 1000 person-years; higher in 
women (33.8 per 1000 person-years) than in men (18.0 per 1000 person-years). 
Higher for the oldest participants and those with no schooling. Taking the 
standard European population, we estimated a prevalence of 16.5% and an 
incidence of 34.4 per 1000 person-years.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cognitive impairment in Portugal is within the 
estimated interval for the European population, and the incidence is lower than 
for the majority of the European countries. Women, senior and elders without 
education have a higher risk of cognitive impairment. In our sample, neither 
employment nor marital status has a significant effect on cognitive impairment.

Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders (hereafter respectfully 
referred to as Indigenous Australians) experience disproportionately poor health 
and low life expectancy compared to non-Indigenous Australians. Poor oral health 
is a critical, but understudied, contributor to this health gap. A considerable 
body of evidence links poor oral health to increased risks of other chronic 
non-communicable conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic 
kidney disease, and poor emotional wellbeing.  MAIN: The oral microbiota is 
indisputably associated with several oral diseases that disproportionately 
affect Indigenous Australians. Furthermore, a growing literature suggests direct 
and indirect links between the oral microbiota and systemic chronic 
non-communicable diseases that underpin much of the Indigenous health gap in 
Australia. Recent research indicates that oral microbial communities are shaped 
by a combination of cultural and lifestyle factors and are inherited from 
caregivers to children. Systematic differences in oral microbiota diversity and 
composition have been identified between Indigenous and non-Indigenous 
individuals in Australia and elsewhere, suggesting that microbiota-related 
diseases may be distinct in Indigenous Australians.  CONCLUSION: Oral microbiota 
research involving Indigenous Australians is a promising new area that could 
benefit Indigenous communities in numerous ways. These potential benefits 
include: (1) ensuring equity and access for Indigenous Australians in 
microbiota-related therapies; (2) opportunities for knowledge-sharing and 
collaborative research between scientists and Indigenous communities; and (3) 
using knowledge about the oral microbiota and chronic disease to help close the 
gaps in Indigenous oral and systemic health.

The increasing proportion of the population aged 65 or over has generated a 
global rise of health spending due to higher demand for medical and long-term 
care services, which has become a growing challenge to the sustainability of 
public finances across countries. This phenomenon is especially prominent in 
China, which has experienced accelerated rates of both economic growth and 
population ageing over the past four decades. Using Bayesian-VAR (B-VAR) models 
we compute the impulse response functions (IRFs) and the forecast error variance 
decomposition functions (FEVDs) to empirically examine the dynamic relationships 
between ageing index, life expectancy, economic growth and health expenditure in 
China. We compare China with the USA which has distinct trajectories of 
population structure and economic development to better understand the former's 
dynamic patterns. We find a pronounced response for both the USA and China of 
ageing index to life expectancy and of health spending per capita to GDP per 
capita, while ageing population induces a relatively strong reaction from health 
expenditure per capita in China. Our results are robust with either nominal or 
real variables. These findings suggest that, in China, a well-rounded policy 
accommodating economic, social and health factors is needed to improve the 
quality of life of the ageing population for a sustainable development of the 
economy.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of hospitalised 
patients with COVID-19 from UK in the highest decile of health and gross 
regional products per capita.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Recruited all adult inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 
symptoms admitted to a single Surrey centre between March and April 2020. 
Extensive demographic details were documented.
OUTCOME MEASURE: COVID-19 status of alive/dead and intensive care unit (ICU) 
status of yes/no.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19 from Surrey centre UK (n=429).
RESULTS: 429 adult inpatients (mean age 70±18 years; men 56.4%) were included in 
this study, of whom, 19.1% required admission to ICU and 31.9% died. Adverse 
outcomes were associated with age (OR with each decade of years: 1.78, 95% CI 
1.53 to 2.11, p<0.001 for mortality); male gender (OR=1.08, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.63, 
p=0.72, present in 70.7%, of admissions to ICU versus 53% of other cases, 
p=0.004); cardiac disease (OR=3.43, 95% CI 2.10 to 5.63, p<0.001), diabetes 
mellitus (OR=2.37, 95% CI 1.09 to 5.17, p=0.028) and dementia (OR=5.06, 95% CI 
2.79 to 9.44, p<0.001). There was no significant impact of ethnicity or body 
mass index on disease outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite reports of worse outcomes in deprived regions, we show 
similar complication and mortality rates due to COVID-19 in an affluent and high 
life expectancy region.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to prioritize interventions for increasing human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage based on cost-effectiveness from a US 
state perspective to inform decisions by policy makers.
METHODS: We developed a dynamic simulation model of HPV transmission and 
progression scaled to a medium-sized US state (5 million individuals). We 
modeled outcomes over 50 years comparing no intervention to a one-year 
implementation of centralized reminder and recall for HPV vaccination, 
school-located HPV vaccination, or quality improvement (QI) visits to primary 
care clinics. We used probabilistic sensitivity analysis to assess a range of 
plausible outcomes associated with each intervention. Cost-effectiveness was 
evaluated relative to a conservative willingness-to-pay threshold; $50 000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) .
RESULTS: All interventions were cost-effective, relative to no intervention. QI 
visits had the lowest cost and cost per QALY gained ($1538 versus no 
intervention). Statewide implementation of centralized reminder and recall cost 
$28 289 per QALY gained versus QI visits. School-located vaccination had the 
highest cost but was cost-effective at $18 337 per QALY gained versus QI visits. 
Scaling to the US population, interventions could avert 3000 to 14 000 future 
HPV cancers. When varying intervention cost and impact over feasible ranges, 
interventions were typically preferred to no intervention, but 
cost-effectiveness varied between intervention strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Three interventions for increasing HPV vaccine coverage were 
cost-effective and offered substantial health benefits. Policy makers seeking to 
increase HPV vaccination should, at minimum, dedicate additional funding for QI 
visits, which are consistently effective at low cost and may additionally 
consider more resource-intensive interventions (reminder and recall or 
school-located vaccination).

Erratum in
    Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2021 Mar 2;118(9):

Animal experiments have demonstrated that energy intake and the balance of 
macronutrients determine life span and patterns of age-specific mortality (ASM). 
Similar effects have also been detected in epidemiological studies in humans. 
Using global supply data and 1,879 life tables from 103 countries, we test for 
these effects at a macrolevel: between the nutrient supplies of nations and 
their patterns of ASM. We find that macronutrient supplies are strong predictors 
of ASM even after correction for time and economic factors. Globally, signatures 
of undernutrition are evident in the effects of low supply on life expectancy at 
birth and high mortality across ages, even as recently as 2016. However, in 
wealthy countries, the effects of overnutrition are prominent, where high 
supplies particularly from fats and carbohydrates are predicted to lead to high 
levels of mortality. Energy supplied at around 3,500 kcal/cap/d minimized 
mortality across ages. However, we show that the macronutrient composition of 
energy supply that minimizes mortality varies with age. In early life, 40 to 45% 
energy from each of fat and carbohydrate and 16% from protein minimizes 
mortality. In later life, replacing fat with carbohydrates to around 65% of 
total energy and reducing protein to 11% is associated with the lowest level of 
mortality. These results, particularly those regarding fats, accord both with 
experimental data from animals and within-country epidemiological studies on the 
association between macronutrient intake and risk of age-related chronic 
diseases.

The entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana is a widely used biopesticide 
that is considered as an effective alternative to classical agrochemicals. B. 
bassiana is thought to be safe for pollinators although little is known about 
its side-effects on pollinators' behaviour and cognition. Here, we focused on 
honey bees and used the proboscis extension response (PER) protocol to assess 
whether B. bassiana affects individual sucrose responsiveness, non-associative 
and associative olfactory learning and memory. Fungus-treated bees displayed an 
enhanced sucrose responsiveness, which could not be explained by metabolic 
alterations. Strikingly, exposed bees were twice as inconsistent as controls in 
response to sucrose, showing PER to lower but not to higher sucrose 
concentrations. Exposed bees habituated less to sucrose and had a better 
acquisition performance in the conditioning phase than controls. Further, 
neither mid- nor long-term memory were affected by the fungus. As sucrose 
responsiveness is the main determinant of division of foraging labour, these 
changes might unsettle the numerical ratio between the sub-castes of foragers 
leading to suboptimal foraging. Although the use of biocontrol strategies should 
be preferred over chemical pesticides, careful assessment of their side-effects 
is crucial before claiming that they are safe for pollinators.

In evaluating the appropriate response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a key parameter 
is the rate of substitution between wealth and mortality risk, conventionally 
summarized as the value per statistical life (VSL). For the United States, VSL 
is estimated as approximately $10 million, which implies the value of preventing 
100,000 COVID-19 deaths is $1 trillion. Is this value too large? There are 
reasons to think so. First, VSL is a marginal rate of substitution and the 
potential risk reductions are non-marginal. The standard VSL model implies the 
rate of substitution of wealth for risk reduction is smaller when the risk 
reduction is larger, but a closed-form solution calibrated to estimates of the 
income elasticity of VSL shows the rate of decline is modest until the value of 
a non-marginal risk reduction accounts for a substantial share of income; 
average individuals are predicted to be willing to spend more than half their 
income to reduce one-year mortality risk by 1 in 100. Second, mortality risk is 
concentrated among the elderly, for whom VSL may be smaller and who would 
benefit from a persistent risk reduction for a shorter period because of their 
shorter life expectancy. Third, the pandemic and responses to it have caused 
substantial losses in income that should decrease VSL. In contrast, VSL is 
plausibly larger for risks (like COVID-19) that are dreaded, uncertain, 
catastrophic, and ambiguous. These arguments are evaluated and key issues for 
improving estimates are highlighted.

BACKGROUND: A novel urine lipoarabinomannan assay (FujiLAM) has higher 
sensitivity and higher cost than the first-generation AlereLAM assay. We 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of FujiLAM for tuberculosis testing among 
hospitalized people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), irrespective of 
symptoms.
METHODS: We used a microsimulation model to project clinical and economic 
outcomes of 3 testing strategies: (1) sputum Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), (2) sputum 
Xpert plus urine AlereLAM (Xpert+AlereLAM), (3) sputum Xpert plus urine FujiLAM 
(Xpert+FujiLAM). The modeled cohort matched that of a 2-country clinical trial. 
We applied diagnostic yields from a retrospective study (yields for 
Xpert/Xpert+AlereLAM/Xpert+FujiLAM among those with CD4 <200 cells/µL: 
33%/62%/70%; among those with CD4 ≥200 cells/µL: 33%/35%/47%). Costs of 
Xpert/AlereLAM/FujiLAM were US$15/3/6 (South Africa) and $25/3/6 (Malawi). 
Xpert+FujiLAM was considered cost-effective if its incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (US$/year-of-life saved) was <$940 (South Africa) and 
<$750 (Malawi). We varied key parameters in sensitivity analysis and performed a 
budget impact analysis of implementing FujiLAM countrywide.
RESULTS: Compared with Xpert+AlereLAM, Xpert+FujiLAM increased life expectancy 
by 0.2 years for those tested in South Africa and Malawi. Xpert+FujiLAM was 
cost-effective in both countries. Xpert+FujiLAM for all patients remained 
cost-effective compared with sequential testing and CD4-stratified testing 
strategies. FujiLAM use added 3.5% (South Africa) and 4.7% (Malawi) to 5-year 
healthcare costs of tested patients, primarily reflecting ongoing HIV treatment 
costs among survivors.
CONCLUSIONS: FujiLAM with Xpert for tuberculosis testing in hospitalized people 
with HIV is likely to increase life expectancy and be cost-effective at the 
currently anticipated price in South Africa and Malawi. Additional studies 
should evaluate FujiLAM in clinical practice settings.
