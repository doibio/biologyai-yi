costs, and clinician staffing costs. Telemedicine in the ICU effectiveness was 
measured by cumulative quality-adjusted life years for 5 years after ICU 
discharge.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The base case cost-effectiveness analysis 
estimated telemedicine in the ICU to extend 0.011 quality-adjusted life years 
with an incremental cost of $516 per patient compared with ICU without 
telemedicine, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $45,320 
per additional quality-adjusted life year (= $516/0.011). The probabilistic 
cost-effectiveness analysis estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$50,265 with a wide 95% CI from a negative value (suggesting cost savings) to 
$375,870. These probabilistic analyses projected that cost saving is achieved 
37% of 1,000 iterations. Cost saving is also feasible if the per-patient 
per-hospital-stay operational cost and physician cost were less than $422 and 
less than $155, respectively, based on break-even analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses suggest that telemedicine in the ICU is cost-effective 
in most cases and cost saving in some cases. The thresholds of cost and 
effectiveness, estimated by break-even analyses, help hospitals determine the 
impact of telemedicine in the ICU and potential cost saving.

Weighted walking is a functional activity common in daily life and can influence 
risks for musculoskeletal loading, injury and falling. Much information exists 
about weighted walking during military, occupational and recreational tasks, but 
less is known about strategies used to accommodate to weight carriage typical in 
daily life. The purposes of the study were to examine the effects of weight 
carriage on kinematics and peak ground reaction force (GRF) during walking, and 
explore relationships between these variables. Twenty subjects walked on a 
treadmill while carrying 0, 44.5 and 89 N weights in front of the body. Peak 
GRF, sagittal plane joint/segment angular kinematics, stride length and center 
of mass (COM) vertical displacement were measured. Changes in peak GRF and 
displacement variables between weight conditions represented accommodation. 
Effects of weight carriage were tested using analysis of variance. Relationships 
between peak GRF and kinematic accommodation variables were examined using 
correlation and regression. Subjects were classified into sub-groups based on 
peak GRF responses and the correlation analysis was repeated. Weight carriage 
increased peak GRF by an amount greater than the weight carried, decreased 
stride length, increased vertical COM displacement, and resulted in a more 
extended and upright posture, with less hip and trunk displacement during weight 
acceptance. A GRF increase was associated with decreases in hip extension 
(|r|=.53, p=.020) and thigh anterior rotation (|r|=.57, p=.009) displacements, 
and an increase in foot anterior rotation displacement (|r|=.58, p=.008). 
Sub-group analysis revealed that greater GRF increases were associated with 
changes at multiple sites, while lesser GRF increases were associated with 
changes in foot and trunk displacement. Weight carriage affected walking 
kinematics and revealed different accommodation strategies that could have 
implications for loading and stability.

CONTEXT: The European Deprivation Index (EDI), is a new ecological estimate for 
Socio-Economic Status (SES). This study postulates that Time-To-Treatment could 
be used as a cancer quality-of -care surrogate in order to identify the 
association between cancer patient's SES and quality of care in a French 
comprehensive cancer center.
METHODS: retrospective mono-centered cohort study. All consecutive incoming 
adult patients diagnosed for breast cancer (BC), prostate cancer (PC), 
colorectal cancer (CRC), lung cancer (LC) or sarcoma (S) were included between 
January 2013 and December 2013. The association of EDI and Time-To-Diagnosis 
(TTD), as well as Time-To-Treatment (TTT) was analyzed using a cox regression, 
and a strata analysis per tumor site was performed.
RESULTS: 969 patients were included. Primitive tumor site was 505 BC (52%), 169 
PC (17%), 145 LC (15%), 116 CRC (12%), and 34 S (4%). Median TTD was 1.41 months 
(Q1-Q3 0.5 to 3.5 months). Median TTT was 0.9 months (0.4 - 1.4). In a 
multivariate analysis, we identified the tumor site as a predictive factor to 
influence TTD, shorter for BC (0.75 months, [0.30- 1.9]) than PC (4.69 months 
[1.6-29.7]), HR 0.27 95%CI = [0.22-0.34], p < 0.001. TTT was also shorter for BC 
(0.75 months [0.4-1.1]) than PC (2.02 [0.9-3.2]), HR 0.32 95%CI = [0.27-0.39], p 
< 0.001. EDI quintiles were not found associated with either TTT or TTD.
CONCLUSIONS: Deprivation estimated by the EDI does not appear to be related to 
an extension of the Time-to-Diagnosis or Time-to-Treatment in our real-life 
population. Further research should be done to identify other frailty-sensitive 
factors that could be responsible for delays in care.

INTRODUCTION: Using real-world data from the Providence Oregon Telestroke 
Network, we examined the cost-effectiveness of telestroke from both the spoke 
and hub perspectives by level of financial responsibility for these costs and by 
patient stroke severity.
METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic model using patient-level clinical 
and financial data from before and after telestroke implementation. 
Effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and was 
combined with cost per patient outcomes to calculate incremental cost 
effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Outcomes were generated (a) overall; (b) by stroke 
severity, via the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at time of 
arrival, defined as low (<5), medium (5-14) and high (>15); and (c) by 
percentage of implementation costs paid by spokes (0%, 50%, 100%).
RESULTS: Data for 864 patients, 98 pre- and 766 post-implementation, were used 
to parameterize our model. From the spoke perspective, telestroke had ICERs of 
US$1322/QALY, US$25,991/QALY and US$50,687/QALY when responsible for 0%, 50%, 
and 100% of these costs, respectively. Overall, the ICER ranged from 
US$22,363/QALY to US$71,703/QALY from the hub perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support previous models showing good value, overall. 
However, costs and ICERs varied by stroke severity, with telestroke being most 
cost-effective for severe strokes. Telestroke was least cost effective for the 
spokes if spokes paid for more than half of implementation costs.

To evaluate, from a US payer perspective, the cost-effectiveness of treatment 
strategies for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), we performed a systematic 
review of published cost-effectiveness analyses. We identified 14 papers that 
fulfilled our search criteria and revealed varying levels of value among current 
treatment strategies. Older agents such as 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and 
oxaliplatin provide high-value treatments. More modern agents targeting the EGFR 
or VEGF pathways, such as bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab, do not appear 
to be cost-effective treatments at their current costs. The analytical methods 
used within the papers varied widely, and this variation likely plays a 
significant role in the heterogeneity in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. 
The cost-effectiveness of current treatment strategies for mCRC is highly 
variable. Drugs recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for 
mCRC are not cost-effective, and this is primarily driven by high drug costs.

uncomplicated bone metastases.

There is controversy surrounding the optimal radiotherapy dose-fractionation for 
retreatment of painful bone metastases. Two commonly used regimens are 8 Gy in a 
single-fraction or 20 Gy in five or eight fractions. Randomized evidence, 
including the NCIC SC.20 randomized clinical trial, has failed to standardize 
clinical practice. Practitioners who use single-fraction regimens cite patient 
convenience, fewer acute adverse effects, and better cost-effectiveness. 
Practitioners who prefer multiple fractions raise questions about the 
interpretation of data that justifies single-fraction treatment, and the 
possibility that single-fraction treatment may provide inferior pain relief. 
Given this clinical controversy, should single-fraction irradiation be standard 
in retreatment of uncomplicated bone metastases? In this article, two teams 
debate both sides of the argument with commentary to summarize the relevant 
issues. The conclusion from the debate is that the "standard" treatment should 
be individualized to the patient with shared-decision making between the 
oncologist, patient and family members. In a cancer patient with poor 
performance status and short life expectancy, single-fraction repeat 
radiotherapy may be preferred; in a patient with a prolonged disease course, 
perhaps multiple fraction retreatments would be preferred. The choice between 
different fractionation schemes depends on an assessment of individual patient 
factors, tumour factors and unique patient circumstances.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic, progressive condition 
where the primary treatment goal is to maintain control of glycated haemoglobin 
(HbA1c). In order for healthcare decision makers to ensure patients receive the 
highest standard of care within the available budget, the clinical benefits of 
each treatment option must be balanced against the economic consequences. The 
aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin, the 
first-in-class sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, compared with 
a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i), when added to metformin for the 
treatment of patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin alone.
METHODS: The previously published and validated Cardiff diabetes model was used 
as the basis for this economic evaluation, with treatment effect parameters 
sourced from a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Costs, derived from 
a UK healthcare system perspective, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
were used to present the final outcome as an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) over a lifetime horizon. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses (PSA) were carried out to assess uncertainty in the model results.
RESULTS: Compared with DPP-4i, dapagliflozin was associated with a mean 
incremental benefit of 0.032 QALYs (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.022, 0.140) 
and with an incremental cost of £216 (95% CI: £-258, £795). This resulted in an 
ICER point estimate of £6,761 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis determined 
incremental costs to be insensitive to variation in most parameters, with only 
the treatment effect on weight having a notable impact on the incremental QALYs; 
however, there were no scenarios which raised the ICER above £15,000 per QALY. 
The PSA estimated that dapagliflozin had an 85% probability of being 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin in combination with metformin was shown to be a 
cost-effective treatment option from a UK healthcare system perspective for 
patients with T2DM who are inadequately controlled on metformin alone.

BACKGROUND: 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a chemotherapy used in colorectal, head and 
neck (H&N) and other cancers. Dose adjustment is based on body surface area 
(BSA) but wide variations occur. Pharmacokinetic (PK) dosing is suggested to 
bring plasma levels into the therapeutic range to promote fewer side effects and 
better patient outcomes. We investigated the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of the My5-FU assay for PK dose adjustment to 5-FU therapy.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the evidence on the accuracy of the My5-FU 
assay compared with gold standard methods [high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)]; the 
effectiveness of My5-FU PK dosing compared with BSA; the effectiveness of HPLC 
and/or LC-MS compared with BSA; the generalisability of published My5-FU and PK 
studies; costs of using My5-FU; to develop a cost-effectiveness model.
DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index and other 
databases between January and April 2014.
METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts with 
arbitration and consensus agreement. We undertook quality assessment. We 
reconstructed Kaplan-Meier plots for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) for comparison of BSA and PK dosing. We developed a Markov model 
to compare My5-FU with BSA dosing which modelled PFS, OS and adverse events, 
using a 2-week cycle over a 20 year time horizon with a 3.5% discount rate. 
Health impacts were evaluated from the patient perspective, while costs were 
evaluated from the NHS and Personal Social Services perspective.
RESULTS: A total of 8341 records were identified through electronic searches and 
35 and 54 studies were included in the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness reviews respectively. There was a high apparent correlation 
between My5-FU, HPLC and LC-MS/mass spectrometer but upper and lower limits of 
agreement were -18% to 30%. Median OS were estimated as 19.6 [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 17.0 to 21.0] months for PK versus 14.6 (95% CI 14.1 to 15.3) 
months for BSA for 5-FU+folinic acid (FA); and 27.4 (95% CI 23.2 to 38.8) months 
for PK versus 20.6 (95% CI 18.4 to 22.9) months for BSA for FOLFOX6 in 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). PK versus BSA studies were generalisable to 
the relevant populations. We developed cost-effectiveness models for mCRC and 
H&N cancer. The base case assumed a cost per My5-FU assay of £ 61.03. For mCRC 
for 12 cycles of a oxaliplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil and FA 
(FOLFOX) regimen, there was a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain of 0.599 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £ 4148 per QALY. Probabilistic 
and scenario analyses gave similar results. The cost-effectiveness acceptability 
curve showed My5-FU to be 100% cost-effective at a threshold of £ 20,000 per 
QALY. For H&N cancer, again, given caveats about the poor evidence base, we also 
estimated that My5-FU is likely to be cost-effective at a threshold of £ 20,000 
per QALY.
LIMITATIONS: Quality and quantity of evidence were very weak for PK versus BSA 
dosing for all cancers with no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using current 
regimens. For H&N cancer, two studies of regimens no longer in use were 
identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a linked evidence approach, My5-FU appears to be 
cost-effective at a willingness to pay of £ 20,000 per QALY for both mCRC and 
H&N cancer. Considerable uncertainties remain about evidence quality and 
practical implementation. RCTs are needed of PK versus BSA dosing in relevant 
cancers.

BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated a positive correlation with nursing home 
(NH) replacement and donepezil (DNP) administration on lifetime expectancy after 
the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the correlation with 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) remains to be elucidated, along with the 
additional impact of concomitant cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Based upon our 
recently reported health state utility values, we retrospectively analyzed the 
correlation with NH replacement and/or DNP administration on QALY and life 
expectancy in 'pure' AD (without CVD) and AD with CVD patients.
METHODS: All outpatients at the Tajiri Clinic from 1999-2012 with available 
medical records and death certificates were included. The entry criteria were a 
dementia diagnosis (DSM-IV) and diagnoses of pure AD or AD with CVD 
(NINCDS-ADRDA), medical treatment for more than 3 months, and follow up to less 
than 1 year before death. The main outcomes were lifetime expectancy (months 
between the onset of dementia and death) and QALY.
RESULTS: We identified 390 subjects, of whom 275 had the diagnosis of dementia 
that met the entry criteria, including 67 pure AD, 33 AD with CVD, and 110 VaD 
patients. For the AD patients, 52 had taken DNP and 48 had not received the drug 
due to treatment prior to the introduction of DNP in 1999 in Japan. For the pure 
AD group, there were positive correlation between NH and DNP and QALY, as well 
as lifetime expectancy. As for the AD with CVD group, only a correlation between 
DNP and lifetime expectancy was noted, with no correlation with QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: We found positive correlations between DNP administration and NH 
replacement and lifetime expectancy and QALY after the onset of AD. However, 
concomitant CVD negated such a positive correlation with QALY. The findings 
suggest that QALY in AD is affected by CVD; thus, indicating the importance of 
CVD prevention.

BACKGROUND: Malignant esophageal obstruction leads to dysphagia, deterioration 
in quality of life, and malnutrition. Traditional bedside nasogastric (NG) tube 
placement is very difficult under these circumstances. However, endoscopically 
assisted NG tube placement under fluoroscopic guidance could be an alternative 
option for establishing palliative enteral nutrition. This study aimed to 
compare the clinical outcomes of enteral tube feeding and esophageal stenting 
for patients with malignant esophageal obstruction and a short life expectancy.
METHODS: Thirty-one patients were divided into 3 groups according to their 
treatment modality: NG tube (n = 12), esophageal stent group (n = 10), and 
supportive care with nil per os (NPO) (n = 9). Enteral nutrition, clinical 
outcomes, length of hospital stay, and median survival were evaluated.
RESULTS: There were no significant baseline differences among the groups, except 
in age. The tube and stent groups had significantly higher enteral calorie 
intake (p = 0.01), higher serum albumin (p < 0.01), shorter hospital stay 
(p = 0.01), and longer median survival (p < 0.01) than the NPO group. The 
incidence of dislodgement in the tube group was significantly higher than in the 
stent group (58% vs. 20%, respectively; p = 0.01). However, stenting costs more 
than NG tube placement.
CONCLUSIONS: Palliative enteral feeding by NG tube is safe, inexpensive, and has 
a low complication rate. Endoscopically assisted NG tube placement under 
fluoroscopic guidance could be a feasible palliative option for malignant 
esophageal obstruction for patients who have a short life expectancy.

Amongst large a variety of oncological diseases, malignant gliomas represent one 
of the most severe types of tumors. They are also the most common type of the 
brain tumors and account for over half of the astrocytic tumors. According to 
different sources, the average life expectancy of patients with various 
glioblastomas varies between 10 and 12 months and that of patients with 
anaplastic astrocytic tumors between 20 and 24 months. Therefore, studies of the 
physiology of transformed glial cells are critical for the development of 
treatment methods. Modern medical approaches offer complex procedures, including 
the microsurgical tumor removal, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, supplemented 
with photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy. The most radical of them is 
surgical resection, which allows removing the largest part of the tumor, reduces 
the intracranial hypertension, and minimizes the degree of neurological deficit. 
However, complete removal of the tumor remains impossible. The main limitations 
are insufficient visualization of glioma boundaries, due to its infiltrative 
growth, and the necessity to preserve healthy tissue. This review is devoted to 
the description of advantages and disadvantages of modern intraoperative 
diagnostics of human gliomas and highlights potential perspectives for 
development of their treatment.

Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm with 
only limited epidemiologic data published so far. We aimed to analyze the 
clinical and molecular diagnostic features, and the prognosis and cumulative 
incidence of SM cases in a cohort of south-eastern Hungarian patients of 13 year 
follow up. In the period 2001-2013, 35 consecutive SM cases were diagnosed in 
our regional centre. Immunophenotype, KIT D816V mutation frequency and clinical 
characteristics, and the prognosis impact of clinical subtypes were tested and 
compared with published data. Indolent SM (ISM) was diagnosed in 14 patients, SM 
with an associated clonal hematologic non-mast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD) 
in 15 patients and aggressive SM (ASM) in 6 patients. The KIT D816V mutation was 
found in 11/14 (78%) of the ISM cases, in 12/15 (80%) of the SM-AHNMD cases and 
in 5/6 (83%) of the ASM cases. The life expectancy of ISM patients was better, 
whereas the SM-AHNMD and ASM groups exhibited a reduced median survival. The 
cumulative incidence for 13 year of the SM was 0.27/10,000. We detected lower 13 
year cumulative SM incidence than of published epidemiologic data due to in our 
analyses involved only those patients who had bone marrow biopsy and 
histopathologically confirmed SM. This clinical overview clearly showed that the 
clinical characteristics differ between ISM (UP, anaphylaxis and osteoporosis) 
and SM-AHNMD/ASM (cytopenia, eosinophilia and splenomegaly).

BACKGROUND: prospective trials that assess the effect of weight loss on 
all-cause mortality have shown controversial results. We conducted a systematic 
review of prospective studies, with a follow up ≥10y, assessing the association 
of weight loss and weight cycling with all cause- mortality.
METHODS: we searched Pubmed of prospective studies with a follow up of ≥10y, 
published from January 1st 2004 to December 31th 2014.
RESULTS: nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Five studies assessed the 
association between weight loss and mortality, two of the studies examined 
weight cycling and mortality, and two other weight loss and weight cycling with 
mortality. Weight loss increased all-cause mortality in those that assessed 
weight loss and mortality. In the two studies evaluating the association between 
weight cycling and mortality, weight cycling made no difference on mortality. In 
the two studies assessing weight loss and weight cycling, results showed weight 
cycling increased mortality in both of them, and weight loss increased mortality 
in one study.
CONCLUSION: six out of seven (≥10 y of follow up) prospective studies showed 
that weight loss was associated with increased mortality; the results from 
studies assessing weight cycling were inconsistent. None of the studies found 
evidence showing that weight loss improved life expectancy.

Publisher: Antecedentes: existe controversia sobre el efecto de la pérdida de 
peso sobre la mortalidad. Se realizó una revisión sistemática de estudios 
prospectivos, con un seguimiento ≥10 años, que evaluó el efecto de la pérdida de 
peso y los cambios de peso cíclicos con todas las causas de mortalidad. Métodos: 
se efectuó una búsqueda en PubMed, de artículos prospectivos, con un seguimiento 
> 10 años, publicados del 1 de enero de 2004 al 31 de diciembre de 2014. 
Resultados: nueve estudios cumplieron con los criterios de inclusión: cinco 
evaluaron la relación de la pérdida de peso exclusiva sobre la mortalidad, dos 
los cambios en el peso cíclicos y la mortalidad, y dos la pérdida de peso y los 
cambios en el peso cíclicos y la mortalidad. En los cinco que evaluaron la 
pérdida de peso, la mortalidad aumentó; en los dos que evaluaron cambios 
cíclicos en el peso, no se observó aumento en el riesgo de mortalidad, y en los 
dos que evaluaron pérdida de peso y cambios cíclicos en el peso, los cambios en 
el peso aumentaron el riesgo de mortalidad en ambos estudios, mientras que la 
pérdida de peso aumento el riesgo de mortalidad en un estudio. Conclusión: seis 
de los siete estudios(≥10 años de seguimiento) prospectivos mostraron que la 
pérdida de peso se asoció con aumento de la mortalidad; los resultados de los 
estudios que evaluaron cambios cíclicos de peso fueron inconsistentes. No se 
observaron evidencias de que la pérdida de peso aumente la esperanza de vida.

Ranolazine for the treatment of chronic stable angina: a cost-effectiveness 
analysis from the UK perspective.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of ranolazine when added to 
standard-of-care (SoC) antianginals compared with SoC alone in patients with 
stable coronary disease experiencing ≥3 attacks/week.
SETTING: An economic model utilising a UK health system perspective, a 1-month 
cycle-length and a 1-year time horizon.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with stable coronary disease experiencing ≥3 attacks/week 
starting in 1 of 4 angina frequency health states based on Seattle Angina 
Questionnaire Angina Frequency (SAQAF) scores (100=no; 61-99=monthly; 
31-60=weekly; 0-30=daily angina).
INTERVENTION: Ranolazine added to SoC or SoC alone. Patients were allowed to 
transition between SAQAF states (first cycle only) or death (any cycle) based on 
probabilities derived from the randomised, controlled Efficacy of Ranolazine in 
Chronic Angina trial and other studies. Patients not responding to ranolazine in 
month 1 (not improving ≥1 SAQAF health state) discontinued ranolazine and were 
assumed to behave like SoC patients.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: Costs (£2014) and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) for patients receiving and not receiving ranolazine.
RESULTS: Ranolazine patients lived a mean of 0.701 QALYs at a cost of £5208. 
Those not receiving ranolazine lived 0.662 QALYs at a cost of £5318. The 
addition of ranolazine to SoC was therefore a dominant economic strategy. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was sensitive to ranolazine cost; exceeding 
£20,000/QALY when ranolazine's cost was >£203/month. Ranolazine remained a 
dominant strategy when indirect costs were included and mortality rates were 
assumed to increase with worsening severity of SAQAF health states. Monte Carlo 
simulation found ranolazine to be a dominant strategy in ∼71% of 10,000 
iterations.
CONCLUSIONS: Although UK-specific data on ranolazine's efficacy and safety are 
lacking, our analysis suggest ranolazine added to SoC in patients with weekly or 
daily angina is likely cost-effective from a UK health system perspective.

INTRODUCTION: Smoking is a major avoidable cause of ill-health and premature 
death. Treatments that help patients successfully quit smoking have an important 
effect on health and life expectancy. Varenicline is a medication that can help 
smokers successfully quit smoking. However, there are concerns that it may cause 
adverse effects, such as increase in the occurrence of depression, self-harm and 
suicide and cardiovascular disease. In this study we aim to examine the effects 
of varenicline versus other smoking cessation pharmacotherapies on smoking 
cessation, health service use, all-cause and cause-specific mortality and 
physical and mental health conditions.
METHODS: In this project we will investigate the effects of varenicline compared 
to nicotine replacement therapies on: (1) long-term smoking cessation and 
whether these effects differ by area level deprivation; and (2) the following 
clinically-important outcomes: rate of general practice and hospital attendance; 
all-cause mortality and death due to diseases of the respiratory system and 
cardiovascular disease; and a primary care diagnosis of respiratory illness, 
myocardial infarction or depression and anxiety. The study is based on a cohort 
of patients prescribed these smoking cessation medications from the Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We will use three methods to overcome 
confounding: multivariable adjusted Cox regression, propensity score matched Cox 
regression, and instrumental variable regression. The total expected sample size 
for analysis will be at least 180,000. Follow-up will end with the earliest of 
either an 'event' or censoring due to the end of registration or death.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was not required for this study. This 
project has been approved by the CPRD's Independent Scientific Advisory 
Committee (ISAC). We will disseminate our findings via publications in 
international peer-reviewed journals and presentations at international 
conferences.

Juan, Puerto Rico.

BACKGROUND: Intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL) is a rare tumor, which is usually 
of uterine origin, characterized by intravascular nodular masses of 
histologically benign smooth muscle that may extend variable distances, 
including into the inferior vena cava, right atrium and pulmonary arteries. 
Tumors may arise from uterine leiomyoma, walls of the uterine vessel, or 
myometrium. It usually occurs at between 20-70 years of age with a median age of 
45 years. The most commonly affected women are pre-menopausal and multiparous. 
Intra-cardiac extension may represent a diagnostic challenge as it is usually 
misdiagnosed as a right atrial myxoma and may cause multiple symptoms, such as 
shortness of breath, tachycardia, chest pain, syncope, and even death.
CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 40-year-old female patient with past 
medical history of arterial hypertension, who was referred to a cardiovascular 
center due to an intra-cardiac mass found on 2D echocardiogram. The patient was 
given the rare diagnosis of intravenous leiomyomatosis of the uterus with 
extension into the gonadal veins, inferior vena cava, right atrium, right 
ventricle, and main pulmonary arteries. Imaging workup including 
trans-esophageal echocardiogram, cardiac catheterization, contrast-enhanced 
abdomen and pelvic CT scans, and cardiac MRI was performed for evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous leiomyomatosis is a rare diagnosis that merits 
consideration in a young pre-menopausal female patient with cardiac symptoms 
associated with a right atrial mass. Radiologists play a vital role in the 
diagnosis and follow-up of patients with the diagnosis of intravenous 
leiomyomatosis. Differential diagnosis includes vascular thrombus as well as 
primary and metastatic tumors. Early detection is imperative for appropriate 
treatment and surgical planning.

Exploring the Life Expectancy Increase in Poland in the Context of CVD Mortality 
Fall: The Risk Assessment Bottom-Up Approach, From Health Outcome to Policies.

Life expectancy at birth is considered the best mortality-based summary 
indicator of the health status of the population and is useful for measuring 
long-term health changes. The objective of this article was to present the 
concept of the bottom-up policy risk assessment approach, developed to identify 
challenges involved in analyzing risk factor reduction policies and in assessing 
how the related health indicators have changed over time. This article focuses 
on the reasons of the significant life expectancy prolongation in Poland over 
the past 2 decades, thus includes policy context. The methodology details a 
bottom-up risk assessment approach, a chain of relations between the health 
outcome, risk factors, and health policy, based on Risk Assessment From Policy 
to Impact Dimension project guidance. A decline in cardiovascular disease 
mortality was a key factor that followed life expectancy prolongation. Among 
basic factors, tobacco and alcohol consumption, diet, physical activity, and new 
treatment technologies were identified. Poor health outcomes of the Polish 
population at the beginning of 1990s highlighted the need of the implementation 
of various health promotion programs, legal acts, and more effective public 
health policies. Evidence-based public health policy needs translating 
scientific research into policy and practice. The bottom-up case study template 
can be one of the focal tools in this process. Accountability for the health 
impact of policies and programs and legitimization of the decisions of policy 
makers has become one of the key questions nowadays in European countries' 
decision-making process and in EU public health strategy.

BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at 
elevated risk of pneumococcal infection. A 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (PCV13) was approved for protection against invasive disease and 
pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults. This study estimated the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vaccinating COPD patients ≥50 
years old with PCV13 compared with current vaccination policy (CVP) with 
23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.
METHODS: A Markov model accounting for the risks and costs for all-cause 
non-bacteremic pneumonia (NBP) and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) was 
developed. All parameters, such as disease incidence and costs (€; 2015 values), 
were based on published data. The perspective of the analysis was that of the 
Spanish National Healthcare System, and the horizon of evaluation was lifetime 
in the base case. Vaccine effectiveness considered waning effect over time. 
Outcomes and costs were both discounted by 3% annually.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon and for a 629,747 COPD total population, PCV13 
would prevent 2224 cases of inpatient NBP, 3134 cases of outpatient NBP, and 210 
IPD extra cases in comparison with CVP. Additionally, 398 related deaths would 
be averted. The ICER was €1518 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for 
PCV13 versus CVP. PCV13 was found to be cost effective versus CVP from a 5-year 
modelling horizon (1302 inpatient NBP and 1835 outpatient NBP cases together 
with 182 deaths would be prevented [ICER €25,573/QALY]). Univariate and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: At the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay threshold of 
€30,000/QALY gained, PCV13 vaccination in COPD patients aged ≥50 years was a 
cost-effective strategy compared with CVP from 5 years to lifetime horizon in 
Spain.

BACKGROUND: The assessment of treatment success in clinical trials when multiple 
(repeated) doses (courses) are involved is quite common, for example, in the 
case of infertility treatment with assisted reproductive technology (ART), and 
medical abortion using misoprostol alone or in combination with mifepristone. 
Under these or similar circumstances, most researchers assess success using 
binomial proportions after a certain number of consecutive doses, and some have 
used survival analysis. In this paper we discuss the main problems in using 
binomial proportions to summarize (the overall) efficacy after two or more 
consecutive doses of the relevant treatment, particularly for the case of 
misoprostol in medical abortion studies. We later discuss why the survival 
analysis is best suited under these circumstances, and illustrate this by using 
simulated data.
METHODS: The formulas required for the binomial proportion and survival analysis 
(without and with competing risks) approaches are summarized and analytically 
compared. Additionally, numerical results are computed and compared between the 
two approaches, for several theoretical scenarios.
RESULTS: The main conceptual limitations of the binomial proportion approach are 
identified and discussed, caused mainly by the presence of censoring and 
competing risks, and it is demonstrated how survival analysis can solve these 
problems. In general, the binomial proportion approach tends to underestimate 
the "real" success rate, and tends to overestimate the corresponding standard 
error.
CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the rates of censored observations or competing events 
between repeated doses of the treatment, the bias of the binomial proportion 
approach as compared to the survival analysis approaches varies; however, the 
use of the binomial approach is unjustified as the survival analysis options are 
well known and available in multiple statistical packages. Our conclusions also 
apply to other situations where success is estimated after multiple (repeated) 
doses (courses) of the treatment.

High prices remain a formidable barrier for many people, especially those of low
