our institution.
METHODS: From July 1997 to December 2003, 53 consecutive patients with left 
ventricular aneurysm and VT underwent surgical ventricular restoration including 
nonguided endocardiectomy and cryoablation. Twenty-four patients had at least 
one preoperative episode of spontaneous VT, of which 8 were survivors of sudden 
cardiac death. Twenty-nine patients had inducible-only VT. In 45 patients, who 
underwent preoperative programmed stimulation, sustained uniform VT could be 
initiated. Arrhythmia control was evaluated by programmed stimulation or 
analysis of events registered by implanted defibrillators and by review of 
patient's records.
RESULTS: Early mortality was 2 of 53 (3.8%). Mean follow-up was 3.7 years. At 1, 
3, and 5 years overall actuarial survival was 94%, 80%, and 59%, respectively. 
Surgical success rate in patients with preoperative spontaneous VT was 91%. 
Inducible VT was found in 5 of 35 patients who underwent postoperative 
programmed stimulation. There was no arrhythmia-related late death and there was 
no loss to follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The Dor procedure including VT surgery is an effective treatment 
for postinfarction left ventricular aneurysm and VT and eliminates the need for 
an implantable defibrillator in most patients. Early and long-term results are 
good in terms of survival and arrhythmia control.

BACKGROUND: Optimal operative decision making in thoracic aortic aneurysms 
requires accurate information on the risk of complications during expectant 
management. Cumulative and yearly risks of rupture, dissection, and death before 
operative repair increase with increasing aortic size, but previous work has not 
addressed the impact of relative aortic size on complication rates.
METHODS: Our institutional database contains data on 805 patients followed up 
serially with thoracic aortic aneurysms. Body surface area information was 
obtained on 410 patients (257 male, 153 female). We calculated a new measure of 
relative aortic size, the "aortic size index," and examined its ability to 
predict complications in these patients.
RESULTS: Increasing aortic size index was a significant predictor of increasing 
rates of rupture (p = 0.0014) as well as the combined endpoint of rupture, 
death, or dissection (p < 0.0001). Using aortic size index, patients were 
stratified into three risk groups: less than 2.75 cm/m2 are at low risk 
(approximately 4% per year), 2.75 to 4.24 cm/m2 are at moderate risk 
(approximately 8% per year), and those above 4.25 cm/m2 are at high risk 
(approximately 20% per year).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that (1) thoracic aortic aneurysm is a lethal 
disease, (2) relative aortic size is more important than absolute aortic size in 
predicting complications, and (3) a novel measurement of relative aortic size 
allows for the stratification of patients into three levels of risk, enabling 
appropriate surgical decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Critical aortic stenosis (AS) in neonates necessitates urgent 
intervention for patient survival. The optimal treatment, however, continues to 
be controversial and still has high morbidity and mortality in many centers. 
This study examined our late outcome, risks, and reoperations after the 
treatment of critical AS in neonates.
METHODS: Sixty-six neonates (47 boys and 19 girls) underwent closed 
transventricular aortic valvotomy for critical AS between 1978 and 2000. The 
mean age at the first intervention was 15.1 +/- 19.6 days (range, 1 to 78). 
Their weight ranged from 1.4 to 6.2 kg (mean, 3.5 +/- 0.9 kg). Sixteen patients 
(23%) had isolated critical AS and normal or dilated left ventricles, and 50 
neonates (77%) had associated cardiovascular anomalies (ie, aortic annular 
hypoplasia, hypoplasia of the left ventricle, mitral valve abnormalities, and 
endocardial fibroelastosis, coarctation, or interruption of aorta).
RESULTS: The hospital mortality was 29% (19 of 66). Kaplan-Meier 5- and 15-year 
survival was 61% and 58%, respectively. The operative mortality rates were 6% in 
neonates with isolated AS and 36% in patients with complex AS. The five risk 
factors significant for mortality on univariate analysis were (1) presence of 
endocardial fibroelastosis (p = 0.05), (2) presence of hypoplastic left 
ventricle (p = 0.003), (3) presence of associated cardiovascular anomalies (p = 
0.04), (4) aortic valve annulus of less than 5.0 mm (p = 0.01), and (5) surgery 
before 1985 (p = 0.003). Of these five factors, only the presence of hypoplastic 
left ventricle (p = 0.001) and surgery before 1985 (p = 0.001) remain 
significant for mortality by multivariate analysis. At last follow-up (mean, 8.2 
+/- 6.2 years), 36 of 47 of the long-term survivors were in New York Heart 
Association functional class I and II. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed 5- and 
15-year freedom from aortic valve reoperation to be 83% and 60%, respectively. 
Univariate and multivariate analysis showed the presence of multilevel stenosis 
(p = 0.04) as the best preoperative predictor for the need for late reoperation 
in survivors.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that critical AS in neonates continues to be associated 
with significant mortality. Reintervention such as surgical and balloon 
valvotomy are usually required within 10 years of initial surgery.

Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland. hitendu.dave@kispi.unizh.ch

BACKGROUND: This paper describes a muscle-sparing, extrapleural approach to 
repair aortic coarctation, and evaluates the results with established standards.
METHODS: Forty consecutive patients with aortic coarctation (median age, 8 days; 
weight, 3.3 kg) were approached with a less invasive technique consisting of a 
short posterior thoracotomy, with only minimal (24 patients) or no (16 patients) 
division of thoracic wall muscles and a subperiosteal-extrapleural approach. 
Extended resection of the coarctation with enlargement of the distal aortic arch 
was performed in all patients. The median cross-clamp and operative times were 
22 and 90 minutes, respectively.
RESULTS: The repair was possible in all patients without needing conversion. 
There was no intraoperative or postoperative related complication. Two patients 
died early of low cardiac output as a result of ventricular fibroelastosis and 
respiratory failure. One patient died late of unrelated cause. The perioperative 
mean gradients across the neoarch were less than 5 mm Hg in all but 3 patients 
with proximal (2 patients) or mid arch (1) stenosis. The median ventilation 
time, intensive care unit stay, and hospital stay in isolated coarctation 
repairs was 2, 4.5, and 11 days, respectively. One patient had a recurrent 
stenosis at the site of surgical repair. Two patients underwent successful 
balloon dilatation, and 2 had surgical enlargement plasty of the proximal aortic 
arch at the time of intracardiac repair. None of the patients required chronic 
antihypertensive medication. At 29 months, freedom from reintervention on the 
isthmus and arch plus isthmus was 97.1% and 89.7%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A muscle-sparing, extrapleural approach for the repair of aortic 
coarctation is possible and provides results similar to conventional techniques. 
The approach reduces postoperative morbidity related to division of thoracic 
wall muscles and handling of the lung, restores a normal intercostal space, and 
produces superior cosmetic results, while at the same time leading to early and 
permanent relief of proximal hypertension.

BACKGROUND: We have tried to clarify the prognostic significance of metastasis 
to the highest mediastinal (HM) lymph node in patients with N2 lung cancer who 
underwent complete dissection of superior mediastinal (including HM) lymph 
nodes.
METHODS: This study analyzed 53 patients with N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer who 
underwent surgical procedures such as lobectomy plus hilar and mediastinal node 
dissection (T4, neoadjuvant therapy cases were excluded). For patients whose 
cancer was in the left lung, we performed surgery through the median sternotomy 
in order to dissect superior mediastinal nodes. The clinicopathologic records of 
the patients were examined for prognostic factors such as age, sex, side, 
histology, tumor location, tumor size, clinical node (cN) number, preoperative 
serum carcinoembryonic antigen level, number of metastatic stations, and HM 
lymph node involvement.
RESULTS: A univariate analysis showed that tumor size (T1/T2-3), cN factor 
(cN1-2/cN0), N2 level (multiple/single), and metastasis to the HM node were 
significant prognostic factors. In the multivariate analysis, metastasis to the 
HM lymph node remained a significant prognostic factor (p = 0.026). The 3-year 
survival rates were 52% in patients without metastasis to the HM lymph node and 
21% in patients with metastasis to the HM lymph node (p < 0.001). Furthermore, 
when HM nodal involvement was absent, the 5-year survival rate was 33% even in 
patients with multilevel N2 status, 45% in patients with cN1-2 status, and 47% 
in patients with pT2-3 tumor status.
CONCLUSIONS: Highest mediastinal lymph node involvement is prognostic of highly 
advanced N2 disease resulting in poor outcome. The results also suggest that 
patients with no involvement of the HM lymph node can experience acceptable 
postoperative outcomes even if they have multilevel N2 status, positive cN 
status, or T2-3 tumor status.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze on a multivariate basis the 
prognostic significance of pre-resection and post-resection pleural lavage 
cytologies in surgically resected primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patients, in relation to pathologic TNM factors in a large cohort of almost 
1,200 patients.
METHODS: From August 1992 through March 2001, pleural lavage cytology (PLC) was 
performed in 1,214 NSCLC patients without pleural effusion or dissemination 
undergoing pulmonary resection. The cytologic evaluation was classified into 
three categories: negative, suggestive, and positive. To investigate the impact 
on patient survival, PLC results were analyzed with conventional 
clinicopathologic factors.
RESULTS: Definitive pre-resection PLC result was obtained in 1,194 patients and 
38 had a positive result. The 5-year survival rates were 27% if pre-resection 
PLC was positive and 71% if negative. Of 1,198 patients 54 had a positive 
post-resection PLC result. The 5-year survival rates were 10% if post-resection 
PLC was positive and 73% if negative. On multivariate analysis, post-resection 
PLC was an independent prognostic factor as significant as established 
clinicopathologic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-resection and post-resection PLC should be recognized as an 
essential prognostic factor and should be performed in NSCLC patients without 
pleural effusion and dissemination. Post-PLC, compared with pre-PLC, had a 
greater and independent impact on survival and needs to be incorporated in the 
pathologic staging of NSCLC in the future.

BACKGROUND: We present a summary report evaluating the efficacy of lung volume 
reduction surgery (LVRS) in patients with advanced emphysema in the Canadian 
setting.
METHODS: Quality of Life measures assessed the efficacy of adding LVRS to best 
medical care including rehabilitation in this blinded randomized multicentered 
controlled trial with 2 years of follow-up. Health utility and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY) were outcomes central to our economic assessment.
RESULTS: None of the 32 patients randomized to the LVRS arm or 30 patients in 
the best medical care (BMC) arm crossed-over and no patients were lost to 
follow-up. Overall surgical mortality was 16% at 2 years while the overall 
medical mortality was 13% (p = 0.914). There were no 30-day postoperative deaths 
but 2 deaths (6%) occurred within 90 days of randomization. Surgery reduced the 
residual volume measured at 6 months by 23% (5,385 mL to 4,322 mL, p = 0.007). 
There was an increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 30% (265 
mL, p = 0.013) from baseline, an improvement in the six minute walk test (6MWT) 
of 78 meters (p = 0.045), and an increase in Health Utility Index 3 (HUI3) which 
peaked at 6 months with a difference of 0.16 (p = 0.129). There was a gain in 
QALYs of 0.21 (p = 0.19) in the LVRS-arm over the BMC-arm. The LVRS costs an 
additional 28,119 Canadian dollars (CAD) compared with BMC or 133,900 CAD/QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of LVRS to best medical care including pulmonary 
rehabilitation improves pulmonary function, exercise activity, and quality of 
life in selected patients with advanced emphysema. Cost is high but in keeping 
with other treatment modalities currently available.

Preventing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastrointestinal 
toxicity: are older strategies more cost-effective in the general population?

OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative cost-effectiveness of five gastroprotective 
strategies for patients in the general population not judged to be at high 
gastrointestinal (GI) risk requiring regular traditional (t) non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for over 3 weeks: tNSAID/H(2) receptor 
antagonists (H(2)RAs); tNSAID/proton pump inhibitors (PPIs); tNSAID/misoprostol; 
COX-2 preferential NSAIDs or COX-2-specific NSAIDs (COXIBs).
METHODS: A systematic review of outcomes and UK cost data were combined in an 
incremental economic analysis. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 
generated for quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: Cost-utility analysis showed a tNSAID with a H(2)RA is safer and less 
costly than tNSAIDs alone, and equally effective and less costly than COXIBs. 
tNSAID/misoprostol was also dominated by tNSAID/H(2)RA due to withdrawal caused 
by side-effects reducing overall health status. The incremental increase in 
QALYs gained by using COXIBs instead of tNSAID/H(2)RA would cost 670,000 pounds 
per QALY gained. The incremental increase in QALYs gained by using tNSAID/PPI 
instead of COXIBs would cost 26,000 pounds per QALY gained. If the 
decision-maker will pay up to 140,000 pounds per extra QALY, the optimal 
strategy is tNSAID/H(2)RA. If the decision-maker will pay over this the optimal 
strategy is tNSAID/PPI.
CONCLUSION: The economic analysis suggests that there may be a case for 
prescribing H(2)RAs in all patients requiring NSAIDs. Our recommendations are 
tentative due to the quality of the data available and the assumptions we have 
had to make in our model, and it is possible that other strategies may be 
preferred in patients with higher baseline GI risk.

The microRNA lin-4 and its target, the putative transcription factor lin-14, 
control the timing of larval development in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we 
report that lin-4 and lin-14 also regulate life span in the adult. Reducing the 
activity of lin-4 shortened life span and accelerated tissue aging, whereas 
overexpressing lin-4 or reducing the activity of lin-14 extended life span. 
Lifespan extension conferred by a reduction in lin-14 was dependent on the 
DAF-16 and HSF-1 transcription factors, suggesting that the lin-4-lin-14 pair 
affects life span through the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 pathway. This 
work reveals a role for microRNAs and developmental timing genes in life-span 
regulation.

Physical activity and life expectancy with and without diabetes: life table 
analysis of the Framingham Heart Study.

Rotterdam, Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE: Physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of developing 
diabetes and with reduced mortality among diabetic patients. However, the 
effects of physical activity on the number of years lived with and without 
diabetes are unclear. Our aim is to calculate the differences in life expectancy 
with and without type 2 diabetes associated with different levels of physical 
activity.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from the Framingham Heart Study, we 
constructed multistate life tables starting at age 50 years for men and women. 
Transition rates by level of physical activity were derived for three 
transitions: nondiabetic to death, nondiabetic to diabetes, and diabetes to 
death. We used hazard ratios associated with different physical activity levels 
after adjustment for age, sex, and potential confounders.
RESULTS: For men and women with moderate physical activity, life expectancy 
without diabetes at age 50 years was 2.3 (95% CI 1.2-3.4) years longer than for 
subjects in the low physical activity group. For men and women with high 
physical activity, these differences were 4.2 (2.9-5.5) and 4.0 (2.8-5.1) years, 
respectively. Life expectancy with diabetes was 0.5 (-1.0 to 0.0) and 0.6 (-1.1 
to -0.1) years less for moderately active men and women compared with their 
sedentary counterparts. For high activity, these differences were 0.1 (-0.7 to 
0.5) and 0.2 (-0.8 to 0.3) years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Moderately and highly active people have a longer total life 
expectancy and live more years free of diabetes than their sedentary 
counterparts but do not spend more years with diabetes.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative condition that can result in 
cognitive and physical disability and shortened life expectancy. However, 
population-based information is lacking regarding the mortality burden from MS 
in the United States. We investigated trends in MS mortality rates and examined 
important comorbidities in the United States from 1990 to 2001. MS deaths were 
matched by age, sex, and race/ethnicity with randomly selected deaths from other 
conditions for matched odds ratio comparisons. The overall age-adjusted 
mortality rate from MS was 1.44/100,000 population. MS mortality rates increased 
throughout the study period. MS mortality rates were higher in whites than in 
any other racial/ethnic group, followed by Blacks, Hispanics, American 
Indians/Alaska Natives, and Asians and Pacific Islanders. Observed mortality 
rates were more than 10 times lower in Asians and Pacific Islanders than in 
whites. The odds of pressure ulcers, urinary tract infections, and 
pneumonia/influenza being reported on the death certificate were higher in MS 
deaths than in matched controls.

Energy, quiescence and the cellular basis of animal life spans.

Animals are routinely faced with harsh environmental conditions in which 
insufficient energy is available to grow and reproduce. Many animals adapt to 
this challenge by entering a dormant, or quiescent state. In some animals, such 
as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, quiescence is coincident with increased 
stress resistance and longevity. Here we review evidence that the rules of life 
span extension established in C. elegans may be generally true of most animals. 
That is, that the rate of animal aging correlates inversely with cellular 
resistance to physiological stress, particularly oxidative stress, and that 
stress resistance is co-regulated with the quiescence adaptation (where the 
latter occurs). We discuss evidence for highly conserved intracellular 
signalling pathways involved in energy sensing that are sensitive to aspects of 
mitochondrial energy transduction and can be modulated in response to energetic 
flux. We provide a broad overview of the current knowledge of the relationships 
between energy, metabolism and life span.

Our aim was to assess the utility of surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic 
aneurysm (RAAA) using the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in a 
retrospective study with cross-sectional quality-of-life (QoL) evaluation. 
During a 7-year period up to 2002, 242 of 269 (90%) patients with RAAA underwent 
surgery. Survivors were sent the EQ-5D self-administered questionnaire to assess 
their long-term outcome. EQ-5D single index values were calculated for each 
survivor and combined with age- and sex-adjusted Finnish life tables to obtain 
QALY estimates. Total hospital mortality (90-day) and operative mortality 
(30-day) were 140 of 269 (52.0%) and 106 of 242 (43.8%), respectively. Of the 
129 surviving patients, 111 were available for QoL evaluation. The response rate 
was 85%. The mean (range) number of QALYs after RAAA was 4.1 (0-30.9) for all 
and 8.5 (0.2-30.9) for hospital survivors. Young age and low Glasgow Aneurysm 
Score were associated with a high number of QALYs irrespective of the 
statistical method used for analysis. Successful repair of RAAA was able to lend 
considerable benefit as measured by QALYs.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Longer life expectancy has created an increasing demand for 
surgical care of the elderly. Abdominal surgical emergencies are potentially 
serious and life-threatening conditions for this group of patients. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the records of elderly patients undergoing emergency 
surgical treatment.
METHODS: A total of 181 patients aged 60 years and above who had undergone 
emergency surgical interventions were retrospectively analysed according to 
demographic features, indications for emergency surgery, postoperative clinical 
course and outcome.
RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of the patients were male, with an average age of 
70.3 (range 60-95) years. Octogenarians constituted 19% of our series. Causes of 
surgical emergency were acute cholecystitis (31.5%), strangulated hernia 
(18.2%), hollow viscus perforation (17.1%), bowel obstruction (10.5%), acute 
mesenteric ischaemia (9.4%), acute appendicitis (8.3%) and upper 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage (5%). Gallstones had been previously detected by 
ultrasound in 25 (45.5%) of 55 patients with acute calculous cholecystitis. 
Thirty (93.8%) of 32 patients were aware of their external hernias prior to 
incarceration. Twenty seven patients (14.4%) died in the early postoperative 
period, with acute mesenteric vascular occlusion being the leading cause of 
death: A higher mortality rate was noted in mesenteric ischaemia (76.5%), 
gastrointestinal bleeding (22.2%) and in perforation (19.4%) cases, being 36.8% 
(21/57) in patients with these three severe conditions and 4.8% (6/124) in the 
remaining patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute calculous cholecystitis and external strangulated hernias, 
which are generally preventable, were the most common surgical emergencies. 
Surgical treatment of acute mesenteric ischaemia, gastrointestinal haemorrhage 
and peritonitis secondary to free perforation had a worse prognosis in older 
patients.

Secular trends in age at menarche among Caboclo populations from Pará, Amazonia, 
Brazil: 1930-1980.

Janeiro, Brazil.

The present study is part of a large research project on growth, development, 
nutrition, and health of Caboclo populations from the Brazilian Amazon. The aim 
of this paper is to analyze the age of menarche in adolescents (N=164) and adult 
women (219) in the studied populations. Caboclo are admixed rural, peasant 
groups that live along the Amazon river and its tributaries, and there are few 
previous studies about them. Probit analysis of the status quo data yielded a 
median age at menarche of 12.29+/-1.76 years. The retrospective method was 
applied to recall data of the 77 post-menarcheal adolescents, yielding an 
average of 13.06+/-1.27 years. Number of children in the family did not show any 
statistical influence on age at menarche in any age group. In adult women, age 
at menarche decreased from 14.50 in those born in 1930 to 12.88 for those born 
in 1980 (F=4.371, P=0.001). The downward trend found was, on average, 0.237 year 
per decade in the study period. The median age at menarche in the adolescents 
(12.29 years) is one of the lowest values found for Central and South American 
populations. In the ecological context, a low age at menarche could be an 
adaptive advantage because it provides a greater chance for reproduction at a 
young age in an environment where, until recently, life expectancy was low. As 
has been reported for other developing countries, the change found in age at 
menarche in the women born from the 1930s to the 1980s is likely to be related 
to changes in health and nutritional factors that occurred in Brazil because 
this country experienced significant improvement in living standards related to 
education, vaccination, and health conditions, which, although not equally, 
reached all regions after the 1960s.

The biggest bang for the buck or bigger bucks for the bang: the fallacy of the 
cost-effectiveness threshold.

Birch S(1), Gafni A.

It has been suggested that scepticism among decision-makers about using 
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is caused in part by the low level of the 
cost-effectiveness "thresholds" in the economic evaluation literature. This has 
led Ubel and colleagues to call for higher threshold values of US$200,000 or 
more per quality-adjusted life-year. We show that these arguments fail to 
identify the objective of CEA and hence do not consider whether or how the 
threshold relates to this objective. We show that incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) cannot be used to identify an efficient use of resources--the 
"biggest bang for the bucks"--allocated to health care. On the contrary, the 
practical consequence of using the ICER approach is shown to be an increase in 
health care expenditures, or "bigger bucks for making a bang", without any 
evidence of the bang being bigger (i.e. that this leads to an increase in 
benefits to the population). We present an alternative approach that provides an 
unambiguous method of determining whether a new intervention leads to an 
increase in health gains from whatever resources are to be made available to 
health care decision-makers.

Hill, 27599, USA. Thomas_Stinchcombe@med.unc.edu

BACKGROUND: Poor performance status patients with advanced non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) have frequently been excluded from clinical trials due to the 
perception that they would have excessive treatment-related toxicity and a 
limited life expectancy.
METHODS: A retrospective review of two multicenter trials centered at the 
University of North Carolina of patients who were treated with platinum-based 
chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC was conducted. Patients were divided into two 
subgroups based on Karnofsky performance status (KPS). Patients with a KPS = 70 
were considered to have poor performance status, while patients with a KPS > or 
=80 were considered to have good performance status.
RESULTS: Of the 387 patients, 19% (n = 73) had a poor performance status. The 
response rate (complete and partial responses) was similar between the two 
sub-groups (26% versus 28%); however, there was a difference in survival (p = 
0.0004, log-rank test) between the groups. The median survival and 1-year 
survival rate for the poor performance status patients was 4.9 months and 21%, 
while the good performance status patients had a median survival of 8.4 months 
and a 1-year survival rate of 31%. The rate of National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) toxicities was similar between the two groups (p 
= 0.33). The percentage of patients receiving <4 cycles of therapy in the poor 
and good performance status was 55 and 39%, respectively (p = 0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with poor performance status treated with platinum based 
chemotherapy have a similar rate of toxicity compared to good performance status 
patients. Their overall survival was lower despite a similar response to 
chemotherapy.

One of the pioneers of open chest cardiac massage was Cemil Topuzlu Pasha, in 
Turkey. He presented his experience in open heart cardiac massage in several 
papers published in Ottoman and French and German. On 27 August 1903 one of his 
patients undergoing external urethrotomy under chloroform anaesthesia developed 
cardiac arrest and he performed open chest cardiac massage. He reported his 
approach to this event and discussed the literature regarding resuscitation 
available at the beginning of 20th century. Meanwhile he had defined "Do Not 
Resuscitate" code in cases involving serious heart disease and other diseases 
where life expectancy is very short. The Ottoman version of his report is 
translated in this paper.

[Gender-specific health reporting in the Bodenseekreis: future theme of " health 
in boys and men"].

Population prognoses predict a far over-proportional increase in the number of 
male seniors, entailing substantial implications for the planning of health 
supply and care, as well as various possibilities to intervene preventively by 
specific risk avoidance or boosting health responsibility. In the future men's 
health and male-specific health reporting will become eminently important. A 
gender-specific life table analysis for the years 1998 - 2002 shows which causes 
of death are more responsible for loss of life expectancy of men compared to 
women in both the Bodenseekreis and Baden-Württemberg. Baden-Württemberg and the 
Bodenseekreis are regions with a well above-average life expectancy compared to 
other regions in Germany. The average life expectancy in Baden-Württemberg in 
the year 2000 amounted to 82 years (Bodenseekreis: 82.2) in women, and 76.4 
years (Bodenseekreis: 77.3) in men. Among the main causes for the 5.6 year 
difference in life expectancy are cardiovascular diseases, cancer illnesses, 
traffic accidents and suicide. These groups of causes of death explain the major 
part of the difference in average life expectancy. An analysis of death risks 
specific to age and gender shows some promising approaches for health promotion 
and prevention based on identification of critical phases of life. In this case, 
special attention should be paid to infancy, as examinations made within the 
scope of enrolment at schools identify considerable differences in the 
prevalence of various disturbances. However, early adulthood and old age also 
prove to be important periods concerning men-specific interventions. The 
presented results show first possible starting points which, however, should 
above all make a contribution to the establishment of the topic of men's health 
as a focus on gender-specific health reporting, health promotion and prevention. 
The described target group for health promotion and prevention is, on the one 
hand, sufficiently large, on the other hand, sufficiently disadvantaged in terms 
of health to demand more attention in the future.

Diabetes mellitus affects approximately 171 million individuals worldwide. The 
costs of the adult form of diabetic mellitus account for up to 6% of total 
health care expenditures in industrialized countries. About 25% of these 
diabetics develop disabling and most painful foot complications accounting for 
about 17% of the direct lifetime costs. Diabetic foot prevention programs have 
been recently introduced in some Austrian federal states to meet the diabetic 
health targets of the Austrian Health Plan and the St. Vincent Declaration. We 
developed a new age-group specific Markov model combined with a Monte Carlo 
simulation model to help policymakers analyze the cost-effectiveness of such 
programs compared to the status quo in terms of incremental costs per 
quality-adjusted life years gained (QALY). The Markov model revealed that 
diabetic foot prevention programs were cost saving when targeted at patients at 
high risk and mainly cost-effective when targeted at patients with mild 
symptoms. The Monte Carlo simulation showed that only large scope prevention 
programs would fulfill the specified reductions in the number of diabetic foot 
complications as defined in the Austrian Health Plan and the St. Vincent 
Declaration. Our results clearly indicate the enormous impact of diabetic foot 
prevention programs.

Obesity and cardiovascular disease: pathophysiology, evaluation, and effect of 
weight loss: an update of the 1997 American Heart Association Scientific 
Statement on Obesity and Heart Disease from the Obesity Committee of the Council 
on Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Metabolism.

Poirier P, Giles TD, Bray GA, Hong Y, Stern JS, Pi-Sunyer FX, Eckel RH; American 
Heart Association; Obesity Committee of the Council on Nutrition, Physical 
Activity, and Metabolism.

Obesity is becoming a global epidemic in both children and adults. It is 
associated with numerous comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), 
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, certain cancers, and sleep apnea/sleep-disordered 
breathing. In fact, obesity is an independent risk factor for CVD, and CVD risks 
have also been documented in obese children. Obesity is associated with an 
increased risk of morbidity and mortality as well as reduced life expectancy. 
Health service use and medical costs associated with obesity and related 
diseases have risen dramatically and are expected to continue to rise. Besides 
an altered metabolic profile, a variety of adaptations/alterations in cardiac 
structure and function occur in the individual as adipose tissue accumulates in 
excess amounts, even in the absence of comorbidities. Hence, obesity may affect 
the heart through its influence on known risk factors such as dyslipidemia, 
hypertension, glucose intolerance, inflammatory markers, obstructive sleep 
apnea/hypoventilation, and the prothrombotic state, in addition to 
as-yet-unrecognized mechanisms. On the whole, overweight and obesity predispose 
to or are associated with numerous cardiac complications such as coronary heart 
disease, heart failure, and sudden death because of their impact on the 
cardiovascular system. The pathophysiology of these entities that are linked to 
obesity will be discussed. However, the cardiovascular clinical evaluation of 
obese patients may be limited because of the morphology of the individual. In 
this statement, we review the available evidence of the impact of obesity on CVD 
with emphasis on the evaluation of cardiac structure and function in obese 
patients and the effect of weight loss on the cardiovascular system.

Rethinking the Hispanic paradox: death rates and life expectancy for US 
non-Hispanic White and Hispanic populations.

OBJECTIVES: We examined the "Hispanic paradox," whereby persons of Hispanic 
origin seemed to experience lower mortality than the non-Hispanic White 
population. This paradox coincided with a change from the classification of 
deaths and population by Spanish surname to the use of Hispanic-origin questions 
in the census and vital statistics.
METHODS: To estimate US Hispanic and non-Hispanic White mortality, we applied a 
familiar relation between death rates for population subgroups to Hispanic and 
non-Hispanic White population death rates. We calculated age-specific death 
rates for the Hispanic population and the non-Hispanic White population and 
computed life tables for each. Result. For Texas between 1980 (surname) and 1990 
(origin), the change in Hispanic deaths in persons aged 65 years or older was 
only half as great as the change in population size, implying a relative 
omission of 15% to 20% of deaths. By a different approach, the life tables for 
the US Hispanic and non-Hispanic White populations pointed to a similar 
omission.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no "Hispanic paradox." The Hispanic paradox described in 
past research derives from inconsistencies in counts of Hispanic-origin deaths 
and populations.

Fourteen patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were treated on a 
Phase II trial with imatinib. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed 
RCC, metastatic and measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST), Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of at least 70%, life 
expectancy of more than 3 months, and adequate hematological, renal, and liver 
function. Imatinib was given orally at a dose of 400 mg bid. The most common 
toxicities were Grade II/III nausea (28%) and Grade II renal insufficiency 
(14%). All patients had tumor tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for KIT 
protein (CD117, DAKO). One tumor (7%) demonstrated strong, diffuse expression 
and the rest were negative. No complete or partial responses were observed in 12 
evaluable patients treated with imatinib.

Sexual dysfunction related to the treatment of young women with breast cancer.

Bakewell RT(1), Volker DL.

Author information:
(1)Oncology Hematology West, Omaha, NE, USA. rosiegeoff@msn.com

Women have a 13.4% chance of developing breast cancer over their lifetime, and 
an estimated 60,000 women aged 20-50 will develop breast cancer in 2005. 
Surgical, radiologic, and chemotherapeutic treatments used to treat breast 
cancer can alter women's body image and menopausal status, ultimately affecting 
sexual health. A diagnosis of breast cancer is more traumatic for young women 
because of psychosocial concerns, side effects of treatment, and a potentially 
shortened life expectancy. Alterations in sexual health interfere with intimate 
relationships. Nurses can play a pivotal role in improving the sexual health of 
young women with breast cancer. This article explores the potential side effects 
of treatment that can affect sexual health, the unique needs of young women, and 
nursing interventions that systematically address sexual health concerns.

Cost-effectiveness of alternative blood-screening strategies for West Nile Virus 
in the United States.

BACKGROUND: West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in the US, varying seasonally and 
by geographic region. WNV can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and mandatory 
screening of blood for WNV was recently introduced throughout the US. Guidelines 
for selecting cost-effective strategies for screening blood for WNV do not 
exist.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis for screening 
blood for WNV using a computer-based mathematical model, and using data from 
prospective studies, retrospective studies, and published literature. For three 
geographic areas with varying WNV-transmission intensity and length of 
transmission season, the model was used to estimate lifetime costs, 
quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
associated with alternative screening strategies in a target population of 
blood-transfusion recipients. We compared the status quo (baseline screening 
using a donor questionnaire) to several strategies which differed by nucleic 
acid testing of either pooled or individual samples, universal versus targeted 
screening of donations designated for immunocompromised patients, and seasonal 
versus year-long screening. In low-transmission areas with short WNV seasons, 
screening by questionnaire alone was the most cost-effective strategy. In areas 
with high levels of WNV transmission, seasonal screening of individual samples 
and restricting screening to blood donations designated for immunocompromised 
recipients was the most cost-effective strategy. Seasonal screening of the 
entire recipient pool added minimal clinical benefit, with incremental
