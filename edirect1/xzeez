BACKGROUND: Abrocitinib improved signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe atopic 
dermatitis (AD) at Weeks 12 and 16 in phase 3 studies, with a manageable safety 
profile. Patient-reported outcomes with long-term abrocitinib treatment were not 
reported.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient-reported outcomes with long-term abrocitinib 
treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe AD.
METHODS: JADE EXTEND (NCT03422822) is an ongoing, phase 3, long-term extension 
study that enrolled patients from previous abrocitinib AD trials. This analysis 
includes patients from the phase 3 trials JADE MONO-1 (NCT03349060), JADE MONO-2 
(NCT03575871) and JADE COMPARE (NCT03720470) who completed the full treatment 
period of placebo or abrocitinib (200 or 100 mg once daily) and subsequently 
entered JADE EXTEND and were randomised to receive once-daily abrocitinib 200 or 
100 mg. Patient-reported endpoints to Week 48 included the proportion of 
patients who achieved Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores of 0/1 (no 
effect of AD on quality of life [QoL]) and a ≥4-point improvement in 
Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) score (clinically meaningful 
improvement). Data cut-off: April 22, 2020.
RESULTS: Baseline DLQI mean scores were 15.4 and 15.3 in the abrocitinib 200- 
and 100-mg groups, respectively, which corresponded to a 'very large effect' on 
QoL; at Week 48, mean DLQI scores were lower with abrocitinib 200 mg (4.6; 
'small effect' on QoL) and abrocitinib 100 mg (5.9; 'moderate effect' on QoL). 
Baseline POEM mean scores were 20.4 and 20.5 in the abrocitinib 200- and 100-mg 
groups, respectively; at Week 48, mean POEM scores were 8.2 and 11.0. Week 48 
patient-reported responses with abrocitinib 200 mg and abrocitinib 100 mg were 
44% and 34% for DLQI 0/1, and 90% and 77% for a ≥4-point reduction in POEM 
score.
CONCLUSION: In patients with moderate-to-severe AD, long-term abrocitinib 
treatment resulted in clinically meaningful improvement in patient-reported 
symptoms of AD, including QoL.

RNAi targeting the electron transport chain has been proven to prolong life span 
in many different species, and experiments specifically with Drosophila 
melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have shown a distinct role for neurons. 
To determine which subset of neurons is implicated in this life span extension, 
we used the GAL4/UAS system to activate RNAi against genes of Complex I and 
Complex V. We found life span extension of 18-24% with two glutamate neuron (D42 
and VGlut) GAL4 lines. We used the GAL80 system to determine if the overlapping 
set of glutamate neurons in these two GAL4 lines imparts the life span 
extension. Limiting GAL4 activity to non-VGlut glutamate neurons in the D42 
background failed to extend life span, suggesting that glutamate neurons have an 
important role in aging. Interestingly, RNAi of the electron transport chain in 
D42 glutamate neurons also caused an increase in daytime and nighttime sleep and 
a decrease in nighttime locomotor activity. Changes to sleep patterns and 
prolonged life span were not accompanied by any changes in female fertility or 
response to starvation. Our findings demonstrate that a small subset of neurons 
can control life span, and further studies can look into the contributions made 
by glutamate neurons.

INTRODUCTION: Full-endoscopic lumbar discectomy (FELD) is a type of minimally 
invasive spinal surgery for lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Sufficient evidence 
exists to recommend FELD as an alternative to standard open microdiscectomy, and 
some patients prefer FELD due to its minimally invasive nature. However, in the 
Republic of Korea, the National Health Insurance System (NHIS) controls the 
reimbursement and use of supplies for FELD, but FELD is not currently reimbursed 
by the NHIS. Nonetheless, FELD has been performed upon patients' request, but 
providing FELD for patients' sake is inherently an unstable arrangement in the 
absence of a practical reimbursement system. The purpose of this study was to 
conduct a cost-utility analysis of FELD to suggest appropriate reimbursements.
METHOD: This study was a subgroup analysis of prospectively collected data 
including 28 patients who underwent FELD. All patients were NHIS beneficiaries 
and followed a uniform clinical pathway. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
were assessed with a utility score using the EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) 
instrument. The costs included direct medical costs incurred at the hospital for 
2 years and the price of the electrode ($700), although it was not reimbursed. 
The costs and QALYs gained were used to calculate the cost per QALY gained.
RESULT: Patients' mean age was 43 years and one-third (32%) were women. L4-5 was 
the most common surgical level (20/28, 71%) and extrusion was the most common 
type of LDH (14, 50%). Half of the patients (15, 54%) had jobs with an 
intermediate level of activity. The preoperative EQ-5D utility score was 
0.48±0.19. Pain, disability, and the utility score significantly improved 
starting 1 month postoperatively. The average EQ-5D utility score during 2 years 
after FELD was estimated as 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78-0.85). For 2 years, the mean 
direct costs were $3,459 and the cost per QALY gained was $5,241.
CONCLUSION: The cost-utility analysis showed a quite reasonable cost per QALY 
gained for FELD. A comprehensive range of surgical options should be provided to 
patients, for which a practical reimbursement system is a prerequisite.

OBJECTIVE: The study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of a personalised 
telehealth intervention to manage chronic disease in the long run.
METHOD: The Personalised Health Care (PHC) pilot study was a randomised trial 
with an economic evaluation alongside over 12 months. From a health service 
perspective, the primary analysis compared the costs and effectiveness of PHC 
telehealth monitoring with usual care. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
was calculated based on costs and health-related quality of life. The PHC 
intervention was implemented in the Barwon Health region, Geelong, Australia, 
for patients with a diagnosis of COPD and/or diabetes who had a high likelihood 
of hospital readmission over 12 months.
RESULTS: When compared to usual care at 12 months, the PHC intervention cost 
AUD$714 extra per patient (95%CI -4879; 6308) with a significant improvement of 
0.09 in health-related quality of life (95%CI: 0.05; 0.14). The probability of 
PHC being cost-effective by 12 months was close to 65%, at willingness to pay a 
threshold of AUD$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year.
CONCLUSION: Benefits of PHC to patients and the health system at 12 months 
translated to a gain in quality-adjusted life years with a non-significant cost 
difference between the intervention and control groups. Given the relatively 
high set-up costs of the PHC intervention, the program may need to be offered to 
a larger population to achieve cost-effectiveness. Long-term follow-up is 
required to assess the real health and economic benefits over time.

PURPOSE: To investigate whether the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the 
patients who underwent bariatric surgery could be predicted using their baseline 
information.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who received bariatric surgery in Sweden 
between January 1, 2011 and March 31, 2019 were obtained from the Scandinavian 
Obesity Surgery Registry (SOReg). Baseline information included patients' 
sociodemographic characteristics, details regarding the procedure, and 
postsurgical conditions. QALYs were assessed by the SF-6D at follow-up years 1 
and 2. The general and regularized linear regression models were used to predict 
postoperative QALYs.
RESULTS: All regression models demonstrated satisfactory and comparable 
performance in predicting QALYs at follow-up year 1, with R2 and relative root 
mean squared error (RRMSE) values of about 0.57 and 9.6%, respectively. The 
performance of the general linear regression model increased with the number of 
variables; however, the improvement was ignorable when the number of variables 
was more than 30 and 50 for follow-up years 1 and 2, respectively. Although 
minor L1 and L2 regularization provided better prediction ability, the 
improvement was negligible when the number of variables was more than 20. All 
the models showed poorer performance for predicting QALYs at follow-up year 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient characteristics before bariatric surgery including health 
related quality of life, age, sex, BMI, postoperative complications within six 
weeks, and smoking status, may be adequate in predicting their postoperative 
QALYs after one year. Understanding these factors can help identify individuals 
who require more personalized and intensive support before, during, and after 
surgery.

BACKGROUND: The under-five mortality rate is a reliable indicator of a country's 
general level of development and the wellbeing of its children. Life expectancy 
is a good indicator of a population's standard of living.
OBJECTIVES: To identify Socio-demographic and Environmental determinants of 
under-five child mortality in Ethiopia.
METHODS: A national representative cross sectional study and a quantitative 
study were conducted among 5753 households selected based on 2019 Mini-Ethiopian 
Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS-2019) data. The analysis was done using 
STATA version 14 statistical software. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were 
used. To assess the determinants of under-five child mortality in multivariate 
analysis, p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and 
odds ratios with 95% CI (confidence interval) were used.
RESULTS: A total of 5,753 children were included in the study. Sex of the head 
of the household being female (AOR = 2:350, 95% CI: 1.310, 4.215), the U5CM for 
being their mother were currently married (AOR = 2:094, 95% CI: 1.076, 4.072), 
The odds of U5CM was less by 80% (AOR = 1.797, 95% CI: 1.159-2.782) with the 
number of under-five children at the household born 2-4th order as compared to 
those children born on the first order. For the mothers visit anti natal care 
four and above visit (AOR = 1:803, 95% CI: 1.032, 3.149), for the way of 
delivery (AOR = 0:478, 95% CI: 0.233, 0.982).
CONCLUSION: Multivariate logistic analysis reflected that way of delivery, 
mothers had being currently marred, sex of the head of the household and number 
of antenatal care visit were found to be significant predictors of under-five 
child mortality. So, government policy, nongovernmental organizations, and all 
concerned bodies should be focused on the major determinants of under-five child 
mortality and put in a lot more effort to reduce under-five child mortality.

BACKGROUND: The burden of non-communicable diseases and cognitive impairment 
exhibit a linear rise in sub-Saharan Africa due to the increase in life 
expectancy. Non-communicable diseases like diabetes mellitus and hypertension 
increase the risk for cognitive impairment. To improve our understanding of the 
underpinnings of the cognitive impairment screening, this study explored the 
barriers and facilitators of routine cognitive impairment screening in a primary 
healthcare setting guided by the Capacity, Opportunity, Motivation Behavioral 
change (COM-B) model.
METHODS: This was a descriptive qualitative study with primary healthcare 
providers who provide care to older adults with diabetes mellitus and 
hypertension at three primary healthcare centers in Mbarara district 
southwestern Uganda. In-depth interviews were conducted using a semi structured 
interview guide. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and 
analyzed using the framework approach along the COM-B components. Each COM-B 
component factors were categorized as barriers and facilitators.
RESULTS: We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with clinical officers, enrolled 
nurses, and a psychiatric nurse. The questions were guided by the Capacity, 
Opportunity and Motivation Behavioral change (COM-B) framework to identify 
barriers and facilitators to cognitive impairment screening. The factors that 
negatively affected the screening were considered as barriers, while the 
positive as facilitators. Capacity related barriers to cognitive impairment 
screening included chronic understaffing, primary healthcare provider 
non-involvement, lack of training/skills, lack of knowledge and awareness in 
screening, absence of caretakers, lack of patient awareness of cognitive 
problems; while facilitators were staff recruitment, primary healthcare provider 
involvement, and specialized training. Opportunity related barriers to screening 
included patient overload, infrastructure shortage, and time constraints. 
Motivation related barriers included lack of screening guidance and policy, 
while the facilitators were availability of mentorship programs for primary 
healthcare providers.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrating cognitive impairment screening in primary health care 
requires engagement of relevant stakeholders with the focus on addressing 
implementation challenges through capacity development. Timely cognitive 
impairment screening at the first point of care initiates a cascade of 
interventions for timely enrollment into care, thus arresting the progress of 
cognitive impairment that leads to dementia.

BACKGROUND: Children suffering from allergic rhinitis (AR) in their earlier days 
of life, not receiving proper treatment, subsequently develop asthma. To 
sensitize the first-year medical undergraduates about AR by implementing 
pediatric allergic rhinitis (PAR) module as a part of their attitude, ethics, 
and communication (AETCOM) curriculum.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Triangulation type of mixed method study was conducted 
from January 2021 to June 2021 among 125 first-year medical undergraduate 
students. The PAR module communication checklist was developed and validated by 
an interprofessional (IP) team. Twenty multiple-choice questions (MCQs) were 
framed for both pretest and posttest cognitive assessment of the students. The 
pretest assessment was done (first 15 min) followed by the teaching of the PAR 
module (30 min), and lastly the posttest assessment along with open-ended 
feedback (last 15 min). Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) 
communication checklist along with the guidelines was given to the observer 
during the student-patient encounter to score the learner and to assess the 
communication skill. Apart from descriptive analysis, paired t-test and content 
analysis were done.
RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in the mean scores before and 
after the PAR module and communication checklist (P < 0.001). Majority (78/81, 
96%) of the students favored this module, while (28/81) 34.6% suggested 
modifications. Most of the parent's feedback was good about the student's 
communication skill in terms of empathy (118), behavior (107), and greet (125); 
however, 33 parents were about the opinion of difficulties in closing the 
session, 17 parents commented about student's language problem and 27 about 
feedback.
CONCLUSION: The PAR module should be taught in the current medical curriculum as 
a part of AETCOM in the foundation course as early clinical exposure with some 
modifications in the existing module.

BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are well-known risk factors for developing 
type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, details on the evolution of the T2DM burden 
attributed to China's high body mass index (BMI) in China have not been 
thoroughly studied. This study aimed to investigate the temporal trends of the 
T2DM burden attributable to a high BMI in China from 1990 to 2019 and to 
evaluate the independent effects of age, period, and cohort on the burden of 
T2DM attributed to a high BMI.
METHODS: Data on T2DM burden attributable to a high BMI from 1990 to 2019 were 
obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Deaths, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), 
and age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) of T2DM attributable to a high BMI were 
estimated by age and sex. The joinpoint regression model was performed to 
calculate the annual percentage change (APC) and the average annual percentage 
change (AAPC) in the burden of T2DM attributed to a high BMI. The 
age-period-cohort analysis was applied to estimate the independent effects of 
age, period, and cohort on the temporal trends of mortality and the DALY rate.
RESULTS: In 2019, deaths and DALYs from T2DM attributable to a high BMI in China 
were 47.53 thousand and 3.74 million, respectively, five times higher than in 
1990. Among those under 60 years of age, men had higher deaths and DALYs than 
women, while the gender differences reversed in those over 60 years of age. 
Furthermore, the ASMR and ASDR in 2019 were 2.39 per 100,000 (95%UI 1.12-3.90) 
and 181.54 per 100,000 (95%UI 93.71-286.33), respectively, representing a 91% 
and 126% increase since 1990. In China, women previously had a higher ASMR and 
ASDR than men, while the differences in the ASMR and ASDR between the sexes were 
reversed in recent years. From 1990 to 2019, the ASMR in women increased before 
2004 and then decreased from 2004 to 2015, and increased again after, with an 
overall AAPC value of 1.6%. In contrast, the ASMR in men continued to increase, 
with an overall AAPC value of 3.2%. The ASDR continued to increase in men and 
women, with AAPCs of 2.2% and 3.5%, respectively. The age effect showed that the 
relative risk of mortality increased with age in both men and women, except for 
the 75-84 age group. The impact of the age on the DALY rate revealed a trend of 
first rising and then decreasing, peaking at 65-69 years. The effect of the 
period on the burden of T2DM attributable to a high BMI increased from 1990 to 
2019. The cohort effect generally showed a downward trend.
CONCLUSION: The burden of T2DM attributed to a high BMI in China increased 
substantially from 1990 to 2019, particularly in men. Therefore, there is an 
urgent need for gender- and age-based public health guidelines on prevention 
strategies, early diagnosis, and effective management of T2DM, overweight, and 
obesity in China.

INTRODUCTION: Heart failure (HF) is a serious complication of end-stage kidney 
disease (ESKD). However, most data come from retrospective studies that included 
patients on chronic hemodialysis at the time of its initiation. These patients 
are frequently overhydrated, which significantly influences the echocardiogram 
findings. The primary aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of heart 
failure and its phenotypes. The secondary aims were (1) to describe the 
potential of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) for HF 
diagnosis in ESKD patients on hemodialysis, (2) to analyze the frequency of 
abnormal left ventricular geometry, and (3) to describe the differences between 
various HF phenotypes in this population.
METHODS: We included all patients on chronic hemodialysis for at least 3 months 
from five hemodialysis units who were willing to participate, had no living 
kidney transplant donor, and had a life expectancy longer than 6 months at the 
time of inclusion. Detailed echocardiography together with hemodynamic 
calculations, dialysis arteriovenous fistula flow volume calculation, and basic 
lab analysis were performed in conditions of clinical stability. Excess of 
severe overhydration was excluded by clinical examination and by employing 
bioimpedance.
RESULTS: A total of 214 patients aged 66.4 ± 14.6 years were included. HF was 
diagnosed in 57% of them. Among patients with HF, HF with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF) was, by far, the most common phenotype and occurred in 35%, 
while HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) occurred only in 7%, HF with 
mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) in 7%, and high-output HF in 9%. 
Patients with HFpEF differed from patients with no HF significantly in the 
following: they were older (62 ± 14 vs. 70 ± 14, p = 0.002) and had a higher 
left ventricular mass index [96(36) vs. 108(45), p = 0.015], higher left atrial 
index [33(12) vs. 44(16), p < 0.0001], and higher estimated central venous 
pressure [5(4) vs. 6(8), p = 0.004] and pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
[31(9) vs. 40(23), p = 0.006] but slightly lower tricuspid annular plane 
systolic excursion (TAPSE): 22 ± 5 vs. 24 ± 5, p = 0.04. NTproBNP had low 
sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing HF or HFpEF: with the use of the 
cutoff value of 8,296 ng/L, the sensitivity of HF diagnosis was only 52% while 
the specificity was 79%. However, NTproBNP levels were significantly related to 
echocardiographic variables, most significantly to the indexed left atrial 
volume (R = 0.56, p < 10-5) and to the estimated systolic pulmonary arterial 
pressure (R = 0.50, p < 10-5).
CONCLUSIONS: HFpEF was by far the most common heart failure phenotype in 
patients on chronic hemodialysis and was followed by high-output HF. Patients 
suffering from HFpEF were older and had not only typical echocardiographic 
changes but also higher hydration that mirrored increased filling pressures of 
both ventricles than in those of patients without HF.

Advances in cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) have prolonged life 
expectancy in various medical settings. However, the issue of hypersensitivity 
to components of CIEDs is still a concern. Since 1970, allergic reactions to 
metallic and nonmetallic components of CIEDs have been reported. 
Hypersensitivity reactions to medical devices are rare and not fully understood. 
In some cases, diagnosis and treatment are difficult. Cardiologists should 
always keep in mind pacemaker allergy when a patient appears with wound 
complications and no signs of infection. Patch testing should be tailored toward 
the specific biomaterials used in a device, in addition to testing with standard 
screening allergens in select cases.

Herein, the effect of incorporation of rosemary essential oil (REO) 
nanoemulsions with the smallest (98.14 nm) and largest (148.04 nm) droplets' 
sizes at different concentrations (0%, 2%, and 4% v/v) in Eremurus luteus root 
gum (ELRG) coating solution on microbial, chemical, and sensory qualities of 
chicken fillets during cold storage was investigated. The results demonstrated a 
significant reduction in pH and TBA value and total viable microbial count (TVC) 
of chicken meat samples after using an active ELRG coating compared with the 
uncoated sample. Moreover, the properties of active ELRG coatings were more 
affected by the concentration of REO nanoemulsions than the size of their 
droplets. More antimicrobial and antioxidant activities were observed in coated 
samples containing 4% (v/v) REO nanoemulsions (L-4 and S-4). The highest and 
lowest pHs at the end of storage belonged to uncoated (6.89) and S-4 coated 
(6.41) samples, respectively. Unlike the control sample (8th day), the microbial 
population in the active coated samples (>12th day) reached the threshold level 
(7 log CFU/g) later. The TBA value in the control and coated samples was 0.56 
and 0.4-0.47 mg/kg after 12 days of cold storage, respectively. Increasing the 
REO nanoemulsion content from 2% to 4% (v/v) in the coating solution enhanced 
the score of sensory parameters such as odor, color, and total acceptance of the 
chicken meat, especially on the last day of cold storage. The obtained results 
suggested ELRG-REO coatings as an effective strategy to delay the chemical and 
microbial deterioration of chicken meat fillets.

Fragaria × ananassa Duch. (Strawberry) fruit is susceptible to postharvest 
diseases, thus decrease in quality attributes, such as physiological and 
biochemical properties leads to decrease in shelf life. The objective of the 
present study was to check the effect of Selenium NP's and packaging conditions 
on the shelf life of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch) fruits. The shelf 
life was observed with 4 days intervals and examined for characteristics such as 
physiological weight loss, moisture content, percentage decay loss, peroxidase, 
catalase, and DPPH radical scavenging. The quality change of postharvest 
Fragaria × ananassa Duch. was monitored by the application of selenium 
nanoparticles (T1 plant extract in 10 mM salt solution, T2 plant extract in 
30 mM salt solution, T3 plant extract in 40 mM salt solution, T4 distilled 
water; control) in different packaging materials (plastic bags, cardboard, and 
brown paper) at different storage conditions (6°C and 25°C). 10 mM, 20 mM, and 
30 mM solution of sodium selenite salt, prepared from 1 M stock solution. 
Selenium nanoparticles were synthesized using Cassia fistula L. extract and 
sodium selenite salt solution. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was used as a stabilizer. 
The nanoparticles were characterized through UV-visible spectroscopy and X-Ray 
diffractometer (XRD). It was observed that the strawberry Fragaria × ananassa 
Duch. Treated with T1 (CFE and 10 mM salt solution) stored in plastic packaging 
at ±6°C showed the best physiological parameters and hence the treatment is 
recommended for storage without affecting the quality of strawberry fruit up to 
16 days.

Growing concerns about food nutrition and food supplies have encouraged the 
development of effective constituents. Lutein is an important nutrient element, 
and its health benefits are gradually being recognized. Lutein, as a carotenoid 
antioxidant, can protect cells and organs from damage caused by free radicals. 
However, in processing, storage, and usage, lutein is unstable and often 
undergoes isomerization and oxidative decomposition, which limits its wide range 
of applications. β-Cyclodextrin is an ideal substrate to prepare microcapsule 
structures, which are highly biocompatible and nontoxic. During the lutein 
encapsulation process, ideal β-cyclodextrin microcapsules were used to form 
inclusion compounds. The results reveal that the encapsulation efficiency of the 
microcapsules reached 53%. Moreover, using ultrasonic-assisted extraction can 
easily and efficiently purify lutein. In addition, the capability of the 
β-cyclodextrin composite shell can enhance the bioactive molecules' activity and 
stability.

Timely, high-quality mortality data have allowed for assessments of the impact 
of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on life expectancies in 
upper-middle- and high-income countries. Extant data, though imperfect, suggest 
that the bulk of the pandemic-induced mortality might have occurred elsewhere. 
This article reports on changes in life expectancies around the world as far as 
they can be estimated from the evidence available at the end of 2021. The global 
life expectancy appears to have declined by 0.92 years between 2019 and 2020 and 
by another 0.72 years between 2020 and 2021, but the decline seems to have ended 
during the last quarter of 2021. Uncertainty about its exact size aside, this 
represents the first decline in global life expectancy since 1950, the first 
year for which a global estimate is available from the United Nations. Annual 
declines in life expectancy (from a 12-month period to the next) appear to have 
exceeded two years at some point before the end of 2021 in at least 50 
countries. Since 1950, annual declines of that magnitude had only been observed 
on rare occasions, such as Cambodia in the 1970s, Rwanda in the 1990s, and 
possibly some sub-Saharan African nations at the peak of the acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic.

INTRODUCTION: Metabolic risk factors (MRFs) predispose populations to a variety 
of chronic diseases with a huge burden globally. With the increasing burden of 
these risk factors in Iran, in this study, we aimed to report the estimated 
burden attributed to MRFs at national and subnational scales in Iran, from 1990 
to 2019.
METHODS: Based on the comparative risk assessment method of the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) Study 2019, data of deaths and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) attributable to four top MRFs in Iran including high systolic blood 
pressure (SBP), high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), high body mass index (BMI), 
and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) for the 1990-2019 period, were extracted. 
The socio-demographic index (SDI) was used to report the data based on the 
corresponding socio-economic stratifications. The results were reported in 
national and subnational 31 provinces of Iran to discover disparities regarding 
the attributable burden to MRFs. Furthermore, we reported the causes of diseases 
to which the attributable burden to MRFs was related.
RESULTS: Overall, the age-standardized high LDL, high SBP, high BMI, and high 
FPG-attributed death rate changed by -45.1, -35.6, +2.8, and +19.9% from 1990 to 
2019, respectively. High SBP was the leading risk factor regarding attributed 
age-standardized death rates reaching 157.8 (95% uncertainty interval: 
135.3-179.1) and DALY rates reaching 2973.4 (2652.2-3280.2) per 100,000 
person-years, in 2019. All rates increased with aging, and men had higher rates 
except for the +70 years age group. At the subnational level, provinces in the 
middle SDI quintile had the highest death and DALY rates regarding all four 
MRFs. Total deaths, DALYs, YLLs and YLDs number by the causes of diseases linked 
to MRFs increased over the study period. Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes 
mellitus, and kidney diseases were the main causes of burden of disease 
attributable to MRFs.
CONCLUSION: Herein, we found divergent patterns regarding the burden of MRFs as 
well as disparities in different regions, sex, and age groups for each risk 
factor and related causes. This could provide policymakers with a clearer vision 
toward more appropriate decision-making and resource allocation to prevent the 
burden of MRFs in Iran.

BACKGROUND: There is scarce gender-disaggregated evidence on the burden of 
disease (BD) worldwide and this is particularly prominent in low- and 
middle-income countries. The objective of this study is to compare the BD caused 
by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and related risk factors by gender in 
Mexican adults.
METHODS: We retrieved disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) estimates for 
diabetes, cancers and neoplasms, chronic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), chronic 
respiratory diseases (CRDs), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) Study from 1990-2019. Age-standardized death rates were 
calculated using official mortality microdata from 2000 to 2020. Then, we 
analysed national health surveys to depict tobacco and alcohol use and physical 
inactivity from 2000-2018. Women-to-men DALYs and mortality rates and prevalence 
ratios (WMR) were calculated as a measure of gender gap.
FINDINGS: Regarding DALYs, WMR was >1 for diabetes, cancers, and CKD in 1990, 
indicating a higher burden in women. WMR decreased over time in all NCDs, except 
for CRDs, which increased to 0.78. However, WMR was <1 for all in 2019. The 
mortality-WMR was >1 for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in 2000 and <1 for 
the rest of the conditions. The WMR decreased in all cases, except for CRDs, 
which was <1 in 2020. The WMR for tobacco and alcohol use remained under 1. For 
physical inactivity, it was >1 and increasing.
CONCLUSIONS: The gender gap has changed for selected NCDs in favour of women, 
except for CRDs. Women face a lower BD and are less affected by tobacco and 
alcohol use but face a higher risk of physical inactivity. Policymakers should 
consider a gendered approach for designing effective policies to reduce the 
burden of NCDs and health inequities.
