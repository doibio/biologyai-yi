RESULTS: Adopting five healthy versus none was associated with a lower risk of 
all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and the hazard ratio (95% confidence 
interval [CI]) was 0.38 (0.29, 0.51) for all-cause mortality, 0.26 (0.13, 0.52) 
for CVD mortality, and 0.59 (0.37, 0.92) for cancer mortality. Nonadherence to 
4-5 healthy lifestyle factors accounted for 34.9% (95% CI = 29.2, 40.2) in 
population attributable fraction for all-cause mortality, 35.1% (23.7, 44.9) for 
CVD mortality, and 18.0% (6.5, 28.0) for cancer mortality. Conversely, adherence 
to 4-5 healthy lifestyle factors versus none could achieve a gain of 8.1 years 
in women and 6.6 years in men for the life expectancy at 50 years.
CONCLUSIONS: A healthier lifestyle is associated with a substantially reduced 
risk of mortality and a longer life expectancy in the Chinese population. Our 
findings highlight the necessity of coordinated actions targeting combined 
lifestyle factors in reducing the overall burden of diseases and premature 
deaths.

Epilepsy affects about seventy million of the global population and is a 
chronic, debilitating condition, with the vast majority of these cases 
originating in the temporal lobe. Furthermore, epilepsy of the temporal lobe can 
further subdivide into two categories based on the anatomical origin of 
epileptic focus: Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE): Involving the anatomy of 
the innermost structure of the temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, 
parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala; this is the most common form of temporal 
lobe seizures and is usually secondary to a pathological process known as 
hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Lateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (LTLE): Also referred 
to as neocortical temporal lobe seizures.  These are very rare and most commonly 
secondary to genetic or acquired structural/anatomical lesions. The impact of 
epilepsy leads to a decrease in quality-of-life indices, shortened 
life-expectancy, and by extension, bears a significant economic impact for the 
individual and society.

Although the standard of care for mitral valve (MV) pathology due to 
degenerative changes is surgical repair, patient outcomes depend on multiple 
factors including pre-operative status, the severity of mitral regurgitation 
(MR), the technique of repair and surgeon and center experience. If MV repair is 
carried out in a timely fashion, the operative risk is low, and life expectancy 
is close to that of similar sex-aged matched controls. In high-risk patients, 
the choice amongst surgical, percutaneous, and conservative approaches can be 
challenging but should have as its basis patient comorbidities and surgical 
expertise. Mitral valve repair (MVr) surgery has some advantages over mitral 
valve replacement (MVR), although patient-specific factors must be taken into 
consideration. Of note, close to 50% of patients with severe mitral valve 
pathology are not candidates for surgical intervention due to age or other 
comorbidities. Up to 2 to 3% of adults in the United States are afflicted with 
degenerative mitral valve disease. Patients with degenerative MV pathology who 
develop symptoms of MR have a poor prognosis, with annual mortality rates of up 
to 34%. Mitral stenosis (MS), primarily caused by rheumatic heart disease (RHD), 
is commonly treated by percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty or MVR. Repair 
is usually not feasible in these patients with rheumatic mitral disease. MR is 
classified as primary or secondary, depending on whether the lesion is located 
at the mitral valve apparatus or due to left ventricular changes, respectively. 
While severe primary MR still receives treatment with surgical intervention, 
percutaneous techniques for repair and replacement are also gaining traction. 
MVR may be considered in patients with MR caused by papillary muscle rupture, 
degenerative and ischemic MR, or in patients with a failed repair undergoing 
reoperation.

Unlike other aspects of welfare (e.g. income), health has been relatively 
neglected when it comes to defining and measuring aspects of poverty. The aim of 
the paper is twofold: first we elaborate how the concept of 'health poverty' can 
be defined and measured, and second we apply the methodology to study health 
poverty in a variety of cases. The measurement of health poverty allows us to 
gain insights into different sorts of health deprivation in society as a whole, 
and in specific subgroups. We measure poverty by means of the widely adopted 
Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) class of indicators and apply this to three 
different health variables: cardiovascular risk, health status and life 
expectancy. Moreover, the FGT class is additively decomposable, making it 
possible to gauge the contribution of specific subgroups to overall poverty. We 
provide two applications of these methods. Firstly, we examine changes in the 
risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the United States using two waves of the 
NHANES survey from 2005-06 and 2013-14 (n = 3,014 and 4,001 respectively) and 
use a threshold of 20% 10 year CVD risk to define health poverty. Overall our 
results indicate a slight decline in the proportion at high CVD risk between 
these periods. Secondly, we apply poverty measures to health status as measured 
by the SF-6D index and to empirically derived predictions of life expectancy and 
estimated using 24,820 individuals from the first 15 waves of the Australian 
HILDA survey. Trends in poverty over time are compared using several thresholds 
and decomposed by a variety of sub-groups. Measures of health poverty can be an 
important instrument for focusing the attention on those with the worst health, 
or highest risk, in a society and should be used more widely.

RATIONALE: Insufficient sleep is associated with a number of negative health 
outcomes; as most adolescents obtain <7 h of sleep per night, it is important to 
understand how sleep impacts asthma among adolescents.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of sleep opportunity on asthma in adolescents.
METHODS: In this study, 54 adolescents with asthma (12-17 years, 69% female, 65% 
Caucasian) participated in a randomized, cross-over sleep manipulation trial, 
including a sleep stabilization week, five nights of a "Short" sleep opportunity 
(time in bed: 6.5 h/night), and five nights of a "Long" sleep opportunity (time 
in bed: 9.5 h/night). Wake times were consistent across all three study weeks. 
Primary outcomes were lung function (daily peak expiratory flow rate, weekly 
spirometry) and functional asthma outcomes (daily asthma symptoms, Asthma 
Control Questionnaire, PROMIS Asthma Impact Scale). Markers of inflammation were 
also explored.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared to the Long sleep week, during the Short 
sleep week, morning FEV1 was lower (p = 0.006), while asthma symptoms and 
albuterol use was higher (p < 0.05), and asthma showed a trend towards greater 
negative impact on daily life (p = 0.07). No differences were found for weekly 
measures of lung function or inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: An insufficient sleep opportunity negatively impacts objective and 
subjective daily symptoms of asthma in adolescents, as well as health related 
quality of life. As most adolescents are significantly sleep deprived, it is 
important to target sleep health in the treatment of asthma.

Avena sativa L. is the most important cultivated oat species worldwide. Although 
photoperiod-insensitive oat varieties exist, the molecular mechanisms underlying 
their photoperiod sensitivity are poorly understood. This study investigated the 
effects of day length on the fioral transition of oats and the mechanisms 
underlying oat photoperiod insensitivity. Photoperiod-sensitive and 
photoperiod-insensitive varieties, including gp012, were used in shading 
experiments, and the developing leaves and main shoot apices (MSAs) of the 
HONGQI2 and gp012 varieties were used for sequencing. Leaves and MSAs were 
collected in 2016, and their transcriptomes were sequenced. The 
photoperiod-insensitive varieties headed under both short-day and long-day 
conditions, while the photoperiod-sensitive varieties headed only under long-day 
conditions. A total of 60673 transcript sequences were obtained, 7932 of which 
were differentially expressed; 3194 and 4738 transcripts were differentially 
expressed in the leaves and MSAs, respectively. A total of 25793 transcripts 
were classified into 123 pathways based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) database. The carbon metabolism pathways were dominant, followed 
by ribosome and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, 
203 transcripts were classified into the circadian rhythm pathway. Compared with 
the expression of pseudo-response regulator protein 37 (PRR37) in 
photoperiod-sensitive varieties, that in photoperiod-insensitive varieties was 
upregulated. Among the differentially expressed transcripts (DETs), 8 MADS-box 
genes were identified. PRR37 is a key regulator of oat photoperiod 
insensitivity. The obtained transcriptome dataset may provide a reference for 
analyzing oat transcript expression, and the results should be used as a 
reference for oat breeding and production.

Since the first use of liposomes as carriers for antigens, much work has been 
done to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the encapsulation of 
vaccine-relevant biomolecules. However, only a few studies have specifically 
investigated the encapsulation of hydrophilic, non-conformational peptide 
epitopes. We performed comprehensive and systematic screening studies, in order 
to identify conditions that favor the electrostatic interaction of such peptides 
with lipid membranes. Moreover, we have explored bi-terminal sequence extension 
as an approach to modify the isoelectric point of peptides, in order to modulate 
their membrane binding behavior and eventually shift/expand the working range 
under which they can be efficiently encapsulated in an electrostatically driven 
manner. The findings of our membrane interaction studies were then applied to 
preparing peptide-loaded liposomes. Our results show that the magnitude of 
membrane binding observed in our exploratory in situ setup translates to 
corresponding levels of encapsulation efficiency in both of the two most 
commonly employed methods for the preparation of liposomes, i.e., thin-film 
hydration and microfluidic mixing. We believe that the methods and findings 
described in the present studies will be of use to a wide audience and can be 
applied to address the ongoing relevant issue of the efficient encapsulation of 
hydrophilic biomolecules.

Olfactory learning and floral scents are co-adaptive traits in the 
plant-pollinator relationship. However, how scent relates to cognition and 
learning in the diverse group of Neotropical stingless bees is largely unknown. 
Here we evaluated the ability of Melipona eburnea to be conditioned to scent 
using the proboscis extension reflex (PER) protocol. Stingless bees did not show 
PER while harnessed but were able to be PER conditioned to scent when 
free-to-move in a mini-cage (fmPER). We evaluated the effect of: 1) 
unconditioned stimulus (US) reward, and 2) previous scent-reward associations on 
olfactory learning performance. When using unscented-US, PER-responses were low 
on day 1, but using scented-US reward the olfactory PER-response increased on 
day 1. On day 2 PER performance greatly increased in bees that previously had 
experienced the same odor and reward combination, while bees that experienced a 
different odor on day 2 showed poor olfactory learning. Bees showed higher 
olfactory PER conditioning to guava than to mango odor. The effect of the 
unconditioned stimulus reward was not a significant factor in the model on day 
2. This indicates that olfactory learning performance can increase via either 
taste receptors or accumulated experience with the same odor. Our results have 
application in agriculture and pollination ecology.

Wear Performance.

Life expectancy is on the rise and, concurrently, the demand for total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA), which lasts a lifetime, is increasing. To meet this demand, 
improved TKA designs have been introduced. Recent advances in radiography and 
manufacturing techniques have enabled the production of patient-specific TKA. 
Nevertheless, concerns regarding the wear performance, which limit the lifespan 
of TKA, remain to be addressed. This study aims at reducing the wear in 
patient-specific TKA using design optimization and parametric three-dimensional 
(3D) finite-element (FE) modelling. The femoral component design was implemented 
in a patient-specific manner, whereas the tibial insert conformity remained to 
be determined by design variables. The gait cycle loading condition was applied, 
and the optimized model was validated by the results obtained from the 
experimental wear tests. The wear predictions were iterated for five million 
gait cycles using the computational model with force-controlled input. Similar 
patterns for internal/external rotation and anterior/posterior translation were 
observed in both initial and optimal models. The wear rates for initial and 
optimal models were recorded as 23.2 mm3/million cycles and 16.7 mm3/million 
cycles, respectively. Moreover, the experimental wear rate in the optimal design 
was 17.8 mm3/million cycles, which validated our optimization procedure. This 
study suggests that tibial insert conformity is an important factor in 
influencing the wear performance of patient-specific TKA, and it is capable of 
providing improved clinical results through enhanced design selections. This 
finding can boost the future development of patient-specific TKA, and it can be 
extended to other joint-replacement designs. However, further research is 
required to explore the potential clinical benefits of the improved wear 
performance demonstrated in this study.

BACKGROUND: Demographic changes, increased life expectancy and the associated 
rise in chronic diseases pose challenges to public health care systems. 
Optimized treatment methods and integrated concepts of care are potential 
solutions to overcome increasing financial burdens and improve quality of care. 
In this context modeling is a powerful tool to evaluate potential benefits of 
different treatment procedures on health outcomes as well as health care 
budgets. This work presents a novel modeling approach for simulating different 
treatment procedures of heart failure patients based on extensive data sets from 
outpatient and inpatient care.
METHODS: Our hybrid heart failure model is based on discrete event and agent 
based methodologies and facilitates the incorporation of different therapeutic 
procedures for outpatient and inpatient care on patient individual level. The 
state of health is modeled with the functional classification of the New York 
Heart Association (NYHA), strongly affecting discrete state transition 
probabilities alongside age and gender. Cooperation with Austrian health care 
and health insurance providers allowed the realization of a detailed model 
structure based on clinical data of more than 25,000 patients.
RESULTS: Simulation results of conventional care and a telemonitoring program 
underline the unfavorable prognosis for heart failure and reveal the correlation 
of NYHA classes with health and economic outcomes. Average expenses for the 
treatment of NYHA class IV patients of €10,077 ± €165 were more than doubled 
compared to other classes. The selected use case of a telemonitoring program 
demonstrated potential cost savings within two years of application. NYHA 
classes II and III revealed most potential for additional treatment measures.
CONCLUSION: The presented model allows performing extensive simulations of 
established treatment procedures for heart failure patients and evaluating new 
holistic methods of care and innovative study designs. This approach offers 
health care providers a unique, adaptable and comprehensive tool for decision 
making in the complex and socioeconomically challenging field of cardiovascular 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the leading malignancy among Filipino women, with 
about 23.50% of cases characterized by human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 
(HER2) overexpression. Trastuzumab, in addition to standard chemotherapy, is 
currently recommended as primary treatment for HER2-positive early-stage breast 
cancer (EBC) in the adjuvant settings, and has been listed in the Philippine 
National Formulary (PNF) since 2008, but with no current evidence yet on its 
value for money, to date. Hence, despite several policy enablers, its 
accessibility remains to be limited in the Philippines. We performed an economic 
evaluation to assess the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of adjuvant 
trastuzumab therapy for HER2-positive EBC in the Philippines, using healthcare 
system and societal perspectives, in aid of guiding coverage decisions.
METHODS: A Markov model-based cost-utility and budget impact analyses were 
conducted to estimate the total costs incurred and outcomes gained in using 
1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab added to standard chemotherapy versus standard 
chemotherapy alone, over a lifetime horizon. We discounted both costs and 
outcomes at 3.5% per annum. Parameters were estimated using country survival 
data, systematic review and meta-analysis of the relative treatment effect, 
local and international cost data, and published utility data. Univariate and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to account for parameter 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: Trastuzumab therapy was dominated with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at PHP 453,505 per QALY gained from a healthcare 
system perspective or PHP 458,686 per QALY gained from a societal perspective, 
with 10% cost-effectiveness probability at the country cost-effectiveness 
threshold of PHP 120,000 per QALY gained. National implementation will cost an 
additional amount of PHP 13,909 million in year one alone, plus about PHP 2000 
to 3000 million annually for the succeeding fiscal years.
CONCLUSION: At its current cost, 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy compared 
to standard chemotherapy alone for HER2-positive EBC does not represent value 
for money in the Philippines. Its current cost will have to significantly lower 
down by one-half to achieve cost-effectiveness.

Aortic stenosis presenting as part of a multiple valve disease scenario or as 
mixed valve disease is frequent. These scenarios induce hemodynamic interactions 
that may result in diagnostic pitfalls. Echocardiography is the cornerstone 
technique for diagnosis of valve disorders, but other modalities may be useful. 
In addition to assessment of each individual lesion, the heart valve team must 
integrate numerous parameters into the management strategy, including global 
assessment of clinical and hemodynamic effects, operative risk, life expectancy, 
natural history of untreated valve disease, valve reparability, and/or 
suitability for single or multiple transcatheter valve procedures.

The ideal aortic valve substitute remains elusive. Bioprosthetic valves are the 
replacement option of choice in elderly patients undergoing aortic valve 
replacement (AVR). When implanted in young and middle-aged adults, both 
bioprosthetic and mechanical valves are associated with excess mortality 
compared with the age- and sex-matched general population. The Ross procedure is 
the only operation that can restore normal life expectancy in young and 
middle-aged adults undergoing AVR. In this article, the authors review the 
various options for surgical AVR and examine their contemporary applications and 
outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Studies reporting on the cost-effectiveness of cancer screening 
usually account for quality of life losses and healthcare costs owing to cancer 
but do not account for future costs and quality of life losses related to 
competing risks. This study aims to demonstrate the impact of medical costs and 
quality of life losses of other diseases in the life years gained on the 
cost-effectiveness of U.S. cancer screening.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness studies of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer 
screening in the U.S. were identified using a systematic literature review. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the eligible articles were updated by 
adding lifetime expenditures and health losses per quality-adjusted life year 
gained because of competing risks. This was accomplished using data on medical 
spending and quality of life by age and disease from the Medical Expenditure 
Panel Survey (2011-2015) combined with cause-deleted life tables. The study was 
conducted in 2018.
RESULTS: The impact of quality of life losses and healthcare expenditures of 
competing risks in life years gained incurred owing to screening were the 
highest for breast cancer and the lowest for cervical cancer. The updates 
suggest that incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are underestimated by 
$10,300-$13,700 per quality-adjusted life year gained if quality of life losses 
and healthcare expenditures of competing risks are omitted in economic 
evaluations. Furthermore, cancer screening programs that were considered cost 
saving, were found not to be so following the inclusion of medical expenditures 
of competing risks.
CONCLUSIONS: Practical difficulties in quantifying quality of life losses and 
healthcare expenditures owing to competing risks in life years gained can be 
overcome. Their inclusion can have a substantial impact on the 
cost-effectiveness of cancer screening programs.

BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery results in an improvement in quality of life, 
co-morbid diseases, and an increased life expectancy. However, to obtain these 
benefits perioperative mortality rates need to be low.
OBJECTIVES: Evaluate 90-day and 1-year mortality after bariatric surgery in 
Sweden from 2008 to 2017.
SETTING: National quality register.
METHODS: Data on applicable patients from the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery 
Registry, including 63,469 patients (85.1% gastric bypass, 12.5% sleeve 
gastrectomy, .8% duodenal switch, .5% minor revisions, and 1.1% other 
procedures), were retrieved and matched to the Cause of Death registry.
RESULTS: During the 10-year period, 36 patients died within 90 days, resulting 
in a .06% overall mortality. The 1-year mortality rate was .19% (n = 111). Both 
mortality rates decreased over the study period. In a multivariate analysis, 
depression (odds ratio [OR] 2.38, [95% confidence interval 1.48-3.84]), leakage 
(OR 9.32 [4.85-17.94]), and thromboembolic events (OR 7.60 [1.63-35.37]) 
increased mortality risks at both 90 days and 1 year, whereas age (OR 1.03 
[1.01-1.06] per increased year of age) and abdominal circumference (OR 1.03 
[1.01-1.05] per cm) were also associated with increased mortality at 1 year. The 
predictive value of the Obesity Surgery Mortality Risk Score was confirmed.
CONCLUSIONS: The low 90-day and 1-year mortality, .06% and .19%, respectively, 
demonstrates that bariatric surgery in Sweden is safe. The use of 
antidepressants and 2 serious postoperative complications were the most 
significant risk factors for early deaths, while increased age and preoperative 
abdominal circumference also contributed at 1 year.

Rapid modulation of RNA function by endoribonucleases during physiological 
responses to environmental changes is known to be an effective bacterial 
biochemical adaptation. We report a molecular mechanism underlying the 
regulation of enolase (eno) expression by two endoribonucleases, RNase G and 
RNase III, the expression levels of which are modulated by oxygen availability 
in Escherichia coli. Analyses of transcriptional eno-cat fusion constructs 
strongly suggested the existence of cis-acting elements in the eno 5' 
untranslated region that respond to RNase III and RNase G cellular 
concentrations. Primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping analyses of eno mRNA in 
vivo identified three eno mRNA transcripts that are generated in a manner 
dependent on RNase III expression, one of which was found to accumulate in 
rng-deleted cells. Moreover, our data suggested that RNase III-mediated cleavage 
of primary eno mRNA transcripts enhanced Eno protein production, a process that 
involved putative cis-antisense RNA. We found that decreased RNase G protein 
abundance coincided with enhanced RNase III expression in E. coli grown 
anaerobically, leading to enhanced eno expression. Thereby, this 
posttranscriptional up-regulation of eno expression helps E. coli cells adjust 
their physiological reactions to oxygen-deficient metabolic modes. Our results 
revealed a molecular network of coordinated endoribonuclease activity that 
post-transcriptionally modulates the expression of Eno, a key enzyme in 
glycolysis.

Potential Bias Associated with Modeling the Effectiveness of Healthcare 
Interventions in Reducing Mortality Using an Overall Hazard Ratio.

BACKGROUND: Clinical trials often report intervention efficacy in terms of the 
reduction in all-cause mortality between the treatment and control arms (i.e., 
an overall hazard ratio [oHR]) instead of the reduction in disease-specific 
mortality (i.e., a disease-specific hazard ratio [dsHR]). Using oHR to reduce 
all-cause mortality beyond the time horizon of the trial may introduce bias if 
the relative proportion of other-cause mortality increases with age. We sought 
to quantify this oHR extrapolation bias and propose a new approach to overcome 
this bias.
METHODS: We simulated a hypothetical cohort of patients with a generic disease 
that increased background mortality by a constant additive disease-specific 
rate. We quantified the bias in terms of the percentage change in life 
expectancy gains with the intervention under an oHR compared with a dsHR 
approach as a function of the cohort start age, the disease-specific mortality 
rate, dsHR, and the duration of the intervention's effect. We then quantified 
the bias in a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillators based on efficacy estimates from a clinical trial.
RESULTS: For a cohort of 50-year-old patients with a disease-specific mortality 
of 0.05, a dsHR of 0.5, a calculated oHR of 0.55, and a lifetime duration of 
effect, the bias was 28%. We varied these key parameters over wide ranges and 
the resulting bias ranged between 3 and 140%. In the CEA, the use of oHR as the 
intervention's effectiveness overestimated quality-adjusted life expectancy by 
9% and costs by 3%, biasing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio by - 6%.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of an oHR approach to model the intervention's 
effectiveness beyond the time horizon of the trial overestimates its benefits. 
In CEAs, this bias could decrease the cost of a QALY, overestimating 
interventions' cost effectiveness.

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential fatty acid modulating key nervous 
system functions, including neuroinflammation, and regulation of pre- and 
postsynaptic membrane formation. DHA concentration decreases in the lumbar 
spinal cord (LSC) of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and murine 
preclinical models. Using a dietary supplementation, we increased DHA levels (2% 
mean increase, p < 0.01) in the LSC of the familial ALS murine model 
B6SJL-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J. This DHA-enriched diet significantly increases male 
mouse survival by 7% (average 10 days over 130 days of life expectancy), and 
delays motor dysfunction (based on stride length) and transgene-associated 
weight loss (p < 0.01). DHA supplementation led to an increased 
anti-inflammatory fatty acid profile (ca 30%, p < 0.01) and a lower 
concentration of circulating proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α (p < 0.001 in 
males). Furthermore, although DHA-treated mice did not exhibit generally 
decreased protein oxidative markers (glutamic and aminoadipic semialdehydes, 
carboxyethyllysine, carboxymethyllysine, and malondialdehydelysine), dietary 
intake of DHA reduced immunoreactivity towards DNA oxidative damage markers 
(8-oxo-dG) in the LSC. In vitro we demonstrate that DHA and α-tocopherol 
addition to a model of motor neuron demise (neonatal rat organotypic spinal cord 
model under chronic excitotoxicity) also preserves motor neuron number, in 
comparison with untreated spinal cords. Also, beneficial effects on cell 
viability were evidenced for the motor neuron cell line NSC-34 in front of H2O2 
insult (p < 0.001). Globally we show a sex-specific benefit of dietary DHA 
supplementation in the G93A ALS mouse model, compared with mice fed an 
isocaloric control or a n-3-depleted diet. These changes were associated with an 
increased DHA concentration in the LSC and were compatible with in vitro results 
showing DHA neuroprotective properties. These results suggest the need for 
further study on the interaction of gender-influenced biological parameters and 
DHA in ALS pathogenesis.

OBJECTIVE: A large-scale, double-blind trial (SP0993; NCT01243177) demonstrated 
that lacosamide was noninferior to controlled-release carbamazepine 
(carbamazepine-CR) in terms of efficacy, and well tolerated as first-line 
monotherapy in patients (≥16 years of age) with newly diagnosed epilepsy. We 
report primary safety outcomes from the double-blind extension of the 
noninferiority trial (SP0994; NCT01465997) and post hoc analyses of pooled 
long-term safety and efficacy data from both trials.
METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to lacosamide or carbamazepine-CR. Doses 
were escalated (lacosamide: 200/400/600 mg/d; carbamazepine-CR: 
400/800/1200 mg/d) based on seizure control. Eligible patients continued 
randomized treatment in the extension. Primary outcomes of the extension were 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, and discontinuations 
due to TEAEs. Post hoc analyses of data from combined trials included 12- and 
24-month seizure freedom and TEAEs by number of comorbid conditions.
RESULTS: A total of 886 patients were treated in the initial trial and 548 in 
the extension; 211 of 279 patients (75.6%) on lacosamide and 180/269 (66.9%) on 
carbamazepine-CR completed the extension. In the extension, 181 patients (64.9%) 
on lacosamide and 182 (67.7%) on carbamazepine-CR reported TEAEs; in both 
groups, nasopharyngitis, headache, and dizziness were most common. Serious TEAEs 
were reported by 32 patients (11.5%) on lacosamide and 22 (8.2%) on 
carbamazepine-CR; 12 (4.3%) and 21 (7.8%) discontinued due to TEAEs. In the 
combined trials (median exposure: lacosamide 630 days; carbamazepine-CR 
589 days), Kaplan-Meier estimated proportions of patients with 12- and 24-month 
seizure freedom from first dose were 50.8% (95% confidence interval 46.2%-55.4%) 
and 47.0% (42.2%-51.7%) on lacosamide, and 54.9% (50.3%-59.6%) and 50.9% 
(46.0%-55.7%) on carbamazepine-CR. Incidences of drug-related TEAEs and 
discontinuations due to TEAEs increased by number of comorbid conditions and 
were lower in patients on lacosamide.
SIGNIFICANCE: Long-term (median ~2 years) lacosamide monotherapy was efficacious 
and generally well tolerated in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy. 
Seizure freedom rates were similar with lacosamide and carbamazepine-CR.

Unraveling the direct and indirect effects between future time perspective and 
subjective well-being across adulthood.

University of Hong Kong, Tai Po, New Territories, Hong Kong, China.

OBJECTIVES: While the socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) argues for a 
negative relationship between future time perspective (FTP) and subjective 
well-being (SWB), empirical studies have found contradictory results. The 
current study resolved the controversy by examining the indirect effect between 
FTP and SWB through preference of life goals. Age differences in the mediation 
effects were also tested.
METHOD: A total of 432 participants were surveyed for their FTP, life goals, 
depression, life satisfaction, and demographical background. The three 
components of FTP, extension (FTE), opportunity (FTO), and constraint (FTC), 
were examined respectively. Regression based mediation models were estimated to 
test the direct and indirect effects between FTP components and SWB. Moderated 
mediation models were adopted to test age differences in the above effects.
RESULTS: Opposite direct and indirect effects between FTP components and SWB 
were identified. FTE and FTO were related to relatively fewer present-focused 
life goals, and then to lower life satisfaction and higher depression. However, 
FTE and FTO were directly related to higher life satisfaction. FTC was not 
significantly related to preference of life goals but had a direct positive 
effect with depression. Moreover, older age attenuated the positive direct 
effect between FTO and life satisfaction, as well as the negative effect between 
preference to present-focused goals and depression.
CONCLUSION: The results highlight the critical role of life goal preference for 
understanding the complex relationship between FTP and subjective well-being. 
The differential effects of the three FTP components also suggest the importance 
to examine each component individually in future studies.

More Than Meets the Eye? The Role of Annual Ornamental Flowers in Supporting 
Pollinators.

Ornamental flowers are commonly planted in urban and suburban areas to provide 
foraging resources for pollinator populations. However, their role in supporting 
broad pollinator biodiversity is not well established as previous studies have 
been conducted in urban landscapes with pollinator communities that are distinct 
from those in natural systems. We observed pollinator visitation patterns to 
five ornamental annual plant genera and their cultivars over multiple years at 
two semi-natural sites in Pennsylvania to understand their potential for 
supporting diverse pollinator communities. There was significant variation in 
visitor abundance and diversity by season and year for many annual ornamental 
cultivars. Within some genera, cultivars had similar visitor abundance, 
diversity, and main visitor taxa, while cultivars in other genera varied greatly 
in these measures. We observed only polylectic (pollen generalist) bee species 
visiting annual ornamentals, despite the presence of oligolectic (pollen 
specialist) bee species in the background population. We conclude that the 
attractiveness of annual ornamental plants likely depends on both cultivar 
characteristics and environmental context. While their role in supporting 
complex pollinator populations is limited both based on the number of and 
dietary breadth of the species they support, ornamental plants may nonetheless 
provide long-lasting supplemental foraging resources for the generalist 
pollinator communities characteristic of urban and suburban environments.
