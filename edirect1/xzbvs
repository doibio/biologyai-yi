Obesity is a medical condition caused by accumulated excess body fat with 
negative impact on patients' health, including decreased life expectancy. It has 
become a major health problem in most developed and developing countries, since 
the worldwide prevalence of obesity nearly doubled during the last 30 years. 
Consequently, novel treatments focusing on obesity are being investigated. 
Potential targets include several pathophysiological mechanisms involved in 
appetite control affecting multiple organ systems, like adipose tissue; some 
cell types in the stomach and gut; pancreas; thyroid gland; several hypothalamic 
areas; and centers located in the brainstem. One of the most important 
orexigenic neuropeptides is ghrelin, which is produced and secreted primarily by 
ghrelin cells located in the stomach and duodenum. In humans, plasma ghrelin 
levels rise when the stomach is empty and fall shortly after meal ingestion. In 
fat tissue, ghrelin increases fat storage. In the brain, it exerts its 
orexigenic action through activation of NPY/AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus. 
From the pharmacological point of view, it seems that opposing ghrelin activity 
could be used as a therapeutic principle in treating obesity. The principal idea 
of antiobesity drugs is to augment anorexigenic and lipolytic signaling, or to 
block orexigenic and lipogenic mediators. Recent studies have shown that 
therapeutic vaccines could be a new approach in the development of antiobesity 
medications. A vaccine should provoke an immune response to a specific causal 
factor for a particular disease. Several types of anti-ghrelin vaccines have 
been developed so far, with significant immune response in terms of rising 
anti-ghrelin antibodies. However, in the only clinical trial performed yet, the 
results were disappointing, showing no additional weight loss in the study 
group. Until now, several studies have demonstrated the "proof of concept", but 
more studies are required to develop prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines to 
prevent and/or cure obesity.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cost-effectiveness of brentuximab vedotin in patients 
with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma who have received autologous stem cell 
transplantation, from a Scottish healthcare payer perspective.
METHODS: A Microsoft Excel-based partitioned survival model comprising three 
health states (progression-free survival [PFS], post-progression survival, and 
death) was developed. Relevant comparators were chemotherapy with or without 
radiotherapy (C/R) and C/R with intent to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (alloSCT). Data were obtained from the pivotal phase II 
single-arm trial in 102 patients (SG035-0003; NCT00848926), a systematic 
literature review and clinical expert opinions (where empirical evidence was 
unavailable). PFS and overall survival for brentuximab vedotin were estimated 
using 5-year follow-up data from SG035-0003, and extrapolated using event rates 
observed for comparator treatments from published survival data. Resource use 
included drug acquisition and administration; alloSCT; treatment of adverse 
events; and long-term follow-up. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of uncertainty.
RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for 
brentuximab vedotin was £38,769 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) vs C/R, 
whereas C/R with intent to alloSCT was dominated by brentuximab vedotin. ICERs 
for brentuximab vedotin generated by the deterministic sensitivity analysis 
ranged between £32,000-£54,000 per QALY. Including productivity benefits reduced 
the ICER to £28,881 per QALY.
LIMITATIONS: Limitations include lack of comparative data from this single arm 
study and the heterogeneous population. Inconsistent baseline characteristic 
reporting across studies prevented complete assessment of heterogeneity and the 
extent of potential bias in clinical and cost-effectiveness estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the base case ICER is above the threshold usually applied 
in Scotland, it is relatively low compared with other orphan drugs, and lower 
than the ICER generated using a previous data cut of SG035-0003 that informed a 
positive recommendation from the Scottish Medicines Consortium, under its 
decision-making framework for assessment of ultra-orphan medicines.

During the last 20 years, waiting lists for renal transplantation (RT) have 
grown significantly older. However, elderly patients (ie ≥65 years of age) are 
still more rarely referred or accepted to waiting lists and, if enlisted, have 
less chances of actually receiving a kidney allograft, than younger 
counterparts. In this review, we looked at evidence for the benefits and risks 
of RT in the elderly trying to answer the following questions: Should RT be 
advocated for elderly patients? What should be the criteria to accept elderly 
patients on the waiting list for RT? What strategies might be used to increase 
the rate of RT in waitlisted elderly candidates? For selected elderly patients, 
RT was shown to be superior to dialysis in terms of patient survival. Virtually 
all guidelines recommend that patients should not be deemed ineligible for RT 
based on age alone, although a short life expectancy generally might preclude 
RT. Concerning the assessment of comorbidities in the elderly, special attention 
should be paid to cardiac evaluation and screening for malignancy. Comorbidity 
scores and frailty assessment scales might help the decision making on 
eligibility. Psychosocial issues should also be evaluated. To overcome the 
scarcity of organ donors, elderly RT candidates should be encouraged to consider 
expanded criteria donors and living donors, as alternatives to deceased standard 
criteria donors. It has been demonstrated that expanded criteria donor RT in 
patients 60 years or older is associated with higher survival rates than 
remaining on dialysis, whereas living donor RT is superior to all other options.

OBJECTIVE: Cost per quality-adjusted life year data are required for 
reimbursement decisions in many Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. 
EQ-5D is by far the most commonly used instrument to generate utility values in 
CEE. This study aims to systematically review the literature on EQ-5D from eight 
CEE countries.
METHODS: An electronic database search was performed up to 1 July 2015 to 
identify original EQ-5D studies from the countries of interest. We analysed the 
use of EQ-5D with respect to clinical areas, methodological rigor, population 
norms and value sets.
RESULTS: We identified 143 studies providing 152 country-specific results with a 
total sample size of 81,619: Austria (n = 11), Bulgaria (n = 6), Czech Republic 
(n = 18), Hungary (n = 47), Poland (n = 51), Romania (n = 2), Slovakia (n = 3) 
and Slovenia (n = 14). Cardiovascular (21 %), neurologic (17 %), musculoskeletal 
(15 %) and endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (13 %) were the most 
frequently studied clinical areas. Overall, 112 (78 %) of the studies reported 
EQ VAS results and 86 (60 %) EQ-5D index scores, of which 27 (31 %) did not 
specify the applied tariff. Hungary, Poland and Slovenia have population norms. 
Poland and Slovenia also have a national value set.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing use of EQ-5D is observed throughout CEE. The spread of 
health technology assessment activities in countries seems to be reflected in 
the number of EQ-5D studies. However, improvement in informed use and 
methodological quality of reporting is needed. In jurisdictions where no 
national value set is available, in order to ensure comparability we recommend 
to apply the most frequently used UK tariff. Regional collaboration between CEE 
countries should be strengthened.

BACKGROUND: Few countries record the data needed to estimate life expectancy by 
ethnic group. Such information is helpful in assessing the extent of health 
inequality.
METHOD: Life tables were created using 3 years of deaths (May 2001-April 2004) 
linked to Scottish 2001 Census data for 4.62 million individuals with 
self-reported ethnicity. We created 8 ethnic groups based on the census 
definitions, each with at least 5000 individuals and 40 deaths. Life expectancy 
at birth was calculated using the revised Chiang method.
RESULTS: The life expectancy of White Scottish males at birth was 74.7 years 
(95% CI 74.6 to 74.8), similar to Mixed Background (73.0; 70.2 to 75.8) and 
White Irish (75.0; 74.0 to 75.9), but shorter than Indian (80.9; 78.4 to 83.4), 
Pakistani (79.3; 76.9 to 81.6), Chinese (79.0; 76.5 to 81.5), Other White 
British (78.9; 78.6 to 79.2) and Other White (77.2; 76.4 to 78.1). The life 
expectancy of White Scottish females was 79.4 years (79.3 to 79.5), similar to 
mixed background (79.3; 76.6 to 82.0), but shorter than Pakistani (84.6; 82.0 to 
87.3), Chinese (83.4; 81.1 to 85.7), Indian (83.3; 80.7 to 85.9), Other White 
British (82.6; 82.3 to 82.9), other White (82.0; 81.3 to 82.8) and White Irish 
(81; 80.2 to 81.8).
CONCLUSIONS: Males and females in most of the larger ethnic minority groups in 
Scotland have longer life expectancies than the majority White Scottish 
population.

Bariatric surgery is the most effective and durable treatment of severe obesity. 
In addition to weight loss, these operations result in significant improvement 
or resolution of many obesity-related comorbid diseases. There are now numerous 
studies demonstrating that bariatric surgery decreases all-cause mortality 
long-term compared with cohorts of patients who did not undergo surgery. 
Decreases in cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular-related mortality are major 
contributors to this overall effect on life expectancy after bariatric surgery.

Kant on anatomy and the status of the life sciences.

Electronic address: michael.olson@mq.edu.au.

This paper contributes to recent interest in Kant's engagement with the life 
sciences by focusing on one corner of those sciences that has received 
comparatively little attention: physical and comparative anatomy. By attending 
to remarks spread across Kant's writings, we gain some insight into Kant's 
understanding of the disciplinary limitations but also the methodological 
sophistication of the study of anatomy and physiology. Insofar as Kant 
highlights anatomy as a paradigmatic science guided by the principle of 
teleology in the Critique of the Power of Judgment, a more careful study of 
Kant's discussions of anatomy promises to illuminate some of the obscurities of 
that text and of his understanding of the life sciences more generally. In the 
end, it is argued, Kant's ambivalence with regard to anatomy gives way to a 
pessimistic conclusion about the possibility that anatomy, natural history, and, 
by extension, the life sciences more generally might one day become true natural 
sciences.

BACKGROUND: The absence of trial data comparing robot-assisted laparoscopic 
prostatectomy and open radical retropubic prostatectomy is a crucial knowledge 
gap in uro-oncology. We aimed to compare these two approaches in terms of 
functional and oncological outcomes and report the early postoperative outcomes 
at 12 weeks.
METHOD: In this randomised controlled phase 3 study, men who had newly diagnosed 
clinically localised prostate cancer and who had chosen surgery as their 
treatment approach, were able to read and speak English, had no previous history 
of head injury, dementia, or psychiatric illness or no other concurrent cancer, 
had an estimated life expectancy of 10 years or more, and were aged between 35 
years and 70 years were eligible and recruited from the Royal Brisbane and 
Women's Hospital (Brisbane, QLD). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 
receive either robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy or radical retropubic 
prostatectomy. Randomisation was computer generated and occurred in blocks of 
ten. This was an open trial; however, study investigators involved in data 
analysis were masked to each patient's condition. Further, a masked central 
pathologist reviewed the biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens. Primary 
outcomes were urinary function (urinary domain of EPIC) and sexual function 
(sexual domain of EPIC and IIEF) at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 months and 
oncological outcome (positive surgical margin status and biochemical and imaging 
evidence of progression at 24 months). The trial was powered to assess 
health-related and domain-specific quality of life outcomes over 24 months. We 
report here the early outcomes at 6 weeks and 12 weeks. The per-protocol 
populations were included in the primary and safety analyses. This trial was 
registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), 
number ACTRN12611000661976.
FINDINGS: Between Aug 23, 2010, and Nov 25, 2014, 326 men were enrolled, of whom 
163 were randomly assigned to radical retropubic prostatectomy and 163 to 
robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. 18 withdrew (12 assigned to radical 
retropubic prostatectomy and six assigned to robot-assisted laparoscopic 
prostatectomy); thus, 151 in the radical retropubic prostatectomy group 
proceeded to surgery and 157 in the robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy 
group. 121 assigned to radical retropubic prostatectomy completed the 12 week 
questionnaire versus 131 assigned to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. 
Urinary function scores did not differ significantly between the radical 
retropubic prostatectomy group and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy 
group at 6 weeks post-surgery (74·50 vs 71·10; p=0·09) or 12 weeks post-surgery 
(83·80 vs 82·50; p=0·48). Sexual function scores did not differ significantly 
between the radical retropubic prostatectomy group and robot-assisted 
laparoscopic prostatectomy group at 6 weeks post-surgery (30·70 vs 32·70; 
p=0·45) or 12 weeks post-surgery (35·00 vs 38·90; p=0·18). Equivalence testing 
on the difference between the proportion of positive surgical margins between 
the two groups (15 [10%] in the radical retropubic prostatectomy group vs 23 
[15%] in the robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group) showed that 
equality between the two techniques could not be established based on a 90% CI 
with a Δ of 10%. However, a superiority test showed that the two proportions 
were not significantly different (p=0·21). 14 patients (9%) in the radical 
retropubic prostatectomy group versus six (4%) in the robot-assisted 
laparoscopic prostatectomy group had postoperative complications (p=0·052). 12 
(8%) men receiving radical retropubic prostatectomy and three (2%) men receiving 
robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy experienced intraoperative adverse 
events.
INTERPRETATION: These two techniques yield similar functional outcomes at 12 
weeks. Longer term follow-up is needed. In the interim, we encourage patients to 
choose an experienced surgeon they trust and with whom they have rapport, rather 
than a specific surgical approach.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To estimate the health benefits and 
cost-effectiveness of a polypill intervention (aspirin 100 mg, atorvastatin 20 
mg, ramipril 10 mg) compared with multiple monotherapy for secondary prevention 
of cardiovascular events in adults with a history of myocardial infarction from 
the perspective of the Spanish National Health System.
METHODS: An adapted version of a recently published Markov model developed and 
validated in Microsoft Excel was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of the 
polypill with that of its combined monocomponents over a 10-year time horizon. 
The population included in the model had a mean age of 64.7 years; most were 
male and had a history of myocardial infarction. The input parameters were 
obtained from a systematic literature review examining efficacy, adherence, 
utilities, and costs. The results of the model are expressed in events avoided, 
incremental costs, incremental life years, incremental quality-adjusted life 
years, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: Over a 10-year period, use of the cardiovascular polypill instead of 
its monocomponents simultaneously would avoid 46 nonfatal and 11 fatal 
cardiovascular events per 1000 patients treated. The polypill would also be a 
more effective and cheaper strategy. Probabilistic analysis of the base case 
found a 90.9% probability that the polypill would be a cost-effective strategy 
compared with multiple monotherapy at a willingness-to-pay of 30 000 euros per 
quality-adjusted life year.
CONCLUSIONS: The polypill would be a cost-effective strategy for the Spanish 
National Health System with potential clinical benefits.

Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing 210009, China.

BACKGROUND: The study investigates the magnitude and distribution of fatal road 
traffic injuries (RTIs) in the Chinese province of Jiangsu by road user.
METHOD: The 13 694 RTI deaths and years of potential life lost (YPLL) that 
occurred in 2012 were analysed; vulnerable and non-vulnerable road users were 
considered separately. Age-adjusted mortality and YPLL were compiled and the 
association between demographic characteristics and RTI mortality rate was 
analysed using negative binomial regression.
RESULTS: The age-adjusted RTI mortality and YPLL in Jiangsu in 2012 were 18.14 
(95% CI: 17.84-18.45) and 494.3 (95% CI: 492.7-496.0) per 100 000 population. 
Half of the deaths were among pedestrians and for vulnerable road users as a 
whole, male fatalities were over three times that of female (adjusted incidence 
rate ratio = 3.26, 95% CI: 1.89-3.77). Fatalities in the oldest age group (80+ 
years) were over 14 times that of the youngest one (0-9 years) (adjusted 
incidence rate ratio = 14.13, 95% CI: 9.49-21.01). Fatality rates in the central 
and northern regions surpassed that of the south.
CONCLUSION: As in the rest of the country, RTIs are a considerable public health 
problem in Jiangsu where fatality and YPLL rates fall heavily on pedestrians, 
men, and older persons and are more pronounced in the less developed regions.

BACKGROUND: The pandemic of physical inactivity is associated with a range of 
chronic diseases and early deaths. Despite the well documented disease burden, 
the economic burden of physical inactivity remains unquantified at the global 
level. A better understanding of the economic burden could help to inform 
resource prioritisation and motivate efforts to increase levels of physical 
activity worldwide.
METHODS: Direct health-care costs, productivity losses, and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) attributable to physical inactivity were estimated with 
standardised methods and the best data available for 142 countries, representing 
93·2% of the world's population. Direct health-care costs and DALYs were 
estimated for coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, 
and colon cancer attributable to physical inactivity. Productivity losses were 
estimated with a friction cost approach for physical inactivity related 
mortality. Analyses were based on national physical inactivity prevalence from 
available countries, and adjusted population attributable fractions (PAFs) 
associated with physical inactivity for each disease outcome and all-cause 
mortality.
FINDINGS: Conservatively estimated, physical inactivity cost health-care systems 
international $ (INT$) 53·8 billion worldwide in 2013, of which $31·2 billion 
was paid by the public sector, $12·9 billion by the private sector, and $9·7 
billion by households. In addition, physical inactivity related deaths 
contribute to $13·7 billion in productivity losses, and physical inactivity was 
responsible for 13·4 million DALYs worldwide. High-income countries bear a 
larger proportion of economic burden (80·8% of health-care costs and 60·4% of 
indirect costs), whereas low-income and middle-income countries have a larger 
proportion of the disease burden (75·0% of DALYs). Sensitivity analyses based on 
less conservative assumptions led to much higher estimates.
INTERPRETATION: In addition to morbidity and premature mortality, physical 
inactivity is responsible for a substantial economic burden. This paper provides 
further justification to prioritise promotion of regular physical activity 
worldwide as part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce non-communicable 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) poses major challenges 
for health care systems. Previous studies suggest that telemonitoring could be 
effective in preventing hospitalisations and hence reduce costs.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate whether telemonitoring interventions for COPD 
are cost-effective from the perspective of German statutory sickness funds.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a combination of a Markov 
model and a decision tree. Telemonitoring as add-on to standard treatment was 
compared with standard treatment alone. The model consisted of four transition 
stages to account for COPD severity, and a terminal stage for death. Within each 
cycle, the frequency of exacerbations as well as outcomes for 2015 costs and 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for each stage were calculated. Values for 
input parameters were taken from the literature. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: In the base case, telemonitoring led to an increase in incremental 
costs (€866 per patient) but also in incremental QALYs (0.05 per patient). The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was thus €17,410 per QALY gained. A 
deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that hospitalisation rate and costs 
for telemonitoring equipment greatly affected results. The probabilistic ICER 
averaged €34,432 per QALY (95 % confidence interval 12,161-56,703).
CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that telemonitoring may be cost-effective in 
Germany from a payer's point of view. This holds even after deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

BACKGROUND: Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) participation results in 
increased cardio-metabolic fitness, which is associated with reduced mortality. 
However, many graduates fail to maintain exercise post-program. ECO-PCR 
investigates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a social ecologically-based 
intervention to increase long-term exercise maintenance following the completion 
of CR.
METHODS/DESIGN: A three-site, 2-group, parallel randomized controlled trial is 
underway. 412 male and 192 female (N=604) supervised CR participants are being 
recruited just before CR graduation. Participants are randomized (1:1 concealed 
allocation) to intervention or usual care. A 50-week exercise facilitator 
intervention has been designed to assist CR graduates in the transition from 
structured, supervised exercise to self-managed home- or community-based (e.g., 
Heart Wise Exercise programs) exercise. The intervention consists of 8 telephone 
contacts over the 50week period: 3 individual and 5 group. Assessments occur at 
CR graduation, and 26, 52 and 78weeks post-randomization. The primary outcome is 
change in minutes of accelerometer-measured moderate to vigorous-intensity 
physical activity (MVPA) from CR graduation to 52weeks post-randomization. 
Secondary measures include exercise capacity, quality of life, and 
cardiovascular risk factors. Analyses will be undertaken based on 
intention-to-treat. For the primary outcome, an analysis of variance will be 
computed to test the change in minutes of MVPA in each group between CR 
graduation and 52week follow-up (2 [arm]×2 [time]). Secondary objectives will be 
assessed using mixed-model repeated measures analyses to compare differences 
between groups over time. Mean costs and quality-adjusted life years for each 
arm will be estimated.

[Quality of life during and after therapy].

[Article in French]

Taieb J.

With a three-fold increase in life expectancy between 1770 and 1970 in western 
countries, but no significant improvement since then, quality of life (QoL) has 
progressively become more and more important for healthcare evaluation. Using 
the classical evidence-based methods, QoL remains, however, quite difficult to 
assess and to analyse. Colorectal cancer is a frequent and severe disease. Major 
therapeutic advances have, however, been made during the past two decades. 
Currently 75% of patients with a non metastatic disease may expect, after 
surgical removal of their primary tumor; a long lasting remission. This is also 
the case in 40% of patients with metastatic disease suitable for surgery. 
Finally, in non-surgical, advanced disease stage cases, median overall survival 
moved from 6 to 30 months. As treatment duration and percentage of remissions 
increased, QoL has been more and more studied in these patients. Follow-up of 
patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy following complete surgical removal 
showed treatment-induced side effects impairing long term QoL. This has led to 
stopping rules. International consortiums have been developed in order to 
perform extremely large clinical trials so as to decrease the duration of 
adjuvant treatments, and thus limit the occurrence of the long lasting side 
effects impairing QoL. In patients with a more advanced disease, de-escalation 
of treatment intensity has been successfully evaluated, leading to the use of 
maintenance therapy, in order to preserve both patients' survival and QoL. These 
approaches have simplified treatment schedules, decreased the incidence of 
clinically relevant side effects and significantly improved patients QoL. They 
are currently part of our practice routine. If QoL seems today important in 
clinical trials and medico-economic assessment of new anti-cancer agents, it may 
be tomorrow integrated in daily practice through dedicated software in day 
hospital units in order to better choose each patients' tailored treatment.

Osteoblastomas are primary bone tumors with an affinity for the spine. They 
typically involve the posterior elements, although extension through the 
pedicles into the vertebral body is not uncommon. Histologically, they are 
usually indistinguishable from osteoid osteomas. However, there are different 
variants of osteoblastomas, with the more aggressive type causing more 
pronounced bone destruction, soft-tissue infiltration, and epidural extension. A 
bone scan is the most sensitive radiographic examination used to evaluate 
osteoblastomas. These osseous neoplasms usually present in the 2nd decade of 
life with dull aching pain, which is difficult to localize. At times, they can 
present with a painful scoliosis, which usually resolves if the osteoblastoma is 
resected in a timely fashion. Neurological manifestations such as radiculopathy 
or myelopathy do occur as well, most commonly when there is mass effect on nerve 
roots or the spinal cord itself. The mainstay of treatment involves surgical 
intervention. Curettage has been a surgical option, although marginal excision 
or wide en bloc resection are preferred options. Adjuvant radiotherapy and 
chemotherapy are generally not undertaken, although some have advocated their 
use after less aggressive surgical maneuvers or with residual tumor. In this 
manuscript, the authors have aimed to systematically review the literature and 
to put forth an extensive, comprehensive overview of this rare osseous tumor.

BACKGROUND: People with serious mental illness (SMI) have a 25-30 year lower 
life expectancy than the general population due largely to cardiovascular 
disease (CVD). Mediterranean diet can reduce CVD risk and repeat events by 
30-70%. We conducted a pilot feasibility study (HELFIMED) with people who have 
SMI residing within a Community Rehabilitation Centre in South Australia, aimed 
at improving participants' diets according to Mediterranean diet principles.
METHODS: During a 3-month intervention, participants were provided with 
nutrition education, food hampers, and twice-weekly cooking workshops and guided 
shopping trips. This report presents the results of a mixed method evaluation of 
the programme using thorough in-depth interviews with participants and support 
staff (n = 20), contextualized by changes in dietary biomarkers and CVD risk 
factors.
RESULTS: The framework thematic analysis revealed evidence of improvements in 
participants' knowledge of and intake of the key elements of a 
Mediterranean-style diet (fruit and vegetables, olive oil, fish, legumes), 
reduction in poor nutrition habits (soft drinks, energy drinks, take away meals) 
and development of independent living skills-culinary skills such as food 
preparation and cooking based on simple recipes, food shopping and budgeting, 
healthy meal planning and social interaction. These changes were supported by 
dietary biomarkers, and were associated with reduced CVD risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: A Mediterranean diet-based pilot study achieved positive change in 
dietary behaviours associated with CVD risk for participants with SMI. This 
supports a need to include dietary education and cooking skills into 
rehabilitation programmes for people with SMI.

Partial least squares (PLS) regression is a flexible data analytical approach, 
which can be made even more versatile and useful by various modifications. In 
this article we describe the extension into orthogonal PLS modeling, in terms of 
two new methods, called OPLS and O2PLS, with similar prediction capacity but 
improved model interpretation.

Symptoms and signs of acromegaly: an ongoing need to raise awareness among 
healthcare practitioners.

Zarool-Hassan R, Conaglen HM, Conaglen JV, Elston MS.

INTRODUCTION Chronic excess growth hormone production results in acromegaly, a 
condition associated with widespread physical changes, including soft tissue and 
bony overgrowth. When untreated, acromegaly reduces life expectancy. Patients 
usually remain undiagnosed for years after the onset of symptoms, by which stage 
irreversible physical changes have often occurred. METHOD A cross-sectional 
questionnaire study involving patients with acromegaly from the Waikato 
Endocrine Unit and the New Zealand Acromegaly Society evaluated features of 
acromegaly that were present before diagnosis. The aim of this study was to 
identify acromegaly features that were most prevalent to promote increased 
awareness about the disease by healthcare providers. RESULTS 81 participants 
were included. The main pre-diagnosis physical changes participants reported 
were acral changes, alterations in facial features and oral symptoms. For some, 
these features were present for more than 10 years before the acromegaly 
diagnosis. Multiple co-morbidities associated with acromegaly were reported. 
Two-thirds of the participants felt that an earlier diagnosis was possible. Most 
participants were in contact with General Practitioners (GPs) and/or dentists 
before diagnosis. Endocrinologists had the highest diagnosis rate, followed by 
GPs. Dentists had a low diagnosis rate despite a high prevalence of oral 
symptoms among study participants. CONCLUSION Increased awareness of acromegaly 
among primary care clinicians is important as they are the 
first-point-of-contact with the healthcare system for most patients. Health 
professionals' early recognition of symptoms and signs of acromegaly would 
reduce delays in time-to-diagnosis, enable earlier treatment and may improve 
outcomes for patients with acromegaly. MESH KEYWORDS Acromegaly; symptoms;

OBJECTIVE: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the commonest primary malignant brain tumour 
amongst the adult population. Incidence peaks in the 7th and 8th decades of life 
and as our global population ages, rates are increasing. GBM is an almost 
universally fatal disease with life expectancy in the range of 3-5months amongst 
the elderly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The assessment of elderly GBM patients prior to treatment 
decisions is poorly researched and unstandardised. In order to begin tackling 
this issue we performed a cross-sectional survey across all UK based consultant 
neuro-oncologists to review their current practice in assessing elderly GBM 
patients.
RESULTS: There were 56 respondents from a total of 93 recipients (60% response 
rate). All respondents confirmed that at least some patients aged 70 or over 
were referred to their clinics from the local multidisciplinary team meeting 
(MDT). Only 18% of consultants routinely performed a cognitive or frailty 
screening test at initial consultation. Of those who performed a screening test, 
the majority reported that the results of the test changed their treatment 
decision in approximately 50% of cases. Participants ranked performance status 
as the most important factor in determining treatment decisions.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the heterogeneity of this patient population, we argue 
that performance status is a crude measure of vulnerability within this cohort. 
Elderly GBM patients represent a unique clinical scenario because of the 
complexity of distinguishing neuro-oncology related symptoms from general 
frailty. There is a need for specific geriatric assessment models tailored to 
the elderly neuro-oncology population in order to facilitate treatment 
decisions.
