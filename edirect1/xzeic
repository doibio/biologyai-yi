Human activities threaten the future of the ecosystem by emitting pollution to 
the air, water, and soil. Considering the increasing ecological footprint (EF), 
the study focuses on investigating the role of life expectancy and hydropower 
consumption by controlling also income, trade openness, and globalization on the 
environment under the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for Turkey 
during 1971-2018. In this context, the study performs recently developed 
augmented autoregressive distributed lag (AARDL) and dynamic ARDL (DARDL) 
methods. The results show that (i) life expectancy increases the environmental 
pressure; (ii) hydropower consumption has no effect on the EF; (iii) 
globalization and trade openness reduce the EF; (iv) the EKC hypothesis is 
valid, but the estimated turning point lies between USD 19,914 and USD 20,571, 
which is far from the sample period in Turkey. From the overall results, it can 
be concluded that Turkey cannot solve environmental problems with insufficient 
income levels, an increasing elderly population, and ineffective use of 
hydropower. Hence, Turkey should rely on income much more, use hydropower much 
more efficiently, and benefit from the spillover effect of technological 
innovations related to globalization and foreign trade to significantly reduce 
the EF.

Our study investigated the impact of institutional quality on health system 
outcomes, utilizing worldwide governance indicators and analyzing data from 158 
countries between 2001 and 2020. We employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
to create a composite index of institutional quality and conducted various tests 
to select the appropriate econometric model. The role of institutional quality, 
along with other variables, in health outcomes was estimated using fixed effects 
and generalized method of moments (GMM) models. High-income and low-income 
countries were analyzed separately. The results of our study revealed that 
institutional quality, as measured by Control of Corruption, Voice and 
Accountability, Political Stability, Rule of Law, Regulatory Quality, and 
Government Effectiveness, had a negative impact on infant mortality rates and a 
positive impact on life expectancy. Similarly, variables such as GDP, mean years 
of schooling, total health expenditure, and urbanization rate showed a negative 
association with infant mortality rates and a positive association with life 
expectancy. Conversely, the logarithm of CO2 emissions exhibited a positive 
effect on infant mortality rates and a negative effect on life expectancy. These 
findings highlight the crucial role of institutional quality in determining 
health outcomes. Improving institutional quality contributes to the development 
of democratic and meritocratic systems, infrastructure enhancement, efficient 
tax and subsidy systems, optimal budget allocation, improved public education, 
and enhanced access to primary healthcare services. The influence of 
institutional quality is particularly significant in high-income countries 
compared to low-income countries. In conclusion, our study emphasizes the 
importance of institutional quality in shaping health system outcomes. Enhancing 
institutional quality is essential for the overall advancement of healthcare 
systems, encompassing governance, infrastructure, education, and access to 
healthcare services. It is crucial to prioritize efforts to improve 
institutional quality, especially in high-income countries, to achieve better 
health outcomes for populations worldwide.

Whether a nuclear installation has radiological impact and, in that case, its 
extension, are the questions behind any environmental analysis of the 
installation along its operational life. This analysis is based on the detailed 
establishment of the radiological background of the area. Accordingly, the 
dismantling and decommissioning process (D&D) of a nuclear power plant starts 
with a radiological monitoring plan, which includes the radiological 
characterization of the area and of its surroundings. At the completion of the 
D&D, unrestricted use for the site will be permitted strictly in accordance with 
results of the radiological survey within the limits established by the local 
authorities. Groundwater quality is typically included in any radiological 
analysis since, among other reasons, a significant part of it is highly likely 
to end up being extracted for domestic use and hence, human consumption. While 
there is no regulation containing maximum activity concentration or radionuclide 
guidance values for water that may be destined for uses other than public 
consumption, if groundwater is considered a "part" of the land, dose criteria 
for site release can be applied. Therefore, together with the guidance levels to 
be established for the different radionuclides expected in the groundwater, the 
detection limits to be employed when performing routine radio analytical 
characterization procedures in the laboratory should also be provided. In this 
paper, we first propose a relation of the potential radionuclides to be analyzed 
in groundwater, together with their detection limits to be achieved when the 
determinations are performed in a laboratory, and subsequently, we discuss the 
most suitable analytical methodologies and resources that would be necessary to 
undertake radiological characterization plans from a practical point of view.

Background and study aims As life expectancy increases worldwide, so does the 
prevalence of biliary tract and pancreatic disorders, resulting in rising demand 
for invasive procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 
(ERCP) in the elderly. Few studies have assessed the safety of ERCP in patients 
90 years and older, particularly among the Hispanic population. The primary aim 
of this study was to determine the technical success and adverse events (AEs) 
associated with ERCP in patients 90 years of age or older in comparison to a 
younger cohort of patients. Patients and methods A retrospective analysis of all 
ERCPs done at our institution from 2012 to 2018 was performed. Three hundred 
ERCPs in patients < 90 years old and all 28 ERCPs done in patients ≥ 90 years 
old were included in the analysis. Results ERCPs were successfully completed in 
96.4% of patients > 90 years old and 96.3% of the < 90-year-old cohort (realtive 
risk [RR] 1.00, confidence interval 0.92-1.07). There was no difference in the 
rate of periprocedural AEs. Post-ERCP AEs occurred in 7.1% and 3.0% in patients 
aged < 90 and > 90 years, respectively (RR 2.38, 0.54-10.48). No deaths were 
directly attributed to the procedure; however, inpatient mortality was higher in 
the group aged > 90 years. Conclusions ERCP is safe and effective in 
nonagenarian patients, and advanced age should not be considered an independent 
risk factor for AEs nor a contraindication for the procedure.

INTRODUCTION: Cerebral lymphoma is a rare and aggressive brain tumor. It 
accounts for 1% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and 2% of all brain tumors. 
Untreated brain lymphoma has a very poor prognosis, with an overall life 
expectancy of around 1.5 months.
CASE PRESENTATION: The authors report the case of a 35-year-old patient, with no 
previous pathological history, who presented for 3 weeks with deafness and 
recently aggravated otalgia. In MRI, brain imaging revealed a formation 
initially suggestive of an aggressive meningioma, and the histological study of 
the operative specimen was in favor of a diffuse large-cell non-germ-center B 
NHL.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Primary central nervous system lymphoma is an extra-nodal 
NHL localized to the brain, meninges, spinal cord, and eyes. In 90% of cases, 
these are diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, the other types being poorly 
characterized low-grade lymphomas, T-cell lymphomas, and Burkitt's lymphomas. 
MRI with gadolinium contrast is the gold standard for diagnosis which 
enhancement is homogeneous and well-limited, frequently associated with 
perilesional vascular edema. In T2-weighted sequences, there is a weak signal 
with restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging. The management of brain 
lymphoma is currently based on chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate combined 
with the other agents, mainly rituximab.
CONCLUSION: Cerebral lymphoma remains a non-negligible entity of central nervous 
system tumors, which can be confused with several other tumors, mainly glial and 
meningioma.

BACKGROUND: Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) is a life-threatening 
condition caused by a saprophytic fungus that predominately affecting 
immune-compromised patients. Early diagnosis of ROCM is of utmost importance to 
start the treatment as early as possible to prevent early and horrible 
complications of the disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated the imaging findings 
of 21 patients with biopsy and KOH mount-based evidence of invasive ROCM. The 
imaging was obtained from a Siemens Magnetom Amira 1.5T system with a strength 
of 1.5T or more. The spectrum of findings was evaluated for the sites of 
involvement, signal intensity, contrast characteristics, necrotic component as 
well as orbital, infratemporal, and intracranial extensions, especially 
cavernous sinuses, Meckel's cave, and the brain parenchyma.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 55.8±10.9 years and included 71% male. 
All the patients were positive for COVID-19 and the majority were diabetic. MRI 
showed predominant involvement of the maxillary sinus (17, 81%) and the 
ethmoidal sinus (15, 71.4%). The orbital extension was present in 18 cases 
(86%). T1-weighted imaging showed iso to low signal intensity in involved 
sinuses in the majority of the patients (9, 42.9%). Heterogeneously high signal 
intensity was observed in T2-weighted and short tau inversion recovery images in 
all the patients. Heterogenous contrast enhancement was present in 20 (95.2%) 
patients.
CONCLUSION: The imaging spectrum of ROCM is variable. Multiplanar MRI with 
postcontrast images is a very useful complementary tool to the clinical 
evaluation to assess the extent of disease and its complications, which has a 
high mortality. Clinicians and radiologists should be aware of the imaging 
spectrums of ROCM.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Sinonasal inverted papilloma is a rare benign tumor 
of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses (PNS). Radiological evaluation is the 
key to management.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old male presented with complaints of right nasal 
congestion and occasional bleeding for 4 months. During anterior rhinoscopy, a 
pinkish fleshy mass occupying the right nasal cavity was seen. X-ray and 
computed tomography (CT) PNS view showed opacification in the right nasal cavity 
and maxillary sinus. An MRI of the nose and PNS revealed a peculiar convoluted 
striated/cerebriform pattern. Histopathology report described the features of an 
inverted papilloma. The patient underwent endoscopic removal of the mass under 
general anesthesia. Surgical resection of the tumor was performed along with 
adjacent normal mucosal tissues. The patient recovered well and was followed-up 
for recurrence.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Sinonasal inverted papilloma is commonly found in males in 
their fifth to sixth decade of life. A CT scan is the initial modality of choice 
to evaluate the extent of the disease. MRI is superior to CT in distinguishing 
tumors from other conditions as well as to evaluate soft tissue extensions. 
Involvement of the frontal sinus is a risk factor for recurrence. The first 
option for treating an inverted papilloma is complete surgical removal with the 
adjacent uninvolved mucosa.
CONCLUSION: In a biopsy-proven case, radiological assessments like CT and MRI 
play a pivotal role in studying the typical morphology, delineating the 
extension, and detecting recurrence.

Language Science, University College London (UCL), London, UK.

OBJECTIVES: As the life expectancy of individuals with intellectual disabilities 
(ID) continues to increase, there is an increased risk of developing dementia. 
While psychosocial interventions are gaining prominence, evidence is limited for 
people with both dementia and ID. This review discusses the effectiveness of 
direct psychosocial interventions and adaptations to facilitate delivery within 
this population.
METHODS: The review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Five electronic databases, 
grey literature, and reference lists of included articles were searched for 
relevant studies. 10 eligible studies were appraised and analysed by narrative 
synthesis.
RESULTS: Ten distinct interventions were identified and categorised based on 
their purpose and delivery. All interventions were beneficial in improving a 
range of outcomes, though some studies were of low quality and most had small 
samples. Common adaptations included simplification of tasks and material, 
higher staff-to-client ratio, and alternative communication methods.
CONCLUSION: There is emerging evidence for several psychosocial interventions 
for people with ID and dementia, though further research is required on 
effectiveness and generalisability. The adaptations discussed may guide 
implementation into routine care and contribute to current policies and 
guidelines on improving ID and dementia care.

PURPOSE: Patients with advanced cancer may undergo multiple lines of treatment, 
switching therapies as their disease progresses. We developed a general 
microsimulation framework to study therapy sequence and applied it to metastatic 
prostate cancer.
METHODS: We constructed a discrete-time state transition model to study 2 lines 
of therapy. Using digitized published survival curves (progression-free 
survival, time to progression, and overall survival [OS]), we inferred event 
types (progression or death) and estimated transition probabilities using 
cumulative incidence functions with competing risks. We incorporated 
within-patient dependence over time; first-line therapy response informed 
subsequent event probabilities. Parameters governing within-patient dependence 
calibrated the model-based results to a target clinical trial. We applied these 
methods to 2 therapy sequences for metastatic prostate cancer, wherein both 
docetaxel (DCT) and abiraterone acetate (AA) are appropriate for either first- 
or second-line treatment. We assessed costs and quality-adjusted life-years (5-y 
QALYs) for 2 treatment strategies: DCT → AA versus AA → DCT.
RESULTS: Models assuming within-patient independence overestimated OS time, 
which corrected with the calibration approach. With generic pricing, AA → DCT 
dominated DCT → AA, (higher 5-y QALYs and lower costs), consistent for all 
values of calibration parameters (including no correction). Model calibration 
increased the difference in 5-y QALYs between treatment strategies (0.07 
uncorrected v. 0.15 with base-case correction). Applying the correction 
decreased the estimated difference in cost (-$5,360 uncorrected v. -$3,066 
corrected). Results were strongly affected by the cost of AA. Under a lifetime 
horizon, AA → DCT was no longer dominant but still cost-effective (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio: $19,463).
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a microsimulation approach to study the 
cost-effectiveness of therapy sequences for advanced prostate cancer, taking 
care to account for within-patient dependence.
HIGHLIGHTS: We developed a discrete-time state transition model for studying 
therapy sequence in advanced cancers.Results are sensitive to dependence within 
patients.A calibration approach can introduce dependence across lines of therapy 
and closely match simulation outcomes to target trial outcomes.

IMPORTANCE: Many patients with focal epilepsy experience seizures despite 
treatment with currently available antiseizure medications (ASMs) and may 
benefit from novel therapeutics.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of XEN1101, a novel 
small-molecule selective Kv7.2/Kv7.3 potassium channel opener, in the treatment 
of focal-onset seizures (FOSs).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging adjunctive trial investigated 
XEN1101 over an 8-week treatment period from January 30, 2019, to September 2, 
2021, and included a 6-week safety follow-up. Adults experiencing 4 or more 
monthly FOSs while receiving stable treatment (1-3 ASMs) were enrolled at 97 
sites in North America and Europe.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 2:1:1:2 to receive XEN1101, 25, 20, or 
10 mg, or placebo with food once daily for 8 weeks. Dosage titration was not 
used. On completion of the double-blind phase, patients were offered the option 
of entering an open-label extension (OLE). Patients not participating in the OLE 
had follow-up safety visits (1 and 6 weeks after the final dose).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy end point was the median 
percent change from baseline in monthly FOS frequency. Treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded and comprehensive laboratory assessments 
were made. Modified intention-to-treat analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 325 patients who were randomized and treated were included 
in the safety analysis; 285 completed the 8-week double-blind phase. In the 325 
patients included, mean (SD) age was 40.8 (13.3) years, 168 (51.7%) were female, 
and 298 (91.7%) identified their race as White. Treatment with XEN1101 was 
associated with seizure reduction in a robust dose-response manner. The median 
(IQR) percent reduction from baseline in monthly FOS frequency was 52.8% 
(P < .001 vs placebo; IQR, -80.4% to -16.9%) for 25 mg, 46.4% (P < .001 vs 
placebo; IQR, -76.7% to -14.0%) for 20 mg, and 33.2% (P = .04 vs placebo; IQR, 
 -61.8% to 0.0%) for 10 mg, compared with 18.2% (IQR, -37.3% to 7.0%) for 
placebo. XEN1101 was generally well tolerated and TEAEs were similar to those of 
commonly prescribed ASMs, and no TEAEs leading to death were reported.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The efficacy and safety findings of this clinical 
trial support the further clinical development of XEN1101 for the treatment of 
FOSs.

BACKGROUND: The Internet of Things (IoT) has gained significant attention due to 
advancements in technology and has potential applications in meeting the needs 
of an aging population. Smart technologies, a subset of IoT, can support older 
adults in aging in place, promoting independent living and improving their 
quality of life. However, there is a lack of research on how older adults and 
smart technologies coadapt over time to maximize their benefits and sustain 
adoption.
OBJECTIVE: We will aim to comprehensively review and analyze the existing 
scientific literature pertaining to the coadaptation between smart technologies 
and older adults. The primary focus will be to investigate the extent and nature 
of this coadaptation process and explore how older adults and technology 
coevolve over time to enhance older adults' experience with technology.
METHODS: This scoping review will follow the methodology outlined in the Joanna 
Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual and adhere to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping 
Reviews) guidelines for reporting. Peer-reviewed articles will be searched in 
databases like Ovid MEDLINE, OVID Embase, PEDro, OVID PsycINFO, EBSCO CINAHL, 
the Cochrane Library, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and Global Index 
Medicus. The research team will create a data extraction form covering study 
characteristics, participant characteristics, underlying models and frameworks, 
research findings, implications for technology coadaptation, and any identified 
study limitations. A directed content analysis approach will be used, 
incorporating the Selection, Optimization, and Compensation framework and Sex- 
and Gender-Based Analysis Plus theoretical framework.
RESULTS: The results of this study are expected in January 2024.
CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review endeavors to present a thorough overview of the 
available evidence concerning how smart technologies interact with older adults 
over an extended period. The insights gained from this review will lay the 
groundwork for a research program that explores how older adults adapt to and 
use smart technologies throughout their lives, ultimately leading to improved 
user satisfaction and experience and facilitating aging in place with tailored 
support and user-centered design principles.

Since 2010, US life expectancy growth has stagnated. Much research on US 
mortality has focused on working-age adults given adverse trends in drug 
overdose deaths, other external causes of death, and cardiometabolic deaths in 
midlife. We show that the adverse mortality trend at retirement ages (65+ y) has 
in fact been more consequential to the US life expectancy stagnation since 2010, 
as well as excess deaths and years of life lost in 2019, than adverse mortality 
trends at working ages. These results reveal that the United States is 
experiencing a "double jeopardy" that is driven by both mid-life and older-age 
mortality trends, but more so by older-age mortality. Understanding and 
addressing the causes behind the worsening mortality trend in older ages will be 
essential to returning to the pace of life expectancy improvements that the 
United States had experienced for decades.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether 
high-intensity laser therapy (HILT) was effective in improving pain intensity, 
cervical range of motion (ROM), functional activity, and quality of life (QOL) 
in individuals with neck pain.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, PEDro, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and 
ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to March 26, 2022.
STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving HILT for neck 
pain were selected.
DATA EXTRACTION AND DATA SYNTHESIS: Two raters were independent in data 
extraction. The methodological quality was evaluated using the PEDro scale, and 
the level of evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. RevMan5.4 was used 
for meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included and their PEDro scores were moderate to high. 
Compared with placebo, HILT was effective in improving pain intensity (SMD 2.12, 
95%CI 1.24 to 3.00; moderate quality evidence), cervical flexion (SMD 1.31, 
95%CI 0.27 to 2.35; moderate quality evidence), extension (SMD 1.43, 95%CI 0.24 
to 2.63; moderate quality evidence), right lateral flexion (SMD 1.36, 95%CI 0.15 
to 2.56; low-quality evidence). There was a trend of better outcome in 
functional activity after HILT (SMD 1.73, 95%CI -0.05 to 3.54; low quality 
evidence).
LIMITATIONS: There was limited information available on QOL.
CONCLUSION: HILT may be considered as an adjunctive treatment modality for neck 
pain. There was moderate quality evidence that HILT may improve pain intensity 
and cervical ROM in individuals with neck pain, but there was low quality 
evidence that HILT was not effective in improving functional activity.

BACKGROUND: Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning is a largely preventable 
cause of death that has received insufficient attention. We aimed to conduct a 
comprehensive global analysis of the demographic, temporal, and geographical 
patterns of fatal unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning from 2000 to 2021.
METHODS: As part of the latest Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study (GBD), unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning mortality was 
quantified using the GBD cause of death ensemble modelling strategy. Vital 
registration data and covariates with an epidemiological link to unintentional 
carbon monoxide poisoning informed the estimates of death counts and mortality 
rates for all locations, sexes, ages, and years included in the GBD. Years of 
life lost (YLLs) were estimated by multiplying deaths by remaining standard life 
expectancy at age of death. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) for 
unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning deaths due to occupational injuries and 
high alcohol use were estimated.
FINDINGS: In 2021, the global mortality rate due to unintentional carbon 
monoxide poisoning was 0·366 per 100 000 (95% uncertainty interval 0·276-0·415), 
with 28 900 deaths (21 700-32 800) and 1·18 million YLLs (0·886-1·35) across all 
ages. Nearly 70% of deaths occurred in males (20 100 [15 800-24 000]), and the 
50-54-year age group had the largest number of deaths (2210 [1660-2590]). The 
highest mortality rate was in those aged 85 years or older with 1·96 deaths 
(1·38-2·32) per 100 000. Eastern Europe had the highest age-standardised 
mortality rate at 2·12 deaths (1·98-2·30) per 100 000. Globally, there was a 
53·5% (46·2-63·7) decrease in the age-standardised mortality rate from 2000 to 
2021, although this decline was not uniform across regions. The overall PAFs for 
occupational injuries and high alcohol use were 13·6% (11·9-16·0) and 3·5% 
(1·4-6·2), respectively.
INTERPRETATION: Improvements in unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning 
mortality rates have been inconsistent across regions and over time since 2000. 
Given that unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning is almost entirely 
preventable, policy-level interventions that lower the risk of carbon monoxide 
poisoning events should be prioritised, such as those that increase access to 
improved heating and cooking devices, reduce carbon monoxide emissions from 
generators, and mandate use of carbon monoxide alarms.

MR1 : ESGE recommends the following standards for Barrett esophagus (BE) 
surveillance:- a minimum of 1-minute inspection time per cm of BE length during 
a surveillance endoscopy- photodocumentation of landmarks, the BE segment 
including one picture per cm of BE length, and the esophagogastric junction in 
retroflexed position, and any visible lesions- use of the Prague and (for 
visible lesions) Paris classification- collection of biopsies from all visible 
abnormalities (if present), followed by random four-quadrant biopsies for every 
2-cm BE length.Strong recommendation, weak quality of evidence. MR2:  ESGE 
suggests varying surveillance intervals for different BE lengths. For BE with a 
maximum extent of ≥ 1 cm and < 3 cm, BE surveillance should be repeated every 5 
years. For BE with a maximum extent of ≥ 3 cm and < 10 cm, the interval for 
endoscopic surveillance should be 3 years. Patients with BE with a maximum 
extent of ≥ 10 cm should be referred to a BE expert center for surveillance 
endoscopies. For patients with an irregular Z-line/columnar-lined esophagus of 
< 1 cm, no routine biopsies or endoscopic surveillance are advised.Weak 
recommendation, low quality of evidence. MR3:  ESGE suggests that, if a patient 
has reached 75 years of age at the time of the last surveillance endoscopy 
and/or the patient's life expectancy is less than 5 years, the discontinuation 
of further surveillance endoscopies can be considered. Weak recommendation, very 
low quality of evidence. MR4:  ESGE recommends offering endoscopic eradication 
therapy using ablation to patients with BE and low grade dysplasia (LGD) on at 
least two separate endoscopies, both confirmed by a second experienced 
pathologist.Strong recommendation, high level of evidence. MR5:  ESGE recommends 
endoscopic ablation treatment for BE with confirmed high grade dysplasia (HGD) 
without visible lesions, to prevent progression to invasive cancer.Strong 
recommendation, high level of evidence. MR6:  ESGE recommends offering complete 
eradication of all remaining Barrett epithelium by ablation after endoscopic 
resection of visible abnormalities containing any degree of dysplasia or 
esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).Strong recommendation, moderate quality of 
evidence. MR7:  ESGE recommends endoscopic resection as curative treatment for 
T1a Barrett's cancer with well/moderate differentiation and no signs of 
lymphovascular invasion.Strong recommendation, high level of evidence. MR8: 
 ESGE suggests that low risk submucosal (T1b) EAC (i. e. submucosal invasion 
depth ≤ 500 µm AND no [lympho]vascular invasion AND no poor tumor 
differentiation) can be treated by endoscopic resection, provided that adequate 
follow-up with gastroscopy, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and computed tomography 
(CT)/positrion emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is performed in 
expert centers.Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence. MR9:  ESGE suggests 
that submucosal (T1b) esophageal adenocarcinoma with deep submucosal invasion 
(tumor invasion > 500 µm into the submucosa), and/or (lympho)vascular invasion,
