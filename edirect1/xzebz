BACKGROUND: Few studies have assessed predictors of outcome in dogs with thyroid 
tumors undergoing thyroidectomy.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the survival and identify prognostic factors in dogs with 
thyroid tumors treated by thyroidectomy.
ANIMALS: A total of 144 client-owned dogs with thyroid neoplasia that underwent 
thyroidectomy.
METHODS: Retrospective study. Data for analysis included hospital attended and 
year of surgery, signalment, thyroxine concentration, thyroid tumor features 
(lobe involvement, size, invasiveness, histopathological type), thrombosis, 
metastasis, additional surgery and therapy, administration of adjuvant 
chemotherapy. The association of predictors with survival (time from surgery to 
death) were assessed by calculating cause-specific hazard ratios (HRcs ) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI). Causes of death were classified as thyroid-related or 
because of other cause.
RESULTS: Overall median survival time was 802 days (CI95% = 723-1015 days); 89 
dogs (77.4%) survived >500 days. Metastases were identified at admission in 12 
(8.3%) dogs and were associated with higher thyroid cancer-related fatality 
(HR = 5.83, CI95% = 1.56-21.78; P = .009). Thrombosis occurred in 40 dogs and 
was associated with increased risk of death because of other cause (HR = 2.73, 
CI95% = 1.18-6.35; P = .019). Nonfollicular carcinoma (HR = 4.17, 
CI95% = 1.27-13.69; P = .018) and administration of chemotherapy (HR = 3.45, 
CI95% = 1.35-8.82; P = .01) were associated with higher risk of thyroid 
cancer-related death.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Dogs with thyroid tumors undergoing 
thyroidectomy have a long life expectancy. Despite the rare presence of 
nonfollicular carcinoma and metastases, thyroidectomy should still be considered 
in some of these dogs.

BACKGROUND: It is important to investigate neural as well as muscle 
morphological adaptations to evaluate the effects of exercise training on older 
adults.
AIMS: This study was aimed to investigate the effects of home-based bodyweight 
squat training on neuromuscular adaptation in older adults.
METHODS: Twenty-five community-dwelling older adults (77.7 ± 5.0 years) were 
assigned to squat (SQU) or control (CON) groups. Those in the SQU group 
performed 100 bodyweight squats every day and the others in the CON group only 
performed daily activities for 4 months. Maximum knee extension torque and 
high-density surface electromyography during submaximal contraction were 
assessed. Individual motor units (MUs) were identified and divided into 
relatively low or high-recruitment threshold MU groups. Firing rates of each MU 
group were calculated. The muscle thickness and echo intensity of the lateral 
thigh were assessed using ultrasound. As physical tests, usual gait speed, timed 
up and go test, grip strength, and five-time chair stand test were performed.
RESULTS: While no improvements in muscle strength, muscle thickness, echo 
intensity, or physical tests were noted in either group, the firing rate of 
relatively low recruitment threshold MUs significantly decreased in the SQU 
group after intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that low-intensity home-based squat training 
could not improve markedly muscle strength or physical functions even if 
high-repetition and high frequency exercise, but could modulate slightly neural 
activation in community-dwelling older adults.

The epidemiological and societal burden of dementia is expected to increase in 
the coming decades due to the world population aging. In this context, the 
evaluation of the potential impact of intervention scenarios aiming at reducing 
the prevalence of dementia risk factors is an active area of research. However, 
such studies must account for the associated changes in mortality and the 
dependence between the risk factors. Using micro-simulations, this study aims to 
estimate the changes in dementia burden in France in 2040 according to 
intervention scenarios targeting the prevention or treatment of hypertension, 
diabetes and physical inactivity. Accounting for their communality and their 
effects on mortality, the results show that the disappearance of hypertension, 
diabetes and physical inactivity in France in 2020 could decrease dementia 
prevalence by 33% among men and 26% among women in 2040 and increase the life 
expectancy without dementia at age 65 by 3.4 years (men) and 2.6 years (women). 
Among the three factors, the prevention of hypertension would be the most 
efficient. These projections rely on current estimates of the risk of dementia 
and death associated with risk factors. Thanks to the R package developed they 
could be refined for different countries or different interventions and updated 
with new estimates.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to estimate the burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) 
attributable to high plasma glucose from 1990 to 2019.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on the disease burden were retrieved from the 
Global Burden of Disease online database. Estimated average percentage change 
(EAPC) was used to quantify the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and 
age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate (ASDR) of high 
plasma glucose-related CRC trends by sex and location between 1990 and 2019.
RESULTS: Globally, the death number and DALYs of CRC attributable to high plasma 
glucose remained a steady increase at global level from 1990 to 2019, and 
similar trends have been reported in age-standardized rate. The country with the 
largest number of death cases and DALYs of high plasma glucose-related CRC in 
2019 was China, followed by the United States of America and India. Nearly 
three-quarters of total countries experienced an increase in the ASMR and ASDR, 
and the greatest increase of ASMR and ASDR was found in Uzbekistan (EAPC = 5.32) 
and Equatorial Guinea (EAPC = 4.65), respectively. A negative correlation was 
found between sociodemographic indices and the EAPC of ASMR and ASDR (rASMR = 
-0.259, p < 0.001; rASDR = -0.282, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in mortality and DALYs of CRC attributable 
to high plasma glucose was observed in global and most countries, especially in 
the developing countries. Public health policies and targeted programs are 
needed to reduce the burden of disease.

The growing burden of herpes zoster (HZ) in Hong Kong, due to an aging 
population with increasing life expectancy, may be reduced by vaccination. This 
study aimed to estimate public health impact of HZ vaccination in Hong Kong. The 
ZOster ecoNomic Analysis (ZONA) model was adapted with Hong Kong-specific key 
model inputs/assumptions, where available. Base case analysis involved adults 
≥50 years of age (YOA), exploring three vaccination strategies (no 
vaccination/recombinant zoster vaccine [RZV]/zoster vaccine live [ZVL]) under 
private market (5% coverage) and mass vaccination (40% coverage) settings. 
Scenario and sensitivity analyses were performed. In the base case population 
(3.13 million), without vaccination, 891,024 HZ (28.4%), 156,097 post-herpetic 
neuralgia (PHN) (5.0%), and 38,755 (1.2%) HZ ophthalmicus (HZO) were projected 
over their remaining lifetime. Mass RZV vaccination reduced HZ, PHN, and HZO 
cases by 204,875 (-23.0%), 31,949 (-20.5%), and 8,471 (-21.9%), respectively, 
which was 4-5 times that reduced with ZVL. RZV was more efficient than ZVL, with 
lower number needed to vaccinate to prevent one HZ/PHN/HZO case (RZV: 7/40/148; 
ZVL: 27/163/709). Among all age cohorts, the greatest reduction in cases was 
projected for RZV (versus no vaccination/ZVL) in the youngest cohort, 50-59 YOA. 
Results were robust under scenario and sensitivity analyses. HZ burden in Hong 
Kong is substantial. Mass RZV vaccination is expected to considerably reduce 
public health burden of HZ among individuals ≥50 YOA, compared with no 
vaccination/ZVL. Results may support value assessment and decision-making 
regarding vaccination strategies for HZ prevention in Hong Kong.

Plain Language Summary: In Hong Kong, the burden of shingles is increasing due 
to an aging population with increasing life expectancy. Vaccination can prevent 
shingles and reduce disease burden. Since 2021, two shingles vaccines are 
available in Hong Kong: zoster vaccine live (ZVL) and recombinant zoster vaccine 
(RZV). Using mathematical modeling, this study compared the public health impact 
(the number of cases of disease that would occur) of different shingles 
vaccination strategies, in a hypothetical population of 3.13 million Hong Kong 
adults aged ≥50 years in their remaining lifetime. The three strategies compared 
were no vaccination versus vaccination with ZVL or RZV. With no vaccination, 
public health burden of shingles would remain high, where an estimated 2 in 7 
will have shingles, 1 in 20 will have shingles-related nerve pain, and 1 in 100 
will have shingles around the eye. Vaccination (versus no vaccination) was 
predicted to reduce these cases by 47,477 (shingles), 7,701 (nerve pain), and 
1,769 (shingles around the eye) for ZVL; and 204,875 (shingles), 31,949 (nerve 
pain), and 8,471 (shingles around the eye) for RZV. RZV avoided 4–5 times the 
number of cases compared with ZVL. Earlier RZV vaccination, from age 50 years, 
would have a greater public health impact than vaccination at a later age as the 
percentage of cases avoided with RZV (versus no vaccination) was highest in 
people aged 50–59 years compared with other age groups. These results may 
support value assessment and decision-making on public health vaccination 
strategies for shingles prevention in Hong Kong.

Cystic fibrosis is the second most common genetic disease in infancy. It is the 
result of a mutated channel protein, the CFTR, which secretes chloride ions, 
fluidifying secretions. Recent improvements in the treatment have increased life 
expectancy in these patients. Nevertheless, liver involvement remains the third 
cause of death. Unfortunately, our understating of the physiopathology is still 
deficient. Biliary obstruction secondary to the presence of thick secretions is 
considered to lead to cirrhosis. However, treatment with ursodeoxycolic acid has 
not changed the natural history. Furthermore, the presence of portal 
hypertension in the absence of cirrhosis cannot be explained. Recently, the role 
of CFTR as modulator of immune tolerance has been proposed, which could explain 
the presence of a persistent portal inflammation leading to fibrosis, and the 
gut-liver axis would also have a role in disease presentation and progression.

Publisher: La fibrosis quística, la segunda enfermedad genética más frecuente, 
es el resultado de una proteína de canal mutada, la CFTR, que secreta iones de 
cloro que fluidifican las secreciones. La esperanza de vida en los pacientes ha 
aumentado en años recientes gracias a mejoras en el tratamiento. No obstante, 
las complicaciones hepáticas son la tercera causa de muerte y la comprensión de 
su fisiopatología es aún deficiente. Se considera que la obstrucción biliar 
secundaria a la presencia de secreciones espesas conduce a la cirrosis. Sin 
embargo, el ácido ursodesoxicólico no ha modificado la historia natural. Además, 
la presencia de hipertensión portal en ausencia de cirrosis no puede ser 
explicada. Se ha propuesto el rol de la CFTR como modulador de tolerancia 
inmune, que explica la presencia de una inflamación portal persistente que 
culmina en fibrosis. El eje intestino-hígado tendría un rol importante en la 
presentación y la progresión de esta enfermedad.

PURPOSE: Degenerative cervical myelopathy is a progressive slow-motion spinal 
cord injury. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment. Baseline disability predicts 
surgical recovery; therefore, timely treatment is critical to restoring 
function. However, current challenges mean most patients present with advanced 
disease and are instead left with life changing disabilities. While short-term 
mortality is rarely reported, the long-term effects of this on life expectancy 
are unknown, including whether function could be modifiable with timely 
treatment. This article investigates the effect of DCM on life expectancy.
METHODS: The survival of patients from an observational study of patients 
undergoing surgery from 1994 to 2007 was compared to their expected survival 
using a gender- and aged -matched cohort. Comparisons were made by one sample 
log-rank test and standardised mortality ratios. Factors associated with 
survival were explored using a Cox regression analysis, including disease 
severity.
RESULTS: A total of 357 patients were included in the analysis. After a median 
follow-up of 15.3 years, 135 of 349 patients had died; 114.7 deaths would have 
been expected. The DCM cohort had an increased risk of death compared to the 
non-DCM cohort (standardised mortality ratio 1.18 [95% CI: 1.02-1.34]. Age at 
operation 1.08 (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.1, p < 0.001) and severe DCM 1.6 (95% CI: 1.06 
to 2.3, p = 0.02) were associated with worse survival (N = 287). In those 
surviving at least 2 years after surgery, only severe DCM was associated with 
conditional survival (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.04 2.4, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy is reduced in those undergoing surgery for DCM. This 
is driven by premature mortality among those left with severe disability. As 
disability can be reduced with timely treatment, these findings reinforce the 
need for collective and global action to raise awareness of DCM and enable early 
diagnosis.

Characterizing acute and chronic complications among patients with diabetes 
mellitus in community health centers.

Chamine I, Larson A, Huguet N, Angier H, Valenzuela S, Dinh D, Hwang J.

Context: Diabetes mellitus affects about 10% of the world's population and can 
lead to serious complications, which reduce life quality and expectancy. People 
with low income have higher risk of diabetes complications than those with high 
income, but data on the trends of diabetes complications in underserved 
populations are scarce. Community health centers (CHCs) serve millions of 
patients in the United States regardless of their health insurance status and 
are an ideal setting for assessing the rate of diabetes complications in 
underserved populations. Objectives: To describe diabetes-related acute and 
chronic complications among patients served by CHCs. Study Design: Retrospective 
cohort study of electronic health record data from the ADVANCE clinical research 
network. Population studied: Patients with diabetes between ages 19 and 64 
(excluding pregnant women) and ≥1 primary care ambulatory CHC visit in 2017 
(N=85,442). Outcome Measures: Rates and type of diabetes-related acute and 
chronic complications recorded in 2017. Results: The incidence of acute 
complications among patients with diabetes in 2017 was 14%. Patients 
experiencing acute diabetes-related complications had on average 1.8 
complications (range 1-33). The most common acute complications were infections 
(58.3%), abnormal blood glucose or related metabolic abnormalities (20.5%), and 
strokes or transient neurological deficits (6.8%). Patients with acute 
complications were proportionally more likely to be female, non-Hispanic white, 
have Medicaid insurance, out-of-control diabetes, a prescription for insulin, a 
diagnosis of substance use disorder, and co-occurring physical or mental 
conditions. For chronic complications, the prevalence in 2017 was 77% among 
patients with diabetes. Patients experiencing chronic diabetes-related 
complications had on average 2.3 complications (range 1-19). The most common 
chronic complications were cardiovascular disease (33.9%), endocrine/metabolic 
symptoms (22.8%), and neurological symptoms (13.0%). Patients with chronic 
complications were proportionally more likely to be male, non-Hispanic black, 
have health insurance, obesity, substance use disorder, longer period with 
diabetes diagnosis, and co-occurring conditions. Conclusions: The vast majority 
of patients with diabetes receiving care in CHCs had chronic complications. 
These findings are concerning, as diabetes-related complications are associated 
with greater healthcare utilization and patient morbidity.

OBJECTIVE: In 2018, 371,750 people were diagnosed with kidney cancer globally, 
constituting 2.2% of all cancer diagnoses. Since 2010, the number of kidney 
cancer deaths in Europe have decreased in people under 65. However, this is not 
the case in Greece and Portugal. This study estimated the mortality and lost 
productivity due to premature mortality from kidney cancer in Greece and 
Portugal.
METHODS: Years of life lost (YLL) and present value of future lost productivity 
(PVFLP) due to kidney cancer mortality (ICD-10 code: C64 - Malignant neoplasm of 
kidney, except renal pelvis) were calculated using the human capital approach. 
Age-specific mortality, mean earnings, and labor force participation rates were 
used in these calculations.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 564 and 454 kidney cancer deaths in Greece and 
Portugal, respectively, resulting in 5,871 (3,636 in males and 2,234 in females) 
and 5,397 (3,100 in males and 2,297 in females) YLL, respectively. YPLL and 
annual PVFLP were estimated to be 1,326 and €14.8 M in Greece and 1,278 and 
€11.8 M in Portugal, respectively.
CONCLUSION: YLL and PVFLP due to kidney cancer mortality are substantial in 
Greece and Portugal. These results provide new evidence to assist 
decision-makers in allocating resources to reduce cancer burden.

Rationale: Mesothelioma has become a major health burden since World War II 
because of the use of asbestos. Although many countries have imposed bans on 
asbestos, there remain significant mortality and morbidity from mesothelioma 
because of its long latent period and aggressiveness. Also, the use of asbestos 
is increasing in low-income countries, potentiating risk of mesothelioma in the 
coming decades. Assessment of the global burden of mesothelioma is required to 
take proper measures against the disease. Objectives: To assess the burden of 
mesothelioma from 1990 to 2019 at the global, regional, and national levels and 
to investigate patterns according to sex, age, sociodemographic index, and risk 
factors. Methods: The numbers, rates, and age-standardized rates of incidence, 
death, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of mesothelioma in 204 
countries and territories from 1990 to 2019 were estimated using vital 
registration and cancer registry data. The relationship between sociodemographic 
index and age-standardized DALY rate was determined, and DALYs attributable to 
occupational exposure to asbestos were calculated. Results: In 2019, there were 
34,511 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 31,199 to 37,771) incident cases of 
mesothelioma globally, with an age-standardized rate of 0.43 per 100,000 persons 
(95% UI, 0.38 to 0.47), which decreased between 1990 and 2019 by -12.6% (95% UI, 
-21.8% to -2.3%). Mesothelioma was responsible for 29,251 (95% UI, 26,668 to 
31,006) deaths in 2019, with an age-standardized rate of 0.36 deaths per 100,000 
persons (95% UI, 0.33 to 0.39), which decreased between 1990 and 2019 by -9.6% 
(95% UI, -17.8% to -1.1%). The age-standardized incidence rate increased in 
central Europe between 1990 and 2019 by 46.1% (95% UI, 16.6% to 72.4%). The 
Netherlands, Australia, and the United Kingdom had the highest age-standardized 
incidence rates. Incidence rates were higher in men than in women ages 45-49 to 
90-94 years, peaking at 85-89 years. Occupational exposure to asbestos 
contributed to 85.2% (95% UI, 82.1% to 88.1%) of DALYs. Conclusions: The global 
burden of mesothelioma is decreasing in terms of age-standardized incidence and 
mortality rates. Mesothelioma remains a substantial public health challenge in 
many parts of the world.

FK506-sensitive proline rotamase 1 protein (Fpr1p), which is a homologue of the 
mammalian prolyl isomerase FK506-binding protein of 12 kDa (FKBP12), is known to 
play important roles in protein folding and prevention of protein aggregation. 
Although rapamycin is known to bind to Fpr1p to inhibit Tor1p 
mediated-mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) activity, the physiological 
functions of Fpr1p on lifespan remain unclear. In this study, we used the 
eukaryotic model Saccharomyces cerevisiae to demonstrate that deletion of FPR1 
reduced yeast chronological lifespan (CLS), and there was no benefit on lifespan 
upon rapamycin treatment, indicating that lifespan extension mechanism of 
rapamycin in yeast is exclusively dependent on FPR1. Furthermore, there was a 
significant increase in CLS of fpr1Δ cells during caloric restriction (CR), 
suggesting that rapamycin affects lifespan in a different way compared to CR. 
This study highlights the importance of FPR1 for rapamycin-induced lifespan 
extension.

Increased life expectancy is posing unprecedented challenges to healthcare 
systems worldwide. These include a sharp increase in the prevalence of chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) and of impaired nutritional status with 
malnutrition-protein-energy wasting (PEW) that portends worse clinical outcomes, 
including reduced survival. In older adults with CKD, a nutritional dilemma 
occurs when indications from geriatric nutritional guidelines to maintain the 
protein intake above 1.0 g/kg/day to prevent malnutrition need to be adapted to 
the indications from nephrology guidelines, to reduce protein intake in order to 
prevent or slow CKD progression and improve metabolic abnormalities. To address 
these issues, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) 
and the European Renal Nutrition group of the European Renal Association 
(ERN-ERA) have prepared this conjoint critical review paper, whose objective is 
to summarize key concepts related to prevention and treatment of both CKD 
progression and impaired nutritional status using dietary approaches, and to 
provide guidance on how to define optimal protein and energy intake in older 
adults with differing severity of CKD. Overall, the authors support careful 
assessment to identify the most urgent clinical challenge and the consequent 
treatment priority. The presence of malnutrition-protein-energy wasting (PEW) 
suggests the need to avoid or postpone protein restriction, particularly in the 
presence of stable kidney function and considering the patient's preferences and 
quality of life. CKD progression and advanced CKD stage support prioritization 
of protein restriction in the presence of a good nutritional status. Individual 
risk-benefit assessment and appropriate nutritional monitoring should guide the 
decision-making process. Higher awareness of the challenges of nutritional care 
in older adult patients with CKD is needed to improve care and outcomes. 
Research is advocated to support evidence-based recommendations, which we still 
lack for this increasingly large patient subgroup.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported the cost-effectiveness of 
sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in heart failure patients; however, 
their economic implications have not been sufficiently elucidated in Japan.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of empagliflozin plus standard of care (SoC) vs. SoC for patients with heart 
failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in Japan. Model inputs, including 
risk of clinical events, costs, and utilities based on Kansas City 
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Scores were derived from 
EMPEROR-Reduced trial data, published literature, and a claims database.
RESULTS: The model predicted lower lifetime hospitalizations for heart failure 
(HHFs) and additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 0.21) for 
empagliflozin plus SoC vs. SoC in the overall population. Increased costs of 
¥100,495/patient ($772/patient), primarily driven by higher drug costs of 
¥239,558/patient ($1,840/patient), were largely offset by reduced HHF management 
costs of -¥166,160/patient (-$1,276/patient), yielding an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ¥469,672/QALY ($3,608/QALY). Results were 
consistent among subgroups and sensitivity analyses. In probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, 82.5 % of runs were below the Japanese ICER reference 
value of ¥5,000,000/QALY ($38,408/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin was demonstrated to be cost-effective for HFrEF 
patients in Japan based on the EMPEROR-Reduced trial data.

BACKGROUND: Pathological fractures are challenging in orthopedic surgery and 
oncology, with implications for the patient's quality of life, mobility and 
mortality. The efficacy of oncological treatment on life expectancy for cancer 
patients has improved, but the metastatic pattern for bone metastases and 
survival is diverse for different tumor types. This study aimed to evaluate 
survival in relation to age, sex, primary tumor and site of the pathological 
fractures.
METHODS: All pathological fractures due to cancer between 1 September 2014 and 
31 December 2021 were included in this observational study from the Swedish 
Fracture Register (SFR). Data on age, sex, tumor type, fracture site and 
mortality were collected.
RESULTS: A total of 1453 patients with pathological fractures were included (48% 
women, median age 73, range 18-100 years). Unknown primary tumors were the most 
common primary site (n = 308). The lower extremities were the most common site 
of pathological fractures. Lung cancer had the shortest median survival of 
78 days (range 54-102), and multiple myeloma had the longest median survival of 
432 days (range 232-629). The site at the lower extremity had the shortest 
(187 days, range 162-212), and the spine had the longest survival (386 days, 
range 211-561). Age, sex, primary type and site of the pathological fractures 
were all associated with mortality.
INTERPRETATION: Age, sex, primary tumor type and site of pathological fractures 
were associated with survival. Survival time is short and correlated with 
primary tumor type, with lung cancer as the strongest negative predictor of 
survival.

BACKGROUND: The complexity of sleep hinders the formulation of sleep guidelines. 
Recent studies suggest that different unhealthy sleep characteristics jointly 
increase the risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aimed to 
estimate the differences in CVD-free life expectancy between people with 
different sleep profiles.
METHODS: We included 308,683 middle-aged adults from the UK Biobank among whom 
140,181 had primary care data linkage. We used an established composite sleep 
score comprising self-reported chronotype, duration, insomnia complaints, 
snoring, and daytime sleepiness to derive three sleep categories: poor, 
intermediate, and healthy. We also identified three clinical sleep disorders 
captured by primary care and inpatient records within 2 years before enrollment 
in the cohort: insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, and other sleep 
disorders. We estimated sex-specific CVD-free life expectancy with three-state 
Markov models conditioning on survival at age 40 across different sleep profiles 
and clinical disorders.
RESULTS: We observed a gradual loss in CVD-free life expectancy toward poor 
sleep such as, compared with healthy sleepers, poor sleepers lost 1.80 [95% CI 
0.96-2.75] and 2.31 [1.46-3.29] CVD-free years in females and males, 
respectively, while intermediate sleepers lost 0.48 [0.41-0.55] and 0.55 
[0.49-0.61] years. Among men, those with clinical insomnia or sleep-related 
breathing disorders lost CVD-free life by 3.84 [0.61-8.59] or 6.73 [5.31-8.48] 
years, respectively. Among women, sleep-related breathing disorders or other 
sleep disorders were associated with 7.32 [5.33-10.34] or 1.43 [0.20-3.29] years 
lost, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Both self-reported and doctor-diagnosed poor sleep are negatively 
associated with CVD-free life, especially pronounced in participants with 
sleep-related breathing disorders.

One of the significant limitations of aquaculture worldwide is the prevalence of 
divalent copper (Cu). Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) are economically important 
freshwater species adapted to a variety of environmental stimuli, including 
heavy metal stresses; however, large-scale transcriptomic data of the 
hepatopancreas of crayfish in response to Cu stress are still scarce. Here, 
integrated comparative transcriptome and weighted gene co-expression network 
analyses were initially applied to investigate gene expression profiles of the 
hepatopancreas of crayfish subjected to Cu stress for different periods. As a 
result, 4662 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified 
following Cu stress. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the "focal adhesion" 
pathway was one of the most significantly upregulated response pathways 
following Cu stress, and seven DEGs mapped to this pathway were identified as 
hub genes. Furthermore, the seven hub genes were examined by quantitative PCR, 
and each was found to have a substantial increase in transcript abundance, 
suggesting a critical role of the "focal adhesion" pathway in the response of 
crayfish to Cu stress. Our transcriptomic data can be a good resource for the 
functional transcriptomics of crayfish, and these results may provide valuable 
insights into the molecular response mechanisms underlying crayfish to Cu 
stress.

We characterized Xenopus laevis C-C motif chemokine ligand 19.L (ccl19.L) and 
C-C motif chemokine ligand 21.L (ccl21.L) during early Xenopus embryogenesis. 
The temporal and spatial expression patterns of ccl19.L and ccl21.L tended to 
show an inverse correlation, except that the expression level was higher in the 
dorsal side at the gastrula stage. For example, even at the dorsal sector of the 
gastrulae, ccl19.L was expressed in the axial region and ccl21.L was expressed 
in the paraxial region. Dorsal overexpression of ccl19.L and ccl21.L and 
knockdown of Ccl19.L and Ccl21.L inhibited gastrulation, but their functions 
were different in cell behaviors during morphogenesis. Observation of Keller 
sandwich explants revealed that overexpression of both ccl19.L and ccl21.L and 
knockdown of Ccl21.L inhibited the convergent extension movements, while 
knockdown of Ccl19.L did not. ccl19.L-overexpressing explants attracted cells at 
a distance and ccl21.L-overexpressing explants attracted neighboring cells. 
Ventral overexpression of ccl19.L and ccl21.L induced secondary axis-like 
structures and chrd.1 expression at the ventral side. Upregulation of chrd.1 was 
induced by ligand mRNAs through ccr7.S. Knockdown of Ccl19.L and Ccl21.L 
inhibited gastrulation and downregulated chrd.1 expression at the dorsal side. 
The collective findings indicate that ccl19.L and ccl21.L might play important 
roles in morphogenesis and dorsal-ventral patterning during early embryogenesis 
in Xenopus.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Superior turbinate manipulation is often required in 
cases of narrow cavities and expanded endonasal approaches with concern for 
olfaction. The objective of the study was to compare the pre- and postoperative 
olfactory function in patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal 
pituitary excision with and without superior turbinectomy, using the Pocket 
Smell Identification Test and the quality of life (QOL) and Sinonasal Outcome 
Test-22 (SNOT-22) scores, irrespective of the extension (Knosp grading) of 
pituitary tumors. We also aimed to identify olfactory neurons in the excised 
superior turbinate with immunohistochemical (IHC) stains and correlate them with 
clinical findings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a prospective, randomized study performed 
in a tertiary center. Two groups A and B, with superior turbinate preserved and 
resected, respectively, during endoscopic pituitary resection, were compared 
using pre- and postoperative Pocket Smell Identification Test and QOL and 
SNOT-22 scores. The superior turbinate was subjected to IHC staining to identify 
the presence of olfactory neurons in patients with tumors of pituitary gland 
requiring endoscopic trans-sphenoid resection.
