BACKGROUND: Systematic collection of mortality/morbidity data over time is 
crucial for monitoring trends in population health, developing health policies, 
assessing the impact of health programs. In Poland, a comprehensive analysis 
describing trends in disease burden for major conditions has never been 
published. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 
provides data on the burden of over 300 diseases in 195 countries since 1990. We 
used the GBD database to undertake an assessment of disease burden in Poland, 
evaluate changes in population health between 1990-2017, and compare Poland with 
other Central European (CE) countries.
METHODS: The results of GBD 2017 for 1990 and 2017 for Poland and CE were used 
to assess rates and trends in years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with 
disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Data came from 
cause-of-death registration systems, population health surveys, disease 
registries, hospitalization databases, and the scientific literature. Analytical 
approaches have been used to adjust for missing data, errors in cause-of-death 
certification, and differences in data collection methodology. Main estimation 
strategies were ensemble modelling for mortality and Bayesian meta-regression 
for disability.
RESULTS: Between 1990-2017, age-standardized YLL rates for all causes declined 
in Poland by 46.0% (95% UI: 43.7-48.2), YLD rates declined by 4.0% (4.2-4.9), 
DALY rates by 31.7% (29.2-34.4). For both YLLs and YLDs, greater relative 
declines were observed for females. There was a large decrease in communicable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disease DALYs (48.2%; 46.3-50.4). DALYs due 
to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) decreased slightly (2.0%; 0.1-4.6). In 2017, 
Poland performed better than CE as a whole (ranked fourth for YLLs, sixth for 
YLDs, and fifth for DALYs) and achieved greater reductions in YLLs and DALYs 
than most CE countries. In 2017 and 1990, the leading cause of YLLs and DALYs in 
Poland and CE was ischaemic heart disease (IHD), and the leading cause of YLDs 
was low back pain. In 2017, the top 20 causes of YLLs and YLDs in Poland and CE 
were the same, although in different order. In Poland, age-standardized DALYs 
from neonatal causes, other cardiovascular and circulatory diseases, and road 
injuries declined substantially between 1990-2017, while alcohol use disorders 
and chronic liver diseases increased. The highest observed-to-expected ratios 
were seen for alcohol use disorders for YLLs, neonatal sepsis for YLDs, and 
falls for DALYs (3.21, 2.65, and 2.03, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: There was relatively little geographical variation in premature 
death and disability in CE in 2017, although some between-country differences 
existed. Health in Poland has been improving since 1990; in 2017 Poland 
outperformed CE as a whole for YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs. While the health gap 
between Poland and Western Europe has diminished, it remains substantial. The 
shift to NCDs and chronic disability, together with marked between-gender health 
inequalities, poses a challenge for the Polish health-care system. IHD is still 
the leading cause of disease burden in Poland, but DALYs from IHD are declining. 
To further reduce disease burden, an integrated response focused on NCDs and 
population groups with disproportionally high burden is needed.

BACKGROUND: Cancer care is evolving rapidly, and costs and value of new 
treatments are frequently debated. Up-to-date evidence on the total cost of 
cancer is needed to inform policy decisions. This study estimates the cost of 
cancer in Europe in 2018 and extends a previous analysis for 1995-2014.
METHODS: Cancer-specific health expenditure were derived from national 
estimates. Data on cancer drug sales were obtained from IQVIA. The productivity 
loss from premature mortality was estimated from data from Eurostat and the 
World Health Organization. Estimates of the productivity loss from morbidity and 
informal care costs were based on previous studies.
FINDINGS: The total cost of cancer was €199 billion in Europe (EU-27 plus 
Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) in 2018. Total costs 
ranged from €160 per capita in Romania to €578 in Switzerland (after adjustment 
for price differentials). Health expenditure on cancer care were €103 billion, 
of which €32 billion were spent on cancer drugs. Informal care costs were €26 
billion. The total productivity loss was €70 billion, composed of €50 billion 
from premature mortality and €20 billion from morbidity.
INTERPRETATION: Health expenditure on cancer care were of a similar magnitude as 
the sum of non-health-care costs in 2018. Over the last two decades, health 
spending on cancer has increased faster than the increase in cancer incidence. 
The productivity loss from premature mortality has decreased because of 
reductions in mortality in the working-age population. Trends in informal care 
costs and productivity loss from morbidity are uncertain because of lack of 
comparable data.

In the last fifty years, there has been a great improvement in social and health 
conditions. This have led to a significant increase in human lifespan as never 
seen before. In Italy, older persons are the fastest growing sector of society, 
mainly due to scientific progress but also to a decrease in the natality rate. 
According to the latest WHO data published in 2018, life expectancy in Italy is 
80.5 for males and 84.9 for females, with a total life expectancy of 82.9 [...].

Over one third of Australians' daily energy intake is from discretionary foods 
and drinks. While many health promotion efforts seek to limit discretionary food 
intake, the population health impact of reductions in the consumption of 
different types of discretionary foods (e.g., sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), 
confectionery, sweet biscuits) has not been quantified. This study estimated the 
potential reductions in body weight, obesity-related disease incidence, and 
healthcare cost savings associated with consumption of one less serving per week 
of different discretionary foods. Reductions in the different types of 
discretionary food were modelled individually to estimate the impact on energy 
consumption and population body weight by 5-year age and sex groups. It was 
assumed that one serving of discretionary food each week was replaced with 
either a serving of fruit or popcorn, and a serving (375 mL) of SSBs was 
replaced with coffee, tea, or milk. Proportional multi-state multiple-cohort 
Markov modelling estimated likely resultant health adjusted life years (HALYs) 
gained and healthcare costs saved over the lifetime of the 2010 Australian 
population. A reduction of one serving of SSBs (375 mL) had the greatest 
potential impact in terms of weight reduction, particularly in ages 19-24 years 
(mean 0.31 kg, 95% UI: 0.23 kg to 0.37 kg) and overall healthcare cost savings 
of AUD 793.4 million (95% UI: 589.1 M to 976.1 M). A decrease of one serving of 
sweet biscuits had the second largest potential impact on weight change overall, 
with healthcare cost savings of $640.7 M (95% CI: $402.6 M to $885.8 M) and the 
largest potential weight reduction amongst those aged 75 years and over (mean 
0.21 kg, 95% UI: 0.14 kg to 0.27 kg). The results demonstrate that small 
reductions in discretionary food consumption are likely to have substantial 
health benefits at the population level. Moreover, the study highlights that 
policy responses to improve population diets may need to be tailored to target 
different types of foods for different population groups.

The increased life expectancy of adult individuals with developmental 
disabilities and the likelihood of parents having to continue caregiving into 
their old age is an emerging international issue which deserves investigation, 
especially concerning satisfaction with caregiving. Moreover, this needs to be 
assessed in different cultures in order to create a better understanding of how 
families are best supported in their lifelong caregiving. A sample of 408 
parents was gathered in six cities across Iran with a son or daughter who had a 
confirmed developmental disability. Self-completed measures of satisfaction and 
stress were obtained along with demographic details of the child and family. 
Satisfaction with caring was generally positive and was similar for mothers and 
fathers, for older as well as for younger parents; and between different types 
of developmental disabilities. However, both personal and child satisfaction 
decreased when parents reported increased stress and when caring for teenage and 
adult offspring and those with behavior problems. Parents need to receive 
support to sustain their motivation and satisfaction with caregiving if their 
quality of life and that of their children with disabilities is to be maintained 
and enhanced across their lifespan.

To characterize cultivar variation in resistance gene (R-gene)-mediated calcium 
signaling and hormonal regulation in effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and 
disease susceptibility, Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) was 
inoculated in two Brassica napus cultivars (cvs. Capitol and Mosa). At 14 days 
post inoculation (DPI) with Xcc, there was a necrotic lesion in cv. Mosa along 
with the significant accumulation of H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA), whereas no 
visual symptom was observed in cv. Capitol. The cultivar variations in the 
R-gene expressions were found in response to Xcc. ZAR1 is a 
coiled-coil-nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR)-type R-gene 
that is significantly induced in cv. Capitol, whereas toll/interleukin-1 
receptor-nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat (TIR-NB-LRR)-type R-gene, 
TAO1, is significantly upregulated in cv. Mosa Xcc-inoculated plants. The 
defense-related gene's non-race-specific disease resistance 1 (NDR1) and 
mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6) were enhanced, whereas 
calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK5) and calcium-sensing protein 60g 
(CBP60g) were depressed in cv. Capitol Xcc inoculated plants, and opposite 
results were found in cv. Mosa. The calcium-sensing receptor (CAS), calmodulin 
(CaM), expression was induced in both the cultivars. However, the CAS induction 
rate was much higher in cv. Mosa than in cv. Capitol in response to Xcc. The 
phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) levels were 
significantly higher in cv. Capitol along with the enhanced SA receptors (NPR3 
and NPR4) and JA synthesis and signaling-related gene expression (LOX2, PDF1.2), 
whereas the JA level was significantly lower in cv. Mosa Xcc inoculated plants. 
The SA synthesis and signaling-related genes (ICS1, NPR1) and SA were present at 
higher levels in cv. Mosa; additionally, the SA level present was much higher in 
the susceptible cultivar (cv. Mosa) than in the resistant cultivar (cv. Capitol) 
in response to Xcc. These results indicate that ZAR1 mediated the coordinated 
action of SA and JA synthesis and signaling to confirm ETI, whereas TAO1 
enhanced the synthesis of SA through CAS and CBP60g to antagonize JA synthesis 
and signaling to cause disease susceptibility in the Brassica napus-Xcc 
pathosystem.

The aging of the Taiwanese population has become a major issue. Previous 
research has focused on the burden and stress faced by caregivers, but has not 
explored how the experience of these caregivers influences decisions of advance 
care planning (ACP). Semi-structured and in-depth interviews were conducted. 
Qualitative content analysis was used to identify important themes. Five themes 
and fourteen sub-themes were identified: (1) Past experiences: patient wishes, 
professional recommendations, and expectation about disease progress; (2) Impact 
of care on family members: positive affirmation, open-minded life, social 
isolation and health effects, and financial and life planning effects; (3) 
Attitude toward life: not forcing to stay, and not becoming a burden, (4) 
Expected proxy dilemmas: torment between doing or not, seeing the extension of 
suffering and toil, and remorse and self-blame; (5) Expectation of end of life 
(EOL) care: caregiver's experience and EOL care decisions, and practicality of 
EOL decision making. After making multiple medical decisions for their disabled 
relatives, caregivers are able to calmly face their own medical decisions, and 
"not becoming a burden" is their primary consideration. It's suggested that 
implementation of shared decision-making on medical care for patients with 
chronic disability will not only improve the quality of their medical care but 
also reduce the development of remorse and guilty feelings of caregivers after 
making medical decisions.

Government and nongovernmental organizations need national and global estimates 
on the descriptive epidemiology of common oral conditions for policy planning 
and evaluation. The aim of this component of the Global Burden of Disease study 
was to produce estimates on prevalence, incidence, and years lived with 
disability for oral conditions from 1990 to 2017 by sex, age, and countries. In 
addition, this study reports the global socioeconomic pattern in burden of oral 
conditions by the standard World Bank classification of economies as well as the 
Global Burden of Disease Socio-demographic Index. The findings show that oral 
conditions remain a substantial population health challenge. Globally, there 
were 3.5 billion cases (95% uncertainty interval [95% UI], 3.2 to 3.7 billion) 
of oral conditions, of which 2.3 billion (95% UI, 2.1 to 2.5 billion) had 
untreated caries in permanent teeth, 796 million (95% UI, 671 to 930 million) 
had severe periodontitis, 532 million (95% UI, 443 to 622 million) had untreated 
caries in deciduous teeth, 267 million (95% UI, 235 to 300 million) had total 
tooth loss, and 139 million (95% UI, 133 to 146 million) had other oral 
conditions in 2017. Several patterns emerged when the World Bank's 
classification of economies and the Socio-demographic Index were used as 
indicators of economic development. In general, more economically developed 
countries have the lowest burden of untreated dental caries and severe 
periodontitis and the highest burden of total tooth loss. The findings offer an 
opportunity for policy makers to identify successful oral health strategies and

BACKGROUND: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a fatal neurological disease caused by 
abnormal infectious proteins called prions. Prions that are present on surgical 
instruments cannot be completely deactivated; therefore, patients who are 
subsequently operated on using these instruments may become infected. This can 
result in surgically transmitted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
OBJECTIVE: To update literature reviews, consultation with experts and economic 
modelling published in 2006, and to provide the cost-effectiveness of strategies 
to reduce the risk of surgically transmitted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
METHODS: Eight systematic reviews were undertaken for clinical parameters. One 
review of cost-effectiveness was undertaken. Electronic databases including 
MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 2005 to 2017. Expert elicitation sessions 
were undertaken. An advisory committee, convened by the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence to produce guidance, provided an additional source of 
information. A mathematical model was updated focusing on brain and posterior 
eye surgery and neuroendoscopy. The model simulated both patients and instrument 
sets. Assuming that there were potentially 15 cases of surgically transmitted 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease between 2005 and 2018, approximate Bayesian 
computation was used to obtain samples from the posterior distribution of the 
model parameters to generate results. Heuristics were used to improve 
computational efficiency. The modelling conformed to the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence reference case. The strategies evaluated included 
neither keeping instruments moist nor prohibiting set migration; ensuring that 
instruments were kept moist; prohibiting instrument migration between sets; and 
employing single-use instruments. Threshold analyses were undertaken to 
establish prices at which single-use sets or completely effective 
decontamination solutions would be cost-effective.
RESULTS: A total of 169 papers were identified for the clinical review. The 
evidence from published literature was not deemed sufficiently strong to take 
precedence over the distributions obtained from expert elicitation. Forty-eight 
papers were identified in the review of cost-effectiveness. The previous 
modelling structure was revised to add the possibility of misclassifying 
surgically transmitted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease as another neurodegenerative 
disease, and assuming that all patients were susceptible to infection. Keeping 
instruments moist was estimated to reduce the risk of surgically transmitted 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases and associated costs. Based on probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses, keeping instruments moist was estimated to on average 
result in 2.36 (range 0-47) surgically transmitted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
cases (across England) caused by infection occurring between 2019 and 2023. 
Prohibiting set migration or employing single-use instruments reduced the 
estimated risk of surgically transmitted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases 
further, but at considerable cost. The estimated costs per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained of these strategies in addition to keeping instruments moist 
were in excess of £1M. It was estimated that single-use instrument sets 
(currently £350-500) or completely effective cleaning solutions would need to 
cost approximately £12 per patient to be cost-effective using a £30,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained value.
LIMITATIONS: As no direct published evidence to implicate surgery as a cause of 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has been found since 2005, the estimations of 
potential cases from elicitation are still speculative. A particular source of 
uncertainty was in the number of potential surgically transmitted 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases that may have occurred between 2005 and 2018.
CONCLUSIONS: Keeping instruments moist is estimated to reduce the risk of 
surgically transmitted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases and associated costs. 
Further surgical management strategies can reduce the risks of surgically 
transmitted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease but have considerable associated costs.

Plain Language Summary: The aims of this report were to summarise evidence 
relating to surgically transmitted Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and to explore the 
value for money of strategies to reduce the chance of any future surgically 
transmitted Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease cases. Current recommendations include 
keeping sets of surgical instruments together for high-risk operations and using 
separate instruments for people born after 1996. The project involved reviewing 
published papers, speaking with experts and building a computer model. The 
literature reviews found that Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease occurs in around 1–2 per 
million people and that no definite cases of surgically transmitted 
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease have been observed since the 1970s. The reviews also 
looked for information on the possibility of patients being infected with 
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease after having surgery on high-risk tissues, such as the 
brain and the back of the eye. They found that there was a great deal of 
uncertainty regarding who might have Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, but not yet have 
symptoms, as well as the risk of transmission and the ability of strategies to 
reduce this risk. The computer model aimed to estimate value for money of 
different strategies to reduce the risks of surgically transmitted 
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. However, the reviews found that some of the numbers 
needed for the model were not known, so experts were asked to estimate this 
information instead along with the range of possible values. This information 
included the effectiveness of different cleaning practices and the chances of 
infected tissue being transmitted between patients undergoing high-risk surgery. 
The model found that keeping surgical instruments moist prior to cleaning was 
likely to save money and reduce the chance of future surgically transmitted 
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease cases. However, additional measures, such as using 
only sets of single-use instruments, ensuring that instruments were kept 
together in their sets or using separate instruments for those born after 1996, 
appeared to be poor value for money.

BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous disease in which an 
implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) effectively prevents sudden cardiac 
death in at-risk individuals. Nevertheless, the cost-effectiveness of ICDs in 
this specific patient group has not been evaluated.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was constructed to simulate the course of 
identified adult persons with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with and without an 
ICD over the course of 12 years based on Swedish disease-specific unit costs. 
The age distribution was based on empirical data from the nationwide cohort of 
HCM patients with ICDs (mean age at the time of implant was 51.8 years). The 
outcomes were costs per saved life and cost per gained quality adjusted life 
year (QALY).
RESULTS: Of 1000 simulated patients, 402 lives were saved after 12 years with an 
ICD at a cost of 646,000 Swedish krona (SEK), which corresponds to 57,118 Euro 
per saved life from the health care sector viewpoint. The cost per gained QALY 
(the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER)) was 171,000 SEK (15,119 Euro). 
From a societal viewpoint, including effects on productivity losses, the use of 
an ICD was absolutely dominant (both cheaper and better, and thus an ICER is of 
no interest). Both the one-way sensitivity analyses and the probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses supported the findings in the base option.
CONCLUSION: For identified patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy deemed at 
high risk of sudden cardiac death, the use of an ICD is extremely cost 
effective, both in terms of the cost for saved lives and gained QALY.

In north-western Europe, the common tick, Ixodes ricinus, is widely established, 
its distribution appears to be increasing and the spread of tick-borne diseases 
is of increasing concern. The project 'Flått i Nord' (Ticks in northern Norway) 
commenced in spring 2009 with the intention of studying the tick's distribution 
and that of its pathogens in northern Norway. Several methods were used: 
cloth-dragging, collecting from trapped small mammals, and collecting from pets. 
Since 2010, the occurrence of ticks in the region of northern Norway was 
determined directly by cloth-dragging 167 times in 109 separate locations 
between the latitudes of 64 °N and 70 °N (included seven locations in the 
northern part of Trøndelag County). The northernmost location of a permanent I. 
ricinus population was found to be Nordøyvågen (66.2204 °N, 12.59 °E) on the 
Island of Dønna. In a sample of 518 nymphal and adult ticks, the Borrelia 
prevalence collected close to this distribution limit varied but was low (1-15 
%) compared with the locations in Trøndelag, south of the study area (15-27 %). 
Five specimens (1 %) were positive for Rickettsia helvetica. The length of the 
vegetation growing season (GSL) can be used as an approximate index for the 
presence of established populations of I. ricinus. The present study suggests 
that the threshold GSL for tick establishment is about 170 days, because the 
median GSL from 1991 to 2015 was 174-184 days at sites with permanent tick 
populations, showing a clear increase compared with the period 1961-1990. This 
apparent manifestation of climate change could explain the northward extension 
of the range of I. ricinus.

Whole-genome sequencing of preimplantation human embryos to detect and screen 
for genetic diseases is a technically challenging extension to preconception 
screening. Combining preconception genetic screening with preimplantation 
testing of human embryos facilitates the detection of de novo mutations and 
self-validates transmitted variant detection in both the reproductive couple and 
the embryo's samples. Here we describe a trio testing workflow that involves 
whole-genome sequencing of amplified DNA from biopsied embryo trophectoderm 
cells and genomic DNA from both parents. Variant prediction software and 
annotation databases were used to assess variants of unknown significance and 
previously not described de novo variants in five single-gene preimplantation 
genetic testing couples and eleven of their embryos. Pathogenic variation, 
tandem repeat, copy number and structural variations were examined against 
variant calls for compound heterozygosity and predicted disease status was 
ascertained. Multiple trio testing showed complete concordance with known 
variants ascertained by single-nucleotide polymorphism array and uncovered de 
novo and transmitted pathogenic variants. This pilot study describes a method of 
whole-genome sequencing and analysis for embryo selection in high-risk couples 
to prevent early life fatal genetic conditions that adversely affect the quality 
of life of the individual and families.

The iota toxin produced by Clostridium perfringens type E is a binary toxin 
comprising two independent polypeptides: Ia, an ADP-ribosyltransferase, and Ib, 
which is involved in cell binding and translocation of Ia across the cell 
membrane. Here we report cryo-EM structures of the translocation channel Ib-pore 
and its complex with Ia. The high-resolution Ib-pore structure demonstrates a 
similar structural framework to that of the catalytic ϕ-clamp of the anthrax 
protective antigen pore. However, the Ia-bound Ib-pore structure shows a unique 
binding mode of Ia: one Ia binds to the Ib-pore, and the Ia amino-terminal 
domain forms multiple weak interactions with two additional Ib-pore constriction 
sites. Furthermore, Ib-binding induces tilting and partial unfolding of the Ia 
N-terminal α-helix, permitting its extension to the ϕ-clamp gate. This new 
mechanism of N-terminal unfolding is crucial for protein translocation.

AIMS: Long-term exposure of humans to air pollution enhances the risk of 
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. A novel Global Exposure Mortality Model 
(GEMM) has been derived from many cohort studies, providing much-improved 
coverage of the exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We applied the GEMM 
to assess excess mortality attributable to ambient air pollution on a global 
scale and compare to other risk factors.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a data-informed atmospheric model to calculate 
worldwide exposure to PM2.5 and ozone pollution, which was combined with the 
GEMM to estimate disease-specific excess mortality and loss of life expectancy 
(LLE) in 2015. Using this model, we investigated the effects of different 
pollution sources, distinguishing between natural (wildfires, aeolian dust) and 
anthropogenic emissions, including fossil fuel use. Global excess mortality from 
all ambient air pollution is estimated at 8.8 (7.11-10.41) million/year, with an 
LLE of 2.9 (2.3-3.5) years, being a factor of two higher than earlier estimates, 
and exceeding that of tobacco smoking. The global mean mortality rate of about 
120 per 100 000 people/year is much exceeded in East Asia (196 per 100 000/year) 
and Europe (133 per 100 000/year). Without fossil fuel emissions, the global 
mean life expectancy would increase by 1.1 (0.9-1.2) years and 1.7 (1.4-2.0) 
years by removing all potentially controllable anthropogenic emissions. Because 
aeolian dust and wildfire emission control is impracticable, significant LLE is 
unavoidable.
CONCLUSION: Ambient air pollution is one of the main global health risks, 
causing significant excess mortality and LLE, especially through cardiovascular 
diseases. It causes an LLE that rivals that of tobacco smoking. The global mean 
LLE from air pollution strongly exceeds that by violence (all forms together), 
i.e. by an order of magnitude (LLE being 2.9 and 0.3 years, respectively).

The number of people with dementia and delirium not induced by alcohol and other 
psychoactive substances has significantly increased during the last decades and 
will rise further in the future, particularly in the oldest old. In the vast 
majority of cases dementia is characterized by a progressive course with 
shortened life expectancy and a lack of curative treatment options. Delirium 
will remit in many cases; however, in a substantial proportion of patients the 
further course is unfavorable. Life expectancy is greatly reduced in these 
patients, mostly in association with advanced dementia and age-related 
multimorbidity. Intensified inclusion of palliative medical care aspects in the 
planning of treatment is indicated in the context of advanced and incurable 
conditions associated with a presumably clearly reduced life expectancy. The aim 
is to achieve the best possible relief of distressing somatic and psychiatric 
symptoms for the sake of the patients and their families. The competencies of 
psychiatry and palliative care can complement each other in this respect. In 
addition, there is a need for healthcare policy measures beyond the associated 
interdisciplinary opportunities and challenges in order to establish the 
necessary healthcare structures.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is an 
autosomal recessive motor neuron disease that is characterized by distal and 
proximal muscle weakness and diaphragmatic palsy that leads to respiratory 
distress. Without intervention, infants with the severe form of the disease die 
before 2 years of age. SMARD1 is caused by mutations in the IGHMBP2 gene that 
determine a deficiency in the encoded IGHMBP2 protein, which plays a critical 
role in motor neuron survival because of its functions in mRNA processing and 
maturation. Although it is rare, SMARD1 is the second most common motor neuron 
disease of infancy, and currently, treatment is primarily supportive. No 
effective therapy is available for this devastating disease, although 
multidisciplinary care has been an essential element of the improved quality of 
life and life span extension in these patients in recent years. The objectives 
of this review are to discuss the current understanding of SMARD1 through a 
summary of the presently known information regarding its clinical presentation 
and pathogenesis and to discuss emerging therapeutic approaches. Advances in 
clinical care management have significantly extended the lives of individuals 
affected by SMARD1 and research into the molecular mechanisms that lead to the 
disease has identified potential strategies for intervention that target the 
underlying causes of SMARD1. Gene therapy via gene replacement or gene 
correction provides the potential for transformative therapies to halt or 
possibly prevent neurodegenerative disease in SMARD1 patients. The recent 
approval of the first gene therapy approach for SMA associated with mutations in 
the SMN1 gene may be a turning point for the application of this strategy for 
SMARD1 and other genetic neurological diseases.
