The beneficial effect of statins on the risk of recurrence of cardiovascular 
disease (secondary prevention) is well demonstrated. In primary prevention (no 
symptomatic cardiovascular disease), the benefit of statins after the age of 70 
years is less clear and elderly patients with comorbidities have often been 
excluded from large, randomized trials. Some ongoing clinical trials will 
provide more information on the potential benefits and risks of starting or 
stopping statins in older adults. In clinical practice, the decision to treat 
with statins needs to take into account age, comorbidities, life expectancy, 
functional and cognitive status and patient preferences (shared decision), but 
statin discontinuation is only recommended in the context of a clinical trial, 
as reviewed in this article.

cardiovasculaire (prévention secondaire) est bien démontré. En prévention 
primaire (pas de maladie cardiovasculaire symptomatique), le bénéfice des 
statines après 70 ans est moins clair et les patients âgés avec des comorbidités 
ont souvent été exclus des grandes études randomisées. Des essais cliniques sont 
en cours et apporteront plus d’informations sur les potentiels effets bénéfiques 
et risques de débuter ou d’arrêter les statines chez les personnes âgées. Dans 
la pratique, en sus de l’âge, la décision de traiter par statine nécessite de 
prendre en compte les comorbidités, l’espérance de vie, l’état fonctionnel et 
cognitif et les souhaits du patient (décision partagée), mais un arrêt n’est 
recommandé que dans le cadre d’un essai clinique, comme revu dans cet article.

Polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use are very common in multimorbid 
older patients. This population has unfortunately been excluded from most large, 
randomized studies. In a recent multicenter randomized study (OPERAM), we 
included over 2000 multimorbid patients. We found that 86% of the patients aged 
70 years and more had inappropriate medications and that these medications could 
be discontinued without negative impact on the health of these patients. This 
cohort of multimorbid patients will be followed for 10 years to evaluate their 
prognosis, life expectancy, treatments and quality of life, with numerous 
projects to better understand the inappropriate prescribing of individual drugs 
and their consequences on the health of this population.

BACKGROUND: Deprescribing of antihypertensive medications for older patients 
with normal blood pressure is recommended by some clinical guidelines, where the 
potential harms of treatment may outweigh the benefits. This study aimed to 
assess the cost-effectiveness of this approach.
METHODS: A Markov patient-level simulation was undertaken to model the effect of 
withdrawing one antihypertensive compared with usual care, over a life-time 
horizon. Model population characteristics were estimated using data from the 
OPTiMISE antihypertensive deprescribing trial, and the effects of blood pressure 
changes on outcomes were derived from the literature. Health-related quality of 
life was modeled in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and presented as costs 
per QALY gained.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, medication reduction resulted in lower costs 
than usual care (mean difference £185), but also lower QALYs (mean difference 
0.062) per patient over a life-time horizon. Usual care was cost-effective at 
£2975 per QALY gained (more costly, but more effective). Medication reduction 
resulted more heart failure and stroke/TIA events but fewer adverse events. 
Medication reduction may be the preferred strategy at a willingness-to-pay of 
£20 000/QALY, where the baseline absolute risk of serious drug-related adverse 
events was ≥7.7% a year (compared with 1.7% in the base-case).
CONCLUSIONS: Although there was uncertainty around many of the assumptions 
underpinning this model, these findings suggest that antihypertensive medication 
reduction should not be attempted in many older patients with controlled 
systolic blood pressure. For populations at high risk of adverse effects, 
deprescribing may be beneficial, but a targeted approach would be required in 
routine practice.

People with a learning disability can experience significant problems in 
accessing healthcare and this may be partly reflected in worse health outcomes 
compared with the general population, including a shorter life expectancy. The 
Equality Act (2010) requires that organisations and individuals make changes to 
the way services are provided for all disabled people to mitigate, as far as 
possible, any disadvantage they may face in accessing these services. These 
changes are termed 'reasonable adjustments'. This article describes the 
reasonable adjustments that can be made to facilitate the admission of an adult 
surgical patient with a learning disability, and therefore reduce health 
inequality. Each stage of a patient's journey through the hospital needs to be 
anticipated and planned for. Many of these changes are not only applicable to 
the wider care of people with a learning disability, but also to any person who 
lacks capacity and who is struggling to access healthcare. Key recommendations 
include the development of assessment tools, pathways and policies specific to 
the learning disabled patient; identification of key personnel including a 
learning disability lead, an acute liaison learning disability nurse, 
pre-assessment and operating theatre personnel and ward learning disability 
champions; regular multidisciplinary team meetings for planning and best 
interest assessments; and establishing an electronic alert on the patient 
administration system to identify learning disabled patients. The anaesthetist, 
operating theatre and learning disability teams play a pivotal role in ensuring 
individualised admission plans are made for patients with a learning disability 
to reduce these healthcare inequalities and improve peri-operative care.

Killing in the name of: A merciful death?

Moore B(1).

Author information:
(1)Institute for Bioethics and Health Humanities, The University of Texas 
Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, Texas, USA.

"Mercy" holds a well-established place in the discourse on assisted death (AD), 
with mercy rhetoric used by both proponents and opponents of AD alike. In this 
paper, I interrogate the relationship between mercy, mercy killing and AD. 
Appeals to mercy introduce an ambiguity that carries implications for the 
enduring debate about healthcare professionals' participation in this 
controversial practice. The term "mercy killing" is used at different times to 
mean all of the following: killings that are acts of punitive leniency, killings 
motivated by pity, killings motivated by compassion, and acts of voluntary, 
involuntary and nonvoluntary euthanasia. I argue that killings that are acts of 
punitive leniency "track" a conceptually useful understanding of mercy and, by 
extension, mercy killing. However, if mercy is understood in this way, then 
"mercy killing" is a problematic way of characterizing physician-AD. While 
reference to mercy killing has been weeded out of AD legislation over time, the 
same cannot be said of public discourse, where the debate about physicians' 
character-and the locus of power with respect to who gets to decide when a life 
can rightly be ended-continues.

IMPORTANCE: The global incidence of thyroid cancer has been increasing rapidly, 
and this increase has had an attendant burden on health systems. However, it is 
unclear how the burden of this disease differs among the pre-2004 countries of 
the European Union (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, 
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the UK), 
US, Australia, Canada, and Norway (EU15+).
OBJECTIVE: To assess the trends in mortality, incidence, and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) associated with thyroid cancer between 1990 and 2019 in EU15+ 
nations. Data analysis was conducted from July 11 to October 11, 2021.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational cross-sectional analysis of the 
incidence of thyroid cancer was conducted using data obtained from the Global 
Burden of Disease Study database. Nineteen countries of the EU15+ were included.
EXPOSURES: Thyroid cancer.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs), 
age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) and DALYs were extracted for individual 
EU15+ countries per sex for each of the years from 1990 to 2019, and 
mortality-to-incidence indexes were computed. Joinpoint regression analysis was 
used to describe the trends.
RESULTS: Thirteen of 19 countries (68%) showed an average annual percentage 
change increase in ASIR across the study period (range, 0.2%-2.5%). Joinpoint 
regression analysis revealed largely plateauing ASIR trends in recent years 
across most EU15+ nations since 1990. Between 2011 and 2019, the estimated 
annual percentage change in the US was 0. Australia, Denmark, and the US were 
the only countries with increasing ASMR trends with positive average annual 
percentage changes: Australia, 0.6 (95% CI, 0.2-1.0); Denmark, 1.0 (95% CI, 
0.8-1.3); and US, 0.4 (95% CI, 0.4-0.5); the remaining 16 countries showed 
negative trends (range, -0.2 to -2.1). Disability-adjusted life-years decreased 
in all EU15+ countries except Australia, Denmark, and the US.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional analysis found that overall, the 
burden of thyroid cancer across EU15+ countries appears to be decreasing, 
evidenced by plateauing incidence rates and reductions in mortality and DALYs 
over the 30-year study period. However, the US and Australia appear to have 
increasing ASMR and DALY trends. Ongoing observation is required to monitor how 
changes in international clinical practice guidelines affect thyroid cancer 
DALYs and mortality.

In both public and private sectors, one can notice a strong interest in the 
topic of sustainable food and packaging. For a long time, the spotlight for 
optimization was placed on well-known examples of high environmental impacts, 
whether regarding indirect resource use (e.g., meat, dairy) or problems in waste 
management. Staple and hedonistic foods such as cereals and confectionary have 
gained less attention. However, these products and their packaging solutions are 
likewise of worldwide ecologic and economic relevance, accounting for high 
resource input, production amounts, as well as food losses and waste. This 
review provides a profound elaboration of the status quo in cereal and 
confectionary packaging, essential for practitioners to improve sustainability 
in the sector. Here, we present packaging functions and properties along with 
related product characteristics and decay mechanisms in the subcategories of 
cereals and cereal products, confectionary and bakery wares alongside 
ready-to-eat savories and snacks. Moreover, we offer an overview to formerly and 
recently used packaging concepts as well as established and modern shelf-life 
extending technologies, expanding upon our knowledge to thoroughly understand 
the packaging's purpose; we conclude that a comparison of the environmental 
burden share between product and packaging is necessary to properly derive the 
need for action(s), such as packaging redesign.

Seafood is an excellent source of nutrients, essential for a healthy diet, 
ranging from proteins and fatty acids to vitamins and minerals. Seafood products 
are highly perishable foods due to their nutritional characteristics and 
composition. The application of nontoxic, natural, and edible preservatives to 
extend the shelf-life and inhibit bacterial proliferation of several foods has 
been a hot topic. Consequently, this work aimed to perform the microbiological 
characterization of squid and shrimp skewers during their shelf-life (five days) 
and evaluate the susceptibility of randomly isolated microorganisms to several 
natural edible compounds so that their application for the preservation and 
shelf-life extension of the product might be analyzed in the future. The product 
had considerably high total microorganisms loads of about 5 log CFU/g at day 
zero and 9 log CFU/g at day five. In addition, high bacterial counts of 
Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacterales, and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were found, 
especially on the last day of storage, being Pseudomonas the dominant genus. 
However, no Escherichia coli or Listeria monocytogenes were detected on the 
analyzed samples. One hundred bacterial isolates were randomly selected and 
identified through 16s rRNA sequencing, resulting in the detection of several 
Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas spp., and LAB. The antibacterial activity of 
carvacrol, olive leaf extract, limonene, Citrox®, different chitosans, and 
ethanolic propolis extracts was evaluated by the agar diffusion method, and the 
minimum inhibitory concentration was determined only for Citrox® since only this 
solution could inhibit all the identified isolates. At concentrations higher 
than or equal to 1.69% (v/v), Citrox® demonstrated bacteriostatic and 
bactericidal activity to 97% and 3% of the isolates, respectively. To our 
knowledge, there are no available data about the effectiveness of this 
commercial product on seafood isolates. Although preliminary, this study showed 
evidence that Citrox® has the potential to be used as a natural preservative in 
these seafood products, improving food safety and quality while reducing waste. 
However, further studies are required, such as developing a Citrox®-based 
coating and its application on this matrix to validate its antimicrobial effect.

BACKGROUND: In advanced cancer stage the incidence of cancerous wounds is about 
5%, and the estimated life expectancy is not more than 6 to 12 months. Without 
interdisciplinary and individualized treatment strategy, symptoms progress, and 
adversely influence quality of life.
METHODS: Authors collected different treatment algorithms for cancerous wound 
published by wide scale of medical expertise, and summarized surgical, 
oncological, radiation oncological, nursing and palliative care aspects based on 
radiological information.
RESULTS: Interdisciplinary approach with continuous consultation between various 
specialists can solve or ease the hopeless cases.
CONCLUSIONS: This distressing condition needs a comprehensive treatment solution 
to alleviate severe symptoms. Non-healing fungating wounds without effective 
therapy are severe socio-economic burden for all participants, including 
patients, caregivers, and health services. In this paper authors collected 
recommendations for further guideline that is essential in the near future.

Hairy Cell Leukemia Patients Have a Normal Life Expectancy-A 35-Year 
Single-Center Experience and Comparison with the General Population.

Classic hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an uncommon hematologic malignancy 
characterized by an excellent prognosis since purine analogues (PA), such as 
cladribine (2-CdA), have been introduced in the 1990s. However, most data on 
long-term outcomes is gathered from patients treated with PA first-line or 
include limited information on previous treatment outcomes, i.e., Interferon-α 
(IFN-α). Survival curves from previous series did not reach a plateau, 
indicating that nearly all patients ultimately relapse. Yet, overall survival 
(OS) data were rarely corrected for life expectancy of the general population. 
We here report 83 consecutive HCL patients treated between 1983 and 2017 at the 
University Center in Innsbruck, Austria. Median follow-up was 170 months 
(1-498). IFN-α, the first-line treatment of choice before 1990, was administered 
to 24 patients, achieving an overall response rate (ORR) of 86% and an 
unconfirmed complete remission (CRu) in 23%. All these patients relapsed after a 
median progression-free survival (PFS) of 30 months (3-80), but either remained 
drug-sensitive upon re-exposure to IFN-α or were successfully salvaged with PA. 
All 42 patients exposed to first-line 2-CdA responded (ORR of 100%). Sixteen 
patients received two to four successive courses of PA with a continuous 
decrease in the response quality (CRu rate 85.7% 1st-line vs. 41.5% 3rd-line 
treatment). Median PFS was not reached in both treatment-naïve patients and 
those retreated at first relapse. Although pretreatment with IFN-α was 
associated with a shortened median PFS of 81 months (43-118) after PA therapy, 
this tendency of inferior PFS did not result in inferior OS. OS of all 83 
patients was excellent and equivalent to that of age-, sex-, and diagnostic 
period-matched controls from the Tyrolean general population (standardized 
mortality ratio 0.8), regardless of their age at diagnosis or whether they were 
diagnosed until or after the year 2000. These results confirm that HCL patients 
may look forward to a normal lifespan when treated with PA irrespective of their 
pretreatment history.

Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) suffered the most from nutritional 
deficiencies (NDs). Although decades of efforts have reduced it, little is known 
about the changing trajectory of ND burden in LMICs. By extracting data of the 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019, we calculated 
indicators of incidence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to measure 
the burden of NDs and its main subcategories in LMICs, including protein-energy 
malnutrition, iodine deficiency, vitamin A deficiency, dietary iron deficiency, 
and other nutritional deficiencies by sex, age and spatial patterns. In LMICs, 
ND incidence still increased in the age group 15+ born before 2005, especially 
in males. The effort of reducing the DALYs of NDs has generated a strong decline 
in per age group. In the main subcategories of NDs, protein-energy malnutrition 
incidence in males age 45+ born before 1970 still increased. Despite vitamin A 
deficiency incidence and dietary iron deficiency, DALYs strongly experienced 
decreases over three decades while still remaining at the heaviest level in 
2019, especially in females and children under 5 years. The top largest tendency 
estimates occurred in Mali' females and Bhutan' males. Zimbabwe was the only 
country with increased DALYs rate tendency in both sexes.

Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is one of the important public health issues 
worldwide. However, a detailed understanding of the incidence and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to VAD in recent years is lacking. We 
aimed to estimate the incidence and DALYs of VAD at global, regional, and 
national levels in terms of sex, age, and socio-demographic index (SDI). Using 
data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, the estimated annual 
percentage change (EAPC) was measured to assess trends in the age-standardized 
incidence and DALY rates from 1990 to 2019. The global age-standardized 
incidence and DALY rates of VAD decreased with an EAPC of −3.11% (95% confidence 
interval (CI): −3.24% to −2.94%) and −2.18% (95% CI: −2.38% to −1.93%), 
respectively. The age-standardized incidence and DALY rates decreased least in 
low-SDI regions, which had the highest age-standardized incidence and DALY rates 
of all SDI regions. Sub-Saharan Africa, especially central sub-Saharan Africa, 
had the highest age-standardized incidence and DALY rates in 2019. At the 
national level, Somalia and Niger had the highest age-standardized incidence and 
DALY rates. The age-standardized incidence and DALY rates were higher in males 
than in females. Younger children, especially those aged < 5 years in low-SDI 
regions, had a higher VAD burden than other age groups. Although the global 
burden of VAD has decreased, future work should aim to improve the prevention 
and treatment strategies for VAD, particularly in children aged < 5 years in 
countries and territories with low SDI values, such as sub-Saharan Africa.

Aflatoxins (AFTs), as a group 1 carcinogen, could lead to hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). Dietary intake is the primary way of AFT exposure in humans. 
However, the contribution of foodborne AFT intake to the HCC burden remains 
unknown in recent years in China. Hence, the present study was conducted to 
estimate the burden of HCC attributed to foodborne AFT exposure by using 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The risk assessment was used to estimate 
the incidence of HCC related to AFT exposure. Concentrations of AFTs in peanuts, 
peanut oil, corn, and corn products were retrieved from literature published 
between 2010 and 2020 in China. Corresponding daily food consumption data were 
obtained from two nationwide Chinese surveys. A direct approach was used to 
calculate DALY and DALY rates to quantify the HCC burden attributed to dietary 
AFT exposure. The total amount of AFT intake through peanut, peanut oil, corn, 
and corn products was 4.018 ng/kg bw/day resulting in 0.125 extra HCC cases per 
year/100,000 persons, corresponding to a DALY number and DALY rate of 21,625.08 
and 1.53 per 100,000 population, respectively. Regionally, DALYs were high in 
Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, corresponding to 5948 and 5595 DALYs. A total 
of 1.5 DALYs/100,000 were lost due to the AFT exposure. DALYs per 100,000 
population were higher in several coastal areas. Though the disease burden of 
HCC caused by dietary AFTs was low in the Chinese population, a high health risk 
was found in the residents of some areas with high AFT exposure. AFTs are still 
a health challenge for the Chinese people.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents the most malignant type of astrocytoma, 
with a life expectancy of two years. It has been shown that Poly (ADP-ribose) 
polymerase 1 (PARP-1) protein is over-expressed in GBM cells, while its 
expression in healthy tissue is low. In addition, perezone, a phyto-compound, is 
a PARP-1 inhibitor with anti-neoplastic activity. As a consequence, in the 
present study, both in vitro and computational evaluations of perezone and its 
chemically related compound, perezone angelate, as anti-GBM agents were 
performed. Hence, the anti-proliferative assay showed that perezone angelate 
induces higher cytotoxicity in the GBM cell line (U373 IC50 = 6.44 μM) than 
perezone (U373 IC50 = 51.20 μM) by induction of apoptosis. In addition, perezone 
angelate showed low cytotoxic activity in rat glial cells (IC50 = 173.66 μM). 
PARP-1 inhibitory activity (IC50 = 5.25 μM) and oxidative stress induction by 
perezone angelate were corroborated employing in vitro studies. In the other 
hand, the performed docking studies allowed explaining the PARP-1 inhibitory 
activity of perezone angelate, and ADMET studies showed its probability to 
permeate cell membranes and the blood-brain barrier, which is an essential 
characteristic of drugs to treat neurological diseases. Finally, it is essential 
to highlight that the results confirm perezone angelate as a potential anti-GBM 
agent.

Modeling Based on the Experimental Results.

The wear phenomenon of a dental milling cutter is studied based on experimental 
results and data and validated by statistical-mathematical modeling. The results 
of the statistical-mathematical modeling by the interpolation of the 
experimental results (data) regarding the wear of the dental milling cutter 
analyzed and obtained in the work process are presented in this paper. These 
results (data) are important because they lead to polynomial functions which by 
interpolation approximate very well the dependent parameter, specifically the 
wear process (mass lost due to dental milling cutter wear, mw), considered in 
the experimental program. The polynomial interpolation functions are valid, only 
during the experimental testing range of the dental milling cutter, to describe 
the wear phenomenon; the extrapolations do not lead to satisfactory results. 
However, by using a controlled interpolation function with an exponential 
component, the extrapolation of the results is possible. Therefore, the purpose 
of this paper is the statistical-mathematical modeling by the interpolation of 
the experimental results of the mass lost due to dental milling cutter wear, mw, 
using the deterministic differential model for the work process of it. Thus, 
interesting conclusions can be drawn relating to the phenomenon. In support of 
these statements come the results of the statistical-mathematical modeling by 
the interpolation of the experimental data obtained in the work process of the 
dental milling cutters, leading to practical applications, such as the extension 
of the life of dental milling cutter, useful even for its operation 
optimization; determination of possible criteria for replacing the worn dental 
milling cutters; the extension of the life of the materials from which dental 
milling cutters are built; or the provision of ideas for constructive solutions. 
Based on the modeling results by interpolation, it was found that the dental 
milling cutter during the milling operation works with high efficiency (mass 
loss due to wear is very reduced) in the first 11 h of operation, i.e., about a 
10% increase in lifetime. After 11 h of operation, mass loss due to wear of the 
dental milling cutter increases relatively exponentially; thus, it is 
recommended that, in the normal way, the dental milling cutter be replaced with 
a new one to ensure high standards of materials processing.

Aging is the greatest challenge to humankind worldwide. Aging is associated with 
a progressive loss of physiological integrity due to a decline in cellular 
metabolism and functions. Such metabolic changes lead to age-related diseases, 
thereby compromising human health for the remaining life. Thus, there is an 
urgent need to identify geroprotectors that regulate metabolic functions to 
target the aging biological processes. Nutrients are the major regulator of 
metabolic activities to coordinate cell growth and development. Iron is an 
important nutrient involved in several biological functions, including 
metabolism. In this study using yeast as an aging model organism, we show that 
iron supplementation delays aging and increases the cellular lifespan. To 
determine how iron supplementation increases lifespan, we performed a gene 
expression analysis of mitochondria, the main cellular hub of iron utilization. 
Quantitative analysis of gene expression data reveals that iron supplementation 
upregulates the expression of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle 
and electron transport chain (ETC) genes. Furthermore, in agreement with the 
expression profiles of mitochondrial genes, ATP level is elevated by iron 
supplementation, which is required for increasing the cellular lifespan. To 
confirm, we tested the role of iron supplementation in the AMPK knockout mutant. 
AMPK is a highly conserved controller of mitochondrial metabolism and energy 
homeostasis. Remarkably, iron supplementation rescued the short lifespan of the 
AMPK knockout mutant and confirmed its anti-aging role through the enhancement 
of mitochondrial functions. Thus, our results suggest a potential therapeutic 
use of iron supplementation to delay aging and prolong healthspan.

Inherited cardiomyopathy caused by the p.(Arg14del) pathogenic variant of the 
phospholamban (PLN) gene is characterized by intracardiomyocyte PLN aggregation 
and can lead to severe dilated cardiomyopathy. We recently reported that 
pre-emptive depletion of PLN attenuated heart failure (HF) in several 
cardiomyopathy models. Here, we investigated if administration of a 
Pln-targeting antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) could halt or reverse disease 
progression in mice with advanced PLN-R14del cardiomyopathy. To this aim, 
homozygous PLN-R14del (PLN-R14 Δ/Δ) mice received PLN-ASO injections starting at 
5 or 6 weeks of age, in the presence of moderate or severe HF, respectively. 
Mice were monitored for another 4 months with echocardiographic analyses at 
several timepoints, after which cardiac tissues were examined for pathological 
remodeling. We found that vehicle-treated PLN-R14 Δ/Δ mice continued to develop 
severe HF, and reached a humane endpoint at 8.1 ± 0.5 weeks of age. Both early 
and late PLN-ASO administration halted further cardiac remodeling and 
dysfunction shortly after treatment start, resulting in a life span extension to 
at least 22 weeks of age. Earlier treatment initiation halted disease 
development sooner, resulting in better heart function and less remodeling at 
the study endpoint. PLN-ASO treatment almost completely eliminated PLN 
aggregates, and normalized levels of autophagic proteins. In conclusion, these 
findings indicate that PLN-ASO therapy may have beneficial outcomes in 
PLN-R14del cardiomyopathy when administered after disease onset. Although 
existing tissue damage was not reversed, further cardiomyopathy progression was 
stopped, and PLN aggregates were resolved.

For the past several decades, humanity has been dealing with HIV. This disease 
is one of the biggest global health problems. Fortunately, modern antiretroviral 
therapy allows patients to manage the disease, improving their quality of life 
and their life expectancy. In addition, the use of these drugs makes it possible 
to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to almost zero. Atherosclerosis 
is another serious pathology that leads to severe health problems, including 
disability and, often, the death of the patient. An effective treatment for 
atherosclerosis has not yet been developed. Both types of immune response, 
innate and adaptive, are important components of the pathogenesis of this 
disease. In this regard, the peculiarities of the development of atherosclerosis 
in HIV carriers are of particular scientific interest. In this review, we have 
tried to summarize the data on atherosclerosis and its development in HIV 
carriers. We also looked at the classic therapeutic methods and their features 
concerning the concomitant diagnosis.

We sought to estimate the lifetime healthcare costs and outcomes associated with 
the exposure to the escalated concentration of fine particulate matter (particle 
size < 2.5 μm, PM2.5) among adult Korean women. We adapted a previously 
developed Markov model, and a hypothetical cohort composed of Korean women was 
exposed to either a standard (15 μg/m3) or increased (25 μg/m3) concentration of 
PM2.5. The time horizon of the analysis was 60 years, and the cycle length was 1 
year. The outcomes were presented as direct healthcare costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs were discounted annually at 5%. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The model 
estimated that when the exposure concentration was increased by 10 μg/m3, the 
lifetime healthcare cost increased by USD 9309, which is an 11.3% increase 
compared to the standard concentration group. Women exposed to a higher 
concentration of PM2.5 were predicted to live 30.64 QALYs, compared to 32.08 
QALYs for women who were exposed to the standard concentration of PM2.5. The 
tendency of a higher cost and shorter QALYs at increased exposure was consistent 
across a broad range of sensitivity analyses. The negative impact of PM2.5 was 
higher on cost than on QALYs and accelerated as the exposure time increased, 
emphasizing the importance of early intervention.

This article describes the Salvador Primary Care Longitudinal Study of Child 
Development (CohortDICa). The exposed group was defined by confirmation of 
Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) diagnosed through computed tomography, magnetic 
resonance or transfontanellar ultrasound. A random selection of the 169 exposed 
children led to a subgroup of 120 children who were paired with children from 
the Live Birth Information System, according to birthdate, residence in the same 
street or neighborhood, and gestational age, resulting in 115 subjects in the 
non-exposed group. Following recruitment and before the participants completed 
42 months, three measures were applied to assess cognitive, motor, and language 
performance, corresponding to three home visits. Social characteristics of the 
families and children, and the neurocognitive development of the children will 
be compared across the CZS exposed group (n = 147), the typical children with no 
exposure to CZS (n = 115) and the STORCH exposed group (Syphilis, Toxoplasma 
gondii, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex) (n = 20). Primary Health 
Care (PHC) should include long-term care strategies for the care of children and 
family members, and might benefit from the research, teaching, and extension 
activities provided in this study. In the face of the consequences of the Zika 
virus epidemic, an opportunity arose to intervene in the integrated care of 
child development within PHC, including, on an equal basis, typical children and 
those with delays or disabilities in the first six years of life.
