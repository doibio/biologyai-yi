acting out, fighting, bullying, or arguing) were most valuable, as indicated by 
adult respondents' preference of other health problems to avoid outcomes along 
these domains.
DISCUSSION: These findings may inform comparative effectiveness research, health 
technology assessments, clinical practice guidelines, and public resource 
allocation decisions by enhancing understanding of the value adults place on the 
health and functional status of children.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved measurement of public priorities can promote national 
child health by drawing attention to what adults value most and complementing 
conventional measures of public health surveillance.

Recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor in the management of hereditary 
angioedema.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder, is 
caused by a deficiency in functional C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). This 
potentially life-threatening condition manifests as recurrent attacks of 
subcutaneous and submucosal swelling of the skin, gastrointestinal tract and 
larynx. The management of HAE includes treatment of acute episodes, short-term 
prophylaxis in preparation for exposure to known triggers and long-term 
prophylaxis to decrease the incidence and severity of HAE attacks. Four products 
are approved in the USA for the treatment of acute attacks of HAE, including one 
human plasma-derived C1-INH therapy, a recombinant human C1-INH product 
(rhC1-INH), a plasma kallikrein inhibitor and a bradykinin B2 receptor 
antagonist. In addition, one human plasma-derived C1-INH therapy and danazol are 
approved for prophylaxis of HAE attacks. rhC1-INH, extracted from the milk of 
transgenic rabbits, is a glycoprotein of 478 amino acids with an identical amino 
acid sequence to the endogenous human C1-INH protein. Population pharmacokinetic 
analysis of rhC1-INH supports an intravenous dosing strategy of 50 U/kg (maximum 
4200 U). The safety and efficacy of rhC1-INH in the treatment of acute attacks 
in patients with HAE were demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled studies and two open-label extension studies. In a pilot 
prophylaxis study, weekly administration of rhC1-INH 50 U/kg for 8 weeks reduced 
the incidence of HAE attacks and was well tolerated. Administration of rhC1-INH 
has not been associated with the development of anti-drug antibodies or 
antibodies to anti-host-related impurities.

An antimicrobial packaging material was developed by uniformly embedding 1, 3 
and 5% chitosan (w/w) in low density polyethylene matrix using maleic anhydride 
grafted LDPE as a compatible agent. The materials were mixed by compounding and 
blown into monolayer films via blown film extrusion. The developed films showed 
good barrier properties against oxygen. Characterization of the composite films 
with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that chitosan and LDPE 
interacted well with each other. Overall migration showed better release of 
chitosan adduct from the LDPE matrix which enhanced the antibacterial properties 
of the films. The interaction between the LDPE/CS and maleic anhydride grafted 
LDPE had a decreasing effect on the tensile strength and heat sealing 
properties. Investigation on antimicrobial properties of LDPE/CS films showed 
85-100% inhibition of Escherichia coli. Efficacy of LDPE/CS films was evaluated 
by using them as packaging material for chilled storage of Tilapia (Oreochromis 
mossambicus). Analysis of storage quality indices (peroxide value, free fatty 
acid, total volatile base nitrogen and aerobic plate count) revealed good 
antibacterial property and extension of shelf life of Tilapia in the chitosan 
incorporated novel composite films compared to virgin LDPE film.

Expansins are cell wall proteins that are generally considered to be the key 
regulator of cell wall extension during plant growth. In this study, we used two 
different wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars to demonstrate that expansins 
are involved in wheat leaf growth and response to water stress, by regulating 
the expansin activity and cell wall susceptibility to expansins. Expansin 
activity was associated with the relative elongation rate of leaves during leaf 
development, suggesting their involvement in leaf elongation. Moreover, cell 
wall extension characteristics and expansin gene transcription were closely 
involved in the leaf cell elongation region. Water stress restrains leaf growth, 
but the growth rate of leaves was changed after rehydration, which is consistent 
with the response of expansin activity to water stress. Meanwhile, increased 
cell wall susceptibility to expansin by water deficit played an important role 
in maintaining cell wall extension. Furthermore, the expansin activity in 
drought-resistant cultivar HF9703 was always higher than that in 
drought-sensitive cultivar 921842 under water stress condition, which may be 
correlated with the higher expansin gene expression in HF9703 versus 921842. 
These data provide evidence for a role of expansins in the growth and response 
of wheat leaves to water stress.

Many models in the physical and life sciences, formulated as dynamical systems, 
exhibit a positive steady state, with its local qualitative behavior determined 
by the eigenvalues of its Jacobian matrix. Our interest lies in detecting if 
this steady state is linearly stable or if the system has periodic solutions 
arising from a Hopf bifurcation. We address this by considering the sign pattern 
of the Jacobian matrix and its set of allowed refined inertias. The refined 
inertia of a matrix, which is an extension of the classical matrix inertia, is a 
property of its eigenvalues. A Hopf bifurcation, leading to periodic solutions, 
may be possible if the sign pattern of the Jacobian matrix allows a specific set 
of refined inertias. For most systems, we also need to consider magnitude 
restrictions on the entries of the Jacobian matrix that are a consequence of the 
particular biological model. The usefulness of sign pattern analysis to detect 
linear stability or the possibility of periodicity is illustrated with several 
biological examples, including metabolic-genetic circuits, biochemical reaction 
networks, predator-prey and competition systems.

OBJECTIVE: Middle aortic syndrome (MAS) is a rare condition characterized by 
severe stenosis of the distal thoracic or abdominal aorta. The aims of this 
study are to define the anatomic characteristics of MAS and to review the 
various surgical methods and their outcomes in terms of long-term durability
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten adult patients were diagnosed with MAS caused by 
Takayasu arteritis (TA) or midaortic dysplastic syndrome and underwent surgical 
treatment between July 1992 and January 2013.
RESULT: The aortic lesions were mostly suprarenal (n = 7) and stenoses were 
commonly found in the celiac axis (n = 6), SMA (n = 7), and renal artery 
(n = 6). Indications for operation were uncontrolled hypertension in six 
patients and lower extremity claudication in four. Eight aortic bypasses, one 
supraceliac aortic interposition graft, and one bilateral aorto-renal bypass 
were performed. Adjunctive renal bypass with saphenous vein graft (n = 4) and 
IMA reimplantation (n = 2) were performed simultaneously. There was no 
post-operative mortality, and one complication of iliac dissection at the distal 
anastomosis site was detected and treated by stenting. Hypertension was cured or 
improved in five of the six patients, and lower extremity claudication improved 
in all of them. With a median follow up of 60 months (range, 12-263), all the 
aortic bypasses were patent and one adjunctive renal artery bypass graft with 
aortic bypass was occluded 29 months post-operatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic bypass for MAS is safe and shows excellent long-term 
durability. Considering the patients are relatively young with a long life 
expectancy, aggressive surgical treatment could be beneficial. Lifelong follow 
up to monitor complications and disease progression is necessary.

Repeated exposure to stressful circumstances is generally thought to be 
associated with increased pathology and reduced longevity. However, growing 
lines of evidence suggest that the effects of environmental stressors on 
survival and longevity depend on a multitude of factors and, under some 
circumstances, might be positive rather than negative. Here, using the zebra 
finch (Taeniopygia guttata), we show that repeated exposure to stressful 
conditions (i.e. unpredictable food availability), which induced no changes in 
body mass, was associated with a decrease in mortality rate and an increase in 
the age of death. As expected, the treated birds responded to the unpredictable 
food supply by increasing baseline glucocorticoid stress hormone secretion and 
there were no signs of habituation of this hormonal response to the treatment 
across time. Importantly, and consistent with previous literature, the magnitude 
of hormone increase induced by the treatment was significant, but relatively 
mild, since the baseline glucocorticoid concentrations in the treated birds were 
substantially lower than the peak levels that occur during an acute stress 
response in this species. Taken together, these data demonstrate that protracted 
exposure to relatively mild stressful circumstances can have beneficial lifespan 
effects.

Due to a prolonged life expectancy worldwide, the incidence of age-related 
neurodegenerative disorders such as glaucoma is increasing. Glaucoma is the 
second cause of blindness, resulting from a slow and progressive loss of retinal 
ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons. Up to now, intraocular pressure (IOP) 
reduction is the only treatment modality by which ophthalmologists attempt to 
control disease progression. However, not all patients benefit from this 
therapy, and the pathophysiology of glaucoma is not always associated with an 
elevated IOP. These limitations, together with the multifactorial etiology of 
glaucoma, urge the pressing medical need for novel and alternative treatment 
strategies. Such new therapies should focus on preventing or retarding RGC 
death, but also on repair of injured axons, to ultimately preserve or improve 
structural and functional connectivity. In this respect, Rho-associated 
coiled-coil forming protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitors hold a promising potential 
to become very prominent drugs for future glaucoma treatment. Their field of 
action in the eye does not seem to be restricted to IOP reduction by targeting 
the trabecular meshwork or improving filtration surgery outcome. Indeed, over 
the past years, important progress has been made in elucidating their ability to 
improve ocular blood flow, to prevent RGC death/increase RGC survival and to 
retard axonal degeneration or induce proper axonal regeneration. Within this 
review, we aim to highlight the currently known capacity of ROCK inhibition to 
promote neuroprotection and regeneration in several in vitro, ex vivo and in 
vivo experimental glaucoma models.

Using Laplace Regression to Model and Predict Percentiles of Age at Death When 
Age Is the Primary Time Scale.

Bellavia A, Discacciati A, Bottai M, Wolk A, Orsini N.

Increasingly often in epidemiologic research, associations between survival time 
and predictors of interest are measured by differences between distribution 
functions rather than hazard functions. For example, differences in percentiles 
of survival time, expressed in absolute time units (e.g., weeks), may complement 
the popular risk ratios, which are unitless measures. When analyzing time to an 
event of interest (e.g., death) in prospective cohort studies, the time scale 
can be set to start at birth or at study entry. The advantages of one time 
origin over the other have been thoroughly explored for the estimation of risks 
but not for the estimation of survival percentiles. In this paper, we analyze 
the use of different time scales in the estimation of survival percentiles with 
Laplace regression. Using this regression method, investigators can estimate 
percentiles of survival time over levels of an exposure of interest while 
adjusting for potential confounders. Our findings may help to improve modeling 
strategies and ease interpretation in the estimation of survival percentiles in 
prospective cohort studies.

BACKGROUND: Many targeted therapies have been approved for pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH), most of which are in oral forms. However, the effects of 
these drugs on lifesaving are unclear. Our objective was to evaluate the effects 
of oral treatments on clinical outcomes especially all-cause mortality in 
patients with PAH.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
were searched for relevant articles up to April 2014. Randomized, double-blind, 
parallel-group clinical trials that compared oral agents with placebo were 
selected. Data for populations, interventions, and outcomes were extracted 
independently by 2 investigators, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. 
Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.
RESULTS: Twenty-one randomized, controlled, clinical trials involving 5105 
patients were identified in the primary analysis. The overall estimated odds 
ratio (OR) of combined clinical worsening (CCW) events between active treatment 
groups and control groups was 0.55 (95% CI 0.47-0.64, P < .001). However, the 
effect of oral treatments on reducing all-cause mortality was not statistically 
significant (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61-1.10, P = .192), which was consistent for 
approved drugs (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61-1.18, P = .316) and drugs that were not 
approved (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.36-1.44, P = .352). In the sensitivity analysis, a 
significant reduction was achieved in CCW events (P < .001) but not in all-cause 
mortality (P = .057).
CONCLUSIONS: This pooled analysis shows the benefits of oral treatments on CCW 
events in patients with PAH. However, these drugs seem to exhibit less favorable 
effects on life expectancy in the short-term follow-up, suggesting further 
evaluation is required.

INTRODUCTION: The childhood obesity epidemic continues in the U.S., and fiscal 
crises are leading policymakers to ask not only whether an intervention works 
but also whether it offers value for money. However, cost-effectiveness analyses 
have been limited. This paper discusses methods and outcomes of four childhood 
obesity interventions: (1) sugar-sweetened beverage excise tax (SSB); (2) 
eliminating tax subsidy of TV advertising to children (TV AD); (3) early care 
and education policy change (ECE); and (4) active physical education (Active 
PE).
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness models of nationwide implementation of interventions 
were estimated for a simulated cohort representative of the 2015 U.S. population 
over 10 years (2015-2025). A societal perspective was used; future outcomes were 
discounted at 3%. Data were analyzed in 2014. Effectiveness, implementation, and 
equity issues were reviewed.
RESULTS: Population reach varied widely, and cost per BMI change ranged from 
$1.16 (TV AD) to $401 (Active PE). At 10 years, assuming maintenance of the 
intervention effect, three interventions would save net costs, with SSB and TV 
AD saving $55 and $38 for every dollar spent. The SSB intervention would avert 
disability-adjusted life years, and both SSB and TV AD would increase 
quality-adjusted life years. Both SSB ($12.5 billion) and TV AD ($80 million) 
would produce yearly tax revenue.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of these preventive interventions is greater 
than that seen for published clinical interventions to treat obesity. 
Cost-effectiveness evaluations of childhood obesity interventions can provide 
decision makers with information demonstrating best value for the money.

INTRODUCTION: Reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption through taxation is 
a promising public health response to the obesity epidemic in the U.S. This 
study quantifies the expected health and economic benefits of a national 
sugar-sweetened beverage excise tax of $0.01/ounce over 10 years.
METHODS: A cohort model was used to simulate the impact of the tax on BMI. 
Assuming ongoing implementation and effect maintenance, quality-adjusted 
life-years gained and disability-adjusted life-years and healthcare costs 
averted were estimated over the 2015-2025 period for the 2015 U.S.
POPULATION: Costs and health gains were discounted at 3% annually. Data were 
analyzed in 2014.
RESULTS: Implementing the tax nationally would cost $51 million in the first 
year. The tax would reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by 20% and mean 
BMI by 0.16 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]=0.06, 0.37) units among youth and 
0.08 (95% UI=0.03, 0.20) units among adults in the second year for a cost of 
$3.16 (95% UI=$1.24, $8.14) per BMI unit reduced. From 2015 to 2025, the policy 
would avert 101,000 disability-adjusted life-years (95% UI=34,800, 249,000); 
gain 871,000 quality-adjusted life-years (95% UI=342,000, 2,030,000); and result 
in $23.6 billion (95% UI=$9.33 billion, $54.9 billion) in healthcare cost 
savings. The tax would generate $12.5 billion in annual revenue (95% UI=$8.92, 
billion, $14.1 billion).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed tax could substantially reduce BMI and healthcare 
expenditures and increase healthy life expectancy. Concerns regarding the 
potentially regressive tax may be addressed by reduced obesity disparities and 
progressive earmarking of tax revenue for health promotion.

Velvet antlers are used medicinally in Asia and possess various therapeutic 
effects. Prices are set according to the country of origin, which is 
unidentifiable to the naked eye, and therefore counterfeiting is prevalent. 
Additionally, antlers of the Canadian elk, which can generate chronic wasting 
disease, are prevalently smuggled and distributed in the market. Thus, a method 
for identifying the country of origin of velvet antlers was developed, using 
polymorphisms in mitochondrial DNA, fluorescence melting curve analysis and 
analysis of locked nucleic acids (LNA). This combined method is capable of 
identifying five genotypes of velvet antlers in a single experiment using two 
probes. It also has advantages in multiplexing, simplicity and efficiency in 
genotyping, when compared to real-time PCR or microarrays. The developed method 
can be used to improve identification rates in the velvet antler market and, by 
extension, research based on polymorphisms in DNA sequences.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcomes and costs of hospital admission during the 
latent versus active phase of labor. Latent labor hospital admission has been 
consistently associated with elevated maternal risk for increased interventions, 
including epidural anesthesia and cesarean delivery, longer hospital stay, and 
higher utilization of hospital resources.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was built to simulate a theoretic cohort of 
3.2 million term, medically low-risk women either being admitted in latent labor 
(< 4 cm dilation) or delaying admission until active labor (≥ 4 cm dilation). 
Outcomes included epidural use, mode of delivery, stillbirth, maternal death, 
and costs of care. All probability, cost, and utility estimates were derived 
from the literature, and total quality-adjusted life years were calculated. 
Sensitivity analyses and a Monte Carlo simulation were used to investigate the 
robustness of model assumptions.
RESULTS: Delaying admission until active labor would result in 672,000 fewer 
epidurals, 67,232 fewer cesarean deliveries, and 9.6 fewer maternal deaths in 
our theoretic cohort as compared to admission during latent labor. Additionally, 
delaying admission results in a cost savings of $694 million annually in the 
United States. Sensitivity analyses indicated the model was robust within a wide 
range of probabilities and costs. Monte Carlo simulation found that delayed 
admission was the optimal strategy in 76.79 percent of trials.
CONCLUSION: Delaying admission until active labor is a dominant strategy, 
resulting in both better outcomes and lower costs. Issues related to clinical 
translation of these findings are explored.

The increasing pressure on healthcare resources affects blood donation and 
transfusion. We attempted a survey of the efficiency of different strategies, 
actual or proposed to improve the management of blood products. We found an 
important disconnect between the cost effectiveness ratio of strategies and 
their uptake by policy makers. In other words, the least efficient strategies 
are those which increase transfusion safety by increasing the number of 
biological markers and are those preferred by health authorities in developed 
countries. Other more efficient strategies are more slowly implemented and 
included a systematic use of transfusion guidelines, reducing blood losses or 
increasing pre operative blood levels in elective surgeries.

OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and safety of abatacept in patients with juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who experienced an inadequate response to 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were previously established in a phase III 
study that included a 4-month open-label lead-in period, a 6-month double-blind 
withdrawal period, and a long-term extension (LTE) phase. The aim of this study 
was to present the safety, efficacy, and patient-reported outcomes of abatacept 
treatment (10 mg/kg every 4 weeks) during the LTE phase, for up to 7 years of 
followup.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in the phase III trial could enter the open-label LTE 
phase if they had not achieved a response to treatment at month 4 or if they had 
received abatacept or placebo during the double-blind period.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three (80.5%) of 190 patients entered the LTE phase, 
and 69 patients (36.3%) completed it. The overall incidence rate (events per 100 
patient-years) of adverse events decreased during the LTE phase (433.61 events 
during the short-term phase [combined lead-in and double-blind periods] versus 
132.39 events during the LTE phase). Similar results were observed for serious 
adverse events (6.82 versus 5.60), serious infections (1.13 versus 1.72), 
malignancies (1.12 versus 0), and autoimmune events (2.26 versus 1.18). American 
College of Rheumatology (ACR) Pediatric 30 (Pedi 30) responses, Pedi 70 
responses, and clinically inactive disease status were maintained throughout the 
LTE phase in patients who continued to receive therapy. Improvements in the 
Child Health Questionnaire physical and psychosocial summary scores were 
maintained over time.
CONCLUSION: Long-term abatacept treatment for up to 7 years was associated with 
consistent safety, sustained efficacy, and quality-of-life benefits in patients 
with JIA.

Cystic fibrosis is the most common autosomal recessive genetic disease in 
Caucasians and has been extensively studied for many decades. The cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene was identified in 1989. It 
encodes a complex protein which has numerous cellular functions. Our 
understanding of cystic fibrosis pathophysiology and genetics is constantly 
expanding and being refined, leading to improved management of the disease and 
increased life expectancy in affected individuals.

The purpose of this paper is to make radioactive risk more generally 
understandable. To that end, we compare it to smoking tobacco. Further, we show 
that the concept of loss of life expectancy permits a quantitative comparison 
between various aggressions. The demystification of radioactive risk should lead 
to basic changes in post-catastrophe management, allowing victims to choose 
whether or not to leave contaminated areas. A less emotional appreciation of 
radioactive risks should lead to the adaptation of legal practices when dealing 
with probabilistic situations.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a decision-making rule based on 
the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging assessment of intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) 
in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two competing stroke prevention strategies were compared: 
(a) an intensive medical therapy-based management strategy versus (b) an 
imaging-based strategy in which the subset of patients with asymptomatic carotid 
artery stenosis with IPH on MR images would undergo immediate carotid 
endarterectomy in addition to ongoing intensive medical therapy. Patients in the 
medical therapy-only group could undergo carotid endarterectomy only with 
substantial carotid artery stenosis disease progression. Lifetime 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were modeled for patients with 
asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with 70%-89% and 50%-69% carotid artery 
stenosis at presentation. Risks of stroke and complications from carotid 
endarterectomy, costs, and quality of life values were estimated from published 
sources.
RESULTS: The medical therapy-based strategy had a lower life expectancy (12.65 
years vs 12.95 years), lower lifetime QALYs (9.96 years vs 10.05 years), and 
lower lifetime costs ($13 699 vs $15 297) when compared with the MR imaging 
IPH-based strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the MR 
imaging IPH strategy compared with the medical therapy-based strategy was $16 
000 per QALY by using a base-case 70-year-old patient. When using starting 
patient ages of 60 and 80 years, the ICERs for the MR imaging IPH strategy were 
$3100 per QALY and $73 000 per QALY, respectively. The ICERs for the MR imaging 
IPH strategy were slightly higher at all ages for 50%-69% stenosis but remained 
below a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY for starting ages of 
60 and 70 years.
CONCLUSION: MR imaging IPH can be used as a cost-effective tool to identify 
patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis most likely to benefit from 
carotid endarterectomy.

BACKGROUND: Anaplastic meningiomas are uncommon primary intracranial tumours 
associated with high level of recurrence and low life expectancy. Through three 
institutions experience, we analysed the clinical characteristics of patients 
with malignant meningiomas to determine their outcome and identify prognostic 
factors that may influence recurrence and survival.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective search identified 62 cases of WHO grade 
III meningiomas, of whom 9 (14.5%) were not considered in the survival analysis 
as no follow-up data were available. Thirty patients (48.4%) had a previous 
history of non-malignant meningioma surgery. The patients underwent a total of 
139 surgical resections and 42 courses of radiotherapy of which 27 were given 
after the WHO grade III meningioma diagnosis.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients (29.5%) were re-operated for a relapse of their 
anaplastic meningioma. Median time between the first and the second surgery was 
1.3 years. Median overall survival time was 3.5 years. Overall survival 
probabilities at 1, 2 and 5 years were 74.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
[63.8, 87.1], 58.7%, 95% CI [46.4, 74.3] and 37.7%, 95% CI [25, 56.8], 
respectively. Extent of resection was associated with the survival.
DISCUSSION: This retrospective series highlights the poor prognosis associated 
with the diagnosis of malignant meningioma. Complete or subtotal resection may 
prolong the patients' survival. We could not confirm the usefulness of 
postoperative radiotherapy.

We aimed to estimate the economic losses currently caused by coal workers' 
pneumoconiosis (CWP) and, on the basis of these measurements, confirm the 
economic benefit of preventive measures. Our cohort study included 1,847 
patients with CWP and 43,742 coal workers without CWP who were registered in the 
employment records of the Datong Coal Mine Group. We calculated the cumulative 
incidence rate of pneumoconiosis using the life-table method. We used the 
dose-response relationship between cumulative incidence density and cumulative 
dust exposure to predict the future trend in the incidence of CWP. We calculate 
the economic loss caused by CWP and economic effectiveness of CWP prevention by 
a step-wise model. The cumulative incidence rates of CWP in the tunneling, 
mining, combining, and helping cohorts were 58.7%, 28.1%, 21.7%, and 4.0%, 
respectively. The cumulative incidence rates increased gradually with increasing 
cumulative dust exposure (CDE). We predicted 4,300 new CWP cases, assuming the 
dust concentrations remained at the levels of 2011. If advanced dustproof 
equipment was adopted, 537 fewer people would be diagnosed with CWP. In all, 
losses of 1.207 billion Renminbi (RMB, official currency of China) would be 
prevented and 4,698.8 healthy life years would be gained. Investments in 
advanced dustproof equipment would be total 843 million RMB, according to our 
study; the ratio of investment to restored economic losses was 1:1.43. 
Controlling workplace dust concentrations is critical to reduce the onset of 
pneumoconiosis and to achieve economic benefits.

Cell counting in microscopic images is one of the fundamental analysis tools in 
life sciences, but is usually tedious, time consuming and prone to human error. 
Several programs for automatic cell counting have been developed so far, but 
most of them demand additional training or data input from the user. Most of 
them do not allow the users to online monitor the counting results, either. 
Therefore, we designed two straightforward, simple-to-use cell-counting programs 
that also allow users to correct the detection results. In this paper, we 
present the Cellcounter and Learn123 programs for automatic and semiautomatic 
counting of objects in fluorescent microscopic images (cells or cell nuclei) 
with a user-friendly interface. Although Cellcounter is based on predefined and 
fine-tuned set of filters optimized on sets of chosen experiments, Learn123 uses 
an evolutionary algorithm to determine the adapt filter parameters based on a 
learning set of images. Cellcounter also includes an extension for analysis of 
overlaying images. The efficiency of both programs was assessed on images of 
cells stained with different fluorescent dyes by comparing automatically 
obtained results with results that were manually annotated by an expert. With 
both programs, the correlation between automatic and manual counting was very 
high (R(2) < 0.9), although Cellcounter had some difficulties processing images 
with no cells or weakly stained cells, where sometimes the background noise was 
recognized as an object of interest. Nevertheless, the differences between 
manual and automatic counting were small compared to variations between 
experimental repeats. Both programs significantly reduced the time required to 
process the acquired images from hours to minutes. The programs enable 
consistent, robust, fast and accurate detection of fluorescent objects and can 
therefore be applied to a range of different applications in different fields of 
life sciences where fluorescent labelling is used for quantification of various 
phenomena. Moreover, Cellcounter overlay extension also enables fast analysis of 
related images that would otherwise require image merging for accurate analysis, 
whereas Learn123's evolutionary algorithm can adapt counting parameters to 
specific sets of images of different experimental settings.

BACKGROUND: The evidence concerning the cost-effectiveness of UGT1A1*28 
genotyping is ambiguous and does not allow drawing valid conclusions for 
Germany. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of UGT1A1 genotyping in 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer undergoing irinotecan-based 
chemotherapy compared to no testing from the perspective of the German statutory 
health insurance.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model with a life time horizon 
was developed. No testing was compared to two genotype-dependent therapy 
strategies: 1) dose reduction by 25%; and 2) administration of a prophylactic 
G-CSF growth factor analog for homozygous and heterozygous patients. 
Probability, quality of life and cost parameters used in this study were based
