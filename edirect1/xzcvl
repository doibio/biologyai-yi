Echinococcosis is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a 
neglected zoonotic disease in the world. Some Tibetan communities were found to 
be highly endemic for echinococcosis just 20 years ago. Until recently, we were 
able to understand the overall disease burden of echinococcosis in Tibetan 
communities after prevalence data being available from nationwide investigations 
from 2012 to 2016. Data were abstracted from 9 publications regarding to 
echinococcosis prevalence between 2016-2018; from 10 data bases on 
echinococcosis prevalence for 151 Tibetan counties; and statistics of 
population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and health staff from 44 local 
statistic bureaus and government websites at provincial, prefecture and county 
level, and 2 books of provincial yearly statistics. These data were used to 
estimate the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) due to cystic echinococcosis 
(CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE). The distribution of DALYs was presented 
geographically and economically. The echinococcosis DALYs in the Tibetan 
communities were estimated to be 126,159 (95%UI 122,415-137,675) annually using 
the method recommended by WHO. AE DALYs were estimated to be 105,829 (95%UI 
101,969-117,090), which were more than CE DALYs of 20,330 (95%UI 19,690-21,581). 
Echinococcosis affects people more in underdeveloped areas. There was a tendency 
that a higher echinococcosis DALYs were usually correlated a higher altitude. 
Health services are also poorly provided in terms of number of health staff of 
5.05 per 1000 population in comparison with the national average of 5.8 per 1000 
population. The data suggest that the echinococcosis burden in the center region 
of Qinghai-Tibet plateau is higher than that of other regions, and consequently 
more control and health services should be provided to the region.

Identification of biomarkers can help monitor and prevent cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) risk. We performed an exploratory analysis to identify potential 
biomarkers for coronary heart disease (CHD) in participants from the Life 
Conditions, Stress, and Health study. A total of 1,007 participants (50% women), 
randomly selected from the general population, were followed for incident CHD at 
8 and 13 years of follow-up. Plasma levels of 184 CVD-related biomarkers were 
measured in samples collected at baseline in 86 cases with CHD and 184 age- and 
sex-matched controls by proximity extension assay. Biomarker levels were 
presented as normalized protein expression values (log 2 scale). After adjusting 
for confounding factors, 6 biomarkers showed significant association with 
incident CHD at 13 years. In a sensitivity analysis, this association remained 
significant at 8 years for 3 biomarkers; collagen α-1(I) chain (COL1A1), bone 
morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6), and interleukin-6 receptor α chain (IL-6Rα). 
When entering these biomarkers in the full adjustment model simultaneously, 
their association with incident CHD at 13 years remained significant, hazards 
ratio being 0.671, 0.335, and 2.854, respectively per unit increase in 
normalized protein expression values. Subjects with low COL1A1, low BMP-6, and 
high IL-6Rα levels had a hazards ratio of 5.097 for incident CHD risk 
(p = 0.019), compared with those without. In conclusion, we identified COL1A1, 
BMP-6 and IL-6Rα as biomarkers for incident CHD over a long-term follow-up in 
this exploratory analysis. For COL1A1 and BMP-6 this has not been previously 
reported. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and establish their 
clinical relevance.

PURPOSE: This study evaluated the effect of early integrated palliative care 
(PC) in oncology on quality of life (QOL) near the end of life and use of health 
care resources near the end of life.
METHOD: Patients with advanced cancer and a life expectancy of approximately 1 
year were randomly assigned to either early and systematic integration of PC 
into oncological care (intervention) or standard oncological care alone 
(control). QOL was assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QOL 
scale and McGill Quality of Life (MQOL) Single Item Scale and Summary Scale at 
baseline, 12 weeks and 6 weekly thereafter until death. Use of health care 
resources was collected from chart review in patient's electronic medical file 
for patients who died while participating in the study.
RESULTS: Of the 186 randomised patients, 185 participants had a baseline 
measurement and were analysed. By November 2017, 128 patients had died while 
participating in the study. When applying the terminal decline model, patients 
in the intervention group scored significantly higher on global health 
status/QOL of the EORTC QLQ C30, at 6 months (difference: 5.9 [0.06; 11.1], 
p = 0.03), 3 (difference: 6.8 [1.0; 12.6], p = 0.02), and 1 month (difference: 
7.6 [0.7; 14.5], p = 0.03) prior to the patient's death compared to the control 
group. Similar results were found for the Single Item Scale and Summary Score of 
the MQOL. We did not observe differences in use of health care resources between 
groups.
DISCUSSION: Early integrated palliative care in oncology is a valuable approach 
since it also increases QOL near the end of life and not only soon after 
initiation of PC.

Type II mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS II) commonly known as Hunter syndrome, is a 
rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by iduronate-2-sulfatase 
deficiency, which in turn causes otorhinolaryngological manifestations, 
including sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Previously, the median survival age 
of patients with MPS was approximately 13.4 years. However, in the era of enzyme 
replacement therapy and other multidisciplinary care modalities, the life 
expectancy has increased. Herein, we report a rare case of an adolescent with 
MPS II who underwent SNHL treatment with cochlear implantation (CI). Based on 
unexpected findings of mastoid emissary veins and overgrowth of the vessels 
around the temporal bone, CI was performed using the transmeatal approach 
instead of the conventional transmastoid method, to avoid damage to the vessels. 
The average hearing threshold after CI was 35 dB and no surgical complications 
were encountered. Adolescent MPS II may present vessel abnormalities, which can 
reduce the success rate of surgery. In patients with MPS II with SNHL, CI should 
be performed under careful monitoring of vessel overgrowth. Moreover, with 
regard to feasibility of CI in adolescent patients with MPS II with SNHL, 
surgical techniques such as the transmeatal approach should be selected based on 
adequate assessment of the case.

Introduction: Mixed aortic valve disease (MAVD) is defined by simultaneous 
occurrence of aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic regurgitation (AR). In our review, 
we focus on treatment options for nonelderly MAVD patients (age<55 years), who 
suffer from congenital aortic valve disease (unicuspid/bicuspid aortic 
valves).Areas covered: A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed 
and Embase databases using the following terms: mixed aortic valve disease, 
aortic stenosis/regurgitation, bicuspid/unicuspid aortic valve, 
mechanical/bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, TAVR, Ross procedure. After 
preselection of title and abstracts, two authors (M.S. and E.G.) assessed the 
methodological quality of the full-text articles prior to final inclusion in the 
manuscript.Expert opinion: Currently, no ideal valvular substitutes are 
available in the treatment of nonelderly MAVD patients. Mechanical valves are 
associated with a reduced life expectancy due to a combination of 
prothesis-associated factors, mainly thrombotic and bleeding complications. 
Bioprostheses degenerate in the second decade and re-operations are inevitable, 
which also limit life expectancy. Long-term outcomes and durability of 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement are currently unknown. Finally, only Ross 
procedure is a therapeutic option with excellent long-term outcomes comparable 
to the healthy population. However, the Ross procedure has some important 
drawbacks and should therefore be only performed in expert centers and in 
well-selected patients.

As life expectancy in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) has improved, 
the risk for developing noncardiac morbidities is increasing in adult patients 
with CHD (ACHD). Among these noncardiac complications, malignancies 
significantly contribute to the disease burden of ACHD patients. Epidemiologic 
studies of cancer risk in CHD patients are challenging because they require 
large numbers of patients, extended follow-up, detailed and validated clinical 
data, and appropriate reference populations. However, several observational 
studies suggest that cancer risks are significantly elevated in patients with 
CHD compared with the general population. CHD and cancer share genetic and 
environmental risk factors. An association with exposure to low-dose ionizing 
radiation secondary to medical therapeutic or diagnostic procedures has been 
reported. Patients with Down syndrome, as well as, to a lesser extent, deletion 
of 22q11.2 and renin-angiotensin system pathologies, may manifest both CHD and a 
predisposition to cancer. Such observations suggest that carcinogenesis and CHD 
may share a common basis in some cases. Finally, specific conditions, such as 
Fontan circulation and cyanotic CHD, may lead to multisystem consequences and 
subsequently to cancer. Nonetheless, there is currently no clear consensus 
regarding appropriate screening for cancer and surveillance modalities in CHD 
patients. Physicians caring for patients with CHD should be aware of this 
potential predisposition and meet screening recommendations for the general 
population fastidiously. An interdisciplinary and global approach is required to 
bridge the knowledge gap in this field.

The introduction of combination of antiretroviral therapy and advancement in 
care of HIV have dramatically changed the natural history of patients living 
with HIV. Today, HIV+ patients have a life expectancy not significantly 
different from HIV uninfected people. However, concerns remain about all the 
comorbidities associated with aging and the effects of chronic therapies in such 
high-risk patients. HIV+ subjects exhibited accelerated atherosclerosis and have 
a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of having coronary artery disease (CAD), usually 
presenting early and aggressively with acute coronary events. Furthermore, HIV+ 
patients with CAD often complain recurrent acute coronary events, and they are 
plagued by major adverse cardiac outcomes. This review will focus on the current 
understanding of the CAD phenotype in HIV+ patients highlighting the topic of 
acute coronary event recurrence and underscoring the role of percutaneous 
management strategies in the light of information derived from invasive coronary 
imaging.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacists have a role to play in supporting the optimal use of 
medicines to ensure older adults receive therapeutic benefit whilst minimising 
medicines-related harm. In Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ), Māori (Indigenous people 
of NZ) experience inequities in the determinants of health, including access to 
medicines, resulting in increased morbidity, earlier onset of chronic conditions 
and reduced life expectancy. This study aims to test the feasibility of a 
pharmacist-led medicines review intervention in community-dwelling Māori older 
adults.
METHOD: This is a non-randomised, non-controlled feasibility study undertaken 
within a kaupapa Māori methodological framework which supports the right of 
Māori to be included throughout the research process and seeks to potentiate 
transformational, positive change for Māori. The research pharmacist will 
recruit 30 participants (Māori; 55 years or older; community-dwelling). 
Participants will undergo a medicines education session with the pharmacist 
(medicines reconciliation, medicines information, well-being goal setting), with 
the option to proceed to a medicines optimisation session that includes the 
participant, pharmacist and primary prescriber (review of potentially 
inappropriate prescribing (PIP); medicines management plan development). Primary 
outcomes: participant and prescriber acceptability of intervention. Secondary 
outcomes include baseline and post-intervention medicines knowledge, PIP and 
quality of life scores, and number of changes made to the medicines regimen.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was granted by the Northern B Health 
and Disability Committee (9/NTB/106). Study results will be disseminated to 
various stakeholders including Māori communities, health practitioners and 
providers, and researchers through meetings and conference presentations, lay 
summaries and peer-reviewed journals. This study is an example of health service 
design, delivery and evaluation, informed by Indigenous knowledge and 
methodology, developed explicitly to address inequities in health outcomes for, 
and with, Māori and will inform the decision to proceed to a randomised 
controlled trial to test the effect of this intervention.

Neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second 
leading cause of death worldwide. In the past 30 years, the absolute numbers of 
deaths and people with disabilities owing to neurological diseases have risen 
substantially, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, and 
further increases are expected globally as a result of population growth and 
ageing. This rise in absolute numbers of people affected suggests that advances 
in prevention and management of major neurological disorders are not 
sufficiently effective to counter global demographic changes. Urgent measures to 
reduce this burden are therefore needed. Because resources for health care and 
research are already overstretched, priorities need to be set to guide policy 
makers, governments, and funding organisations to develop and implement action 
plans for prevention, health care, and research to tackle the growing challenge 
of neurological disorders.

As part of the Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process, the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer (AstraZeneca) of 
durvalumab (IMFINZITM) to submit evidence for the clinical and cost 
effectiveness of durvalumab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, 
unresectable, stage III non-small cell lung cancer whose tumours express 
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on ≥ 1% of tumour cells and whose disease has 
not progressed after platinum-based chemoradiation therapy. Kleijnen Systematic 
Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Centre, was 
commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper 
summarises the company submission (CS), presents the ERG's critical review on 
the clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS, highlights the key 
methodological considerations, and describes the development of the NICE 
guidance by the Appraisal Committee. The CS included a systematic review that 
identified one randomised controlled trial, comparing durvalumab with SoC. 
Participants with tumours expressing PD-L1 on ≥ 1% of tumour cells accounted for 
approximately 40% of the total participants. In this subgroup, a benefit in 
progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 0.31-0.63] and overall survival (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.35-0.81) was reported. 
Adverse events were comparable between both treatments, but more serious adverse 
events were reported for durvalumab (64/213 [30%] vs. 18/90 [20%]). The ERG's 
concerns regarding the economic analysis included a likely overestimation of PFS 
for the durvalumab arm, the choice of timepoint for treatment waning, as well as 
the way treatment waning was incorporated in the model, and potential 
overestimation of utility values without applying an age- or treatment-related 
decrement. The revised ERG base-case resulted in a deterministic incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of £50,238 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, with 
substantial remaining uncertainty. NICE recommended durvalumab as an option for 
use within the Cancer Drugs Fund only in a subpopulation (concurrent 
platinum-based chemoradiation therapy) with a commercially managed access 
agreement in place.

INTRODUCTION: According to the current guidelines, prophylactic carotid 
endarterectomy (CEA) should be considered for patients with asymptomatic carotid 
stenosis (ACS) who are at high-risk of becoming symptomatic, provided they have 
a 3- to 5-year life-expectancy and perioperative stroke/death rates are ≤3%. We 
reviewed the literature to identify negative prognostic factors for long-term 
survival in ACS patients to avoid offering CEA to those not likely to benefit 
from the procedure.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed/MedLine was searched until April 1, 2019, for risk 
prediction models to find ACS patients with poor long-term survival.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Fourteen studies were identified. Cardiac disease/congestive 
heart failure, advanced age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, dialysis/renal insufficiency, lack of statin use and active/previous 
smoking were negative predictors of long-term survival following CEA. The 
concomitant presence of >1 prognostic factor had a cumulative effect on 
long-term mortality rates. High-volume, experienced surgeons and type of 
hospital (academic rather than urban) were positive predictors and affected 
early and long-term survival rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of one or more prognostic factors as well as the 
various risk prediction models can guide selection of ACS patient subgroups for 
which a prophylactic CEA should or should not be offered. Decisions to offer 
prophylactic CEA should weigh in factors like surgeon's experience and hospital 
expertise/volume. Asymptomatic patients not expected to live long enough to 
benefit from the procedure should not be considered for CEA, but should be 
offered best medical treatment.

Urological Research and Education (SURE), Heerlen, The Netherlands.

The function of the lower urinary tract is mainly storage and voiding of urine, 
which is coordinated by the nervous system. Various diseases of the nervous 
system may cause neuro-urological symptoms. Neuro-urological symptoms depend on 
the localization of the disease and the extension of the neurological lesion. 
About 80% of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have neuro-urological symptoms 
within 10 years after diagnosis. In addition, 10% of MS patients may even 
present with voiding dysfunction at disease onset. In this review, different 
types of neuromodulation are discussed. The available studies suggest that 
sacral neuromodulation (SNM) and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) 
may be helpful in the neuromodulation of MS-related overactive bladder symptoms. 
These techniques may not only decrease the severity of symptoms but also 
significantly improve the quality of life of affected patients. Exploring the 
role of implantable tibial nerve stimulation devices in patients with MS could 
open new doors in the management of urgency and urgency incontinence in this 
patient group.

BACKGROUND: Quality of diabetes care in the Netherlands ranked second in the 
Euro Diabetes Index 2014, but data on outcomes are lacking. We assessed trends 
in cardiovascular disease and mortality among type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients in 
the context of risk factor control.
METHODS: Annual cohorts of adult T2DM patients were constructed from the PHARMO 
Database Network. Age-standardised mortality rates and incidence rates (IR) of 
hospitalisations for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, and congestive 
heart failure (CHF) were compared with a diabetes-free population matched on 
age, sex, and general practitioner. Life years lost (LYL) to T2DM or 
cardiovascular disease were determined by comparing life expectancy between 
matched groups. Proportions attaining glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), blood 
pressure (BP), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals were 
assessed annually.
RESULTS: Among 53,602 T2DM patients, slight increases in IR between 2008 and 
2016 were proportional to those in diabetes-free controls; on average T2DM 
increased the risk of mortality by 86%, hospitalisation for AMI 69%, stroke 57%, 
and CHF 185%. At age 55, LYL to T2DM averaged 3.5 years and established CVD 
added 1.8 years, irrespective of sex. HbA1c goal attainment increased from 58% 
to 65%, LDL-C from 56% to 65%, and systolic BP from 57% to 72%.
CONCLUSION: Despite highly organised diabetes care, excess incident 
cardiovascular events and mortality due to T2DM did not decrease over the study 
period. Life expectancy of T2DM patients is significantly reduced and risk 
factor control is suboptimal. This suggests there is considerable room for 
improvement of diabetes care in the Netherlands.

Flow Cytometric Diagnosis of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria: Pearls and 
Pitfalls - A Critical Review Article.

Netherlands.

Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare blood disorder characterized 
by chronic intravascular hemolysis, thromboses in unusual sites and cytopenias 
related to bone marrow failure. The diagnosis is based on the Flow Cytometric 
(FCM) detection of peripheral blood cell clones lacking the surface molecules 
linked to the GPI anchor, which is altered by mutations. Consensus studies have 
developed standardized and robust multicolor FCM assays to disclose PNH clones 
among red cells, neutrophils and monocytes at a high level of sensitivity and 
accuracy. High-resolution procedures have been also established to detect small 
PNH clones at a sensitivity level of around 0.01% in red cells and neutrophils. 
Cell clone type and size have been put into correlation with the clinical 
presentations of the associated diseases, and recommendations for the clinical 
follow-up have been established. The recent advent of the therapeutic monoclonal 
antibody Eculizumab has dramatically improved both the quality of life and the 
life expectancy of the affected patients, further increasing the importance of 
an accurate FCM detection and monitoring of the clones. The technical features 
of the FCM diagnostic workup and the many critical aspects of the analytical 
process are discussed here.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we summarize different allocation schemes 
around the world and identify ways to exchange organs between countries.
RECENT FINDINGS: The primary goal of transplantation is prolongation of patient 
survival and an improved quality of life. Most allocation systems try to match 
the potential survival of the organ with the life expectancy of its recipient. 
Kidney transplantation enables cost reductions by the avoidance of dialysis for 
the healthcare system, which is sometimes the driving force for state 
interventions to enhance donor recruitmentThe major benefit from international 
exchange is the possibility to transplant highly sensitized patients or patients 
with rare HLA allele.In a broad international exchange system, there are three 
possibilities: exchange of surplus organs, exchange of organs to support 
patients with a potentially excessive waiting time because of HLA antibodies or 
rare alleles, and exchange of organs to make the best possible match between 
donor and recipient.
SUMMARY: It is possible to shape a hierarchical allocation scheme, which could 
be applicable in the majority of populations despite different geographical and 
socioeconomic conditions: allocation to recipients with special requirements 
(high-urgency, highly sensitized); identification of a within the 
region/country; in case no suitable recipient can be identified, offer 
countrywide or between countries; for every organ transferred to another 
country, there must be an obligation to give one back.

Aging is the main risk factor for chronic diseases and disablement in human 
societies with a great impact in social and health care expenditures. So far, 
aging and, eventually, death are unavoidable. Nevertheless, research efforts on 
aging-associated diseases with the aim not only to extend life span but also to 
increment health span in an attempt to delay, stop and even reverse the aging 
process have not stopped growing. Caloric restriction extends both health and 
life span in several short-lived experimental models and has brought to light 
the role of different molecular effectors involved in nutrient sensing pathways 
and longevity. This opens the possibility of modulating these molecular 
effectors also in humans to increase longevity and health span. The difficulty 
to implement caloric restricted diets in humans has led to the development of 
new bearable diets such as time-restricted feeding, intermittent fasting or 
diets with limited amounts of some nutrients and to the search of 
pharmacological agents, targeted to the effectors that mediate the extension of 
life and health span in response to these anti-aging diets. Pharmacological 
approaches that eliminate senescent cells or prevent primary causes of aging 
such as telomere attrition also emerge as potential anti-aging strategies. In 
the present article, we review these possible nutritional and pharmacological 
interventions designed to mitigate and/or delay the aging process and to 
increase health and life span.

The antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of Cantharellus cibarius decoction 
and the effect of mushroom addition on the physicochemical and microbiological 
properties of frankfurters during refrigerated storage were studied. Mushroom 
addition significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the formation of total aerobic 
mesophilic bacteria during storage. Regarding the texture, there was no negative 
effect in frankfurters with the mushroom added, compared to the control group of 
sausages. Generally, C. cibarius can be used as a natural ingredient in order to 
prevent the growth of microorganisms in cooked pork sausages, causing an 
extension in shelf life during chilled storage.

Patient Satisfaction in the Spanish National Health Service: Partial Least 
Squares Structural Equation Modeling.

Spain.

The aim of this article was to determine which key indicators influence patient 
satisfaction with the Spanish NHS to provide useful information for policy 
decision-making. A total of 33 variables for each of the 17 Spanish autonomous 
communities were collected from the statistical portal of the Spanish Ministry 
of Health, Social Services, and Equality between 2005 and 2016. A 
cross-sectional study was applied using Partial Least Squares to a Structural 
Equation Model (PLS-SEM). The influence of expenditures, resource allocation, 
and safety were hypothesized about patient satisfaction. Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) and life expectancy were used as control variables. Moreover, the 
influence of resource allocation on use was tested. The model explained 57.1% of 
patient satisfaction with the Spanish NHS. It was positively influenced mainly 
by resource allocation and expenditures, followed by safety and life expectancy. 
Additionally, resources directly influenced the level of use. The number of 
hospital beds, hemodialysis equipment, rate of adverse drug reactions, and 
expenditure positively influenced patient satisfaction. In contrast, the number 
of posts in day hospitals, the hospital infection rate, and the percentage of 
pharmacy spending negatively influenced patient satisfaction.

Preventive Medicine of the Medical University of Lodz, Żeligowskiego 7/9, 90-752 
Lodz, Poland.

The aim of the study was an analysis of mortality trends due to malignant 
neoplasms in Poland. The study material was a database, consisting of 1,367,364 
death certificates of inhabitants of Poland who died during the period 2000-2014 
due to malignant cancer. To calculate years of life lost, the SEYLLp index 
(Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per living person) was applied. We also 
calculated AAPC (Average Annual Percentage Change). The SEYLLp index (per 10,000 
population) due to malignant neoplasms in Poland in males decreased from 586.3 
in 2000 to 575.5 in 2014, whereas in females it increased from 398.6 in 2000 to 
418.3 in 2014. The greatest number of lost years of life in 2014 was attributed 
to lung cancer (174.7 per 10,000 males and 77.3 per 10,000 females), breast 
cancer in females (64.5) and colorectal cancer in males (39.0). The most 
negative trends were observed for lung cancer in females (AAPC = 3.5%) and for 
colorectal cancer (AAPC = 1.8%) and prostate cancer (AAPC = 1.6%) in males. Many 
lost years could have been prevented by including a greater number of Polish 
inhabitants in screening examinations, mostly targeted at malignant neoplasm, 
whose incidence is closely connected with modifiable risk factors.

Metabolic Alterations in Cardiomyocytes of Patients with Duchenne and Becker 
Muscular Dystrophies.

Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD/BMD) result in progressive 
weakness of skeletal and cardiac muscles due to the deficiency of functional 
dystrophin. Respiratory failure is a leading cause of mortality in DMD patients; 
however, improved management of the respiratory symptoms have increased 
patients' life expectancy, thereby also increasing the clinical relevance of 
heart disease. In fact, the prevalence of cardiomyopathy, which significantly 
contributes to mortality in DMD patients, increases with age and disease 
progression, so that over 95% of adult patients has cardiomyopathy signs. We 
here review the current literature featuring the metabolic alterations observed 
in the dystrophic heart of the mdx mouse, i.e., the best-studied animal model of 
the disease, and discuss their pathophysiological role in the DMD heart. It is 
well assessed that dystrophin deficiency is associated with pathological 
alterations of lipid metabolism, intracellular calcium levels, neuronal nitric 
oxide (NO) synthase localization, and NO and reactive oxygen species production. 
These metabolic stressors contribute to impair the function of the cardiac 
mitochondrial bulk, which has a relevant pathophysiological role in the 
development of cardiomyopathy. In fact, mitochondrial dysfunction becomes more 
severe as the dystrophic process progresses, thereby indicating it may be both 
the cause and the consequence of the dystrophic process in the DMD heart.

Despite growing recognition of the issue, obesity represents one of the most 
common public health problems, and its rates are still increasing globally. 
Among the number of comorbidities and complications associated with obesity, 
hypogonadism is listed, and this disorder, although frequently neglected, is 
characterized by a relevant impact on both quality of life and life expectancy. 
It is generally accepted that hypogonadism secondary to obesity is functional 
since it is reversible following weight loss. This review summarizes all current 
research examining the bidirectional relationship between excess body weight and
