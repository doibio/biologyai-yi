BACKGROUND: It is important to understand the effects of population ageing on 
disease burden and explore conditions that drive poor health in later life to 
prevent or manage these. We examined the development of disease burden and its 
components for major disease groups among older adults in Europe over the last 
30 years.
METHODS: Using data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study, we analyzed 
burden of disease trends between 1990 and 2019 measured by years of life lost 
(YLL), years lived with disability (YLD) and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) among older adults (65+ years) in Western, Central and Eastern Europe 
using cause groups for diseases and injuries.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2019, the crude numbers of DALYs for all causes 
increased substantially among older Western Europeans. In Eastern Europe, the 
absolute DALYs also increased from 1990 to 2005 but then decreased between 2006 
and 2013. However, DALY rates declined for all European regions over time, with 
large differences in the magnitude by region and gender. Changes in the YLL rate 
were mainly driven by the contribution of cardiovascular diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found an increased overall absolute disease burden among 
older Europeans between 1990 and 2019. The demographic change that has taken 
place in Eastern European countries implies a potential problem of directed 
resource allocation to the health care sector. Furthermore, the findings 
highlight the potential health gains through directing resources to health 
promotion and treatment to reduce YLDs and to prevent YLLs, primarily from 
cardiovascular diseases.

Diabetes shortens the life expectancy by more than a decade, and the excess 
mortality in diabetes is correlated with the incidence of kidney disease. 
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease. 
Macrophage accumulation predicts the severity of kidney injury in human biopsies 
and experimental models of DKD. However, the mechanism underlying macrophage 
recruitment in diabetes glomeruli is unclear. Elevated plasma growth hormone 
(GH) levels in type I diabetes and acromegalic individuals impaired glomerular 
biology. In this study, we examined whether GH-stimulated podocytes contribute 
to macrophage accumulation. RNA-seq analysis revealed elevated TNF-α signaling 
in GH-treated human podocytes. Conditioned media from GH-treated podocytes 
(GH-CM) induced differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. On the other hand, 
neutralization of GH-CM with the TNF-α antibody diminished GH-CM's action on 
monocytes. The treatment of mice with GH resulted in increased macrophage 
recruitment, podocyte injury, and proteinuria. Furthermore, we noticed the 
activation of TNF-α signaling, macrophage accumulation, and fibrosis in DKD 
patients' kidney biopsies. Our findings suggest that podocytes could secrete 
TNF-α and contribute to macrophage migration, resulting in DKD-related renal 
inflammation. Inhibition of either GH action or TNF-α expression in podocytes 
could be a novel therapeutic approach for DKD treatment.

The stress and strain properties of surimi gels (72.49% moisture content) under 
large deformation were analyzed during penetration (cylindrical, conical, and 
spherical puncture) and extension (ring tensile) tests. Mechanical measurements 
were compared and validated using digital image correlation (DIC) and numerical 
simulations. The DIC and the finite element method reflected the influence of 
the probe shape and the surface area in contact with the gel during the 
measurements. In puncture tests, a larger probe surface increased the strain 
concentration at the puncture point. In the extension test, the strain 
distribution was symmetrical. The strain values observed during penetration 
tests were comparable in both the DIC and numerical simulation. The tensile 
failure characteristics observed in DIC and numerical simulations are similar to 
those found in the experiment. The study demonstrated that the extension method 
with the ring tensile device did not show a stress concentration during the 
measurement, and DIC and numerical simulation can be effective tools in 
analyzing the textural properties of surimi gel during the puncture and ring 
tensile tests.

BACKGROUND: Nowadays, the increase in life expectancy needs to be matched by an 
increase in the wellbeing of older adults. A starting point is the definition of 
what is understood by health-related quality of life and its measurement in 
different contexts. Our research translates these international priorities to a 
local base.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the psychometric characteristics of the World Health 
Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) in a sample of older 
adults from a Spanish urban community (Casablanca).
METHODS: In collaboration with the local health centre, we designed and 
implemented the health neighbourhood survey. Interviews took place at subjects' 
homes with 212 women and 135 men over the age of 60, who were residents in 
Casablanca. With the results, we evaluated the psychometric characteristics of 
WHOQOL-BREF and tested its reliability and validation.
RESULTS: The instrument has a high internal consistency with a Cronbach's Alpha 
of 0.9. The items with higher correlation value were: ability to carry out 
activities in daily life, enough energy for daily life. The scale contributions 
of Physical Health dimension (0.809) and Psychological Health dimension (0.722) 
were notable.
CONCLUSIONS: As with other studies, the instrument proved to be an integral 
evaluation of the diverse domains that condition the wellbeing of older adults.

Smi1 is a protein required for cell cycle progression, morphogenesis, stress 
response and life span of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. FaSmi1 was identified as a 
Smi1 homolog in a wheat scab pathogenic fungus Fusarium asiaticum strain 2021. 
The deletion of FaSmi1 leads to defects in mycelial growth, asexual 
reproduction, and virulence. The FaSmi1 deletion mutant also exhibited increased 
sensitivity to osmotic stresses generated by NaCl and KCl, but increased 
tolerance to oxidative stresses and cell wall integrity inhibitors. All of these 
defects were restored by genetic complementation of the mutant with the whole 
parental FaSmi1 gene. Interestingly, the antioxidant system-associated genes 
exhibit a lower expression level and the mycotoxins' DON content was decreased 
in the FaSmi1 deletion mutant compared with the parental strain 2021. These 
results indicate that FaSmi1 plays a critical role in the vegetative 
development, asexual reproduction, DON production and virulence of F. asiaticum.

Depression is one of the most frequent comorbidities in rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA); it takes an important toll on the quality of life of these patients and 
also leads to a decrease in life expectancy. The current article is a narrative 
review on depression in RA, with the objective to emphasize and raise awareness 
on the high prevalence, pathogenic mechanisms, and effects that depression has 
on RA patients. In RA, the prevalence of depression has been shown to be 2 to 3 
times higher than in the general population, with a meta-analysis reporting that 
16.8% of RA patients have a major depressive disorder. Future studies are needed 
to determine the most accurate self-reported depression questionnaires and their 
ideal threshold for defining depression as compared to diagnostic interview as 
gold-standard for patients with RA to allow better comparisons across studies. 
The pathogenesis of depression remains to be fully understood, but recent 
specialty literature suggests that immune-mediated processes are involved and 
that there are similarities between the neural networks recruited in 
inflammation and those implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. 
Depression in patients with RA is associated with poor long-term outcomes. 
Multiple studies have shown that depression in RA is associated with increased 
pain, fatigue, and physical disability. It alters treatment compliance, causes 
more comorbidities, and leads to higher mortality, partly through increased 
suicide risk. Depression in RA also increases health service utilization and 
healthcare costs directly through hospitalization, but also indirectly through 
loss of work productivity. Assessing depression could be a significant 
psychomarker of rheumatological outcome in RA.

A homogeneous PCR-based assay for sensitive and specific detection of antibodies 
in serum or dried blood spots (DBS) is presented and the method is used to 
monitor individuals infected with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Detection 
probes were prepared by conjugating the recombinant spike protein subunit 1 
(S1), containing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, to each of a 
pair of specific oligonucleotides. The same was done for the nucleocapsid 
protein (NP). Upon incubation with serum or DBS samples, the bi- or multivalency 
of the antibodies (IgG, IgA or IgM) brings pairs of viral proteins with their 
conjugated oligonucleotides in proximity, allowing the antibodies to be detected 
by a modified proximity extension assay (PEA). Anti-S1 and anti-NP antibodies 
could be detected simultaneously from one incubation reaction. This Antibody PEA 
(AbPEA) test uses only 1 µl of neat or up to 100,000-fold diluted serum or one 
ø1.2 mm disc cut from a DBS. All 100 investigated sera and 21 DBS collected 
prior to the COVID-19 outbreak were negative, demonstrating a 100% specificity. 
The area under the curve, as evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic 
(ROC) analysis reached 0.998 (95%CI: 0.993-1) for samples taken from 11 days 
after symptoms onset. The kinetics of antibody responses were monitored after a 
first and second vaccination using serially collected DBS from 14 individuals. 
AbPEA offers highly specific and sensitive solution-phase antibody detection 
without requirement for secondary antibodies, no elution step when using DBS 
sample in a simple procedure that lends itself to multiplex survey of antibody 
responses.

Understanding the systemic approach and its potential for decision-making is 
important for resource management, especially in agriculture in which increasing 
food demands and environmental and social issues are the main challenges. 
Therefore, multiple-criteria decision-making methods have a vital role in the 
optimum combination of resources. Computational models are commonly used to 
assist resource management decision-making; however, while water-energy-food 
nexus (WEFN) are increasingly well modeled, the inclusion of social issues has 
lagged behind. This paper outlines a model based on a multi-objective genetic 
algorithm (MOGA) that conceptualizes and proceduralizes balancing the goals of 
sustainable agricultural development highlighting impacts and interactions 
between social variables and the WEFN index in agriculture. The model was 
developed using a bottom-up approach, informed through farmer interviews, and 
secondary data in the Miandarband plain, west Iran. The Compromise Programming 
(CP) method, which is widely used to solve MOGA models, was applied to 
optimization algorithms in three-dimensional spaces. The model represents field 
conditions and provides a tool for policymakers and sustainable resource 
management. The modeling framework applied to the study area for the comparison 
of WFEN, life cycle assessment (LCA), and social dimension in current and 
optimum cultivation patterns. The proposed optimal cultivation pattern in 
minimum CP will reduce water and energy consumption by 2.56 % and 12.71 % while 
reducing environmental impacts by 6.82 %, and it will improve the social status 
of farmers. Results suggest that changes in the basic elements of objective 
functions will lead to a balance between cultivation patterns that depends on 
policies and socio-economic conditions. Moreover, proposed cultivation patterns 
may be sustainable but their viability varies across the periods and also in 
different human ecologies. However, by analyzing the feedback of the model and 
interactions between different dimensions, this work highlights that 
policymakers can decide sustainable agriculture how should be occur by comparing 
different solutions.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the contribution of avoidable mortality to life 
expectancy inequalities in Wales during 2002-2020.
DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING: Wales, 2002-20, including early data from the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We used routine statistics for 2002-2020 on population and deaths in 
Wales stratified by age, sex, deprivation quintile and cause of death. We 
estimated the contribution of avoidable causes of death and specific 
age-categories using the Arriaga decomposition method to highlight priorities 
for action.
RESULTS: Life expectancy inequalities rose 2002-20 amongst both sexes, driven by 
serial decreases in life expectancy amongst the most deprived quintiles. The 
contributions of amenable and preventable mortality to life expectancy 
inequalities changed relatively little between 2002 and 2020, with larger rises 
in non-avoidable causes. Key avoidable mortality conditions driving the life 
expectancy gap in the most recent period of 2018-2020 for females were 
circulatory disease, cancers, respiratory disease and alcohol- and drug-related 
deaths, and also injuries for males.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy inequalities widened during 2002-20, driven by 
deteriorating life expectancy in the most deprived quintiles. Sustained 
investment in prevention post-COVID-19 is needed to address growing health 
inequity in Wales; there remains a role for the National Health Service in 
ensuring equitable healthcare access to alongside wider policies that promote 
equity.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents of long-term 
care (LTC) facilities is associated with higher mortality after the acute phase 
of infection, and to estimate survival in uninfected residents.
DESIGN: Extended follow-up of a previous, propensity score-matched, 
retrospective cohort study based on the Swedish Senior Alert register.
SETTING: LTC facilities in Sweden.
PARTICIPANTS: n=3604 LTC residents with documented SARS-CoV-2 until 15 September 
2020 matched to 3604 uninfected controls using time-dependent propensity scores 
on age, sex, health status, comorbidities, prescription medications, 
geographical region and Senior Alert registration time. In a secondary analysis 
(n=3731 in each group), geographical region and Senior Alert registration time 
were not matched for in order to increase the follow-up time in controls and 
allow for an estimation of median survival.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause mortality until 24 October 2020, tracked 
using the National Cause of Death Register.
RESULTS: Median age was 87 years and 65% were women. Excess mortality peaked at 
5 days after documented SARS-CoV-2-infection (HR 21.5, 95% CI 15.9 to 29.2), 
after which excess mortality decreased. From the second month onwards, mortality 
rate became lower in infected residents than controls. The HR for death during 
days 61-210 of follow-up was 0.76 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.93). The median survival of 
uninfected controls was 1.6 years, which was much lower than the national life 
expectancy in Sweden at age 87 (5.05 years in men, 6.07 years in women).
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection in LTC residents 
peaked after 5 days and decreased after 2 months, probably because the frailest 
residents died during the acute phase, leaving healthier residents remaining. 
The limited life expectancy in this population suggests that LTC resident status 
should be accounted for when estimating years of life lost due to COVID-19.

Antiphase behaviour of monsoon systems in alternate hemispheres is well 
established at yearly and orbital scales in response to alternating sensible 
heating of continental landmasses. At intermediate timescales without a sensible 
heating mechanism both in-phase and antiphase behaviours of northern and 
southern hemisphere monsoon systems are recorded at different places and 
timescales. At present, there is no continuous, high resolution, precisely dated 
record of millennial-scale variability of the Indonesian-Australian monsoon 
during the last glacial period with which to test theories of paleomonsoon 
behaviour. Here, we present an extension of the Liang Luar, Flores, speleothem 
δ18O record of past changes in southern hemisphere summer monsoon intensity back 
to 55.7 kyr BP. Negative δ18O excursions (stronger monsoon) occur during 
Heinrich events whereas positive excursions (weaker monsoon) occur during 
Dansgaard-Oeschger interstadials-a first order antiphase relationship with 
northern hemisphere summer monsoon records. An association of negative δ18O 
excursions with speleothem growth phases in Liang Luar suggests that these 
stronger monsoons are related to higher rainfall amounts. However, the response 
to millennial-scale variability is inconsistent, including a particularly weak 
response to Heinrich event 3. We suggest that additional drivers such as 
underlying orbital-scale variability and drip hydrology influence the δ18O 
response.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a saliva diagnostic test (Endotest®) for endometriosis 
compared with the conventional algorithm.
DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis with a decision-tree model based on 
literature data.
SETTING: France.
POPULATION: Women with chronic pelvic pain.
METHODS: Strategy I is the French algorithm, representing the comparator. For 
strategy II, all patients have an Endotest®. For strategy III, patients undergo 
ultrasonography to detect endometrioma and patients with no endometrioma 
detected have an Endotest®. For strategy IV, patients with no endometrioma 
detected on ultrasonography undergo pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to 
detect endometrioma and/or deep endometriosis. An Endotest® is then performed 
for patients with a negative result on MRI.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Costs and accuracy rates and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Three analyses were performed with an 
Endotest® priced at €500, €750, and €1000. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
was conducted with Monte Carlo simulations.
RESULTS: With an Endotest® priced at €750, the cost per correctly diagnosed case 
was €1542, €990, €919 and €1000, respectively, for strategies I, II, III and IV. 
Strategy I was dominated by all other strategies. Strategies IV, III and II 
were, respectively, preferred for a willingness-to-pay threshold below €473, 
between €473 and €4670, and beyond €4670 per correctly diagnosed case. At a 
price of €500 per Endotest®, strategy I was dominated by all other strategies. 
At €1000, the ICERs of strategies II and III were €724 and €387 per correctly 
diagnosed case, respectively, compared with strategy I.
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates the value of the Endotest® from an 
economic perspective.

The Mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) played a central role in 
cellular survival and aging. Inhibition of mTOR had been proposed as a 
reasonable strategy to promote lifespan and delay age-related diseases in 
evolutionarily diverse organisms. The study showed that lifespan extension and 
age-related diseases improvement could be achieved by targeting evolutionarily 
conserved mTOR pathways and mechanisms using pharmacological interventions. 
Using this approach in Caenorhabditis elegans, We found that 2 μM Usnic Acid 
significantly extended the healthy lifespan in wild-type animals. Furthermore, 
via genetic screen, we showed that Usnic Acid acted on mTOR, which was followed 
by the activation of PHA-4/Foxa to extend the healthy lifespan. Intriguingly, 
Usnic Acid also delayed neurodegeneration diseases such as Alzheimer's and 
polyglutamine disease through mTOR-dependent manner. Our work suggested that 
Usnic Acid might be a viable candidate for the prevention and treatment of aging 
and age-related diseases.

This dataset provides detailed information on rice production practices being 
applied by farmers during 2018 rainy season in India. Data was collected through 
computer-assisted personal interview of farmers using the digital platform Open 
Data Kit (ODK). The dataset, n = 8355, covers eight Indian states, viz., Andhra 
Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Odisha, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and West 
Bengal. Sampling frames were constructed separately for each district within 
states and farmers were selected randomly. The survey was deployed in 49 
districts with a maximum of 210 interviews per district. The digital survey form 
was available on mobile phones of trained enumerators and was designed to 
minimize data entry errors. Each survey captured approximately 225 variables 
around rice production practices of farmers' largest plot starting with land 
preparation, establishment method, crop variety and planting time through to 
crop yield. Detailed modules captured fertilizer application, irrigation, weed 
management, biotic and abiotic stresses. Additional information was gathered on 
household demographics and marketing. Geo-points were recorded for each surveyed 
plot with an accuracy of <10 m. This dataset is generated to bridge a data-gap 
in the national system and generates information about the adoption of 
technologies, as well as enabling prediction and other analytics. It can 
potentially be the basis for evidence-based agriculture programming by policy 
makers.

BACKGROUND: Older adult patients are frequently referred to surgical services 
for the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). The appropriateness of 
offering surgery to patients with serious comorbidities and a limited life 
expectancy has been questioned in the literature. The purpose of this study was 
to determine the morbidity and 5-year mortality for patients with NMSC referred 
to the plastic surgery service.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed from July 1, 2011, to June 
30, 2015, of all plastic surgery service consults for the treatment of NMSC. We 
collected the following data: age and life-limiting comorbidities at the time of 
referral, treatment, complications, and 5-year mortality. A χ2 analysis was used 
to determine the statistical significance (P < .05) between the individual risk 
factors and 5-year mortality. The relative risk of 5-year mortality was 
calculated combining advanced age with individual comorbidities.
RESULTS: The plastic surgery service completed 800 consults for NMSC over a 
4-year period. Five-year mortality was 28.6%. Median age of patients deceased at 
5 years was 78 years at the time of the consult submission. The surgical 
complication rate was 5%. Aged ≥ 80 years, coronary artery disease, congestive 
heart failure, cerebral vascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, dementia, 
chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes 
mellitus were found individually to be statistically significant predictors of 
5-year mortality. Combining aged ≥ 80 years, coronary artery disease, congestive 
heart failure, or dementia increased the 5-year mortality to a relative risk > 
3.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical excision of NMSC in older adult patients is indicated in 
most situations. A frank discussion with the patient and caregiver is suggested. 
Surgical treatment of NMSC in older adult patients has a low morbidity but needs 
to be balanced against a patient's quality of life when they present with 
life-limiting comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: A new 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) provides 
protection against 20 pneumococcal serotypes. The vaccine has the potential to 
decrease the impact of pneumococcal diseases in society and to increase health 
among vulnerable persons.
AIM: This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating Danish adults 
in different age groups and risk of pneumococcal disease with PCV20 compared to 
the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) - either as PCV20 
compared to PPV23 or as PPV23 followed by PCV20 compared to PPV23.
METHODS: A Markov model adapted to the Danish setting was developed to estimate 
clinical outcomes and costs of vaccinating the Danish population in specific age 
and risk groups. The model used a restricted societal perspective and estimated 
outcomes and costs using a lifetime time horizon. To estimate the clinical 
outcomes and costs, inputs on vaccine effectiveness and waning were retrieved 
from other studies whereas data on risk groups, coverage and costs were based on 
real-world data.
RESULTS: The results showed that in all scenarios the incidence and mortality of 
pneumococcal disease were reduced when vaccinating with PCV20, resulting in 
lower costs. For the vaccine target group of adults aged ≥18 years at moderate 
or high risk and all adults aged ≥65 years both in the case of PPV23+PCV20 
compared to PPV23 and in case of PCV20 compared to PPV23 vaccination with PCV20 
was found to be a dominant strategy gaining 1,350 or 5,821 quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), respectively, and reducing total costs by 60 or 396 million EUR, 
respectively, as compared to PPV23 vaccination alone. Similar results of 
dominant PCV20 strategy were found for other age and risk group comparisons. 
Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the results 
being robust to changes in input parameters and applied assumptions.
LIMITATIONS: Like other modelling studies, this analysis has limitations such as 
lack of detailed data for some inputs.
CONCLUSION: Vaccination with PCV20 reduced the incidence and mortality of 
pneumococcal diseases in Danish adults compared to PPV23. This reduction has the 
potential to reduce the financial burden related to managing diseases while also 
increasing public health.

Copper (Cu2+) is a micronutrient that promotes the development and reproduction 
of organisms. However, with the rapid expansion of modern industry and 
agriculture, Cu2+ concentrations are increasing, which might have negative 
impacts on biological and ecological safety. Spodoptera litura is not only an 
intermittent outbreak pest but also can be used as a model organism to assess 
environmental and ecological risks. Therefore, the effects of the life history 
and population parameters of S. litura fed on artificial diets with different 
Cu2+ concentrations were analyzed using the age-stage, two-sex life table. Our 
results showed that not only the preadult survival rate but also the intrinsic 
rate of increase (r) and the finite rate of increase (λ) were significantly 
increased under exposure to low Cu2+ concentrations (2, 4, and 8 mg/kg). In 
addition, the population growth of S. litura was significantly faster, 
indicating that S. litura can adapt well to low concentrations and is likely to 
undergo outbreaks of damage. Whereas, in addition to a significant reduction in 
preadult survival rate, population growth rate, pupal weight, pupal length, 
adult body weight, and oviposition were also significantly reduced under 
exposure to high Cu2+ concentration (32 mg/kg). And when the concentration 
reached 64 mg/kg, the survival rate of adults was extremely low, suggesting a 
decrease in the adaptation of S. litura. These results can help to understand 
the population dynamics of S. litura and predict potential ecological risks.

familial cancer.

BACKGROUND: Targeted germline testing is recommended for those with or at risk 
of breast, ovarian, or colorectal cancer. The affordability of genetic 
sequencing has improved over the past decade, therefore the cost-effectiveness 
of testing for these cancers is worthy of reassessment.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review economic evaluations on cost-effectiveness 
of germline testing in breast, ovarian, or colorectal cancer.
METHODS: A search of PubMed and Embase databases for cost-effectiveness studies 
on germline testing in breast, ovarian, or colorectal cancer, published between 
1999 and May 2022. Synthesis of methodology, cost-effectiveness, and reporting 
(CHEERS checklist) was performed.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; in 2021-adjusted US$) 
for germline testing versus the standard care option in hereditary breast or 
ovarian cancer (HBOC) across target settings were as follows: (1) 
population-wide testing: 344-2.5 million/QALY; (2) women with high-risk: 
dominant = 78,118/QALY, 8,337-59,708/LYG; (3) existing breast or ovarian cancer: 
3,012-72,566/QALY, 39,835/LYG; and (4) metastatic breast cancer: 158,630/QALY. 
Likewise, ICERs of germline testing for colorectal cancer across settings were: 
(1) population-wide testing: 132,200/QALY, 1.1 million/LYG; (2) people with 
high-risk: 32,322-76,750/QALY, dominant = 353/LYG; and (3) patients with 
existing colorectal cancer: dominant = 54,122/QALY, 98,790-6.3 million/LYG. Key 
areas of underreporting were the inclusion of a health economic analysis plan 
(100% of HBOC and colorectal studies), engagement of patients and stakeholders 
(95.4% of HBOC, 100% of colorectal studies) and measurement of outcomes (18.2% 
HBOC, 38.9% of colorectal studies).
CONCLUSION: Germline testing for HBOC was likely to be cost-effective across 
most settings, except when used as a co-dependent technology with the PARP 
inhibitor, olaparib in metastatic breast cancer. In colorectal cancer studies, 
testing was cost-effective in those with high-risk, but inconclusive in other 
settings. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to the prevalence of tested variants, 
cost of testing, uptake, and benefits of prophylactic measures. Policy advice on 
germline testing should emphasize the importance of these factors in their 
recommendations.

Plain Language Summary: Breast, ovarian, prostate, and colorectal cancers are 
among the top causes of cancer related deaths. A substantial proportion of 
people with these cancers have inherited mutations. The identification of these 
gene abnormalities could provide people with opportunities to utilize preventive 
risk reduction surgeries or undertake frequent routine testing for these 
cancers. However, genetic testing requires healthcare resources and money. 
Previous reviews on the cost-effectiveness of genetic testing in familial 
cancers have concluded that targeted screening i.e., selective assessment of 
people at high-risk could justify the costs of testing. Our evaluation of 
economic studies in breast and ovarian cancer, however, suggests that genetic 
testing is cost-effective across a wide variety of situations starting from the 
screening of all healthy women above 30 years to the testing of women with 
existing breast or ovarian cancer. Testing in metastatic breast cancer to inform 
treatment with Olaparib, a drug known to selectively improve survival in people 
with genetic mutations, was the sole exception where testing was not 
cost-effective. Contrary to findings for breast or ovarian cancer, testing for 
colorectal cancer was cost-effective in people with high-risk i.e., family 
history but inconclusive in other situations. Evidence on the cost-effectiveness 
of testing in prostate cancer is lacking and as a result we were not able to 
provide advice in this cancer group.
