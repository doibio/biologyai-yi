OBJECTIVE: The proprietary cyanoacrylate closure (CAC) system vs radiofrequency 
ablation (RFA) trial (VenaSeal Sapheon Closure System Pivotal Study [VeClose]) 
showed that CAC, a nontumescent, nonthermal, nonsclerosant ablation technique, 
was effective and noninferior to RFA in vein closure with good 36-month 
outcomes. Conducted under a separate protocol, the aim of this extended 
follow-up was to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of CAC and RFA 
for the treatment of incompetent great saphenous veins (GSV) at 5 years 
(60 months) of follow-up.
METHODS: This 60-month extension study was conducted for all patients who 
completed the randomized VeClose study and who were willing to participate. The 
pivotal VeClose study included patients with symptomatic moderate to severe 
varicosities (Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology [CEAP] class 
C2-C4b) and symptomatic GSV incompetence who were randomly assigned (1:1) to 
either CAC or RFA. The primary outcome measure of this 60-month extension study 
was complete closure of the target vein, with planned exploratory analysis of 
noninferiority. Secondary outcomes included CEAP class; completion of the Venous 
Clinical Severity Score, EuroQol-Five Dimension survey, and Aberdeen Varicose 
Vein Questionnaire; patient satisfaction with treatment; adverse events (AEs) 
related to target GSV; and details of adjunctive procedures.
RESULTS: A total of 89 patients completed the 60-month visit, which included 47 
from the CAC group, 33 from the RFA group, and 9 CAC roll-in patients. No new 
recanalization events have been observed in the groups between 36 and 60 months 
of follow-up. At 60 months, Kaplan-Meier estimates for freedom from 
recanalization in the randomized CAC and RFA groups were 91.4% and 85.2%, 
respectively, demonstrating noninferiority of CAC compared with RFA. Both groups 
demonstrated sustained improvements in EuroQol-Five Dimension and quality of 
life measures through 60 months. Whereas patients assigned to C0 or C1 clinical 
class were excluded from the original study, more than half of all returning 
patients (64% [57/89]) were now assigned to C0 or C1, suggesting an improved 
clinical class from baseline. Furthermore, 41.1% of returning CAC patients and 
39.4% of returning RFA patients are presently at least two CEAP clinical classes 
lower than at baseline. No long-term device- or procedure-related serious AEs 
occurred in either group between 36- and 60-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: CAC and RFA were effective in achieving complete target vein 
closure of the GSV at long-term follow-up, with CAC demonstrating continued 
noninferiority to RFA. CAC was also associated with sustained improvements in 
symptoms and quality of life, lower CEAP class, and high level of patient 
satisfaction without serious AEs between 36 and 60 months.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate whether tenofovir prophylaxis for 
mothers with high viral loads in late pregnancy is a cost-effective way to 
prevent mother-to-child hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission in China.
METHODS: A decision tree Markov model was constructed for a cohort of infants 
born to HBV surface antigen-positive mothers in China, 2016. The expected cost 
and effectiveness were compared between the current active-passive 
immunoprophylaxis strategy and the tenofovir prophylaxis strategy, and the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. One-way and multi-way 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: For 100,000 babies born to mothers positive for hepatitis B surface 
antigen, tenofovir prophylaxis strategy will prevent 2213 perinatal HBV 
infections and will gain 931 quality-adjusted life years when compared with the 
current active-passive immunoprophylaxis strategy. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was ￥59,973 ($9087) per quality-adjusted life years 
gained. This result was robust over a wide range of assumptions.
CONCLUSIONS: Tenofovir prophylaxis for mothers with high viral loads in late 
pregnancy was found to be more cost-effective than the current active-passive 
immunoprophylaxis alone. Embedding tenofovir prophylaxis for mothers with high 
virus loads into the present hepatitis B prevention strategies should be 
considered to further prevent mother-to-child hepatitis B transmission in China.

Forest Baptist Medical Center, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have extended the 
life expectancy of patients with heart failure. The hemodynamic support afforded 
by LVADs in this population has also resulted in patients having prolonged 
ventricular arrhythmias. The purpose of this article is to review the mechanisms 
of ventricular arrhythmias in LVADs and the available management strategies.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence suggests that prolonged ventricular arrhythmias 
may result in increased mortality in patients with LVADs.
SUMMARY: Successful management of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with LVAD 
requires interdisciplinary collaboration between electrophysiology and heart 
failure specialists. Medical management, including changes to LVAD changes, 
heart failure medication management, and antiarrhythmics constitute the initial 
treatment for ventricular arrhythmias. Surgical or endocardial ablation are 
reasonable options if VAs are refractory.

Globally, the life expectancy for men is 5.1 years less than for women. This 
gender gap in mortality is intrinsically linked to a higher proportion of 
premature male mortality and is a significant economic, social and healthcare 
issue. We explore the main causes for premature male death and also discuss the 
need for a dedicated men's health clinic, especially in the context of potential 
commercial exploitation.

Newer advances in breast cancer management have led to increased disease free 
survival and overall survival. It is important to prevent debilitating 
complications after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) to be able to 
successfully translate this survival benefit to quality of life benefit. By 
reducing disruption of lymphatic channels, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) 
decreases incidence of lymphedema (LE). Initiating early physiotherapy regimens, 
too, improves arm symptoms. In this review, we analyze the incidence of LE at 
our center and compare it with western literature. Retrospective analysis of all 
post-surgery breast cancer 18 patients, who followed up routinely with our 
oncophysiotherapist, was carried out. Incidence of LE in patients undergoing 
SLNB or ALND was followed up for a mean period of 17.5 months. Only 3.6%, i.e., 
6 patients out of 166 developed LE. Amongst 166, 80 had only SLNB; the rest had 
ALND (either upfront or post-positive SLNB). None of the SLNB only cohort 
patients developed LE. SLNB in clinically node negative axilla, followed by 
initiation of arm physiotherapy early in post-operative period, may reduce LE 
incidence in breast cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Considering the high concentrations of pollutants in large cities of 
Iran and the high prevalence of heart failure (HF) among Iranians, especially 
with increasing life expectancy, this study investigated the relationship 
between airborne contaminants with a diameter < 2.5 µm or particulate matter 2.5 
(PM2.5) and hospitalization and mortality in patients with HF in Isfahan, Iran, 
during 2011.
METHODS: This ecological study was carried out on a part of data from the 
CAPACITY study. A total of 275 patients with HF were randomly selected from 840 
subjects with International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code I50 in the CAPACITY study. Patients' records 
were evaluated and their clinical characteristics, disease history, and 
laboratory and echocardiographic findings were extracted. Air pollution and 
climatic data were extracted from the CAPACITY study. Poisson regression was 
used in crude and adjusted models to evaluate the association between PM2.5 and 
study outcomes. All analyses were performed using crude models and models 
adjusted for temperature, dew point, and wind speed.
RESULTS: 54.9% (n = 151) were men with mean age of 70.4 ± 13.7 years. While most 
patients (85.8%) were discharged after recovery, 14.2% of the patients died in 
the hospital. Blood glucose, heart rate, and ejection fraction (EF) were 
significantly higher on unhealthy days than normal days. Regression analysis 
revealed no significant relationships between hospitalization and mortality 
rates and PM2.5 concentrations on healthy days, unhealthy days for sensitive 
people, and unhealthy days.
CONCLUSION: The model used in our study revealed no significant relationships 
between PM2.5 concentrations and hospital admission on healthy days, unhealthy 
days for sensitive people, and unhealthy days.

Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute (RVSRI) turned 95 years old in 2015. 
Majority of the animal infectious diseases such as rinderpest and anthrax that 
used to frequently strike the historic Persia are now gone for good or under 
control owing to the pioneering researches conducted at the institute in the 
early-mid 20th century in the field of vaccine manufacturing. The earliest such 
scientific contributions, were truly made by the French eminent veterinarian Dr. 
Louis Pierre Joseph Delpy who joined the institute in 1931. In his 18 year-long 
directorship tenure he taught his colleagues fundamentals of vaccinology, basics 
of modern epidemiology, essentials of infectious disease control disciplines, 
the art of scientific writing and much more things that changed the institute 
for ever. This paper reviews the events and turning points in the first 25 years 
of service of the institute in a chronological way and remarks Delpy's principle 
involvements in all of these on the occasion of the 120 anniversary of his 
birth. At the entrance of the institute headquarter building where his bronze 
bust is placed, visitors can see a memorial etched plate that reads "... The 
architect of Razi and founder of Archives De L'Institute Razi (Archives of Razi 
Institute) was an enthusiastic scientist with a creative mind. … For the Razi 
community, Dr Delpy is gone but not forgotten."

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the association between the 
incidence of and mortality due to corpus uteri cancer (CUC) and the human 
development index (HDI) across the world.
METHODS: This was an ecological study. The incidence and mortality rates of CUC 
along with HDI data were extracted from the Global Cancer Data in 2018. 
Subsequently, correlation coefficient and linear regression model were used to 
determine the association between the incidence and mortality rates of CUC and 
the HDI. STATA-14 was used for data analysis.
RESULTS: There was a positive and significant correlation between the incidence 
(r=0.693; P<0.001) and mortality (r=0.284; P<0.001) rates of uterine cancer and 
the HDI. A positive and significant correlation was also observed between the 
incidence rate and the gross national income per 1,000 capita (r=0.440; 
P<0.001), mean years of schooling (MYS) (r=0.740; P<0.001), life expectancy at 
birth (LEB) (r=0.590; P<0.001), and expected years of schooling (r=0.650; 
P<0.001). The results of the linear regression model showed a significant 
statistical association between MYS and the incidence of CUC (β=1.10; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.60-1.70) and LEB and mortality due to uteri cancer 
(β=0.40; 95% CI, 0.10-0.90).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest a significant statistical 
association between the incidence and mortality rates of CUC and the HDI.

The hazards of smoking and the benefits of cessation: a critical summation of 
the epidemiological evidence in high-income countries.

Jha P(1).

Unity Health, Toronto, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

In high-income countries, the biggest cause of premature death, defined as death 
before 70 years, is smoking of manufactured cigarettes. Smoking-related disease 
was responsible for about 41 million deaths in the United States, United Kingdom 
and Canada, cumulatively, from 1960 to 2020. Every million cigarettes smoked 
leads to one death in the US and Canada, but slightly more than one death in the 
UK. The 21st century hazards reveal that smokers who start smoking early in 
adult life and do not quit lose a decade of life expectancy versus non-smokers. 
Cessation, particularly before age 40 years, yields large reductions in 
mortality risk. Up to two-thirds of deaths among smokers are avoidable at 
non-smoking death rates, and former smokers have about only a quarter of the 
excess risk of death compared to current smokers. The gap between scientific and 
popular understanding of smoking hazards is surprisingly large.

Aims: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has a substantial 
impact on costs and patients' quality-of-life. This study aimed to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), cardiac 
resynchronization therapy pacemakers (CRT-P), cardiac resynchronization therapy 
defibrillators (CRT-D), and optimal pharmacologic therapy (OPT) in patients with 
HFrEF, from a US payer perspective.Materials and methods: The analyses were 
conducted by adapting the UK-based cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) to the US 
payer perspective by incorporating real world evidence (RWE) on baseline 
hospitalization risk and Medicare-specific costs. The CEA was based on 
regression equations estimated from data from 13 randomized clinical trials 
(n = 12,638). Risk equations were used to predict all-cause mortality, 
hospitalization rates, health-related quality-of-life, and device-specific 
treatment effects (vs. OPT). These equations included the following prognostic 
characteristics: age, QRS duration, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, 
ischemic etiology, and left bundle branch block (LBBB). Baseline hospitalization 
rates were calibrated based on RWE from Truven Health Analytics MarketScan data 
(2009-2014). A US payer perspective, lifetime time horizon, and 3% discount 
rates for costs and outcomes were used. Benefits were expressed as 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was 
conducted for 24 sub-groups based on LBBB status, QRS duration, and NYHA 
class.Results: Results of the analyses show that CRT-D was the most 
cost-effective treatment at a $100,000/QALY threshold in 14 of the 16 sub-groups 
for which it is indicated. Results were most sensitive to changes in estimates 
of hospitalization costs.Limitations: Study limitations include small sample 
sizes for NYHA I and IV sub-groups and lack of data availability for duration of 
treatment effect.Conclusions: CRT-D has higher greater cost-effectiveness across 
more sub-groups in the indicated patient populations against as compared to OPT, 
ICD, and CRT-P, from a US payer perspective.

IMPORTANCE: Elevated blood glucose levels are common in hospitalized older 
adults and may lead clinicians to intensify outpatient diabetes medications at 
discharge, risking potential overtreatment when patients return home.
OBJECTIVE: To assess how often hospitalized older adults are discharged with 
intensified diabetes medications and the likelihood of benefit associated with 
these intensifications.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study examined 
patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes not previously requiring insulin. 
The study included patients who were hospitalized in a Veterans Health 
Administration hospital for common medical conditions between 2011 and 2013.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Intensification of outpatient diabetes medications, 
defined as receiving a new or higher-dose medication at discharge than was being 
taken prior to hospitalization. Mixed-effect logistic regression models were 
used to control for patient and hospitalization characteristics.
RESULTS: Of 16 178 patients (mean [SD] age, 73 [8] years; 15 895 [98%] men), 
8535 (53%) had a preadmission hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level less than 7.0%, and 
1044 (6%) had an HbA1c level greater than 9.0%. Overall, 1626 patients (10%) 
were discharged with intensified diabetes medications including 781 (5%) with 
new insulins and 557 (3%) with intensified sulfonylureas. Nearly half of 
patients receiving intensifications (49% [791 of 1626]) were classified as being 
unlikely to benefit owing to limited life expectancy or already being at goal 
HbA1c, while 20% (329 of 1626) were classified as having potential to benefit. 
Both preadmission HbA1c level and inpatient blood glucose recordings were 
associated with discharge with intensified diabetes medications. Among patients 
with a preadmission HbA1c level less than 7.0%, the predicted probability of 
receiving an intensification was 4% (95% CI, 3%-4%) for patients without 
elevated inpatient blood glucose levels and 21% (95% CI, 15%-26%) for patients 
with severely elevated inpatient blood glucose levels.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, 1 in 10 older adults with diabetes 
hospitalized for common medical conditions was discharged with intensified

owing to limited life expectancy or already being at their HbA1c goal.

BACKGROUND: Physicians and caregivers are conflicted over whether to inform 
patients that their disease is terminal. Studies examining the effect of 
awareness of prognosis on the survival and quality of life of terminally ill 
cancer patients report conflicting results. This study aimed to assess the 
effects of prognosis awareness on the survival time and psychological health of 
terminally ill cancer patients.
METHODS: Patients in the hospice wards of two general hospitals were asked to 
complete a questionnaire. All were mentally alert and could express themselves 
clearly. Awareness of prognosis was defined as knowing both the diagnosis and 
exact prognosis. Survival time was defined as the time from hospital admission 
to death. Multiple psychological examinations were conducted to verify the 
effect of prognosis awareness on psychological health.
RESULTS: Of the 98 subjects who met the inclusion criteria, 65 (66.3%) were 
aware of their terminal status. The patients' awareness was significantly 
related to survival time after adjusting for clinical variables with a hazard 
ratio of 1.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-2.86). Furthermore, the 
unaware group had a higher risk of cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State 
Examination <24; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.65; 95% CI, 1.26-10.59) and a 
poorer quality of life (physical component summary of the Short Form 36-item 
Health Survey <20; aOR, 3.61; 95% CI, 1.12- 11.60) than the aware group.
CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the exact prognosis might have a positive effect on the 
survival and quality of life of terminally ill cancer patients.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 10% of the global population and poses 
significant challenges for societies and health care systems worldwide. To 
illustrate these challenges and inform cost-effectiveness analyses, we undertook 
a comprehensive systematic scoping review that explored costs, health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) and life expectancy (LE) amongst individuals with CKD. 
Costs were examined from a health system and societal perspective, and HRQoL was 
assessed from a societal and patient perspective. Papers published in English 
from 2015 onward found through a systematic search strategy formed the basis of 
the review. All costs were adjusted for inflation and expressed in US$ after 
correcting for purchasing power parity. From the health system perspective, 
progression from CKD stages 1-2 to CKD stages 3a-3b was associated with a 
1.1-1.7 fold increase in per patient mean annual health care cost. The 
progression from CKD stage 3 to CKD stages 4-5 was associated with a 1.3-4.2 
fold increase in costs, with the highest costs associated with end-stage renal 
disease at $20,110 to $100,593 per patient. Mean EuroQol-5D index scores ranged 
from 0.80 to 0.86 for CKD stages 1-3, and decreased to 0.73-0.79 for CKD stages 
4-5. For treatment with renal replacement therapy, transplant recipients 
incurred lower costs and demonstrated higher HRQoL scores with longer LE 
compared to dialysis patients. The study has provided a comprehensive updated 
overview of the burden associated with different CKD stages and renal 
replacement therapy modalities across developed countries. These data will be 
useful for the assessment of new renal services/therapies in terms of 
cost-effectiveness.

Low costs of adaptation to dietary restriction.

Dietary restriction (DR) is the most successful and widespread means of 
extending organismal lifespan. However, the evolutionary basis of life extension 
under DR remains uncertain. The traditional evolutionary explanation is that 
when organisms experience DR, they allocate endogenous resources to survival and 
postpone reproduction until conditions improve. However, this life-extension 
strategy should be maladaptive if DR continues for multiple generations due to 
trade-offs between longevity and reproduction. To test this prediction, we 
subjected the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to 1800 generations of 
evolution on restricted versus non-restricted diets. Adaptation to a 
non-restricted diet improved reproductive fitness by 57%, but provided a much 
smaller (14%) advantage on a restricted diet. By contrast, adaptation to DR 
resulted in an approximately 35% increase in reproductive fitness on both 
restricted and non-restricted diets. Importantly, the life-extending effect of 
DR did not decrease following long-term evolution on the restricted diet. Thus, 
contrary to theoretical expectations, we found no evidence that the 
life-extending DR response became maladaptive during multigenerational DR. 
Together, our results suggest that the DR response has a low cost and that this 
phenomenon may have evolved as part of a generalist strategy that extends beyond 
the benefits of postponing reproduction.

With an increase in life expectancy, the incidence of chronic degenerative 
pathologies such as dementia has progressively risen. Cognitive impairment leads 
to the gradual loss of skills, which results in substantial personal and 
financial cost at the individual and societal levels. Grapes and wines are rich 
in healthy compounds, which may help to maintain homeostasis and reduce the risk 
of several chronic illnesses, including dementia. This review analyzed papers 
that were systematically searched in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and CAB-Abstract, 
using the association between grapes (or their derivatives) and their effects on 
cognitive functions in humans. Analysis was restricted to epidemiological and 
randomized-controlled studies. Consumption of grape juice (200-500 mL/day) 
and/or light-to-moderate wine (one to four glasses/day) was generally associated 
with improved cognitive performance, while the results for other alcoholic 
beverages were controversial and inconclusive. Bioactive molecules contained in 
grapes and wine were also considered, with particular attention paid to 
resveratrol. Due to the relatively high doses required (150-1000 mg/day) for 
bioactivity coupled with its low bioavailability, resveratrol is only one of the 
possible grape-derived compounds that may partly underpin the beneficial effects 
of grapes on the central nervous system.

The majority of patients diagnosed with cancer are ≥65 years. However, inclusion 
of older patients with cancer in clinical trials is limited, and so there is 
less evidence to guide systemic therapeutic decisions in these patients. There 
is also debate surrounding the definition of "older patients". Additionally, 
comorbidities, as well as life expectancy will influence compliance to any 
treatment, and physicians may favour less intense regimens for these patients or 
best supportive care alone. In patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC), surgery 
followed by adjuvant capecitabine (BILCAP phase 3 trial) is the only potentially 
curative option, but patients often present with advanced disease, and 
palliative systemic treatment is given. The availability of novel targeted 
therapies (oral and monotherapy) in selected populations of patients with BTC 
may increase the therapeutic artillery for these older patients. Trials to date 
in patients with BTC have not been age-specific and have not always included age 
subgroup analysis, and so the evidence to support treatment of older patients is 
derived via extrapolation, primarily, with only 35% being >60 years in the 
adjuvant BILCAP study, for example. When this evidence is provided, treated 
patients tend to gain equivalent survival benefit, irrespective of age. A 
comprehensive clinical geriatric assessment is recommended. Revision of existing 
BTC treatment guidelines should incorporate some reference to best practice in 
older patients with BTC. Observational data may also provide valuable insights 
in this population. Age sub-group analysis should be encouraged in prospective 
clinical trials including patients with BTC, with age-specific trials favoured.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Patients with severe cervical deformity (CD) often have 
profound deficits in numerous activities of daily living. The association 
between health status and postoperative radiographic goals is difficult to 
quantify.
PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the radiographic characteristics of patients 
who achieved optimal health related quality of life scores following surgery for 
CD.
STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collected 
database of patients with spinal deformity.
PATIENT SAMPLE: One hundred and fifty-three patients with cervical deformity 
OUTCOME MEASURES: Common health-related quality of life scores (HRQOLs) 
measurements were taken for patients treated operatively for cervical deformity 
including neck disability index (NDI), modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association 
scale (mJOA) for myelopathy and numeric rating scale for neck pain (NRS-neck), 
METHODS: Surgical patients with severe CD were isolated based upon a previously 
presented discriminant analysis which outlined a combination of preoperative 
cervical sagittal vertical axis (cSVA), T1 slope, maximum focal kyphosis in 
extension, C2 slope in extension, and number of kyphotic levels in extension. 
Those with available preoperative and 1-year postoperative HRQL data were 
included. Based on a previous study, patients were grouped into three distinct 
sagittal morphotypes of CD: focal deformity (FD), flat neck (FN = large TS-CL 
and lack of compensation), or cervicothoracic (CT). Postoperative outcomes were 
defined as "good" if a patient had ≥2 of the three following criteria (1) NDI 
<20 or meeting MCID, (2) mild myelopathy (mJOA≥14), and (3) NRS-Neck ≤5 or 
improved by ≥2 points from baseline. Within each distinct deformity group, 
patients with good outcomes were compared to those with poor outcomes (ie, not 
meeting the criteria for good) for differences in demographics, HRQOL scores, 
and alignment, via Chi-squared or student's t tests.
RESULTS: Overall, 83 of 153 patients met the criteria of severe CD and 40 
patients had complete 1-year follow-up of clinical/radiographic data. Patient 
breakdown by deformity pattern was: CT (N=13), FN (N=17), and FD (N=17), with 7 
patients meeting criteria for both FD and FN deformities. Within the FD cohort, 
maximal focal kyphosis (ie, kyphosis at one level) was better corrected in 
patients with a "good" outcome (p=.03). In the FN cohort, patients with "good" 
outcomes presented preoperatively with worse horizontal gaze (McGregor Slope 21° 
vs. 6°, p=.061) and cSVA (72 mm vs. 60 mm, p=.030). "Good" outcome FN patients 
showed significantly greater postop correction of horizontal gaze (-25° vs. -5°, 
p=.031). In the CT cohort, patients with "good" outcomes had superior global 
alignment both pre- (SVA: -17 mm vs. 108 mm, p<.001) and postoperatively (50 mm 
vs. 145 mm, p=.001). CT patients with "good" outcomes also had better postop 
cervical alignment (cSVA 35 mm vs. 49 mm, p=.030), and less kyphotic segments 
during extension (p=.011). In the FD cohort, there were no differences between 
"good" and "poor" outcomes patients in preoperative alignment; however, "good" 
outcome patients showed superior changes in postoperative focal kyphosis (-2° 
vs. 5°, p=.030). Within all three deformity pattern categories, there were no 
differences between "good" and "poor" outcome patients with respect to 
demographics or surgical parameters (levels fused, surgical approach, 
decompression, osteotomy, all p>.050).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show each CD patient's unique deformity 
must be carefully examined in order to determine the appropriate alignment goals 
to achieve optimal HRQOLs. In particular, the recognition of the sagittal 
morphotype can help assist surgeons to aim for specific alignment goals for CT, 
FN and FD. Distinct deformity specific intra-operative goals include obtaining 
proper sagittal global/cervical alignment for cervicothoracic patients, 
correcting maximal focal kyphosis in focal deformity patients, and correcting 
horizontal gaze for flatneck patients.

BACKGROUND: Chronic stimulation of the thalamus is a surgical option in the 
management of intractable Holmes tremor. Patients with deep brain stimulation 
(DBS) can encounter infection as a postoperative complication, necessitating 
explantation of the hardware. Some studies have reported on the technique and 
the resulting efficacy of therapeutic lesioning through implanted DBS leads 
before their explantation.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a patient with Holmes tremor who had 
stable control of symptoms with DBS of the nucleus ventralis intermedius of the 
thalamus (VIM) but developed localized infection over the extension at the neck, 
followed by gradual loss of a therapeutic effect as the neurostimulator reached 
the end of its service life. Three courses of systemic antibiotic therapy failed 
to control the infection. After careful consideration, we decided to make a 
rescue lesion through the implanted lead in the right VIM before explanting the 
complete DBS hardware. The tremor was well controlled after the rescue lesion 
procedure, and the effect was sustained during a 2-year follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: This case and the previously discussed ones from the literature 
demonstrate that making a rescue lesion through the DBS lead can be the last 
plausible option in cases where the DBS system has to be explanted because of an 
infection and reimplantation is a remote possibility.

OBJECTIVE: Identify issues that are important to severe trauma survivors up to 3 
years after the trauma.
BACKGROUND: Severe trauma is the first cause of disability-adjusted life years 
worldwide, yet most attention has focused on acute care and the impact on 
long-term health is poorly evaluated.
METHOD: We conducted a large-scale qualitative study based on semi-structured 
phone interviews. Qualitative research methods involve the systematic 
collection, organization, and interpretation of conversations or textual data 
with patients to explore the meaning of a phenomenon experienced by individuals 
themselves. We randomly selected severe trauma survivors (abbreviated injury 
score ≥3 in at least 1 body region) who were receiving care in 6 urban academic 
level-I trauma centers in France between March 2015 and March 2018. We conducted 
double independent thematic analysis. Issues reported by patients were grouped 
into overarching domains by a panel of 5 experts in trauma care. Point of data 
saturation was estimated with a mathematical model.
RESULTS: We included 340 participants from 3 months to 3 years after the trauma 
[median age: 41 years (Q1-Q3 24-54), median injury severity score: 17 (Q1-Q3 
11-22)]. We identified 97 common issues that we grouped into 5 overarching 
domains: body and neurological issues (29 issues elicited by 277 participants), 
biographical disruption (23 issues, 210 participants), psychological and 
personality issues (21 issues, 147 participants), burden of treatment (14 
issues, 145 participants), and altered relationships (10 issues, 87 
participants). Time elapsed because the trauma, injury location, or in-hospital 
trauma severity did not affect the distribution of these domains across 
participants' answers.
CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study explored trauma survivors' experiences of 
the long-term effect of their injury and allowed for identifying a set of issues 
that they consider important, including dimensions that seem overlooked in 
trauma research. Our findings confirm that trauma is a chronic medical condition 
that demands new approaches to post-discharge and long-term care.
