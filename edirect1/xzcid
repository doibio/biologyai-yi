BACKGROUND: Paranasal sinus osteoma is a common, asymptomatic, histologically 
benign, slow-growing tumor. However, it can give rise to secondary pathologies 
such as a mucocele in about 50% of the cases. Rarely, intracranial and orbital 
extension is present, leading to rhinoliquorrhea, pneumocephalus, or neurologic 
and visual impairment, which might be potentially life-threatening.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old man presented with an acute frontal lobe 
syndrome and rhinoliquorrhea. Cranial magnetic resonance tomography showed a 
suspected frontoethmoidal osteoma with a mucocele expanding intradurally into 
the left frontal lobe. It was accompanied by pneumocephalus and showed 
communication with the left lateral ventricle. Through a bifrontal craniotomy, 
in toto resection of the frontoethmoidal bony tumor and the intradural mucocele 
was performed, while thereafter the frontal sinus was cranialized using a 
pedunculated periosteal flap. Postoperative recovery was uneventful with 
complete resolution of the tension pneumocephalus and rhinoliquorrhea and led to 
an improvement of the frontal lobe syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a rare case of pneumocephalus caused by a 
frontoethmoidal osteoma associated with an intradural mucocele. A review of the 
literature, focusing on the surgical strategies in such cases, is provided.

BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
developed a guideline on drug misuse prevention in vulnerable populations. Part 
of the guideline development process involved evaluating cost-effectiveness and 
determining which interventions represented good value for money.
METHODS: Economic models were developed for seven interventions which aimed to 
prevent drug use in vulnerable populations. The models compared the costs (to 
the health and crime sectors) and health benefits (in quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs)) of each intervention and its comparator. Sensitivity analysis 
explored the uncertainty associated with the cost of each intervention and 
duration of its effect.
RESULTS: The reduction in drug use for each intervention partly offset the costs 
of the intervention, and improved health outcomes (QALYs). However, with high 
intervention costs and low QALY gains, none of the interventions were estimated 
to be cost-effective in the base case. Sensitivity analysis found that some of 
the interventions could be cost-effective if they could be delivered at a lower 
cost, or if the effect could be sustained for more than two years.
CONCLUSIONS: For drug misuse prevention to be prioritised by funders, the 
consequences of drug misuse need to be understood, and interventions need to be 
shown to be effective and cost-effective. Quantifying the wider harms of drug 
misuse and wider benefits of prevention interventions poses challenges in 
evaluating the cost-effectiveness of drug misuse prevention interventions. A 
greater understanding of the consequences of drug misuse and causal factors 
could facilitate development of cost-effective interventions to prevent drug 
misuse.

Childhood maltreatment is a key predictor of mental health problems across the 
life span. Yet, how maltreatment types independently and jointly influence the 
risk for psychiatric problems remains unclear. The aim of the study was 
two-fold: first, to replicate recent findings regarding the impact of 
maltreatment types on youth psychiatric symptoms, based on a Brazilian sample of 
high-risk adolescents (n = 347; age range = 11-17 yrs), and second, to extend 
existing findings by examining whether this relationship is mediated by bullying 
victimization and/or perpetration. Measures included self-report ratings of 
childhood maltreatment and peer victimization, as well as multi-informant 
reports of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Consistent with prior 
research, we found that: (i) maltreatment types often co-occurred; (ii) there 
was a linear association between number of maltreatment types experienced and 
symptom severity (i.e. cumulative effect); and (iii) emotional abuse emerged as 
the most consistent independent predictor of poor mental health across domains, 
raters, and gender. Additionally, this study extends previous findings by 
showing that the influence of maltreatment on psychiatric outcomes is partially 
mediated by peer victimization, but not by bullying perpetration. In conclusion, 
these findings expand our understanding of the heterogeneity in individual 
responses to maltreatment as well as highlighting emotional abuse as an 
important predictor of poor mental health.

BACKGROUND: Differences in payer evaluation and coverage of pharmaceuticals and 
medical procedures suggest that coverage may differ for medications and 
procedures independent of their clinical benefit. We hypothesized that coverage 
for medications is more restricted than corresponding coverage for nonmedication 
interventions.
METHODS: We included top-selling medications and highly utilized procedures. For 
each intervention-indication pair, we classified value in terms of 
cost-effectiveness (incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year), as 
reported by the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry. For 
each intervention-indication pair and for each of 10 large payers, we classified 
coverage, when available, as either "more restrictive" or as "not more 
restrictive," compared with a benchmark. The benchmark reflected the US Food and 
Drug Administration label information, when available, or pertinent clinical 
guidelines. We compared coverage policies and the benchmark in terms of step 
edits and clinical restrictions. Finally, we regressed coverage restrictiveness 
against intervention type (medication or nonmedication), controlling for value 
(cost-effectiveness more or less favorable than a designated threshold).
RESULTS: We identified 392 medication and 185 procedure coverage decisions. A 
total of 26.3% of the medication coverage and 38.4% of the procedure coverage 
decisions were more restrictive than their corresponding benchmarks. After 
controlling for value, the odds of being more restrictive were 42% lower for 
medications than for procedures. Including unfavorable tier placement in the 
definition of "more restrictive" greatly increased the proportion of medication 
coverage decisions classified as "more restrictive" and reversed our findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Therapy access depends on factors other than cost and clinical 
benefit, suggesting potential health care system inefficiency.

BACKGROUND: Heroin overdose is a major cause of premature death. Naloxone is an 
opioid antagonist that is effective for the reversal of heroin overdose in 
emergency situations and can be used by nonmedical responders.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of distributing naloxone 
to adults at risk of heroin overdose for use by nonmedical responders compared 
with no naloxone distribution in a European healthcare setting (United Kingdom).
METHODS: A Markov model with an integrated decision tree was developed based on 
an existing model, using UK data where available. We evaluated an intramuscular 
naloxone distribution reaching 30% of heroin users. Costs and effects were 
evaluated over a lifetime and discounted at 3.5%. The results were assessed 
using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The model estimated that distribution of intramuscular naloxone, would 
decrease overdose deaths by around 6.6%. In a population of 200,000 heroin users 
this equates to the prevention of 2,500 premature deaths at an incremental cost 
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of £899. The sensitivity analyses 
confirmed the robustness of the results.
CONCLUSIONS: Our evaluation suggests that the distribution of take-home naloxone 
decreased overdose deaths by around 6.6% and was cost-effective with an 
incremental cost per QALY gained well below a £20,000 willingness-to-pay 
threshold set by UK decision-makers. The model code has been made available to 
aid future research. Further study is warranted on the impact of different 
formulations of naloxone on cost-effectiveness and the impact take-home naloxone 
has on the wider society.

BACKGROUND: For many countries, the three-level EuroQol five-dimensional 
questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) value sets have been established to estimate health 
state utilities. To generate these value sets, researchers first collect values 
for a subset of preselected health states from a panel representing the general 
public, and then use a prediction algorithm to generate values for all 243 
states. High prevalence of a health state in daily practice has historically 
been a key criterion in selecting a subset of health states as the observed set. 
More recently, other criteria have been suggested, especially approaches based 
on statistical criteria such as randomization and orthogonality.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the validity and accuracy of both the earlier and newer 
criteria, in terms of prediction of values for all the health states and of the 
values of common health states in particular.
METHODS: We used a pre-existing data set that contained visual analogue scale 
values from 126 students, each of whom valued all 243 EQ-5D-3L states. Then, we 
generated a series of designs and subsequently modeled the data with respect to 
each design. Some of these designs were used in the past; for example, the 
Measurement and Valuation of Health approach was included. Others were newly 
generated. The performance of different designs was evaluated in terms of the 
lowest root mean squared error for all health states taken together, and 
separately for common and rare states. Classification as common or rare was 
based on the frequency of the states' occurrence in three patient and population 
data sets pooled together (N = 5269).
RESULTS: The orthogonal design with 54 health states produced the lowest root 
mean squared errors. Over-representation of common health states in a design did 
not improve the estimations for these states. The published designs performed 
the worst, whereas the random selection designs were good on average. 
Nevertheless, the performance of the random selection designs showed more 
variance compared with orthogonal designs, because some of the former designs 
did not display appropriate balance.
CONCLUSIONS: The published designs gave rise to large estimation errors for the 
extrapolated EQ-5D-3L health states. The orthogonal design focusing on 
statistical efficiency showed its superiority. Overall, when weighing up design 
properties, increased statistical efficiency outweighs an increased error rate, 
if any, in rare health states.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Teleophthalmology is well positioned to play a key role in 
screening of major chronic eye diseases. Economic evaluation of 
cost-effectiveness of teleophthalmology, however, is lacking. This study 
provides a systematic review of economic studies of teleophthalmology screening 
for diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma and macular degeneration.
METHODS: Structured search of electronic databases and full article review 
yielded 20 cost-related articles. Sixteen articles fulfilled the inclusion 
criteria and were retained for a narrative review: 12 on DR, 2 on glaucoma and 2 
on chronic eye disease.
RESULTS: Teleophthalmology for DR yielded the most cost savings when compared 
with traditional clinic examination. The study settings varied among urban, 
rural and remote settings, community, hospital and health mobile units. The most 
important determinant of cost-effectiveness of teleophthalmology was the 
prevalence of DR among patients screened, indicating an increase of cost savings 
with the increase of screening rates. The required patient pool size to be 
screened varied from 110 to 3500 patients. Other factors potentially influencing 
cost-effectiveness of teleophthalmology were older patient age, regular 
screening and full utilisation of the equipment. Teleophthalmology for glaucoma 
was more cost-effective compared with in-person examination. Similarly, 
increasing number of glaucoma patients targeted for screening yielded more cost 
savings.
CONCLUSIONS: This economic review provides supportive evidence of 
cost-effectiveness of teleophthalmology for DR and glaucoma screening 
potentially increasing screening accessibility especially for rural and remote 
populations. Special selection of the targeted screening population will 
optimise the cost-effectiveness of teleophthalmology.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcome of low risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients who 
were candidates for active surveillance (AS) but had undergone robot-assisted 
radical prostatectomy (RARP).
METHOD: We reviewed our prospectively collected database of patients operated by 
RARP between 2006 and 2014. Low D'Amico risk patients were selected. Oncological 
outcomes were reported based on pathology results and biochemical failure. 
Functional outcomes on continence and potency were reported at 12 and 24 months. 
Continence was assessed by the number of pads per day. With respect to potency, 
it was assessed using the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) and Erectile 
Hardness Scale (EHS).
RESULTS: Out of 812 patients, 237 (29.2%) patients were D'Amico low risk and 
were eligible for analysis. 44 men fit Epstein's criteria. 134 (56.5%) men had 
pathological upgrading. Age and clinical stage were predictors of upgrading on 
multivariate analysis. 220 (92.8%) patients had available follow-up for 
biochemical recurrence, potency, and continence for 2 years. The mean and median 
follow-up was 34.8 and 31.4 months, respectively. Only 5 (2.3%) men developed 
BCR, all of whom had pathological upgrading. Extra capsular extension and 
positive surgical margins were observed in 14.8 and 19.1%, respectively. 0 pad 
was achieved in 86.7 and 88.9% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Proportion of 
patients with SHIM > 21 at 1 and 2 years was 24.8 and 30.6%, respectively. 
Moreover, patients having erections adequate for intercourse (EHS ≥ 3) were seen 
in 69.6 and 83.1% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Functional outcomes of 
patients fitting Epstein's criteria (n = 44) and patients with no upgrading on 
final pathology (n = 103) were not significantly different compared to the 
overall low risk study group.
CONCLUSION: This retrospective study showed that RARP is not without harm even 
in patients with low risk disease. On the other hand, considerable rate of 
upgrading was noted.

Stroke is an important cause of seizures and epilepsy in adults, particularly 
among the elderly. The incidence of stroke increases yearly as life expectancy 
increases and the number of patients with post-stroke seizures and epilepsy is 
also rising. Post-stroke epilepsy accounts for nearly 50% of newly diagnosed 
epilepsy among patients over 60 years of age. With increasing stroke awareness 
and advanced treatments, increased attention is paid to post-stroke seizures and 
epilepsy including its diagnosis and treatment. There has been a plethora of 
research on the pathogenesis of seizures and epilepsy after stroke. And thus, 
the research advances in the pathogenesis and related therapeutic targets of 
post-stroke seizures and epilepsy will be reviewed in this article.

To examine change from 1991 to 2001 in disability-free life expectancy in the 
age range 60-90 by gender, race, and education in the United States. Mortality 
is estimated over two 10-year follow-up periods for persons in the National 
Health Interview Surveys of 1986/1987 and 1996/1997. Vital status is ascertained 
through the National Death Index. Disability prevalence is estimated from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys of 1988-1994 and 1999-2002. 
Disability is defined as ability to perform four activities of daily living 
without difficulty. Disability-free life expectancy increased only among white 
men. Disabled life expectancy increased for all groups-black and white men and 
women. Racial differences in disability-free life expectancy widened among men; 
gender differences were reduced among whites. Expansion of socioeconomic 
differentials in disability-free life at older ages occurred among white men and 
women and black women. The 1990s was a period where the increased years of life 
between ages 60 and 90 were concentrated in disabled years for most population 
groups.

BACKGROUND: In Finland, selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) is at 
present the preferred first-line loco-regional therapy for uveal melanoma 
patients with hepatic metastases not suitable for surgery. We retrospectively 
evaluate the outcome and safety of SIRT in this group of patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Yttrium-90 microspheres were delivered via the hepatic 
artery into the circulation of metastases from uveal melanoma in 18 patients 
with a predicted life expectancy of more than three months in three Finnish 
tertiary referral centers between November 2010 and December 2015. 
Progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity and overall survival (OS) were 
evaluated. Patients with historical uveal melanoma without extrahepatic 
metastases, who had received systemic chemotherapy as first-line treatment for 
their hepatic metastases at the Helsinki University Hospital between January 
2006 and May 2010, were used as a historical control group.
RESULTS: Partial response and stable disease were observed in three (17%) and 
eight (44%) patients, respectively; one patient was not evaluable for response. 
Median PFS after SIRT was 5.6 (range, 1.3-40.8) months. Median OS after SIRT was 
13.5 (range, 3.6-44.8) months compared with 10.5 (range, 3.0-16.5; p = .047) 
months for the historical chemotherapy group. Among patients who received SIRT 
as first-line treatment, the median OS was 18.7 (range, 8.2-44.8) months, 
significantly longer than that of the chemotherapy group (10.5 months, 
p = .017). There were no treatment-related deaths. Toxicity was mainly WHO grade 
1-2 and self-limited.
CONCLUSION: SIRT is a feasible and safe treatment for liver metastases in 
patients with uveal melanoma.

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to explore the patterns of the coronary heart disease 
(CHD) mortality rates over the past almost 50 years (1968-2014) in the Czech 
Republic, and to predict the mortality rates in 2015-2019.
METHODS: The number of deaths from CHD and the population size were stratified 
by sex and age. The mortality rates were age-standardized to European 
population. Their values in 2015-2019 were estimated using the joinpoint 
log-linear regression, local log-linear regression and negative binomial 
log-linear regression, separately for males and females.
RESULTS: A positive change in the trend of the age-standardized mortality rates 
from CHD was detected after the collapse of communism in 1989. In 1991-2000, the 
mortality trend was sharply downward, with an annual percent change of -5.8 % 
for males and -5.2 % for females. In 2000-2014, the decreasing trend was not so 
sharp (-1.3 % for males and -0.7% for females), yet it should continue in 
2015-2019. The crude mortality rates for females are slightly higher than those 
for males since 2007, however, they are increasing for both sexes. The mortality 
rates are rising mainly in the age group of 85+ years (in 2014, 25.4% of CHD 
deaths of males and 54.4% of females occurred at the age of 85+ years).
CONCLUSIONS: The age-standardized mortality rates are predicted to decrease in 
2015-2019, but the crude mortality rates should increase due to increase in 
average life expectancy. The burden of deaths is moving to the age group of 85 
years and older, mainly in females. A total of 26,039 CHD deaths were registered 
in the Czech Republic in 2014, and 29,653 are predicted for 2019, if the current 
trends continue.

The giant African snail Lissachatina fulica has been reported invading Cuba 
since 2014 and is now well established in areas of Havana and several nearby 
regions. This invasive species is of major concern to health authorities given 
its role as an important vector of parasites such as Angiostrongylus 
cantonensis, the causative agent of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis in humans. 
Here, we update the distribution within Cuba. We also report on our studies of 
experimental life-history traits to assess the population dynamics and potential 
for spread of this species in Cuba. The experimental population had a very low 
probability of dying at first age intervals (Type I survival curve) with a life 
expectancy of 71 weeks. During our experiment, sexual maturity was reached after 
22 weeks (individuals of 70 mm shell length) and eggs were laid regularly (mean 
batch size: 188 ± 111.79 SD). We failed to detect any deviations from the 
mortality curve and individuals reached an average of 77.3 mm (shell length) and 
weighted 57.7 g after one year. Predicted curve models indicate that snails 
reaching their average lifespan of five years should attain 10-12 cm (shell 
length) and weight 160 g. The spreading of this invasive and vector snail has 
been tracked for four years in Cuba showing a steady increase of invaded 
localities. How fast and how far this species develops in Cuba is unknown but 
the life history parameters indicated in this paper show that it has a large 
potential to invade all areas of Cuba quickly unless a systematic abatement 
strategy is developed.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Unclear reimbursement for new and innovative endoscopic 
procedures can limit adoption in clinical practice despite effectiveness in 
clinical trials. The aim of this study was to determine maximum cost-effective 
reimbursement for per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) in treating achalasia.
METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic model assessing POEM versus 
laparoscopic Heller myotomy with Dor fundoplication (LHM) in managing achalasia 
from a payer perspective over a 1-year time horizon. Reimbursement data were 
derived from 2017 Medicare data. Responder rates were based on clinically 
meaningful improvement in validated Eckardt scores. Validated health utility 
values were assigned to terminal health states based on data previously derived 
with a standard gamble technique. Contemporary willingness-to-pay (WTP) levels 
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were used to estimate maximum 
reimbursement for POEM using threshold analysis.
RESULTS: Effectiveness of POEM and LHM was similar at 1 year of follow-up (0.91 
QALY). Maximum cost-effective reimbursement for POEM was $8033.37 to $8223.14, 
including all professional and facility fees. This compares favorably with 
contemporary total reimbursement of 10 to 15 total relative value units for 
advanced endoscopic procedures. Rates of postprocedural GERD did not affect the 
preference for POEM compared with LHM, assuming at least 10% cost savings with 
POEM compared with LHM in cost-minimization analysis, or at least 44% cost 
savings in cost-effectiveness analysis (WTP = $100,000/QALY). LHM was only 
preferred over POEM if both procedures were reimbursed similarly, and these 
findings were primarily driven by lower rates of postprocedural GERD. The rate 
of conversion to open laparotomy due to perforation or bleeding was infrequent 
in published clinical practice experience, thus did not significantly affect 
reimbursement.
DISCUSSION: POEM is an example of an innovative and potentially disruptive 
endoscopic technique offering greater cost-effective value and similar outcomes 
to the established surgical standard at contemporary reimbursement levels.

OBJECTIVES: Sexual dysfunction (SD) has been shown to be more prevalent among 
females with epilepsy (FWE) when compared with controls. Identified risk factors 
for SD among FWE include depression, antiepileptic drug (AED) type, epileptic 
lateralization, and temporal lobe involvement. Despite a huge population of FWE 
in sub-Saharan Africa and by extension Nigeria, there are limited studies on the 
effect of AEDs and epilepsy on sexual function among FWE in the region. We 
therefore studied predictors and patterns of SD among Nigerian FWE.
METHOD: This was a descriptive study carried out at the University College 
Hospital, Oyo State - a tertiary hospital in South-Western Nigeria. The Zung 
Self-rating Depression Scale was used to assess mood. Sexual dysfunction was 
measured using the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) questionnaire.
RESULTS: The frequency of clinically significant SD among FWE (35, 50.0%) was 
similar to that of controls (27, 38.6%; p = 0.173). However, the mean ASEX score 
was higher in FWE than in controls (p = 0.009). Using domains defined by the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th Edition (DSM-V), we 
observed that FWE had higher scores in all domains. Sexual dysfunction was also 
more prevalent among FWE with lesional epilepsy when compared with those with 
nonlesional epilepsy. Standardized beta coefficients from multiple regressions 
conducted suggest that age of FWE, the presence of motor weakness, and systolic 
blood pressure contributed to SD.
SIGNIFICANCE: Females with epilepsy had higher ASEX scores in all domains, with 
older FWE and those with lesional epilepsy more likely to have SD. Healthcare 
providers should pay attention to SD among FWE for improved quality of life.

High seroprevalence estimates of brucellosis in livestock species and humans in 
India suggest that the disease is a significant public health concern in the 
country. We developed an economic model and conducted an assessment of the 
impact of human brucellosis in India to describe the current situation to help 
formulate prevention and control strategies. Economic losses of human 
brucellosis were calculated based on the official records and the data from 
epidemiological surveys conducted in India. These data were used to estimate the 
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) due to human brucellosis. Uncertainty was 
incorporated in the model by applying probability distributions for certain 
input parameters. The analyses were further supplemented by conducting 
sensitivity analyses to determine which parameters had the biggest influence on 
the outcome of economic losses. The annual median losses due to human 
brucellosis were estimated to be Rs 627.5 million (uncertainty interval [95% UI] 
Rs 534.8-741.2 million; US $ 10.46 million) with a loss of Rs 442.3 million (95% 
UI 371.0-516.0; US $ 7.37 million) among adults and Rs 185.0 million (95% UI 
124.0-255.0; US $ 3.08 million) among children. Human brucellosis in India 
caused a loss of 177 601 (95% UI 152 695-214 764) DALYs at the rate of 0.15 (95% 
UI 0.13-0.17) DALYs per thousand persons per year. The DALYs were found to be 
0.29 (95% UI 0.08-0.70) per thousand persons per year in occupational and 0.13 
(95% UI 0.06-0.18) in non-occupational adult population. This is the first 
systematic analysis of the health impact of human brucellosis in India and of 
indirect/production losses occurring due to human brucellosis anywhere in the 
world. The results indicate that brucellosis causes considerable economic losses 
and has a reasonable health impact, particularly among occupational groups. 
Intervention policies need to be strengthened to reduce the socio-economic 
impact of human brucellosis in India.

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether certain foot/ankle 
surgeries would benefit from the routine use of low-molecular-weight heparin 
(LMWH) as postoperative deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. We conducted a 
formal cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytic tree to explore the 
healthcare costs and health outcomes associated with a scenario of no 
prophylaxis and a scenario of routine LMWH prophylaxis for 4 weeks. The 2 
scenarios were compared for 5 procedures: (1) Achilles tendon repair (ATR), (2) 
total ankle arthroplasty (TAA), (3) hallux valgus surgery (HVS), (4) hindfoot 
arthrodesis (HA), and (5) ankle fracture surgery (AFS). The outcomes assessed 
included short- and long-term costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost per QALY gained. The costs were evaluated from the healthcare 
system perspective and are expressed in U.S. dollars at a 2015 price base. In 
the short term, routine prophylaxis was always associated with greater costs 
compared with no prophylaxis. For ATR, TAA, HA, and AFS, prophylaxis was 
associated with slightly better health outcomes; however, the gain in QALYs was 
minimal compared with the cost of prophylaxis (incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio well above $50,000/QALY threshold). For HVS, prophylaxis was associated 
with both worse health outcomes and greater costs. In the long term, routine 
prophylaxis was always associated with worse health outcomes and either cost 
more (HA, AFS, HVS) or saved very little (ATR, TAA). We concluded that policies 
encouraging the routine use of LMWH after foot/ankle surgery are unlikely to be 
cost-effective. Decisions to perform prophylaxis should be on a case-by-case 
basis and should emphasize individual patient risk factors.

Improved living conditions and advances in medicine have extended life 
expectancy and quality of life, resulting in an increasing number of elderly 
travellers. Pathophysiological changes and treatments can reduce the efficacy of 
vaccines and facilitate drug interactions. Elderly travellers have various 
characteristics that should be considered when offering pre-trip counselling, 
which should include proper management of chronic diseases that are susceptible 
to worsening during the trip, as well as an appropriate study and follow-up 
after the trip. We performed a narrative review of the main problems of elderly 
travellers.

OBJECTIVE: To break new ground by directly examining how patients seek 
life-expectancy estimates, and how doctors support them in doing so.
METHODS: Conversation analytic examination of 10 recorded UK hospice 
consultations involving 3 palliative specialists.
RESULTS: Life-expectancy estimate episodes frequently begin after a doctor has 
given a patient an opportunity to shape the consultation agenda. Rather than 
posing direct questions, patients cautiously display their interest in receiving 
an estimate using statements. These often contain preparatory information about: 
what they already know about their prognosis, their perspective on it, and 
readiness to hear more. When patients do not provide this information, doctors 
invite it before giving an estimate. Patients' companions also contribute to 
this preparatory work.
CONCLUSION: Doctors, patients, and companions collaboratively work to prepare a 
conversational environment wherein emotional states and uncertainties have been 
addressed prior to delivery of the actual estimate. This helps manage both 
possible emotional distress, and prognostic uncertainty entailed in seeking and 
delivering estimates.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians should be mindful that rather than overtly 
requesting estimates, patients may seek them more cautiously. Before delivering 
estimates, doctors can support patients to articulate their existing 
understanding and perspective regarding prognosis, and their readiness to hear 
more.

OBJECTIVE: A new opportunistic community-based strategy was launched in Japan in 
April 2014 to detect lifestyle-related diseases, including diabetes, by creating 
Specimen Measurement Offices (SMOs). SMOs offer walk-in fingertip HbA1c testing. 
This article aimed to assess the value-for-money of HbA1c testing services at 
SMOs by conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared two scenarios: 1) status quo, defined 
as HbA1c testing that is available only through conventional screening, and 2) 
HbA1c testing available at SMOs as a complement to the status quo scenario. The 
model consisted of a screening module with a decision tree and a disease 
progression module with a Markov model. We calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (i.e., cost per quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) 
over the lifetime analytic horizon as the primary end point of the 
cost-effectiveness analysis. In this model, we assumed the participant cohort to 
be people 40-74 years of age who sought walk-in fingertip HbA1c testing at SMOs 
on the premises of community pharmacies. Costs and outcomes were discounted at a 
rate of 3%. The cost-effectiveness was analyzed from a societal perspective.
RESULTS: The incremental cost per individual for those 40-74 years of age was 
estimated to be -527 U.S. dollars (USD) (-52,722 Japanese yen [JPY]) for HbA1c 
testing at SMOs compared with the status quo. Incremental effectiveness was 
estimated to be 0.0203 QALYs for HbA1c testing at SMOs compared with the status 
quo. Therefore, this cost-effectiveness analysis showed that compared with the 
status quo, HbA1c testing at SMOs was more effective and had lower cost for the 
population studied.
CONCLUSIONS: We consider our results to be robust because most simulations were 
under the threshold of USD 50,000 (JPY 5,000,000) per QALYs gained, by 
sensitivity analysis. These results will be useful to managers of pharmacies or 
other health institutions and/or policy makers in local government.

Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are the largest family of proteins in plants and 
are responsible for perceiving the vast majority of extracellular stimuli. Thus, 
RLKs function in diverse processes, including sensing pathogen attacks, 
regulating symbiotic interactions, transducing hormone and peptide signals, and 
monitoring cell wall status. However, despite their fundamental role in plant 
biology, very few antibodies are available against RLKs, which necessitates the 
use of epitope tags and fluorescent protein fusions in biochemical analyses such 
as immunoblot analysis and intracellular visualization. Epitope tags are widely 
used and are typically assumed to be benign, with no influence on protein 
function. FLAGELLIN SENSITIVE2 (FLS2) is the receptor for bacterial flagellin 
and often is used as a model for RLK function. Previous work implies that 
carboxyl-terminal epitope fusions to FLS2 maintain protein function. Here, a 
detailed complementation analysis of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) fls2
