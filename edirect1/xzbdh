damage, and those with ESRD were 4.8 (95% CI 2.8-7.5), 9.0 (95% CI 6.7-11.9), 
9.8 (95% CI 6.5-14.1), 6.1 (95% CI 2.0-14.1), 14.0 (95% CI 9.1-20.5), and 63.1 
(95% CI 33.6-108.0), respectively. The life expectancy of SLE patients with 
renal disease and those with renal damage was reduced by 15.1 years and 23.7 
years, respectively, compared to the general population.
CONCLUSION: The presence of renal disease, in particular proliferative nephritis 
causing renal insufficiency, significantly reduces the survival and life 
expectancy of SLE patients.

INTRODUCTION: Vertebral metastases are associated with significant pain, 
disability, and morbidity. Open surgery for fracture stabilization is often 
inappropriate in this population due to a poor risk-benefit profile, 
particularly if life expectancy is short. Percutaneous vertebroplasty and 
kyphoplasty are appealing adjunctive procedures in patients with malignancy for 
alleviation of intractable pain. However, these patients have higher risk of 
serious complications, notably cement extravasation. Described in this report is 
a case of a painful osteolytic vertebral metastasis that was successfully 
treated by a novel percutaneous vertebral augmentation system.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old Caucasian female presented with a history of 
metastatic lung cancer unresponsive to radiation and chemotherapy with symptoms 
inadequately controlled by opiates over the previous 6 months. Magnetic 
resonance imaging and spiral computed tomography with two-dimensional 
reconstruction showed an osteolytic vertebral metastasis with complete 
involvement of the T10 vertebral body, extending to the cortical vertebral wall 
anteriorly and posteriorly. The patient was treated with percutaneous vertebral 
augmentation (Kiva® VCF Treatment System, Benvenue Medical, Inc, Santa Clara, 
CA) utilizing a novel coil-shaped polyetheretherketone implant designed to 
minimize the risk of cement extravasation. After the minimally invasive 
procedure, bone cement distribution within the vertebral body was ideal, with no 
observed cement extravasation. No complications were reported, pain completely 
resolved within 24 hours, and use of intravenous narcotics was progressively 
diminished within 1 week. Complete pain relief was maintained throughout 4 
months of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The Kiva System represents a novel and effective minimally invasive 
treatment option for patients suffering from severe pain due to osteolytic 
vertebral metastasis.

Juvenile hormone and insulin regulate trehalose homeostasis in the red flour 
beetle, Tribolium castaneum.

Lexington, KY, USA.

Insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) has been well studied for its role in the control 
of life span extension and resistance to a variety of stresses. The Drosophila 
melanogaster insulin-like receptor (InR) mutant showed extended life span due to 
reduced juvenile hormone (JH) levels. However, little is known about the 
mechanism of cross talk between IIS and JH in regulation of life span extension 
and resistance to starvation. In the current study, we investigated the role of 
IIS and JH signaling in regulation of resistance to starvation. Reduction in JH 
biosynthesis, JH action, or insulin-like peptide 2 (ILP2) syntheses by RNA 
interference (RNAi)-aided knockdown in the expression of genes coding for 
juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase (JHAMT), methoprene-tolerant (Met), or 
ILP2 respectively decreased lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and extended the 
survival of starved beetles. Interestingly, the extension of life span could be 
restored by injection of bovine insulin into JHAMT RNAi beetles but not by 
application of JH III to ILP2 RNAi beetles. These data suggest that JH controls 
starvation resistance by regulating synthesis of ILP2. More importantly, JH 
regulates trehalose homeostasis, including trehalose transport and metabolism, 
and controls utilization of stored nutrients in starved adults.

[Association between 242C > T polymorphism of NADPH oxidase p22phox gene (CYBA) 
and longevity in Russian population].

[Article in Russian]

Voevoda MI, Puzyrev.

Life span depends on many factors, including the level of reactive oxygen 
species, like superoxide radical. Superoxide radical is produced from oxygen in 
the course of the oxidation of NADPH to NADP+. The process is catalyzed by NADPH 
oxidase. In this study, genotype and allele distributions of the C242T 
polymorphism in the CYBA gene, which encodes the alpha subunit ofNADPH oxidase 
(p22phox), were examined in the sample of long livers and in the population 
sample of the city of Tomsk. Statistically significantly higher frequency of T 
allele among female long livers (34.62%), compared to the females from Russian 
population (26.32%) was demonstrated (chi2 = 5.226; p = 0.022; OR = 1.48). Thus, 
the T allele is associated with a high life expectancy in females from the 
Russian population. No such association was observed for males from the same 
population.

BACKGROUND: Developed countries are facing a sustained increase in life 
expectancy. Along with all social and cultural implications of increase 
lifespan, very elderly patients are undergoing percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) with increasing frequency. However, there is limited evidence 
to guide clinicians in evaluating pros and cons of PCI in this very frail 
patient population. We, thus, aimed to perform a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of clinical studies reporting on PCI with stenting in 
nonagenarians.
METHODS: Studies reporting on five or more nonagenarians undergoing PCI were 
systematically searched in PubMed (last updated on November 2011). Baseline and 
clinical characteristics, in-hospital and long-term outcomes were systematically 
appraised. End points of interest were in-hospital and long-term follow-up 
incidence of death and Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE; i.e. the composite of 
death from all causes, myocardial infarction or repeat revascularization). 
Events were pooled with a random-effect model, generating summary estimates of 
incidence rates [95% confidence intervals (CI)].
RESULTS: A total of 10 studies were included, reporting on a total of 575 
nonagenarians undergoing PCI with stenting who represented 1.99% (1.34-2.5) of 
those undergoing revascularization in the cath lab in a mean period of 5 (3-7) 
years. Twenty-three percent (13-45) of patients presented with STEMI (ST Segment 
Elevation Myocardial Infarction), 10% (7-12) with cardiogenic shock and in 78% 
(64-88) of cases a multivessel disease was diagnosed. Meta-analytic pooling of 
event rates showed an in-hospital death risk of 12.61% (9.71-15.50) with MACE in 
16.41% (13.36-19.47). After a follow-up ranging from 6 to 29 months (median 12), 
the risk of long-term death was 31.00% (17.10-45.52), with MACE in 37.00% 
(19.56-55.95; all CI 95%).
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis, pooling the largest cohort ever of nonagenarians 
undergoing PCI with stents, confirms the feasibility of percutaneous coronary 
stenting even in this very frail patient subset, despite the expected severe 
event attrition during follow-up. Thus, nonagenarians with an acceptable risk 
profile, recent clinical instability and/or disabling symptoms should not be 
denied the possibility of percutaneous coronary revascularization.

The changing face of the 'royal disease'--medicolegal aspects of haemophilia.

Byard RW(1).

Australia, Australia. roger.byard@sa.gov.au

Haemophilia represents a group of heritable disorders caused by deficiencies in 
plasma proteins that are involved in coagulation. The case of a two-year-old boy 
with an established diagnosis of haemophilia B is reported to demonstrate a rare 
cause of unexpected death. He had a recent history of epistaxis and was found 
unexpectedly dead. At autopsy the posterior pharynx was obstructed by blood clot 
with aspirated blood within the distal airways of the lungs, and melena 
throughout both small and large intestines. His death was due to haemorrhage and 
airway obstruction complicating epistaxis. The profile of individuals with 
haemophilia has been changing in recent years with less deaths from haemorrhage 
due to improved clinical management. As the life expectancy of these patients is 
increasing, forensic examiners will now have to consider not only possible 
haemorrhagic causes of death but will also have to determine the significance of 
more long standing infectious processes related to human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) and hepatitis C from contaminated transfusions, in addition to evaluating 
the role of the more usual diseases related to age.

about risk factors.

Incidence of dementia increases sharply with age and, because of the increase in 
life expectancy, the number of dementia cases is expected to rise dramatically 
over time. Some studies suggest that controlling some modifiable risk factors 
for dementia like diabetes or hypertension could lower its incidence. However, 
as treating these vascular factors would also reduce mortality risk, the actual 
impact of such public-health intervention on dementia prevalence is not known. 
Accounting for the impact of dementia and risk factors on mortality, the aim of 
this work was (1) to compute projections of age- and-sex specific prevalence of 
dementia in France from 2010 to 2030, (2) to evaluate how public-health 
interventions targeting risk factors for dementia could change these 
projections. Age-and-sex specific incidence of dementia and mortality of 
demented subjects were estimated from the Paquid population-based cohort using a 
semi-parametric illness-death model. Future global mortality rates and 
population sizes were obtained from national demographic projections. Under the 
assumption that life expectancy will increase by 3.5 years for men and 2.8 years 
for women by 2030, the number of subjects with dementia was estimated to 
increase by about 75% from 2010 to 2030 with a 200% increase after 90 years of 
age. Therapeutic intervention on the whole population reducing high blood 
pressure prevalence would lead to a decrease in both dementia incidence rates 
and mortality and would have a modest impact on the number of dementia cases. On 
the other hand, a preventive dementia treatment targeting ApoE4 carriers would 
probably not improve survival and hence would decrease dementia prevalence by 
15-25%.

Late complications related to palliative stenting in patients with obstructing 
colorectal cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Self-expanding metal stents (SEMSs) are increasingly used for the 
palliative treatment of incurable obstructing colorectal cancer. The aim of the 
current study was to evaluate clinical outcome, including technical and clinical 
success of stenting, and to identify factors associated with late complications 
of SEMS in palliation of incurable obstructing colorectal cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2003 and 2010 details of 56 patients who underwent 
an attempt of SEMS insertion for obstructive incurable colorectal cancer at 
Turku University Hospital were recorded to our database prospectively and 
analyzed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 42 patients (75%) and clinical 
success in 39 patients (70%). Late complications related to SEMS occurred in 13 
patients (31%). Ten patients (24%) needed re-intervention because of a 
complication: Eight ostomies, one Hartmann´s procedure due to late perforation 
and one re-stenting because of stent migration. Three patients with 
stent-related complications were treated conservatively. Chemotherapy and 
prolonged survival were risk factors for SEMS-related late complications and 
re-intervention.
CONCLUSION: SEMS insertion is a feasible procedure for the palliative treatment 
of obstructing colorectal cancer in patients with severe comorbidities and short 
life expectancy. However, for patients who are candidates for chemotherapy and 
have a longer life expectancy, other treatment options such as palliative tumor 
resection should also be considered.

BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of a reluctance to allocate health care 
solely on the basis of maximizing quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Stated 
preference methods can be used to elicit preferences for efficiency vs. equity 
in the allocation of health-care resources.
OBJECTIVE: To compare discrete choice experiment (DCE) and constant-sum paired 
comparison (CSPC) methods for eliciting societal preferences.
METHODS: Over a series of choice pairs, DCE respondents allocated a fixed budget 
to one preferred group and CSPC respondents allocated budget percentages between 
the groups. Questionnaires were compared in terms of completion rates, 
preference consistency, dominant preferences and derived attribute importance.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the proportions that rated the 
questionnaires somewhat or extremely difficult, but a significantly greater 
proportion completed the DCE compared to the CSPC. Preference consistency was 
also higher in the DCE. The incidence of dominant preferences, including for 
aggregate QALYs, was low and not significantly different between questionnaires. 
Similarly, no CSCP respondents equalized budgets or outcomes in every task. 
Final health state was the most important attribute in both questionnaires, but 
the rankings diverged for the other attributes. Notably, the total patients' 
treated attribute was important in the CSPC but insignificant in the DCE, 
perhaps reflecting a 'prominence effect'.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite lower completion rates and preference consistency, CSPC may 
offer advantages over DCE in eliciting preferences over the distribution of 
resources and/or outcomes as well as attribute levels, avoiding extreme 
'all-or-nothing' distributions and possibly aligning respondent attention more 
closely with a societal perspective.

Netherlands. c.dirksen@mumc.nl

BACKGROUND: Despite a strong movement towards active patient involvement in 
healthcare policy decisions, systematic and explicit consideration of evidence 
of this research on patient preferences seems limited. Furthermore, little is 
known about the opinions of several stakeholders towards consideration of 
research evidence on patient preferences in healthcare policy decisions. This 
paper describes the protocol for an explorative study on the integration of 
research on patient preferences in healthcare policy decisions. The study 
questions: to what extent research evidence on patient preferences is considered 
in current procedures for healthcare policy decisions; opinions of stakeholders 
regarding the integration of this type of evidence in healthcare policy 
decisions; and what could be a decision framework for the integration of such 
research evidence in healthcare policy decisions.
METHODS/DESIGN: The study is divided in three sub-studies, predominantly using 
qualitative methods. The first sub-study is a scoping review in five European 
countries to investigate whether and how results of research on patient 
preferences are considered in current procedures for coverage decisions and 
clinical practice guideline development. The second sub-study is a qualitative 
study to explore the opinions of stakeholders with regard to the possibilities 
for integrating evidence on patient preferences in the process of healthcare 
decision-making in the Netherlands. The third sub-study is the development of a 
decision framework for research on patient preferences. The framework will 
consist of: a process description regarding the place of evidence on patient 
preferences in the decision-making process; and a taxonomy describing different 
terminologies and conceptualisations of 'preferences' and an overview of 
existing methodologies for investigating preferences. The concept framework will 
be presented to and discussed with experts.
DISCUSSION: This study will create awareness regarding the existence and 
potential value of research evidence on patient preferences for healthcare 
policy decision-making and provides insight in the methods for investigating 
patient preferences and the barriers and facilitators for integration of such 
research in healthcare policy decisions. Results of the study will be useful for 
researchers, clinical practice guideline developers, healthcare policy makers, 
and patient representatives.

Prevention, Beijing 100013, China.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the change of life expectancy and the impact of mortality 
by age and causes of death on this issue among permanent residents of Beijing.
METHODS: Abridged Life Table and Arriaga method were used to calculate and to 
decompose the changes on life expectancy by age and causes of death in 2000 - 
2010.
RESULTS: From 2000 - 2010, life expectancy under this studied population had an 
increase of 3.35 years. Most part of the increases (44.27%, 1.48 years) within 
the last 10 years could be explained by the decrease of mortality in the 
population at age ≥ 80. Both cerebrovascular and heart diseases were 
contributing the most to the increment of life expectancy while mortality of 
malignant tumors appeared a negative contributor to this increment.
CONCLUSION: From 2000 to 2010, increment in life expectancy contributed to the 
decrease of mortality in the elderly and the decrease of mortalities on both 
cardio- and cerebro-vascular diseases. The decrease of life expectancy was 
mainly due to the increase of mortality related to malignant tumors.

Gyeonggi-do 440-746, South Korea.

BACKGROUND: This study estimates the burden of disease in Korea during 2000-10, 
using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
METHODS: DALYs are the sum of years of life lost from mortality and years of 
life lost from disability. DALYs for 24 major diseases in 2000, 2005 and 2010 
Korea were calculated based on the Global Burden of Disease Study method.
RESULTS: As in other advanced nations, the burden of disease in Korea is 
characterized by an increasing importance of cancer, unipolar depression and 
ischemic heart disease (1681, 1508 and 562 person-years for Year 2010 in terms 
of DALYs per 10 0000, respectively). At the same time, unipolar depression, 
liver cirrhosis and mental and behavioral disorder due to alcohol use (1508, 323 
and 535 person-years for 2010, respectively) became much more common in Korea 
than in other advanced nations.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of disease in Korea follows the pattern of other 
advanced nations in general but also registers some unique characteristics 
affected by the nation's distinctive epidemiological and sociocultural contexts, 
e.g. rapid economic growth and dramatic social transition without appropriate 
policy response. Korea's health and welfare policy might need to incorporate 
these special conditions for the effective reduction of its disease burden.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The prevalence of obese in nursing home resident is 
increasing, causing an important change in patient's management and health 
assistance. Although evidence suggests that obesity is associated with 
comorbidity, disability, and mortality in older persons, such relationship has 
rarely been explored in the nursing home population and research is still mainly 
conducted in community-dwelling people.
METHODS: A review of the literature identified 11 suitable papers that discuss 
current knowledge about the management of obesity in nursing home.
RESULTS: The specificity of the obese nursing home residents is often to be 
disabled survivors of previous complications related to obesity with short life 
expectancy. Whether nutritional treatment and physical activity can improve 
clinical condition and quality of life in the obese remains an open question. 
Strengths and weaknesses of current methodologies in the assessment of adiposity 
are needed to be carefully considered, especially in a clinical setting with 
limited resources.
CONCLUSIONS: More investigations are required to understand obesity as a risk 
factor for institutionalization and a criterion of non-admission in nursing home 
at the same time. Although difficulties to implement these approaches are 
present, effective and feasible treatments for obesity should be tested.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the average cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained from hip surgery, and to examine the variation in that between hospitals.
DESIGN: The transformation of patient-reported outcome measures (EQ-5D data) 
into QALYs, covering 25,463 NHS patient episodes between April 2009 and August 
2010 from hospitals in England, using a model of future health change arising 
from a hip operation compared to a counterfactual of no operation. 
Hospital-level costs for hip procedures from the National Reference Costs 
data-set was used to calculate the hospitals' cost per QALY.
SETTING: English hospitals treating NHS-funded patients undergoing hip 
replacement.
PARTICIPANTS: NHS-funded patients undergoing primary hip replacement.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cost per QALY.
RESULTS: Assuming some degradation in patients' health over the lifetime of the 
hip prosthesis, average health gain arising from a hip operation was 2.77 QALYs. 
For procedures paid for by the NHS but carried out in the independent sector the 
average gain was 2.97 QALYs. Average NHS hospital hip procedure costs were 
estimated to be £5844. The unweighted average cost per QALY for NHS hospitals 
was £2128. There were significant variations in cost per QALY between hospitals; 
most of this variation appears to be driven by variations in cost, not QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the new patient-assessed health-related quality of life data 
combined with routine hospital-level cost data it is possible to estimate a 
procedure-based measure of efficiency for hospitals. The fact that variations in 
cost per QALY are strongly driven by variations in cost suggests that further 
work is needed to investigate the causes of cost variations per se--especially 
the quality of routine NHS cost data.

OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate potential uses of nationally collected 
patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) data to estimate cost-effectiveness of 
hernia surgery.
DESIGN: Cost-utility model populated with national PROMs, National Reference 
Cost and Hospital Episodes Statistics data.
SETTING: Hospitals in England that provided elective inguinal hernia repair 
surgery for NHS patients between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2010.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients >18 years undergoing NHS-funded elective hernia surgery 
in English hospitals who completed PROMs questionnaires.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in quality-adjusted life year (QALY) following 
surgery; cost per QALY of surgery by acute provider hospital; health gain and 
cost per QALY by surgery type received (laparoscopic or open hernia repair).
RESULTS: The casemix-adjusted, discounted (at 3.5%) and degraded (over 25 years) 
mean change in QALYs following elective hernia repair surgery is 0.826 (95% CI, 
0.793-0.859) compared to a counterfactual of no treatment. Patients undergoing 
laparoscopic surgery show a significantly greater gain in health-related quality 
of life (EQ-5D index change, 0.0915; 95% CI, 0.0850-0.0979) with an estimated 
gain of 0.923 QALYS (95% CI, 0.859-0.988) compared to those having open repair 
(EQ-5D index change, 0.0806; 95% CI, 0.0771-0.0841) at 0.817 QALYS (95% CI, 
0.782-0.852). The average cost of hernia surgery in England is £1554, 
representing a mean cost per QALY of £1881. The mean cost of laparoscopic and 
open hernia surgery is equivocal (£1421 vs. £1426 respectively) but 
laparoscopies appear to offer higher cost-utility at £1540 per QALY, compared to 
£1746 per QALY for open surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine PROMs data derived from NHS patients could be usefully 
analyzed to estimate health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of interventions to 
inform decision-making. This analysis suggests elective hernia surgery offers 
value-for-money, and laparoscopic repair is more clinically effective and 
generates higher cost-utility than open surgery.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A limited life expectancy reduces the benefit from 
carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for treatment of asymptomatic internal carotid 
artery stenosis. The aim of this study was to assess homocysteine as stratifying 
biomarker to improve prediction of postoperative survival.
METHODS: This was a prospective, nonrandomized case series from 2003 to 2012. 
Two hundred and fourteen consecutive patients (<75 years, n=130; ≥75 years, 
n=84) undergoing CEA for their asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis 
were observed for 8.5 years for the occurrence of death after CEA as primary end 
point (EC-nr: 04-067-0604). Homocysteine and major cardiovascular risk factors 
were used for computation of prognostic indices. Cumulative survival of 
prognostic indices-based quintiles was estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves.
RESULTS: Total homocysteine had a significant effect on postoperative survival 
(P<0.0001). Total homocysteine-based quintiles of prognostic indices showed a 
better prediction of the survival of the patients than age alone. This caused 
reclassification of 17 patients (20.2%)>75 years as fit for surgery, but also 
indicated a high risk for 19 patients (14.6%)<75 years. In the majority (79.8%) 
of patients aged>75 years, statistically, CEA could not be advised because of a 
significantly reduced 5-year survival rate.
CONCLUSIONS: High plasma homocysteine levels suggest that older patients with 
asymptomatic carotid stenosis might rather benefit from intensive medical 
therapy than from CEA.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) have been 
accepted as a useful method to estimate the burden of disease, and can be 
adapted to determine the number of productive years lost due to the disability. 
DALY has been reported for many studies but not for leprosy. Hence this study 
was carried out in three States of India. In view of the fact that in this 
study, productive working years are used, the term is modified as DAWLY.
METHODS: A representative random sample of 150 leprosy affected persons, 50 from 
each States of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh, was chosen, and data 
were collected on detailed work-life history, occupation, time when leprosy was 
discovered, reported and treatment started, break of job/loss of income due to 
leprosy. The loss of wages and durations were used to compute the life-years 
lost due to leprosy, and summarized over the average total duration of 42 years 
of productive work-life from 18 to 60 years. The percentage losses were 
determined and differences tested for statistical significance.
RESULTS: The overall mean (± SE) disability adjusted working life years was 28.6 
(±0.67), a reduction of 13.4 yr from the ideal productive working life period of 
42 yr. The youngest patients with disability had a reduction of 41.4 per cent, 
as compared to the oldest patients. There was a significant increase in loss 
based on year for those whose disability started earlier (P=0.0024).
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: On an average, 30 per cent of the leprosy affected 
person's work life is lost due to disability.

The monthly rhythm of incidence and age at menarche: thirty five years of 
research. The circa-vacation-study expectancy rhythm of incidence and age at 
menarche.

The hypothesis that the vacation-study-expectancy scholar regime produces most 
of the monthly rhythm of the age at menarche (AaM) was tested. Studies on 
monthly menarche incidence (MI) refuted climatic factors as a main factor in 
this rhythm, and indicated that the main factor of this rhythm is the succession 
of expectancies of study (Stu-months) or vacation (Vac-months) months within a 
year. Thus the hypothesis of seasonal circa-annual rhythm should be modified to 
the circa-[vacation (fiesta)]-[study (non-fiesta)]-expectancies rhythm for the 
MI and age at menarche annual rhythms. In several countries Vac-months had 
higher MI than Stu-months. The high MI of Vac-months was followed by a large 
decrease when girls started their studies and a MI increase occurred as 
vacations approached. The hypothesis proposes that at the end of vacations and 
at the beginning of the study period the AaM should be lowest, and then the mean 
of AaM should increase because of the menarche delay of girls whose menarche was 
arrested by the initiation of school work. This pattern was found in four 
independent samples, from Chile, Colombia, USA and Brazil. The probability that 
this result be due to random fluctuation of means is extraordinarily low 
(P<10⁻⁸). I conclude that the influence of the expectancy of vacation and study 
periods on the monthly rhythm of the age at menarche is a real process that 
accounts for most of this rhythm.

OBJECTIVES: EuroQoL-5 dimension (EQ-5D) is a standardised preference-based tool 
for measurement of health-related quality of life and EQ-5D utility values can 
be converted to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to aid cost-utility 
analysis. This study aimed to evaluate the EQ-5D utility values of 639 patients 
with primary Sjögren's syndrome (PSS) in the UK.
METHODS: Prospective data collected using a standardised pro forma were compared 
with UK normative data. Relationships between utility values and the clinical 
and laboratory features of PSS were explored.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients with PSS reporting any problem in mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression were 42.2%, 
16.7%, 56.6%, 80.6% and 49.4%, respectively, compared with 5.4%, 1.6%, 7.9%, 
30.2% and 15.7% for the UK general population. The median EQ-5D utility value 
was 0.691 (IQR 0.587-0.796, range -0.239 to 1.000) with a bimodal distribution. 
Bivariate correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between EQ-5D 
utility values and many clinical features of PSS, but most strongly with pain, 
depression and fatigue (R values>0.5). After adjusting for age and sex 
differences, multiple regression analysis identified pain and depression as the 
two most important predictors of EQ-5D utility values, accounting for 48% of the 
variability. Anxiety, fatigue and body mass index were other statistically 
significant predictors, but they accounted for <5% in variability.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the EQ-5D utility values of patients 
with PSS. These patients have significantly impaired utility values compared 
with the UK general population. EQ-5D utility values are significantly related 
to pain and depression scores in PSS.

Amyloidosis in Alzheimer's Disease: The Toxicity of Amyloid Beta (A β ), 
Mechanisms of Its Accumulation and Implications of Medicinal Plants for Therapy.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads 
to memory deficits and death. While the number of individuals with AD is rising 
each year due to the longer life expectancy worldwide, current therapy can only 
somewhat relieve the symptoms of AD. There is no proven medication to cure or 
prevent the disease, possibly due to a lack of knowledge regarding the molecular 
mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis. Most previous studies have accepted 
the "amyloid hypothesis," in which the neuropathogenesis of AD is believed to be 
triggered by the accumulation of the toxic amyloid beta (A β ) protein in the 
central nervous system (CNS). Lately, knowledge that may be critical to 
unraveling the hidden pathogenic pathway of AD has been revealed. This review 
concentrates on the toxicity of A β and the mechanism of accumulation of this 
toxic protein in the brain of individuals with AD and also summarizes recent 
advances in the study of these accumulation mechanisms together with the role of 
herbal medicines that could facilitate the development of more effective 
therapeutic and preventive strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rapidly becoming one of the leading causes of 
disability and mortality in the elderly. As life-expectancy increases, an 
increasing number of people will rely on modern medicines to treat 
age-associated disorders. Among these medications, some might benefit, while 
others might exacerbate, the pathogenesis of AD. We screened 1,600 FDA approved 
drugs for β-amyloid (Aβ)-modifying activity and identified drugs that can 
potentially influence amyloid precursor protein processing. In this study, we 
focused on cardiovascular drugs and demonstrated that some hypertensive 
medication can differentially modulate Aβ, both in vitro and in vivo. Our study 
suggests that some commonly prescribed drugs might exert unintended effects and 
modulate AD and provides the basis for continuing investigation of the role of 
individual drugs on a case-by-case basis. This line of investigation will lead 
to the identification of common medications that are potentially beneficial or 
detrimental to AD as a reference for physicians to consider when prescribing the 
most appropriate drugs for their patients, particularly for treating chronic 
disorders among the growing geriatric population.

[Experimental evaluation of reamberin and cytoflavin effects on the course and 
outcome of acute burn injury].

[Article in Russian]

Zinov'ev EV, Nesterov IuV, Lagvilava TO.

Survival rate, average life expectancy of victims, parameters of the acid - base 
balance, gas composition of blood, and morphological structure of internal 
organs have been studied in acute experiments on a group of 120 rats with burn 
injury of IIIB degree (20% of body surface) against early introduction of 
antihypoxants reamberin and cytoflavin. It is established that the introduction 
of antihypoxants reliably prevents the development of typical pathologic 
processes and hypoxemia, reduces expressiveness of organ dysfunction and extent 
of mophological changes in internal organs, and increases 1.5 - 2.5 times the 
survival rate of heavily damaged animals in the acute period of burn injury.

OBJECTIVES: To validate risk prediction models for acute traumatic brain injury 
(TBI) and to use the best model to evaluate the optimum location and comparative 
costs of neurocritical care in the NHS.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: Sixty-seven adult critical care units.
PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to critical care following 
actual/suspected TBI with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of < 15.
INTERVENTIONS: Critical care delivered in a dedicated neurocritical care unit, a 
combined neuro/general critical care unit within a neuroscience centre or a 
general critical care unit outside a neuroscience centre.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended (GOSE) 
questionnaire and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, 3-level version 
(EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire at 6 months following TBI.
RESULTS: The final Risk Adjustment In Neurocritical care (RAIN) study data set 
contained 3626 admissions. After exclusions, 3210 patients with acute TBI were 
included. Overall follow-up rate at 6 months was 81%. Of 3210 patients, 101 
(3.1%) had no GCS score recorded and 134 (4.2%) had a last pre-sedation GCS 
score of 15, resulting in 2975 patients for analysis. The most common causes of 
TBI were road traffic accidents (RTAs) (33%), falls (47%) and assault (12%). 
Patients were predominantly young (mean age 45 years overall) and male (76% 
overall). Six-month mortality was 22% for RTAs, 32% for falls and 17% for 
assault. Of survivors at 6 months with a known GOSE category, 44% had severe 
disability, 30% moderate disability and 26% made a good recovery. Overall, 61% 
of patients with known outcome had an unfavourable outcome (death or severe 
disability) at 6 months. Between 35% and 70% of survivors reported problems 
across the five domains of the EQ-5D-3L. Of the 10 risk models selected for 
validation, the best discrimination overall was from the International Mission 
for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI Lab model (IMPACT) (c-index 
0.779 for mortality, 0.713 for unfavourable outcome). The model was well 
calibrated for 6-month mortality but substantially underpredicted the risk of 
unfavourable outcome at 6 months. Baseline patient characteristics were similar 
between dedicated neurocritical care units and combined neuro/general critical 
care units. In lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis, dedicated neurocritical 
care units had higher mean lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at small 
additional mean costs with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
£14,000 per QALY and incremental net monetary benefit (INB) of £17,000. The 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve suggested that the probability that 
dedicated compared with combined neurocritical care units are cost-effective is 
around 60%. There were substantial differences in case mix between the 'early' 
(within 18 hours of presentation) and 'no or late' (after 24 hours) transfer 
groups. After adjustment, the 'early' transfer group reported higher lifetime 
QALYs at an additional cost with an ICER of £11,000 and INB of £17,000.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk models demonstrated sufficient statistical performance to 
support their use in research but fell below the level required to guide 
individual patient decision-making. The results suggest that management in a 
dedicated neurocritical care unit may be cost-effective compared with a combined 
neuro/general critical care unit (although there is considerable statistical 
uncertainty) and support current recommendations that all patients with severe 
TBI would benefit from transfer to a neurosciences centre, regardless of the 
need for surgery. We recommend further research to improve risk prediction 
models; consider alternative approaches for handling unobserved confounding; 
better understand long-term outcomes and alternative pathways of care; and 
explore equity of access to postcritical care support for patients following 
acute TBI.

OBJECTIVES: Mechanical circulatory support through left ventricular assist 
devices (LVADs) improves survival and quality of life for patients with 
end-stage heart failure who are ineligible for cardiac transplantation. Our aim 
was to calculate the cost-effectiveness of continuous-flow LVADs.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective was performed. A 
lifetime Markov model was set up in which continuous-flow LVAD was compared with 
optimal medical therapy (OMT). The treatment effect was modeled indirectly 
combining the results of the REMATCH trial comparing OMT with a pulsatile-flow 
LVAD and the HeartMate II Destination Therapy Trial comparing a pulsatile-flow 
LVAD with a continuous-flow LVAD. Cost data were based on real-world financial 
data of sixty-nine patients with a HeartMate II implantation from the University
