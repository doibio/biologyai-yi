PURPOSE: Craniopharyngiomas (CPGs) are aggressive brain tumors responsible of 
severe morbidity in children. The best treatment strategies are under debate. 
Our study evaluates surgical, pituitary, and hypothalamic outcomes of a tailored 
staged-surgical approach compared to a single-stage radical approach in children 
with CPGs.
METHODS: Multicenter retrospective study enrolling 96 children treated for CPGs 
in the period 2010-2022. The surgical management was selected after a 
multidisciplinary evaluation. Primary endpoint includes the inter-group 
comparison of preservation/improvement of hypothalamic-pituitary function, the 
extent of resection, and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints 
include overall survival (OS), morbidity, and quality of life (QoL).
RESULTS: Gross Total Resection (GTR) was reached in 46.1% of cases in the 
single-stage surgery group (82 patients, age at surgery 9 ± 4.7 years) and 33.3% 
after the last operation in the staged surgery group (14 patients age 
7.64 ± 4.57 years at first surgery and 9.36 ± 4.7 years at the last surgery). 
The PFS was significantly higher in patients addressed to staged- compared to 
single-stage surgery (93.75% vs 70.7% at 5 years, respectively, p = 0.03). The 
recurrence rate was slightly higher in the single-stage surgery group. No 
significant differences emerged in the endocrinological, visual, hypothalamic 
outcome, OS, and QoL comparing the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric CPGs' surgical radicality and timing of intervention 
should be tailored considering both anatomical extension and 
hypothalamic-pituitary function. In selected patients, a staged approach offers 
a safer and more effective disease control, preserving psychophysical 
development.

Virtual screening (VS) is a computational strategy that uses in silico automated 
protein docking inter alia to rank potential ligands, or by extension rank 
protein-ligand pairs, identifying potential drug candidates. Most docking 
methods use preferred sets of physicochemical descriptors (PCDs) to model the 
interactions between host and guest molecules. Thus, conventional VS is often 
data-specific, method-dependent and with demonstrably differing utility in 
identifying candidate drugs. This study proposes four universality classes of 
novel consensus scoring (CS) algorithms that combine docking scores, derived 
from ten docking programs (ADFR, DOCK, Gemdock, Ledock, PLANTS, PSOVina, 
QuickVina2, Smina, Autodock Vina and VinaXB), using decoys from the DUD-E 
repository ( http://dude.docking.org/ ) against 29 MRSA-oriented targets to 
create a general VS formulation that can identify active ligands for any 
suitable protein target. Our results demonstrate that CS provides improved 
ligand-protein docking fidelity when compared to individual docking platforms. 
This approach requires only a small number of docking combinations and can serve 
as a viable and parsimonious alternative to more computationally expensive 
docking approaches. Predictions from our CS algorithm are compared against 
independent machine learning evaluations using the same docking data, 
complementing the CS outcomes. Our method is a reliable approach for identifying 
protein targets and high-affinity ligands that can be tested as high-probability 
candidates for drug repositioning.

BACKGROUND: The reduction of multiple psychiatric hospitalizations is an 
important clinical challenge in mental health care. In fact, psychiatric 
re-hospitalization negatively affects the quality of life and the life 
expectancy of patients with psychiatric disorders. For these reasons, 
identifying predictors of re-hospitalization is important for better managing 
psychiatric patients. The first purpose of the present study was to examine the 
readmission rate in a large sample of inpatients with a psychiatric disorder. 
Second, we investigated the role of several demographical and clinical features 
impacting re-hospitalization.  METHOD: This retrospective study enrolled 1001 
adult inpatients (510 men and 491 women) consecutively admitted to the 
University Psychiatric Clinic, Sant'Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome 
between January 2018 and January 2022. To identify risk factors for psychiatric 
re-hospitalization, we divided the sample into 3 subgroups: the Zero-Re group 
which had no readmission after the index hospitalization, the One-Re group with 
patients re-admitted only once, and the Two-Re with at least two re-admissions.  
RESULTS: The groups differed according to previous hospitalizations, a history 
of suicide attempts, age at onset, and length of stay. Furthermore, the results 
of the regression model demonstrated that the Two-Re group was more likely to 
have a history of suicide attempts and previous hospitalizations.
DISCUSSION: These results indicate the importance of assessing risk factors in 
psychiatric hospitalized patients and implementing ad hoc prevention strategies 
for reducing subsequent re-hospitalizations.

Different Extracellular β-Amyloid (1-42) Aggregates Differentially Impair Neural 
Cell Adhesion and Neurite Outgrowth through Differential Induction of Scaffold 
Palladin.

Extracellular amyloid β-protein (1-42) (Aβ42) aggregates have been recognized as 
toxic agents for neural cells in vivo and in vitro. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the cytotoxic effects of extracellular Aβ42 aggregates in soluble 
(or suspended, SAβ42) and deposited (or attached, DAβ42) forms on cell 
adhesion/re-adhesion, neurite outgrowth, and intracellular scaffold palladin 
using the neural cell lines SH-SY5Y and HT22, and to elucidate the potential 
relevance of these effects. The effect of extracellular Aβ42 on neural cell 
adhesion was directly associated with their neurotrophic or neurotoxic activity, 
with SAβ42 aggregates reducing cell adhesion and associated live cell 
de-adherence more than DAβ42 aggregates, while causing higher mortality. The 
reduction in cell adhesion due to extracellular Aβ42 aggregates was accompanied 
by the impairment of neurite outgrowth, both in length and number, and 
similarly, SAβ42 aggregates impaired the extension of neurites more severely 
than DAβ42 aggregates. Further, the disparate changes of intracellular palladin 
induced by SAβ42 and DAβ42 aggregates, respectively, might underlie their 
aforementioned effects on target cells. Further, the use of anti-oligomeric Aβ42 
scFv antibodies revealed that extracellular Aβ42 aggregates, especially large 
DAβ42 aggregates, had some independent detrimental effects, including physical 
barrier effects on neural cell adhesion and neuritogenesis in addition to their 
neurotoxicity, which might be caused by the rigid C-terminal clusters formed 
between adjacent Aβ42 chains in Aβ42 aggregates. Our findings, concerning how 
scaffold palladin responds to extracellular Aβ42 aggregates, and is closely 
connected with declines in cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth, provide new 
insights into the cytotoxicity of extracellular Aβ42 aggregates in Alzheimer 
disease.

Absent or reduced physical activity and spontaneous movement over days, weeks, 
or even years may lead to problems in almost every major organ/system in the 
human body. In this study, we investigated whether the dysregulation and 
alteration of plasma protein inflammatory profiling can stratify chronic 
bedridden conditions observed in 22 elderly chronic bedridden (CBR) individuals 
with respect to 11 age-matched active (OLD) controls. By using a combination of 
immune-assay multiplex techniques, a complex of 27 inflammatory mediators was 
assessed in the plasma collected from the two groups. A specific plasma protein 
signature is indeed able to distinguish IPO individuals from age-matched OLD 
controls; while significantly (p < 0.001) higher protein levels of IL-2, IL-7, 
and IL-12p70 were measured in the plasma of CBR with respect to OLD individuals, 
significantly (p < 0.01) higher levels of seven inflammatory mediators, 
including IL-9, PDGF-b, CCL4 (MIP-1b), CCL5 (RANTES), IL-1Ra, CXCL10 (IP10), and 
CCL2 (MCP-1), were identified in OLD individuals with respect to CBR 
individuals. These data suggest that the chronic absence of physical activity 
may contribute to the dysregulation of a complex molecular pattern occurring 
with ageing and that specific plasma protein signatures may represent potential 
biomarkers as well as new potential therapeutic targets for new treatments aimed 
at improving health expectancy.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is now standard of care for several metastatic 
epithelial cancers and prolongs life expectancy for a significant fraction of 
patients. A hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) induced by intrinsic oncogenic 
signaling induces an immunosuppressive niche that protects the tumor cells, 
limiting the durability and efficacy of ICB therapies. Addition of receptor 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKi) as potential modulators of an unfavorable 
local immune environment has resulted in moderate life expectancy improvement. 
Though the combination strategy of ICB and RTKi has shown significantly better 
results compared to individual treatment, the benefits and adverse events are 
additive whereas synergy of benefit would be preferable. There is therefore a 
need to investigate the potential of inhibitors other than RTKs to reduce 
malignant cell survival while enhancing anti-tumor immunity. In the last five 
years, preclinical studies have focused on using small molecule inhibitors 
targeting cell cycle and DNA damage regulators such as CDK4/6, CHK1 and poly ADP 
ribosyl polymerase (PARP) to selectively kill tumor cells and enhance cytotoxic 
immune responses. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the available 
drugs that attenuate immunosuppression and overcome hostile TME that could be 
used to boost FDA-approved ICB efficacy in the near future.

Background: The estimation of biological age is challenging in patients with 
cancers. We aimed to investigate frailty-based biological ages using 
frailty-discriminant scores (FDS) and examined the effect of biological-expected 
life age discrepancy on the prognosis of patients with urological cancers. 
Methods: We retrospectively evaluated frailty in 1035 patients having urological 
cancers. Their frailty-based biological age was then defined by the FDS, which 
is a comprehensive frailty assessment tool, using 1790 noncancer individuals as 
controls. An expected life age (=chronological age + life expectancy) was 
subsequently calculated using the 2019 life expectancy table. The primary 
outcome was the estimation of the biological-expected life age discrepancy 
between the frailty-based biological age and expected life age in patients with 
urological cancers. Secondary outcomes were the evaluation of the effect of the 
biological-expected life age discrepancy on overall survival. Results: We 
included 405, 466, and 164 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, urothelial 
carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma, respectively. The median chronological age, 
life expectancy, and estimated frailty-based biological age were 71, 17, and 83 
years, respectively. The biological-expected life age discrepancy in any 
urological cancers, localized diseases, and metastatic diseases was −4.8, −6.3, 
and +0.15 years, respectively. The biological-expected life age discrepancy of 
>5 years was significantly associated with poor overall survival. Conclusions: 
The biological-expected life age discrepancy between frailty-based biological 
age and expected life age may be helpful in understanding the role of frailty 
and patient/doctor conversation.

The safety profile of hydroxyurea (HU) in patients with sickle-cell disease 
(SCD) is relatively well known. However, despite the suspected association of HU 
with myeloid neoplasms in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and the 
publication of sporadic reports of myeloid malignancies in SCD patients treated 
with HU, the possible excess risk imparted by HU in this population having an 
increasing life expectancy has failed to be demonstrated. Herein, we report one 
case of myelodysplastic syndrome emanating from the results on safety and 
effectiveness of HU on the largest European cohort of 1903 HU-treated adults and 
children who were followed-up prospectively in an observational setting over 10 
years, accounting for a total exposure of 7309.5 patient-years. A comparison of 
this single case with previously published similar cases did not allow us to 
draw any significant conclusions due to the paucity of these events.

A Scoping Review of Rodent Studies Investigating the Epigenetic Mechanisms in 
the Brain Underlying the Effects of Diet on Depressive-like Behaviour.

A healthy diet has been highly associated with a decreased risk for mental 
health problems such as major depression. Evidence from human studies shows that 
diet can influence mood but there is a poor understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms behind these effects, especially the role of epigenetic alterations 
in the brain. Our objective was to use the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) 
format to gather all recent studies using animal models that investigate direct 
or indirect (on the offspring) effects of diet on depressive symptoms, including 
studies that assess epigenetic mechanisms in the brain. In this format, two 
authors conducted independent database searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and 
Academic search premier using one search block "diet epigenetics depression" to 
find papers published between 2000 and 2022. Relevant studies were selected 
using pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria that were performed independently 
by the two authors before a subset of studies were selected for qualitative 
analysis. A total of 11 studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic 
scoping review. We found that the literature focuses primarily on the effects of 
individual nutrients, instead of a specific diet, on despair-like behaviour and 
anxiety. Studies are heterogenous with the techniques used to asses epigenetic 
changes in the brain and therefore making it hard to reach common mechanistic 
explanations. However, all studies report diet-induced changes in the epigenome 
mainly by the action of DNA methylation, histone acetylation and microRNAs that 
are parallelel with changes in behaviour. Moreover studies show that inadequate 
maternal diets can make the offspring more susceptible to develop anxiety and 
depressive-like behaviour later in life, which is paralleled with changes in the 
epigenome. Overall, this systematic review shows that there is some literature 
suggesting a role of brain epigenetics on the diet-induced protective or 
detrimental effects, specifically on anxiety and depressive-like behaviour. 
However, studies are limited, lacking the study of some types of diets, 
behavioural tasks or epigenetic mechanisms. Nevertherless, it shows the 
importance of genome-environment interactions, bringing new insights towards 
mechanisms that could be involved in the pathophysiology of mood disorders as 
well as putative therapeutic targets.

Current treatments for lower-grade glioma (LGG) do not effectively improve life 
expectancy rates, and this is a major global health concern. Improving our 
knowledge of this disease will ultimately help to improve prevention, accurate 
prognosis, and treatment strategies. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of 
regulated cell death, which plays an important role in tumor progression and 
occurrence. There is still a lack of effective markers to evaluate the prognosis 
of LGG patients. We collected paraffin-embedded tissue samples and prognostic 
information from 85 patients with low-grade gliomas and fabricated them into a 
tissue microarray. Combining data from public databases, we explored the 
relationship between pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) and the prognoses of 
patients with LGG and investigated their correlations with the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) by means of machine learning, single-cell, 
immunohistochemical, nomogram, GSEA, and Cox regression analyses. We developed a 
six-gene PRG-based prognostic model, and the results have identified CASP4 as an 
effective marker for LGG prognosis predictions. Furthermore, the effects on 
immune cell infiltration may also provide guidance for future immunotherapy 
strategies.

Melatonin (MT) can improve the effect of cryopreservation on oocytes by 
suppressing oxidative stress and maintaining the permeability of the oolemma. In 
this study, MT was firstly applied to human oocytes' cryopreservation to explore 
the effect of prolonged cryopreservation on developmental competence and its 
role. Collected in vitro-matured human oocytes were cryopreserved in 
MT-containing or MT-free medium for 0 and 6 months; after warming, viable 
oocytes were assessed for developmental viability, intracellular protein 
expression, mitochondrial function, and oxidation-antioxidant system. Meanwhile, 
fresh oocytes were set as the control. The results showed that with the 
extension of cryopreservation time, the developmental competence of oocytes 
gradually declined, accompanied by the down-regulation of most mitochondrial 
function-related proteins, the reduction in ATP and GSH production, the increase 
in ROS accumulation, and the aggravation of the imbalance of ROS/GSH in oocytes. 
However, the participation of MT seemed to effectively mitigate these negative 
effects. Therefore, we speculate that melatonin may maintain normal ATP 
production and ROS/GSH balance in cryopreserved oocytes by protecting 
mitochondrial function and inhibiting oxidative damage, thereby effectively 
maintaining the developmental competence of human oocytes in prolonged 
cryopreservation.

Patients with endometrial cancer (EC) frequently have metastases to lungs, 
extra-pelvic nodes, and liver. Although an uncommon occurrence, cases of EC 
metastasis to bone, prevalently in vertebral bone, have also been reported. The 
objective of this study was to analyze clinical and pathological profiles of 
patients with EC metastatic to vertebral bone. We carried out a retrospective 
case series on surgically treated patients for this pathology. From 2001 to 
2021, out of 775 patients with bone metastasis, 1.6% had bone metastasis from 
EC. The median time between the diagnosis of primary tumor and that of bone 
metastases was 31.5 months. Solitary bone lesion was present in 7 patients and 
lumbar vertebrae were the segments most affected. Pathological fractures in 
46.2% of patients and spinal pain in all were present. In terms of location, 
46.2% of bone metastases resided within the anterior section of the vertebra, 
while the remaining presented an extension within the anterior and posterior 
sections, with 46.1% of cases showing an extradural extra-osseous extension and 
paraspinous envelope. Median survival after diagnosis of bone metastasis was 
11.5 months. Vertebral bone metastasis in EC is a rare phenomenon, with severe 
prognosis. An in-depth understanding of this topic may guide future management 
and treatment decisions, thus improving life expectancy and quality.

Skin aging is an intricate physiological process governed by intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors. Increasing life expectancy has turned skin aging into a 
growing concern for the general population. Clinical examination of the skin 
does not fully describe the skin aging process. This study aims to evaluate the 
healthy skin of five different age groups in order to develop an easy-to-use 
confocal score for quantifying signs of skin aging and test the correlation 
between this new score and the already described clinical score, SCINEXA (score 
of intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging). Thirty-five subjects split into five age 
groups: <35; 36−45; 46−55; 56−65, and >65 years old were enrolled. Clinical 
signs were quantified using the SCINEXA score, and known confocal variables of 
skin aging were evaluated. Three different semi-quantitative scores were 
calculated: epidermal disarrangement score (EDS), epidermal hyperplasia score 
(EHS), and dermal score (DS). The EDS showed a stable trend up to the age of 65 
and a dramatic increase in older subjects. EHS was characterized by an ascending 
trend from younger subjects to middle-aged ones. The DS was progressive with 
age, with a different proportion of distinct collagen types. The confocal CSIESA 
(confocal score for the assessment of intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging) score 
correlated well with the SCINEXA score. Reflectance confocal microscopy is a 
powerful, non-invasive technique for microscopically quantifying aging signs.

The antioxidant, organoleptic, and physicochemical changes in different 
marinated oven-grilled chicken breast meat were investigated. Specifically, the 
chicken breast meat samples were procured from a local retailer in Wroclaw, 
Poland. The antioxidant aspects involved 
2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazolin-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), 
1,1-diphenyl-2-pierylhydrazy (DPPH), and ferric-reducing antioxidant power 
(FRAP). The organoleptic aspects involved sensory and texture aspects. The 
physicochemical aspects involved the pH, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance 
(TBARS), cooking weight loss, L* a* b* color, and textural cutting force. 
Different marination variants comprised incremental 0.5, 1, and 1.5% 
concentrations of Baikal skullcap (BS), cranberry pomace (CP), and grape pomace 
(GP) that depicted antioxidants, and subsequently incorporated either African 
spice (AS) or an industrial marinade/pickle (IM). The oven grill facility was 
set at a temperature of 180 °C and a constant cooking time of 5 min. Results 
showed various antioxidant, organoleptic and physicochemical range values across 
the different marinated oven-grilled chicken breast meat samples, most of which 
appeared somewhat limited. Incorporating either AS or IM seemingly widens the 
ABTS and FRAP ranges, with much less for the DPPH. Moreover, with increasing CP, 
GP, and BS concentrations, fluctuations seemingly persist in pH, TBARS, cooking 
weight loss, L* a* b* color, and textural cutting force values even when either 
AS or IM was incorporated, despite resemblances in some organoleptic sensory and 
texture profiles. Overall, the oven-grilling approach promises to moderate the 
antioxidant, organoleptic, and physicochemical value ranges in the different 
marinated chicken breast meat samples in this study.

Meat spoilage caused by temperature abuse is a major problem for producers, 
retailers, and consumers that can generate large economic losses to industries. 
Microbial growth of Pseudomonas spp. is the main source of spoilage during 
storage. Cinnamon has antimicrobial properties that may potentially be used to 
reduce the spoilage caused by Pseudomonas. The objectives of this study were to 
determine the inhibitory effect of cinnamon extract (CE) against Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and evaluate the treatment of CE on meat quality during 
different storage temperatures (5 °C, 10 °C, 15 °C, and 25 °C). The 
anti-Pseudomonas result showed that 100% (w/v) CE concentration produced a 13.50 
mm zone of inhibition in a disc diffusion assay. The minimum inhibitor 
concentration (MIC) of CE was noted at 25% (v/v), whereas the minimum 
bactericidal concentration (MBC) value was observed at 50% (v/v) concentration 
of CE. The time-kill showed the growth of P. aeruginosa decreased from 7.64 to 
5.39 log CFU/mL at MIC concentration. Total phenolic content and IC50 value of 
the cinnamon extract was expressed as 6.72 ± 0.87 mg GAE/g extract and 0.15 
mg/mL, respectively. When the meat was marinated with 50% (v/v) CE and stored at 
various temperatures, the total viable count (TVC) and growth of Pseudomonas 
spp. were lowered as compared to the control sample. However, the reduction in 
microbial count in all samples was influenced by the storage temperature, where 
the lowered microbial count was noted in the sample treated with CE and stored 
at 5 and 10 °C for 48 h. The pH of meat treated with or without CE ranged from 
pH 5.74 to 6.48. The sensory attributes of colour, texture, and overall 
acceptability have a significant difference, except for odour, between marinated 
meat and control. The results indicate that the use of cinnamon extract as the 
marination agent for meat could reduce the growth of Pseudomonas spp. and 
therefore assist in extending the shelf life of meat at 5 and 10 °C storage 
temperatures.

Increased life expectancy in Spain has highlighted the need for formal 
caregivers who care for older adults who live at home. In many cases, families 
choose to hire immigrants from Latin America who, on many occasions, have been 
forced to emigrate, which causes a considerable psychological impact on them. To 
this, other factors such as precarious working conditions, loneliness, or high 
workload are added, which leads to many caregivers becoming sick. The aim of 
this study was to assess the quality of life and the level of anxiety derived 
from the workload of Latin American immigrants who come to Spain to care for 
older adults. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out using two 
validated questionnaires to measure this relationship. A correlation was also 
established between quality of life and anxiety as expressed by the 
participants. The sample consisted of a total of 426 subjects. One of the main 
results showed that the lower the caregiver's quality of life, the higher their 
level of anxiety (OR = 1.06; 95% CI). Live-in caregivers had a lower quality of 
life than people who did not live in the same house as the cared-for person (OR 
= 2.22; 95% CI). Working long hours and having a high workload was associated 
with poorer quality of life and higher levels of anxiety. Assessing immigrants 
who are formal caregivers and providing them with the support that helps to 
improve their quality of life is suggested to reduce the occurrence of anxiety 
disorders.

Schizophrenia is a life-shortening disease and life expectancy in patients may 
be 15-20 years shorter than in the general population, with increasing longevity 
gap over time. Premature mortality in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders is mainly 
due to preventable natural causes, such as cardio-vascular disease, infections, 
respiratory tract diseases and cancer, alongside suicide, homicide and 
accidents. There is a complex interplay of factors that act synergistically and 
cause physical morbidity to patients and subsequent mortality. Smoking, 
alcohol/substance abuse and sedentary life style, alongside disease-related 
factors, such as metabolic abnormalities and accelerating aging contribute to 
physical morbidity. Moreover, the symptomatology of psychosis and stigma may 
limit patients' access to quality medical care. Interventions to promote 
physical health in those patients should be multifaceted, and should target all 
patient-related modifiable factors, but also should address service-related 
healthcare disparities. Long-term antipsychotic use (including clozapine and 
long-acting injectables) is associated with substantially decreased all-cause 
mortality, including suicide and cardiovascular mortality, in patients with 
schizophrenia despite the well-known cardiometabolic adverse effects of 
second-generation agents. Integrated care may involve co-location of physical 
and mental health services, liaison services, shared protocols and information 
sharing systems, and has emerged as a way to address the physical health needs 
of those patients. Interventions to address mortality in schizophrenia and 
related syndromes should take place as early as possible in the course of the 
patients' treatment, and could be an integral component of care delivered by 
specialized early intervention services.

Hamburg, Germany.

The aim of this study was to determine the association between sexual 
satisfaction and expected longevity among middle-aged and older adults (also 
stratified by sex). Data were taken from the German Ageing Survey (year 2011; n 
= 3231)—a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling individuals ≥ 
40 years in Germany. A widely used question was used to quantify sexual 
satisfaction. Furthermore, the expected life expectancy served as an outcome 
measure. After adjusting for various covariates, multiple linear regressions 
showed that sexual satisfaction was associated with higher expected longevity 
among the total sample (β = 0.28, p < 0.05). Moreover, it was associated with 
higher expected longevity among women (β = 0.48, p < 0.05), but not men. In 
conclusion, adjusting for several covariates, our results showed that there is 
an association between sexual satisfaction and higher expected longevity, 
particularly in women. Efforts to increase sexual satisfaction may thus also 
contribute to expected longevity which, in turn, can be beneficial for actual 
longevity.

Akademicka 15, 20-950 Lublin, Poland.

The aim of the study was to identify motives and barriers which have the 
greatest influence on participation in Nordic Walking (NW) of people with normal 
body weight and persons who are either overweight or obese (according to their 
BMI). In the study, the modified Physical Activity and Leisure Motivation Scale 
(PALMS) was used, which was designed to measure adult physical activity (PA) 
motivation. PALMS measures eight motives for participation in PA, on a 5-point 
Likert scale. The study was conducted during a NW competition and during 
training sessions of its participants. Two groups of respondents were taken into 
account: the first group with those with normal body weight and the second group 
with those who were overweight or obese. Respondents with normal body weight 
were more frequent participants of NW sessions. Enhanced body capacity, concern 
for one's health, improved body shape and lifespan extension were major motives 
of practicing NW. Polish people perceive PA as a means of improving the quality 
of life due to enhanced health and wellbeing. Subjects with normal body weight 
tended to mention lack of areas suitable for NW and lack of time due to 
professional work. Overweight or obese persons pointed to other types of PA, 
shyness and lack of time.
