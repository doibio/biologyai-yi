With the increase of life expectancy of humans in more than two-thirds of the 
countries in the World, aging diseases are becoming the frontline health 
problems. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now one of the major challenges in drug 
discovery, since, with the exception of memantine in 2003, all clinical trials 
with drug candidates failed over the past decade. If we consider that the loss 
of neurons is due to a high level of oxidative stress produced by nonregulated 
redox active metal ions like copper linked to amyloids of different sizes, 
regulation of metal homeostasis is a key target. The difficulty for large 
copper-carrier proteins to directly extract copper ions from metalated amyloids 
might be considered as being at the origin of the rupture of the copper 
homeostasis regulation in AD brains. So, there is an urgent need for new 
specific metal chelators that should be able to regulate the homeostasis of 
metal ions, specially copper and iron, in AD brains. As a consequence of that 
concept, chelators promoting metal excretion from brain are not desired. One 
should favor ligands able to extract copper ions from sinks (amyloids being the 
major one) and to transfer these redox-active metal ions to copper-carrier 
proteins or copper-containing enzymes. Obviously, the affinity of these 
chelators for the metal ion should not be a sufficient criterion, but the metal 
specificity and the ability of the chelators to release the metal under specific 
biological conditions should be considered. Such an approach is still largely 
unexplored. The requirements for the chelators are very high (ability to cross 
the brain-blood barrier, lack of toxicity, etc.), few chemical series were 
proposed, and, among them, biochemical or biological data are scarce. As a 
matter of fact, the bioinorganic pharmacology of AD represents less than 1% of 
all articles dedicated to AD drug research. The major part of these articles 
deals with an old and rather toxic drug, clioquinol and related analogs, that do 
not efficiently extract copper from soluble amyloids. We have designed and 
developed new tetradendate ligands such as 21 and PA1637 based on 
bis(8-aminoquinolines) that are specific for copper chelation and are able to 
extract copper(II) from amyloids and then can release copper ion upon reduction 
with a biological reducing agent. These studies contribute to the understanding 
of the physicochemical properties of the tetradentate copper ligands compared 
with bidentate ligands like clioquinol. One of these copper ligands, PA1637, 
after selection with a nontransgenic mouse model that is able to efficiently 
monitor the loss of episodic memory, is currently under preclinical development.

Our research approach is to design and develop reliable, efficient, flexible, 
economical, real-time and realistic wellness sensor networks for smart home 
systems. The heterogeneous sensor and actuator nodes based on wireless 
networking technologies are deployed into the home environment. These nodes 
generate real-time data related to the object usage and movement inside the 
home, to forecast the wellness of an individual. Here, wellness stands for how 
efficiently someone stays fit in the home environment and performs his or her 
daily routine in order to live a long and healthy life. We initiate the research 
with the development of the smart home approach and implement it in different 
home conditions (different houses) to monitor the activity of an inhabitant for 
wellness detection. Additionally, our research extends the smart home system to 
smart buildings and models the design issues related to the smart building 
environment; these design issues are linked with system performance and 
reliability. This research paper also discusses and illustrates the possible 
mitigation to handle the ISM band interference and attenuation losses without 
compromising optimum system performance.

[Role of the change of daily rhythms of adrenaline and noradrenaline 
concentration in blood in the mechanism of accelerated aging in hypopinealizm 
induced by a long period of day and night lighting].

[Article in Russian]

Bondarenko LA, Gorbach TV, Kozak VA.

In young adult male rabbits circadian rhythms change of blood concentrations of 
adrenaline and noradrenaline in the dynamics of hypopinealism development 
induced by a long period (5 months) twenty-four-hour lighting of low intensity 
(30-40 lux) were studied. It was found that the light in the night leads to a 
significant increase in the levels of both catecholamines, which indicates on 
the activation of the sympathoadrenal system (SAS), just as it occurs in aging 
and stress (stress-age-syndrome by V.V. Frolkis). Daily features of SAS 
reactions to light stress were revealed. Based on these data it can be concluded 
that one of the reduction mechanisms of life expectancy at hypopinealizm is 
excessive and prolonged activation of SAS.

BACKGROUND: An estimated 850,000 people have diabetes without knowing it and as 
many as 7 million more are at high risk of developing it. Within the NHS Health 
Checks programme, blood glucose testing can be undertaken using a fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG) or a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test but the relative 
cost-effectiveness of these is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness of screening for type 
2 diabetes using a HbA1c test versus a FPG test. In addition, to compare the use 
of a random capillary glucose (RCG) test versus a non-invasive risk score to 
prioritise individuals who should undertake a HbA1c or FPG test.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using the Sheffield Type 2 Diabetes Model to 
model lifetime incidence of complications, costs and health benefits of 
screening.
SETTING: England; population in the 40-74-years age range eligible for a NHS 
health check.
DATA SOURCES: The Leicester Ethnic Atherosclerosis and Diabetes Risk (LEADER) 
data set was used to analyse prevalence and screening outcomes for a multiethnic 
population. Alternative prevalence rates were obtained from the literature or 
through personal communication.
METHODS: (1) Modelling of screening pathways to determine the cost per case 
detected followed by long-term modelling of glucose progression and 
complications associated with hyperglycaemia; and (2) calculation of the costs 
and health-related quality of life arising from complications and calculation of 
overall cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), net monetary benefit and the 
likelihood of cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Based on the LEADER data set from a multiethnic population, the results 
indicate that screening using a HbA1c test is more cost-effective than using a 
FPG. For National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)-recommended 
screening strategies, HbA1c leads to a cost saving of £12 and a QALY gain of 
0.0220 per person when a risk score is used as a prescreen. With no prescreen, 
the cost saving is £30 with a QALY gain of 0.0224. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis indicates that the likelihood of HbA1c being more cost-effective than 
FPG is 98% and 95% with and without a risk score, respectively. One-way 
sensitivity analyses indicate that the results based on prevalence in the LEADER 
data set are insensitive to a variety of alternative assumptions. However, where 
a region of the country has a very different joint HbA1c and FPG distribution 
from the LEADER data set such that a FPG test yields a much higher prevalence of 
high-risk cases relative to HbA1c, FPG may be more cost-effective. The degree to 
which the FPG-based prevalence would have to be higher depends very much on the 
uncertain relative uptake rates of the two tests. Using a risk score such as the 
Leicester Practice Database Score (LPDS) appears to be more cost-effective than 
using a RCG test to identify individuals with the highest risk of diabetes who 
should undergo blood testing.
LIMITATIONS: We did not include rescreening because there was an absence of 
required relevant evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the multiethnic LEADER population, among individuals 
currently attending NHS Health Checks, it is more cost-effective to screen for 
diabetes using a HbA1c test than using a FPG test. However, in some localities, 
the prevalence of diabetes and high risk of diabetes may be higher for FPG 
relative to HbA1c than in the LEADER cohort. In such cases, whether or not it 
still holds that HbA1c is likely to be more cost-effective than FPG depends on 
the relative uptake rates for HbA1c and FPG. Use of the LPDS appears to be more 
cost-effective than a RCG test for prescreening.

OBJECTIVE: To measure the economic burden of diabetes in Argentina by age, 
gender and region for the year 2005, in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
METHODS: DALYs were estimated by the sum of years of life lost due to premature 
death (YLL) and years of life lived with disability (YLD).
RESULTS: In the population studied (20 to 85 years), the burden of diabetes 
without complications was 1.3 million DALYs, 85% of which were caused by 
disabilities. Whereas mortality rates (YLL) increased as a function of age, YLD 
showed the opposite relationship. Women had higher burden of disease values, 
represented by 51 and 61% of YLL and YLD, respectively, independently of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that disabilities are a key component of 
diabetes burden; its regular and systematic estimation would allow to design 
effective prevention strategies, to assess the impact of their implementation 
and to optimize resource allocation based on objective evidence.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the characteristics of 
digestive organ cancer mortality and the potential years of life lost in Inner 
Mongolia, and to provide evidence for the prevention of digestive organ cancers.
METHODS: Using data from the Death Registry System from 2009 to 2012, we 
classified male and female cancer deaths according to the International 
Classification of Disease (10th revision). The mortality and potential years of 
life lost were calculated for digestive organ cancers in Inner Mongolia. The 
average years of life lost was calculated.
RESULTS: Digestive organ cancer mortality in Inner Mongolia was higher in men 
than in women. The potential years of life lost were also much higher in men 
than in women. Gallbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal, anus, and 
anal canal cancer were the most prominent contributors to mortality. Esophageal 
cancer was the most prominent contributor to potential years of life lost, and 
was the leading cause of average years of life lost in both sexes.
CONCLUSION: Liver cancer and stomach cancer mortality and the potential years of 
life lost to liver and stomach cancer are demonstrably higher in Inner Mongolia. 
Although esophageal cancer mortality was not the highest of the digestive organ 
cancers, the average years of life lost to esophageal was the highest for both 
sexes, and it should therefore be targeted for prevention.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to quantify the benefits and harms of 
mammography screening after age 74 years, focusing on the amount of 
overdiagnosis of invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
METHODS: Three well-established microsimulation models were used to simulate a 
cohort of American women born in 1960. All women received biennial screening 
starting at age 50 years with cessation ages varying from 74 up to 96 years. We 
estimated the number of life-years gained (LYG), quality-adjusted life-years, 
breast cancer deaths averted, false-positives, and overdiagnosed women per 1000 
screens.
RESULTS: The models predicted that there were 7.8 to 11.4 LYG per 1000 screens 
at age 74 years (range across models), decreasing to 4.8 to 7.8 LYG per 1000 
screens at age 80 years, and 1.4 to 2.4 LYG per 1000 screens at age 90 years. 
When adjusted for quality-of-life decrements, the LYG decreased by 5% to 13% at 
age 74 years and 11% to 22% at age 80 years. At age 90 to 92 years, all LYG were 
counterbalanced by a loss in quality-of-life, mainly because of the increasing 
number of overdiagnosed breast cancers per 1000 screens: 1.2 to 5.0 at age 74 
years, 1.8 to 6.0 at age 80 years, and 3.7 to 7.5 at age 90 years. The age at 
which harms began to outweigh benefits shifted to a younger age when larger or 
longer utility losses because of a breast cancer diagnosis were assumed.
CONCLUSION: The balance between screening benefits and harms becomes less 
favorable after age 74 years. At age 90 years, harms outweigh benefits, largely 
as a consequence of overdiagnosis. This age was the same across the three 
models, despite important model differences in assumptions on DCIS.

Rates of initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT), use of home modalities 
of treatment and patient outcomes vary considerably between countries. This 
paper reports the methods and baseline characteristics of countries 
participating in the EVEREST study (n = 46), a global collaboration examining 
the association between medical and non-medical factors and RRT incidence, 
modality mix and survival. Numbers of incident and prevalent patients were 
collected for current (2003-05) and historic (1983-85, 1988-90, 1993-95 and 
1998-2000) periods stratified, where available, by age, gender, treatment 
modality and cause of end stage renal disease (diabetic versus non-diabetic). 
General population age and health indicators and national-level macroeconomic 
data were collected from secondary data sources. National experts provided 
primary data on renal service funding, resources and organization. The median 
(inter quartile range) RRT incidence per million of the population (pmp) was 130 
pmp (102-167 pmp). The general population life expectancy at 60 was 22.1 years 
(19.7-23.1 years) and 6.9% had diabetes mellitus (5.4-9.0%). Healthcare spending 
as a percentage of gross domestic product was 8.1% (5.6-9.3%). Countries 
averaged nine dialysis facilities pmp (4-12 pmp), with 69.0% (43.9-99.0%) owned 
by the public or private not-for-profit sector. The number of nephrologists 
ranged from 0.5 to 48 pmp (median 12 pmp). The heterogeneity of EVEREST 
countries will enable modelling to examine the independent association between 
medical and non-medical factors on RRT epidemiology.

Primary glomerular diseases in the elderly.

Sumnu A(1), Gursu M(1), Ozturk S(1).

(1)Abdullah Sumnu, Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, 34390 Istanbul, 
Turkey.

Primary glomerular diseases in the elderly population are a frustrating topic 
due to difficulties in both the diagnosis and decision making about treatment. 
The most frequent type of primary glomerular disease in elderly is membranous 
nephropathy; while its counterpart in younger population is IgA nephropathy. The 
most frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome in the elderly is also membranous 
nephropathy. Pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) rate increases both 
in elderly and very elderly population. Pauci-immune crescentic GNs should be 
regarded as urgencies in elderly patients as in their younger counterparts due 
to potential for causing end-stage renal disease in case of delayed diagnosis 
and treatment, and also causing mortality due to alveolar hemorrhage in patients 
with pulmonary involvement. Renal biopsy is the inevitable diagnostic method in 
the elderly as in all other age groups. Renal biopsy prevents unnecessary 
treatments and provides prognostic data. So advanced age should not be the sole 
contraindication for renal biopsy. The course of primary glomerular diseases may 
differ in the elderly population. Acute kidney injury is more frequent in the 
course and renal functions may be worse at presentation. These patients are more 
prone to be hypertensive. The decision about adding immune suppressive therapies 
to conservative methods should be made considering many factors like 
co-morbidities, drug side effects and potential drug interactions, risk of 
infection, patient preference, life expectancy and renal functions at the time 
of diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of 
saxagliptin + metformin (SAXA + MET) vs glimepiride + metformin (GLI + MET) in 
patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled with MET 
in China.
METHODS: The Cardiff Model was used to simulate disease progression and estimate 
the long-term effect of treatments on patients. Systematic literature reviews 
and hospital surveys were conducted to obtain patients profiles, clinical data, 
and costs. Health insurance costs (2014¥) were estimated over a 40-year period. 
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: SAXA + MET had lower predicted incidences of cardiovascular and 
hypoglycemia events and a decreased total cost compared with GLI + MET 
(¥241,072,807 vs ¥285,455,177). There were increased numbers of quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs; 1.01/patient) and life-years (Lys; 0.03/patient) gained with 
SAXA + MET compared with GLI + MET, and the incremental cost of SAXA + MET vs 
GLI + MET (-¥44,382) resulted in -¥43,883/QALY and -¥1,710,926/LY gained with 
SAXA + MET. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that the results were robust.
CONCLUSION: In patients with T2DM in China, SAXA + MET was more cost-effective 
and was well tolerated with fewer adverse effects (AEs) compared with GLI + MET. 
As a second-line therapy for T2DM, SAXA may address some of the unmet medical 
needs attributable to AEs in the treatment of T2DM.

Cost-utility of cognitive behavioral therapy for low back pain from the 
commercial payer perspective.

STUDY DESIGN: Markov cost-utility model.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
for the treatment of persistent nonspecific low back pain (LBP) from the 
perspective of US commercial payers.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: CBT is widely deemed clinically effective for LBP 
treatment. The evidence is suggestive of cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: We constructed and validated a Markov intention-to-treat model to 
estimate the cost-utility of CBT, with 1-year and 10-year time horizons. We 
applied likelihood of improvement and utilities from a randomized controlled 
trial assessing CBT to treat LBP. The trial randomized subjects to treatment but 
subjects freely sought health care services. We derived the cost of equivalent 
rates and types of services from US commercial claims for LBP for a similar 
population. For the 10-year estimates, we derived recurrence rates from the 
literature. The base case included medical and pharmaceutical services and 
assumed gradual loss of skill in applying CBT techniques. Sensitivity analyses 
assessed the distribution of service utilization, utility values, and rate of 
LBP recurrence. We compared health plan designs. Results are based on 5000 
iterations of each model and expressed as an incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-utility of CBT was $7197 per quality-adjusted 
life-year in the first year and $5855 per quality-adjusted life-year over 10 
years. The results are robust across numerous sensitivity analyses. No change of 
parameter estimate resulted in a difference of more than 7% from the base case 
for either time horizon. Including chiropractic and/or acupuncture care did not 
substantively affect cost-effectiveness. The model with medical but no 
pharmaceutical costs was more cost-effective ($5238 for 1 yr and $3849 for 10 
yr).
CONCLUSION: CBT is a cost-effective approach to manage chronic LBP among 
commercial health plans members. Cost-effectiveness is demonstrated for multiple 
plan designs.

2,2',4,4'-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), a low-brominated Tetra-BDE that is 
widely distributed in the marine ecosystem, was selected to investigate the 
reproductive toxicity on the rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis, and the possible 
mechanism based on antioxidant defense system changes were studied. The results 
showed the following: (1) A low concentration of BDE-47 had a slight effect on 
the egg production of individual females and the egg production rate (EPR) of 
the population. In fact, BDE-47 exerted reproductive inhibition effects in a 
time- and concentration-dependent manner. The obtained life tables indicated 
that BDE-47 at a high concentration prolonged the generation time, whereas low 
and moderate concentrations of BDE-47 had the opposite effects. BDE-47 at a 
medium concentration significantly decreased the life expectancy and net 
reproductive rate (P<0.05). Additionally, a high concentration of BDE-47 
markedly decreased the net reproductive rate and intrinsic increase rate 
(P<0.05). The ultra-structure of the ovary showed that BDE-47 severely damaged 
the ovary. (2) BDE-47 stress elevated the ROS level in B. plicatilis. The GST 
activity was induced significantly by the low concentration of BDE-47 and 
inhibited by the highest concentration tested. The GPx activity and GSH content 
were significant decreased in all the tested groups, and GR activity was 
induced. GST and GSH appeared to be sensitive to oxidative stress, and all of 
the glutathione-related enzymes were found to play an important role in 
maintaining the antioxidant/pro-oxidant balance based on Pearson's correlation 
analysis. The results indicated that BDE-47 causes reproductive toxicity in B. 
plicatilis and that the ROS-mediated pathway is responsible for the observed 
toxicity.

AIM: This study aims to analyze the impacts of a range of clinical evidence 
generation scenarios associated with comparative effectiveness research (CER) on 
pharmaceutical innovation.
MATERIALS & METHODS: We used the Global Pharmaceutical Policy Model to project 
the effect of changes in pharmaceutical producer costs, revenues and timings on 
drug innovation and health for the age 55+ populations in the USA and Europe 
through year 2060 using three clinical scenarios.
RESULTS: Changes in producer incentives from widespread CER evidence generation 
and use had varied but often large predicted impacts on simulated outcomes in 
2060. Effect on the number of new drug introductions ranged from a 81.1% 
reduction to a 45.5% increase, and the effect on population-level life 
expectancy ranged from a 15.6% reduction to a 11.4% increase compared to 
baseline estimates.
CONCLUSION: The uncertainty surrounding the consequences of increased clinical 
evidence generation and use on innovation calls for a carefully measured 
approach to CER implementation, balancing near-term benefits to spending and 
health with long-term implications for innovation.

California.

Few areas of spinal surgery present a greater challenge than management of 
occipitocervical abnormalities. This is due to the simultaneous presence of two 
commanding, yet conflicting treatment principles. First, decompression and 
protection of the spinal cord at this level is synonymous with the presevation 
of life itself. Second, however, the degree of cervical movements at this 
junction is unprecedented in the spine, requiring the preservation movement yet 
stabilization of discrete motion segemnts. The interrelation of these two 
critical functions is realized in the complex arrangement of the C0- C1-C2 
anatomic configuration. The occipitocervical junction is responsible for 50% of 
the 90 degrees of head rotation. In addition, 10-15 degrees of flexion and 
extension are added to the subaxial cervical spine by C0-C1-C2.This duality of 
function is the primary reasin for the complexity of the facet joints in this 
location. No lateral bending occurs at this level.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common retinal diseases world-wide. 
It has a complex pathology that involves the vasculature of the inner retina and 
breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier. Extensive research has determined that 
DR is not only a vascular disease but also has a neurodegenerative component and 
that essentially all types of cells in the retina are affected, leading to 
chronic loss of visual function. A great deal of work using animal models of DR 
has established the loss of neurons and pathology of other cell types, including 
supporting glial cells. There has also been an increased emphasis on measuring 
retinal function in the models, as well as further validation and extension of 
the animal studies by clinical and translational research. This article will 
attempt to summarize the more recent developments in research towards 
understanding the complexities of retinal neurodegeneration and functional 
vision loss in DR.

Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have potent antimicrobial properties at 
concentrations far below those that cause cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in 
eukaryotic cells. This property has resulted in the widespread use of AgNPs in 
consumer products, leading to environmental exposures at sub-lethal levels 
through ingestion and inhalation. Although the toxicity of AgNPs has been well 
characterized, effects of environmentally relevant exposures have not been 
extensively investigated in spite of studies that suggest accumulation of silver 
in tissues, including brain. To assess the sublethal effects of AgNPs on neural 
cell function, we used cultured SVZ-NSCs, a model of neurogenesis and neural 
cells. Throughout life, neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone 
(SVZ) of the lateral ventricles proliferate and migrate via the rostral 
migratory stream to the olfactory bulb. Once there, they complete 
differentiation into neurons and glia and integrate into existing circuits. This 
process of neurogenesis is tightly regulated, and is considered a part of 
healthy brain function. We found that 1.0 μg/mL AgNP exposure in cultured 
differentiating NSCs induced the formation of f-actin inclusions, indicating a 
disruption of actin function. These inclusions did not co-localize with AgNPs, 
and therefore do not represent sequestered nanoparticles. Further, AgNP exposure 
led to a reduction in neurite extension and branching in live cells, 
cytoskeleton-mediated processes vital to neurogenesis. We conclude that AgNPs at 
sublethal concentrations disrupt actin dynamics in SVZ-NSCs, and that an 
associated disruption in neurogenesis may contribute to documented deficits in 
brain function following AgNP exposure.

BACKGROUND: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), especially multidrug-resistant 
(MDR, resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid) disease, is associated with a 
worse patient outcome. Drug resistance diagnosed using microbiological culture 
takes days to weeks, as TB bacteria grow slowly. Rapid molecular tests for drug 
resistance detection (1 day) are commercially available and may promote faster 
initiation of appropriate treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To (1) conduct a systematic review of evidence regarding diagnostic 
accuracy of molecular genetic tests for drug resistance, (2) conduct a 
health-economic evaluation of screening and diagnostic strategies, including 
comparison of alternative models of service provision and assessment of the 
value of targeting rapid testing at high-risk subgroups, and (3) construct a 
transmission-dynamic mathematical model that translates the estimates of 
diagnostic accuracy into estimates of clinical impact.
REVIEW METHODS AND DATA SOURCES: A standardised search strategy identified 
relevant studies from EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, Bioscience Information Service 
(BIOSIS), System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe Social Policy & 
Practice (SIGLE) and Web of Science, published between 1 January 2000 and 15 
August 2013. Additional 'grey' sources were included. Quality was assessed using 
quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies version 2 (QUADAS-2). For each 
diagnostic strategy and population subgroup, a care pathway was constructed to 
specify which medical treatments and health services that individuals would 
receive from presentation to the point where they either did or did not complete 
TB treatment successfully. A total cost was estimated from a health service 
perspective for each care pathway, and the health impact was estimated in terms 
of the mean discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost as a result of 
disease and treatment. Costs and QALYs were both discounted at 3.5% per year. An 
integrated transmission-dynamic and economic model was used to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of introducing rapid molecular testing (in addition to 
culture and drug sensitivity testing). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was 
performed to evaluate the impact on cost-effectiveness of diagnostic and 
treatment time delays, diagnosis and treatment costs, and associated QALYs.
RESULTS: A total of 8922 titles and abstracts were identified, with 557 papers 
being potentially eligible. Of these, 56 studies contained sufficient test 
information for analysis. All three commercial tests performed well when 
detecting drug resistance in clinical samples, although with evidence of 
heterogeneity between studies. Pooled sensitivity for GenoType® MTBDRplus (Hain 
Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) (isoniazid and rifampicin resistance), INNO-LiPA 
Rif.TB® (Fujirebio Europe, Ghent, Belgium) (rifampicin resistance) and Xpert® 
MTB/RIF (Cepheid Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) (rifampicin resistance) was 83.4%, 
94.6%, 95.4% and 96.8%, respectively; equivalent pooled specificity was 99.6%, 
98.2%, 99.7% and 98.4%, respectively. Results of the transmission model suggest 
that all of the rapid assays considered here, if added to the current diagnostic 
pathway, would be cost-saving and achieve a reduction in expected QALY loss 
compared with current practice. GenoType MTBDRplus appeared to be the most 
cost-effective of the rapid tests in the South Asian population, although 
results were similar for GeneXpert. In all other scenarios GeneXpert appeared to 
be the most cost-effective strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid molecular tests for rifampicin and isoniazid resistance were 
sensitive and specific. They may also be cost-effective when added to culture 
drug susceptibility testing in the UK. There is global interest in point-of-care 
testing and further work is needed to review the performance of emerging tests 
and the wider health-economic impact of decentralised testing in clinics and 
primary care, as well as non-health-care settings, such as shelters and prisons.

This study involved the development of a model for evaluating the potential 
costs and benefits of ozone control by activated carbon filtration in 
single-family homes. The modeling effort included the prediction of indoor ozone 
with and without activated carbon filtration in the HVAC system. As one 
application, the model was used to predict benefit-to-cost ratios for 
single-family homes in 12 American cities in five different climate zones. 
Health benefits were evaluated using disability-adjusted life-years and included 
city-specific age demographics for each simulation. Costs of commercially 
available activated carbon filters included capital cost differences when 
compared to conventional HVAC filters of similar particle removal efficiency, 
energy penalties due to additional pressure drop, and regional utility rates. 
The average indoor ozone removal effectiveness ranged from 4 to 20% across the 
12 target cities and was largely limited by HVAC system operation time. For the 
parameters selected in this study, the mean predicted benefit-to-cost ratios for 
1-inch filters were >1.0 in 10 of the 12 cities. The benefits of residential 
activated carbon filters were greatest in cities with high seasonal ozone and 
HVAC usage, suggesting the importance of targeting such conditions for activated 
carbon filter applications.

BACKGROUND: The number of breast cancer survivors has increased since 1990 due 
to advances in biomedical technology that lead to an increase in early diagnosis 
and treatment. Research on survivorship has focused on the psychological and 
treatment aspects of the disease. The goal of this study was focused on 
exploring the lived experiences of breast cancer survivors from diagnosis, 
treatment and beyond.
OBJECTIVE: To understand the lived experiences of women who are breast cancer 
survivors.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A purposive sampling strategy was used to 
recruit participants from two Missouri cancer centres. A total of 15 women 
breast cancer survivors were interviewed.
FINDINGS: Three major themes emerged that described the lived experiences of the 
women. These were factors from the diagnosis and treatment management impacting 
survivorship, relationship and support system and implication of survivorship. 
Participants noted that coping with the diagnosis and treatment was a stressful 
journey and required lots of adjustment and changes. Some developed various 
techniques such as journaling their activities which provided comfort. In 
addition, support from family was shared as the key which gave them strength and 
courage through the different stages of treatment. However, they found it 
difficult to articulate what survivorship meant.
CONCLUSION: Using in-depth interview techniques, this study shed light on the 
experiences of women who were diagnosed with breast cancer and have completed 
treatment. They acknowledged frustration with their diagnosis and body changes. 
Support received from family and friends helped them cope through their 
treatment. However, they felt abandoned once the treatment phase was over and 
were uncertain what survivorhood meant to them.

A handheld flow genetic analysis system (FGAS): towards rapid, sensitive, 
quantitative and multiplex molecular diagnosis at the point-of-care level.

A handheld flow genetic analysis system (FGAS) is proposed for rapid, sensitive, 
multiplex and real-time quantification of nucleic acids at the point-of-care 
(POC) level. The FGAS includes a helical thermal-gradient microreactor and a 
microflow actuator, as well as control circuitry for temperature, fluid and 
power management, and smartphone fluorescence imaging. All of these features are 
integrated into a field-portable and easy-to-use molecular diagnostic platform 
powered by lithium batteries. Due to the unique design of the microreactor, not 
only steady temperatures for denaturation and annealing/extension but also a 
linear thermal gradient for spatial high-resolution melting can be achieved 
through simply maintaining a single heater at constant temperature. The 
smartphone fluorescence imaging system has a wide field of view that captures 
all PCR channels of the microreactor in a single snapshot without the need for 
any mechanical scanning. By these designs, the FGAS enables real-time monitoring 
of the temporal and spatial fluorescence signatures of amplicons during 
continuous-flow amplification. On the current FGAS, visual detection of as 
little as 10 copies per μL of genomic DNA of Salmonella enterica was achieved in 
15 min, with real-time quantitative detection of the DNA over 6 orders of 
magnitude concentration from 10(6) to 10(1) copies per μL also completed in 
7.5-15 min. In addition, multiple pathogenic DNA targets could be simultaneously 
discriminated with direct bar-chart readout or multiplex spatial melting in 
serial flow. We anticipate that the FGAS has great potential to become a 
next-generation gene analyzer for POC molecular diagnostics.

Hope in severe disease: a review of the literature on the construct and the 
tools for assessing hope in the psycho-oncologic setting.

- Italy.

AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Research on the topic of hope began a long time ago but, 
more recently, interest in this construct has focused mainly on the development 
of psychometric tools for its assessment. The 2 steps of the present article are 
defining the construct of hope by completing a preliminary review of the 
literature and analyzing the tools used to assess hope in the setting of 
oncologic medicine, conducting a systematic review of the existing scientific 
literature.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Our study was conducted in 2 stages. The first stage 
involved a nonsystematic preliminary review of the literature, the second a 
systematic search in all the medical journals contained in the Medline database 
as of 2012. The literature identified at the first stage was divided according 
to several topical categories, i.e., theoretical, empirical, and clinical works 
on the construct of hope. In the second systematic search, we identified the 
main psychometric tools used to measure hope in the field of clinical oncology 
and assessed their validity.
RESULTS: A total of 22 articles were identified. What emerged when we pooled the 
findings of our 2 lines of research was that, despite its broad theoretical 
definitions, the construct of hope can be broken down to a few constituent 
elements when hope is studied using currently available psychometric tools. In 
particular, these identified constituent elements were coping, spiritual 
well-being, quality of life, distress, and depression.
CONCLUSIONS: The factors contained in the construct of hope include temporality, 
future, expectancy, motivation, and interconnectedness. The review of the 
scientific literature does not reveal a clear definition of hope. 
Multidisciplinary studies are needed to communicate different perspectives 
(medical, psychological, spiritual, theological) among each other for better 
definition of the constituent elements of hope in order to support the hope with 
specific interventions.
