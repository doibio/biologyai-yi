BACKGROUND: Hypertension remains the leading risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) worldwide, and its impact in Brazil should be assessed in order to 
better address the issue. We aimed to describe trends in prevalence and burden 
of disease attributable to high systolic blood pressure (HSBP) among Brazilians 
≥ 25 years old according to sex and federal units (FU) using the Global Burden 
of Disease (GBD) 2017 estimates.
METHODS: We used the comparative risk assessment developed for the GBD study to 
estimate trends in attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALY), by sex, and FU for HSBP from 1990 to 2017. This study included 14 
HSBP-outcome pairs. HSBP was defined as ≥ 140 mmHg for prevalence estimates, and 
a theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) of 110-115 mmHg was considered 
for disease burden. We estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs attributed to 
HSBP. We also explored the drivers of trends in HSBP burden, as well as the 
correlation between disease burden and sociodemographic development index (SDI).
RESULTS: In Brazil, the prevalence of HSBP is 18.9% (95% uncertainty intervals 
[UI] 18.5-19.3%), with an annual 0.4% increase rate, while age-standardized 
death rates attributable to HSBP decreased from 189.2 (95%UI 168.5-209.2) deaths 
to 104.8 (95%UI 94.9-114.4) deaths per 100,000 from 1990 to 2017. In spite of 
that, the total number of deaths attributable to HSBP increased 53.4% and HSBP 
raised from 3rd to 1st position, as the leading risk factor for deaths during 
the period. Regarding total DALYs, HSBP raised from 4th in 1990 to 2nd cause in 
2017. The main driver of change of HSBP burden is population aging. Across FUs, 
the reduction in the age-standardized death rates attributable to HSBP 
correlated with higher SDI.
CONCLUSIONS: While HSBP prevalence shows an increasing trend, age-standardized 
death and DALY rates are decreasing in Brazil, probably as results of successful 
public policies for CVD secondary prevention and control, but suboptimal control 
of its determinants. Reduction was more significant in FUs with higher SDI, 
suggesting that the effect of health policies was heterogeneous. Moreover, HSBP 
has become the main risk factor for death in Brazil, mainly due to population 
aging.

BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2017 database permits an 
up-to-date evaluation of the frequency and burden of diabetes at the state level 
in Brazil and by type of diabetes. The objective of this report is to describe, 
using these updated GBD data, the current and projected future burden of 
diabetes and hyperglycemia in Brazil, as well as its variation over time and 
space.
METHODS: We derived all estimates using the GBD 2016 and 2017 databases to 
characterize disease burden related to diabetes and hyperglycemia in Brazil, 
from 1990 to 2040, using standard GBD methodologies.
RESULTS: The overall estimated prevalence of diabetes in Brazil in 2017 was 4.4% 
(95%UI 4.0-4.9%), with 4.0% of those with diabetes being identified as having 
type 1 disease. While the crude prevalence of type 1 disease has remained 
relatively stable from 1990, type 2 prevalence has increased 30% for males and 
26% for females. In 2017, approximately 3.3% of all disability-adjusted life 
years lost were due to diabetes and 5.9% to hyperglycemia. Diabetes prevalence 
and mortality were highest in the Northeast region and growing fastest in the 
North, Northeast, and Center-West regions. Over this period, despite a slight 
decrease in age-standardized incidence of type 2 diabetes, crude overall burden 
due to hyperglycemia has increased 19%, with population aging being a main cause 
for this rise. Cardiovascular diseases, responsible for 38.3% of this burden in 
1990, caused only 25.9% of it in 2017, with premature mortality attributed 
directly to diabetes causing 31.6% of the 2017 burden. Future projections 
suggest that the diabetes mortality burden will increase 144% by 2040, more than 
twice the expected increase in crude disease burden overall (54%). By 2040, 
diabetes is projected to be Brazil's third leading cause of death and 
hyperglycemia its third leading risk factor, in terms of deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden in Brazil attributable to diabetes and 
hyperglycemia, already large, is predicted by GBD estimates to more than double 
to 2040. Strong actions by the Ministry of Health are necessary to 
counterbalance the major deleterious effects of population aging.

BACKGROUND: Estimates of completeness of death registration are crucial to 
produce estimates of life tables and population projections and to estimate the 
burden of disease. They are an important step in assessing the quality of data. 
In the case of subnational data analysis in Brazil, it is important to consider 
spatial and temporal variation in the quality of mortality data. There are two 
main sources of data quality evaluation in Brazil, but there are few comparative 
studies and how they evolve over time. The aim of the paper is to compare and 
discuss alternative estimates of completeness of death registration, adult 
mortality (45q15) and life expectancy estimates produced by the National 
Statistics Office (IBGE), Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), 
and estimates presented in Queiroz et al. (2017) and Schmertmann and Gonzaga 
(2018), for 1980 and 2010.
METHODS: We provide a descriptive and comparative analysis of aforementioned 
estimates from four (4) sources of estimates at subnational level (26 states and 
one Federal District) in Brazil from two different points in time.
RESULTS: We found significant differences in estimates that affect both levels 
and trends of completeness of adult mortality in Brazil and states. IHME and 
Queiroz et al. (2017) estimates converge by 2010, but there are large 
differences when compared to estimates from the National Statistics Office 
(IBGE). Larger differences are observed for less developed states. We have 
showed that the quality of mortality data in Brazil has improved steadily 
overtime, but with large regional variations. However, we have observed that 
IBGE estimates show the lowest levels of completeness for the Northern of the 
country compared to other estimates. Choice of methods and approaches might lead 
to very unexpected results.
CONCLUSION: We produced a detailed comparative analysis of estimates of 
completeness of death registration from different sources and discuss the main 
results and possible explanations for these differences. We have also showed 
that new improved methods are still needed to study adult mortality in less 
developed countries and at a subnational level. More comparative studies are 
important in order to improve quality of estimates in Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Monitoring and reducing premature mortality due to non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs) is a global priority of Agenda 2030. This study aimed to 
describe the mortality trends and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost 
due to NCDs between 1990 and 2017 for Brazil and to project those for 2030 as 
well as the risk factors (RFs) attributed deaths according to estimates of the 
Global Burden of Disease Study.
METHODS: We analyzed cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, 
neoplasms, and diabetes, and compared the mortality rates in 1990 and 2017 for 
all of Brazil and states. The study used the definition of premature mortality 
(30-69 years) that is used by the World Health Organization. The number of 
deaths, mortality rates, DALYs, and years of life lost (YLL) were used to 
compare 1990 and 2017. We analyzed the YLL for NCDs attributable to RFs.
RESULTS: There was a reduction of 35.3% from 509.1 deaths/100,000 inhabitants 
(1990) to 329.6 deaths/100,000 inhabitants due to NCDs in 2017. The DALY rate 
decreased by 33.6%, and the YLL rate decreased by 36.0%. There were reductions 
in NCDs rates in all 27 states. The main RFs related to premature deaths by NCDs 
in 2017 among women were high body mass index (BMI), dietary risks, high 
systolic blood pressure, and among men, dietary risks, high systolic blood 
pressure, tobacco, and high BMI. Trends in mortality rates due to NCDs declined 
during the study period; however, after 2015, the curve reversed, and rates 
fluctuated and tended to increase.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlighted a decline in premature mortality rates from 
NCDs nationwide and in all states. There was a greater reduction in deaths from 
cardiovascular diseases, followed by respiratory diseases, and we observed a 
minor reduction for those from diabetes and neoplasms. The observed fluctuations 
in mortality rates over the last 3 years indicate that if no further action is 
taken, we may not achieve the NCD Sustainable Development Goals. These findings 
draw attention to the consequences of austerity measures in a socially unequal 
setting with great regional disparities in which the majority of the population 
is dependent on state social policies.

BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be an important cause of fatal and 
non-fatal burden in Brazil. In this study, we present estimates for TB burden in 
Brazil from 1990 to 2017 using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017).
METHODS: This descriptive study used GBD 2017 findings to report years of life 
lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) of TB in Brazil by sex, age group, HIV status, and Brazilian 
states, from 1990 to 2017. We also present the TB burden attributable to 
independent risk factors such as smoking, alcohol use, and diabetes. Results are 
reported in absolute number and age-standardized rates (per 100,000 inhabitants) 
with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).
RESULTS: In 2017, the number of DALYs due to TB (HIV-negative and HIV-positive 
combined) in Brazil was 284,323 (95% UI: 240,269-349,265). Among HIV-negative 
individuals, the number of DALYs was 196,366 (95% UI: 189,645-202,394), while 
87,957 DALYs (95% UI: 50,624-146,870) were estimated among HIV-positive 
individuals. Between 1990 and 2017, the absolute number and age-standardized 
rates of DALYs due to TB at the national level decreased by 47.0% and 68.5%, 
respectively. In 2017, the sex-age-specific TB burden was highest among males 
and in children under-1 year and the age groups 45-59 years. The Brazilian 
states with the highest age-standardized DALY rates in 2017 were Rio de Janeiro, 
Pernambuco, and Amazonas. Age-standardized DALY rates decreased for all 27 
Brazilian states between 1990 and 2017. Alcohol use accounted for 47.5% of 
national DALYs due to TB among HIV-negative individuals in 2017, smoking for 
17.9%, and diabetes for 7.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: GBD 2017 results show that, despite the remarkable progress in 
reducing the DALY rates during the period, TB remains as an important and 
preventable cause of health lost to due premature death and disability in 
Brazil. The findings reinforce the importance of strengthening TB control 
strategies in Brazil through integrated and multisectoral actions that enable 
the access to prevention, early diagnosis, and timely treatment, with emphasis 
on high-risk groups and populations most vulnerable to the disease in the 
country.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence and burden of disease resulting from obesity have 
increased worldwide. In Brazil, more than half of the population is now 
overweight. However, the impact of this growing risk factor on disease burden 
remains inexact. Using the 2017 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) results, this 
study sought to estimate mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
lost to non-communicable diseases caused by high body mass index (BMI) in both 
sexes and across age categories. This study also aimed to describe the 
prevalence of overweight and obesity throughout the states of Brazil.
METHODS: Age-standardized prevalence of overweight and obesity were estimated 
between 1990 and 2017. A comparative risk assessment was applied to estimate 
DALYs and deaths for non-communicable diseases and for all causes linked to high 
BMI.
RESULTS: The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased during the period of 
analysis. Overall, age-standardized prevalence of obesity in Brazil was higher 
in females (29.8%) than in males (24.6%) in 2017; however, since 1990, males 
have presented greater rise in obesity (244.1%) than females (165.7%). Increases 
in prevalence burden were greatest in states from the North and Northeast 
regions of Brazil. Overall, burden due to high BMI also increased from 1990 to 
2017. In 2017, high BMI was responsible for 12.3% (8.8-16.1%) of all deaths and 
8.4% (6.3-10.7%) of total DALYs lost to non-communicable diseases, up from 7.2% 
(4.1-10.8%), and 4.6% (2.4-6.0%) in 1990, respectively. Change due to risk 
exposure is the leading contributor to the growth of BMI burden in Brazil. In 
2017, high BMI was responsible for 165,954 deaths and 5,095,125 DALYs. 
Cardiovascular disease and diabetes have proven to be the most prevalent causes 
of deaths, along with DALYs caused by high BMI, regardless of sex or state.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates increasing age-standardized prevalence of 
obesity in all Brazilian states. High BMI plays an important role in disease 
burdens in terms of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and all causes of 
mortality. Assessing levels and trends in exposures to high BMI and the 
resulting disease burden highlights the current priority for primary prevention 
and public health action initiatives focused on obesity.

BACKGROUND: Brazil leads the world in number of firearm deaths and ranks sixth 
by country in rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people. This study aims to 
analyze trends in and burden of mortality by firearms, according to age and sex, 
for Brazil, and the association between these deaths and indicators of 
possession and carrying of weapons using data from the global burden of 
diseases, injuries, and risk factors study (GBD) 2017.
METHODS: We used GBD 2017 estimates of mortality due to physical violence and 
self-harm from firearms for Brazil to analyze the association between deaths by 
firearms and explanatory variables.
RESULTS: Deaths from firearms increased in Brazil from 25,819 in 1990 to 48,493 
in 2017. Firearm mortality rates were higher among men and in the 20-24 age 
group; the rate was 20 times higher than for women in the same age group. 
Homicide rates increased during the study period, while mortality rates for 
suicides and accidental deaths decreased. The group of Brazilian federation 
units with the highest firearm collection rate (median = 7.5) showed reductions 
in the rate of total violent deaths by firearms. In contrast, the group with the 
lowest firearm collection rate (median = 2.0) showed an increase in firearm 
deaths from 2000 to 2017. An increase in the rate of voluntary return of 
firearms was associated with a reduction in mortality rates of unintentional 
firearm deaths (r = -0.364, p < 0.001). An increase in socio-demographic index 
(SDI) was associated with a reduction in all firearm death rates (r = -0.266, p 
= 0.008). An increase in the composite index of firearms seized or collected was 
associated with a reduction in rates of deaths by firearm in the subgroup of 
females, children, and the elderly (r = -0.269, p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a change in the trend of firearms deaths after the 
beginning of the collection of weapons in 2004. Federation units that collected 
more guns have reduced rates of violent firearm deaths.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women and 
the leading cause of cancer death among females worldwide. In recent decades, 
breast cancer death rates have been stable or decreasing in more developed 
regions; however, this has not been observed in less developed regions. This 
study aims to evaluate inequalities in the burden of female breast cancer in 
Brazil including an analysis of interregional and interstate patterns in 
incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates from 1990 
to 2017, and mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR), and their association with the 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
METHODS: Using estimates from the global burden of disease (GBD) study, we 
applied a spatial exploratory analysis technique to obtain measurements of 
global and local spatial correlation. Percentage changes of breast cancer 
incidence, mortality, and DALYs rates between 1990 and 2017 were calculated, and 
maps were developed to show the spatial distribution of the variables. Spatial 
panel models were adjusted to investigate the association between rates and SDI 
in Brazilian states.
RESULTS: In Brazil, while breast cancer mortality rate have had modest reduction 
(-4.45%; 95% UI: -6.97; -1.76) between 1990 and 2017, the incidence rate 
increased substantially (+39.99%; 95% UI: 34.90; 45.39). Breast cancer incidence 
and mortality rates in 1990 and 2017 were higher in regions with higher SDI, 
i.e., the most developed ones. While SDI increased in all Brazilian states 
between 1990 and 2017, notably in less developed regions, MIR decreased, more 
notably in more developed regions. The SDI had a positive association with 
incidence rate and a negative association with MIR.
CONCLUSION: Such findings suggest an improvement in breast cancer survival in 
the period, which may be related to a broader access to diagnostic methods and 
treatment. This study also revealed the inequality in breast cancer outcomes 
among Brazilian states and may guide public policy priorities for disease 
control in the country.

BACKGROUND: In this study, infant mortality rate (IMR) inequalities are analyzed 
from 1990 to 2015 in different geographic scales.
METHODS: The Ministry of Health (MoH) IMR estimates by Federative Units (FU) 
were compared to those obtained by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) group. In 
order to measure the inequalities of the IMR by FU, the ratios from highest to 
lowest from 1990 to 2015 were calculated. Maps were elaborated in 2000, 2010, 
and 2015 at the municipality level. To analyze the effect of income, IMR 
inequalities by GDP per capita were analyzed, comparing Brazil and the FU to 
other same-income level countries in 2015, and the IMR municipal estimates were 
analyzed by income deciles, in 2000 and 2010.
RESULTS: IMR decreased from 47.1 to 13.4 per 1000 live births (LB) from 1990 to 
2015, with an annual decrease rate of 4.9%. The decline was less pronounced for 
the early neonatal annual rate (3.5%). The Northeast region showed the most 
significant annual decline (6.2%). The IMR estimates carried out by the GBD were 
about 20% higher than those obtained by the MoH, but in terms of their 
inequalities, the ratio from the highest to the lowest IMR among the 27 FU 
decreased from 4 to 2, for both methods. The percentage of municipalities with 
IMR higher than 40 per 1000 LB decreased from 23% to 2%, between 2000 and 2015. 
Comparing the IMR distribution by income deciles, all inequality measures of the 
IMR decreased markedly from 2000 to 2010.
CONCLUSION: The results showed a marked decrease in the IMR inequalities in 
Brazil, regardless of the geographic breakdown and the calculation method. 
Despite clear signs of progress in curbing infant mortality, there are still 
challenges in reducing its level, such as the concentration of deaths in the 
early neonatal period, and the specific increases of post neonatal mortality in 
2016, after the recent cuts in social investments.

Parasites are a selective force that shape communities and ecosystems. Hosts 
represent a food source, habitat, and a way to disperse. In recent years, 
investigations dealing with bats and their role as hosts to numerous parasitic 
organisms, including metazoan ectoparasites and endoparasites have increased, 
and soft ticks (Parasitiformes: Ixodida: Argasidae) are among the best known. In 
Mexico, 16 species of soft ticks associated with bats have been reported up to 
now, but there are no specific records of soft ticks parasitizing Leptonycteris 
yerbabuenae in the country. Herein, we record for the first time the presence of 
Ornithodoros dyeri parasitizing L. yerbabuenae and report an extension of its 
geographic distribution. The same tick species was also recorded from the 
California leaf-nosed bat (Macrotus californicus). Data on prevalence, mean 
intensity, mean abundance, tick identification, and possible scenarios of life 
cycle associations for O. dyeri and one of its hosts, L. yerbabuenae, are 
discussed.

BACKGROUND: Bempedoic acid is a novel adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase 
inhibitor shown to reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as an 
adjunct lipid-lowering therapy in patients with high cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) risk.
OBJECTIVE: Our analysis aimed to determine the price at which bempedoic acid 
would be cost-effective from the Australian health care perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was designed using data from the Cholesterol Lowering 
via Bempedoic Acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Harmony trial, to model 
the clinical outcomes and costs of 1000 patients treated with bempedoic acid 
over a lifetime horizon. Relevant health states were "Alive with CVD," "Alive 
with recurrent CVD," and "Dead." With annual cycles, patients were at risk of a 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and death from CVD 
or non-CVD causes. Costs and utilities were obtained from published sources. 
Outcomes of interest were the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in terms of 
cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and cost per year of life 
saved. Outcomes were discounted at 5% per annum.
RESULTS: Among 1000 individuals, bempedoic acid in addition to statin therapy 
was estimated to save 122 (discounted) years of life and 103 (discounted) QALYs 
compared with statin therapy alone. At an acquisition cost of AU$584.40 per year 
(USD$397.01), bempedoic acid would be considered cost-effective within the 
Australian setting, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AU$49,890 
per QALY gained (USD$33,893) and AU$42,433 per year of life saved (USD$28,827).
CONCLUSIONS: Bempedoic acid may be cost-effective within the Australian health 
care setting at an annual acquisition price less than $600.

INTRODUCTION: Prior studies have revealed the increasing prevalence of obesity 
and its associated health effects among ageing adults in resource poor 
countries. However, no study has examined the long-term and economic impact of 
overweight and obesity in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, we quantified the 
long-term impact of overweight and obesity on life expectancy (LE), 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and total direct healthcare costs.
METHODS: A Markov simulation model projected health and economic outcomes 
associated with three categories of body mass index (BMI): healthy weight 
(18.5≤BMI <25.0); overweight (25.0≤BMI < 30.0) and obese (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2) in 
simulated adult cohorts over a 50-year time horizon from age fifty. Costs were 
estimated from government and patient perspectives, discounted 3% annually and 
reported in 2017 US$. Mortality rates from Ghanaian lifetables were adjusted by 
BMI-specific all-cause mortality HRs. Published input data were used from the 
2014/2015 Ghana WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health data. Internal and 
external validity were assessed.
RESULTS: From age 50 years, average (95% CI) remaining LE for females were 25.6 
(95% CI: 25.4 to 25.8), 23.5 (95% CI: 23.3 to 23.7) and 21.3 (95% CI: 19.6 to 
21.8) for healthy weight, overweight and obesity, respectively. In males, 
remaining LE were healthy weight (23.0; 95% CI: 22.8 to 23.2), overweight (20.7; 
95% CI: 20.5 to 20.9) and obesity (17.6; 95% CI: 17.5 to 17.8). In females, 
QALYs for healthy weight were 23.0 (95% CI: 22.8 to 23.2), overweight, 21.0 (95% 
CI: 20.8 to 21.2) and obesity, 19.0 (95% CI: 18.8 to 19.7). The discounted total 
costs per female were US$619 (95% CI: 616 to 622), US$1298 (95% CI: 1290 to 
1306) and US$2057 (95% CI: 2043 to 2071) for healthy weight, overweight and 
obesity, respectively. QALYs and costs were lower in males.
CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity have substantial health and economic impacts, 
hence the urgent need for cost-effective preventive strategies in the Ghanaian 
population.

BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia are a high-risk population due to higher 
prevalences of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities that contribute to 
shorter life expectancy.
PURPOSE: To investigate patients with and without schizophrenia experiencing an 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in relation to guideline recommended 
in-hospital management, discharge medications and 5-year major adverse cardiac 
events (MACE: composite of all-cause mortality, rehospitalisation for 
reinfarction, stroke or heart failure).
METHODS: All patients with schizophrenia who experienced AMI during 2000-2018 
were identified (n=1008) from the nationwide Swedish Web-system for Enhancement 
and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to 
Recommended Therapies registry and compared with AMI patients without 
schizophrenia (n=2 85 325). Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox 
regression models were used to compare the populations.
RESULTS: Patients with schizophrenia presented with AMI approximately 10 years 
earlier (median age 64 vs 73 years), and had higher prevalences of diabetes, 
heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They were less likely 
to be invasively investigated or discharged with aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, ACE 
inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-blockers and statins (all 
p<0.005). AMI patients with schizophrenia had higher adjusted risk of MACE 
(aHR=2.05, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.58), mortality (aHR=2.38, 95% CI 1.84 to 3.09) and 
hospitalisation for heart failure (aHR=1.39, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.86) compared with 
AMI patients without schizophrenia.
CONCLUSION: Patients with schizophrenia experienced an AMI almost 10 years 
earlier than patients without schizophrenia. They less often underwent invasive 
procedures and were less likely to be treated with guideline recommended 
medications at discharge, and had more than doubled risk of MACE and all-cause 
mortality. Improved primary and secondary preventive measures, including 
adherence to guideline recommendations, are warranted and may improve outcome.

AIMS: To explore variations in the use of and timeliness of chemotherapy in 
patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer in New Zealand.
METHODS: This study included patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer in New 
Zealand between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2016. The first chemotherapy 
regime was identified from Pharmaceutical Collection dataset. Logistic 
regression model was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio of having 
chemotherapy by subgroup after adjustment for other factors.
RESULTS: 27.8% (6,737/24,217) of colon cancer patients and 43.8% (3,582/8,170) 
of rectal cancer patients received publicly funded chemotherapy. The uptake and 
timeliness of chemotherapy has been improving over time. Pacific people were the 
least likely to receive chemotherapy, followed by Māori and Asian. Younger 
patients, New Zealand European, patients with metastatic disease and patients in 
the Southern Cancer Network were more likely to have chemotherapy in less than 
10 weeks post-diagnosis. Over half of the advanced colorectal cancer patients 
who did not receive chemotherapy were aged 80+ years or had a short life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the uptake and timeliness of chemotherapy for colorectal 
cancer has been improving, Māori, Pacific, Asian and older patients were less 
likely to receive chemotherapy and less likely to receive chemotherapy in a 
timely manner. There is a variation in use of chemotherapy by Region with 
patients in the Southern Cancer region appearing to be the most likely to 
receive chemotherapy and to receive it within a timely period.

AIMS: There is limited evidence as to how clinical outcomes of COVID-19 
including fatality rates may vary by ethnicity. We aim to estimate inequities in 
infection fatality rates (IFR) in New Zealand by ethnicity.
METHODS: We combine existing demographic and health data for ethnic groups in 
New Zealand with international data on COVID-19 IFR for different age groups. We 
adjust age-specific IFRs for differences in unmet healthcare need, and 
comorbidities by ethnicity. We also adjust for life expectancy reflecting 
evidence that COVID-19 amplifies the existing mortality risk of different 
groups.
RESULTS: The IFR for Māori is estimated to be 50% higher than that of non-Māori, 
and could be even higher depending on the relative contributions of age and 
underlying health conditions to mortality risk.
CONCLUSIONS: There are likely to be significant inequities in the health burden 
from COVID-19 in New Zealand by ethnicity. These will be exacerbated by racism 
within the healthcare system and other inequities not reflected in official 
data. Highest risk communities include those with elderly populations, and Māori 
and Pacific communities. These factors should be included in future disease 
incidence and impact modelling.

INTRODUCTION: Psoas abscess is a rare entity at the pediatric stage of life. The 
clinical presentation of psoas abscess is insidious and not specifi c, and this 
usually causes diagnostic delay. Early diagnosis is relevant to prevent 
devastating consequences of this condition.
AIMS: This study aimed to describe the natural history of psoas abscess, present 
our experience in a children's hospital, determine warning signs and symptoms 
that may lead to early diagnosis, and describe differential diagnoses. We also 
discuss the devastating consequences of misdiagnosing psoas abscess.
METHODS: This retrospective study was performed at Sant Joan de Déu Children's 
Hospital (Barcelona, Spain) from 2008 to 2016. All patients younger than 18 
years old (n = 12) with psoas abscess who were diagnosed by imaging tests were 
included.
RESULTS: The initial clinical presentation of the patients was variable. Painful 
hip mobility at extension (7 cases), limping (5 cases), and fever (4 cases) were 
the most frequent presentations. Laboratory parameters were abnormal in nine 
patients. The main responsible bacteria was Staphylococcus aureus (9 cases). The 
mean hospital stay was 28 days (range, 10-71 days). Percutaneous drainage under 
ultrasound control was applied in two patients. Surgical debridement was 
performed in seven patients, and repeated procedures were required in three of 
them.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of the erratic presentation of psoas abscess, its suspected 
diagnosis is essential for an early diagnosis, which will minimize the risk of 
diagnostic delay. One or more signs and symptoms at the same time might be 
considered as initiation of psoas abscess. Physicians should be aware of risk 
factors, such as previous traumatism and a known disturbed immunological system 
or temporal circumstances, which might lead to psoas abscess. Laboratory 
parameters may provide more confi dence in diagnosis, and early imaging tests 
provide a defi nitive diagnosis.

An increase in the average life expectancy, paralleled by a demographic shift in 
the population with end-stage liver disease lies behind the rising demand for 
liver transplantation (LT) among the elderly. Some of the most common 
indications for LT including hepatocellular carcinoma, alcohol-related liver 
disease, chronic hepatitis C and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease tend to 
affect older patients. Transplant professionals are faced with an increasing 
demand for LT among elderly patients in an age of organ shortage and it is 
important that risk and benefits are carefully weighed in order to achieve the 
optimum use of precious liver grafts.
