non-IOFS RRP series of 28.7 to 7.8% (p < 0.05). Intra-operative PSM on the 
prostate specimen was seen in 8/40 margin analysis (20%) leading to an excision 
of the contra-lateral nerve bundle. On analysis of the nerve bundle on a 
paraffin embedded block, 6 nerve bundle matched tumor on the specimen whereas 2 
NVB were retrospectively removed unnecessarily in our series. All 40 patients 
have undetectable PSA at a mean follow up of 21.2 months (SD 7.79). Functional 
data at 18 months confirms a reduction in the urinary incontinence from 37% in 
the IOFS group vs 57% in the non-IOFS group (p = NS). IOFS technique has 
resulted in a significant increase in intravesical nerve sparing in both T2/T3 
patients with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer when appropriately 
counselled and selected (T2 from 100% in the IOFS group versus 67% and T3 from 
100% in the IOFS group to 42%) (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Introduction of the IOFS analysis during intrafascial nerve spare 
RRP has reduced PSM and the rate of urinary incontinence.

Forkhead transcription factors: new considerations for alzheimer's disease and 
dementia.

Life expectancy of individuals in both developed and undeveloped nations 
continues to rise at an unprecedented rate. Coupled to this increase in 
longevity for individuals is the rise in the incidence of chronic 
neurodegenerative disorders that includes Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, 
almost ten percent of the population over the age of 65 suffers from AD, a 
disorder that is presently without definitive therapy to prevent the onset or 
progression of cognitive loss. Yet, it is estimated that AD will continue to 
significantly increase throughout the world to impact millions of individuals 
and foster the escalation of healthcare costs. One potential target for the 
development of novel strategies against AD and other cognitive disorders 
involves the mammalian forkhead transcription factors of the O class (FoxOs). 
FoxOs are present in "cognitive centers" of the brain to include the 
hippocampus, the amygdala, and the nucleus accumbens and may be required for 
memory formation and consolidation. FoxOs play a critical role in determining 
survival of multiple cell types in the nervous system, drive pathways of 
apoptosis and autophagy, and control stem cell proliferation and 
differentiation. FoxOs also interface with multiple cellular pathways that 
include growth factors, Wnt signaling, Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 
1 (WISP1), and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SIRT1) that ultimately may control FoxOs and 
determine the fate and function of cells in the nervous system that control 
memory and cognition. Future work that can further elucidate the complex 
relationship FoxOs hold over cell fate and cognitive function could yield 
exciting prospects for the treatment of a number of neurodegenerative disorders 
including AD.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease is asymptomatic until its last stages and 
though it is increasing globally, we are faced with paucity of a 
population-based model to assess this disease, particularly in developing 
countries. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and 
trends of CKD according to a new estimation method.
METHODS: Using multiplier method, we estimated the numbers of different stages 
of CKD based on the number of patients with end stage renal failure from 2006 to 
2016. The required multipliers were extracted from a simulation of the disease 
in Kerman following a dynamic model. The 95% uncertainty interval was computed 
using Monte-Carlo technique with 10,000 iterations.
RESULTS: The prevalence of CKDA (GFR<=90mL/min/1.73m2) and CKDB (GFR less than 
60mL/min/1.73m2) patients were estimated to be 7.6% (95% uncertainty interval 
(UI), 5.7-9.1%) and 1.1% (95% UI, 0.8-1.3%), respectively in 2011. The method 
revealed that the prevalence may rise up to 25.7% (95% UI, 18.2-32.5%) and 3.7% 
(95% UI, 2.7-4.5%) for CKDA and CKDB, respectively in 2016, indicating 
approximately 3.3 times increase for both figures.
CONCLUSION: This study predicted an increase in the prevalence of CKD in the 
future. This may be due to the increasing life expectancy of the population, the 
increase in the prevalence of non- communicable diseases such as hypertension 
and diabetes, or patients' survival due to receiving better support. Therefore, 
the policymakers should be concerned and well informed about this increase.

STUDY DESIGN: Fifty-one patients with spinal multiple myeloma (MM) metastases 
were operated and followed between January 2004 and July 2014.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to consider the efficiency of surgical 
prognosis scores in the management of spinal metastases myelomas.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The spine is the most common site of bone metastases 
in MM. Surgery in spine metastases MM is a matter of debate and its impact on 
the increase of a patient's survival time is not clear. Several surgical 
survival scores have been developed to determine the best treatment in these 
patients.
METHODS: We studied 51 patients operated for spinal MM metastases between 
January 2004 and July 2014. We determined the Tokuhashi and Tomita survival 
scores and compared them with documented patient survivals. The two scores were 
also compared with the International Staging System (ISS).
RESULTS: Median survival (MS) was 108 months [standard deviation (SD) 62] for 
ISS I, 132.2 (SD 40) for ISS II, and 45.5 months (SD 16.3) for ISS III 
(P = 0.09). According to Tokuhashi survival score, 21 patients (41.2%) will 
survive <6 months, 6 (11.8%) 6 to 12 months, and 24 (47%) >12 months. According 
to Tomita et al., 50 patients (98%) will survive >49.9 months and 1 patient (2%) 
<15 months. Regardless of the ISS grade prognosis, Tokuhashi survival score, and 
to a lesser extent Tomita score, underestimated the actual survival very 
significantly [P < 0.0001, Log Rank (Mantel-Cox)].
CONCLUSION: We suggest that spine surgical prognosis scores are not accurate and 
are not able to predict the survival of patients with spine myeloma metastases. 
Spine surgeons have to be guided not by the initial ISS stage but rather by 
spinal instability and neurological status.

In this article, we conduct a comprehensive molecular relaxation study of 
amorphous Quinidine above and below the glass-transition temperature (Tg) 
through broadband dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (BDS) experiments and 
theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations, as one major issue 
with the amorphous state of pharmaceuticals is life expectancy. These techniques 
enabled us to determine what kind of molecular motions are responsible, or not, 
for the devitrification of Quinidine. Parameters describing the complex 
molecular dynamics of amorphous Quinidine, such as Tg, the width of the α 
relaxation (βKWW), the temperature dependence of α-relaxation times (τα), the 
fragility index (m), and the apparent activation energy of secondary γ 
relaxation (Ea-γ), were characterized. Above Tg (> 60 °C), a medium degree of 
nonexponentiality (βKWW = 0.5) was evidenced. An intermediate value of the 
fragility index (m = 86) enabled us to consider Quinidine as a glass former of 
medium fragility. Below Tg (< 60 °C), one well-defined secondary γ relaxation, 
with an apparent activation energy of Ea-γ = 53.8 kJ/mol, was reported. From 
theoretical DFT calculations, we identified the most reactive part of Quinidine 
moieties through exploration of the potential energy surface. We evidenced that 
the clearly visible γ process has an intramolecular origin coming from the 
rotation of the CH(OH)C9H14N end group. An excess wing observed in amorphous 
Quinidine was found to be an unresolved Johari-Goldstein relaxation. These 
studies were supplemented by sub-Tg experimental evaluations of the life 
expectancy of amorphous Quinidine by X-ray powder diffraction and differential 
scanning calorimetry. We show that the difference between Tg and the onset 
temperature for crystallization, Tc, which is 30 K, is sufficiently large to 
avoid recrystallization of amorphous Quinidine during 16 months of storage under 
ambient conditions.

INTRODUCTION: Positive surgical margins (PSM) detected in the radical 
prostatectomy specimen increase the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR). Still, 
with formidable number of patients never experiencing BCR in their life, the 
reason for this inconsistency has been attributed to the artifacts and to the 
spontaneous regression of micrometastatic site. To investigate the origin of 
margin positive cancers, we have looked into the influence of extraprostatic 
extension location on the resection margin positive site and its implications on 
BCR risk.
MATERIALS & METHODS: The clinical information and follow-up data of 612 patients 
who had extraprostatic extension and positive surgical margin at the time of 
robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in the single center between 2005 
and 2014 were modeled using Fine and Gray's competing risk regression analysis 
for BCR. Extraprostatic extensions were divided into categories according to 
location as apex, base, anterior, posterior, lateral, and posterolateral. 
Extraprostatic extensions were defined as presence of tumor beyond the borders 
of the gland in the posterior and posterolateral regions. Tumor admixed with 
periprostatic fat was additionally considered as having extraprostatic extension 
if capsule was vague in the anterior, apex, and base regions. Positive surgical 
margins were defined as the presence of tumor cells at the inked margin on the 
inspection under microscopy. Association of these classifications with the site 
of PSM was evaluated by Cohen's Kappa analysis for concordance and logistic 
regression for the odds of apical and base PSMs.
RESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 36.5 months (interquartile range[IQR] 
20.1-36.5). Apex involvement was found in 158 (25.8%) patients and base in 110 
(18.0%) patients. PSMs generally were found to be associated with increased risk 
of BCR regardless of location, with BCR risk highest for base PSM (HR 1.94, 95% 
CI 1.40-2.68, p<0.001) after adjusting for age, initial prostate-specific 
antigen, pathologic Gleason score, and pathologic T stage in the multivariate 
model. Logistic regression for PSM site revealed no significant correlation of 
apex PSM with extraprostatic extension location, while base PSM was associated 
with increased odds of anterior (OR 2.513, 95% CI 1.425-4.430, p = 0.001) and 
lateral (OR 2.715, 95% CI 1.735-4.250, p<0.001) extraprostatic extension.
CONCLUSION: Extension into the extraprostatic tissue on some specific locations 
do not share the same recur risk due to the different anatomical structures 
surrounding the organ. Anterior and lateral EPEs are prone to leave PSM on the 
base of the prostate, probably because of the lack of anatomical barricades 
slowing down the direct invasion process. More study on the pattern of spread of 
the tumors found to have extraprostatic extension is suggested for optimal 
planning of the operation extent and of the adjuvant radiotherapy.

People with schizophrenia, who constitute approximately 0.3-1% of the general 
population, have a nearly 20% shorter life expectancy than the general 
population. The incidence of varied types of cancers in patients with 
schizophrenia is controversial. The majority of previous research has 
demonstrated that patients who have schizophrenia and cancer have early 
mortality compared to the general population with cancer. The causes of early 
mortality in patients with schizophrenia and cancer might be attributed to a 
lower cancer screening rate and lack of effective treatment, including: (i) 
patient factors, such as poor lifestyle, passive attitude toward treatment, or 
comorbidity; (ii) physician factors, such as physician bias, which may decrease 
the delivery of care for individuals with mental disorders; and (iii) hospital 
administration factors, such as stigma and discrimination. Additional studies on 
patients with schizophrenia and cancer are warranted and should include the 
following: a comprehensive review of previous studies; a focus on 
differentiating the specific types of cancer; and methods for improvement. To 
decrease the early mortality of patients with schizophrenia, the following 
measures are proposed: (i) enhance early detection and early treatment, such as 
increasing the cancer screening rate for patients with schizophrenia; (ii) 
provide effective, timely treatment and rehabilitation; (iii) improve patients' 
psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment; (iv) promote healthy behavior in 
the general population and emphasize healthy lifestyles in vulnerable 
populations; and (v) remove the stigma of schizophrenia. To reduce disparities 
in physical health, public health strategies and welfare policies must continue 
to focus on this group of patients.

Radiotherapy for breast cancer may expose heart and vessels to late 
radiation-induced complications. Although recent technical progress in radiation 
therapy (RT) has been associated with drastic reduction in cardiovascular (CV) 
mortality, the prolonged life expectancy of patients with cancer requires CV 
evaluation for many years. The aim of our study was to evaluate local changes in 
vascular and cardiac function because of previous breast RT. We enrolled 43 
patients treated with RT 15 years ago for breast cancer. CV risk factors and 
atherosclerotic carotid damage were investigated in all women. We divided 
patients into 2 groups: R (n = 25) treated to right breast and L (n = 18) to 
left breast. All subjects were submitted to standard echocardiography and 
functional arteries evaluation by carotid-radial pulse-wave velocity (crPWV; 
Complior) and AIx (Sphygmocor; Atcor Medical). Global mean age was 69.5 ± 
8 years old. CV risk factors were equally allocated in 2 groups. No patients had 
history of cardiac or artery disease. R had a significantly increased crPWV (9.9 
± 1.4 vs 8.9 ± 1.1, p = 0.001) on right arm compared with left arm, and in L 
group, crPWV was similarly higher on the left arm than on right arm (9.6 ± 1.5 
vs 8.9 ± 1.4, p = 0.011). AIx was significantly increased in the ipsilateral arm 
only in L (32.1 ± 7.6 vs 28.3 ± 6.8, p = 0.05). Central blood pressure 
estimation was not different in the right and left arms. No correlations were 
found with hormone therapy or chemotherapy. Our data show a local arterial 
stiffening because of radiation that can be involved in increased CV risk in 
breast cancer-treated patients.

BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of 
choice for young Hurler patients. Despite halting of neurocognitive decline and 
improvement of life expectancy, the beneficial effect on the skeletal system is 
limited. As orthopedic complications are one of the most disabling factors 
following HSCT, this points to the need for new treatment strategies. The study 
summarizes musculoskeletal manifestations in 19 transplanted Hurler patients.
METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively. Patients' charts for physical 
examinations of the joint range of motion (JROM) of shoulders, elbows, hips and 
knees were reviewed. Radiographic evaluations of thorax, spine, pelvis and hands 
were performed. MRI scans of the craniocervical junction were analyzed to 
determine odontoid hypoplasia and the prevalence of craniocervical stenosis.
RESULTS: Nineteen Hurler patients (10 females, 9 males) with an average age of 
8.1 years (range 2.5-23.8) at the latest follow-up, who underwent allogenic HSCT 
between 1991 and 2012, were assessed after an average follow-up period of 
6.4 years (range 0.7-22.5). Seventeen patients achieved long-term engraftment, 
two developed graft failures. The majority of patients showed a steady state or 
improvements in the mobility of knees (31 %/63 %), hips (47 %/40 %) and elbows 
(56 %/38 %). However, shoulder abduction was impaired in ¾ of patients and 
showed the highest rate of progression (31 %). In patients with graft failure, 
progressive restrictions in JROM were noted. Assessments of the craniocervical 
junction by MRI showed stable or improved diameters in 67 % of patients. 
Correction or stabilization of odontoid hypoplasia was found in 64 %. However 
thoracolumbar kyphosis, scoliosis, hip dysplasia and genua valga were 
progressive despite HSCT. At the last follow up, 47 % of patients were partially 
wheelchair dependent, 10 % wheelchair bound and 25 % regularly experienced pain 
in the spine, hips and lower extremities due to orthopedic problems.
CONCLUSION: Joint mobility, odontoid hypoplasia and craniocervical stenosis 
might stabilize or even improve in Hurler patients following HSCT. However, 
despite the beneficial effects on some musculoskeletal manifestations, skeletal 
complications are frequently observed and the overall burden of orthopedic 
disease is significant. Frequent multi-disciplinary follow-up in a specialized 
center are essential. Novel therapeutic approaches (e.g. anti-inflammatory 
drugs) are needed to improve musculoskeletal outcomes.

Pharmacoepidemiological studies exploring utilisation of psychotropic 
medications in real-life conditions are required to identify extension of 
indications, since the risk of gap between the theoretical target population and 
the population actually treated is especially marked for this class of drugs. A 
large proportion of subjects from the general population are exposed to 
psychotropic medications, so even a small increase in the risk of adverse effect 
may have major deleterious consequences for the health of the general 
population. Hence, pharmacoepidemiological studies are also required to explore 
the risk/benefit ratio of these drugs in real-life conditions. These studies may 
provide answers to currently unsolved public health questions, such as the 
long-term cognitive impact of exposure to benzodiazepines, the impact of 
antidepressant on suicidal behaviour, or the risks associated with enlarged use 
of antipsychotics. Only findings obtained by such studies may allow risk 
management and elaboration of guidelines based upon factual data.

By using historical data on about 50,000 twins born in Sweden during 1886-1958, 
we demonstrate a positive and statistically significant relationship between 
years of schooling and longevity. This relation remains almost unchanged when 
exploiting a twin fixed-effects design to control for the influence of genetics 
and shared family background. This result is robust to controlling for 
within-twin-pair differences in early-life health and cognitive ability, as 
proxied by birth weight and height, as well as to restricting the sample to MZ 
twins. The relationship is fairly constant over time but becomes weaker with 
age. Literally, our results suggest that compared with low levels of schooling 
(less than 10 years), high levels of schooling (at least 13 years of schooling) 
are associated with about three years longer life expectancy at age 60 for the 
considered birth cohorts. The real societal value of schooling may hence extend 
beyond pure labor market and economic growth returns. From a policy perspective, 
schooling may therefore be a vehicle for improving longevity and health, as well 
as equality along these dimensions.

BACKGROUND: With recent improvements in vaccines and treatments against viral 
hepatitis, an improved understanding of the burden of viral hepatitis is needed 
to inform global intervention strategies. We used data from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) Study to estimate morbidity and mortality for acute viral 
hepatitis, and for cirrhosis and liver cancer caused by viral hepatitis, by age, 
sex, and country from 1990 to 2013.
METHODS: We estimated mortality using natural history models for acute hepatitis 
infections and GBD's cause-of-death ensemble model for cirrhosis and liver 
cancer. We used meta-regression to estimate total cirrhosis and total liver 
cancer prevalence, as well as the proportion of cirrhosis and liver cancer 
attributable to each cause. We then estimated cause-specific prevalence as the 
product of the total prevalence and the proportion attributable to a specific 
cause. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of 
years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs).
FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2013, global viral hepatitis deaths increased from 
0·89 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0·86-0·94) to 1·45 million 
(1·38-1·54); YLLs from 31·0 million (29·6-32·6) to 41·6 million (39·1-44·7); 
YLDs from 0·65 million (0·45-0·89) to 0·87 million (0·61-1·18); and DALYs from 
31·7 million (30·2-33·3) to 42·5 million (39·9-45·6). In 2013, viral hepatitis 
was the seventh (95% UI seventh to eighth) leading cause of death worldwide, 
compared with tenth (tenth to 12th) in 1990.
INTERPRETATION: Viral hepatitis is a leading cause of death and disability 
worldwide. Unlike most communicable diseases, the absolute burden and relative 
rank of viral hepatitis increased between 1990 and 2013. The enormous health 
loss attributable to viral hepatitis, and the availability of effective vaccines 
and treatments, suggests an important opportunity to improve public health.

BACKGROUND: Obese patients have greater comorbidities along with higher risk of 
complications and greater costs after spine surgery, which may result in 
increased cost and lower quality of life compared with their non-obese 
counterparts.
PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to determine cost-utility following 
anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in obese patients.
STUDY DESIGN: This study analyzed prospectively collected data.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients undergoing elective ACDF for degenerative cervical 
pathology at a single academic institution were included in the study.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were the outcome 
measures.
METHODS: One- and two-year medical resource utilization, missed work, and health 
state values (QALYs) were assessed. Two-year resource use was multiplied by unit 
costs based on Medicare national payment amounts (direct cost). Patient and 
caregiver workday losses were multiplied by the self-reported gross-of-tax wage 
rate (indirect cost). Total cost (direct+indirect) was used to compute cost per 
QALY gained. Patients were defined as obese for body mass index (BMI) ≥35 based 
on the WHO definition of class II obesity. A subgroup analysis was conducted in 
morbidly obese patients (BMI≥40).
RESULTS: There were significant improvements in pain (neck pain or arm pain), 
disability (Neck Disability Index), and quality of life (EuroQol-5D and Short 
Form-12) at 2 years after surgery (p<.001). There was no significant difference 
in post-discharge health-care resource utilization, direct cost, indirect cost, 
and total cost between obese and non-obese patients at postoperative 1-year and 
2-year follow-up. Mean 2-year direct cost for obese patients was $19,225±$8,065 
and $17,635±$6,413 for non-obese patients (p=.14). There was no significant 
difference in the mean total 2-year cost between obese ($23,144±$9,216) and 
non-obese ($22,183±$10,564) patients (p=.48). Obese patients had a lower mean 
cumulative gain in QALYs versus non-obese patients at 2-years (0.34 vs. 0.42, 
p=.32). Two-year cost-utility in obese ($68,070/QALY) versus non-obese patients 
($52,816/QALY) was not significantly different (p=.11). Morbidly obese patients 
had lower QALYs gained (0.17) and higher cost per QALYs gained ($138,094/QALY) 
at 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion provided a significant gain 
in health state utility in obese patients, with a mean 2-year cost-utility of 
$68,070 per QALYs gained, which can be considered moderately cost-effective. 
Morbidly obese patients had lower cost-effectiveness; however, surgery does 
provide a significant improvement in outcomes. Obesity, and specifically morbid 
obesity, should to be taken into consideration as physician and hospital 
reimbursements move toward a bundled model.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to confirm, in a large, diverse cohort of elite 
Stand-up Comedians and other entertainers, that there is an inverse association 
between comedic ability and longevity.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 200 Stand-up Comedians (13% 
women), 113 Comedy Actors (17.5% women), and 184 Dramatic Actors (29.3% women) 
listed in the top 200 in each category in a popular online ranking website. 
Longevity within each group was examined adjusting for life expectancy by year 
of birth and within-group ranking score.
RESULTS: Stand-up Comedians were younger than Comedy Actors (median birth year 
1962 versus 1947: p<0.001) and Dramatic Actors (1962 versus 1946: p<0.001). 
Overall, 36/200 (18.0%), 33/114 (29.0%) and 56/184 (30.9%) of Stand-up 
Comedians, Comedy Actors and Dramatic Actors, respectively, had died (p=0.011). 
There was a significant gradient (p=0.011) in the age of death, with Stand-up 
Comedians dying at a younger age (67.1±21.3years) than their Comedy Actor 
(68.9±15.4years) and Dramatic Actor (70.7±16.6years) counterparts. Stand-up 
Comedians (38.9% versus 19.6%) were more likely to die prematurely compared to 
Dramatic Actors; p=0.043, OR 1.98; 95% CI 1.01 to 3.87). Independent of year of 
birth, for Stand-up Comedians alone, higher comedy rank was associated with 
shorter longevity (hazard ratio 0.938, 95% CI 0.880 to 0.999 for a 10-rank 
difference; p=0.045).
CONCLUSIONS: These data reaffirm an adverse relationship between comedic ability 
and longevity, with elite Stand-up Comedians more highly rated by the public 
more likely to die prematurely.

The widespread utilization of imaging has led to an increasing incidence of 
small renal masses (SRMs). However, at least 20% are benign. Nevertheless, 
nephron-sparing surgery is the standard treatment for SRMs without pretreatment 
characterization with biopsy. Elderly patients and patients with multiple 
comorbidities and limited life expectancy may safely be managed with active 
surveillance with low risk of disease progression and mortality. An initial 
period of observation to determine tumor growth kinetics is safe and appropriate 
in select candidates. Renal tumor biopsy is accurate, safe and should be 
considered for SRMs prior to finalizing treatment plans.

INTRODUCTION: There are a number of economic evaluation studies of clopidogrel 
for patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) 
published from the perspective of multiple countries in recent years. However, 
relevant research is quite limited in China. We aimed to estimate the long-term 
cost effectiveness for up to 1-year treatment with clopidogrel plus 
acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) versus ASA alone for NSTEACS from the public payer 
perspective in China.
METHODS: This analysis used a Markov model to simulate a cohort of patients for 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and incremental cost for lifetime 
horizon. Based on the primary event rates, adherence rate, and mortality derived 
from the CURE trial, hazard functions obtained from published literature were 
used to extrapolate the overall survival to lifetime horizon. Resource 
utilization, hospitalization, medication costs, and utility values were 
estimated from official reports, published literature, and analysis of the 
patient-level insurance data in China. To assess the impact of parameters' 
uncertainty on cost-effectiveness results, one-way sensitivity analyses were 
undertaken for key parameters, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was 
conducted using the Monte Carlo simulation.
RESULTS: The therapy of clopidogrel plus ASA is a cost-effective option in 
comparison with ASA alone for the treatment of NSTEACS in China, leading to 
0.0548 life years (LYs) and 0.0518 QALYs gained per patient. From the public 
payer perspective in China, clopidogrel plus ASA is associated with an 
incremental cost of 43,340 China Yuan (CNY) per QALY gained and 41,030 CNY per 
LY gained (discounting at 3.5% per year). PSA results demonstrated that 88% of 
simulations were lower than the cost-effectiveness threshold of 150,721 CYN per 
QALY gained. Based on the one-way sensitivity analysis, results are most 
sensitive to price of clopidogrel, but remain well below this threshold.
CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that treatment with clopidogrel plus ASA for 
up to 1 year for patients with NSTEACS is cost effective in the local context of 
China from a public payers' perspective.

BACKGROUND: Excessive pelvic tilt may be one of the factors leading to 
instability in total hip arthroplasty (THA), even when the acetabular cup is 
placed properly. To our knowledge, only a few studies have described late 
anterior dislocation due to posterior pelvic tilt. We present 3 cases with late 
anterior dislocations possibly due to posterior pelvic tilt.
CASES PRESENTATIONS: Case-1: An 84-years-old woman fell and presented with an 
anterior dislocation 12-years after THA. Her pelvis had tilted to approximately 
30° posteriorly in a supine position. After conservative treatment, she 
presented with 10 recurrent anterior dislocations. She had thoracolumbar 
kyphosis due to multiple compression fractures. Revision with anterior placement 
of an elevated liner and a 32-mm head corrected the dislocation, and no further 
dislocations occurred. Case-2: A 78-years-old woman fell and presented with an 
anterior dislocation 4-years after THA. Her posterior pelvic tilt had increased 
23° due to a lumbar compression fracture. Revision by decreasing the cup 
anteversion was performed, but recurrent posterior dislocations occurred. Owing 
to her worsened general condition, further treatment was abandoned. Case-3: A 
79-years-old woman twisted her body and presented an anterior dislocation 
3-years after THA. After manual reduction and conservative treatment, the 
dislocation recurred. Her posterior pelvic tilt had increased 16°.
CONCLUSION: Although minor trauma triggered the anterior instability in these 
patients, the underlying pathomechanism existed in the progressive pelvic 
posterior tilt due to thoracolumbar kyphosis. As longer life expectancy as well 
as implant survivorship is predicted, attention must be paid to the change of 
pelvic tilt in elderly patients.

Hospital; Ontario Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services 
(Kiefer), Toronto, Ont.; Faculty of Medicine (Wobeser), Queen's University, 
Kingston, Ont.; Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (Gonzalez, Hwang), 
Toronto, Ont.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to define rates and causes of death in custody and after 
release in people admitted to provincial custody in Ontario, and to compare 
these data with data for the general population.
METHODS: We linked data on adults admitted to provincial custody in Ontario in 
2000 with data on deaths between 2000 and 2012. We examined rates and causes of 
death by age, sex, custodial status and period after release, and compared them 
with data for the general population, using indirect adjustment for age.
RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2012, 8.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.3%-8.8%) of 
those incarcerated died in provincial custody or after release. The crude death 
rate was 7.1 (95% CI 6.9-7.3) per 1000 person-years. The standardized mortality 
ratio for those incarcerated in 2000 was 4.0 (95% CI 3.9-4.1) overall and 1.9 
(95% CI 1.5-2.4) while in provincial custody. The most common causes of death 
were injury and poisoning (38.2% of all deaths), including overdose (13.6%) and 
suicide (8.2%), diseases of the circulatory system (15.8%) and neoplasms 
(14.5%). In the 2 weeks after release, the standardized mortality ratio was 5.7 
overall and 56.0 for overdose. Life expectancy was 72.3 years for women and 73.4 
for men who experienced incarceration in 2000.
INTERPRETATION: Mortality was high for people who experienced incarceration, and 
life expectancy was 4.2 years less for men and 10.6 years less for women 
compared with the general population. Efforts should be made to reduce the gap 
in mortality between people who experience incarceration and those who do not. 
Time in custody could serve as an opportunity to intervene to decrease risk.

[Cost effectiveness of a theoretical cardiac rehabilitation program after 
myocardial infarction].

[Article in Spanish]

López-Montecinos P, Rebolledo S J, Gómez L JM.

BACKGROUND: Secondary prevention programs are an essential part of comprehensive 
care of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), and its effectiveness in 
reducing morbidity or mortality has been proved.
AIM: To determine the cost-effectiveness of a theoretical comprehensive cardiac 
rehabilitation (CCR) outpatient program after Myocardial Infarction, to be 
implemented in a Chilean Public Health System.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We designed a theoretical protocol of a CCR program based 
on recommendations of international guidelines, but adapted to local needs. A 
cost analysis was developed. Life years due to premature death were estimated 
with and without participation in CCR. The gained life-years and 
cost-effectiveness of the program were thus calculated.
RESULTS: The annual cost of cardiac rehabilitation center is $ 64,407,065 
Chilean pesos (CLP). The Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) considering 
a reduction of late mortality of 25%, is $ 475,209.7 CLP per year of life 
gained. Since this figure is lower than one unit of per capita gross domestic 
product, the intervention is considered very cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program after myocardial 
infarction is very cost-effective in the context of its implementation in a 
public health service.

CONTEXT: Although the acute hospital setting is not considered to be an ideal 
place of death, many people are admitted to hospital at the end of life.
OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to examine the reasons for hospital 
admissions that result in an expected death and the factors that play a role in 
the decision to admit to hospital.
METHODS: This was a survey among family physicians (FPs) about those of their 
patients who had died nonsuddenly in an acute university hospital setting in 
Belgium between January and August 2014. Questions were asked about the 
patient's health situation, care that the patient received before the admission, 
the circumstances of the hospital admission, the reasons necessitating the 
admission, and other factors that had played a role in the decision to admit the 
patient to hospital.
RESULTS: We received 245 completed questionnaires (response rate 70%), and 77% 
of those hospital deaths were considered to be nonsudden. FPs indicated that 55% 
of end-of-life hospitalizations were for palliative reasons and 26% curative or 
life-prolonging. Factors such as the patient feeling safer in hospital (35%) or 
family believing care to be better in hospital (54%) frequently played a role in 
the end-of-life hospitalization. When patients were admitted with a limited 
anticipated life expectancy, FPs were more likely to indicate that an inadequate 
caring capacity of the care setting had played a role in the admission.
CONCLUSION: To reduce the number of hospital deaths, a combination of structural 
support for out-of-hospital end-of-life care and a more timely referral to 
out-of-hospital palliative care services may be needed.
