BACKGROUND: Knee arthroplasty (KA) is a common intervention that can enhance the 
quality of life for patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). Post-surgery rehabilitation protocols often include continuous passive 
motion (CPM). However, CPM protocols vary considerably amongst institutions.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the current meta-analysis is to evaluate the 
effectiveness of continuous passive motion following total knee arthroplasty.
SEARCH STRATEGY: An electronic search of MEDLINE (1966 to 2002), EMBASE (1988 to 
2002), CINAHL (1982 to 2002), HEALTH STAR (1991 to 1994) and CURRENT CONTENTS 
(1997 to 2002) was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Following an a priori protocol, only randomized controlled 
trials of CPM for the treatment of participants post KA were eligible. Subjects 
were 18 years of age or older and had a pre-surgery diagnosis of degenerative 
joint disease. Both the experimental and control groups received physiotherapy. 
In addition to the physiotherapy intervention, the experimental group received 
CPM.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently selected trials for 
inclusion. Data were then extracted and the quality of the trial assessed using 
predetermined forms. Outcome measures of interest were: active and passive knee 
range of motion (ROM) length of hospital stay, pain, swelling and quadriceps 
strength. A fixed effects model was used throughout for continuous variables, 
except where heterogeneity existed; in which case, a random effects model was 
used. Results were analyzed as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI). Standardized mean differences (SMD) were used when 
different scales were used to measure the same concept (e.g. pain). Dichotomous 
outcomes were presented as a relative risk.
MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen trials were retained for analysis. Results favouring CPM 
were found for the main comparison of CPM combined with physiotherapy (PT) 
versus PT alone at end of treatment. For the primary outcomes of interest, CPM 
combined with PT was found to statistically significantly increase active knee 
flexion (WMD 4.30 degrees, 95% CI: 1.96, 6.63) and decrease length of stay (WMD 
-0.69 days, 95% CI: -1.35, -0.03). CPM was also found to decrease the need for 
post-operative manipulation (RR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.53). CPM did not 
significantly improve passive knee flexion and passive or active knee extension.
REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: CPM combined with PT, may offer beneficial results 
compared to PT alone in the short term rehabilitation following total knee 
arthroplasty.

BACKGROUND: Patients with known or suspected coronary disease are often 
investigated to facilitate risk assessment. We sought to examine the 
cost-effectiveness of strategies based on exercise echocardiography and exercise 
electrocardiography.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 7656 patients undergoing exercise testing; of 
whom half underwent exercise echocardiography. Risk was defined with the Duke 
treadmill score for those undergoing exercise electrocardiography alone, and by 
the extent of ischaemia by exercise echocardiography. Cox proportional hazards 
models, risk adjusted for pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease, were 
used to estimate time to cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Costs 
(including diagnostic and revascularisation procedures, hospitalisations, and 
events) were calculated, inflation-corrected to year 2000 using Medicare trust 
fund rates and discounted at a rate of 5%. A decision model was employed to 
assess the marginal cost effectiveness (cost/life year saved) of exercise echo 
compared with exercise electrocardiography. Exercise echocardiography identified 
more patients as low-risk (51% vs 24%, p<0.001), and fewer as intermediate- (27% 
vs 51%, p<0.001) and high-risk (22% vs 4%); survival was greater in low- and 
intermediate-risk and less in high-risk patients. Although initial procedural 
costs and revascularisation costs (in intermediate-high risk patients) were 
greater, exercise echocardiography was associated with a greater incremental 
life expectancy (0.2 years) and a lower use of additional diagnostic procedures 
when compared with exercise electrocardiography (especially in lower risk 
patients). Using decision analysis, exercise echocardiography ( in 2615/life 
year saved) was more cost effective than exercise electrocardiography.
CONCLUSION: Exercise echocardiography may enhance cost-effectiveness for the 
detection and management of at risk patients with known or suspected coronary 
disease.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Warfarin increases both the likelihood and the mortality 
of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), particularly in patients with a history of 
prior ICH. In light of this consideration, should a patient with both a history 
of ICH and a clear indication for anticoagulation such as nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation be anticoagulated? In the absence of data from a clinical trial, we 
used a decision-analysis model to compare the expected values of 2 treatment 
strategies-warfarin and no anticoagulation-for such patients.
METHODS: We used a Markov state transition decision model stratified by location 
of hemorrhage (lobar or deep hemispheric). Effectiveness was measured in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Data sources included English language 
literature identified through MEDLINE searches and bibliographies from selected 
articles, along with empirical data from our own institution. The base case 
focused on a 69-year-old man with a history of ICH and newly diagnosed 
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
RESULTS: For patients with prior lobar ICH, withholding anticoagulation therapy 
was strongly preferred, improving quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.9 QALYs. 
For patients with prior deep hemispheric ICH, withholding anticoagulation 
resulted in a smaller gain of 0.3 QALYs. In sensitivity analyses for patients 
with deep ICH, anticoagulation could be preferred if the risk of thromboembolic 
stroke is particularly high.
CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be 
offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep 
hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant 
therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk 
for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from 
long-term anticoagulation.

Accumulation of deficits as a proxy measure of aging.

This paper develops a method for appraising health status in elderly people. A 
frailty index was defined as the proportion of accumulated deficits (symptoms, 
signs, functional impairments, and laboratory abnormalities). It serves as an 
individual state variable, reflecting severity of illness and proximity to 
death. In a representative database of elderly Canadians we found that deficits 
accumulated at 3% per year, and show a gamma distribution, typical for systems 
with redundant components that can be used in case of failure of a given 
subsystem. Of note, the slope of the index is insensitive to the individual 
nature of the deficits, and serves as an important prognostic factor for life 
expectancy. The formula for estimating an individual's life span given the 
frailty index value is presented. For different patterns of cognitive 
impairments the average within-group index value increases with the severity of 
the cognitive impairment, and the relative variability of the index is 
significantly reduced. Finally, the statistical distribution of the frailty 
index sharply differs between well groups (gamma distribution) and morbid groups 
(normal distribution). This pattern reflects an increase in uncompensated 
deficits in impaired organisms, which would lead to illness of various 
etiologies, and ultimately to increased mortality. The accumulation of deficits 
is as an example of a macroscopic variable, i.e., one that reflects general 
properties of aging at the level of the whole organism rather than any given 
functional deficiency. In consequence, we propose that it may be used as a proxy 
measure of aging.

University, POBox 39040, IL-69978 Ramat Aviv, Israel. elie@post.tau.ac.il

Longer life expectancy is resulting in increasing numbers of elderly adults with 
intellectual disability (ID). There has been the question whether persons with 
ID demonstrate early signs of aging before the general population. The aim of 
this study was to determine if persons with ID (with and without Down syndrome) 
showed premature aging changes compared with a control group. Elderly persons (n 
= 24, average age of 61) from one residential care center in Israel and younger 
adults from another center (n = 37, average age of 45) were compared with 
elderly residents without ID in an independent living facility. The study 
considered demographic data, medical data, anthropometric measurements, body fat 
and body mass index, flexibility, and sensorimotor function tests. The results 
showed that the persons with ID had basically similar body composition to that 
of persons without ID, however, the functional performance of elderly adults 
with ID was more impaired. We postulate that the slower functioning responses 
may be explained by a less physically active lifestyle, that may accelerate the 
onset of disease and result in symptoms associated with aging that are 
detrimental to health. It is therefore important that persons with ID 
participate in physical activity and exercises in order to promote health and 
prevent disease.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the burden of disease in the Sfax region and identify the 
main diseases that are the cause of lost life years due to premature death.
METHODOLOGY: The calculation of lost life years due to premature death was 
conducted using the demographic mortality data for the region obtained from the 
National Institute of Statistics combined with data on the classification of the 
causes of death collected through a survey on these causes conducted through a 
random sample taken from half of the deaths in the region. As described by 
Murray and Lopez, years of life lost as a result of premature death represent 
the difference between the age of death and an age corresponding to life 
expectancy falling between 65 and 85 years.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 52,316 life years lost that were recorded 27,902 were 
in the male population and 24,414 in the female. The main diseases found in 
males which cause lost life years are accidents (24.9%), cardiovascular diseases 
(17.3%), communicable diseases (17%), respiratory diseases (10.8%), prenatal 
problems (59.5%), and cancer (7.5%). For women the main causes were 
cardiovascular diseases (26.5%), respiratory illness (15.5%), accidents (11.5%), 
communicable diseases (10.3%) and cancer (9.5%).
RECOMMENDATIONS: These results marking the epidemiological transition in the 
region should serve to steer decision-makers to better rationalize and plan for 
health care costs and expenditure.

Sciences, 4-9-1 Anagawa, Inage-ku, Chiba-Shi, Chiba 263-8555, Japan.

The life spans and spontaneous tumors in a total of 1960 Wistar Mishima 
(WM/MsNrs) rats, inbred strain, from the 80-130th generations were examined. The 
average life span (mean +/- SD) was 731 +/- 173 days (n = 1053) in the males and 
813 +/- 214 days (n = 907) in the females (p < 0.0001). The average life span of 
tumor-afflicted females was significantly longer than that of the non-tumor 
group (p < 0.0001), while no such difference was observed in males. Tumors were 
observed in 33 males (3.1%) and 246 females (27.1%). In the males, tumors were 
often observed under the skin (2.2%). Frequencies of tumors in lung and liver, 
bones and intestine were less than 0.5%. In the females, incidence of mammary 
tumor was 20.1%, and various organs such as ovaries, uterus, bones, lung, and 
liver had tumor incidence frequencies of less than 3.5%. It was concluded that 
WM/MsNrs rats might be suitable for life span and age-related studies because of 
their characteristics of length of longevity and the low incidence of 
spontaneous tumors in both sexes.

[Management of adverse reactions caused by cancer chemotherapy in elderly 
patients].

[Article in Japanese]

Okamoto H(1), Watanabe K.

With the prolongation of life expectancy in Japan, cancer is increasing in the 
elderly. Several retrospective studies have shown that the frequency of 
toxicity, response to chemotherapy and overall survival are similar in elderly 
and younger patients with cancer with good performance status. However, because 
many investigators have arbitrarily excluded elderly patients from clinical 
trials and there have been a few clinical trials for elderly patients with 
cancer, no standard treatment in the elderly has been established for most 
cancer. New therapeutic strategies are clearly needed to prolong survival, and 
to improve quality of life in elderly patients with cancer.

Advance directives for psychiatric treatment: a view from the trenches.

Miller RD(1).

(1)Department of Psychiatry, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, 4200 
East 9th Avenue, No. C249-27, Denver, Colorado 80262, USA.

Medical advance directives for end-of-life decisions at times that patients 
cannot express their preferences have become a major trend in recent state and 
federal legislation. The author argues that an extension of directives to cover 
future psychiatric treatment are fraught with both practical and ethical 
dilemmas. Although the potential for increasing patient autonomy is certainly 
positive, the potential for implementing covert ideological agendas has been 
present from the beginning, and the significant differences between medical 
end-of-life decisions and ongoing treatment of psychiatric patients must weigh 
against psychiatric advance directives unless major changes are made in existing 
procedures.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness 
of a continuous combined oral preparation of norethisterone (norethindrone) 
acetate and ethinylestradiol (NA/EE) [FemHRT] as both a first-line and 
second-line therapy for menopausal women.
PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer.
METHODS: The cost effectiveness of NA/EE was assessed as both a first- and 
second-line therapy in comparison with conjugated equine oestrogen 0.625mg and 
medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5mg (CEE/MPA) and no therapy. Analysis was 
conducted within a Markov model with states relating to the presence and absence 
of vaginal bleeding, menopausal symptoms and hip fracture. Analysis forecasted 
life expectancy, QALYs and lifetime costs for a 50-year-old menopausal woman. 
Compliance was modelled related to menopausal symptoms and vaginal bleeding. For 
the base-case analysis, it was assumed that compliant women would take therapy 
for up to 5 years. Sensitivity analysis assumed therapy was taken only for 1 
year.
RESULTS: Compared with both CEE/MPA and no therapy, NA/EE led to an increase in 
both costs and QALYs, both as a first- and second-line therapy. For first-line 
therapy, the incremental cost per QALY gained for NA/EE was $2200 Canadian 
dollars ($Can; 1999 values) [compared with no therapy] and was $Can20 300 
(compared with CEE/MPA). For second-line therapy, the incremental cost per QALY 
gained for NA/EE was $Can900 (compared with no therapy) and was $Can16 400 
(compared with CEE/MPA). Results were robust to most sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: NA/EE is a cost-effective therapy for women with menopausal 
symptoms both as a first-line and second-line therapy.

Forty octogenarians (OCTO) undergoing a variety of cardiac and thoracic aortic 
surgeries using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) between 1994 and 2002 were 
retrospectively studied. The results were compared with those of high-risk 
younger patients aged less than 60 years (YOUNG) (n=89). All patients had an 
expected operative mortality of EuroSCORE 5 and over. The EuroSCORE score was 
9.9+/-3.3 (range, 5-18) in the OCTO group and 6.8+/-2.3 (range, 5-16) in the 
YOUNG patients (p<0.0001). There were 4 (10%) and 10 (11%) hospital deaths, 
respectively (p>0.99). Major postoperative complications occurred in 50% of the 
OCTO and 36% of the YOUNG patients (p=0.17). There were 10 and 7 late deaths, 
respectively. Actuarial survival including hospital death was significantly 
lower in the OCTO group than in the YOUNG (p=0.033). Actuarial survival was 
significantly higher in female octogenarians than in male (p=0.046). The overall 
3-year survival rate was 88+/-8% and 64+/-11%, respectively. Multivariate 
analysis showed that predictors of late death were male gender (p=0.0005) and a 
high EuroSCORE (p=0.0010). Cardiac and thoracic aortic surgery using CPB can be 
performed in octogenarians with an acceptable hospital mortality rate and 
gratifying medium-term survival results.

The role of cerebrovascular disease in dementia.

DeCarli C(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, University of California at Davis, Sacramento, USA. 
cdecarli@ucdavis.edu

BACKGROUND: Improvements in health care over the last 50 years have lengthened 
average life expectancy significantly, resulting in considerable growth of the 
population over 65 years of age. With increased age, however, comes an increased 
risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the prevalence of AD is predicted to 
reach epidemic proportions by the later half of the 21st century. The prevalence 
of cerebrovascular disease also increases with age, and recent evidence suggests 
that cerebrovascular risk factors such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia 
also increase an individual's risk for AD, suggesting a potential interaction 
between these two very common disorders. The potential impact of cerebrovascular 
disease on general cognitive health is not yet well understood, but is now being 
actively explored and clarified.
REVIEW SUMMARY: Cerebrovascular disease may manifest itself in many ways, and 
this review begins by discussing the possible spectrum of brain injury 
associated with common cerebrovascular risk factors. The prominent role of brain 
imaging to detect clinically silent cerebrovascular disease is recognized and 
reviewed. The neuropsychological consequences of cerebrovascular disease across 
the cognitive spectrum is also reviewed, including potential mechanisms by which 
cerebrovascular disease may interact with AD to increase the expression or 
hasten the progression of dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Cerebrovascular risk factors, common to the elderly, lead to 
pernicious brain injury and subtle cognitive impairment that most probably 
places the individual at greater lifetime risk for dementia. The cause of 
dementia among individuals with cerebrovascular disease, however, remains AD. 
Recognition of the potential role of cerebrovascular disease as an independent 
risk factor for AD offers the possibility of primary prevention through 
treatment of well-recognized risk factors and deserves further study. In the 
meantime, clinicians presented with an individual suffering from a slowly 
progressive dementia and findings of clinically silent cerebrovascular brain 
injury should recognize the potential role of cerebrovascular disease in the 
dementia process but not ignore the likely overwhelming effects of AD and treat 
appropriately.

A potential error in evaluating cancer screening: a comparison of 2 approaches 
for modeling underlying disease progression.

sgoldie@hsph.harvard.edu

BACKGROUND: Evaluating cancer screening often requires modeling the underlying 
disease process and not observed disease, particularly in the absence of direct 
evidence linking screening to a survival benefit.
METHODS: To illustrate a potential error in modeling disease progression among 
healthy persons with a history of a precancerous lesion, we constructed 2 models 
with 4 basic health states (disease free, presence of a precancerous lesion, 
presence of cancer, dead), calibrated to predict the same 10-year cancer 
incidence. We assumed a homogeneous cohort enters each model free of disease, 
the probability of developing a precancerous lesion was greater for patients 
with a history of a prior lesion, and the screening test was perfect and 
riskless. In one model, we assigned a higher transition probability from a 
precancerous lesion to cancer in those with a history of a previously removed 
lesion; in the other, we assumed it was equal to those with no history.
RESULTS: Using the 1st model, life expectancy without screening was 2.4 months 
longer than with screening. This error did not occur using the 2nd model, in 
which the transition from precancerous lesions to cancer was not conditional on 
a history of a lesion. This modeling error's magnitude was examined under a 
variety of assumptions.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified an important error to avoid when modeling the 
underlying disease process in evaluating screening programs for cancers 
associated with precancerous states.

BACKGROUND: Guidelines are increasingly recommending preventive services 
starting at 50 years of age, and policymakers are considering such a 
recommendation for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination. The finding that 
pneumococcal vaccination is cost-saving for people 65 years of age or older 
raises the question of the vaccination's implications for other older adults, 
especially black people, whose disease incidence exceeds that of nonblack 
people, and those with high-risk conditions.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the implications of vaccinating black and nonblack people 
50 through 64 years of age against invasive pneumococcal disease.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature for vaccination effectiveness and cost 
estimates; data on disease incidence and case-fatality rates from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention.
TARGET POPULATION: Hypothetical cohort 50 through 64 years of age with the 1995 
U.S. age distribution.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination compared with no 
vaccination.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental medical costs and health effects, in 
quality-adjusted life-years per vaccinee.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Vaccination saved medical costs and improved 
health among high-risk black people (27.55 dollars savings per vaccinee) and 
nonblack people (5.92 dollars savings per vaccinee), excluding survivors' future 
costs. For low-risk black and nonblack people and the overall general 
population, vaccination cost 2477 dollars, 8195 dollars, and 3434 dollars, 
respectively, to gain 1 year of healthy life.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Excluding survivors' future costs, in the 
general immunocompetent population, cost per quality-adjusted life-year in 
global worst-case results ranged from 21 513 dollars for black people to 68 871 
dollars for nonblack people; in the high-risk population, cost ranged from 11 
548 dollars for black people to 39 000 dollars for nonblack people. In the 
global best case, vaccination was cost-saving for black and nonblack people in 
the general immunocompetent and high-risk populations, excluding survivors' 
future costs. The cost-effectiveness range was narrower in probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses, with 95% probabilistic intervals ranging from cost-saving 
to 1594 dollars for black people and from cost-saving to 12 273 dollars for 
nonblack people in the general immunocompetent population. Costs per 
quality-adjusted life-year for low-risk people with case-fatality rates from 
1998 were 2477 dollars for black people and 8195 dollars for nonblack people, 
excluding survivors' medical costs.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the current recommendation to vaccinate 
high-risk people and provide useful information for considering extending the 
recommendation to the general population 50 through 64 years of age. Lack of 
evidence about the effectiveness of revaccination for people 65 years of age or 
older, when disease risks are higher, argues for further research to guide 
vaccination policy.

Cisplatin based combination chemotherapy remains the mainstay for treatment of 
advanced urothelial cancer. The combination of 5-fluorouracil and interferon has 
been found to be effective second line treatment of advanced urothelial cancer. 
Hence, we tested the combination of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and interferon as 
first line therapy in advanced urothelial cancer. Eligible patients had to have 
no prior chemotherapy or interferon. Treatment consisted of cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) 
on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m(2) as a daily infusion for 5 
days and interferon alpha 2 B 5 MU/m(2) subcutaneously daily on day 1-5 of 
5-fluorouracil infusion. Cycles repeated every 21 days. Eighteen patients, of 
which sixteen were males were enrolled. Median age was 60 years. All patients 
had transitional-cell carcinoma. The median number of cycles given was 4. 
Thirteen patients were evaluable for response. Two patients achieved CR and 3 PR 
for an overall response rate of 28% (95% confidence interval 7% to 49%). Median 
response duration was 8.3 months. Median survival was 5.5 months. Four patients 
died secondary to chemotherapy toxicities. Those were GI perforation in one, 
bronchopneumonia in one, acute renal failure in one and one patient died at home 
3 weeks following the third cycle. The above regimen demonstrates excessive 
toxicity and moderate activity. It cannot be recommended in its present format. 
Novel anti-cancer agents need to explored.

refractory epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION: The cost-utility of vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) devices for 
medically refractory epilepsy has yet to be estimated.
METHODS: Using a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of VNS, we 
estimate that six people require implantation in order for one person to 
experience a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Costs averted from improved 
epilepsy control were ascertained from published literature. Values for health 
states were obtained from a series of 42 seizure clinic attenders using time 
trade-off techniques and the EQ-5D health status instrument. The cost per 
quality adjusted life year gained was estimated and the values obtained were 
tested in a sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Improved epilepsy control averted, on average, 745 pounds sterling 
health care costs per annum. People with epilepsy had great difficulty 
performing the time trade-off experiment, but those who managed to complete the 
task valued a 50% reduction in their own seizure frequency at 0.285 units. For a 
programme of six implants, the baseline model estimated the cost per quality 
adjusted life year gained at 28,849 pounds sterling. The most favourable 
estimate was equal to 4785 pounds sterling per quality adjusted life year 
gained, assuming that the number needed to treat was similar to published series 
in which one response was obtained for every three implants. The least 
favourable estimate was equal to 63,000 pounds sterling per quality adjusted 
life year gained, when EQ-5D utility values were used. The cost per quality 
adjusted life year gained was not sensitive to changes in length of stay, nor 
complication rates, but was significantly influenced by cost of device and 
device battery life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: There is not a strong economic argument against a programme of VNS 
implantation, although care should be taken to try and identify and treat those 
most likely to benefit.

Interleukin (IL)-6 is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian 
cancer. We investigated a common G/C polymorphism at position -174 of the IL-6 
gene (IL6) promoter in 121 patients with ovarian cancer using pyrosequencing. 
Presence of at least one mutant allele was associated with early tumor stage as 
well as an expanded length of disease-free (DFS) and overall survival with a 
dose-dependent effect regarding the carriage of 0, 1, and 2 alleles. In a 
multivariate Cox regression model incorporating tumor stage and residual tumor 
mass, presence of the -174 C allele of IL6 was the best predictor of DFS. We 
conclude that the mutant -174 C allele of IL6 influences the biological 
phenotype of ovarian cancer because it is associated with early stage and 
improved DFS and overall survival.

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), microsatellite instability (MSI) 
assays, and expression microarrays were used to molecularly subclassify a common 
set of gastric tumor samples. We identified a number of novel genomic 
aberrations associated with gastric cancer and discovered that gastric tumors 
could be grouped by their expression profiles into three broad classes: 
"tumorigenic," "reactive," and "gastric-like." Patients with gastric-like tumors 
exhibited a significantly better overall survival than patients belonging to the 
other two classes (P < 0.05). A novel supervised learning methodology for 
multiclass prediction was used to identify optimal predictor gene sets that 
accurately predicted the class of an unknown tumor sample. These predictor sets 
may prove useful in the development of new diagnostic applications for gastric 
cancer staging and prognostication.

of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the productivity losses and costs of injury and disease in 
China using an improved approach.
METHODS: Potentially productive years of life lost (PPYLL) were calculated for 
injury and four major disease groups (respiratory, cardiovascular, infectious, 
neoplastic).
DATA SOURCES: The mortality data are from the 1999 National Health Statistics 
Report and the morbidity data from the 1998 Second National Health Service 
Survey Report.
RESULTS: Injuries caused an annual PPYLL of 12.6 million years, more than for 
any disease group. The estimated annual economic cost of injury is equivalent to 
US dollars 12.5 billion, almost four times the total public health services 
budget of China. Motor vehicle fatalities accounted for 25% of the total PPYLL 
from all injury deaths.
CONCLUSION: Injury control and prevention programs merit priority to reflect the 
social and economic burden of injury in China.

USA. slantz@life.edu

STUDY DESIGN: Intraexaminer and interexaminer/procedure reliability and error 
analysis using a repeated-measures design.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify sources of discrepancies in cervical range of motion 
values between two procedures that use the same potentiometric technology.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Studies using an early version of an 
electrogoniometer system, which was connected between a helmet worn by the study 
participant and a chair on which they sat, reported unusually high values for 
active and passive cervical range of motion, although measurements were 
reliable. To understand the sources of the discrepancies between that study and 
later studies (using upgraded software), the current study was designed to 
quantify possible sources of error contributed by various components of the 
procedures: helmet, thoracic reference, chair, and software.
METHODS: A total of 22 asymptomatic study participants were evaluated in two 
separate sessions, 1-3 days apart. Components of two procedures were changed 
systematically in a series of repeated measurements to provide concurrent 
reliability and to assess sources of error between the two procedures.
RESULTS: The reliabilities of both procedures were generally high with no 
systematic trends, except for lower values for flexion-extension studies with 
Procedure 2. Procedure 2 also provided systematically greater range of motion 
values (2-8 degrees ) than Procedure 1, except for flexion (half-cycle). The 
source of the greatest discrepancy between the two procedures was the software, 
when comparing the original with the updated versions. With regard to the 
instrumentation, the greatest source of variability was in the thoracic 
reference post; next was the helmet, and least significant was the type of seat 
used. A comparison of overall procedure discrepancies and summation of 
individual elements of the procedures accounted for virtually all of the 
observed error.
CONCLUSION: The potentiometer-based electrogoniometer is a reliable instrument 
for determining cervical range of motion. Measurements appear to be more valid 
when the thoracic reference point is physically attached to the study 
participant's body. The original software provided with the system appears to 
have contributed to systematic overestimation of ranges of motion, but current 
units provide measurements that are both reliable and valid.

BACKGROUND: Thoracoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer has been performed 
as an alternative to open surgery to reduce surgical trauma. However, its effect 
on pulmonary function, exercise tolerability, and quality of life is unknown.
METHODS: Fifty-one patients with esophageal cancer underwent thoracic 
esophagectomy with radical lymphadenectomy by posterolateral thoracotomy (29 
cases) or thoracoscopic surgery (22 cases). Patients performed spirometry and 
exercise tolerance testing and completed a quality-of-life questionnaire before 
and 3 months after surgery.
RESULTS: Pre-to-postoperative change in vital capacity was 74.3 +/- 10.6% in the 
thoracotomy group and 84.9 +/- 10.4% in the thoracoscopy group (p = 0.021). 
Maximum oxygen uptake was similar, but dyspnea was the more common factor 
limiting exercise tolerance postoperatively in the thoracotomy group. Change in 
pre-to-postoperative performance status was 1.20 +/- 0.62 in the thoracotomy 
group and 0.55 +/- 0.51 in the thoracoscopy group (p = 0.0003).
CONCLUSIONS: Thoracoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer has better 
preservation of pulmonary function and quality-of-life.

The challenges of success: the aging of Israeli society.

In 2001 the number of residents aged 65 and over in Israel was 639,000, or 10% 
of the population. The rate of increase of the elderly population is twice that 
of the general population, thus the predicted number of elderly for 2020 is 
around 1,025,000, representing a 60% increase. While this process is determined 
by a decline in both fertility and mortality, in Israel, immigration has also 
been a central factor in the process of aging. Life expectancy stands at 76.7 
for men and 80.9 for women; at age 65 it is 16.4 years for men and 18.5 for 
women. The major factor influencing the increase in life expectancy during the 
past two decades has been the prevention of death among older people. Population 
aging, or "the demographic transition," also represents an "epidemiological 
transition"--from high rates of infectious and communicable diseases to high 
rates of chronic diseases among older people. During the past two decades, the 
number of disabled elderly has increased more than 2.5 times. In 2001, there 
were about 97,400 disabled elderly in Israel, constituting about 15% of all 
elderly. By the year 2010, the number of disabled elderly is expected to reach 
120,100. The rate of increase of the disabled elderly population is almost 
double that of the total elderly population due to changes in this population's 
composition. However, recent research indicates that new cohorts of elderly are 
healthier than earlier cohorts but experience a decline in health at older ages. 
While advances in standard of living, medicine and technology have made this 
possible, a greater allocation of resources is required to prevent disability 
and maintain the quality of life.

A therapeutic splint for hypertonic flexed elbow in upper motor neuron diseased 
patients.

Hospital, Ra'anana, Israel. ofkeren@internet-zahav.net

Change in muscle tonus is characteristic of upper motor neuron disease. Upper 
limb hypertonus is mostly experienced in the flexor muscles group, causing 
abnormal fixed flexion of the elbow. This in turn leads to functional 
impairments in daily life (especially in stability while standing and walking, 
and in activities such as dressing), often accompanied by chronic pain. 
Extension of the spastic elbow is therefore a significant target goal of the 
rehabilitation process of these patients. This study presents the development of 
a simple, cheap and easy-to-use splint aimed at keeping the elbow extended. The 
splint is made out of cloth and plastic strips with longitudinal pockets sown 
into a double layer cloth surface. The splint is then wrapped and tightened 
around the extended elbow. The splint was applied to 30 patients with hypertonic 
flexed elbow. Patients were asked to keep the splint wrapped around their elbows 
between one to five hours a day, for a period of three weeks. They were 
instructed to shorten the time of use whenever they felt pain, discomfort or 
extended pressure on the arm. Most of the patients completed the trial as 
instructed and expressed their wish to carry on using it. The reported "side 
effects" included discomfort, feeling of pressure at the critical points and 
difficult self-application of the splint. The final splint model was developed 
based on this feedback. Its efficacy in keeping the elbow in an extended 
position, its low cost price and easy use makes this splint a viable and simple 
tool for the rehabilitation process of upper motor neuron disease patients.

Appropriateness of laboratory testing in nursing home elderly with advanced 
dementia: an opinion poll among physicians.

Dharmarajan TS(1), Narayanan SL, Ali R, Ahmed S.

Author information:
(1)New York Medical College, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Dilemmas regarding selection of appropriate laboratory tests in older 
frail nursing home patients with advanced dementia are commonly encountered by 
physicians. Our objective was to study physician opinions about evaluating the 
appropriateness of laboratory testing in older hospitalized patients in nursing 
homes based on a real case.
SETTING: A 750-bed university teaching hospital in the Bronx that regularly 
receives acutely ill older residents from long-term care facilities, with 
medical care provided by residents, fellows, and teaching faculty.
DESIGN: An opinion poll was conducted among 53 physicians. Information was 
provided on the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings of a 
92-year-old woman with advanced Alzheimer's dementia admitted for 
gastrointestinal bleeding to the acute care Geriatrics unit. A questionnaire 
sought opinions on selection of laboratory tests (emphasizing Troponin I) and 
management in this patient. Chi-square analysis was performed to analyze the 
data
RESULTS: The majority of polled physicians (37/53, P = 0.01) felt that ordering 
Troponin I in the setting described hindered patient care and stated they would 
not have ordered the test. The opinion on overall management was divided (P = 
0.861).
CONCLUSION: Dilemmas regarding choosing appropriate laboratory tests, including 
their implications for care, are found frequently in the setting of frail, 
demented elderly from nursing homes hospitalized for acute care. We suggest that 
the choice of tests in these subjects with advanced dementia be individualized 
based on due consideration for life expectancy, quality of life, and surrogate 
opinion.
