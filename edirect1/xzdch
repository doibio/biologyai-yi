Open-source software tools are often used for analysis of scientific image data 
due to their flexibility and transparency in dealing with rapidly evolving 
imaging technologies. The complex nature of image analysis problems frequently 
requires many tools to be used in conjunction, including image processing and 
analysis, data processing, machine learning and deep learning, statistical 
analysis of the results, visualization, correlation to heterogeneous but related 
data, and more. However, the development, and therefore application, of these 
computational tools is impeded by a lack of integration across platforms. 
Integration of tools goes beyond convenience, as it is impractical for one tool 
to anticipate and accommodate the current and future needs of every user. This 
problem is emphasized in the field of bioimage analysis, where various rapidly 
emerging methods are quickly being adopted by researchers. ImageJ is a popular 
open-source image analysis platform, with contributions from a global community 
resulting in hundreds of specialized routines for a wide array of scientific 
tasks. ImageJ's strength lies in its accessibility and extensibility, allowing 
researchers to easily improve the software to solve their image analysis tasks. 
However, ImageJ is not designed for development of complex end-to-end image 
analysis workflows. Scientists are often forced to create highly specialized and 
hard-to-reproduce scripts to orchestrate individual software fragments and cover 
the entire life-cycle of an analysis of an image dataset. KNIME Analytics 
Platform, a user-friendly data integration, analysis, and exploration workflow 
system, was designed to handle huge amounts of heterogeneous data in a 
platform-agnostic, computing environment and has been successful in meeting 
complex end-to-end demands in several communities, such as cheminformatics and 
mass spectrometry. Similar needs within the bioimage analysis community led to 
the creation of the KNIME Image Processing extension which integrates ImageJ 
into KNIME Analytics Platform, enabling researchers to develop reproducible and 
scalable workflows, integrating a diverse range of analysis tools. Here we 
present how users and developers alike can leverage the ImageJ ecosystem via the 
KNIME Image Processing extension to provide robust and extensible image analysis 
within KNIME workflows. We illustrate the benefits of this integration with 
examples, as well as representative scientific use cases.

The canonical mammalian Hippo pathway contains a core kinase signaling cascade 
requiring upstream MST to form a stable complex with SAV1 in order to 
phosphorylate the downstream LATS/MOB complex. Though SAV1 dimerization is 
essential for the trans-activation of MST, the molecular mechanism underlying 
SAV1 dimerization is unclear. Here, we discover that the SAV1 WW tandem 
containing a short Pro-rich extension immediately following the WW tandem 
(termed as "WW12ex") forms a highly stable homodimer. The crystal structure of 
SAV1 WW12ex reveals that the Pro-rich extension of one subunit binds to both WW 
domains from the other subunit. Thus, SAV1 WW12ex forms a domain-swapped dimer 
instead of a WW2 homodimerization-mediated dimer. The WW12ex-mediated 
dimerization of SAV1 is required for the MST/SAV1 complex assembly and MST 
kinase activation. Finally, we show that several cancer-related SAV1 variants 
disrupt SAV1 dimer formation, and thus, these mutations may impair the 
tumor-suppression activity of SAV1.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Prognosis of COPD is usually expressed as a 3-year 
survival rate, which might not be easily understood by lay people. This study 
estimates the life expectancy (LE) and loss-of-LE for COPD patients with 
different GOLD stages and patients with a history of acute exacerbation (AE) 
requiring hospitalization (severe AE) in the preceding year.
METHODS: 532 patients who were diagnosed with COPD according to the GOLD 
criteria at NCKU hospital between 2006 and 2016 were recruited. Survival was 
estimated by Kaplan-Meier method, and extrapolated to lifetime to obtain the LE. 
The loss-of-LE was quantified by subtracting the LE of the COPD cohort from 
national life tables. The survival of patients with severe AE history was 
validated by a nation-wide cohort from the National Health Insurance dataset.
RESULTS: The survival of patients with severe stage COPD (GOLD grades 3 and 4) 
was almost the same as those patients with a history of severe AE and the 
loss-of-LE for the former and the latter were 9.3 (1.1) and 9.4 (1.3) years, 
respectively. The nation-wide cohort with severe AE history (n = 44,764) showed 
a loss-of-LE of 8.3 (0.1) years. The loss-of-LE of patients with moderate stage 
COPD (GOLD grade 2) was 6.2 years, but no reduction in LE was noted for mild 
stage COPD (GOLD grade 1).
CONCLUSIONS: We successfully estimated LE and loss of LE in COPD patients under 
the GOLD criteria. The survival of severe stage COPD patients is almost the same 
as those with severe AE history, or about 8-9 years of life lost.

BACKGROUND: People who are dependent on opioids have increased risk of premature 
death, but there are few estimates of life expectancy.
METHODS: We calculated age-specific mortality rates in a cohort of people who 
had at least one prescription of an opioid agonist (methadone or buprenorphine) 
between 2001 and 2018 in New South Wales, Australia. We used life tables to 
estimate life expectancy at age 18. We also estimated the potential years of 
life lost before age 75, decomposed by cause of death.
RESULTS: The cohort included 47,197 people, with a median of 9.8 years of 
follow-up. 5097 participants died, and the standardised mortality ratio 
(compared to the general population of New South Wales) was 6.06 (95% CI 
5.90-6.23). Life expectancy at age 18 was an additional 47.5 years (95% CI 
42.9-50.5) for men and 50.7 years (95% CI 45.4-54.8) for women; deficits of 14.7 
and 15.8 years respectively when compared to the general population. The largest 
cause of death was non-communicable physical diseases, which accounted for 47% 
of deaths in life tables for men and 42% for women. Drug-related deaths 
accounted for 16% of deaths for men and 19% for women, but due to the young age 
at which these deaths occur, they contributed approximately one third of 
potential years of life lost.
CONCLUSION: In common with people with serious mental illnesses, people who are 
dependent on opioids have substantially reduced life expectancy. In both 
populations most excess deaths relate to non-communicable physical diseases.

This paper analyses two strategies to reduce the use of pesticides in grain 
production. We study Norwegian farmers' willingness to voluntarily forego income 
by reducing pesticide use as well as their responses to a doubling of the 
pesticide price (through increased pesticide taxes). We use mixed methods 
including an experiment, a survey and focus group discussions. The experiment 
shows that most farmers are willing to sacrifice some income to reduce 
environmental risks by using less pesticide. According to the survey, they are, 
at the same time, relatively insensitive to a 100% price increase on herbicides 
and fungicides. While the response to the price increase probably would have 
been stronger if differentiated between chemicals, our research indicates 
potential benefits from supporting voluntary action. Value orientations and 
agronomic conditions influence the stated responses in both circumstances. 
Respondents emphasizing environmental values are more willing to voluntarily 
reduce pesticide use and show a greater response to the economic incentive than 
farmers emphasizing economic outcome and issues such as clean fields. A 
hypothesized willingness to reduce pesticide use voluntarily to strengthen the 
reputation of the sector was, however, rejected. Farmers appear to have few 
alternatives to pesticides, but increased knowledge about the alternatives that 
do exist, seems able to promote some change. Our findings suggest that the 
extension service should put greater emphasis on these options, even if they may 
have negative effects on income.

This study evaluated the contribution of avoidable causes of death to gains in 
life expectancy between 1998 and 2017 in Korea. This is a multi-year, 
cross-sectional study using national data. Death certificate data from 1998 to 
2017 were obtained from Statistics Korea. The difference in life expectancy 
between 1998 and 2017 by age and cause of death were decomposed using Arriaga's 
method. Life expectancy rose 7.73 years over 20 years in Korea, which was 
largely (more than 50%) due to changes in avoidable causes of death. As age 
increased, the contribution to changes in life expectancy increased, and the 
gain in life expectancy due to avoidable causes also tended to increase. The 
major factors that drove that gain in life expectancy were avoidable causes such 
as cerebrovascular diseases and traffic accidents. The gain in life expectancy 
from preventable diseases was greater in men than in women. The results of this 
study indicate that active public health programs have been effective in 
improving life expectancy in Korea. Moreover, avoidable mortality could be 
further improved with good public health policy. Health policy aimed at reducing 
amenable and preventable deaths should be further implemented to promote 
population health.

Formation and regulation of properly sized epithelial tubes is essential for 
multicellular life. The excretory canal cell of C. elegans provides a powerful 
model for investigating the integration of the cytoskeleton, intracellular 
transport, and organismal physiology to regulate the developmental processes of 
tube extension, lumen formation, and lumen diameter regulation in a narrow 
single cell. Multiple studies have provided new understanding of actin and 
intermediate filament cytoskeletal elements, vesicle transport, and the role of 
vacuolar ATPase in determining tube size. Most of the genes discovered have 
clear homologues in humans, with implications for understanding these processes 
in mammalian tissues such as Schwann cells, renal tubules, and brain 
vasculature. The results of several new genetic screens are described that 
provide a host of new targets for future studies in this informative structure.

Association of Cardiometabolic Multimorbidity Pattern with Dietary Factors among 
Adults in South Korea.

Science, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Korea.

Korea.

Globally, cardiometabolic multimorbidity pattern (CMP) is a complex chronic 
health status that negatively effects the life expectancy of adults globally, 
even more than single diseases. We aimed to identify multimorbidity patterns in 
Korean adults to clarify the associations between dietary factors and CMP. 
Nationally representative data of 9011 Korean adults aged 19-64 years were 
obtained from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(KNHANES) from the period 2013 to 2015. Multimorbidity patterns for CMP, 
inflammatory disease, cancer and other disease patterns were identified by 
exploratory factor analysis. Dietary factors including food and nutrient intake 
and dietary habits were evaluated. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression 
models examined the associations between dietary factors and CMP. More than half 
of the multimorbidity patterns were CMP (n = 4907, 54.5%); CMP subjects were 
more likely to be older, male, less educated, lower income, laborers, smokers, 
and high-risk consumers of alcohol than those of non-CMP subjects. A higher 
intake of calcium (OR = 0.809, 95% CI = 0.691-0.945), potassium (OR = 0.838, 95% 
CI = 0.704-0.998), and fruits (OR = 0.841, 95% CI = 0.736-0.960) were inversely 
associated with the prevalence of CMP, while the consumption of irregular meals 
(OR = 1.164, 95% CI = 1.034-1.312) and skipping breakfast (OR = 1.279, 95% CI = 
1.078-1.518) was positively related to a 16% and 28% higher likelihood of CMP, 
respectively. CMP accounts for more than half of the multimorbidity patterns in 
the Korean population, and lower intake of calcium, potassium, fruits, and 
skipping meals have strong associations with CMP.

PURPOSE: To estimate survival curves in patients with hip fracture according to 
gender, age, type of fracture, and waiting time for surgery and to compare them 
with the life expectancy of the general population. The study hypothesis is that 
survival after hip fractures is significantly lower than in the general 
population, especially in cases that underwent delayed surgery, regardless of 
age and gender.
METHODS: A survival analysis study was designed and approved by our 
institutional ethics review board. All patients who were coded with a diagnosis 
of hip fracture from 2002 to 2018 were included in the study. A total of 1176 
patients were included, and the median age was 81 years (18-105 years). 
Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were performed to compare survival curves 
between those who underwent surgery on time and those with surgical delays. An 
exponential multivariate regression model was estimated, and a hazard ratio (HR) 
was reported for age, gender, and wait time for surgery. A significance of 5% 
was used, and a confidence interval level of 95% was reported.
RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier curves for delayed surgery (log-rank, p = 0.00) and 
the age group (log-rank, p = 0.00) were significantly different. Exponential 
regression estimated an HR 1.05 (1.05-1.07) for age, HR 1.80 (1.51-2.13) for 
men, and HR 1.93 (1.61-2.31) for each day of wait for surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The 2 significant findings of this study are that hip fracture 
patients over 40 years old have a higher risk of dying at any time compared to 
the general population and that the waiting time for surgery (a modifiable 
factor) decreases survival rates at any time.

With a world population living longer as well as marked disparities in life 
expectancy, understanding the determinants of longevity is one of the priority 
research agendas in 21st century life sciences. To this end, the blind mole-rat 
(Spalax leucodon), a subterranean mammalian, has emerged as an exceptional model 
organism due to its astonishing features such as remarkable longevity, hypoxia 
and hypercapnia tolerance, and cancer resistance. The microbiome has been found 
to be a vital parameter for cellular physiology and it is safe to assume that it 
has an impact on life expectancy. Although the unique characteristics of Spalax 
make it an ideal experimental model for longevity research, there is limited 
knowledge of the bacterial composition of Spalax microbiome, which limits its 
in-depth utilization. In this study, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we 
report the gut and skin bacterial structure of Spalax for the first time. The 
diversity between fecal and skin samples was manifested in the distant 
clustering, as revealed by beta diversity analysis. Importantly, the 
longevity-linked Muribaculaceae bacterial family was found to be the dominating 
bacterial taxa in Spalax fecal samples. These new findings contribute toward 
further development of Spalax as a model for longevity research and potential 
linkages between microbiome composition and longevity.

BACKGROUND: Influenza epidemics significantly weight on the Brazilian healthcare 
system and its society. Public health authorities have progressively expanded 
recommendations for vaccination against influenza, particularly to the pediatric 
population. However, the potential mismatch between the trivalent influenza 
vaccine (TIV) strains and those circulating during the season remains an issue. 
Quadrivalent vaccines improves vaccines effectiveness by preventing any 
potential mismatch on influenza B lineages.
METHODS: We evaluate the public health and economic benefits of the switch from 
TIV to QIV for the pediatric influenza recommendation (6mo-5yo) by using a 
dynamic epidemiological model able to consider the indirect impact of 
vaccination. Results of the epidemiological model are then imputed in a 
health-economic model adapted to the Brazilian context. We perform deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to account for both epidemiological and 
economical sources of uncertainty.
RESULTS: Our results show that switching from TIV to QIV in the Brazilian 
pediatric population would prevent 406,600 symptomatic cases, 11,300 
hospitalizations and almost 400 deaths by influenza season. This strategy would 
save 3400 life-years yearly for an incremental direct cost of R$169 million per 
year, down to R$86 million from a societal perspective. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios for the switch would be R$49,700 per life-year saved 
and R$26,800 per quality-adjusted life-year gained from a public payer 
perspective, and even more cost-effective from a societal perspective. Our 
results are qualitatively similar in our sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that switching from TIV to QIV to protect 
children aged 6mo to 5yo in the Brazilian influenza epidemiological context 
could have a strong public health impact and represent a cost-effective strategy 
from a public payer perspective, and a highly cost-effective one from a societal 
perspective.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current state of 
health economic evaluations (HEEs) submitted by pharmaceutical companies to the 
Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) as part of their pricing and reimbursement (P&R) 
dossiers, and to explore potential future actions in order to enhance their 
quality.
METHODS: All company dossiers submitted from October 2016 to December 2018 were 
reviewed to select those containing pharmacoeconomic studies. The general 
characteristics of HEEs were described and their quality assessed based on a 
checklist adapted from Philips et al. (Review of guidelines for good practice in 
decision-analytic modelling in health technology assessment. Health Technol 
Assess. 2004;8: 1-158).
RESULTS: Of the 299 dossiers submitted to AIFA, 105 included one or more 
pharmacoeconomic studies, of which fifty-three were cost-effectiveness analyses. 
Overall, the compliance of the HEEs with the quality checklist was highly 
variable: some studies reached high methodological standards whereas others had 
serious flaws (mean 59.22 percent, range 19.35-90.32 percent). The main 
weaknesses were the unjustified exclusion of relevant alternatives, poor 
description and justification of model data and assumptions, and insufficient 
exploration of uncertainty and study validity. Non-homogeneity across studies 
was found in study perspectives, discount rates, methods for costing, estimating 
quality-adjusted life-years and conducting sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, the recommended actions for 
increasing the quality of HEEs within reimbursement submissions in Italy are 
twofold: first, to set methodological standards for conducting and reporting 
HEEs; second, to strengthen the internal assessment process, also through the 
acquisition of companies' models and re-evaluation of results. These actions 
will hopefully provide greater contribution to the evidence-based P&R decision 
making.

OBJECTIVE: Hip fractures in frail elderly patients are associated with 
significant mortality and morbidity. Surgery remains the predominant treatment 
of choice, despite the poor prognosis. Limited research has been done with 
regards to nonoperative management of frail elderly patients with a hip fracture 
and therefore the natural course is relatively unknown. This systematic review 
aimed to provide an overview of the prognosis of nonoperative management in 
frail elderly patients with a hip fracture in terms of mortality, complications, 
mobility, and quality of life (QoL).
DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, 
and Cochrane Central. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed. The primary 
outcome measurement was 30-days mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 4,318 studies were screened. In total eighteen studies 
matched the eligibility criteria; with low to moderate quality. Approximately 
two-thirds of the patients were managed nonoperatively due to medical reasons 
and one-third due to non-medical reasons. Pooled mortality rates after 30 days, 
six months and one year were 36%, 46%, and 60%, respectively. 33% of the 
patients developed in-hospital complications. At six months post trauma, 9.6% of 
the patients were able to mobilize. Data on quality of life (QoL), functional 
outcome, pain, comfort during nursing care, and costs were not reported.
CONCLUSION: Nonoperative management of frail elderly patients with a hip 
fracture is associated with a poor prognosis. Heterogenous study cohorts and 
limited outcomes were reported. Current literature shows a lack of evidence of 
the true prognosis of nonoperative management of frail elderly patient with a 
hip fracture and a limited life expectancy. Results of this review can be used 
to aid decision making and improve expectation management.

BACKGROUND: The phase 3 SPARTAN study evaluated apalutamide versus placebo in 
patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) and 
prostate-specific antigen doubling time of ≤10 mo. At primary analysis, 
apalutamide improved median metastasis-free survival (MFS) by 2 yr and overall 
survival (OS) data were immature.
OBJECTIVE: We report the prespecified event-driven final analysis for OS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1207 patients with nmCRPC 
(diagnosed by conventional imaging) were randomised 2:1 to apalutamide (240mg/d) 
or placebo, plus on-going androgen deprivation therapy. After MFS was met and 
the study was unblinded, 76 (19%) patients still receiving placebo crossed over 
to apalutamide.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: OS and time to cytotoxic 
chemotherapy (TTChemo) were analysed by group-sequential testing with 
O'Brien-Fleming-type alpha spending function.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At median 52-mo follow-up, 428 deaths had occurred. The 
median treatment duration was 32.9 mo for apalutamide group and 11.5 mo for 
placebo group. Median OS was markedly longer with apalutamide versus placebo, 
reaching prespecified statistical significance (73.9 vs 59.9 mo, hazard ratio 
[HR]: 0.78 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.64-0.96]; p=0.016). Apalutamide also 
lengthened TTChemo versus placebo (HR: 0.63 [95% CI, 0.49-0.81]; p=0.0002). 
Discontinuation rates in apalutamide and placebo groups due to progressive 
disease were 43% and 74%, and due to adverse events 15% and 8.4%, respectively. 
Subsequent life-prolonging therapy was received by 371 (46%) patients in the 
apalutamide arm and by 338 (84%) patients in the placebo arm including 59 
patients who received apalutamide after crossover. Safety was consistent with 
previous reports; when adverse events were adjusted for treatment exposure, rash 
had the greatest difference of incidence between the apalutamide and placebo 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Extension of OS with apalutamide compared with placebo conferred 
impactful benefit in patients with nmCRPC. There was a 22% reduction in the 
hazard of death in the apalutamide group despite 19% crossover (placebo to 
apalutamide) and higher rates of subsequent therapy in the placebo group.
PATIENT SUMMARY: With data presented herein, all primary and secondary study end 
points of SPARTAN were met; findings demonstrate the value of apalutamide as a 
treatment option for nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the 2-year cost-utility 
ratio between tapering conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drugs (csDMARD) first followed by the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitor, or 
vice versa, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Two-year data of the Tapering strategies in Rheumatoid Arthritis trial 
were used. Patients with RA, who used both a csDMARD and a TNF-inhibitor and had 
a well-controlled disease (disease activity score ≤2.4 and swollen joint 
count≤1) for at least 3 months, were randomised into gradual tapering the 
csDMARD first followed by the TNF-inhibitor, or vice versa. Quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) were derived from the European Quality of life questionnaire 
with 5 dimensions. Healthcare and productivity costs were calculated with data 
from patient records and questionnaires. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio and the incremental net monetary benefit were used to assess cost 
effectiveness between both tapering strategies.
RESULTS: 94 patients started tapering their TNF-inhibitor first, while the other 
95 tapered their csDMARD first. QALYs (SD) were, respectively, 1.64 (0.22) and 
1.65 (0.22). Medication costs were significantly lower in the patients who 
tapered the TNF-inhibitor first, while indirect cost were higher due to more 
productivity loss (p=0.10). Therefore, total costs (SD) were €38 833 (€39 616) 
for tapering csDMARDs first, and €39 442 (€47 271) for tapering the 
TNF-inhibitor (p=0.88). For willingness-to-pay (WTP) levels <€83 800 tapering, 
the csDMARD first has the highest probability of being cost effective, while for 
WTP levels >€83 800 tapering the TNF-inhibitor first has the highest 
probability.
CONCLUSION: Our economic evaluation shows that costs are similar for both 
tapering strategies. Regardless of the WTP, tapering either the TNF-inhibitor or 
the csDMARD first is equally cost effective.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), responsible for acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS, is a major public health problem. In Belgium, 
2 to 3 new cases are diagnosed every day. Since the advent of combined 
antiretroviral treatments in 1996, the life expectancy and quality of life of 
infected patients have greatly improved. However, to date there is no cure for 
HIV. Individuals infected with HIV must remain on antiretroviral treatment for 
life. One of the reasons for the difficulty in finding a cure for HIV is that 
the virus can remain in a latent form, i.e. dormant, in some of the cells it 
infects. These latent reservoirs are not recognized by the immune system and can 
reactivate and thus restart the infection if the patient stops the treatment. 
These latent reservoirs are therefore a major obstacle to cure HIV and a great 
deal of research is being conducted by the scientific community to find an 
eradication strategy. In this article, we will present the different 
characteristics of these latent reservoirs and the different strategies put in 
place to identify and eliminate them.

Publisher: Le virus de l’immunodéficience humaine (VIH), responsable du syndrome 
d’immunodéficience acquise ou SIDA, est un problème de santé publique majeur. En 
Belgique, 2 à 3 nouveaux cas sont diagnostiqués par jour. Depuis l’arrivée des 
traitements antirétroviraux combinés en 1996, l’espérance et la qualité de vie 
des patients infectés se sont grandement améliorées. Cependant, il n’existe, à 
ce jour, aucun traitement curatif de cette infection. Les individus atteints 
doivent rester sous traitement antirétroviral toute leur vie. Cette difficulté à 
trouver un traitement curatif du VIH provient, notamment, du fait que le virus 
peut rester sous une forme latente, c’est-à-dire endormie, dans certaines 
cellules qu’il infecte. Ces réservoirs latents ne sont pas reconnus par le 
système immunitaire et peuvent se réactiver lorsque le patient arrête son 
traitement et ainsi redémarrer l’infection. Ces réservoirs latents sont, donc, 
un obstacle majeur à la guérison et de nombreuses recherches sont menées par la 
communauté scientifique afin de trouver une stratégie d’éradication. Dans cet 
article, nous présentons les différentes caractéristiques de ces réservoirs 
latents et les différentes stratégies mises en place pour les identifier et 
tenter de les éliminer.

The antiretroviral therapy (ART) has proven its effectiveness in improving the 
life expectancy of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
Based on the inhibition of HIV replication, ART ensures the reduction of plasma 
viral load to undetectable levels on long-term. Unfortunately, once ART is 
interrupted, the viral load rises up. Consequently, the therapy remains not 
curative. The reasons for this failure lie in the presence of latent reservoirs 
of the virus and/or the presence of ongoing replication, responsible for the 
persistence of the virus. This ongoing replication despite ongoing therapy has 
been demonstrated in sanctuary sites where the penetration of antiretroviral 
drugs is suboptimal. Moreover, some treatment intensification studies, mostly 
through addition of an integrase inhibitor, transiently resulted in increases in 
HIV replication by-products, highlighting that such strategies could reduce 
ongoing replication. Although the debate is still open, confirming the presence 
of this ongoing replication and finding strategies to eliminate it would be part 
of the key to a cure for HIV.

Publisher: Le traitement antirétroviral (ART) a prouvé son efficacité ces 
vingt-cinq dernières années en améliorant l’espérance de vie des personnes 
infectées par le virus de l’immunodéficience humaine (VIH), et en empêchant la 
transmission du virus. Basé sur l’inhibition de la réplication du VIH, ce 
traitement permet de diminuer la charge virale plasmatique du virus, à des 
niveaux indétectables, de façon durable. Malheureusement, le traitement n’est 
pas curatif et un arrêt de celui-ci résulte inévitablement en un rapide rebond 
de la virémie. Les raisons de cet échec sont, d’une part, la présence de 
réservoirs latents du virus et, d’autre part, la persistance d’une réplication 
du virus à bas bruit, malgré le traitement. Cette réplication se produirait dans 
les sites sanctuaires où la concentration des antirétroviraux serait 
sous-optimale. Des études d’intensification du traitement antirétroviral, par 
ajout d’une drogue supplémentaire (généralement, un inhibiteur de l’intégrase), 
ont produit des résultats en faveur de la persistance d’une réplication continue 
du virus, malgré le traitement préalable, chez certains patients. Comprendre ce 
phénomène et développer des stratégies visant à l’éliminer constituent des 
éléments clés dans la quête d’une guérison des patients infectés par le VIH.

This research aimed to investigate the effects of resistance exercise on 
symptoms, physical function, and quality of life (QoL) in gastrointestinal 
cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Patients were quasi-randomly divided 
into the resistance exercise group and the relaxation control group, and 
machine-based resistance exercise was performed twice a week for 12 weeks under 
the guidance of experienced therapists. The QoL of patients was analyzed by 
EORTC-QLQ-C30. Resistance exercise training significantly reduced the incidences 
of lack of energy (inter-group P = .011), nausea (inter-group P = .007), acid 
reflux (inter-group P = .042), and back pain (inter-group P = .0009). Twelve 
weeks of resistance exercise training significantly elevated the muscular 
strength of leg press (inter-group P = .021) and leg extension (inter-group 
P = .041), and the muscular endurance of leg press (inter-group P = .005). The 
participants' performance in 6-m fast walk (inter-group P = .008), 6-m backwards 
walk (inter-group P = .016), and chair rise (inter-group P = .031) were 
dramatically improved. Fatigue (inter-group P = .024) and appetite loss 
(inter-group P = .012) in the resistance exercise group were significantly lower 
than the relaxation control group. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of 
resistance exercise on symptoms, physical function and QoL in gastrointestinal 
cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy were demonstrated. Resistance exercise 
training reduced the incidences of nausea and acid reflux, improved physical 
function, and alleviated fatigue and appetite loss in gastrointestinal cancer 
patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease defined as the presence of 
endometrial tissue outside the uterus that causes pelvic pain and infertility. 
We used the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2017 to comprehensively analyze 
the burden of endometriosis between 1990 and 2017. DisMod-MR 2.1 was used to 
estimate the incidence and prevalence in some countries/territories with sparse 
or absent data. Annual percent changes were calculated to quantify endometriosis 
burden estimate trends. Furthermore, the sociodemographic index (SDI) was used 
to assess the relationship between endometriosis burden estimates and 
development level. Between 1990 and 2017, endometriosis age-standardized 
incidence and prevalence and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) 
decreased globally by 0.21% (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.23% to -0.20%), 
0.29% (95% CI: -0.31% to -0.28%), and 0.28% (95% CI: -0.30% to -0.27%) per year, 
respectively. Apart from the high SDI quintiles with increasing trends of 
endometriosis incidence rate, prevalence rate, and YLDs, decreasing trends were 
observed in all SDI quintiles for all burden estimates. In conclusion, it 
appears that all endometriosis burden estimates have decreased globally between 
1990 and 2017. However, these results are based on limited data and highlight 
the need for increased data collection on the incidence and prevalence of 
endometriosis.

AIMS: Heart failure (HF) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), common co-morbidities, 
translate into worse patient prognoses and higher direct costs than for either 
condition alone. Empagliflozin has been shown to markedly reduce cardiovascular 
(CV) deaths and HF hospitalizations (HHF) in HF patients with T2D. This study 
evaluated the lifetime cost-effectiveness of supplementing standard of care 
(SoC) with empagliflozin, relative to SoC alone, in HF patients with T2D from 
the UK payer perspective.
METHODS AND RESULTS: An existing discrete-event simulation model was adapted for 
the economic evaluation. Risk equations developed from time-dependent parametric 
survival analyses using patient-level HF subpopulation data from the EMPA-REG 
OUTCOME trial were employed to predict CV and renal events. Non-CV death, 
utility weights, and costs were drawn from UK sources. Quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) and costs were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Relative to SoC, 
empagliflozin with SoC yielded fewer first HHF, recurrent HHF, CV death, and 
non-fatal myocardial infarction but more non-fatal stroke events. Empagliflozin 
with SoC vs. SoC alone was associated with increased average life expectancy 
(10.80 vs. 9.59 LYs) and quality of life (6.27 vs. 5.62 QALYs), though at higher
