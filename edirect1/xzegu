(England) in 2010 for the years up to 2020, including any deaths recorded. 
Expected deaths were calculated from annual Office of National Statistics 
mortality rate and life expectancy by age and gender, adjusted for the local 
Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). This provided the SMR deprivation (SMRd), 
and life expectancy years lost per death (LEYLD). The effects of treatment type, 
and clinical features on SMRd relative to sex were examined by univariable and 
multivariable analysis.
RESULTS: Data from n = 11,806 (F = 5184; M = 6622) patients were included. Of 
these, n = 5540 were newly diagnosed and n = 3921 died (F = 1841; M = 2080). In 
total, n = 78,930 patient years. The expected deaths numbered n = 2596 (adjusted 
for age, sex, and IMD). Excess deaths were n = 1325 (F = 689; M = 636). Life 
expectancy years lost (LEYL) 18,989 (F = 9714; M = 9275). SMRd 1.51 (F = 1.60; 
M = 1.44) and LEYLD 4.84 years (F = 5.28; M = 4.46). The impact of risk factors 
was not different by sex. However, women had higher prevalence of % diagnosed 
>65 years of age; % last eGFR <60 mLs/min/1.73 m2 , and lower prevalence of % 
prescribed ACE-inhibitor/ARB, DPP4-inhibitor and SGLT2-inhibitor. Applying the 
male prevalence rate to the female population and expected mortality suggested 
n = 437 (55%) of excess T2D female deaths were attributed to sex difference in 
the prevalence of these risk and protective factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes in women with T2DM are worse than in men, contributed to 
by greater prevalence of adverse factors and less prescribing of 
cardioprotective medication.

BACKGROUNDS: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a serious condition that poses 
threats to patients' quality of life and life expectancy. Cardiac rehabilitation 
is a crucial treatment option that can improve outcomes for CVD patients. Hybrid 
comprehensive telerehabilitation (HCTR) is a relatively new approach. In the 
context of pandemics, HCTR can minimize the risk of cluster infections by 
reducing hospital visits while delivering effective rehabilitation care. This 
study is aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of HCTR as a secondary 
prevention measure for CVD patients compared to usual rehabilitation care.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, The Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, 
and PsychINFO for all related studies up to January 20, 2023. Two reviewers 
independently screened the titles and abstracts of potentially eligible articles 
based on the predefined search criteria. Data were analyzed using a 
comprehensive meta-analysis software (RevMan5.3).
RESULTS: Eight trials, involving 1578 participants, were included. HCTR and 
usual rehabilitation care provide similar effects on readmission rates (odds 
ratio (OR) = 0.90 (95% CI 0.69-1.17), P = 0.43) and mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 
1.06 (95% CI 0.72-1.57), P = 0.76). Effects on Short Form-36 Health Status 
Questionnaire (SF-36) score were also similar (SMD: 1.32 (95% CI-0.48-3.11), P = 
0.15). Compared with usual rehabilitation care, HCTR can improve peak oxygen 
uptake (VO2 peak) (SMD: 0.99 (95% CI 0.23-1.74), P = 0.01) and 6-minute walking 
test (6MWT) (SMD: 10.02 (95% CI 5.44-14.60), P < 0.001) of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that HCTR is as effective as traditional 
rehabilitation care in reducing readmission rates and mortality and improving 
quality of life in patients with CVD. However, HCTR offers the added advantage 
of improving VO2 peak and 6MWT, measurements of cardiorespiratory fitness and 
functional capacity, respectively. These results suggest that HCTR can be a safe 
and effective alternative to traditional rehabilitation care, offering numerous 
benefits for CVD patients. Clinical Study Registration Number. This trial is 
registered with NCT02523560 and NCT02796404.

BACKGROUND: Inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) function can 
improve the efficacy of immunotherapy by modulating the tumor immune 
microenvironment. AK112 is the first-in-class humanized IgG1 bispecific antibody 
targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1) and VEGF. This study aimed to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of AK112 combined with chemotherapy in patients with 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: This open-label, multicenter, phase II clinical trial was conducted in 
11 hospitals in China. Eligible participants were adults aged 18-75 years with 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status of 0 or 1, at least one measurable lesion, and an estimated 
life expectancy of at least 3 months. The participants were categorized into 
three cohorts based on prior therapy and functional genomic alterations. 
Patients in cohort 1 were previously untreated advanced NSCLC, had no epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene 
modifications, and received AK112 combined with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) for 
non-squamous (non-sq)-NSCLC or paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for sq-NSCLC plus 
carboplatin (area under the curve of 5 mg/mL per min) for four cycles, followed 
by AK112 with pemetrexed for non-sq-NSCLC and AK112 alone for sq-NSCLC as 
maintenance therapy. The participants in cohort 2 had advanced NSCLC with 
EGFR-sensitive mutations, failed previous EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) 
therapy, and received pemetrexed plus AK112 and carboplatin for four cycles, 
followed by pemetrexed plus AK112 as maintenance therapy. The participants in 
cohort 3 had advanced NSCLC who failed systemic platinum-based chemotherapy and 
anti-PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) treatments and received AK112 plus 
docetaxel (75 mg/m2). Two dosages of AK112 (10 or 20 mg/kg) were examined in 
each cohort, and the drug was administered intravenously on day 1 of each 3-week 
treatment cycle. The primary endpoints were the investigator-assessed objective 
response rate (ORR) and safety. This study was registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04736823).
FINDINGS: Eighty-three patients were enrolled from February 2021 to August 2022 
and received the study treatment. Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 had 44, 19, and 20 
patients, respectively. The confirmed ORR was 53.5% (23/43) [95% CI, 36.9-67.1], 
68.4% (13/19) [95% CI, 43.4-87.4], and 40.0% (8/20) [95% CI, 19.1-63.9] in 
cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In cohort 1, the median PFS was not reached, 
and the 12-month PFS rate was 59.1%. In cohorts 2 and 3, the median PFS were 8.5 
[95% CI, 5.5-NE] and 7.5 [95% CI, 2.3-NE] months, and the 12-month PFS rates 
were 35.5% and 44.5%, respectively. The most common grade ≥3 treatment-related 
adverse events were decreased white blood cell count [7 (8.4%)], neutropenia [5 
(6.0%)], thrombocytopenia [2 (2.4%)], anemia [4 (4.8%)], and myelosuppression [2 
(2.4%)].
INTERPRETATION: AK112 plus platinum-doublet showed promising antitumor activity 
and safety not only in first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC patients without 
driver mutation but also in patients with EGFR-functional mutation who failed 
previous EGFR-TKI therapy and advanced NSCLC patients who failed prior systemic 
platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatments, suggesting a 
valuable potential new treatment option for this patient population.

BACKGROUND: This review aimed to synthesize intervention models involving the 
role of adolescent and family support as part of comprehensive care to improve 
self-efficacy and self-management among adolescents with Diabetes Mellitus (DM).
METHODS: A review was conducted to conform to Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) 
standards. We searched PubMed, Research Gate, Science Direct, Cochrane Library 
databases, and grey literature. We included articles exploring family 
intervention models on improving self-efficacy and self-management among 
adolescents with DM, published from January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2022, and in 
English. Articles were declared eligible, reviewed critically, and then 
synthesized narratively.
RESULTS: We identified 487 abstracts and title records from the initial search 
and excluded 409 irrelevant studies. Sixty-six full-text articles were screened, 
and nine were included in the synthesis. Five articles presented findings from 
using models focusing on child and adolescent intervention, while in the 
remaining four articles, the intervention models involved adolescents and their 
caregivers or parents. Only two models provide comprehensive care that requires 
collaboration among healthcare providers, patients, and families. Adolescent 
self-efficacy and self-management schemes as intermediary variables are closely 
related to everything that can influence health behavior, metabolic control, and 
quality of life for adolescents, which requires support from a multidisciplinary 
collaborative team.
CONCLUSION: Excellent comprehensive care team collaboration involving family 
support is essential to increase the self-efficacy and self-management of 
adolescents with DM.

OBJECTIVE: Comparative evidence suggests that the impact of COVID-19 on life 
expectancy has been relatively milder in South Korea. This study aims to examine 
whether the pandemic has universal or unequal impacts on life expectancy across 
250 districts with varying levels of deprivation.
METHODS: Using mortality data from 2012 to 2021 obtained from the Microdata 
Integrated Service of Statistics Korea, we calculated life expectancy at birth 
and age 65 for both sexes, by deprivation quintiles, before and during the 
pandemic. We summarized life expectancy gaps using the slope of the inequality 
index (SII) and further decomposed the gaps by the contribution of age and cause 
of death using Arriaga's method.
RESULTS: Both men and women experienced consistent improvements in life 
expectancy from 2012 to 2019, but the trend was disrupted during 2020 and 2021, 
primarily driven by older people. While men in more deprived areas were 
initially hit harder by the pandemic, the life expectancy gap across deprivation 
quintiles remained relatively constant and persistent across the study period 
[SII: -2.48 (CI: -2.70 from -2.27) for 2019 and - 2.84 (CI: -3.06 from -2.63) 
for 2020]. Middle-aged men from the most deprived areas were the most 
significant contributors to the life expectancy gap, with liver disease, liver 
cancer, transport accidents, and intentional injuries being the leading causes, 
both in the pre and during the pandemic. While these contributors remained 
largely similar before and during the pandemic, the contribution of transport 
accidents and liver cancer to the male life expectancy gap slightly decreased 
during the pandemic, while that of ischemic heart disease and pneumonia slightly 
increased. A similar increase was also observed for the female life expectancy 
gap.
CONCLUSION: This study found no clear evidence of an increased life expectancy 
gap during the pandemic in South Korea, unlike in other countries, although 
access to emergency healthcare services may have been slightly more disturbed in 
deprived areas. This achievement can provide lessons for other countries. 
However, the persistent regional gaps in life expectancy observed over the past 
decade indicate the need for more targeted public health policies to address 
this issue.

Although chemotherapy has increased the life expectancy of cancer patients, its 
toxic side effects remain a major challenge. Recently, organometallic compounds, 
such as Schiff base copper complexes, have become promising candidates for 
next-generation anticancer drugs owing to their unique anticancer activities. In 
this study, binuclear copper(II) complex-1 and mononuclear copper(II) complex-2 
were examined to analyze their anticancer mechanisms further. For this purpose, 
a viability test, flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis and the cell cycle, 
migration assay, and gene expression analysis were performed. According to our 
results, complex-1 was more cytotoxic than complex-2 at 24/48-h intervals. Our 
findings also demonstrated that both complexes induced apoptosis at IC50 
concentrations and arrested the cell cycle at the G1-S checkpoint. However, 
complex-1 accelerates cell cycle arrest at the sub-G0/G1 phase more than 
complex-2 does. Furthermore, gene expression analysis showed that only complex-1 
induces the expression of p53. Interestingly, both complexes induced Bcl-2 
overexpression. However, they did not affect MMP-13 expression. More 
interestingly, both complexes inhibited cell migration in different ways, 
including amoeboid and collective, by recruiting protease-independent pathways. 
This study confirmed that adding several metal cores and co-ligands increased 
the activity of the complex. It also appeared that Cu-containing complexes could 
prevent the migration of cancer cells through protease-independent pathways, 
which can be used for novel therapeutic purposes.

Changes in salinity is a stressful and energy-consuming process in fish which 
give rise to mortalities, especially in fish fingerlings that are more sensitive 
during the early stages of their life. In the present study, the effects of 
three salinities, 3‰ (downstream of river), 8‰ (estuarine), and 13‰ (the maximum 
salinity in the Caspian Sea), on HSP70 gene expression, cortisol level, immune 
response (lysozyme, complement C3, IgM), and antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, 
CAT, T-AOC) of the stellate sturgeon fingerlings in the presence of HSP inducer 
compound (TEX-OE®) were evaluated. Our results showed that levels of plasma 
cortisol and heat shock protein (HSP70) in Acipenser stellatus fingerlings 
increased due to salinity changes. In the presence of the HSP inducer, HSP70 
expression in both gill and liver was significantly increased, whereas cortisol 
level was notably decreased. Exposure to salinity changes resulted in an 
increase in antioxidant defense activities (SOD, CAT, and T-AOC) and immune 
response (lysozyme, IgM, and C3) in the presence of an HSP inducer. In 
conclusion, an HSP-inducing compounds can have a positive effect in 
strengthening the immunity and antioxidant system of sturgeon fingerlings by 
increasing the expression of the HSP70 gene against salinity fluctuations and 
generally increase the body's physiological tolerance.

Scientific evidence reported that surrounding greenspace could promote better 
mental health. Considering bipolar disorder as the health outcome, this study 
aimed to investigate the association between greenspace and bipolar disorder in 
Taiwan and quantified the benefits of greenspace on bipolar disorder adjusted 
for the international greenspace availability standard. By examining datasets 
across 348 townships, two quantitative measures (i.e., disability-adjusted life 
year loss and income) were used to represent the benefits. The incidence rate of 
bipolar disorder was obtained from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research 
Database. Normalized different vegetation index (NDVI) was measured as a proxy 
for the greenspace availability. A generalized additive mixed model coupled with 
a sensitivity test were applied to evaluate the statistical association. The 
prevented fraction for the population (PFP) was then applied to develop a 
scenario for quantifying benefit. The result showed a significant negative 
association between greenspace and bipolar disorder in Taiwan. Compared to low 
greenspace, areas with medium and high greenspace may reduce the bipolar risk by 
21% (RR = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.76-0.83) and 51% (RR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.45-0.53). 
Calculating benefits, we found that the development of a scenario by increasing 
greenspace adjusted for availability indicator in township categorized as low 
greenspace could save in DALY loss due to bipolar disorder up to10.97% and 
increase in income up to 11.04% from the current situation. Lastly, this was the 
first study in Asia-Pacific to apply a customized greenspace increment scenario 
to quantify the benefits to a particular health burden such as bipolar disorder.

In food production sectors, food spoilage and contamination are major issues 
that threaten and negatively influence food standards and safety. Several 
physical, chemical, and biological methods are used to extend the shelf-life of 
food products, but they have their limitations. Henceforth, researchers and 
scientists resort to novel methods to resolve these existing issues. 
Nanomaterials-based extension of food shelf life has broad scope rendering a 
broad spectrum of activity including high antioxidant and antimicrobial 
activity. Numerous research investigations have been made to identify the 
possible roles of nanoparticles in food preservation. A wide range of 
nanomaterials via different approaches is ultimately applied for food 
preservation. Among them, chemically synthesized methods have several 
limitations, unlike biological synthesis. However, biological synthesis 
protocols are quite expensive and laborious. Predominant studies demonstrated 
that nanoparticles can protect fruits and vegetables by preventing microbial 
contamination. Though several nanomaterials designated for food preservation are 
available, detailed knowledge of the mechanism remains unclear. Hence, this 
review aims to highlight the various nanomaterials and their roles in increasing 
the shelf life of food products. Adding to the novel market trends, 
nano-packaging will open new frontiers and prospects for ensuring food safety 
and quality.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In order to find the exact strategies in the prevention of 
cardiovascular diseases (CVD), it is necessary to assess their risk factors 
systematically. Here, we used the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) to review the 
long-term trends and epidemiological characteristics among Chinese.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We comprehensively analyzed the burden of CVD for the 
Chinese population using GBD 2019, including prevalence, incidence, mortality, 
years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Then, we analyzed trends over time, and 
predicted mortality and morbidity, using joinpoint regression, age-period-cohort 
(APC) model, and Bayesian APC approach. Finally, we analyzed the attributable 
burden of CVD. In 2019, the prevalence of CVD in China was 120 million, 
representing a 140.02% increase since 1990. The number of DALYs attributed to 
CVD increased by 52.56% compared to 1990. Joinpoint showed a fluctuating 
incidence downward, while mortality significantly declined. The APC fitting 
results indicated that recent generations have a higher prevalence than the 
past, and the prevalence has increased among individuals of the same age group. 
The BAPC predicted that CVD's prevalence and mortality in the Chinese would 
stabilize and decline between 2020 and 2030, with a significant decline among 
males. The main CVD-attributable burdens in 2019 were metabolic risks, 
especially high blood pressure.
CONCLUSION: Given China's large and rapidly aging population, the burden of CVD 
is a major concern. Practical strategies to prevent and manage CVD are urgently 
needed to address this public health challenge.

As life expectancy increases and the population grows, the number of surgeries 
performed each year is likely to continue to increase. We evaluated whether 
surgery with general anesthesia increases risk for cognitive impairment in a 
Chinese elderly community population. The current data was obtained from the 
China Longitudinal Aging Study (cohort 1) and Shanghai Brain Aging study (cohort 
2). Cohort 1 included 1545 elderly people with normal cognitive function, who 
underwent a screening process that included physical examination, medical 
history, baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments of cognitive function by a 
face-to-face interview. Cohort 2 included an additional 194 elderly people with 
normal cognitive function, all of whom, unlike cohort 1, underwent T1-phase MR 
imaging scans. In cohort 1, 127 elderly people with normal cognitive function 
transformed into mild cognitive impairment, 27 into dementia, while 1391 still 
maintained normal cognitive function. By using Cox regression analysis, we found 
that surgery with general anesthesia was a risk factor for cognitive impairment 
(p = 0.013, HR = 1.506, 95% CI 1.091-2.078); In cohort 2, we found that elderly 
people with a history of surgery with general anesthesia had lower Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and smaller right amygdala volume (p < 0.05). 
Through correlation analysis, we found that the volume of the right amygdala was 
significantly correlated (p = 0.003, r = 0.212) with MoCA. Then by using the 
linear regression analysis (mediation model), we found that surgery with general 
anesthesia directly affected the MoCA score by affecting the volume of the right 
amygdala (B = 1.315, p = 0.036 95% CI 0.088-2.542). We confirm surgery with 
general anesthesia as a risk factor for cognitive impairment, and its mechanism 
may be related to its effect on the volume of the right amygdala.

An improved Fenton-microwave synergistic method was employed to extract 
polysaccharides from Gelidium amansii (GAPs), which were subsequently purified 
through alcohol precipitation, deproteinization, and gel chromatography. The 
effects of GAPs on oxidative stress resistance and abnormal glycometabolism were 
investigated using Caenorhabditis elegans. The polysaccharide yield reached 
54.17 % ± 0.27 % under the following conditions: solid-liquid ratio of 
1:102 g/mL, temperature of 80 °C, H2O2 concentration of 1.0 %, microwave power 
of 700 W, and 33 min. The purified GAPs were heteropolysaccharides primarily 
composed of mannose, ribose, glucuronic acid, glucose, galactose, xylose, and 
arabinose, with a molar ratio of 0.287:0.524:0.634:2.646:89.649:5.416:0.463. The 
weight-average and numerical-average molecular weights of the GAPs were 
determined to be 142.800 kDa and 75.255 kDa, respectively. Treatment of C. 
elegans with GAPs at 2.0 mg/mL resulted in a significant extension of the mean 
lifespan by 53.85 % compared to the negative control (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 
GAPs exhibited notable enhancements in the antioxidant system, including SOD by 
56.90 % and CAT by 96.83 % (p < 0.05). Additionally, GAPs led to reductions in 
glucose-related metabolites, including glucose levels by 34.54 % and pyruvic 
acid levels by 149.54 % (p < 0.05). These findings demonstrate the excellent 
performance of GAPs in enhancing the antioxidant system and regulating abnormal 
glycometabolism.

BACKGROUND: The pathfinder6 (NCT02137850) international phase 3 trial examined 
immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of the extended half-life factor VIII 
(FVIII) replacement product N8-GP (turoctocog alfa pegol; Esperoct) in 
previously untreated patients (PUPs) with hemophilia A.
OBJECTIVES: We present end-of trial results for extended PUP N8-GP treatment for 
up to a median (range) 2.5 (0.0; 7.4) years.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Longer-term N8-GP treatment in PUPs with hemophilia A was 
examined. The prophylaxis regimen was ∼60 IU/kg N8-GP i.v. twice weekly, or 
every 3 or 7 days. The primary endpoint was the incidence of FVIII inhibitors.
RESULTS: Overall, 81 patients received N8-GP and were included in this analysis. 
The inhibitor incidence was 30.0% (15.7% high-titer [>5 BU]) for the extension 
phase. Patients had a median (range) 2.9 (0.1; 7.2) years of prophylaxis 
following the pre-prophylaxis period. During prophylaxis, the median annualized 
bleeding rate (ABR) (interquartile range) was 1.4 (0.6; 3.5), 13% of patients 
experienced no bleeding episodes, and 55.1% of patients experienced no 
spontaneous bleeds. The proportion of patients without any spontaneous bleeding 
episodes increased after the first year of prophylaxis. The hemostatic success 
rate in the treatment of bleeding episodes was 87.6%. No additional safety 
concerns were observed in patients with previously reported observation of 
temporarily decreased incremental recovery (IR).
CONCLUSION: Long-term end-of-trial PUP N8-GP prophylaxis data indicate that PUPs 
respond well to long-term N8-GP treatment. The inhibitor incidence was 
consistent with previous results. Median ABR during prophylaxis was 1.4. There 
were no lasting clinical impacts or safety concerns for patients with an 
observation of temporarily decreased IR.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of utilizing IDegLira in 
comparison to other treatment regimens ( liraglutide and degludec) in managing 
type 2 diabetes, taking into account the Chinese healthcare system's 
perspective.
METHODS: The clinical data were obtained from the randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) of the DUAL I and DUAL II evidence studies that took place in China. To 
estimate the lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and direct medical 
costs of patients receiving different treatment strategies from a long-term 
perspective, the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model version 9.0 (IQVIA, Basel, 
Switzerland) was utilized. The costs were evaluated from the perspective of the 
China National Health System. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted 
annually at 5%, and sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: IDegLira was projected to reduce the incidence of diabetes-related 
complications and improve quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) versus 
liraglutide and degludec. A survival benefit was observed with IDegLira over 
Liraglutide (0.073 years). Lifetime costs were lower by Chinese yuan (CNY) 
27,945 on IDegLira than on Liraglutide therapy. A similar survival benefit was 
observed with IDegLira over degludec (0.068 years). Lifetime costs were lower by 
CNY 1196 on IDegLira than on degludec therapy. Therefore, IDegLira was found to 
be cost-effective versus liraglutide and degludec with incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of Dominant per QALY gained, respectively, under the 
threshold of three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in China.
CONCLUSION: IDegLira is a cost-effective hypoglycemic treatment option that 
delivers positive clinical outcomes while also reducing costs for Chinese 
patients living with type 2 diabetes.

The energy industry significantly contributes to anthropogenic methane 
emissions, which add to global warming and have been linked to an increased risk 
of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This study aims to evaluate the relationship 
between energy-related methane emissions and the burden of CVD, measured in 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), in 2019. We conducted a cross-sectional 
analysis of datasets from 73 countries across all continents. The analyzed 
datasets included information from 2019 on environmental energy-related methane 
emissions, burden of DALYs due to CVD. The age-standardized prevalence of 
obesity in adults and life expectancy at birth were retrieved. The relationship 
between the variables of interest was evaluated using multiple linear regression 
models. In the multiple model, we observed a positive linear association between 
methane emissions and the log-transformed count of DALYs related to CVD. 
Specifically, for each unit increase in energy-related methane emissions, the 
burden of CVD increased by 0.06% (95% CI 0.03-0.09%, p < 0.001). The study 
suggests that reducing methane emissions from the energy industry could improve 
public health for those at risk of CVD. Policymakers can use these findings to 
develop strategies to reduce methane emissions and protect public health.

Spinal muscular atrophy is an autosomal recessive disease resulting in motor 
neuron degeneration and progressive life-limiting motor deficits when untreated. 
Onasemnogene abeparvovec is an adeno-associated virus serotype 9-based gene 
therapy that improves survival, motor function, and motor milestone achievement 
in symptomatic and presymptomatic patients. Although the adeno-associated virus 
genome is maintained as an episome, theoretical risk of tumorigenicity persists 
should genomic insertion occur. We present the case of a 16-month-old male with 
spinal muscular atrophy who was diagnosed with an epithelioid neoplasm of the 
spinal cord approximately 14 months after receiving onasemnogene abeparvovec. In 
situ hybridization analysis detected an onasemnogene abeparvovec nucleic acid 
signal broadly distributed in many but not all tumor cells. Integration site 
analysis on patient formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples failed to 
detect high-confidence integration sites of onasemnogene abeparvovec. The 
finding was considered inconclusive because of limited remaining tissue/DNA 
input. The improved life expectancy resulting from innovative spinal muscular 
atrophy therapies, including onasemnogene abeparvovec, has created an 
opportunity to analyze the long-term adverse events and durability of these 
therapies as well as identify potential disease associations that were 
previously unrecognized because of the premature death of these patients.

Although health inequality is a growing concern, striking differences in health 
and life expectancy still exist across and within OECD countries. In Oslo, the 
largest city in Norway, life expectancy differs by up to 7 years between 
districts. Equal access to healthcare can help reduce social differences in 
health. However, research indicates that older people at the lower level of the 
social gradient have more difficulty accessing health services. Older people 
experience early hospital discharge and several transitions between and across 
care levels. In this study, using Bourdieu's theory of practice as a theoretical 
lens, we explore social inequality in access to universal healthcare within care 
trajectories for older people in Oslo. Through observation of family meetings in 
intermediate care (N = 14) and semi-structured interviews with older patients 
(N = 15), informal caregivers (N = 12) and healthcare professionals (N = 18), 
the study identifies 15 unique care trajectories from hospital to home via 
intermediate care. Informed by a critical realist perspective and moving from 
west to east via the urban areas, there is a prominent finding of climbing down 
the social gradient and, subsequently, reduced access to healthcare. An 
overarching theme, 'Navigating the healthcare maze', was identified along with 
two subthemes: 'Individuality meets system' and 'Having a feel for the game'. 
Navigating the healthcare maze depends on where you live, your level of 
education and health literacy and the ability to mobilize social networks. 
Furthermore, it is an advantage to fit into the professional habitus of the 
'active patient' discourse. The findings will be relevant for politicians, 
managers, healthcare professionals and other stakeholders working in the field 
and in the development of services adapted to the needs of various socioeconomic 
groups.
