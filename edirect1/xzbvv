components income, education and life expectancy.
METHODS: This ecological study evaluate the spatiotemporal trend of standardized 
incidence ratio of AIDS among adults in Brazil from 2006 to 2012 and its 
relationship with HDI by using a Bayesian analysis, considering the Brazilian 
Federal Units as units of analysis. The proposed statistical model allows 
obtaining a standardized incidence ratio (SIR, adjusted by gender and age).
RESULTS: Among the men, our results show higher incidence rates in the States of 
the Southern regions as well as in the state of Amazonas (Northern Brazil). In 
females, we found other patterns for SIR, with higher incidence rates in the 
states of Rio de Janeiro (Southeast region), Rio Grande do Sul and Santa 
Catarina (both in Southern region). Among men it was observed as an expressive 
association between the SIR values and the overall HDI and income and education 
components, but it was observed to have an inverse association with the life 
expectancy component. Among women, it is noted that the SIR values are 
associated with the overall HDI and the education components only at the 
beginning of the studied period.
DISCUSSION: AIDS remains a major public health problem in Brazil, mainly in the 
southern and southeastern regions of the country. Considering its association 
with HDI, it is noted that the disease still remains related to the pattern 
observed in the early years of the studied period, at least in the more 
developed regions of Brazil. This certainly happened because of the chronicity 
of the disease, thus affecting people with good socioeconomic status.

Schizophrenia is a serious psychotic disorder, with disabling symptoms and 
markedly reduced life expectancy. The onset is usually in late adolescence or 
early adulthood, which in time overlaps with the maturation of the brain 
including the myelination process. Interestingly, there seems to be a link 
between myelin abnormalities and schizophrenia. The oligodendrocyte-derived 
myelin membranes in the CNS are highly enriched for lipids (cholesterol, 
phospholipids and glycosphingolipids), thereby pointing at lipid homeostasis as 
a relevant target for studying the genetics and pathophysiology of 
schizophrenia. The biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol is regulated by 
the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors 
SREBP1 and SREBP2, which are encoded by the SREBF1 and SREBF2 genes on 
chromosome 17p11.2 and 22q13.2, respectively. Here we review the evidence for 
the involvement of SREBF1 and SREBF2 as genetic risk factors in schizophrenia 
and discuss the role of myelination and SREBP-mediated lipid biosynthesis in the 
etiology, pathophysiology and drug treatment of schizophrenia.

To clarify the functional changes after hospitalization due to pneumonia in 
elderly Japanese patients, we investigated the changes in physical functioning, 
nutritional routes, and diet that occurred after hospitalization in patients 
with nursing and healthcare-associated pneumonia (NHCAP). We analyzed 405 
patients with NHCAP and compared findings with 448 patients with 
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Among the NHCAP patients, 140 (34%) patients 
showed a decline in activities of daily living function between baseline and 
discharge. After hospital discharge, 149 (37%) NHCAP patients did not return to 
the same residence location compared with where they were living prior to 
hospital admission. The frequency of this outcome was significantly higher in 
NHCAP patients than in CAP patients (p < 0.0001). After 6 months' follow-up, of 
the patients who transferred to different hospitals, 41 (73%) patients with CAP 
had returned to their own home, but only 16 (20%) patients with NHCAP could 
return home (p < 0.0001). Rates of alteration of nutritional route and type of 
diet from oral nutrition were significantly higher in NHCAP patients compared 
with CAP patients (22% vs 4%, p < 0.0001). Our results demonstrated that 
approximately one-third of hospitalized patients with NHCAP showed a decline in 
physical function. In addition, approximately one-fifth of NHCAP patients had 
changed their route of nutrition and type of diet. Our results indicated that 
physicians should attach greater importance to preventative measures against 
NHCAP rather than relying on antibiotic therapy post-infection in the management 
of pneumonia in elderly patients in order to extend their healthy life 
expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is a common cause of shortened life expectancy. We aimed to 
assess the association between diabetes and cause-specific death.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used the pooled analysis of individual data from 
12 Spanish population cohorts with 10-year follow-up. Participants had no 
previous history of cardiovascular diseases and were 35-79 years old. Diabetes 
status was self-reported or defined as glycemia >125 mg/dL at baseline. Vital 
status and causes of death were ascertained by medical records review and 
linkage with the official death registry. The hazard ratios and cumulative 
mortality function were assessed with two approaches, with and without competing 
risks: proportional subdistribution hazard (PSH) and cause-specific hazard 
(CSH), respectively. Multivariate analyses were fitted for cardiovascular, 
cancer, and noncardiovascular noncancer deaths.
RESULTS: We included 55,292 individuals (15.6% with diabetes and overall 
mortality of 9.1%). The adjusted hazard ratios showed that diabetes increased 
mortality risk: 1) cardiovascular death, CSH = 2.03 (95% CI 1.63-2.52) and PSH = 
1.99 (1.60-2.49) in men; and CSH = 2.28 (1.75-2.97) and PSH = 2.23 (1.70-2.91) 
in women; 2) cancer death, CSH = 1.37 (1.13-1.67) and PSH = 1.35 (1.10-1.65) in 
men; and CSH = 1.68 (1.29-2.20) and PSH = 1.66 (1.25-2.19) in women; and 3) 
noncardiovascular noncancer death, CSH = 1.53 (1.23-1.91) and PSH = 1.50 
(1.20-1.89) in men; and CSH = 1.89 (1.43-2.48) and PSH = 1.84 (1.39-2.45) in 
women. In all instances, the cumulative mortality function was significantly 
higher in individuals with diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is associated with premature death from cardiovascular 
disease, cancer, and noncardiovascular noncancer causes. The use of CSH and PSH 
provides a comprehensive view of mortality dynamics in a population with 
diabetes.

Improving the Physical Health Monitoring of City & Hackney Assertive Outreach 
Service Patients.

Improving physical healthcare to reduce premature mortality in people with SMI 
(Serious Mental Illness) is a priority for ELFT (East London NHS Foundation 
Trust) and NHS England. It is well know that people with schizophrenia have a 
life expectancy which is approximately 20% shorter than that of the general 
population and a substantial mortality difference exists between people with 
schizophrenia and the general community.[1-2] Among other risk factors, such as 
poor diet, physical inactivity, and high rates of smoking, the iatrogenic 
effects of anti-psychotic medications have been found to increase the risk of 
metabolic syndrome. This can easily be detected through regular monitoring. 
Through this project, it was our aim to improve the physical health monitoring 
of City & Hackney Assertive Outreach Service (AOS) patients with a view to 
decrease mortality rate, increase life expectancy, increase the quality of life, 
and reduce harm from medication. This was done using quality improvement 
methods, including several change ideas, each of which started sequentially over 
the course of a nine month period from November 2014. Following QI methodology, 
this utilised cycles of iterative learning using PDSA methods and was supported 
by the Trust's extensive programme of quality improvement, including training 
provided by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. The project involved 
setting a specific aim which was improving the physical health monitoring of AOS 
patients to 80% by July 2015 and for our patients to have physical health checks 
(blood tests, weight, ECG, BP) as a minimum annually. From baseline measurements 
of between 50-75%, we reached our target of 80% for weight, BP and blood tests 
monitoring, with 89%, 91%, and 84% achieved respectively by July 2015. Further 
progress still needs to be made on ECGs, with 77% achieved by July 2015, 
although the monitoring of ECG nearly doubled from 39% in November 2014 to 77% 
in July 2015. This project demonstrated that effective leadership, collaborative 
team work, embedding the project in our daily practice, generating local 
solutions, and improved communication between primary and secondary care can 
increase the physical health monitoring of this complex and challenging patient 
group. The team continues to identify other areas for change that may lead to 
further improvement in the physical health monitoring of AOS patients while 
making sure that the improvement is sustained.

Palliative chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer has undergone 
substantial changes in recent years. The implementation of modern biologicals in 
the treatment has substantially improved overall survival up to 30 months. With 
the increasing number of therapeutic options, the question of optimal treatment 
sequence arises, which is addressed in current studies like FIRE 4 or 
STRATEGIC-1. Furthermore, clinical and molecular biomarkers to predict efficacy 
and tolerability are urgently needed. Today, the detection of activating RAS 
mutations is the only validated biomarker which precludes patients from 
anti-EGFR treatment. The detection of BRAF mutation V600E is associated with a 
very poor prognosis corresponding to a survival of 9-12 months. Prospective 
trials evaluating an optimal approach to this subgroup are still missing. First 
results from strategies targeting the aberrant signal transduction are promising 
and require further validation. Despite the advances so far, life expectancy 
unfortunately continues to be limited in the majority of patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer. New strategies are needed to improve the 
prognosis. To this end, the identification of Her2/neu as a potential target and 
first experiences with checkpoint inhibition in patients with mismatch 
repair-deficient tumors are promising and also require further validation.

BACKGROUND: Influencing the life-style risk-factors alcohol, body mass index 
(BMI), and smoking is an European Union (EU) wide objective of public health 
policy. The population-level health effects of these risk-factors depend on 
population specific characteristics and are difficult to quantify without 
dynamic population health models.
METHODS: For eleven countries-approx. 80 % of the EU-27 population-we used 
evidence from the publicly available DYNAMO-HIA data-set. For each country the 
age- and sex-specific risk-factor prevalence and the incidence, prevalence, and 
excess mortality of nine chronic diseases are utilized; including the 
corresponding relative risks linking risk-factor exposure causally to disease 
incidence and all-cause mortality. Applying the DYNAMO-HIA tool, we dynamically 
project the country-wise potential health gains and losses using feasible, i.e. 
observed elsewhere, risk-factor prevalence rates as benchmarks. The effects of 
the "worst practice", "best practice", and the currently observed risk-factor 
prevalence on population health are quantified and expected changes in life 
expectancy, morbidity-free life years, disease cases, and cumulative mortality 
are reported.
RESULTS: Applying the best practice smoking prevalence yields the largest gains 
in life expectancy with 0.4 years for males and 0.3 year for females (approx. 
332,950 and 274,200 deaths postponed, respectively) while the worst practice 
smoking prevalence also leads to the largest losses with 0.7 years for males and 
0.9 year for females (approx. 609,400 and 710,550 lives lost, respectively). 
Comparing morbidity-free life years, the best practice smoking prevalence shows 
the highest gains for males with 0.4 years (342,800 less disease cases), whereas 
for females the best practice BMI prevalence yields the largest gains with 
0.7 years (1,075,200 less disease cases).
CONCLUSION: Smoking is still the risk-factor with the largest potential health 
gains. BMI, however, has comparatively large effects on morbidity. Future 
research should aim to improve knowledge of how policies can influence and shape 
individual and aggregated life-style-related risk-factor behavior.

BACKGROUND: Ledipasvir (LDV)/sofosbuvir (SOF) has demonstrated high efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients. There is 
limited data, however, regarding the optimal timing of therapy in the context of 
possible liver transplantation (LT).
METHODS: We compared the cost-effectiveness of 12 weeks of HCV therapy before or 
after LT or nontreatment using a decision analytical microsimulation 
state-transition model for a simulated cohort of 10 000 patients with HCV 
Genotype 1 or 4 with Child B or C cirrhosis. All model parameters regarding the 
efficacy of therapy, adverse events and the effect of therapy on changes in 
model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores were derived from the SOLAR-1 
and 2 trials. The simulations were repeated with 10 000 samples from the 
parameter distributions. The primary outcome was cost (2014 US dollars) per 
quality adjusted life year.
RESULTS: Treatment before LT yielded more quality-adjusted life year for less 
money than treatment after LT or nontreatment. Treatment before LT was 
cost-effective in 100% of samples at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US $100 
000 in the base-case and when the analysis was restricted to Child B alone, 
Child C, or MELD > 15. Treatment before transplant was not cost-effective when 
MELD was 6-10. In sensitivity analyses, the MELD after which treatment before 
transplant was cost-effective was 13 and the maximum cost of LDV/SOF therapy at 
which treatment before LT is cost-effective is US $177 381.
CONCLUSIONS: From a societal perspective, HCV therapy using LDV/SOF with 
ribavirin before LT is the most cost-effective strategy for patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis and MELD score greater than 13.

BACKGROUND: For around a third of people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the 
condition proves to respond poorly to treatment with many typical and atypical 
antipsychotics. This is commonly referred to as treatment-resistant 
schizophrenia. Clozapine is the only antipsychotic with convincing efficacy for 
people whose symptoms are considered treatment-resistant to antipsychotic 
medication. However, 30-40 % of such conditions will have an insufficient 
response to the drug. Cognitive behavioural therapy has been shown to be an 
effective treatment for schizophrenia when delivered in combination with 
antipsychotic medication, with several meta-analyses showing robust support for 
this approach. However, the evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive 
behavioural therapy for people with a schizophrenia diagnosis whose symptoms are 
treatment-resistant to antipsychotic medication is limited. There is a clinical 
and economic need to evaluate treatments to improve outcomes for people with 
such conditions.
METHODS/DESIGN: A parallel group, prospective randomised, open, blinded 
evaluation of outcomes design will be used to compare a standardised cognitive 
behavioural therapy intervention added to treatment as usual versus treatment as 
usual alone (the comparator group) for individuals with a diagnosis of 
schizophrenia for whom an adequate trial of clozapine has either not been 
possible due to tolerability problems or was not associated with a sufficient 
therapeutic response. The trial will be conducted across five sites in the 
United Kingdom.
DISCUSSION: The recruitment target of 485 was achieved, with a final recruitment 
total of 487. This trial is the largest definitive, pragmatic clinical and 
cost-effectiveness trial of cognitive behavioural therapy for people with 
schizophrenia whose symptoms have failed to show an adequate response to 
clozapine treatment. Using a prognostic risk model, baseline information will be 
used to explore whether there are identifiable subgroups for which the treatment 
effect is greatest.

Currently, there is no clear position regarding the donation of organs from 
donors with prostate carcinoma (CaP) in European countries, except Italy. The 
lengthening of life expectancy increases the probability of prostate cancer 
among potential organ donors. The concentration of prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) >2 ng/mL at 60 years of age is related to the increasing possibility of 
identifying an advanced form of CaP. In recent years in Poland, the 
recommendation has been to determine tumor markers in potential donors. In the 
first year of the recommendation, 10% of potential male cadaveric donors were 
disqualified in West Pomerania, Poland, on the basis of elevated PSA levels 
(>10 ng/mL). To avoid reduction of the actual donor pool, each potential male 
donor reported to the center since January 2010 undergoes a routine histologic 
evaluation of the whole prostate, regardless of the PSA level, before organ 
implantation. In the study group (N = 52), histopathologic evaluation revealed 6 
cases of CaP (12%). In CaP positive group Gleason score range from 2+2 to 3+4. 
In CaP donors PSA level have been noticed in range 1.79 ng/mL - 7.66 ng/mL. 
There was no correlation between histologically confirmed CaP and the PSA level.

STUDY DESIGN: Case series.
OBJECTIVE: To clarify the following questions How long after cervical 
laminoplasty did the patients die? What were the causes of the death? Was the 
severity of the neurological dysfunction related to early death?
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Life expectancy in patients with cervical myelopathy 
is unclear. Cervical laminoplasty was performed in 216 patients between 1981 and 
1994. It was possible to follow 148 patients for more than 20 years. We used the 
data of the 68 survivors and the 80 patients had already died.
METHODS: As for the patients who died by the final follow-up, the survival rate 
was analyzed by a Kaplan-Meier plot; the results were compared between the 
patients with cervical spondylosis (CS) and the patients with ossification of 
the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). The causes of the death were 
assessed. The neurological evaluation was graded using the score devised by the 
Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA). The pre- and postoperative scores were 
compared between the patients in the died group (D group) and the surviving 
patients group (S group).
RESULTS: The mean period from surgery to death was 13.4 ± 7.4 years. There was 
no difference in the survival rate between patients with CS and patients with 
OPLL. The most frequent cause of death was malignant tumor followed by ischemic 
heart disease. Preoperative JOA score in the D group was lower than that in the 
S group. There was no statistical difference in postoperative JOA score between 
the two groups.
CONCLUSION: The patients who underwent cervical laminoplasty caused by 
compression myelopathy due to CS and OPLL had a long life expectancy, averaging 
more than 13 years. Life expectancy did not differ between patients with CS and 
patients with OPLL. Neurological deficit did not directly affect the life 
expectancy.

In economic evaluations of health care interventions, benefits are often 
expressed in terms of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs). The QALY comprises 
length and quality of life into one measure which allows cross-disease 
comparability. The quality adjustment of the QALY is based on preferences for 
health states. An important normative choice is the question whose preferences 
for states of health we wish to capture. The answer to this question is directly 
related to the normative question regarding the appropriate maximand in health 
care decisions. Currently, preferences are commonly derived from the general 
public, rather than from actual patients. This choice, which can have large 
consequences on final outcomes of economic evaluations, has always been a topic 
of debate. This paper clarifies and furthers the discussion regarding the 
appropriate source of preferences for health state valuations, acknowledges the 
plurality of different perspectives, and argues that health economic guidelines 
could require analysis of benefit in terms of QALYs based on both patient and 
general public preferences.

Pectin synthesis and modification are vital for plant development, although the 
underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. Here, we report the 
functional characterization of the OsTSD2 gene, which encodes a putative 
methyltransferase in rice. All three independent T-DNA insertion lines of OsTSD2 
displayed dwarf phenotypes and serial alterations in different zones of the 
root. These alterations included abnormal cellular adhesion and schizogenous 
aerenchyma formation in the meristematic zone, inhibited root elongation in the 
elongation zone, and higher lateral root density in the mature zone. 
Immunofluorescence (with LM19) and Ruthenium Red staining of the roots showed 
that unesterified homogalacturonan (HG) was increased in Ostsd2 mutants. 
Biochemical analysis of cell wall pectin polysaccharides revealed that both the 
monosaccharide composition and the uronic acid content were decreased in Ostsd2 
mutants. Increased endogenous ABA content and opposite roles performed by ABA 
and IAA in regulating cellular adhesion in the Ostsd2 mutants suggested that 
OsTSD2 is required for root development in rice through a pathway involving 
pectin synthesis/modification. A hypothesis to explain the relationship among 
OsTSD2, pectin methylesterification, and root development is proposed, based on 
pectin's function in regional cell extension/division in a zone-dependent 
manner.

PURPOSE: Until recently, surgery was the only remaining choice for moderate to 
severe chronic ulcerative colitis patients who failed standard treatment or when 
it was not tolerated. Anti-TNFα treatment is a new, non-invasive option for the 
management of ulcerative colitis. The objective of this study was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of induction and maintenance treatment up to 1 year of 
ulcerative colitis with adalimumab/standard care and standard care alone in 
Poland.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the expected costs and effects of 
adalimumab/standard care and a standard care alone. For each treatment option, 
the costs and quality adjusted life years were calculated to estimate the 
incremental cost-utility ratio. The analysis was performed from the perspective 
of the Polish public payer and society over a 30-year time horizon. Different 
direct and indirect costs and utility values were assigned to the various model 
health states.
RESULTS: The treatment of ulcerative colitis patients with adalimumab/standard 
care up to 1 year instead of a standard care alone resulted in 0.14 additional 
years of life with full health (QALYs). The incremental cost-utility ratio of 
adalimumab/standard care compared to the standard care alone is estimated to be 
76,120 €/QALY gained from NHF perspective and 71,457 €/QALY gained from social 
perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: The biologic treatment of ulcerative colitis patients with 
adalimumab/standard care is more effective but also more costly compared with 
standard care alone.

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the development in patient-reported quality of life 
(QOL) and muscle strength in the period from surgery to 12 months 
postoperatively after intramedullary nailing of a tibial shaft fracture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The design was a prospective, follow-up cohort study. QOL 
was measured with the questionnaire Eq5D-5L and compared to norm data from a 
reference population. Recordings of pain and contralateral muscle strength 
(isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) for knee flexion and extension 
were collected at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Ipsilateral MVCs 
were recorded at 6 and 12 months.
RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included. The mean age at the time of fracture 
was 43.1 years (18-79 years). Twelve months postoperatively, the mean Eq5D-5L 
index was 0.792 (95 % CI 0.747-0.837). Throughout the 12 months postoperatively, 
patients reported worse QOL compared to the reference population. Six and 
12 months after surgery patients demonstrated decreased muscle strength in the 
injured leg compared to the non-injured leg for knee extension and flexion 
(P < 0.001). Twelve months postoperatively, increasing relative difference in 
muscle strength during knee extension show a fair correlation to worse QOL 
(R = 0.541, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Throughout the 12 months postoperatively, patients reported worse 
QOL compared to the reference population. Muscle strength in the non-injured leg 
improved over time and was higher after 6 and 12 months compared with the 
injured leg.

An intracellular cascade amplification strategy for ultrasensitive "off-on" 
imaging of telomerase activity in living cells was designed. The method was 
based on fabrication of a dual function module-encapsulated liposome nanoprobe, 
which consisted of a telomerase-targeting responder-transmitter DNA complex 
(HPT) module and a catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) signal amplification module. 
Upon transfected into living cells, the released HPT could be specifically 
recognized and extended by telomerase, leading to the release of the transmitter 
DNA. The transmitter could act as the initiator and catalyzer of CHA 
amplification, resulting in the lightening up of the reporter complex. The 
telomerase activity could be monitored in situ by the fluorescence signal 
without the need for obtaining cell extracts. Because of the recycling use of 
the transmitter, multiplied enhancement of signal outputs from one extension 
event was achieved. The proposed strategy could be employed for in situ 
monitoring of the change of intracellular telomerase activity in response to 
drugs to detect drug efficacy. Thus the method has great potential in the study 
of the molecular mechanisms of telomerase-related life processes.

OBJECTIVE: Bladder perforation is not commonly described in bladder exstrophy 
patients without bladder augmentation. The goal of this study was to identify 
the risk factors of spontaneous perforation in non-augmented exstrophy bladders.
METHODS: The study was a retrospective multi-institutional review of bladder 
perforation in seven male and two female patients with classic bladder 
exstrophy-epispadias (E-E).
RESULTS: Correction of E-E was performed using Kelly repair in two and staged 
repair in seven (Table). Bladder neck repair was performed in eight patients at 
a mean age of 6 years. Three patients had additional urethral surgery. Before 
rupture, six patients were voiding only per urethra. Two patients were voiding 
urethrally but were also performing occasional CIC via a Mitrofanoff. One 
patient was performing CIC 3 hourly per urethra. Six were dry during the day. 
Six of the patients had lower urinary tract symptoms: five had frequency and 
four were straining to void. Two had suffered episodes of urinary retention. 
Pre-rupture ultrasound showed that the upper urinary tract was dilated in four 
patients. Micturating cystourethrogram was performed in six showing 
vesico-ureteral reflux in five. Two had urethral stenosis. Nuclear medicine was 
done in three patients with two abnormal differential function. Urodynamics was 
performed in two patients with low capacity (100 mL) and hypocompliant (<10) 
bladders. Both had high leak point pressures: 60 cmH2O at 100 mL. The mean age 
at rupture was 11 years, with a range of 5-20 years. Patients presented with 
abdominal pain, associated with signs of intestinal obstruction in seven and 
fever in two. Eight patients underwent laparotomy and one prolonged drainage via 
SPC. Simple closure was performed in seven and bladder neck closure in one, 
because of extension of the rupture inferiorly. All patients recovered well. 
Following rupture, five underwent augmentation and Mitrofanoff. One of these 
suffered a recurrent rupture. Two other patients refused augmentation and 
Mitrofanoff and one of these has since had a subsequent rupture.
CONCLUSIONS: The limitations of this series include the small number of patients 
and its retrospective nature, without knowledge of the incidence. Bladder 
rupture is a risk even in non-augmented bladder exstrophy. It is potentially 
life-threatening and most often requires laparotomy. Rupture occurs because of 
poor bladder emptying and/or high pressure. Urodynamics may identify those at 
risk. CIC with or without augmentation should not be delayed once poor bladder 
emptying and/or high pressure are identified.

Lower limb amputation as one of the most devastating consequences of peripheral 
arterial disease and diabetes mellitus needs peculiar attention. This review 
aims at comparing Hungarian and international amputation data. Realizing the 
great variability of the global amputation incidence and trends data, the main 
determinants of this variety are assessed. These factors involve methodological 
differences in reporting, demographic, epidemiological, economic, societal and 
cultural variation of the affected populations and differences in the health 
care service. The amputation hazard can be considered as an example of lifetime 
risk that can be characterized by complex interaction of contionuously changing 
risk factor pattern. In that sense an effective preventive strategy planning 
needs complex measure implementations that associate with multidisciplinary 
approach, timely complex preventive interventions and centralized vascular care. 
Research and development on amputation field shows clear priority that can 
contribute to the better understanding of this extremely complex scenario with 
significant public health consequences. Orv. Hetil., 2016, 157(32), 1266-1274.

Today's increased life expectancy highlights both age-related changes in body 
composition and a higher prevalence of obesity. Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is 
assuming a prominent role in cardio-metabolic risk because of the double 
metabolic burden derived from low muscle mass (sarcopenia) and excess adiposity 
(obesity). This review evaluates the related studies that have been published 
over the past 10 years in order to give an updated overview of this new 
syndrome. There is no consensus on the definition of SO due to the wide 
heterogeneity of diagnostic criteria and choice of body composition components 
needed to assess this phenotype. There is a growing body of evidence that the 
ethio-pathogenesis of SO is complex and multi-factorial, as the consequences are 
a combination of the outcomes of both sarcopenia and obesity, where the effects 
are maximised. In order to manage SO, it is important to make lifestyle changes 
that incorporate weight loss, physical exercise and protein supplementation.

INTRODUCTION: Demographic and epidemiological transitions have increased the 
life expectancy of people in India. This has resulted in higher burden of 
morbidities related to aging. The National Health programmes have focused mainly 
on the health of women in reproductive age groups and neglected their health 
thereafter. Thus, there is a need to explore the bio-social correlates of 
menopausal symptoms among women, which can influence their quality of life.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional community-based study was conducted 
in the urban slum of Mysore for 3 months. A total of 100 postmenopausal women in 
the age group of 40-65 years residing in the field practice area of Urban Health 
Training Centre were selected by simple random sampling method from the database 
of households. Details regarding socio-demographic characteristics, 
postmenopausal symptoms, and factors associated with them were collected in a 
pretested structured pro forma by interview technique.
RESULTS: Among 100 women included in the present study, mean age at menarche and 
menopause was 13.45 ± 1.72 and 46.7 ± 5.2 years, respectively. The most common 
postmenopausal symptom was joint pain (92%) followed by physical and mental 
exhaustion (84%), depression (76%), irritability (73%), hot flushes, and night 
sweats (65%). There was a significant positive correlation between age of the 
women, duration of life after menopause, and postmenopausal symptoms.
CONCLUSION: There is a high burden of postmenopausal symptoms which have shown 
an increasing trend with advancement of age. This calls for establishment of 
specific health interventions for postmenopausal women in the health-care 
settings.
