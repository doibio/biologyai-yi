RESULTS: Our search resulted in 30 manuscripts. Thirteen unique PRO measures 
were used to assess 18 distinct PRO domains. Pain, fatigue, and emotional 
function were commonly assessed domains though reporting formats limited our 
ability to understand prevalence and severity of PRO challenges in RRMM. 
Evaluation of PRO reporting quality revealed significant reporting deficiencies. 
Several reporting criteria were included in less than 25% of manuscripts.
CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence provides a limited window for understanding the 
patient experience of RRMM and is further limited by suboptimal reporting 
quality. Observational studies are needed to describe prevalence, severity and 
patterns of PROs in RRMM overtime. Future studies that incorporate PROs would 
benefit from following existing guidelines to ensure that study evidence and 
conclusions can be fully assessed by readers, clinicians and policy makers.

BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence on the clinical and cost benefits of 
screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) with electrocardiogram (ECG) in 
asymptomatic adults.
METHODS: We adapted a previously published Markov model to evaluate the clinical 
and economic impact of one-time screening for non-valvular AF (NVAF) with a 
single 12-lead ECG and a 14-day extended screening with a hand-held ECG device 
(Zenicor single-lead ECG, Z14) compared with no screening. Clinical events 
considered included ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeds, myocardial 
infarction, and death. Epidemiology and effectiveness data for extended 
screening were from the STROKESTOP study. Risks of clinical events in NVAF 
patients were derived from ARISTOTLE. Analyses were conducted from the 
perspective of a third-party payer, considering a population with undiagnosed 
NVAF, aged 75 years in the USA. Costs and utilities were discounted at a 3% 
annual rate. Parameter uncertainty was formally considered via deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA and PSA). Structural uncertainty was 
assessed via scenario analyses.
RESULTS: In a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients followed over their 
lifetimes, the number of additional AF diagnoses was 54 with 12-lead ECG and 255 
with Z14 compared with no screening. Both screening strategies led to better 
health outcomes (ischemic strokes avoided: ECG 12-lead, 9.8 and Z14, 42.2; 
quality-adjusted life-years gained: ECG 12-lead, 31 and Z14, 131). Extended 
screening and one-time screening were cost effective compared with no screening 
at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained 
($58,728/QALY with ECG 12-lead and $47,949/QALY with Z14 in 2016 US dollars). 
ICERs remained below $100,000 per QALY in all DSA, most PSA runs, and in all 
scenario analyses except for a scenario assuming low anticoagulation 
persistence.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that, screening the general population at age 
75 years for NVAF is cost effective at a WTP threshold of $100,000. Both 
extended screening and one-time screening for NVAF are expected to provide 
health benefits at an acceptable cost.

A Bayesian extension of phylogenetic generalized least squares: Incorporating 
uncertainty in the comparative study of trait relationships and evolutionary 
rates.

Phylogenetic comparative methods use tree topology, branch lengths, and models 
of phenotypic change to take into account nonindependence in statistical 
analysis. However, these methods normally assume that trees and models are known 
without error. Approaches relying on evolutionary regimes also assume specific 
distributions of character states across a tree, which often result from 
ancestral state reconstructions that are subject to uncertainty. Several methods 
have been proposed to deal with some of these sources of uncertainty, but 
approaches accounting for all of them are less common. Here, we show how 
Bayesian statistics facilitates this task while relaxing the homogeneous rate 
assumption of the well-known phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) 
framework. This Bayesian formulation allows uncertainty about phylogeny, 
evolutionary regimes, or other statistical parameters to be taken into account 
for studies as simple as testing for coevolution in two traits or as complex as 
testing whether bursts of phenotypic change are associated with evolutionary 
shifts in intertrait correlations. A mixture of validation approaches indicates 
that the approach has good inferential properties and predictive performance. We 
provide suggestions for implementation and show its usefulness by exploring the 
coevolution of ankle posture and forefoot proportions in Carnivora.

AIMS: To perform an economic evaluation of a work-place smoking cessation group 
training programme with incentives compared with a training programme without 
incentives.
DESIGN: A trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility 
analysis (CUA) from a societal perspective and an employer's perspective.
SETTING: Sixty-one companies in the Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 604 tobacco-smoking employees.
INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: A 7-week work-place smoking cessation group 
training programme. The intervention group earned gift vouchers of €350 for 
12 months' continuous abstinence. The comparator group received no incentives.
MEASUREMENTS: Online questionnaires were administered to assess quality of life 
(EQ-5D-5 L) and resource use during the 14-month follow-up period (2-month 
training period plus 12-month abstinence period). For the CEA the primary 
outcome measure was carbon monoxide (CO)-validated continuous abstinence; for 
the CUA the primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALY). 
Bootstrapping and sensitivity analyses were performed to account for 
uncertainty. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) tables were used to 
determine cost-effectiveness from a life-time perspective.
FINDINGS: Of the participants in the intervention group, 41.1% had quit smoking 
compared with 26.4% in the control group. From a societal perspective with a 
14-month follow-up period, the ICER per quitter for an intervention with 
financial incentives compared with no incentives was €11 546. From an employer's 
perspective, the ICER was €5686. There was no significant difference in QALYs 
between the intervention and control group within the 14-month follow-up period. 
The intervention was dominated by the comparator in the primary analysis at a 
threshold of €20 000 per QALY. In the sensitivity analysis, these results were 
uncertain. A life-time perspective showed an ICER of €1249 (95% confidence 
interval = €850-2387) per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Financial incentives may be cost-effective in increasing quitting 
smoking, particularly from a life-time perspective.

Medical Sciences, Poland.

The average life expectancy has increased and despite a distinct feminization of 
aging, the number of older males continues to grow. Physical activity has a 
positive effect on health and helps to slow down the negative consequences of 
aging. The aim of the study was to evaluate possible relationships between 
physical fitness, physical activity and type of work during occupational 
activity among retired men (aged ≥65 years), no longer professionally active. 
The study included 104 men (aged from 65 to 90 years), further stratified into 
blue- and white-collar groups (66 and 38 subjects, respectively). The 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to assess their 
physical activity levels. Physical performance was assessed using the Short 
Physical Performance Battery test (SPPB) and handgrip strength (HGS) 
measurement. Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used to identify the risk for 
depression. Mean physical activity in the study population was moderate in 
almost 70%, high in 19% and low in 11% of the subjects. Men with high physical 
activity levels had better SPPB and GDS scores (p = .01 and p = .001, 
respectively). In the blue-collar group, the IPAQ scores were lower than in the 
white-collar group, although the differences were statistically insignificant. 
The SPPB scores and mean HGS for the dominant hand were similar in both groups. 
Occupational physical activity should not substitute other forms of physical 
activity. Regardless of the type of work performed before retirement, the men 
obtained similar results in terms of their physical activity.

Increase in life expectancy during the second part of the 20th century is 
accompanied by increase in proportion of elderly and senile age population. 
However, despite the increase in life expectancy, the prevalence of most chronic 
diseases and functional impairments rises with age. Elderly and senile age is 
associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), therefore the problem 
of managing elderly patients with CVD becomes especially urgent.

BACKGROUND: Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are an important public health problem 
around the world, with the majority of RTIs occurring in low- and middle-income 
countries. This study aimed to determine disability-adjusted life years (DALY) 
of RTIs in the northeast of Iran.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used the death registration system to 
calculate years of life lost (YLL) due to RTIs. To determine the years lost due 
to disability (YLD), hospital records of all people injured in road accidents 
were used. To estimate DALY, we used YLD and YLL to calculate DALY according to 
the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2003 guideline and the age/sex composition of 
the population was taken from the Statistical Centre of Iran (SCI) in 2016. All 
collected data entered into Excel software and performed calculations.
RESULTS: Our findings showed that a total of 3403 RTIs and 132 deaths were 
recorded in 2016. The DALY was 38 per 1,000 of which 26.9 per 1,000 were related 
to YLL and 11.1 per 1,000 were related to YLD. The highest YLL rate in both 
sexes was in the 15-29 and 30-44 age groups with 49.8 per 1,000 and 46.0 per 
1,000, respectively. This reflects a sex ratio of DALY in males (57.7 per 1,000) 
to females (8.6 per 1,000) was 6.7.
CONCLUSIONS: It seems to be necessary, appropriate effective intervention 
programs and periodic evaluations are required regarding prevention and reducing 
traffic accidents mostly in middle-aged men.

BACKGROUND: Benralizumab is an interleukin-5 receptor alpha-directed cytolytic 
monoclonal antibody. Treatment with benralizumab significantly reduces 
exacerbations and improves lung function after 1 year for patients with severe, 
uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma.
OBJECTIVE: We explored whether benralizumab efficacy was sustained after an 
additional year of treatment while maintaining an acceptable safety profile.
METHODS: Data from the pivotal 48-week SIROCCO and 56-week CALIMA studies were 
integrated with data from the predefined 56-week adult phase of the BORA 
extension study to provide a 2-year integrated efficacy and safety analysis of 
benralizumab. BORA enrolled patients who had completed SIROCCO or CALIMA. 
Patients receiving benralizumab 30 mg subcutaneously, either every 4 weeks (Q4W) 
or every 8 weeks (Q8W; first three doses Q4W), were assessed. Efficacy was 
evaluated based on baseline blood eosinophil counts from the pivotal studies 
(≥300 and <300 cells/μL).
RESULTS: Mean treatment exposures were 24.3 (Q4W, n=518) and 24.6 (Q8W, n=512) 
months. Exacerbation frequency reductions observed in SIROCCO/CALIMA were 
maintained; 50% of the patients had no exacerbations during the 2-year study 
period (crude exacerbation rate, Q8W: 0.56 exacerbations/year for patients with 
blood eosinophil counts ≥300 cells/μL). Lung function improvements with 
benralizumab were maintained for 2 years, as represented by increases in mean 
prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second from baseline of 0.343 L 
and 0.364 L with 1 and 2 years of benralizumab Q8W treatment, respectively, for 
patients with blood eosinophil counts ≥300 cells/μL. Health-related quality of 
life improvements with benralizumab observed in the pivotal studies were also 
sustained. Adverse events and serious adverse event rates were similar between 
the BORA extension and SIROCCO/CALIMA periods, with no new or unexpected 
occurrence of adverse events.
CONCLUSION: This benralizumab 2-year integrated analysis further supports 
long-term use of benralizumab for patients with severe, uncontrolled 
eosinophilic asthma.

Menopause is one of the most important reproductive health issues of women. 
Because of rising life expectancy, by the year 2030, the global population of 
menopausal women is expected to include 1.2 billion people. The purpose of the 
present study is to provide a comprehensive assessment of existing studies on 
the relationship between social determinants of health and menopause to attract 
the attention of researchers and health providers to this critical issue. In 
present integrative review, articles for menopause published from Jan 1990 to 
Jan 2019 in databases including MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Google 
Scholar, IranDoc, IranMedex, MagIran and SID in English and Persian languages 
were extracted. After the assessment of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 40 
articles were selected and reviewed. Some social determinants of health are 
related to the health of women in menopause. Cultural factors, lifestyles 
(nutrition, exercise, tobacco use, etc.), family support, educational level, 
employment, economic status, marital status, and the number of pregnancies and 
childbirth are among the social determinants of health that present research 
assessed them. The need for education, improving emotional and social support, 
planning for lifestyle enhancement, and improving socio-economic status is felt, 
which results in promoting women's health during menopause.

BACKGROUND: The signing of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) consent is mandatory in 
providing a palliative approach in the end-of-life care for the terminally ill 
patients and requires an effective communication between the physician and the 
patients or their family members. This study aimed to investigate the 
association between the communication skills of physicians who participated in 
the SHARE (supportive environment, how to deliver the bad news, additional 
information, reassurance, and emotional support) model course on the patient 
notification and the signing of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) consent by the 
terminally ill patients at emergency rooms.
METHODS: Between May 1, 2017 and April 30, 2018, a total of 109 terminally ill 
patients were enrolled in this study, of which 70 had signed a DNR and 39 had 
not. Data regarding the patients' medical records, a questionnaire survey 
completed by family members, and patient observation forms were used for the 
assessment of physicians' communication skills during patient notification. The 
observation form was designed based on the SHARE model. A multivariate logistic 
regression model was applied to identify the independent significant factors of 
the patient and family member variables as well as the four main components of 
the observation form.
RESULTS: The results revealed that knowing how to convey bad news and providing 
reassurance and emotional support were significantly correlated with a higher 
rate of signing DNR consent. Additionally, physician-initiated discussion with 
family members and a predicted limited life expectancy were negative independent 
significant factors for signing DNR consent.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that good communication skills help to increase 
the signing of DNR consent. The learning of such skills from attendance of the 
SHARE model course is encouraged for the physicians in the palliative care of 
terminally ill patients in an emergency room.

Decoding the relationship between ageing and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a 
cellular perspective.

With an ageing population comes an inevitable increase in the prevalence of 
age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS), a relentlessly progressive and universally fatal disease characterized by 
the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons within the brain and spinal 
cord. Indeed, the physiological process of ageing causes a variety of molecular 
and cellular phenotypes. With dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction 
implicated as a key pathological mechanism in ALS, and each lower motor unit 
cell type vulnerable to its own set of age-related phenotypes, the effects of 
ageing might in fact prove a prerequisite to ALS, rendering the cells 
susceptible to disease-specific mechanisms. Moreover, we discuss evidence for 
overlap between age and ALS-associated hallmarks, potentially implicating cell 
type-specific ageing as a key contributor to this multifactorial and complex 
disease. With a dearth of disease-modifying therapy currently available for ALS 
patients and a substantial failure in bench to bedside translation of other 
potential therapies, the unification of research in ageing and ALS requires high 
fidelity models to better recapitulate age-related human disease and will 
ultimately yield more reliable candidate therapeutics for patients, with the aim 
of enhancing healthspan and life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has called upon 
the federal government to provide data on a number of health indicators, 
including life expectancy among First Nations people, Métis and Inuit. In 
Canada, estimating the life expectancy of Indigenous populations is 
methodologically challenging since death registrations do not usually collect 
information on whether the deceased was Indigenous. For the first time in 
Canada, a series of census-mortality linked datasets has been created that can 
be used to estimate life expectancies among Indigenous household populations 
enumerated by a census.
DATA AND METHODS: Life expectancy is the average number of years a person at a 
given age would be expected to live if the mortality rates observed for a 
specific period persisted into the future. For this study, abridged period life 
tables (based on five-year age groups) were calculated for self-reported First 
Nations, Métis, Inuit and non-Indigenous males and females.
RESULTS: Life expectancy was substantially and consistently shorter for First 
Nations, Métis and Inuit household populations compared with the non-Indigenous 
household population across all time periods. In 2011, life expectancy at age 1 
for the male household population was 72.5 years for First Nations, 76.9 years 
for Métis, 70.0 years for Inuit and 81.4 years for non-Indigenous people. Among 
the female household population, life expectancy at age 1 was 77.7 years for 
First Nations, 82.3 years for Métis, 76.1 years for Inuit and 87.3 for 
non-Indigenous people.
DISCUSSION: With the creation of a series of census-mortality linked datasets, 
it is now possible to produce national mortality and life expectancy estimates 
starting at age 1 for Indigenous household populations. The routine monitoring 
of longevity by population group can inform policy development and planning 
intended to advance health equity.

BACKGROUND: Thromboprophylaxis can reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism 
(VTE) during lower-limb immobilisation, but it is unclear whether or not this 
translates into meaningful health benefit, justifies the risk of bleeding or is 
cost-effective. Risk assessment models (RAMs) could select higher-risk 
individuals for thromboprophylaxis.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
different strategies for providing thromboprophylaxis to people with lower-limb 
immobilisation caused by injury and to identify priorities for future research.
DATA SOURCES: Ten electronic databases and research registers (MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Review of 
Effects, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Health Technology 
Assessment database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Science Citation Index 
Expanded, ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry 
Platform) were searched from inception to May 2017, and this was supplemented by 
hand-searching reference lists and contacting experts in the field.
REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews were undertaken to determine the 
effectiveness of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in lower-limb immobilisation 
and to identify any study of risk factors or RAMs for VTE in lower-limb 
immobilisation. Study quality was assessed using appropriate tools. A network 
meta-analysis was undertaken for each outcome in the effectiveness review and 
the results of risk-prediction studies were presented descriptively. A modified 
Delphi survey was undertaken to identify risk predictors supported by expert 
consensus. Decision-analytic modelling was used to estimate the incremental cost 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of different thromboprophylaxis 
strategies from the perspectives of the NHS and Personal Social Services.
RESULTS: Data from 6857 participants across 13 trials were included in the 
meta-analysis. Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin reduced the 
risk of any VTE [odds ratio (OR) 0.52, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.37 to 
0.71], clinically detected deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR 0.40, 95% CrI 0.12 to 
0.99) and pulmonary embolism (PE) (OR 0.17, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.88). 
Thromboprophylaxis with fondaparinux (Arixtra®, Aspen Pharma Trading Ltd, 
Dublin, Ireland) reduced the risk of any VTE (OR 0.13, 95% CrI 0.05 to 0.30) and 
clinically detected DVT (OR 0.10, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.94), but the effect on PE 
was inconclusive (OR 0.47, 95% CrI 0.01 to 9.54). Estimates of the risk of major 
bleeding with thromboprophylaxis were inconclusive owing to the small numbers of 
events. Fifteen studies of risk factors were identified, but only age (ORs 1.05 
to 3.48), and injury type were consistently associated with VTE. Six studies of 
RAMs were identified, but only two reported prognostic accuracy data for VTE, 
based on small numbers of patients. Expert consensus was achieved for 13 risk 
predictors in lower-limb immobilisation due to injury. Modelling showed that 
thromboprophylaxis for all is effective (0.015 QALY gain, 95% CrI 0.004 to 0.029 
QALYs) with a cost-effectiveness of £13,524 per QALY, compared with 
thromboprophylaxis for none. If risk-based strategies are included, it is 
potentially more cost-effective to limit thromboprophylaxis to patients with a 
Leiden thrombosis risk in plaster (cast) [L-TRiP(cast)] score of ≥ 9 (£20,000 
per QALY threshold) or ≥ 8 (£30,000 per QALY threshold). An optimal threshold on 
the L-TRiP(cast) receiver operating characteristic curve would have sensitivity 
of 84-89% and specificity of 46-55%.
LIMITATIONS: Estimates of RAM prognostic accuracy are based on weak evidence. 
People at risk of bleeding were excluded from trials and, by implication, from 
modelling.
CONCLUSIONS: Thromboprophylaxis for lower-limb immobilisation due to injury is 
clinically effective and cost-effective compared with no thromboprophylaxis. 
Risk-based thromboprophylaxis is potentially optimal but the prognostic accuracy 
of existing RAMs is uncertain.
FUTURE WORK: Research is required to determine whether or not an appropriate RAM 
can accurately select higher-risk patients for thromboprophylaxis.

Plain Language Summary: People who have their leg immobilised in a plaster cast 
or brace following an injury are at risk of developing a blood clot. Sometimes 
the clot can break up and lodge in the lungs, which can make the person 
seriously ill. Drugs that thin the blood (anticoagulants) can reduce the risk of 
blood clots, but they carry a small risk of serious bleeding. This study 
analysed all published trials of anticoagulants for people with leg 
immobilisation and found that, without treatment, there was a 1–2% risk of a 
serious blood clot. This risk was roughly halved by using anticoagulant 
treatment. These estimates were used in a simulation model of patient treatment 
and it was found that the benefit of anticoagulants in reducing blood clots (in 
terms of length and quality of life) outweighed the risks of bleeding. Next, all 
published studies of risk assessment tools were analysed. Risk assessment tools 
can be used to predict who is most likely to get a blood clot. There were only a 
few studies and they had significant weaknesses. The risk assessment tools in 
the simulation model were evaluated and it was found that the most 
cost-effective approach was to use a risk assessment tool to select 
approximately half of the patients for treatment (those at higher risk), while 
not treating those at lower risk. Treating only the higher-risk patients would 
be a cost-effective use of NHS resources, compared with treating nobody. 
Treating everybody, compared with just treating higher-risk patients, would 
improve outcomes for some patients but would not be a cost-effective use of NHS 
resources. This study suggests that anticoagulant drugs are an effective and 
potentially cost-effective way of preventing blood clots in people with leg 
immobilisation due to injury. Research is needed to determine whether or not 
risk assessment tools can accurately predict who needs anticoagulant drugs and 
who does not.

Multiples of Median Income: A Tool to Call out Drugs that are High Cost and Low 
Value.

As currently priced, many medications are harming society because they are high 
cost and low value, and they divert resources from interventions that could 
promote the health and well-being of Americans to a much greater extent. We 
believe that cost-effectiveness, stated as dollars per quality-adjusted 
life-year, is not meaningful for many Americans. By contrast, a measure indexed 
to household income would be far more salient. We therefore propose reporting 
the costs of drugs and medical devices as multiples of median income of US 
households. Although this simple change will leave many questions unanswered, we 
believe that it will contribute to ongoing efforts to increase the value of 
health care by bringing drug costs into perspective.

BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy administered over 6 
months is the standard adjuvant regimen for patients with high-risk stage II or 
III colorectal cancer. However, the regimen is associated with cumulative 
toxicity, characterised by chronic and often irreversible neuropathy.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of 3-month versus 6-month adjuvant 
chemotherapy for colorectal cancer and to compare the toxicity, health-related 
quality of life and cost-effectiveness of the durations.
DESIGN: An international, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, Phase III, 
parallel-group trial.
SETTING: A total of 244 oncology clinics from six countries: UK (England, 
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Australia and New 
Zealand.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged ≥ 18 years who had undergone curative resection for 
high-risk stage II or III adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum.
INTERVENTIONS: The adjuvant treatment regimen was either oxaliplatin and 
5-fluorouracil or oxaliplatin and capecitabine, randomised to be administered 
over 3 or 6 months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was disease-free survival. Overall 
survival, adverse events, neuropathy and health-related quality of life were 
also assessed. The main cost categories were chemotherapy treatment and 
hospitalisation. Cost-effectiveness was assessed through incremental cost 
comparisons and quality-adjusted life-year gains between the options and was 
reported as net monetary benefit using a willingness-to-pay threshold of £30,000 
per quality-adjusted life-year per patient.
RESULTS: Recruitment is closed. In total, 6088 patients were randomised (3044 
per group) between 27 March 2008 and 29 November 2013, with 6065 included in the 
intention-to-treat analyses (3-month analysis, n = 3035; 6-month analysis, 
n = 3030). Follow-up for the primary analysis is complete. The 3-year 
disease-free survival rate in the 3-month treatment group was 76.7% (standard 
error 0.8%) and in the 6-month treatment group was 77.1% (standard error 0.8%), 
equating to a hazard ratio of 1.006 (95% confidence interval 0.909 to 1.114; 
p-value for non-inferiority = 0.012), confirming non-inferiority for 3-month 
adjuvant chemotherapy. Frequent adverse events (alopecia, anaemia, anorexia, 
diarrhoea, fatigue, hand-foot syndrome, mucositis, sensory neuropathy, 
neutropenia, pain, rash, altered taste, thrombocytopenia and watery eye) showed 
a significant increase in grade with 6-month duration; the greatest difference 
was for sensory neuropathy (grade ≥ 3 was 4% for 3-month vs.16% for 6-month 
duration), for which a higher rate of neuropathy was seen for the 6-month 
treatment group from month 4 to ≥ 5 years (p < 0.001). Quality-of-life scores 
were better in the 3-month treatment group over months 4-6. A cost-effectiveness 
analysis showed 3-month treatment to cost £4881 less over the 8-year analysis 
period, with an incremental net monetary benefit of £7246 per patient.
CONCLUSIONS: The study achieved its primary end point, showing that 3-month 
oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant chemotherapy is non-inferior to 6 months of the 
same regimen; 3-month treatment showed a better safety profile and cost less. 
For future work, further follow-up will refine long-term estimates of the 
duration effect on disease-free survival and overall survival. The health 
economic analysis will be updated to include long-term extrapolation for 
subgroups. We expect these analyses to be available in 2019-20. The Short Course 
Oncology Therapy (SCOT) study translational samples may allow the identification 
of patients who would benefit from longer treatment based on the molecular 
characteristics of their disease.

Plain Language Summary: Patients diagnosed with bowel cancer are likely to have 
surgery to remove the tumour. Patients diagnosed with a more advanced stage of 
the disease are then likely to be offered what is known as adjuvant chemotherapy 
– chemotherapy to kill any cancer cells that have already spread but cannot be 
seen. Adjuvant chemotherapy is usually given over 6 months using two medicines 
known as oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine. This chemotherapy has side effects of 
diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, and it reduces the numbers of cells in the 
blood. It can also damage nerves, which causes discomfort, numbness and 
tingling; in some cases, this can go on for years. These side effects are more 
likely to develop with longer treatment. This study looked at whether or not 
shortening the time over which patients were given oxaliplatin and 
fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy reduced its effectiveness. In this large study of 
over 6000 patients, half of the patients were allocated by chance to be treated 
for 3 months and the other half to be treated for 6 months. Reducing the time 
that patients had chemotherapy from 6 months to 3 months did not make the 
treatment less effective. When patients treated with chemotherapy over 3 months 
were compared with those treated over 6 months, 77% of patients in both groups 
were well with no detectable disease 3 years after surgery. Patients were less 
likely to get side effects with 3-month chemotherapy. In particular, the chance 
of persistent long-term nerve damage was lower, resulting in patients with 
3-month chemotherapy having better health-related quality of life. Overall, the 
study showed that 3-month adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with bowel cancer 
is as effective as 6-month adjuvant chemotherapy and causes fewer side effects.

Osteoporosis and fragility fractures: risk assessment, management and 
prevention.

Walker J(1).

(1)Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, England.

Osteoporosis is a chronic skeletal condition characterised by low bone mass and 
microarchitectural deterioration of the bones that disproportionately affects 
older people. Older people with osteoporosis are at increased risk of sustaining 
fragility fractures, and this risk is compounded by factors such as falls and 
frailty. Fragility fractures can have several physical and psychological 
effects, potentially affecting an older person's quality of life and reducing 
their life expectancy. Therefore, it is important that nurses can identify 
individuals at risk of osteoporosis and recognise the factors that may predict 
fragility fractures. This article outlines the main risk factors for 
osteoporosis and details the assessment and management of patients with this 
condition. It also explains the pharmacological interventions and lifestyle 
changes that can reduce the risk of fragility fractures in older people with 
osteoporosis.

Services, Trento, Italy.

In this brief report, we offer a concise overview on current cancer epidemiology 
garnered from the official databases of World Health Organization and American 
Cancer Society and provide recent information on frequency, mortality, and 
survival expectancy of the 15 leading types of cancers worldwide. Overall, 
cancer poses the highest clinical, social, and economic burden in terms of 
cause-specific Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) among all human diseases. 
The overall 0-74 years risk of developing cancer is 20.2% (22.4% in men and 
18.2% in women, respectively). A total number of 18 million new cases have been 
diagnosed in 2018, the most frequent of which are lung (2.09 million cases), 
breast (2.09 million cases), and prostate (1.28 million cases) cancers. Beside 
sex-specific malignancies, the ratio of frequency between men and women is >1 
for all cancers, except thyroid (i.e., 0.30). As concerns mortality, cancer is 
the second worldwide cause of death (8.97 million deaths) after ischemic heart 
disease, but will likely become the first in 2060 (~18.63 million deaths). Lung, 
liver, and stomach are the three most deadly cancers in the general population, 
while lung and breast cancers are the leading causes of cancer related-mortality 
in men and women, respectively. Prostate and thyroid cancers have the best 
prognosis, with 5-year survival ~100%, while esophagus, liver, and especially 
pancreas cancers have the worst prognosis, typically <20% at 5 years. We hope 
that this report will provide fertile ground for addressing health-care 
interventions aimed at preventing, diagnosing, and managing cancer around the 
world.
