ACCESSIBLE SUMMARY: People with severe mental ill health are up to three times 
more likely to smoke than other members of the general population. Life 
expectancy in this client group is reduced by up to 30 years, and smoking is the 
single most important cause of premature death. The aim of this study was to 
explore why people with severe mental ill health smoked and why they might want 
to stop smoking or cut down on the amount of cigarettes that they smoked. The 
study found that people with severe mental ill health are motivated to cut down 
or stop smoking, and this is mainly due to concerns about their own health. The 
reasons people gave for smoking were to relieve stress, to help relax and for 
something to do when they are bored. Health professionals should offer evidence 
supported smoking cessation therapy to people with severe mental ill health. In 
addition to standard National Health Service smoking cessation treatments such 
as pharmacotherapy and behavioural support. Practitioners should help people 
with serious mental ill health to identify meaningful activities to relieve 
boredom and challenge any incorrect beliefs they hold that smoking helps 
relaxation and relieves stress.
ABSTRACT: Smoking is the single most preventable cause of premature mortality 
for people with serious mental ill health (SMI). Yet little is known about the 
reasons why service users smoke or what their motivations for quitting might be. 
The aim of this paper is to explore smoking behaviours, reasons for smoking and 
motivations for cutting down/stopping smoking in individuals with SMI who 
expressed an interest in cutting down or stopping smoking. Prior to 
randomization, the smoking behaviours and motivations for wanting to cut down or 
stop smoking of participants in a randomized trial were systematically assessed. 
Participant's primary reasons for continuing to smoke were that they believed it 
helped them to cope with stress, to relax and relieve boredom. Participant's 
main motivations for wanting to cut down or stop smoking were related to 
concerns for their own health. Previous attempts to stop smoking had often been 
made alone without access to evidence supported smoking cessation therapy. 
Future recommendations include helping people with SMI to increase their 
activity levels to relieve boredom and inspire confidence in their ability to 
stop smoking and challenging beliefs that smoking aids relaxation and relieves 
stress.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies in multiple sclerosis (MS) showed longer survival 
times from clinical onset than older hospital-based series. However estimated 
median time ranges widely, from 24 to 45 years, which makes huge difference for 
patients as this neurological disease mainly starts around age 20 to 40. Precise 
and up-to-date reference data about mortality in MS are crucial for patients and 
neurologists, but unavailable yet in France.
OBJECTIVES: Estimate survival in MS patients and compare mortality with that of 
the French general population.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter observational study involving clinical 
longitudinal data from 30,413 eligible patients, linked to the national deaths 
register. Inclusion criteria were definite MS diagnosis and clinical onset prior 
to January, 1st 2009 in order to get a minimum of 1-year disease duration.
RESULTS: After removing between-center duplicates and applying inclusion 
criteria, the final population comprised 27,603 MS patients (F/M sex ratio 2.5, 
mean age at onset 33.0 years, 85.5% relapsing onset). During the follow-up 
period (mean 15.2 +/- 10.3 years), 1569 deaths (5.7%) were identified; half 
related to MS. Death rates were significantly higher in men, patients with later 
clinical onset, and in progressive MS. Overall excess mortality compared with 
the general population was moderate (Standardized Mortality Ratio 1.48, 95% 
confidence interval [1.41-1.55]), but increased considerably after 20 years of 
disease (2.20 [2.10-2.31]).
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a moderate decrease in life expectancy in MS 
patients, and showed that the risk of dying is strongly correlated to disease 
duration and disability, highlighting the need for early actions that can slow 
disability progression.

BACKGROUND: Data on cost-effectiveness and efficacy of hepatic resection (HR) 
for advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) are lacking. We sought to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of upfront HR resulting in an R1 resection 
(strategy A) relative to initial systemic chemotherapy (sCT) followed by 
possible curative HR (strategy B) for patients with advanced ICC.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed using data from a systematic literature 
review. Three base cases were considered: (1) ICC >6 cm (2) ICC with vascular 
invasion (3) multi-focal ICC. A Monte Carlo simulation assessed outcomes 
including quality-adjusted life months (QALMs) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: The net health benefit (NHB) of strategy A versus strategy B was 1.4 
QALMs for ICC >6 cm and 1.3 QALMs for ICC and vascular invasion; in contrast, 
there was a negative NHB for HR versus sCT for multi-focal ICC (-0.3 QALMs). In 
single nodule ICC >6 cm, the ICER of HR versus sCT was $22,482/quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY) and the ICER of HR versus sCT was $20,953/QALY for ICC with 
vascular invasion. In multi-focal ICC, the ICER of HR compared with sCT was 
$83,604/QALY. Patients with a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score 
(coefficient 0.94), male sex (coefficient 0.43), low quality of life after sCT 
(coefficient -2.57) and T3 tumors (coefficient 0.53) had a better NHB for HR 
relative to sCT followed by potential surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with large ICC or ICC and vascular invasion, HR was 
more cost-effective than sCT. In contrast, HR was not associated with a positive 
NHB relative to sCT for patients with multi-focal ICC, and therefore these 
patients should be treated with sCT rather than HR.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the natural history of common heart disease incidence on 
a population study.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample of 1712 men aged 40-59 was enrolled in 1960 and 
followed-up for 50years. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was categorized if 
manifested as sudden death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and other 
acute coronary syndromes, and as Heart Disease of Uncertain Etiology (HDUE) if 
manifested as heart failure, chronic arrhythmia, blocks, diagnoses of chronic 
CHD or hypertensive heart disease. Their characteristics and prognosis in terms 
of age at event, mortality and expectancy of life up to 50years were analyzed.
RESULTS: Incidence of first CHD and HDUE event or diagnosis was of 26.9 and 
20.6%, respectively. First events were equally manifested as fatal or non-fatal 
occurrences among CHD, while non-fatal occurrences were almost always observed 
among HDUE. Cases of HDUE presented at a more advanced age and also average age 
at death was significantly more advanced than in CHD, respectively around 79 and 
76years. Expectancy of life was significantly longer for HDUE (30.7years) than 
for CHD (27.6years). Strokes were more frequently ascertained among HDUE (14%) 
while 14% of death causes were due to cancer in both CHD and HDUE. Cancers were 
much higher (40%) among those never diagnosed CHD or HDUE who also had more 
stroke-due deaths (17%).
CONCLUSION: This is the first investigation to report heart disease incidence 
and its natural history in a quasi-extinction cohort data from Italy in a 
pre-cardiac surgery era.

BACKGROUND: The majority of mental health problems are non-psychotic (e.g., 
depression, anxiety, and phobias). For some people, art therapy may be a more 
acceptable alternative form of psychological therapy than standard forms of 
treatment, such as talking therapies. This study was part of a health technology 
assessment commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research, UK and 
aimed to systematically appraise the clinical and cost-effective evidence for 
art therapy for people with non-psychotic mental health disorders.
METHODS: Comprehensive literature searches for studies examining art therapy in 
populations with non-psychotic mental health disorders were performed in May 
2013. A quantitative systematic review of clinical effectiveness and a 
systematic review of studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of group art 
therapy were conducted.
RESULTS: Eleven randomised controlled trials were included (533 patients). 
Meta-analysis was not possible due to clinical heterogeneity and insufficient 
comparable data on outcome measures across studies. The control groups varied 
between studies but included: no treatment/wait-list, attention placebo controls 
and psychological therapy comparators. Art therapy was associated with 
significant positive changes relative to the control group in mental health 
symptoms in 7 of the 11 studies. A de novo model was constructed and populated 
with data identified from the clinical review. Scenario analyses were conducted 
allowing comparisons of group art therapy with wait-list control and group art 
therapy with group verbal therapy. Group art-therapy appeared cost-effective 
compared with wait-list control with high certainty although generalisability to 
the target population was unclear; group verbal therapy appeared more 
cost-effective than art therapy but there was considerable uncertainty and a 
sizeable probability that art therapy was more cost effective.
CONCLUSIONS: From the limited available evidence art therapy was associated with 
positive effects compared with control in a number of studies in patients with 
different clinical profiles. The included trials were generally of poor quality 
and are therefore likely to be at high risk of bias. Art therapy appeared to be 
cost-effective versus wait-list but further studies are needed to confirm this 
finding in the target population. There was insufficient evidence to make an 
informed comparison of the cost-effectiveness of group art therapy with group 
verbal therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost utility of a center-based outpatient cardiac 
rehabilitation program compared with no program within patient subgroups on the 
basis of age, sex, and clinical presentation (acute coronary syndrome [ACS] or 
non-ACS).
METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis from a health system payer 
perspective to compare cardiac rehabilitation with no cardiac rehabilitation for 
patients who had a cardiac catheterization. The Markov model was stratified by 
clinical presentation, age, and sex. Clinical, quality-of-life, and cost data 
were provided by the Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in 
Coronary Heart Disease and TotalCardiology.
RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for 
cardiac rehabilitation varies by subgroup, from $18,101 per QALY gained to 
$104,518 per QALY gained. There is uncertainty in the estimates due to 
uncertainty in the clinical effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation. Overall, 
the probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that 75% of the time participation 
in cardiac rehabilitation is more expensive but more effective than not 
participating in cardiac rehabilitation.
CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation varies depending on 
patient characteristics. The current analysis indicates that cardiac 
rehabilitation is most cost effective for those with an ACS and those who are at 
higher risk for subsequent cardiac events. The findings of the current study 
provide insight into who may benefit most from cardiac rehabilitation, with 
important implications for patient referral patterns.

BACKGROUND: To assess the impact of children's dental health status (DHS) on 
their oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL).
METHODS: Participants were 11- and 12-year-old children attending public schools 
in the Kuwait Capital Region. Children's DHS was evaluated by clinical 
examinations and presented using decayed, missed, filled teeth/surface 
(DMFT/dmft, DMFS/dmfs); restorative (RI), plaque (PI); and pulp, ulcers, 
fistula, abscess (PUFA) indices. Children's OHRQoL was assessed using Child's 
Perception Questionnaire 11-14 (CPQ11-14). Means (SD) and frequencies were used 
for data description. Different factors were analyzed as predictors of OHRQoL by 
logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 440 children aged 11-12 years (50.7 % females) participated 
in this cross-sectional study. Mean (SD) DMFT/dmft, RI, PI, and PUFA scores were 
2.91(2.75), 0.21 (0.34), 3.59 (1.63), 0.31 (0.85), respectively. The mean total 
CPQ11-14 was 20.72 (16.81). Mean scores of oral-symptoms, 
functional-limitations, emotional and social well-being were 4.26 (3.32), 5.40 
(4.92), 5.48 (6.15), and 5.33 (6.05), respectively. Children with more than four 
fillings were 95 % less likely to have had oral symptoms than those with no 
fillings. Children with a DMFT/dmft of 2-3 were 2.8 times more likely to have 
functional limitation than those with a DMFT/dmft of 0, while children with a 
DMFT/dmft of more than 4 were 4.4 times more likely to experience limitations. 
Having two or three non-cavitated lesions reduced the odds of having 
functional-limitation by 58 %. Children with more than four missing teeth were 
45 % more likely to experience emotional stress. Having more than four fissure 
sealants reduced the odds of having emotional stress by 46 %.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the number of carious teeth was associated with a 
limitation in oral functions. Preventive treatment had a positive impact on 
children's emotional well-being and restorative treatments improved their oral 
function.

Netherlands.

PURPOSE: To investigate the cost and effects of risk factor guided screening 
strategies for retinopathy of prematurity.
METHODS: Clinical data from the Netherlands Retinopathy of Prematurity study 
(NEDROP study) that included all infants screened for ROP and born in 2009 were 
used to assess the cost and effects of several screening strategies for ROP 
using different criteria: (1) gestational age (GA), (2) birthweight (BW), (3) 
combined GA-BW and (4) combined GA-BW and presence of risk factors. Two 
treatment strategies were evaluated: the infants actually treated in the NEDROP 
study (n = 17) and all infants detected with severe ROP (n = 29).
RESULTS: The most efficient screening strategy to include all infants treated 
for both treatment strategies is to screen all infants with a GA of 30 weeks or 
less and a BW of 1250 g or lower together with infants with a GA of 30-32 weeks 
and a BW of 1250-1500 g with at least one risk factor. The marginal cost ranged 
from €43 848 to € 226 914 per additional infant with improved vision.
CONCLUSION: The current Dutch guideline may be improved: the same effectiveness 
can be obtained for lower costs. Releasing the precondition that no infants with 
severe ROP might be missed will lead to lower costs, but this will also lead to 
a lower number of infants with improved visual acuity. The costs of detecting 
all infants with severe ROP seem acceptable for society when the QALY gain and 
savings from a societal perspective resulting from improved vision are taken 
into account.

We report a case of lip repair surgery performed for bilateral cleft lip and 
palate in a patient diagnosed with trisomy 13 and holoprosencephaly. At the age 
of 2 years and 7 months, the surgery was performed using a modified De Hann 
design under general anesthesia. The operation was completed in 1 h and 21 min 
without large fluctuations in the child's general condition. The precise 
measurement of the intraoperative design was omitted, and the operation was 
completed using minimal skin sutures. It is possible to perform less-invasive 
and short surgical procedures after careful consideration during the 
preoperative planning. Considering the recent improvements in the life 
expectancy of patients with trisomy 13, we conclude that surgical treatments for 
non-life threatening malformations such as cleft lip and palate should be 
performed for such patients.

Antiaging therapies show promise in model organism research. Translation to 
humans is needed to address the challenges of an aging global population. 
Interventions to slow human aging will need to be applied to still-young 
individuals. However, most human aging research examines older adults, many with 
chronic disease. As a result, little is known about aging in young humans. We 
studied aging in 954 young humans, the Dunedin Study birth cohort, tracking 
multiple biomarkers across three time points spanning their third and fourth 
decades of life. We developed and validated two methods by which aging can be 
measured in young adults, one cross-sectional and one longitudinal. Our 
longitudinal measure allows quantification of the pace of coordinated 
physiological deterioration across multiple organ systems (e.g., pulmonary, 
periodontal, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and immune function). We applied 
these methods to assess biological aging in young humans who had not yet 
developed age-related diseases. Young individuals of the same chronological age 
varied in their "biological aging" (declining integrity of multiple organ 
systems). Already, before midlife, individuals who were aging more rapidly were 
less physically able, showed cognitive decline and brain aging, self-reported 
worse health, and looked older. Measured biological aging in young adults can be 
used to identify causes of aging and evaluate rejuvenation therapies.

Using historical data from 1,763 birth cohorts from 1800 to 1935 in 13 developed 
countries, we show that what is now seen as normal-a large excess of female life 
expectancy in adulthood-is a demographic phenomenon that emerged among people 
born in the late 1800s. We show that excess adult male mortality is clearly 
rooted in specific age groups, 50-70, and that the sex asymmetry emerged in 
cohorts born after 1880 when male:female mortality ratios increased by as much 
as 50% from a baseline of about 1.1. Heart disease is the main condition 
associated with increased excess male mortality for those born after 1900. We 
further show that smoking-attributable deaths account for about 30% of excess 
male mortality at ages 50-70 for cohorts born in 1900-1935. However, after 
accounting for smoking, substantial excess male mortality at ages 50-70 
remained, particularly from cardiovascular disease. The greater male 
vulnerability to cardiovascular conditions emerged with the reduction in 
infectious mortality and changes in health-related behaviors.

With the progressive aging of the population, osteoporosis has gradually grown 
into a global health problem for men and women aged 50 years and older because 
of its consequences in terms of disabilities and fragility fractures. This is 
especially true in the People's Republic of China, which has the largest 
population and an increasing proportion of elderly people, as osteoporosis has 
become a serious challenge to the Chinese government, society, and family. Apart 
from the fact that all osteoporotic fractures can increase the patient's 
morbidity, they can also result in fractures of the hip and vertebrae, which are 
associated with a significantly higher mortality. The cost of osteoporotic 
fractures, moreover, is a heavy burden on families, society, and even the 
country, which is likely to increase in the future due, in part, to the 
improvement in average life expectancy. Therefore, understanding the 
epidemiology of osteoporosis is essential and is significant for developing 
strategies to help reduce this problem. In this review, we will summarize the 
epidemiology of osteoporosis in the People's Republic of China, including the 
epidemiology of osteoporotic fractures, focusing on preventive methods and the 
management of osteoporosis, which consist of basic measures and pharmacological 
treatments.

World life expectancy is increasing and many populations will begin to age 
rapidly. The impeding prevalence of a greater number of older people living 
longer lives will have significant social and economic implications. It is 
important to understand how older people make economic and social decisions. 
Aging can be associated with a "phenomenon of decline" and also greater wisdom. 
This paper seeks to examine the relationship between wisdom and aging. It 
reviews and connects the behavioral sciences and neuroscience literature on age 
differences in the following social and economic decision making domains that 
represent subcomponents of wisdom: (1) prosocial behavior in experimental 
economic games and competitive situations; (2) resolving social conflicts; (3) 
emotional homeostasis; (4) self-reflection; (5) dealing effectively with 
uncertainty in the domains of risk, ambiguity and intertemporal choice. Overall, 
we find a lack of research into how older people make economic and social 
decisions. There is, however, some evidence that older adults outperform young 
adults on certain subcomponents of wisdom, but the exact relationship between 
old age and each subcomponent remains unclear. A better understanding of these 
relationships holds the potential to alleviate a wide range of mental health 
problems, and has broad implications for social policies aimed at the elderly.

Pleural involvement in lung cancer.

Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Patras, Patras, Greece.

The pleural space, a sterile secluded environment in the thoracic cavity, 
represents an attractive metastatic site for various cancers of lung, breast and 
gastrointestinal origins. Whereas lung and breast adenocarcinomas could invade 
the pleural space because of their anatomic proximity, "distant" cancers like 
ovarian or gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas may employ more active 
mechanisms to the same end. A pleural metastasis is often accompanied by a 
malignant pleural effusion (MPE), an unfavorable complication that severely 
restricts the quality of life and expectancy of the cancer patient. MPE is the 
net "product" of three different processes, namely inflammation, enhanced 
angiogenesis and vascular leakage. Current efforts are focusing on the 
identification of cancer cell autocrine (specific mutation spectra and 
biochemical pathways) and paracrine (cytokine and chemokine signals) 
characteristics as well as host features (immunological or other) that underlie 
the MPE phenotype. Herein we examine the pleural histology, cytology and 
molecular characteristics that make the pleural cavity an attractive metastasis 
destination for lung adenocarcinoma. Mesothelial and tumor features that may 
account for the tumor's ability to invade the pleural space are highlighted. 
Finally, possible therapeutic interventions specifically targeting MPE are 
discussed.

IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of cardiometabolic multimorbidity is increasing.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate reductions in life expectancy associated with 
cardiometabolic multimorbidity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Age- and sex-adjusted mortality rates and 
hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using individual participant data from the 
Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (689,300 participants; 91 cohorts; years of 
baseline surveys: 1960-2007; latest mortality follow-up: April 2013; 128,843 
deaths). The HRs from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration were compared with 
those from the UK Biobank (499,808 participants; years of baseline surveys: 
2006-2010; latest mortality follow-up: November 2013; 7995 deaths). Cumulative 
survival was estimated by applying calculated age-specific HRs for mortality to 
contemporary US age-specific death rates.
EXPOSURES: A history of 2 or more of the following: diabetes mellitus, stroke, 
myocardial infarction (MI).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause mortality and estimated reductions in life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: In participants in the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration without a 
history of diabetes, stroke, or MI at baseline (reference group), the all-cause 
mortality rate adjusted to the age of 60 years was 6.8 per 1000 person-years. 
Mortality rates per 1000 person-years were 15.6 in participants with a history 
of diabetes, 16.1 in those with stroke, 16.8 in those with MI, 32.0 in those 
with both diabetes and MI, 32.5 in those with both diabetes and stroke, 32.8 in 
those with both stroke and MI, and 59.5 in those with diabetes, stroke, and MI. 
Compared with the reference group, the HRs for all-cause mortality were 1.9 (95% 
CI, 1.8-2.0) in participants with a history of diabetes, 2.1 (95% CI, 2.0-2.2) 
in those with stroke, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.9-2.2) in those with MI, 3.7 (95% CI, 
3.3-4.1) in those with both diabetes and MI, 3.8 (95% CI, 3.5-4.2) in those with 
both diabetes and stroke, 3.5 (95% CI, 3.1-4.0) in those with both stroke and 
MI, and 6.9 (95% CI, 5.7-8.3) in those with diabetes, stroke, and MI. The HRs 
from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration were similar to those from the more 
recently recruited UK Biobank. The HRs were little changed after further 
adjustment for markers of established intermediate pathways (eg, levels of 
lipids and blood pressure) and lifestyle factors (eg, smoking, diet). At the age 
of 60 years, a history of any 2 of these conditions was associated with 12 years 
of reduced life expectancy and a history of all 3 of these conditions was 
associated with 15 years of reduced life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mortality associated with a history of diabetes, 
stroke, or MI was similar for each condition. Because any combination of these 
conditions was associated with multiplicative mortality risk, life expectancy 
was substantially lower in people with multimorbidity.

Due to increased life expectancy, the prevalence of cognitive decline related to 
neurodegenerative diseases and to non-neurological conditions is increasing in 
western countries. As with other diseases, the burden might be reduced through 
personalized interventions delivered at early stages of the disease. Thus, there 
is an increasing demand, from both social and healthcare systems, for 
instruments and strategies to recognize cognitive decline, and possibly 
distinguish the precursor of serious neurodegeneration from "benign senile 
forgetfulness" or the temporary consequences of illness or trauma. However, this 
goal faces both technical and ethical issues. In this article we deal with the 
following: (i) re-definition of cognitive decline and its relationship with 
frailty definitions, starting from the recent work of international consensus 
groups for presymptomatic Alzheimer disease recognition; (ii) ethical problems 
concerning anonymous and personalized cognitive screening and the need for 
appropriate counselling; (iii) the need for more sensitive and specific tools to 
detect and distinguish pathological levels of cognitive decline and delineate 
the contribution of non-pathological decline to accumulated frailty impacts and 
(iv) the potential of the language domain and spontaneous speech analyses.

Thanks to science advances, cancer is no longer synonymous with death. Life 
expectancy improvement reveals a new problem: cancer treatment toxicity, 
including cardiovascular complications, responsible for significant morbidity 
and mortality. Media scandal of drug-induced valvular heart disease did revise 
the risk-benefit balance of drugs used (often off-label) as anorectics. Today's 
society uses drugs heavily but does not accept their side effects. Knowledge and 
information of these complications is essential. Coronary toxicity of some 
treatments or drugs commonly used must be known.

INTRODUCTION: Myelofibrosis (MF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm associated 
with significant disease burden composed of splenomegaly, constitutional 
symptoms and a reduced life expectancy. The advent of targeted treatments has 
provided new means by which to improve MF associated splenomegaly, symptoms, 
health-related quality of life and even mortality.
AREAS COVERED: We discuss the spectrum of targeted treatments currently under 
investigation for MF. We furthermore compare their effects on improving anemia, 
reducing fibrosis and splenomegaly and enhancing symptom control.
EXPERT OPINION: MF is a complex disorder, partly attributable to its 
heterogeneity. Although the severity of patient symptoms correlates with risk 
category, high symptom burden may also be observed in low-risk patients. Serial 
use of PRO tools allows clinicians to objectively evaluate the MF symptom 
burden, compare efficacy of therapies and adjust medications to improve symptom 
control. Novel targeted agents have proven superior to historic treatment 
regimens for symptom management. Promising treatment categories include JAK2 
inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, hypomethylating agents, heat shock 
protein-90 inhibitors, hedgehog inhibitors, PI3-AKT-mTOR inhibitors, 
antifibrosing agents and telomerase inhibitors. The majority of therapies remain 
under investigation, either alone or in combination with other treatments. It is
