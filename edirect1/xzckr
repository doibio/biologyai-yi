Objectives To assess the cost-effectiveness of erenumab 140 mg ("erenumab") for 
the prophylactic treatment of episodic migraine and chronic migraine. Study 
design A hybrid Monte Carlo patient simulation and Markov cohort model was 
constructed to compare erenumab to no preventive treatment or onabotulinumtoxinA 
among adult ( ≥ 18 years) patients with episodic migraine and chronic migraine 
who failed prior preventive therapy from the US societal and payer perspectives. 
Methods Patients entered the model one at a time and were assigned to a 
post-treatment monthly migraine day category based on baseline monthly migraine 
days and treatment effect. Using monthly cycles, patients were followed for 2 
years and accumulated costs and utilities associated with their post-treatment 
monthly migraine days. The primary outcome included the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio presented as cost per quality-adjusted life year 
gained. Results With an annual drug price of erenumab of $6900, treatment with 
erenumab in the societal perspective ranges from a dominant strategy versus no 
preventive treatment among chronic migraine patients to an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $122,167 versus no preventive treatment among 
episodic migraine patients. When excluding indirect costs (i.e. payer 
perspective), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are cost-effective among 
chronic migraine patients ($23,079 and $65,720 versus no preventive treatment 
and onabotulinumtoxinA, respectively), but not among episodic migraine patients 
($180,012 versus no preventive treatment). Model results were sensitive to 
changes in monthly migraine days, health utilities, and treatment costs. 
Conclusion The use of erenumab may be a cost-effective approach to preventing 
monthly migraine days among patients with chronic migraine versus 
onabotulinumtoxinA and no preventive treatment in the societal and payer 
perspectives, but is less likely to offer good value for money for those with 
episodic migraine, unless lost productivity costs are considered.

BACKGROUND: Millions of Americans are currently living with diabetes and 
approximately 1.5 million cases are being diagnosed each year. Diabetes is now 
the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. In addition, the 
economic burden of the disease has resulted in billions of dollars in health 
care costs. In spite of these investments, the United States lags behind other 
developed countries on diabetes life expectancy and disease-related deaths. The 
purpose of this study is to assess the impact of a pharmacist-managed diabetes 
clinic (PMDC) model on diabetes core measures. Our hypothesis is that a PMDC 
would have a significant positive impact on the diabetes measures and will 
result in higher-quality care at a lower price.
METHODS: This study is a randomized, open-label, controlled, parallel-group 
trial which will be conducted in the outpatient clinic at Beaumont Hospital, 
Royal Oak, Michigan. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 
standard of care (SOC) or standard of care plus PMDC (SOC + PMDC). Included in 
the study will be patients older than 18 years of age with a diagnosis of type 2 
diabetes mellitus and a hemoglobin A1c ≥ 9%, who are established with a primary 
care resident and who have not been seen in the PMDC within the last 3 months. 
The primary outcome is the change in hemoglobin A1c, measured at 6 and 
12 months. Secondary outcomes include the impact on all diabetes core measures, 
patient quality of life, harms, and cost impact related to the intervention.
DISCUSSION: If the results of this trial are consistent with the previous 
retrospective analysis that a pharmacy clinic has a significant impact in 
controlling hemoglobin A1c levels as well as other diabetes core measures to 
improve clinical outcomes, it will constitute a scaffold for a future 
multicenter, randomized controlled trial. In addition, these results may 
influence future diabetes guidelines, leading to the inclusion of a PMDC as the 
standard of care. The impact of these results on the economic burden, life 
expectancy, and diabetes-related deaths are needed and have yet to be studied.

The MHC class I-related receptor FcRn serves multiple roles ranging from the 
regulation of levels of IgG isotype antibodies and albumin throughout the body 
to the delivery of antigen into antigen loading compartments in specialized 
antigen-presenting cells. In parallel with studies directed towards 
understanding FcRn at the molecular and cellular levels, there has been an 
enormous expansion in the development of engineering strategies involving FcRn 
to modulate the dynamic behavior of antibodies, antigens, and albumin. In this 
review article, we focus on a discussion of FcRn-targeted approaches that have 
resulted in the production of novel antibody-based platforms with considerable 
potential for use in the clinic.

OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into the natural history and carcinogenesis pathway 
of Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN) lesions by building a calibrated 
simulation model of PanIN progression to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) 
METHODS: We revised a previously validated simulation model of solid PDAC, 
calibrating the model to fit data from the National Cancer Institute's 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and published literature on 
PanIN prevalence by age. We estimated the likelihood of progression from PanIN 
states (1, 2, and 3) to PDAC and the time between PanIN onset and PDAC (dwell 
time). We evaluated a hypothetical intervention to test for and treat PanIN 3 
lesions to estimate the potential benefits from PanIN detection.
RESULTS: We estimated the lifetime probability of progressing from PanIN 1 to 
PDAC to be 1.5% (men), 1.3% (women). Progression from PanIN 1 to PDAC took 33.6 
years and 35.3 years, respectively, and from PanIN 3 to PDAC took 11.3 years and 
12.3 years. A hypothetical test for PanIN 3 detection and treatment could 
provide a maximum, average life expectancy gain of 40 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Our modeling analysis estimates PanINs have a relatively indolent 
course to PDAC, supporting the feasibility of potential future early detection 
strategies.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chronic inflammatory diseases (CID) are associated with a 
profound increase in cardiovascular (CV) risk resulting in reduced life 
expectancy. However, LDL-cholesterol is reported to be low in CID patients which 
is referred to as the "LDL paradoxon". The aim of the present study was to 
investigate whether LDL-particles in CID exhibit an increased content of the 
highly atherogenic small-dense LDL subfraction (sdLDL).
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective, single center, observational study we 
enrolled 141 patients with CID (RA n = 59, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
n = 35, ankylosing spondylitis (SpA) n = 25, Psoriasis n = 22) in 2011 through 
2013 to evaluate sdLDL levels before as well as 6 and 26 weeks after initiation 
of different anti-cytokine therapies (anti-TNFα, anti-IL-6R antibodies). sdLDL 
levels were compared to 141 healthy individuals in a case control design. 
Compared to healthy controls, all CID patients displayed a significantly higher 
sdLDL content within the LDL cholesterol fraction: RA 35.0 ± 9.2% (p < 0.001), 
SpA 42.5 ± 10.5% (p < 0.001), IBD 37.5 ± 7.1% (p < 0.001), Psoriasis 33.6 ± 4.6% 
(p < 0.01). Furthermore, the sdLDL/LDL ratio was significantly higher in male 
compared to female RA subjects (p < 0.05). Neither anti-TNFα nor anti-IL6R 
medication altered sdLDL levels despite a significant improvement of disease 
activity.
CONCLUSION: In several different chronic inflammatory disease entities, 
LDL-cholesterol is shifted toward a pro-atherogenic phenotype due to an 
increased sdLDL content which might in part explain the LDL paradoxon. Since 
premature CV disease is a major burden of affected patients, specifically 
targeting lipid metabolism should be considered routinely in clinical patient 
care.

BACKGROUND: This study measures the burden of chronic diseases associated with 
being underweight.
METHODS: Underweight prevalence in the community was obtained from national 
survey data, together with hospital use rates for malnourished and 
non-malnourished persons for diagnoses associated with underweight. 
Meta-analyses of published literature calculated the following disease-specific 
relative risks: incidence of underweight-associated disease (UAD), mortality 
from UAD, and all-cause and disease-specific mortality after hospitalization in 
underweight persons. This enabled the calculation of hospital days, deaths, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to underweight deconstructed 
into UAD and disease-associated underweight (DAU). Cost estimates were based on 
general hospitalization costs adjusted by estimates of pharmaceutical and other 
direct care costs.
RESULTS: We found 60,401 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 58,257-63,095) general 
hospital days, 558 (95% CI: 219-879) deaths, 5258 (95% CI: 2174-8382) potential 
years of life lost, and 3390 lost DALYs (95% CI: 1511-5333) were attributable to 
underweight annually in Israeli adults aged ≥18 years. Annually, direct health 
costs amounted to $145.6 million (95% CI: $141.9-$150.5 million), with general 
hospital days accounting for $53.4 million, pharmaceuticals $18.2 million, and 
other direct healthcare costs $73.9 million. Musculoskeletal disorders accounted 
for nearly half of these costs with coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, and stroke accounting for 15.4%, 10.3%, and 9.3%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Underweight imposes a considerable health burden in terms of 
deaths, health service use, and resource costs in Israel. Identification of 
cost-effective interventions to reduce this burden, not only among hospitalized 
patients, but also among persons living in the community, is essential.

Pharmacoeconomics Evaluations of Oral Anticancer Agents: Systematic Review of 
Characteristics, Methodological Trends, and Reporting Quality.

OBJECTIVES: To review literature characteristics, describe methodological 
trends, and assess the reporting quality of the economic evaluations of oral 
anticancer drugs (OACDs).
METHODS: The review included comparative economic evaluations of OACDs. The 
search was conducted via PubMed, Embase, EconLit, and Economic Evaluation 
Database, and studies till December 2017 were included. Using the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist, literature 
inclusion and data extraction were performed in duplicate by separate 
investigators. Outcome measures were literature characteristics, gaps and 
methodological trends, and reporting quality using the Consolidated Health 
Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist. Data were summarized on the 
basis of methodological themes of interest. Descriptive statistics and 
tabulations were used for result presentation.
RESULTS: Out of 241 found articles, 21 were included. There is a recent 
increasing interest in the economics of OACDs, whereby the cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year, via cost-utility analysis, is the most used for 
decision making. Most of the studies were from the payer perspective, and the 
primary sources of data were clinical trials, expert panels, and medical charts. 
The dominance status (higher effect, lower cost) was a commonly reported 
outcome. Decision-analytic modeling was used in most of the studies, mostly 
including Markov modeling. Studies were highly heterogeneous in methodological 
aspects, and the included studies did not meet most of the reporting quality 
criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: High heterogeneity in methods in studies may limit the robustness 
and transferability of results, potentially misleading decision makers toward 
wrong decisions on OACDs. The transferability and generalizability of results 
are further limited by a "less than ideal" adherence to current reporting 
standards.

We present an economic evaluation of a recently completed cohort study in which 
2054 seniors were screened for atrial fibrillation (AF) in 22 Canadian family 
practices. Using a Markov model, trial and literature data were used to project 
long-term outcomes and costs associated with 4 AF screening strategies for 
individuals aged 65 years or older: no screening, screen with 30-second radial 
manual pulse check (pulse check), screen with a blood pressure machine with AF 
detection (BP-AF), and screen with a single-lead electrocardiogram (SL-ECG). 
Costs and outcomes were discounted at 1.5% and the model used a lifetime horizon 
from a public payer perspective. Compared with no screening, screening for AF in 
Canadian family practice offices using pulse check or screen with a blood 
pressure machine with AF detection is the dominant strategy whereas screening 
with SL-ECG is a highly cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of CAD$4788. When different screening 
strategies were compared, screening with pulse check had the lowest expected 
costs ($202) and screening with SL-ECG had the highest expected costs ($222). 
The no-screening arm resulted in the lowest number of QALYs (8.74195) whereas 
pulse check and SL-ECG resulted in the highest expected QALYs (8.74362). 
Probabilistic analysis confirmed that pulse check had the highest probability of 
being cost-effective (63%) assuming a willingness to pay of $50,000 per QALY 
gained. Screening for AF in seniors during routine appointments with Canadian 
family physicians is a cost-effective strategy compared with no screening. 
Screening with a pulse check is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy.

Physicians are increasingly caring for immunocompromised individuals owing, in 
part, to the improved treatments and the increased life expectancy in these 
patients. Presentation of a patient with hand infection can vary greatly 
depending on the patient's underlying immune status. It is important to 
recognize and treat the infections quickly and effectively owing to the higher 
morbidity and mortality that may result from ineffective or delayed treatment in 
this patient population. The purpose of this article is to provide an outline of 
the most common and some of the more exotic organisms causing hand infections in 
patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 
diabetes, and patients on immunosuppressive treatment. We discuss presentation, 
clinical picture, evidence-based approaches in treatment, and possible 
complications. It is important to inform surgeons of the atypical presentation 
of hand infections and systemic infections with hand manifestation in 
immunocompromised patients in order to shorten time to accurate diagnosis and 
effective treatment.

Radiation therapy technique and schedules could be adapted to patient's age 
because of a natural history of prostate cancer perceived as different, taking 
into account the comorbidities of patients but also a particular tolerance of 
elderly subjects. Thus, in localized prostate cancer, evaluation of associated 
diseases is essential before considering a treatment that will be of interest 
only if the life expectancy is greater than 10 years. When a curative approach 
is decided, radiotherapy holds a place of choice. Due to the recent results of 
randomized studies evaluating moderate hypofractionnated radiotherapy, showing a 
carcinological equivalence compared to a standard fractionation, this reduction 
in the duration of treatment appears particularly indicated in this elderly 
population. This approach permits to maintain the quality of life of patients, 
potentially with lower costs for society. The purpose of this article is to 
present the results of randomized trials of moderate hypofractionnation and 
discuss their application in the population of elderly patients with localized 
prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND: When toddlers learn to walk, they do so with a typical high guard 
position of the arms. As gait matures, children develop a reciprocal arm swing. 
So far, there have been no attempts to describe age-related changes of arm 
movements during walking after this first rapid development.
RESEARCH QUESTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate age-related 
changes in arm movement during typical gait.
METHODS: All participants (n = 102) received gait analysis using a full-body 
marker set (Plug-in Gait). Participants were divided into five age-groups: young 
children (G1: n = 20; 3.0-5.9y), children (G2: n = 24; 6.0-9.9y), pubertal 
children (G3: n = 26; 10.0-13.9y), adolescents (G4: n = 16; 14.0-18.9y) and 
adults (G5: n = 16; 19.0-35.2y). Age-related changes in arm movements were 
investigated by comparing continuous joint angular waveforms (spm1d) between all 
groups, as well as by comparing the mean joint angle and range of motion of the 
different joints between age-groups.
RESULTS: The overall shape of movement patterns was comparable across all age 
groups. Nevertheless, with advancing age, consistency increased. At the 
shoulder, G1&2 showed a larger mean extension angle compared to older children 
and adults. The range of shoulder axial rotation was significantly larger in 
adults compared to all other age groups. In the youngest groups (G1-G2), an 
increased mean elbow flexion and mean wrist extension angle was found.
SIGNIFICANCE: Determining an exact age of maturation of arm swing remains 
difficult as parameter specific adult-like values were not reached at the same 
age but should not be set before the age of ten to fourteen years for any 
parameter.

With the increasing life expectancy of the world's population, neurodegenerative 
diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), will become a much more relevant 
public health issue. This fact, coupled with the lack of efficacy of the 
available treatments, has been driving research directed to the development of 
new drugs for this pathology. Metal-protein attenuating compounds (MPACs) 
constitute a promising class of agents with potential application on the 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. Currently, most MPACs are 
based on 8-hydroxyquinoline. Recently, our research group has described the 
hybrid aroylhydrazone containing the 8-hydroxyquinoline group INHHQ as a 
promising MPAC. By studying the known structure-related ligand HPCIH, which does 
not contain the phenol moiety, as a simplified chemical model for INHHQ, we 
aimed to clarify the real impact of the aroylhydrazone group for the MPAC 
activity of a compound with potential anti-Alzheimer's activity. The present 
work describes a detailed solution and solid-state study of the coordination of 
HPCIH with Zn2+ ions, as well as its in vitro binding-ability towards this metal 
in the presence of the Aβ(1-40) peptide. Similar to INHHQ, HPCIH is able to 
efficiently compete with Aβ(1-40) for Zn2+ ions, performing as expected for an 
MPAC. The similarity between the behaviors of both ligands is remarkable. Taken 
together, the data presented herein point to aroylhydrazones, such as the 
compounds HPCIH and the previously published INHHQ, as encouraging MPACs for the 
treatment of AD.

INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has set ambitious goals to 
reduce the global disease burden associated with, and eventually eliminate, 
viral hepatitis.
OBJECTIVE: To assist with achieving these goals and to inform the development of 
a national strategic plan for Malaysia, we estimated the long-term burden 
incurred by the care and management of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) infection. We compared cumulative healthcare costs and disease burden 
under different treatment cascade scenarios.
METHODS: We attached direct costs for the management/care of chronically 
HCV-infected patients to a previously developed clinical disease progression 
model. Under assumptions regarding disease stage-specific proportions of 
model-predicted HCV patients within care, annual numbers of patients initiated 
on antiviral treatment and distribution of treatments over stage, we projected 
the healthcare costs and disease burden [in disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALY)] in 2018-2040 under four treatment scenarios: (A) no treatment/baseline; 
(B) pre-2018 standard of care (pegylated interferon/ribavirin); (C) gradual 
scale-up in direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment uptake that does not meet 
the WHO 2030 treatment uptake target; (D) scale-up in DAA treatment uptake that 
meets the WHO 2030 target.
RESULTS: Scenario D, while achieving the WHO 2030 target and averting 253,500 
DALYs compared with the pre-2018 standard of care B, incurred the highest direct 
patient costs over the period 2018-2030: US$890 million (95% uncertainty 
interval 653-1271). When including screening programme costs, the total cost was 
estimated at US$952 million, which was 12% higher than the estimated total cost 
of scenario C.
CONCLUSIONS: The scale-up to meet the WHO 2030 target may be achievable with 
appropriately high governmental commitment to the expansion of HCV screening to 
bring sufficient undiagnosed chronically infected patients into the treatment 
pathway.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the number of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients 
in the future based on projections of population size underestimated PD burden 
because they did not take into account the improvement of life expectancy over 
time.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess PD progression from 2010 to 
2030 in France in terms of prevalent patient numbers, prevalence rates, lifetime 
risk, and life expectancy with PD, accounting for projections of overall 
mortality and increased risk of death of PD patients.
METHODS: To provide projections of PD burden, we applied a multistate approach 
considering age and calendar time to incidence and prevalence rates of PD 
(France 2010) based on drug claims and national demographic data.
RESULTS: The number of PD patients will increase by ∼65% between 2010 
(n = 155,000) and 2030 (n ∼ 260,000), mainly for individuals older than 65 
years; the prevalence rate of PD after age 45 will increase from 0.59% in 2010 
to ∼0.80% in 2030. We project an extension of ∼3 years of the life expectancy of 
PD patients at 65 years between 2010 (women, 14.8 years; men, 13.0 years) and 
2030 (women, 17.8 years; men, 16.1 years), and a relative increase of about 10% 
of the lifetime risk of PD at 45 years between 2010 (women, 5.5%; men, 6.0%) and 
2030 (women, 6.3%; men, 7.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: The number of PD patients is predicted to grow substantially in 
future years as a consequence of population aging and life expectancy 
improvement. The assessment of the future PD burden is an important step for 
planning resources needed for patient care in aging societies. © 2018

INTRODUCTION: Placebo and nocebo effects form part of all therapeutic 
environments and play a significant role in the effectiveness of treatment 
outcomes. Patient expectancies drive these phenomena, which can be shaped 
through contextual factors including verbal suggestions, conditioning, and 
social observation.
OBJECTIVES: This review seeks to identify the biopsychosocial factors of the 
patient-practitioner interaction that play a role in the development of placebo 
and nocebo effects, as well as the anthropological elements of the biodynamic 
process of relating that are meaningful in the development of expectancies.
METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of frameworks of the placebo and nocebo 
effect, including the impact of expectancies and interpersonal relationships in 
the context of healing and the clinical setting.
RESULTS: Expectancies leading to placebo and nocebo effects can be modified by 
macro and micro factors, such as culture and society, as well as individual 
psychobiological traits, respectively. The developmental sociobiological 
adaptations that form and consolidate mindsets and meaningful contexts play an 
important role in shaping patient expectancies, as well as patients' conscious 
and subconscious reactions to signs and actions taking place within the clinical 
environment. Practitioner characteristics, like empathy, friendliness, and 
competence, favor the formation of positive expectancies. Caring and warm 
patient-practitioner interactions can enhance the therapeutic value of clinical 
encounters when patients' positive expectancies are actively encouraged and 
engaged.
CONCLUSION: A patient-centered approach rooted in demonstrating care and empathy 
can positively enhance a patient's experience within the clinical environment 
and activate psychosociobiological adaptations associated with the placebo 
phenomenon. Pain patients could particularly benefit from non-invasive 
approaches for improving treatment effectiveness and quality-of-life.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for death and disability, but 
its overall association with health remains complex given the possible 
protective effects of moderate alcohol consumption on some conditions. With our 
comprehensive approach to health accounting within the Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we generated improved estimates 
of alcohol use and alcohol-attributable deaths and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) for 195 locations from 1990 to 2016, for both sexes and for 
5-year age groups between the ages of 15 years and 95 years and older.
METHODS: Using 694 data sources of individual and population-level alcohol 
consumption, along with 592 prospective and retrospective studies on the risk of 
alcohol use, we produced estimates of the prevalence of current drinking, 
abstention, the distribution of alcohol consumption among current drinkers in 
standard drinks daily (defined as 10 g of pure ethyl alcohol), and 
alcohol-attributable deaths and DALYs. We made several methodological 
improvements compared with previous estimates: first, we adjusted alcohol sales 
estimates to take into account tourist and unrecorded consumption; second, we 
did a new meta-analysis of relative risks for 23 health outcomes associated with 
alcohol use; and third, we developed a new method to quantify the level of 
alcohol consumption that minimises the overall risk to individual health.
FINDINGS: Globally, alcohol use was the seventh leading risk factor for both 
deaths and DALYs in 2016, accounting for 2·2% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
1·5-3·0) of age-standardised female deaths and 6·8% (5·8-8·0) of 
age-standardised male deaths. Among the population aged 15-49 years, alcohol use 
was the leading risk factor globally in 2016, with 3·8% (95% UI 3·2-4·3) of 
female deaths and 12·2% (10·8-13·6) of male deaths attributable to alcohol use. 
For the population aged 15-49 years, female attributable DALYs were 2·3% (95% UI 
2·0-2·6) and male attributable DALYs were 8·9% (7·8-9·9). The three leading 
causes of attributable deaths in this age group were tuberculosis (1·4% [95% UI 
1·0-1·7] of total deaths), road injuries (1·2% [0·7-1·9]), and self-harm (1·1% 
[0·6-1·5]). For populations aged 50 years and older, cancers accounted for a 
large proportion of total alcohol-attributable deaths in 2016, constituting 
27·1% (95% UI 21·2-33·3) of total alcohol-attributable female deaths and 18·9% 
(15·3-22·6) of male deaths. The level of alcohol consumption that minimised harm 
across health outcomes was zero (95% UI 0·0-0·8) standard drinks per week.
INTERPRETATION: Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for global disease burden 
and causes substantial health loss. We found that the risk of all-cause 
mortality, and of cancers specifically, rises with increasing levels of 
consumption, and the level of consumption that minimises health loss is zero. 
These results suggest that alcohol control policies might need to be revised 
worldwide, refocusing on efforts to lower overall population-level consumption.

The historical change in the concept of frailty has been observed from 1980s, 
and even now there are major two models of frailty, phenotype model and deficit 
accumulation model. Furthermore besides physical frailty, psychological frailty, 
which encompasses cognitive and mood components, and social frailty, which 
includes the lack of participation in social networks and perceived lack of 
contacts and support, have been proposed, although there is no consensus 
regarding the definition as well as criteria of these frailty. In super-aged 
society, Japan, from the viewpoint of healthy life expectancy, the concept of 
phenotype model of frailty is important.
