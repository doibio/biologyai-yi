BACKGROUND: The present study tries to provide a comprehensive estimate of 
gender differences in the years of life lost due to CVD across the major states 
of India during 2017-18.
METHODS: The information on the CVD related data were collected from medical 
certification of causes of death (MCCD reports, 2018). Apart from this, 
information from census of India (2001, 2011), SRS (2018) were also used to 
estimate YLL. To understand the variation in YLL due to CVD at the state level, 
nine sets of covariates were chosen: share of elderly population, percentage of 
urban population, literacy rate, health expenditure, social sector expenditure, 
labour force participation, HDI Score and co-existence of other NCDs such as 
diabetes, & obesity. The absolute number of YLL and YLL rates were calculated. 
Further, Pearson's correlation had been calculated and to understand the effect 
of explanatory variables on YLL due to CVD, multiple linear regression analysis 
had been applied.
RESULTS: Men have a higher burden of premature mortality in terms of Years of 
life lost (YLL) due to CVD than women in India, with pronounced differences at 
adult ages of 50-54 years and over. The age pattern of YLL rate suggests that 
the age group 85 + makes the highest contribution to the overall YLL rate due to 
CVD. YLL rate showed a J-shaped relationship with age, starting high at ages 
below 1 years, dropping to their lowest among children aged 1-4 years, and 
rising again to highest levels at 85 + years among both men and women. In all 
the states except Bihar men had higher estimated YLL due to CVD for all ages 
than women. Among men the YLL due to CVD was higher in Tamil Nadu followed by 
Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. On the other hand, the YLL due to CVD among men 
was lowest in Jharkhand followed by Assam. Similarly, among women the YLL due to 
CVD was highest in Tamil Nadu followed by Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. 
While, the YLL due to CVD among women was lowest in Jharkhand. Irrespective of 
gender, all factors except state health expenditure were positively linked with 
YLL due to CVD, i.e., as state health expenditure increases, the years of life 
lost (YLL) due to CVDs falls. Among all the covariates, the proportion of a 
state's elderly population emerges as the most significant predictor variable 
for YLL for CVDs (r = 0.42 for men and r = 0.50 for women).
CONCLUSION: YLL due to cardiovascular disease varies among men and women across 
the states of India. The state-specific findings of gender differences in years 
of life lost due to CVD may be used to improve policies and programmes in India.

The evidence is strong in favor of blood pressure (BP) control in robust older 
people as a way to reduce morbidity and mortality in the same way that treatment 
improves the lives of middle-aged people. Expert editorials have been written 
over the last five decades persuasively arguing for or against more intensive 
treatment of older people with hypertension, supported by the specificity of 
(then) contemporaneous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or the 
generalizability of observational studies. But there are limitations.First, 
there has always been such a thing as too low. Early epidemiological studies 
showed an upward inflection in mortality curves that resemble a slanted letter 
J. Second, certain complex older people encountered routinely in a clinic, 
pharmacy, or nursing facility were often excluded from the RCTs showing benefit 
from intensive BP control. Cohort studies of these complex people showed a 
different truth, that the point of "too low" might move up and that BP targets 
for adults might be too low for select older people. Not all older people are 
the same. Some are burdened by frailty superimposed on cardiovascular disease 
and a limited life-expectancy. It is one thing not to start BP-lowering 
medications for this patient; it is an entirely different matter to stop.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer patients and their caregivers have substantial unmet needs, 
that negatively impact the clinical outcome and quality of life. However, 
interventions aimed to address such needs are still suboptimal, failing to 
answer the recent healthcare call for the adoption of value-based models of 
care. In the case of incurable oncologic and hematologic cancers, a value-based 
model of care should plan advanced care on patients' needs and include the 
quality of death as an outcome. The integration of early palliative care into 
standard oncologic care for patients with advanced cancers represents a recent 
innovative model of assistance whose benefits for patients and caregivers are 
now widely recognized. The key elements underlying the reasons behind these 
benefits are the multidisciplinary collaboration (teamwork), an honest and 
empathetic communication between the early palliative care team, the patient, 
and the caregiver (rapport building), and the ability to detect changes in the 
physical/psychosocial wellbeing of the patient, along the whole disease 
trajectory (constant monitoring).
METHODS: This community case study documents the quantitative and qualitative 
results of a long term clinical and research experience in delivering early 
palliative care service to address both solid and blood cancer patients' and 
their primary caregivers' needs.
RESULTS: Data showed decreased use of chemotherapy, blood transfusions and 
referral to intensive care units near the end of life; increased life 
expectancy; improved symptom burden and mood; increased frequency of 
goals-of-care and advanced care planning conversations. Hope perception among 
bereaved caregivers was associated with resilience and realistic expectations 
raising from honest communication with the early palliative care team and 
appreciation toward the model. Patients and caregivers perceived the possibility 
of a good death as realistic and not as an unlikely event as it was for patients 
and caregivers on standard oncologic care only. Gratitude expressions toward the 
model and the team were frequently identified in their reports and positively 
associated with communication and spirituality.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings are discussed in the context of an updated 
literature review regarding value-based care and suggest that early palliative 
care integrated into standard oncology care may be considered as an effective 
model of value-based care.

BACKGROUND: Following the CENTURION phase 3 randomized controlled trial's 
four-month double-blind phase, this 12-month open-label extension collected data 
for up to one year about dose optimization, patterns of use, migraine-related 
disability, and quality of life during lasmiditan treatment.
METHODS: Migraine patients ≥18 years completing the double-blind phase and 
treating ≥3 migraine attacks could continue into the 12-month open-label 
extension. The initial oral lasmiditan dose was 100 mg; the dose could 
subsequently be adjusted to 50 mg or 200 mg at the investigator's discretion.
RESULTS: 477 patients entered and 321 (72.1%) completed the extension; 445 
(93.3%) treated ≥1 attack with lasmiditan. Of 11,327 attacks, 8654 (76.4%) were 
lasmiditan-treated (84.9% of these involved moderate or severe pain). By study 
end, 17.8%, 58.7%, and 23.4% of patients were taking lasmiditan 50, 100, and 
200 mg, respectively. Mean improvements were observed in disability and quality 
of life. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was dizziness (35.7% 
of patients, 9.5% of attacks).
CONCLUSIONS: During this 12-month extension, lasmiditan was associated with a 
high rate of study completion, most attacks were treated with lasmiditan, and 
patients reported improvements in migraine-related disability and quality of 
life. No new safety findings were observed with longer exposure.Trial

This analysis of the Italian health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. Italy has a regionalized National Health 
Service (SSN) that provides universal coverage largely free of charge at the 
point of delivery, though certain services and goods require a co-payment. Life 
expectancy in Italy is historically among the highest in the EU. However, 
regional differences in health indicators are marked, as well as in per capita 
spending, distribution of health professionals and in the quality of health 
services. Overall, Italy's health spending per capita is lower than the EU 
average and is among the lowest in western European countries. Private spending 
has increased in recent years, although this trend was halted in 2020 during the 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A key focus of health policies in 
recent decades was to promote a shift away from unnecessary inpatient care, with 
a considerable reduction of acute hospital beds and stagnating overall growth in 
health personnel. However, this was not counterbalanced by a sufficient 
strengthening of community services in order to cope with the ageing 
population's needs and related chronic conditions burden. This had important 
repercussions during the COVID-19 emergency, as the health system felt the 
impact of previous reductions in hospital beds and capacity and underinvestment 
in community-based care. Reorganizing hospital and community care will require a 
strong alignment between central and regional authorities. The COVID-19 crisis 
also highlighted several issues pre-dating the pandemic that need to be 
addressed to improve the sustainability and resilience of the SSN. The main 
outstanding challenges for the health system are linked to addressing historic 
underinvestment in the health workforce, modernizing outdated infrastructure and 
equipment, and enhancing information infrastructure. Italy's National Recovery 
and Resilience Plan, underwritten by the Next Generation EU budget to assist 
with economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, contains specific health 
sector priorities, such as strengthening the country's primary and community 
care, boosting capital investment and funding the digitalization of the health 
care system.

This analysis of the Czech health system reviews developments in governance, 
organization, financing and delivery of care, health reforms and health system 
performance. Czechs have enjoyed a statutory health insurance system with a high 
level of financial protection, a broad benefits package and universal membership 
for over 30 years. The central level of the state, mostly represented through 
the Ministry of Health and its subordinated bodies, takes on the various roles 
of legislator, steward and even owner of various providers of care, while also 
making insurance contributions for the sizeable part of the population 
classified as economically inactive. Health insurance funds are responsible for 
contracting sufficient care provision for their members. The Czech health system 
has traditionally derived a majority of its financing from public sources, which 
stood at 81.5% of current health expenditure in 2019, as the latest available 
year of reference, with the rest coming from private sources. While health 
spending in Czechia is below the European Union (EU) average, the densities of 
acute care beds and primary care physicians are above respective EU averages. 
Ageing and a lack of qualified staff (for example, nurses in hospitals) are 
already putting pressure on the Czech health workforce, a bottleneck further 
exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, Czechia has embarked on a reform 
process to modernize and centralize specialized tertiary care and psychiatric 
care. Patients enjoy free choice of primary and specialized outpatient 
providers, though there are signs that accessibility is limited in some regions 
and for some specialties. Overall, health outcomes in terms of life expectancy, 
mortality and survival rates of stroke and cancer have improved in recent years, 
though these improvements have been slower in Czechia than in other countries. 
However, life expectancy dropped considerably due to heightened mortality 
resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. There remains 
considerable room for improvement in strengthening disease prevention and health 
promotion, particularly for dietary habits and health literacy. Various efforts 
to advance evidence-based interventions in the health system, such as the 
initiation of health care quality monitoring and health system performance 
assessment, will assist in further analysing Czechia's health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The present study reported the cancer deaths and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) that were attributable to high fasting plasma glucose (HFPG) 
in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region by country, age, sex, cancer 
type and Socio-demographic Index (SDI), from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 data were used to report the 
cancer-related deaths and DALYs that were attributable to HFPG, for all MENA 
countries over the period 1990-2019. The results were presented as numbers, 
population attributable fractions (PAFs) and rates (per 100,000) with 95% 
uncertainty intervals.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were an estimated 19.8 thousand (5.5-40.2) cancer deaths 
attributable to HFPG in MENA, which represents 4.7% (1.3-9.3) of all 
cancer-related deaths. The number of regional DALYs due to HFPG-related cancers 
was 462.2 thousand (127.3-959.5), which represents 3.8% (1.1-7.6) of all 
cancer-related DALYs in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized DALY rate 
of cancers attributable to HFPG (per 100,000) grew from 56.3 (14.6-121.1) to 
107.0 (29.8-220.8), which was a 90.1% (64.4-127.8) increase. In 2019, the 
highest age-standardized DALY rate of cancers attributable to HFPG was in Qatar 
(270.4) and the lowest was in Sudan (75.3). The DALY rate of cancers 
attributable to HFPG increased with age, peaking for males in the 70-74 age 
group and for females in the 75-79 age group, and then decreased for both sexes. 
A broadly positive relationship was found between the national SDI and the 
national age-standardized DALY rate of all cancers attributable to FPG over the 
measurement period.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of HFPG-related cancers has increased over the past 
three decades in MENA, and was higher than the global average in multiple age 
groups. Implementing a battery of preventive measures and therapeutic 
interventions is suggested to address the adverse effects of this modifiable 
risk factor.

OBJECTIVES: This article aimed to examine the effects of social connection 
comprising loneliness and social isolation on cognitive impairment-free life 
expectancy (CIFLE).
METHODS: Data on 28,563 older adults (aged 65+) were drawn from the Chinese 
Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey with a median follow-up of 4.00 years. 
Multistate Markov models were used to estimate the independent and joint effects 
of social connection with CIFLE. Cognitive impairment was measured by the 
modified Mini-Mental State Examination.
RESULTS: For men and women, respectively, reduced CIFLEs at age 65 associated 
with loneliness were 0.95 (95% CI: 0.41-1.48) and 1.35 (95%: CI 0.77-1.90) 
years, and those associated with social isolation were 2.23 (95% CI: 1.67-2.78) 
and 2.49 (95% CI: 1.67-3.30) years. Compared with those with neither loneliness 
nor social isolation ('neither' group), older adults at age 65 with both 
loneliness and social isolation ('both group') lost CIFLEs of 2.68 (95% CI: 
1.89-3.48) and 3.51 (95% CI, 2.55-4.47) years for men and women, respectively. 
Similar patterns were observed in the oldest-old adults (age 85 or over). A 
growth trend transpired in the difference of the proportion of the remaining 
CIFLE between 'neither' group and 'both' group with age.
CONCLUSION: Loneliness and social isolation are associated with decreased CIFLE 
in older Chinese adults. Policy makers and the public must be informed that 
early identification and management of loneliness and social isolation, 
especially when coexisting, are crucial.

The European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO), the International 
Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD), the European College for 
the Study of Vulval Disease (ECSVD), and the European Federation for Colposcopy 
(EFC) developed consensus statements on pre-invasive vulvar lesions in order to 
improve the quality of care for patients with vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia 
(VaIN). The management of VaIN varies according to the grade of the lesion: VaIN 
1 (low grade vaginal squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL)) can be subjected to 
follow-up, while VaIN 2-3 (high-grade vaginal SIL) should be treated. Treatment 
needs individualization according to the patient's characteristics, disease 
extension and previous therapeutic procedures. Surgical excision is the mainstay 
of treatment and should be performed if invasion cannot be excluded. Total 
vaginectomy is used only in highly selected cases of extensive and persistent 
disease. Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser may be used as both an ablation method and 
an excisional one. Reported cure rates after laser excision and laser ablation 
are similar. Topical agents are useful for persistent, multifocal lesions or for 
patients who cannot undergo surgical treatment. Imiquimod was associated with 
the lowest recurrence rate, highest human papillomavirus (HPV) clearance, and 
can be considered the best topical approach. Trichloroacetic acid and 
5-fluorouracil are historical options and should be discouraged. For VaIN after 
hysterectomy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3, laser vaporization 
and topical agents are not the best options, since they cannot reach epithelium 
buried in the vaginal scar. In these cases surgical options are preferable. 
Brachytherapy has a high overall success rate but due to late side effects 
should be reserved for poor surgical candidates, having multifocal disease, and 
with failed prior treatments. VaIN tends to recur and ensuring patient adherence 
to close follow-up visits is of the utmost importance. The first evaluation 
should be performed at 6 months with cytology and an HPV test during 2 years and 
annually thereafter. The implementation of vaccination against HPV infection is 
expected to contribute to the prevention of VaIN and thus cancer of the vagina. 
The effects of treatment can have an impact on quality of life and result in 
psychological and psychosexual issues which should be addressed. Patients with 
VaIN need clear and up-to-date information on a range of treatment options 
including risks and benefits, as well as the need for follow-up and the risk of 
recurrence.

PURPOSE: Symptom control for patients who were severely ill or dying from 
COVID-19 was paramount while resources were strained and infection control 
measures were in place. We aimed to describe the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 
infected patients who received specialized palliative care (SPC) and the type of 
SPC provided in a larger cohort.
METHODS: From the multi-centre cohort study Lean European Open Survey on 
SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (LEOSS), data of patients hospitalized with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection documented between July 2020 and October 2021 were 
analysed.
RESULTS: 273/7292 patients (3.7%) received SPC. Those receiving SPC were older 
and suffered more often from comorbidities, but 59% presented with an estimated 
life expectancy > 1 year. Main symptoms were dyspnoea, delirium, and excessive 
tiredness. 224/273 patients (82%) died during the hospital stay compared to 
789/7019 (11%) without SPC. Symptom control was provided most common (223/273; 
95%), followed by family and psychological support (50% resp. 43%). Personal 
contact with friends or relatives before or during the dying phase was more 
often documented in patients receiving SPC compared to patients without SPC (52% 
vs. 30%).
CONCLUSION: In 3.7% of SARS-CoV-2 infected hospitalized patients, the burden of 
the acute infection triggered palliative care involvement. Besides complex 
symptom management, SPC professionals also focused on psychosocial and family 
issues and aimed to enable personal contacts of dying patients with their 
family. The data underpin the need for further involvement of SPC in SARS-CoV-2 
infected patients but also in other severe chronic infectious diseases.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
manufacturer (Eli Lilly) of abemaciclib (Verzenios) to submit evidence for the 
clinical and cost effectiveness of this drug in combination with endocrine 
therapy (ET) for the treatment of adult patients with hormone receptor 
(HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, 
node-positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence, as part of the 
Institute's Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process. Kleijnen Systematic 
Reviews Ltd, in combination with Newcastle University, was commissioned to act 
as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper summarised the 
Company Submission (CS), presents the ERG's critical review of the clinical and 
cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS, highlights the key methodological 
considerations, and describes the development of the NICE guidance by the 
Appraisal Committee. The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the 
clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS and also independently 
searched for relevant evidence and modified the manufacturer decision analytic 
model to examine the impact of altering some of the key assumptions. A 
systematic literature review identified the MonarchE trial, an ongoing, 
open-label, randomised, double blind trial involving 5637 people comparing 
abemaciclib in combination with ET versus ET alone. The trial included two 
cohorts that used different inclusion criteria to define high risk of 
recurrence. The ERG considered Cohort 1 as an adequate representation of this 
population and the AC concluded that Cohort 1 was generalisable to National 
Health Service clinical practice. Trial results showed improvements in invasive 
disease-free survival for the abemaciclib arm, which was considered an 
appropriate surrogate outcome. The ERG believed that the modelling structure 
presented in the de novo economic model by the company was appropriate but 
highlighted several areas of uncertainty that had the potential to have a 
significant impact on the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). 
Areas of uncertainty included the extrapolation of long-term survival curves, 
the duration of treatment effect and treatment waning, and the proportion of 
patients who receive other CDK4/6 treatments for metastatic disease after 
receiving abemaciclib. ICER estimates were £9164 per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained for the company's base-case and £17,810 for the ERG's base-case. NICE 
recommended abemaciclib with ET as an option for the adjuvant treatment of 
HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-positive early breast cancer at high risk of 
recurrence.

Polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) is typically performed to produce 
polymer nanoparticles featuring specific assembly morphologies. Herein, we 
demonstrate the use of PISA as a synthetic tool to direct gradient copolymer 
synthesis. Specifically, we leverage hydrophobicity-induced reaction selectivity 
and the rate acceleration typically associated with polymer compartmentalization 
upon assembly during PISA to bias reaction selectivity. In the chain extension 
of a poly(ethylene glycol) macrochain transfer agent, the selectivity of 
diacetone acrylamide (DAAm) and N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA), two monomers with 
near-identical reactivity in water, can be modulated in situ such that DAAm is 
preferentially incorporated over DMA upon self-assembly. By increasing the feed 
ratio of DAAm, monomer differentiation can be further biased toward DAAm due to 
the locus of polymerization becoming increasingly hydrophobic. This change in 
selectivity affords the autonomous generation of DAAm-DMA gradient sequences, 
otherwise inaccessible without outside intervention. Finally, a mild hydrolysis 
protocol can then be employed to harvest DAAm-DMA sequences, yielding 
compositionally unique gradient copolymers.

Lung cancer is a common malignant tumor disease with high clinical disability 
and death rates. Currently, lung cancer diagnosis mainly relies on manual 
pathology section analysis, but the low efficiency and subjective nature of 
manual film reading can lead to certain misdiagnoses and omissions. With the 
continuous development of science and technology, artificial intelligence (AI) 
has been gradually applied to imaging diagnosis. Although there are reports on 
AI-assisted lung cancer diagnosis, there are still problems such as small sample 
size and untimely data updates. Therefore, in this study, a large amount of 
recent data was included, and meta-analysis was used to evaluate the value of AI 
for lung cancer diagnosis. With the help of STATA16.0, the value of AI-assisted 
lung cancer diagnosis was assessed by specificity, sensitivity, negative 
likelihood ratio, positive likelihood ratio, diagnostic ratio, and plotting the 
working characteristic curves of subjects. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis 
were used to investigate the value of AI-assisted lung cancer diagnosis. The 
results of the meta-analysis showed that the combined sensitivity of the 
AI-aided diagnosis system for lung cancer diagnosis was 0.87 [95% CI (0.82, 
0.90)], specificity was 0.87 [95% CI (0.82, 0.91)] (CI stands for confidence 
interval.), the missed diagnosis rate was 13%, the misdiagnosis rate was 13%, 
the positive likelihood ratio was 6.5 [95% CI (4.6, 9.3)], the negative 
likelihood ratio was 0.15 [95% CI (0.11, 0.21)], a diagnostic ratio of 43 [95% 
CI (24, 76)] and a sum of area under the combined subject operating 
characteristic (SROC) curve of 0.93 [95% CI (0.91, 0.95)]. Based on the results, 
the AI-assisted diagnostic system for CT (Computerized Tomography), imaging has 
considerable diagnostic accuracy for lung cancer diagnosis, which is of 
significant value for lung cancer diagnosis and has greater feasibility of 
realizing the extension application in the field of clinical diagnosis.

Nowadays, HIV infection is largely considered as a chronic condition rather than 
a deadly disease, given that effective antiretroviral treatment allows almost 
complete and persistent suppression of viral replication and restoration of 
nearly normal CD4+ T-cell counts. Being HIV a "condition", we imply that other 
illnesses are more frequently seen in persons living with HIV (PLHIV), among 
which mental health disorders are particularly common. Despite very successful 
antiretroviral therapy, HIV infection may still cause a wide range of 
neurocognitive dysfunctions and accelerated brain ageing. Beyond direct viral 
effects, at least another five causes of neurological damage are more frequent 
among PLHIV. First, the use of neurochemical substances as sexual boosters 
(chemsex) has become popular in this population. Second, the rate of sexually 
transmitted infections as syphilis, which may affect the central nervous system, 
is more prevalent among PLHIV. Third, the use of certain antiretroviral drugs, 
such as efavirenz, has been associated with changes in mood and/or psychotic 
symptoms. Fourth, an increased rate of mental disorders has been reported in 
PLHIV, either as predisposing conditions or following the recognition of HIV 
diagnosis (i.e., major depression). Finally, psychosocial factors such as 
loneliness, isolation and stigmatization are more frequent in PLHIV and worsen 
their mental health. Given that the life expectancy of PLHIV has increased 
significantly, a new and much broader spectrum of psychiatric disorders has 
emerged in PLHIV. Early diagnosis and adequate management, including education 
and preventative interventions are warranted.

As a devastating disease, breast cancer has been responsible for decrease in 
life expectancy of females and its morbidity and mortality are high. Breast 
cancer is the most common tumor in females and its treatment has been based on 
employment of surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The changes in 
biological behavior of breast tumor relies on genomic and epigenetic mutations 
and depletions as well as dysregulation of molecular mechanisms that autophagy 
is among them. Autophagy function can be oncogenic in increasing tumorigenesis, 
and when it has pro-death function, it causes reduction in viability of tumor 
cells. The carcinogenic function of autophagy in breast tumor is an impediment 
towards effective therapy of patients, as it can cause drug resistance and 
radio-resistance. The important hallmarks of breast tumor such as glucose 
metabolism, proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis can be regulated by 
autophagy. Oncogenic autophagy can inhibit apoptosis, while it promotes stemness 
of breast tumor. Moreover, autophagy demonstrates interaction with tumor 
microenvironment components such as macrophages and its level can be regulated 
by anti-tumor compounds in breast tumor therapy. The reasons of considering 
autophagy in breast cancer therapy is its pleiotropic function, dual role 
(pro-survival and pro-death) and crosstalk with important molecular mechanisms 
such as apoptosis. Moreover, current review provides a pre-clinical and clinical 
evaluation of autophagy in breast tumor.

Comment in
    Lancet HIV. 2023 May;10(5):e275-e276.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of people with HIV taking antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) has increased substantially over the past 25 years. Most previous studies 
of life expectancy were based on data from the first few years after starting 
ART, when mortality is highest. However, many people with HIV have been 
successfully treated with ART for many years, and up-to-date prognosis data are 
needed. We aimed to estimate life expectancy in adults with HIV on ART for at 
least 1 year in Europe and North America from 2015 onwards.
METHODS: We used data for people with HIV taking ART from the Antiretroviral 
Therapy Cohort Collaboration and the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort Study. Included 
participants started ART between 1996 and 2014 and had been on ART for at least 
1 year by 2015, or started ART between 2015 and 2019 and survived for at least 1 
year; all participants were aged at least 16 years at ART initiation. We used 
Poisson models to estimate the associations between mortality and demographic 
and clinical characteristics, including CD4 cell count at the start of 
follow-up. We also estimated the remaining years of life left for people with 
HIV aged 40 years who were taking ART, and stratified these estimates by 
variables associated with mortality. These estimates were compared with 
estimates for years of life remaining in a corresponding multi-country general 
population.
FINDINGS: Among 206 891 people with HIV included, 5780 deaths were recorded 
since 2015. We estimated that women with HIV at age 40 years had 35·8 years (95% 
CI 35·2-36·4) of life left if they started ART before 2015, and 39·0 years 
(38·5-39·5) left if they started ART after 2015. For men with HIV, the 
corresponding estimates were 34·5 years (33·8-35·2) and 37·0 (36·5-37·6). Women 
with CD4 counts of fewer than 49 cells per μL at the start of follow-up had an 
estimated 19·4 years (18·2-20·5) of life left at age 40 years if they started 
ART before 2015 and 24·9 years (23·9-25·9) left if they started ART after 2015. 
The corresponding estimates for men were 18·2 years (17·1-19·4) and 23·7 years 
(22·7-24·8). Women with CD4 counts of at least 500 cells per μL at the start of 
follow-up had an estimated 40·2 years (39·7-40·6) of life left at age 40 years 
if they started ART before 2015 and 42·0 years (41·7-42·3) left if they started 
ART after 2015. The corresponding estimates for men were 38·0 years (37·5-38·5) 
and 39·2 years (38·7-39·7).
INTERPRETATION: For people with HIV on ART and with high CD4 cell counts who 
survived to 2015 or started ART after 2015, life expectancy was only a few years 
lower than that in the general population, irrespective of when ART was started. 
However, for people with low CD4 counts at the start of follow-up,
