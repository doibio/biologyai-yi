BACKGROUND: Composite chest wall reconstruction, following the assurance of 
chest wall stability, often requires well-vascularized soft tissue coverage with 
flaps to insure adequate wound healing. Unfortunately, prior surgical approaches 
such as the posterolateral thoractomy incision or extensive wound breakdown may 
impede the availability of local or regional choices. A free flap would then be 
a reasonable option, but in the unstable patient a new donor site is 
unreasonable. Instead, the otherwise inadequate muscle remnants often transected 
by the usual thoracotomy incision can be extended by microvascular grafts to 
provide the necessary reach to the defect.
METHOD: The ipsilateral cephalic latissimus dorsi and/or serratus anterior 
muscle remnants following their transection by a posterolateral thoractomy 
incision can be simultaneously raised as a chimeric flap pedicled in common by 
the thoracodorsal vessels. The distance the pedicle must be extended to reach 
the defect requiring coverage is measured, and a vascular graft from the 
descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral vessels of the same length 
is harvested. The thoracodorsal vessels are divided, the vascular graft inserted 
and anastomosed end-to-end to the cut ends of the former, and then the flap can 
be stretched the required distance for insetting.
RESULT: A case example of use of the ipsilateral latissimus dorsi-serratus 
anterior muscle remnants used after extension with arterial and venous grafts to 
the thoracodorsal vessels as the recipient site is presented with successful 
salvage of a life-threatening posteriolateral thoractomy wound dehiscence.
CONCLUSION: Transection of muscles from a posterolateral thoracotomy incision 
does not preclude their use as flaps in extenuating circumstances. Their pedicle 
can be extended using vascular grafts and microvascular techniques in a sense to 
create a local free flap to provide another solution to a challenging problem.

BACKGROUND: Craftsmen and workers in the construction industry are at an 
increased risk of developing gonarthrosis due to their work-related burdens. In 
order to maintain the ability to work, occupational co-operative measures for 
secondary prevention can be carried out (BG Bau/Kniekolleg). The aim was to 
evaluate the efficacy after 2 years, depending on the degree of exercise 
adherence.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a repeated measurement design (T1 before, T2 after knee 
school, T3 after 1 year, T4 after 2 years), 140 construction patients were 
assessed for their dynamic muscular strength (knee extension, 60°/s,); their 
quality of life (SF-36) and characteristics for gonarthrosis (WOMAC) were 
evaluated using analyses of variances, whereby one group trained after the knee 
training in the gym with instruction (Gr. 1 n = 63), one group completed 
a home-training program (Gr. 2 n = 38), and one group completed exercises 
outside of knee school (Gr.3 n = 39).
RESULTS: For all parameters, significant acute efficacy and 2‑year 
sustainability effects were observed (p ≤ 0.05, d: 0.2-0.8). There was no 
interaction with adherence during training after knee school (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Knee school has proved to be effective in the long term, leading to 
a critical questioning of future research, why there are no differences between 
guided, reduced or even missing long-term maintenance training.

Psoriatic disease is a multifaceted disorder, which develops in the skin, its 
appendages and joints. Though characterized by different pathogenic background 
and clinical manifestations, skin plaque psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis 
(PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are related, sharing key inflammatory 
mechanisms and hence mode of management. Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal 
antibody that selectively binds and neutralizes interleukin-17A. It has been 
approved for use as a subcutaneous injection for the treatment of 
moderate-to-severe PsO, PsA and AS. The current review highlights the long-term 
efficacy and safety profile of secukinumab in the treatment of plaque psoriasis 
and its multiple manifestations from its phase 3 clinical trial programme. The 
long-term extension of pivotal trials has shown sustainable efficacy and safety 
of secukinumab up to 5 years in PsO, PsA and AS and up to 2.5 years in 
moderate-to-severe nail and palmoplantar PsO through dedicated randomized 
controlled trials. The effect of secukinumab therapy in all these indications 
has corresponding effects on improvement in quality-of-life and daily 
activities. Overall, secukinumab is an effective and safe treatment choice for 
patients suffering from psoriatic disease in its multiple clinical variants.

The clover mite, Bryobia praetiosa Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), is an 
agricultural pest, as well as a frequent invader of hospitals and homes. 
However, its adaptability to different temperatures is not well understood. We 
used age- and stage-specific life tables to investigate the effects of 
temperature on demographic parameters of B. praetiosa from 15 to 35°C under a 
long-day photoperiod (16:8 [L:D] h). The clover mite is a thelytokous species 
(consisting of only females) due to its infection with the symbiotic bacterium 
Wolbachia. The egg-to-adult development time of female B. praetiosa decreased as 
the temperature increased from 15 to 32.5°C. At 35°C, females laid eggs, but no 
eggs hatched. The lower thermal threshold (t0) and the thermal constant (K) for 
egg-to-adult females were 8.7°C and 274.1 degree-days, respectively. The 
intrinsic optimum temperature (TØ) was 22.4°C. The oviposition period decreased 
with increasing temperature. Fecundity was highest at 20°C and extremely low at 
30°C. The net reproductive rate (R0) decreased as the temperature increased from 
15 to 30°C, but no significant difference was observed between 15 and 20°C. The 
intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) varied from 0.0721/d at 15°C to 0.1679/d 
at 25°C, and then decreased to 0.1203/d at 30°C. These results should be useful 
in developing management strategies for B. praetiosa.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating isolated red-red zone, 
vertical meniscal tears with either isolated meniscal repair (IMR) or partial 
meniscectomy (PM) in the young adult using conservative modeling.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov disease progression model with a 40-year 
horizon was created simulating outcomes after IMR or PM for an isolated meniscal 
tear. Event probabilities, costs, and utilities were used for the index 
procedures, and the development of osteoarthritis (OA) and subsequent need for 
knee arthroplasty were calculated or selected from the published literature. 
Differences in cost, difference in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the 
incremental cost effect ratio were calculated to determine which index procedure 
is most cost effective.
RESULTS: Total direct costs from PM were modeled at $38,648, and the total 
direct costs of IMR were $23,948, resulting in a projected cost savings of 
$14,700 with IMR. There was a modeled gain in QALYs of 17 for PM and 21 for IMR, 
resulting in an increase in 4 QALYs for the IMR treatment group. This results in 
an incremental cost effect ratio of $3,935 per QALY, favoring IMR as the 
dominant procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: Meniscal repair for isolated red-red zone, vertical meniscal tears 
was predicted to have lower direct costs and improve QALYs compared with partial 
meniscectomy over 40-year modeling, indicating isolated meniscal repair to be 
the cost-effective procedure in the treatment of an isolated meniscal tear in 
the young adult population.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3: economic and decision analysis.

Neurogenesis is the process underlying the development of the highly evolved 
central nervous system (CNS) in vertebrates. Neurogenesis takes place by 
differentiation of specific Neural Precursor Cells in the neurogenic niche. The 
main objective of this review is to highlight the specific relationship between 
the brain cavities, and neurogenesis from neural precursors. Brain cavities and 
their content, Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), establish a key relation with the 
neurogenic "niche" because of the presence in this fluid of neurogenic signals 
able to control neural precursor cell behaviour, inducing precursor 
proliferation and neuronal differentiation. This influence seems to be 
ontogenically preserved, despite the temporal and spatial variations that occur 
throughout life. In order to better understand this concept, we consider three 
main life periods in the CSF-Neurogenesis interaction: The "Embryonic" period, 
which take place at the Neural Tube stage and extends from the isolation of the 
neural tube at the end of "neurulation" to the beginning of Choroid Plexus 
activity; the "Fetal" period, which includes the remaining developmental and the 
early postnatal stages; and the "Adult" period, which continues for the rest of 
adult life. Each period has specific characteristics in respect of CSF synthesis 
and composition, and the location, extension and neurogenic activity of the 
neurogenic niche. However, CSF interaction with the neurogenic niche is a common 
factor, which should be taken into account to better understand the ontogeny of 
neuron formation and replacement, as well as its potential role in the success 
or failure of therapies for the ageing, injured or diseased brain.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of men diagnosed with prostate cancer (CaP) 
following implanted treatments for advanced heart failure. Given the 
increasingly favorable 10-year life expectancy, MedStar Washington Hospital 
Center screens heart transplant (HT) candidates for CaP and other malignancies 
prior to intervention.
METHODS: Men aged 18-90 with available pretransplant Prostate Specific Antigen 
(PSA) who underwent left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and/or HT at MedStar 
Washington Hospital Center from 2007 to 2018 were identified. Serum PSA, CaP 
diagnosis, and treatment were captured and analyzed. Survival was analyzed using 
Kaplan-Meier curves.
RESULTS: Data were available for 34 patients. Median age was 53 [IQR = 51-58]. 
Median follow-up was 77 months (95% CI = 40-87 months). Six men had postimplant 
elevated PSA (5.3; SD = 8.5) and 4 were diagnosed with CaP. Median age of CaP 
diagnosis was 59 [IQR = 58.5-62). As of 2018, 31 of the 34 patients were living, 
and none died from CaP. Five-year survival was 96% in those without CaP and 100% 
in those with CaP (Figure 2).
CONCLUSION: Our cohort represents the largest known cohort with heart failure 
treated by LVAD and/or HT and CaP. Our median age of 59 at CaP diagnosis is 
considerably younger than the national median of 66.1 Of the 4 individuals 
diagnosed with CaP, 3 had high-grade disease. Given the favorable long-term 
survival of these patients post-LVAD and/or HT, age-appropriate treatment for 
CaP should be continued postimplantation.

We estimated the effects of education on mortality and causes of death in 
Norway. We identified causal effects by exploiting the staggered implementation 
of a school reform that increased the length of compulsory education from seven 
to nine years. The municipality-level education data were combined with complete 
records of all deaths from 1960 to 2015 from the Norwegian Cause of Death 
Registry. These data covered the entire life span of persons aged 16-64. One 
additional year of education caused a reduction in mortality of about 10% for 
men. The effect was negligible for women. For men, a large part of the effect 
was due to fewer accidental deaths. We suggest two explanations for this 
finding. First, there are differences in risk-taking behaviour between people 
with a high level of education and those with a low level. Second, more 
education leads to upward occupational mobility. This mobility is mainly from 
occupations for which the risk of accidents is high to occupations for which the 
risk is low. Our results supported the fundamental cause theory. This is because 
education had a stronger effect on mortality for causes of death that are 
preventable than for causes of death that are not preventable. More education 
had no effect on the probability of dying of diseases that were amenable to 
medical intervention only. This gives some support to our results that patients 
are treated equally, independent of their level of education. This may be due to 
the large public involvement in financing and provision of health services.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the factors associated with healthy aging in a cohort of 
Mexican adults after a follow-up of 14 years.
STUDY DESIGN: Participants were part of a prospective cohort of the Mexican 
Healthy Aging Study (MHAS), from which we included 5142 individuals aged 63 
years or more.
MAIN OUTCOME: Healthy aging, defined as reaching age 77 or 90 without major 
chronic conditions or physical limitations.
MEASURES: Information on age, education, marital status, smoking, alcohol 
consumption, physical activity, self-perceived depression, health conditions and 
history of age-related diseases was collected at baseline and follow-up.
RESULTS: Among the overall cohort, 57.8% experienced healthy survival to age 77 
and 42.2% had died before age 77 or were undergoing normal aging. Participants 
with long-lived parents and who exercised had a lower risk of being non-healthy 
agers. Being overweight, obese or a smoker increased the risk of being a 
non-healthy ager. Physically active participants had increased odds of healthy 
aging at age 77 (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01-1.46) and at age 90 (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 
1.01-2.24). Depression had a negative relationship with healthy aging at age 90 
(OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.45- 0.97). Maternal longevity was associated with healthy 
aging only at age 77 (OR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.04-1.72).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the view that a combination of genetic and 
behavioral factors is associated with healthy aging. In accordance with findings 
in Caucasian populations, our data suggest for the first time that there might 
also be a genetic determinant for healthy ageing in Latin Americans.

BACKGROUND: Influenza-associated excess death occurred most in the elderly. We 
aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) 
versus trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) for prevention of influenza infection 
among elderly population in China.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to compare 1-year clinical and 
economic outcomes of three influenza vaccination options (no vaccination, TIV, 
and QIV) in a hypothetical cohort of Chinese elderly aged 69 years. Outcome 
measures included cost, influenza infection rate, influenza-related mortality 
rate, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) loss, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses 
were performed to examine the uncertainty of model inputs.
RESULTS: Base-case results showed no vaccination was dominated (more costly at 
higher QALY loss) by TIV and QIV. QIV was more costly (USD56.29 versus USD54.28) 
with lower influenza infection rate (0.608 versus 0.623), mortality rate 
(0.00199 versus 0.00204), and QALY loss (0.01213 versus 0.01243) than TIV. QIV 
was cost-effective compared to TIV with ICER of 6,700 USD/QALY below the 
willingness-to-pay threshold (29,580 USD/QALY). One-way sensitivity analysis 
found the cost-effectiveness of QIV was subject to the relative risk of vaccine 
effectiveness of QIV versus TIV, and TIV would be cost-effective if the relative 
risk was below 1.05. In 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, the probabilities of 
QIV, TIV, and no vaccination to be cost-effective were 86.3%, 13.7%, and 0%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: QIV appears to be a cost-effective option compared to TIV and no 
influenza vaccination for elderly population in China.

Massive hemorrhage from the inguinal space is an indication for the use of the 
Femostop device in the emergency department. This case report describes a 
middle-aged male with metastatic and recurrent penile cancer status post 
inguinal lymph node dissection and chemoradiation with a nonhealing left groin 
wound with extension to the femoral vessels. The patient experienced massive 
bleeding from erosion of an open wound in left groin into femoral vein requiring 
massive transfusion. Direct pressure and pressure dressings were unable to 
control the bleeding present in the patient's left groin. The Femostop device 
was applied and hemostasis was immediately achieved.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the disease burden of glaucoma in terms of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) and assess the contribution of risk 
factors to DALY due to glaucoma.
METHODS: Global, regional, and country DALY number, rate, and age-standardized 
rates of glaucoma were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 
database. The Human Development Index (HDI), Inequality-Adjusted HDI, 
Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), and other country-level data were derived from 
international open databases. Regression analysis was used to assess the 
correlations between the age-standardized DALY rate and the variables.
RESULTS: The global DALY due to glaucoma increased by 81% from 1990 to 2017 and 
decreased by 10% over the last two decades after adjusting for age and 
population size. Males had higher age-standardized DALY rates (P < 0.001). The 
age-standardized DALY rate was higher in countries with lower income or lower 
SDI (P < 0.001). The country-level age-standardized DALY rates in 2017 were 
negatively associated with HDI, SDI, country-level age-standardized prevalence 
rates of cataracts, cataract surgery rates (CRS), physician rates, and 
Inequality-Adjusted HDI. Stepwise multiple regressions showed that HDI, CRS, and 
Inequality-Adjusted HDI were significantly negatively associated with the 
country-level age-standardized DALY rate in 2017 after adjusting for other 
confounding factors (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher education, higher CRS, and diminishing the inequality in 
resource distribution may help reduce the disease burden of glaucoma. These 
findings can provide information for policymakers and could serve as an impetus 
for efforts toward alleviating the disease burden of glaucoma.

Disability has become a critical issue among elderly populations, yet limited 
large-scale research related to this issue has been conducted in China, an aging 
society. This study explored sex and urban-rural differences in disability 
transitions and life expectancies among older adults in China. Data were 
collected from the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey (CLHLS), which 
enrolled people aged 65 and older and was conducted in randomly selected 
counties and cities across 22 provinces in China. Disability was diagnosed based 
on basic activities of daily living (BADLs) and instrumental activities of daily 
living (IADLs). Several individual characteristics were assessed, including 
sociodemographic factors (age, sex and region, etc.) and health behaviors 
(currently smoking, currently drinking, etc.). Multistate models were applied to 
analyze the transition rates among 4 states: no disability, mild disability, 
severe disability and death. The transition rates from disabled states to the 
no-disability state were found to decrease markedly with age. The rates of 
recovery from mild disability in rural areas were higher than those in urban 
areas. Rural elderly individuals lived shorter lives than their urban 
counterparts, but they tended to live with better functional status, spending a 
larger fraction of their remaining life with less severe disability. Based on 
these findings, devoting more attention and resources to rural areas may help 
less severely disabled people recuperate and prevent severe disability. The 
study provides insights into health plan strategies to help guide the allocation 
of limited resources.

The population of adults with congenital heart disease is now an estimated 1.4 
million in the United States alone and growing. Unfortunately, survival to 
adulthood does not equate to a normal life expectancy, and heart failure (HF) 
has now emerged as the leading cause of death for the adult congenital heart 
disease (ACHD) patient. As this population continues to grow in number and 
advance in age, the prevalence of heart failure in the adult with congenital 
heart disease (ACHD-HF) will undoubtedly continue to increase. However, much of 
our current understanding of mechanism, diagnosis, and management of ACHD-HF 
remains limited. We aim to review the current understanding of the proposed 
definitions, mechanisms, clinical impact, and general management considerations 
of ACHD-HF while also recognizing the large number of knowledge gaps that 
persist.

BACKGROUND: Innovations in hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy included in 
traditional comparative evaluations focus on sustained virologic response (SVR) 
without addressing challenges patients report beyond virologic cure. This study 
aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HCV drug therapy with a 
patient-centered approach.
METHODS: An individual-based Markov model was constructed using guidance from a 
stakeholder advisory board (SAB), a patient Delphi panel, and published 
literature to evaluate direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) compared to no treatment. 
The United States (US) health sector and societal perspectives were considered 
for 10- and 20-year time horizons. Inputs for treatment costs and effectiveness 
reflect a generic regimen. Indirect costs used for the societal model included 
estimates from self-reported productivity in a matched-control sample. Beyond 
the traditional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) health outcome, this study 
included two novel measures developed from the Delphi panel and SAB: infected 
life-years and workdays missed. All costs were measured in 2018 US dollars.
RESULTS: Health sector costs and QALYs were higher in the treatment group in 
both 10- and 20-year models. Total infected life-years and workdays missed were 
reduced in the treatment group for both models. When costs of absenteeism, 
presenteeism, and patient/caregiver time were included, the DAA intervention was 
cost-saving at both 10 and 20 years. Health sector results were sensitive to 
drug costs and utility estimates for post-SVR health states. Societal results 
were sensitive to presenteeism estimates and drug costs.
CONCLUSION: Treatment was cost-effective from a health sector perspective and 
cost-saving when including non-health costs such as patient/caregiver time and 
productivity.

During the 2015-2016 school year, the Florida Department of Health in Duval 
County hosted Teen Health Centers (TeenHC) at five high schools of Jacksonville 
providing HIV/STD screening and pregnancy testing. The purpose of this study was 
to assess the cost-effectiveness of the TeenHC chlamydia screening program and 
determine at what student participation level, the program can be 
cost-effective. We assessed the costs and effectiveness of the chlamydia 
screening program compared with "no TeenHC". Cost-effectiveness was measured as 
cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. At a program cost of 
US$61,001 and 3% participation rate, the cost/QALY gained was $124,328 in the 
base-case analysis and $81,014-$264,271 in 95% of the simulation trials, all 
greater than the frequently citied $50,000/QALY benchmark. The cost/QALY gained 
could be <$50,000/QALY if student participation rate was >7%. The TeenHC 
chlamydia screening has the potential to be cost-effective. Future program 
efforts should focus on improving student participation.

Insulin detemir is a lipidated insulin analogue that obtains a half-life 
extension by oligomerization and reversible binding to human serum albumin. In 
the present study, the complex between a detemir hexamer and albumin is 
investigated by an integrative approach combining molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations, molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) free 
energy calculations, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments. Recent 
reported small-angle X-ray scattering data could not unambiguously resolve the 
exact binding site of detemir on albumin. We therefore applied MD simulations to 
deduce the binding site and key protein-protein interactions. MD simulations 
were started from initial complex structures based on the SAXS models, and free 
energies of binding were estimated from the simulations by using the MM-PBSA 
approach for the different binding positions. The results suggest that the 
overlapping FA3-FA4 binding site (named FA4) is the most favorable site with a 
calculated free energy of binding of -28 ± 6 kcal/mol and a good fit to the 
reported SAXS data throughout the simulations. Multiple salt bridges, hydrogen 
bonds, and favorable van der Waals interactions are observed in the binding 
interface that promote complexation. The binding to FA4 is further supported by 
DLS competition experiments with the prototypical FA4 ligand, ibuprofen, showing 
displacement of detemir by ibuprofen. This study provides information on 
albumin-detemir binding on a molecular level, which could be utilized in a 
rational design of future lipidated albumin-binding peptides.

To provide comprehensive estimates of the global, regional, and national burden 
of infertility from 1990 to 2017, using findings from a 2017 study on the global 
burden of disease (GBD), we assessed the burden of infertility in 195 countries 
and territories from 1990 to 2017. DisMod-MR 2.1 is a Bayesian meta-regression 
method that estimates non-fatal outcomes using sparse and heterogeneous 
epidemiological data. Globally, the age-standardized prevalence rate of 
infertility increased by 0.370% per year for females and 0.291% per year for 
males from 1990 to 2017. Additionally, age-standardized disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) of infertility increased by 0.396% per year for females and 
0.293% per year for males during the observational period. An increasing trend 
to these burden estimates was observed throughout the all socio-demographic 
index (SDI) countries. Interestingly, we found that high SDI countries had the 
lowest level of prevalence and DALYs in both genders. However, the largest 
increasing trend was observed in high-SDI countries for females. By contrast, 
low-SDI countries had the largest increasing trend in males. Negative 
associations were observed between these burden estimates and the SDI level. The 
global disease burden of infertility has been increasing throughout the period 
from 1990 to 2017.

BACKGROUND: Once a canine rabies-free status has been achieved, there is little 
guidance available on vaccination standards to maintain that status. In areas 
with risk of reintroduction, it may be practical to continue vaccinating 
portions of susceptible dogs to prevent re-establishment of canine rabies.
METHODS: We used a modified version of RabiesEcon, a deterministic mathematical 
model, to evaluate the potential impacts and cost-effectiveness of preventing 
the reintroduction of canine rabies through proactive dog vaccination. We 
analyzed four scenarios to simulate varying risk levels involving the 
reintroduction of canine rabies into an area where it is no longer present. In a 
sensitivity analysis, we examined the influences of reintroduction frequency and 
intensity, the density of susceptible dog population, dog birth rate, dog life 
expectancy, vaccine efficacy, rate of loss of vaccine immunity, and the basic 
reproduction number (R0).
RESULTS: To prevent the re-establishment of canine rabies, it is necessary to 
vaccinate 38% to 56% of free-roaming dogs that have no immunity to rabies. These 
coverage levels were most sensitive to adjustments in R0 followed by the vaccine 
efficacy and the rate of loss of vaccine immunity. Among the various preventive 
vaccination strategies, it was most cost-effective to continue dog vaccination 
at the minimum coverage required, with the average cost per human death averted 
ranging from $257 to $398 USD.
CONCLUSIONS: Without strong surveillance systems, rabies-free countries are 
vulnerable to becoming endemic when incursions happen. To prevent this, it may 
be necessary to vaccinate at least 38% to 56% of the susceptible dog population 
depending on the risk of reintroduction and transmission dynamics.

BACKGROUND: Behavior problems are common among children and place a high disease 
and financial burden on individuals and society. Parenting interventions are 
commonly used to prevent such problems, but little is known about their possible 
longer-term economic benefits. This study modelled the longer-term 
cost-effectiveness of five parenting interventions delivered in a Swedish 
context: Comet, Connect, the Incredible Years (IY), COPE, bibliotherapy, and a 
waitlist control, for the prevention of persistent behavior problems.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed and used to forecast the cost 
per averted disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) by each parenting intervention 
and the waitlist control, for children aged 5-12 years. Age-specific cohorts 
were modelled until the age of 18. Educational and health care sector costs 
related to behavior problems were included. Active interventions were compared 
to the waitlist control as well as to each other.
RESULTS: Intervention costs ranged between US$ 14 (bibliotherapy) to US$ 1,300 
(IY) per child, with effects of up to 0.23 averted DALYs per child (IY). All 
parenting interventions were cost-effective at a threshold of US$ 15,000 per 
DALY in relation to the waitlist control. COPE and bibliotherapy strongly 
dominated the other options, and an additional US$ 2,629 would have to be 
invested in COPE to avert one extra DALY, in comparison to bibliotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Parenting interventions are cost-effective in the longer run in 
comparison to a waitlist control. Bibliotherapy or COPE are the most efficient 
options when comparing interventions to one another. Optimal decision for 
investment should to be based on budget considerations and priority settings.

There are no FDA licensed vaccines or therapeutics for Venezuelan equine 
encephalitis virus (VEEV) which causes a debilitating acute febrile illness in 
humans that can progress to encephalitis. Previous studies demonstrated that 
murine and macaque monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide prophylactic and 
therapeutic efficacy against VEEV peripheral and aerosol challenge in mice. 
Additionally, humanized versions of two neutralizing mAbs specific for the E2 
glycoprotein, 1A3B-7 and 1A4A-1, administered singly protected mice against 
aerosolized VEEV. However, no studies have demonstrated protection in nonhuman
