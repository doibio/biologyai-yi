Taking into account the benign nature of craniopharyngiomas, the main method of 
treatment is the resection of the tumor. However, the tendency of these tumors 
to invade critical structures (such as optic pathways, the 
hypothalamic-pituitary system, the Willis circle vessels) often limits the 
possibility of a radical surgery.Craniopharyngiomas of the third ventricle 
represent the greatest challenge for surgery. After radical surgery, 
hypothalamic disorders often occur, including not only obesity but also 
cognitive, emotional, mental, and metabolic disturbances. Metabolic disorders 
associated with damage to the hypothalamus progress after surgery and lead to 
impaired functions of the internal organs. This process is irreversible and, in 
many cases, becomes the direct cause of mortality. The life expectancy of 
patients with the surgically affected hypothalamus is significantly shorter than 
in patients with preserved diencephalic function. The incidence of hypothalamic 
disorders after surgery can reach 40%.Even with macroscopically total resection, 
craniopharyngiomas can recur in 10-30% of cases, and in the presence of tumor 
remnants and with no further radiation treatment, the risk of recurrence 
significantly increases to up to 50-85% according to various studies. For this 
reason, the observation of patients with residual tumors after surgery is an 
incorrect strategy.Radiation therapy significantly improves progression-free 
survival (PFS), and the use of stereotactic irradiation techniques ensures 
conformity of irradiation of tumor remnants with a complicated shape and 
location (Iwata H et al., J Neurooncol 106(3):571-577, 2012; Aggarwal et al., 
Pituitary 16(1):26-33, 2013; Savateev et al., Zh Vopr Neirokhir Im N N Burdenko 
81(3):94-106; 2017), which potentially reduces the risk of undesirable 
postradiation effects. Therefore, the quality of life in patients with 
craniopharyngiomas infiltrating the hypothalamus is significantly higher after 
non-radical operations with subsequent stereotactic radiation than after a total 
or subtotal removal.

Spinal instrumentation for adult spinal deformity dates back to the surgical 
correction of secondary complications from infectious processes, such as Pott's 
disease and poliomyelitis [1]. With the population aging at a longer life 
expectancy today, advanced degenerative spinal diseases and idiopathic scoliosis 
supersede as the most common causes of adult spinal deformity. Correction of the 
thoracolumbar malignment, specifically, has rapidly evolved with the burgeoning 
success of spinal instrumentation. The objective of this chapter is to review 
the metamorphosis of operative principles for adult thoracolumbar deformity, 
from aggressive osteotomies in the posterior bony elements to minimally invasive 
surgery (MIS) at the intervertebral disc space.

BACKGROUND: Calculating the disease burden due to injury is complex, as it 
requires many methodological choices. Until now, an overview of the 
methodological design choices that have been made in burden of disease (BoD) 
studies in injury populations is not available. The aim of this systematic 
literature review was to identify existing injury BoD studies undertaken across 
Europe and to comprehensively review the methodological design choices and 
assumption parameters that have been made to calculate years of life lost (YLL) 
and years lived with disability (YLD) in these studies.
METHODS: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, Google Scholar, and Web 
of Science, and the grey literature supplemented by handsearching, for BoD 
studies. We included injury BoD studies that quantified the BoD expressed in 
YLL, YLD, and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in countries within the 
European Region between early-1990 and mid-2021.
RESULTS: We retrieved 2,914 results of which 48 performed an injury-specific BoD 
assessment. Single-country independent and Global Burden of Disease (GBD)-linked 
injury BoD studies were performed in 11 European countries. Approximately 79% of 
injury BoD studies reported the BoD by external cause-of-injury. Most 
independent studies used the incidence-based approach to calculate YLDs. About 
half of the injury disease burden studies applied disability weights (DWs) 
developed by the GBD study. Almost all independent injury studies have 
determined YLL using national life tables.
CONCLUSIONS: Considerable methodological variation across independent injury BoD 
assessments was observed; differences were mainly apparent in the design choices 
and assumption parameters towards injury YLD calculations, implementation of 
DWs, and the choice of life table for YLL calculations. Development and use of 
guidelines for performing and reporting of injury BoD studies is crucial to 
enhance transparency and comparability of injury BoD estimates across Europe and 
beyond.

BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 has alerted governments around the world, 
including Australia, to think seriously about the health issues. Life expectancy 
is one of such issues. Therefore, this study tries to reveal the effects of 
globalization, energy consumption, information and communication technology, 
financial development, education rate, and economic growth on life expectancy at 
birth in Australia.
METHODS: Using the data period of 1990-2018, a series of econometric techniques: 
the Dickey-Fuller generalized least square test, Autoregressive Distributive Lag 
bounds test, fully modified ordinary least square method and the pairwise 
Granger causality test, are applied.
RESULTS: The findings disclose that globalization, renewable energy use, 
information and communication technology, per capita gross domestic product, 
education rate, and financial development increased during this period but 
non-renewable energy use reduced life expectancy at birth. Unidirectional causal 
associations of the studied variables with life expectancy at birth are also 
revealed.
CONCLUSIONS: All the outcomes are relevant and useful for articulating an 
innovative policy in the health sector. The prime policy implication of this 
work is: the effective, efficient, and inclusive policies considering 
globalization, renewable and non-renewable energy consumption, information and 
communication technology, financial development, education rate, and economic 
growth should be formulated and executed for guaranteeing health status.

We investigated the probiotic potential of a microencapsulated Enterococcus 
faecium ABRIINW.N7 for control of Streptococcus agalactiae infection in hybrid 
(Oreochromis niloticus × Oreochromis mossambicus) red tilapia. A two-phase 
experiment approach was completed in which E. faecium bacteria were propagated, 
from which a culture was isolated, identified using molecular techniques, and 
microencapsulated to produce a stable commercial fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and 
fenugreek (Fk) product of optimal concentration. The FOS and Fk products were 
assessed in a 90-days in vivo challenge study, in which red hybrid tilapia were 
allocated to one of five treatments: (1) No Streptococcus agalactiae (Sa) 
challenge (CON); (2) Sa challenge only (CON+); (3) Sa challenge in a free cell 
(Free Cell); (4) Sa challenge with 0.8% (w/v) Alginate; (5) Microencapsulated 
FOS and Fk. In vitro results showed high encapsulation efficiency (≥98.6 ± 0.7%) 
and acceptable viability of probiotic bacteria within the simulated fish 
digestive system and high stability of viable cells in all gel formulations (34 
< SR% <63). In vivo challenges demonstrated that the FOS and Fk products could 
be used to control S. agalactiae infection in tilapia fish and represented a 
novel investigation using microencapsulation E. faecium as a probiotic diet for 
tilapia fish to control S. agalactiae infection and to lower fish mortality. It 
is recommended that local herbal gums such as 0.2% Persian gum and 0.4% Fk in 
combination with 0.8% alginate (Formulation 7) can be used as a suitable 
scaffold and an ideal matrix for the encapsulation of probiotics. These herbal 
gums as prebiotics are capable of promoting the growth of probiotic cells in the 
food environment and digestive tract.

The development of food and forage crops that flourish under saline conditions 
may be a prospective avenue for mitigating the impacts of climate change, both 
allowing biomass production under conditions of water-deficit and potentially 
expanding land-use to hitherto non-arable zones. Here, we examine responses of 
the native halophytic shrub Atriplex leucoclada to salt and drought stress using 
a factorial design, with four levels of salinity and four drought intensities 
under the arid conditions. A. leucoclada plants exhibited morphological and 
physiological adaptation to salt and water stress which had little effect on 
survival or growth. Under low salinity stress, water stress decreased the root 
length of A. leucoclada; in contrast, under highly saline conditions root length 
increased. Plant tissue total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium content 
decreased with increasing water stress under low salinity. As salt stress 
increased, detrimental effects of water deficit diminished. We found that both 
salt and water stress had increased Na+ and Cl- uptake, with both stresses 
having an additive and beneficial role in increasing ABA and proline content. We 
conclude that A. leucoclada accumulates high salt concentrations in its cellular 
vacuoles as a salinity resistance mechanism; this salt accumulation then becomes 
conducive to mitigation of water stress. Application of these mechanisms to 
other crops may improve tolerance and producitivity under salt and water stress, 
potentially improving food security.

Multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) is a highly 
incapacitating disease with a short life expectancy and symptomatic therapy is 
still limited. In this report, we presented the case of a 65-year-old woman with 
a 3-year history of severe rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait dysfunction 
alongside severe freezing of gait diagnosed with MSA-P. She underwent combined 
therapy of bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (DBS) and 
low-thoracic spinal cord stimulation (SCS). The double-blind evaluation of the 
Movement Disorder Society Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease 
Rating Scale part III and 7-m Timed Up and Go at follow-ups showed her cardinal 
parkinsonian symptoms benefit significantly from DBS stimulation, while the 
improvement of SCS was mainly embodied in lower-limb symptoms. The combined 
stimulation achieved a better improvement of motor function than either DBS or 
SCS stimulation alone. Most notably, the improvement of lower-limb symptoms was 
significantly enhanced by the combined stimulation.

Since the introduction of glucocorticoid (GC) replacement therapy, congenital 
adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is no longer a fatal disease. The development of 
neonatal screening programs and the amelioration of GC treatment strategies have 
improved significantly life expectancy in CAH patients. Thanks to these 
achievements, CAH patients are now in their adulthood, but an increased 
incidence of cardiovascular risk factors has been reported compared to general 
population in this stage of life. The aim of CAH treatment is to both prevent 
adrenal insufficiency and suppress androgen excess; in this delicate balance, 
under- as well as overtreatment might be equally harmful to long-term 
cardiovascular health. This work examines the prevalence of metabolic features 
and cardiovascular events, their correlation with hormone levels and GC 
replacement regimen in CAH patients and focuses on precocious markers to early 
detect patients at higher risk and new potential treatment approaches.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to report the incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) between 1990 and 2019 and provide predictions to 2035.
METHODS: We use estimates from Global Burden of Disease, Injuries and Risk 
Factors Study 2019 to analyse the incidence, mortality and DALYs.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were more than 209,149 incidence cases, with 
age-standardised rates (ASRs) of 2.5. Laryngeal cancer accounted for 123,356 
death cases, with ASRs of 1.5. Laryngeal cancer was also responsible for 3.26 
million (3,034,634 to 3,511,354) DALYs, with ASRs of 38.8 (36.1 to 41.8). In 
2019, Central Europe had the highest age-standardised incidence rate. At the 
national level, the highest incidence rate was observed in Mongolia. Total 
number and rate were significantly higher among males than females across all 
age groups. DALYs were attributable to Alcohol use, Smoking, Occupational 
exposure to sulfuric acid and asbestos. The age-standardised incidence rates in 
seven GBD regions and 59 countries are projected to increase between 2019 and 
2035.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the current and predicted decline in age-standardised 
incidence globally, the absolute number of estimates continue to increase. 
Prevention programmes should concentrate on modifiable risk factors, especially 
among the males across all age groups.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of 
osilodrostat, a potent oral 11β-hydroxylase inhibitor, for treating Cushing's 
disease (CD).
DESIGN/METHODS: A total of 137 adults with CD and mean 24-h urinary free 
cortisol (mUFC) > 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) received osilodrostat 
(starting dose 2 mg bid; maximum 30 mg bid) during the prospective, Phase III, 
48-week LINC 3 (NCT02180217) core study. Patients benefiting from osilodrostat 
at week 48 could enter the optional extension (ending when all patients had 
received ≥ 72 weeks of treatment or discontinued). Efficacy and safety were 
assessed for all enrolled patients from the core study baseline.
RESULTS: Median osilodrostat exposure from the core study baseline to study end 
was 130 weeks (range 1-245) and median average dose was 7.4 mg/day (range 
0.8-46.6). The reduction in mean mUFC achieved during the core was maintained 
during the extension and remained ≤ ULN. Of 106 patients, 86 (81%) patients who 
entered the extension had mUFC ≤ ULN at week 72. Improvements in 
cardiovascular/metabolic-related parameters, physical manifestations of 
hypercortisolism (fat pads, central obesity, rubor, striae, and hirsutism in 
females), and quality of life in the core study were also maintained or improved 
further during the extension. No new safety signals were reported; 15/137 
(10.9%) and 12/106 (11.3%) patients discontinued for adverse events during the 
core and extension, respectively. Mean testosterone in females decreased towards 
baseline levels during the extension.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from this large, multicentre trial show that long-term 
treatment with osilodrostat sustains cortisol normalisation alongside clinical 
benefits in most patients with CD and is well tolerated.

INTRODUCTION: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neuromuscular 
disorder and regarded as one of the most frequent genetic causes of infant 
mortality. The aim of this study is to develop a cost-effectiveness analysis of 
AVXS-101 (Onasemnogene Abeparvovec/Zolgensma®) and nusinersen (Spinraza®) for 
SMA to inform decision-making on reimbursement policies in Australia.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed with five health states to evaluate the 
costs and effects for patients with SMA Type I from a healthcare system 
perspective over a time-horizon of 100 years. The model parameters were based on 
clinical trials, parametric distributions, published literature, and Australian 
registries. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to 
appraise the uncertainties of the parameters in the model. A threshold analysis 
was conducted to estimate the cost of AVXS-101 of being cost-effective.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of AVXS-101 was 
$1,808,471 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and that of nusinersen was 
$2,772,798 per QALY, compared to standard of care, respectively. The ICER of 
AVXS-101 was $1,238,288 per QALY compared to nusinersen. The key drivers 
influencing on ICERs were costs of using treatments and utility values of 
sitting and walking independently.
CONCLUSION: Both nusinersen and AVXS-101 resulted in health benefits, but they 
were not cost-effective with a commonly used willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold 
of $50,000 per QALY. Developing high-quality clinical data and exploring 
appropriate WTP thresholds are critical for decision-making on reimbursement 
policies in the treatment of rare diseases.

Individuals differ in many ways. Most produce few offspring; a handful produce 
many. Some die early; others live to old age. It is tempting to attribute these 
differences in outcomes to differences in individual traits, and thus in the 
demographic rates experienced. However, there is more to individual variation 
than meets the eye of the biologist. Even among individuals sharing identical 
traits, life history outcomes (life expectancy and lifetime reproduction) will 
vary due to individual stochasticity, that is to chance. Quantifying the 
contributions of heterogeneity and chance is essential to understand natural 
variability. Interindividual differences vary across environmental conditions, 
hence heterogeneity and stochasticity depend on environmental conditions. We 
show that favourable conditions increase the contributions of individual 
stochasticity, and reduce the contributions of heterogeneity, to variance in 
demographic outcomes in a seabird population. The opposite is true under poor 
conditions. This result has important consequence for understanding the ecology 
and evolution of life history strategies.

INTRODUCTION: It remains unclear if fetal repair of myelomeningocele (MM) is 
associated with a greater risk of developing symptomatic dermal inclusion cysts 
(ICs) at the neural placode. We report two infants treated with fetal surgery 
who developed symptomatic IC at less than 1 year of age, and we discuss the 
current literature on symptomatic IC in children with MM.
CASE PRESENTATION: Two infants underwent fetal MM repair at 24 weeks of 
gestational age. Case 1 was born at 30 weeks and had two revisions of the MM 
wound early in life. At 8 months of age, the patient presented with meningismus 
and imaging findings of an IC, which was resected at the time of presentation. 
At 3 years of age, this patient was found to have recurrence of the IC after 
presenting with worsening bladder function and underwent repeat debulking with 
no recurrence at 6 years of age. Case 2 was born at 32 weeks of gestational age 
with uncomplicated recovery. At 8 months of age, the patient presented with 
irritability and fullness at the lumbar repair site. Imaging showed a large IC 
with restricted diffusion and extension into the subcutaneous tissue; this was 
resected completely at the time of presentation, see intraoperative photographs. 
There has been no sign of recurrence at age of 15 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Careful monitoring for IC in infancy in MM patients who have had 
fetal surgery is recommended.

INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally and has been reported in 
every known country. The effects can be felt in universities and schools, 
shifting their learning to online platforms. However, medical schools bear the 
burden of protecting students and ensuring the continuation of the education 
process. The rapid transition to online learning, coupled with the lack of 
preparation from the educational system, leads to stresses that affect students' 
academic performance, mental health and social life. Nevertheless, no review 
tried to synthesise the complete picture of the pandemic's effects. Therefore, 
this scoping review aims to identify and explore the available literature on the 
effects or impacts of the pandemic on medical students without limiting it to 
specific dimensions.
METHODS: This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews and the 
Joanna Briggs Institute manual for evidence synthesis. We examine articles 
reporting data from any country. However, only articles written in English will 
be included. For studies to be included, they must report any form of impact on 
medical students, qualitatively or quantitatively. Furthermore, the impact must 
occur within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Searches will be done on 
Medline, EMBASE, ERIC, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL and PsycInfo. After data 
extraction, we will narratively synthesise the data and explore the types of 
impacts COVID-19 has on medical students.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No formal ethical approval is required. The scoping 
review will be published in peer-reviewed journals and as conference 
presentations and summaries, wherever appropriate.
