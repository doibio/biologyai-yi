Therefore, this paper presents a new method based on a force sensor to reduce 
the impact of elastic deformation, such as tire deformation, pavement 
deformation, and wheel rim deformation. In this study, force sensors mounted on 
the wheels collect the three-dimensional dynamic force of the wheel. The 
presented method has been tested with two sets of cobblestone road loads, and 
the result shows that the load intensities imposed by the test vehicle on the 
target road are 88.3%, 91.0%, and 92.05% of the intensity of the load imposed by 
the test vehicle on a standard road in three respective dimensions. It is clear 
that the proposed method has strong potential effectiveness to be applied for 
wear detection and analysis of a special road.

BACKGROUND: Web-based interventions are effective in reducing depression. 
However, the evidence for the cost-effectiveness of these interventions is 
scarce.AimsThe aim is to assess the cost-effectiveness of a web-based 
intervention (GET.ON M.E.D.) for individuals with diabetes and comorbid 
depression compared with an active control group receiving web-based 
psychoeducation.
METHOD: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with treatment response as 
the outcome and a cost-utility analysis with quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
alongside a randomised controlled trial with 260 participants.
RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay ceiling of €5000 for a treatment response, the 
intervention has a 97% probability of being regarded as cost-effective compared 
with the active control group. If society is willing to pay €14 000 for an 
additional QALY, the intervention has a 51% probability of being cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: This web-based intervention for individuals with diabetes and 
comorbid depression demonstrated a high probability of being cost-effective 
compared with an active control group.Declaration of interestS.N., D.D.E., D.L., 
M.B. and B.F. are stakeholders of the Institute for Online Health Trainings, 
which aims to transfer scientific knowledge related to this research into 
routine healthcare.

Aging is a complex biological process affecting almost all living organisms. 
Although its detrimental effects on animals' physiology have been extensively 
documented, several aspects of the biology of aging are insufficiently 
understood. Mitochondria, the central energy producers of the cell, play vital 
roles in a wide range of cellular processes, including regulation of 
bioenergetics, calcium signaling, metabolic responses, and cell death, among 
others. Thus, proper mitochondrial function is a prerequisite for the 
maintenance of cellular and organismal homeostasis. Several mitochondrial 
quality control mechanisms have evolved to allow adaptation to different 
metabolic conditions, thereby preserving cellular homeostasis and survival. A 
tight coordination between mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial selective 
autophagy, known as mitophagy, is a common characteristic of healthy biological 
systems. The balanced interplay between these two opposing cellular processes 
dictates stress resistance, healthspan, and lifespan extension. Mitochondrial 
biogenesis and mitophagy efficiency decline with age, leading to progressive 
accumulation of damaged and/or unwanted mitochondria, deterioration of cellular 
function, and ultimately death. Several regulatory factors that contribute to 
energy homeostasis have been implicated in the development and progression of 
many pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative, metabolic, and 
cardiovascular disorders, among others. Therefore, mitophagy modulation may 
serve as a novel potential therapeutic approach to tackle age-associated 
pathologies. Here, we review the molecular signaling pathways that regulate and 
coordinate mitophagy with mitochondrial biogenesis, highlighting critical 
factors that hold promise for the development of pharmacological interventions 
toward enhancing human health and quality of life throughout aging.

Aging is an important risk factor for patients with atrial fibrillation. The 
estimated prevalence of atrial fibrillation in patients aged ≥80 years is 9-10%, 
and is associated with a four to five fold increased risk of embolic stroke, and 
with an estimated increased stroke risk of 1.45-fold per decade in aging. Older 
age is also associated with an increased risk of major bleeding with oral 
anticoagulant therapy. This review will focus on the role of oral 
anticoagulation with new oral anticoagulants, non-vitamin K antagonist in 
populations with common comorbid conditions, including age, chronic kidney 
disease, coronary artery disease, on multiple medication, and frailty. In 
patients 75 years and older, randomised trials have shown new oral 
anticoagulants to be as effective as warfarin, or in some cases superior, with 
an overall better safety profile, consistently reducing rates of intracranial 
haemorrhages. Prior to considering oral anticoagulant therapy in an elderly 
frail patient, a comprehensive assessment should be performed to include the 
risks and benefits, stroke risk, baseline kidney function, cognitive status, 
mobility and fall risk, multiple medication, nutritional status assessment, and 
life expectancy.

The idea that noncrop habitat enhances pest control and represents a win-win 
opportunity to conserve biodiversity and bolster yields has emerged as an 
agroecological paradigm. However, while noncrop habitat in landscapes 
surrounding farms sometimes benefits pest predators, natural enemy responses 
remain heterogeneous across studies and effects on pests are inconclusive. The 
observed heterogeneity in species responses to noncrop habitat may be biological 
in origin or could result from variation in how habitat and biocontrol are 
measured. Here, we use a pest-control database encompassing 132 studies and 
6,759 sites worldwide to model natural enemy and pest abundances, predation 
rates, and crop damage as a function of landscape composition. Our results 
showed that although landscape composition explained significant variation 
within studies, pest and enemy abundances, predation rates, crop damage, and 
yields each exhibited different responses across studies, sometimes increasing 
and sometimes decreasing in landscapes with more noncrop habitat but overall 
showing no consistent trend. Thus, models that used landscape-composition 
variables to predict pest-control dynamics demonstrated little potential to 
explain variation across studies, though prediction did improve when comparing 
studies with similar crop and landscape features. Overall, our work shows that 
surrounding noncrop habitat does not consistently improve pest management, 
meaning habitat conservation may bolster production in some systems and depress 
yields in others. Future efforts to develop tools that inform farmers when 
habitat conservation truly represents a win-win would benefit from increased 
understanding of how landscape effects are modulated by local farm management 
and the biology of pests and their enemies.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal condition that reduces life 
expectancy and shows a limited response to available therapies. Pirfenidone has 
been approved for treatment of IPF, but little is known about the distinct 
metabolic changes that occur in the lung upon pirfenidone administration.Here, 
we performed a proof-of-concept study using high-resolution quantitative 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation Fourier-transform ion cyclotron 
resonance mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-FTICR-MSI) to simultaneously detect, 
visualise and quantify in situ endogenous and exogenous metabolites in lungs of 
mice subjected to experimental fibrosis and human patients with IPF, and to 
assess the effect of pirfenidone treatment on metabolite levels.Metabolic 
pathway analysis and endogenous metabolite quantification revealed that 
pirfenidone treatment restores redox imbalance and glycolysis in IPF tissues, 
and downregulates ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, thereby likely contributing 
to in situ modulation of collagen processing. As such, we detected specific 
alterations in metabolite pathways in fibrosis and, importantly, metabolic 
recalibration following pirfenidone treatment.Together, these results highlight 
the suitability of high-resolution MALDI-FTICR-MSI for deciphering the 
therapeutic effects of pirfenidone and provide a preliminary analysis of the 
metabolic changes that occur during pirfenidone treatment in vivo These data may 
therefore contribute to improvement of currently available therapies for IPF.

OBJECTIVES: Suicide is a major global public health problem and much burden in 
the societies. This study aims to calculate the years of life lost (YLL) due to 
suicide and investigate its trend in Iran.
METHODS: Information on deaths due to suicide in Iran was extracted from Iran 
Legal Medicine Organization. The years of life lost was calculated in each year 
according to gender and age-groups. To examine the trend for different years, 
joinpoint regression was used.
RESULTS: The 35,297 deaths due to suicide were recorded in 2006-2015. The total 
YLL in the 10-year period was 34.52 per 1000 persons in males, 13.61 per 1000 
persons in females and 23.35 per 1000 persons in both sexes. Hanging comprised 
the largest YLL of suicide. The annual percent change of YLL rate was 3.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that male shows an increasing trend in YLL 
specifically among youth and adult, while there is no improvement in females. 
There is a national need to implement an effective health policy intervention in 
Iran.

BACKGROUND: WHO estimates that, in 2015, nearly 1 million children younger than 
5 years died from lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs). Ambient air 
pollution has a major impact on mortality from LRIs, especially in combination 
with undernutrition and inadequate health care. We aimed to estimate mortality 
due to ambient air pollution in 2015, particularly in children younger than 5 
years, to investigate to what extent exposure to this risk factor affects life 
expectancy in different parts of the world.
METHODS: Applying results from a recent atmospheric chemistry-general 
circulation model and health statistics from the WHO Global Health Observatory, 
combined in integrated exposure-response functions, we updated our estimates of 
mortality from ambient (outdoor) air pollution. We estimated excess deaths 
attributable to air pollution by disease category and age group, particularly 
those due to ambient air pollution-induced LRIs (AAP-LRIs) in childhood. 
Estimates are presented as excess mortality attributable to ambient air 
pollution and years of life lost (YLLs). To study recent developments, we 
calculated our estimates for the years 2010 and 2015.
FINDINGS: Overall, 4·55 million deaths (95% CI 3·41 million to 5·56 million) 
were attributable to air pollution in 2015, of which 727 000 deaths 
(573 000-865 000) were due to AAP-LRIs. We estimated that AAP-LRIs caused about 
237 000 (192 000-277 000) excess child deaths in 2015. Although childhood 
AAP-LRIs contributed about 5% of air pollution-attributable deaths worldwide, 
they accounted for 18% of losses in life expectancy, equivalent to 21·5 million 
(17 million to 25 million) of the total 122 million YLLs due to ambient air 
pollution in 2015. The mortality rate from ambient air pollution was highest in 
Asia, whereas the per capita YLLs were highest in Africa. We estimated that in 
sub-Saharan Africa, ambient air pollution reduces the average life expectancy of 
children by 4-5 years. In Asia, all-age mortality increased by about 10% between 
2010 and 2015, whereas childhood mortality from AAP-LRIs declined by nearly 30% 
in the same period.
INTERPRETATION: Most child deaths due to AAP-LRIs occur in low-income countries 
in Africa and Asia. A three-pronged strategy is needed to reduce the health 
effects of ambient air pollution in children: aggressive reduction of air 
pollution levels, improvements in nutrition, and enhanced treatment of air 
pollution-related health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: PM2·5 air pollution is associated with increased risk of diabetes; 
however, a knowledge gap exists to further define and quantify the burden of 
diabetes attributable to PM2·5 air pollution. Therefore, we aimed to define the 
relationship between PM2·5 and diabetes. We also aimed to characterise an 
integrated exposure response function and to provide a quantitative estimate of 
the global and national burden of diabetes attributable to PM2·5.
METHODS: We did a longitudinal cohort study of the association of PM2·5 with 
diabetes. We built a cohort of US veterans with no previous history of diabetes 
from various databases. Participants were followed up for a median of 8·5 years, 
we and used survival models to examine the association between PM2·5 and the 
risk of diabetes. All models were adjusted for sociodemographic and health 
characteristics. We tested a positive outcome control (ie, risk of all-cause 
mortality), negative exposure control (ie, ambient air sodium concentrations), 
and a negative outcome control (ie, risk of lower limb fracture). Data for the 
models were reported as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. Additionally, we 
reviewed studies of PM2·5 and the risk of diabetes, and used the estimates to 
build a non-linear integrated exposure response function to characterise the 
relationship across all concentrations of PM2·5 exposure. We included studies 
into the building of the integrated exposure response function if they scored at 
least a four on the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and were only 
included if the outcome was type 2 diabetes or all types of diabetes. Finally, 
we used the Global Burden of Disease study data and methodologies to estimate 
the attributable burden of disease (ABD) and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) of diabetes attributable to PM2·5 air pollution globally and in 194 
countries and territories.
FINDINGS: We examined the relationship of PM2·5 and the risk of incident 
diabetes in a longitudinal cohort of 1 729 108 participants followed up for a 
median of 8·5 years (IQR 8·1-8·8). In adjusted models, a 10 μg/m3 increase in 
PM2·5 was associated with increased risk of diabetes (HR 1·15, 95% CI 
1·08-1·22). PM2·5 was associated with increased risk of death as the positive 
outcome control (HR 1·08, 95% CI 1·03-1·13), but not with lower limb fracture as 
the negative outcome control (1·00, 0·91-1·09). An IQR increase (0·045 μg/m3) in 
ambient air sodium concentration as the negative exposure control exhibited no 
significant association with the risk of diabetes (HR 1·00, 95% CI 0·99-1·00). 
An integrated exposure response function showed that the risk of diabetes 
increased substantially above 2·4 μg/m3, and then exhibited a more moderate 
increase at concentrations above 10 μg/m3. Globally, ambient PM2·5 contributed 
to about 3·2 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2·2-3·8) incident cases of 
diabetes, about 8·2 million (95% UI 5·8-11·0) DALYs caused by diabetes, and 
206 105 (95% UI 153 408-259 119) deaths from diabetes attributable to PM2·5 
exposure. The burden varied substantially among geographies and was more heavily 
skewed towards low-income and lower-to-middle-income countries.
INTERPRETATION: The global toll of diabetes attributable to PM2·5 air pollution 
is significant. Reduction in exposure will yield substantial health benefits.

BACKGROUND: To mitigate the serious levels of air pollution in China, the State 
Council of China issued the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan 
(APPCAP) in 2013. This policy is a milestone in air quality control in China. We 
aimed to evaluate the effects of the APPCAP on long-term air quality management 
and the related health impacts in China.
METHODS: We did an analysis of national air quality monitoring and mortality 
data to estimate the health impact of the APPCAP from 2013 to 2017 in 74 key 
cities in China. Changes in mortality and in years of life lost (YLL), an 
indicator that considers life expectancy at death, were calculated to assess the 
health impact of air quality management during the 5-year period.
FINDINGS: Between 2013 and 2017, annual average concentrations of PM2·5 
decreased by 33·3% (95% CI 16·3-50·3), PM10 by 27·8% (8·0-47·5), sulphur dioxide 
by 54·1% (28·2-80·0), and carbon monoxide by 28·2% (3·1-53·3) in the 74 key 
cities. However, no significant change was seen in annual average concentrations 
of nitrogen dioxide (9·7% reduction; 95% CI -23·0 to 42·4) or ozone (20·4% 
increase; -30·1 to 71·0). In 2017, as a result of substantial improvements in 
air quality, there were 47 240 (95% CI 25 870-69 990) fewer deaths and 710 020 
(420 230-1 025 460) fewer YLL in the 74 key cities in China than in 2013.
INTERPRETATION: Substantial reductions in mortality and YLL related to control 
of ambient air pollution were achieved from 2013 to 2017 in China, indicating 
appreciable effectiveness of China's APPCAP. However, emissions control efforts 
for ozone and nitrogen dioxide should be strengthened in the future.

BACKGROUND: In adults, as little as 10 minutes of moderate physical activity 
(PA) three times a day can help prevent non-communicable diseases and prolong 
life expectancy. The aim of the study was to evaluate the process and impact of 
scaling up a complex intervention (PAFES) implemented in Catalonia, aimed to 
increase the proportion of adults complying with PA recommendations (especially 
those with cardiovascular risk factors).
METHODS: The intervention, piloted in 2005, had three elements: 1) establishing 
clinical guidelines for PA; 2) identifying local PA resources; 3) PA screening 
and advice in primary health care (PHC) settings, based on stage of change. 
Central and local level implementation activities included training, support to 
municipalities, dissemination through a web page, and promotion of World 
Physical Activity Day (WPAD). Evaluation followed the RE-AIM framework (Reach, 
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance), identifying 3-6 variables 
for annual evaluation of each dimension. These included coverage of PA screening 
and advice and individuals with access to a healthy exercise route (Reach), 
increased PA level between 2006 and 2010-15 (Effectiveness), PAFES adoption by 
PHC centres and municipalities (Adoption), process evaluation data 
(Implementation), and cost (Maintenance).
RESULTS: PHC screening coverage increased from 14.4% (2008) to 69.6% (2015) and 
advice coverage from 8.3% (2012) to 35.6% (2015). In 2015, 82.5% patients had 
access to a "healthy route" (Reach). The proportion of patients with at least 
one cardiovascular risk factor who were "sufficiently active" increased from 
2006 to 2010-2013 (Effectiveness). By 2015, PAFES was applied by all PHC teams, 
8.3% municipalities and 22.7% PHC centres had organized WPAD events (Adoption). 
The Plan showed good penetration in all health regions by 2013, with relatively 
low use of resources and estimated cost (Implementation). By 2013 the Plan was 
embedded within the health system (Maintenance).
CONCLUSIONS: In the first application of the RE-AIM framework to evaluate the 
scaling-up of a PA plan, PAFES showed good results for most RE-AIM indicators. 
Changes in priority and investment in health promotion programs affect reach, 
adoption, and effectiveness. It is important to maintain support until programs 
are strongly embedded into the health system.

BACKGROUND: Many socioecological and structural factors affect women's diets, 
physical activity, and her access and receptivity to perinatal care. We sought 
to explore women's and providers' perceptions and experiences of health in the 
pre- and post-natal period while facing difficult life circumstances, and 
accessing a community-based program partially funded by Canada Prenatal 
Nutrition Program (CPNP) in Alberta, Canada.
METHODS: Following the principles of community-based participatory research, we 
conducted a focused ethnography that involved five focus groups with women (28 
in total), eight one-on-one interviews with program providers, and observations 
of program activities. Data were analyzed through qualitative content analysis 
to inductively derive codes and categories.
RESULTS: Women perceived eating healthy foods, taking prenatal vitamins, and 
being physically active as key health behaviours during pregnancy and 
postpartum. However, they were commonly coping with many difficult life 
circumstances, and faced health barriers for themselves and their babies. These 
barriers included pregnancy or birth complications, family and spousal issues, 
financial difficulties, and living rurally. On the other hand, women and 
providers identified many aspects of the community-based program that addressed 
the burden of adversities as enablers to better health during pregnancy and 
postpartum.
CONCLUSION: Community-based programs have an important role in alleviating some 
of the burden of coping with difficult life circumstances for women. With such 
potential, community-based programs need to be well supported through policies. 
Policies supporting these programs, and ensuring adequate funding, can enable 
more equitable services to rural women and truly promote maternal health during 
pregnancy and postpartum.

Adverse events affect the pharmacological treatment of approximately 90% of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) patients at any stage of the disease. Chemotherapy 
including fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin is the cornerstone of 
the pharmacological treatment of CRC. The introduction of novel targeted agents, 
as anti-EGFR (i.e. cetuximab, panitumumab) and antiangiogenic (i.e. bevacizumab, 
ziv-aflibercept, regorafenib, and ramucirumab) molecules, into the oncologist's 
toolbox has led to significant improvements in the life expectancy of advanced 
CRC patients, but with a substantial increase in toxicity burden. In this 
respect, pharmacogenomics has largely been applied to the personalization of CRC 
chemotherapy, focusing mainly on the study of inhered polymorphisms in genes 
encoding phase I and II enzymes, ATP-binding cassette (ABC)/solute carrier (SLC) 
membrane transporters, proteins involved in DNA repair, folate pathway and 
immune response. These research efforts have led to the identification of some 
validated genetic markers of chemotherapy toxicity, for fluoropyrimidines and 
irinotecan. No validated genetic determinants of oxaliplatin-specific toxicity, 
as peripheral neuropathy, has thus far been established. The contribution of 
host genetic markers in predicting the toxicity associated with novel targeted 
agents' administration is still controversial due to the heterogeneity of 
published data. Pharmacogenomics guidelines have been published by some 
international scientific consortia such as the Clinical Pharmacogenomics 
Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group 
(DPWG) strongly suggesting a pre-treatment dose adjustment of irinotecan based 
on UGT1A1*28 genotype and of fluoropyrimidines based on some DPYD genetic 
variants, to increase treatment safety. However, these recommendations are still 
poorly applied at the patient's bedside. Several ongoing projects in the U.S. 
and Europe are currently evaluating how pharmacogenomics can be implemented 
successfully in daily clinical practice. The majority of drug-related adverse 
events are still unexplained, and a great deal of ongoing research is aimed at 
improving knowledge of the role of pharmacogenomics in increasing treatment 
safety. In this review, the issue of pre-treatment identification of CRC 
patients at risk of toxicity via the analysis of patients' genetic profiles is 
addressed. Available pharmacogenomics guidelines with ongoing efforts to 
implement them in clinical practice and new exploratory markers for clinical 
validation are described.

BACKGROUND: Healthcare costs are a global concern, and cost-effectiveness 
analyses of interventions have become important. However, data regarding 
cost-effectiveness are limited to a few medical fields. The purpose of our study 
was to examine the Japanese universal health insurance system cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for lumbar fenestration surgery.
METHODS: Forty-eight patients who underwent fenestration for lumbar degenerative 
spinal canal stenosis between July 2013 and September 2015 were included. 
Effectiveness was evaluated by measuring the EuroQOL 5-dimension (EQ-5D), 
Short-Form 8 physical component summary (PCS), and visual analog scale (VAS). 
Cost was analyzed from the perspective of the public healthcare payer. 
Effectiveness and cost were measured 1 year after surgery. QALYs were calculated 
by multiplying the utility value (EQ-5D) and life years. Only direct costs based 
on actual reimbursements were included. Cost per QALY with a 5-year time horizon 
with a 2% discount rate was estimated. Sensitivity analysis was performed by 
varying the time horizon (2 years or 10 years).
RESULTS: Mean total cost 1 year after fenestration surgery was 1,254,300 yen 
(standard deviation [SD], 430,000 yen; median, 1,172,300 yen). Operative cost 
was 406,800 yen (SD, 251,500 yen; median, 363,000 yen). Mean gained score was 
0.21 for EQ-5D (SD, 0.18; median, 0.24), 11 for PCS (SD, 10; median, 12), 
and -43 for VAS (SD, 34; median, -38). Cost per QALY was 1,268,600 yen. 
Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that cost per QALY with a 10-year time horizon 
was 679,300 yen and that with a 2-year time horizon was 3,004,600 yen.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost per QALY of lumbar fenestration with a 5-year time horizon was 
1,268,600 yen (11,532 US dollar), which was below the widely accepted benchmark 
(cost per QALY <5,000,000-6,500,000 yen (50,000 US dollars)). Fenestration is a 
cost-effective intervention.
