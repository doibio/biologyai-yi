Background Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects one in 
400 to one in 1000 individuals; 10%-11% of these individuals have intracranial 
aneurysms. The frequency and patterns of screening for intracranial aneurysms 
have not been defined. Purpose To evaluate different MR angiography screening 
and surveillance strategies for unruptured intracranial aneurysms in patients 
with ADPKD. Materials and Methods A Markov decision-analytic model was 
constructed accounting for both costs and outcomes from a societal perspective. 
Five different management strategies were evaluated: (a) no screening for 
intracranial aneurysm, (b) one-time screening with annual MR angiography 
follow-up in patients with intracranial aneurysm, (c) MR angiographic screening 
every 5 years with endovascular treatment in detected intracranial aneurysm, (d) 
MR angiography screening every 5 years with annual MR angiography follow-up in 
patients with intracranial aneurysm, and (e) MR angiography screening every 5 
years with biennial follow-up in patients with intracranial aneurysm. One-way, 
two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results Base 
case calculation shows that MR angiography screening of patients with ADPKD 
every 5 years and annual follow-up in patients with detected intracranial 
aneurysm is the optimal strategy (cost, $19 839; utility, 25.86 quality-adjusted 
life years), which becomes more favorable as the life expectancy increases 
beyond 6 years. The conclusion remains robust in probabilistic and one-way 
sensitivity analyses. When the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms is greater 
than 10%, annual rupture risk is 0.35%-2.5%, and the rate of de novo aneurysm 
detection is lower than 1.8%, MR angiography screening every 5 years with annual 
MR angiography follow-up is the favorable strategy. Conclusion Screening for 
intracranial aneurysms with MR angiography in patients with autosomal dominant 
polycystic kidney disease is cost-effective. Repeat screening every 5 years 
should be performed after a negative initial study. Annual surveillance MR 
angiography is optimal in patients with detected, incidental intracranial 
aneurysm, and treatment may be considered in patients with growing, high-risk 
aneurysms. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this

We present life expectancy estimates for hundreds of vertebrate species based on 
carefully vetted studbook data from North American zoos and aquariums. These 
data include sex-specific median life expectancies as well as sample size and 
95% confidence limits for each estimate. Existing longevity data for animals 
primarily consist of maximum lifespan values, which are single observations 
rather than statistically derived estimates of longevity. Moreover, all of our 
estimates are based on the same type of data and calculated using consistent, 
standardized methods. To derive these estimates, we conducted Kaplan-Meier 
survival analyses using individual-level demographic data (i.e., records of 
birth and mortality events) from studbook records for each ex situ population. 
Our species set represents a range of vertebrate taxa (primarily mammals, birds, 
amphibians, and reptiles) and diverse life histories. This dataset will have 
broad utility, not only for informing comparative demographic and life history 
studies, but also more broadly for any research or conservation application that 
requires sex- or species-specific life expectancy information.

The transcription factor NF-κB is a central mediator of inflammation with 
multiple links to thrombotic processes. In this review, we focus on the role of 
NF-κB signaling in cell types within the vasculature and the circulation that 
are involved in thrombo-inflammatory processes. All these cells express NF-κB, 
which mediates important functions in cellular interactions, cell survival and 
differentiation, as well as expression of cytokines, chemokines, and coagulation 
factors. Even platelets, as anucleated cells, contain NF-κB family members and 
their corresponding signaling molecules, which are involved in platelet 
activation, as well as secondary feedback circuits. The response of endothelial 
cells to inflammation and NF-κB activation is characterized by the induction of 
adhesion molecules promoting binding and transmigration of leukocytes, while 
simultaneously increasing their thrombogenic potential. Paracrine signaling from 
endothelial cells activates NF-κB in vascular smooth muscle cells and causes a 
phenotypic switch to a "synthetic" state associated with a decrease in 
contractile proteins. Monocytes react to inflammatory situations with enforced 
expression of tissue factor and after differentiation to macrophages with 
altered polarization. Neutrophils respond with an extension of their life 
span-and upon full activation they can expel their DNA thereby forming so-called 
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which exert antibacterial functions, but 
also induce a strong coagulatory response. This may cause formation of 
microthrombi that are important for the immobilization of pathogens, a process 
designated as immunothrombosis. However, deregulation of the complex cellular 
links between inflammation and thrombosis by unrestrained NET formation or the 
loss of the endothelial layer due to mechanical rupture or erosion can result in 
rapid activation and aggregation of platelets and the manifestation of 
thrombo-inflammatory diseases. Sepsis is an important example of such a disorder 
caused by a dysregulated host response to infection finally leading to severe 
coagulopathies. NF-κB is critically involved in these pathophysiological 
processes as it induces both inflammatory and thrombotic responses.

OBJECTIVE: Health utility decrements associated with diabetes mellitus 
complications are essential for calculating quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
in patients for use in economic evaluation of diabetes interventions. Previous 
studies mostly focused on assessing the impact of complications on health 
utility at event year based on cross-sectional data. This study aimed to 
separately estimate health utility decrements associated with current and 
previous diabetes complications.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI-3) was used 
to measure heath utility in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in 
Diabetes (ACCORD) trial (N = 8713). Five macrovascular complications (myocardial 
infarction [MI], congestive heart failure [CHF], stroke, angina, and 
revascularization surgery [RS]) and three microvascular complications 
(nephropathy [renal failure], retinopathy [severe vision loss], and neuropathy 
[severe pressure sensation loss]) were included in a set of alternative 
modelling approaches including the ordinary least squares (OLS) model, fixed 
effects model, and random effects model to estimate the complication-related 
health utility decrements.
RESULTS: All macrovascular complications were associated with decrements of 
HUI-3 scores: MI (event year: - 0.042, successive years: - 0.011), CHF (event 
year: - 0.089, successive years: - 0.041), stroke (event year: - 0.204, 
successive years: - 0.101), angina (event year: - 0.010, successive years: 
- 0.032), and revascularization (event year: - 0.038, successive years: - 0.016) 
(all p < 0.05). For microvascular complications, severe vision loss (- 0.057), 
and severe pressure sensation loss (- 0.066) were significantly associated with 
decrements of HUI-3 scores (both p < 0.05). Hypoglycemia (both severe and 
symptomatic) was found to be associated with a 0.036 decrement of health utility 
at event year, and a 0.033 decrement of health utility at successive years. 
Results from an OLS model are preferred for supporting a microsimulation model 
while a fixed effects model is preferred to describe direct health impacts from 
complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Macrovascular and microvascular complications caused QALY 
decrements in patients with type 2 diabetes. While only part of the total 
impaired QALY is experienced during the event year, further QALY decrements for 
successive years were quite substantial.

The Interplay Between Cholesterol Metabolism and Intrinsic Ageing.

The last few decades have witnessed remarkable progress in our understanding of 
ageing. From an evolutionary standpoint it is generally accepted that ageing is 
a non-adaptive process which is underscored by a decrease in the force of 
natural selection with time. From a mechanistic perspective ageing is 
characterized by a wide variety of cellular mechanisms, including processes such 
as cellular senescence, telomere attrition, oxidative damage, molecular 
chaperone activity, and the regulation of biochemical pathways by sirtuins. 
These biological findings have been accompanied by an unrelenting rise in both 
life expectancy and the number of older people globally. However, despite age 
being recognized demographically as a risk factor for healthspan, the processes 
associated with ageing are routinely overlooked in disease mechanisms. Thus, a 
central goal of biogerontology is to understand how diseases such as 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) are shaped by ageing. This challenge cannot be 
ignored because CVD is the main cause of morbidity in older people. A worthwhile 
way to examine how ageing intersects with CVD is to consider the effects ageing 
has on cholesterol metabolism, because dysregualted cholesterol metabolism is 
the key factor which underpins the pathology of CVD. The aim of this chapter is 
to outline a hypothesis which accounts for how ageing intersects with 
intracellular cholesterol metabolism. Moreover, we discuss the implications of 
this relationship for the onset of disease in the 'oldest old' (individuals 
≥85 years of age). We conclude the chapter by discussing the important role 
mathematical modelling has to play in improving our understanding of cholesterol 
metabolism and ageing.

With the introduction of HAART, the life expectancy of the patients infected 
with HIV almost approached that of the general population. The incidence of 
certain HIV-Associated cancers as Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma 
(NHL) decreased, while an increase in Non-AIDS-Defining cancers (NADCs) has been 
documented. HIV infection is a risk factor for numerous cancers in PLWH. Breast 
cancer is the most common cancer worldwide among all women. The association 
between HIV infection and breast cancer has not been thoroughly investigated: 
when compared to the general population, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) 
have a similar or slightly lower risk of breast cancer. Screening tests are 
essential weapons to fight cancer burden and more effective therapeutic and 
preventive strategies are needed, especially among PLWHA. Further and more 
comprehensive studies are needed to better characterize breast cancer among 
PLWH.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the (a) number and type of cancer care providers that 
radiation oncology outpatients report discussing life expectancy with, and (b) 
perceptions of the acceptability and utility of life expectancy information.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of patients receiving radiotherapy was 
undertaken in four treatment centres. Patients indicated whether they had 
discussed life expectancy with a cancer doctor (i.e., medical oncologists, 
radiation oncologists, surgeon, haematologists) and/or other cancer care 
provider (i.e., general practitioner, radiation therapist, nurse); and 
acceptability and utility of information.
RESULTS: Of 207 respondents, 133 (64%) had discussed life expectancy with at 
least one provider. General practitioners (GPs) were the most frequent source of 
information. Of those who had discussed life expectancy, half (n = 110/207) 
perceived cancer would not impact life expectancy. Information was easy to 
understand (91%), discussed sensitively (90%), helped plan for future (83%) and 
gave them certainty (86%). The information made 11% feel overloaded and 34% feel 
anxious.
CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of respondents had discussed life expectancy with at 
least one cancer care provider. Providers from the range of disciplines involved 
in cancer care need to be skilled at communicating life expectancy information 
and recognising the adverse impact this may have on some patients.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
active surveillance (AS) versus nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) in patients with a 
Bosniak IIF or III renal cyst.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Markov models were developed to estimate life expectancy 
and lifetime costs for 60-year-old patients with a Bosniak IIF or III renal cyst 
(the reference cases) managed by AS versus NSS. The models incorporated the 
malignancy rates, reclassification rates during follow-up, treatment 
effectiveness, complications and costs, and short- and long-term outcomes. An 
incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to identify management 
preference under an assumed $75,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
societal willingness-to-pay threshold, using data from studies in the literature 
and the 2015 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. The effects of key parameters were 
addressed in a multiway sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The prevalence of malignancy for Bosniak IIF and III renal cysts was 
26% (25/96) and 52% (542/1046). Under base case assumptions for Bosniak IIF 
cysts, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of NSS relative to AS was 
$731,309 per QALY for women, exceeding the assumed societal willingness-to-pay 
threshold, and AS outperformed NSS for both life expectancy and cost for men. 
For Bosniak III cysts, AS yielded greater life expectancy (24.8 and 19.4 more 
days) and lower lifetime costs (cost difference of $12,128 and $11,901) than NSS 
for men and women, indicating dominance of AS over NSS. Superiority of AS held 
true in sensitivity analyses for men 46 years old or older and women 57 years 
old or older even when all parameters were set to favor NSS.
CONCLUSION: AS is more cost-effective than NSS for patients with a Bosniak IIF 
or III renal cyst.

OBJECTIVES: Despite strong evidence supporting proning in acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, few eligible patients receive it. This study determines the 
cost-effectiveness of interventions to increase utilization of proning for 
severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.
DESIGN: We created decision trees to model severe acute respiratory distress 
syndrome from ICU admission through death (societal perspective) and hospital 
discharge (hospital perspective). We assumed patients received low tidal volume 
ventilation. We used short-term outcome estimates from the PROSEVA trial and 
longitudinal cost and benefit data from cohort studies. In probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses, we used distributions for each input that included the 
fifth to 95th percentile of its CI.
SETTING: ICUs that care for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
SUBJECTS: Patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.
INTERVENTIONS: The implementation of a hypothetical intervention to increase the 
appropriate utilization of prone positioning.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the societal perspective model, an 
intervention that increased proning utilization from 16% to 65% yielded an 
additional 0.779 (95% CI, 0.088-1.714) quality-adjusted life years at an 
additional long-term cost of $31,156 (95% CI, -$158 to $92,179) (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio = $38,648 per quality-adjusted life year [95% CI, 
$1,695-$98,522]). If society was willing to pay $100,000 per quality-adjusted 
life year, any intervention costing less than $51,328 per patient with moderate 
to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome would represent good value. From a 
hospital perspective, the intervention yielded 0.072 (95% CI, 0.008-0.147) more 
survivals-to-discharge at a cost of $5,242 (95% CI, -$19,035 to $41,019) 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $44,615 per extra survival [95% CI, 
-$250,912 to $558,222]). If hospitals were willing to pay $100,000 per 
survival-to-discharge, any intervention costing less than $5,140 per patient 
would represent good value.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that increase utilization of proning would be 
cost-effective from both societal and hospital perspectives under many plausible 
cost and benefit assumptions.

Osteoporosis screening rates by DXA are low (9.5% women, 1.7% men) in the US 
Medicare population aged 65 years and older. Addressing this care gap, we 
estimated the benefits of a validated osteoporosis diagnostic test suitable for 
patients age 65 years and older with an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan 
taken for any indication but without a recent DXA. Our analysis assessed a 
hypothetical cohort of 1000 such patients in a given year, and followed them for 
5 years. Separately for each sex, we used Markov modeling to compare two 
mutually exclusive scenarios: (i) utilizing the CT scans, perform one-time 
"biomechanical computed tomography" (BCT) analysis to identify high-risk 
patients on the basis of both femoral strength and hip BMD T-scores; (ii) ignore 
the CT scan, and rely instead on usual care, consisting of future annual DXA 
screening at typical Medicare rates. For patients with findings indicative of 
osteoporosis, 50% underwent 2 years of treatment with alendronate. We found that 
BCT provided greater clinical benefit at lower cost for both sexes than usual 
care. In our base case, compared to usual care, BCT prevented hip fractures over 
a 5-year window (3.1 per 1000 women; 1.9 per 1000 men) and increased 
quality-adjusted life years (2.95 per 1000 women; 1.48 per 1000 men). Efficacy 
and savings increased further for higher-risk patient pools, greater treatment 
adherence, and longer treatment duration. When the sensitivity and specificity 
of BCT were set to those for DXA, the prevented hip fractures versus usual care 
remained high (2.7 per 1000 women; 1.5 per 1000 men), indicating the importance 
of high screening rates on clinical efficacy. Therefore, for patients with a 
previously taken abdominal CT and without a recent DXA, osteoporosis screening 
using biomechanical computed tomography may be a cost-effective alternative to 
current usual care. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of two models of osteoporosis care after 
upper extremity fragility fracture using a high-intensity Fracture Liaison 
Service (FLS) Case-Manager intervention versus a low-intensity FLS (ie, Active 
Control), and both relative to usual care. This analysis used data from a 
pragmatic patient-level parallel-arm comparative effectiveness trial of 361 
community-dwelling participants 50 years or older with upper extremity fractures 
undertaken at a Canadian academic hospital. We used a decision-analytic Markov 
model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the three treatment alternatives. 
The perspective was health service payer; the analytical horizon was lifetime; 
costs and health outcomes were discounted by 3%. Costs were expressed in 2016 
Canadian dollars (CAD) and the health effect was measured by quality adjusted 
life years (QALYs). The average age of enrolled patients was 63 years and 89% 
were female. Per patient cost of the Case Manager and Active Control 
interventions were $66CAD and $18CAD, respectively. Compared to the Active 
Control, the Case Manager saved $333,000, gained seven QALYs, and averted nine 
additional fractures per 1000 patients. Compared to usual care, the Case Manager 
saved $564,000, gained 14 QALYs, and incurred 18 fewer fractures per 1000 
patients, whereas the Active Control saved $231,000, gained seven QALYs, and 
incurred nine fewer fractures per 1000 patients. Although both interventions 
dominated usual care, the Case Manager intervention also dominated the Active 
Control. In 5000 probabilistic simulations, the probability that the Case 
Manager intervention was cost-effective was greater than 75% whereas the Active 
Control intervention was cost-effective in less than 20% of simulations. In 
summary, although the adoption of either of these approaches into clinical 
settings should lead to cost savings, reduced fractures, and increased 
quality-adjusted life for older adults following upper extremity fracture, the 
Case Manager intervention would be the most likely to be cost-effective. © 2019

Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi, the causal agent of mummy berry disease, infects 
blueberry flowers via the gynoecial pathway. To describe the expression of host 
resistance in highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), fungal growth in the 
styles and colonization of the locules were compared among five blueberry 
cultivars in a series of controlled greenhouse experiments. Styles were 
harvested 1 and 4 days postinoculation, and the length colonized by hyphae was 
determined using fluorescence microscopy. At 8 weeks after inoculation, fruit 
were harvested and scored for the presence of hyphae in the locules. The 
infection frequency of styles ranged from 0.33 to 0.71, and only cv. Weymouth 
had significantly lower infection frequency than the other cultivars. The mean 
length of the colonized portion of the stylar canal ranged from 0.126 to 0.434 
mm after 1 day and 1.62 to 3.59 mm after 4 days. Hyphae in the styles of cv. 
Weymouth exhibited the least growth, whereas hyphae in the styles of cultivars 
Jersey and Rancocas were significantly longer. The distance of style penetrated 
for cultivars Bluecrop and Coville was intermediate. The mean disease incidence 
of locules differed significantly. Values for cultivars Weymouth and Jersey were 
the smallest (0.038 and 0.039) and largest (0.249 and 0.236), respectively. The 
results demonstrate that a component of resistance to infection by M. 
vaccinii-corymbosi is expressed during growth in the gynoecial pathway.

Due to the variable expression of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), it 
is difficult to predict the course of the disease. However, knowledge about the 
normal function of the MEN1 gene product, together with the effects of cellular 
derangement by subsequent genetic events, has increased considerably. At first, 
the possible existence of a genotype-phenotype correlation is discussed. Thus, 
mild- and late-onset phenotypes may be distinguished from more malignant 
phenotypes depending on the character of the primary MEN1 disease gene mutation. 
Subsequently, tumor-promoting factors such as gender, additional genetic 
mutations and ecogenetic factors may contribute to the course of the disease. 
New developments in management are based on the knowledge and experience of the 
multidisciplinary teams involved. Finally, the metabolic effects of MEN1 
mutations in aged patients are discussed. Early identification of predisposition 
to the disease, together with knowledge about the natural history of specific 
mutations, risks of additional mutations and periodic clinical monitoring, allow 
early treatment and may improve life expectancy and quality of life.

First Report of Pantoea sp. Induced Soft Rot Disease of Pleurotus eryngii in 
Korea.

The king oyster mushroom, Pleurotus eryngii, has become a popular crop because 
of its unique flavor and texture and is cultivated in many areas in Korea. In 
2003, symptoms of water-soaked lesions and soft rot in the stipes and pileus of 
cultivated P. eryngii was observed in Jinju, Korea. Diseased tissue was plated 
on nutrient media. Dominate colonies were yellow, convex, circular with smooth 
margins, and had a shiny texture. Computer analysis of the data gathered, using 
the API kit (50CHE, bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France), showed that the strain 
belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae. Although the API system did not give an exact 
identification, the metabolic profile of the bacterial strain closely resembled 
the database profile of Pantoea sp. (positive for acid production from the 
fermentation of d-fructose, d-galactose, d-glucose, d-trehalose, and d-ribose 
and negative for oxidase, urease, pectate, and thiosulfate). The 16S rDNA 
sequence of the bacterium was determined (GenBank Accession No. AY530796). When 
compared with those in GenBank, the bacterium was determined to belong to the 
Enterobacteriaceae family of the Gammaproteobacteria, and the highest degree of 
sequence similarity was found to be with Pantoea ananatis strain BD 588 (97.4%) 
and Pantoea ananatis strain Pna 97-1 (97.3%). In the phylogenetic tree, the 
bacterium clearly related to the Pantoea lineage, as evidenced by the high 
bootstrap value. A BLAST search with 16S rDNA sequence of the bacterium 
supported the API results that the isolate belongs to a species of Pantoea. 
Pathogenicity tests of this new Pantoea isolate were carried out with bacterial 
suspensions (approximately 1 × 106 CFU/ml) that were grown for 24 h in 
Luria-Bertani broth cultures. These were used to inoculate directly on the 
mycelia of P. eryngii that had been cultivated for 35 days in a plastic bottle. 
The water and broth were also inoculated to another set of bottles as a control 
experiment. Inoculated bottles were incubated in a cultivation room at 16 to 
17°C with relative humidity between 80 and 95%. Early symptoms of the disease 
included a dark brown water drop that developed on hypha and primordium of the 
mushrooms after 5 to 7 days. After 13 days, water-soaked lesions developed on 
the stipes and pileus, and the normal growth of the mushrooms was inhibited. An 
offensive odor then developed along with a severe soft rot that was similar to 
the disease symptoms observed under natural conditions. Mushrooms in control 
bottles did not develop symptoms. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by isolating 
bacteria from typical lesions from inoculated mushrooms that were identical to 
the inoculated strain in colony morphology and biochemical characteristics. 
Pantoea ananatis was first reported as a pathogen of pineapple fruit causing 
brown rot (3). Several bacterial diseases, such as brown blotch on cultivated 
mushrooms by Pseudomonas tolaasii (2) and bacterial soft rot on winter mushroom 
by Erwinia carotovora subsp. Carotovora, causing severe damage to mushrooms are 
known (1). However, no Pantoea sp. induced disease of edible mushroom has been 
previously reported. To our knowledge, this is the first report of soft rot 
disease on P. eryngii caused by Pantoea sp. References: (1) H. Okamoto et al.

Host resistance offers the most cost-effective method of Verticillium wilt 
control in lettuce (Lactuca sativa). In 2004 and 2005, 107 and 22 lettuce 
cultivars, respectively, were screened for resistance in a field infested with 
Verticillium dahliae, and disease progress on resistant and susceptible 
cultivars was determined. Greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate 16 
cultivars for resistance to a race 1 and a race 2 isolate. Significant 
differences for resistance were observed within cultivated lettuce. In 
susceptible cultivars, disease levels increased through the season, whereas 
disease in resistant cultivars remained constant. Resistance in greenhouse tests 
was dependant upon the race used. Seven cultivars were resistant to race 1, 
whereas all were susceptible to race 2. Cultivar reactions to race 1 in 
greenhouse and field experiments were correlated, indicating the utility of 
greenhouse evaluations. The identification of resistance in diverse lettuce 
types is beneficial to the breeding process. However, because of the existence 
of resistance-breaking race 2 isolates, this resistance may not be durable. 
Alternatively, targeted releases of race-1-resistant cultivars to fields with 
only race 1 pathogen genotypes may extend the life of these cultivars.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal-dominant inherited 
tumor syndrome characterized by hyperplasia and/or tumors in the parathyroid 
glands, the pancreatic islets, the anterior pituitary and adrenal glands, as 
well as neuroendocrine tumors in the thymus, lungs and stomach, and tumors in 
nonendocrine tissues. In 1997, the responsible MEN1 gene was identified as a 
tumor-suppressor gene and its product was named menin. In this review, 
guidelines for early diagnosis, including MEN1 gene mutation analysis, and 
treatment, including periodic clinical monitoring, have been formulated, 
enabling improvement of life expectancy and quality of life. Identification of 
menin-interacting proteins has provided new insights into the function of menin, 
notably involving regulation of gene transcription related to proliferation and 
apoptosis, genome stability and DNA repair, and endocrine/metabolic homeostasis. 
In the near future, target-directed intervention may prevent or delay the onset 
of MEN 1-related tumors.

BACKGROUND: A consensus is emerging in the literature that urban form can impact 
health by either facilitating or deterring physical activity (PA). However, 
there is a lack of evidence measuring population health and the economic 
benefits relating to alternative urban forms. We examined the issue of housing 
people within two distinct types of urban development forms: a medium-density 
brownfield development in an established area with existing amenities (e.g. 
daily living destinations, transit), and a low-density suburban greenfield 
development. We predicted the health and economic benefits of a brownfield 
development compared with a greenfield development through their influence on 
PA.
METHODS: We combined a new Walkability Planning Support System (Walkability PSS) 
with a quantitative health impact assessment model. We used the Walkability PSS 
to estimate the probability of residents' transport walking, based on their 
exposure to urban form in the brownfield and greenfield developments. We 
developed the underlying algorithms of the Walkability PSS using multi-level 
multivariate logistic regression analysis based on self-reported data for 
transport walking from the Victorian Integrated Survey of Transport and Activity 
2009-10 and objectively measured urban form in the developments. We derived the 
difference in transport walking minutes per week based on the probability of 
transport walking in each of the developments and the average transport walking 
time per week among those who reported any transport walking. We then used the 
well-established method of the proportional multi-cohort multi-state life table 
model to translate the difference in transport walking minutes per week into 
health and economic benefits.
RESULTS: If adult residents living in the greenfield neighbourhood were instead 
exposed to the urban development form observed in a brownfield neighbourhood, 
the incidence and mortality of physical inactivity-related chronic diseases 
would decrease. Over the life course of the exposed population (21,000), we 
estimated 1600 health-adjusted life years gained and economic benefits of A$94 
million.
DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that planning policies that create walkable 
neighbourhoods with access to shops, services and public transport will lead to 
substantial health and economic benefits associated with reduced incidence of 
physical inactivity related diseases and premature death.

Even though cell walls have essential functions for bacteria, fungi, and plants, 
tools to investigate their dynamic structure in living cells have been missing. 
Here, it is shown that changes in the intensity of the plasma membrane dye 
FM4-64 in response to extracellular quenchers depend on the nano-scale porosity 
of cell walls. The correlation of quenching efficiency and cell wall porosity is 
supported by tests on various cell types, application of differently sized 
quenchers, and comparison of results with confocal, electron, and atomic force 
microscopy images. The quenching assay was used to investigate how changes in 
cell wall porosity affect the capability for extension growth in the model plant 
Arabidopsis thaliana Results suggest that increased porosity is not a 
precondition but a result of cell extension, thereby providing new insight on 
the mechanism plant organ growth. Furthermore, it was shown that higher cell 
wall porosity can facilitate the action of antifungal drugs in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, presumably by facilitating uptake.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine use of cell salvage 
during caesarean section in mothers at risk of haemorrhage compared with current 
standard of care.
DESIGN: Model-based cost-effectiveness evaluation alongside a multicentre 
randomised controlled trial. Three main analyses were carried out on the trial 
data: (1) based on the intention-to-treat principle; (2) based on the 
per-protocol principle; (3) only participants who underwent an emergency 
caesarean section.
SETTING: 26 obstetric units in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: 3028 women at risk of haemorrhage recruited between June 2013 and 
April 2016.
INTERVENTIONS: Cell salvage (intervention) versus routine care without salvage 
(control).
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness based on incremental cost per donor 
blood transfusion avoided.
RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analysis, the mean difference in total costs 
between cell salvage and standard care was £83. The estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £8110 per donor blood transfusion avoided. 
For the per-protocol analysis, the mean difference in total costs was £92 and 
the ICER was £8252. In the emergency caesarean section analysis, the mean 
difference in total costs was £55 and the ICER was £13 713 per donor blood 
transfusion avoided. This ICER is driven by the increased probability that these 
patients would require a higher level of postoperative care and additional 
surgeries. The results of these analyses were shown to be robust for the 
majority of deterministic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the economic evaluation suggest that while routine 
cell salvage is a marginally more effective strategy than standard care in 
avoiding a donor blood transfusion, there is uncertainty in relation to whether 
it is a less or more costly strategy. The lack of long-term data on the health 
and quality of life of patients in both arms of the trial means that further 
research is needed to fully understand the cost implications of both strategies.

INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease that is characterised 
by reduced bone strength and increased fracture risk. Osteoporosis-related 
fractures impose enormous disease and economic burden to the society. Although 
many treatments and health interventions are proven effective to prevent 
fractures, health economic evaluation adds evidence to their economic merits. 
Computer simulation modelling is a useful approach to extrapolate clinical and 
economic outcomes from clinical trials and it is increasingly used in health 
economic evaluation. Many osteoporosis health economic models have been 
developed in the past decades; however, they are limited to academic use and 
there are no publicly accessible health economic models of osteoporosis.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will develop the Australian osteoporosis health 
economic model based on our previously published microsimulation model of 
osteoporosis in the Chinese population. The development of the model will follow 
the recommendations for the conduct of economic evaluations in osteoporosis by 
the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, 
Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases and the US branch of the 
International Osteoporosis Foundation. The model will be a state-transition 
semi-Markov model with memory. Clinical parameters in the model will be mainly 
obtained from the Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study and the health economic 
parameters will be collected from the Australian arm of the International Costs 
and Utilities Related to Osteoporotic Fractures Study. Model transparency and 
validates will be tested using the recommendations from Good Research Practices 
in Modelling Task Forces. The model will be used in economic evaluations of 
osteoporosis interventions including pharmaceutical treatments and primary care 
interventions. A user-friendly graphical user interface will be developed, which 
will connect the user to the calculation engine and the results will be 
generated. The user interface will facilitate the use of our model by people in 
different sectors.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical approval is needed for this study. Results 
of the model validation and future economic evaluation studies will be submitted 
to journals. The user interface of the health economic model will be publicly 
available online accompanied with a user manual.
