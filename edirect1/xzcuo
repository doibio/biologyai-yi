Tree aging is a new research area and has attracted research interest in recent 
years. Trees show extraordinary longevity; Platycladus orientalis L. 
(Cupressaceae) has a lifespan of thousands of years. Ancient trees are precious 
historical heritage and scientific research materials. However, tree aging and 
tree senescence have different definitions and are poorly understood. Since 
leaves are the most sensitive organ of a tree, we studied the structural 
response of leaves to tree age. Experiments investigating the leaf morphological 
structure, anatomical structure and ultrastructure were conducted in healthy P. 
orientalis at three different ages (ancient trees >2,000 years, 200 years < 
middle-aged trees <500 years, young trees <50 years) at the world's largest 
planted pure forest in the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor, Shaanxi Province, 
China. Interestingly, tree age did not significantly impact leaf cellular 
structure. Ancient P. orientalis trees in forests older than 2,000 years still 
have very strong vitality, and their leaves still maintained a perfect 
anatomical structure and ultrastructure. Our observations provide new evidence 
for the unique pattern of tree aging, especially healthy aging. Understanding 
the relationships between leaf structure and tree age will enhance the 
understanding of tree aging.

Pituitary tumours are a common pathology affecting 15-20% of the population. 
Only about 1‰ of adenomas are clinically manifested; among them, about 
two/thirds are hormonally active, most often secreting prolactin or growth 
hormone. Pituitary tumours are mainly an isolated pathology, without any genetic 
background. However, the latest studies pay special attention to the possibility 
of developing an adenoma as a result of genetic mutation. Among pituitary 
adenomas, the leading group of genetically determined lesions is related to a 
mutation in AIP or MEN1, followed by PRKAR1A, GRP101, DICER, and SDHx. The 
genetic basis of these pituitary tumours is related to positive family history, 
young age of the patient, aggressive clinical process, and resistance to 
treatment. Pituitary tumours occur in over 40% of patients with MEN1 syndrome - 
often in women, they are more than 1 cm in diameter, and secrete prolactin. They 
are usually diagnosed in the fourth decade of life and show a worse response to 
pharmacotherapy than sporadic ones. Confirmation of the genetic background of 
the pituitary tumour implies measurable implications; it might help to direct 
the diagnosis in patients' family members, partially predict the development of 
the disease, and, above all, extend patients' life expectancy.

The authors present an economic evaluation performed alongside a randomized 
controlled trial of mentalization-based treatment in a day hospital setting 
(MBT-DH) versus specialist treatment as usual (S-TAU) for borderline personality 
disorder (BPD) with a 36-month follow-up period. Ninety-five patients from two 
Dutch treatment institutes were randomly assigned. Societal costs were compared 
with the proportion of BPD remissions and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
measured using the five-dimensional EuroQol instrument. The incremental societal 
costs for one additional QALY could not be calculated. The costs for one 
additional BPD remission with MBT-DH are approximately €29,000. There was a 58% 
likelihood that MBT-DH leads to more remitted patients at additional costs 
compared with S-TAU, and a 35% likelihood that MBT-DH leads to more remissions 
at lower costs. MBT-DH is not cost-effective compared with S-TAU with QALYs as 
the outcome, and slightly more cost-effective than S-TAU at 36 months with BPD 
symptoms as the outcome.

With the increase in life expectancy, many people with intellectual disabilities 
(ID) are living in the family home with their parents. This research focuses on 
the experience of 17 fathers of adults with ID. These fathers answered a 
questionnaire including open and closed questions. During the individual 
interview, fathers described their motivations to cohabit with their son or 
daughter, cohabitation benefits and constraints, housing options considered and 
planning for the future. Results indicate that fathers chose this cohabitation. 
However, they experience anxiety because they do not know who will support the 
adult with ID when they can no longer do so. Postparental planning 
considerations include legal concerns and informal discussions with siblings or 
the extended family. These results describe a complex parental situation in 
which there is interaction between their emotions, their attachment to the adult 
with ID and their previous experiences with residential, social or 
rehabilitation services.

DI. Ces pères ont répondu à un questionnaire incluant des questions ouvertes et 
fermées en entrevue individuelle afin de décrire leurs motivations pour 
cohabiter avec leur fils ou leur fille ayant une DI, les bénéfices et 
contraintes de cette cohabitation, les services résidentiels futurs envisagés et 
la planification de « l’après-parents ». Les résultats indiquent que les pères 
ont choisi cette cohabitation. Ils éprouvent de l’anxiété, ignorant qui assumera 
le soutien auprès de l’adulte avec une DI lorsqu’ils ne pourront plus le faire. 
Leur planification de l’après-parents correspond à des démarches légales et à 
des conversations avec la fratrie ou la famille élargie. La discussion souligne 
la complexité de la situation où entrent en jeu les émotions des parents, leur 
attachement à l’adulte ayant une DI et les expériences antérieures avec les 
services résidentiels, sociaux ou de réadaptation.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest food 
assistance program in the United States. Although participation in it has been 
shown to reduce food insecurity, there is comparatively less clear causal 
evidence of positive health effects of participation, particularly among adults. 
We examined the relationship between SNAP participation and premature mortality 
using data for 1997-2009 from the National Health Interview Survey, linked to 
data for 1999-2011 from the National Death Index. Results from bivariate probit 
models found that participation in SNAP led to a populationwide reduction of 1-2 
percentage points in mortality from all causes and a reduction in specific 
causes of death among people ages 40-64.

To estimate the cost-effectiveness of available diagnosis alternatives for 
Mucosal Leishmaniasis (ML) in Colombian suspected patients. A simulation model 
of the disease's natural history was built with a decision tree and Markov 
models. The model´s parameters were identified by systematic review and 
validated by expert consensus. A bottom-up cost analysis to estimate the costs 
of diagnostic strategies and treatment per case was performed by reviewing 48 
clinical records of patients diagnosed with ML. The diagnostic strategies 
compared were as follows: 1) no diagnosis; 2) parasite culture, biopsy, indirect 
immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and Montenegro skin test (MST) combined ; 3) 
parasite culture, biopsy, and IFA combined; 4) PCR-miniexon; and 5) PCR-kDNA. 
Three scenarios were modeled in patients with ML clinical suspicion, according 
to ML prevalence scenarios: high, medium and low. Adjusted sensitivity and 
specificity parameters of a combination of diagnostic tests were estimated with 
a discrete event simulation (DES) model. For each alternative, the costs and 
health outcomes were estimated. The time horizon was life expectancy, 
considering the average age at diagnosis of 31 years. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated per Disability Life Year 
(DALY) avoided, and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed. A threshold of willingness to pay (WTP) of three-time gross domestic 
product per capita (GDPpc) (US$ 15,795) and a discount rate of 3% was 
considered. The analysis perspective was the third payer (Health System). All 
costs were reported in American dollars as of 2015. PCR- kDNA was the 
cost-effective alternative in clinical suspicion levels: low, medium and high 
with ICERs of US$ 7,909.39, US$ 5,559.33 and US$ 4,458.92 per DALY avoided, 
respectively. ML diagnostic tests based on PCR are cost-effective strategies, 
regardless of the level of clinical suspicion. PCR-kDNA was the most 
cost-effective strategy in the competitive scenario with the parameters included 
in the present model.

PURPOSE: This prospective study aimed to determine the accuracy of radiation 
oncologists in predicting the survival of patients with metastatic disease 
receiving radiation therapy and to understand factors associated with their 
accuracy.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: This single-institution study surveyed 22 attending 
radiation oncologists to estimate patient survival. Survival predictions were 
defined as accurate if the observed survival (OS) was within the correct 
survival prediction category (0-6 months, >6-12 months, >12-24 months, and >24 
months). The physicians made survival estimates for each course of radiation, 
yielding 877 analyzable predictions for 689 unique patients. Data analysis 
included Stuart's Tau C, logistic regression models, ordinal logistic regression 
models, and stepwise selection to examine variable interactions.
RESULTS: Of the 877 radiation oncologists' predictions, 39.7% were accurate, 
26.5% were underestimations, and 33.9% were overestimations. Stuart's Tau C 
showed low correlation between OS and survival estimates (0.3499), consistent 
with the inaccuracy reported in the literature. However, results showed less 
systematic overprediction than reported in the literature. Karnofsky performance 
status was the most significant predictor of accuracy, with greater accuracy for 
patients with shorter OS. Estimates were also more accurate for patients with 
lower Karnofsky performance status. Accuracy by patient age varied by primary 
site and race. Physician years of experience did not correlate with accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: The sampled radiation oncologists have a 40% accuracy in predicting 
patient survival. Future investigation should explore how survival estimates 
influence treatment decisions and how to improve survival prediction accuracy.

BACKGROUND: With increases in life expectancy, it is important to understand the 
influence of aging on gait, given that this activity is related to the 
independence of older adults and may help in the development of health 
strategies that encourage successful aging in all phases of this process.
RESEARCH QUESTION: To compare gait parameters with usual and fast speeds for 
independent and autonomous older adults throughout the aging process (60 to 
102 years old), and also to identify which of the gait variables are best for 
identifying differences across the different age groups.
METHODS: Two hundred older adults aged between 60 and 102 years were evaluated. 
The sample was divided into 3 age groups: 60 to 79 years, 80 to 89 years and 
90 years and over. The analyzed gait variables were: speed (meters/s), cadence 
(steps/min), stride time (seconds), step length (centimeters), double support 
(percentage of the gait cycle), swing (percentage of the gait cycle), step 
length variability (CoV%) and stride time variability (CoV%).
RESULTS: Group comparison regarding usual gait and fast gait revealed a 
significant difference in all gait variables. In addition, it can be seen that 
variables such as gait speed and step length showed greater effect sizes in 
intergroup comparison (usual gait: 0.48 and 0.47; fast gait: 0.36 and 0.40; 
respectively), possibly showing that these variables can better detect the 
changes observed with increasing age.
CONCLUSION: There are differences in the gait performance of older adults from 
different age groups for usual and fast gait speeds, which is more evident 
regarding gait speed and step length variables. We recommend the use of usual 
gait for the identification of the effects of aging because, besides showing a 
higher effect size values it is more comfortable and requires less effort from 
older subjects.

DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this guidance statement is to guide clinicians on 
colorectal cancer screening in average-risk adults.
METHODS: This guidance statement is derived from a critical appraisal of 
guidelines on screening for colorectal cancer in average-risk adults and the 
evidence presented in these guidelines. National guidelines published in English 
between 1 June 2014 and 28 May 2018 in the National Guideline Clearinghouse or 
Guidelines International Network library were included. The authors also 
included 3 guidelines commonly used in clinical practice. Web sites were 
searched for guideline updates in December 2018. The AGREE II (Appraisal of 
Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) instrument was used to evaluate the 
quality of guidelines.
TARGET AUDIENCE AND PATIENT POPULATION: The target audience is all clinicians, 
and the target patient population is adults at average risk for colorectal 
cancer.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 1: Clinicians should screen for colorectal cancer in 
average-risk adults between the ages of 50 and 75 years.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 2: Clinicians should select the colorectal cancer screening 
test with the patient on the basis of a discussion of benefits, harms, costs, 
availability, frequency, and patient preferences. Suggested screening tests and 
intervals are fecal immunochemical testing or high-sensitivity guaiac-based 
fecal occult blood testing every 2 years, colonoscopy every 10 years, or 
flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years plus fecal immunochemical testing every 2 
years.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 3: Clinicians should discontinue screening for colorectal 
cancer in average-risk adults older than 75 years or in adults with a life 
expectancy of 10 years or less.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative chronic disease affecting the whole joint 
structures. With the increment in life expectancy and aging population, OA has 
become one of the largest socioeconomic burdens, associated with pain and loss 
of joint function. However, early laboratory tests of OA are still lacking. 
Therefore, new diagnostic tests for this disease are urgently needed. In this 
study, to gain an insight into the pathogenesis and the potential biomarkers of 
OA, we implemented a comparative urine proteomics study on OA patients and 
health people using iTRAQ-based mass spectrometry technology. Western blotting 
was used to validate the relative changes in urine protein levels for four of 
the identified proteins. We constructed a comprehensive urine proteome profile 
of the OA patients and identified 102 proteins differently changed in abundance. 
Forty-six proteins were upregulated and 56 proteins were significantly 
downregulated in OA patients. Furthermore, the proteins, COL-4, MMP9, 
adiponectin, and BBOX1 were validated through Western blots, which can serve as 
valuable candidate biomarkers and help to illustrate the pathogenesis of OA. 
These findings may provide clues for promising biomarkers for the early 
diagnosis and also offer a theoretical basis for the early treatment of OA.

Muscular dystrophies (MD) are a group of genetic diseases that lead to skeletal 
muscle wasting and may affect many organs (multisystem). Unfortunately, no 
curative therapies are available at present for MD patients, and current 
treatments mainly address the symptoms. Thus, stem-cell-based therapies may 
present hope for improvement of life quality and expectancy. Different stem cell 
types lead to skeletal muscle regeneration and they have potential to be used 
for cellular therapies, although with several limitations. In this review, we 
propose a combination of genetic, biochemical, and cell culture treatments to 
correct pathogenic genetic alterations and to increase proliferation, 
dispersion, fusion, and differentiation into new or hybrid myotubes. These 
boosted stem cells can also be injected into pretreate recipient muscles to 
improve engraftment. We believe that this combination of treatments targeting 
the limitations of stem-cell-based therapies may result in safer and more 
efficient therapies for MD patients. Matricryptins have also discussed.

The antimicrobial activity of natural antimicrobials (fruit extracts, essential 
oils and derivates), was assessed against six bacteria species (E. coli O157:H7, 
L. monocytogenes, S. Typhimurium, B. subtilis, E. faecium and S. aureus), two 
molds (A. flavus and P. chrysogenum) and a yeast (C. albicans) using disk 
diffusion method. Then, the antimicrobial compounds having high inhibitory 
capacity were evaluated for the determination of their minimum inhibitory, 
bactericidal and fungicidal concentration (MIC, MBC and MFC respectively). Total 
phenols and flavonoids content, radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing 
antioxidant power of selected compounds were also evaluated. Based on in vitro 
assays, five antimicrobial compounds were selected for their lowest effective 
concentration. Results showed that, most of these antimicrobial compounds had a 
high concentration of total phenols and flavonoids and a good anti-oxidant and 
anti-radical activity. In situ study showed that natural antimicrobials mix, 
applied on the carrot surface, reduced significantly the count of the initial 
mesophilic total flora (TMF), molds and yeasts and allowed an extension of the 
shelf-life of carrots by two days as compared to the control. However, the 
chemical treatment (mix of peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide) showed 
antifungal activity and a slight reduction of TMF.

In the last decade, interest in stretchable electronic systems that can be bent 
or shaped three-dimensionally has increased. The application of these systems is 
that they differentiate between two states and derive there from the 
requirements for the materials used: once formed, but static or permanently 
flexible. For this purpose, new materials that exceed the limited mechanical 
properties of thin metal layers as the typical printed circuit board conductor 
materials have recently gained the interest of research. In this work, novel 
electrically conductive textiles were used as conductor materials for 
stretchable circuit boards. Three different fabrics (woven, knitted and 
nonwoven) made of silver-plated polyamide fibers were investigated for their 
mechanical and electrical behavior under quasi-static and cyclic mechanical 
loads with simultaneous monitoring of the electrical resistance. Thereto, the 
electrically conductive textiles were embedded into a thermoplastic polyurethane 
dielectric matrix and structured by laser cutting into stretchable conductors. 
Based on the characterization of the mechanical and electrical material 
behavior, a life expectancy was derived. The results are compared with 
previously investigated stretchable circuit boards based on thermoplastic 
elastomer and meander-shaped conductor tracks made of copper foils. The 
microstructural changes in the material caused by the applied mechanical loads 
were analyzed and are discussed in detail to provide a deep understanding of 
failure mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Aortic dissection is a separation of the aortic wall, caused by 
blood flowing through a tear in the inner layer of the aorta. Aortic dissection 
is an infrequent but life-threatening condition. The incidence of aortic 
dissection is 3 to 6 per 10,000 per year in the Western population, and can be 
up to 43 per 10,000 per year in the Eastern population. Over 20% of people with 
an aortic dissection do not reach a hospital alive. After admission, the 
mortality rates for people with an aortic dissection are between 10% and 20% for 
those who received endovascular treatment, and between 20% and 30% for those who 
had open surgery. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the standard 
endovascular method to treat complicated type B aortic dissection (aortic 
dissections without involvement of the ascending aorta). Although TEVAR is less 
invasive than open surgery and has a better long-term aortic remodeling effect 
than conservative medical treatment, favourable aortic remodelling is usually 
limited to the thoracic aortic segment. TEVAR cannot be extended into the 
abdominal aorta because it could cover the ostia of the reno-visceral arteries. 
Thus, the abdominal aorta is still at risk of progressive aneurysmal 
degeneration. The PETTICOAT (provisional extension to induce complete 
attachment) technique, with proximal endograft and distal bare metal stent, was 
proposed in 2006 to address this issue. The concept of this technique was to 
implant a distal bare metal stent into the aortic true lumen, distal to the 
proximal endograft, to stabilize the distal collapsed intimal flap, while 
allowing blood flow to reno-visceral arteries. Therefore, the PETTICOAT 
technique was considered to be related to a more extensive aortic remodelling 
for people with type B aortic dissection, especially in the area of the 
abdominal aorta. However, it is still unclear whether the PETTICOAT technique is 
superior to standard TEVAR.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of combined proximal descending aortic 
endografting plus distal bare metal stenting versus conventional proximal 
descending aortic stent graft repair for treating complicated type B aortic 
dissections.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the 
Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied 
Health Literature (CINAHL) databases, and the World Health Organization 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials 
registers to 5 November 2018. We also undertook reference checking and citation 
searching to identify additional studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered all randomised controlled trials which 
compared the outcome of complicated type B aortic dissection, when treated by 
combined proximal descending aortic endografting plus distal bare metal stenting 
(PETTICOAT technique) versus conventional proximal descending aortic stent graft 
repair.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent review authors assessed all 
references identified by the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist. We 
planned to undertake data collection and analysis in accordance with 
recommendations described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of 
Interventions.
MAIN RESULTS: We found no trials that met the inclusion criteria for this 
review.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no randomised controlled trials and 
therefore cannot draw any definite conclusion on this topic. Evidence from 
non-randomised studies appears to be favourable in the short-term, for combined 
proximal descending aortic endografting plus distal bare metal stenting 
(PETTICOAT technique) to solve the problem of unfavourable distal aortic 
remodeling. Randomised controlled trials are warranted to provide solid evidence 
on this topic. Evidence from cohort studies with large sample sizes would also 
be helpful in guiding clinical practice.

The fungus Mucor circinelloides undergoes yeast-mold dimorphism, a developmental 
process associated with its capability as a human opportunistic pathogen. 
Dimorphism is strongly influenced by carbon metabolism, and hence the type of 
metabolism likely affects fungus virulence. We investigated the role of ethanol 
metabolism in M. circinelloides virulence. A mutant in the adh1 gene (M5 strain) 
exhibited higher virulence than the wild-type (R7B) and the complemented 
(M5/pEUKA-adh1+) strains, which were nonvirulent when tested in a mouse 
infection model. Cell-free culture supernatant (SS) from the M5 mutant showed 
increased toxic effect on nematodes compared to that from R7B and M5/pEUKA-adh1+ 
strains. The concentration of acetaldehyde excreted by strain M5 in the SS was 
higher than that from R7B, which correlated with the acute toxic effect on 
nematodes. Remarkably, strain M5 showed higher resistance to H2O2, resistance to 
phagocytosis, and invasiveness in mouse tissues and induced an enhanced systemic 
inflammatory response compared with R7B. The mice infected with strain M5 under 
disulfiram treatment exhibited only half the life expectancy of those infected 
with M5 alone, suggesting that acetaldehyde produced by M. circinelloides 
contributes to the toxic effect in mice. These results demonstrate that the 
failure in fermentative metabolism, in the step of the production of ethanol in 
M. circinelloides, contributes to its virulence, inducing a more severe tissue 
burden and inflammatory response in mice as a consequence of acetaldehyde 
overproduction.

Cell migration is hypothesized to involve a cycle of behaviours beginning with 
leading edge extension. However, recent evidence suggests that the leading edge 
may be dispensable for migration, raising the question of what actually controls 
cell directionality. Here, we exploit the embryonic migration of Drosophila 
macrophages to bridge the different temporal scales of the behaviours 
controlling motility. This approach reveals that edge fluctuations during random 
motility are not persistent and are weakly correlated with motion. In contrast, 
flow of the actin network behind the leading edge is highly persistent. 
Quantification of actin flow structure during migration reveals a stable 
organization and asymmetry in the cell-wide flowfield that strongly correlates 
with cell directionality. This organization is regulated by a gradient of actin 
network compression and destruction, which is controlled by myosin contraction 
and cofilin-mediated disassembly. It is this stable actin-flow polarity, which 
integrates rapid fluctuations of the leading edge, that controls inherent 
cellular persistence.

Both low and very high levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 
increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and shorten 
life expectancy. Low and high levels of HDL‑C are often caused by underlying 
diseases, lifestyle or medication, which should primarily be excluded. Much less 
frequently, monogenic diseases due to mutations in the APOA1, ABCA1 and LCAT 
genes are the cause of very low or unmeasurable HDL‑C levels or in the CETP, 
LIPC and SCARB1 genes for very high HDL‑C values. Genetic and detailed 
biochemical diagnostics should be considered, especially in cases of absolute 
HDL deficiency, early onset ASCVD or the presence of clinical symptoms or 
laboratory values characteristic for deficiencies of apolipoprotein A‑I 
(ApoA-I), lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) or Tangier disease. These 
included corneal opacities, xanthomas, large tonsils, hepatomegaly, peripheral 
neuropathy, proteinuria, anemia or thrombocytopenia. Sequencing of the APOA1 
gene should also be considered in familial amyloidosis. There is no specific 
treatment for monogenic HDL diseases. Cholesterol and blood pressure lowering 
are indicated for the prevention of cardiovascular and renal complications.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pneumothorax (PNX) detection is of the utmost clinical 
relevance because it may quickly progress to cause hemodynamic instability as a 
consequence of invasive ventilation. Radiography is characterized by a low 
sensitivity to detect this disease; in recent years, chest ultrasound (US) has 
gained increased visibility in the diagnosis of acute respiratory emergencies 
including PNX. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical 
impact of extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma (E-FAST) during 
the past 6 years of experience with this technique in our Level I trauma center.
METHODS: Between January 2013 and December 2018, we performed a retrospective 
case-series study including 3320 consecutive patients admitted to the emergency 
department of our hospital because of major trauma. Extended-US was always 
performed and reported immediately after FAST during primary survey and before 
multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scans. The presence of PNX was 
determined using the well-known accepted US criteria. US findings were compared 
with computed tomography (CT) findings, the reference standard for PNX 
detection.
RESULTS: Of the 6640 lungs observed with E-FAST, there were 1244 PNX cases, 
while 1328 PNX cases were detected either on the basis of MDCT or on the basis 
of the presence of air flush during the thoracic decompression in the emergency 
room. Among the 84 false negatives, 12 patients had subcutaneous emphysema, 38 
had a body mass index higher than 27, 6 had a thoracic wall hematoma, and 4 had 
chest penetrating trauma. There were 10 false positives in the diagnosis of PNX 
at US examination, with mild extension and not clinically significant. The 
overall sensitivity of E-FAST for PNX detection was 93.6% (1244/1328), the 
specificity of E-FAST was 99.8% (5312/5322), the negative predictive value (NPV) 
was 98.4% (5312/5396), and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 99.2% 
(1328/1338).
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that bedside thoracic US is characterized by 
a very good accuracy in the diagnostic work-up of major trauma patients, even in 
difficult conditions, allowing rapid diagnosis of PNX.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The novelty of this research lies in the possibility of 
diagnosing potential life-threatening conditions in a very short time by means 
of US, thus proposing a revision of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) 
guidelines in order to incorporate it in the work-up of high-energy injured 
patients.

Aging population presents a major challenge for many countries in the world and 
has made the development of efficient means for healthspan extension a priority 
task for researchers and clinicians worldwide. Anti-aging properties including 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and cardioprotective activities have 
been reported for various phytobioactive compounds (PBCs) including resveratrol, 
quercetin, curcumin, catechin, etc. However, the therapeutic potential of orally 
administered PBCs is limited by their poor stability, bioavailability, and 
solubility in the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, innovative 
nanotechnology-based approaches have been developed to improve the bioactivity 
of PBCs and enhance their potential in preventing and/or treating age-associated 
disorders, primarily those caused by aging-related chronic inflammation. 
PBC-loaded nanoparticles designed for oral administration provide many benefits 
over conventional formulations, including enhanced stability and solubility, 
prolonged half-life, improved epithelium permeability and bioavailability, 
enhanced tissue targeting, and minimized side effects. The present review 
summarizes recent advances in this rapidly developing research area.
