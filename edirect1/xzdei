The authors conducted a review of the literature of cost-effectiveness analyses 
regarding management of Barrett's esophagus, including screening, surveillance, 
and treatment strategies. Because of the presence of multiple systematic reviews 
on this topic, they chose to focus on more recent economic analyses, with an 
emphasis on comparative modeling because these analyses have been demonstrated 
to achieve greater validity and impact when there are multiple competing 
strategies that are clinically reasonable to pursue. The authors identified 
areas of consensus across studies regarding management strategies and also areas 
that require additional empirical data.

INTRODUCTION: Long bone metastases are a disease of high social importance. The 
goals of surgical treatment are to relieve pain, maintain or restore joint 
function, and prevent or treat pathological fractures. "Oligometastases" is a 
disease with a limited number (3-5) of metastatic lesions in the same body 
district, where an aggressive treatment can be carried out with "curative" 
intent. This study aimed to evaluate patients with bone metastases surgically 
treated to determine how surgical treatment can influence prognosis and quality 
of life, comparing solitary metastasis, oligometastases, and multiple 
metastases.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 130 patients with long 
bone metastases surgically treated between October 2015 and August 2019: 40 
patients had solitary metastasis; 38 had less than three metastases 
(oligometastases), and 52 had multiple metastases. Surgery was resection and 
reconstruction with a cemented prosthesis (95) or nailing (35).
RESULTS: Overall survival was significantly better in patients with solitary 
metastasis or oligometastases than in those with multiple metastases (p 
<0.0001). Patients treated with resection and prosthesis had significantly 
better survival than those treated with nailing (p <0.0001). Implant 
complications requiring surgical revision occurred in 20 patients treated with 
prostheses, while no complications occurred in patients treated with nailing.
DISCUSSION: Survival of cancer patients has improved in the last two decades, 
leading to an increase of diagnosed metastases. Patients with oligometastases 
have a survival similar to those with a single metastasis. Optimal implants 
survival curves should stay above the curves of patients survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Since there are no differences in survival, patients with 
oligometastases should be treated as patients with a solitary lesion, with more 
aggressive surgery (wide resection and reconstruction with prosthesis). 
Intramedullary nailing is still indicated in metaphyseal or diaphyseal 
metastases in patients with advanced disease or poor prognosis when the life 
expectancy does not overcome the expected survival of the nail, avoiding the 
need for further surgery.

Adults admitted to hospital with critical illness are vulnerable and at high 
risk of morbidity and mortality, especially in sub-Saharan African settings 
where resources are severely limited. As life expectancy increases, patient 
demographics and healthcare needs are increasingly complex and require 
integrated approaches. Patient outcomes could be improved by increased critical 
care provision that standardises healthcare delivery, provides specialist staff 
and enhanced patient monitoring and facilitates some treatment modalities for 
organ support. In Malawi, we established a new high-dependency unit within Queen 
Elizabeth Central Hospital, a tertiary referral centre serving the country's 
Southern region. This unit was designed in partnership with managers, 
clinicians, nurses and patients to address their needs. In this practice piece, 
we describe a participatory approach to design and implement a sustainable 
high-dependency unit for a low-income sub-Saharan African setting. This 
included: prospective agreement on remit, alignment with existing services, 
refurbishment of a dedicated physical space, recruitment and training of 
specialist nurses, development of context-sensitive clinical standard operating 
procedures, purchase of appropriate and durable equipment and creation of 
digital clinical information systems. As the global COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, 
we accelerated unit opening in anticipation of increased clinical requirement 
and describe how the high-dependency unit responded to this demand.

In complex everyday environments, action selection is critical for optimal 
goal-directed behavior. This refers to the process of choosing a proper action 
from the range of possible alternatives. The neural mechanisms underlying action 
selection and how these are affected by normal aging remain to be elucidated. In 
the present cross-sectional study, we studied processes of effector selection 
during a multilimb reaction time task in a lifespan sample of healthy human 
adults (N = 89; 20-75 years; 48 males, 41 females). Participants were instructed 
to react as quickly and accurately as possible to visually cued stimuli 
representing single-limb or combined upper and/or lower limb motions. Diffusion 
MRI was used to study structural connectivity between prefrontal and striatal 
regions as critical nodes for action selection. Behavioral findings revealed 
that increasing age was associated with slowing of action selection performance. 
At the neural level, aging had a negative impact on prefronto-striatal 
connectivity. Importantly, mediation analyses revealed that the negative 
association between action selection performance and age was mediated by 
prefronto-striatal connectivity, specifically the connections between left 
rostral medial frontal gyrus and left nucleus accumbens as well as right frontal 
pole and left caudate. These results highlight the potential role of 
prefronto-striatal white matter decline in poorer action selection performance 
of older adults.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT As a result of enhanced life expectancy, 
researchers have devoted increasing attention to the study of age-related 
alterations in cognitive and motor functions. Here we study associations between 
brain structure and behavior to reveal the impact of central neural white matter 
changes as a function of normal aging on action selection performance. We 
demonstrate the critical role of a reduction in prefronto-striatal structural 
connectivity in accounting for action selection performance deficits in healthy 
older adults. Preserving this cortico-subcortical pathway may be critical for 
behavioral flexibility and functional independence in older age.

Incidence and Predictors of Structural Valve Deterioration after Transcatheter 
Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

University, Chongqing 400010, China.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), widely used as an 
alternative therapy in patients with severe aortic stenosis, is expected to be 
offered to low-risk patents with a longer life expectancy. The durability of 
transcatheter aortic valve is becoming of increasing importance.
METHOD: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL from the inception to March 2020 
were systematically screened for studies reporting on structural valve 
deterioration (SVD) in TAVR patients. Incidence of SVD was diagnosed according 
to the latest European consensus as the primary end point. Predictors of SVD 
evaluated at multivariable analysis and cumulative incidence function (CIF) of 
SVD were the secondary end point.
RESULT: Twelve studies encompassing 10031 patients evaluating the incidence of 
SVD were included, with a follow-up between 1 and 8 years. The pooled incidence 
of SVD was 4.93% (95% CI, 2.75%-7.70%, I 2 = 96%) at 1 year and 8.97% (95% CI, 
6.89%-11.29%, I 2 = 86%) in the long term (≥5 years). Subgroup analysis was 
performed to identify the valve type that may result in partial heterogeneity. 
SVD was more frequent in patents with a valve diameter of <26 mm (HR: 3.57, 
1.47-8.69), oral anticoagulants (OAC), exposure at discharge (OR: 0.48, 
0.38-0.61), or by a disease of renal dysfunction (OR 1.42, 1.03-1.96).
CONCLUSION: SVD represents infrequent events after TAVR in the long term (>5 
years), occurring more commonly in renal dysfunction patients, with small valve 
diameter and without OAC exposure. There may be an underestimation of the 
incidence if we assume death as a competing risk.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, essential 
(primary) thrombocythemia (ET) is one of several Bcr-Abl negative chronic 
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). The classical term MPN covers the 
subcategories of MPN: ET, polycythemia vera (PV), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), 
and prefibrotic PMF (pPMF). ET is marked by clonal proliferation of 
hematopoietic stem cells, leading to a chronic overproduction of platelets. At 
the molecular level a JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2), calreticulin, or MPL mutation is 
found in the majority of patients. Typical ongoing complications of the disease 
include thrombosis and hemorrhage. Primary and secondary prevention of these 
complications can be achieved with platelet function inhibitors and various 
cytoreductive drugs including anagrelide, hydroxyurea and interferon. After a 
long follow up, in a minority of ET patients the disease transforms into post-ET 
myelofibrosis or secondary leukemia. Overall, life expectancy with ET is only 
slightly decreased.

BACKGROUND: Increasing age is a well-recognized risk factor for breast cancer. 
With an increase in life expectancy of women, more older patients are diagnosed 
with breast cancer. This study aimed to identify the variations in breast cancer 
attributes and mortality in different age groups in New Zealand.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of data from the Auckland Breast Cancer 
Register between 1 June 2000 and 28 February 2017. Patients who were diagnosed 
through Breast Screen were included. Group A included those aged between 45 and 
69 years. Group B included individuals with an age of 70 years or above.
RESULTS: From June 2000 to February 2017, a total of 6304 new cases of new 
breast cancer were diagnosed through Auckland Breast Screen, with 5788 patients 
in group A and 516 patients in group B. Group B was more likely to have the 
lower grade invasive cancers, with fewer grade 3 cancers. Oestrogen receptor 
positivity was more pronounced in group B, along with progesterone receptor 
positivity. Conversely, HER-2 receptor was less likely to be positive in group 
B. There was a significantly higher breast cancer-related mortality in group B 
(6.0% versus 2.7%). Mortality related to other causes was also much higher in 
group B as compared to that in group A (12.8% versus 2.5%).
CONCLUSION: Women aged 70 years or above generally tend to have a more 
favourable type of breast cancer, with a lower tumour grade, oestrogen and 
progesterone receptor positivity, and lower rate of HER-2 overexpression.

BACKGROUND: Traditionally, patients are encouraged to attend dental recall 
appointments at regular 6-month intervals, irrespective of their risk of 
developing dental disease. Stakeholders lack evidence of the relative 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different recall strategies and the 
optimal recall interval for maintenance of oral health.
OBJECTIVES: To test effectiveness and assess the cost-benefit of different 
dental recall intervals over a 4-year period.
DESIGN: Multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial with blinded 
clinical outcome assessment at 4 years and a within-trial cost-benefit analysis. 
NHS and participant perspective costs were combined with benefits estimated from 
a general population discrete choice experiment. A two-stratum trial design was 
used, with participants randomised to the 24-month interval if the recruiting 
dentist considered them clinically suitable. Participants ineligible for 
24-month recall were randomised to a risk-based or 6-month recall interval.
SETTING: UK primary care dental practices.
PARTICIPANTS: Adult, dentate, NHS patients who had visited their dentist in the 
previous 2 years.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to attend for a dental check-up at 
one of three dental recall intervals: 6-month, risk-based or 24-month recall.
MAIN OUTCOMES: Clinical - gingival bleeding on probing; patient - oral 
health-related quality of life; economic - three analysis frameworks: (1) 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained, (2) incremental net 
(societal) benefit and (3) incremental net (dental health) benefit.
RESULTS: A total of 2372 participants were recruited from 51 dental practices; 
648 participants were eligible for the 24-month recall stratum and 1724 
participants were ineligible. There was no evidence of a significant difference 
in the mean percentage of sites with gingival bleeding between intervention arms 
in any comparison. For the eligible for 24-month recall stratum: the 24-month 
(n = 138) versus 6-month group (n = 135) had an adjusted mean difference of 
-0.91 (95% confidence interval -5.02 to 3.20); the risk-based (n = 143) versus 
6-month group had an adjusted mean difference of -0.98 (95% confidence interval 
-5.05 to 3.09); the 24-month versus risk-based group had an adjusted mean 
difference of 0.07 (95% confidence interval -3.99 to 4.12). For the overall 
sample, the risk-based (n = 749) versus 6-month (n = 737) adjusted mean 
difference was 0.78 (95% confidence interval -1.17 to 2.72). There was no 
evidence of a difference in oral health-related quality of life between 
intervention arms in any comparison. For the economic evaluation, under 
framework 1 (cost per quality-adjusted life-year) the results were highly 
uncertain, and it was not possible to identify the optimal recall strategy. 
Under framework 2 (net societal benefit), 6-month recalls were the most 
efficient strategy with a probability of positive net benefit ranging from 78% 
to 100% across the eligible and combined strata, with findings driven by the 
high value placed on more frequent recall services in the discrete choice 
experiment. Under framework 3 (net dental health benefit), 24-month recalls were 
the most likely strategy to deliver positive net (dental health) benefit among 
those eligible for 24-month recall, with a probability of positive net benefit 
ranging from 65% to 99%. For the combined group, the optimal strategy was less 
clear. Risk-based recalls were more likely to be the most efficient recall 
strategy in scenarios where the costing perspective was widened to include 
participant-incurred costs, and in the Scottish subgroup.
LIMITATIONS: Information regarding factors considered by dentists to inform the 
risk-based interval and the interaction with patients to determine risk and 
agree the interval were not collected.
CONCLUSIONS: Over a 4-year period, we found no evidence of a difference in oral 
health for participants allocated to a 6-month or a risk-based recall interval, 
nor between a 24-month, 6-month or risk-based recall interval for participants 
eligible for a 24-month recall. However, people greatly value and are willing to 
pay for frequent dental check-ups; therefore, the most efficient recall strategy 
depends on the scope of the cost and benefit valuation that decision-makers wish 
to consider.
FUTURE WORK: Assessment of the impact of risk assessment tools in informing 
risk-based interval decision-making and techniques for communicating a variable 
recall interval to patients.

Plain Language Summary: Traditionally, dentists have encouraged both patients at 
low risk and patients at high risk of developing dental disease to attend their 
dental practices for regular 6-month ‘check-ups’. There is, however, little 
evidence available for either patients or dentists to use when deciding on the 
best dental recall interval (i.e. time between dental check-ups) for maintaining 
oral health. In this study, we wanted to find out, for adult patients who 
regularly attend the dentist, what interval of time between dental check-ups 
maintains optimum oral health and represents value for money. A total of 2372 
adults who regularly attended 51 different dental practices across Scotland, 
Northern Ireland, England and Wales were involved. Patients aged 18 years or 
over who received all or part of their care as NHS patients were randomly 
allocated to groups to receive a check-up either every 6 months, at an 
individualised recall interval based on their own risk of oral disease 
(risk-based recall), or every 24 months (if considered at low risk by their 
dentist). The recruited adults completed questionnaires at their first trial 
appointment and then every year of the 4-year study. Their attendance at recall 
appointments was recorded and they received a clinical assessment taken by study 
staff at the end of their involvement at year 4. After 4 years, there was no 
evidence of a difference in the oral health of patients allocated to a 6-month 
or variable risk-based recall interval. For patients considered by their 
dentists to be suitable for a 24-month recall interval, there was no difference 
between those in the 24-month, 6-month or risk-based recall intervals. However, 
people greatly value and are willing to pay for frequent dental check-ups. The 
recall strategy that offers the best value for money to patients and the NHS, 
therefore, depends on what people and decision-makers wish to value within a 
health-care system.

AIM: To identify the effects of different immunohistochemical features of 
glioblastomas with spinal metastases based on the metastatic spread and survival 
rate.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 214 patients who were diagnosed with and 
operated for brain tumor in our clinic between 2007 and 2018, and pathologically 
diagnosed with glioblastoma were retrospectively evaluated. Among them, 141 
medical records were reviewed, and 23 of them underwent spinal magnetic 
resonance imaging postoperatively due to various complaints.
RESULTS: All patients with glioblastoma with spinal metastases had negative 
isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH-1) in the immunohistochemical examination. The 
incidence of spinal metastasis is 1.91%. The median Ki-67 index is 30 (range, 
4-90; median Ki-67 index: 30+/-18.5). IDH mutation is wild in 55%, mutant in 
33%, and not otherwise specified in 12%. Four patients with spinal metastasis 
has wild-type IDH with mean Ki-67 index of 60, and one of them was a woman (25%) 
and the remaining three were men (%75), with mean age of 32 years.
CONCLUSION: Gliomas with high immunohistochemical proliferation indexes and 
wild-type IDH with poor prognostic features based on the new classification 
tended to metastasize to the spine in the early disease stage; therefore, early 
spinal scanning and radiation therapy might extend the life expectancy. High 
Ki-67 index and the presence of wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase may be the 
predictive factors for spinal screening.

BACKGROUND: Lung Cancer (LC) is one of the most common malign diseases 
worldwide. So far, it is unclear if the development of LC incidence and 
mortality leads to morbidity compression or expansion and whether these 
developments differ by socioeconomic characteristics. This study analyses time 
trends in social and gender inequalities in life years with and without LC in 
Germany.
METHODS: The study is based on data of a large German statutory health insurance 
provider (N = 2,511,790). Incidence and mortality risks were estimated from 
multistate survival models. Trends in life years with and without LC were 
analysed using multistate life table analyses. All analyses were performed 
separately for gender, time period (2006-2009 and 2014-2017), and income group 
(<60% and ≥60% of the German average income).
RESULTS: Among men, declining LC incidence rates resulted in gains of life years 
free of LC and declining LC- affected life years and led to a relative 
compression, which was strongest in men with higher incomes. Among women, a 
clear increase in life years with LC led to an expansion of the lifespan 
affected by LC. This expansion was mainly driven by increasing incidence rates 
in women with low incomes. Overall, income inequalities in LC increased in both 
genders.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses reveal that developments in the length of life 
affected by LC differed substantially by gender and income and led to widening 
health inequalities over time. Public health efforts should mainly focus on 
vulnerable groups to reduce the persisting social inequalities in LC.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of patients with hemophilia has advanced over the past 
decades, but it is unknown whether this has resulted in a normal life expectancy 
in the Netherlands.
OBJECTIVE: This observational cohort study aimed to assess all-cause and 
cause-specific mortality in patients with hemophilia in the Netherlands between 
2001 and 2018 and to compare mortality and life expectancy with previous 
survival assessments from 1973 onward.
PATIENTS/METHODS: All 1066 patients with hemophilia who participated in a 
nationwide survey in 2001 were followed until July 2018.
RESULTS: Information on 1031 individuals (97%) was available, of whom 142 (14%) 
deceased during follow-up. Compared with the general Dutch male population, 
mortality of patients with hemophilia was still increased (standardized 
mortality ratio: 1.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.2-1.7). Intracranial bleeding 
and malignancies were the most common causes of death. Estimated median life 
expectancy of patients with hemophilia was 77 years, 6 years lower than the 
median life expectancy of the general Dutch male population (83 years). Over the 
past 45 years, death rates of patients with hemophilia have consistently 
decreased, approaching the survival experience of the general population. Over 
the past decades, mortality due to human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C 
virus infections has decreased, death due to intracranial hemorrhages has 
increased, and death due to ischemic heart disease has remained consistently low 
over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival in patients with hemophilia in the Netherlands has 
improved over time but is still lower than that of the general population.

The substantial increase in life expectancy of men has focused growing attention 
on quality-of-life issues associated with reproductive aging. Serum total and 
free testosterone levels in men, after reaching a peak in the second and third 
decade of life, decline gradually with advancing age. The trajectory of 
age-related decline is affected by comorbid conditions, adiposity, medications, 
and genetic factors. Testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone 
levels improves overall sexual activity, sexual desire, and erectile function; 
improves areal and volumetric bone density, as well as estimated bone strength 
in the spine and the hip; corrects unexplained anemia of aging; increases 
skeletal muscle mass, strength and power, self-reported mobility, and some 
measures of physical function; and modestly improves depressive symptoms. The 
long-term effects of testosterone on major cardiovascular events and prostate 
cancer risk remain unclear. The Endocrine Society recommends against 
testosterone therapy of all older men with low testosterone levels but suggests 
consideration of treatment on an individualized basis in men who have 
consistently low testosterone levels and symptoms or conditions suggestive of 
testosterone deficiency.

Cortical microglia exhibit a ramified shape during sleep, while they have a 
hyper-ramified shape during wakefulness, which is characterized by their longer 
processes with increased branching points. The microglial molecular circadian 
clock regulates expressions of both cathepsin S (CatS) and P2Y12 receptors in 
the brain with a peak at zeitgeber time 14 (2 h after beginning of the dark 
phase). We postulated that these two microglia-specific molecules contribute to 
diurnal alterations of microglial shapes and neuronal activities in the cerebral 
cortex. During wakefulness, CatS secreted from cortical microglia may be 
involved in P2Y12 receptor-dependent process extension. Secreted CatS 
subsequently degrades the perineuronal nets, initiating the downscaling of both 
spine density and synaptic strength of cortical neurons toward the beginning of 
sleep. The downscaling of both spine density and synaptic strength of cortical 
neurons during sleep could improve signal-to-noise, which would benefit memory 
consolidation, or allow for new learning to occur during subsequent waking. 
Furthermore, disruption of CatS induces the sleep disturbance and impaired 
social interaction in mice. Moreover, the microglial clock system disruption may 
also play a role in the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The reduced 
expression of BMAL1 in cortical microglia caused by oligomeric amyloid β may 
induce the increased presence of inflammatory phenotype through a reduction in 
RORα, which in turn reduced IκBα and enhanced NF-κB activation. These 
observations suggest that the microglial clock system disruption contribute to 
pathogeneses of sleep disturbance, impaired social interaction and cognitive 
impairment. Therefore, the growing understanding of the microglial circadian 
molecular clock might aid in the development of novel pharmacological 
interventions against both neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: Selecting the best treatment for life-critical conditions via a 
shared decision making approach is a uniquely important challenge. Besides data 
from the healthcare physicians, other data that need to be considered are the 
personal values and perceptions of the patient. Usually, these data come in the 
form of health-state utility values. They are subjective and often times are 
elicited from the patient under emotional and stressful conditions. This paper 
examines an approach for selecting the best treatment under a life-critical 
shared decision making (SDM) framework.
METHODS: Health-state utility values are used in practice to quantify what is 
known as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and quality-adjusted life 
expectancy (QALE). The QALEs from different treatments are used to select the 
best treatment. This paper describes methods for determining QALEs under a range 
of scenarios defined by the way some key assumptions on the health-state utility 
values are satisfied. Approaches for comparing different treatments are 
described along with some counter-intuitive results. These approaches are based 
on some optimization formulations. The proposed approaches are demonstrated in 
terms of a real example taken from the literature.
RESULTS: Having results that are robust under a spectrum of different scenarios 
can provide more confidence that the most suitable treatment has been selected 
in a given case. On the other hand, having non-robust results can be useful 
information too as they may provide evidence that a more thorough assessment of 
the benefits and harms of the treatments may be needed to select a treatment 
with higher confidence. Finally, this study demonstrates that under certain 
mathematical conditions among the data it is possible to decide which treatment 
is better among two treatments without having to use health-state utility 
values.
CONCLUSION: The significance of this study is that it provides valuable and 
actionable insights for the important question of how health-state utilities can 
be used in treatment selection.

BACKGROUND: Predictors of treatment outcome in major depressive disorder (MDD) 
could contribute to evidence-based therapeutic choices. Combined pharmacotherapy 
and psychotherapy show increased efficacy but higher cost compared with 
antidepressant pharmacotherapy; baseline predictors of pharmacotherapy 
resistance could be used to identify patients more likely to benefit from 
combined treatment.
METHODS: We performed a proof-of-principle study of the cost-effectiveness of 
using previously identified pharmacogenetic and clinical risk factors (PGx-CL-R) 
of antidepressant resistance or clinical risk factors alone (CL-R) to guide the 
prescription of combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy vs pharmacotherapy. 
The cost-effectiveness of these two strategies was compared with standard care 
(ST, pharmacotherapy to all subjects) using a three-year Markov model. Model 
parameters were literature-based estimates of response to pharmacotherapy and 
combined treatment, costs (UK National Health System) and benefits 
(quality-adjusted life years [QALYs], one QALY=one year lived in perfect 
health).
RESULTS: CL-R was more cost-effective than PGx-CL-R: the cost of one-QALY 
improvement was £2341 for CL-R and £3937 for PGx-CL-R compared to ST. PGx-CL-R 
had similar or better cost-effectiveness compared to CL-R when 1) the cost of 
genotyping was £100 per subject or less or 2) the PGx-CL-R test had sensitivity 
≥ 0.90 and specificity ≥ 0.85. The cost of one-QALY improvement for CL-R was 
£3664 and of £4110 in two independent samples.
LIMITATIONS: lack of validation in large samples from the general population.
CONCLUSIONS: Using clinical risk factors to predict pharmacotherapy resistance 
and guide the prescription of pharmacotherapy combined with psychotherapy could 
be a cost-effective strategy.

INTRODUCTION: Ameloblastoma is a benign neoplasm of odontogenic origin with 
local invasive characteristics and a high recurrence rate. It compromised 1% of 
the jaw's cysts and tumors with only 10-15% in children.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 14-year-old boy sought treatment for a painless swelling 
involving the right side of the face started one year ago. The intra-oral 
examination displayed a firm mass associated with 46, 47 teeth, and the angle of 
the mandible. The radiographic examination revealed a large well-defined 
homogeneous radiolucency extending from the 46 region to involve the angle and 
extending towards the coronoid and condylar processes. An incisional biopsy 
confirmed the diagnosis of unicystic ameloblastoma. Treatment was planned 
according to the patient's age: Phase I: Surgical enucleation. Phase II: 
Construction and insertion of a surgical stent. Phase III: Construction of a 
transitional acrylic Kennedy class II partial denture. Phase IV: the patient is 
scheduled for a definitive implant-supported prosthesis at 18 years old.
DISCUSSION: The management of ameloblastoma is influenced by the age of the 
patient, the extension, duration, and position of the lesion, and the 
histopathological variants. Several authors recommended enucleation as a 
conservative treatment approach to eliminate the esthetical, functional, and 
psychological squeals associated with the radical approach. The use of a 
surgical stent protects the enucleated cavity and promote tissue healing.
CONCLUSION: Enucleation and subsequent surgical stent not only eliminates the 
disease, but also preserves the bone structure, prevents the facial 
disfigurement, and significantly improve the patient's esthetic, mastication, 
oral health, and quality of life.

BACKGROUND: The status of oral cancer therapy in elderly patients in Japan, 
where ageing is rapidly progressing, may serve as a model for other countries 
with similar demographics. There is controversy over what kind of treatment 
should be applied and how aggressively it should be applied to very elderly 
patients who have exceeded the average life expectancy. Given that 85 years is 
approximately the overall Japanese life expectancy at birth, we considered a 
threshold of 85 years and hypothesized that the prognosis of oral squamous cell 
carcinoma (SCC) patients aged ≥85 years was not inferior to that of those 
< 85 years. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical 
characteristics, treatment methods, and prognoses of Japanese oral SCC patients 
aged ≥85 years.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed. The data of patients with 
primary oral SCC (n = 358) from 2005 to 2018 in our institute were extracted 
from electronic medical records. A total of 358 patients with oral SCC were 
divided into two groups (≥85 years group [n = 26] and < 85 years group 
[n = 332]) based on the age threshold of 85 years at the first visit. 
Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazard models were used to 
analyse overall survival (OS) and hazard ratios (HRs) according to age group, 
treatment, and TNM classification.
RESULTS: There was no difference in the 5-year OS rate between the ≥85 years 
and < 85 years groups (80.8% vs. 82.2%, P = 0.359). This finding was the same in 
the operative (94.7% vs. 85.8%, P = 0.556) and non-operative (42.9% vs. 33.2%, 
P = 0.762) groups, indicating that age did not affect prognosis. Mortality was 
lower in the operative group than in the non-operative group (adjusted HR: 
0.276, 95% CI: 0.156-0.489, P < 0.001), suggesting that surgery is a superior 
method. However, non-surgical treatment was selected at a higher rate in the 
≥85 years group (26.9% vs. 11.1%, P = 0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the prognosis of ≥85-year-old patients was not 
inferior to that of < 85-year-old patients. We recommend that surgery as the 
first choice treatment for ≥85-year-old patients with oral SCC who can tolerate 
surgery should be performed.

INTRODUCTION: Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is reported to impair quality of life, 
physical and functional ability of patients. Rehabilitation and physical therapy 
is usually proposed to improve AS patient clinical conditions. Besides, an 
osteopathic management has not been extensively studied in the field of 
inflammatory diseases. = OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of osteopathic 
approach in addition to conventional rehabilitation management on clinical and 
functional outcomes among patients with AS.
EQUIPMENT AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with AS were recruited to participate 
to a physical therapy and rehabilitation (PTR) program over an 18-week period. 
They were randomly allocated into two groups to complete PTR only or PTR 
combined with osteopathic management without manipulative techniques (OSTEO 
group). Thoracolumbar maximal isometric strength (for flexion, extension, 
lateroflexion, and axial rotation) and flexibility, functional index, pain 
intensity and quality of life (self-assessment questionnaires) were assessed 
before and after the protocol.
RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed for the OSTEO group in strength, 
flexibility, disease activity and pain compared to the PTR group. However the 
difference between groups did not reach statistical significance for all the 
post-intervention measures. No significant correlation was found between 
functional, disability data or pain intensity and disease duration for both 
groups.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that osteopathic management in addition to a 
physical therapy and rehabilitation program may be beneficial for individuals
