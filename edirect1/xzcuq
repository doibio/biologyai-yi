BACKGROUND/AIM: Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has been approved for treating 
chronic hepatitis B (CHB) due to a proposed better safety profile in comparison 
with current therapies. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of TAF and other 
available treatment options for hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg)-positive 
and HBeAg-negative CHB patients from a Canadian provincial Ministry of Health 
perspective.
METHODS: A state-transition model based on the published literature was 
developed to compare treatment strategies involving entecavir (ETV), tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and TAF. It adopted a lifetime time horizon. Outcomes 
measured were predicted number of liver-related deaths, costs, quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: For HBeAg-positive patients, TAF followed by ETV generated an 
additional 0.16 QALYs/person at an additional cost of Can$14,836.18 with an ICER 
of Can$94,142.71/QALY compared with TDF followed by ETV. Of the iterations, 
28.7% showed that it is the optimal strategy with a Can$50,000 
willingness-to-pay threshold. For HBeAg-negative patients, ETV followed by TAF 
would prevent an additional 13 liver-related deaths per 1000 CHB patients 
compared with TDF, followed by ETV. It generated an additional 0.13 QALYs/person 
at an additional cost of Can$59,776.53 with an ICER of Can$461,162.21/QALY 
compared with TDF, followed by ETV. TAF-containing strategies are unlikely to be 
a rational choice in either case. The results were sensitive to the HBeAg 
seroconversion rates and viral suppression rates of the treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that TAF is not cost effective at its current 
cost. A 33.4% reduction in price would be required to make it cost effective for 
HBeAg-positive patients with a Can$50,000 willingness-to-pay threshold.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP1-32) exerts 
vasorelaxing and cardioprotective activity. BNP is used as a biomarker for the 
diagnosis of cardiopathological conditions and recombinant BNP1-32 as a drug for 
the treatment of such. BNP1-32 has a short half-life and thus, similar to other 
vasoactive peptides like angiotensin II and bradykinin, can be enzymatically 
truncated forming bioactive metabolites. We aimed to investigate the metabolism 
of BNP1-32 in the mouse lung, to identify potential new BNP metabolites and to 
disclose their biological activity compared to the BNP1-32, in vitro and in 
vivo.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Using HPLC and MS, we identified a new BNP metabolite, 
BNP1-30, in the lung being generated by endothelin-converting enzyme-1.
KEY RESULTS: BNP1-30 is more efficient in stimulating the guanylyl cyclase (GC) 
receptor A and, in contrast to BNP1-32, is also able to profoundly stimulate the 
GC-B. In vivo, BNP1-30 reduced the mean arterial BP of normotensive mice after 
acute infusion significantly more than BNP1-32. In a model of severe 
hypertension, a 3-day infusion of BNP1-30 was able to reduce systolic BP by 30 
mmHg and to improve markers of heart failure, while BNP1-32 was without 
significant effect.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results suggest that BNP1-32 is the precursor 
for the biologically more active BNP1-30 leading to a fundamental extension of 
the natriuretic peptide system. Due to expanded activity, BNP1-30 might be a 
promising treatment option for cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, its potency 
as a new diagnostic marker of specific cardiac diseases should be evaluated.

OBJECTIVE: Polypharmacy is frequent among older cancer patients and increases 
the risk of potential drug-related problems (DRPs). DRPs are associated with 
adverse drug events, drug-drug interactions and hospitalisations. Since no 
standardised polypharmacy assessment methods for oncology patients exist, we 
aimed to develop one that can be integrated into routine care.
METHODS: Based on the Systematic Tool to Reduce Inappropriate Prescribing 
(STRIP), we developed OncoSTRIP, which includes a polypharmacy anamnesis, a 
concise geriatric assessment, a polypharmacy analysis taking life expectancy 
into account and an optimised treatment plan. Patients ≥65 years with ≥5 chronic 
drugs visiting our outpatient oncology clinic were eligible for the polypharmacy 
assessment.
RESULTS: OncoSTRIP was integrated into routine care of our older cancer 
patients. In 47 of 60 patients (78%), potential DRPs (n = 101) were found. In 
total, 85 optimisations were recommended, with an acceptance rate of 41%. It was 
possible to reduce the number of potential DRPs by 41% and the number of 
patients with at least one potential DRP by 30%. Mean time spent per patient was 
71 min.
CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy assessment of older cancer patients identifies many 
pharmacotherapeutic optimisations. With OncoSTRIP, polypharmacy assessments can 
be integrated into routine care.

The purpose of this research is to find design variables effective on education 
integration with physical spaces of nursing homes in association with life 
expectancy of older people. Delphi technique was used to obtain the design 
variables by which the education integration with physical spaces of nursing 
homes can be achieved. Subsequently, in order to investigate the modifying 
effect of education integrated physical space on life expectancy of the elderly, 
questionnaires were sent to 50 local researchers and experts in the field of 
ageing. Results showed a significant and positive correlation between education 
integrated physical space and life expectancy indicators (p < .05). The results 
suggest that as per expert opinions, designing a physical space integrated with 
education could increase the life expectancy of older people.

Aim: Olaparib monotherapy improves progression-free survival in patients with 
metastatic breast cancer and BRCA1/2 mutations. We evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of BRCA1/2 mutation profiling to target olaparib use. 
Methods: A Markov cohort model was generated to compare the 5-year 
cost-effectiveness of BRCA1/2 mutation profiling to target olaparib use. 
Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of BRCA1/2 mutation profiling 
plus olaparib monotherapy was JPY14,677,259/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
(US$131,047/QALY), compared with standard chemotherapy alone. Conclusion:BRCA1/2 
mutation profiling to target olaparib use is not a cost-effective strategy for 
metastatic breast cancer. The strategy provides minimal incremental benefit at a 
high incremental cost per QALY. Hence, further cost reductions in the cost of 
both BRCA1/2 mutation profiling and olaparib are required.

The prevalence of several diseases increases by age, including cardiovascular 
diseases, which are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 
Aging, as a complex process characterized by senescence, triggers various 
pathways, such as oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, metabolism 
dysfunction, telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction and deregulated 
autophagy. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying senescence may 
lead to the development of new therapeutic targets and strategies for 
age-related pathologies and extend the healthy lifespan. Modulating lifestyle 
risk factors and adopting healthy dietary patterns remain significant tools in 
delaying the aging process, decreasing age-associated comorbidities and 
mortality, increasing life expectancy and consequently, preventing the 
development of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, such a strategy represents 
the most cost-effective approach, and the quality of life of the subjects may be 
significantly improved. An integrated, personalized approach targeting 
cardiometabolic aging and frailty is suggested in daily clinical practice. 
However, it should be initiated from an early age. Moreover, there is a need for 
further well designed and controlled studies in order to elucidate a link 
between the time of feeding, longevity and cardiovascular prevention. In the 
future, it is expected that the pharmacological treatment in cardioprotective 
management will be necessary, accompanied by equally important lifestyle 
interventions and adjunctive exercise.

INTRODUCTION: As the life expectancy and weight of patients are increasing, more 
old and obese patients are undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). TKA may 
lead to several perioperative complications. These include anesthesia-related 
risks, exacerbation of comorbid medical issues and complications of surgical 
procedure. We have no studies reporting medical complications following TKA 
among our population. This study aimed to evaluate perioperative complications 
of TKA and to identify the related risk factors.
METHODS: It was a monocentric retrospective including 410 observations in the 
local TKA registry. Data of patients operated for primary unilateral TKA during 
the period from January 2014 to December 2017 were reviewed. All patients had 
standardized protocols of anesthesia and post operative care for three days 
following surgery. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the 
predicting factors for complications.
RESULTS: Incidence of perioperative complications was 37.1%. The most frequent 
were per operative hypotension (14.1%) and postoperative desaturation (21.7%, 
including pulmonary embolism in 2.4%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
identified: age ≥ 65 years (OR=1.9; p=0.006), respiratory diseases (OR=1.8; 
p=0.042) and general anesthesia (OR=2.8; p=0.009) as significant risk factors 
for any complications. Loss of autonomy (OR=4.8; p <0.001) and general 
anesthesia (OR=2.6; p=0.03) were significant risk factors for hypotension. Age ≥ 
65 years (OR=2.6;p<0.001), female gender (OR=4.3;p=0.006) and respiratory 
diseases(OR=1.9;p=0.02) were associated with postoperative desaturation.
CONCLUSION: This study highlighted hemodynamic and respiratory complications as 
the most common early complications in TKA. Age ≥ 65years, general anesthesia 
and respiratory diseases were significant risk factors.

Despite recent studies elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying cortical 
patterning and map formation, very little is known about how the embryonic 
pallium expands ventrally to form the future cortex and the nature of the 
underlying force-generating events. We find that neurons born at embryonic day 
10 (E10) in the mouse dorsal pallium ventrally stream until E13, thereby 
superficially spreading the preplate, and then constitute the subplate from E14. 
From E11 to E12, the preplate neurons migrate, exerting pulling and pushing 
forces at the process and the soma, respectively. At E13, they are 
morphologically heterogeneous, with ∼40% possessing corticofugal axons, which 
are found to be in tension. Ablation of these E10-born neurons attenuates both 
deflection of radial glial fibers (by E13) and extension of the cortical plate 
(by E14), which should occur ventrally, and subsequently shrinks the postnatal 
neocortical map dorsally. Thus, the preplate stream physically primes 
neocortical expansion and arealization.

In the context of todays ageing population, this paper uses the connectedness 
network model proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz in 2014 to analyse the 
directionality and degree of interaction between the population ageing index, 
life expectancy, per capita gross domestic product, and per capita health 
expenditure from a systematic perspective for China; then, these results from 
China are compared with the United States. A number of new findings can be 
identified, as follows: (1) for China and the United States, economic growth may 
promote the growth of health expenditure and increased life expectancy may cause 
an increase in the ageing population; (2) China's population age structure has 
already led to some constraints on economic growth, whereas the United 
StatesUS's population age structure has had a weak impact on its economic 
growth; and (3) the ageing population structure for China has a net impact on 
per capita health expenditure, whereas no such net directional impact was found 
in the United States. These findings support the idea that policy synergies 
should be strengthened in the economic, social, and health fields in order to 
promote both the quality of life of the ageing population and the sustainable 
development of the economy.

Endometrial cancer is the commonest gynecological cancer, with an incidence 
predicted to escalate by a further 50-100% before 2025, due to the rapid rise in 
risk factors such as obesity and increased life expectancy. Endometrial cancer 
associated mortality is also rising, depicting the need for translatable 
research to improve our understanding of the disease. Rapid translation of 
scientific discoveries will facilitate the development of new diagnostic, 
prognostic and therapeutic strategies. Biobanks play a vital role in providing 
biospecimens with accompanying clinical data for personalized translational 
research. Wide variation in collection, and pre-analytic variations in 
processing and storage of bio-specimens result in divergent and irreproducible 
data from multiple studies that are unsuitable for collation to formulate robust 
conclusions. Harmonization of biobanking standards is thus vital, in 
facilitating international multi-center collaborative studies with valuable 
outcomes to improve personalized treatments. This review will detail the 
pitfalls in the biobanking of biosamples from women with cancer in general, and 
describe the recent international harmonization project that developed 
standardized research tools to overcome these challenges and to enhance 
endometrial cancer research, which will facilitate future development of 
personalized novel diagnostic strategies and treatments.

Quadriceps neuromuscular function remains impaired in the short- and long-term 
following knee arthroscopy for meniscal surgery and/or anterior cruciate 
ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The aim of this study was to compare quadriceps 
neuromuscular impairments in patients following meniscal surgery with and 
without ACL reconstruction. Thirty patients were tested six months after 
meniscal surgery with (n = 15) and without (n = 15) ACL reconstruction. We 
bilaterally assessed knee extension maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque 
using dynamometry, vastus lateralis thickness using ultrasound, quadriceps 
voluntary activation and evoked knee extension torque with transcutaneous 
electrical stimulation. Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated with the Knee 
Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Compared with meniscus patients, 
ACL patients demonstrated larger asymmetries in MVC torque (15% vs. 5%, p = 
0.049) and vastus lateralis thickness (6% vs. 0%, p = 0.021). In ACL patients, 
asymmetries in MVC torque correlated with asymmetries in evoked torque (r = 
0.622, p = 0.013). In meniscus patients, asymmetries in muscle activation 
correlated with KOOS quality of life (r = 0.619, p = 0.018). Patients 
demonstrated persistent quadriceps muscle weakness six months after ACL 
reconstruction, but not after isolated meniscal surgery. Quantitative and/or 
qualitative muscular changes likely underlie quadriceps muscle weakness in ACL 
patients, whereas activation failure is associated with poor quality of life in 
some meniscus patients.

INTRODUCTION: Anticoagulant therapy in patients with cancer with venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) increases the risk of both VTE recurrence and haemorrhagic 
complication. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been shown to be effective 
in preventing VTE recurrence, and comparable to conventional therapy in 
preventing VTE recurrence in patients with advanced cancer. Rivaroxaban is a 
DOAC that causes thrombus regression, possibly through a profibrinolytic effect. 
Thrombus regression with initial treatment is essential for VTE patients. 
However, the thrombolytic effect of DOAC for VTE patients with cancer has not 
been fully examined. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the thrombolytic 
effect of rivaroxaban in patients with cancer who develop VTE.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a single-arm, open-label, prospective 
interventional study. Forty patients aged from 20 to 75 years old at the time of 
consent who have been diagnosed with acute VTE and have active cancer are 
included. Patients are excluded if they have received thrombolytic therapy, have 
creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min, have expected a life expectancy of 
less than 6 months or have deep vein thrombosis limited to the distal lower leg. 
Eligible patients receive standard treatment with rivaroxaban (15 mg two times 
daily for 3 weeks, followed by 15 mg QD). The primary study endpoint is clot 
regression ratio as evaluated by contrast-enhanced CT imaging. CT imaging is 
obtained at baseline, 21±4 and 90±14 days after the start of rivaroxaban 
treatment. Secondary endpoints are the recurrence of VTE and haemorrhagic 
complications.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the institutional review 
board of the Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine. Study results will be 
disseminated through peer-reviewed journals.Trial registration 
numberUMIN000027793.

The pharmacokinetic properties of antibodies are largely dictated by the 
pH-dependent binding of the IgG fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain to the human 
neonatal Fc receptor (hFcRn). Engineered Fc domains that confer a longer 
circulation half-life by virtue of more favorable pH-dependent binding to hFcRn 
are of great therapeutic interest. Here we developed a pH Toggle switch Fc 
variant containing the L309D/Q311H/N434S (DHS) substitutions, which exhibits 
markedly improved pharmacokinetics relative to both native IgG1 and widely used 
half-life extension variants, both in conventional hFcRn transgenic mice and in 
new knock-in mouse strains. engineered specifically to recapitulate all the key 
processes relevant to human antibody persistence in circulation, namely: (i) 
physiological expression of hFcRn, (ii) the impact of hFcγRs on antibody 
clearance and (iii) the role of competing endogenous IgG. DHS-IgG retains intact 
effector functions, which are important for the clearance of target pathogenic 
cells and also has favorable developability.

Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), the most severe form of T-cell 
immunodeficiency, can be screened at birth by quantifying T-cell receptor 
excision circles (TRECs) in dried blood spot (DBS) samples. Early detection of 
this condition speeds up the establishment of appropriate treatment and 
increases the patient's life expectancy. Newborn screening for SCID started in 
January 2017 in Catalonia, the first Spanish and European region to universally 
include this testing. The results obtained in the first 2 years of experience 
are evaluated here. All babies born between January 2017 and December 2018 were 
screened. TREC quantification in DBS (1.5 mm diameter) was performed with the 
Enlite Neonatal TREC kit from PerkinElmer (Turku, Finland). In 2018, the retest 
cutoff in the detection algorithm was updated based on the experience gained in 
the first year, and changed from 34 to 24 copies/μL. This decreased the retest 
rate from 3.34 to 1.4% (global retest rate, 2.4%), with a requested second 
sample rate of 0.23% and a positive detection rate of 0.02%. Lymphocyte 
phenotype (T, B, NK populations), expression of CD45RA/RO isoforms, percentage 
and intensity of TCR αβ and TCR γδ, presence of HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes, and in 
vitro lymphocyte proliferation were studied in all patients by flow cytometry. 
Of 130,903 newborns screened, 30 tested positive, 15 of which were male. During 
the study period, one patient was diagnosed with SCID: incidence, 1 in 130,903 
births in Catalonia. Thirteen patients had clinically significant T-cell 
lymphopenia (non-SCID) with an incidence of 1 in 10,069 newborns (43% of 
positive detections). Nine patients were considered false-positive cases because 
of an initially normal lymphocyte count with normalization of TRECs between 3 
and 6 months of life, four infants had transient lymphopenia due to an initially 
low lymphocyte count with recovery in the following months, and three patients 
are still under study. The results obtained provide further evidence of the 
benefits of including this disease in newborn screening programs. Longer 
follow-up is needed to define the exact incidence of SCID in Catalonia.

Multi-planar transverse, U-type, and vertical sacral fractures occur from high 
energy trauma or as pathologic fractures and often have associated neurologic 
and extremity injuries. Modern treatment algorithms fall into two broad 
categories: 1) percutaneous posterior pelvic fixation (iliosacral or 
transiliac-transsacral screws) or 2) lumbopelvic fixation. Posterior pelvic 
screw fixation is minimally invasive but typically requires restricted weight 
bearing until fracture union. In many cases, lumbopelvic fixation allows for a 
closed reduction and provides stability to allow full weight bearing immediately 
after surgery; however, this fixation is often removed in a second surgery after 
fracture healing. Lumbopelvic fixation was originally described as an open 
procedure, minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation is a recent variation and has 
shown promising results with less morbidity. We present a case series of 
unstable U-type sacral fractures treated with minimally invasive lumbopelvic 
fixation with staged hardware removal to illustrate the advantages and 
complications associated with this new technique. Ten patients with U-type 
sacral fractures underwent minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation from 2016 to 
2019. Six patients underwent scheduled hardware removal an average of 3.5 (range 
1.9-5.5) months after index surgery. Two patients did not undergo hardware 
removal due to short life expectancy and diagnosis of pathologic fractures. One 
patient was lost to follow-up. One patient had failed fracture reduction and 
went on to sacral malunion that required a late sacral extension osteotomy to 
restore her ability to stand upright. Final disposition of all nine patients 
with follow-up was normal standing upright posture and normal ambulation without 
assistive device. There were no late displacements on postoperative upright 
radiographs. Complex sacral fractures are a challenging injury that can be 
treated with percutaneous posterior pelvic or lumbopelvic fixation. Lumbopelvic 
fixation offers the advantages of closed reduction to restore pelvic incidence 
and immediate weight bearing but has greater surgical morbidity than 
percutaneous posterior pelvic fixation and often requires hardware removal. The 
morbidity of lumbopelvic fixation may be reduced with minimally invasive 
techniques. Minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation is a treatment option to be 
considered for complex sacral fractures.

Increasing life expectancy leading to a higher median age causes an increasing 
need for healthcare resources, which is aggravated by an increasing prevalence 
of preventable diseases such as type 2 diabetes. This includes increasing 
expenditures for medicines, although these increases when expressed as a share 
of overall societal wealth are more moderate than often claimed. An increasing 
use of generic medicines (currently about 90% of all prescriptions) means that 
costs for discovery and development of innovative drugs must be recovered on a 
shrinking percentage of prescriptions. However, the key challenge to affordable 
drugs is exponentially increasing costs to bring a new medicine to the market, 
which in turn are largely driven by an about 90% attrition rate after start of 
clinical development. While many factors will be required in concert to keep 
innovative medicines affordable, reducing attrition appears to be the factor 
with the greatest potential to contain escalating drug development costs and 
thereby medication expenditures.

IMPORTANCE: Otosclerosis can be managed through surgical treatment, such as 
stapedectomy, or through hearing amplification with hearing aids. To our 
knowledge, there has been no cost-effectiveness analysis of these 2 treatment 
methods.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of stapedectomy vs hearing aid 
use for the treatment of otosclerosis.
DESIGN AND SETTING: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, a decision tree was 
built to model the treatment choices for otosclerosis. The tree was run as a 
Markov model of a case patient aged 30 years. The model spanned the patient's 
lifetime to determine total costs of management of otosclerosis with 
stapedectomy or hearing aids. Cost-effectiveness was measured using an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, with a willingness to pay of $50 000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) considered cost-effective. One-way sensitivity 
analyses were performed for all variables. A 2-way sensitivity analysis was 
performed for the cost of stapedectomy vs the cost of hearing aids. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the likelihood 
that stapedectomy would be cost-effective across a range of model inputs.
INTERVENTIONS: Stapedectomy vs hearing aid use.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary objective of this study was to determine 
the cost-effectiveness of stapedectomy vs hearing aids in the treatment of 
otosclerosis. The secondary objectives were to determine which factors are 
associated with the cost-effectiveness of the interventions.
RESULTS: Stapedectomy had an estimated lifetime cost of $19 417.95, while 
hearing aids had an average lifetime cost of $16 439.94. Stapedectomy also had a 
benefit of 16.58 QALYs, and hearing aids had a benefit of 15.82 QALYs. 
Stapedectomy increases lifetime costs by $2978.01, with a benefit of 0.76 QALYs 
compared with hearing aids. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 
stapedectomy is $3918.43 per QALY. The model was sensitive to the cost of 
stapedectomy and the cost of stapedectomy revision surgery. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis showed that stapedectomy was cost-effective compared with 
hearing aids 99.98% of the time.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Stapedectomy appears to be a cost-effective option 
for treating otosclerosis compared with hearing aid use, from the patient 
perspective.

OBJECTIVE: To identify and describe the various economic evaluation studies in 
Malaysia and to determine the range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) as reported in these studies.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of the scientific electronic databases was 
conducted (Medline, EBM Reviews, Embase, and hand search) to identify all 
published economic evaluation studies related to Malaysian healthcare. Two 
researchers assessed the quality of selected studies using the Critical 
Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist and Quality of Health Economic 
Studies instrument. The assessment was also reviewed by expert members of the 
Technical Advisory Committee of Health Technology Economic Evaluations 
(TACHTEE).
RESULTS: A total of 64 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 
included in this systematic review. Thirty studies were partial economic 
evaluations; the full economic evaluations included 17 cost-effectiveness 
analyses and 17 cost-utility analyses. From all the reported ICERs, the majority 
(68%) were categorized as highly cost-effective (ICER of less than 1 gross 
domestic product (GDP) per capita per quality-adjusted life-years or 
disability-adjusted life-years gained).
CONCLUSION: This review identifies information gaps and loopholes in health 
economics research in Malaysia. Additionally, this study provides the 
information that the majority of published interventions in Malaysia fell within 
the cost-effectiveness threshold of 1 GDP per capita per quality-adjusted 
life-years or disability-adjusted life-years gained.
