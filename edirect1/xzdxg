BACKGROUND: Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI), a public health problem, 
affects 1-3.7% of women under 40 yielding infertility and a shorter lifespan. 
Most causes are unknown. Recently, genetic causes were identified, mostly in 
single families. We studied an unprecedented large cohort of POI to unravel its 
molecular pathophysiology.
METHODS: 375 patients with 70 families were studied using targeted (88 genes) or 
whole exome sequencing with pathogenic/likely-pathogenic variant selection. 
Mitomycin-induced chromosome breakages were studied in patients' lymphocytes if 
necessary.
FINDINGS: A high-yield of 29.3% supports a clinical genetic diagnosis of POI. In 
addition, we found strong evidence of pathogenicity for nine genes not 
previously related to a Mendelian phenotype or POI: ELAVL2, NLRP11, CENPE, 
SPATA33, CCDC150, CCDC185, including DNA repair genes: C17orf53(HROB), HELQ, 
SWI5 yielding high chromosomal fragility. We confirmed the causal role of BRCA2, 
FANCM, BNC1, ERCC6, MSH4, BMPR1A, BMPR1B, BMPR2, ESR2, CAV1, SPIDR, RCBTB1 and 
ATG7 previously reported in isolated patients/families. In 8.5% of cases, POI is 
the only symptom of a multi-organ genetic disease. New pathways were identified: 
NF-kB, post-translational regulation, and mitophagy (mitochondrial autophagy), 
providing future therapeutic targets. Three new genes have been shown to affect 
the age of natural menopause supporting a genetic link.
INTERPRETATION: We have developed high-performance genetic diagnostic of POI, 
dissecting the molecular pathogenesis of POI and enabling personalized medicine 
to i) prevent/cure comorbidities for tumour/cancer susceptibility genes that 
could affect life-expectancy (37.4% of cases), or for genetically-revealed 
syndromic POI (8.5% of cases), ii) predict residual ovarian reserve (60.5% of 
cases). Genetic diagnosis could help to identify patients who may benefit from 
the promising in vitro activation-IVA technique in the near future, greatly 
improving its success in treating infertility.

This study reports first time investigation on efficacy of cajuput essential oil 
loaded chitosan nanoparticle (CjEO-CSNP) on shelf-life of white button mushroom 
(Agaricus bisporus) stored at 4±1 °C for 7-days. CjEO-CSNP was characterized 
through scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and dynamic light 
scattering. The nanoparticles exhibited spherical shapes with average particle 
size 43.17-97.03 nm. The nanoencapsulation efficiency and loading capacity were 
ranged between 45.86 and 92.26% and 0.69-8.87%, respectively. The release study 
confirmed that CjEO-CSNP showed biphasic release patterns at different pH. 
Positive results were unveiled when the effect of CjEO-CSNP on shelf-life of 
mushroom was validated by analyzing the visual appearance and firmness. Further, 
CjEO-CSNP prevented weight loss and respiration rate, and improved the 
antioxidant activity of mushrooms. CjEO-CSNP also exhibited high safety profile 
(LD50= > 1200 mg/Kg body weight) without altering the sensory quality of coated 
mushrooms. Overall, CjEO-CSNP might be used as promising candidate to lengthen 
the shelf-life of button mushroom.

Erratum in
    Neuropsychopharmacology. 2022 Nov 29;:

SEP-383856 (SEP-856) is a novel antipsychotic under clinical development. It 
displays a unique pattern of receptor interaction, with only weak (partial 
agonist) activity at dopamine D2 receptors, yet more potent agonist activity at 
the trace amine associated receptor (TAAR1) and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1 A receptor 
(5-HT1A). Nonetheless, these observations await independent confirmation and 
more detailed characterization of the in vitro and in vivo actions of SEP-856 at 
TAAR1 and 5-HT1A receptors would be instructive. Herein, we employed 
luminescence complementation technology in heterologous live cell systems, 
confocal microscopy, voltage clamp electrophysiology, behavioral readouts and 
TAAR1 knockout (KO) mice to study SEP-856 in further detail. We provide evidence 
for the ability of SEP-856 to activate TAAR1 at the surface plasma membrane, and 
show that this interaction results in Gαs recruitment (pEC50: 6.08 ± 0.22 EMAX: 
96.41% ± 15.26) and by extension, to G-protein inwardly rectifying potassium 
(GIRK) channel activation. Using TAAR1-KO mice, we find TAAR1 to be 
indispensable for SEP-856 control of body temperature, baseline locomotion 
reduction and for "antipsychotic-like" efficacy as characterized by a reversal 
of dizocilipine (MK-801) mediated disruption of pre-pulse inhibition. 
Conversely, the inhibition by SEP-856 of MK-801 induced locomotion was 
unaffected in TAAR1 KO mice. SEP-856 behaved as a low-potency, partial agonist 
at the 5-HT1A receptor, while it partially inhibited recruitment of D2 
receptor-coupled Gα and GIRK by DA and acted as a weak partial agonist with low 
potency at the same receptor when applied alone. Our findings corroborate and 
extend previous observations on the molecular substrates engaged by this unique, 
dual TAAR1/5-HT1A receptor agonist and potential antipsychotic that could prove 
to have major advantages in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic 
disorders.

Iran is situated at the junctions of the Palaearctic and Oriental 
zoogeographical Regions, and the Caspian, Baluchi and Irano-Turanian floral 
zones, so it has a very diverse scale insect fauna. Scale insects (Hemiptera: 
Coccomorpha) are economically important in forestry, agriculture and 
horticulture. This taxonomic work on the mealybugs (Pseudococcidae and 
Rhizoecidae) and Putoidae of Iran is the second of three parts planned to cover 
all the scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccomorpha) in the country. It provides a 
resource for accurate laboratory identification of all the species known to 
occur in Iran or that are likely to be found there. Keys to the genera and 
species of mealybug found in Iran29 genera and 62 species of Pseudococcidae, and 
one genus and one species in each of the families Rhizoecidae and Putoidaeare 
provided. Detailed line drawings of all the species are given to facilitate 
identification. These are accompanied by detailed descriptions, distribution 
data, information on natural enemies, economic importance and host-plants 
recorded in Iran. The main purpose of the work is to provide agricultural staff 
concerned with pest control and quarantine inspection in Iran with a reliable 
means of species identification. The species Dysmicoccus walkeri (Newstead), 
Peliococcus marrubii (Kiritshenko) and Phenacoccus transcaucasicus Hadzibejli 
are recorded for the first time from Iran, and Artemicoccus poacearum Moghaddam 
Watson sp. n. and Spilococcus williamsi Moghaddam Watson sp. n. are described.

INTRODUCTION: The pivotal efficacy study assessed efficacy and safety of GSK's 
AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine in Chinese women aged 18-25 years up to 6 years. The 
present extension study, performed 4 years later, offered AS04-HPV-16/18 
vaccination to placebo recipients. Vaccine safety and its long-term protective 
effect were assessed at Year 10.
METHODS: All 6051 women who received AS04-HPV-16/18 or the placebo during the 
initial study (NCT00779766) were invited to phase III/IV, open-label, partially 
controlled extension Year 10 study (NCT03629886). Placebo recipients were 
offered three-dose AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccination and followed up over 12 months to 
assess the safety. Cervical samples from all women were examined. Vaccine 
efficacy (VE) against incident infections and cytological lesions associated 
with HPV-16/18 and other oncogenic types was assessed as exploratory objective.
RESULTS: Among 3537 women (out of 6051) enrolled in the extension study, 1791 
women (mean age 32.7 years; standard deviation 1.8 years) received 
AS04-HPV-16/18 and reported no serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated 
diseases, or adverse pregnancy outcomes related to vaccination. Among 6051 
women, VE against incident HPV-16, -18, and -16/18 infections up to Year 10 was 
82.8% (95% confidence interval: 72.5-89.7), 79.8% (64.5-89.2), and 80.8% 
(72.4-87.0), respectively. VE against HPV-16/18 ASC-US+, CIN1+, and CIN2+ was 
92.7% (82.2-97.7), 94.8% (67.4-99.9), and 90.5% (34.6-99.8), respectively.
CONCLUSION: AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine showed an acceptable safety profile in 
Chinese women vaccinated at age 26 years or above, and a long-term protection 
similar to other efficacy trials worldwide.

Background: People living with HIV or AIDS in resource-limited settings are 
faced with challenges in their nutrition and micronutrient levels. This study 
aimed to determine the effect of nutrition education on the nutrition status and 
serum zinc level of HIV and AIDS clients, and its implication for HIV care in 
resource-limited settings.Methods: This intervention study was conducted among 
HIV clients at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital and Enugu State 
University Teaching Hospital, which served as the intervention and control 
groups respectively. A nutrition education programme was delivered to the 
intervention group. In both groups, before and after the intervention, the body 
mass index of participants was calculated using their height (m2) and weight 
(kg) while their serum zinc levels were analysed using spectrophotometry. 
Chi-square and McNemar chi-square tests were used in the analysis.Results: A 
total of 185 respondents was studied in each group, with the majority in the 
30-39 and 40-49 age groups, respectively (65.4% of the study group and 64.4% of 
the control group). Larger proportions of respondents in both groups were 
females (72.4% vs 75.1% respectively). Three months after the intervention, the 
proportion of respondents with normal serum zinc levels improved significantly 
from 20.5% to 51.9% in the intervention group (χ2McNemar, p < 0.001), whereas 
the control group had no appreciable improvement (16.8% vs 22.7%) (χ2McNemar, p 
< 0.117). Furthermore, the post-intervention serum zinc level difference between 
the intervention and control groups was statistically significant (χ2 = 33.699; 
p < 0.001). No statistically significant difference existed in the nutritional 
status between the groups (χ2 = 3.469; p = 0.325).Conclusion: Nutrition 
education had a positive effect on the serum zinc levels of HIV clients. 
Integrating nutrition education programmes as a key component of HIV care in 
resource-limited settings will help improve the serum zinc level of people 
living with HIV, which ultimately improves their immune status and life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The excitotoxic molecule, domoic acid (DA), is a marine algal toxin 
known to induce overt hippocampal neurotoxicity. Recent experimental and 
epidemiological studies suggest adverse neurological effects at exposure levels 
near the current regulatory limit (20 ppm,  ∼ 0.075 - 0.1 mg/kg). At these 
levels, cognitive effects occur in the absence of acute symptoms or evidence of 
neuronal death.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify adverse effects on the nervous system 
from prolonged, dietary DA exposure in adult, female Macaca fascicularis 
monkeys.
METHODS: Monkeys were orally exposed to 0, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg per day for an 
average of 14 months. Clinical blood counts, chemistry, and cytokine levels were 
analyzed in the blood. In-life magnetic resonance (MR) imaging assessed 
volumetric and tractography differences in and between the hippocampus and 
thalamus. Histology of neurons and glia in the fornix, fimbria, internal 
capsule, thalamus, and hippocampus was evaluated. Hippocampal RNA sequencing was 
used to identify differentially expressed genes. Enrichment of gene networks for 
neuronal health, excitotoxicity, inflammation/glia, and myelin were assessed 
with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.
RESULTS: Clinical blood counts, chemistry, and cytokine levels were not altered 
with DA exposure in nonhuman primates. Transcriptome analysis of the hippocampus 
yielded 748 differentially expressed genes (fold change ≥ 1.5; p ≤ 0.05), 
reflecting differences in a broad molecular profile of intermediate early genes 
(e.g., FOS, EGR) and genes related to myelin networks in DA animals. Between 
exposed and control animals, MR imaging showed comparable connectivity of the 
hippocampus and thalamus and histology showed no evidence of hypomyelination. 
Histological examination of the thalamus showed a larger microglia soma size and 
an extension of cell processes, but suggestions of a GFAP+astrocyte response 
showed no indication of astrocyte hypertrophy.
DISCUSSION: In the absence of overt hippocampal excitotoxicity, chronic exposure 
of Macaca fascicularis monkeys to environmentally relevant levels of DA 
suggested a subtle shift in the molecular profile of the hippocampus and the 
microglia phenotype in the thalamus that was possibly reflective of an adaptive 
response due to prolonged DA exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10923.

Environmental degradation continues to attract interest from academics, 
policymakers, and other stakeholders. However, empirical studies have been 
limited in the choice of human well-being indicators. Therefore, this study 
extends the literature by broadening the nexus between human well-being and 
environmental degradation in 29 African countries from 1970 to 2019. Preliminary 
tests adaptable to effects of cross-sectional dependency and heterogeneity in 
panel dataset were adopted, alongside the cross-sectional auto-regressive 
distributed lag model. Findings from the study showed that the adopted human 
well-being indicators such as globalisation, life expectancy, and human capital 
development were environmentally enhancing both in the short and long terms. In 
contrast, income growth was environmentally degrading in the short and long 
terms. At the same time, urbanisation was only environmentally detrimental in 
the long term with no significant short-term effect. Natural resource rent which 
served as a control variable was environmentally degrading both in the short and 
long terms. Consequently, this study confirms the synergy approach between the 
environment and human well-being and the trade-off hypothesis in African 
countries. Thus, African countries' general resource management policy 
significantly determines the impact their path to human well-being enhancement 
has on the environment.

The eutrophication of freshwater systems is a pervasive issue in North America 
and elsewhere, which has been linked to elevated phosphorus (P) loading from 
watersheds. Most excess P is thought to originate from non-point agricultural 
sources, and less attention has been given to small rural point sources, such as 
bunker silos on livestock farms. Sophisticated management practices are rarely 
used to attenuate nutrients from bunker silo effluent, leaving simple vegetated 
buffer strips or riparian zones to protect surface water; however, the efficacy 
of these systems or larger constructed treatment systems is unclear. This study 
compared two systems receiving bunker silo effluent, one a natural riparian 
system with a vegetated buffer strip that is the most common practice and the 
other a constructed treatment system with a forebay, slag filter, and swale. The 
study quantified P retention within various subsections of each system and 
characterized the forms of stored P to infer the potential for remobilization. 
Results indicate that soils receiving bunker silo effluent represent 
considerable stores of legacy P in the landscape (750 and 3400 kg ha-1), the 
majority of which is stored in labile forms that may be vulnerable to 
remobilization under the waterlogged conditions that often occur in management 
practices and riparian zones. Some areas of the systems were able to store 
considerably more P than others, with the slag filter showing the greatest 
treatment efficacy. Spatial variability in stored P was apparent, where sections 
of the systems that directly received effluent retained more P than sections 
located farther away from bunker silos (indirect inputs). Results indicate that 
passive treatment systems become P saturated over time, limiting their longterm 
P removal efficacy. The efficacy of these systems may be improved with the 
inclusion of sorptive materials as a slag filter within the constructed 
treatment system significantly increased the life expectancy of that system. 
Greater understanding of both quantity and forms of P retained in systems and 
soils receiving bunker silo effluent will help develop management strategies 
that are more effective and longer-lasting for reducing excess P losses to 
surface water bodies.

BACKGROUNDS: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of deaths 
nationwide. However, little is understood about its temporal trend and 
corresponding influence on longevity improvements. We aimed to describe the 
updated tendency in CVD mortality and to quantify its impact on life expectancy 
(LE) increase in China.
METHODS: All-cause mortality rates were calculated with population sizes from 
the National Bureau of Statistics and death counts from the National Health 
Commission. We estimated CVD mortality rates by allocating age- and sex-based 
mortality envelopes to each CVD subtype based on its proportion derived from the 
Disease Surveillance Points system. The probability of CVD premature deaths and 
LE were calculated with life tables and we adopted Arriaga's method to 
quantitate age- and cause-specific contributions to LE gains.
RESULTS: During 2013 to 2018, the age-standardized mortality rate of CVD 
decreased from 289.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 289.03, 290.35)/100,000 to 
272.37 (95%CI: 271.81, 272.94)/100,000, along with a decline in probability of 
CVD premature deaths from 9.05% (95%CI: 9.02%, 9.09%) to 8.13% (95%CI: 8.10%, 
8.16%). The gap in CVD mortality across sexes expanded with more remarkable 
declines in females, especially for those aged 15 to 64 years. Among major 
subtypes, the probability of premature deaths from hemorrhage stroke declined 
fastest, while improvements of ischemic stroke and ischemic heart disease were 
limited, and there was an increase in stroke sequelae. LE in China reached 77.04 
(95%CI: 76.96, 77.12) years in 2018 with an increase of 1.38 years from 2013. Of 
the total LE gains, 21.15% (0.29 years) were attributed to reductions of CVD 
mortality in the overall population, mostly driven by those aged >65 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The general process in reducing CVD mortality has contributed to 
longevity improvements in China. More attention should be paid to prevention and 
control of atherosclerotic CVD and stroke sequelae, especially for the elderly. 
Working-age males also deserve additional attention due to inadequate 
improvements.

The human gut microbiome is a complex and dynamic microbial entity that 
interacts with the environment and other parts of the body including the brain, 
heart, liver, and immune system. These multisystem interactions are highly 
conserved from invertebrates to humans, however the complexity and diversity of 
human microbiota compositions often yield a context that is unique to each 
individual. Yet commonalities remain across species, where a healthy gut 
microbiome will be rich in symbiotic commensal biota while an unhealthy gut 
microbiota will be experiencing abnormal blooms of pathobiont bacteria. In this 
review we discuss how omics technologies can be applied in a personalized 
approach to understand the microbial crosstalk and microbial-host interactions 
that affect the delicate balance between eubiosis and dysbiosis in an individual 
gut microbiome. We further highlight the strengths of model organisms in 
identifying and characterizing these conserved synergistic and/or pathogenic 
host-microbe interactions. And finally, we touch upon the growing area of 
personalized therapeutic interventions targeting gut microbiome.

Providing culturally appropriate residential dementia care for older adults with 
an Indian heritage: Perspectives from Sydney-based stakeholders.

South Wales, Australia.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Global migration and an increased life expectancy led 
to a growing number of people with dementia from Culturally and Linguistically 
Diverse (CaLD) backgrounds living in long-term residential care settings. These 
minority groups' wellbeing may be negatively impacted due to poor culturally 
appropriate care that fails to honour valued cultural traditions. This study 
considered culturally appropriate dementia care for older adults with an Indian 
heritage living in Sydney-based residential aged care facilities.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Nominal Group Technique was employed to collect 
data from three groups of stakeholders of Indian heritage over a period of 6 
months: care staff (n = 8), family of residential care recipients (n = 8), and 
community-dwelling older adults (n = 7).
RESULTS: Perspectives highlighted six concepts for consideration: (1) embracing 
a person-centred approach to promote culturally appropriate dementia care; (2) 
training staff in culturally appropriate forms of respect; (3) the impact of 
staff ratios on care; (4) the importance of familiarity to meaningful 
engagement; (5) the importance of food; and (6) the necessity of engaging family 
and the wider Indian community in residential care activities.
CONCLUSIONS: Culturally appropriate dementia care for older adults with an 
Indian heritage is an area in need of further development. To ensure that 
residents with an Indian heritage are respected as an ethnic minority, it 
remains crucial that research is generated to inform policy development on each 
CaLD group as a separate entity.

The ongoing energy transition requires power grid extensions to connect 
renewable generators to consumers and to transfer power among distant areas. The 
process of grid extension requires a large investment of resources and is 
supposed to make grid operation more robust. Yet, counter-intuitively, 
increasing the capacity of existing lines or adding new lines may also reduce 
the overall system performance and even promote blackouts due to Braess' 
paradox. Braess' paradox was theoretically modeled but not yet proven in 
realistically scaled power grids. Here, we present an experimental setup 
demonstrating Braess' paradox in an AC power grid and show how it constrains 
ongoing large-scale grid extension projects. We present a topological theory 
that reveals the key mechanism and predicts Braessian grid extensions from the 
network structure. These results offer a theoretical method to understand and 
practical guidelines in support of preventing unsuitable infrastructures and the 
systemic planning of grid extensions.

Noninferiority trials are becoming increasing common, but are often poorly 
reported and misunderstood. A better understanding of the new components of a 
noninferiority trial and their interpretation is needed. Noninferiority trials 
are an extension of conventional superiority trials, which provide a basis for 
determining if a new treatment, which may have advantages other than efficacy, 
has sufficient efficacy to be useful in certain situations. A key feature is the 
need to specify a clinical noninferiority margin above which the lower boundary 
of the confidence interval for the difference between the new treatment and the 
conventional treatment must lie. In most cases a nontreated control arm is not 
included, and when the efficacy of the new treatment is less than that of the 
standard treatment, determining its efficacy versus no treatment can be a major 
challenge. Treatments meeting a clinical noninferiority requirement can be 
statistically significantly superior to standard treatment, of similar efficacy 
(i.e., no significant difference), or even significantly inferior in a 
conventional analysis. Noninferiority comparisons are an important addition to 
the reporting of clinical trials, but require prior consideration of several 
factors that conventional superiority analyses do not address.

Difficult-to-Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis in Older Adults: Implications of Ageing 
for Managing Patients.

Difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis is a heterogeneous term in which 
patients may present with difficulties in their management for different 
reasons. This can ultimately lead to patients being exposed to multiple 
treatments because of inefficacy (resulting from mechanisms intrinsic to 
rheumatoid arthritis or from non-inflammatory causes such as chronic pain 
syndrome or structural damage, among others), toxicity or adverse effects that 
may be linked to comorbidities. One particular group in which such 
characteristics may be more patent is older patients. Increasing life 
expectancy, an ageing population and the late onset of rheumatoid arthritis have 
led to an increased interest in the particularities of treating older patients. 
This may pose a challenge for physicians, as ageing has implications for optimal 
patient treatment owing to the potential presence of comorbidities, the risk of 
adverse events and perceptions of disease status by both physicians and 
patients. All of these factors may have implications for classifying and 
managing patients aged > 65 years as difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis, as 
these patients could be misclassified. This can occur when a significant 
proportion may still exhibit signs of active disease but not necessarily be 
difficult to treat because the treatment criterion has not been fulfilled. 
Alternatively, patients may be exposed to multiple biologic/targeted 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs because of contraindications and/or 
comorbid conditions. Treatment-to-target strategies and an adequate assessment 
of inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis activity in older patients should be 
undertaken, taking special care with associated comorbidities, polypharmacy and 
risk profiles. Such an approach can help to ensure appropriate treatment for 
older adults and avoid the misclassification of difficult-to-treat patients.

Endometrial cancer (EC) is becoming more common worldwide, primarily due to an 
increase in life expectancy and obesity. As several modifiable factors may 
affect EC incidence and progression, we aimed to elucidate how dietary habits 
and daily routines influence recurrence and survival among women with EC, using 
a Random Survival Forest (RSF) approach. 481 women who previously underwent 
hysterectomy due to EC completed two extensive questionnaires on dietary habits 
and daily routines, and we used RSF to identify risky or protective variables. 
Among the 186 variables considered, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and 
fried potatoes increased the risk of EC recurrence and death, while physical 
activity decreased the risk of death. We conclude that RSF is a suitable 
approach to study survival in multivariable datasets.

While the life expectancy of cancer survivors has substantially improved over 
time in the United States, the extent to which cancer patients are cured is not 
known. Population-level cure patterns are important indicators to quantify 
cancer survivorships. This population-based cohort study included 8978,721 
cancer patients registered in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results 
(SEER) databases between 1975 and 2018. The primary outcome was cure fractions. 
Five-year cure probability, time to cure and median survival time of uncured 
cases were also assessed. All four measures were calculated using flexible 
parametric models, according to 46 cancer sites, three summary stages, 
individual age and calendar year at diagnosis. In 2018, cure fractions ranged 
from 2.7% for distant liver cancer to 100.0% for localized/regional prostate 
cancer. Localized cancer had the highest cure fraction, followed by regional 
cancer and distant cancer. Except for localized breast cancer, older patients 
generally had lower cure fractions. There were 38 cancer site and stage 
combinations (31.2%) that achieved 95% of cure within 5 years. Median survival 
time of the uncured cases ranged from 0.3 years for distant liver cancer to 
10.9 years for localized urinary bladder cancer. A total of 117 cancer site and 
stage combinations (93.6%) had increased cure fraction over time. A considerable 
proportion of cancer patients were cured at the population-level, and the cure 
patterns varied substantially across cancer site, stage and age at diagnosis. 
Increases in cure fractions over time likely reflected advances in cancer 
treatment and early detection.

During post-harvest storage, the cell wall properties are closely associated 
with the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the fruit. The 
degradation of pectin in the cell walls and middle lamella is critical to these 
properties. The effects of calcium chloride (CaCl₂) and 1-methylcyclopropene 
(1-MCP) combined treatment on the pectin degradation, texture, and peel color of 
Eureka lemon were investigated during post-harvest storage. The in-situ light 
microscope analysis, rapid method, and FTIR test were used to investigate the 
spatial distribution, the pectin content, and its degradation. The results 
showed a reduction in pectin degradation, by 42 d the CaCl₂ and 1-MCP combined 
treated fruits presented a 36.7% pectin content loss which was lower than the 
control which was 48.3%. The treated fruits significantly exhibited enhanced 
textural properties, delayed weight loss, higher total acids, and improvement of 
other physicochemical properties in comparison to the control. The treatment 
deaccelerated the fruit peel color change from green to yellow and also had a 
better visual appearance on the final day. Overall, the results suggest that the 
control treatment for pectin degradation can reduce the fruit texture decline 
and peel color change and maintain a good visual appearance. The influence of 
pectin degradation on the texture and physicochemical properties of lemon 
provides a theoretical basis for fruit storage optimization, quality control, 
and shelf-life extension.

The gut microbiome is vital to the physiological and biochemical functions of 
the host, and changes in the composition of these microbial communities may 
affect growth and adaptability to the environment. Pomacea canaliculata is an 
invasive freshwater snail which has become a serious agricultural pest. 
Temperature adaptation is considered an important reason for the widespread 
distribution of this species. To date, the contribution of the gut microbes to 
host fitness of P. canaliculata during long-term temperature stress is not well 
understood. In this study, the morphological changes and intestinal microbiome 
of P. canaliculata under long-term stress at low temperature (15°C) and high 
temperature (35°C) were investigated with laboratory experiments. Compared with 
control group (25°C), the alpha diversity increased and pathogenic bacteria 
enriched changed under high and low temperature stress. The effect of high 
temperature stress on the intestinal microbiome of P. canaliculata was more 
significant than that of low temperature stress. A sustained high temperature 
environment led to an increase in the abundance of pathogenic bacteria, such as 
Aeromonas and Enterobacter, and a decrease in the abundance of immune-related 
bacteria such as Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Lactococcus. These intestine 
microbiome changes can increase the risk of diseases like intestinal 
inflammation, and lead to more deaths at high temperature environments. In 
addition, with the extension of stress time from 14 to 28 days, the beneficial 
bacteria such as Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Lactococcus were significantly 
enriched, while potential pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas,
