(benevolent) pseudo-diabetes is detrimental. By contrast, it is associated with 
better health and life extension. In transplant patients, a weak association 
between rapamycin/everolimus use and hyperglycemia is mostly due to a drug 
interaction with calcineurin inhibitors. When it occurs in cancer patients, the 
hyperglycemia is mild and reversible. No hyperglycemic effects of 
rapamycin/everolimus have been detected in healthy people. For antiaging 
purposes, rapamycin/everolimus can be administrated intermittently (e.g., once a 
week) in combination with intermittent carbohydrate restriction, physical 
exercise, and metformin.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment among elderly is increasing owing to increases 
in life expectancy globally. The problem is multifactorial. The objective of the 
present paper was to study the correlates of cognitive impairment in an urban 
elderly population in India.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted among 100 randomly selected urban 
elderly population. Data was collected upon household visits using a predesigned 
pretested questionnaire administered by a trained investigator. Measurements 
included cognitive function assessment using Mini Mental State Examination, 
depression assessment using Geriatric Depression Scale, blood pressure 
measurement and anthropometry. Cognitive impairment was defined at MMSE score 
<24. Logistic regression was done to identify independently associated factors 
with cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: Prevalence of cognitive impairment among elderly was 10%. Women had a 
higher prevalence than men. Higher age, no schooling, living single, lower 
weight, lower waist and hip ratios, difficulty in activities of daily living, 
poor self-reported health, bedridden and depression significantly associated 
with cognitive impairment. The independently associated factors upon logistic 
regression were increasing age, no schooling and bedridden status for past six 
months.
CONCLUSION: Although the current prevalence of cognitive impairment among Indian 
urban elderly is low, several associated factors exist in this population that 
may increase the burden in future. Geriatric health policy should address the 
modifiable risk factors to manage the problem of cognitive impairment and its 
consequent outcomes.

Gender variations in health literacy have implications for engagement in 
preventive behaviours and the uptake of health services, especially in areas 
such as the Caribbean where there are marked disparities in life expectancy and 
health service utilization. A self-reported questionnaire was used to examine 
men's concepts of health, their help-seeking behaviours and their functional and 
interactive health literacy. Two hundred and forty-eight men across the life 
course participated at three sites in Trinidad. Data were analysed using 
descriptive statistics, with free-text responses analysed thematically. Men were 
concerned about, and accepted responsibility for their own health but social 
norms concerning sickness and masculinity were barriers to accessing health 
services. Almost one-third (31.5%) sought advice from a healthcare service when 
they were last sick because they were prompted to do so by their wife/partner or 
family. Levels of functional and interactive health literacy were not high among 
older men, who were reliant on healthcare professionals to communicate health 
messages. There was an age divide in e-health literacy. There is little 
published evidence on men's health literacy, particularly from Caribbean 
countries such as Trinidad and Tobago. This study highlights the importance of 
the design and implementation of specific policies focusing on men's health. A 
major challenge is to engage with men who do not access health services.

: The field of HIV treatment and prevention has evolved rapidly over the past 
four decades. New therapies that are more potent and streamlined have 
transformed HIV into a chronic disease, while the use of such preventive 
strategies as preexposure prophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis provide 
effective options for reducing the risk of HIV infection. These medical 
breakthroughs have enabled more people living with HIV (PLWH) to reach older 
adulthood. But they also mean that nurses are seeing more PLWH who have 
developed long-term complications of living with HIV or of exposure to 
antiretroviral therapy, as well as concurrent chronic conditions associated with 
advanced age. Nurses play a critical role in caring for PLWH and those at risk 
for HIV infection. This article discusses HIV epidemiology, describes the 
current state of HIV treatment and prevention, and highlights common 
comorbidities often seen in PLWH who are over age 50.

Previous study reported the development of insect-proof halloysite nanotubes 
(HNTs) and food packaging; however, the duration of their insecticidal 
properties remains unclear. Here, we aimed to (1) demonstrate the duration of 
repellency of clove bud oil (CO) encapsulated by HNTs for more than 30 days, and 
(2) manufacture insect-proof film containing HNTs for commercial use. Also, the 
release behavior of CO from insect-resistant HNTs was evaluated and HNTs were 
applied to food packaging composed of polypropylene and low-density polyethylene 
films to prevent Plodia interpunctella (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) larva 
infestation. CO, a natural insecticide, was embedded with HNTs and 
polyethyleneimine (PEI) via vacuum pulling process to cause a slow and gradual 
release of CO. The sustained release profile of CO from CO-containing HNTs with 
a PEI coating [(HNTs/CO/layer-by-layer (LBL)] was verified by gas chromatography 
analysis. The repellent activity of HNTs/CO/LBL was observed for up to 46 days, 
whereas CO film and HNTs/CO film exhibited no insecticidal activities during the 
test period. After 30-day exposure, the HNTs/CO/LBL film exhibited a 7-day 
extension in the penetration test. To evaluate the insecticidal properties of 
the insect-proof film (HNTs/CO/LBL scale-up film) manufactured in an industrial 
facility, the inhibitory effects of HNTs/CO/LBL scale-up film on insect 
infestation was elucidated in both the segregation and combination tests. As a 
result, HNTs/CO/LBL alone or gravure-printed film treated with HNTs/CO/LBL were 
capable of protecting food from insect infestation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: 
Halloysite nanotubes containing natural insect repellent were applied to 
industrial production of food packaging. Commercial cornflake cereal packaging 
using insect-resistant film successfully inhibited pest infestation. 
Insect-proof film produced at an industrial facility can be utilized to protect 
processed food from insect infestation.

Antibody conjugates, in particular antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), are a 
fast-growing area in research and in the pharmaceutical industry. The covalent 
attachment of an antibody to a chemical moiety can be an effective measure for 
drug targeting or can also positively impact pharmacokinetics of small molecular 
compounds by serum half-life extension. Stability, physicochemical properties, 
and degradation pathways of biotherapeutics or small molecule therapeutics are 
often not totally known and understood. However, ADCs represent a hybrid of 
small molecular and macromolecular components, and their properties are still 
not fully understood and described. This review discusses the alteration of the 
physicochemical properties of antibodies upon conjugation of chemical moieties 
to its surface and the resulting impact on ADC stability.

Avoidable, amenable, and preventable mortalities in South Korea, 2000-2017: 
Age-period-cohort trends and impact on life expectancy at birth.

This study aimed to estimate age-period-cohort effects on avoidable mortality 
and quantify the impact of avoidable mortality changes on life expectancy (LE) 
at birth in the South Korean population aged 0-74 years. Using death certificate 
and resident population data from 2000 to 2017, trends in age-standardized 
avoidable mortality rates were analyzed with joinpoint regression. Intrinsic 
estimator regression analysis was conducted to estimate age-period-cohort 
effects on avoidable mortality. Arriaga's method was used to measure the 
contributions of avoidable causes to changes in LE gaps between adjacent 
three-year periods by age and avoidable cause of death groups. Avoidable 
mortality decreased annually by 4.6% between 2000 and 2017. There were strong 
age and cohort effects and a weak period effect on avoidable mortality. In the 
overall decreasing trend, avoidable mortality declined less in cohorts born 
after the 1950-1953 Korean War and economic recession in the 1970s, with further 
reductions in cohorts born after the 1987 democratic reform and 1997-1998 
economic crisis. Avoidable mortality was reduced after implementation of major 
health policies, but the decrease stagnated during the 2008-2009 financial 
crisis. Avoidable mortality reduction resulted in LE gains of 3.1 years, which 
accounted for 80% of total LE gains. Contribution to LE gains by causes of death 
was the largest for cerebrovascular disease. Major social changes and health 
policies influenced the avoidable mortality trend through cohort and period 
effects. Health care and public health policies implemented since the 2000s 
might have contributed substantially to gains in LE.

As life expectancy and activity levels of patients increase so does the demand 
on total knee replacements (TKRs). Abnormal mechanics and wear of TKRs can lead 
to implant loosening and revision. Component alignment after surgery varies due 
to the presurgical alignment, the accuracy of the surgical instrumentation and 
due to patient factors, such as the soft tissue balance. This study 
experimentally investigated the effect of variation in component alignment and 
the soft tissue conditions on the kinematics and wear of a fixed bearing TKR. 
DePuy Sigma fixed bearing TKRs with moderately cross-linked UHMWPE were used. 
Different alignment conditions were simulated in the coronal, sagittal and 
transverse planes in an ISO force-controlled simulation system. Three different 
soft tissue conditions were simulated using virtual springs to represent a stiff 
knee, a preserved PCL and a resected PCL. Four different alignment conditions 
were studied; ideal alignment, 4° tibial and femoral varus joint line, 14° 
rotational mismatch and 10° posterior tibial slope. The varus joint line 
alignment resulted in similar kinematics and lower wear rate compared to ideal 
alignment. The rotational mismatch alignment resulted in significantly higher 
tibial rotation and abduction-adduction as well as a significantly higher wear 
rate than ideal alignment. The posterior tibial slope alignment resulted in 
significantly higher wear than the ideal alignment and dislocated under the 
lower tension soft tissue conditions. Component alignment and the soft tissue 
conditions had a significant effect on the kinematics and wear of the TKR 
investigated in this study. The surgical alignment of the TKR is an important 
factor in the clinical outcome of the joint as factors such as increased tibial 
rotation can lead to anterior knee pain and instability and increased wear can 
lead to aseptic loosening and early failure resulting in revision.

The aim of the study was to assess trends in mortality and years of life lost 
due to prostate cancer (PCa) in Poland in 2000-2015. The crude death rates 
(CDR), standardised death rates (SDR), standard expected years of life lost per 
living person (SEYLLp) and per death (SEYLLd) values were calculated. Joinpoint 
models were used to analyse time trends. In the study period, 61,928 men died of 
PCa. The values of mortality rates in 2000 (per 100,000) were: CDR = 16.97, SDR 
= 16.17, SEYLLp = 332.1. In 2015, the values of all rates increased: CDR = 
26.22, SDR = 16.69, SEYLLp = 429.5. However, the SEYLLd value decreased from 
15.62 to one man who died due to PCa in 2000 to 13.78 in 2015. The highest 
SEYLLp values occurred in the group of men with primary education (619.5 in 2000 
and 700.7 in 2015). They were respectively 2.24 and 2.96 times higher than in 
men with higher education (275.7 and 237.1). SEYLLp values increased in urban 
areas (from 295.7 to 449.4), slightly changed in the rural areas (from 391.5 to 
400.2). Unfavorable trends in mortality due to PCa in Poland require explanation 
of the causes and implementation of appropriate actions aimed at mortality 
reducing.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness 
of collaborative dementia care management (DCM).
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on the data of 444 patients 
of a cluster-randomized, controlled trial, conceptualized to evaluate a 
collaborative DCM that aimed to optimize treatment and care in dementia. 
Health-care resource use, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost per QALY gained were measured over a 24-month time horizon.
RESULTS: DCM increased QALYs (+0.05) and decreased costs (-569€) due to a lower 
hospitalization and a delayed institutionalization (7 months) compared with 
usual care. The probability of DCM being cost-effective was 88% at 
willingness-to-pay thresholds of 40,000€ per QALY gained and higher in patients 
living alone compared to those not living alone (96% vs. 26%).
DISCUSSION: DCM is likely to be a cost-effective strategy in treating dementia 
and thus beneficial for public health-care payers and patients, especially for 
those living alone.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge on survival after diagnosis is important for all 
stakeholders. We aimed to estimate the survival and life expectancy after a 
dementia diagnosis, and to quantify the impact of dementia subtypes on 
mortality.
METHODS: Retrospective matched cohort study using a linkage between a 
dementia-specific registry and two primary care electronic medical records 
databases. Between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2015 there were 5,156 subjects 
aged 60 years and over registered by the Registry of Dementia of Girona and 
matched to 15,468 age-sex and comorbidity individuals without dementia attended 
by general practitioners in the province of Girona (Catalonia, Spain).
RESULTS: The median survival was 5.2 years (95% CI 5.0 to 5.4), the median life 
expectancy was 74.7 years (95% CI 71.9 to 76.5), and there were differences by 
gender. The mortality rate was 127.1 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 121.6 to 
132.7), and the hazard ratio for mortality in persons with dementia ranged 
between 1.63 (95% CI 1.52 to 1.76) for Alzheimer's disease and 2.52 (95% CI 1.90 
to 3.35) for Parkinson-plus syndromes. There was one death per year attributable 
to dementia for every 18.6 persons with dementia, and for every 2.4 persons with 
dementia who die, one death was attributable to dementia.
CONCLUSION: The prognosis after dementia diagnosis is conditioned by demographic 
and clinical features. Although survival is larger for women, they also 
experience a higher number of years of life lost. Parkinson-plus syndromes and 
dementia due to multiple etiologies are among the most malignant subtypes 
regarding mortality.

BACKGROUND: Older adults with hip osteoarthritis (OA) suffer a progressive loss 
of muscle quality and strength, affecting their daily activities and quality of 
life. The purpose of this study is to compare the levels of isometric strength 
among older adults with and without hip OA and healthy young adults, and to 
determine the relationship between muscle quality index (MQI) and isometric 
strength.
METHODS: Fourteen subjects with hip OA (65.6 ± 3.0 years), 18 healthy older 
adults (66.6 ± 6.5 years) and 32 young adults (20.7 ± 2.0 years) participated in 
the study. MQI, isometric muscle strength of the hip, ten time sit-to-stand 
tests, and body composition were measured.
RESULTS: The MQI was lower in subjects with hip OA, with no significant 
differences between groups (p > 0.054). Subjects with OA produced significantly 
less isometric strength in hip extension (p < 0.001), flexion (p < 0.001), 
abduction (p < 0.05), adduction (p < 0.001), external (p < 0.05) and internal 
rotation (p < 0.05). Subjects with OA demonstrated longer time in the execution 
of the sit-to-stand test (p < 0.001) in comparison with healthy older and young 
adults. High correlations between MQI, sit-to-stand (r =  - 0.76, p < 0.01) and 
peak force during hip abduction (r = 0.78, p < 0.01) where found in subjects 
with OA. Moderate correlation between MQI and peak force during hip flexion 
(r = 0.55, p < 0.05) and external rotation (r = 0.61, p < 0.05) were found in 
the OA group.
CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with OA have lower MQI than old and young healthy 
controls. In subjects with OA, there was a significant relationship between 
isometric strength of hip muscles and performance on the sit-to-stand test and 
the MQI.

Conjugation of therapeutics to human serum albumin (HSA) using bromomaleimides 
represents a promising platform for half-life extension. We show here that the 
Cys-34 crevice substantially reduces the rate of serum stabilising maleimide 
hydrolysis in these conjugates, necessitating reagent optimisation. This 
improved reagent design is applied to the construction of an HSA-paclitaxel 
conjugate, preventing drug loss during maleimide hydrolysis.

BACKGROUND: Huntington's Disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder 
which affects individuals' ability to walk, talk, think, and reason. Onset is 
usually in the forties, there are no therapies currently available that alter 
disease course, and life expectancy is 10-20 years from diagnosis. The gene 
causing HD is fully penetrant, with a 50% probability of passing the disease to 
offspring. Although the impacts of HD are substantial, there has been little 
report of the quality of life of people with the condition in a manner that can 
be used in economic evaluations of treatments for HD. Health state utility 
values (HSUVs), used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), are the 
metric commonly used to inform such healthcare policy decision-making.
OBJECTIVES: The aim was to report HSUVs for HD, with specific objectives to use 
European data to: (i) describe HSUVs by demographic and clinical 
characteristics; (ii) compare HSUVs of people with HD in the UK with population 
norms; (iii) identify the relative strength of demographic and clinical 
characteristics in predicting HSUVs.
METHODS: European Huntington's Disease Network REGISTRY study data were used for 
analysis. This is a multi-centre, multi-national, observational, longitudinal 
study, which collects six-monthly demographic, clinical, and patient-reported 
outcome measures, including the SF-36. SF-36 scores were converted to SF-6D 
HSUVs and described by demographic and clinical characteristics. HSUVs from 
people with HD in the UK were compared with population norms. Regression 
analysis was used to estimate the relative strength of age, gender, time since 
diagnosis, and disease severity (according to the Total Function Capacity (TFC) 
score, and the UHDRS's Motor score, Behavioural score, and Cognition score) in 
predicting HSUVs.
RESULTS: 11,328 questionnaires were completed by 5560 respondents with HD in 12 
European countries. Women generally had lower HSUVs than men, and HSUVs were 
consistently lower than population norms for those with HD in the UK, and 
dropped with increasing disease severity. The regression model significantly 
accounted for the variance in SF-6D scores (n = 1939; F [7,1931] = 120.05; 
p < 0.001; adjusted R-squared 0.3007), with TFC score, Behavioural score, and 
male gender significant predictors of SF-6D values (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of HSUVs for HD for 
countries other than the UK, and the first report of SF-6D HSUVs described for 
12 European countries, according to demographic and clinical factors. Our 
analyses provide new insights into the relationships between HD disease 
characteristics and assessment of health-related quality of life in a form that 
can be used in policy-relevant economic evaluations.

We introduce a new class of continuous distributions called the generalized odd 
Lindley-G family. Four special models of the new family are provided. Some 
explicit expressions for the quantile and generating functions, ordinary and 
incomplete moments, order statistics and Rényi and Shannon entropies are 
derived. The maximum likelihood method is used for estimating the model 
parameters. The flexibility of the generated family is illustrated by means of 
two applications to real data sets.

OBJECTIVES: Vision and hearing impairment may impact both life expectancy (LE) 
and health expectancy, that is, duration of life with and without health 
problems, among older adults. We examined the impact of self-reported vision and 
hearing impairment on years of life with and without limitation in physical 
function and in activities of daily living (ADLs).
DESIGN: Life table analysis, using a nationally representative longitudinal 
survey of community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years or older, Panel on 
Health and Ageing of Singaporean Elderly.
SETTING: Singapore.
PARTICIPANTS: Survey participants (n = 3452) who were interviewed in 2009 and 
followed up in 2011-2012 and 2015.
MEASUREMENTS: Participants reporting difficulty with any of nine tasks involving 
upper or lower extremities were considered to have a limitation in physical 
function. Those reporting health-related difficulty with any of six basic ADLs 
or seven instrumental ADLs were considered to have a limitation in ADLs. We used 
the multistate life table method with a microsimulation approach to estimate 
health expectancy, considering self-reported sensory impairment status as time 
varying.
RESULTS: Either or both impairments, vs neither, were associated with less years 
without limitation in physical function and in ADLs and more years with 
limitation in physical function and in ADLs, with the greatest impact on health 
expectancy among those with both impairments, who also had the lowest LE. For 
example, at age 60, those with both impairments, vs neither, could expect not 
only shorter LE (4.2 [95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.9-5.7] less years; 20.7 
[95% CI = 18.9-22.5] vs 24.9 [95% CI = 23.8-26.0]) but also more years of life 
with limitations in physical function (3.3 [95% CI = .9-5.8] more years; 12.8 
[95% CI = 10.7-14.8] [about 61.7% of LE] vs 9.5 [95% CI = 8.4-10.5] [about 38.0% 
of LE]).
CONCLUSION: Timely and appropriate management of vision and hearing impairment, 
especially when coexisting, among older adults has the potential to reduce the 
years of life they live with limitation in physical function and in ADLs. J Am 
Geriatr Soc 67:2528-2536, 2019.

BACKGROUND: There is an unmet need for effective therapies for patients with 
advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who cannot tolerate cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy. Cisplatin-ineligible patients experience a high frequency of 
adverse events from the most commonly used standard of care treatment, 
carboplatin plus gemcitabine, or alternative treatment with gemcitabine 
monotherapy. Pembrolizumab is a potent, highly selective humanised monoclonal 
antibody that releases checkpoint inhibition of the immune response system, and 
provides a new alternative for these patients.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for first-line 
treatment of urothelial carcinoma ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy in 
patients with strongly PD-L1-positive tumours in Sweden.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Parametric survival curves were fitted to 
overall survival, progression-free survival, and time on treatment data from 
KEYNOTE-052 to extrapolate clinical outcomes. A simulated treatment comparison 
and a network meta-analysis were conducted to estimate the comparative efficacy 
of pembrolizumab versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine and gemcitabine 
monotherapy. EQ-5D data from KEYNOTE-052 were used to estimate utility, while 
resource use and cost inputs were estimated using Swedish regional pricing lists 
and clinician opinion.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The model reported costs, life 
years, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and results were tested using 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We estimated that pembrolizumab would improve survival 
by 2.11 and 2.16 years and increase QALYs by 1.71 and 1.75 compared to 
carboplatin plus gemcitabine and gemcitabine monotherapy, respectively. 
Pembrolizumab was associated with a cost increase of €90520 versus carboplatin 
plus gemcitabine and €95055 versus gemcitabine, with corresponding incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of €53055/QALY and €54415/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €100000/QALY, pembrolizumab is 
a cost-effective treatment versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine and versus 
gemcitabine.
PATIENT SUMMARY: This is the first analysis to show that pembrolizumab is a 
cost-effective option for first-line treatment of cisplatin-ineligible patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer care is costly, including cost to Medicare, but the 
medical cost associated with bladder cancer patients relative to identical 
persons without bladder cancer is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To determine incremental bladder cancer cost to Medicare and the 
impact of diagnosis stage and bladder cancer survival on cost.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A case-control study was conducted using 
1998-2013 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data. Controls 
were propensity score matched for diagnosis year, age, gender, race, and 31 
Elixhauser Comorbidity Index values. Three incident cohorts, 1998 (n=3136), 2003 
(n=7000), and 2008 (n=7002), were compared.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Survival following diagnosis and 
Medicare payments (in 2018 dollars) were tabulated, and compared between cases 
and controls.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: From 1998 to 2008, bladder cancer patients became older 
and had more comorbidities at diagnosis, although no stage migration or change 
in survival occurred. Incremental costs (above those associated with controls) 
were highest during the 1st year after diagnosis and were higher for distant 
($47533) than for regional ($42403) or localized ($14304) cancer. Bladder cancer 
survival was highly stage dependent. After an initial spike in costs lasting 
1-2yrs, monthly costs dropped in survivors but remained higher than for 
controls. Long-term survivors in the full sample accrued cumulative Medicare 
costs of $172426 over 16yrs-46% higher than for controls. Limitations include 
omission of indirect costs and reliance on traditional Medicare.
CONCLUSIONS: While a bladder cancer diagnosis incurs initial high Medicare cost, 
particularly in patients with advanced cancers, the cumulative costs of bladder 
cancer in long-term survivors are higher still. Bladder cancer prevention saves 
Medicare money. However, while early detection, better therapies, and life 
extension of bladder cancer patients are worthwhile goals, they come at the cost 
of higher Medicare outlays.
PATIENT SUMMARY: The lifetime cost of bladder cancer, reflecting surveillance, 
treatment, and management of complications, is substantial. Since care is 
ongoing, cost increases with the length of life after diagnosis as well as the 
severity of initial diagnosis.

Sustainable urban development (SUD) requires a balance between economic growth, 
social well-being, and environmental protection. Oftentimes, urban policy makers 
can hardly fulfill all SUD goals due to inadequacy of resources to support SUD 
programs. Therefore, the process of allocating scarce resources to achieve and 
balance various SUD goals becomes a critical challenge for policy makers and 
researchers. To solve this problem, this study adopts fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy 
Process (AHP) and fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal 
Situation (TOPSIS) to assess and rank different indicators of SUD and evaluate 
different cities in an emerging economy (Vietnam). Fuzzy methods exhibit more 
advantages than traditional ranking methods. Fuzzy AHP is an extension of AHP, 
whereas fuzzy TOPSIS is an extension of TOPSIS. Fuzzy methods are used to 
overcome disadvantages of traditional methods and are beneficial techniques for 
solving complicated decision problems with a realistic solution. Using a valid 
sample data of ten experts in the field of SUD, empirical results show that 
education, healthcare, quality of life, and social democracy are the most 
important indicators of SUD. By contrast, social diversity, social maturity, and 
energy consumption are the least important indicators of SUD. For social 
sustainability, social democracy and quality of life are the two most important 
criteria, whereas social maturity and social diversity are the two least 
important criteria. For economic sustainability, education and healthcare are 
the two most important criteria, whereas infrastructure and income are the two 
least important criteria. For environmental sustainability, water quality and 
waste disposal are the two most important criteria, whereas energy consumption 
and ecological conservation are the two least important criteria. Furthermore, 
fuzzy TOPSIS results reveal the best and the worst cities in Vietnam with regard 
to overall SUD and its three components. This study provides evidence for 
researchers and policy makers to better understand the importance of different 
goals of SUD and efficiently allocate scarce resources to achieve and balance 
different SUD goals. Furthermore, researchers and policy makers should further 
focus on indicators such as social democracy, quality of life, education, 
healthcare, water quality, and waste disposal. These indicators will help obtain 
the goals of SUD.

Background and Purpose- We determined the effect of sex on outcome after 
endovascular stroke thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke, including lifelong 
disability outcomes. Methods- We analyzed patients treated with the Solitaire 
stent retriever in the combined SWIFT (Solitaire FR With the Intention for 
Thrombectomy), STAR (Solitaire FR Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularization), and 
SWIFT PRIME (Solitaire FR With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary 
Endovascular Treatment) cohorts. Ordinal and logistic regression were used to 
examine known factors influencing outcome after endovascular stroke thrombectomy 
and study the effect of sex on the association between these factors and 
outcomes, including age and time to reperfusion. Years of optimal life after 
thrombectomy were defined as disability-adjusted life years and calculated by 
projecting disability through adjusted poststroke life expectancy by sex. 
Results- Among 389 patients treated with endovascular stroke thrombectomy, 55% 
were females, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 17 
(interquartile range, 8-28). There were no differences between females versus 
males in presenting deficit severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 
score, 17 versus 17, P=0.21), occlusion location (69% versus 64% M1, P=0.62), 
presenting infarct extent (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score 8 versus 8, 
P=0.24), rate of substantial reperfusion (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 
2b/3, 87% versus 83%, P=0.37), onset to reperfusion time (294 versus 302 
minutes, P=0.46). Despite older ages (69 versus 64, P<0.001) and higher rate of 
atrial fibrillation (45% versus 30%, P=0.002) for females compared with males, 
adjusted rates of functional independence at 90 days were similar (odds ratio, 
1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.6). After adjusting for age at presentation and stroke 
severity, females had more years of optimal life (disability-adjusted life year) 
after endovascular stroke thrombectomy, 10.6 versus 8.5 years (P<0.001). 
Conclusions- Despite greater age and higher rate of atrial fibrillation, females 
experienced comparable functional outcomes and greater years of optimal life 
after intervention compared with males.
