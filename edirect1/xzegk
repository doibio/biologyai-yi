benefits in managing HCM, they have limited direct impact on the underlying 
disease process in patients with obstructive HCM. Aficamten achieves its 
therapeutic effect by reducing hypercontractility and improving diastolic 
function in obstructive HCM. Mavacamten was the first cardiac myosin inhibitor 
approved for symptomatic obstructive HCM. However, aficamten has a shorter human 
half-life (t1/2) and fewer drug-drug interactions, making it a preferable 
treatment option. This review evaluates the long-term clinical value and safety 
of aficamten in patients with obstructive HCM based on available data from 
completed and ongoing clinical trials. Additionally, the molecular basis of 
sarcomere-targeted therapy in reducing LVOT gradients is explored, and its 
potential in managing obstructive HCM is discussed.

Will artificial intelligence be, one day, powerful enough to obviate the need of 
randomized clinical trials?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) currently occupies the headlines in the media as 
well as the medical press, with messages of its emerging unlimited potential, 
but also tales of doom and gloom predicting risks for the extinction of 
humanity! One such headline in the London TIMES of 6th June 2023 reads: - "Two 
years to save the world, says AI adviser". To the uninformed, AI is nothing more 
than the processing of a colossal amount of data with lightning speed, now 
achievable with the latest spectacular developments in computing. However, could 
such power be harnessed to accurately predict the therapeutic potential of a new 
treatment emerging from Phase I, or Phase II trials, without the need to proceed 
to Phase III randomised, at times placebo controlled, trials? The deontological 
and ethical concerns about randomised trials have frequently occupied the 
medical literature as several clinical researchers feel uncomfortable with this 
kind of clinical research, especially when a placebo is allocated to patients 
with cancer, enlisted in a Phase III trial. Others have argued that in contrast 
to the belief that randomised controlled trials are more reliable estimators of 
the efficacy of a treatment, investigators have found that, in some settings, 
observational studies did not overestimate the size of the treatment effect 
compared with their randomised counterparts. An accurate prediction of the true 
potential of a novel treatment with AI, thus obviating the need of a phase III, 
randomised trial, could save time, effort, and finances, as well as relieve the 
ethical burden of allocating treatment at random to patients with cancer and 
limited life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: Paediatric growth hormone deficiency (pGHD) manifests as growth 
failure associated with inadequate growth hormone (GH) production. Daily 
injections of recombinant human GH (dGH) [somatropin] is the current standard of 
care, which has been shown to be well tolerated and effective, but associated 
with suboptimal adherence, leading to reduced effectiveness. Somatrogon, a 
once-weekly injectable long-acting human GH, has demonstrated clinical 
non-inferiority and significantly lower life interference (i.e. treatment 
burden) vs. somatropin in two Phase 3 studies. This work evaluated 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of somatrogon vs dGHs from an Irish payer 
perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed for patients starting somatrogon or dGHs 
treatment at 3-12 years and continuing up to achievement of near adult height 
(NAH), with growth driven by trial-based height velocity (HV) and 
treatment-specific adherence. Patients could discontinue treatment at the end of 
Year 1 (4%). DGH adherence (95.3%-65% over treatment duration) and 
adherence-growth relationship were based on published evidence. Higher Year 1 
adherence of 4%, tapering over time, for somatrogon vs. dGHs was based on 
clinical consultation. Treatment costs, monitoring costs and costs due to 
different wastage types (device setting and adherence) were sourced from local 
data. Health utilities based on height and injection frequency were derived from 
published literature. Scenario analysis, deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Somatrogon treatment led to 1.87-3.66 cm greater NAH gain and 0.21-0.50 
higher quality adjusted life years (QALYs) vs. dGHs, across the base case and 
scenarios evaluated. Somatrogon treatment was associated with cost savings of 
€5,699-€21,974 and lower cost per cm gained vs. dGHs (€197-€527), per patient. 
Somatrogon was cost-effective vs. dGHs, with the result consistent across the 
sensitivity analyses conducted.
CONCLUSION: Somatrogon weekly injections were estimated to result in higher NAH, 
higher QALYs, lower overall costs and lower costs per cm gained than dGHs, in 
pGHD.

    Menopause. 2023 Sep 1;30(9):885-886.

IMPORTANCE AND OBJECTIVE: Despite a decreasing incidence of cervical cancer in 
North America overall, disparities in screening and cervical cancer rates 
persist, especially in the postmenopausal age group.
METHODS: We reviewed the literature regarding cervical cancer screening 
considerations for postmenopausal persons, with a focus on cervical cancer in 
postmenopausal persons, existing guidelines, screening methods, and gaps in 
care.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal persons are an important population at 
risk because age 65 years in the United States and up to 70 years in some parts 
of Canada is a milestone for screening cessation if the criteria are met. 
Unfortunately, inadequate screening is common, with most women 65 years or older 
discontinuing ( exiting ) screening despite not meeting the criteria to do so. 
Screening cessation recommendations are nuanced, and if not all criteria are 
met, screening should be continued until they are. Cervical cancer screening 
should be stopped at the recommended age if adequate screening has occurred or 
at any age if life expectancy is limited or the patient has had a hysterectomy 
in the absence of high-grade preinvasive cervical lesions or cervical cancer. 
Human papillomavirus infection, which is causally linked to almost all cervical 
cancer cases, can persist or reactivate from a prior infection or can be newly 
acquired from sexual contact. With more persons aging with a cervix in place, 
the potential for cervical cancer has increased, and higher cancer rates may be 
observed if recommended screening is not adhered to. We propose an algorithm 
based on current cervical cancer screening guidelines to aid providers in 
identifying whether exit criteria have been met. Until adequate screening has 
been confirmed, cervical cancer screening should continue.

Erratum in
    Schizophr Bull. 2023 Nov 24;:

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: The life expectancy of patients diagnosed with 
schizophrenia is 10-12 years lower than in the general population and the 
mortality gap seems to be worsening. Many of these deaths might be avoidable. We 
aimed to determine mortality rates and causes of death after a first-episode 
psychosis, and to examine if clinical characteristics at baseline or during 
illness could predict mortality.
STUDY DESIGN: The OPUS study was a randomized controlled trial of 578 patients 
first diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Patients were clinically 
assessed after 2, 5, 10, and 20 years. Information about time and cause of death 
was obtained from the Danish Cause of Death Register. Hazard ratios were used to 
assess predictors of death.
STUDY RESULTS: In total, 82 (14.4%) participants died during 20 years of 
follow-up. The most common cause of death was suicide (27%). At baseline 
employment (HR 0.47 P = .049), psychotic disorder other than schizophrenia (HR 
0.36, P = .017), and longer duration of untreated psychosis (HR 0.57 P = .042) 
predicted lower mortality while substance use predicted higher mortality (HR 
2.56, P < .001). During follow-up, symptom remission without antipsychotic 
medication and recovery predicted lower mortality (HR 0.08 P = .013 and HR 0.21, 
P = .028) while substance use (HR 3.64 P < .001), and all chronic illnesses 
predicted increased risk.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of early mortality in schizophrenia 
compared to the background population, and there is an urgent need for new 
efforts to improve the disparities in health that lead to this increased 
mortality.

BACKGROUND: The adaptive evolution of plateau indigenous animals is a current 
research focus. However, phenotypic adaptation is complex and may involve the 
interactions between multiple genes or pathways, many of which remain unclear. 
As a kind of livestock with important economic value, cashmere goat has a high 
ability of plateau adaptation, which provides us with good materials for 
studying the molecular regulation mechanism of animal plateau adaptation.
RESULTS: In this study, 32 Jiangnan (J) and 32 Tibetan (T) cashmere goats were 
sequenced at an average of 10. Phylogenetic, population structure, and linkage 
disequilibrium analyses showed that natural selection or domestication has 
resulted in obvious differences in genome structure between the two breeds. 
Subsequently, 553 J vs. T and 608 T vs. J potential selected genes (PSGs) were 
screened. These PSGs showed potential relationships with various phenotypes, 
including myocardial development and activity (LOC106502520, ATP2A2, 
LOC102181869, LOC106502520, MYL2, ISL1, and LOC102181869 genes), pigmentation 
(MITF and KITLG genes), hair follicles/hair growth (YAP1, POGLUT1, AAK1, HES1, 
WNT1, PRKAA1, TNKS, WNT5A, VAX2, RSPO4, CSNK1G1, PHLPP2, CHRM2, PDGFRB, PRKAA1, 
MAP2K1, IRS1, LPAR1, PTEN, PRLR, IBSP, CCNE2, CHAD, ITGB7, TEK, JAK2, and FGF21 
genes), and carcinogenesis (UBE2R2, PIGU, DIABLO, NOL4L, STK3, MAP4, ADGRG1, 
CDC25A, DSG3, LEPR, PRKAA1, IKBKB, and ABCG2 genes). Phenotypic analysis showed 
that Tibetan cashmere goats has finer cashmere than Jiangnan cashmere goats, 
which may allow cashmere goats to better adapt to the cold environment in the 
Tibetan plateau. Meanwhile, KRTs and KAPs expression in Jiangnan cashmere goat 
skin was significantly lower than in Tibetan cashmere goat.
CONCLUSIONS: The mutations in these PSGs maybe closely related to the plateau 
adaptation ability of cashmere goats. In addition, the expression differences of 
KRTs and KAPs may directly determine phenotypic differences in cashmere fineness 
between the two breeds. In conclusion, this study provide a reference for 
further studying plateau adaptive mechanism in animals and goat breeding.

The status of DNA methylation in the human genome changes during the 
pathogenesis of common diseases and acts as a predictor of life expectancy. 
Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the methylation level of regulatory 
regions of genes responsible for general biological processes that are 
potentially significant for the development of age-associated diseases. Among 
them there are genes encoding proteins of DNA repair system, which are 
characterized by pleiotropic effects. Here, results of the targeted methylation 
analysis of two regions of the human genome (the promoter of the MLH1 gene and 
the enhancer near the ATM gene) in different tissues of patients with carotid 
atherosclerosis are present. Analysis of the methylation profiles of studied 
genes in various tissues of the same individuals demonstrated marked differences 
between leukocytes and tissues of the vascular wall. Differences in methylation 
levels between normal and atherosclerotic tissues of the carotid arteries were 
revealed only for two studied CpG sites (chr11:108089866 and chr11:108090020, 
GRCh37/hg19 assembly) in the ATM gene. Based on this, we can assume the 
involvement of ATM in the development of atherosclerosis. "Overload" of the 
studied regions with transcription factor binding sites (according to ReMapp2022 
data) indicate that the tissue-specific nature of methylation of the regulatory 
regions of the MLH1 and ATM may be associated with expression levels of these 
genes in a particular tissue. It has been shown that inter-individual 
differences in the methylation levels of CpG sites are associated with 
sufficiently distant nucleotide substitutions.

OBJECTIVE: Deprescribing, i.e. the suspension of drugs whose existing or 
potential harms outweigh the benefits in the context of care for the individual 
patient, is an increasingly frequently encountered topic in various congresses 
today. This issue becomes predominant especially in patients with chronic 
pathologies with a life expectancy of less than a year, in whom the goal of the 
treatments passes from healing to caring. Currently there are few validated 
deprescribing tools, one of these is certainly the STOPPFrail, currently 
available in its second version. Therefore, we decided to provide for the 
translation into Italian, to make the description for the elderly patient with 
limited life expectation more applicable.
METHODS: For the translation, we used the method expressed by the European 
organisation for research and treatment of cancer (Eortc), using 
forward-backward translation and a Pilot Testing to verify the clarity and 
comprehensibility of the translation itself.
RESULTS: We interviewed 15 experts, of whom 13 responded and completed the 
evaluation, without bringing to light any unclear sections or sources of 
misunderstanding.
CONCLUSIONS: STOPPFrail2 can be a valid deprescribing tool in the elderly with 
limited life expectancy; the Italian version can help the physicians in the 
therapeutic appropriateness in this time of life where it is necessary to focus 
on the quality of life and on the ethical aspect of the choices, as well as 
being of help in a "cost-opportunity" logic.

Although epidemiological data on heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF) are scarce in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey (MENAT) 
region, Lancet Global Burden of Disease estimated the prevalence of HF in the 
MENAT region in 2019 to be 0.78%, versus 0.71% globally. There is also a high 
incidence of HFpEF risk factors and co-morbidities in the region, including 
coronary artery disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, anaemia and chronic 
kidney disease. For instance, 14.5-16.2% of adults in the region reportedly have 
diabetes, versus 7.0% in Europe. Together with increasing life expectancy, this 
may contribute towards a higher burden of HFpEF in the region than currently 
reported. This paper aims to describe the epidemiology and burden of HFpEF in 
the MENAT region, including unique risk factors and co-morbidities. It 
highlights challenges with diagnosing HFpEF, such as the prioritization of HF 
with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the specific profile of HFpEF patients 
in the region and barriers to effective management associated with the 
healthcare system. Guidance is given on the diagnosis, prevention and management 
of HFpEF, including the emerging role of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 
inhibitors. Given the high burden of HFpEF coupled with the fact that its 
prevalence is likely to be underestimated, healthcare professionals need to be 
alert to its signs and symptoms and to manage patients accordingly. 
Historically, HFpEF treatments have focused on managing co-morbidities and 
symptoms, but new agents are now available with proven effects on outcomes in 
patients with HFpEF.

Older is worse? Elderly patients who underwent gastrectomy: A single-center 
study.

Uprak TK, Ergenc M.

AIM: Gastric cancer is common cancer, and its incidence remains relatively high 
in elderly patients with increasing life expectancy. However, few studies have 
examined the clinical and prognostic characteristics of elderly gastric cancer 
patients undergoing gastrectomy. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and 
prognostic features of elderly gastrectomy patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients over 65 years of age who underwent gastric 
cancer surgery at Marmara University were retrospectively analyzed. The 
patients' demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, prognostic 
nutritional index (PNI), complications, intensive care unit duration, and length 
of stay were examined. The patients were divided into two groups: young-old 
(65-74 years old) and old-old (≥ 75 years old). Two groups were compared in 
terms of postoperative outcomes and overall survival.
RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-three patients were analyzed. The mean age was 79 
years, and the female to male ratio was 85/178. Reoperation rates and hospital 
mortality were significantly higher in the old-old group (p=0.001 and p=0.01, 
respectively). The hospital stay was significantly longer in the old-old group 
(5.8 vs. 7.8 days, p= 0.02). Complications were significantly higher in the 
group with a PNI < 40 (49% vs. 23%, p=0.005). There was a significant difference 
between the two groups regarding 5-year overall survival (33% vs. 55%, p= 
0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Gastrectomy can be performed on the elderly. However, an increase 
in complications and in-hospital mortality is recognized over 75. These problems 
should be considered in this old-age group.

Publisher: Il cancro gastrico è un tumore comune e la sua incidenza rimane 
relativamente alta nei pazienti anziani con un’aspettativa di vita in aumento. 
Tuttavia, pochi studi hanno esaminato le caratteristiche cliniche e prognostiche 
dei pazienti anziani con cancro gastrico sottoposti a gastrectomia. Questo 
studio mira a valutare le caratteristiche cliniche e prognostiche dei pazienti 
anziani con gastrectomia.
MATERIALI E METODI: Sono stati analizzati retrospettivamente i pazienti di età 
superiore ai 65 anni che hanno subito un intervento chirurgico per cancro 
gastrico presso l’Università di Marmara. Sono stati esaminati i dati demografici 
dei pazienti, i punteggi dell’American Society of Anesthesiologists, l’indice 
nutrizionale prognostico (PNI), le complicanze, la durata dell’unità di terapia 
intensiva e la durata della degenza. I pazienti sono stati divisi in due gruppi: 
giovani (65-74 anni) e anziani (≥ 75 anni). Due gruppi sono stati confrontati in 
termini di esiti postoperatori e sopravvivenza globale.
RISULTATI: Sono stati analizzati duecentosessantatre pazienti. L’età media era 
di 79 anni e il rapporto tra femmine e maschi era di 85/178. I tassi di 
reintervento e la mortalità ospedaliera erano significativamente più alti nel 
gruppo di anziani (p=0,001 e p=0,01, rispettivamente). La degenza ospedaliera è 
stata significativamente più lunga nel gruppo di anziani (5,8 vs 7,8 giorni, p= 
0,02). Le complicanze erano significativamente più alte nel gruppo con un PNI < 
40 (49% vs. 23%, p=0,005). C’era una differenza significativa tra i due gruppi 
per quanto riguarda la sopravvivenza globale a 5 anni (33% vs. 55%, p=0,002).
CONCLUSIONI: La gastrectomia può essere eseguita sugli anziani. Tuttavia, si 
riconosce un aumento delle complicanze e della mortalità intraospedaliera sopra 
i 75 anni. Questi problemi dovrebbero essere considerati in questa fascia di età 
avanzata.

Meckel-Gruber syndrome is a lethal disorder characterized by occipital 
encephalocele, polycystic kidneys, and polydactyly. In most cases, it is 
identified and terminated antenatally. In this report, the authors present a 
case of Meckel-Gruber syndrome together with Dandy-Walker malformation. A 
pregnant woman referred at the 28th week of gestation with an abnormal 
ultrasound scan showing posterior encephalocele and bilaterally enlarged 
kidneys. Further imaging also indicated communication between the 4th ventricle 
and posterior cerebellar cerebrospinal fluid space, after which the fetus was 
diagnosed with Meckel-Gruber syndrome and Dandy-Walker malformation. Pregnancy 
termination was refused by the parents and the offspring was prematurely born to 
be the 2nd recurrence of Meckel-Gruber syndrome in this consanguine family. 
Remarkably, at the 3 different pregnancies, ultrasound was inconclusive before 
the 7th month of gestation. Though up to date Meckel-Gruber syndrome is 
ultimately lethal, the lifespan of affected newborns varied greatly. We suggest 
developing a severity classification to estimate life expectancy in unterminated 
cases.

Feeding behavior is essential for growth and survival of animals; however, 
relatively little is known about its intrinsic mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate 
that Gart is expressed in the glia, fat body, and gut and positively regulates 
feeding behavior via cooperation and coordination. Gart in the gut is crucial 
for maintaining endogenous feeding rhythms and food intake, while Gart in the 
glia and fat body regulates energy homeostasis between synthesis and metabolism. 
These roles of Gart further impact Drosophila lifespan. Importantly, Gart 
expression is directly regulated by the CLOCK/CYCLE heterodimer via canonical 
E-box, in which the CLOCKs (CLKs) in the glia, fat body, and gut positively 
regulate Gart of peripheral tissues, while the core CLK in brain negatively 
controls Gart of peripheral tissues. This study provides insight into the 
complex and subtle regulatory mechanisms of feeding and lifespan extension in 
animals.

OBJECTIVES: Understanding iodine deficiency (ID) burdens and trends in Asia can 
help guide effective intervention strategies. This study aims to report the 
incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of ID in 48 
Asian countries during the period 1990-2019.
STUDY DESIGN: Data on ID were retrieved from the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 and estimated by age, sex, 
geographical region, and sociodemographic index (SDI).
METHODS: The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to 
evaluate the changing trend of age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), 
age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) 
related to ID during the period 1990-2019.
RESULTS: In Asia, there were 126,983,965.8 cases with 5,466,213.1 new incidence 
and 1,765,995.5 DALYs of ID in 2019. Between 1999 and 2019, the EAPC in ASIR, 
ASPR and ASDR were -0.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.8 to -0.4), -0.9 (95% 
CI, -1.2 to -0.7), and -1.6 (95% CI, -1.8 to -1.5), respectively. Malaysia 
charted the largest decrease in ASIR, ASPR, and ASDR (82.4%, 85.3%, and 80.9% 
separately), whereas the Philippines and Pakistan were the only two countries 
that witnessed an increase in ASIR and ASPR. ID burdens were more pronounced in 
women, countries located to the south of the Himalayas, and low-middle SDI 
regions.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence, prevalence, and DALYs of ID in Asia substantially 
decreased from 1990 to 2019. Women and low-middle SDI countries have relatively 
high ID burdens. Governments need to pay constant attention to the 
implementation and monitoring of universal salt iodization.

The global health landscape has experienced a shift towards non-communicable 
diseases, with cardiovascular diseases and cancer as leading causes of 
mortality. Although advancements in healthcare have led to an increase in life 
expectancy, they have concurrently resulted in a greater burden of chronic 
health conditions. Unintended consequences of anticancer therapies on various 
tissues, particularly the cardiovascular system, contribute to elevated 
morbidity and mortality rates that are not directly attributable to cancer. 
Consequently, the field of cardio-oncology has emerged to address the prevalence 
of CVD in cancer survivors and the cardiovascular toxicity associated with 
cancer therapies. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been found to play a crucial 
role in early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics within the realm of 
cardio-oncology. This comprehensive review evaluates the risk assessment of 
cancer survivors concerning the acquisition of adverse cardiovascular 
consequences, investigates the association of ncRNAs with CVD in patients 
undergoing cancer treatment, and delves into the role of ncRNAs in the 
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CVD in patients with a history of 
anti-cancer therapy. A thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of cancer 
therapy-related cardiovascular disease and the involvement of ncRNAs in 
cardio-oncology will enable healthcare professionals to provide anticancer 
treatment with minimized cardiovascular side effects, thereby improving patient 
outcomes. Ultimately, this comprehensive analysis aims to provide valuable 
insights into the complex interplay between cancer and cardiovascular diseases, 
facilitating the development of more effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and 
preventive strategies in the burgeoning field of cardio-oncology.

A financial recession has been associated with a decrease in all-cause 
mortality, but little is known about how psychosocial fluctuations in stress 
tolerance or orientation to life affect this association. Sense of Coherence 
(SOC) is a core construct in the Salutogenic Model of Health and is determined 
by generalized resistance resources and measures one's orientation to life by 
comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. We followed the mortality 
of a cohort of middle-aged Finnish men (n = 854) from the 1980s to the end of 
2019. The cohort baseline was stratified into four age groups at baseline: 42, 
48, 54, and 60. SOC was measured twice, at the baseline and at the 11-year 
follow-up visit. Between these SOC measurements, Finland confronted a deep 
financial recession, the effects of which were examined at the follow-up visit 
by questionnaires related to economic hardship (sum of nine items) and 
experience of the recession (one item). Using age group, marital status, 
employment status, and education as covariates, the change in SOC mediated both 
the economic hardship and the experience of recession relations to mortality: 
the indirect effects -19.57 (95% CI -43.23 to -0.92), and -26.82 (95% CI -59.52 
to -0.61), respectively. Every one-point increase in economic hardship predicted 
about 2 and a half weeks shorter life expectancy, and those who experienced very 
strong disadvantages of economic recession had about 3 and a half months lower 
life expectancy by the end of 2019 than those who fully avoided the 
disadvantages. Furthermore, the younger age groups, 42 and 48, experienced the 
recession more severely than the older groups, 54 and 60. We conclude that 
following how orientation to life changes among middle-aged might be an 
informative approach after a recession.

Recombinant human arginase I (rhArg I) have emerged as a potential candidate for 
the treatment of varied pathophysiological conditions ranging from 
arginine-auxotrophic cancer, inflammatory conditions and microbial infection. 
However, rhArg I have a low circulatory half-life, leading to poor 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, which necessitating the rapid 
development of modifications to circumvent these limitations. To address this, 
polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated-rhArg I variants are being developed by 
pharmaceutical companies. However, because of the limitations associated with 
the clinical use of PEGylated proteins, there is a dire need in the art to 
develop rhArg I variant(s) which is safe (devoid of limitations of PEGylated 
counterpart) and possess increased circulatory half-life. In this study, we 
described the generation and characterization of a fused human arginase I 
variant (FHA-3) having improved circulatory half-life. FHA-3 protein was 
engineered by fusing rhArg I with a half-life extension partner (domain of human 
serum albumin) via a peptide linker and was produced using P. pastoris 
expression system. This purified biopharmaceutical (FHA-3) exhibits (i) 
increased arginine-hydrolyzing activity in buffer, (ii) cofactor - independency, 
(iii) increased circulatory half-life (t1/2) and (iv) potent anti-cancer 
activity against human cancer cell lines under in vitro and in vivo conditions.

BACKGROUND: Assessment of quality of life (QoL) has become an important 
indicator for chronic neurological diseases. While these conditions often limit 
personal independence and autonomy, they are also associated with 
treatment-related problems and reduced life expectancy. Epilepsy has a 
tremendous impact on the QoL of patients and their families, which is often 
underestimated by practitioners. The aim of this work was to identify relevant 
factors affecting QoL in adults with epilepsy.
METHODS: This cross-sectional, multicenter study was conducted at four 
specialized epilepsy centers in Germany. Patients diagnosed with epilepsy 
completed a standardized questionnaire focusing on QoL and aspects of healthcare 
in epilepsy. Univariate regression analyses and pairwise comparisons were 
performed to identify variables of decreased QoL represented by the overall 
Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31) score. The variables were then 
considered in a multivariate regression analysis after multicollinearity 
analysis.
RESULTS: Complete datasets for the QOLIE-31 were available for 476 patients (279 
[58.6%] female, 197 [41.4%] male, mean age 40.3 years [range 18-83 years]). 
Multivariate regression analysis revealed significant associations between low 
QoL and a high score on the Liverpool Adverse Events Profile (LAEP; beta=-0.28, 
p < 0.001), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - depression subscale (HADS-D; 
beta=-0.27, p < 0.001), Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory in Epilepsy 
(NDDI-E; beta=-0.19, p < 0.001), revised Epilepsy Stigma Scale (beta=-0.09, 
p = 0.027), or Seizure Worry Scale (beta=-0.18, p < 0.001) and high seizure 
frequency (beta = 0.14, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Epilepsy patients had reduced QoL, with a variety of associated 
factors. In addition to disease severity, as measured by seizure frequency, the 
patient's tolerability of anti-seizure medications and the presence of 
depression, stigma, and worry about new seizures were strongly associated with 
poor QoL. Diagnosed comorbid depression was underrepresented in the cohort; 
therefore, therapeutic decisions should always consider individual 
psychobehavioral and disease-specific aspects. Signs of drug-related adverse 
events, depression, fear, or stigmatization should be actively sought to ensure 
that patients receive personalized and optimized treatment.

The glycoside hydrolase family contains enzymes that break the glycosidic bonds 
of carbohydrates by hydrolysis. Inulinase is one of the most important 
industrial enzymes in the family of Glycoside Hydrolases 32 (GH32). In this 
study, to identify and classify bacterial inulinases initially, 16,002 protein 
sequences belonging to the GH32 family were obtained using various databases. 
The inulin-effective enzymes (endoinulinase and exoinulinase) were identified. 
Eight endoinulinases (EC 3.2.1.7) and 4318 exoinulinases (EC 3.2.1.80) were 
found. Then, the localization of endoinulinase and exoinulinase enzymes in the 
cell was predicted. Among them, two extracellular endoinulinases and 1232 
extracellular exoinulinases were found. The biochemical properties of 363 
enzymes of the genus Arthrobacter, Bacillus, and Streptomyces (most abundant) 
showed that exoinulinases have an acid isoelectric point up to the neutral range 
due to their amino acid length. That is, the smaller the protein (336 aa), the 
more acidic the pI (4.39), and the larger the protein (1207 aa), the pI is in 
the neutral range (8.84). Also, a negative gravitational index indicates the 
hydrophilicity of exoinulinases. Finally, considering the biochemical properties 
affecting protein stability and post-translational changes studies, one enzyme 
for endoinulinase and 40 enzymes with desirable characteristics were selected to 
identify their enzyme production sources. To screen and isolate 
enzyme-containing strains, now with the expansion of databases and the 
development of bioinformatics tools, it is possible to classify, review and 
analyze a lot of data related to different enzyme-producing strains. Although, 
in laboratory studies, a maximum of 20 to 30 strains can be examined. Therefore, 
when more strains are examined, finally, strains with more stable and efficient 
enzymes were selected and introduced for laboratory activities. The findings of 
this study can help researchers to select the appropriate gene source from 
introduced strains for cloning and expression heterologous inulinase, or to 
extract native inulinase from introduced strains.
