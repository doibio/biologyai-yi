Severely-debilitating or life-threatening (SDLT) diseases include conditions in 
which life expectancy is short or quality of life is greatly diminished despite 
available therapies. As such, the medical context for SDLT diseases is 
comparable to advanced cancer and the benefit vs. risk assessment and 
development of SDLT disease therapeutics should be similar to that of advanced 
cancer therapeutics. A streamlined development approach would allow patients 
with SDLT conditions earlier access to therapeutics and increase the speed of 
progression through development. In addition, this will likely increase the SDLT 
disease therapeutic pipeline, directly benefiting patients and reducing the 
economic and societal burden of SDLT conditions. Using advanced-stage heart 
failure (HF) as an example that illustrates the concepts applicable to other 
SDLT indications, this article proposes a streamlined development paradigm for 
SDLT disease therapeutics and recommends development of aligned global 
regulatory guidance.

OBJECTIVE The clinical outcomes and complications of patients who underwent 
pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) for various diagnoses were compared. More 
specifically, the purpose was to identify if outcomes differed between patients 
with flat-back syndrome after lumbar fusion (FBS-LF) versus patients who 
underwent surgery for adult spinal deformity (ASD). METHODS A retrospective 
analysis of 104 patients who underwent a PSO for sagittal plane imbalance was 
performed. There were 28 patients with FBS-LF and 76 patients with various forms 
of ASD. Outcome was measured using visual analog scale (VAS)-back, VAS-leg, 
Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (range 0-100 for all scales), and EQ-5D scores 
(range 0-1). Patients also rated their global outcomes as much better, better, 
unchanged, or worse at follow-up. The minimum follow-up was 1 year (range 1-4 
years). Clinical outcomes and complications were compared between the 2 groups 
of patients. RESULTS The most common level of PSO was L-3 and L-2; 100 single 
and 4 double PSOs were performed. The average local correction by PSO itself was 
27.2°. The sagittal vertical axis (SVA) improved from a mean preoperative value 
of 74 ± 23 mm to 49 ± 20 mm at the final follow-up. The VAS-back, ODI, and EQ-5D 
scores improved significantly for the entire group by 33, 16, and 0.31 points, 
respectively. In total, 57% of patients reported that they were "much better" or 
"better" than before surgery. Preoperatively, as well as postoperatively, the 
FBS-LF patients reported significantly worse VAS scores. According to VAS-back 
results, the ASD group improved by 34 points compared with 29 points in FBS-LF 
patients. ODI scores were similar between the 2 groups preoperatively but 
improved significantly more in the ASD group (18 points) compared with the 
FBS-LF group (13 points). The EQ-5D scores improved from 0.07 to 0.35 in FBS-LF 
patients, and from 0.21 to 0.56 on average in ASD patients. Similarly, a "much 
better" or "better" outcome compared with before surgery was reported by 72% of 
patients in the ASD group compared with 24% of patients in the FBS-LF group (p < 
0.001). The overall reoperation rate was 31%: 46% of patients in the FBS-LF 
group compared with 25% of patients in the ASD group. There were 19 (18%) dural 
tears, 14 (13.5%) surgical site infections, 12 (11.5%) instances of 
pseudarthrosis, 15 (14%) proximal junctional failures, and 2 distal junctional 
failures. The 12 (11%) neurological complications were dominated by partial 
weakness of hip flexion and knee extension, and all but 2 of these were 
temporary. CONCLUSIONS PSO is a safe and effective method for correcting 
sagittal plane imbalance due to multiple etiologies. The authors found patient 
satisfaction to be high, and health-related quality of life was greatly improved 
by the procedure in patients with ASD. In contrast, in FBS-LF patients, a 
suboptimal outcome was observed and the cautious use of PSO seems warranted in 
this subset of patients.

OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of using a 
two-layer cohesive compression bandage (TLCCB; Coban 2) compared with a 
two-layer compression system (TLCS; KTwo) and a four-layer compression system 
(FLCS; Profore) in treating newly-diagnosed venous leg ulcers (VLUs) in clinical 
practice in the UK, from the perspective of the NHS.
METHOD: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of the case records of patients 
with newly-diagnosed VLUs randomly extracted from The Health Improvement Network 
(THIN) database (a nationally representative database of clinical practice among 
patients registered with general practitioners in the UK) who were treated with 
either TLCCB (n=200), TLCS (n=200) or FLCS (n=200). The clinical outcomes and 
cost-effectiveness of the alternative compression systems were estimated over 
six months after starting treatment.
RESULTS: Patients' mean age was 72 years and 58% were female. Time from wound 
onset to the start of compression was a mean of two months, and when starting 
compression the wound size was a mean of 45 cm2. The distribution of healing was 
significantly different between the three groups; 76% of wounds in the TLCCB 
group healed by six months compared with 70% and 64% in the TLCS and FLCS 
groups, respectively (p=0.006). Time to healing was significantly less in the 
TLCCB group compared with the two other groups (p=0.003). Patients in the TLCCB 
group experienced better health-related quality of life over six months (0.413 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient), compared with the TLCS and 
FLCS groups (0.404 and 0.396 QALYs per patient, respectively). The mean 
six-month NHS management cost was £3045, £3842 and £4480 per patient in the 
TLCCB, TLCS and FLCS groups, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Real-world evidence demonstrates that treating newly-diagnosed VLUs 
with TLCCB, compared with the other two compression systems, affords a more 
cost-effective use of NHS-funded resources in clinical practice since it 
resulted in an increased healing rate, better health-related quality of life and 
a reduction in NHS management cost.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is an increasingly common condition worldwide 
with significant costs associated with its management. Identification of 
musculoskeletal risk factors that can be treated clinically before the 
development of LBP could reduce costs and improve the quality of life of 
individuals. Therefore the aim was to systematically review prospective cohort 
studies investigating lower back and / or lower limb musculoskeletal risk 
factors in the development of LBP.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and the Cochrane Library 
were searched from inception to February 2016. No age, gender or occupational 
restrictions of participants were applied. Articles had to be published in 
English and have a 12 month follow-up period. Musculoskeletal risk factors were 
defined as any osseous, ligamentous, or muscular structure that was quantifiably 
measured at baseline. Studies were excluded if participants were pregnant, 
diagnosed with cancer, or had previous low back surgery. Two authors 
independently reviewed and selected relevant articles. Methodological quality 
was evaluated independently by two reviewers using a generic tool for 
observational studies.
RESULTS: Twelve articles which evaluated musculoskeletal risk factors for the 
development of low back pain in 5459 participants were included. Individual 
meta-analyses were conducted based on risk factors common between studies. 
Meta-analysis revealed that reduced lateral flexion range of motion (OR = 0.41, 
95% CI 0.24-0.73, p = 0.002), limited lumbar lordosis (OR = 0.73, 95% CI 
0.55-0.98, p = 0.034), and restricted hamstring range of motion (OR = 0.96, 95% 
CI 0.94-0.98, p = 0.001) were significantly associated with the development of 
low back pain. Meta-analyses on lumbar extension range of motion, quadriceps 
flexibility, fingertip to floor distance, lumbar flexion range of motion, back 
muscle strength, back muscle endurance, abdominal strength, erector spinae cross 
sectional area, and quadratus lumborum cross sectional area showed 
non-significant results.
CONCLUSION: In summary, we found that a restriction in lateral flexion and 
hamstring range of motion as well as limited lumbar lordosis were associated 
with an increased risk of developing LBP. Future research should aim to measure 
additional lower limb musculoskeletal risk factors, have follow up periods of 
6-12 months, adopt a standardised definition of LBP, and only include 
participants who have no history of LBP.

BACKGROUND: Several evaluations of the cost-effectiveness (CE) of menopausal 
hormone therapy (MHT) have been reported. The aim of this study was to 
systematically a﻿nd critically review economic evaluations of MHT since 2002, 
after the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial results on MHT were published.
METHODS: The inclusion criteria for the review were: CE analyses of MHT versus 
no treatment, published from 2002-2016, in healthy women, which included both 
symptom relief outcomes and a range of longer term health outcomes (breast 
cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, fractures and colorectal cancer). 
Included economic models had outcomes expressed in cost per quality-adjusted 
life year or cost per life year saved. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Evidence-Based Medicine 
Reviews databases and the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry were searched. CE 
evaluations were assessed in regard to (i) reporting standards using the CHEERS 
checklist and Drummond checklist; (ii) data sources for the utility of MHT with 
respect to menopausal symptom relief; (iii) cost derivation; (iv) outcomes 
considered in the models; and (v) the comprehensiveness of the models with 
respect to factors related to MHT use that impact long term outcomes, using 
breast cancer as an example outcome.
RESULTS: Five studies satisfying the inclusion criteria﻿ were identified which 
modelled cohorts of women aged 50 and older who used combination or 
estrogen-only MHT for 5-15 years. For women 50-60 years of age, all evaluations 
found MHT to be cost-effective and below the willingness-to-pay threshold of the 
country for which the analysis was conducted. However, 3 analyses based the 
quality of life (QOL) benefit for symptom relief on one small primary study. 
Examination of costing methods identified a need for further clarity in the 
methodology used to aggregate costs from sources. Using breast cancer as an 
example outcome, risks as measured in the WHI were used in the majority of 
evaluations. Apart from the type and duration of MHT use, other effect modifiers 
﻿for breast cancer outcomes (for example body mass index) ﻿were not considered.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review identified issues which could impact the 
outcome of MHT CE analyses and the generalisability of their results. The 
estimated CE of MHT is driven largely by estimates of QOL improvements 
associated with symptom relief but data sources on these utility weights are 
limited. Future analyses should carefully consider data sources and the evidence 
on the long term risks of MHT use in terms of chronic disease. Th﻿is review 
﻿highlights the considerable ﻿difficulties in conducting cost-effectiveness 
analyses in situations where short term benefits of an intervention must be 
evaluated in the context of long term health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Intravenous rituximab is the standard of care in B-cell non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, and is administered over 1·5-6 h. A subcutaneous formulation could 
reduce patients' treatment burden and improve resource utilisation in health 
care. We aimed to show the pharmacokinetic non-inferiority of subcutaneous 
rituximab to intravenous rituximab in follicular lymphoma and to provide 
efficacy and safety data.
METHODS: SABRINA is a two-stage, randomised, open-label phase 3 study at 113 
centres in 30 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had 
histologically confirmed, previously untreated, CD20-positive grade 1, 2, or 3a 
follicular lymphoma; Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group performance statuses of 
0-2; bidimensionally measurable disease (by CT or MRI); life expectancy of 6 
months or more; adequate haematological function for 28 days or more; and one or 
more symptoms requiring treatment according to the Groupe d'Etudes des Lymphomes 
Folliculaires criteria. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by investigators 
or members of the research team via a dynamic randomisation algorithm to 375 
mg/m2 intravenous rituximab or 1400 mg subcutaneous rituximab, plus chemotherapy 
(six-to-eight cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and 
prednisone [CHOP] or eight cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and 
prednisone [CVP]), every 3 weeks during induction, then rituximab maintenance 
every 8 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by selected chemotherapy, Follicular 
Lymphoma International Prognostic Index, and region. The primary endpoint for 
stage 2 was overall response (ie, confirmed complete response, unconfirmed 
complete response, and partial response) at the end of induction. Efficacy 
analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. Pooled data from stages 
1 and 2 are reported on the basis of the clinical cutoff date of the last 
patient completing the maintenance phase of the study. This trial is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01200758; new patients are no longer being 
recruited, but some patients are still being followed up.
FINDINGS: Between Feb 15, 2011, and May 15, 2013, 410 patients were randomly 
assigned, 205 to intravenous rituximab and 205 to subcutaneous rituximab. 
Investigator-assessed overall response at the end of induction was 84·9% (95% CI 
79·2-89·5) in the intravenous group and 84·4% (78·7-89·1) in the subcutaneous 
group. The frequency of adverse events was similar in both groups (199 [95%] of 
210 in the intravenous group vs 189 [96%] of 197 in the subcutaneous group); the 
frequency of adverse events of grade 3 or higher was also similar (116 [55%] vs 
111 [56%]). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse event was neutropenia, 
which occurred in 44 patients (21%) in the intravenous group and 52 (26%) in the 
subcutaneous group. Serious adverse events occurred in 72 patients (34%) in the 
intravenous group and 73 (37%) in the subcutaneous group. Administration-related 
reactions occurred in 73 patients (35%) in the intravenous group and 95 (48%) 
patients in the subcutaneous group (mainly grade 1 or 2 local injection-site 
reactions).
INTERPRETATION: Intravenous and subcutaneous rituximab had similar efficacy and 
safety profiles, and no new safety concerns were noted. Subcutaneous 
administration does not compromise the anti-lymphoma activity of rituximab when 
given with chemotherapy.

AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of LUCAS-2, a mechanical device for 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as compared to manual chest compressions in 
adults with non-traumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
METHODS: We analysed patient-level data from a large, pragmatic, multi-centre 
trial linked to administrative secondary care data from the Hospital Episode 
Statistics (HES) to measure healthcare resource use, costs and outcomes in both 
arms. A within-trial analysis using quality adjusted life years derived from the 
EQ-5D-3L was conducted at 12-month follow-up and results were extrapolated to 
the lifetime horizon using a decision-analytic model.
RESULTS: 4471 patients were enrolled in the trial (1652 assigned to the LUCAS-2 
group, 2819 assigned to the control group). At 12 months, 89 (5%) patients 
survived in the LUCAS-2 group and 175 (6%) survived in the manual CPR group. In 
the vast majority of analyses conducted, both within-trial and by extrapolation 
of the results over a lifetime horizon, manual CPR dominates LUCAS-2. In other 
words, patients in the LUCAS-2 group had poorer health outcomes (i.e. lower 
QALYs) and incurred higher health and social care costs.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the use of the mechanical chest 
compression device LUCAS-2 represents poor value for money when compared to 
standard manual chest compression in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

OBJECTIVES: To describe and systematically review the modelling and reporting of 
cost-effectiveness analysis of vaccination in Hong Kong, and to identify areas 
for quality enhancement in future cost-effectiveness analyses.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive and systematic review of 
cost-effectiveness studies related to vaccination and government immunisation 
programmes in Hong Kong published from 1990 to 2015, through database search of 
Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and OVID Medline. Methodological quality of 
selected studies was assessed using Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation 
Reporting Standards checklist (CHEERS). Decision making of vaccination was 
obtained from Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases (SCVPD) and 
Department of Health in Hong Kong.
RESULTS: Nine eligible studies reporting twelve comparative cost-effectiveness 
comparisons of vaccination programme for influenza (n=2), pneumococcal disease 
(n=3), influenza plus pneumococcal disease (n=1), chickenpox (n=2), Haemophilus 
influenzae b (n=1), hepatitis A (n=1), cervical cancer (n=1) and rotavirus (n=1) 
were identified. Ten comparisons (83.3%) calculated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a vaccination strategy versus status quo as 
outcomes in terms of cost in USD per life-years, cost per quality-adjusted 
life-years, or cost per disability-adjusted life-years. Among those 10 
comparisons in base-case scenario, 4 evaluated interventions were cost-saving 
relative to status quo while the ICER estimates in 3 of the 6 remaining 
comparisons were far below commonly accepted threshold and WHO 
willingness-to-pay threshold, suggestive of very cost-effective. Seven studies 
were of good quality based on the CHEERS checklist; one was of moderate quality; 
and one was of excellent quality. The common methodological problems were 
characterisation of heterogeneity and reporting of study parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a paucity of cost-effectiveness models evaluating 
vaccination targeted to the Hong Kong population. All evaluated vaccinations and 
immunisation interventions in Hong Kong, except for Haemophilus influenzae b, 
hepatitis A and HPV vaccinations, were considered either cost-saving or very 
cost-effective when compared to status quo.

empirically investigates, whether technology continues to be a major driver of 
real per capita health expenditure, along with some control variables such as 
per capita income and life expectancy, in the United States, during the period 
1960-2012. Specifically, the paper applies the most recent cointegration tests 
under multiple structural breaks and extends the work of Okunade (J Health Econ 
21(1):147-159, 2002) with the possibility whether a linear cointegration model 
with multiple structural breaks would provide a better economic model to 
quantify the impact of some major determinants of US real per capita health 
expenditure. This paper presents evidence to show that per capita real income, 
technology as indicated by four proxy measures and life expectancy at birth are 
some major drivers of real per capita health expenditure in the United States. 
Contrary to the available evidence in the literature, the finding of this paper 
is that the point aggregate income elasticity of health expenditure estimate is 
less than one, indicating that health care has evolved to become a necessity in 
the United States. Policy implications of the empirical findings are discussed 
in the paper.

Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive disease with an incidence of 
approximately 1 case per 100,000-200,000 live births. Over the years, gaining 
in-depth knowledge of the disease has led to vast improvement in patient life 
expectancy. However, debilitating, extra-renal manifestations such as eye 
disease, in particular corneal crystal deposition and its associated 
photophobia, still occur frequently, regardless of patient age and 
notwithstanding the increased implementation of systemic therapy. 
Ophthalmological assessment has not yet been standardized. The aim of this 
article was to provide clear recommendations for ophthalmological assessment 
during follow-up of patients with cystinosis to improve quality and regularity 
of ophthalmological care and thereby minimize ophthalmological complications. A 
literature search was performed to assess previous and current recommendations 
on examinations to conduct during follow-up of patients with cystinosis. 
Multidisciplinary cystinosis clinics were set up in collaboration with the 
Department of Ophthalmology and the Department of Pediatric Nephrology to allow 
patients to be seen by a nephrologist, an ophthalmologist and other specialists 
on the same day. Based on the results of these multidisciplinary clinics the 
standardized clinical ophthalmological assessment was drafted. This is a 
protocol for follow-up, describing the approach taken regarding ophthalmological 
follow-up of patients with cystinosis, considering the different types of the 
disease and the time since diagnosis. Standard examination includes history, 
visual acuity, tonometry and slit-lamp examination, with fundus photography 
performed at diagnosis and annually thereafter. Confocal microscopy is the 
imaging modality of choice, while anterior segment optical coherence tomography 
(OCT) is a good alternative. Finally, posterior segment OCT for imaging of the 
macular region and optic nerve should be conducted on an annual basis.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to develop two diabetes-specific 
preference-based measures [the Diabetes Health Profile-3 Dimension (DHP-3D) and 
the Diabetes Health Profile-5 Dimension (DHP-5D)] for use in the calculation of 
Quality Adjusted Life Years, a key outcome in economic evaluation. These 
measures were based on the non-preference-based instrument the Diabetes Health 
Profile.
METHODS: For DHP-3D, psychometric and Rasch analyses were used to develop a 
health state classification system based on the Diabetes Health Profile-18 
(DHP-18). The DHP-5D added two dimensions to the DHP-3D to extend the range of 
impacts measured. Each classification system was valued by 150 general public 
respondents in the United Kingdom using Time Trade Off (TTO). Multivariate 
regression was used to estimate utility value sets. The matched dimensions 
across each measure were compared using z-score tests.
RESULTS: The DHP-3D included three dimensions defined as mood, eating and social 
limitations, and the DHP-5D added dimensions defined as hypoglycaemic attacks 
and vitality. For both, the random effects generalized least squares regression 
model produced consistent value sets, with the DHP-3D and DHP-5D ranging from 
0.983 (best state) to 0.717 (worst state), and 0.979 to 0.618 respectively. The 
addition of the two extra dimensions leads to significant differences for the 
more severe levels of each matched dimension.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed two diabetes-specific preference-based measures 
that, subject to psychometric assessment, can be used to provide 
condition-specific utility values to complement generic utilities from more 
widely validated measures such as the EuroQol-5 Dimension.

CONTEXT: The incidence of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) increases with 
age. With increased life expectancy the number of elderly MIBC patients is 
expected to increase. Existing guidelines on management of MIBC do not preclude 
curative treatments for elderly patients. However, it is necessary to assess the 
risks and benefits of a treatment to avoid overtreatment that results in 
decreased health-related quality of life without prolonging survival.
OBJECTIVE: To report on overall survival (OS), cancer specific survival (CSS), 
and morbidity after curative treatment in elderly patients, defined as age >70 
yr, with nonmetastatic MIBC and to compare this with the outcome of younger MIBC 
patients.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review was performed using Medline, PubMed, 
and Embase databases. Articles were included if they addressed one of the three 
research questions: Only articles including >100 patients and with a clear 
age-stratification were included.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Forty-two articles were retrieved for review. No article 
directly addressed the use of geriatric assessment. OS and CSS worsen 
significantly with age both after radical cystectomy and radiotherapy regimens. 
While POM significantly increases with age, morbidity seems comparable between 
younger and older patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a proportion of elderly patients with MIBC will benefit 
from curative treatment, we observed worse OS, CSS, and POM with age. The impact 
of age on late morbidity is less clear. Prospective studies evaluating geriatric 
assessments are critically needed to optimize MIBC management in the elderly.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We performed a systematic review to evaluate the outcome and 
complication rate in elderly patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. We 
observed that overall survival and cancer specific survival significantly 
decrease and perioperative mortality significantly increases with age. The 
impact of age on late morbidity is less clear. There is a need for geriatric 
assessments to select those patients that will benefit from curative treatment.

In developed countries, women are expected to live about 4-5 years longer than 
men. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to gauge the extent to which 
gender differences in longevity can be attributed to gender-specific preferences 
and health behavior. We set up a physiologically founded model of health deficit 
accumulation and calibrate it using recent insights from gerontology. From 
fitting life cycle health expenditure and life expectancy, we obtain estimates 
of the gender-specific preference parameters. We then perform the counterfactual 
experiment of endowing women with the preferences of men. In our benchmark 
scenario, this reduces the gender gap in life expectancy from 4.6 to 1.4 years. 
When we add gender-specific preferences for unhealthy consumption, the model can 
motivate up to 89 percent of the gender gap. Our theory offers also an economic 
explanation for why the gender gap declines with rising income.

INTRODUCTION: Ukraine occupies the 143 place in the world in life expectancy and 
the first place in terms of mortality. The main cause of death - cardiovascular 
diseases - 58%. Recent studies show the important and independent role of 
endothelium in the development of cardiovascular disease.
THE AIM: examination of the endothelium destruction in aging men by determining 
the level of surface specific antigens of endothelial microparticles.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 88 men age from 45 to 76 years. 50 people of the main 
group had a history of the second type diabetes mellitus (DM-2) combined with 
arterial hypertension (AH). The control group included 38 men without 
aforementioned diseases. Also, men were divided into two groups by age: 45-59 
years and over 60.
RESULTS: in the main subgroup I endothelin level was higher than the control 
subgroup I: 2,07 ± 0,6 and 1,27 ± 0,25 (p <0.05). In main subgroup II endothelin 
level was also significantly higher compared with the specified index in control 
subgroup II: 3,91 ± 0,7 and 1,79 ± 0,27 (p <0.05). Among patients of the main 
subgroup II endothelin level (3,88 ± 0,7 and 2,04 ± 0,6 (p <0.05)), and 
triglycerides (2,77 ± 0,08 vs. 1.99 ± 0.05 (p <0.05)) was higher compared with 
the I subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS: age androgen deficiency is accompanied by lipid metabolism, 
development of endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, diabetes and 
hypertension. Reduction of the cardiovascular risk includes measures aimed at 
normalizing hormonal balance and lipid metabolism in aging men with DM-2 and 
hypertension.

BACKGROUND: The extended use of varicella vaccine in adults aged 50 and older 
against herpes zoster (HZ) was recently approved in Japan, which has raised the 
need to evaluate its value for money.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov modelling to 
evaluate the efficiency of varicella vaccine immunisation programme for the 
elderly in Japan. Four strategies with different ages to receive a shot of 
vaccine were set, namely: (1) 65-84, (2) 70-84, (3) 75-84 and (4) 80-84years old 
(y.o.). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) compared with no programme 
from societal perspective were calculated. The health statuses following the 
target cohort are as follows: without any HZ-related disease, acute HZ followed 
by recovery, post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) followed by recovery, post HZ/PHN, 
and general death. The transition probabilities, utility weights to estimate 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and disease treatment costs were either 
calculated or cited from literature. Costs of per course of vaccination were 
assumed at ¥10,000 (US$91). The model with one-year cycle runs until the 
surviving individual reached 100 y.o.
RESULTS: ICERs ranged from ¥2,812,000/US$25,680 to ¥3,644,000/US$33,279 per QALY 
gained, with 65-84 y.o. strategy having the lowest ICER and 80-84 y.o. strategy 
the highest. None of the alternatives was strongly dominated by the other, while 
80-84 y.o. and 70-84 y.o. strategy were extendedly dominated by 65-84 y.o.
STRATEGY: Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the probabilities that 
ICER is under ¥5,000,000/US$45,662 per QALY gained was at 100% for 65-84 y.o., 
70-84 y.o., 75-84 y.o. strategy, respectively, and at 98.4% for 80-84 y.o.
CONCLUSION: We found that vaccinating individuals aged 65-84, 70-84, 75-84, and 
80-84 with varicella vaccine to prevent HZ-associated disease in Japan can be 
cost-effective from societal perspective, with 65-84 y.o. strategy as the 
optimal alternative. Results are supported by one-way sensitivity analyses and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

CONTEXT: Accurate estimation of life expectancy in patients with brain 
metastases is critical for counseling and choosing appropriate therapy. 
Performance status is the single greatest determinant of overall survival in 
this population. However, current measures of performance status are subjective 
and often based on brief clinical encounters. Gait speed is an objective, 
reliable predictor of overall health and survival.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between 
gait speed and survival in patients with brain metastases.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with documented 
gait speed and Karnofsky performance status seen in consultation for newly 
diagnosed brain metastases from 2014 to 2015. Gait speed was measured during 
neurological examination over 4 m at normal pace. Graded prognostic assessment 
scores were calculated from clinical information. The primary outcomes were 
overall survival and 30-day mortality.
RESULTS: Eighty-five of 88 patients (97%) met inclusion criteria. Overall, the 
median gait speed was 0.7 m/s (range 0-1.0 m/s). Gait speed was associated with 
increased overall survival in addition to graded prognostic assessment score. 
Median survival was longer in patients with normal gait speed (>0.6 m/s, 
11.9 months) compared to those with slow gait speed (≤0.6 m/s, 4.5 months, 
P < 0.001) or who were nonambulatory (1.1 months, P < 0.001). Thirty-day 
mortality for normal, slow, and nonambulatory patients was 0%, 15%, and 42%, 
respectively. The graded prognostic assessment overestimated actual survival for 
nonambulatory patients (2.2 vs. 1.1 months) and underestimated for those with 
normal gait speed (4.4 vs. 11.9 months).
CONCLUSION: Gait speed is associated with overall survival in patients with 
newly diagnosed brain metastases. Gait speed assessment is simple, objective, 
and may provide additional prognostic information to improve life expectancy 
estimation and management decisions.

BACKGROUND: Uterovaginal prolapse in very elderly women is a growing problem due 
to increased life expectancy. Surgeons and anaesthetists may be wary of 
performing quality of life surgery on this higher risk group. Where surgery is 
undertaken, it is commonly performed vaginally; there is a perception that this 
is better tolerated than abdominal surgery. Little data is published about 
laparoscopic prolapse surgery tolerability in this population, and laparoscopic 
surgery is perceived within the urogynaecological community as complex and 
lengthy and hence inherently unsuitable for the very elderly. In Oxford, UK, 
laparoscopic abdominal surgical techniques are routinely employed for 
urogynaecological reconstructive surgery. The authors offer abdominal 
laparoscopic prolapse surgery to patients suitable for general anaesthesia with 
apical vaginal prolapse, irrespective of age. We here report outcomes in this 
elderly patient cohort and hypothesise these to be acceptable. This is a 
retrospective case note review of all patients aged 79 years old and above 
undergoing laparoscopic prolapse surgery (hysteropexy or sacrocolpopexy) in two 
centres in Oxford, UK, over a 5-year period (n = 55). Data were collected on 
length of surgery, length of stay, intraoperative complications, early and late 
post-operative complications and surgical outcome.
RESULTS: Mean age was 82.6 years (range 79-96). There were no deaths. Minor 
post-operative complications such as UTI and constipation were frequent, but 
there were no serious (Clavien-Dindo grade III or above) complications; 80% 
achieved objective good anatomical outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic prolapse surgery appears well tolerated in the elderly 
with low operative morbidity and mortality.

INTRODUCTION: Among earthquake survivors, children are more vulnerable than 
other age groups due to their exposure to harrowing scenes of devastation as 
well as their drastically new living situations that result from an earthquake 
disaster. The life process of children survivors undergoes many different 
changes that are affected by a wide range of factors. Understanding the life 
process of these children may lead to effective outcomes and interventions. In 
addition, observing children survivors establishes knowledge and understanding 
of the challenges that correspond with earthquake disasters. Further, observing 
this group may be further effective in decision-making and establishing types of 
assistance in similar circumstances.
OBJECTIVES: This study was done to explain the life process of children who 
survived the earthquake of Manjil in northern side of Iran. Methods: This 
qualitative study is based on the grounded theory approach. The sampling 
involved purposive interviews with 12 children who survived the Manjil 
earthquake and were under 12 years of age at the time of the earthquake. The 
initial interviews were followed by continuous comparative analysis, and thus 
the sampling process adopted a theoretical trend. In the end, by the formation 
of categories and the central variable of the study, interviews were conducted 
with 16 subjects and sufficient data was provided. Data was collected through 
face-to-face, in-depth interviews using an interview guide. In order to enrich 
the categories formed in data analysis, we had also 6 telephone interviews with 
the same participants in order to complete missed needed information. Data 
collection began in 2015 and continued up until 2016. Data was analysed using 
the Strauss-Corbin approach.
RESULTS: The life process of children earthquake survivors consists of 
'unexpected encounter', 'transient relief activities' and 'long-lasting 
consequences'. The central variable of this study is 'the dark shadow of pain 
and the light shadow of life expectancy'. The life experience of this group of 
children is immersed in painful memories and varies under different conditions.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, one of the 
factors affecting the lives of children earthquake survivors which could 
threaten their health is providing non-specific and transient services. Training 
relief staff to consider the specific needs of these children at the time of the 
rescue operation could contribute to improving their health level in various 
aspects. Considering the effective and comprehensive rehabilitation program in 
Disaster Management by policymakers can prevent permanent complications caused 
by earthquakes. Planning and taking action to identify misbehaviours in this 
group of children as well as raising public awareness, particularly for parents, 
on how to manage the outcomes of natural disasters are some of the most 
significant public health priorities. Providing public mental health services 
for parents and children who survive an earthquake helps to address potential 
psychological problems in this group of survivors.
