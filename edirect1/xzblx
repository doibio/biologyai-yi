handling. No associations were found between exposure to high strain (high 
demands, low control) during pregnancy and preterm birth, small for gestational 
age, congenital malformations and asthma in the children when compared to women 
exposed to low strain (low demands, high control). A protective effect on large 
for gestational age was observed when exposed to high strain, suggesting an 
impact on the birthweight although it was not seen among the small for 
gestational age children. An association between high strain exposure and ever 
atopic dermatitis in seven-year-old children was observed, with 15% higher odds 
of atopic dermatitis when compared to women exposed to low strain during their 
pregnancy. The effects of high strain found were modest, but even modest effects 
might be relevant with high prevalence as with atopic dermatitis (lifetime 
prevalence of 15-20%). The studies included in this thesis add to the rather 
limited knowledge of prenatal exposure to work-related stress end health 
implications for the child. In the Danish work environment recommendations for 
women being pregnant or breastfeeding work-related stress is only mentioned very 
briefly. Findings from this thesis do not support rewriting in regards to risk 
of preterm birth, low birth weight or malformations. Results did show effects in 
regards to allergic diseases, but as the study is the only one of its kind, 
other studies are needed to replicate the findings if to reconsider the 
recommendations for pregnant women. Future research could benefit of validation 
of the use of two single-item measures of job strain compared to fully validated 
multi-item instruments. A shift toward more "functional endpoints" as overweight 
and cognitive behavioural disorders in the children could be of relevance.

The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that screening with 
low-dose CT versus chest radiography reduced lung cancer mortality by 16% to 
20%. More recently, a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of CT screening for lung 
cancer versus no screening in the NLST was performed. The CEA conformed to the 
reference-case recommendations of the US Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health 
and Medicine, including the use of the societal perspective and an annual 
discount rate of 3%. The CEA was based on several important assumptions. In this 
paper, I review the methods and assumptions used to obtain the base case 
estimate of $81,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In addition, I show 
how this estimate varied widely among different subsets and when some of the 
base case assumptions were changed and speculate on the cost-effectiveness of CT 
screening for lung cancer outside the NLST.

Several pathways modulating longevity and stress resistance converge on 
translation by targeting ribosomal proteins or initiation factors, but whether 
this involves modifications of ribosomal RNA is unclear. Here, we show that 
reduced levels of the conserved RNA methyltransferase NSUN5 increase the 
lifespan and stress resistance in yeast, worms and flies. Rcm1, the yeast 
homologue of NSUN5, methylates C2278 within a conserved region of 25S rRNA. Loss 
of Rcm1 alters the structural conformation of the ribosome in close proximity to 
C2278, as well as translational fidelity, and favours recruitment of a distinct 
subset of oxidative stress-responsive mRNAs into polysomes. Thus, rather than 
merely being a static molecular machine executing translation, the ribosome 
exhibits functional diversity by modification of just a single rRNA nucleotide, 
resulting in an alteration of organismal physiological behaviour, and linking 
rRNA-mediated translational regulation to modulation of lifespan, and 
differential stress response.

INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the principle causes 
of chronic liver disease. Successful treatment significantly decreases the risk 
of hepatic morbidity and mortality. Current standard of care achieves sustained 
virologic response (SVR) rates of 40-80%; however, the HCV therapy landscape is 
rapidly evolving. The objective of this study was to quantify the clinical and 
economic benefit associated with increasing levels of SVR.
METHODS: A published Markov model (MONARCH) that simulates the natural history 
of hepatitis C over a lifetime horizon was used. Discounted and non-discounted 
life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost of complication 
management were estimated for various plausible SVR rates. To demonstrate the 
robustness of projections obtained, the model was validated to ten UK-specific 
HCV studies.
RESULTS: QALY estimates ranged from 18.0 years for those treated successfully in 
fibrosis stage F0 to 7.5 years (discounted) for patients in fibrosis stage F4 
who remain untreated. Predicted QALY gains per 10% improvement in SVR ranged 
from 0.23 (F0) to 0.64 (F4) and 0.58 (F0) to 1.35 (F4) in 40 year old patients 
(discounted and non-discounted results respectively). In those aged 40, 
projected discounted HCV-related costs are minimised with successful treatment 
in F0/F1 (at approximately £ 300), increasing to £ 49,300 in F4 patients who 
remain untreated. Validation of the model to published UK cost-effectiveness 
studies produce R2 goodness of fit statistics of 0.988, 0.978 and of 0.973 for 
total costs, QALYs and incremental cost effectiveness ratios, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Projecting the long-term clinical and economic consequences 
associated with chronic hepatitis C is a necessary requirement for the 
evaluation of new treatments. The principle analysis demonstrates the 
significant impact on expected costs, LYs and QALYs associated with increasing 
SVR. A validation analysis demonstrated the robustness of the results reported.

INTRODUCTION: The life expectancy of prostate patients is long and patients will 
spend many years carrying the burdens & benefits of the treatment decisions they 
have made, therefore, it is vital that decisions on treatments are shared 
between patient and physician. The objective was to determine if consultation 
audio-recording improves quality of life, reduces regret or improves patient 
satisfaction in comparison to standard counselling.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2012 we initiated consultation audio-recordings, where 
patients are given a CD of their consultation to keep and replay at home. We 
conducted a prospective non-randomised study of patient satisfaction, quality of 
life (QOL) and decision regret at 12 months follow-up using posted validated 
questionnaires for the audio-recording (AR) patients and a control cohort. 
Qualitative and thematic analyses were used.
RESULTS: Forty of 59 patients in the AR group, and 27 of 45 patients in the 
control group returned the questionnaires. Patient demographics were similar in 
both groups with no statistically significant differences between the two 
groups. Decision regret was lower in the audio-recording group (11/100) vs 
control group (19/100) (p = 0.04). The risk ratio for not having any long-term 
decision regret was 5.539 (CI 1.643-18.674), with NNT to prevent regret being 4. 
Regression analysis showed that receiving audio-recording was strongest 
predictor for absence of regret even greater than potency and incontinence.
CONCLUSION: The study has shown that audio-recording clinic consultation reduces 
long-term decision regret, increases patient information recall, understanding 
and confidence in their decision. There is great potential for further expansion 
of this low-cost intervention.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is an important risk factor for the development of heart 
failure.
DIAGNOSTICS: In normotensive obese patients, a reduced peripheral resistance is 
typically observed and is accompanied by an increased fluid volume and an 
increase in cardiac work, resulting in hypertrophy and diastolic heart failure, 
which can be visualized with echocardiography. However, in the presence of 
arterial hypertension cardiac geometry is not different to hypertensive heart 
disease without obesity. Furthermore, the typical changes found with obesity, 
such as reduced peripheral resistance and increased blood volume, are no longer 
present. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is very common in obesity and warrants 
screening but levels of the heart failure marker N-terminal pro-brain 
natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) might be misleading as the values are lower in 
obesity than in normal weight controls.
THERAPY: Body weight reduction is advisable but difficult to achieve and much 
more difficult to maintain. Furthermore, diet and exercise has not been proven 
to enhance life expectancy in obesity. However, with bariatric surgery, 
long-term weight reduction can be achieved and mortality can be reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: With effective weight loss and improved clinical outcome after 
bariatric surgery, treatment of obesity has shifted much more into focus. 
Regardless of technical challenges in the work-up of obese patients, clinical 
symptoms suggestive of cardiac disorders warrant prompt investigation with 
standard techniques following recommendations as established for normal weight 
patients.

Previous research has demonstrated that auditory rhythms affect both movement 
and physiological functions. We hypothesized that the ecological sounds of human 
breathing can affect breathing more than artificial sounds of breathing, varying 
in tones for inspiration and expiration. To address this question, we monitored 
the breath duration of participants exposed to three conditions: (a) ecological 
sounds of breathing, (b) artificial sounds of breathing having equal temporal 
features as the ecological sounds, (c) no sounds (control). We found that 
participants' breath duration variability was reduced in the ecological sound 
condition, more than in the artificial sound condition. We suggest that 
ecological sounds captured the timing of breathing better than artificial 
sounds, guiding as a consequence participants' breathing. We interpreted our 
results according to the Theory of Event Coding, providing further support to 
its validity, and suggesting its possible extension in the domain of 
physiological functions which are both consciously and unconsciously controlled.

BACKGROUND: Clinicians' perceptions of screening benefits and harms influence 
their recommendations, which in turn shape patients' screening decisions. We 
sought to understand clinicians' perceptions of the benefits and harms of cancer 
screening by comparing 2 screening tests that differ in their balance of 
potential benefits to harms: colonoscopy, which results in net benefit for many 
adults, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, which may do more harm than 
good.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 126 clinicians at 24 family/internal 
medicine practices completed surveys in which they listed and rated the 
magnitude of colonoscopy and PSA testing benefits and harms for a hypothetical 
70-year-old male patient and then estimated the likelihood that these tests 
would cause harm and lengthen the life of 100 similar men in the next 10 years. 
We tested the hypothesis that the availability heuristic would explain the 
association of screening test to perceived likelihood of benefit/harm and a 
competing hypothesis that clinicians' gist of screening tests as good or bad 
would mediate this association.
RESULTS: Clinicians perceived PSA testing to have a greater likelihood of harm 
and a lower likelihood of lengthening life relative to colonoscopy. Consistent 
with our gist hypothesis, these associations were mediated by clinicians' gist 
of screening (balance of perceived benefits to perceived harms).
LIMITATIONS: Generalizability beyond academic clinicians remains to be 
established.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeting clinicians' gist of screening, for example through 
graphical displays that allow clinicians to make gist-based relative magnitude 
comparisons, may influence their risk perception and possibly reduce 
overrecommendation of screening.

The last several decades have witnessed the emergence of evidence-based medicine 
as the dominant paradigm for medical teaching, research and practice. Under an 
evidence-based approach, populations rather than individuals become the primary 
focus of investigation. Treatment priorities are largely shaped by the 
availability, relevance and quality of evidence and study outcomes and results 
are assumed to have more or less universal significance based on their 
implications at the population level. However, population-level treatment goals 
do not always align with what matters the most to individual patients-who may 
weigh the risks, benefits and harms of recommended treatments quite differently. 
In this article we describe the rise of evidence-based medicine in historical 
context. We discuss limitations of this approach for supporting real-world 
treatment decisions-especially in older adults with confluent comorbidity, 
functional impairment and/or limited life expectancy-and we describe the 
emergence of more patient-centered paradigms to address these limitations. We 
explain how the principles of evidence-based medicine have helped to shape 
contemporary approaches to defining, classifying and managing patients with 
chronic kidney disease. We discuss the limitations of this approach and the 
potential value of a more patient-centered paradigm, with a particular focus on 
the care of older adults with this condition. We conclude by outlining ways in 
which the evidence-base might be reconfigured to better support real-world 
treatment decisions in individual patients and summarize relevant ongoing 
initiatives.

Social organization correlates with longevity across animal taxa. This 
correlation has been explained by selection for longevity by social evolution. 
The reverse causality is also conceivable but has not been sufficiently 
considered. We constructed a simple, spatially structured population model of 
asexually reproducing individuals to study the effect of temporal life history 
structuring on the evolution of cooperation. Individuals employed fixed 
strategies of cooperation or defection towards all neighbours in a basic 
Prisoner's Dilemma paradigm. Individuals aged and transitioned through different 
life history stages asynchronously without migration. An individual's death 
triggered a reproductive event by one immediate neighbour. The specific 
neighbour was chosen probabilistically according to the cumulative payoff from 
all local interactions. Varying the duration of pre-reproductive, reproductive, 
and post-reproductive life history stages, long-term simulations allowed a 
systematic evaluation of the influence of the duration of these specific life 
history stages. Our results revealed complex interactions among the effects of 
the three basic life history stages and the benefit to defect. Overall, a long 
post-reproductive stage promoted the evolution of cooperation, while a prolonged 
pre-reproductive stage has a negative effect. In general, the total length of 
life also increased the probability of the evolution of cooperation. Thus, our 
specific model suggests that the timing of life history transitions and total 
duration of life history stages may affect the evolution of cooperative 
behaviour. We conclude that the causation of the empirically observed 
association of life expectancy and sociality may be more complex than previously 
realized.

BACKGROUND: Because of the increased life-expectancy of persons with HIV, the 
need for age-appropriate colorectal cancer screening among these patients will 
increase. We examined rates of colorectal cancer screening among HIV-infected 
men aged 50 to 65 years.
METHODS: We used Ontario's administrative databases to identify all men between 
the ages of 50 and 65 years who were alive on April 1, 2007, and identified 
HIV-infected men using a validated case-finding algorithm. We excluded men with 
a history of colorectal cancer, anal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and any 
colorectal investigation in the preceding five-years, and used multivariable 
regression to compare rates of colorectal cancer screening between men with and 
without HIV during five years of follow-up.
RESULTS: We identified 743,801 men between the ages of 50 and 65 years, of whom 
1,432 (0.19%) were HIV-infected. The proportions of men with and without HIV who 
underwent any screening during the 5-year follow up period were 49.1% (95% CI 
46.5% to 51.7%) and 41.4% (95% CI 41.3% to 41.5%), respectively. Compared with 
HIV-negative men, men with HIV had lower rates of fecal occult blood testing 
[adjusted rate ratio (aRR) 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.87] and 
barium-enema radiography (aRR 0.66; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.12), but higher rates of 
colonoscopy (aRR 1.24; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.37), flexible sigmoidoscopy (aRR 1.72; 
95% CI 1.28 to 2.30) and rigid sigmoidoscopy (aRR 2.98; 95% CI 2.26 to 3.93).
CONCLUSION: As with the general population of men aged 50 to 65 years, less than 
half of the population of men with HIV received colorectal cancer screening. 
Strategies are required to improve uptake of this intervention.

BACKGROUND: Lung transplantation (LTx) can extend life expectancy and enhance 
the quality of life for select patients with end-stage lung disease. In the 
setting of donor lung shortage and waiting list mortality, the interest in 
donation after cardiocirculatory death (DCD) is increasing. We performed a 
systematic review and meta-analysis to compare outcomes between DCD and 
conventional donation after brain death (DBD).
METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of 
Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched. We identified 
original research studies with 1-year post-transplant survival data involving >5 
DCD transplants. We performed meta-analyses examining 1-year survival, primary 
graft dysfunction, and acute rejection after LTx.
RESULTS: We identified 519 citations; 11 observational cohort studies met our 
inclusion criteria for systematic review, and 6 met our inclusion criteria for 
meta-analysis. There were no differences found in 1-year mortality after LTx 
between DCD and DBD cohorts in individual studies or in the meta-analysis (DCD 
[n = 271] vs DBD [n = 2,369], relative risk [RR] 0.88, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 0.59-1.31, p = 0.52, I(2) = 0%). There was also no difference between DCD 
and DBD in a pooled analysis of 5 studies reporting on primary graft dysfunction 
(RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.68-1.73, p = 0.7, I(2) = 0%) and 4 studies reporting on acute 
rejection (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49-1.05, p = 0.09, I(2) = 0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Survival after LTx from DCD is comparable to survival after LTx 
from DBD in observational cohort studies. DCD appears to be a safe and effective 
method to expand the donor pool.

care systems.

PURPOSE: Targeted cancer therapies (TCTs) are drugs that specifically act on 
molecular targets within the cancer cell, causing its regression and/or 
destruction. Although TCTs offer clinically important gains in survival in one 
of the most challenging therapeutic areas, these gains are followed by 
considerable increases in health care expenditures. The aim of this study was to 
identify differences in the recommendations for TCTs in 3 European health care 
systems (Serbian, Scottish, and Dutch) and to examine the role of 
pharmacoeconomic (PE) assessments in such recommendations.
METHODS: A list of currently approved TCTs cited from the European Medicines 
Agency was cross-referenced with drug reimbursement reports issued by the 
National Health Insurance Fund for Serbia, the Scottish Medicines Consortium for 
Scotland, and the National Health Institute for the Netherlands. The following 
key variables were gathered from the reports: drug indication, registration 
status, reimbursement status, and outcome of the PE evaluation.
FINDINGS: There were 41 TCTs approved by the European Medicines Agency for 70 
cancer indications. Of the total number of TCT indications, 20 were reimbursed 
in Serbia, and 25 are still without a decision from the national agency. The 
remaining TCT indications (n = 25) are not registered in Serbia. None of the 
submissions or the PE analyses were publicly available. The Scottish Medicines 
Consortium positively assessed 26 TCT indications and rejected 30. All 
appraisals were published, and the majority contained full PE assessments. 
Finally, the Dutch agency accepted 60 TCT indications and disapproved the use of 
1. The majority of reimbursed drugs were exempted from PE evaluation in 
accordance with 2 recent policies regarding expensive hospital drugs.
IMPLICATIONS: In the 3 examined health care systems, the reimbursement status of 
the TCTs differed significantly. Level of PE application within the TCT 
evaluation procedures seemed to largely affect the final reimbursement 
decisions. Although, there are special policies in the Netherlands that enabled 
fast access for 98% of the TCTs that applied for reimbursement, a clear 
definition of cost-effectiveness threshold and strict requirements for full cost 
utility assessments in Scotland led to acceptance of only 46% of the TCT 
submissions. More precise PE guidelines must still be designed for TCT 
reimbursement in Serbia. Guidelines must account for specific epidemic and 
economic conditions of the country and could build on the experiences of 
Scotland and the Netherlands.

As life expectancy increases in persons with hemophilia (PWH), more age-related 
diseases such as cancer emerge among this patient group. The aim of this study 
was to investigate incidence and survival of cancers among PWH in Taiwan. We 
analyzed data of 1,054 PWH retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance 
Research Database between 1997 and 2010, by comparing variables to 10540 age- 
and gender-matched healthy individuals from the general population. There were 
43 PWH and 178 individuals of general population with newly diagnosed cancer (RR 
2.42, 95% CI 1.74-3.35). The cumulative incidences of cancer in PWH and the 
general population were 4.7 and 1.9%, respectively. Hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) was the major type of cancer (17 cases) in PWH; cancer rate was still 
increased when HCC and HIV-related cancers were excluded (RR 1.66, 95% CI 
1.06-2.59). There was no significant difference observed in lung, colorectal, or 
prostate cancer occurrence. Compared to the general population, PWH were younger 
at the time of cancer diagnosis (45.1 vs. 57.2 years old, P value < 0.001), and 
had fewer co-morbidities. Nineteen PWH with cancers died during the study 
period, and no bleeding-related death was recorded among these patients. The 
survival rate was not different between PWH and the general population, P = 
0.86. In conclusion, the cumulative incidence of cancer among PWH was higher 
than the general population. PWH with cancer were younger and had fewer 
comorbidities, but the survival rates were similar in the two groups.

BACKGROUND: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the cost-utility 
of bariatric surgery in a lifetime horizon from a Swedish health care payer 
perspective.
METHODS: A decision analytic model using the Markov process was developed 
covering cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and surgical complications. 
Clinical effectiveness and safety were based on the literature and data from the 
Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry. Gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and 
gastric banding were included in the analysis. Cost data were obtained from 
Swedish sources.
RESULTS: Bariatric surgery was cost saving in comparison with conservative 
management. It also led to a substantial reduction in lifetime risk of events: 
from a 16 % reduction in the risk of transient ischaemic attacks to a 62 % 
reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Over a lifetime, surgery led to 
savings of euro 8408 and generated an additional 0.8 years of life and 4.1 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient, which translates into gains of 
32,390 quality-adjusted person-years and savings of euro 66 million for the 
cohort, operated in 2012. Analysis of the consequences of a 3-year delay in 
surgery provision showed that the overall lifetime cost of treatment may be 
increased in patients with diabetes or a body mass index >40 kg/m(2). Delays in 
surgery may also lead to a loss of clinical benefits: up to 0.6 life years and 
1.2 QALYs per patient over a lifetime.
CONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery, over a lifetime horizon, may lead to significant 
cost savings to health care systems in addition to the known clinical benefits.

Physiological geroscience: targeting function to increase healthspan and achieve 
optimal longevity.

Most nations of the world are undergoing rapid and dramatic population ageing, 
which presents great socio-economic challenges, as well as opportunities, for 
individuals, families, governments and societies. The prevailing biomedical 
strategy for reducing the healthcare impact of population ageing has been 
'compression of morbidity' and, more recently, to increase healthspan, both of 
which seek to extend the healthy period of life and delay the development of 
chronic diseases and disability until a brief period at the end of life. Indeed, 
a recently established field within biological ageing research, 'geroscience', 
is focused on healthspan extension. Superimposed on this background are new 
attitudes and demand for 'optimal longevity' - living long, but with good health 
and quality of life. A key obstacle to achieving optimal longevity is the 
progressive decline in physiological function that occurs with ageing, which 
causes functional limitations (e.g. reduced mobility) and increases the risk of 
chronic diseases, disability and mortality. Current efforts to increase 
healthspan centre on slowing the fundamental biological processes of ageing such 
as inflammation/oxidative stress, increased senescence, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, impaired proteostasis and reduced stress resistance. We propose 
that optimization of physiological function throughout the lifespan should be a 
major emphasis of any contemporary biomedical policy addressing global ageing. 
Effective strategies should delay, reduce in magnitude or abolish reductions in 
function with ageing (primary prevention) and/or improve function or slow 
further declines in older adults with already impaired function (secondary 
prevention). Healthy lifestyle practices featuring regular physical activity and 
ideal energy intake/diet composition represent first-line function-preserving 
strategies, with pharmacological agents, including existing and new 
pharmaceuticals and novel 'nutraceutical' compounds, serving as potential 
complementary approaches. Future research efforts should focus on defining the 
temporal patterns of functional declines with ageing, identifying the underlying 
mechanisms and modulatory factors involved, and establishing the most effective 
lifestyle practices and pharmacological options for maintaining function. 
Continuing development of effective behavioural approaches for enhancing 
adherence to healthy ageing practices in diverse populations, and ongoing 
analysis of the socio-economic costs and benefits of healthspan extension will 
be important supporting goals. To meet the demands created by rapid population 
ageing, a new emphasis in physiological geroscience is needed, which will 
require the collaborative, interdisciplinary efforts of investigators working 
throughout the translational research continuum from basic science to public 
health.

AIM: Examine metrics and policies regarding nurse workforce across four 
countries.
BACKGROUND: International comparisons inform health policy makers.
METHODS: Data from the OECD were used to compare expenditure, workforce and 
health in: Australia, Portugal, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States 
(US). Workforce policy context was explored.
RESULTS: Public spending varied from less than 50% of gross domestic product in 
the US to over 80% in the UK. Australia had the highest life expectancy. 
Portugal has fewer nurses and more physicians. The Australian national health 
workforce planning agency has increased the scope for co-ordinated policy 
intervention. Portugal risks losing nurses through migration. In the UK, the 
economic crisis resulted in frozen pay, reduced employment, and reduced student 
nurses. In the US, there has been limited scope to develop a significant 
national nursing workforce policy approach, with a continuation of State based 
regulation adding to the complexity of the policy landscape. The US is the most 
developed in the use of nurses in advanced practice roles. Ageing of the 
workforce is likely to drive projected shortages in all countries.
LIMITATIONS: There are differences as well as variation in the overall impact of 
the global financial crisis in these countries.
CONCLUSION: Future supply of nurses in all four countries is vulnerable.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Work force planning is absent or 
restricted in three of the countries. Scope for improved productivity through 
use of advanced nurse roles exists in all countries.

BACKGROUND: Proton therapy in pediatrics may improve the risk/benefit profile of 
radiotherapy at a greater upfront financial cost, but it may prove to be cost 
effective if chronic medical complications can be avoided. Tools to assist with 
decision making are needed to aid in selecting pediatric patients for protons, 
and cost-effectiveness models can provide an objective method for this.
METHODS: A Markov cohort-simulation model was developed to assess the expected 
costs and effectiveness for specific radiation doses to the hypothalamus with 
protons versus photons in pediatric patients. Costing data included cost of 
investment and the diagnosis and management of growth hormone deficiency. 
Longitudinal outcomes data were used to inform risk parameters for the model. 
With costs in 2012 US dollars and effectiveness measured in quality-adjusted 
life years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were used to measure outcomes.
RESULTS: Proton therapy was cost effective for some scenarios based on the 
difference in hypothalamic sparing. Although some scenarios were not cost 
effective, others were not only cost effective for proton therapy but also 
demonstrated that protons were cost saving compared with photons.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results provide the first evidence-based guide for 
identifying children with brain tumors who may benefit the most from proton 
therapy with respect to endocrine dysfunction. Proton therapy may be more cost 
effective for scenarios in which radiation dose to the hypothalamus can be 
spared, but protons may not be cost effective when tumors are involving or 
directly adjacent to the hypothalamus if there is a high dose to this structure.

University: 700 Beon-gil, 140 Baegyang-daero, Sasang-gu, Busan 617-736, Republic 
of Korea.

[Purpose] This study was performed to examine the immediate effects of spinal 
mobilization with arm movements (SMWAMs) for strengthening the shoulder muscles. 
[Subjects] The subjects of this study were 12 healthy male students who were 
studying at S University, Busan City. They had no musculoskeletal disease, or 
upper congenital malformation, and had no history of surgery or neurological 
disease. [Methods] The SMWAMs were performed on the 4th cervical vertebra (C4). 
For stimulation of the 5th cervical nerve, the spinous process of the C4 was 
pushed to the left and held in place. Then the arm was abducted to the point 
where spinous process was felt, and the range of abduction was examined. 
Subsequently, the abduction movement was repeated 10 times to the same point, 
and the gliding of C4 was held until the arm returned to the starting position. 
During the treatment, the head and the trunk were held in the correct posture. 
[Results] After SMWAMs had been performed, the muscular strength of shoulder 
flexion, extension and adduction significantly increased. [Conclusion] In our 
opinion, the SMWAMs are a very useful method for correcting spinal malalignment, 
and for stimulating the joint mechanoreceptors without the risks of 
manipulation. SMWAM is a valuable therapy method that can complement the 
demerits of mobilization.

[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to verify the effects of the long-term 
care prevention project and develop an effective program. [Subjects] A total of 
81 elderly people (age, 79 ± 5.1 years; height, 149.2 ± 9.2 cm; weight, 54.2 ± 
11.4 kg). [Methods] Grip, knee extension muscular strength, 10 m walking speed, 
and Timed Up and Go time were measured for evaluation of motor functions, and 
the "Locomo 25", a 25-question risk assessment questionnaire, was used as the 
judgment criterion for evaluation of daily life activities, with measurements 
being taken at the beginning of the project and after three months. [Results] In 
the motor functions evaluation, significant differences were observed in 10 m 
walking speed, Timed Up and Go time, and knee extension strength. In the daily 
life activities evaluation, scores for pain, rising movement, standing movement, 
indoor walking, outdoor walking, and fear of falling were significantly reduced. 
In addition, a significant correlation was also observed between motor functions 
and daily life activities. [Conclusion] The result of this study indicated that 
the long-term care prevention project is effective in maintaining or improving 
muscular strength and mitigating pain in the elderly and that it is an effective 
program for maintaining daily life activities. We were also able to show that it 
would be effective to develop programs with a low exercise intensity that can be 
performed on a continuing by the elderly.
