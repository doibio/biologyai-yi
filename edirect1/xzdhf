BACKGROUND: Although much is known about the rapidly spreading COVID-19 disease, 
a lot of knowledge is still evolving. The knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) 
of healthcare workers (HCWs) towards COVID-19 remain key in protecting 
themselves and in fighting the "war" against the disease. This study assessed 
the KAP of HCWs in Kano, northern Nigeria.
METHODOLOGY: A cross-section of different cadre of healthcare workers was 
recruited online via google forms. Using a link, the participants completed an 
adapted from a similar study, pre-tested questionnaire on KAP regarding 
COVID-19. Predictors of KAP were assessed using logistic regression modelling.
RESULTS: Among the 651 HCWs invited to participate, 233 respondents responded 
giving a response rate of 35.8%. Of these, 195 (83.7%) had good knowledge, 183 
(78.9%) had a positive attitude and 180 (77.6%) had good practice towards 
prevention of COVID-19. The odds of having good knowledge were significantly 
lower among Community Health Officers/Community Health Extension workers 
(aOR=0.2, 95% CI: 0.1-0.6;p<0.001) and other health workers compared to doctors. 
Positive attitude was predicted by good knowledge (aOR=4.8, 95% 
CI:1.7-010.2;p=0.003), being in the fifth decade of life (aOR=5.5, 95% CI: 
1.1-29.3, p=0.04), female gender (aOR=3.0, 95% CI: 1.1-8.3;p=0.04), Christian 
faith (aOR=7.0, 95% CI: 1.3-40.4; p=0.03), and having a bachelors' or medical 
degree (aOR=4.6, 95% CI: 1.3-16.5).The only predictor of good practice was good 
knowledge on COVID-19 (aOR=7.8, 95% CI 2.8-12.4;p<0.001).
CONCLUSION AND GLOBAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: Majority of the HCWs at the study 
site have good knowledge, attitude and practice regarding COVID-19. Continuous 
dissemination of information on prevention of spread of COVID-19 to all HCWs 
will strengthen the health workforce in the fight against it.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease with a limited life expectancy of 
five years from diagnosis. Uncontrolled disease or infections are the main 
causes of mortality. Daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody against CD38, is 
approved to treat patients with MM. Its target, CD38, is expressed not only on 
MM cells but also on common lymphoid precursors and subsets of normal 
lymphocytes. Daratumumab-induced lymphopenia is common, but its clinical 
significance is understudied. In this study, we report the baseline 
characteristics, rates of severe lymphopenia, infections, and clinical 
trajectory of multiple myeloma patients (n = 100) treated with daratumumab-based 
regimens at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. We discover 
high rates of infections, hospital utilization, and severe lymphopenia and 
identify risks factors for severe lymphopenia, such as low pretreatment absolute 
lymphocyte count (ALC) values. Severe lymphopenia persists in 23% of patients, 
resulting in worst survival outcomes. Our data underline the importance of 
monitoring ALC and consider future use of prophylactic measures or alternative 
regimens in subsets of MM patients.

The brown alga Ectocarpus has a haploid-diploid life cycle that involves 
alternation between two multicellular generations, the sporophyte and the 
gametophyte. Life cycle generation is not determined by ploidy but by a genetic 
system that includes two different three amino acid loop extension homeodomain 
transcription factors called OUROBOROS and SAMSARA. In addition, sporophytes 
have been shown to secrete a diffusible factor into the medium that can induce 
gametophyte initial cells to switch from the gametophyte to the sporophyte 
developmental program. The protocol presented here describes how to produce 
sporophyte-conditioned medium containing the diffusible sporophyte-inducing 
factor and how to assay for activity of the factor using a meio-spore-based 
bioassay. The protocol, which describes how several steps of these procedures 
can be optimised, will represent a useful tool for future work aimed at 
characterising the diffusible factor and investigating its mode of action.

Zanthoxylum piasezkii Maxim. is a widely distributed species of edible medicinal 
plant in China. It has been used for traditional spicy condiment and medicinal 
ingredients for quite a long time. In this study, the complete chloroplast 
genome sequence of Z. piasezkii was first reported and characterized from 
sequencing data. The complete chloroplast genome was determined to be 158,728 bp 
in length, consisting of a large single-copy (LSC) region (85,918 bp) and a 
small single copy (SSC) region (17,612 bp), which were separated by a pair of 
27,599 bp inverted repeat (IR) regions. The chloroplast genome is predicted to 
contain 132 genes, including 87 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA 
genes. The overall GC content of cpDNA is 38.4%. The phylogenetic analysis of 12 
complete chloroplast genomes reveals that Z. piasezkii is mostly related to the 
congeneric Z. bungeanum.

This study assessed pesticide usage practices, knowledge and health effects of 
pesticides through occupational exposure in randomly selected horticultural 
farmers in Imenti North, Imenti South and Buuri Sub-counties in Meru, Kenya, 
where horticultural crops are grown intensively for export and local 
consumption. The study was done through use of questionnaire distributed to 
farmers' households, agricultural extension workers and health care workers. The 
survey established that various classes of pesticides were used in horticultural 
crop farming and animal production in all the three sub-counties, with the most 
frequently used (>60 respondents out of 173) being parathion, diazinon, 
dimethoate, permethrin, pirimiphos methyl, endrin, deltamethrin, dieldrin, 
propoxur and endosulfan. It was found that there is a gap between the existing 
government regulations on pesticide use and safe handling and the implementation 
of these regulations by dealers, farmers and farm workers in the three 
sub-counties as some of the pesticides that were being used such as parathion, 
endrin, dieldrin and carbofuran had been banned by the government. Although most 
farmers had general information on pesticide usage through various social groups 
and contact with agricultural extension workers, only 32-43 % of the farmers had 
received training on pesticide handling and use. Most farmers (65%) had 
knowledge of safe pesticide handling procedures including reading labels on 
packages and wearing protective clothing; but many farmers (44% in Buuri, 57% in 
Imenti South and 60% in Imenti North) did not wear the requisite protective 
clothing when applying pesticides. The agricultural extension workers (52%) and 
health care workers (59%) were trained in their work and had at least a 
certificate level qualification from a tertiary institution. Most agricultural 
extension workers (95%) and health care workers (71%) had experience of dealing 
with pesticides and knew how to administer 1st AID against pesticide poisoning, 
respectively. Farmers (26%) reported experiencing health effects after using 
pesticides, with most effects being felt after using dimethoate, malathion, 
carbofuran, carbaryl and heptachlor. There was a statistically significant (p < 
0.05) association between various factors (availability of protective clothing, 
hiring of labourers, farm land size, expenditure on pesticides and expenditure 
on treatment, respectively) on intoxication from pesticide exposure.

Few diet and physical activity evidence-based interventions have been routinely 
used in community settings to achieve population health outcomes. Adapting 
interventions to fit the implementation context is important to achieve the 
desired results. Harvest for Health is a home-based vegetable gardening 
intervention that pairs cancer survivors with certified Master Gardeners from 
the Cooperative Extension Service with the ultimate goal of increasing vegetable 
consumption and physical activity, and improving physical functioning and 
health-related quality-of-life. Harvest for Health has potential for widespread 
dissemination since Master Gardener Programs exist throughout the United States. 
However, state- and population-specific adaptations may be needed to improve 
intervention adoption by other Master Gardener Programs. Our primary objective 
was to adapt this evidence-informed intervention that was initially incepted in 
Alabama, for the drastically different climate and growing conditions of New 
Mexico using a recommended adaptation framework. Our secondary objective was to 
develop a study protocol to support a pilot test of the adapted intervention, 
Southwest Harvest for Health. The adaptation phase is a critical first step 
towards widespread dissemination, implementation, and scale-out of an 
evidence-based intervention. This paper describes the adaptation process and 
outcomes, and the resulting protocol for the ongoing pilot study that is 
currently following 30 cancer survivors and their paired Extension Master 
Gardener mentors.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, resources in intensive 
care units (ICUs) have the potential to be inadequate to treat all those who 
might benefit. Therefore, it is paramount to identify the views of the community 
regarding how to allocate such resources. This study aims to quantify Australian 
community preferences for ventilation allocation.
METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was designed and administrated to an adult 
Australian online panel. Each survey respondent answered 12 choice sets from a 
total design of 120. Each choice set placed the respondent in the role of 
hypothetical decision maker, prioritising care between two patients. Conditional 
logit, mixed logit regression and latent class analysis were used to analyse the 
data. Additionally, we asked a series of attitudinal questions about different 
methods of making such decisions in practice, focusing on who should be 
responsible.
RESULTS: A total of 1050 community members completed the survey and responded to 
each choice. Dimensions considered most important were age, likely 
effectiveness, smoking status, whether the person has dependents, whether they 
are a healthcare worker, and whether they have a disability or not. Estimating 
marginal rates of substitution between patient characteristics and chance of 
survival if ventilated yielded values of up to 30 percentage points if the 
patient was 70 years old relative to being 30. However, respondents typically 
said they would prefer such decisions to be made by medical professionals.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the preferences of the community to 
allocation of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of such 
information should be treated with some caution as the underlying reason for 
such preferences are unclear, and respondents themselves preferred the decision 
to be made by others.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening, multiorgan disease, 
the treatment of which has seen significant increases in the life expectancy of 
those with CF. Many advances in CF care are thanks to the dedicated and active 
participation of people with CF as research participants. Unfortunately, most CF 
research teams still do not fully partner with people with CF or their 
caregivers.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the interest, knowledge gaps, 
and desired format for patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) training in the 
CF community.
METHODS: We surveyed patients, caregivers, researchers, research staff, and 
diverse health care providers via list servers and social media outreach about 
their knowledge of, experience with, and preferences for PCOR training 
components. We followed the survey with 3 small-group discussion sessions with 
22 participants who completed the survey to establish consensus and prioritize 
key learning components of a PCOR training program. We summarized results using 
descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: A total of 170 participants completed the survey (patients/caregivers: 
96/170, 56.5%; researchers/health care providers: 74/170, 43.5%). Among 
providers, 26% (19/74) were physicians/advanced practice providers, 20% (15/74) 
were nurses, and 54% (40/74) were from other disciplines. Among all 
participants, 86.5% (147/170) expressed interest in learning about PCOR, 
although training topics and training format differed between the 
patient/caregiver and researcher/health care provider groups. Before 
participating in PCOR, patients/caregivers wanted to understand more about 
expectations of them as partners on PCOR research teams (82/96, 85%). Meanwhile, 
researchers/health care providers desired information on how to include outcomes 
important to patients/caregivers (55/74, 74%) and the quality and impact of PCOR 
research (52/74, 70% and 51/74, 69%, respectively). Patients/caregivers were 
most interested in learning about the time commitment as a PCOR team member 
(75/96, 78%). Researchers/health care providers wanted to receive training about 
how to establish trust (47/74, 64%) and maintain confidentiality (47/74, 64%) 
when including patient or caregiver partners on the PCOR team. During follow-up 
discussions, participants emphasized the importance of addressing the 
traditional patient/caregiver and researchers/health care provider hierarchy by 
teaching about transparency, appreciation, creating a common language between 
the groups, and providing specific training on "how" to do PCOR.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest CF community members are interested in PCOR. A 
high-quality training program would fill a current deficit in methodological 
research. This assessment identified the topics and formats desired and can be 
used to develop targeted training to enhance meaningful PCOR in CF.

Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a life-threatening condition requiring life-long 
glucocorticoid (GC) substitution therapy, as well as stress adaptation to 
prevent adrenal crises. The number of individuals with primary and secondary 
adrenal insufficiency in Europe is estimated to be 20-50/100.000. A growing 
number of AI cases are due to side effects of GC treatment used in different 
treatment strategies for cancer and to immunotherapy in cancer treatment. The 
benefit of hormone replacement therapy is evident but long-term adverse effects 
may arise due to the non-physiological GC doses and treatment regimens used. 
Given multiple GC replacement formulations available comprising short-acting, 
intermediate, long-acting and novel modified-release hydrocortisone as well as 
subcutaneous formulations, this review offers a concise summary on the latest 
therapeutic improvements for treatment of AI and prevention of adrenal crises. 
As availability of various glucocorticoid formulations and access to expert 
centers across Europe varies widely, European Reference Networks on rare 
endocrine conditions aim at harmonizing treatment and ensure access to 
specialized patient care for individual case-by-case treatment decisions. To 
improve the availability across Europe to cost effective oral and parenteral 
formulations of hydrocortisone will save lives.

Republic.

BACKGROUND: Cuba's life expectancy at 79 is third highest in Latin America. Many 
attribute this to social investments in health and education, but comparative 
research is sparse, thus we compare Cuba with neighboring Dominican Republic, 
Costa Rica due to its strong social protections, and the U.S. Given high 
cardiovascular mortality, we focus on cardiovascular risk factor levels. To 
assess the role of health care, we distinguish medically amenable biomarkers 
from behavioral risk factors. To assess the role of Cuba's focus on equity, we 
compare education gradients in risk factors.
METHODS: We analyze Cuban data from the 10/66 Dementia Research Group baseline 
survey of urban adults ages 65 plus. Comparison samples are drawn from the 
Dominican Republic 10/66 survey, the Costa Rican CRELES, and U.S. NHANES. We 
analyze cross-country levels and education gradients of medically amenable 
(hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, access to health care) and 
behavioral (smoking, obesity) risk factors,-using sex-stratified weighted means 
comparisons and age-adjusted logistic regression.
RESULTS: Neither medically amenable nor behavioral risk factors are uniformly 
better in Cuba than comparison countries. Obesity is lower in Cuba, but male 
smoking is higher. Hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia levels are 
high in all countries, though Cuba's are lower than Costa Rica. Hypertension 
awareness in Cuba is similar to Costa Rica. Cuba has a higher proportion of 
hypertensives on treatment than Costa Rica, though lower than the U.S. 
Comparative gradients by education are similarly mixed. For behavioral factors, 
Cuba shows the strongest gradients (primarily for men) among the countries 
compared: smoking improves, but obesity worsens with education. Hypertension 
awareness also improves with education in Cuba, but Cuba shows no significant 
differences by education in hypertension treatment.
CONCLUSION: Smoking is comparatively high in Cuba, but obesity is low, and the 
resulting biomarkers show comparatively mixed patterns. Cuba's social 
protections have not eliminated strong educational gradients in behavioral risk 
factors, but the healthcare system appears to have eliminated disparities such 
as in hypertension treatment.

BACKGROUND: Common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID), the most common 
form of primary antibody deficiency, are rare conditions associated with 
considerable morbidity and mortality. The clinical benefit of immunoglobulin 
replacement therapy (IgGRT) is substantial: timely treatment with appropriate 
doses significantly reduces mortality and the incidence of CVID-complications 
such as major infections and bronchiectasis. Unfortunately, CVID-patients still 
face a median diagnostic delay of 4 years. Their disease burden, expressed in 
annual loss of disability-adjusted life years, is 3-fold higher than in the 
general population. Hurdles to treatment access and reimbursement by healthcare 
payers may exist because the value of IgGRT is poorly documented. This paper 
aims to demonstrate cost-effectiveness and cost-utility (on life expectancy and 
quality) of IgGRT in CVID.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: With input from a literature search, we built a 
health-economic model for cost-effectiveness and cost-utility assessment of 
IgGRT in CVID. We compared a mean literature-based dose (≥450mg/kg/4wks) to a 
zero-or-low dose (0 to ≤100 mg/kg/4wks) in a simulated cohort of adult patients 
from time of diagnosis until death; we also estimated the economic impact of 
diagnostic delay in this simulated cohort. Compared to no or minimal treatment, 
IgGRT showed an incremental benefit of 17 life-years (LYs) and 11 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €29,296/LY and €46,717/QALY. These results 
were robust in a sensitivity analysis. Reducing diagnostic delay by 4 years 
provided an incremental benefit of six LYs and four QALYs compared to simulated 
patients with delayed IgGRT initiation, resulting in an ICER of €30,374/LY and 
€47,495/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The health-economic model suggests that early initiation of IgGRT 
compared to no or delayed IgGRT is highly cost-effective. CVID-patients' access 
to IgGRT should be facilitated, not only because of proven clinical efficacy, 
but also due to the now demonstrated cost-effectiveness.

Invertebrates in general have long been underrepresented in studies on 
biodiversity, biogeography and conservation. Boundaries of biodiversity hotspots 
are often delimited intuitively based on floristic endemism and have seldom been 
empirically tested using actual species distributions, and especially 
invertebrates. Here we analyse the zoogeography of terrestrial malacofauna from 
south-eastern Africa (SEA), proposing the first mollusc-based numerical 
regionalisation for the area. We also discuss patterns and centres of land snail 
endemism, thence assessing the importance and the delimitation of the 
Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany (MPA) biodiversity hotspot for their conservation. 
An incidence matrix compiled for relatively well-collected lineages of land 
snails and slugs (73 taxa in twelve genera) in 40 a priori operational 
geographic units was subjected to (a) phenetic agglomerative hierarchical 
clustering using unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA), (b) 
parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) and biotic element analysis (BEA). 
Fulfilling the primary objective of our study, the UPGMA dendrogram provided a 
hierarchical regionalisation and identified five centres of molluscan endemism 
for SEA, while the PAE confirmed six areas of endemism, also supported by the 
BEA. The regionalisation recovers a zoogeographic province similar to the MPA 
hotspot, but with a conspicuous westward extension into Knysna (towards the 
Cape). The MPA province, centres and areas of endemism, biotic elements as well 
as the spatial patterns of species richness and endemism, support the MPA 
hotspot, but suggest further extensions resulting in a greater MPA region of 
land snail endemism (also with a northward extension into sky 
islands-Soutpansberg and Wolkberg), similar to that noted for vertebrates. The 
greater MPA region provides a more robustly defined region of conservation 
concern, with centres of endemism serving as local conservation priorities.

The world is facing the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which began in China. 
By August 18, 2020, the United States, Brazil, and India were the most affected 
countries. Health infrastructure and socioeconomic vulnerabilities may be 
affecting the response capacities of these countries. We compared official 
indicators to identify which vulnerabilities better determined the exposure risk 
to COVID-19 in both the most and least affected countries. To achieve this 
purpose, we collected indicators from the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index 
(IDVI), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, and the Brazilian 
Geography and Statistics Institute (IBGE). All indicators were normalized to 
facilitate comparisons. Speed, incidence, and population were used to identify 
the groups of countries with the highest and lowest risks of infection. 
Countries' response capacities were determined based on socioeconomic, 
political, and health infrastructure conditions. Vulnerabilities were identified 
based on the indicator sensitivity. The highest-risk group included the U.S., 
Brazil, and India, whereas the lowest-risk group (with the largest population by 
continent) consisted of China, New Zealand, and Germany. The high-sensitivity 
cluster had 18 indicators (50% extra IDVI), such as merchandise trade, 
immunization, public services, maternal mortality, life expectancy at birth, 
hospital beds, GINI index, adolescent fertility, governance, political 
stability, transparency/corruption, industry, and water supply. The greatest 
vulnerability of the highest-risk group was related first to economic factors 
(merchandise trade), followed by public health (immunization), highlighting 
global dependence on Chinese trade, such as protective materials, equipment, and 
diagnostic tests. However, domestic political factors had more indicators, 
beginning with high sensitivity and followed by healthcare and economic 
conditions, which signified a lesser capacity to guide, coordinate, and supply 
the population with protective measures, such as social distancing.

Multimorbidity, Consumer- Directed Care, and Drug-Related Harm.

People from developed countries around the world now routinely live into their 
80s and beyond, and this is associated with a range of medical and societal 
challenges that must be addressed. It is relatively rare to encounter older 
people who are not affected by one or more chronic diseases, including 
conditions such as osteoarthritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 
hypertension, and depression. The concurrence of a number of medical and/or 
psychiatric conditions in the same patient has come to be referred to as 
multimorbidity, and it is a particularly familiar phenomenon observed by health 
care providers in settings such as the Emergency Department (ED), primary care 
practice, and long-term care facilities. Given that life expectancy continues to 
increase, and that there is considerable further investment in research for the 
development of new treatments, which will achieve adoption and be promoted to 
consumers, it is clear that multimorbidity is likely to be a driver for problems 
arising from medications that are vigorously promoted to consumers.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is a life-threatening condition and also one of the biggest 
challenges facing human health and the medical community. This meta-analysis was 
to investigate the effects of music intervention on physiological and 
psychological responses of patients with cancer.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The following electronic databases will be searched from 
inception to December 2020: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical 
Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, Chinese 
Science and the Wanfang Database. We only included music intervention vs placebo 
in cancer patients and pooled results were summarized by STATA 12.0 software. 
Two investigators independently selected the studies according to the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed the quality of the 
selected studies. The existence of statistical heterogeneity would be evaluated 
by Chi2 test and its extension by the I2 test (I2 > 50% indicates high 
heterogeneity among studies). Publication bias was ruled out by funnel plot and 
statistically assessed by Begg test (P > .05 as no publication bias).
RESULTS: The study results will be published in relevant peer-reviewed journals 
and key findings will be presented at international scientific meetings.
CONCLUSION: Our study aims to systematically assess the effects of music 
intervention in cancer patients, which will be provide clinical guidance for 
cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: The burden of post-stroke cognitive impairment, as well as affective 
disorders, remains persistently high. With improved stroke survival rates and 
increasing life expectancy, there is a need for effective interventions to 
facilitate remediation of neurocognitive impairments and post-stroke mood 
disorders.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Therapeutic Instrumental Music 
Performance (TIMP) training with and without Motor Imagery on cognitive 
functioning and affective responding in chronic post-stroke individuals.
METHODS: Thirty chronic post-stroke, community-dwelling participants were 
randomized to one of three experimental arms: (1) 45 minutes of active TIMP, (2) 
30 minutes of active TIMP followed by 15 minutes of metronome-cued motor imagery 
(TIMP+cMI), (3) 30 minutes of active TIMP followed by 15 minutes of motor 
imagery without cues (TIMP+MI). Training took place three times a week for three 
weeks, using a selection of acoustic and electronic instruments. Assessments, 
administered at two baselines and post-training, included the Trail Making Test 
(TMT) - Part B to assess mental flexibility, the Digit Span Test (DST) to 
determine short-term memory capacity, the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist - 
Revised (MAACL-R) to ascertain current affective state, and the General 
Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) to assess perceived self-efficacy. The Self-Assessment 
Maniqin (SAM) was also administered prior to and following each training 
session.
RESULTS: Thirty participants completed the protocol, ten per arm [14 women; mean 
age = 55.9; mean time post-stroke = 66.9 months]. There were no statistically 
significant differences between pooled group baseline measures. The TIMP+MI 
group showed a statistically significant decrease in time from pre-test 2 to 
post-test on the TMT. The TIMP group showed a significant increase on MAACL 
sensation seeking scores, as well as on the Valence and Dominance portions of 
the SAM; TIMP+cMI showed respective increases and decreases in positive and 
negative affect on the MAACL, and increases on the Valence, Dominance, and 
Arousal portions of the SAM. No statistically significant association between 
cognitive and affective measures was obtained.
CONCLUSIONS: The mental flexibility aspect of executive functioning appears to 
be enhanced by therapeutic instrumental music training in conjunction with motor 
imagery, possibly due to multisensory integration and consolidation of 
representations through motor imagery rehearsal following active practice. 
Active training using musical instruments appears to have a positive impact on 
affective responding; however, these changes occurred independently of 
improvements to cognition.

In 2016, undernutrition, as manifested in childhood stunting, wasting, and 
underweight were estimated to cause over 1.0 million deaths, 3.9% of years of 
life lost, and 3.8% of disability-adjusted life years globally. The objective of 
this study is to estimate the prevalence of undernutrition in low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs) using the 2006-2018 cross-sectional nationally 
representative demographic and health surveys (DHS) data and to explore the 
sources of regional variations. Anthropometric measurements of children 
0-59 months of age from DHS in 62 LMICs worldwide were used. Complete 
information was available for height-for-age (n = 624,734), weight-for-height 
(n = 625,230) and weight-for-age (n = 626,130). Random-effects models were fit 
to estimate the pooled prevalence of stunting, wasting, and underweight. Sources 
of heterogeneity in the prevalence estimates were explored through subgroup 
meta-analyses and meta-regression using generalized linear mixed-effects models. 
Human development index (a country-specific composite index based on life 
expectancy, literacy, access to education and per capita gross domestic product) 
and the United Nations region were explored as potential sources of variation in 
undernutrition. The overall prevalence was 29.1% (95% CI 26.7%, 31.6%) for 
stunting, 6.3% (95% CI 4.6%, 8.2%) for wasting, and 13.7% (95% CI 10.9%, 16.9%) 
for underweight. Subgroup analyses suggested that Western Africa, Southern Asia, 
and Southeastern Asia had a substantially higher estimated prevalence of 
undernutrition than global average estimates. In multivariable meta-regression, 
a combination of human development index and United Nations region (a proxy for 
geographical variation) explained 54%, 56%, and 66% of the variation in 
stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence, respectively. Our findings 
demonstrate that regional, subregional, and country disparities in 
undernutrition remain, and the residual gaps to close towards achieving the 
second sustainable development goal-ending undernutrition by 2030.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has rapidly become the most common cause of 
chronic liver diseases. We aimed to explore the incidence and distribution 
characteristics of NASH by sex, region and sociodemographic index (SDI). We 
collected data, including sex and region, on NASH-related liver cirrhosis from 
the 2017 GBD study. The age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) and estimated 
annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were used to estimate the incidence trend and 
distribution characteristics. Globally, the incidence of liver cirrhosis caused 
by NASH increased from 178,430 cases in 1990 to 367,780 cases in 2017, an 
increase of approximately 105.56%. The ASR of NASH increased by an average of 
1.35% per year (95% CI 1.28-1.42). Meanwhile, large differences in the ASR and 
the EAPC were observed across regions. The middle-high SDI region had the 
highest increase among all five SDI regions, followed by middle SDI region. In 
addition, Eastern Europe, Andean Latin America and Central Asia showed a more 
significant growth trend of ASR. In contrast, the high SDI region demonstrated 
the slowest increasing trend of ASR, and the high-income Asia Pacific 
demonstrated a decreasing trend among the 21 regions. Liver cirrhosis has caused 
a huge and rising health burden in many countries and regions. In addition, with 
the growth of obesity, population and aging, NASH might replace viral hepatitis 
as the most important cause of liver cirrhosis in the near future. Therefore, 
appropriate interventions are needed in coming decades to realize early 
diagnosis and prevention of NASH-related liver cirrhosis.
