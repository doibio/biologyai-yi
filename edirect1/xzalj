AIM: The aim of this discursive paper is to introduce allostasis and allostatic 
load, which are relatively new concepts proposed to explain physiological 
responses to stress, and to suggest ways in which allostasis theory can be 
applied to the development of clinical interventions to increase resilience for 
producing better health outcome.
BACKGROUND: Common explanations of stress have failed adequately to explicate 
its association with health and chronic illness. Allostasis is the extension of 
the concept of homeostasis and represents the adaptation process of the complex 
physiological system to physical, psychosocial and environmental challenges or 
stress. Allostatic load is the long-term result of failed adaptation or 
allostasis, resulting in pathology and chronic illness.
DISCUSSION: The concepts of allostasis and allostatic load introduced the idea 
that external challenges initiate allostasis and chronic stress causes 
allostatic load that can be measured with multiple biomarkers. Finding from 
several studies suggests that higher allostatic load is associated with worse 
health outcomes. Resilience represents successful allostasis and strategies can 
be implemented to enhance resilience and thereby improve health outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This theoretical model provides a comprehensive explanation of the 
human body's adaptation processes in response to stress and the results of 
failed adaptation over time. In addition, combining the concepts of allostasis 
and resilience may help us to understand and implement clinical strategies 
better to reduce or prevent the debilitating physiological and psychological 
effects of chronic stress and chronic illness.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Clinical practice should be based on a solid 
theoretical foundation to improve health outcomes. Strategies to manage stress 
and increase resilience along with clinical interventions to manage the 
physiological responses to chronic stress are necessary to assist in preventing 
and controlling the detrimental effects of chronic disease on human life.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore patients' responses to developing and managing 
cystic fibrosis-related diabetes and to contrast their views with those of 
individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
BACKGROUND: The incidence of diabetes among people with cystic fibrosis has 
increased with improvement in life expectancy. However, little is known about 
how patients respond to and manage cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, and how 
this compares with people living with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
DESIGN: Qualitative research was undertaken in order to fully explore meanings 
and views.
METHODS: Semi-structured telephone or face-to-face interviews were conducted 
with patients who had cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or type 1 diabetes 
mellitus, during which, they discussed diagnosis and management of diabetes. 
Framework analysis was employed to identify themes and to consider similarities 
and differences between the two groups.
RESULTS: Eleven cystic fibrosis-related diabetes and 12 type 1 diabetes mellitus 
patients were interviewed in 2006. Patients with cystic fibrosis-related 
diabetes described their diabetes diagnosis as a progression of their primary 
illness, management of which was important owing to the benefits it brought to 
their cystic fibrosis. Those with type 1 diabetes mellitus were more likely to 
report feeling psychologically low because of diabetes and to list long-term 
complications as a key factor motivating self-management. Both groups struggled 
to balance the demands of diabetes with other life and health obligations, and 
experienced isolation because of diabetes. Conclusions. Variation in perceptions 
recalled during interviews stemmed from diabetes being part of an existing 
life-threatening chronic illness in people with cystic fibrosis-related 
diabetes. Similarities and differences in attitudes and management practices 
were found, with less urgency regarding glucose monitoring and fewer information 
resources available for those with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Both groups need support for optimal diabetes 
management and access to appropriate resources outside specialist clinics. 
Web-based technologies could prove useful for those with cystic fibrosis-related 
diabetes as face-to-face interaction may be prevented owing to the risk of 
cross-infection.

OBJECTIVE: The 2000 Census in China registered 55 groups of Indigenous 
population, including 104.49 million people, making up 8.1% of China's total 
population. Yunnan Province, located in Southwest China, is the only province 
where all 55 Indigenous nationalities are represented (14.15 million), making up 
33.4% of Yunnan's total population. This study aimed to examine trends in infant 
and child mortality and life expectancy at birth of the 22 largest Indigenous 
nationalities and compared these trends with those of the majority Han Chinese 
in Yunnan and China as a whole.
METHODS: Data sources of mortality and socioeconomic status came from the 
population censuses of China (1953, 1964, 1982, 1990, and 2000) and Yunnan 
(1990-2000) and from the Provincial Health Department (1990, 1995, 1996 and 
2000). Weighted linear regression analysis was used to examine the associations 
between infant/child mortality and life expectancy at birth, socioeconomic 
indicators and the use of preventive health services.
RESULTS: In 2000, the infant mortality rate was 26.90 for China and 53.64 for 
Han Chinese in Yunnan per 1,000 live birth versus 77.75 for the 22 largest 
minority nationalities in Yunnan, despite improvements in health status 
indicators since 1990. The inequalities in life expectancy at birth between 
China as a whole and some minority nationalities remained striking in 2000 
(57.18 versus 71.40). Literacy, prenatal examination, hospital deliveries, 
economic development were important predictors of these health indicators.
IMPLICATIONS: Efforts to continue to improve these intermediate proximate 
determinants and to target the most disadvantaged Indigenous groups are likely 
to further reduce health disparities between the Chinese and Indigenous 
populations.

The value of health.

Groot W, van den Brink HM.

BACKGROUND: A major problem in cost-effectiveness studies is where to draw the 
line between interventions which are cost-effective and those who are not. 
Lacking a notion about the value of a QALY, all ultimate values to the 
cost-effectiveness ratio are essentially arbitrary.
METHODS: This paper presents a simple empirical model to estimate the 
compensating income variation of diseases and health problems. The model is 
estimated using data for the Netherlands.
RESULTS: The compensating income variation is between euro 20,000 and euro 
90,000. This is higher than most of the ultimate values used by policy-makers to 
decide whether an intervention is cost-effective. Our figures are roughly 
similar to those found in studies about the value of a statistical life year.
CONCLUSION: Estimates on the compensating income variation of diseases and 
health problems may provide useful information on the maximum acceptable 
cost-effectiveness ratio of medical interventions than those currently used by 
policy makers.

Acromegaly.

Acromegaly is an acquired disorder related to excessive production of growth 
hormone (GH) and characterized by progressive somatic disfigurement (mainly 
involving the face and extremities) and systemic manifestations. The prevalence 
is estimated at 1:140,000-250,000. It is most often diagnosed in middle-aged 
adults (average age 40 years, men and women equally affected). Due to insidious 
onset and slow progression, acromegaly is often diagnosed four to more than ten 
years after its onset. The main clinical features are broadened extremities 
(hands and feet), widened thickened and stubby fingers, and thickened soft 
tissue. The facial aspect is characteristic and includes a widened and thickened 
nose, prominent cheekbones, forehead bulges, thick lips and marked facial lines. 
The forehead and overlying skin is thickened, sometimes leading to frontal 
bossing. There is a tendency towards mandibular overgrowth with prognathism, 
maxillary widening, tooth separation and jaw malocclusion. The disease also has 
rheumatologic, cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic consequences which 
determine its prognosis. In the majority of cases, acromegaly is related to a 
pituitary adenoma, either purely GH-secreting (60%) or mixed. In very rare 
cases, acromegaly is due to ectopic secretion of growth-hormone-releasing 
hormone (GHRH) responsible for pituitary hyperplasia. The clinical diagnosis is 
confirmed biochemically by an increased serum GH concentration following an oral 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and by detection of increased levels of 
insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Assessment of tumor volume and extension 
is based on imaging studies. Echocardiography and sleep apnea testing are used 
to determine the clinical impact of acromegaly. Treatment is aimed at correcting 
(or preventing) tumor compression by excising the disease-causing lesion, and at 
reducing GH and IGF-I levels to normal values. Transsphenoidal surgery is often 
the first-line treatment. When surgery fails to correct GH/IGF-I hypersecretion, 
medical treatment with somatostatin analogs and/or radiotherapy can be used. The 
GH antagonist (pegvisomant) is used in patients that are resistant to 
somatostatin analogs. Adequate hormonal disease control is achieved in most 
cases, allowing a life expectancy similar to that of the general population. 
However, even if patients are cured or well-controlled, sequelae (joint pain, 
deformities and altered quality of life) often remain.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative condition 
characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration and muscle paralysis. 
Genetic evidence from man and mouse has indicated that mutations in the 
dynein/dynactin motor complex are correlated with motor neuron degeneration. In 
this study, we have generated transgenic mice with neuron-specific expression of 
Bicaudal D2 N-terminus (BICD2-N) to chronically impair dynein/dynactin function. 
Motor neurons expressing BICD2-N showed accumulation of dynein and dynactin in 
the cell body, Golgi fragmentation and several signs of impaired retrograde 
trafficking: the appearance of giant neurofilament swellings in the proximal 
axon, reduced retrograde labelling by tracer injected in the muscle and delayed 
expression of the injury transcription factor ATF3 after axon transection. 
Despite these abnormalities, BICD2-N mice did not develop signs of motor neuron 
degeneration and motor abnormalities. Interestingly, the BICD2-N transgene 
increased lifespan in 'low copy' SOD1-G93A ALS transgenic mice. Our findings 
indicate that impaired dynein/dynactin function can explain several pathological 
features observed in ALS patients, but may be beneficial in some forms of ALS.

INTRODUCTION: In regard to therapy and prognosis of urological tumors, specific 
tumor markers are lacking especially in renal and urinary bladder carcinoma. Our 
study examines the relevance of serum serotonin levels to urinary bladder, 
prostate, renal, and testicular carcinoma when it comes to prognosis and 
occurrence of these oncological conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serotonin levels were obtained in 109 patients presenting 
with urothelial carcinoma to the urinary bladder, adenocarcinoma of the prostate 
and renal cell carcinoma, as well as presenting with seminomatous and 
non-seminomatous testicular tumors. All of these conditions varied in grades and 
metastases. Serum levels were drawn between 7 and 8 a.m. exclusively in order to 
avoid circadian changes.
RESULTS: Serotonin levels in urothelial carcinoma appeared within pathological 
range in correlation with tumor stage, life expectancy, and statistical 
significant with distant metastases. In prostate carcinoma, serotonin levels 
showed a tendency with organ exceeding growth, Grading/Gleason Score, PSA values 
>100 ng/ml, and the presence of distant metastases. In renal cell carcinoma, 
serotonin levels were decreased in patients with lymph node and distant 
metastases; there was no significant correlation with extent of infiltration. In 
regard to testicular carcinoma, decreased serotonin levels were merely noted in 
mixed tumors and the one extragonadal seminoma. Otherwise there was no 
correlation observed with stage and grade as well as with common tumor markers 
(AFP/betaHCG).
CONCLUSION: Serotonin levels are suitable for prognostic evaluation of 
urothelial carcinoma in the urinary bladder, adenocarcinoma of the prostate, and 
renal cell carcinoma, especially taking into account the lab cost of 25<euro> 
per test.

Economic evaluation of sacral nerve stimulation for faecal incontinence.

Dudding TC(1), Meng Lee E, Faiz O, Parés D, Vaizey CJ, McGuire A, Kamm MA.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is an established treatment for 
faecal incontinence in patients who have failed conservative management. This 
study established the cost-effectiveness of treating patients with SNS compared 
with non-surgical treatment.
METHODS: A decision analysis model was performed. Data from 70 patients were 
obtained from medical records, bowel habit diaries and Short Form 36 quality of 
life questionnaires. Direct medical and non-medical costs were ascertained using 
the 2005/2006 national tariff, national statistics, and medication, pad and 
device costs. Indirect non-medical costs were also estimated.
RESULTS: Incontinence episodes were reduced from a median of 12 per fortnight at 
baseline to one per fortnight with SNS. Based on direct medical and non-medical 
costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for SNS was pound25 070 
per QALY gained. It cost pound1038 more per year to treat patients with SNS for 
a median reduction of 286 incontinence episodes, equating to pound3.63 per 
episode reduced. When indirect non-medical costs were included the ICER was 
reduced to pound12 959 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: The ICER of pound25 070 is within the pound30 000 per QALY threshold 
recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence as an 
effective use of National Health Service resources with proper justification.

The prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) varies worldwide from 7 to 450 per 
100,000, and appears low in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) but few data exist. We 
conducted a prevalence study of PD in rural Tanzania. A door-to-door study was 
conducted in the Hai district project area (population 161,071), using a 
screening questionnaire followed by structured history and examination of 
positive responders. Diagnosis was based on the UK PD Society Brain Bank 
Criteria. 33 (23 men) cases of PD were detected, with mean age 74 years (range 
38-94). One patient died before the prevalence date. 78% were previously 
undiagnosed and untreated. Mean duration of symptoms was 5 years, and median 
Hoehn and Yahr stage 3. Crude prevalence rates were 30/100,000 (men), 11/100,000 
(women) and 20/100,000 (combined). The direct age-standardized prevalence rates 
compared with the UK population were 64/100,000 (men), 20/100,000 (women) and 
40/100,000 (combined). These rates are higher than previously reported from SSA, 
but still lower than the developed world. Many PD patients in SSA may never be 
diagnosed or treated, with consequent reduction in their life expectancy and 
quality of life. With the world population ageing PD is predicted to become an 
increasing problem.

PURPOSE: Short life expectancy influences decision-making when treating very old 
patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We investigated mortality and 
survival duration in very old AIS patients (>or= 80 years) who received hospital 
care.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mortality data were obtained from medical records, 
structured telephone inquiries, death certificates from the Korean National 
Statistical Office, and social security data 5+/-1.9 years after stroke onset. 
Age, gender, vascular risk factors, and functional outcomes from modified Rankin 
scales (MRS) at discharge were analyzed as predictors of mortality.
RESULTS: Among 134 patients, 92 (68.7%) died. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, duration 
of survival of patients aged 80-84 years was longer than those aged 85-89 or 
90-94 (24+/-6.4, 8+/-7.3, 7+/-2.0 months, respectively, p=0.002). Duration of 
survival of patients discharged in a state of MRS 0-1 was longer than the 
remaining groups at 47+/-4.8 months (p<0.001). In Cox proportional hazard 
analysis, age and MRS at discharge were independent predictors of mortality.
CONCLUSION: Long-term outcomes of very old patients with AIS are not uniformly 
grave, therefore predictors of mortality and estimated duration of survival 
should be considered during decision-making for treatment.

Requisite models for strategic commissioning: the example of type 1 diabetes.

A developing emphasis of health care reforms has been creating organisations 
with responsibilities for strategic commissioning of services for defined 
populations. Such organisations must set priorities in aiming to meet their 
populations' needs subject to a budget constraint. This requires estimates of 
the health benefits and costs of different interventions for their populations. 
This paper outlines a framework that does this and shows how this requires 
modelling to produce estimates in a way that is transparent to commissioners, of 
requisite complexity to produce sound estimates for priority setting using 
routinely available data. The example illustrated in this paper is an 
intervention that would improve glucose control in the English population with 
type 1 diabetes. It takes many years for a change in glucose management to 
deliver maximum benefits; hence the intervention is not good value-for-money in 
the short run. We aim to give a more strategic view of the costs and benefits 
modelling costs and benefits in a steady-state model which suggests that the 
intervention is good value-for-money in the long run.

Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. praggi@emory.edu

OBJECTIVES: We sought to study the prognostic utility of coronary artery calcium 
(CAC) in the elderly.
BACKGROUND: The prognostic significance of CAC in the elderly is not well known.
METHODS: All-cause mortality was assessed in 35,388 patients (3,570 were >or=70 
years old at screening, and 50% were women) after a mean follow-up of 5.8 +/- 3 
years.
RESULTS: In older patients, risk factors and CAC were more prevalent. Overall 
survival was 97.9% at the end of follow-up. Mortality increased with each age 
decile with a relative hazard of 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.08 to 1.10, p 
< 0.0001), and rates were greater for men than women (hazard ratio: 1.53; 95% 
confidence interval: 1.32 to 1.77, p < 0.0001). Increasing CAC scores were 
associated with decreasing survival across all age deciles (p < 0.0001). 
Survival for a <40-year and >or=80-year-old man with a CAC score >or=400 was 88% 
and 19% (95% and 44% for a woman, p < 0.0001), respectively. Among the 20,562 
patients with no CAC, annual mortality rates ranged from 0.3% to 2.2% for 
patients age 40 to 49 years or >or=70 years (p < 0.0001). The use of CAC allowed 
us to reclassify more than 40% of the patients >or=70 years old more often by 
excluding risk (i.e., CAC <400) in those with >3 risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite their limited life expectancy, the use of CAC discriminates 
mortality risk in the elderly. Furthermore, the use of CAC allows physicians to 
reclassify risk in the elderly.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the amount and availability of surgical care 
globally. We estimated the number of major operations undertaken worldwide, 
described their distribution, and assessed the importance of surgical care in 
global public-health policy.
METHODS: We gathered demographic, health, and economic data for 192 member 
states of WHO. Data for the rate of surgery were sought from several sources 
including governmental agencies, statistical and epidemiological organisations, 
published studies, and individuals involved in surgical policy initiatives. We 
also obtained per-head total expenditure on health from analyses done in 2004. 
Major surgery was defined as any intervention occurring in a hospital operating 
theatre involving the incision, excision, manipulation, or suturing of tissue, 
usually requiring regional or general anaesthesia or sedation. We created a 
model to estimate rates of major surgery for countries for which such data were 
unavailable, then used demographic information to calculate the total worldwide 
volume of surgery.
FINDINGS: We obtained surgical data for 56 (29%) of 192 WHO member states. We 
estimated that 234.2 (95% CI 187.2-281.2) million major surgical procedures are 
undertaken every year worldwide. Countries spending US$100 or less per head on 
health care have an estimated mean rate of major surgery of 295 (SE 53) 
procedures per 100 000 population per year, whereas those spending more than 
$1000 have a mean rate of 11 110 (SE 1300; p<0.0001). Middle-expenditure 
($401-1000) and high-expenditure (>$1000) countries, accounting for 30.2% of the 
world's population, provided 73.6% (172.3 million) of operations worldwide in 
2004, whereas poor-expenditure (</=$100) countries account for 34.8% of the 
global population yet undertook only 3.5% (8.1 million) of all surgical 
procedures in 2004.
INTERPRETATION: Worldwide volume of surgery is large. In view of the high death 
and complication rates of major surgical procedures, surgical safety should now 
be a substantial global public-health concern. The disproportionate scarcity of 
surgical access in low-income settings suggests a large unaddressed disease 
burden worldwide. Public-health efforts and surveillance in surgery should be 
established.

qualitative studies.

University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. claire.gately@manchester.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: Understanding peoples' responses to and ability to incorporate 
technology for managing long-term conditions into their everyday lives is 
relevant for informing the development and implementation of new technologies as 
part of future long-term condition management in domestic environments. Future 
research and theory building can be facilitated by the synthesis of existing 
qualitative studies.
METHODS: A systematic search for qualitative studies of health technologies at 
home was undertaken on OVID CINAHL, OVID Medline and CSA databases for the 
period 1996-2006. Studies (n = 12) that met the inclusion criteria were 
synthesized and their analyses subjected to qualitative meta-synthesis.
FINDINGS: Analyses clustered into five themes: (1) managing multiple 
uncertainties; (2) the reconstruction of identity; (3) the struggle to remain 
autonomous while allowing dependence; (4) coming to terms with living a 
technology-assisted life; and (5) the usability of devices. These translated 
into a line of argument synthesis in which technology takes on the status of a 
personified ;other' around which a set of personal and relational attributions 
are subsequently constructed. These allow the extension of existing illness work 
to incorporate new technologies.
CONCLUSIONS: Ambivalence about the value of technologies that are designed to 
assist with the management of a long-term condition reflects experiences of the 
disruptive effects of health technologies on personal identities and strategies 
of managing illness. At the same time, they are highly valued because they 
provided new opportunities to complete aspects of illness work that were 
previously impossible.

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is the most aggressive thyroid cancer 
variant, accounting for 1-2% of all cases, but 33% of deaths, and exhibiting an 
average life expectancy of 5 months. ATC is largely unresponsive to radioactive 
iodine, chemotherapy, external beam radiation or surgery, underscoring the need 
for new and effective therapies. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of an 
oncolytic adenovirus, ONYX-411, that replicates selectively in and kills cells 
with dysfunction of the retinoblastoma (RB) pathway. In the present study, we 
report that ONYX-411 is able to induce cell death in eight human anaplastic 
carcinoma cell lines in vitro. The cytopathic effect of the virus is specific to 
cells with RB dysfunction, which appears to be frequent in ATC. We confirmed the 
expression of the coxsackie adenovirus receptor, CAR, in all ATC cell lines, 
demonstrating the potentially universal application of this oncolytic viral 
therapy to ATC. In addition, the growth of xenograft tumors induced in athymic 
mice with the ARO and DRO cell lines was significantly reduced by ONYX-411 
treatment. These results indicate that ONYX-411 can be a potential therapeutic 
agent for the treatment of ATC, rendering this class of conditionally 
replicating adenoviruses an attractive candidate for clinical trials.

Detailed analysis of formation of chicken pituitary primordium in early 
embryonic development.

Science and Engineering, Saitama University, Sakuraku, Saitama, Japan.

The primordium of the mammalian adenohypophysis derived from Rathke's pouch (RP) 
is known to be formed by oral ectoderm invagination. However, in the early phase 
of pituitary development, the detailed process by which the oral ectoderm 
develops into the adenohypophysis remains largely unknown. Using high-resolution 
non-radiolabeled in situ hybridization and the BrdU and TUNEL methods, we have 
examined the detailed expression pattern of factors involved in the formation of 
RP of chicken and the changes in the mitotic and apoptotic cell regions in RP. 
In the chicken embryo, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) mRNA was initially expressed in the 
stomodeal plate but not in the oral ectoderm. After prospective diencephalon had 
detached from the oral ectoderm, another Shh-expressing region appeared in the 
most rostral part of the recess. LIM homeobox gene 3 (Lhx3) mRNA first appeared 
in the anterior area of Rathke's recess, and expression then spread to the 
caudal region. alphaGSU mRNA-expressing cells were observed at both ends of the 
Lhx3-expressing region, and thereafter the expression area moved to the 
posterior region. Furthermore, a close overlap was found between the 
proliferating region and Lhx3 mRNA-expressing area, and TUNEL-positive cells 
appeared in Seessel's pouch derived from the foregut. Thus, the primordium of 
the pituitary gland corresponding to the Lhx3-expressing region is surrounded by 
the Shh-expressing region, which appears in two steps, and the mass growth and 
invagination of RP of chicken result from the coordination of the dorsal 
extension of the anterior region and the ventral extension of the posterior 
region of RP.

The evidence of effect of overweight and obesity on mortality at middle and old 
age is conflicting. The increased relative risk of cardiovascular disease and 
diabetes for overweight and obese individuals compared to normal weight is well 
documented, but the absolute risk of cardiovascular death has decreased 
spectacularly since the 1980s. We estimate the burden of mortality of obesity 
among middle and old aged adults in the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), a US 
prospective longitudinal study. We calculate univariate and multivariate 
age-specific probabilities and proportional hazard ratios of death in relation 
to self-reported body mass index (BMI), smoking and education. The life table 
translates age specific adjusted event rates in survival times, dependent on 
risk factor distributions (smoking, levels of education and self reported BMI). 
95% confidence intervals are calculated by bootstrapping. The highest life 
expectancy at age 55 was found in overweight (BMI 25-29.9), highly educated non 
smokers: 30.7 (29.5-31.9) years (men) and 33.2 (32.1-34.3) (women), slightly 
higher than a BMI 23-24.9 in both sexes. Smoking decreased the population life 
expectancy with 3.5 (2.7-4.4) years (men) and 1.8 (1.0-2.5) years (women). Less 
than optimal education cost men and women respectively 2.8 (2.1-3.6) and 2.6 
(1.6-3.6) years. Obesity and low normal weight decreased population life 
expectancy respectively by 0.8 (0.2-1.3) and 0.8 (0.0-1.5) years for men and 
women in a contemporary, US population. The burden of mortality of obesity is 
limited, compared to smoking and low education.

Long-term cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel in STEMI patients.

Zhang Z(1), Kolm P, Mosse F, Jackson J, Zhao L, Weintraub WS.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: The COMMIT trial demonstrated that clopidogrel produced a 9% 
relative reduction in death, reinfarction or stroke (9.2% vs. 10.1%, 95% CI: 
0.86-0.97) in ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients.
METHODS: Between 08/1999 and 05/2005, 45,852 STEMI patients were randomized to 
clopidogrel (n=22,961) or matching placebo (n=22,891) in addition to aspirin. 
The rate of initial hospitalizations for death, non-fatal myocardial infarction 
with/without major complications and PCI within 28 days was calculated based on 
the COMMIT clinical paper. Three CURE papers, concerning non-STEMI patients, 
were used to estimate the event rates between 29 days and 1 year. 
Hospitalizations were assigned a diagnosis-related group (DRG). Costs for each 
DRG were estimated from the Medicare reimbursement rate. Clopidogrel was assumed 
to be given for 1 year, priced at $4.22/day. Life expectancy gain as a result of 
the prevention of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke was estimated using 
Framingham data.
RESULTS: Within 28 days, adding clopidogrel to aspirin is likely a dominant 
strategy, lowering the event rate (9.2% vs. 10.1%) without an increase in cost 
($7791 vs. $7797). Over a lifetime, treating for 1 year with 
clopidogrel-plus-aspirin produced a gain of 0.1187 life years at an incremental 
cost of $1269 compared to aspirin alone, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $10,691/life year gained. Sensitivity 
analyses showed that ICERs for clopidogrel are well below the common benchmark 
ceiling ratio of $50,000/life year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Addition of clopidogrel to aspirin, given up to 1 year, in the 
setting of STEMI is a highly cost-effective strategy.

We investigated the effect of electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS) on cerebral 
circulation in vivo using the method for measuring microcirculation in real time 
with the photosensitizer dye Photosense and the fiber optic spectrofluorometer 
LESA-01-BIOSPEC. We have found that electroconvulsive stimulation significantly 
improved cerebral microcirculation (fourfold higher comparing to the control 
cerebral perfusion) after 30 min of room-temperature cardiac arrest. Morphologic 
study of the brain tissue showed the absence of rouleaux formation of 
erythrocytes ("sludged blood") in the cerebral cortex microcirculation after the 
application of electrical stimulus. Electroconvulsive stimulation may be useful 
for improving cerebral microcirculation (blood flow) in cases of long-term brain 
hypoxia/anoxia after prolonged cardiac arrest.

electron donors and acceptors.

The metal-centered and macrocycle-centered electron-transfer oxidations and 
reductions of silver(II) porphyrins were characterized in nonaqueous media by 
electrochemistry, UV-vis spectroelectrochemistry, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT 
calculations. The investigated compounds are 
{5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)porphyrinato}silver(II), 
{5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)quinoxalino[2,3-b']porphyrinato}silver(II), 
{5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)bisquinoxalino[2,3-b':7,8-b'']porphyrinato}silver(II), 
and 
{5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)bisquinoxalino[2,3-b':12,13-b'']porphyrinato}silver(II). 
The first one-electron oxidation and first one-electron reduction both occur at 
the metal center to produce stable compounds with Ag(III) or Ag(I) metal 
oxidation states, irrespective of the type of porphyrin ligand. The 
electrochemical HOMO-LUMO gap, determined by the difference in the first 
oxidation and first reduction potentials, decreases by introduction of 
quinoxaline groups fused to the Ag(II) porphyrin macrocycle. This provides a 
unique androgynous character to Ag(II) quinoxalinoporphyrins that enables them 
to act as both good electron donors and good electron acceptors, something not 
previously observed in other metalloporphyrin complexes. The second one-electron 
oxidation and second one-electron reduction of the compounds both occur at the 
porphyrin macrocycle to produce Ag(III) porphyrin pi-radical cations and Ag(I) 
porphyrin pi-radical anions, respectively. The macrocycle-centered oxidation 
potentials of each quinoxalinoporphyrin are shifted in a negative direction, 
while the macrocycle-centered reduction potentials are shifted in a positive 
direction as compared to the same electrode reactions of the porphyrin without 
the fused quinoxaline ring(s). Both potential shifts are due to a stabilization 
of the radical cations and radical anions by pi-extension of the porphyrin 
macrocycle after fusion of one or two quinoxaline moieties at the beta-pyrrolic 
positions of the macrocycle. Introduction of quinoxaline groups fused to the 
Ag(II) porphyrin macrocycle provides a unique androgynous character to Ag(II) 
quinoxalinoporphyrins that enables them to act as both good electron donors and 
good electron acceptors.

[Programming of potential longevity in early ontogenesis as a sign of epigenetic 
adaptation].

[Article in Ukrainian]

Vaĭserman OM.

Recently, a cluster of new hypotheses of aging has been suggested, which 
explicitly predict the importance of early-life events in health and life span 
modulations. It has been widely assumed that these long-lasting consequences of 
early-life exposures may depend on the same mechanisms as those underlying 
'cellular memory' i.e. epigenetic inheritance systems. There is growing body of 
evidence that environmentally-induced perturbations in the epigenetic processes 
(which involve alterations of gene expression without a change in DNA sequence) 
can determine different aspects of aging, as well as etiology and pathogenesis 
of age-related diseases. Long-term beneficial effects (epigenetic adaptation) 
can also occur under some conditions. Changes in gene expression were detected 
by the life-extending hormetic interventions, such as irradiation, both heat and 
cold shocks, dietary restriction and hypergravity, as well as by geroprotectors 
(e.g., antioxidants). It might be hypothesized that life-extending effects are 
most likely a consequence of unspecific (hormetic) action, rather then specific 
(geroprotective) action, and induced transcriptional changes may be a common 
mechanism for all anti-aging treatments. The epigenetic interventions (e.g., 
pre- and postnatal mild stresses), it seems, can be specifically useful in the 
modulation of aging processes and healthy life extension.

Comment on
    Hist Psychiatry. 2007 Jun;18(70 Pt 2):233-45.

Karl Kahlbaum (1828-99) introduced the concept of time into European psychiatric 
nosology. In 1863 he first expressed the view that disease definition should 
take into account the course of the disease, the extension to which 
psychological functions were compromised, the relevance of the period of life 
when the mental disorder first appeared, and its primary or secondary nature. 
Via E. Kraepelin these ideas have moulded the way in which mental disorder has 
been conceived ever since. And yet Kahlbaum never made it into academic 
psychiatry. For reasons which remain obscure, he did not obtain a university 
teaching position and had to spend the rest of his life in private psychiatry. 
Whether the novelty of his ideas irked contemporary psychiatric officialdom 
needs further study.

States.

Policy, Cambridge, MA, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the health and economic outcomes associated with changes 
in folic acid consumption following the fortification of enriched grain products 
in the USA.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: Annual burden of disease, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and costs 
were projected for four steady-state strategies: no fortification, or fortifying 
with 140, 350 or 700 microg folic acid per 100 g enriched grain. The analysis 
considered four health outcomes: neural tube defects (NTD), myocardial 
infarctions (MI), colon cancers and B12 deficiency maskings.
SUBJECTS: The US adult population subgroups defined by age, gender and 
race/ethnicity, with folate intake distributions from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Surveys (1988-1992 and 1999-2000), and reference sources 
for disease incidence, utility and economic estimates.
RESULTS: The greatest benefits from fortification were predicted in MI 
prevention, with 16 862 and 88 172 cases averted per year in steady state for 
the 140 and 700 microg fortification levels, respectively. These projections 
were between 6261 and 38 805 for colon cancer and 182 and 1423 for NTD, while 
15-820 additional B12 cases were predicted. Compared with no fortification, all 
post-fortification strategies provided QALY gains and cost savings for all 
subgroups, with predicted population benefits of 266 649 QALY gained and $3.6 
billion saved in the long run by changing the fortification level from 140 
microg/100 g enriched grain to 700 microg/100 g.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that the health and economic gains of 
folic acid fortification far outweigh the losses for the US population, and that 
increasing the level of fortification deserves further consideration to maximise 
net gains.
