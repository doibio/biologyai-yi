specifically LGG, or brain tumors including LGG. They comprised 124 brain tumor 
patients, including 62 LGG, with SD incidence ranging from 44 to 63%. SD was 
reported by more than 50% of interrogated women in the three studies. Regarding 
QoL, two out of the three studies found significant associations between SD and 
alterations of QoL parameters, particularly in the field of social and 
functional wellbeing. Finally, we discussed those results regarding methods of 
evaluation, inherent biases, and therapeutic implications regarding antiseizure 
medications and also planning of surgery, chemo-, and radiotherapy. Our review 
showed that SD is highly prevalent but still poorly studied in LGG patients. As 
those patients are usually young and enjoy an active life, there is a need to 
assess more systematically the occurrence of SD in clinical routine, in order to 
adapt cancer treatments accordingly, to manage actively these troubles, and 
finally to improve patients' QoL in the long run.

Strength is essential for carrying out the usual activities of daily life. As 
there is a loss of strength in elderly, many treatments are based on delaying 
the loss of strength or maintaining it. Isokinetic dynamometry is the gold 
standard for assessing strength. It is essential that studies are conducted to 
allow us to identify the reliability of isokinetic strength assessments in older 
people. This study aimed to test the absolute and relative intra-session 
reliability of peak torque and work of a concentric knee extension-flexion 
performed at 60°/s in elderly. Fifty-two elderly subjects performed three 
repetitions of bilateral concentric knee extension-flexion at 60°/s using an 
isokinetic dynamometer. The relative and absolute reliability were calculated 
between the second and third repetition. The intra-class correlation coefficient 
values were between 0.94 and 0.98 for peak torque and work in all measures, 
which is considered “excellent”, except for left leg flexors in women, with 
values between 0.85 and 0.88, which is considered “good”. The standard error of 
measurement (SEM) percentage oscillated from 3.9% to 10.5%, with a smallest real 
difference (SRD) percentage of 10.9% to 29.2% for peak torque. The relative 
reliability of peak torque and work were excellent for all measures except 
flexors in women, evidencing the utility of isokinetic dynamometry for 
monitoring lower limb maximal muscle strength and work of concentric knee 
extension-flexion at 60°/s/s in the elderly. In addition, an SRD > 19.9% in peak 
torque and an SRD > 23.1% in work is considered a true change.

Boxwood blight caused by Cps is an emerging disease that has had devastating 
impacts on Buxus spp. in the horticultural sector, landscapes, and native 
ecosystems. In this study, we produced a process-based climatic suitability 
model in the CLIMEX program and combined outputs of four different correlative 
modeling algorithms to generate an ensemble correlative model. All models were 
fit and validated using a presence record dataset comprised of Cps detections 
across its entire known invaded range. Evaluations of model performance provided 
validation of good model fit for all models. A consensus map of CLIMEX and 
ensemble correlative model predictions indicated that not-yet-invaded areas in 
eastern and southern Europe and in the southeastern, midwestern, and Pacific 
coast regions of North America are climatically suitable for Cps establishment. 
Most regions of the world where Buxus and its congeners are native are also at 
risk of establishment. These findings provide the first insights into Cps global 
invasion threat, suggesting that this invasive pathogen has the potential to 
significantly expand its range.

Background: Heritability explains 45-82% of muscle mass and strength variation, 
yet polygenic models for muscle phenotypes in older women are scarce. Therefore, 
the objective of the present study was to (1) assess if total genotype 
predisposition score (GPSTOTAL) for a set of polymorphisms differed between 
older women with low and high muscle mass, and (2) utilise a data-driven GPS 
(GPSDD) to predict the variance in muscle size and strength-related phenotypes. 
Methods: In three-hundred 60- to 91-year-old Caucasian women (70.7 ± 5.7 years), 
skeletal muscle mass, biceps brachii thickness, vastus lateralis anatomical 
cross-sectional area (VLACSA), hand grip strength (HGS), and elbow flexion 
(MVCEF) and knee extension (MVCKE) maximum voluntary contraction were measured. 
Participants were classified as having low muscle mass if the skeletal muscle 
index (SMI) < 6.76 kg/m2 or relative skeletal muscle mass (%SMMr) < 22.1%. 
Genotyping was completed for 24 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). GPSTOTAL 
was calculated from 23 SNPs and compared between the low and high muscle mass 
groups. A GPSDD was performed to identify the association of SNPs with other 
skeletal muscle phenotypes. Results: There was no significant difference in 
GPSTOTAL between low and high muscle mass groups, irrespective of classification 
based on SMI or %SMMr. The GPSDD model, using 23 selected SNPs, revealed that 13 
SNPs were associated with at least one skeletal muscle phenotype: HIF1A 
rs11549465 was associated with four phenotypes and, in descending number of 
phenotype associations, ACE rs4341 with three; PTK2 rs7460 and CNTFR rs2070802 
with two; and MTHFR rs17421511, ACVR1B rs10783485, CNTF rs1800169, MTHFR 
rs1801131, MTHFR rs1537516, TRHR rs7832552, MSTN rs1805086, COL1A1 rs1800012, 
and FTO rs9939609 with one phenotype. The GPSDD with age included as a predictor 
variable explained 1.7% variance of biceps brachii thickness, 12.5% of VLACSA, 
19.0% of HGS, 8.2% of MVCEF, and 9.6% of MVCKE. Conclusions: In older women, 
GPSTOTAL did not differ between low and high muscle mass groups. However, GPSDD 
was associated with muscle size and strength phenotypes. Further advancement of 
polygenic models to understand skeletal muscle function during ageing might 
become useful in targeting interventions towards older adults most likely to 
lose physical independence.

Systematic Analysis of Literature on the Healthcare Financial Models to Follow 
in Russia and Romania.

University of Brasov, 500068 Brasov, Romania.

This paper aims at finding the suitable healthcare financial model, focusing on 
their pros and cons, as debated by several scholars. The focus is on the 
potential benefits for both Romanian and Russian healthcare systems. To reach 
this goal, a systematic review of the literature was conducted, and various 
competitive advantages and disadvantages of the financial models were extracted. 
We reviewed 77 papers published during the last 21 years that were found in 
famous scientific databases. The main findings of the research point out that 
the financing of healthcare systems should be based on hybrid sources, and the 
funds raised should be better invested in order to create added value. By 
assuring a proper financing, the population's quality of life will improve and 
life expectancy will increase. This paper provides a new viewpoint to the 
problem because it reviews certain papers from Russian literature which are not 
usually included in the review articles. The research results have implications 
for the government, medical community, and academia, which should work together 
to strengthen the healthcare system.

Introduction: Resilience-which we define as the "ability to bounce back from 
stress"-can foster successful aging among older, racially and ethnically diverse 
women. This study investigated the association between psychological resilience 
in the Women's Health Initiative Extension Study (WHI-ES) and three constructs 
defined by Staudinger's 2015 model of resilience and aging: (1) perceived 
stress, (2) non-psychological resources, and (3) psychological resources. We 
further examined whether the relationship between resilience and key resources 
differed by race/ethnicity. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis on 77,395 
women aged 62+ (4475 Black or African American; 69,448 non-Hispanic White; 1891 
Hispanic/Latina; and 1581 Asian or Pacific Islanders) who enrolled in the 
WHI-ES, which was conducted in the United States. Participants completed a short 
version of the Brief Resilience Scale one-time in 2011. Guided by Staudinger's 
model, we used linear regression analysis to examine the relationships between 
resilience and resources, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and stressful life 
events. To identify the most significant associations, we applied elastic net 
regularization to our linear regression models. Findings: On average, women who 
reported higher resilience were younger, had fewer stressful life events, and 
reported access to more resources. Black or African American women reported the 
highest resilience, followed by Hispanic/Latina, non-Hispanic White, and Asian 
or Pacific Islander women. The most important resilience-related resources were 
psychological, including control of beliefs, energy, personal growth, mild-to-no 
forgetfulness, and experiencing a sense of purpose. Race/ethnicity significantly 
modified the relationship between resilience and energy (overall interaction p = 
0.0017). Conclusion: Increasing resilience among older women may require 
culturally informed stress reduction techniques and resource-building 
strategies, including empowerment to control the important things in life and 
exercises to boost energy levels.

Life expectancy has increased, so the number of people in need of intensive care 
and attention is also growing. Falls are a major problem for older adult health, 
mainly because of the consequences they entail. Falls are indeed the second 
leading cause of unintentional death in the world. The impact on privacy, the 
cost, low performance, or the need to wear uncomfortable devices are the main 
causes for the lack of widespread solutions for fall detection and prevention. 
This work present a solution focused on bedtime that addresses all these causes. 
Bed exit is one of the most critical moments, especially when the person suffers 
from a cognitive impairment or has mobility problems. For this reason, this work 
proposes a system that monitors the position in bed in order to identify risk 
situations as soon as possible. This system is also combined with an automatic 
fall detection system. Both systems work together, in real time, offering a 
comprehensive solution to automatic fall detection and prevention, which is low 
cost and guarantees user privacy. The proposed system was experimentally 
validated with young adults. Results show that falls can be detected, in real 
time, with an accuracy of 93.51%, sensitivity of 92.04% and specificity of 
95.45%. Furthermore, risk situations, such as transiting from lying on the bed 
to sitting on the bed side, are recognized with a 96.60% accuracy, and those 
where the user exits the bed are recognized with a 100% accuracy.

Trastuzumab and Doxorubicin Sequential Administration Increases Oxidative Stress 
and Phosphorylation of Connexin 43 on Ser368.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is overexpressed in up to 30% of 
breast cancer cases, causing a more aggressive tumour growth and poor prognosis. 
Trastuzumab, the humanized antibody targeted to HER2, increased the life 
expectancy of patients, but severe cardiotoxicity emerged as a long-term adverse 
effect. Clinical evidence highlights that Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity 
drastically increases in association with Doxorubicin; however, the exact 
mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. In order to analyse the 
molecular mechanisms involved and the possible adaptative responses to 
Trastuzumab and Doxorubicin treatment, in this study, H9c2 cardiomyoblasts were 
used. Results showed that Trastuzumab and Doxorubicin sequential administration 
in cardiomyoblast increased cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS production, 
intracellular calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and 
the consequent apoptosis, induced by both Trastuzumab and Doxorubicin alone. 
Furthermore, in these conditions, we observed increased levels of Connexin43 
phosphorylated on Ser368 (pCx43). Since phosphorylation on Ser368 decreases gap 
junction intracellular communication, thus reducing the spread of death signals 
to adjacent cells, we hypothesized that the increase in pCx43 could be an 
adaptative response implemented by cells to defend neighbouring cells by 
Trastuzumab and Doxorubicin sequential administration. However, the other side 
of the coin is the resulting conduction abnormalities.

Striving for longevity is neither a recent human desire nor a novel scientific 
field. The first article on this topic was published in 1838, when the average 
human life expectancy was approximately 40 years. Although nowadays people on 
average live almost as twice as long, we still (and perhaps more than ever) look 
for new ways to extend our lifespan. During this seemingly endless journey of 
discovering efficient methods to prolong life, humans were enthusiastic 
regarding several approaches, one of which is caloric restriction (CR). Where 
does CR, initially considered universally beneficial for extending both lifespan 
and health span, stand today? Does a lifelong decrease in food consumption 
represent one of the secrets of centenarians' long and healthy life? Do we still 
believe that if we eat less, we will live longer? This review aims to summarize 
the current literature on CR as a potential life-prolonging intervention in 
humans and discusses metabolic pathways that underlie this effect.

Targeting Cell Cycle Progression in HER2+ Breast Cancer: An Emerging Treatment 
Opportunity.

57105, USA.

The development of HER2-targeted therapies has dramatically improved patient 
survival and patient management and increased the quality of life in the HER2+ 
breast cancer patient population. Due to the activation of compensatory 
pathways, patients eventually suffer from resistance to HER2-directed therapies 
and develop a more aggressive disease phenotype. One of these mechanisms is the 
crosstalk between ER and HER2 signaling, especially the CDK4/6-Cyclin D-Rb 
signaling axis that is commonly active and has received attention for its 
potential role in regulating tumor progression. CDK 4/6 inhibitors interfere 
with the binding of cell-cycle-dependent kinases (CDKs) with their cognate 
partner cyclins, and forestall the progression of the cell cycle by preventing 
Rb phosphorylation and E2F release that consequentially leads to cancer cell 
senescence. CDK 4/6 inhibitors, namely, palbociclib, ribociclib, and 
abemaciclib, in combination with anti-estrogen therapies, have shown impressive 
outcomes in hormonal receptor-positive (HR+) disease and have received approval 
for this disease context. As an extension of this concept, preclinical/clinical 
studies incorporating CDK 4/6 inhibitors with HER2-targeted drugs have been 
evaluated and have shown potency in limiting tumor progression, restoring 
therapeutic sensitivity, and may improving the management of the disease. 
Currently, several clinical trials are examining the synergistic effects of CDK 
4/6 inhibitors with optimized HER2-directed therapies for the (ER+/-) HER2+ 
population in the metastatic setting. In this review, we aim to interrogate the 
burden of HER2+ disease in light of recent treatment progress in the field and 
examine the clinical benefit of CDK 4/6 inhibitors as a replacement for 
traditional chemotherapy to improve outcomes in HER2+ breast cancer.

Fascin, a major actin cross-linking protein, is expressed in most vertebrate 
epithelial tissues. It organizes actin filaments into well-ordered bundles that 
are responsible for the extension of dynamic membrane protrusions, including 
microspikes, filopodia, and invadopodia from cell surfaces, which are involved 
in cell migration and invasion as critical components of cancer metastasis. 
However, it is not well-understood how fascin-1 induces actin binding/bundling 
and where fascin-1 localizes along the actin filaments, thus facilitating actin 
bundle formation. In the present study, we attempted to clarify these problems 
by using biochemical and electron microscopic analyses using various fascin-1 
constructs. Three dimensional structures of actin/fascin-1 complex were obtained 
by electron microscopy (EM) with iterative helical real-space reconstruction 
(IHRSR) and tomography. We revealed that the N-terminal region containing the 
Actin-Binding Site 2 (ABS2) of fascin-1 is responsible for actin bundling and 
the C-terminal region is important for the dimerization of fascin-1. We also 
found that the dimerization of fascin-1 through intermolecular interactions of 
the C-terminal region is essential for actin bundling. Since fascin is an 
important factor in cancer development, it is expected that the findings of 
present study will provide useful information for development of therapeutic 
strategies for cancer.

Background and Objectives: Malignant neoplasms are common causes of acute 
pleuropericardial effusion. Pleuropericarditis denotes poor patient prognosis, 
is associated with shortened average survival time, and represents a surgical 
emergency. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the impact of two minimally 
invasive surgical approaches, the type of cancer, and other clinical variables 
on the mortality of 338 patients with pleuropericarditis admitted to an 
emergency hospital in Romania between 2009 and 2020. All patients underwent 
minimally invasive surgeries to prevent the recurrence of the disease and to 
increase their life expectancy. Log-rank tests were used to check for survival 
probability differences by surgical approach. We also applied univariate and 
multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to assess the effect of each 
covariate. Results: No significant differences were found in the 2-year overall 
survival rate between patients who underwent the two types of surgery. The 
multivariate Cox proportional regression model adjusted for relevant covariates 
showed that age, having lung cancer, and a diagnosis of pericarditis and right 
pleural effusion increased the mortality risk. The surgical approach was not 
associated with mortality in these patients. Conclusion: These findings open up 
avenues for future research to advance the understanding of survival among 
patients with pleuropericarditis.

The emerging elicitor protein Hrip1 was evaluated for sublethal effects and 
biocontrol potential in the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris. In Megoura japonica 
Matsumura, purified elicitor protein Hrip1 was investigated for impacts on 
endurance, life expectancy, juvenile expansion, fully grown procreative 
performance, and pathogen-pest interface. The multi-acting entomopathogenic 
effects of the active compounds of Alternaria tenuissima active on Hrip1 in 
common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) plants were also investigated. Megoura 
japonica population expansion was reduced by Hrip1 treatments (second and third 
generations). In a host selection test, control plants colonized quicker than 
Hrip1-treated P. vulgaris plants. Hrip1 influenced the longevity, development, 
and fertility of insects. Hrip1-elicitor protein concentrations aided M. 
japonica nymph development. Similarly, seedlings treated with Hrip1 generated 
fewer offspring than seedlings not treated with Hrip1. Hrip1 altered plant 
height and leaf surface structure, reducing M. japonica reproduction and 
colonization. Hrip1-treated P. vulgaris seedlings exhibited somewhat increased 
amounts of jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and ethylene (ET). The integrated 
management of insect pests and biocontrol with Hrip1 in the agroecosystem 
appears to be suitable against M. japonica based on these findings.

Lignocellulose, the main component of plant cell walls, comprises polyaromatic 
lignin and fermentable materials, cellulose and hemicellulose. It is a plentiful 
and renewable feedstock for chemicals and energy. It can serve as a raw material 
for the production of various value-added products, including cellulase and 
xylanase. Cellulase is essentially required in lignocellulose-based 
biorefineries and is applied in many commercial processes. Likewise, xylanases 
are industrially important enzymes applied in papermaking and in the manufacture 
of prebiotics and pharmaceuticals. Owing to the widespread application of these 
enzymes, many prokaryotes and eukaryotes have been exploited to produce 
cellulase and xylanases in good yields, yet yeasts have rarely been explored for 
their plant-cell-wall-degrading activities. This review is focused on 
summarizing reports about cellulolytic and xylanolytic yeasts, their properties, 
and their biotechnological applications.

This study was aimed at characterizing the gut microbiota (GM) and its 
functional profile in two groups of Sardinian subjects with a long healthy life 
expectancy, overall named Long-Lived Subjects (LLS) [17 centenarians (CENT) and 
29 nonagenarians (NON)] by comparing them to 46 healthy younger controls (CTLs). 
In addition, the contribution of genetics and environmental factors to the GM 
phenotype was assessed by comparing a subgroup of seven centenarian parents 
(CPAR) with a paired cohort of centenarians' offspring (COFF). The analysis was 
performed through Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of the V3 and V4 
hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene on the MiSeq Illumina platform. The 
Verrucomicrobia phylum was identified as the main biomarker in CENT, together 
with its members Verrucomicrobiaceae, Akkermansia and Akkermansia muciniphila. 
In NON, the strongest associations concern Actinobacteria phylum, 
Bifidobacteriaceae and Bifidobacterium, while in CTLs were related to the 
Bacteroidetes phylum, Bacteroidaceae, Bacteroides and Bacteroides spp. 
Intestinal microbiota of CPAR and COFF did not differ significantly from each 
other. Significant correlations between bacterial taxa and clinical and 
lifestyle data, especially with Mediterranean diet adherence, were observed. We 
observed a harmonically balanced intestinal community structure in which the 
increase in taxa associated with intestinal health would limit and counteract 
the action of potentially pathogenic bacterial species in centenarians. The GM 
of long-lived individuals showed an intrinsic ability to adapt to changing 
environmental conditions, as confirmed by functional analysis. The GM analysis 
of centenarians' offspring suggest that genetics and environmental factors act 
synergistically as a multifactorial cause in the modulation of GM towards a 
phenotype similar to that of centenarians, although these findings need to be 
confirmed by larger study cohorts and by prospective studies.

Intravenous (IV) administration of antiviral monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be 
challenging, particularly during an ongoing epidemic, due to the considerable 
resources required for performing infusions. An ebolavirus therapeutic 
administered via intramuscular (IM) injection would reduce the burdens 
associated with IV infusion and allow rapid treatment of exposed individuals 
during an outbreak. Here, we demonstrate how MBP134, a cocktail of two 
pan-ebolavirus mAbs, reverses the course of Sudan ebolavirus disease (Gulu 
variant) with a single IV or IM dose in non-human primates (NHPs) as late as 
five days post-exposure. We also investigate the utility of adding half-life 
extension mutations to the MBP134 mAbs, ultimately creating a half-life extended 
cocktail designated MBP431. When delivered as a post-exposure prophylactic or 
therapeutic, a single IM dose of MBP431 offered complete or significant 
protection in NHPs challenged with Zaire ebolavirus. In conjunction with 
previous studies, these results support the use of MBP431 as a rapidly 
deployable IM medical countermeasure against every known species of ebolavirus.

Systemic mastocytosis (SM) results from a clonal proliferation of abnormal mast 
cells (MCs) in extra-cutaneous organs. It could be divided into indolent SM, 
smoldering SM, SM with an associated hematologic (non-MC lineage) neoplasm, 
aggressive SM, and mast cell leukemia. SM is generally associated with the 
presence of a gain-of-function somatic mutation in KIT at codon 816. Clinical 
features could be related to MC mediator release or to uncontrolled infiltration 
of MCs in different organs. Whereas indolent forms have a near-normal life 
expectancy, advanced diseases have a poor prognosis with short survival times. 
Indolent forms should be considered for symptom-directed therapy, while 
cytoreductive therapy represents the first-line treatment for advanced diseases. 
Since the emergence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), KIT inhibition has 
been an attractive approach. Initial reports showed that only the rare KITD816V 
negative cases were responsive to first-line TKI imatinib. The development of 
new TKIs with activity against the KITD816V mutation, such as midostaurin or 
avapritinib, has changed the management of this disease. This review aims to 
focus on the available clinical data of therapies for SM and provide insights 
into possible future therapeutic targets.

Additive manufacturing or 3D printing of materials is a prominent process 
technology which involves the fabrication of materials layer-by-layer or 
point-by-point in a subsequent manner. With recent advancements in additive 
manufacturing, the technology has excited a great potential for extension of 
simple designs to complex multi-material geometries. Vat photopolymerization is 
a subdivision of additive manufacturing which possesses many attractive 
features, including excellent printing resolution, high dimensional accuracy, 
low-cost manufacturing, and the ability to spatially control the material 
properties. However, the technology is currently limited by design strategies, 
material chemistries, and equipment limitations. This review aims to provide 
readers with a comprehensive comparison of different additive manufacturing 
technologies along with detailed knowledge on advances in multi-material vat 
photopolymerization technologies. Furthermore, we describe popular material 
chemistries both from the past and more recently, along with future prospects to 
address the material-related limitations of vat photopolymerization. Examples of 
the impressive multi-material capabilities inspired by nature which are 
applicable today in multiple areas of life are briefly presented in the 
applications section. Finally, we describe our point of view on the future 
prospects of 3D printed multi-material structures as well as on the way forward 
towards promising further advancements in vat photopolymerization.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Globally, the population aged 80 years or older is growing 
faster due to the rising life expectancy. Korea has already entered into an 
advanced aged society, and a post-aged society is expected in 2025. This study 
evaluated the patterns of gastrointestinal disease in the population aged 80 
years or older during the recent decade in Korea.
METHOD: This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients 
admitted to the gastrointestinal department of Suwon St. Vincent's hospital, 
Incheon St. Mary's hospital, and Uijeongbu St. Mary's Hospital - general 
hospitals of Seoul-Gyeonggi province in Korea. It was a repeated cross-sectional 
study in 2009 and 2019.
RESULTS: The number of admitted patients aged 80 years or older increased from 
549 (9.0%) in 2009 to 1,073 (14.4%) in 2019 (p<0.01). As for the in-hospital 
mortality, there was no significant difference (p=0.25). On the other hand, the 
combined morbidities increased, and the duration of admission also increased 
(7.2±7.8 days vs. 8.1±8.2 days, p=0.03). The number of upper gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage and patients who are bleeding associated with drugs users increased 
(p<0.01). The proportion of lower gastrointestinal disease decreased (p<0.01) 
because of the decrease in procedure-related admissions (p<0.01). The number of 
those with pancreaticobiliary tract disease increased markedly (p<0.01), and the 
rate of cases that could not perform the procedure decreased (p=0.04).
CONCLUSION: The patterns of gastrointestinal disease in the population aged 80 
years or older have changed in the recent decade in Korea. Hence, more 
preparation for this medical environment is needed.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder, with a prevalence of 1 
in 2,500 live births. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. With the significant 
advancement in CFTR-directed therapies, life expectancy of CF patients has 
steadily increased. With improved survival, CF related co-morbidities have 
become more apparent. The most common endocrine complication includes Cystic 
fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD). Impaired glucose tolerance and insulin 
deficiency in CFRD leads to a decline in pulmonary function in CF patients. Here 
we review the underlying mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of CFRD, 
focusing on the role of CFTR in the regulation of insulin secretion from the 
β-cell. We then discuss CFTR modulators and their effect on impaired glucose 
tolerance and CFRD.

Rodent Modeling of Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome: In vivo and ex vivo 
Approaches.

Farrell C(1), Mumford P(1), Wiseman FK(1).

Author information:

Kingdom.

There are an estimated 6 million people with Down syndrome (DS) worldwide. In 
developed countries, the vast majority of these individuals will develop 
Alzheimer's disease neuropathology characterized by the accumulation of 
amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles within the brain, which 
leads to the early onset of dementia (AD-DS) and reduced life-expectancy. The 
mean age of onset of clinical dementia is ~55 years and by the age of 80, 
approaching 100% of individuals with DS will have a dementia diagnosis. DS is 
caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (Hsa21) thus an additional copy of a gene(s) 
on the chromosome must cause the development of AD neuropathology and dementia. 
Indeed, triplication of the gene APP which encodes the amyloid precursor protein 
is sufficient and necessary for early onset AD (EOAD), both in people who have 
and do not have DS. However, triplication of other genes on Hsa21 leads to 
profound differences in neurodevelopment resulting in intellectual disability, 
elevated incidence of epilepsy and perturbations to the immune system. This 
different biology may impact on how AD neuropathology and dementia develops in 
people who have DS. Indeed, genes on Hsa21 other than APP when in three-copies 
can modulate AD-pathogenesis in mouse preclinical models. Understanding this 
biology better is critical to inform drug selection for AD prevention and 
therapy trials for people who have DS. Here we will review rodent preclinical 
models of AD-DS and how these can be used for both in vivo and ex vivo (cultured 
cells and organotypic slice cultures) studies to understand the mechanisms that 
contribute to the early development of AD in people who have DS and test the 
utility of treatments to prevent or delay the development of disease.
