and facilitates the treatment process. This study aimed to use v10-specific 
aptamers to set up an optical aptasensor based on fluorescent metal 
nanoclusters. For this purpose, nanoclusters of silver, gold, and copper were 
prepared by different CD44 v10 DNA aptamers as molecular templates. UV-vis, TEM, 
and fluorescence spectrometer results confirmed the accuracy and quality of the 
synthesized aptamer-templated nanoclusters (Apt-NCs). Finally, we compared the 
performance of the as-prepared Apt-NCs in response to different cultured cell 
lines. According to the results, the optical response of M-Apt4-CuNCs was more 
efficient and correlated well with the concentrations of CD44 v10-enriched 
cells. The detection limit of the aptasensor was 40 ± 5 cells per mL.

BACKGROUND: A universally applicable approach that provides standard HALE 
measurements for different regions has yet to be developed because of the 
difficulties of health information collection. In this study, we developed a 
natural language processing (NLP) based HALE estimation approach by using 
individual-level electronic medical records (EMRs), which made it possible to 
calculate HALE timely in different temporal or spatial granularities.
METHODS: We performed diagnostic concept extraction and normalisation on 13•99 
million EMRs with NLP to estimate the prevalence of 254 diseases in WHO Global 
Burden of Disease Study (GBD). Then, we calculated HALE in Chongqing, 2017, by 
using the life table technique and Sullivan's method, and analysed the 
contribution of diseases to the expected years "lost" due to disability (DLE).
FINDINGS: Our method identified a life expectancy at birth (LE0) of 77•9 years 
and health-adjusted life expectancy at birth (HALE0) of 71•7 years for the 
general Chongqing population of 2017. In particular, the male LE0 and HALE0 were 
76•3 years and 68•9 years, respectively, while the female LE0 and HALE0 were 
80•0 years and 74•4 years, respectively. Cerebrovascular diseases, cancers, and 
injuries were the top three deterioration factors, which reduced HALE by 2•67, 
2•15, and 1•19 years, respectively.
INTERPRETATION: The results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of 
EMRs-based HALE estimation. Moreover, the method allowed for a potentially 
transferable framework that facilitated a more convenient comparison of 
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on HALE between regions. In summary, 
this study provided insightful solutions to the global ageing and health 
problems that the world is facing.

To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of a liver transplant program 
that utilizes normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) alongside static cold storage 
(SCS) compared to SCS alone (control). A Markov model compared strategies (NMP 
vs. control) using 1-year cycle lengths over a 5-year time horizon from the 
public healthcare payer perspective. Primary micro-costing data from a single 
center retrospective trial were applied along with utility values from 
literature sources. Transition probabilities were deduced using the 
retrospective trial cohort, local transplant data, and supplemented with 
literature values. Scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were 
conducted. The NMP strategy was cost-effective in comparison to the control 
strategy, which was dominated. The mean cost for NMP was $456 455 (2021 US$) and 
the control was $519 222. The NMP strategy had greater incremental 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gains over 5 years compared to the control, 
with 3.48 versus 3.17, respectively. The overarching results remained unchanged 
in scenario analysis. In PSA, NMP was cost-effective in 63% of iterations at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $40 941. The addition of NMP to a liver 
transplant program results in greater QALY gains and is cost-effective from the 
public healthcare payer perspective.

BACKGROUND: There is conflicting evidence on the impact of liver disease (CFLD) 
on life expectancy in CF. Therefore the aim of this systematic review was to 
evaluate the impact of liver disease (CFLD) on mortality in CF.
METHODS: The protocol was published at 
(https://hrbopenresearch.org/articles/3-44/v3) using PRISPMA-P guidelines and 
registered in Prospero 2020 (CRD42020182885). Three databases were searched for 
publications (1938-2020) where the outcome was all-cause mortality (defined as 
death and transplantation) or CF-specific mortality in participants with CFLD. 
Studies with and without a comparator group were included. Studies were divided 
into 2 groups based on the definition of CFLD: Group 1 used 2 categories of 
liver disease (i) liver disease with portal hypertension (PH) (ii) non-specific 
abnormalities which did not meet the criteria for PH, Group 2 studies only 
included participants with PH.
RESULTS: All 14 eligible studies were observational, with a moderate-high risk 
of bias, Six of the 14 studies directly compared mortality between those with 
CFLD and those with no liver disease, and 5/6 demonstrated that those with CFLD 
had at least 3 time the risk of death compared to those with no liver disease. 
Pulmonary complications were the primary cause of death.
CONCLUSION: This SR demonstrates that liver disease shortens life expectancy in 
CF, and that pulmonary complications are the primary cause of death in those 
with CFLD. There has been no improvement in survival for persons with CFLD 
despite significant improvements in life expectancy for persons with CF who have 
no evidence of liver disease.

PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-effective price of 
tisagenlecleucel, a novel, effective chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, 
versus salvage chemotherapy (SC) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL) using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
threshold of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from a US 
third-party payer's perspective.
METHODS: A three-state (progression-free survival, progressive disease, and 
death), responder-based partitioned survival model with a lifetime horizon and 
3% annual discount rate was developed. Overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival of tisagenlecleucel were estimated separately for 
patients with and without an overall response (OR), using data from JULIET ( 
Study of Efficacy and Safety of CTL019 in Adult DLBCL Patients). OS of SC was 
informed by SCHOLAR-1 (Retrospective Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Research). Mixture 
cure models were used to inform the survival of tisagenlecleucel responders, 
supported by JULIET. The median OS was 11.1 months in all 
tisagenlecleucel-treated patients but not reached for responders; no progression 
or death occurred among responders since month 22 of treatment. For 
tisagenlecleucel nonresponders and SC, survival was based on standard parametric 
models until month 60and the survival of DLBCL long-term survivors thereafter. 
The model prediction validated well against the observed trial data. Costs and 
utilities were from the literature; utilities depended on health states and were 
used to estimate QALYs. Total costs, QALYs, and incremental cost per QALY gained 
were estimated. A cost-effective price range was estimated for all 
tisagenlecleucel-treated patients, OR responders, and complete response (CR) 
responders. Deterministic sensitivity and scenario analyses and a probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis were performed. All costs were reported in or inflated to 
2020 US dollars.
FINDINGS: Tisagenlecleucel was associated with 3.35 QALYs gained versus SC.,The 
estimated incremental costs per QALY gained versus SC were $78,652 using the 
wholesale acquisition cost of $373,000 for tisagenlecleucel. The estimated 
cost-effective price of tisagenlecleucel in all treated patients was $612,270 at 
the WTP threshold of $150,000. Tisagenlecleucel OR and CR responders had an 
increase of 7.82 and 9.34 QALYs versus SC, with cost-effective prices estimated 
at $1,281,456 and $1,551,974, respectively. Sensitivity analysis results 
supported the base case findings.
IMPLICATIONS: Tisagenlecleucel is a cost-effective treatment versus SC for r/r 
DLBCL from the perspective of a US third-party payer. The estimated 
cost-effective prices ranged from $612,270 (all tisagenlecleucel-treated 
patients) to up to $1.5 million (patients achieving CR). Limitations include the 
use of single-arm trials due to data availability.

Like humans, weight control in overweight dogs is associated with a longer life 
expectancy and a healthier life. Dietary supplements are one of the best 
strategies for controlling obesity and obesity-associated diseases. This study 
was conducted to assess the potential of black ginseng (BG) and silkworm (SW) as 
supplements for weight control in diet-induced overweight beagle dogs. To 
investigate the changes that occur in dogs administered the supplements, 
different obesity-related parameters, such as body condition score (BCS), blood 
fatty acid profile, transcriptome, and microbiome, were assessed in high energy 
diet (HD) and HD with BG + SW supplementation (HDT) groups of test animals. 
After 12 weeks of BG + SW supplementation, total cholesterol and triglyceride 
levels were reduced in the HDT group. In the transcriptome analysis, nine genes 
(NUGGC, EFR3B, RTP4, ACAN, HOXC4, IL17RB, SOX13, SLC18A2, and SOX4) that are 
known to be associated with obesity were found to be differentially expressed 
between the ND (normal diet) and HD groups as well as the HD and HDT groups. 
Significant changes in some taxa were observed between the HD and ND groups. 
These data suggest that the BG + SW supplement could be developed as dietary 
interventions against diet-induced obesity, and obesity-related differential 
genes could be important candidates in the mechanism of the anti-obesity effects 
of the BG + SW supplement.

Human Texture Vision as Multi-Order Spectral Analysis.

Okada K(1), Motoyoshi I(1).

Author information:

Texture information plays a critical role in the rapid perception of scenes, 
objects, and materials. Here, we propose a novel model in which visual texture 
perception is essentially determined by the 1st-order (2D-luminance) and 
2nd-order (4D-energy) spectra. This model is an extension of the dimensionality 
of the Filter-Rectify-Filter (FRF) model, and it also corresponds to the 
frequency representation of the Portilla-Simoncelli (PS) statistics. We show 
that preserving two spectra and randomizing phases of a natural texture image 
result in a perceptually similar texture, strongly supporting the model. Based 
on only two single spectral spaces, this model provides a simpler framework to 
describe and predict texture representations in the primate visual system. The 
idea of multi-order spectral analysis is consistent with the hierarchical 
processing principle of the visual cortex, which is approximated by a 
multi-layer convolutional network.

Background  Salvage procedures, such as proximal row carpectomy, limited or 
total wrist arthrodesis, and wrist replacement, are generally preferred to treat 
advanced Kienböck's disease. However, these procedures are particularly 
aggressive and may have unpredictable results and potentially significant 
complications. Questions/Purpose  This study aimed to present the short- to 
mid-term clinical and functional results of arthroscopic debridement and 
arthrolysis in the management of advanced Kienböck's disease. Patients and 
Methods  Fifteen patients in whom Lichtman Stages IIIA to IIIC or IV Kienböck's 
disease was diagnosed and treated by arthroscopic wrist debridement and 
arthrolysis were included in this retrospective study. The mean age was 30 years 
(range: 21-45). The mean follow-up period duration was 36 months (range: 18-60). 
The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, visual analog 
scale (VAS), wrist range of motion (ROM), and grip strength were measured 
preoperatively and then again at the final follow-up visit. Results  The mean 
DASH and VAS scores improved from 41 (range: 31-52) and 7.1 (range: 6-8) 
preoperatively to 13 (range: 8-21) and 2 (range: 0-3; p  < 0.001) at the final 
follow-up visit, respectively. The mean wrist flexion and extension values 
increased from 32 (range: 20-60 degrees) and 56 degrees (range: 30-70 degrees; p 
 = 0.009) preoperatively to 34 (range: 10-65 degrees; p  = 0.218) and 57 degrees 
(range: 30-70 degrees; p  = 0.296) at the final follow-up appointment, 
respectively, although these findings were statistically insignificant. The mean 
strength of the hand grip increased from 22.7 (range: 9-33) to 23.3 (range: 
10-34; p  = 0.372). Conclusion  Arthroscopic debridement and arthrolysis may 
improve wrist function and quality of life due to the preserved ROM and hand 
grip strength after short- to mid-term follow-up periods despite the 
radiographic progression of Kienböck's disease. Level of Evidence  This is a 
Level IV, retrospective case series study.

Agriculture is one of the major forces to reckon with in the employment rate and 
overall economy of any nation. E-agriculture is not yet fully known to all 
farmers in Nigeria, hence affecting adversely production and the overall 
business chain. The acceptance and adoption of e-agriculture can make life 
better and advance the economy faster. This work investigated the acceptance of 
e-agriculture together with its adoption in Nigeria using questionnaires for 
data collection. This study seeks to discover to which extent e-agriculture is 
adopted by diverse categories of people with basic interest on the direct 
determinants of usage intention and behavior; direct determinant of user 
behavior, and impact moderators. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of 
Technology model was adopted and SmartPLS 3.0 was used for the analysis of the 
collected data. The study establishes that performance expectancy, effort 
expectancy, social influence and habit were discovered as variables that have 
significant effect on behavioral intention for the acceptance and adoption of 
e-agriculture while performance expectancy was discovered to be the most 
significant factor that influences the usage of e-agriculture in Nigeria. It is 
recommended that new factors like, quality of service, privacy concerns, and 
enhanced farmer support can be added as new factors in future works.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The programmed death 1 and ligand (PD-1/PD-L1) 
inhibitors have significantly altered therapeutic perspectives on non-small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). However, their efficacy and safety are unknown since direct 
clinical trials have not yet been performed on them. It is also necessary to 
determine the economics of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors due to their high cost. The aim 
was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 
inhibitor monotherapy for advanced NSCLC patients in China with high PD-L1 
expression as first-line treatment.
METHODS: From the PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases, we retrieved 
survival, progression, and safety data on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy for 
advanced NSCLC patients. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed to consider 
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in efficacy and safety. A Markov model with a 
full-lifetime horizon was adopted. Clinical and utility data were collected 
through the trial. The cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was as 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: This study included five phase III clinical trials using four drugs: 
nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and durvalumab. The NMA demonstrated 
that the four drugs had similar efficacy and safety, while pembrolizumab and 
atezolizumab were better for than for nivolumab (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.66, 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs): 0.46-0.95 and HR = 0.59, 95%CI: 0.37-0.94) in 
progression-free survival (PFS), and the risk of a severe adverse event was 
higher for atezolizumab than for nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Compared with 
nivolumab, durvalumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab had QALY of 0.19, 0.38, 
and 0.53, respectively, which induced ICERs of $ 197,028.8/QALY, 
$ 111,859.0/QALY, and $ 76,182.3/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The efficacy and safety are similar among types of 
PD-1/PD-L1-inhibitor monotherapy. The cost-effectiveness of nivolumab appears 
optimal, but the other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are not as cost-effective for the 
first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC in China.

Survival of South African children with cerebral palsy.

Brooks JC(1), Campbell RDD, Whittaker GA.

BACKGROUND: The South African (SA) public healthcare sector has experienced a 
surge in birth injury claims in recent years, particularly in respect of 
cerebral palsy (CP). The lump sum settlements in these matters are a function of 
the expected survival curve of the individual concerned. It is known from 
international studies that the life expectancy of children with CP is shorter 
than that of the general population, and depends on the pattern and severity of 
their disabilities. However, empirical estimates of survival for children with 
CP in SA are not available.
OBJECTIVES: To construct survival curves according to the pattern of gross motor 
skills for CP children in SA and compare these with international studies.
METHODS: We collected data on mortality and functional status for 339 CP 
children on whose behalf claims for medical negligence had been instituted. 
Motor disabilities were classified according to the five-level Gross Motor 
Function Classification System (GMFCS). Children who were unable to walk unaided 
were further classified according to more basic motor skills, including the 
ability to lift their heads or chests in the prone position, rolling and 
sitting. Mortality rates were calculated and survival curves were estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: No deaths were observed among 119 children in GMFCS levels I - IV. 
Among the 220 children in GMFCS V, there were 20 observed deaths. The 
proportions surviving to ages 10 and 15 years were 85% (standard error (SE) 5%) 
and 55% (SE 11%), respectively. The former is comparable to what has been 
reported for children in California and Sweden, but the survival to age 15 is 
lower. Among 82 children who could not lift their heads in the prone position, 
there were 11 observed deaths for a mortality rate of 48.5 (95% confidence 
interval (CI) 24.2 - 86.9) deaths per 1 000 person-years. Among 72 children who 
could lift their heads but not their chests, there were 6 observed deaths for a 
mortality rate of 33.5 (95% CI 12.3 - 73.0) deaths per 1 000 person-years. These 
mortality rates are 22% and 15% higher than the corresponding figures documented 
for children with comparable abilities and disabilities in California.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy of children with CP in SA is lower than that of 
children with comparably severe disabilities in high-income countries.

Background: Physicians' estimate of life expectancy in patients with spine 
metastasis frequently impacts treatment decisions regarding surgery, radiation 
techniques, dose, and fractionation. Objective: We aimed to identify predictors 
of survival and generate a stratification schema that could guide clinical 
decision making. Materials and Methods: We identified 269 patients who have 
undergone surgery and/or radiation for spine metastasis from 2002 to 2013 at an 
academic medical institution in the United States. A univariate survival 
analysis was carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in survival 
by histology were assessed using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was 
performed using the Cox proportional hazards model, then using the same 
variables, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was conducted to determine risk 
groups associated with survival. Results: The median overall survival was 4.76 
months. Twenty percent, 40%, and 57% of patients died within one, three, and six 
months of radiation treatment, respectively. RPA analysis resulted in three 
classes; class I included patients with Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥80. 
Class II included patients with KPS <80 and radioresistant or favorable 
histologies. Class III included all other histologies. Median survival in months 
was 11.4, 6.3, and 2.0, respectively. Conclusion: We developed a stratification 
schema predictive of survival in patients with spine metastasis. This RPA 
classification should be validated in independent patient populations from 
several institutions and may ultimately identify patients who are good 
candidates for more complex treatment regimens, such as stereotactic body 
radiotherapy.

Since the successful use of vaccinia virus (VACV) in the immunization strategies 
to eliminate smallpox, research has been focused on the development of 
recombinant VACV strains expressing proteins from various pathogens. Attempts at 
decreasing the side effects associated with exposure to recombinant, wild-type 
viral strains have led to the development of attenuated viruses. Yet while these 
attenuated VACV's have improved safety profiles compared to unmodified strains, 
their clinical use has been hindered due to efficacy issues in stimulating a 
host immune response. This deficiency has largely been attributed to decreased 
production of the target protein for immunization. Efforts to increase protein 
production from attenuated VACV strains has largely centered around modulation 
of viral factors, while manipulation of the translation of viral mRNAs has been 
largely unexplored. In this study we evaluate the use of translation enhancing 
element hTEE-658 to increase recombinant protein production in an attenuated 
VACV system. Optimization of the use of this motif is also attempted by 
combining it with strategies that have demonstrated effectiveness in previous 
research. We show that extension of the 5' leader sequence containing hTEE-658 
does not improve motif function, nor does the combination with other known 
translation enhancing elements. However, the sole use of hTEE-658 in an 
attenuated VACV system is shown to increase protein expression levels beyond 
those of a standard viral promoter when used with a wild-type virus. Taken 
together these results highlight the potential for hTEE-658 to improve the 
effectiveness of attenuated VACV vaccine candidates and give insights into the 
optimal sequence context for its use in vaccine design.

BACKGROUND: Current lung cancer risk-based screening approaches use a single 
risk-threshold, disregard life-expectancy, and ignore past screening findings. 
We address these limitations with a comprehensive analytical framework, the 
individualized lung cancer screening decision (ENGAGE) tool that aims to 
optimize lung cancer screening for US ever-smokers under dynamic risk assessment 
by incorporating life expectancy and past screening findings over time.
METHODS: ENGAGE employs a partially observable Markov decision process framework 
that integrates published risk prediction and disease progression models, to 
dynamically assess the trade-off between the expected health benefits and harms 
associated with screening. ENGAGE evaluates lung cancer risk annually and 
provides real-time screening eligibility that maximizes the expected 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of ever-smokers. We compare ENGAGE against 
the 2013 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) lung cancer screening 
guideline and single-threshold risk-based screening paradigms.
RESULTS: Compared with the 2013 USPSTF guidelines, ENGAGE expands screening 
coverage among ever-smokers (ENGAGE: 78%, USPSTF: 61%), while reducing the 
number of screening examinations per person (ENGAGE:10.43, USPSTF:12.07, 
P < .001), yields higher effectiveness in terms of increased lung 
cancer-specific mortality reduction (ENGAGE: 19%, USPSTF: 15%, P < .001) and 
improves screening efficiency (ENGAGE: 696, USPSTF: 819 screens per death 
avoided, P < .001). When compared against a single-threshold risk-based 
screening strategy, ENGAGE increases QALY requiring 30% fewer screens per death 
avoided (ENGAGE: 696, single-threshold: 889, P < .001), and reduces false 
positives by 40%.
CONCLUSIONS: ENGAGE provides a comprehensive framework for dynamic risk-based 
assessment of lung cancer screening eligibility by incorporating life expectancy 
and past screening findings that can serve to guide future policies on the 
effectiveness and efficiency of screening.
LAY SUMMARY: A novel decision-analytical screening framework was developed for 
lung cancer, the individualized lung cancer screening decision (ENGAGE) tool to 
provide personalized screening schedules for ever-smokers. ENGAGE captures the 
dynamic nature of lung cancer risk and incorporates life expectancy into the 
screening decision-making process. ENGAGE integrates past screening findings and 
changes in smoking behavior of individuals and provides informed screening 
decisions that outperform existing screening guidelines and single-threshold 
risk-based screening approaches. A personalized lung cancer screening program 
facilitated by a tool such as ENGAGE could enhance the efficiency of lung cancer 
screening.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy grows, so do the challenges of caring for an 
aging population. Older adults, including people with dementia, want to live 
independently and feel in control of their lives for as long as possible. 
Assistive technologies powered by artificial intelligence and internet of things 
devices are being proposed to provide living environments that support the 
users' safety, psychological, and medical needs through remote monitoring and 
interventions.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the functional, psychosocial, and 
environmental needs of people living with dementia, their caregivers, 
clinicians, and health and social care service providers toward the design and 
implementation of smart home systems.
METHODS: We used an iterative user-centered design approach comprising 9 
substudies. First, semistructured interviews (9 people with dementia, 9 
caregivers, and 10 academic and clinical staff) and workshops (35 pairs of 
people with dementia and caregivers, and 12 health and social care clinicians) 
were conducted to define the needs of people with dementia, home caregivers, and 
professional stakeholders in both daily activities and technology-specific 
interactions. Then, the spectrum of needs identified was represented via 
patient-caregiver personas and discussed with stakeholders in a workshop (14 
occupational therapists; 4 National Health Service pathway directors; and 6 
researchers in occupational therapy, neuropsychiatry, and engineering) and 2 
focus groups with managers of health care services (n=8), eliciting 
opportunities for innovative care technologies and public health strategies. 
Finally, these design opportunities were discussed in semistructured interviews 
with participants of a smart home trial involving environmental sensors, 
physiological measurement devices, smartwatches, and tablet-based chatbots and 
cognitive assessment puzzles (10 caregivers and 2 people with dementia). A 
thematic analysis revealed factors that motivate household members to use these 
technologies.
RESULTS: Outcomes of these activities include a qualitative and quantitative 
analysis of patient, caregiver, and clinician needs and the identification of 
challenges and opportunities for the design and implementation of remote 
monitoring systems in public health pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Participatory design methods supported the triangulation of 
stakeholder perspectives to aid the development of more patient-centered 
interventions and their translation to clinical practice and public health 
strategy. We discuss the implications and limitations of our findings, the value 
and the applicability of our methodology, and directions for future research.

Despite the fact that the incidence and mortality rates due to dengue virus 
(DENV) infection in Indonesia are relatively high, dengue vaccination has not 
yet been introduced. This study aimed to analyse the cost-effectiveness and the 
budget impact of dengue vaccination in Indonesia by taking the potential of 
pre-vaccination screening into account. An age-structured decision tree model 
was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness value by applying a single cohort 
of 4,710,100 children that was followed-up in a 10-year time horizon within a 
1-year analytical cycle. The budget impact was analysed in a 5-year period 
(2020-2024) by considering provinces' readiness to introduce dengue vaccine and 
their incidence rate of DENV infection in the last 10 years. Vaccination that 
was coupled with pre-vaccination screening would reduce dengue fever (DF), 
dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) by 188,142, 
148,089 and 426 cases, respectively. It would save treatment cost at $23,433,695 
and $14,091,642 from the healthcare and payer perspective, respectively. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) would be $5,733 and $5,791 per 
quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained from both perspectives. The most 
influential parameters affecting the ICERs were probability of DENV infection, 
vaccine efficacy, under-reporting factor, vaccine price, case fatality rate and 
screening cost. It can be concluded that dengue vaccination and pre-vaccination 
screening would be cost-effective to be implemented in Indonesia. Nevertheless, 
it seems unaffordable to be implemented since the total required cost for the 
nationwide vaccination would be 94.44% of routine immunization budget.

BACKGROUND: An ongoing debate exists over the optimal management of low-risk 
papillary thyroid cancer. The American Thyroid Association supports the concept 
of active surveillance to manage low-risk papillary thyroid cancer; however, the 
cost-effectiveness of active surveillance has not yet been established. We 
sought to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing active surveillance 
versus surgical intervention for patients in the United States.
METHODS: A Markov decision tree model was developed to compare active 
surveillance and thyroid lobectomy. Our reference case is a 40-year-old female 
who was diagnosed with unifocal (<15 mm), low-risk papillary thyroid cancer. 
Probabilistic outcomes, costs, and health utilities were determined using an 
extensive literature review. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set at 
$50,000/quality-adjusted life year gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed 
to account for uncertainty in the model's variables.
RESULTS: Lobectomy provided a final effectiveness of 21.7/quality-adjusted life 
years, compared with 17.3/quality-adjusted life years for active surveillance. 
Furthermore, incremental cost effectiveness ratio for lobectomy versus active 
surveillance was $19,560/quality-adjusted life year (<willing-to-pay threshold 
of $50,000/quality-adjusted life year), and thus surgical intervention proved to 
be cost-effective in patients between 40 and 69 years old. Further analysis 
revealed that, at the age of 69 years, active surveillance is more 
cost-effective than lobectomy, with a final effectiveness of 
17.3/quality-adjusted life years. Compared to active surveillance, the 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio for lobectomy at the age of 69 was 
$27,235/quality-adjusted life year, which decreases quality-adjusted life years 
by 1.5.
CONCLUSION: Lobectomy is a cost-effective strategy in middle-aged patients with 
low-risk papillary thyroid cancer. In contrast, active surveillance is 
cost-effective beginning at the age of 69. Identification of such nuances can 
help physicians and patients determine the best, most individualized long-term 
management strategy for low-risk papillary thyroid cancer.

BACKGROUND: Late recurrences in postmenopausal women with hormone 
receptor-positive breast cancers remain an important challenge. Avoidance or 
delayed development of resistance represents the main objective in extended 
endocrine therapy (ET). In animal models, resistance was reversed with 
restoration of circulating estrogen levels during interruption of letrozole 
treatment. This phase III, randomized, open-label Study of Letrozole Extension 
(SOLE) studied the effect of extended intermittent letrozole treatment in 
comparison with continuous letrozole. In parallel, the SOLE estrogen substudy 
(SOLE-EST) analyzed the levels of estrogen during the interruption of treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: SOLE enrolled 4884 postmenopausal women with hormone 
receptor-positive, lymph node-positive, operable breast cancer between December 
2007 and October 2012 and among them, 104 patients were enrolled in SOLE-EST. 
They must have undergone local treatment and have completed 4-6 years of 
adjuvant ET. Patients were randomized between continuous letrozole (2.5 mg/day 
orally for 5 years) and intermittent letrozole treatment (2.5 mg/day for 9 
months followed by a 3-month interruption in years 1-4 and then 2.5 mg/day 
during all of year 5).
RESULTS: Intention-to-treat population included 4851 women in SOLE (n = 2425 in 
the intermittent and n = 2426 in the continuous letrozole groups) and 103 women 
in SOLE-EST (n = 78 in the intermittent and n = 25 in the continuous letrozole 
groups). After a median follow-up of 84 months, 7-year disease-free survival 
(DFS) was 81.4% in the intermittent group and 81.5% in the continuous group 
(hazard ratio: 1.03, 95% confidence interval: 0.91-1.17). Reported adverse 
events were similar in both groups. Circulating estrogen recovery was 
demonstrated within 6 weeks after the stop of letrozole treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Extended adjuvant ET by intermittent administration of letrozole 
did not improve DFS compared with continuous use, despite the recovery of 
circulating estrogen levels. The similar DFS coupled with previously reported 
quality-of-life advantages suggest intermittent extended treatment is a valid 
option for patients who require or prefer a treatment interruption.
