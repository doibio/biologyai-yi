competitive, the cost uncertainty becomes more dominant. With limited 
substitutability, higher quality of technologies will increase the demand for 
those technologies disregarding the cost uncertainty. The results of the 
empirical application suggest that the first-line treatment may be the better 
choice when considering lifetime welfare.
CONCLUSIONS: Under uncertainty and irreversibility, low-risk patients must begin 
the second-line treatment as soon as possible, which is precisely when the 
second-line treatment is least valuable. As the costs of reversing current 
treatment impacts fall, it becomes more feasible to provide the 
option-preserving treatment to these low-risk individuals later on.

BACKGROUND: Statins are lipid-lowering drugs that reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine whether statin 
treatment for primary prevention in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes is 
cost-effective, taking nonadherence, baseline risk, and age into account.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by using a Markov model 
with a time horizon of 10 years. The baseline 10-year cardiovascular risk was 
estimated in a Dutch population of primary prevention patients with newly 
diagnosed diabetes from the Groningen Initiative to Analyse Type 2 Diabetes 
Treatment (GIANTT) database, using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study 
risk engine. Statin adherence was measured as pill days covered in the IADB.nl 
pharmacy research database. Cost-effectiveness was measured in costs per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from the health care payers' perspective.
RESULTS: For an average patient aged 60 years, the base case, statin treatment 
was highly cost-effective at €2245 per QALY. Favorable cost-effectiveness was 
robust in sensitivity analysis. Differences in age and 10-year cardiovascular 
risk showed large differences in cost-effectiveness from almost €100,000 per 
QALY to almost being cost saving. Treating all patients younger than 45 years at 
diabetes diagnosis was not cost-effective (weighted cost-effectiveness of almost 
€60,000 per QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the nonadherence levels observed in actual practice, statin 
treatment is cost-effective for primary prevention in patients newly diagnosed 
with type 2 diabetes. Because of large differences in cost-effectiveness 
according to different risk and age groups, the efficiency of the treatment 
could be increased by targeting patients with relatively higher cardiovascular 
risk and higher ages.

Quality-of-life-adjusted hazard of death: a formulation of the quality-adjusted 
life-years model of use in benefit-risk assessment.

Netherlands. Electronic address: alberto.garciahernandez@astellas.com.

BACKGROUND: Although the quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) model is standard in 
health technology assessment, quantitative methods are less frequent but 
increasingly used for benefit-risk assessment (BRA) at earlier stages of drug 
development. A frequent challenge when implementing metrics for BRA is to weigh 
the importance of effects on a chronic condition against the risk of severe 
events during the trial. The lifetime component of the QALY model has a 
counterpart in the BRA context, namely, the risk of dying during the study.
METHODS: A new concept is presented, the hazard of death function that a subject 
is willing to accept instead of the baseline hazard to improve his or her 
chronic health status, which we have called the quality-of-life-adjusted hazard 
of death.
RESULTS: It has been proven that if assumptions of the linear QALY model hold, 
the excess mortality rate tolerated by a subject for a chronic health 
improvement is inversely proportional to the mean residual life.
CONCLUSIONS: This result leads to a new representation of the linear QALY model 
in terms of hazard rate functions and allows utilities obtained by using 
standard methods involving trade-offs of life duration to be translated into 
thresholds of tolerated mortality risk during a short period of time, thereby 
avoiding direct trade-offs using small probabilities of events during the study, 
which is known to lead to bias and variability.

Effects of age, sex, and genotype on high-sensitivity metabolomic profiles in 
the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.

Researchers have used whole-genome sequencing and gene expression profiling to 
identify genes associated with age, in the hope of understanding the underlying 
mechanisms of senescence. But there is a substantial gap from variation in gene 
sequences and expression levels to variation in age or life expectancy. In an 
attempt to bridge this gap, here we describe the effects of age, sex, genotype, 
and their interactions on high-sensitivity metabolomic profiles in the fruit 
fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Among the 6800 features analyzed, we found that 
over one-quarter of all metabolites were significantly associated with age, sex, 
genotype, or their interactions, and multivariate analysis shows that individual 
metabolomic profiles are highly predictive of these traits. Using a metabolomic 
equivalent of gene set enrichment analysis, we identified numerous metabolic 
pathways that were enriched among metabolites associated with age, sex, and 
genotype, including pathways involving sugar and glycerophospholipid metabolism, 
neurotransmitters, amino acids, and the carnitine shuttle. Our results suggest 
that high-sensitivity metabolomic studies have excellent potential not only to 
reveal mechanisms that lead to senescence, but also to help us understand 
differences in patterns of aging among genotypes and between males and females.

Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies at Tufts Medical Center, Boston,

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this commentary was to compare the benefits and costs of 
the US Food and Drug Administration's proposed ban on artificial trans fats in 
US food versus other public health risks and interventions.
METHODS: This analysis assessed the remaining risk posed by artificial trans 
fats versus other risks, comparing them in terms of: (1) population disease 
burden (prevention of lost life-years and decreased quality of life, aggregated 
and expressed as quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]); (2) individual mortality 
risks for other "voluntary" activities; and (3) cost-effectiveness, which is the 
unit cost incurred by an intervention per QALY gained.
RESULTS: The population impact of remaining trans fats is small compared with 
many other risks. Conversely, lifetime individual risks are comparable to other 
individual risks that might be considered notable. Finally, the ban achieves 
public health gains at low to no cost.
CONCLUSIONS: The US Food and Drug Administration's ban on trans fats is sensible 
from the perspective of economic efficiency. Comparing the health risk addressed 
and the efficiency of the ban with other benchmarks can help decision makers and 
the population to better evaluate it.

BACKGROUND: Infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes differ in 
clinical manifestations among adults, varying in propensity for severity, 
invasiveness, and lethality. To characterize differences in serious outcomes 
between pneumococcal serotypes, we systematically reviewed the literature.
METHODS: After distilling 676 hits to 28 relevant articles, statistically 
significant differences in individual serotypes associated with serious clinical 
outcomes were assessed. Serotypes associated with elevated risk of serious 
clinical outcomes were evaluated in terms of serotypes included in licensed 
adult pneumococcal vaccines (i.e., 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
(PPSV23) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13)). Repeated 
findings were considered a measure of robustness.
RESULTS: Among adult studies evaluating serious clinical outcomes, the following 
serotypes were associated with elevated risk: Empyema (serotypes 1, 3, 5, 7F, 8, 
19A), necrotizing pneumonia (serotype 3), septic shock (serotypes 3, 19A), 
meningitis (repeatedly serotypes 10A, 15B, 19F, 23F), reduced quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs, serotypes 15B, 3, 10A, 9N, 19F, 11A, 31), and increased 
case-fatality rates (repeatedly serotypes 3, 6B, 9N, 11A, 16F, 19F, 19A).
CONCLUSION: Both vaccine formulations include multiple pneumococcal serotypes 
associated with increased risk for serious clinical outcomes. Three studies 
found elevated risk from serotype 6A (unique to PCV13). Fourteen studies found 
elevated risk from nine serotypes unique to PPSV23 (repeatedly: 
case-fatality-11A & 9N, meningitis-10A & 15B). Seven studies found elevated risk 
from serotypes not represented in either vaccine formulation (notably 16F). The 
pneumococcal serotypes repeatedly associated with elevated risk of serious 
outcomes in adults are an important consideration for vaccine policy making.

Mortality at older ages and moves in residential and sheltered housing: evidence 
from the UK.

Robards J(1), Evandrou M, Falkingham J, Vlachantoni A.

Author information:

Southampton, Hampshire, UK.

BACKGROUND: The study examines the relationship between transitions to 
residential and sheltered housing and mortality. Past research has focused on 
housing moves over extended time periods and subsequent mortality. In this 
paper, annual housing transitions allow the identification of the patterning of 
housing moves, the duration of stay in each sector and the assessment of the 
relationship of preceding moves to a heightened risk of dying.
METHODS: The study uses longitudinal data constructed from pooled observations 
from the British Household Panel Survey (waves 1993-2008). Records were pooled 
for all cases where the survey member is 65 years or over and living in private 
housing at baseline and observed at three consecutive time points, including 
baseline (N=23 727). Binary logistic regression (death as outcome three waves 
after baseline) explored the relative strength of different housing transitions, 
controlling for sociodemographic predictors.
RESULTS: (1) Transition to residential housing within the previous 12 months was 
associated with the highest mortality risk. (2) Results support existing 
findings showing an interaction between marital status and mortality, whereby 
unmarried persons were more likely to die. (3) Higher male mortality was 
observed across all housing transitions.
CONCLUSIONS: An older person's move to residential housing is associated with a 
higher risk of mortality within 12 months of the move. Survivors living in 
residential housing for more than a year, show a similar probability of dying to 
those living in sheltered housing. Results highlight that it is the type of 
accommodation that affects an older person's mortality risk, and the length of 
time they spend there.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although the patient value gain (improvement in 
quality-of-life and/or length-of-life) has been highlighted in Value-based 
Medicine cost-utility analyses, the financial value gain associated with 
healthcare interventions has received less emphasis. It is important for 
professional healthcare providers to realize their interventions often confer a 
large financial return-on-investment (ROI) to society.
RECENT FINDINGS: The societal costs associated with vitreoretinal and other 
ophthalmic interventions include: direct ophthalmic medical costs expended 
(hospital, physician, drug, diagnostic testing and so forth), direct medical 
costs saved (decreased costs for depression, injury, skilled nursing facility, 
nursing home and others), direct nonmedical costs saved (decreased costs for 
caregivers, transportation, residence costs, moving costs, and others), and 
indirect medical costs saved (improving employment incidence and wages). The 
financial ROI for direct ophthalmic medical costs expended for ranibizumab 
therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration is 450%, whereas that 
for cataract surgery is 4500% and for medical open-angle glaucoma therapy is 
4000%. Many costs gained add to the Gross Domestic Product and increase the 
wealth of the nation.
SUMMARY: Many vitreoretinal and other ophthalmologic interventions confer 
considerable patient value, but also result in a large financial ROI to society. 
This financial ROI increases the wealth of the nation.

Both liver resection (LR) and cadaveric liver transplantation (CLT) are 
potentially curative treatments for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
within the Milan criteria and with adequate liver function. Adopting either as a 
first-line therapy carries major cost and resource implications. The objective 
of this study was to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of LR against CLT 
for patients with HCC within the Milan criteria using a decision analytic model. 
A Markov cohort model was developed to simulate a cohort of patients aged 55 
years with HCC within the Milan criteria and Child-Pugh A/B cirrhosis, 
undergoing LR or CLT, and followed up over their remaining life expectancy. 
Analysis was performed in different geographical cost settings: the USA, 
Switzerland and Singapore. Transition probabilities were obtained from 
systematic literature reviews, supplemented by databases from Singapore and the 
Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (USA). Utility and cost data were 
obtained from open sources. LR produced 3.9 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
while CLT had an additional 1.4 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of CLT versus LR ranged from $111,821/QALY in Singapore to $156,300/QALY 
in Switzerland, and was above thresholds for cost-effectiveness in all three 
countries. Sensitivity analysis revealed that CLT-related 5-year cumulative 
survival, one-time cost of CLT, and post-LR 5-year cumulative recurrence rates 
were the most sensitive parameters in all cost scenarios. ICERs were reduced 
below threshold when CLT-related 5-year cumulative survival exceeded 84.9% and 
87.6% in Singapore and the USA, respectively. For Switzerland, the ICER remained 
above the cost-effectiveness threshold regardless of the variations.
CONCLUSION: In patients with HCC within the Milan criteria and Child-Pugh A/B 
cirrhosis, LR is more cost-effective than CLT across three different costing 
scenarios: the USA, Switzerland, Singapore.

reducing rates of clinically important errors in medicines management in general 
practices (PINCER).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We recently showed that a pharmacist-led information 
technology-based intervention (PINCER) was significantly more effective in 
reducing medication errors in general practices than providing simple feedback 
on errors, with cost per error avoided at £79 (US$131). We aimed to estimate 
cost effectiveness of the PINCER intervention by combining effectiveness in 
error reduction and intervention costs with the effect of the individual errors 
on patient outcomes and healthcare costs, to estimate the effect on costs and 
QALYs.
METHODS: We developed Markov models for each of six medication errors targeted 
by PINCER. Clinical event probability, treatment pathway, resource use and costs 
were extracted from literature and costing tariffs. A composite probabilistic 
model combined patient-level error models with practice-level error rates and 
intervention costs from the trial. Cost per extra QALY and cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curves were generated from the perspective of NHS England, with a 
5-year time horizon.
RESULTS: The PINCER intervention generated £2,679 less cost and 0.81 more QALYs 
per practice [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER): -£3,037 per QALY] in 
the deterministic analysis. In the probabilistic analysis, PINCER generated 
0.001 extra QALYs per practice compared with simple feedback, at £4.20 less per 
practice. Despite this extremely small set of differences in costs and outcomes, 
PINCER dominated simple feedback with a mean ICER of -£3,936 (standard error 
£2,970). At a ceiling 'willingness-to-pay' of £20,000/QALY, PINCER reaches 59 % 
probability of being cost effective.
CONCLUSIONS: PINCER produced marginal health gain at slightly reduced overall 
cost. Results are uncertain due to the poor quality of data to inform the effect 
of avoiding errors.

The Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health (MLSFH) is one of very few 
long-standing, publicly available longitudinal cohort studies in a sub-Saharan 
African (SSA) context. It provides a rare record of more than a decade of 
demographic, socioeconomic and health conditions in one of the world's poorest 
countries. The MLSFH was initially established in 1998 to study social network 
influences on fertility behaviours and HIV risk perceptions, and over time the 
focus of the study expanded to include health, sexual behaviours, 
intergenerational relations and family/household dynamics. The currently 
available data include MLSFH rounds collected in 1998, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 
2010 and 2012 for up to 4000 individuals, providing information about 
socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, sexual behaviours, marriage, 
household/family structure, risk perceptions, social networks and social 
capital, intergenerational relations, HIV/AIDS and other dimensions of health. 
The MLSFH public use data can be requested on the project website:

Calorie restriction (CR) is an intervention extending the life spans of many 
organisms. The mechanisms underlying CR-dependent retardation of aging are still 
poorly understood. Despite mechanisms involving conserved nutrient signaling 
pathways proposed, few target processes that can account for CR-mediated 
longevity have so far been identified. Recently, both peroxiredoxins and 
vacuolar-ATPases were reported to control CR-mediated retardation of aging 
downstream of conserved nutrient signaling pathways. In this review, we focus on 
peroxiredoxin-mediated stress-defence and vacuolar-ATPase regulated 
acidification and pinpoint common denominators between the two mechanisms 
proposed for how CR extends life span. Both the activities of peroxiredoxins and 
vacuolar-ATPases are stimulated upon CR through reduced activities in conserved 
nutrient signaling pathways and both seem to stimulate cellular resistance to 
peroxide-stress. However, whereas vacuolar-ATPases have recently been suggested 
to control both Ras-cAMP-PKA- and TORC1-mediated nutrient signaling, neither the 
physiological benefits of a proposed role for peroxiredoxins in H2O2-signaling 
nor downstream targets regulated are known. Both peroxiredoxins and 
vacuolar-ATPases do, however, impinge on mitochondrial iron-metabolism and 
further characterization of their impact on iron homeostasis and 
peroxide-resistance might therefore increase our understanding of the beneficial 
effects of CR on aging and age-related diseases.

BACKGROUND: The National Lung Screening Trial demonstrated that screening for 
lung cancer improved overall survival (OS) and reduced lung cancer mortality in 
the 55- to 74-year-old age group by increasing the proportion of cancers 
detected at an early stage. Because of the increasing life expectancy of the 
American population, we investigated whether screening for lung cancer might 
benefit men and women aged 75-84 years.
MATERIALS/METHODS: Rates of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from 2000 to 2009 
were calculated in both younger and older age groups using the surveillance 
epidemiology and end reporting database. OS and lung cancer-specific survival 
(LCSS) in patients with Stage I NSCLC diagnosed from 2004 to 2009 were analyzed 
to determine the effects of age and treatment.
RESULTS: The per capita incidence of NSCLC decreased in the 55-74 cohort, but 
increased in the 75-84 cohort over the study period. Crude lung cancer death 
rates in the two age groups who had no specific treatment were 39.5 and 44.9%, 
respectively. These rates fell in both age groups when increasingly aggressive 
treatment was used. Rates of OS and LCSS improved significantly with 
increasingly aggressive treatment in the 75-84 age group. The survival benefits 
of increasingly aggressive treatment in 75- to 84-year-old females did not 
differ from their counterparts in the younger cohort.
CONCLUSION: Screening for lung cancer might be of benefit to individuals at 
increased risk of lung cancer in the 75-84 age group. The survival benefits of 
aggressive therapy are similar in females between 55-74 and 75-84 years old.

[The number of life years lost (DALYs) due to premature mortality in the 
population of Tomsk region in 2012].

[Article in Russian]

AIM: To calculate the index of years of life lost population due to premature 
death in the Tomsk region in 2012, and the contribution of various groups of 
diseases in the total indicator DALY among males and females.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the calculation of DALY used the number and the gender 
and age structure of the population of Tomsk region by 01.01.2012, according to 
Rosstat. To conduct the calculation of DALY used the methodology presented by 
the world Bank in the report "Investing in health" in 1993 According to the 
methodology, the DALY is the number of years of life of the population, lived 
with disability or other health problems, and lost due to premature death.
RESULTS: The total loss of DALYs in the Tomsk region by the end of 2012 amounted 
112,3, per 1000 population (11.6 +/- 8.9). In the structure of DALYs by cause of 
death 1st place is occupied by diseases of the circulatory system, 2nd injury 
and poisoning, 3rd neoplasms.
CONCLUSIONS: The indicator DALY in the Tomsk region are significantly lower than 
the Russian Federation as a whole (according to S.A. Leonov--1.25 times, 
according to G. Yang--2 times). The relatively low level of DALYs in the Tomsk 
region is associated with favourable compared with other regions of the age 
structure (younger populations). It should also be noted that more than 70% of 
population live in urban areas, where, as is known, the availability of medical 
care are higher than in rural.

[Which patients with ovarian cancer shows the combination of trabectedin with 
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin].

[Article in Russian]

Khokhlova SV, Cherkasova MV, Orel NF, Limareva SV, Bazaeva IIa, Gorbunova VA.

Given the high rate of recurrence of ovarian cancer, the search for new 
therapeutic strategies are topical issue. According to various studies the 
effectiveness of drug treatment relapse depends on the platinum-free interval, 
increasing in proportion to its duration. If therapy is platinum-resistant 
recurrent ovarian cancer is a standard approach, the treatment of 
platinum-sensitive recurrent algorithm is not fully defined. Comparison of 
platinum and non-platinum combinations revealed the advantage of combined 
platinum- treatment for patients with platinum-free interval of more than 6 
months without an increase in life expectancy. Non-platinum combination of 
trabected in with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin has shown comparable efficacy 
with an advantage in overall survival in patients with platinum-free interval of 
6-12 months. A platinum-free interval prolongation by the use of non-platinum 
mode increases the efficiency of subsequent platinum-based therapy, increasing 
the life expectancy of patients. Currently under study molecular markers and 
prognostic factors allowing to define a group of patients who have the greatest 
benefit from the use trabectedin with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin as 
second-line chemotherapy.

Fabry's disease--a comprehensive review on pathogenesis, diagnosis and 
treatment.

Mahmud HM.

Fabry's is a progressive, destructive and life threatening disease which reduces 
significantly life expectancy of the affected individual. It is a genetic 
disorder of X-linked inheritance caused by deficiency of lysosomal enzyme 
alpha-galactosidase A resulting in progressive accumulation of 
glycosphingolipids within different body cells. Fabry's deposits are defined 
histopathologically as lamellate membrane like structure called myeloid or Zebra 
bodies. Clinical manifestations of disease are hypohidrosis, acroparesthesias, 
heat intolerance, angiokeratomas, corneal opacities, cardiac arrhythmias, left 
ventricular hypertrophy, proteinuria, renal insufficiency and cerebrovascular 
accidents. Diagnosis of Fabry's need a high clinical suspicion, good physical 
examination, organ specific tests and is confirmed by demonstrating low enzyme 
assays in homozygous males and gene typing in heterozygous females. Specific 
therapy for Fabry's disease is enzyme replacement with recombinant human 
alpha-galactosidase A. If started early it has a promising role in renal and 
cardiac disease however beneficial role is not yet defined in CNS involvement.

Can we say what diet is best for health?

Katz DL(1), Meller S.

Hospital, Derby, Connecticut 06418; email: david.katz@yale.edu.

Diet is established among the most important influences on health in modern 
societies. Injudicious diet figures among the leading causes of premature death 
and chronic disease. Optimal eating is associated with increased life 
expectancy, dramatic reduction in lifetime risk of all chronic disease, and 
amelioration of gene expression. In this context, claims abound for the 
competitive merits of various diets relative to one another. Whereas such 
claims, particularly when attached to commercial interests, emphasize 
distinctions, the fundamentals of virtually all eating patterns associated with 
meaningful evidence of health benefit overlap substantially. There have been no 
rigorous, long-term studies comparing contenders for best diet laurels using 
methodology that precludes bias and confounding, and for many reasons such 
studies are unlikely. In the absence of such direct comparisons, claims for the 
established superiority of any one specific diet over others are exaggerated. 
The weight of evidence strongly supports a theme of healthful eating while 
allowing for variations on that theme. A diet of minimally processed foods close 
to nature, predominantly plants, is decisively associated with health promotion 
and disease prevention and is consistent with the salient components of 
seemingly distinct dietary approaches. Efforts to improve public health through 
diet are forestalled not for want of knowledge about the optimal feeding of Homo 
sapiens but for distractions associated with exaggerated claims, and our failure 
to convert what we reliably know into what we routinely do. Knowledge in this 
case is not, as of yet, power; would that it were so.

In the Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA) done as part of the Global Burden of 
Disease project (GBD-2010), the global and regional burdens of household air 
pollution (HAP) due to the use of solid cookfuels, were estimated along with 60+ 
other risk factors. This article describes how the HAP CRA was framed; how 
global HAP exposures were modeled; how diseases were judged to have sufficient 
evidence for inclusion; and how meta-analyses and exposure-response modeling 
were done to estimate relative risks. We explore relationships with the other 
air pollution risk factors: ambient air pollution, smoking, and secondhand 
smoke. We conclude with sensitivity analyses to illustrate some of the major 
uncertainties and recommendations for future work. We estimate that in 2010 HAP 
was responsible for 3.9 million premature deaths and ∼4.8% of lost healthy life 
years (DALYs), ranking it highest among environmental risk factors examined and 
one of the major risk factors of any type globally.

PURPOSE: Compared to T1a lesions the natural history of untreated renal masses 
larger than 4 cm is poorly understood. We assessed the growth kinetics and 
outcomes of cT1b/T2 cortical renal tumors managed by an initial period of active 
surveillance. We compared these cases to those treated with definitive delayed 
intervention.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed our institutional, prospectively maintained 
renal tumor database to identify enhancing solid and cystic masses managed 
expectantly. Included in analysis were clinically localized tumors greater than 
4.0 cm (T1b or greater) that were radiographically followed for more than 6 
months. Tumor size at presentation, annual linear tumor growth rate, Charlson 
comorbidity index, followup and clinical outcomes were compared in patients who 
remained on active surveillance and those who underwent delayed surgical 
intervention.
RESULTS: We identified 72 tumors 4 cm or greater in diameter in a total of 
68 patients. Active surveillance was the only treatment in 45 patients (66%) 
while 23 (34%) progressed to intervention. Median tumor size at presentation was 
4.9 cm and the mean linear growth rate was 0.44 cm per year. Of the masses 14.7% 
demonstrated no growth with time. Comparing patients treated exclusively with 
active surveillance and those who progressed to definitive intervention revealed 
no difference in median tumor size at presentation (4.9 vs 4.6 cm, p = 0.79) or 
the median Charlson comorbidity index (3 vs 2, p = 0.6) but significant 
differences were seen in median age at presentation (77 vs 60 years, p = 0.0002) 
and the mean linear growth rate (0.37 vs 0.73 cm per year, p = 0.02). After 
adjustment younger patients (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.97) and tumors with a faster 
linear growth rate (OR 9.1, 95% CI 1.7-47.8) were more likely to be treated with 
delayed surgical intervention. At a mean ± SD 38.9 ± 24.0 months of followup 
(median 32, range 6 to 105) 9 patients (13%) had died of another cause and none 
had progressed to metastatic disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Localized cT1b or larger renal masses show growth rates comparable 
to those of small tumors managed expectantly with a low rate of progression to 
metastatic disease at short-term followup. An initial period of active 
surveillance to determine tumor growth kinetics is a reasonable option in select 
patients with significant competing risks and limited life expectancy.

Social capital has been found to be correlated with community welfare, but it is 
not easy to build and maintain it. The purpose of the current study is to 
investigate the role of professional coordinators of social relationships to 
create and maintain social capital in a community. We focused on extension 
officers in Japanese agricultural communities, who help farmers in both 
technical and social matters. A large nation-wide survey of extension officers 
as well as two supplementary surveys were conducted. We found that (1) social 
capital-related activities (e.g., assistance for building organizations among 
farmers) were particularly effective for solving problems; (2) social capital 
(trust relationships) among community residents increased their life quality; 
(3) social capital in local communities was correlated with extension officers' 
own communication skills and harmonious relationships among their colleagues. In 
sum, social capital in local communities is maintained by coordinators with 
professional social skills.

Kinematic behaviour and soft tissue management in guided motion total knee 
replacement.

College London, London, UK, c.halewood@imperial.ac.uk.

PURPOSE: Dissatisfaction after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may be caused by 
abnormal knee kinematics, and there is concern that 'guided motion' TKAs, 
designed to replicate normal knee kinematics, cause anterolateral knee pain due 
to stretching of soft tissues. It was hypothesised that excessive tibial 
internal rotation and femoral rollback during flexion were to blame.
METHODS: Eighteen fresh-frozen specimens were used in two studies. The first 
study used a knee extension rig and transducers to measure ligament length 
changes during flexion. The second study used a knee flexion rig and optical 
trackers to measure tibiofemoral kinematics. Both experiments used the intact 
knee and were repeated with three TKAs: two guided motion (Journey and Journey 
II) and a conventional Genesis II PS TKA.
RESULTS: TKA did not cause significant elongation of any of the ligaments 
examined. The medial patellofemoral ligament and the medial collateral ligament 
tended to be slacker post-TKA, and all three TKAs caused some tightening of the 
superficial iliotibial band, but these changes were not significant. Normal knee 
kinematics was not restored by any of the devices. The screw-home mechanism was 
absent in all three TKAs; anterior laxity was increased in all three devices up 
to 90° flexion, but tibial internal rotation was not increased. The conventional 
TKA allowed significantly greater anterior laxity than normal, while the Journey 
I caused greater tibial anterior translation in flexion.
CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that over-internal rotation and rollback in the 
original guided motion knee caused excessive tightening in the soft tissues 
around the knee was supported; the updated design reduced that tendency. If 
similar changes occur during real-life activities, these results imply a 
potential reduction in the incidence of anterolateral knee pain clinically in 
patients with a guided motion TKA.

Examining associations between cognitive-affective vulnerability and HIV symptom 
severity, perceived barriers to treatment adherence, and viral load among 
HIV-positive adults.

Tillett Hall, 53 Avenue E, Piscataway, NJ, 08853, USA, Teresa.leyro@rutgers.edu.

BACKGROUND: Little research on symptom impairment and quality of life among 
HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals has attended to the potential role of 
cognitive-affective vulnerabilities. Emerging research indicates that emotion 
regulation (ER), anxiety sensitivity (AS), and distress tolerance (DT) are 
associated with a range of mental health outcomes and demonstrate meaningful 
relations to clinical outcomes in HIV+ individuals.
PURPOSE: In this investigation, we sought to concurrently examine these factors 
in relation HIV symptom severity, barriers to medication adherence, and disease 
viral load.
METHOD: Participants were 139 HIV+ individuals (34 female; age M = 48.2 years, 
SD = 8.1, 42% Black) receiving outpatient HIV care and prescribed at least one 
antiretroviral medication. We used hierarchical regression analyses to 
concurrently examine ER, AS, and DT in relation to severity of HIV symptoms, 
barriers to medication adherence, and disease viral load.
RESULTS: After accounting for alcohol use problems, cannabis dependence, gender, 
and education, AS was significantly associated with HIV symptom severity 
(β = .35, p < .01) whereas ER evidenced a trend relation (β = .19, p = .07). ER 
(β = .45, p < .01), but not AS or DT, was significantly related to barriers to 
medication adherence, above and beyond variance accounted for by covariates. 
Finally, ER evidenced a trend level relation to viral load (β = .21, p = .07), 
above and beyond variance accounted for by cannabis use.
CONCLUSION: Findings provide an extension of previous research, suggesting 
unique roles of cognitive-affective vulnerabilities in terms of HIV symptom 
severity, medication use barriers, and infection symptomatology, and inform the 
refinement of current treatments for HIV+ individuals so as to improve 
functioning.

INTRODUCTION: The Gold Standard Frameworks (GSF) Committee devised Prognostic 
Indicator Guidance in November 2007 to 'aid identification of adult patients 
with advanced disease, in the last months or year of life, who are in need of 
supportive or palliative care'.
METHODS: This research used the GSF `surprise question' to formulate a list of 
patients predicted to die within 1 year with end stage renal failure and to 
establish the specificity and sensitivity of this register.
RESULTS: 58 patients were added to the list during the follow-up period of which 
28 (48.3%) died during the same period giving an annual mortality of 32.2%. In 
comparison with the patients who died during the follow-up period but were not 
added to the at-risk register, those on the register had a much higher mortality 
rate (32.2% vs 7.8%). Identification of patients with chronic kidney disease and 
reduced life expectancy by this method appears to have a high sensitivity 
(66.7%) and specificity (77.9%). In particular, the negative predictive value 
for mortality for those on the at-risk register appears to be very high (88.3%), 
indicating the very low mortality among those not on the register.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic kidney disease and a reduced life expectancy 
can be accurately identified by a multi-disciplinary team using the surprise 
trigger question with a relatively high sensitivity and specificity. The 
accurate identification of patients with reduced life expectancy allows 
appropriate end of life care planning to begin in keeping with patients' wishes 
and within published guidelines.
