BACKGROUND: This study provides a cost-effectiveness analysis of therapeutic 
strategies for chronic hepatitis C genotype 3 infected patients in Spain.
METHODS: A Markov model was designed to simulate the progression in a cohort of 
patients aged 50 years over a lifetime horizon.
RESULTS: Sofosbuvir (SOF) plus peginterferon and ribavirin for 12 weeks was a 
cost-effective option when compared to standard of care (SoC) in the treatment 
of both 'moderate fibrosis' and 'cirrhotic' patients. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were €35,276/QALY and €18,374/QALY respectively. ICERs 
for SOF plus daclatasvir (DCV) regimens versus SoC were over the threshold limit 
considered, at €56,178/QALY and €77,378/QALY for 'moderate fibrosis' and 
'cirrhotic' patients respectively.
CONCLUSION: Addition of SOF to IFN-based regimens for genotype 3 was 
cost-effective for both 'moderate fibrosis' and 'cirrhotic' patients. IFN-free 
options including SOF and DCV association required price reductions lower than 
the list prices to be considered cost-effective.

INTRODUCTION: A number of drugs have been shown to extend life expectancy in 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Skeletal related events (SREs) 
secondary to bone metastases cause significant morbidity for men with CRPC. The 
α-emitting radiopharmaceutical radium-223 dichloride has been shown to improve 
overall survival, time to symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs) and quality of life 
in CRPC.
AREAS COVERED: The development of radium-223 from pre-clinical studies to the 
evidence of efficacy and safety from a phase 3 trial is discussed as well as its 
pharmacokinetics and metabolism. The integration of radium-223 into routine care 
for patients with advanced prostate cancer is included including a comparison 
with other agents in this setting. Expert commentary: The risk/benefit ratio for 
radium-223 is very similar to that of other agents used in the CRPC setting and 
is a treatment option for men unsuitable for cytotoxic chemotherapy because of 
comorbidities. The ALSYMPCA trial demonstrated an improvement in SSEs with 
radium-223. This is a clinically relevant end-point as not all 
radiologically-detected SREs are apparent to patients. The correct sequencing of 
the life-prolonging treatments available to men with CRPC is subject to debate. 
Radium-223 therapy should be considered before the development of visceral 
metastases. Drug-combination studies are underway.

BACKGROUND: Primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (PCMZL) has rarely 
been reported in patients younger than 20 years.
OBJECTIVES: To report our experience with PCMZL in the paediatric/adolescent age 
group.
METHODS: Medical records of patients diagnosed with PCMZL before age 20 years 
and managed at two cutaneous lymphoma clinics in the U.S.A. and Israel from 1992 
to 2015 were reviewed.
RESULTS: The study group included 11 patients (six girls; median age 16 years, 
range 6-19·5); 10 had generalized/multifocal (T3) and one had regional/localized 
(T2) disease. Lesions were located on the limbs in all patients and the trunk in 
six; two had facial lesions. Staging in all but one was based on whole-body 
computed tomography or positron emission tomography. Initial management in most 
patients included nonradiation modalities: one patient with localized disease 
received intralesional steroids; six patients with multifocal disease received 
the following: topical/intralesional steroids (n = 3); excision (n = 2); 'watch 
and wait' (n = 1). No extracutaneous progression was noted during a median 
follow-up of 5·5 years (mean 7·5, range 0·5-14). At present, five patients are 
in complete remission.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our data (largest series in the literature with the 
longest follow-up), the clinicopathological presentation and course of PCMZL in 
the paediatric/adolescent age group are similar to those in adults. Given the 
indolent course and the long life expectancy of these young patients, the 
cumulative risk of imaging studies and the age-related potential toxicity of 
treatment, especially radiation, should be taken into consideration.

Older persons' experiences of what influences their vitality - a study of 65- 
and 75-year-olds in Finland and Sweden.

Throughout the world, life expectancy has noticeably increased during the past 
decade, and health promotive initiatives for older persons will therefore become 
ever more important. During the past few years, interest in what constitutes the 
source of health for human beings has markedly increased in health science 
research. An interesting and relatively unresearched domain is what provides 
older persons the strength and energy to look forward and what positively or 
negatively influences older persons' vitality. The aim of the study was to 
explore and describe older persons' vitality and their subjective experiences of 
what influences their vitality, despite disease and suffering. The study has an 
explorative and descriptive design. A comprehensive questionnaire including two 
open-ended questions about vitality was sent to 4927 older persons aged 65 and 
75, and a total of 2579 responded to the open-ended questions. Qualitative 
content analyses were used. A safe and confirming communion, meaningful 
activities, an optimal state of health and an inner strength were important 
sources of vitality. Ageing that includes illness or a restricted life, 
happenings in the world and in one's close environment that threaten inner 
meaningfulness, and mental burdens that give rise to a feeling of hopelessness 
or depression decrease vitality. Vitality is an important health resource for 
65- and 75-year-olds in that it influences a person's longing for life, love and 
meaning. Accordingly, it is of fundamental importance that Registered Nurses and 
other healthcare personnel strengthen older persons' vitality during the ageing 
process. By taking into consideration that which positively vs. negatively 
affects the vitality of each unique person, healthcare personnel can strengthen 
each older person's health resources and attempt to minimise and limit what 
negatively influences said person's vitality.

Geriatric periodontology: how the need to care for the aging population can 
influence the future of the dental profession.

Lamster IB.

The world's population is aging, and it has been estimated that by 2050, the 
number of people 65 years of age and older will reach 1.5 billion. The aging 
population will be affected by noncommunicable chronic diseases, including 
diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment. This 
important demographic shift includes a reduction in tooth loss/edentulism, 
particularly in older adults of the developed countries in North America, 
western Europe and north-east Asia. Therefore, in the future, dental providers 
will be required to care for an expanded number of older adults who have 
retained teeth and are medically complex. As the linkage of oral disease and 
systemic disease has focused on the relationship of periodontitis and 
noncommunicable chronic diseases, a broad review of 'geriatric periodontology' 
is both timely and important. This volume of Periodontology 2000 covers a range 
of subjects under this heading. Included are the demographics of an aging world; 
the effect of aging on stem cell function in the periodontium; the periodontal 
microbiota associated with aging; the host response in the periodontium of aging 
individuals; an analysis of the prevalence of periodontitis in the USA on a 
national, state-wide and community basis; differentiation of physiologic oral 
aging from disease; treatment of periodontal disease in older adults; implant 
therapy for older patients; oral disease and the frailty syndrome; the 
relationship of tooth loss to longevity and life expectancy; and the 
relationship of periodontal disease to noncommunicable chronic diseases. 
Although 'geriatric dentistry' is not a recognized specialty in dentistry, and 
'geriatric periodontology' is a descriptive title, the subject of this volume of 
Periodontology 2000 is critical to the future of clinical dentistry, dental 
public health and dental research. Any comprehensive focus on older patients can 
only be accomplished with an emphasis on interprofessional education and 
practice. If embraced, this shift will allow the dental profession to be more 
closely aligned with the larger health-care environment, and can improve both 
oral health and health outcomes for patients seen in the dental office.

Tooth loss as a predictor of shortened longevity: exploring the hypothesis.

Friedman PK, Lamster IB.

Many factors contribute to human tooth loss, including oral hygiene practices, 
trauma, smoking, health status, socio-economic status and individual 
preferences. Loss of teeth impairs quality-of-life measures, including the 
eating of most foods that require full masticatory function. A recent study of 
centenarians found that at age 65-74 years, those who lived to be 100 had a 
lower rate of edentulism than did younger members of their birth cohort at ages 
65-74 years. Oral health was consistent with compression of morbidity toward the 
end of life. This article explores the hypothesis that factors associated with 
oral disease and noncommunicable diseases may increase the risk of tooth loss 
and lead to diminished longevity as a result of multifactorial interactions. It 
specifically addresses two critical questions. The first is: 'Can we conclude 
that the number of teeth in aging humans can affect longevity and life 
expectancy?' The answer is yes. The second is: 'Is tooth loss a predictor of 
shortened longevity?' Again, the answer is yes. Edentulism and partial 
edentulism are discussed as a disability, and how the philosophy/belief systems 
of dental providers and patients toward retaining teeth influences the outcome 
of tooth loss is also examined. Osteoporosis and cognitive impairment provide 
examples of modifying risk factors.

BACKGROUND: Fragility fractures are a major health care problem worldwide. Both 
hip and non-hip fractures are associated with excess mortality in the years 
following the fracture. Residents of long-term nursing homes represent a special 
high-risk group for poor outcomes. Orthogeriatric co-management models of care 
have shown in multiple studies to have medical as well as economic advantages, 
but their impact on this high-risk group has not been well studied.
OBJECTIVE: We studied the outcome of long-term care residents with hip and 
non-hip fractures admitted to a geriatric fracture center.
METHODS: The study design is a single center, prospective cohort study at a 
level-I trauma center in Austria running a geriatric fracture center. The cohort 
included all fragility fracture patients aged over 70 admitted from a long-term 
care residence from May 2009 to November 2011. The data set consisted of 265 
patients; the mean age was 86.8 ± 6.7 years, and 80 % were female. The mean 
follow-up after the index fracture was 789 days, with a range from 1 to 
1842 days. Basic clinical and demographic data were collected at hospital 
admission. Functional status and mobility were assessed during follow-up at 3, 
6, and 12 months. Additional outcome data regarding readmissions for new 
fractures were obtained from the hospital information database; mortality was 
crosschecked with the death registry from the governmental institute of 
epidemiology.
RESULTS: 187 (70.6 %) patients died during the follow-up period, with 78 
patients (29.4 %) dying in the first year. The mean life expectancy after the 
index fracture was 527 (±431) days. Differences in mortality rates between hip 
and non-hip fracture patients were not statistically significant. Compared to 
reported mortality rates in the literature, hip fracture patients in this 
orthogeriatric-comanaged cohort had a significantly reduced one-year mortality 
[OR of 0.57 (95 % CI 0.31-0.85)]. After adjustment for confounders, only older 
age (OR 1.091; p = 0.013; CI 1.019-1.169) and a lower Parker Mobility Scale 
(PMS) (OR 0.737; p = 0.022; CI 0.568-0.957) remained as independent predictors. 
During follow-up, 62 patients (23.4 %) sustained at least one subsequent 
fracture, and 10 patients (3.4 %) experienced multiple fractures; 29 patients 
(10.9 %) experienced an additional fracture within the first year. Nearly, half 
(47.1 %) regained their pre-fracture mobility based on the PMS.
CONCLUSION: Despite the generally poor outcomes for fragility fracture patients 
residing in long-term care facilities, orthogeriatric co-management appears to 
improve the outcome of high-risk fragility fracture patients. One-year mortality 
was 29.4 % in this cohort, significantly lower than in comparable trials. 
Orthogeriatric co-management may also have positive impacts on both functional 
outcome and the risk of subsequent fractures.

An approximate likelihood approach is developed for regression analysis of 
censored competing-risks data. This approach models directly the cumulative 
incidence function, instead of the cause-specific hazard function, in terms of 
explanatory covariates under a proportional subdistribution hazards assumption. 
It uses a self-consistent iterative procedure to maximize an approximate 
semiparametric likelihood function, leading to an asymptotically normal and 
efficient estimator of the vector of regression parameters. Simulation studies 
demonstrate its advantages over previous methods.

BACKGROUND: Patients with phlegmonous appendicitis can be managed 
nonoperatively, yet debate continues about the need for interval appendectomy 
(IA), given the low risk of recurrence or neoplasm. We sought to determine for 
which patient age interval appendectomy is cost-effective.
METHODS: Using TreeAge software, a cost-effectiveness model was developed. Two 
strategies were compared, IA and no interval appendectomy (NIA). Interval 
appendectomy patients were modeled with probability of benign pathology, cancer 
or inflammatory bowel disease, and possible operative complications. Patients 
with NIA were modeled with the probability of recurrence. The probability of 
malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease developing, or death occurring during a 
lifetime, was modeled. Base case scenarios at 18, 35, and 50 years old were 
completed using a Monte Carlo microsimulation. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis was completed using 2-dimensional sample as a Monte Carlo 
microsimulation to account for variability for patients 18 to 60 years old. 
Probabilities of complications developing, pathologic diagnosis requiring 
additional management, and state utility were extracted from published data. 
Costs were collected from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and 
utility was quality-adjusted life years (QALY).
RESULTS: For an 18-year-old patient, IA costs $9,417.22 with a gain of 16.59 
QALYs compared with NIA, which costs $11,613.57 with a gain of 16.52 QALYs. For 
a 35-year-old, IA costs $8,989.16 with 9.1 QALYs gained. No interval 
appendectomy costs $6,614.61 and 9.09 QALYs gained. For the 35-year-old patient, 
the interval cost-effectiveness ratio comparing NIA with IA is $237,455/QALY. As 
patient age increases, the interval cost-effectiveness ratio increases. Using a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, IA remains cost-effective until 
the patient is 33 years old.
CONCLUSIONS: Interval appendectomy should be considered in patients younger than 
34 years of age.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to critically review the literature on the 
cost effectiveness of cancer screening interventions, and examine the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) that may influence government 
recommendations on cancer screening strategies and funding for mass 
implementation in the Hong Kong healthcare system.
METHODS: We conducted a literature review of cost-effectiveness studies in the 
Hong Kong population related to cancer screening published up to 2015, through a 
hand search and database search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and OVID 
Medline. Binary data on the government's decisions were obtained from the Cancer 
Expert Working Group, Department of Health. Mixed-effect logistic regression 
analysis was used to examine the impact of ICERs on decision making. Using 
Youden's index, an optimal ICER threshold value for positive decisions was 
examined by area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Eight studies reporting 30 cost-effectiveness pairwise comparisons of 
population-based cancer screening were identified. Most studies reported an ICER 
for a cancer screening strategy versus a comparator with outcomes in terms of 
cost per life-years (55.6 %), or cost per quality-adjusted life-years (55.6 %). 
Among comparisons with a mean ICER of US$102,931 (range 800-715,137), the 
increase in ICER value by 1000 was associated with decreased odds (odds ratio 
0.990, 0.981-0.999; p = 0.033) of a positive recommendation. An optimal ICER 
value of US$61,600 per effectiveness unit yielded a high sensitivity of 90 % and 
specificity of 85 % for a positive recommendation. A lower ICER threshold value 
of below US$8044 per effectiveness unit was detected for a positive funding 
decision.
CONCLUSIONS: Linking published evidence to Government recommendations and 
practice on cancer screening, ICERs influence decisions on the adoption of 
health technologies in Hong Kong. The potential ICER threshold for 
recommendation in Hong Kong may be higher than those of developed countries.

Thalassemia-associated osteoporosis constitutes a major complication in patients 
with thalassemia. This review presents the existing studies on the treatment of 
thalassemia-associated osteoporosis and discusses the management of this 
debilitating complication. A brief presentation of the disease characteristics 
and pathogenetic mechanisms is also provided. The life expectancy of patients 
with thalassemia has increased markedly in recent years resulting in the aging 
of the population and the emergence of new comorbidities. The majority of 
patients with thalassemia have low bone mineral density and experience lifelong 
fracture rates as high as 71 %. The pathogenesis of thalassemia-associated 
osteoporosis (TAO) is multifactorial with anemia and iron overload playing 
crucial role in its development. Data concerning the prevention and treatment of 
TAO are extremely limited. We performed a literature research in Pubmed and 
Scopus to identify interventional studies evaluating the effects of various 
agents on TAO. Seventeen studies were retrieved. We present the results of these 
studies as well as a brief overview of TAO including presentation, pathogenesis, 
and management. Most of the studies identified are of poor quality, are not 
randomized controlled, and include small number of participants. There are no 
data concerning effects on fracture rates. Bisphosphonates are the most widely 
studied agents and among them zoledronic acid is the most well studied. Hormone 
replacement treatment (HRT) shows beneficial but small effects. Denosumab and 
strontium ranelate have each been evaluated in only a single study, while there 
are no data about the effects of anabolic agents. Given the increased life 
expectancy and the increase in fracture rates with age, more data about the 
management of TAO are warranted. Moreover, due to the need for lifelong 
management starting at young age, careful treatment plans which may include 
sequential treatment may often be required. However, currently, there are no 
relevant data available.

Understanding long-range trends in longevity and disability is useful for 
projecting the likely impact of the baby-boom generation on long-term care 
utilization and spending. We examine changes in active life expectancy in the 
United States from 1982 to 2011 for white and black adults ages sixty-five and 
older. For whites, longevity increased, disability was postponed to older ages, 
the locus of care shifted from nursing facilities to community settings, and the 
proportion of life at older ages spent without disability increased. In 
contrast, for blacks, longevity increases were accompanied by smaller 
postponements in disability, and the percentage of remaining life spent active 
remained stable and well below that of whites. Older black women were especially 
disadvantaged in 2011 in terms of the proportion of years expected to be lived 
without disability. Public health measures directed at older black 
adults-particularly women-are needed to offset impending pressures on the 
long-term care delivery system as the result of population aging.

INTRODUCTION: The desire of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to have children 
can have significant public health implications. Combination Antiretroviral 
Therapy (cART) has increased the life expectancy of PLWHA as a result of which 
they may consider child bearing. There are hardly any studies from India 
addressing the fertility desires among PLWHA.
AIM: This study was done to assess the fertility desires of PLWHA in Southern 
India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study conducted among 230 
HIV-positive men and women who presented to Kasturba Medical College (KMC), 
Mangalore, India. Study was conducted between October 2012 and October 2014. 
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 11.5. Chi-square 
test, Fisher's exact test and student t-test was used to find out the 
association of various factors affecting fertility desire. A p-value of less 
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The mean age of our study population was 36.3±5.5 years. The mean age 
of males was 37.3±6 years and for female 34.9±5 years. In our study 132 (57.4%) 
were males. Majority were literate 229 (99%). Majority of patients were employed 
166 (72%). In our study 195 (84.7%) were on cART. Out of 230 PLWHA 39 (16.95%) 
were unmarried and 151(65.5%) married PLHIV were living with partners at the 
time of study. In our study 77 (33.5%) patients had fertility desire. Age, 
gender, marital status, number of children, partner's fertility desire and HIV 
status of partner had an association with fertility desire.
CONCLUSION: Providing universal access to cART is the main aim of national 
programs. It is high time that these programs focus on fertility issues of 
PLWHA. Reproductive rights of PLWHA need to be respected. Physicians and HIV 
counselors should proactively discuss and address reproductive issues of PLWHA.

BACKGROUND: The post-surgical history of repaired congenital heart disease 
(rCHD), in particular tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), is often complicated by sudden 
death. Electrical myocardial abnormalities could be a substrate for malignant 
ventricular arrhythmias.
METHODS AND RESULTS: 146 patients with TOF or other rCHD involving a 
subpulmonary right ventricle, considered to be at high arrhythmic risk, 
underwent right ventricular (RV) electroanatomic voltage mapping (EVM). Maps 
showed endocardial scars (<0.5mV) in all cases, mainly involving the RV outflow 
tract (n=141, 96.6%). In 28 cases (19.2%), other areas were involved. Total scar 
extension, expressed as % of total endocardial area, was significantly higher in 
patients with QRS ≥180ms [4.5% (±2.5) vs 2.8% (±2.4), p=0.014], left and right 
ventricular systolic dysfunction [4.5% (±3.2) vs 2.8% (±2.3), p=0.016 and 3.5% 
(±3.0) vs 2.6% (±1.9), p=0.03, respectively], premature ventricular contractions 
(PVCs) [3.2% (±2.6) vs 2.2% (±1.8), p<0.05], exercise-induced PVCs [3.8% (±2.4) 
vs 2.6% (±2.2), p=0.01], previous shunt [4.0% (±2.7) vs 2.6% (±2.2), p=0.01] and 
reintervention [4.2% (±3.2) vs 2.6% (±2.0), p=0.008]. Scar size also showed a 
positive correlation with duration of post-surgical follow-up (ρ=0.01), age at 
correction (ρ=0.01) and absolute QRS duration (ρ=0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with rCHD involving the right ventricle show electrical 
scars with variable distribution, not necessarily matching with sites of 
surgical lesions. Scar extension correlates with some of the risk factors for 
life-threatening arrhythmias in CHD, such as prolonged QRS. Thus EVM could be 
considered an additional tool in the assessment of risk stratification in this 
particular population.

INTRODUCTION: The number of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients is increasing with 
increased life expectancy and 115.4 million people are expected to be affected 
in 2050. Unfortunately, AD is commonly diagnosed too late, when irreversible 
damages have been caused in the patient.
OBJECTIVE: An automatic, continuous and unobtrusive early AD detection method 
would be required to improve patients' life quality and avoid big healthcare 
costs. Thus, the objective of this survey is to review the multimodal signals 
that could be used in the development of such a system, emphasizing on the 
accuracy that they have shown up to date for AD detection. Some useful tools and 
specific issues towards this goal will also have to be reviewed.
METHODS: An extensive literature review was performed following a specific 
search strategy, inclusion criteria, data extraction and quality assessment in 
the Inspec, Compendex and PubMed databases.
RESULTS: This work reviews the extensive list of psychological, physiological, 
behavioural and cognitive measurements that could be used for AD detection. The 
most promising measurements seem to be magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for AD 
vs control (CTL) discrimination with an 98.95% accuracy, while 
electroencephalogram (EEG) shows the best results for mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) vs CTL (97.88%) and MCI vs AD distinction (94.05%). Available 
physiological and behavioural AD datasets are listed, as well as medical imaging 
analysis steps and neuroimaging processing toolboxes. Some issues such as "label 
noise" and multi-site data are discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of an unobtrusive and transparent AD detection 
system should be based on a multimodal system in order to take full advantage of 
all kinds of symptoms, detect even the smallest changes and combine them, so as 
to detect AD as early as possible. Such a multimodal system might probably be 
based on physiological monitoring of MRI or EEG, as well as behavioural 
measurements like the ones proposed along the article. The mentioned AD datasets 
and image processing toolboxes are available for their use towards this goal. 
Issues like "label noise" and multi-site neuroimaging incompatibilities may also 
have to be overcome, but methods for this purpose are already available.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct an economic evaluation of the use of trans-obturator tape 
(TOT) compared with tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) in the surgical treatment of 
stress urinary incontinence in women.
DESIGN: Cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses from a public-payer 
perspective, conducted alongside a randomised clinical trial.
SETTING: Health services provided in Alberta, Canada.
SAMPLE: A total of 195 women participated in the randomised clinical trial, 
followed to 5 years postsurgery.
METHODS: Comparisons were undertaken between study groups for cost and two 
health-outcome measures. Multiple imputation was used to estimate the 14% of 
missing data. Bootstrapping was used to account for sampling uncertainty. 
Sensitivity analyses were based on complete case analyses and the removal of a 
TVT patient with extreme health service cost.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 15D instrument was used to calculate quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) for the primary analysis. Absence of serious adverse events 
was also analysed. Costs were based on inpatient and outpatient hospital use 
data and practitioner fee-for-service claims data.
RESULTS: The TOT group had a nonsignificant average saving of $2368 (95% CI 
-$7166 to $2548) and incremental gain of 0.04 QALYs (95% CI -0.06 to 0.14) 
compared with TVT. TOT was dominant in over 71% of bootstrap replications and 
cost-effective over a wide range of willingness-to-pay. Cost-effectiveness 
analysis using the absence of an serious adverse events provided similar 
results.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that TOT is cost-effective compared with TVT in 
the treatment of stress urinary incontinence.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: The results of a 5-year cost-effectiveness analysis suggest 
that trans-obturator tape is cost-effective compared with tension-free vaginal 
tape in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence.

Along with the increase in life expectancy over the last century, the prevalence 
of age-related disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases continues to rise. 
This is the case of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's diseases and Multiple 
sclerosis, which are chronic disorders characterized by neuronal loss in motor, 
sensory or cognitive systems. Accumulating evidence has suggested the presence 
of a strong correlation between metabolic changes and neurodegeneration. Indeed 
epidemiologic studies have shown strong associations between obesity, metabolic 
dysfunction, and neurodegeneration, while animal models have provided insights 
into the complex relationships between these conditions. In this context, 
hormones such as leptin, ghrelin, insulin and IGF-1 seem to play a key role in 
the regulation of neuronal damage, toxic insults and several other 
neurodegenerative processes. This review aims to presenting the most recent 
evidence supporting the crosstalk linking energy metabolism and 
neurodegeneration, and will focus on metabolic manipulation as a possible 
therapeutic tool in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

As part of its Single Technology Appraisal process, the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of olaparib 
(AstraZeneca) to submit evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of 
olaparib for the maintenance treatment of BRCA1/2 mutated (BRCAm), 
platinum-sensitive relapsed (PSR) ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer 
in people whose relapsed disease has responded to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The Evidence Review Group (ERG) produced a critical review of the evidence 
contained within the company's submission (CS) to NICE. The clinical evidence 
related to one phase II, double-blind randomised controlled trial that recruited 
265 patients with PSR serous ovarian cancer (OC) regardless of BRCAm status. 
Patients received olaparib 400 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) or matched placebo. In 
the whole population, the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) 
was met (hazard ratio [HR] 0.35; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.49, 
p < 0.01) for olaparib versus placebo. The BRCAm subgroup analysis (added after 
the study commenced but 1 month before the primary analysis was undertaken) 
reported an HR for PFS of 0.18 (95 % CI 0.10-0.31, p < 0.0001) for olaparib 
versus placebo, though interaction tests appeared inconclusive. Overall survival 
was not statistically significant in the whole group (HR 0.88; 95 % CI 
0.64-1.21; p = 0.44) or the BRCAm subgroup (0.73; 95 % CI 0.45-1.17; p = 0.19), 
though treatment switching may have confounded results. The exclusion of data 
from sites allowing crossover resulted in an HR for overall survival (OS) of 
0.52 (95 % CI 0.28-0.97, p = 0.039) in the BRCAm group. Health-related 
quality-of-life measures were not significantly different between groups. All 
post hoc exploratory outcomes (time to treatment discontinuation/death, time to 
first subsequent therapy/death, and time to second subsequent therapy/death) 
were statistically significantly better in the olaparib arm in the whole 
population and the BRCAm subgroup analyses. Adverse events were more frequent 
for olaparib but were largely minor or manageable. The company's semi-Markov 
model assessed the cost effectiveness of olaparib versus routine surveillance in 
patients with BRCAm PSR OC from a National Health Service (NHS) and Personal 
Social Services (PSS) perspective over a lifetime horizon. The model suggests 
that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for olaparib versus routine 
surveillance is expected to be approximately £49,146 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained. The ERG did not consider the company's 
cost-effectiveness estimates to be credible. Additional ERG analyses suggested 
that the ICER is likely to be more than £92,214 per QALY gained. Additional 
analyses provided by the company in patients who received three or more lines of 
chemotherapy suggested a more favourable cost-effectiveness profile for 
olaparib. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended olaparib for this subgroup 
provided the cost of olaparib for people who continue to receive treatment after 
15 months will be met by the company.

The 'S' word.

[No authors listed]

Sarah Cubbin, writing in Cancer Nursing Practice, notes that healthcare staff 
found it difficult to bring up smoking cessation with patients with cancer who 
were receiving palliative care and found it to be inappropriate when the patient 
had limited life expectancy. The author notes that a solution for healthcare 
professionals is to address the issue of smoking soon after diagnosis.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence and its clinical characteristics of 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in a specialized psoriasis clinic of a University 
Hospital.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, 278 patients with psoriasis were evaluated 
between 2011 and 2013.
RESULTS: The study included 278 patients with psoriasis: 144 (52%) were male and 
134 (48%) female. Their median age was 51.41 with median psoriasis presenting 
age of 34.52 years. Referring to the type of psoriasis, 86% presented with 
plaque psoriasis, 5% guttate, 2% palms and soles, 2% inverse, 1% pustular and 4% 
with psoriasis of more than one type. Nail disease appeared in 121 patients 
(43.5%) and scalp disease in 175 (63%). Of these patients, 85 (30%) had PsA, 
whereas 51% of patients with PsA had psoriatic nail disease. With reference to 
the PsA type, 43 (51%) patients presented with polyarthritis, 10 (12%) with 
oligoarthritis, 7 (8%) with axial arthritis, whereas the rest 25 of them (31%) 
had PsA of more than one type. The subgroup of patients with PsA had 
significantly higher rates of comorbidities including arterial hypertension, 
diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia compared to non-PsA patients with 41% vs. 17% 
(P = 0.001), 20% vs. 8% (P = 0.021) and 41% vs. 19% (P = 0.004), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of PsA among patients with psoriasis was relatively 
higher in Greece compared to other ethnic-based studies. Comorbidities related 
to life expectancy were more frequent. As there is a high percentage of 
undiagnosed cases with active arthritis among patients with psoriasis, 
dermatologists should be aware of PsA clinical signs in order to recognize it 
earlier and provide successful treatment.

BACKGROUND: The cancer research literature suggests that women, especially 
premenopausal women, have lower cancer mortality rates than men. However, it is 
unclear if that is true for populations at all age levels in all countries and 
what factors affect such sex differences. This paper attempts to fill that gap.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sex and countryspecific cancer mortality data were 
statistically analyzed with particular attention to geographic, social, and 
economic factors that may affect the sex differences.
RESULTS: The sex differences were age and country specific, rather than 
universal. Premenopausal women actually tend to have a disadvantage compared to 
men or postmenopausal women. Male cancer mortality appears to be the affecting 
factor in explaining variations in sex differences. Latitude of residence and 
literacy rate are the affecting factors in cancer mortality and sex differences. 
African and Latin American countries tend to have a female disadvantage, while 
East Asian and Eastern European countries are more likely to have a female 
advantage.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings challenge the cancer mortality literature and indicate 
that the sex differences and their possible causes are more complicated than the 
current literature suggests. They also highlight the urgency of adapting age and 
country specific health systems and policies to better meet the needs of younger 
women.
