gefitinib versus erlotinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
who failed previous chemotherapy. Lung Cancer 2012;75:82-8, V-15-32, Tarceva In 
Treatment of Advanced NSCLC (TITAN), BR.21, IRESSA Survival Evaluation in Lung 
cancer (ISEL) and IRESSA NSCLC Trial Evaluating REsponse and Survival versus 
Taxotere (INTEREST)]. These limited data precluded conclusions regarding the 
clinical effectiveness of any treatment for EGFR M+ patients. For EGFR M- 
patients, data were derived from the TArceva Italian Lung Optimization tRial 
(TAILOR) trial and Docetaxel and Erlotinib Lung Cancer Trial (DELTA). 
Retrospective data were also derived from subgroup analyses of BR.21, Kim et 
al., TITAN, INTEREST and ISEL. The only statistically significant reported 
results were for progression-free survival (PFS) for TAILOR and DELTA, and 
favoured docetaxel over erlotinib [TAILOR hazard ratio (HR) 1.39, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.06 to 1.82; DELTA HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.92]. In EGFR unknown 
patients, nine trials (INTEREST, IRESSA as Second-line Therapy in Advanced NSCLC 
- KoreA, Li, Second-line Indication of Gefitinib in NSCLC, V-15-32, ISEL, DELTA, 
TITAN and BR.21) reported overall survival data and only one (BR.21) reported a 
statistically significant result favouring the use of erlotinib over BSC (HR 
0.7, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.85). For PFS, BR.21 favoured the use of erlotinib when 
compared with BSC (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.74) and the use of gefitinib was 
favoured when compared with BSC (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92) in ISEL. 
Limitations in the clinical data precluded assessment of cost-effectiveness of 
treatments for an EGFR M+ population by the Assessment Group (AG). The AG's 
economic model suggested that for the EGFR M- population, the use of erlotinib 
was not cost-effective compared with the use of docetaxel and compared with BSC. 
For EGFR unknown patients, the use of erlotinib was not cost-effective when 
compared with BSC.
CONCLUSIONS/FUTURE WORK: The lack of clinical data available for distinct 
patient populations limited the conclusions of the assessment. Future trials 
should distinguish between patients with EGFR M+ and EGFR M- disease.

BACKGROUND: Case managers have been introduced in Dutch primary palliative care; 
these are nurses with expertise in palliative care who offer support to patients 
and informal carers in addition to the care provided by the general practitioner 
and home care nurses. This study aims to describe support and investigate what 
characteristics of patients and the organizational setting are related to the 
number of contacts and to the number of times topics are discussed between the 
case manager and patients and/or informal carers.
METHODS: Prospective study following cancer patients (n = 662) receiving support 
from a palliative care case manager in Dutch primary care, using registration 
forms filled out by the case manager after contact with the patient and/or 
informal carer. In backward linear regression, the association was studied 
between patient or organizational characteristics and the number of contacts and 
the number of times conversation topics were discussed.
RESULTS: Organizational characteristics add more to explained variability in 
data than patient characteristics. Case managers provide support in a flexible 
manner with regard to the number, mode, persons present, and duration of 
contacts. Support covered all domains of palliative care, with most attention 
given to physical complaints, life expectancy and psychological aspects.
CONCLUSIONS: Support offered by the case managers is prompted by characteristics 
of the organization for which they work. This is contradictory to the idea of 
patient centered care highly valued in palliative care.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate cost-effectiveness of exenatide twice daily (BID) vs 
insulin glargine once daily (QD) as add-on therapy in Chinese type 2 diabetes 
patients not well controlled by oral anti-diabetic (OAD) agents.
METHODS: The Cardiff model was populated with data synthesized from three 
head-to-head randomized clinical trials of up to 30 weeks in China comparing 
exenatide BID vs insulin glargine as add-on therapies to oral therapies in the 
Chinese population. The Cardiff model generated outputs including macrovascular 
and microvascular complications, diabetes-specific mortality, costs, and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost and QALYs were estimated with a time 
horizon of 40 years at a discount rate of 3% from a societal perspective.
RESULTS: Compared with insulin glargine plus OAD treatments, patients on 
exenatide BID plus OAD gained 1.88 QALYs, at an incremental cost saving of 
Chinese Renminbi (RMB) 114,593 (i.e., cost saving of RMB 61078/QALY). The 
cost-effectiveness results were robust to various sensitivity analyses including 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The variables with the most impact on 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio included HbA1c level at baseline, health 
utilities decrement, and BMI at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with insulin glargine QD, exenatide BID as add-on therapy 
to OAD is a cost-effective treatment in Chinese patients inadequately controlled 
by OAD treatments.

Recent advances in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have led 
to the availability of both highly efficacious interferon-containing and 
interferon-sparing regimens. However, the use of such therapies faces 
restrictions due to high costs. For patients who are medically eligible to 
receive interferon, the choice between the two will likely be impacted by 
preferences surrounding interferon, severity of disease, coverage policies and 
out-of-pocket costs. We developed a decision model to quantify the trade-offs 
between immediate, interferon-containing therapy and delayed, interferon-free 
therapy for patients with chronic, genotype 1 HCV infection. We projected the 
quality-adjusted life expectancy stratified by the presence or absence of 
cirrhosis for four strategies: (i) no treatment; (ii) immediate, one-time 
treatment with an interferon-containing regimen; (iii) immediate treatment as 
above with the opportunity for retreatment in patients who fail to achieve 
sustained virologic response with interferon-free therapy in 1 year; and (iv) 
delayed therapy with interferon-free therapy in 1 year. When compared to 
one-time immediate treatment with the interferon-containing regimen, delayed 
treatment with the interferon-free regimen in 1 year resulted in longer life 
expectancy, with a 0.2 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) increase in 
noncirrhotic patients, and a 1.1 QALY increase in patients with cirrhosis. This 
superiority in health benefits was lost when wait time for interferon-free 
therapy was greater than 3-3.2 years. In this modelling analysis, 
interferon-free therapy resulted in superior health benefits compared to 
immediate therapy with interferon until wait time exceeded 3-3.2 years. Such 
data can inform decision-making regarding treatment initiation for HCV as 
healthcare financing evolves.

Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) is a statistical method that allows the 
researcher to identify and quantify a social influence on the spread of 
behaviour through a population. Hitherto, NBDA analyses have not directly 
modelled spatial population structure. Here we present a spatial extension of 
NBDA, applicable to diffusion data where the spatial locations of individuals in 
the population, or of their home bases or nest sites, are available. The method 
is based on the estimation of inter-individual associations (for association 
matrix construction) from the mean inter-point distances as represented on a 
spatial point pattern of individuals, nests or home bases. We illustrate the 
method using a simulated dataset, and show how environmental covariates (such as 
that obtained from a satellite image, or from direct observations in the study 
area) can also be included in the analysis. The analysis is conducted in a 
Bayesian framework, which has the advantage that prior knowledge of the rate at 
which the individuals acquire a given task can be incorporated into the 
analysis. This method is especially valuable for studies for which detailed 
spatially structured data, but no other association data, is available. 
Technological advances are making the collection of such data in the wild more 
feasible: for example, bio-logging facilitates the collection of a wide range of 
variables from animal populations in the wild. We provide an R package, 
spatialnbda, which is hosted on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). This 
package facilitates the construction of association matrices with the spatial x 
and y coordinates as the input arguments, and spatial NBDA analyses.

BACKGROUND: Which responder characteristics influence TTO scores remains 
underexplored. More research is needed in order to understand (differences in) 
TTO scores, but also in the context of generating representative health state 
valuations for some population. Previous studies have found age, gender, marital 
status and subjective life expectancy to influence the number of years traded 
off.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate which other responder characteristics 
influence TTO responses, with an emphasis on consideration of significant 
others, such as partners and children.
METHODS AND DESIGN: We performed a web-based survey in a representative sample 
of the Dutch general public (aged 18-65). Data on demographics, health status 
and expectations about future length and quality of life were gathered. 
Respondents valued three distinct health states using TTO.
RESULTS: A total of 1067 respondents completed the questionnaire. Sixty percent 
of respondents had children and 49 % were married. The mean number of years 
traded off increased with severity of health states. Higher age and living 
together were positively associated with number of years traded off. Increases 
in subjective life expectancy, having children and being male (were negatively 
associated with the number of years traded-off.
CONCLUSION: Age, gender and subjective life expectancy, living together and 
having children were significantly associated with TTO responses. Consideration 
of significant others in TTO exercises thus may be important in understanding 
(differences in) TTO responses and when drawing representative samples from the 
general public.

[Interventions at the tricuspid valve: What is possible?].

Due to the increased life expectancy and continual improvements in cardiological 
treatment options, diseases of the tricuspid valve, in particular tricuspid 
valve insufficiency will become increasingly more recognized as an 
interventional target. While tricuspid stenosis is rare and can be effectively 
treated with balloon valvuloplasty, no effective transcatheter approach to 
tricuspid regurgitation (TR) has yet been established. As the tricuspid annulus 
is a complex and highly dynamic structure that offers little resistance, 
orthotopic long-term fixation of transcatheter valves with the current 
techniques is challenging and has not yet been performed in human patients. 
Alternative treatment concepts include transcatheter caval valve implantation 
(CAVI) to address the regurgitation of blood into the caval veins, which has 
resulted in hemodynamic improvement and is currently undergoing further clinical 
investigation. Other interventional treatment concepts are aimed at tricuspid 
valve repair, e.g. by annular plication with the Mitralign™ device or the 
TriCinch™ system. In the medium-term it can be assumed that percutaneous systems 
and therapy options will become available for these indications whereby the 
functional and prognostic effects of these treatment procedures will be 
corroborated in the appropriate patient groups by corresponding studies.

Oxycodone/Naloxone PR: A Review in Severe Refractory Restless Legs Syndrome.

An oral, fixed-dose combination of prolonged-release (PR) oxycodone with PR 
naloxone (Targin(®), Targiniq(®), Targinact(®); hereafter referred to as 
oxycodone/naloxone PR) is approved in Europe for the second-line symptomatic 
treatment of patients with severe to very severe idiopathic restless legs 
syndrome (RLS), after failure of dopaminergic therapy. Coadministration of 
naloxone represents a targeted approach to counteracting opioid-induced bowel 
dysfunction without compromising therapeutic efficacy; because of its very low 
oral bioavailability, naloxone blocks the action of oxycodone at opioid 
receptors locally in the gut. The efficacy of oxycodone/naloxone PR in patients 
with severe RLS inadequately controlled by previous (mainly dopaminergic) 
treatment has been demonstrated in RELOXYN, a 12-week, randomized, double-blind 
study with a 40-week open-label extension. In this pivotal study, 
oxycodone/naloxone PR significantly improved RLS symptoms compared with placebo 
from week 2 onwards; a beneficial effect of oxycodone/naloxone PR was maintained 
through 1 year of treatment. Furthermore, improvements in RLS symptoms in 
oxycodone/naloxone PR recipients were accompanied by similarly sustained 
improvements in disease-specific quality of life and subjective sleep variables. 
Oxycodone/naloxone PR was generally well tolerated, with a treatment-related 
adverse event profile (e.g. gastrointestinal disorders, CNS disorders, fatigue 
and pruritus) that was consistent with that expected for opioid therapy. 
Notably, there were no confirmed cases of augmentation among oxycodone/naloxone 
PR recipients throughout the course of the study. Results from the well-designed 
RELOXYN trial have thus demonstrated the value of oxycodone/naloxone PR as a 
second-line therapy for severe refractory RLS; further investigation of this 
combination product as a first-line treatment for severe RLS is now warranted.

BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy for unresectable pancreatic cancer should not only 
prolong survival but maintain quality of life, considering its limited life 
expectancy. To achieve these goals, biweekly gemcitabine plus S-1 was assessed 
in the clinical practice setting.
METHODS: Fifty-two patients with either locally advanced or metastatic 
pancreatic cancer who received biweekly gemcitabine plus S-1 as a first-line 
anti-cancer treatment were included in this study. Treatment delivery, toxicity, 
response, and survival were reviewed to assess the feasibility and efficacy.
RESULTS: The completion rate of treatment delivery was 95.1%, with relative dose 
intensity of 97.1% for gemcitabine and 97.3% for S-1. Overall, grade 3 or worse 
adverse events were rare, with hematologic toxicities occurring in 5.8%. The 
objective response rate was 30.8%, and more than a 50% reduction of CA19-9 was 
observed in 77.1%. Surgical conversion was completed with a margin-negative 
resection in four patients whose tumor had shrunk for at least 6 months. The 
median progression-free and overall survivals were 10.4 and 18.2 months, 
respectively. Reduction of CA19-9 was associated with longer survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Biweekly gemcitabine plus S-1 may be a good alternative to current 
standard chemotherapies for unresectable pancreatic cancer with less toxicity 
and less treatment burden without losing efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Income is not frequently used to monitor health equity on a national 
level largely due to the lack of public data on income. Information on income 
allows policy makers to identify the economically disadvantaged population in a 
country directly. We examined differences in life expectancy (LE) at birth by 
income and quantified age- and cause-specific contributions to the LE 
differences using national health insurance data.
METHODS: Data from a nationally representative sample of 1 097 333 South Koreans 
(2% of the total population) collected between 2002 and 2010 (39 737 deaths) 
were used. National health insurance premiums were used to estimate income 
level. Age- and cause-specific contributions to differences in LE at birth by 
income were estimated using Arriaga's decomposition method.
RESULTS: LE at birth gradually increased with income in both genders. 
Interquintile income LE differences were 7.93 years in males and 3.82 years in 
females. Most of LE differentials were attributed to differences in mortality in 
middle-aged and older adults. Suicide and cerebrovascular accidents were the two 
leading causes of death contributing the most to income LE differences in both 
males and females. The top 10 causes of death accounted for over 50% of the 
total LE differences by income in both genders. Alcohol-related causes of death 
explained the majority of the gender differences in the income LE differentials.
CONCLUSIONS: Income differentials in LE at birth according to national health 
insurance premiums and data linkage systems could provide a valuable opportunity 
for monitoring and prioritizing population health inequalities in South Korea.

Nowadays food preservation, quality maintenance, and safety are major growing 
concerns of the food industry. It is evident that over time consumers' demand 
for natural and safe food products with stringent regulations to prevent 
food-borne infectious diseases. Antimicrobial packaging which is thought to be a 
subset of active packaging and controlled release packaging is one such 
promising technology which effectively impregnates the antimicrobial into the 
food packaging film material and subsequently delivers it over the stipulated 
period of time to kill the pathogenic microorganisms affecting food products 
thereby increasing the shelf life to severe folds. This paper presents a picture 
of the recent research on antimicrobial agents that are aimed at enhancing and 
improving food quality and safety by reduction of pathogen growth and extension 
of shelf life, in a form of a comprehensive review. Examination of the available 
antimicrobial packaging technologies is also presented along with their 
significant impact on food safety. This article entails various antimicrobial 
agents for commercial applications, as well as the difference between the use of 
antimicrobials under laboratory scale and real time applications. Development of 
resistance amongst microorganisms is considered as a future implication of 
antimicrobials with an aim to come up with actual efficacies in extension of 
shelf life as well as reduction in bacterial growth through the upcoming and 
promising use of antimicrobials in food packaging for the forthcoming research 
down the line.

[Medicine for the elderly or science of old age? Max Bürger's contribution to 
geriatric medicine and gerontology].

[Article in German]

Blumenthal S, Bruns F.

The fact that, due to demographic changes, gerontology and geriatrics are 
gaining ever more importance gives rise to more questions regarding the history 
of the science of aging. Based on unpublished sources and relevant publications 
by Max Bürger, the doyen of gerontological research in Germany, our 
contributions trace the beginnings of age research in Germany. Our results 
confirm Bürger as the dominant expert in this field in the first decades of its 
emergence. Bürger was primarily interested in basic medical-scientific research, 
and less in clinical geriatrics. His scientific goal was not to establish a 
medicine for the elderly but a theory of life changes ("biomorphosis"). From the 
start, he saw aging as a physiological process--a view that is still valid 
today. His concept of "biomorphosis", however, did not catch on and reveals a 
constriction in Bürger's thinking, which was to some extent influenced by Hans 
Driesch's vitalism. Interdisciplinary approaches are noticeable in the natural 
sciences rather than the humanities or social sciences. Bürger's research was 
also influenced by the political system he lived in. During National Socialism, 
which Bürger joined--at least formally--in 1937, his research into labour 
economics and aging met with considerable interest in connection with the 
general mobilisation of resources. East Germany also had an interest in 
questions of labour productivity in old age and the extension of the working 
life, which meant that Bürger remained a sought-after physician and scientist up 
into the 1960s. As he grew older himself, Bürger's initially deficit-oriented 
view of old age gave way to a more positive presentation that attached greater 
weight to the resources of old age.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of erlotinib versus supportive care 
(placebo) overall and within a predefined rash subgroup in elderly patients with 
advanced non-small-cell lung cancer who are unfit for chemotherapy and receive 
only active supportive care due to their poor performance status or presence of 
comorbidities.
SETTING: Between 2005 and 2009, a total of 670 patients with non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) were randomised across 78 hospital sites (centres) in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: 670 patients with pathologically confirmed stage IIIb-IV NSCLC, 
unfit for chemotherapy, predominantly poor performance status (>2 on Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group, ECOG) and estimated life expectancy of at least 
8 weeks. Patients were followed until disease progression or death, including a 
subgroup of patients who developed first cycle rash.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive best supportive care 
plus oral placebo or erlotinib (150 mg/day) until disease progression, toxicity 
or death.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: Overall survival (OS).
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Progression-free survival (PFS), tumour response and quality 
adjusted life years (QALY), including within prespecified subgroups.
RESULTS: The mean incremental cost per QALY in all patients was £202,571/QALY. 
The probability of cost-effectiveness of erlotinib in all patients was <10% at 
thresholds up to £100,000. However, within the rash subgroup, the incremental 
cost/QALY was £56,770/QALY with a probability of cost-effectiveness of about 80% 
for cost-effectiveness thresholds between £50,000 to £60,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Erlotinib has about 80% chance of being cost-effective at 
thresholds between £50,000-£60,000 in a subset of elderly poor performance 
patients with NSCLC unfit for chemotherapy who develop first cycle (28 days) 
rash. Erlotinib is potentially cost-effective for this population, for which few 
treatment options apart from best supportive care are available.

Dominant mutations in five tRNA synthetases cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) 
neuropathy, suggesting that altered aminoacylation function underlies the 
disease. However, previous studies showed that loss of aminoacylation activity 
is not required to cause CMT. Here we present a Drosophila model for CMT with 
mutations in glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS). Expression of three CMT-mutant GARS 
proteins induces defects in motor performance and motor and sensory neuron 
morphology, and shortens lifespan. Mutant GARS proteins display normal 
subcellular localization but markedly reduce global protein synthesis in motor 
and sensory neurons, or when ubiquitously expressed in adults, as revealed by 
FUNCAT and BONCAT. Translational slowdown is not attributable to altered 
tRNA(Gly) aminoacylation, and cannot be rescued by Drosophila Gars 
overexpression, indicating a gain-of-toxic-function mechanism. Expression of 
CMT-mutant tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase also impairs translation, suggesting a common 
pathogenic mechanism. Finally, genetic reduction of translation is sufficient to 
induce CMT-like phenotypes, indicating a causal contribution of translational 
slowdown to CMT.

INTRODUCTION: Cervicofacial cellulitis (CFC) is a severe infection of the 
subcutaneous cellular tissue, and is one of the most serious head and neck 
infectious emergencies. In a series of 70 cases treated between 2007 and 2012, 
we noticed a strong correlation between use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) and evolution of head and neck infections toward CFC, including 
two cases of necrotic CFC extending to the mediastinum, which were fatal.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cases included in the series comprised patients 
admitted to emergency and requiring hospitalization due to the severity of 
presenting symptoms. There were 70 such cases of CFC between 2007 and 2012; 
cases managed on an outpatient basis were excluded, as were cases of orbital 
CFC, CFC of sinus origin and mastoiditis.
RESULTS: Eighty percent of patients took NSAIDs, on self-medication or by 
prescription (community physician, dentist, pharmacist). The most frequent 
molecules were tiaprofenic acid and diclofenac. CFC extension was restricted in 
most cases to the maxillary and/or ipsilateral subhyoid region, with 5 cases of 
lower cervical extension and 2 of mediastinal involvement, which both proved 
fatal.
CONCLUSION: CFC is a severe infection that can be life-threatening, and 
represents a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency. Among other risk factors, use 
of NSAIDs is frequently reported; these should therefore be used with caution if 
at all in head and neck infection, especially of odonto-stomatological origin.

BACKGROUND: Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is a 
nonpharmacologic approach for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation (NVAF). No direct comparisons to novel oral anticoagulants (OACs) 
exists, limiting decision making on the optimal strategy for stroke prevention 
in NVAF patients. Addressing this gap in knowledge is timely given the recent 
debate by the US Food and Drug Administration regarding the effectiveness of 
LAAO.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of LAAO and novel OACs relative to 
warfarin in patients with new-onset NVAF without contraindications to OAC.
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis using a patient-level Markov micro-simulation 
decision analytic model was undertaken to determine the lifetime costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of LAAO and all novel OACs relative to warfarin. Effectiveness and 
utility data were obtained from the published literature and cost from the 
Ontario Drug Benefits Formulary and Case Costing Initiative.
RESULTS: Warfarin had the lowest discounted QALY (5.13 QALYs), followed by 
dabigatran (5.18 QALYs), rivaroxaban and LAAO (5.21 QALYs), and apixaban (5.25 
QALYs). The average discounted lifetime costs were $15 776 for warfarin, $18 280 
for rivaroxaban, $19 156 for apixaban, $20 794 for dabigatran, and $21 789 for 
LAAO. Apixaban dominated dabigatran and LAAO and demonstrated extended dominance 
over rivaroxaban. The ICER for apixaban relative to warfarin was $28 167/QALY. 
Apixaban was preferred in 40.2% of simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold 
of $50 000/QALY.
LIMITATIONS: Assumptions regarding clinical and methodological differences 
between published studies of each therapy were minimized.
CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban is the most cost-effective therapy for stroke prevention 
in patients with new-onset NVAF without contraindications to OAC. Uncertainty 
around this conclusion exists, highlighting the need for further research.

The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has revolutionized 
management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), transforming this 
fatal disease into a chronic disease with nearly normal life expectancy. 
Nilotinib is a second generation TKI targeting the oncoprotein BCR-ABL used in 
patients in the chronic phase of CML. Several research teams have suggested over 
recent years that nilotinib might be the causal agent in the development or 
aggravation of vascular disease, particularly in patients with cardiovascular 
risk factors or an established cardiovascular disease. We report here the case 
of a patient who developed severe peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs 
that worsened despite optimal medical and surgical care, presenting recurrent 
re-stenoses after different revascularization techniques (bypass, angioplasty…) 
associated with aggravation of severe trophic disorders to the point of 
potentially requiring amputation. Discontinuation of nilotinib enabled a 
stabilization of the arterial lesions and complete healing of the trophic 
lesions. This case illustrates the importance of recognizing co-morbid 
conditions in patients with severe vascular disease and to examine the 
possibility of drug interactions leading to rapid aggravation of arterial 
disease with no other cause. Studying the pathophysiological impact of TKIs on 
the vascular system may open new avenues of research for the investigation of 
factors triggering arteriosclerosis.

AIMS: Prevention of cardiovascular disease and heart failure (HF) in a 
cost-effective manner is a public health goal. This work aims to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of the St Vincent's Screening TO Prevent Heart Failure 
(STOP-HF) intervention.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a substudy of 1054 participants with cardiovascular 
risk factors [median age 65.8 years, interquartile range (IQR) 57.8:72.4, with 
4.3 years, IQR 3.4:5.2, follow-up]. Annual natriuretic peptide-based screening 
was performed, with collaborative cardiovascular care between specialist 
physicians and general practitioners provided to patients with BNP levels 
>50 pg/mL. Analysis of cost per case prevented and cost-effectiveness per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was performed. The primary clinical 
endpoint of LV dysfunction (LVD) with or without HF was reduced in intervention 
patients [odds ratio (OR) 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.94; P = 
0.026]. There were 157 deaths and/or emergency hospitalizations for major 
adverse cardiac events (MACE) in the control group vs. 102 in the intervention 
group (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.49-0.93; P = 0.01). The cost per case of LVD/HF 
prevented was €9683 (sensitivity range -€843 to €20 210), whereas the cost per 
MACE prevented was €3471 (sensitivity range -€302 to €7245). Cardiovascular 
hospitalization savings offset increased outpatient and primary care costs. The 
cost per QALY gain was €1104 and the intervention has an 88% probability of 
being cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of €30 000.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with cardiovascular risk factors, natriuretic 
peptide-based screening and collaborative care reduced LVD, HF, and MACE, and 
has a high probability of being cost-effective.

Hepatitis C treatment in the elderly: New possibilities and controversies 
towards interferon-free regimens.

Due to the progressive aging of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) population which 
have acquired the infection during its maximum spread after the Second World 
War, the management of the elderly HCV-infected patient is emerging as a hot 
topic. Unfortunately, although it is recognized that the progression of 
HCV-related liver disease gets faster with aging, and that even extra-hepatic 
manifestations of HCV infection are probably worse in the elderly, till now, 
treatment attempts in this population have been significantly limited by the 
well-known contraindications and side effects of interferon (IFN). The arrival 
of several new anti-HCV drugs, and the possibility to combine them in safe and 
effective anti-viral regimens, is relighting the hope of a cure for many elderly 
patients who had been cut out of IFN-based treatments. However, although these 
new regimens will be certainly more manageable, it should be underscored that 
IFN-free doesn't mean free from any contraindication or side-effect. Moreover, 
one issue which promises to become central is that of the possible interactions 
between antiviral therapy and the multiple drugs frequently assumed by elderly 
patients because of comorbidities. In this review, we will revise the 
epidemiology pointing to HCV as an infection of the elderly, the evidences that 
HCV harms the health of the aged patient more than that of the young one, and 
the available experiences of HCV treatment in the elderly with the "old" 
IFN-based regimens and with the newer drugs. We will conclude that the 
availability of IFN-free regimens should prompt us to change our mind and 
consider a significantly larger number of possible candidates among elderly 
patients, who would take significant advantage from viral eradication. Rather 
than the anagraphic age, drug-drug interactions and, mainly in case of economic 
restrictions, an evaluation of life expectancy dependent on liver disease with 
respect to that dependent on comorbidities, are likely to be the key issues 
guiding treatment indication in the next future. The sooner we will change our 
mind with respect to an a priori obstacle for anti-HCV treatment in the elderly, 
the sooner we will begin to spare many aged HCV patients from avoidable 
liver-related complications.

OBJECT: Pituitary apoplexy is a rare and potentially life-threatening disorder 
that is most commonly characterized by a combination of sudden headache, visual 
disturbance, and hypothalamic/hormonal dysfunction. In many cases, there is 
hemorrhagic infarction of an underlying pituitary adenoma. The resulting 
clinical symptoms are due to compression of the remaining pituitary, cavernous 
sinuses, or cranial nerves. However, there are only 2 case reports in the 
literature describing spontaneous retroclival expansion of hemorrhage secondary 
to pituitary apoplexy. Ten cases of this entity with a review of the literature 
are presented here.
METHODS: This is a single-institution retrospective review of 2598 patients with 
sellar and parasellar masses during the 10-year period between 1999 and 2009. 
The pituitary and brain MRI and MRI studies were reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists 
for evidence of apoplexy, with particular attention given to retroclival 
extension.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients (13 men and 5 women; mean age 54 years) were 
identified with presenting symptoms of sudden onset of headache and 
ophthalmoplegia, and laboratory findings consistent with pituitary apoplexy. Ten 
of these patients (8 men and 2 women; mean age 55 years) had imaging findings 
consistent with retroclival hematoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Retroclival hemorrhage was seen in the majority of cases of 
pituitary apoplexy (56%), suggesting that it is more common than previously 
thought.

BACKGROUND: For people with localised prostate cancer, active treatments are 
effective but have significant side effects. Minimally invasive treatments that 
destroy (or ablate) either the entire gland or the part of the prostate with 
cancer may be as effective and cause less side effects at an acceptable cost. 
Such therapies include cryotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and 
brachytherapy, among others.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the relative clinical effectiveness 
and cost-effectiveness of ablative therapies compared with radical prostatectomy 
(RP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and active surveillance (AS) for primary 
treatment of localised prostate cancer, and compared with RP for salvage 
treatment of localised prostate cancer which has recurred after initial 
treatment with EBRT.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2013), MEDLINE In-Process & Other 
Non-Indexed Citations (29 March 2013), EMBASE (1974 to week 13, 2013), 
Bioscience Information Service (BIOSIS) (1956 to 1 April 2013), Science Citation 
Index (1970 to 1 April 2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL) (issue 3, 2013), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) (issue 
3, 2013), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (inception to March 
2013) and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) (inception to March 2013) databases 
were searched. Costs were obtained from NHS sources.
REVIEW METHODS: Evidence was drawn from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 
non-RCTs, and from case series for the ablative procedures only, in people with 
localised prostate cancer. For primary therapy, the ablative therapies were 
cryotherapy, HIFU, brachytherapy and other ablative therapies. The comparators 
were AS, RP and EBRT. For salvage therapy, the ablative therapies were 
cryotherapy and HIFU. The comparator was RP. Outcomes were cancer related, 
adverse effects (functional and procedural) and quality of life. Two reviewers 
extracted data and carried out quality assessment. Meta-analysis used a Bayesian 
indirect mixed-treatment comparison. Data were incorporated into an individual 
simulation Markov model to estimate cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: The searches identified 121 studies for inclusion in the review of 
patients undergoing primary treatment and nine studies for the review of salvage 
treatment. Cryotherapy [3995 patients; 14 case series, 1 RCT and 4 
non-randomised comparative studies (NRCSs)], HIFU (4000 patients; 20 case 
series, 1 NRCS) and brachytherapy (26,129 patients; 2 RCTs, 38 NRCSs) studies 
provided limited data for meta-analyses. All studies were considered at high 
risk of bias. There was no robust evidence that mortality (4-year survival 93% 
for cryotherapy, 99% for HIFU, 91% for EBRT) or other cancer-specific outcomes 
differed between treatments. For functional and quality-of-life outcomes, the 
paucity of data prevented any definitive conclusions from being made, although 
data on incontinence rates and erectile dysfunction for all ablative procedures 
were generally numerically lower than for non-ablative procedures. The safety
