OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect on total liver volume (TLV) on and off therapy 
in selected symptomatic patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney 
disease (ADPKD) or autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (PLD) who 
received octreotide long-acting release (OctLAR) for up to 4 years.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight of 42 participants in a prospective 2-year 
clinical trial of OctLAR (40 mg monthly) consisting of double-blind, randomized 
(year 1) and open-label treatment (year 2) phases reenrolled in a 2-year 
open-label extension (OLE) study after being off OctLAR a mean of 8.3 months 
(original study: July 1, 2007, through June 30, 2013). Participants underwent 
magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, years 1 and 2, reenrollment, and study 
completion. Primary end point: change in TLV; secondary end points: changes in 
total kidney volume, glomerular filtration rate, quality of life (QoL), safety, 
vital signs, and laboratory parameters.
RESULTS: Twenty-five participants (59.5%) completed the OLE. Off therapy, TLVs 
increased a mean ± SD of 3.4%±8.2% per year; after resuming therapy, TLVs 
decreased a mean ± SD of -4.7%±6.1% per year. Despite regrowth off treatment, 
overall reductions were observed, with a median (interquartile range) TLV of 
4047 mL (3107-7402 mL) at baseline and 3477 (2653-7131 mL) at study completion 
(-13.2%; P<.001) and with improved health-related QoL. Total kidney volumes 
increased, and glomerular filtration rates declined from 58.2 mL/min to 54.5 
mL/min (n=16) in patients with ADPKD on therapy from baseline to study 
completion.
CONCLUSION: Therapy with OctLAR over 4 years in selected patients with 
symptomatic PLD arrested PLD progression, alleviating symptoms and improving 
health-related QoL. Discontinuation led to organ regrowth.

PURPOSE: This retrospective analysis aimed to evaluate the stability of spinal 
metastases in malignant melanoma patients following radiotherapy (RT), and to 
assess prognostic factors for survival.
METHODS: Forty-one patients with malignant melanoma and osteolytic spinal bone 
metastases were irradiated at the university clinics of Heidelberg and Mainz 
between July 2003 and October 2013. Three and six months after palliative RT, 
only 20 and 15 patients, respectively, were still alive and were therefore 
assessed for spinal stability using the Taneichi score based on CT imaging. 
Additionally, overall survival (OS) and bone survival (BS) rates as well as 
prognostic factors for BS were evaluated for all study patients.
RESULTS: Before RT, 19 patients (46.3%) were rated unstable. In the surviving 
patients, none of the unstable metastases were classified as stable 6 months 
after RT. Five-year OS was 23.3% and median BS was 4 months (range 0.5-29.8). 
Accordingly, only 36.6% of the patients were still alive 6 months after RT. 
Karnofsky performance score (KPS) &lt;70%, visceral metastases and more than one 
bone metastasis were significantly predictive of poor BS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study population was characterized by poor BS and a lack of 
benefit with regard to stabilization of initially unstable spinal bone 
metastases 3 and 6 months after RT. This applies in particular to patients with 
a KPS &lt;70%, visceral metastases and multiple bone metastases. Given the 
limited life expectancy, short fractionated treatment schedules of RT may be 
preferred in this population.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is encountered in millions of people worldwide, 
with continuously rising incidence during the past decades, affecting their 
quality of life despite the increase of life expectancy in these patients. 
Disturbance of sexual function is common among men with CKD, as both conditions 
share common pathophysiological causes, such as vascular or hormonal 
abnormalities and are both affected by similar coexisting comorbid conditions 
such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The 
estimated prevalence of erectile dysfunction reaches 70% in end stage renal 
disease patients. Nevertheless, sexual dysfunction remains under-recognized and 
under-treated in a high proportion of these patients, a fact which should raise 
awareness among clinicians. A multifactorial approach in management and 
treatment is undoubtedly required in order to improve patients' quality of life 
and cardiovascular outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The efficacy and safety of peginterferon alfa-2a (PEG-IFN) 
plus ribavirin (RBV) and either boceprevir (BOC) or telaprevir (TVR), and 
physician adherence to treatment algorithms were evaluated in patients included 
in an ongoing non-interventional study (PAN) enrolling adults with chronic 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection managed in German office-based practices.
METHODS: The analysis included HCV genotype 1-infected, treatment-naïve and 
treatment-experienced patients treated with BOC or TVR. Demographic, treatment 
history, virological response, safety, and patient management data were 
collected.
RESULTS: Of a total 1087 patients, 58.1 % achieved sustained virological 
responses (SVR). Response rates were higher in treatment-naïve (BOC 55 %; TVR 
63.4 %) and prior relapse patients (BOC 63.2 %; TVR 74.5 %) versus previous 
null-responders (BOC 14.3 %; TVR 25 %). The most commonly reported adverse event 
overall was fatigue (60.6 %); 45.8 % patients experienced hemoglobin < 10 g/dL. 
Patients with cirrhosis had lower rates of SVR versus those without (42.9 % vs. 
60.7 %, respectively), and had a higher incidence of serious adverse events 
(SAEs) (16.7 % vs. 8.6 %, respectively) and treatment discontinuation (44.6 % 
vs. 25.2 %, respectively). According to recommended response-guided treatment 
algorithms, about 70 % of patients were managed appropriately, 11/10 % (BOC/TVR) 
received unnecessarily extended therapy, and 19/7 % (BOC/TVR) received 
inappropriately shortened therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and safety of BOC- and TVR-based triple therapy in 
this large, "real-world" cohort were largely comparable to that reported in 
pivotal clinical trials, although SVR rates were lower overall. Recommended 
futility or treatment extension rules were violated in a substantial proportion 
of patients with potential implications for response, adverse events and costs.

Economic Evaluation of Combined Diet and Physical Activity Promotion Programs to 
Prevent Type 2 Diabetes Among Persons at Increased Risk: A Systematic Review for 
the Community Preventive Services Task Force.

Li R, Qu S, Zhang P, Chattopadhyay S, Gregg EW, Albright A, Hopkins D, Pronk NP.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a highly prevalent and costly disease. Studies indicate 
that combined diet and physical activity promotion programs can prevent type 2 
diabetes among persons at increased risk.
PURPOSE: To systematically evaluate the evidence on cost, cost-effectiveness, 
and cost-benefit estimates of diet and physical activity promotion programs.
DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Sociological 
Abstracts, Web of Science, EconLit, and CINAHL through 7 April 2015.
STUDY SELECTION: English-language studies from high-income countries that 
provided data on cost, cost-effectiveness, or cost-benefit ratios of diet and 
physical activity promotion programs with at least 2 sessions over at least 3 
months delivered to persons at increased risk for type 2 diabetes.
DATA EXTRACTION: Dual abstraction and assessment of relevant study details.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-eight studies were included. Costs were expressed in 2013 
U.S. dollars. The median program cost per participant was $653. Costs were lower 
for group-based programs (median, $417) and programs implemented in community or 
primary care settings (median, $424) than for the U.S. DPP (Diabetes Prevention 
Program) trial and the DPP Outcomes Study ($5881). Twenty-two studies assessed 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the programs. From a health 
system perspective, 16 studies reported a median ICER of $13 761 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. Group-based programs were more 
cost-effective (median, $1819 per QALY) than those that used individual sessions 
(median, $15 846 per QALY). No cost-benefit studies were identified.
LIMITATION: Information on recruitment costs and cost-effectiveness of 
translational programs implemented in community and primary care settings was 
limited.
CONCLUSION: Diet and physical activity promotion programs to prevent type 2 
diabetes are cost-effective among persons at increased risk. Costs are lower 
when programs are delivered to groups in community or primary care settings.

[Chronic diseases: recent trends, challenges and prospects for change].

[Article in French]

Vernay M, Bonaldi C, Grémy I.

INTRODUCTION: The objectives were to describe available sources for 
epidemiological surveillance of chronic diseases, recent trends, and underlying 
phenomena for these changes and to deduce possible scenarios for the future.
METHODS: Based on the examples of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, the authors 
describe recent trends in mortality and hospitalizations in the general 
population.
RESULTS: Exceptfor diabetes, the morbidity and mortality of the diseases 
considered have globally declined over the last decade. However, trends varied 
according to age and gender and an increase in mortality from myocardial 
infarction, COPD and lung cancer was observed among women under the age of 55. 
Overall, decreased morbidity and mortality can be explained by improvements in 
primary prevention (blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking among men...) and 
prevention of recurrences and complications.
DISCUSSION: It is unclear whether these improvements will continue in the 
future. Aging, obesity, diabetes and smoking among women should negatively 
impact the medium-term morbidity and life expectancy (especially disability-free 
life expectancy). It is still difficult to predict future trends, as other 
factors could attenuate (electronic cigarettes, bariatric surgery...) or, on the 
contrary exacerbate (increased social inequalities in times of economic crisis, 
continued increase in smoking among women, diabetes...) these trends.

Oral health and dental care of elderly adults dependent on care.

The increase in life expectancy in Switzerland is posing new challenges, as more 
and more people are becoming dependent on care, both at home and in long-term 
care facilities. The dental profession must deal with patients retaining their 
own teeth until later in life with an increased incidence and severity of caries 
and periodontal diseases. The association between general and oral health is 
becoming important, particularly in older people with medical conditions. 
Aspiration pneumonia can develop as a result of pathogenic bacteria descending 
from the oral cavity to the bronchoalveolar system, which presents a frequent, 
potentially life-threatening danger. By adapting care and treatment concepts, 
the masticatory ability can be preserved or restored, which in turn helps 
preventing malnutrition. Other aims include preventing infections as well as 
maintaining subjective well-being and an attractive dental appearance. Care 
standards should be defined for the provision of oral-health related dentistry 
for the vulnerable population of the care-dependent adults. These should be 
implemented by an interdisciplinary care team composed of nursing personnel, 
long-term care facility managers, Spitex staff, physicians, dentists as well as 
dental assistants and hygienists.

The elderly patient: no reason to worry!?

Dentistry, Basel, Switzerland.

In December 2013, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) has placed Switzerland for the first time at the top of the list of 
countries general population life ex- pectancy. The augmenting life expectancy 
and demographic changes are leading to an increase in the number of older people 
who are dependent on care (Höpflinger & Hugentobler 2003, Höpflinger et al. 
2011). Multimorbidity and the resulting polypharmacy have inevitable 
consequences for the oral health and present a challenge for dentists (Fried et 
al. 2001). As dental treatment for multimorbid and bedridden adults can be quite 
complex, it seems necessary also from a dental perspective to detect age-related 
defi- ciencies as early as possible. If depression, dementia or malnutrition is 
suspected, an immediate referral to a specialist physician is recommended for an 
in-depth assessment and treatment. For older adults in particular, dental 
measures alone do not necessarily lead to an improvement in well-being and 
nutritional state.

With recent increases in life expectancy in the United States, the number of 
nonagenarians (age 90-99 years) presenting for lower extremity joint 
arthroplasty (TJA) will likely rise. Utilizing the National Surgical Quality 
Improvement Program database, we compared 30-day outcomes of TJA between 
nonagenarians and controls (age <90 years). Nonagenarians had lower mean BMI, no 
difference in mean number of comorbidities, and shorter mean operation time. 
Compared to controls, nonagenarians had longer mean length-of-stay, higher 
readmission rate, and higher risk of postoperative adverse events. Given these 
findings, orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of the increased risks of TJA in 
nonagenarians, and should discuss these risks with potential surgical candidates 
during a shared decision-making process.

Choice Experiment.

e.debekker@erasmusmc.nl.

BACKGROUND: Obtaining insight into patients' preferences is important to 
optimize cancer care. We investigated patients' preferences for surgical 
management of esophageal cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a discrete choice experiment among adult patients who had 
undergone esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma or squamous cell cancer of the 
esophagus. Patients' preferences were quantified with regression analysis using 
scenarios based on five aspects: risk of in-hospital mortality, risk of 
persistent symptoms, chance of 5-year survival, risk of surgical and 
non-surgical complications, and hospital volume of esophageal cancer surgery.
RESULTS: The response rate was 68 % (104/142). All aspects proved to influence 
patients' preferences (p < 0.05). Persisting gastrointestinal symptoms and 
5-year survival were the most important attributes, but preferences varied 
between patients. On average, patients were willing to trade-off 9.5 % (CI 
2.4-16.6 %) 5-year survival chance to obtain a surgical treatment with 30 % 
lower risk of gastrointestinal symptoms, or 8.1 % (CI 4.0-12.2 %) 5-year 
survival chance for being treated in a high instead of a low-volume hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients are willing to trade-off some 5-year survival chance to 
achieve an improvement in early outcomes. Given the preference heterogeneity 
among participants, the present study underlines the importance of a 
patient-tailored approach when discussing prognosis and treatment.

One of the most commonly encountered plant-parasitic nematodes in eastern 
Washington Vitis vinifera vineyards is Meloidogyne hapla; however, limited 
research exists on the impact of this nematode on V. vinifera. The objectives of 
this research were to determine the impact of M. hapla on Chardonnay and 
Cabernet Sauvignon vine establishment and to determine the host status of V. 
vinifera varieties/clones predominantly grown in Washington to M. hapla. In a 
microplot experiment, Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon vines were planted into 
soil inoculated with different densities of M. hapla; population dynamics of M. 
hapla and vine performance were monitored over 3 yr. In greenhouse experiments, 
several clones representing five V. vinifera varieties, Chardonnay, Riesling, 
Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah, were evaluated as hosts for M. hapla. In 
both microplot and greenhouse experiments, white varieties were significantly 
better hosts than red varieties. In the greenhouse experiments, Chardonnay and 
Riesling had 40% higher reproduction factor values than Syrah and Merlot, 
however, all varieties/clones screened were good hosts for M. hapla 
(reproduction factors > 3). In the microplot experiment, M. hapla eggs/g root 
were 4.5 times greater in Chardonnay compared to Cabernet Sauvignon 3 yr after 
planting but there was no evident impact of M. hapla on vine establishment.

Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is an aggressive tumour that may present with skeletal and 
extraskeletal forms. The extraskeletal form is rarely encountered in the head 
and neck region and is extremely rare in the sinonasal tract. This is the case 
report of a ES of the ethmoid sinus with intracranial and orbital extension in a 
33-year-old male patient who presented with anosmia, epistaxis, reduction of 
visual acuity in the left eye and headache. On otorhinolaryngological clinical 
examination and biopsy via flexible endoscope, the lesion was misdiagnosed as 
ethmoid sinus carcinoma. The subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the 
brain revealed a large mass (6×7 cm) eroding the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, 
extending beyond the orbits and occupying the anterior cranial fossa with a 
maximum extension of ~5 cm. The patient underwent surgical resection and the 
microscopic examination of the specimen established the diagnosis of ES 
(immunohistochemically positive for CD99, neuron-specific enolase, CD56, 
synaptophysin, pancytokeratin, low-molecular weight cytokeratins and vimentin. 
The periodic acid Schiff stain exhibited strong intracytoplasmic block 
positivity and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed a t(22;11) 
translocation. First-line chemotherapy was administered for 3 cycles; however, 
on restaging MRI, local disease progression was diagnosed. The patient received 
radiotherapy and second-line chemotherapy for 6 cycles. At 15 months after the 
diagnosis, the patient remains recurrence-free and maintains a good functional 
status and quality of life.

Liberation Army, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214044, P.R. China.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in combination with thalidomide for 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction in older patients (aged ≥70 years, 
life expectancy of >1 year) with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). A 
total of 11 CRPC patients were treated with 300 µg GM-CSF administered 
subcutaneously on days 1, 3 and 6 of weeks 1 and 2 of each cycle. Thalidomide 
was gradually increased to reach the study dose of 100 mg/day. The patients were 
assessed every 4 weeks with therapy continuing to 4 months. All 11 patients 
exhibited a decrease in PSA levels and 3 patients (27.2%) exhibited a PSA 
decrease of >50% in cycle 1. In cycle 2, 8 patients exhibited decreasing PSA 
levels. A total of 3 patients (27.2%) had a PSA rebound, with 1 patient 
exhibiting a PSA rebound of >50%. In cycle 3, 10 patients exhibited continuously 
decreasing PSA levels, with 2 patients (18.2%) exhibiting a PSA decrease of 
>50%; 1 patient (27.2%) had a PSA rebound of <50%. In cycle 4, 9 patients 
exhibited continuously decreasing PSA levels and 2 patients (18.2%) had a PSA 
rebound of >50%. All 11 patients in this study exhibited a decrease in PSA 
levels, with a median decrease of 92.2%. Therapy was well tolerated, with the 
majority of the patients experiencing only one adverse event. In conclusion, the 
combination of GM-CSF with thalidomide was found to be clinically effective and 
well tolerated by elderly CRPC patients. Therefore, GM-CSF plus thalidomide may 
be considered a viable treatment option for such patients.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is predominantly a disease of the elderly. Elderly 
patients may also exhibit poorer outcomes due to the increased burden of 
comorbidities, functional dependency and limited life expectancy. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the outcome of laparoscopic surgery in elderly 
patients with CRC. A total of 148 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery at 
our institution between January, 2000 and December, 2011 were enrolled. We 
compared the differences between elderly patients (aged >75 years, n=48) and 
non-elderly patients (aged <75 years, n=100) and evaluated the demographics and 
disease-related operative and prognostic data. Postoperative complications 
occurred in 24 (16.2%) of the 148 patients. The American Society of 
Anesthesiologists score and comorbidity were found to be significantly 
correlated with complications and the multivariate analysis demonstrated that 
pulmonary disease, but not age, was an independent factor affecting 
postoperative complications (odds ratio = 3.21, 95% confidence interval: 
1.02-10.14, P=0.0470). Patients with pulmonary comorbidities also exhibited 
similar rates of postoperative complications compared with 259 matched patients 
who underwent open surgery during same period (41.2 vs. 46.7%, respectively; 
P=0.7547). In conclusion, chronological age alone should not be considered a 
contraindication for laparoscopic surgery for CRC in elderly patients. In 
addition, selection criteria for laparoscopic CRC surgery in elderly as well as 
non-elderly patients should include pulmonary comorbidities.

INTRODUCTION: Cochlear implantation (CI) is a common intervention for 
severe-to-profound hearing loss in high-income countries, but is not commonly 
available to children in low resource environments. Owing in part to the device 
costs, CI has been assumed to be less economical than deaf education for low 
resource countries. The purpose of this study is to compare the cost 
effectiveness of the two interventions for children with severe-to-profound 
sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in a model using disability adjusted life 
years (DALYs).
METHODS: Cost estimates were derived from published data, expert opinion, and 
known costs of services in Nicaragua. Individual costs and lifetime DALY 
estimates with a 3% discounting rate were applied to both two interventions. 
Sensitivity analysis was implemented to evaluate the effect on the discounted 
cost of five key components: implant cost, audiology salary, speech therapy 
salary, number of children implanted per year, and device failure probability.
RESULTS: The costs per DALY averted are $5,898 and $5,529 for CI and deaf 
education, respectively. Using standards set by the WHO, both interventions are 
cost effective. Sensitivity analysis shows that when all costs set to maximum 
estimates, CI is still cost effective.
CONCLUSION: Using a conservative DALY analysis, both CI and deaf education are 
cost-effective treatment alternatives for severe-to-profound SNHL. CI 
intervention costs are not only influenced by the initial surgery and device 
costs but also by rehabilitation costs and the lifetime maintenance, device 
replacement, and battery costs. The major CI cost differences in this low 
resource setting were increased initial training and infrastructure costs, but 
lower medical personnel and surgery costs.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of transoral robotic surgery 
(TORS) compared to intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for early stage 
(T1-2, N0, M0) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov decision tree model with a 5-year time horizon 
was developed. Comparative groups were: i) TORS with concurrent ipsilateral neck 
dissection +/- adjunctive IMRT, and ii) primary IMRT. Primary outcome was 
cost/quality adjusted life year (QALY). Perspective was the United States third 
party payer. Costs and effects were discounted at a rate of 3.5%. A threshold 
and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed.
RESULTS: TORS strategy cost $30,992 and provided 4.81 QALYs/patient. The IMRT 
strategy cost $26,033 and provided a total of 4.78 QALYs/patient. The 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio for TORS vs. IMRT in the reference case was 
$165,300/QALY. The probability that TORS is cost-effective compared to IMRT at a 
maximum willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY is 42%.
CONCLUSION: An IMRT strategy for management of early stage OPSCC is more likely 
to be cost-effective compared to TORS. To improve the value of TORS for early 
stage OPSCC, consolidating TORS procedures to create high-volume centers of 
excellence may be a potential strategy to increase incremental effectiveness and 
reduce incremental costs. J. Surg. Oncol. 2015 111:155-163. © 2015 Wiley

OBJECTIVE: To obtain estimates of the effects of overweight and obesity on the 
incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and adult mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use three waves (2000, 2002, 2012) of the Mexican 
Health and Aging Survey (MHAS).We employ parametric hazard models to estimate 
mortality and conventional logistic models to estimate incidence of T2D.
RESULTS: Obesity and overweight have a strong effect on the incidence of 
T2D;this, combined with the large impact of diabetes on adult mortality, 
generates increases in mortality that translate into losses of 2 to 3 years of 
life expectancy at age 50.
CONCLUSIONS: If increasing trends in obesity in Mexico continue as in the past, 
progress in adult survival may be slowed down considerably and the incidence of 
T2D will continue to increase.

IMPORTANCE: The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart 
Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol treatment guidelines have wide-scale 
implications for treating adults without history of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with statins.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of various 10-year ASCVD risk 
thresholds that could be used in the ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guidelines.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Microsimulation model, including lifetime 
time horizon, US societal perspective, 3% discount rate for costs, and health 
outcomes. In the model, hypothetical individuals from a representative US 
population aged 40 to 75 years received statin treatment, experienced ASCVD 
events, and died from ASCVD-related or non-ASCVD-related causes based on ASCVD 
natural history and statin treatment parameters. Data sources for model 
parameters included National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, large 
clinical trials and meta-analyses for statin benefits and treatment, and other 
published sources.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimated ASCVD events prevented and incremental 
costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, the current ASCVD threshold of 7.5% or 
higher, which was estimated to be associated with 48% of adults treated with 
statins, had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $37,000/QALY 
compared with a 10% or higher threshold. More lenient ASCVD thresholds of 4.0% 
or higher (61% of adults treated) and 3.0% or higher (67% of adults treated) had 
ICERs of $81,000/QALY and $140,000/QALY, respectively. Shifting from a 7.5% or 
higher ASCVD risk threshold to a 3.0% or higher ASCVD risk threshold was 
estimated to be associated with an additional 161,560 cardiovascular disease 
events averted. Cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to changes in the 
disutility associated with taking a pill daily, statin price, and the risk of 
statin-induced diabetes. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, there was a 
higher than 93% chance that the optimal ASCVD threshold was 5.0% or lower using 
a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this microsimulation model of US adults aged 45 to 
75 years [corrected], the current 10-year ASCVD risk threshold (≥7.5% risk 
threshold) used in the ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guidelines has an 
acceptable cost-effectiveness profile (ICER, $37,000/QALY), but more lenient 
ASCVD thresholds would be optimal using cost-effectiveness thresholds of 
$100,000/QALY (≥4.0% risk threshold) or $150,000/QALY (≥3.0% risk threshold). 
The optimal ASCVD threshold was sensitive to patient preferences for taking a 
pill daily, changes to statin price, and the risk of statin-induced diabetes.

Osteoporosis (OP) and related fractures are well-known severe conditions 
affecting quality of life and life expectancy of postmenopausal women, with high 
economic costs in Europe. On behalf of The Italian Society of Gynecology and 
Obstetrics (Società Italiana di Ginecologia ed Ostetricia, SIGO), the 
Osteoporosis's Menopausal Epidemiological Risk Observation (O.M.E.R.O.) study, a 
national multicenter study on clinical risk factors of OP was organized, using 
FRAX® tool as a reference. Here, data from this study are presented, showing an 
important portion of Italian postmenopausal women affected by osteopenia/OP at 
high risk of fracture and the need to do prevention and/or treatment. 
Gynecologist can be a primary specialist in this important challenge.

Pay for performance (P4P) has been used as a strategy to improve quality for 
patients with chronic illness. Little was known whether care provided to 
individuals with multiple chronic conditions in a P4P program were 
cost-effective. This study investigated cost effectiveness of a diabetes P4P 
program for caring patients with diabetes alone (DM alone) and diabetes with 
comorbid hypertension and hyperlipidemia (DMHH) from a single payer perspective 
in Taiwan. Analyzing data using population-based longitudinal databases, we 
compared costs and effectiveness between P4P and non-P4P diabetes patient groups 
in two cohorts. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to match comparable 
control groups for intervention groups. Outcomes included life-years, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), program intervention costs, cost-savings 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). QALYs for P4P patients and 
non-P4P patients were 2.80 and 2.71 for the DM alone cohort and 2.74 and 2.66 
for the DMHH patient cohort. The average incremental intervention costs per 
QALYs was TWD$167,251 in the DM alone cohort and TWD$145,474 in the DMHH cohort. 
The average incremental all-cause medical costs saved by the P4P program per 
QALYs were TWD$434,815 in DM alone cohort and TWD$506,199 in the DMHH cohort. 
The findings indicated that the P4P program for both cohorts were cost-effective 
and the resulting return on investment (ROI) was 2.60:1 in the DM alone cohort 
and 3.48:1 in the DMHH cohort. We conclude that the diabetes P4P program in both 
cohorts enabled the long-term cost-effective use of resources and cost-savings, 
especially for patients with multiple comorbid conditions.

The programming of cardiovascular disease.

Thornburg KL(1).

Author information:

In spite of improving life expectancy over the course of the previous century, 
the health of the U.S. population is now worsening. Recent increasing rates of 
type 2 diabetes, obesity and uncontrolled high blood pressure predict a growing 
incidence of cardiovascular disease and shortened average lifespan. The daily 
>$1billion current price tag for cardiovascular disease in the United States is 
expected to double within the next decade or two. Other countries are seeing 
similar trends. Current popular explanations for these trends are inadequate. 
Rather, increasingly poor diets in young people and in women during pregnancy 
are a likely cause of declining health in the U.S. population through a process 
known as programming. The fetal cardiovascular system is sensitive to poor 
maternal nutritional conditions during the periconceptional period, in the womb 
and in early postnatal life. Developmental plasticity accommodates changes in 
organ systems that lead to endothelial dysfunction, small coronary arteries, 
stiffer vascular tree, fewer nephrons, fewer cardiomyocytes, coagulopathies and 
atherogenic blood lipid profiles in fetuses born at the extremes of birthweight. 
Of equal importance are epigenetic modifications to genes driving important 
growth regulatory processes. Changes in microRNA, DNA methylation patterns and 
histone structure have all been implicated in the cardiovascular disease 
vulnerabilities that cross-generations. Recent experiments offer hope that 
detrimental epigenetic changes can be prevented or reversed. The large number of 
studies that provide the foundational concepts for the developmental origins of 
disease can be traced to the brilliant discoveries of David J.P. Barker.

Extrapolating published survival curves to obtain evidence-based estimates of 
life expectancy in cerebral palsy.

Studies reporting long-term survival probabilities for cohorts of persons with 
cerebral palsy provide evidence-based information on the life expectancy of 
those cohorts. Some studies have provided estimates of life expectancy based on 
extrapolation of such evidence, whereas many others have opted not to do so. 
Here we review the basic methods of life table analysis necessary for performing 
such extrapolations, and apply these methods to obtain evidence-based estimates 
of life expectancy from several studies that do not report such estimates 
themselves.

Patients with metastatic prostate cancer (PC) live longer than patients with 
metastatic tumours of other sites. Consequently, their social network can 
influence their quality of life (QoL) during a remarkable life span. The aim of 
this article is to present the findings of a systematic review of the studies 
that focused on social network supporting the quality of life of these patients. 
A systematic review for studies meeting specific criteria was undertaken on 
three databases. Some level of unmet psychological needs was present in 54 % of 
the patients. Depression and fatigue are highly prevalent, and the dyads, 
patient and partner, are at higher risk for distress symptoms. The efforts of 
individuals to cope with metastatic PC appear influenced by adaptative skills 
and specific types of family support. Psychological and relational problems 
predominate in the hormone-sensitive stage and are increasingly replaced by 
physical symptoms, social and spiritual needs in the later stages. In the early 
castration-resistant stage, patients will discuss with their doctors information 
about drugs, control of side effects and treatment strategies. In metastatic PC 
patients, needs change during the course of the disease. Social support plays a 
major role in maintaining or disrupting QoL and in the efficacy of psychosocial 
treatments. The trajectory of disease and its effect on the reduced QoL over the 
entire life expectancy should be kept in mind by health system providers and 
social workers.

BACKGROUND: Bone disease is a frequent complication of β-thalassemia major 
(β-ΤΜ) and its etiology is multifactorial. Marrow expansion, chronic hypoxia, 
endocrine complications, and iron overload caused chiefly by chronic transfusion 
treatment are significant factors affecting skeletal health. Bone disease is 
prevalent even among patients on regular transfusions and adequate iron 
chelation. The life expectancy of patients with β-thalassemia has increased 
during the past decade and so, nowadays, patients with thalassemia-associated 
bone disease (TBD) often require long-term management. There are limited data 
concerning their pharmacologic treatment. Bisphosphonates represent the most 
widely studied agents in such patients and there are no published studies about 
the effects of anabolic treatment. Retreatment with teriparatide has only 
occasionally been studied in patients with osteoporosis.
CASE REPORT: We present a male adult patient with β-ΤΜ with a history of low 
bone mass and multiple vertebral fractures, who required sequential treatment 
for his longstanding bone disease. He had exhibited considerable, albeit
