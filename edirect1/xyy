operon, the first gene of which codes for sigmaY, a member of the 
extracytoplasmic function (ECF) family of sigma factors. The sigY operon, 
comprising six genes (sigY, yxlC, D, E, F, and G), was induced upon nitrogen 
starvation; it was continuously transcribed from the 31st base upstream of sigY 
to a neighboring convergent gene, yxlH, resulting in a 4.2-kb mRNA. The 
expression of the sigY operon was also positively autoregulated through sigmaY, 
suggesting that its transcription is likely to be directed by sigmaY. Deletion 
analysis of the sigY promoter, which was localized by primer extension, revealed 
the promoter region of sigY with the "-10" and "-35" sequences of CGTC and 
TGAACG, respectively. The latter sequence was distinct from those recognized by 
sigmaW, sigmaX, and sigmaM. The sigmaY-directed transcription of sigY was under 
negative regulation involving YxlD. sigY disruption affected sporulation induced 
by nitrogen starvation, but sigY induction upon nitrogen starvation was not 
associated with the sporulation process. The organization and function of the 
sigY operon are significantly conserved in several microorganisms living in 
adverse living environments.

The California tumor registry.

BRESLOW L, ELLIS JW, EATON MC, KLEINMAN GD.

The California Tumor Registry, in which 71,215 cases have been entered, provides 
data for professional and public education which is specific to the state. It 
has suggested leads for epidemiological investigation of cancer. Participating 
agencies are assisted in maintaining adequate follow-up systems through annual 
listing of cases by the State Department of Public Health and removal from the 
list of cases in which death occurs. Among the first cases analyzed, the 
diagnosis was confirmed microscopically in 70.6 per cent. Only 36.2 per cent of 
patients had visited a physician within two months after onset of symptoms. 
Survival of patients with cancer is compared with their expectancy calculated 
from life-tables, thus taking account of deaths from causes other than cancer.

Pneumonia in the very old.

Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland. Janssens@iprolink.ch

Pneumonia is a major medical problem in the very old. The increased frequency 
and severity of pneumonia in the elderly is largely explained by the ageing of 
organ systems (in particular the respiratory tract, immune system, and digestive 
tract) and the presence of comorbidities due to age-associated diseases. The 
most striking characteristic of pneumonia in the very old is its clinical 
presentation: falls and confusion are frequently encountered, while classic 
symptoms of pneumonia are often absent. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 
nursing-home acquired pneumonia (NHAP) have to be distinguished. Although there 
are no fundamental differences in pathophysiology and microbiology of the two 
entities, NHAP tends to be much more severe, because milder cases are not 
referred to the hospital, and residents of nursing homes often suffer from 
dementia, multiple comorbidities, and decreased functional status. The immune 
response decays with age, yet pneumococcal and influenza vaccines have their 
place for the prevention of pneumonia in the very old. Pneumonia in older 
individuals without terminal disease has to be distinguished from end-of-life 
pneumonia. In the latter setting, the attributable mortality of pneumonia is low 
and antibiotics have little effect on life expectancy and should be used only if 
they provide the best means to alleviate suffering. In this review, we focus on 
recent publications relative to CAP and NHAP in the very old, and discuss 
predisposing factors, microorganisms, diagnostic procedures, specific aspects of 
treatment, prevention, and ethical issues concerning end-of-life pneumonia.

OBJECTIVE: Patients who have been successfully treated for subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (SAH) are at risk for new episodes. The authors studied the effect of 
screening with CT angiography (CTA) for new aneurysms.
METHODS: In a decision model, the authors compared the strategies "screening" 
and "no screening" after SAH. A literature review yielded the risks of aneurysm 
recurrence, complications of CTA, and re-treatment. The authors estimated the 
expected number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), the number of SAH, and 
the mortality and disability rates for both strategies. They evaluated screening 
at intervals of 2, 5, and 10 years after SAH, using 10 years and remaining life 
expectancy as time horizon.
RESULTS: The expected number of QALYs 10 years after clipping was virtually the 
same for no screening (8.33), screening once after 5 years (8.28), and screening 
every 2 years (8.27). With screening every 2 years, the expected rate of new SAH 
decreased from 1.9 to 0.5%, and mortality decreased from 0.9 to 0.6%; however, 
the disability rate increased from 0.5 to 1.9%. Results were comparable with 
remaining life expectancy as time horizon and for screening after initial 
treatment with coils. The key estimates of the analyses were the incidence and 
rupture rate of new aneurysms, the risk of dying from recurrent SAH, the utility 
of disability, and the risk of complications from DSA and re-treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Presently, screening for new aneurysms after subarachnoid 
hemorrhage cannot be recommended. Screening may prevent new episodes of 
subarachnoid hemorrhage but with too high a cost in terms of complications from 
preventive treatment.

Teaching global bioethics.

USA. jdwyer@pitt.edu

We live in a world with enormous disparities in health. The life expectancy in 
Japan is 80 years; in Malawi, 40 years. The under-five mortality in Norway is 
4/1000; in Sierra Leone, 316/1000. The situation is actually worse than these 
figures suggest because average rates tend to mask inequalities within a 
country. Several presidents of the IAB have urged bioethicists to attend to 
global disparities and to broaden the scope of bioethics. For the last six years 
I have tried to do just that. In this paper, I report and reflect on my attempts 
to teach bioethics in ways that address global health and justice. I then 
discuss ways to address key ethical issues in global health: the problem of 
inequalities; the nature of the duty to assist; the importance of the duty not 
to harm; the difference between a cosmopolitan and a political view of justice. 
I also discuss how teaching about global health may help to shift the emphasis 
in bioethics--from sensational cases to everyday matters, from autonomy and 
justice, and from access to healthcare to the social determinants of health. At 
the end of my paper, I reflect on questions that I have not resolved: how to 
delineate the scope of bioethics, whether my approach over-politicises 
bioethics, and how to understand the responsibilities of bioethicists.

Management of colorectal cancer in elderly patients: focus on the cost of 
chemotherapy.

Matasar MJ(1), Sundararajan V, Grann VR, Neugut AI.

University, New York, USA.

The treatment of colorectal cancer has evolved dramatically over the last 15 
years. Advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have enabled 
oncologists to cure more patients and offer improved quality of life to patients 
not amenable to cure. Specific knowledge of colorectal cancer care of the 
elderly, while lagging behind the treatment of younger patients, is beginning to 
emerge. Informed by recent trials, the approach towards elderly patients is 
shifting towards more aggressive treatment and multimodal therapy. Surgeons are 
operating on the elderly with greater frequency, less operative mortality and 
greater success; 5-year survival following potentially curative surgery has 
risen from 50% to 67%.Research of adjunctive therapy for colorectal cancer is 
enrolling more elderly patients, and with this has come an understanding of the 
role of chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of the elderly, used 
individually and within multi-drug regimens. This research offers insight into 
how the elderly respond to chemotherapy, informing clinicians on anticipated 
benefits and toxicities of treatment. Fluorouracil-based regimens, which have 
long been the standard adjuvant chemotherapy, have been shown to offer benefits 
to the elderly compared with those not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (71% 
versus 64% 5-year survival), and to cause similar toxicities as seen in younger 
patients. The role of novel chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of elderly 
patients with colorectal cancer is also emerging, with studies finding that 
irinotecan, in combination with a fluorouracil-based regimen, can offer a 
further survival benefit of over 2 months compared with fluorouracil alone. 
While newer agents such as capecitabine, oxaliplatin, raltitrexed and 
tegafur/uracil (UFT) have been focused upon by clinical researchers, data on 
their use in the elderly remain unconvincing. Not only are we approaching a 
clearer understanding of the effectiveness of cancer care among the elderly, but 
research is also beginning to identify the cost effectiveness of both standard 
and emerging chemotherapeutic agents. Cost effectiveness of fluorouracil-based 
regimens, depending on delivery strategy, use of modulating agents and stage of 
cancer vary from US dollars 2000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) to US 
dollars 20200 per QALY (1992 values). Irinotecan therapy has not been fully 
investigated from the perspective of cost effectiveness; the figure of US 
dollars 10000 per QALY (1998 values) for irinotecan monotherapy over 
fluorouracil regimens is likely an underestimate, while cost analysis of 
irinotecan and fluorouracil combination therapy has not yet been reported. Our 
understanding of cost effectiveness of other novel agents has lagged behind; 
further research on these agents is needed. Nonetheless, as the effects of these 
novel agents upon both outcomes and costs continue to be defined, both curative 
and palliative treatment of colorectal cancer in the elderly patient will become 
more sophisticated and effective.

Psychological treatment for insomnia in the regulation of long-term hypnotic 
drug use.

Morgan K(1), Dixon S, Mathers N, Thompson J, Tomeny M.

Loughborough University, UK.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical and cost impact of providing, in routine 
general practice settings, a cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) package for 
insomnia to long-term hypnotic drug users with chronic sleep difficulties; and 
to identify factors associated with variations in clinical outcomes.
DESIGN: A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial with two treatment arms 
(a CBT-treated 'sleep clinic' group, and a 'no additional treatment' control 
group), with post-treatment assessments starting at 3, 6 and 12 months.
SETTING: Twenty-three general practices in Sheffield, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: In total, 209 patients (aged 31-92 years) with chronic sleep 
problems who had been receiving repeat hypnotic drug prescriptions for at least 
1 month (mean = 13.4 years) were recruited into the trial.
INTERVENTIONS: The intervention consisted of six 50-minute sessions as follows: 
introduction and sleep assessment, basic sleep hygiene, stimulus control and 
sleep restriction procedures, progressive relaxation, cognitive treatments, and 
review and discharge.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: These included: global sleep quality [as measured by the 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)], frequency of hypnotic drug use, mean 
dose of hypnotics consumed, health-related quality of life [as measured by the 
Short-Form 36 (SF-36)], NHS service costs and overall cost utility.
RESULTS: At 3- and 6-month follow-ups, patients treated with CBT showed improved 
global PSQI scores as well as improvements in the SF-36 dimensions of vitality 
at 3 months and physical functioning and mental health at 6 months. CBT-treated 
patients also reported reductions in the frequency of hypnotic drug use compared 
with the control group, with many CBT-treated patients reporting zero drug use 
at the follow-up assessments. Clinical improvements were maintained within the 
CBT group at the 12-month follow-up, with PSQI scores and the frequency of 
hypnotic drug use continuing to show significant reductions relative to the 
control group. Multiple regression analyses of PSQI scores within the sleep 
clinic group alone indicated that the magnitude of pre- to post-treatment change 
in overall sleep quality was closely related to Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale depression scores at 3-, 6-and 12-month follow-ups. In each model higher 
depression scores at baseline were associated with poorer treatment outcomes. No 
significant relationship was found between the patient's age and PSQI outcomes 
in any of these analyses. Within the sleep clinic group, reductions in drug use 
showed no significant association with the hypnotic product consumed. At the 
3-month follow-up low-frequency drug use was reported by 22.9% (8/35) of 
temazepam users, 33.3% (5/15) of nitrazepam users and 38.9% (7/18) of zopiclone 
users. The total cost of service provision was GBP154.40 per patient (1999/2000 
prices). The mean incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) at 6 
months was GBP3418; this figure was insensitive to changes in costs. A simple 
model also showed that extending the evaluation period beyond 6 months may 
improve the cost-effectiveness of CBT. The incorporation of hidden costs 
associated with hypnotic drug treatment (e.g. accidents) also reduces the cost 
per QALY ratio, although to a much lesser degree.
CONCLUSIONS: In routine general practice settings, psychological treatment for 
insomnia can improve sleep quality, reduce hypnotic drug use, and improve 
health-related quality of life at a favourable cost among long-term hypnotic 
users with chronic sleep difficulties. These positive outcomes appear robust 
over time, persisting for at least 1 year among the more treatment-adherent 
patients. While these benefits may be reduced among those patients presenting 
with higher levels of psychological distress, the present study clearly 
indicates that older age per se presents no barrier to successful treatment 
outcomes. Further research should assess the long-term clinical and 
cost-effectiveness of psychological treatments for insomnia among 
non-hypnotic-using patients, and establish the minimum psychological treatment 
input required.

Systematic review of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
capecitabine (Xeloda) for locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer.

Jones L(1), Hawkins N, Westwood M, Wright K, Richardson G, Riemsma R.

Author information:
(1)NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, UK.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of oral 
capecitabine for locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer in relation to 
its licensed indications.
DATA SOURCES: Twenty-three electronic databases and other databases of ongoing 
research and Internet resources, bibliographies of retrieved articles and 
industry submissions.
REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened and assessed all titles 
and/or abstracts including economic evaluations. Randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) and observational studies that investigated capecitabine monotherapy, in 
patients pretreated with an anthracycline-containing regimen or a taxane, or 
capecitabine in combination with docetaxel, in patients pretreated with an 
anthracycline-containing regimen, were included. The economic evaluation was 
based on data reported in the manufacturer's submission.
RESULTS: For capecitabine monotherapy, 12 uncontrolled observational studies 
were identified. The methodological quality of the studies was low. Capecitabine 
demonstrated antitumour activity, but was associated with a particular risk of 
hand-foot syndrome and diarrhoea. Economic evaluation was hampered by the poor 
quality of the published studies, but compared indirectly with vinorelbine, 
capecitabine was associated with lower costs and improved patient outcomes. For 
capecitabine in combination with docetaxel, one RCT was identified. Combination 
therapy was superior to single-agent docetaxel in terms of survival, time to 
disease progression and overall response. Adverse events occurred more 
frequently with combination therapy. The economic evaluation demonstrated an 
overall improved QALY score for combination therapy with a slight reduction in 
costs.
CONCLUSIONS: No conclusions could be drawn regarding the therapeutic benefit of 
capecitabine monotherapy; RCTs are required. Capecitabine appeared 
cost-effective compared with vinorelbine, but serious doubts remain; the poor 
quality of the trials may invalidate this conclusion. Based on limited evidence, 
combination therapy was more effective than single-agent docetaxel and likely to 
be cost-effective, but was associated with higher incidences of hand-foot 
syndrome, nausea, diarrhoea and stomatitis.

In a recent article, Morley and Morimoto confirm previous studies suggesting 
that the transcriptional activator heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) regulates stress 
resistance genes that extend longevity independently of DAF-16. They also show 
that overexpression of HSF-1 in neurons or body-wall muscle cells is sufficient 
to extend longevity. The role of multiple transcription factors in extending 
life span in yeast and worms raises the possibility that many transcriptional 
regulators can contribute to longevity extension.

The recent fast pace of urbanization in China and other developing countries has 
exerted pressure on urban trees, which constitute a key urban environmental 
asset. The most outstanding trees should be treated as natural-cum-cultural 
heritage. Guangzhou City's growth has threatened its rich urban-tree endowment, 
a diversified assemblage of 200,000 trees represented by 254 species and located 
in three major habitats: roadside, park, and institutional grounds. Mainly based 
on age and performance, 348 trees were officially designated as heritage 
specimens. They were evaluated in the field for tree dimensions, habitat, 
performance, and landscape contribution, to establish enhanced conservation and 
management strategies. With only 25 species, heritage trees were dominated by 
five cultivated natives and encompass some of the city's rare species; some 
common urban-forest species were not represented. Older districts and roadside 
habitats, despite their compact town plan and limited growing space, had the 
largest tree dimensions and largest share of heritage trees. Many heritage trees 
were large with long life expectancy and the potential for biomass expansion, 
and had pivotal cityscape impacts where they occur. Old neighborhoods, 
traditional haven for the arborescent treasure, are being changed by 
construction activities and periodic typhoon and windstorm damages. Increasing 
development density could degrade the heritage trees and their growing space, 
and reduce tree quality and life span. Upgrading the statutory-administrative 
systems and arboricultural care can enhance long-term survival of the precious 
natural-cum-cultural heritage. The experience of Guangzhou in identifying and 
preserving its high-quality urban trees can provide management strategies for 
other cities.

The relative importance of cancer of the cervix among several important causes 
of mortality (from cancer and other diseases) has been evaluated by estimating 
the years of life lost (YLL) by young and middle-aged women (25-64 years old) in 
different regions of the world. The life years were weighted to reflect their 
importance to the individual and to society. On a global basis, cancer of the 
cervix is responsible for about 2% of the total (weighted) YLL, fewer than for 
other causes of mortality in this age group. However, it is the most important 
cause of YLL in Latin America and the Caribbean. It also makes the largest 
contribution to YLL from cancer in the populous regions of SubSaharan Africa and 
South-Central Asia where the actual risk of loss of life from this cause is 
higher, although overshadowed by noncancer deaths (from AIDS, TB and maternal 
conditions). The overall picture is not very sensitive to the age weighting 
function used. The fact that most of the loss of life is preventable, and that 
simple technologies have been developed that make this practicable, means that 
cervical cancer has an even higher profile from the perspective of resource 
allocation in low income settings.

B-cell homeostasis, competition, resources, and positive selection by 
self-antigens.

In adult mice, the number of B lymphocytes remains constant under homeostatic 
control, in spite of the fact that B cells are produced continuously in numbers 
that largely exceed the number required to replenish the peripheral pools. It 
follows that each newly formed lymphocyte can only persist if another lymphocyte 
dies. In an immune system where the total number of cells is limited, cell 
survival is no longer a passive phenomenon but rather a continuous active 
process where each lymphocyte must compete with other lymphocytes to survive. 
Consequently, the number and the life expectancy of a B-cell clone vary 
according to the presence or absence of competitor populations. This process of 
lymphocyte competition is likely controlled by a common need for resources that 
are in limited supply. The number of peripheral B-cells varies according to the 
availability of B-cell receptor (BCR) ligands. Indeed, it is possible to modify 
steady-state B-cell numbers by antigen manipulation. Moreover, conventional 
self-reactive B cells can undergo positive selection. We showed that the fate of 
a self-reactive B cell is determined by the quantity of self-antigens, the 
number of antigen-specific receptors engaged, and its overall antigen-binding 
avidity rather than the affinity of individual BCRs.

A model was developed to assess the lifetime costs and outcomes associated with 
haemophilia in Mexico. A retrospective chart review of 182 type A haemophiliacs 
was conducted for patients aged 0-34 years receiving one of three treatments: 
(i) cryoprecipitate at clinic; (ii) concentrate at home; or (iii) concentrate at 
clinic. Patients treated at home experienced 30% less joint damage, used 13-54% 
less factor VIII, had four times fewer clinic visits, and utilized half as many 
hospital days than those treated at a clinic. For cryoprecipitate at clinic 
patients, the annual incidence rates of HCV and HIV were calculated to be 3.6% 
and 1.4% respectively. The life expectancy for patients receiving 
cryoprecipitate and those receiving concentrate was estimated to be 49 years and 
69 years respectively, with 58% of cryoprecipitate patients predicted to die of 
AIDS before age 69. Across the lifespan, the average annual cost of care was 
US$11,677 (MN$110,464) for cryoprecipitate at clinic patients, US$10,104 
(M$95,580) for concentrate at home patients and US$18,819 (MN$178,027) for 
concentrate at clinic patients. Using a 5% discount rate, the incremental 
lifetime cost per year of life added for treatment with concentrate at home 
compared with cryoprecipitate at a clinic was US$738 (MN$6981). Rank order 
stability analysis demonstrated that the model was most sensitive to the cost of 
fVIII. These results indicate that treatment with concentrate at home compared 
with cryoprecipitate at a clinic substantially improves clinical outcomes at 
reduced annual cost levels.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate harms and benefits associated with use of combined 
hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for five years in women with different 
baseline risks for breast cancer.
DESIGN: Probabilistic clinical decision analysis.
SETTING: Hypothetical population of white UK women aged 50 years with different 
baseline risks for breast cancer.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Gain or loss in quality adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Women free of menopausal symptoms showed a net harm from HRT use, which 
increased for increasing baseline risk of breast cancer. Those with a baseline 
risk of 1.2% would expect a loss in QALYs of 0.4 months (- 0.03 QALYs, 95% 
credibility interval - 0.05 to - 0.01). The main analysis showed HRT to be on 
average beneficial in women with symptoms, with benefit decreasing with 
increasing baseline risk of breast cancer. The results were sensitive to the 
assumed value of quality of life with menopausal symptoms, therefore a contour 
plot was developed to show the probability of net harm for a range of different 
values and baseline risks.
CONCLUSIONS: HRT for primary prevention of chronic diseases in women without 
menopausal symptoms is unjustified. Perceived quality of life in women with 
symptoms should be taken into account when deciding on HRT. Thus, a decision 
analysis tailored to an individual woman is more appropriate in clinical 
practice than a population based approach.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the impact of some underlying causes of death 
on life expectancy of residents in two metropolitan areas.
METHODS: It was carried out a cross-sectional descriptive ecological study based 
on official data (deaths and populations) and estimates of residents in the 
cities Salvador and São Paulo, Brazil, in 1996. The impact of different causes 
of death on life expectancy was evaluated by means of competitive risks and life 
tables.
RESULTS: Life expectancy for males at birth in both cities (64.1 years in 
Salvador and 63.4 years in São Paulo) was lower than for females (70.3 years in 
Salvador and 73.9 years in São Paulo). Communicable diseases have a major impact 
on the mortality in the first years of age, external causes are very important 
especially for men in intermediate ages, and cardiovascular diseases have a main 
role in elderly. Ranked by decreasing importance, causes of death for males in 
both cities were cardiovascular diseases, external causes, neoplasms, 
respiratory diseases and infectious and parasitic diseases. For females, the 
most important were cardiovascular diseases, then neoplasms, respiratory 
diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases, and external causes.
CONCLUSIONS: The well-known social gap between the two capitals affects first 
the basic level, from availability and quality of public services to data 
provided by these services, which impair a more detailed analysis.

College, Institute of Basic, Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical 
Sciences, Beijing 100005, China.

The burden of patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis(TB) and that 
of the communicability of the disease was investigated by using 
disability-adjusted life year(DALY) as an indicator. An assumed cohort of 2000 
cases based on the age-specific incidence of 794 newly registered smear-positive 
cases in Beijing in 1994 was set up. The prognostic tree and diagram model of 
communicability under natural history and direct observed treatment short-course 
startegy(DOTS) were established according to the epidemiological evidence. The 
results showed that 29.6% of DALYs would be neglected if the burden caused by 
the communicability have not been considered. The results also showed that DOTS 
might reduce 97.3% of potential cases infected, reduce 92.9% of DALY to patient 
themselves, and reduce 99.9% of DALYs caused by the communicability as well.

Hormone use and abuse: what is the difference between hormones as fountain of

GH can induce changes in body composition that are considered to be advantageous 
to aging subjects especially. However, there are no results indicating that the 
use of GH during aging should be advocated, because of the lack of any proven 
efficacy for whatever parameter. Also, data indicate that calorie restriction 
can extend life spans by altering the rate of decline in reserve capacity as 
well as by reducing the cumulative exposure to GH. Moreover, animal data suggest 
that lower GH actions are positively correlated with longevity. The abuse of GH 
by sportsmen is based on the belief that it has potent anabolic effects, while 
it is difficult to detect the abuse. Again, this supposed efficacy cannot be 
supported by any scientific data.

Revitalization of minority languages as a way to promote well-being in the 
North.

niina.kunnas@oulu.fi

BACKGROUND: In this paper I discuss the interdependence between the 
revitalization of minority languages and well-being at the population level.
OBJECTIVES: The paper aims to describe the history and current status of three 
northern minority languages, Kven, Meänkieli and Viena Karelian, and the ways in 
which revitalization of these languages and restoration of their linguistic 
rights could enhance the well-being of the speakers of these languages.
METHODS: A number of research findings are presented to show that being a 
minority language speaker constitutes an economic, social and health risk. The 
potential psychic and physical adverse effects of linguistic exploitation are 
also discussed.
RESULTS: It is further demonstrated in the paper that non-existent linguistic 
rights may have a negative impact, not only on the overall well-being of the 
minority, but also on the group's economic status. Positive findings on minority 
status are presented concerning the speakers of Swedish in Finland and the 
speakers of French in Canada.
CONCLUSION: It is also shown that the development of a minority language and 
functional linguistic rights may prolong the life expectancy and well-being of 
the minority members and have a positive economic impact, not only on the 
minority, but also on society as a whole.
