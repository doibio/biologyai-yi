present data on hyperglycemia as a risk factor for CVD and review the current 
knowledge of age-related changes in glucose metabolism. Next, we review the role 
of obesity in the pathogenesis of age-related glucose dysregulation, followed by 
a summary of the results from major randomized controlled trials that focus on 
cardiovascular risk reduction through glycemic control, with a special emphasis 
on older adults. We then conclude with our proposed model of aging that body 
composition changes and insulin resistance link possible dysregulation of 
physiological pathways leading to obesity and diabetes mellitus-both forms of 
accelerated aging-and risks for CVD.

Cardiovascular diseases are the most prominent maladies in aging societies. 
Indeed, aging promotes the structural and functional declines of both the heart 
and the blood circulation system. In this review, we revise the contribution of 
known longevity pathways to cardiovascular health and delineate the 
possibilities to interfere with them. In particular, we evaluate autophagy, the 
intracellular catabolic recycling system associated with life- and health-span 
extension. We present genetic models, pharmacological interventions, and dietary 
strategies that block, reduce, or enhance autophagy upon age-related 
cardiovascular deterioration. Caloric restriction or caloric restriction 
mimetics like metformin, spermidine, and rapamycin (all of which trigger 
autophagy) are among the most promising cardioprotective interventions during 
aging. We conclude that autophagy is a fundamental process to ensure cardiac and 
vascular health during aging and outline its putative therapeutic importance.

Aging is associated with a progressive decline in cardiovascular structure and 
function. Accumulating evidence links cardiovascular aging to epigenetic 
alterations encompassing a complex interplay of DNA methylation, histone 
posttranslational modifications, and dynamic nucleosome occupancy governed by 
numerous epigenetic factors. Advances in genomics technology have led to a 
profound understanding of chromatin reorganization in both cardiovascular aging 
and diseases. This review summarizes recent discoveries in epigenetic mechanisms 
involved in cardiovascular aging and diseases and discusses potential 
therapeutic strategies to retard cardiovascular aging and conquer related 
diseases through the rejuvenation of epigenetic signatures to a young state.

BACKGROUND: International guidelines recommend avoiding prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA)-based prostate cancer screening in the elderly when life 
expectancy is less than 10 years. For younger men, most recommendations 
encourage a shared decision-making process taking into account patient 
comorbidities.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the performance of PSA-based prostate 
cancer screening in men older than 74 years and assess whether the presence (vs 
absence) of comorbidities was related to the performance of PSA testing in 
younger men aged 50 to 74 years who were eligible for screening.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the French national health care database 
(Loire-Atlantique geographic area). We reported the follow-up of two cohorts of 
men from April 1, 2014, to March 31, 2016: 22,480 men aged over 74 years and 
98,107 men aged 50 to 74 years. We analyzed whether these patients underwent PSA 
testing after 2 years of follow-up and whether PSA testing performance was 
related to the following patient-related variables: age, low income, proxy 
measures indicative of major comorbidities (repeated ambulance transportation, 
having one of 30 chronic diseases, taking 5 or more drugs per day), or proxy 
measures indicative of specific comorbidities (cancer diseases, cardiovascular 
diseases, or psychiatric disorders). Statistical analysis was based on a 
multivariate mixed-effects logistic regression.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients who underwent a PSA-based screening test was 
41.35% (9296/22,480) among men older than 74 years versus 41.05% (40,275/98,107) 
among men aged 50 to 74 years. The following factors were associated with less 
frequent PSA testing in men older than 74 years-age (odds ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% 
CI 0.88-0.89), low income (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.69), suffering from a chronic 
disease (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76-0.88), repeated ambulance transportation (OR 0.37, 
95% CI 0.31-0.44), diabetes requiring insulin (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43-0.60), 
dementia (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55-0.84), and antipsychotic treatment (OR 0.62, 95% 
CI 0.51-0.75)-whereas cardiovascular drug treatment was associated with more 
frequent PSA testing (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.53-1.84). The following factors were 
associated with less frequent PSA testing in men aged 50 to 74 years-low income 
(OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.55-0.68); nonspecific conditions related to frailty: 
suffering from a chronic disease (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.83), repeated ambulance 
transportation (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.23-0.38), or chronic treatment with 5 or more 
drugs (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83-0.96); and various specific comorbidities: 
anticancer drug treatment (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.55-0.83), diabetes requiring 
insulin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.49-0.61), and antiaggregant treatment (OR 0.91, 95% 
CI 0.86-0.96)-whereas older age (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.07-1.08) and treatment with 
other cardiovascular drugs (OR 2.23, 95% CI 2.15-2.32) were associated with more 
frequent PSA testing.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 41.35% (9296/22,480) of French men older than 74 
years had a PSA-based screening test. Although it depends on patient 
comorbidities, PSA testing remains inappropriate in certain populations.

Background: Osteosarcoma is the most frequent form of malignant pediatric bone 
tumor. Despite the current therapeutic arsenal, patient life-expectancy remains 
low if metastases are detected at the time of diagnosis, justifying research 
into better knowledge at all stages of osteosarcoma ontogenesis and 
identification of new therapeutic targets. Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor 
κB (RANK)expression has been reported in osteosarcoma cells, raising the 
question of Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor κB Ligand (RANKL)/RANK 
signaling implications in these tumor cells (intrinsic), in addition to 
previously reported implications through osteoclast activation in the tumor 
microenvironment (extrinsic). Methods: Based on in vitro and in vivo 
experimentations using human and mouse osteosarcoma cell lines, the consequences 
on the main cellular processes of RANK expression in osteosarcoma cells were 
analyzed. Results: The results revealed that RANK expression had no impact on 
cell proliferation and tumor growth, but stimulated cellular differentiation 
and, in an immune-compromised environment, increased the number of lung 
metastases. The analysis of RANKL, RANK and osteoprotegerin (OPG) expressions in 
biopsies of a cohort of patients revealed that while RANK expression in 
osteosarcoma cells was not significantly different between patients with or 
without metastases at the time of diagnosis, the OPG/RANK ratio decreased 
significantly. Conclusion: Altogether, these results are in favor of RANKL-RANK 
signaling inhibition as an adjuvant for the treatment of osteosarcoma.

BACKGROUND: In 2015, it was estimated that the burden of disease in Iran 
comprised of 19 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 74% of which 
were due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The observed leading causes of 
death were cardiovascular diseases (41.9%), neoplasms (14.9%), and road traffic 
injuries (7.4%). Even so, the health research investment in Iran continues to 
remain limited. This study aims to identify national health research priorities 
in Iran for the next five years to assist the efficient use of resources towards 
achieving the long-term health targets.
METHODS: Adapting the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) 
method, this study engaged 48 prominent Iranian academic leaders in the areas 
related to Iran's long-term health targets, a group of research funders and 
policy makers, and 68 stakeholders from the wider society. 128 proposed research 
questions were scored independently using a set of five criteria: feasibility, 
impact on health, impact on economy, capacity building, and equity.
FINDINGS: The top-10 priorities were focused on the research questions relating 
to: health insurance system reforms to improve equity; integration of NCDs 
prevention strategy into primary health care; cost-effective population-level 
interventions for NCDs and road traffic injury prevention; tailoring medical 
qualifications; epidemiological assessment of NCDs by geographic areas; equality 
in the distribution of health resources and services; current and future common 
health problems in Iran's elderly and strategies to reduce their economic 
burden; the status of antibiotic resistance in Iran and strategies to promote 
rational use of antibiotics; the health impacts of water crisis; and research to 
replace the physician-centered health system with a team-based one.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight consensus amongst various prominent 
Iranian researchers and stakeholders over the research priorities that require 
investment to generate information and knowledge relevant to the national health 
targets and policies. The exercise should assist in addressing the knowledge 
gaps to support both the National General Health Policies by 2025 and the health 
targets of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

Introduction  The aging process causes changes in body structure in a continuous 
manner, and contributes to clinical disorders. Life expectancy is increasing, 
especially in developing countries. Objective  To assess the prevalence of 
hearing loss and its possible association with hypertension and diabetes 
mellitus (DM) in the elderly. Methods  A cross-sectional study with 519 elderly 
individuals aged over 60 years who underwent an audiological evaluation (pure 
tone audiometry), and answered a comorbidity questionnaire that included 
questions about age, gender, tinnitus and medical history, with data concerning 
DM. The dependent variable was the presence of hearing loss. The independent 
variables were age, gender, DM and hypertension. The variables were presented in 
absolute numbers and proportions, and enabled us to estimate the prevalence. The 
statistical analysis was performed through multiple logistic regression with 95% 
confidence intervals and values of p  < 0.05 for the hearing loss and its 
associated factors. Results  A total of 519 subjects of both genders with a 
median age of 69 years were evaluated, and the individuals who did not attend 
the audiometric test were excluded from the study, so the final sample was 
composed of 498 subjects. Sensorineural hearing loss was more prevalent (66.26%) 
of most frequently with bilateral hearing loss of 91.56% and 26.50% with mild 
degree. The statistical analysis showed that the variable DM was associated with 
the high frequency of hearing loss in the elderly, and according to the multiple 
logistic regression, the risk factors are independent of the hearing loss only 
for age and exposure to occupational noise. Conclusions  There was a

BACKGROUND: Revascularization is a treatment option for patients with 
intermittent claudication. However, there is a lack of evidence to support its 
long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness. The aim of this study was to compare 
the cost-effectiveness of revascularization and best medical therapy (BMT) with 
that of BMT alone.
METHODS: Data were used from the IRONIC (Invasive Revascularization Or Not in 
Intermittent Claudication) RCT where consecutive patients with mild-to-severe 
intermittent claudication owing to aortoiliac or femoropopliteal disease were 
allocated to either BMT alone (including a structured, non-supervised exercise 
programme) or to revascularization together with BMT. Inpatient and outpatient 
costs were obtained prospectively over 24 months of follow-up. Mean improvement 
in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was calculated based on responses to the 
EuroQol Five Dimensions EQ-5D-3 L™ questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness was 
assessed as the cost per QALY gained.
RESULTS: A total of 158 patients were randomized, 79 to each group. The mean 
cost per patient in the BMT group was €1901, whereas it was €8280 in the group 
treated with revascularization in addition to BMT, with a cost difference of 
€6379 (95 per cent c.i. €4229 to 8728) per patient. Revascularization in 
addition to BMT resulted in a mean gain in QALYs of 0·16 (95 per cent c.i. 0·06 
to 0·24) per patient, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €42 881 
per QALY.
CONCLUSION: The costs associated with revascularization together with BMT in 
patients with intermittent claudication were about four times higher than those 
of BMT alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of revascularization was 
within the accepted threshold for public willingness to pay according to the 
Swedish National Guidelines, but exceeded that of the UK National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence guidelines.

The actinomycete genus Streptomyces is characterized by producing bioactive 
secondary metabolites, including antibiotics. In this study, chemical and 
biological investigations were carried out on Streptomyces strain 4205 isolated 
from the paddy soil, leading to the identification and characterization of 10 
albocycline-type macrolides, among which 4 compounds were new, namely 
albocyclines A-D (1-4). The structures of 1-10 were identified according to the 
1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopic data. Furthermore, compounds 1-10 were evaluated 
for antimicrobial activity. Compounds 5-7 displayed antimicrobial activities 
against Candidaalbicans ATCC 90028 with the same MIC value of 10.0 mg/mL and the 
IC50 values of 1.5, 1.0, and 1.0 mg/mL, respectively. Thus, the research on 
Streptomyces sp. is of vital significance for developing new antibiotic agents.

The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be reduced by lowering cholesterol, 
even at old age. However, there is a large spread in the level of risk of CVD in 
the elderly. Competing risks, time-to-benefit of the medication in relation to 
patient life expectancy and frailty must be taken into account when deciding 
whether or not to prescribe a cholesterol-lowering drug. When estimating 
cardiovascular risk in the elderly, one should use an age-adjusted 
individualized risk score that takes into account competing risks. In the case 
of energetic elderly people without vascular disease, one should start with 
cholesterol-lowering drugs only if they have a high risk of cardiovascular 
morbidity, for example, because of diabetes mellitus or very high blood 
pressure. Cholesterol-lowering drugs should not be prescribed to frail elderly 
people without vascular disease. A cholesterol-lowering drug should be started 
or continued in elderly patients with vascular disease. It should be stopped in 
case of unpleasant side effects or if life expectancy is no more than 1 to 2 
years.

OBJECTIVES: To examine 23-year trends in both physically and cognitively healthy 
life expectancy from age 65 years in the Netherlands.
METHODS: We used 8 waves between 1993 and 2016 from the nationally 
representative Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (12 948 observations). We 
calculated physically and cognitively healthy life expectancies by using the 
Sullivan life table method and tested prevalence trends over time by using 
generalized estimating equations.
RESULTS: Total life expectancy at age 65 years rose from 14.7 to 18.7 years 
(men) and from 19.2 to 21.4 years (women). Life expectancy in poor physical 
health increased nonlinearly from 1.8 to 2.9 years for men; for women it 
fluctuated around 5.7 years. Meanwhile, life expectancy in good cognitive health 
increased linearly from 11.0 to 15.7 years (men) and from 13.4 to 18.0 years 
(women). The proportion of people with poor physical and poor cognitive health 
combined did not increase, averaging 5.9% (men) and 8.7% (women).
CONCLUSIONS: This multiwave study shows that a negative trend in physically 
healthy life expectancy is accompanied by a positive trend in cognitively 
healthy life expectancy.

Abstract-For the past decades Japan has remained number one in a range of 
population health metrics including the world's longest healthy life expectancy. 
While this was achieved through various socioeconomic factors besides public 
health interventions, health promotion policies to prevent and control 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) played a major role. Japan introduced its first 
comprehensive national plan to prevent and control NCDs in 1978 and has revised 
the plan every decade since. These 10-year policy packages were instrumental in 
galvanizing stakeholders, while adapting to changing social, behavioral, and 
epidemiological trends. In this article, we provide an overview of trends in 
policy on the prevention and control of NCDs in Japan with a focus on successes 
and challenges especially due to a rapidly aging population. Through this review 
we aim to share the lessons learned in Japan for other countries tackling or 
expecting to be challenged by NCDs. These lessons include the role of 
multisectoral approaches, clear goals and targets with effective monitoring and 
evaluation mechanisms, addressing social aspects, adjustment to the local 
context, and foreseeing future demographic transition. Japan is committed to 
contributing to the world as a forerunner of the health challenges posed by 
unprecedented demographic change, by sharing its lessons in the global quest to 
create a world where all people can live longer and healthier lives.

Abstract-Population aging is among the most important global transformations. 
Compared to European and North American countries, Chile is among the countries 
with the fastest growth of life expectancy at birth during recent decades. The 
aging of Chile's population is related to the improvement of living conditions, 
but also entails risks that tend to be associated with a rapid economic growth 
accompanied by large income inequalities and a chronic deficit of basic social 
benefits. The rapid demographic transition towards an aged population has 
unfolded in a context of poor development of public policies to tackle the 
opportunities and needs associated with an aging society. This article provides 
a brief overview of current Chilean public policy on aging, with a focus on 
healthy aging as defined by World Health Organization. The discussion addresses 
core challenges to successfully achieve healthy aging in Chile.

BACKGROUND: Biologic and biosynthetic meshes typically cost more than synthetic 
meshes for use in ventral hernia repair (VHR), with unknown comparative 
effectiveness.
STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis was performed from a limited societal 
perspective assessing direct medical costs and outcomes for open, elective, 
retromuscular VHR. Short-term and 5-year major complications and costs were 
modeled using best available evidence from published studies, Healthcare Cost 
and Utilization Project data, and Americas Hernia Society Quality Collaborative 
data. Costs were analyzed in 2017 US dollars, and utilities were assessed using 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses were performed to 
determine threshold probabilities of long-term complications favoring particular 
mesh types.
RESULTS: Synthetic mesh was the preferred strategy, with a cost of $15,620 and 
QALYs of 18.85, assuming a baseline 5.6% rate of long-term complications for all 
meshes. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that biosynthetic and biologic 
mesh became the better choice as long-term complication rates for synthetic mesh 
increased to 15.5% and 26.2%, respectively. Two-way sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that biologic and biosynthetic meshes became favorable as the cost 
of biologic mesh decreased and long-term synthetic mesh complication rates 
increased. Biologic and biosynthetic meshes also became more cost-effective when 
their relative long-term complication rates decreased and long-term synthetic 
mesh complication rates increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Using modeling techniques, synthetic mesh is the best option for 
retromuscular VHR given currently available evidence. We established long-term 
complication thresholds, possibly justifying the higher up-front costs for 
biologic or biosynthetic meshes. This emphasizes the critical need to obtain 
long-term complication surveillance data to help individualize mesh choice in 
VHR.

BACKGROUND: In Asia, an estimated one million deaths are caused by 
communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) each year. Despite the high mortality in 
elderly people, a large number of CAP patients have been treated and survived 
with optimal life expectancy. A few studies have been done on adult CAP 
therapeutic approaches in Asia. Moreover, differences have been noted between 
these studies and European data. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of oral 
Levofloxacin (TAVANEX), 750 mg, once daily for five days versus parenteral 
Ceftriaxone 1gr BD, plus oral Azithromycin (250 mg, once daily) for seven to ten 
days (standard regimen) in CAP treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized trial among 150 
patients with CAP in Qaem Hospital of Alborz city from December 2016 to June 
2017. A group of CAP patients were randomized in two treatment groups. One group 
was treated with oral Levofloxacin (TAVANEX), 750 mg, once daily for five days 
and the other group with parenteral Ceftriaxone 1gr BD plus oral Azithromycin 
(250 mg, once daily) for seven to ten days (standard regimen). The efficacy and 
side effects of the assigned drugs were compared between two groups. The 
probability level for statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05.
RESULTS: The body temperature (P value=0.09), WBC count (P value=0.15), 
respiratory sounds (P value=0.18) and admission duration (P value=0.15) showed 
no significant differences after treatment between two groups. There was no 
report of hospital mortality, clinical deterioration and antibiotic escalation 
during hospital admission in both groups of study. In standard regimen group, 
only two (2.7%) patients had skin rash while in Levofloxacin group one case 
(1.3%) had skin rash, two patients (2.7%) had gastrointestinal problems and 
three (4%) patients showed central nervous system (CNS) complications. In both 
groups, the reticulonodular pattern was more frequently observed in Chest X-ray. 
Although standard regimen group (n=27, 36%) showed more consolidation than 
patients in Levofloxacin group (n=22, 29.3%), and the ground glass pattern was 
observed more in Levofloxacin group.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that monotherapy with oral Levofloxacin was as 
effective as treatment with Ceftriaxone plus Azithromycin combination in 
patients with CAP who required hospitalization.

A high demand for functional bone grafts is being observed worldwide, especially 
due to the increased life expectancy. Osteoinductive components should be 
incorporated into functional bone grafts, accelerating cell recruitment, cell 
proliferation, angiogenesis, and new bone formation at a defect site. 
Noncollagenous bone matrix proteins, especially osteopontin (OPN) and 
osteocalcin (OC), have been reported to regulate some physiological process, 
such as cell migration and bone mineralization. However, the effects of OPN and 
OC on cell proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, mineralization, and 
angiogenesis are still undefined. Therefore, we assessed the exogenous effect of 
OPN and OC supplementation on human bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells 
(hBM MSC) proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. OPN dose-dependently 
increased the proliferation of hBM MSC, as well as improved the angiogenic 
properties of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by increasing the 
capillary-like tube formation in vitro. On the other hand, OC enhanced the 
differentiation of hBM MSC into osteoblasts and demonstrated an increase in 
extracellular calcium levels and alkaline phosphatase activity, as well as 
higher messenger RNA levels of mature osteogenic markers osteopontin and 
osteocalcin. In vivo assessment of OC/OPN-enhanced scaffolds in a critical-sized 
defect rabbit long-bone model revealed no infection, while new bone was being 
formed. Taken together, these results suggest that OC and OPN stimulate bone 
regeneration by inducing stem cell proliferation, osteogenesis and by enhancing 
angiogenic properties. The synergistic effect of OC and OPN observed in this 
study can be applied as an attractive strategy for bone regeneration 
therapeutics by targeting different vital cellular processes.

AIMS: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are appealing as 
glucose-lowering therapy for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as 
they also reduce body weight and are associated with low rates of hypoglycaemia. 
This analysis assessed the long-term cost-effectiveness of semaglutide 0.5 and 1 
mg vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg (two once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonists) from a UK 
healthcare payer perspective, based on the head-to-head SUSTAIN 7 trial, to 
inform healthcare decision making.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Long-term outcomes were projected using the IQVIA CORE 
Diabetes Model (version 9.0). Baseline cohort characteristics, changes in 
physiological parameters and adverse event rates were derived from the 40-week 
SUSTAIN 7 trial. Costs to a healthcare payer were assessed, and these captured 
pharmacy costs and costs of complications. Utilities were taken from published 
sources.
RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 and 1 mg were associated with improvements 
in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.04 and 0.10 quality-adjusted life 
years, respectively, compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Clinical benefits were 
achieved at reduced costs, with lifetime cost savings of GBP 35 with once-weekly 
semaglutide 0.5 mg and GBP 106 with the once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg, resulting 
from fewer diabetes-related complications due to better glycaemic control. 
Therefore, both doses of once-weekly semaglutide were considered dominant vs 
dulaglutide 1.5 mg (improving outcomes and reducing costs).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with treatment with dulaglutide, once-weekly semaglutide 
represents a cost-effective option for treating individuals in the UK with T2DM 
who are not achieving glycaemic control with metformin, projected to both 
improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs.

The question whether aging is a disease or not, has been asked by many 
professionals who are involved in the study of age-related degeneration. 
However, not only an agreement on this remains elusive, but also effective 
clinical treatments against human aging have not been forthcoming. In this 
Opinion paper I suggest that the complexity involved in aging is such that we 
need to remodel our thinking to involve a much more 'systems-oriented' approach. 
I explore four main principles which should be employed by those who are working
