BACKGROUND: In the 1980s, PHC implementation promoted the health care delivery 
and overall health status of the population in Iran. Identifying the crucial 
design and implementation aspects of the PHC program can highlight the way it 
was implemented in a difficult sociopolitical environment. Using a policy 
analysis approach unfolds the details of implementation in a context which was 
not overtly convenient for a great health system reform.
METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 35 key participants and 
collected relevant literature and documents. We used a policy triangle framework 
to conceptualize the study and used a thematic data analysis approach to analyze 
the verbatim transcribed texts and documents. Data were analyzed with regard to 
the context, content, process and actors of the policy.
RESULTS: Proper use of the conditions and opportunities, during the first years 
after a revolutionary political change resulted in the establishment of a PHC 
network in Iran. Talented actors, clear content with agreed objectives and a 
top-down approach to the implementation in a special sociopolitical context were 
the main influential factors to fulfillment of the PHC policy in Iran. However, 
full implementation of the policy was hampered by the failure of some main 
components like referral system.
CONCLUSION: The policy triangle framework helped us to separate the different 
components of the PHC policy denoting that successful implementation of a policy 
requires attention to all related elements. Policy actors should invest in the 
development of an effective advocacy coalition, while giving ample attention to 
the implementation concerns. National health policies can be materialized even 
during financial hardships, if they align with the wider expectations of the 
public and politicians.

PURPOSE: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in patients with chronic heart failure 
(CHF) has met with resistance from third-party payers in low- and middle-income 
countries because of lack of evidence regarding its cost-effectiveness. We aimed 
to provide information to help better inform this decision-making process.
METHODS: Costs associated with a 12-week exercise-based rehabilitation program 
in Colombia for patients with CHF were estimated. We collected data on all 
medical resources used in ambulatory care and data on hospital costs incurred 
for treating patients with uncompensated CHF. A literature search to establish 
the hospitalization rates because of uncompensated CHF, death because of CHF, 
and potential decreases in these data because of the utilization of CR was 
conducted. We modeled incremental costs and effectiveness over a period of 5 
years from the perspective of the third-party payer.
RESULTS: All costs were converted from Colombian pesos to US dollars. For an 
exercise-based CR program of 12-week duration (36 sessions), costs ranged from 
US$265 to US$369 per patient. Monthly costs associated with ambulatory care of 
CHF averaged US$128 ± US$321 per patient, and hospitalization costs were US$3621 
± US$5 444 per event. Yearly hospitalization incidence rates with and without CR 
were 0.154 and 0.216, respectively. The incremental cost of CR would be US$998 
per additional quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity analysis did not 
significantly change these results.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac rehabilitation in patients with CHF in settings such as 
Colombia can be a cost-effective strategy, with minimal incremental costs and 
better quality of life, mainly because of decreased rates of hospitalization.

The Evolution of the Age at Menarche from Prehistorical to Modern Times.

Hospital, Athens, Greece. Electronic address: anpapad@med.uoa.gr.

Menarche denotes the onset of the female reproductive capacity. The age that 
menarche occurs is mostly attributed to the interaction of genetics and various 
environmental factors. Herein, the author describes the evolution of the age at 
menarche from prehistoric to the present times. Data from skeletal remains 
suggest that in the Paleolithic woman menarche occurred at an age between 7 and 
13 years, early sexual maturation being a trade-off for reduced life expectancy. 
In the classical, as well as in the medieval years, the age at menarche was 
generally reported to be at approximately 14 years, with a range from 12 to 
15 years. A significant retardation of the age at menarche occurred in the 
beginning of the modern times, soon after the industrial revolution, due to the 
deterioration of the living conditions, with most studies reporting menarche to 
occur at 15-16 years. In the 20th century, especially in the second half of it, 
in the industrialized countries, the age at menarche decreased significantly, as 
a result of the improvement of the socioeconomic conditions, occurring at 
12-13 years. In the present times, in the developed countries, this trend seems 
to slow down or level off.

An integrated environmental health impact assessment of road transport in New 
Zealand was carried out, using a rapid assessment. The disease and injury burden 
was assessed from traffic-related accidents, air pollution, noise and physical 
(in)activity, and impacts attributed back to modal source. In total, road 
transport was found to be responsible for 650 deaths in 2012 (2.1% of annual 
mortality): 308 from traffic accidents, 283 as a result of air pollution, and 59 
from noise. Together with morbidity, these represent a total burden of disease 
of 26,610 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). An estimated 40 deaths and 
1874 DALYs were avoided through active transport. Cars are responsible for about 
52% of attributable deaths, but heavy goods vehicles (6% of vehicle kilometres 
travelled, vkt) accounted for 21% of deaths. Motorcycles (1 per cent of vkt) are 
implicated in nearly 8% of deaths. Overall, impacts of traffic-related air 
pollution and noise are low compared to other developed countries, but road 
accident rates are high. Results highlight the need for policies targeted at 
road accidents, and especially at heavy goods vehicles and motorcycles, along 
with more general action to reduce the reliance on private road transport. The 
study also provides a framework for national indicator development.

BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy means growing numbers of elderly survive 
the critical age for cardiac and vascular diseases only to later experience 
cancer and dementia.
OBJECTIVES: Of the types of cancer affecting men, prostate cancer continues to 
be diagnosed early by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. The clinical 
relevance and quality of life of those affected must be critically judged. 
Depending on life expectancy, active surveillance (AS) and watchful waiting (WW) 
will be increasingly used in geriatric patients. Risk stratification as guided 
by CGA facilitates the therapeutic decisions of urologists and spares metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer patients from unnecessary and adverse 
overtreatment. By 2030, approximately 1.8 million people will have dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, in the future, the health care system will have to treat an 
aging population, which will require the creation of increasing numbers of 
geriatric hospital departments and cooperative models between geriatrics and 
other specialties. The future training of medical students and continuing 
medical education must also be further developed to include aspects on aging. 
Only in this manner will it be possible to effectively confront the challenges 
associated with demographic change in the specialty of geriatrics.

BACKGROUND: There are different types of information on men's health in older 
age. High morbidity burden is offset by subjective assessments of "very good" 
and "good" health by 52% of men over 65 years.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess the health situation of seniors 
from official publications and public health reports. How can the quality of 
life in our male population be positively influenced so that they can actively 
participate in society in old age.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on the health of seniors and burden of 
disease were taken from men's health reports and official publications from the 
Robert-Koch-Institute, the Federal Statistical Office, and the IHME Institute of 
the USA according to age groups and gender.
RESULTS: Burden of disease in seniors is influenced by one's own health behavior 
and the social situation. The increase in life expectancy of seniors is 
characterized by longer life with chronic conditions. Official statistics 
indicate that about 50% of seniors are affected by disease or severe disability, 
while 50% assess their health status as "very good" or "good".
CONCLUSIONS: Aging of the population requires diverse health promotion 
activities. Parallel with the inevitable increased multimorbidity in the 
elderly, maintaining and increase of physical fitness is required so that 
seniors have a positive "subjective health" or "wellbeing".

BACKGROUND: The effect of population aging on future health services use depends 
on the relationship between longevity gains and health. Whether further gains in 
life expectancy will be paired by improvements in health is uncertain. We 
therefore analyze the effect of population ageing on health services use under 
different health scenarios. We focus on the possibly diverging trends between 
different dimensions of health and their effect on health services use.
METHODS: Using longitudinal data on health and health services use, a latent 
Markov model has been estimated that includes different dimensions of health. We 
use this model to perform a simulation study and analyze the health dynamics 
that drive the effect of population aging. We simulate three health scenarios on 
the relationship between longevity and health (expansion of morbidity, 
compression of morbidity, and the dynamic equilibrium scenario). We use the 
scenarios to predict costs of health services use in the Netherlands between 
2010 and 2050.
RESULTS: Hospital use is predicted to decline after 2040, whereas long-term care 
will continue to rise up to 2050. Considerable differences in expenditure growth 
rates between scenarios with the same life expectancy but different trends in 
health are found. Compression of morbidity generally leads to the lowest growth. 
The effect of additional life expectancy gains within the same health scenario 
is relatively small for hospital care, but considerable for long-term care.
CONCLUSIONS: By comparing different health scenarios resulting in the same life 
expectancy, we show that health improvements do contain costs when they decrease 
morbidity but not mortality. This suggests that investing in healthy aging can 
contribute to containing health expenditure growth.

BACKGROUND: Most biomolecular reaction modeling tools allow users to build 
models with a single list of parameter values. However, a common scenario 
involves different parameterizations of the model to account for the results of 
related experiments, for example, to define the phenotypes for a variety of 
mutations (gene knockout, over expression, etc.) of a specific biochemical 
network. This scenario is not well supported by existing model editors, forcing 
the user to manually generate, store, and maintain many variations of the same 
model.
RESULTS: We developed an extension to our modeling editor called the JigCell Run 
Manager (JC-RM). JC-RM allows the modeler to define a hierarchy of parameter 
values, simulations, and plot settings, and to save them together with the 
initial model. JC-RM supports generation of simulation plots, as well as export 
to COPASI and SBML (L3V1) for further analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Developing a model with its initial list of parameter values is 
just the first step in modeling a biological system. Models are often 
parameterized in many different ways to account for mutations of the organism 
and/or for sets of related experiments performed on the organism. JC-RM offers 
two critical features: it supports the everyday management of a large model, 
complete with its parameterizations, and it facilitates sharing this information 
before and after publication. JC-RM allows the modeler to define a hierarchy of 
parameter values, simulation, and plot settings, and to maintain a relationship 
between this hierarchy and the initial model. JC-RM is implemented in Java and 
uses the COPASI API. JC-RM runs on all major operating systems, with minimal 
system requirements. Installers, source code, user manual, and examples can be 
found at the COPASI website ( http://www.copasi.org/Projects ).

We present a quantitative economic benefit-cost analysis of 2 secondary 
prevention targets that are part of the World Health Organization's Global 
Monitoring Framework for noncommunicable diseases (NCD). These targets are 
expected to contribute to the achievement of the overall NCD target proposed for 
the Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goal Framework. We estimate that 
interventions would need to avert roughly 6 million to 7 million NCD deaths 
worldwide in 2030 to meet the target. We calculate that the combination of 
tobacco taxation that achieves 50% reduction in use and 70% coverage of 
high-risk populations with a multidrug regimen can provide one-half of that 
mortality reduction in 2030, at a benefit-cost ratio of 7:1, or U.S. $7 in 
benefits for each U.S. $1 in cost.

The aging anesthesiologist.

Katz JD(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Anesthesiology, Yale University School of Medicine. New Haven, 
Connecticut, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The average age of anesthesiologists in the USA is 
increasing. Advancing age is accompanied by challenges and opportunities to the 
individual anesthesiologist and his/her colleagues. This article will discuss 
the science behind policies to assure continued competence among these aging 
physicians and safety for their patients.
RECENT FINDINGS: There is growing evidence that aging anesthesiologists may be 
advantaged by a lifetime of experience but possibly disadvantaged under certain 
circumstances by lapses in current medical knowledge contributing to medical 
errors. Policies and procedures are emerging to assist in evaluating the 
continued competence of aging physicians.
SUMMARY: The average age of practicing anesthesiologists in the USA is 
increasing. As physicians continue to practice into later years, it is critical 
that innovative continuing medical education programs and objective evaluations 
of clinical skills and competence focused upon this group continue to be 
developed to assure public safety.

(2)DePaul University, University of Illinois, and DeNova Research, Chicago, 
Illinois.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this six-month, randomized, double-blind, 
multi-center, placebo-controlled study was to determine if the administration of 
a new oral supplement will promote terminal hair growth.
DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind study.
SETTING: Two private practices (dermatology and facial plastics).
PARTICIPANTS: Women 21 to 75 years of age with self-perceived thinning hair.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in terminal and 
vellus hairs in a 4cm(2) target area of the scalp after 90 and 180 days of 
treatment. Secondary endpoints were change in hair diameter and responses to 
Quality of Life and Self-Assessment questionnaires.
RESULTS: Subjects treated with the new oral supplement achieved a significant 
increase in the number of baseline terminal hairs at 90 and 180 days (for each, 
p<0.0001, respectively) and were significantly greater then placebo (p<0.0001). 
Treatment with the new oral supplement was also associated with a significant 
increase in baseline terminal hair diameter after 90 (p=0.006) and 180 days of 
treatment (p=0.001) which was significantly greater than placebo at the end of 
the study (p=0.003). Improvements in hair growth and hair diameter were 
associated with significant improvement in most responses to Self-Assessment and 
Quality of Life Questionnaire responses. There were no adverse events.
CONCLUSION: The daily administration of a new oral supplement was associated 
with significant increases in the number of terminal and vellus hairs and hair 
diameter. Most study participants believed the use of the oral supplement 
resulted in significant improvement in skin and hair quality and quality of 
life.

BACKGROUND: The application of early cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis 
remains inconsistent across hospitals worldwide. Given the constrained nature of 
health care spending, careful consideration of costs relative to the clinical 
consequences of alternative treatments should support decision making. We 
present a cost-utility analysis comparing alternative time frames of 
cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis.
STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model with a 5-year time horizon was developed to compare 
costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained from 3 alternative 
management strategies for the treatment of acute cholecystitis: early 
cholecystectomy (within 7 days of presentation), delayed elective 
cholecystectomy (8 to 12 weeks from presentation), and watchful waiting, where 
cholecystectomy is performed urgently only if recurrent symptoms arise. Model 
inputs were selected to reflect patients with uncomplicated acute 
cholecystitis-without concurrent common bile duct obstruction, pancreatitis, or 
severe sepsis. Real-world outcome probability and cost estimates included in the 
model were derived from analysis of population-based administrative databases 
for the province of Ontario, Canada. The QALY values were derived from utilities 
identified in published literature. Parameter uncertainty was evaluated through 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Early cholecystectomy was less costly (C$6,905 per person) and more 
effective (4.20 QALYs per person) than delayed cholecystectomy (C$8,511; 4.18 
QALYs per person) or watchful waiting (C$7,274; 3.99 QALYs per person). 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed early cholecystectomy was the 
preferred management in 72% of model iterations, given a cost-effectiveness 
threshold of C$50,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: This cost-utility analysis suggests early cholecystectomy is the 
optimal management of uncomplicated acute cholecystitis. Furthermore, deferring 
surgery until recurrent symptoms arise is associated with the worst clinical 
outcomes.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem disease associated with an 
overall reduction in life expectancy due to the possible occurrence of different 
life-threatening conditions. Subjects affected by TSC are, in fact, at risk of 
hydrocephalus secondary to the growth of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, 
or of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Other nonneurological 
life-threatening conditions include abdominal bleeding owing to renal 
angiomyolipomas rupture, renal insufficiency due to progressive parenchymal 
destruction by multiple cysts, pulmonary complications due to 
lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and cardiac failure or arrhythmias secondary to 
rhabdomyomas. In the last decades, there has been a great progress in 
understanding the pathophysiology of TSC-related manifestations, which are 
mainly linked to the hyperactivation of the so-called mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, as a consequence of the mutation in 1 of the 2 genes 
TSC1 or TSC2. This led to the development of new treatment strategies for this 
disease. In fact, it is now available as a biologically targeted therapy with 
everolimus, a selective mTOR inhibitor, which has been licensed in Europe and 
USA for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and 
angiomyolipomas in subjects with TSC. This drug also proved to benefit other 
TSC-related manifestations, including pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, 
cardiac rhabdomyomas, and presumably epileptic seizures. mTOR inhibitors are 
thus proving to be a systemic therapy able to simultaneously address different 
and potentially life-threatening complications, giving the hope of improving 
life expectation in individuals with TSC.

OBJECTIVE: In patients with a long life expectancy with high-risk (HR) prostate 
cancer (PCa), the chance to die from PCa is not negligible and may change 
significantly according to the time elapsed from surgery. The aim of this study 
was to evaluate long-term survival patterns in young patients treated with 
radical prostatectomy (RP) for HRPCa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Within a multiinstitutional cohort, 600 young patients 
(≤59 years) treated with RP between 1987 and 2012 for HRPCa (defined as at least 
one of the following adverse characteristics: prostate specific antigen>20, cT3 
or higher, biopsy Gleason sum 8-10) were identified. Smoothed cumulative 
incidence plot was performed to assess cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and other 
cause mortality (OCM) rates at 10, 15, and 20 years after RP. The same analyses 
were performed to assess the 5-year probability of CSM and OCM in patients who 
survived 5, 10, and 15 years after RP. A multivariable competing risk regression 
model was fitted to identify predictors of CSM and OCM.
RESULTS: The 10-, 15- and 20-year CSM and OCM rates were 11.6% and 5.5% vs. 
15.5% and 13.5% vs. 18.4% and 19.3%, respectively. The 5-year probability of CSM 
and OCM rates among patients who survived at 5, 10, and 15 years after RP, were 
6.4% and 2.7% vs. 4.6% and 9.6% vs. 4.2% and 8.2%, respectively. Year of 
surgery, pathological stage and Gleason score, surgical margin status and lymph 
node invasion were the major determinants of CSM (all P≤0.03). Conversely, none 
of the covariates was significantly associated with OCM (all P≥ 0.09).
CONCLUSIONS: Very long-term cancer control in young high-risk patients after RP 
is highly satisfactory. The probability of dying from PCa in young patients is 
the leading cause of death during the first 10 years of survivorship after RP. 
Thereafter, mortality not related to PCa became the main cause of death. 
Consequently, surgery should be consider among young patients with high-risk 
disease and strict PCa follow-up should enforce during the first 10 years of 
survivorship after RP.

Cell migration is critical for cell differentiation, tissue formation and organ 
development. Several mechanisms come to play in the process of cell migration, 
orchestrating changes in cell polarity, adhesion, process extension and 
motility. Recent findings have shown that gap junctions, and specifically 
connexin43 (Cx43), can play a significant role in these processes, impacting 
adhesion and cytoskeletal rearrangements. Thus Cx43 within a cell regulates its 
motility and migration via intracellular signaling. Furthermore, Cx43 in the 
host cells can impact the degree of cellular migration through that tissue. 
Similarities in these connexin-based processes account for both neural 
progenitor migration in the developing brain, and for glioma cell invasion in 
the mature brain. In both cases, Cx43 in the tissue ("soil") in which cells 
("seeds") exist facilitates their migration and, for glioma cells, tissue 
invasion. Cx43 mediates these effects through channel- and non-channel-dependent 
mechanisms which have similarities in both paradigms of cell migration. This 
provides insight into developmental processes and pathological situations, as 
well as possible therapeutic approaches regarding specific functional domains of 
gap junction proteins.

Value of innovation for hematologic malignancies.

Monia M(1).

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Several novel drugs are dramatically improving both lifespan and 
quality-of-life of patients with blood cancers.
AIM: Prolonged disease duration and increased treatment costs for hematologic 
malignancies impose a relevant economic burden onto healthcare services, despite 
the low incidence of blood cancers. Therefore, an appropriate paradigm for 
valuing 'innovation' is urgently required in order to refine pricing and 
reimbursement decisions. Cost-per-QALY-gained is still the standard metric for 
assessing the 'incremental' value of new drugs; however, the high number of 
'comparator' therapies and the huge variety of treatment sequences make plain 
two-treatment comparisons sub-optimal, while multiple-treatment and 
multiple-sequence comparisons require complex and less-transparent decision 
models. A repository of standard backbones for decision models might allow 
benchmarking and comparability among cost-effectiveness analyses; however, an 
international effort is required to build it up.
RESULTS: Deontology recommends that hematologists act in optimizing healthcare 
resources while preserving patient-physician alliance, but clinical practice 
guidelines do not support doctors in balancing cost against clinical outcomes. 
Decision models of chronic blood cancers unexpectedly proved that cost might be 
an appropriate value for innovation if treatments avoided severe toxicity and 
further lines of treatments, despite the eventually long duration of treatment 
and the competing risk of death due to comorbidity and old age.
CONCLUSION: The improved transparency of decision models allows sharing of 
relevant structural and analytic parameters (i.e., time horizon, comparator 
treatments, hierarchy of end-point, assumptions, source of data, sub-group 
analyses) by stakeholders, physicians and patients, making health economics a 
noble 'translator' of values for innovation.

CONTEXT: Because of high symptom burden, numerous comorbidities, and shortened 
life expectancy, dialysis patients are increasingly recognized as appropriate 
candidates for early and continuous supportive care.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to describe dialysis 
professionals' perceptions of the adequacy of supportive care in dialysis 
centers, barriers to providing it, suggestions for improving it, and familiarity 
with the existing evidence-based resources for supportive care of dialysis 
patients.
METHODS: The Coalition for Supportive Care of Kidney Patients conducted an 
online survey of dialysis professionals and administrators solicited through the 
18 End-Stage Renal Disease Networks and the Renal Physicians Association.
RESULTS: Only 4.5% of 487 respondents believed their dialysis centers were 
presently providing high-quality supportive care. They identified bereavement 
support, spiritual support, and end-of-life care discussions as the top three 
unmet needs. They reported that lack of a predictive algorithm for prognosis was 
the top barrier, and "guidelines to help with decision-making in seriously ill 
patients" was the top priority to improve supportive care. A majority of 
respondents were unaware that an evidence-based validated prognostic model and a 
clinical practice guideline to help with decision-making were already available.
CONCLUSION: Dialysis professionals report significant unmet supportive care 
needs and barriers in their centers with only a small minority rating themselves 
as competently providing supportive care. There is an urgent need for education 
of dialysis professionals about available supportive care resources to provide 
quality supportive care to dialysis patients.

BACKGROUND: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a treatment option for 
single-compartment knee osteoarthritis. Robotic assistance may improve survival 
rates of UKA, but the cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted UKA is unknown. The 
purpose of this study was to delineate the revision rate, hospital volume, and 
robotic system costs for which this technology would be cost-effective.
METHODS: We created a Markov decision analysis to evaluate the costs, outcomes, 
and incremental cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted UKA in 64-year-old patients 
with end-stage unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis.
RESULTS: Robot-assisted UKA was more costly than traditional UKA, but offered a 
slightly better outcome with 0.06 additional quality-adjusted life-years at an 
incremental cost of $47,180 per quality-adjusted life-years, given a case volume 
of 100 cases annually. The system was cost-effective when case volume exceeded 
94 cases per year, 2-year failure rates were below 1.2%, and total system costs 
were <$1.426 million.
CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted UKA is cost-effective compared with traditional UKA 
when annual case volume exceeds 94 cases per year. It is not cost-effective at 
low-volume or medium-volume arthroplasty centers.

Availability of health services vs. health condition of residents of rural areas 
in Poland - Analysis performed on the basis of EHIS 2009.

University of Lodz, Poland.

INTRODUCTION: One of the aspects considered in a debate preceding the 
establishment of the new retirement age in Poland, was the health condition of 
the Polish population. A steady increase in the average life expectancy, 
observed for several years, is much higher in the cities than in the country. 
One of the reasons for this might be a limited availability of health services 
in rural areas.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to assess the scale of income-related 
inequalities in the access to health services in rural areas, and subsequently 
to assess the impact of having to give up some medical services on the 
subjective perception of health condition by rural inhabitants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individual data derived from the European Health 
Interview Survey (EHIS) conducted in 2009 constituted the basis for the 
presented analysis. The concentration index was used to measure the 
income-related inequalities in the use of medical services. The ordered logit 
model was used to verify the hypothesis that the availability of health services 
has an impact on the health condition.
RESULTS: Significant differences in the distribution of medical services 
utilization with regard to income, were found only in the case of hospital 
services. People with low income stay in hospital more often. The obtained 
inequality indices show a lack of income-related inequality in the use of 
outpatient services. The performed analyses confirm a negative impact of giving 
up this type of services on the health condition of residents of rural areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The availability of medical services is an important determinant of 
the health condition. Too few medical institutions and scarce medical personnel 
limits the use of these services, and not only for people with low income.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of delayed-release dimethyl fumarate 
(DMF, also known as gastro-resistant DMF), an effective therapy for relapsing 
forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), compared with glatiramer acetate and 
fingolimod, commonly used treatments in the US.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed comparing delayed-release DMF to 
glatiramer acetate and fingolimod using a US payer perspective and 20-year time 
horizon. A cohort of patients, mean age 38 years, with relapsing-remitting MS 
and Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0-6 entered 
the model. Efficacy and safety were estimated by mixed-treatment comparison of 
data from the DEFINE and CONFIRM trials and clinical trials of other 
disease-modifying therapies. Data from published studies were used to derive 
resource use, cost, and utility inputs. Key outcomes included costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. 
Alternative scenarios tested in a sensitivity analysis included drug efficacy, 
EDSS-related or relapse-related costs, alternative perspectives, drug 
acquisition costs, and utility.
RESULTS: Base-case results with a 20-year time horizon indicated that 
delayed-release DMF increased QALYs +0.450 or +0.359 compared with glatiramer 
acetate or fingolimod, respectively. Reductions in 20-year costs with 
delayed-release DMF were -$70,644 compared with once-daily glatiramer acetate 
and -$32,958 compared with fingolimod. In an analysis comparing delayed-release 
DMF to three-times-weekly glatiramer acetate and assuming similar efficacy and 
safety to the once-daily formulation, 20-year costs with delayed-release DMF 
were increased by $15,806 and cost per QALY gained was $35,142. The differences 
in costs were most sensitive to acquisition cost and inclusion of informal care 
costs and productivity losses. The differences in QALYs were most sensitive to 
the impact of delayed-release DMF on disease progression and the EDSS utility 
weights.
CONCLUSION: Delayed-release DMF is likely to increase QALYs for patients with 
relapsing forms of MS and be cost-effective compared with fingolimod and 
glatiramer acetate.

The purpose of this study was to investigate a range of selected physical 
measures for their relative contributions and extent to which they may explain 
the performance of the Timed "Up and Go" test (TUG) in a sample of healthy older 
adults. The participants where 194 adults aged 65 and older with no cognitive 
impairment and independent in their daily activities from local senior centres 
and a geriatric nursing home in Valencia, Spain. Age, body mass index (BMI), 
TUG, Berg balance scale (BBS), One-leg stand test (OLS), grip strength, chair 
stand test (STS-5), knee extension strength and rectus femoris cross-sectional 
area (CSA) where measured. Moderate to high significant associations were found 
between the TUG performance and BBS and knee extension strength (r = -.561 and 
-.397). A stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the BBS was a 
significant and independent predictor (AdjR(2) = .373) for the TUG performance. 
The TUG is highly correlated with the BBS score and knee extension strength, 
measures that represent common performance tasks in everyday life. The BBS was 
demonstrated to be the most significant factor explaining the TUG performance. 
The TUG is demonstrated to be a useful tool for predicting changes in functional 
balance measured with the BBS. The mobility decline may be better explained as 
the sum of deficits across multiple domains rather than as a single entity. 
Clinicians would benefit of those findings by a better understanding of the 
physical measures, in addition to designing more accurate interventions focusing 
on the enhancement of mobility.
