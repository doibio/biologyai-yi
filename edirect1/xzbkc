BACKGROUND: There is clinical uncertainty of the benefits and costs of different 
treatment options for children with Down syndrome who have glue ear. This study 
was designed to assess the extent of this lack of knowledge and determine if 
pursuing further information would be practical, beneficial and cost-effective.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the level and practical effect of current uncertainty 
around treatment options for children with Down syndrome and glue ear. To assess 
the feasibility of studying the options for management of glue ear in children 
with Down syndrome via a randomised controlled trial (RCT) or multicentre 
prospective cohort study by evaluating the willingness of (1) parents to agree 
to randomisation for their children and (2) clinicians to recruit participants 
to a definitive study. To undertake value of information analyses to demonstrate 
the potential economic benefit from undertaking further research.
DESIGN: A feasibility study exploring the views of parents of children with Down 
syndrome and professionals who have responsibility for the health and education 
of children with Down syndrome, on the participation in, and value of, future 
research into interventions for glue ear. Data were collected from parents via 
self-completed questionnaires, face-to-face interviews and focus groups and from 
professionals via online questionnaires and a Delphi review exercise. 
Development of economic models to represent clinical pathways of care and a RCT 
informed a value of information (VOI) analysis.
SETTING: UK (professionals); East Midlands region of the UK (parents).
PARTICIPANTS: Parents of children aged 1-11 years with Down syndrome (n = 156). 
Professionals including audiologists, ear, nose and throat surgeons, 
audiological physicians, speech and language therapists, and teachers of the 
deaf (n = 128).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantitative and qualitative data on parental views and 
experiences of glue ear and its effects; interventions and treatment received; 
taking part in research and factors that would encourage or discourage 
participation; and the importance of various outcome domains to them and for 
their children. For professionals: information on caseloads; approaches to 
clinical management; opinions on frequency and significance of the consequences 
of glue ear for this population; importance of different outcome measures; 
opinions of interventions and their role in future research; views on health 
research; facilitators and barriers to recruitment, and participation in 
research involving RCTs.
RESULTS: The complexity of the experience and individual characteristics of 
children with Down syndrome poses challenges for the design of any future 
research but these challenges were not considered by professionals to raise 
sufficient barriers to prevent it being undertaken. Parents were generally 
supportive of the need for, and value of, research but identified practical and 
emotional issues that would need addressing. Glue ear was considered to impact 
more on speech, language and communication than on hearing. Outcome measures for 
future research would need to evaluate these elements but measures should be 
designed specifically for the population. Parents and professionals identified 
randomisation as a significant barrier to participation. The VOI analyses 
identified lack of data as problematic but concluded that a future trial 
involving surgical intervention would be feasible at costs of < £650,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Future research into the benefits of interventions for glue ear in 
children with Down syndrome would be feasible and could be cost-effective but 
should be carefully designed to facilitate and maximise participation from 
parents and professionals responsible for recruitment.

The early life origin theory in the development of cardiovascular disease and 
type 2 diabetes.

Life expectancy has been examined from a variety of perspectives in recent 
history. Epidemiology is one perspective which examines causes of morbidity and 
mortality at the population level. Over the past few 100 years there have been 
dramatic shifts in the major causes of death and expected life length. This 
change has suffered from inconsistency across time and space with vast 
inequalities observed between population groups. In current focus is the 
challenge of rising non-communicable diseases (NCD), such as cardiovascular 
disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the search to discover methods to 
combat the rising incidence of these diseases, a number of new theories on the 
development of morbidity have arisen. A pertinent example is the hypothesis 
published by David Barker in 1995 which postulates the prenatal and early 
developmental origin of adult onset disease, and highlights the importance of 
the maternal environment. This theory has been subject to criticism however it 
has gradually gained acceptance. In addition, the relatively new field of 
epigenetics is contributing evidence in support of the theory. This review aims 
to explore the implication and limitations of the developmental origin 
hypothesis, via an historical perspective, in order to enhance understanding of 
the increasing incidence of NCDs, and facilitate an improvement in planning 
public health policy.

BACKGROUND: Surgically treatable diseases contribute approximately 11% of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide yet they remain a neglected 
public health priority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Pediatric 
inguinal hernia is the most common congenital abnormality in newborns and a 
major cause of morbidity and mortality yet elective repair remains largely 
unavailable in LMICs. This study is aimed to determine the costs and 
cost-effectiveness of pediatric inguinal hernia repair (PIHR) in a low-resource 
setting.
METHODS: Medical costs of consecutive elective PIHRs were recorded prospectively 
at two centers in Uganda. Decision modeling was used to compare two different 
treatment scenarios (adoption of PIHR and non-adoption) from a provider 
perspective. A Markov model was constructed to estimate health outcomes under 
each scenario. The robustness of the cost-effectiveness results in the base case 
analysis was tested in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The 
primary outcome of interest was cost per DALY averted by the intervention.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine PIHRs were performed in 65 children (mean age 3.6 years). 
Mean cost per procedure was $86.68 US (95% CI 83.1-90.2 USD) and averted an 
average of 5.7 DALYs each. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $12.41 per 
DALY averted. The probability of cost-effectiveness was 95% at a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of $35 per averted DALY. Results were robust to 
sensitivity analysis under all considered scenarios.
CONCLUSION: Elective PIHR is highly cost-effective for the treatment and 
prevention of complications of hernia disease even in low-resource settings. 
PIHR should be prioritized in LMICs alongside other cost-effective 
interventions.

Cost-utility of cognitive behavioral therapy versus U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration recommended drugs and usual care in the treatment of patients 
with fibromyalgia: an economic evaluation alongside a 6-month randomized 
controlled trial.

INTRODUCTION: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-recommended pharmacologic treatments (RPTs; pregabalin, 
duloxetine, and milnacipran) are effective treatment options for fibromyalgia 
(FM) syndrome and are currently recommended by clinical guidelines. We compared 
the cost-utility from the healthcare and societal perspectives of CBT versus RPT 
(combination of pregabalin + duloxetine) and usual care (TAU) groups in the 
treatment of FM.
METHODS: The economic evaluation was conducted alongside a 6-month, multicenter, 
randomized, blinded, parallel group, controlled trial. In total, 168 FM patients 
from 41 general practices in Zaragoza (Spain) were randomized to CBT (n = 57), 
RPT (n = 56), or TAU (n = 55). The main outcome measures were Quality-Adjusted 
Life Years (QALYs, assessed by using the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire) and 
improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL, assessed by using 
EuroQoL-5D visual analogue scale, EQ-VAS). The costs of healthcare use were 
estimated from patient self-reports (Client Service Receipt Inventory). 
Cost-utility was assessed by using the net-benefit approach and 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs).
RESULTS: On average, the total costs per patient in the CBT group (1,847 €) were 
significantly lower than those in patients receiving RPT (3,664 €) or TAU (3,124 
€). Patients receiving CBT reported a higher quality of life (QALYs and EQ-VAS 
scores); the differences between groups were significant only for EQ-VAS. From a 
complete case-analysis approach (base case), the point estimates of the 
cost-effectiveness ratios resulted in dominance for the CBT group in all of the 
comparisons performed, by using both QALYs and EQ-VAS as outcomes. These 
findings were confirmed by bootstrap analyses, net-benefit curves, and CEACs. 
Two additional sensitivity analyses (intention-to-treat analysis and 
per-protocol analysis) indicated that the results were robust. The comparison of 
RPT with TAU yielded no clear preference for either treatment when using QALYs, 
although RPT was determined to be more cost-effective than TAU when evaluating 
EQ-VAS.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of lower costs, CBT is the most cost-effective treatment 
for adult FM patients. Implementation in routine medical care would require 
policymakers to develop more-widespread public access to trained and experienced 
therapists in group-based forms of CBT.

The increasing average life expectancy is simultaneously increasing the 
incidence of chronic diseases and the number of healthy elderly people, 
consequently leading to an increased demand for healthcare management methods 
that do not involve hospital visits. The development of health management 
services involving mobile phones will change the focus of medical services from 
hospital visits and treatments to managing the health decisions made by 
individuals in their daily lives. However, the elderly may experience specific 
difficulties in adapting to constantly evolving services. This study reviews 
various health-related devices such as mobile phones that are available for 
providing healthcare to the elderly, and the different ways of using them. As 
the use of mobile phone increases, it is expected that elderly mobile phone 
users will also be able to regularly check their health status at any time and 
place. The issues of an ageing population pertain to the entire society rather 
than only to the elderly, which make mobile-phone-based medical informatics as a 
health management service a worthy goal.

The elderly population is increasing rapidly in Taiwan. With the average life 
expectancy on the rise, the elderly have become major consumers of healthcare 
products and services. Factors that influence respect for autonomy, a core value 
of medical ethics, may be related to family, society, and the medical culture. 
Especially in patients who are already elderly, aging causes declines in 
physical, mental and societal capacities. Practicing a respect for patient 
autonomy is particularly challenging for healthcare professionals in Taiwan due 
the unique culture background of elderly Taiwanese patients. This article 
reviews and integrates the literature related to the issue of patient autonomy 
and elaborates on medical decision-making among elderly patients in Taiwan in 
the contexts of: the disadvantages faced by the elderly, the background of 
Chinese culture, and the current medical decision-making environment. A few 
suggestions are proposed to help preserve the medical-decision-making autonomy 
of elderly patients in Taiwan.

Identification of palmitoyltransferase and thioesterase enzymes that control the 
subcellular localization of axon survival factor nicotinamide mononucleotide 
adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2).

The NAD-synthesizing enzyme nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 
(NMNAT2) is a critical survival factor for axons and its constant supply from 
neuronal cell bodies into axons is required for axon survival in primary culture 
neurites and axon extension in vivo. Recently, we showed that palmitoylation is 
necessary to target NMNAT2 to post-Golgi vesicles, thereby influencing its 
protein turnover and axon protective capacity. Here we find that NMNAT2 is a 
substrate for cytosolic thioesterases APT1 and APT2 and that 
palmitoylation/depalmitoylation dynamics are on a time scale similar to its 
short half-life. Interestingly, however, depalmitoylation does not release 
NMNAT2 from membranes. The mechanism of palmitoylation-independent membrane 
attachment appears to be mediated by the same minimal domain required for 
palmitoylation itself. Furthermore, we identify several zDHHC 
palmitoyltransferases that influence NMNAT2 palmitoylation and subcellular 
localization, among which a role for zDHHC17 (HIP14) in neuronal NMNAT2 
palmitoylation is best supported by our data. These findings shed light on the 
enzymatic regulation of NMNAT2 palmitoylation and highlight individual 
thioesterases and palmitoyltransferases as potential targets to modulate 
NMNAT2-dependent axon survival.

Cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec compared with insulin glargine in a 
basal-bolus regimen in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus in the UK.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
insulin degludec (IDeg) vs insulin glargine (IGlar) as part of a basal-bolus 
treatment regimen in adults with T1DM, using a short-term economic model.
METHODS: Data from two phase III clinical studies were used to populate a simple 
and transparent short-term model. The costs and effects of treatment with IDeg 
vs IGlar were calculated over a 12-month period. The analysis was conducted from 
the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to assess the degree of uncertainty surrounding the results. The main 
outcome measure, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), was the cost 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: IDeg is a cost-effective treatment option vs IGlar in patients with 
T1DM on a basal-bolus regimen. The base case ICER was estimated at £16,895/QALY, 
which is below commonly accepted thresholds for cost-effectiveness in the UK. 
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the ICER was stable to variations in the 
majority of input parameters. The parameters that exerted the most influence on 
the ICER were hypoglycemia event rates, daily insulin dose, and disutility 
associated with non-severe nocturnal hypoglycemic events. However, even under 
extreme assumptions in the majority of analyses the ICERs remained below the 
commonly accepted threshold of £20,000-£30,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: This short-term modeling approach accommodates the treat-to-target 
trial design required by regulatory bodies, and focuses on the impact of 
important aspects of insulin therapy such as hypoglycemia and dosing. For 
patients with T1DM who are treated with a basal-bolus insulin regimen, IDeg is a 
cost-effective treatment option compared with IGlar. IDeg may be particularly 
cost-effective for sub-groups of patients, such as those suffering from 
recurrent nocturnal hypoglycemia and those with impaired awareness of 
hypoglycemia.

Odontoid fracture biomechanics.

Ivancic PC(1).

Author information:
(1)From the Biomechanics Research Laboratory, Department of Orthopaedics and 
Rehabilitation, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.

STUDY DESIGN: In vitro biomechanical study.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate mechanisms of odontoid fracture.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Odontoid fractures in younger adults occur most 
often due to high-energy trauma including motor vehicle crashes and in older 
adults due to fall from standing height.
METHODS: Horizontally aligned head impacts into a padded barrier were simulated 
using a human upper cervical spine specimen (occiput through C3) mounted to a 
surrogate torso mass on a sled and carrying a surrogate head. We divided 13 
specimens into 3 groups on the basis of head impact location: upper forehead in 
the midline, upper lateral side of the forehead, and upper lateral side of the 
head. Post-impact fluoroscopy and anatomical dissection documented the injuries. 
Time-history biomechanical responses were determined.
RESULTS: Four of the 5 specimens subjected to impact to the upper forehead in 
the midline sustained type II or high type III odontoid fractures due to abrupt 
deceleration of the head and continued forward torso momentum. Average peak 
force reached 1787.1 N at the neck at 50.3 milliseconds. Subsequently, the 
motion peaks occurred for the head relative to C3 reaching 15.2° for extension, 
2.1 cm for upward translation, and 5.3 cm for horizontal compression, between 62 
and 68 milliseconds.
CONCLUSION: We identified impact to the upper forehead in the midline as a 
mechanism that produced odontoid fracture and associated atlas and ligamentous 
injuries similar to those observed in real-life trauma. We were not able to 
create odontoid fractures during impacts to the upper lateral side of the 
forehead or upper lateral side of the head. Dynamic odontoid fracture was caused 
by rapid deceleration of the head, which transferred load inferiorly combined 
with continued torso momentum, which caused spinal compression and anterior 
shear force and forward displacement of the axis relative to the atlas.

Hospital, London, United Kingdom.

OBJECTIVES: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective method of relieving 
chronic intractable pain, and one of its key indications is failed back surgery 
syndrome (FBSS). The objective of the current study was to evaluate the cost 
effectiveness of 10 kHz high-frequency SCS (HF10 SCS) compared to conventional 
medical management (CMM), reoperation, and traditional nonrechargeable (TNR-SCS) 
and rechargeable SCS (TR-SCS).
METHODS: A health economic model of SCS in the United Kingdom was reproduced in 
the perspective of the health care system to simulate costs and quality adjusted 
life years (QALYs) over 15 years. In the model, both a decision tree and the 
Markov model were used to describe the health outcomes of the evaluated 
therapies.
RESULTS: HF10 SCS therapy showed a favorable incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of £3,153 per QALY gained as compared to CMM and established 
dominance (less costly, more QALYs) compared to TNR-SCS (£8,802 per QALY vs. 
CMM) and TR-SCS (£5,101 per QALY vs. CMM).
CONCLUSION: This first analysis of the cost effectiveness of HF10 SCS suggests 
that it is more cost effective and provides a greater number of QALYs than both 
TNR-SCS and TR-SCS.

Science, University of Shizuoka.

A transdermal oil-in-water type emulsified formulation containing propiverine 
hydrochloride, used for treatment of an overactive bladder (OAB), was evaluated 
for in vitro skin permeation under finite conditions and in vivo transdermal 
absorption. Propiverine hydrochloride solubility was determined using 
1,3-butyleneglycol, polyoxyethylene (2) oleylether, isostearyl alcohol, and 
lauryl alcohol. The solubility increased as the solubility parameter value 
increased. In vitro skin permeation in hairless mouse skin and in vivo 
transdermal absorption in rats were measured using propiverine hydrochloride 
dissolved in a simple solution containing these solvents. Dependent on the 
increase in in vitro flux, the in vivo area under the curve up to 72 h (AUC0-72) 
was increased. Therefore, the emulsified formulation was prepared containing 
these ingredients using polyoxyethylene (20) stearylether for optimization. The 
emulsified formulation was used to conduct in vivo single- and repeated-dose 
absorption studies in rats. After single-dose transdermal administration of the 
emulsified formulation, the AUC0-72 was equivalent to that of the simple 
solution. Furthermore, results using the emulsified formulation indicated an 
increase in AUC0-72 and significant extension of the elimination half-life, in 
comparison with oral administration. After repeated-dose administration, a 
significant minimum plasma concentration was observed compared with oral 
administration. These results demonstrate that the emulsified formulation is a 
good option for transdermal delivery of propiverine hydrochloride.

Tokyo, Japan.

OBJECTIVES: For patients with non-traumatic pontine hemorrhage (PH) who will 
survive, determining prognosis is vital for appropriate therapeutic planning in 
the acute stage. This study aimed to determine reliable prognostic factors of 
mortality in patients with PH.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cases of a total of 118 consecutive PH patients were 
reviewed. We compared clinical and radiological characteristics between patients 
who died and survivors by the log-rank test and performed multivariate analysis 
by the Cox proportional hazards model using variables that were marginally or 
significantly associated with PH-related death on the log-rank test (P < 0.20).
RESULTS: The median length of follow-up was 51 days (interquartile range: 7-742 
days). Sixty-six patients (56%) died and 52 (44%) survived during follow-up 
period. Multivariate analysis showed that Glasgow Coma Scale score <9, 
hyperthermia (a core temperature of ≥39°C), maximum hematoma diameter more than 
27 mm, and hematoma extension to midbrain and/or thalamus were significantly 
related to PH-related death. The Kaplan-Meier method showed that patients 
without these four factors had successively longer period at PH-related death 
(21 patients without factors: mean 2900 days; 97 patients with at least one of 
four factors: mean 820 days).
CONCLUSIONS: Promptly identifying PH patients who are most likely die is 
important. The decision to stop life support in patients with PH is difficult, 
but factors, which are shown in this study, may be used to determine the level 
of care.

Tryptophan residues at the dimer interface of the plant photoreceptor UVR8 
promote monomerisation after UV-B absorption via a so far unknown mechanism. 
Using FTIR spectroscopy we assign light-induced structural transitions of UVR8 
mainly to amino acid side chains without major transformations of the secondary 
structure of the physiologically relevant C-terminal extension. Additionally, we 
assign the monomerisation associated increase and red shift of the UVR8 
tryptophan emission to a photoinduced rearrangement of tryptophan side chains 
and a relocation of the aspartic acid residues D96 and D107, respectively. By 
illumination dependent emission spectroscopy we furthermore determined the 
quantum yield of photoinduced monomerisation to 20 ± 8%.

Age-associated changes of nitric oxide concentration dynamics in the central 
nervous system of Fisher 344 rats.

The increase in life expectancy is accompanied by an increased risk of 
developing neurodegenerative disorders and age is the most relevant risk factor 
for the appearance of cognitive decline. While decreased neuronal count has been 
proposed to be a major contributing factor to the appearance of age-associated 
cognitive decline, it appears to be insufficient to fully account for the decay 
in mental function in aged individuals. Nitric oxide ((•)NO) is a ubiquitous 
signaling molecule in the mammalian central nervous system. Closely linked to 
the activation of glutamatergic transmission in several structures of the brain, 
neuron-derived (•)NO can act as a neuromodulator in synaptic plasticity but has 
also been linked to neuronal toxicity and degenerative processes. Many studies 
have proposed that changes in the glutamate-(•)NO signaling pathway may be 
implicated in age-dependent cognitive decline and that the exact effect of such 
changes may be region specific. Due to its peculiar physical-chemical 
properties, namely hydrophobicity, small size, and rapid diffusion properties, 
the rate and pattern of (•)NO concentration changes are critical determinants 
for the understanding of its bioactivity in the brain. Here we show a detailed 
study of how (•)NO concentration dynamics change in the different regions of the 
brain of Fisher 344 rats (F344) during aging. Using microelectrodes inserted 
into the living brain of anesthetized F344 rats, we show here that 
glutamate-induced (•)NO concentration dynamics decrease in the hippocampus, 
striatum, and cerebral cortex as animals age. performance in behavior testing of 
short-term and spatial memory, suggesting that the impairment in the 
glutamate:nNOS pathway represents a functional critical event in cognitive 
decline during aging.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of patients with varicose veins constitutes a 
considerable workload and financial burden to the National Health Service. This 
study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound-guided foam 
sclerotherapy (UGFS) and endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) compared with 
conventional surgery as treatment for primary varicose veins.
METHODS: Participant cost and utility data were collected alongside the UK CLASS 
multicentre randomized clinical trial, which compared EVLA, surgery and UGFS. 
Regression methods were used to estimate the effects of the alternative 
treatments on costs to the health service and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) at 6 months. A Markov model, incorporating available evidence on 
clinical recurrence rates, was developed to extrapolate the trial data over a 
5-year time horizon.
RESULTS: Compared with surgery at 6 months, UGFS and EVLA reduced mean costs to 
the health service by £655 and £160 respectively. When additional overhead costs 
associated with theatre use were included, these cost savings increased to £902 
and £392 respectively. UGFS produced 0·005 fewer QALYs, whereas EVLA produced 
0·011 additional QALYs. Extrapolating to 5 years, EVLA was associated with 
increased costs and QALYs compared with UGFS (costing £3640 per QALY gained), 
and generated a cost saving (£206-439) and QALY gain (0·078) compared with 
surgery. Applying a ceiling willingness-to-pay ratio of £20 000 per QALY gained, 
EVLA had the highest probability (78·7 per cent) of being cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest, for patients considered eligible for all three 
treatment options, that EVLA has the highest probability of being cost-effective 
at accepted thresholds of willingness to pay per QALY.

The use of plasma-derived and recombinant coagulation factors for the treatment 
of haemophilia A and B is well established and permits patients to live a 
relatively normal life. In order to improve treatment options, several products 
are in development, which have a prolonged duration of action, thus enabling 
less frequent prophylactic dosing and aiming to reduce the burden of treatment. 
Several innovative approaches are being pursued to extend the half-life of 
factor VIIa, factor VIII and factor IX, utilising technologies such as Fc 
fusion, recombinant albumin fusion and addition of polyethyleneglycol (PEG) 
(PEGylation). These methods prolong the time in the circulation by reducing 
degradation and elimination. This review summarises the technologies and 
products in development and their stages of development, and also discusses 
their pros and cons.

Drugs for ultra-rare disorders (URDs) rank prominently among the most expensive 
medicines on a cost-per-patient basis. Many of them do not meet conventional 
standards for cost-effectiveness. In light of the high fixed cost of R&D, this 
challenge is inversely related to the prevalence of URDs. The present paper sets 
out to explain the rationale underlying a recent expert consensus on these 
issues, recommending a more rigorous assessment of the clinical effectiveness of 
URDs, applying established standards of evidence-based medicine. This may 
include conditional approval and reimbursement policies, which should be 
combined with a firm expectation of proof of a minimum significant clinical 
benefit within a reasonable time. In contrast, current health economic 
evaluation paradigms fail to adequately reflect normative and empirical concerns 
(i.e., morally defensible 'social preferences') regarding healthcare resource 
allocation. Hence there is a strong need for alternative economic evaluation 
models for URDs.

The increased life expectancy among HIV-infected persons treated with 
combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), risk behaviors, and co-morbidities 
associated with ART place HIV-infected persons at risk for non-HIV-related 
causes of death. We used the San Francisco HIV/AIDS registry to identify deaths 
that occurred from January 1996 through December 2011. Temporal trends in AIDS- 
and non-AIDS-related mortality rates, the proportion of underlying and 
contributory causes of death, and the ratio of observed deaths in the study 
population to expected number of deaths among California men aged 20-79 
(standardized mortality ratio [SMR]) of underlying causes of death were 
examined. A total of 5338 deaths were identified. The annual AIDS-related death 
rate (per 100 deaths) declined from 10.8 in 1996 to 0.9 in 2011 (p<0.0001), 
while the annual death rate from non-AIDS-related causes declined from 2.1 in 
1996 to 0.9 in 2011 (p<0.0001). The proportion of deaths due to all types of 
heart disease combined, all non-AIDS cancers combined, mental disorders 
resulting from substance abuse, drug overdose, suicide and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease increased significantly over time. The SMRs for liver diseased 
decreased significantly over time but remained elevated. Our data highlight the 
importance of age-related causes of death as well as deaths from causes that 
are, at least in part, preventable.

INTRODUCTION: We report the burden of disease and risk factors measured by 
causes of death, years of life lost attributable to premature mortality (YLLs), 
years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) for 1990, 2005, and 2010 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).
METHODS: We used the Global Burden of Diseases 2010 (GBD 2010) methodology to 
estimate the country-level burden of disease in KSA. We used data from 
systematic reviews of the literature, household survey data, antenatal clinic 
surveillance data, reportable disease notifications, disease registries, 
hospital admissions data, outpatient visit data, population-based cancer 
registries, active screening data, and other administrative data.
RESULTS: Noncommunicable diseases and road traffic injuries became the leading 
cause of death and disability in KSA in 2010. Elevated body mass index was the 
leading risk factor for disease (7.02% for males and 4.61% for females in 2010). 
High glucose levels were the second leading disease risk factor for females 
(3.28%) and third for males (6.25%) in 2010. Preterm birth complications were 
the main cause for DALYs in 1990; however, in 2010, the leading cause of DALYs 
for males was road traffic injuries (12.40%) and for females it was major 
depressive disorder (7.88%).
CONCLUSION: KSA is facing a rising burden of noncommunicable diseases and road 
traffic injuries as a result of rapid changes in behaviors. Our results 
demonstrate the need for major intervention to reduce these burdens and to 
engage other sectors of the government and the community in these efforts.

INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is used in 
the diagnosis and therapy of biliary tract diseases. The ERCP is an invasive 
procedure that does not increase complications in the elderly. Few studies have 
assessed the safety of ERCP in the elderly. Life expectancy is rising, which 
causes an increasing demand for ERCP in the elderly.
AIM: To show that therapeutic ERCP is safe and we compared the level of 
complications among the elderly (> 80 years of age) and the level among a 
younger group (< 65 years of age).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was designed retrospectively. The details of all 
patients 80 years of age and older undergoing ERCP were analysed. One hundred 
and fifty patients were included in each of the groups: > 80 years of age, older 
group A; and < 65 years of age, younger group B.
RESULTS: In group A, 4 cases (2.7%) of bleeding (all mild) was observed, and 
perforation was not observed. The ERCP-related mild pancreatitis was observed in 
7 patients (4.6%). There were no cases of mortality during procedures of ERCP in 
group A. In group B 6 bleeding cases (4%) (all mild) were observed. Perforation 
was not observed in group B. ERCP-related mild pancreatitis occurred in 11 
patients (7.3%). There were no cases of mortality during procedures of ERCP in 
group B. Our study showed that ERCP is a safe and effective procedure in elderly 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of ERCP for diagnostic and therapeutic success, and 
complication rates, are similar to those in younger patients. The ERCP is 
effective and safe in the elderly.

School, Gwangju, Korea.

BACKGROUND: Laryngeal allotransplantation (LA) is a technique involving 
transplantation of a deceased donor's larynx into a recipient, and it may be 
substituted for conventional laryngeal reconstruction. There are widely 
different views on LA, as the recipient is administered continuous, potentially 
life-threatening, immunosuppressive therapy for a functional or aesthetic 
result, which is not directly related to life extension. The purpose of this 
study was to analyze the difference in risk acceptance and expectations of LA 
between four population groups.
METHODS: A survey was performed to examine patients' risk acceptance and 
expectations of LA. The survey included 287 subjects in total (general public, 
n=100; kidney transplant recipients, n=53; post-laryngectomy patients, n=34; 
doctors, n=100), using a Korean translated version of the louisville instrument 
for transplantation (LIFT) questionnaire.
RESULTS: All four groups responded differently at various levels of their 
perception in risk acceptance and expectations. The kidney transplant recipients 
reported the highest risk acceptance and expectations, and the doctor group the 
lowest.
CONCLUSIONS: This study examined the disparate perception between specific 
population groups of the risks and benefits of using LA for the promotion of the 
quality of life. By addressing the information gaps about LA in the different 
populations that have been highlighted from this survey, we suggest that LA can 
become a more viable alternative to classical surgery with resultant improved 
quality of life for patients.

INTRODUCTION: Aging has a profound effect on all the body organs and quality of 
life. One of the appropriate interventions is exercises such as walking. 
Nevertheless, the risk of falling and its complications are lower in stationary 
walking than walking on ground. Due to the higher life expectancy in women than 
men, the increasing number of elderly, and the low quality of life of women 
compared to men, this study aimed to assess the impact of stationary walking on 
the quality of life of the elderly women.
METHODS: In this clinical trial, 66 household elderly women covered by health 
centers of Maragheh were randomly selected and divided into experimental and 
control groups. Six weeks exercise intervention was conducted. The participants 
completed the quality of life questionnaire of the elderly, before and after the 
intervention. SPSS software was used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: Mean scores of quality of life, in various aspects of the experimental 
group, before and after intervention, showed significant difference; there was 
no statistically significant difference in the control group. In addition, there 
was a significant difference in the mean and standard deviation of different 
aspects of quality of life in pre- and post-test of experiment and control 
groups.
CONCLUSION: Using regular and constant exercise program such as stationary 
walking can increase the quality of life of the elderly women. It can improve 
healthy aging and having a healthy life at this age, too. Therefore, it is 
recommended to have stationary walking program in daily lives of the elderly.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are regarded as being at increased risk during 
major abdominal surgery because of a lack of functional reserve and an increased 
number of comorbidities. The aim of this study was to compare short- and 
long-term outcomes of laparoscopic gastrectomy between elderly and young gastric 
cancer patients.
METHODS: Two-hundred ten patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy for 
gastric cancer at our institution between January 2001 and December 2011 were 
included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into two age groups 
(younger than 70 years and older than 70 years) and were evaluated with respect 
to postoperative morbidity, quality of life (QOL), and survival.
RESULTS: Postoperative morbidity was similar in elderly and young groups (18.3 
vs. 21.6 %; P = 0.718). Overall survival of the elderly group was significantly 
worse than that of the young group (P < 0.001). However, disease-specific 
survival was not significantly different between the two groups. Longitudinal 
postoperative change in QOL in the elderly group showed a recovery similar to 
that in the young group.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic gastrectomy can be performed as safely in elderly 
patients as in young patients, with comparable postoperative results and 
long-term outcomes, including QOL, although the life expectancy of elderly 
patients is shorter.

BACKGROUND: Endobronchial valve (EBV) therapy is an innovative treatment that 
has been shown to be safe and effective in selected subgroups of patients with 
severe emphysema.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
EBV therapy compared to the medical management of patients with high 
heterogeneity, complete fissures and lobar exclusion in the context of the 
German health-care system.
METHODS: Clinical data from a subset of VENT (Endobronchial Valve for Emphysema 
Palliation Trial) provided information about clinical events, health-related 
quality of life, and disease staging for 12 months. This information was 
subsequently used to project long-term disease progression, mortality, and 
health resource utilization. We computed the 5- and 10-year incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in euros per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). 
Costs and effects were discounted at 3% per year.
