OBJECTIVE: The study investigates the macroeconomic determinants of co-residing 
arrangement between generations in selected developing countries with a focus on 
examining the effect of changing income level of the working generation.
METHODS: A reduced form model is specified for co-residence between the older 
generation and altruistic working generation. The fixed- and random-effects 
models are applied in two waves of data for 22 countries.
RESULTS: Estimated results indicate that the income of the altruistic working 
generation has a negative effect on co-residence, suggesting that if the income 
of the working generation increases, co-residence decreases. This decrease is 
greater for older men compared with their female counterparts. Life expectancy, 
literacy and culture also have significant influences on co-residence.
CONCLUSION: Co-residence is expected to fall in developing countries with 
economic growth over time. Consequently, a higher proportion of older citizens 
will be vulnerable in the future. Hence, governments of developing countries 
will face increasing pressure from their older people to provide appropriate 
planning and strategy to face this challenge.

INTRODUCTION: Dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) is 
recommended for first-line HIV treatment in the US and Europe. Efavirenz 
(EFV)-based regimens remain the standard of care (SOC) in India. We examined the 
clinical and economic impact of DTG-based first-line ART in the setting of 
India's recent guidelines change to treating all patients with HIV infection 
regardless of CD4 count.
METHODS: We used a microsimulation of HIV disease, the Cost-Effectiveness of 
Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC)-International model, to project outcomes 
in ART-naive patients under two strategies: (1) SOC: EFV/tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate (TDF)/lamivudine (3TC); and (2) DTG: DTG + TDF/3TC. Regimen-specific 
inputs, including virologic suppression at 48 weeks (SOC: 82% vs. DTG: 90%) and 
annual costs ($98 vs. $102), were informed by clinical trial data and other 
sources and varied widely in sensitivity analysis. We compared incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), measured in $/year of life saved (YLS), to 
India's per capita gross domestic product ($1600 in 2015). We compared the 
budget impact and HIV transmission effects of the two strategies for the 
estimated 444,000 and 916,000 patients likely to initiate ART in India over the 
next 2 and 5 years.
RESULTS: Compared to SOC, DTG improved 5-year survival from 76.7% to 83.0%, 
increased life expectancy from 22.0 to 24.8 years (14.0 to 15.5 years, 
discounted), averted 13,000 transmitted HIV infections over 5 years, increased 
discounted lifetime care costs from $3040 to $3240, and resulted in a lifetime 
ICER of $130/YLS, less than 10% of India's per capita GDP in 2015. DTG 
maintained an ICER below 50% of India's per capita GDP as long as the annual 
three-drug regimen cost was ≤$180/year. Over a 2- or 5-year horizon, total 
undiscounted outlays for HIV-related care were virtually the same for both 
strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: A generic DTG-based regimen is likely to be cost-effective and 
should be recommended for initial therapy of HIV infection in India.

INTRODUCTION: Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) in 
Brazil experience high rates of HIV infection. We examined the clinical and 
economic outcomes of implementing a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) programme in 
these populations.
METHODS: We used the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications 
(CEPAC)-International model of HIV prevention and treatment to evaluate two 
strategies: the current standard of care (SOC) in Brazil, including universal 
ART access (No PrEP strategy); and the current SOC plus daily 
tenofovir/emtracitabine PrEP (PrEP strategy) until age 50. Mean age (31 years, 
SD 8.4 years), age-stratified annual HIV incidence (age ≤ 40 years: 4.3/100 PY; 
age > 40 years: 1.0/100 PY), PrEP effectiveness (43% HIV incidence reduction) 
and PrEP drug costs ($23/month) were from Brazil-based sources. The analysis 
focused on direct medical costs of HIV care. We measured the comparative value 
of PrEP in 2015 United States dollars (USD) per year of life saved (YLS). 
Willingness-to-pay threshold was based on Brazil's annual per capita gross 
domestic product (GDP; 2015: $8540 USD).
RESULTS: Lifetime HIV infection risk among high-risk MSM and TGW was 50.5% with 
No PrEP and decreased to 40.1% with PrEP. PrEP increased per-person undiscounted 
(discounted) life expectancy from 36.8 (20.7) years to 41.0 (22.4) years and 
lifetime discounted HIV-related medical costs from $4100 to $8420, which led to 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $2530/YLS. PrEP remained 
cost-effective (<1x GDP) under plausible variation in key parameters, including 
PrEP effectiveness and cost, initial cohort age and HIV testing frequency on/off 
PrEP.
CONCLUSION: Daily tenofovir/emtracitabine PrEP among MSM and TGW at high risk of 
HIV infection in Brazil would increase life expectancy and be highly 
cost-effective.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency, time to flare, and predictors of disease 
flare upon withdrawal of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy in 
children with polyarticular forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who 
demonstrated ≥6 months of continuous clinically inactive disease.
METHODS: In 16 centers 137 patients with clinically inactive JIA who were 
receiving anti-TNF therapy (42% of whom were also receiving methotrexate [MTX]) 
were prospectively followed up. If the disease remained clinically inactive for 
the initial 6 months of the study, anti-TNF was stopped and patients were 
assessed for flare at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 months. Life-table analysis, t-tests, 
chi-square test, and Cox regression analysis were used to identify independent 
variables that could significantly predict flare by 8 months or time to flare.
RESULTS: Of 137 patients, 106 (77%) maintained clinically inactive disease while 
receiving anti-TNF therapy for the initial 6 months and were included in the 
phase of the study in which anti-TNF therapy was stopped. Stopping anti-TNF 
resulted in disease flare in 39 (37%) of 106 patients by 8 months. The 
mean/median ± SEM time to flare was 212/250 ± 9.77 days. Patients with shorter 
disease duration at enrollment, older age at onset and diagnosis, shorter 
disease duration prior to experiencing clinically inactive disease, and shorter 
time from onset of clinically inactive disease to enrollment were found to have 
significantly lower hazard ratios for likelihood of flare by 8 months (P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSION: Over one-third of patients with polyarticular JIA with sustained 
clinically inactive disease will experience a flare by 8 months after 
discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy. Several predictors of lower likelihood of 
flare were identified.

Valvular heart disease is an increasing population health problem and, 
especially in the elderly, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The 
current treatment options, such as mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valve 
replacements, have significant restrictions and limitations. Considering the 
increased life expectancy of our aging population, there is an urgent need for 
novel heart valve concepts that remain functional throughout life to prevent the 
need for reoperation. Heart valve tissue engineering aims to overcome these 
constraints by creating regenerative, self-repairing valve substitutes with 
life-long durability. In this review, we give an overview of advances in the 
development of tissue engineered heart valves, and describe the steps required 
to design and validate a novel valve prosthesis before reaching first-in-men 
clinical trials. In-silico and in-vitro models are proposed as tools for the 
assessment of valve design, functionality and compatibility, while in-vivo 
preclinical models are required to confirm the remodeling and growth potential 
of the tissue engineered heart valves. An overview of the tissue engineered 
heart valve studies that have reached clinical translation is also presented. 
Final remarks highlight the possibilities as well as the obstacles to overcome 
in translating heart valve prostheses into clinical application.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) 
remain a common end-organ manifestation of viral infection. Subclinical and mild 
symptoms lead to neurocognitive and behavioral abnormalities. These are 
associated, in part, with viral penetrance and persistence in the central 
nervous system. Infections of peripheral blood monocytes, macrophages, and 
microglia are the primary drivers of neuroinflammation and neuronal impairments. 
While current antiretroviral therapy (ART) has reduced the incidence of 
HIV-associated dementia, milder forms of HAND continue. Depression, comorbid 
conditions such as infectious liver disease, drugs of abuse, antiretroviral 
drugs themselves, age-related neurodegenerative diseases, gastrointestinal 
maladies, and concurrent social and economic issues can make accurate diagnosis 
of HAND challenging. Increased life expectancy as a result of ART clearly 
creates this variety of comorbid conditions that often blur the link between the 
virus and disease. With the discovery of novel biomarkers, neuropsychologic 
testing, and imaging techniques to better diagnose HAND, the emergence of 
brain-penetrant ART, adjunctive therapies, longer life expectancy, and better 
understanding of disease pathogenesis, disease elimination is perhaps a 
realistic possibility. This review focuses on HIV-associated disease 
pathobiology with an eye towards changing trends in the face of widespread 
availability of ART.

BACKGROUND: Total knee and hip arthroplasties can be associated with substantial 
blood loss, affecting morbidity and even mortality. Two pharmacological 
antifibrinolytics, ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and tranexamic acid (TXA) have 
been used to minimize perioperative blood loss, but both have associated 
morbidity. Given the added cost of these medications and the risks associated 
with then, a cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken to ascertain the best 
strategy.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was constructed using the payoffs of cost 
(in United States dollars) and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life expectancy, 
in days). The medical literature was used to ascertain various complications, 
their probabilities, utility values, and direct medical costs associated with 
various health states. A time horizon of 10 years and a willingness to pay 
threshold of $100,000 was used.
RESULTS: The total cost and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life expectancy, in 
days) was $459.77, $951.22, and $1174.87 and 3411.19, 3248.02, and 3342.69 for 
TXA, no pharmacologic hemostatic agent, and EACA, respectively. Because TXA is 
less expensive and more effective than the competing alternatives, it was the 
favored strategy. One-way sensitivity analyses for probability of transfusion 
and myocardial infarction for all 3 strategies revealed that TXA remains the 
dominant strategy across all clinically plausible values.
CONCLUSION: TXA, when compared with no pharmacologic hemostatic agent and with 
EACA, is the most cost-effective strategy to minimize intraoperative blood loss 
in hip and knee total joint arthroplasties. These findings are robust to 
sensitivity analyses using clinically plausible probabilities.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Life expectancy data of COPD patients in comparison to 
the general population are primarily based upon long-term population cohort 
studies. These studies are limited by a poor definition of clinically 
significant COPD. The key element in the course of COPD is a clinical 
exacerbation. Therefore, this study investigated 15-year survival following 
hospitalization for an exacerbation of COPD in comparison to the general 
population.
METHODS: A number of 4229 subjects was studied, including 845 hospitalized COPD 
patients and 3384 age and sex matched controls. Mortality risks were assessed 
using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and hazard rate ratios for death were 
estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models, for each Gold Class 
separately.
RESULTS: Overall 15-year survival was 7.3% in the COPD group and 40.6% in the 
general population. Survival was 24%, 11.1%, 5.3% and 0% for COPD GOLD I-IV. The 
mean life expectancy following hospitalization was 9.7, 7.1, 6.1 and 3.4 years 
for stage GOLD I-IV and 10.2 years for the general population. Overall, negative 
prognostic factors were age, male gender, low FEV1, low TLCO, respiratory 
insufficiency, Charlson comorbidity class, ICU-admission and exacerbation 
frequency. Factors differed among GOLD stages.
CONCLUSIONS: The 15-year survival for hospitalized COPD patients is reduced by 
82% in comparison to the general population. This indicates a more deleterious 
course of clinically significant COPD in comparison to population cohorts. As 
such, every possible effort should be taken to reduce exacerbations in a 
personalized way.

OBJECTIVE: Pelvic organ prolapse is a common problem among geriatric women. 
Advanced age is associated with a high prevalence of comorbidities that can lead 
to restrictive use of surgical treatment. With rising life expectancy it is 
predicted that surgical treatment in these women will be seen more frequently. 
Inconsistently there is a lack of clinical trials giving attention to elderly 
women suffering from pelvic organ prolapse. The aim of this study was to 
quantify the rate of complications in elderly women undergoing surgery for 
pelvic organ prolapse.
STUDY DESIGN: 72 women aged ≥75 years who underwent surgical correction for 
pelvic organ prolapse were included in this study. Demographics, comorbidities, 
intra-, peri- and postoperative severe and non-severe complications were 
recorded. Additionally we compared the pre- and postoperative presence of 
symptoms linked to pelvic organ prolapse. Follow-up for the review of pelvic 
floor symptoms was six month.
RESULTS: The mean age was 81.4 years. Four (5.6%) of the patients had a severe 
intra-, peri- or postoperative complication (two bowel injuries, one bleeding 
requiring blood transfusion, one resuscitation). All women with severe 
complications showed no persistent problem at the time of discharge or during 
the follow-up period. There was a significant postoperative decrease in pelvic 
organ prolapse connected symptoms, such as stress urinary incontinence 
(p = .013), voiding dysfunction (p < .001), recurrent urinary tract infection 
(p = .001) and rectal outlet obstruction (p = .006).
CONCLUSION: Elderly women undergoing an operation for pelvic organ prolapse have 
a low risk of complication and benefit from surgery. Age alone should not be a 
contraindication to surgery.

Review: Dairy foods, red meat and processed meat in the diet: implications for 
health at key life stages.

6AR,UK.

Social and health care provision have led to substantial increases in life 
expectancy. In the UK this has become higher than 80 years with an even greater 
proportional increase in those aged 85 years and over. The different life stages 
give rise to important nutritional challenges and recent reductions in milk 
consumption have led to sub-optimal intakes of calcium by teenage females in 
particular when bone growth is at its maximum and of iodine during pregnancy 
needed to ensure that supply/production of thyroid hormones to the foetus is 
adequate. Many young and pre-menopausal women have considerably sub-optimal 
intakes of iron which are likely to be associated with reduced consumption of 
red meat. A clear concern is the low intakes of calcium especially as a high 
proportion of the population is of sub-optimal vitamin D status. This may 
already have had serious consequences in terms of bone development which may not 
be apparent until later life, particularly in post-menopausal women. This review 
aims to examine the role of dairy foods and red meat at key life stages in terms 
of their ability to reduce or increase chronic disease risk. It is clear that 
milk and dairy foods are key sources of important nutrients such as calcium and 
iodine and the concentration of some key nutrients, notably iodine can be 
influenced by the method of primary milk production, in particular, the iodine 
intake of the dairy cow. Recent meta-analyses show no evidence of increased risk 
of cardiovascular diseases from high consumption of milk and dairy foods but 
increasing evidence of a reduction in the risk of type 2 diabetes associated 
with fermented dairy foods, yoghurt in particular. The recently updated reports 
from the World Cancer Research Fund International/American Institute for Cancer 
Research on the associations between dairy foods, red meat and processed meat 
and various cancers provide further confidence that total dairy products and 
milk, are associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer and high intakes 
of milk/dairy are not associated with increased risk of breast cancer. Earlier 
evidence of a significant increase in the risk of colorectal cancer from 
consumption of red and particularly processed meat has been reinforced by the 
inclusion of more recent studies. It is essential that nutrition and 
health-related functionality of foods are included in evaluations of sustainable 
food production.

BACKGROUND: With life expectancy increasing among patients with cystic fibrosis 
(CF), the prevalence of complications such as fatigue is also expected to 
increase. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of severe fatigue among 
adults with CF and to identify factors associated with fatigue.
METHODS: Adult patients with CF receiving treatment at a single center were 
invited to complete three questionnaires. We then studied the associations 
between fatigue and clinically measured parameters and between fatigue and 
patient-reported outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 77 patients (age 19-54years; 56% males; mean FEV1: 63%) 
completed the questionnaires (43% response rate). The prevalence of severe 
fatigue among these patients was 26%. The variance in fatigue was explained 
partially by clinically measured parameters. However, patient-reported outcomes 
were stronger independently associated with fatigue and included the patients' 
reported respiratory symptoms, emotional functioning, and social functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue is a clinically important and highly prevalent issue among 
adults with CF and is associated with a significant reduction in health-related 
quality of life and participation in society. In addition, fatigue is associated 
more strongly with the patient's perception of symptoms and well-being than with 
clinically measured parameters.

Prolonged life expectancy in humans has been accompanied by an increase in the 
prevalence of cancers. Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer-related 
deaths. It accounts for one-fourth of all diagnosed cancers and affects one in 
eight females worldwide. Given the high BC prevalence, there is a practical need 
for demographic screening of the disease. In the present study, we re-analyzed a 
large microRNA (miRNA) expression dataset (GSE73002), with the goal of 
optimizing miRNA biomarker selection using neural network cascade (NNC) 
modeling. Our results identified numerous candidate miRNA biomarkers that are 
technically suitable for BC detection. We combined three miRNAs (miR-1246, 
miR-6756-5p, and miR-8073) into a single panel to generate an NNC model, which 
successfully detected BC with 97.1% accuracy in an independent validation cohort 
comprising 429 BC patients and 895 healthy controls. In contrast, at least seven 
miRNAs were merged in a multiple linear regression model to obtain equivalent 
diagnostic performance (96.4% accuracy in the independent validation set). Our 
findings suggested that suitable modeling can effectively reduce the number of 
miRNAs required in a biomarker panel without compromising prediction accuracy, 
thereby increasing the technical possibility of early detection of BC.

Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly infectious avian pathogen, which affects 
the respiratory tract, gut, reproductive system, and kidney of chicks of all 
ages. Many different serotypes of IB virus (IBV) are recognized which cause 
different clinical manifestations. According to the antigenic differences, 
different serotypes of the virus do not cross-protect. Massachusetts serotype 
induces the best cross-protection against other serotypes. Recently, the IBV QX 
strain has been detected in Iran. QX strain causes permanent damage to the 
oviduct if it occurs in the early life cycle and is a significant factor in 
layer and breeder chicken flocks. In this study, we compare the H120 and Ma5 
vaccines' protection against early challenge with the QX strain in commercial 
chicks. one-day-old commercial chicks were divided into six groups. Groups 1 and 
2 were unvaccinated groups. Groups 3 and 5 were vaccinated with the H120 vaccine 
(eye drop) and groups 4 and 6 were vaccinated with Ma5 (eye drop) on the 6th day 
(5 days after vaccination). Groups 2, 3 and 4 challenged (oculonasal) with QX 
strain (10^4 EID50). Ciliostasis test, histopathology, and quantitative 
real-time RT-PCR were done at 11 days-old of age. Results showed that neither 
H120 nor Ma5 could induce proper cross-protection against QX early challenge, 
but the viral load and adverse pathological records in vaccinated chicks were 
less than that in the non-vaccinated groups. It can be concluded that 
vaccination on the first day of the life of a chick offers not full protection 
against the IBV QX strain but reduced the viral load and pathological damages in 
vaccinated chickens. Applying other forms of vaccination and using different 
genotypes on one-day-old chicks are suggested.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a transmural, relapsing inflammatory condition 
afflicting the digestive tract. Opioid signalling, long known to affect 
secretion and motility in the gut, has been implicated in the inflammatory 
cascade of Crohn's disease. Low dose naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, has 
garnered interest as a potential therapy.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low 
dose naltrexone for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.
SEARCH METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, CENTRAL, and the 
Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register was performed from inception to 15 
January 2018 to identify relevant studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterology 
conferences including Digestive Disease Week and United European 
Gastroenterology Week and reference lists from retrieved articles were also 
screened.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of low dose naltrexone (LDN) 
for treatment of active Crohn's disease were included.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis 
using Review Manager (RevMan 5.3.5). The primary outcome was induction of 
clinical remission defined by a Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) of < 150 
or a pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) of < 10. Secondary 
outcomes included clinical response (70- or 100-point decrease in CDAI from 
baseline), endoscopic remission or response, quality of life, and adverse events 
as defined by the included studies. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. The methodological 
quality of included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 
The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome and selected 
secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria.
MAIN RESULTS: Two studies were identified (46 participants). One study assessed 
the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of LDN (4.5 mg/day) treatment compared to 
placebo in adult patients (N = 34). The other study assessed eight weeks of LDN 
(0.1 mg/kg, maximum 4.5 mg/day) treatment compared to placebo in pediatric 
patients (N = 12). The primary purpose of the pediatric study was to assess 
safety and tolerability. Both studies were rated as having a low risk of bias. 
The study in adult patients reported that 30% (5/18) of LDN treated patients 
achieved clinical remission at 12 weeks compared to 18% (3/16) of placebo 
patients, a difference that was not statistically significant (RR 1.48, 95% CI 
0.42 to 5.24). The study in children reported that 25% of LDN treated patients 
achieved clinical remission (PCDAI < 10) compared to none of the patients in the 
placebo group, although it was unclear if this result was for the randomized 
placebo-controlled trial or for the open label extension study. In the adult 
study 70-point clinical response rates were significantly higher in those 
treated with LDN than placebo. Eighty-three per cent (15/18) of LDN patients had 
a 70-point clinical response at week 12 compared to 38% (6/16) of placebo 
patients (RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.32). The effect of LDN on the proportion of 
adult patients who achieved a 100-point clinical response was uncertain. 
Sixty-one per cent (11/18) of LDN patients achieved a 100-point clinical 
response compared to 31% (5/16) of placebo patients (RR 1.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 
4.42). The proportion of patients who achieved endoscopic response (CDEIS 
decline > 5 from baseline) was significantly higher in the LDN group compared to 
placebo. Seventy-two per cent (13/18) of LDN patients achieved an endoscopic 
response compared to 25% (4/16) of placebo patients (RR 2.89; 95% CI 1.18 to 
7.08). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the 
proportion of patients who achieved endoscopic remission. Endoscopic remission 
(CDEIS < 3) was achieved in 22% (4/18) of the LDN group compared to 0% (0/16) of 
the placebo group (RR 8.05; 95% CI 0.47 to 138.87). Pooled data from both 
studies show no statistically significant differences in withdrawals due to 
adverse events or specific adverse events including sleep disturbance, unusual 
dreams, headache, decreased appetite, nausea and fatigue. No serious adverse 
events were reported in either study. GRADE analyses rated the overall quality 
of the evidence for the primary and secondary outcomes (i.e. clinical remission, 
clinical response, endoscopic response, and adverse events) as low due to 
serious imprecision (sparse data).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is insufficient evidence to allow any 
firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of LDN used to treat patients 
with active Crohn's disease. Data from one small study suggests that LDN may 
provide a benefit in terms of clinical and endoscopic response in adult patients 
with active Crohn's disease. Data from two small studies suggest that LDN does 
not increase the rate of specific adverse events relative to placebo. However, 
these results need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on very 
small numbers of patients and the overall quality of the evidence was rated as 
low due to serious imprecision. Further randomized controlled trials are 
required to assess the efficacy and safety of LDN therapy in active Crohn's 
disease in both adults and children.

The chemical replication of RNA inside fatty acid vesicles is a plausible step 
in the emergence of cellular life. On the primitive Earth, simple protocells 
with the ability to import nucleotides and short oligomers from their 
environment could potentially have replicated and retained larger genomic RNA 
oligonucleotides within a spatially defined compartment. We have previously 
shown that short 5'-phosphoroimidazolide-activated "helper" RNA oligomers enable 
the nonenzymatic copying of mixed-sequence templates in solution, using 
5'-phosphoroimidazolide-activated mononucleotides. Here, we report that 
citrate-chelated Mg2+, a catalyst of nonenzymatic primer extension, enhances 
fatty acid membrane permeability to such short RNA oligomers up to the size of 
tetramers, without disrupting vesicle membranes. In addition, selective 
permeability of short, but not long, oligomers can be further enhanced by 
elevating the temperature. The ability to increase the permeability of fatty 
acid membranes to short oligonucleotides allows for the nonenzymatic copying of 
RNA templates containing all four nucleotides inside vesicles, bringing us one 
step closer to the goal of building a protocell capable of Darwinian evolution.

Intracellular traffic in Aspergillus nidulans hyphae must cope with the 
challenges that the high rates of apical extension (1μm/min) and the long 
intracellular distances (>100 μm) impose. Understanding the ways in which the 
hyphal tip cell coordinates traffic to meet these challenges is of basic 
importance, but is also of considerable applied interest, as fungal invasiveness 
of animals and plants depends critically upon maintaining these high rates of 
growth. Rapid apical extension requires localization of cell-wall-modifying 
enzymes to hyphal tips. By combining genetic blocks in different trafficking 
steps with multidimensional epifluorescence microscopy and quantitative image 
analyses we demonstrate that polarization of the essential chitin-synthase ChsB 
occurs by indirect endocytic recycling, involving delivery/exocytosis to apices 
followed by internalization by the sub-apical endocytic collar of actin patches 
and subsequent trafficking to TGN cisternae, where it accumulates for ~1 min 
before being re-delivered to the apex by a RAB11/TRAPPII-dependent pathway. 
Accordingly, ChsB is stranded at the TGN by Sec7 inactivation but re-polarizes 
to the apical dome if the block is bypassed by a mutation in geaAgea1 that 
restores growth in the absence of Sec7. That polarization is independent of 
RAB5, that ChsB predominates at apex-proximal cisternae, and that upon dynein 
impairment ChsB is stalled at the tips in an aggregated endosome indicate that 
endocytosed ChsB traffics to the TGN via sorting endosomes functionally located 
upstream of the RAB5 domain and that this step requires dynein-mediated 
basipetal transport. It also requires RAB6 and its effector GARP 
(Vps51/Vps52/Vps53/Vps54), whose composition we determined by MS/MS following 
affinity chromatography purification. Ablation of any GARP component diverts 
ChsB to vacuoles and impairs growth and morphology markedly, emphasizing the 
important physiological role played by this pathway that, we propose, is central 
to the hyphal mode of growth.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease 
remains controversial. Recently, the PLEASE study did not demonstrate any 
additional clinical benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic 
treatment. However, the economic impact of the antibiotic strategies has not 
been investigated.
METHODS: This prospective economic evaluation, adhering a societal perspective, 
was performed alongside the PLEASE study, a multicenter, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind 1:1:1 randomized clinical trial in which all patients received 
open-label intravenous ceftriaxone for two weeks before the 12-week randomized 
blinded oral antibiotic regimen (doxycycline, clarithromycin plus 
hydroxychloroquine, or placebo). Between 2010 and 2013, patients (n = 271) with 
borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms were enrolled and followed for one 
year. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental net 
monetary benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic therapy.
RESULTS: Mean quality-adjusted life years (95% CI) were not significantly 
different (p = 0.96): 0.82 (0.77-0.88) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline (n = 82), 
0.81 (0.76-0.88) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine (n = 93), and 
0.81 (0.76-0.86) for ceftriaxone/placebo (n = 96). Total societal costs per 
patient (95% CI) were not significantly different either (p = 0.35): €11,995 
(€8,823-€15,670) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline, €12,202 (€9,572-€15,253) for 
ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, and €15,249 (€11,294-€19,781) for 
ceftriaxone/placebo. Incremental net monetary benefit (95% CI) for 
ceftriaxone/doxycycline compared to ceftriaxone/placebo varied from €3,317 
(-€2,199-€8,998) to €4,285 (-€6,085-€14,524) over the willingness-to-pay range, 
and that of ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine compared to 
ceftriaxone/placebo from €3,098 (-€888-€7,172) to €3,710 (-€4,254-€11,651). For 
every willingness-to-pay threshold, the incremental net monetary benefits did 
not significantly differ from zero.
CONCLUSION: The longer-term treatments were similar with regard to costs, 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness compared to shorter-term treatment in 
patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms after one year of 
follow-up. Given the results of this study, and taking into account the external 
costs associated with antibiotic resistance, the shorter-term treatment is the 
antibiotic regimen of first choice.

Since the mid-2000s, after a few decades of negative trends and fluctuations, 
Russia has experienced the longest and most stable period of life expectancy 
increasing for the entire period of observation which was determined not only by 
a decrease in mortality at the middle ages, but also at the old ages. This 
period has been marked by a very fast increase in life expectancy of Muscovites. 
The paper shows that the mortality at old ages in Moscow systematically deviates 
from the patterns observed in economically developed countries with reliable 
mortality statistics. We assume that experience of these countries is applicable 
to regions of Russia. Based on this assumption the adjusted estimates of life 
expectancy at old ages in Moscow and Russia were calculated, as well as effect 
of the underestimation of mortality over age 80 on life expectancy at birth and 
at the age of retirement.

Publisher: В течение нескольких десятилетий смертность населения России в 
старшем возрасте находилась на стабильно высоком уровне. Однако с середины 
2000-х гг. происходит устойчивый рост ожидаемой продолжительности жизни, 
который, в значительной степени, обеспечивается снижением смертности в пожилом 
возрасте. В этот период отмечено особенно резкое снижение смертности москвичей 
старше 80 лет. Мы показываем, что эта динамика систематически отклоняется от 
закономерностей, наблюдаемых в странах с надежной статистикой смертности. Исходя 
из предположения о применимости опыта этих стран к России, мы рассчитали 
скорректированные (на возможное занижение смертности) оценки продолжительности 
жизни населения Москвы, России и Центрального округа в возрасте 80 лет, возрасте 
выхода на пенсию и при рождении.
