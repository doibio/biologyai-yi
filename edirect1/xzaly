animals and controls (p<0.05). IL-2 levels were greater in CFTR-/- mice compared 
to controls (p<0.05), but unrelated to STZ. Reinforcing generalized cytokine 
up-regulation in CFTR-/-, IL-4 levels were greater in CFTR-/- mice compared to 
C57BL/6J, but FVB/NJ mice demonstrated greatest concentrations following STZ. 
These results suggest that, hyperglycemia may exacerbate the clinical course in 
CF by impacting immune reactivity. There is clear need to maximize metabolic 
management in CFRD.

BACKGROUND: New systemic treatments for advanced colorectal cancer have 
conferred a survival advantage, allowing patients to reach a median survival of 
almost 2 years. Due to this remarkable life extension, the incidence of brain 
metastases, though still low, is progressively increasing over time. There is 
little reported data on the optimal strategy to manage brain lesions from 
colorectal cancer.
METHODS: To explore the role of an aggressive approach to colorectal cancer 
brain metastases, we retrospectively collected and analyzed data from 30 
patients who underwent neurosurgical resection + whole-brain radiotherapy 
between March 1998 and December 2006. Univariate (logrank) and multivariate 
(Cox's model) analyses were used to identify prognostic factors.
RESULTS: Median age at the time of surgery was 66 years, median ECOG PS was 1, 
most patients (87%) had concomitant lung and/or liver metastases. Median number 
of previous chemotherapies was two, with half of the patients being exposed both 
to oxaliplatin and irinotecan. A median of 27 Gy of radiotherapy were 
administered to 16 patients after resection. At the time of the analysis, 29 out 
of 30 patients had died, with a median survival time after brain metastasectomy 
of 167 days (8-682). Only one patient died within a month from surgery. Median 
survival was significantly longer in patients who received postsurgical 
radiotherapy (7.6 vs. 4.7 months, P = 0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical management of symptomatic brain metastases from 
colorectal cancer is feasible, relatively safe, and offers a chance of prolonged 
survival. Patients who received radiotherapy after resection experienced a 
better outcome.

Medical needs and survival of NHS continuing care residents.

Moylan T(1), Roberts M, Murray S.

Author information:
(1)Monklands Hospital, Airdrie, ML6 OJS. Tricia.Moylan@lanarkshire.scot.nhs.uk

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To determine the medical needs and survival of patients 
admitted to NHS continuing care beds for the frail elderly.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of admissions during one year to 222 beds 
in south-east Glasgow. Case-sheet review identified the diagnoses on admission. 
Medical interventions were allocated to one of six predetermined categories. 
Mortality data was collected up to four years after admission.
RESULTS: One hundred and eighty nine patients (65 male and 133 female) were 
admitted, 183 (92%) for NHS continuing care. The overall survival at three 
months was 47.8% and 38.5% at six months. In total 1585 interventions were 
recorded, 56.3% of admissions required one or more major intervention. Seventy 
eight (75.7%) of these were managed in the continuing care setting avoiding 
transfer to an acute hospital bed.
CONCLUSIONS: Older people resident in NHS continuing care have a short life 
expectancy and require frequent medical interventions. Much of this can be 
provided in the NHS continuing care setting avoiding admission to the acute 
sector. Shift of care for these patients to private nursing homes may not 
provide such support.

Increased life expectancy has led to an overall aging of the population and 
greater numbers of elderly people. Therefore, the number of people with 
osteoporosis has increased substantially, accompanied with an epidemic of hip 
fractures. Osteoporosis is an age-related systemic condition that naturally 
occurs, among mammals, only in humans. Osteoporosis is known to be highly 
heritable. However, assuming a genetic determinant for this post-reproductive 
disease to be transmitted from one generation to the next is counter-intuitive, 
based on the principles of human evolution, I will attempt to provide an 
explanation of the phenomenon from the point of view of evolution, selection, 
and changed environment in humans, which contributed to human longevity, while 
on other hand, contribute to diseases of civilization, including osteoporosis. 
There is a need to delve into evolution of human species in search for adaptive 
patterns to a specific environment that humans are operating in the last couple 
of millennia, to clarify whether "good" and "bad" genes exist, and how to find 
and correct them. The answer to the above questions will help us to identify 
causes of the current epidemic of osteoporosis and to pin-point a tailored 
treatment.

Parallel lines: nothing has changed?

The exponential increase in mortality rate with age is a universal feature of 
aging and is described mathematically by the Gompertz equation. When this 
equation is transformed semilogarithmically, it conforms to a straight line, the 
slope of which is generally used to reflect the rate of senescence. Historical 
and contemporary data of human and nonhuman populations show that adverse 
environmental conditions do not always change the slope of the log mortality 
rate over age. From these latter observations it is sometimes mistakenly 
inferred that the rate of senescence is unaffected by environmental conditions. 
Current biological inference emphasizes that gene action is dependent on the 
environment in which it is expressed. Here, we propose using the tangent line of 
the Gompertz equation to assess whether the rate of senescence has altered. Such 
an approach unmasks different rates of senescence when parameter G has remained 
constant, an observation that is in line with the notion that a plastic life 
history trait such as the rate of senescence results from the interplay of both 
genes and environment.

Animal models of chronic lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa: useful 
tools for cystic fibrosis studies.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a defect in the transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) protein that functions as a chloride channel. Dysfunction of 
the CFTR protein results in salty sweat, pancreatic insufficiency, intestinal 
obstruction, male infertility and severe pulmonary disease. In most patients 
with CF life expectancy is limited due to a progressive loss of functional lung 
tissue. Early in life a persistent neutrophylic inflammation can be demonstrated 
in the airways. The cause of this inflammation, the role of CFTR and the cause 
of lung morbidity by different CF-specific bacteria, mostly Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, are not well understood. The lack of an appropriate animal model 
with multi-organ pathology having the characteristics of the human form of CF 
has hampered our understanding of the pathobiology and chronic lung infections 
of the disease for many years. This review summarizes the main characteristics 
of CF and focuses on several available animal models that have been frequently 
used in CF research. A better understanding of the chronic lung infection caused 
particularly by P. aeruginosa, the pathophysiology of lung inflammation and the 
pathogenesis of lung disease necessitates animal models to understand CF, and to 
develop and improve treatment.

Applications of free circulating nucleic acids in clinical medicine: recent 
advances.

Model Town, Dhaka 1230, Bangladesh. medicalcollegeforwomen@yahoo.com

The objective of this review article was to highlight briefly the recent 
advances made relevant to applications of free circulating nucleic acids (FcNAs) 
in clinical medicine. Detection of FcNAs in plasma, serum and other body fluids 
from healthy subjects as well as in patients has opened up the possibility of 
diagnosis and monitoring of diseases. With the rapid developments in molecular 
biology techniques such as real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(rt-qPCR), quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMS-PCR), matrix-assisted 
laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry, 
quantitative fluorescent PCR (QF-PCR), single allele primer extension reaction 
(SAPER) method and other techniques the applications in clinical medicine have 
increased. The recent discovery of epigenetic changes in placental/fetal DNA and 
the detection of fetal/placental-specific RNAs have made FcNAs to be used for 
diagnosis of genetic disorders in all pregnancies irrespective of the gender of 
the fetus in early intrauterine life. It is now possible to detect very small 
amounts of, and specific mutations in, fetal DNA in the presence of excess 
non-specific maternal DNA. In oncology, detection and monitoring of tumors are 
now possible by the detection of tumor-derived FcNAs. In other conditions, such 
as diabetes mellitus, trauma and stroke FcNAs have been shown to be useful also. 
In spite of these advances questions regarding the origin and biologic 
significance of FcNAs remain to be answered. Standardization of methodologies 
including pre-analytical and analytical aspects will revolutionize the 
applications of FcNAs in the diagnosis and monitoring of diseases in clinical 
medicine in the next few years.

U.S. decennial life tables for 1999-2001: methodology of the United States Life 
Tables.

Author information:
(1)U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Center for Health 
Statistics, Center for Disease Control Prevention, Hyattsville, MD 20782, USA.

OBJECTIVES: This report describes the methodology used in the preparation of the 
1999-2001 decennial life tables for the United States.
METHODS: Data used to prepare these life tables include population data by age 
on the census date April 1, 2000; deaths occurring in the 3-year period 
1999-2001 classified by age at death; births for each of the years 1997-2001; 
and Medicare data for ages 66-100 years from the years 1999-2001. Methods that 
were kept the same as those of previous decennial tables include data sources 
used in constructing tables, the preliminary adjustment for misreported ages, 
the smoothing techniques for vital statistics and census data, and the 
calculations of death rates in different age groups. Two significant changes 
were made to the methodology used to estimate mortality for the populations aged 
66 years and over. First, Medicare data were used to supplement vital statistics 
(number of deaths) and census data (population estimates) starting at age 66 
years instead of age 85 years as was done in the estimation of previous U.S. 
decennial life tables. Second, smoothing and extrapolation of death rates for 
ages 66-109 was performed using a mathematical model given by Heligman and 
Pollard, instead of a Whittaker-Henderson Type B formula or modified Gompertz 
method.

Further validation and responsiveness assessment of the Herpes Outbreak Impact 
Questionnaire and Herpes Symptom Checklist.

Meads DM(1), McKenna SP, Bonney MA, Bloch MT.

Author information:
(1)Galen Research, Enterprise House, Manchester Science Park, Lloyd Street North 
Manchester, UK.

OBJECTIVE: The Herpes Outbreak Impact Questionnaire (HOIQ) and Herpes Symptom 
Checklist (HSC) are patient-completed questionnaires for assessing genital 
herpes outbreaks. This report describes the validation of paper-and-pencil 
versions of the scales and responsiveness assessments in an Australian clinical 
trial.
METHODS: Acceptability of the language of the original UK versions was tested 
with Australians. The HOIQ and HSC were then field-tested with patients. The new 
versions were validated using patients' daily responses to the questionnaires in 
a famciclovir study.
RESULTS: The HOIQ and HSC were readily adapted into Australian English and were 
acceptable to patients. Psychometric sample: N = 151; 81 (54%) male; mean age 
39.9 +/- 11.6 years; mean outbreaks 5.1 +/- 3.0 per year. Internal consistency 
was good (alphas at outbreak 1 ranged 0.84-0.90 HOIQ and 0.73-0.87 HSC). Rasch 
analysis showed item stability over time. Correlations between HOIQ and HSC 
ranged from 0.46 to 0.60. Both scales distinguished outbreak healing presence or 
absence at day 6 (P = 0.001), and the HOIQ scale distinguished between symptom 
severity groups (P < 0.001). Scale scores declined significantly over study 
duration, exhibiting large effect sizes.
CONCLUSIONS: The paper-and-pencil HOIQ and HSC were reliable, valid, and 
responsive in a clinical trial setting. These instruments are recommended for 
use in clinical studies.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine lifetime costs, morbidity, and mortality 
associated with varying adherence to antihypertensive and 
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statin) therapy in a 
hypertensive population.
METHODS: A model was constructed to compare costs and outcomes under three 
adherence scenarios: no treatment, ideal adherence, and real-world adherence. 
Simulated patients' characteristics matched those of participants in the 
Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid-Lowering Arm and event 
probabilities were calculated with Framingham Heart Study risk equations. The 
real-world adherence scenario employed adherence data from an observational 
study of a US population; risk reductions at each level of adherence were based 
on linear extrapolations from clinical trials. Outputs included life expectancy, 
frequencies of primary and secondary coronary heart disease and stroke, and 
direct medical costs in 2006 US$. The incremental cost per life-year gained and 
incremental cost per event avoided were calculated comparing the three adherence 
scenarios.
RESULTS: Mean life expectancy was 14.73 years (no-treatment scenario), 15.07 
(real-world adherence), and 15.49 (ideal adherence). The average number of 
cardiovascular events per patients was 0.738 (no treatment), 0.610 (real-world 
adherence), and 0.441 (ideal adherence). The incremental cost of real-world 
adherence versus no treatment is $30,585 per life-year gained, and ideal 
adherence versus real-world adherence is $22,121 per life-year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive patients taking antihypertensive and statin therapy at 
real-world adherence levels can be expected to receive approximately 50% of the 
potential benefit seen in clinical trials. Depending on its cost, the 
incremental benefits of an effective adherence intervention program could make 
it an attractive value.

Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. blackhou@mcmaster.ca

OBJECTIVES: The primary risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is rupture, 
which is associated with a high mortality rate. Elective surgical options for 
AAA include open repair (OR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). EVAR is 
less invasive than OR, and therefore may have less surgical risk than OR. 
However, the graft used for EVAR is much more expensive then the graft used for 
OR.
METHODS: A decision model with a 10-year time horizon was used to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of EVAR versus OR. The primary outcome measure was 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The model incorporated the costs and 
benefits of both perioperative outcomes and postoperative outcomes. A systematic 
review was conducted to derive clinical outcome rates. Cost and utility model 
variables were based on various literature sources and data from a recent 
Canadian observational study. Parameter uncertainty was assessed using 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: In the base-case model, the incremental cost per QALY of EVAR was 
estimated to be $268,337, whereas the incremental cost per life-year was found 
to be $444,129. The incremental cost per QALY of EVAR remained above $295,715 
under different assumptions of cohort age and model time horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on commonly quoted willingness-to-pay thresholds, EVAR was 
not found to be cost-effective compared to OR.

Digitally planned, immediately loaded dental implants with prefabricated 
prostheses in the reconstruction of edentulous maxillae: a 1-year prospective, 
multicenter study.

BACKGROUND: The introduction of digital planning programs has made it possible 
to place dental implants in preplanned positions and being immediately 
functionally loaded by using prefabricated prostheses.
PURPOSE: The aim of this multicenter study was to describe the 1-year results of 
digitally planned, immediately loaded edentulous maxillae.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 312 implants (Brånemark System, TiUnite RP, 
Nobel Biocare, Göteborg, Sweden) in 52 patients from eight Scandinavian clinics 
were digitally planned, surgically as well as prosthetically, by using the 
NobelGuide (Nobel Biocare AB, Göteborg, Sweden) and received prefabricated, 
immediately loaded fixed prosthetic constructions in the maxillae. Individual 
implant stability was manually tested at 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: All patients received a Procera Implant Bridge (Nobel Biocare AB); 
however, in two cases, the bridges were reconstructed due to misfit. In five 
patients, difficulties in getting the surgical guide completely in position, and 
in five patients, getting the prostheses completely seated, were noted. All but 
four patients fulfilled the 1-year follow-up. Two implants were lost during the 
study period, resulting in a cumulative survival rate of 99.4%. The mean 
marginal bone resorption from implant placement to the 1-year follow-up was 1.3 
mm (SD 1.28). More than 2 mm of marginal resorption was noted in 19% of the 
implants at this instant. The most frequently reported complications during the 
first year were gingival hyperplasia and prosthesis-related problems (prosthesis 
screw loosening, occlusal fractures, and occlusal adjustments).
CONCLUSION: The 1-year results in this multicenter are promising regarding 
implant and bridge stability; however, the study is planned to be running for at 
least 3 years.

BACKGROUND: Although colorectal cancer (CRC) screening strategies are quite 
common in the United States, their systematic introduction in Europe has been 
delayed until the year 2008. To estimate endoscopic requirements of four 
different CRC screening strategies (annual and biennial fecal occult blood 
testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, and colonoscopy every 10 
years) in an average-risk population.
METHODS: A long-term Markov process model was designed combining three adherence 
rates for the four above-mentioned screening strategies in individuals aged from 
50 to 74. Estimations included endoscopic procedures performed for both 
screening and surveillance purposes. Models were adjusted for age-related 
adenoma and CRC incidence rates, life expectancy, and cancer-related survival.
RESULTS: The mean number of annual colonoscopies per 100,000 individuals aged 
50-74 ranged from 100 to 271 for annual FOBT, from 75 to 203 for biennial FOBT, 
from 222 to 601 for sigmoidoscopy, and from 903 to 2,449 for colonoscopy-based 
strategies, depending on the adherence rate. According to these estimations, 
annual and biennial FOBT strategies would generate a slight decrease of current 
endoscopic activity (1.4-3.8% and 2.7-7.2%, respectively), whereas sigmoidoscopy 
and colonoscopy-based strategies would induce a 4.7-12.8% and 32-87% increase, 
respectively, with respect to a non-screening scenario. The model confirmed a 
3-16% mean reduction of CRC incidence depending on the strategy and adherence 
rate.
CONCLUSION: Whereas endoscopic capacity exists for widespread CRC screening with 
annual or biennial FOBT, implementation of potentially more effective 
strategies, such as flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, would result in a 
significant increase of current endoscopic resources.

Challenges in the management of rheumatoid arthritis in developing countries.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease which is 
characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints. Patients experience chronic 
pain and suffering, and increasing disability; without treatment, life 
expectancy is reduced. It is imperative to identify patients early so that 
control of inflammation can prevent joint destruction and disability. Although 
great advances have been made in the developed nations, early diagnosis remains 
a great challenge for developing countries during the Bone and Joint Decade 
(2000-2010) and beyond. Developing countries face important and competitive 
social, economic, health- and poverty-related issues, and this frequently 
results in chronic diseases such as RA being forgotten in health priorities when 
urgent health needs are considered in an environment with poor education and 
scarce resources. Epidemiological studies in developing countries show a lower 
but still important prevalence in different regions when compared to that in 
Caucasians. It seems that the severity of RA varies among different ethnic 
groups, and probably starts at a younger age in developing countries. Practising 
rheumatologists in these regions need to take into account several important 
problems that include suboptimal undergraduate education, inadequate diagnosis, 
late referrals, lack of human and technical resources, poor access to 
rheumatologists, and some deficiencies in drug availability. Infections are very 
important in RA, and special care is needed in developing countries as some 
endemic infections include tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. These infections should be carefully taken into 
account when medications are prescribed and monitored. This chapter presents 
published information covering the main challenges faced in these environments, 
and suggests strategies to overcome these important problems in RA management.

testing to guide selection of first-line HIV regimens in the United States.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a simulation model of HIV disease. The 
prevalence of HLA-B*5701 and the probabilities of confirmed and unconfirmed 
severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction among patients taking abacavir testing 
HLA-B*5701 positive and negative were from the Prospective Randomized Evaluation 
of DNA Screening in a Clinical Trial study. The monthly costs of abacavir-based 
and tenofovir-based regimens were $1135 and $1139, respectively; similar 
virologic efficacy was assumed and this assumption was varied in sensitivity 
analysis.
PATIENTS: Simulated cohort of patients initiating HIV therapy.
INTERVENTIONS: The interventions are first-line abacavir, lamivudine, and 
efavirenz without pretreatment HLA-B*5701 testing; the same regimen with 
HLA-B*5701 testing; and first-line tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years and lifetime medical costs 
discounted at 3% per annum, cost-effectiveness ratios ($/QALY).
RESULTS: Abacavir-based treatment without HLA-B*5701 testing resulted in a 
projected 30.93 years life expectancy, 16.23 discounted quality-adjusted life 
years, and $472,200 discounted lifetime cost per person. HLA-B*5701 testing 
added 0.04 quality-adjusted months at an incremental cost of $110, resulting in 
a cost-effectiveness ratio of $36,700/QALY compared with no testing. Initiating 
treatment with a tenofovir-based regimen increased costs without improving 
quality-adjusted life expectancy. HLA-B*5701 testing remained the preferred 
strategy only if abacavir-based treatment had equal efficacy and cost less per 
month than tenofovir-based treatment. Results were also sensitive to the cost of 
HLA-B*5701 testing and the prevalence of HLA-B*5701.
CONCLUSION: Pharmacogenetic testing for HLA-B*5701 is cost-effective only if 
abacavir-based treatment is as effective and costs less than tenofovir-based 
treatment.

We investigated the dynamics of autolytic damage of the cortical neurons in 
adult brains for 24 hours at room temperature (+20 degrees C) after cardiac 
arrest. The progressive histological and ultrastructural changes were documented 
using routine and immunohistochemical staining as well as electron microscopy. 
Our results demonstrated that there were no autolytic damages in the 
ultrastructure of cerebral neurons in the first 6 hours after warm cardiac 
arrest, in agreement with previous studies in other mammals. Interestingly, the 
activation of caspase-3 was observed in a significant number of neurons of the 
cerebellum and neocortex 9 hours following cardiac arrest. No significant 
changes related to autolysis were observed using amnio-cupric acid and Nissl 
(thionine) staining.

in older women?

Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-2027, USA. meissneh@od.nih.gov

BACKGROUND: Decisions to screen older patients for cancer are complicated by the 
fact that aging populations are heterogeneous with respect to life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: To examine national trends in the association between cervical cancer 
screening and age, health and hysterectomy status.
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional data from the 1993, 1998, 2000, and 
2005 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) were used to examine trends in 
screening for women age 35-64 and 65+ years of age. We investigated whether 
health is associated with Pap testing among older women using the 2005 NHIS (N = 
3,073). We excluded women with a history of cervical cancer or who had their 
last Pap because of a problem.
MEASUREMENTS: The dependent variable was having a Pap test within the past 3 
years. Independent variables included three measures of respondent health (the 
Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), general health status and having a chronic 
disability), hysterectomy status and sociodemographic factors.
MAIN RESULTS: NHIS data showed a consistent pattern of lower Pap use among older 
women (65+) compared to younger women regardless of hysterectomy status. 
Screening also was lower among older women who reported being in fair/poor 
health, having a chronic disability, or a higher CCI score (4+). Multivariate 
models showed that over 50% of older women reporting poor health status or a 
chronic disability and 47% with a hysterectomy still had a recent Pap.
CONCLUSIONS: Though age, health and hysterectomy status appear to influence Pap 
test use, current national data suggest that there still may be overutilization 
and inappropriate screening of older women.

Arrays of oligonucleotides synthesized in the 5'-->3' direction have potential 
benefit in several areas of life sciences research because the free 3'-end can 
be modified by enzymatic reactions. A Geniom One instrument (febit biomed GmbH, 
Germany), with integrated chip fabrication, multiplex primer extension, 
fluorescence imaging, and data analysis, was evaluated for studies of genomic 
variations. Microchannels used for the array synthesis in Geniom One were not 
optimized before for the APEX method and, as preliminary experiments 
demonstrated in this study, the signals were strongly affected by the speed of 
the process inside reaction channels. Using the two-compartment model (TCM), 
target binding to feature were quantitatively analyzed, revealing profound 
mass-transport limitations in the observed kinetics and enabling us to draw a 
series of physicochemical conclusions of the optimal set-up for the APEX 
reaction. Some kinetically relevant parameters such as target concentration, 
reaction time, and temperature were comprehensively analyzed. Finally, we 
applied the arrays and methods in a proof-of-principle experiment where 36 
individuals were typed with 900 oligonucleotide probes (sense and antisense 
primers for 450 markers), using the ABCR gene as a test system. A new DNA 
analysis method for studies of genomic variation was developed using this 
all-in-one platform.

Stroke in the elderly has more major differences compared to young people: it is 
the first complication of atherothrombosis disease associated with the following 
risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, tobacco consumption 
and sleep apnea syndrome; AVC is the first consequence of atrial fibrillation; 
from a clinical point of view, seizure at the onset of the stroke is more 
frequent; prognosis is characterized by a high risk of dementia (20%); primary 
and secondary prevention is very efficacious even in very old patients, not only 
on the risk of stroke, but also on the risk of dementia; time trends at Dijon 
show a slight decrease of incidence rates of stroke only over 85 years, while 
prevention of stroke has taken advantage of real progress in precocious 
diagnosis and innovative treatments. In contrast, we observed a decrease of 
case-fatality rates at any day with a delay in age of onset of stroke, reaching 
five years in men and eight years in women, suggesting an increase of life 
expectancy without stroke, reflecting a certain efficacy of prevention.

Rhinocerebral Mucormycosis: consideration of prognostic factors and treatment 
modality.

Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

OBJECTIVES: Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is rare, rapidly progressive, potentially 
life-threatening disease, and it usually occurs in immunocompromised patients. 
We present our clinical experience with 12 cases and we attempt to identify the 
prognostic features and proper treatment protocols.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All the cases of mucormycosis were proven by histology or 
culture. The prognosis was analyzed according to the predisposing factors, 
including underlying disease, extent of disease and surgical intervention.
RESULT: The overall mortality rate in our series was 33.3%. 7 of the 10 operated 
patients recovered, while 1 of the 2 non-operated patients expired. The 
associated conditions included diabetes mellitus (n=9) and hematological disease 
(n=3). A poor prognosis was primarily related with uncontrolled underlying 
disease. Other associated prognostic factors were the extent of disease 
including orbital or intracranial extension. Surgical debridement is essential 
for a good prognosis, but timely intervention and complete aggressive 
debridement are not always needed in all patients. The patient who had slowly 
progressive disease also survived after conventional medical management and 
limited surgical debridement, including orbital preservation.
CONCLUSION: Control of the underlying predisposing illness along with prompt 
parenteral administration of amphotericin B and aggressive surgical debridement 
remain the essential treatments even today. Contrary to this, as described in 
this study, for the patients with slowly progressive disease, the aggressive 
surgical debridement is spared, and a successful result may be obtained with the 
conventional management, including medical treatment and timely limited surgical 
intervention.

Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. w.nijdam@erasmusmc.nl

PURPOSE: Based on earlier studies we were interested in finding out if 
longitudinal assessment of quality of life (QoL) and costs in long-term 
survivors of oropharyngeal cancers treated with external beam radiation therapy 
and brachytherapy (BT) or surgery and postoperative radiotherapy showed a change 
in QoL over the years. Besides, we were curious to know how much the costs per 
life year and the QALY would be for this patient group.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Performance status scales: eating in public, 
understandability of speech, normalcy of diet, xerostomia and ability to swallow 
were determined in 2003 and 2005. In 2005, the responses to EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC 
H&N35, and the Euroqol questionnaire were also measured. Costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated.
RESULTS: Eating in public, understandability of speech, and normalcy of diet 
significantly differed in favor of BT. Surgical patients experienced more 
speech, teeth, and mouth-opening problems. Mean costs and QALYs for BT were 
16,112 euros and 56,060 euros and for surgery 26,590 euros and 93,275 euros, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: QoL scores don't change over time. Due to the number of admission 
days, surgery is more costly. Difference in costs for QALYs in favor of BT was 
observed.

The Boston-type craniosynostosis mutation MSX2 (P148H) results in enhanced 
susceptibility of MSX2 to ubiquitin-dependent degradation.

Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 110-749, Korea.

Boston-type craniosynostosis is caused by a single amino acid substitution, 
P148H, in the transcription factor MSX2. The increased binding affinity of MSX2 
(P148H) to the response element has led many to hypothesize that the 
substitution is a gain-of-function mutation. However, there have been 
conflicting reports on the function of MSX2, and by extension, the nature of the 
P148H mutation remains unclear. In this study, we have examined the molecular 
mechanism of MSX2 function and the nature of the P148H mutation. During cranial 
suture closure of rodent, Msx2 expression was detected in the suture space. 
Overexpression of wild type MSX2 in mesenchymal cells stimulated cell 
proliferation and cyclin D1 expression, whereas P148H mutant did not. These 
results indicated that MSX2 is involved in maintaining the suture space by 
stimulating suture mesenchymal cell proliferation and that P148H is defective in 
this process. The protein levels of P148H were lower than wild type Msx2 
(Msx2-WT), and pulse-chase experiments indicated that the mutant protein has a 
shorter half-life than the Msx2-WT protein. The ubiquitylation level of P148H 
was greater than that of Msx2-WT. The degradation of Msx2 was mediated by 
Praja1, and the P148H mutant was degraded more effectively than WT. The 
ubiquitylation of Msx2-WT was higher in the presence of Msx2 (P148H), which 
indicated that P148H functions as a dominant-negative mutant. Collectively, the 
primary function of MSX2 in suture closure is the induction of cell 
proliferation and suture maintenance, and the mutation results in an increased 
susceptibility of both wild type and mutant MSX2 to proteasomal degradation.

Life expectancy, complications, and causes of death in patients with achalasia: 
results of a 33-year follow-up investigation.

Eckardt VF(1), Hoischen T, Bernhard G.

Author information:

Germany. eckardt.gastro@dkd-wiesbaden.de

BACKGROUND: Patients with achalasia require repeated invasive therapies and may 
experience multiple complications. The objectives of this study were to 
determine the incidence of such complications, causes of death, and life 
expectancy in 253 patients.
METHODS: Patients consisted of two groups: group A comprised 177 patients with 
newly diagnosed achalasia; group B consisted of 76 patients in whom the 
diagnosis had been established in external institutions. All patients regularly 
underwent structured interviews and were reinvestigated if changes in health 
status occurred. Survival rates were determined by Kaplan-Meier estimates and 
were compared with those of an average German population. Causes of death were 
determined from hospital records, information supplied by private physicians, 
and from death certificates.
RESULTS: Complete follow-up was obtained in 98.9% (group A) and in 100% (group 
B) of all patients. The observation period for group A ranged from 2 to 33 years 
and for group B from 2 to 26 years (disease duration: 4-68 years). The most 
frequent complications were reflux esophagitis (group A: 6.2%, group B: 19.7%) 
and megaesophagus (group A: 6.2%, group B: 21.0%). Thirty-six patients had died 
during follow-up. Five of these deaths were related to achalasia. In group A, 
the estimated 20-year survival rates in patients with achalasia [76% (95% 
confidence interval (CI): 66-85%)] did not significantly differ from those in 
controls 80% (95% CI: 71-89%). In group B, 25-year survival rates were also 
similar in patients [87% (95% CI: 78-97%)] and controls [86% (95% CI: 76-97%)].
CONCLUSION: Patients with achalasia experience a significant number of 
complications. Causes of death and life expectancy, however, do not differ from 
those of the average population.

Predicting prognosis is the key factor in selecting the proper treatment 
modality for patients with spinal metastases. Therefore, various assessment 
systems have been designed in order to provide a basis for deciding the course 
of treatment. Such systems have been proposed by Tokuhashi, Sioutos, Tomita, Van 
der Linden, and Bauer. The scores differ greatly in the kind of parameters 
assessed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of each 
score. Eight parameters were assessed for 69 patients (37 male, 32 female): 
location, general condition, number of extraspinal bone metastases, number of 
spinal metastases, visceral metastases, primary tumour, severity of spinal cord 
palsy, and pathological fracture. Scores according to Tokuhashi (original and 
revised), Sioutos, Tomita, Van der Linden, and Bauer were assessed as well as a 
modified Bauer score without scoring for pathologic fracture. Nineteen patients 
were still alive as of September 2006 with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. All 
other patients died after a mean period of 17 months after operation. The mean 
overall survival period was only 3 months for lung cancer, followed by prostate 
(7 months), kidney (23 months), breast (35 months), and multiple myeloma (51 
months). At univariate survival analysis, primary tumour and visceral metastases 
were significant parameters, while Karnofsky score was only significant in the 
group including myeloma patients. In multivariate analysis of all seven 
parameters assessed, primary tumour and visceral metastases were the only 
significant parameters. Of all seven scoring systems, the original Bauer score 
and a Bauer score without scoring for pathologic fracture had the best 
association with survival (P < 0.001). The data of the present study emphasize 
that the original Bauer score and a modified Bauer score without scoring for 
pathologic fracture seem to be practicable and highly predictive preoperative 
scoring systems for patients with spinal metastases. However, decision for or 
against surgery should never be based alone on a prognostic score but should 
take symptoms like pain or neurological compromise into account.

[A comparison of life expectancy between the urban and rural residents in China,

Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100005, China.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the life expectancies between the urban and rural 
residents, and to evaluate the influence of ages and diseases on the differences 
in life expectancy.
METHODS: Life tables, decomposition of life expectancy, the index of relative 
change in temporary life expectancies were used in our study.
RESULTS: In recent years the life expectancy of rural population growth and 
growth rate were higher than those in the urban. The contribution of children on 
the urban-rural difference of life expectancy was reducing, while it was 
increasing in the middle and older adults. Respiratory diseases, cancer, 
circulation diseases, as well as injury and poisoning could interpret the most 
discrepancy of the urban-rural gaps on life expectancy. It is worth noting that 
different age groups in the major cause of death had different impact on the 
urban-rural difference of life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: In order to narrow the gap of life expectancy, we should take 
measures to improve the health of the middle-aged and elderly populations, in 
which respiratory diseases, cancer and circulation diseases should have been the 
focus of concern.

Embryonic desiccation resistance in Aedes aegypti: presumptive role of the 
chitinized serosal cuticle.

Cruz, FIOCRUZ and Laboratório de Entomologia, Instituto de Biologia do Exército, 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. rezendeg@ioc.fiocruz.br

BACKGROUND: One of the major problems concerning dengue transmission is that 
embryos of its main vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti, resist desiccation, 
surviving several months under dry conditions. The serosal cuticle (SC) 
contributes to mosquito egg desiccation resistance, but the kinetics of SC 
secretion during embryogenesis is unknown. It has been argued that mosquito SC 
contains chitin as one of its components, however conclusive evidence is still 
missing.
RESULTS: We observed an abrupt acquisition of desiccation resistance during Ae. 
aegypti embryogenesis associated with serosal cuticle secretion, occurring at 
complete germ band extension, between 11 and 13 hours after egglaying. After SC 
formation embryos are viable on dry for at least several days. The presence of 
chitin as one of the SC constituents was confirmed through Calcofluor and WGA 
labeling and chitin quantitation. The Ae. aegypti Chitin Synthase A gene 
(AaCHS1) possesses two alternatively spliced variants, AaCHS1a and AaCHS1b, 
differentially expressed during Ae. aegypti embryonic development. It was 
verified that at the moment of serosal cuticle formation, AaCHS1a is the sole 
variant specifically expressed.
CONCLUSION: In addition to the peritrophic matrix and exoskeleton, these 
findings confirm chitin is also present in the mosquito serosal cuticle. They 
also point to the role of the chitinized SC in the desiccation resistance of Ae. 
aegypti eggs. AaCHS1a expression would be responsible for SC chitin synthesis. 
With this embryological approach we expect to shed new light regarding this 
important physiological process related to the Ae. aegypti life cycle.
