Cystic fibrosis (CF) is widely known as a disease of the lung, even though it is 
in truth a systemic disease, whose symptoms typically manifest in 
gastrointestinal dysfunction first. CF ultimately impairs not only the pancreas 
and intestine but also the lungs, gonads, liver, kidneys, bones, and the 
cardiovascular system. It is caused by one of several mutations in the gene of 
the epithelial ion channel protein CFTR. Intense research and improved 
antimicrobial treatments during the past eight decades have steadily increased 
the predicted life expectancy of a person with CF (pwCF) from a few weeks to 
over 50 years. Moreover, several drugs ameliorating the sequelae of the disease 
have become available in recent years, and notable treatments of the root cause 
of the disease have recently generated substantial improvements in health for 
some but not all pwCF. Yet, numerous fundamental questions remain unanswered. 
Complicating CF, for instance in the lung, is the fact that the associated 
insufficient chloride secretion typically perturbs the electrochemical balance 
across epithelia and, in the airways, leads to the accumulation of thick, 
viscous mucus and mucus plaques that cannot be cleared effectively and provide a 
rich breeding ground for a spectrum of bacterial and fungal communities. The 
subsequent infections often become chronic and respond poorly to antibiotic 
treatments, with outcomes sometimes only weakly correlated with the drug 
susceptibility of the target pathogen. Furthermore, in contrast to rapidly 
resolved acute infections with a single target pathogen, chronic infections 
commonly involve multi-species bacterial communities, called "infection 
microbiomes," that develop their own ecological and evolutionary dynamics. It is 
presently impossible to devise mathematical models of CF in its entirety, but it 
is feasible to design models for many of the distinct drivers of the disease. 
Building upon these growing yet isolated modeling efforts, we discuss in the 
following the feasibility of a multi-scale modeling framework, known as 
template-and-anchor modeling, that allows the gradual integration of refined 
sub-models with different granularity. The article first reviews the most 
important biomedical aspects of CF and subsequently describes mathematical 
modeling approaches that already exist or have the potential to deepen our 
understanding of the multitude aspects of the disease and their 
interrelationships. The conceptual ideas behind the approaches proposed here do 
not only pertain to CF but are translatable to other systemic diseases. This 
article is categorized under: Congenital Diseases > Computational Models.

Self-Care Practices and Their Role in the Control of Diabetes: A Narrative 
Review.

Meghe Institute of Higher Education and Research, Wardha, IND.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a long-standing, continuously growing metabolic 
ailment in which levels of glucose in the blood increase due to a total (DM of 
type 1) or incomplete (DM of type 2) decrease in the level of the hormone 
insulin. Diabetes mellitus affects a large number of individuals worldwide, and 
as more people develop the disease, the burden will double from what it is now. 
The requirements of people suffering from diabetes are not only confined to the 
control of blood glucose; there is also a need to prevent disabilities, side 
effects, and difficulties in rehabilitation. Studies suggest that seven 
self-care practices for individuals suffering from this disease have shown good 
outcomes. Those practices include assessment of sugar levels in the blood, 
consuming healthy foods, remaining physically active, taking medications 
regularly and on time, maintaining healthy behavior, and decreasing risk 
factors. All of these practices collectively have shown good results in 
maintaining blood glucose levels, decreasing side effects, and increasing life 
expectancy in people with diabetes mellitus. Those who have DM and practice 
self-care have shown positive results by reducing the complications of DM, 
decreasing its progression, and leading to a huge reduction in the burden due to 
DM. Despite these positive changes, people sticking to these self-care practices 
are very few, specifically when we see broad and chronic changes. There are many 
positive contributing factors, such as social factors, demographic factors, and 
various socio-economic factors, but the role of physicians in increasing the 
practices associated with personal care for people with this disease is crucial 
and most important for the desired outcome. Keeping in mind the burden and 
multidimensional nature of the disorder, proper systematic and combined efforts 
are needed to increase these self-care practices in patients with diabetes to 
reduce any chronic side effects and complications.

BACKGROUND: Across the globe, obesity stands as a prominent public health 
concern, linked to a heightened susceptibility to a range of metabolic and 
cardiovascular disorders. This study reveals a disproportionate impact of 
obesity on African American (AA) communities, irrespective of socioeconomic 
status. Structural racism plays a critical role in perpetuating healthcare 
disparities between AA and other racial/ethnic groups in the United States. 
These disparities are reflected in limited access to nutritious food, safe 
exercise spaces, health insurance, and medical care, all of which significantly 
influence healthcare outcomes and obesity prevalence. Additionally, both 
conscious and unconscious interpersonal racism adversely affect obesity care, 
outcomes, and patient-healthcare provider interactions among Blacks.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze and compare obesity-related 
mortality rates among AAs, Whites, and other racial groups.
METHODOLOGY: We queried the CDC WONDER dataset, incorporating all US death 
certificates. During data extraction, various ICD 10 codes were used to denote 
different obesity categories: E66.1 (drug-induced obesity), E66.2 (severe 
obesity with alveolar hypoventilation), E66.3 (overweight), E66.8 (other forms 
of obesity), E66.9 (unspecified obesity), E66.0 (obesity due to excess calorie 
intake), E66.01 (severe obesity due to excess calories), and E66.09 (other forms 
of obesity caused by excess calorie intake). Our study encompassed decedents 
aged ≥15 years, with obesity-related diseases as the underlying cause of death 
from 2018 to 2021. Sex- and race-specific obesity-related mortality rates were 
examined for AAs, Whites, and other races. Resultant mortality trends were 
computed and presented as ratios comparing AA and White populations.
RESULTS: This study reveals lower obesity-related mortality rates in AAs 
compared to Whites. Furthermore, women exhibited higher rates than men. In the 
15 to 24 age bracket, males comprised 60.11% of the 361 deaths, whereas females 
made up 39.89%. In this demographic, 35.46% of deaths were among Blacks, with 
64.54% among Whites. Within the 25 to 34 age group, females constituted 37.26% 
of the 1943 deaths, and males 62.74%. Whites made up 62.94% of the fatalities, 
Blacks 33.40%, with other racial groups accounting for the remainder. These 
trends extended through the 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, and 75+ age categories, 
with variations in death proportions among genders and races. Whites 
consistently accounted for the highest death percentages across all age groups, 
followed by Blacks. Our data indicate that obesity-related mortality tends to 
occur earlier in life.
CONCLUSION: Our results corroborate previous studies linking elevated mortality 
risk to obesity and overweight conditions. The uniformity of our findings across 
age groups, as well as genders, supports the proposal for applying a single 
range of body weight throughout life. Given the ongoing rise in obesity and 
overweight conditions across the United States, excess mortality rates are 
projected to accelerate, potentially leading to decreased life expectancy. This 
highlights the urgency for developing and implementing effective strategies to 
control and prevent obesity nationwide.

USA.

The average life expectancy post-left ventricular assist device (LVAD) 
implantation has significantly increased in recent years. Impaired cellular 
immunity post-LVAD implantation has been suggested. It is not clear if a 
prolonged duration of LVAD support will lead to an increase in infections and 
possibly cause opportunistic infections, as seen in immunocompromised patients.
METHODS:  We retrospectively reviewed all the patients who underwent new 
continuous-flow (C-F) LVAD implantation between January 1, 2013, and December 
31, 2014, at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Patients were followed 
until heart transplant, LVAD explantation, death, or December 31, 2017. We 
defined LVAD infections as per the International Society of Heart and Lung 
Transplantation (ISHLT) definition: VAD-specific, VAD-related, and non-VAD 
infections. The primary outcome was to calculate the incidence of LVAD 
infections per 1000 days of LVAD support. Secondary outcomes were to assess the 
cause of death and the effect of bloodstream infections on LVAD thrombosis, 
stroke, and death.
RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 94 patients underwent a C-F LVAD 
implantation. Five patients were lost in follow-up; 89 patients were included in 
the study. The mean age at LVAD implantation was 54 (SD+15) years. Out of 89 
patients, 67 (75%) were men, and 53/89 (71%) received LVAD as destination 
therapy (DT). At the time of LVAD implantation, 34/89 (38%) patients had 
ITERMACS (interagency registry for mechanically assisted circulatory 
support) score 1 (cardiogenic shock). The median duration of LVAD support was 
387+493 days, with an interquartile range of 140 to 1083 days. The incidence 
rate of infections post-LVAD implantation decreased from 3.2 /1000 LVAD days 
(95% confidence interval [CI] 2.54-4.03) during the first year of LVAD support 
to 0.78/1000 LVAD days (95% CI, 0.38-1.65) during the following third year of 
LVAD support. Similarly, the incidence of VAD-specific infections in the first 
year post-LVAD implantation versus the third-year post LVAD implantation 
decreased from 0.83/1000 LVAD days (95% CI, 0.53-1.30) to 0.33/1000 LVAD days 
(95% CI, 0.10-1.04). On univariate survival analysis, an increased risk of death 
was associated with a one-year increase in age at LVAD implantation (hazard 
ratio (HR) 1.05 (95% CI, 1.01-1.09), p=0.01), the presence of infection within 
30 days before LVAD implantation (HR 2.44 (95% CI, 1.09-5.48), p=0.03), 
underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy (HR 2.96 (95% CI, 1.28-6.80), p=0.01), and 
lower ITERMACS profile HR 3.64 (95% CI, 1.09-12.13, p=0.04). Bloodstream 
infections (BSIs) were not associated with an increased risk of death (HR 1.63 
(95% CI, 0.56-4.80, p=0.37). Univariate survival analysis for poor outcomes 
(LVAD thrombosis, stroke, or death) showed BSIs increased the risk of having a 
poor outcome (HR 2.39 (95% CI, 1.02-5.57), p=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS:  The incidence rate of post-LVAD infections decreased significantly 
over time. LVAD implantation may not be contributing to immune suppression as 
previously suggested. In our study, BSIs were found to have a significantly 
increased hazard ratio for a poor outcome post-LVAD implantation.

Early-life stress experiences can produce lasting impacts on organismal 
adaptation and fitness. How transient stress elicits memory-like physiological 
effects is largely unknown. Here we show that early-life thermal stress strongly 
up-regulates tsp-1, a gene encoding the conserved transmembrane tetraspanin in 
C. elegans. TSP-1 forms prominent multimers and stable web-like structures 
critical for membrane barrier functions in adults and during aging. 
Up-regulation of TSP-1 is long lasting even after transient early-life stress. 
Such regulation requires CBP-1, a histone acetyl-transference that facilitates 
initial tsp-1 transcription. Tetraspanin webs form regular membrane structures 
and mediate resilience-promoting effects of early-life thermal stress. 
Gain-of-function TSP-1 confers striking C. elegans longevity extension and 
thermal resilience in human cells. Together, our results reveal a cellular 
mechanism by which early-life thermal stress produces long-lasting memory-like 
impact on organismal resilience and longevity.

Event-related potential (ERP) evidence for early visual processing differences 
in children and adults with Cystinosis (CTNS gene mutations).

BACKGROUND: Cystinosis, a rare lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in 
the CTNS gene, is characterized by cystine crystallization and accumulation 
within multiple tissues, including kidney and brain. Its impact on neural 
function appears mild relative to its effects on other organs during early 
disease, but since therapeutic advances have led to substantially increased life 
expectancy, neurological implications are of increasing interest, necessitating 
deeper understanding of the impact of cystinosis on neurocognitive function. 
Behavioral difficulties have been reported in cystinosis in the visual domain. 
Very little is known, however, about how the brains of people living with 
cystinosis process visual information. This is especially interesting given that 
cystine accumulation in the cornea and posterior ocular structures is a hallmark 
of cystinosis.
METHODS: Here, high-density scalp electrophysiology was recorded to visual 
stimuli (during a Go/No-Go task) to investigate early visual processing in 
individuals with cystinosis, compared to age-matched controls. Analyses focused 
on early stages of cortical visual processing.
RESULTS: The groups differed in their initial cortical response, with 
individuals with cystinosis exhibiting a significantly larger visual evoked 
potential (VEP) in the 130-150 ms time window. The groups also differed in the 
associations between neural responses and verbal abilities: While controls with 
higher IQ scores presented larger neural responses, that relationship was not 
observed in cystinosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The enlarged VEP in cystinosis could be the result of cortical 
hyperexcitability and/or differences in attentional engagement and explain, at 
least partially, the visual and visual-spatial difficulties described in this 
population.

Kinetic dissection of pre-crRNA binding and processing by CRISPR-Cas12a.

CRISPR-Cas12a binds and processes a single pre-crRNA during maturation, 
providing a simple tool for genome editing applications. Here, we constructed a 
kinetic and thermodynamic framework for pre-crRNA processing by Cas12a in vitro, 
and we measured the contributions of distinct regions of the pre-crRNA to this 
reaction. We find that the pre-crRNA binds rapidly and extraordinarily tightly 
to Cas12a (Kd = 0.6 pM), such that pre-crRNA binding is fully rate limiting for 
processing and therefore determines the specificity of Cas12a for different 
pre-crRNAs. The guide sequence contributes 10-fold to the affinities of both the 
precursor and mature forms of the crRNA, while deletion of an upstream sequence 
had no significant effect on affinity of the pre-crRNA. After processing, the 
mature crRNA remains very tightly bound to Cas12a, with a half-life of ~1 day 
and a Kd value of 60 pM. Addition of a 5'-phosphoryl group, which is normally 
lost during the processing reaction as the scissile phosphate, tightens binding 
of the mature crRNA by ~10-fold by accelerating binding and slowing 
dissociation. Using a direct competition assay, we found that pre-crRNA binding 
specificity is robust to other changes in RNA sequence, including tested changes 
in the guide sequence, addition of a 3' extension, and secondary structure 
within the guide region. Together our results provide a quantitative framework 
for pre-crRNA binding and processing by Cas12a and suggest strategies for 
optimizing crRNA design in some genome editing applications.

BACKGROUND: Structural valve dysfunction in bioprosthetic heart valves 
necessitates redo replacement procedure that are associated with high mortality 
and morbidity. The transcatheter valve-in-valve (VIV) approach has emerged as a 
preferred option for patients requiring redo procedures due to structural valve 
degeneration. We report from India the first case of the simultaneous 
transcatheter dual VIV implantation (mitral valve and tricuspid valves) in a 
high-surgical-risk patient.
CASE SUMMARY: A 57-year-old female was presented with a history of rheumatic 
heart disease, post-mitral valve as well as tricuspid valve replacement 
(perimount 33 mm) 11 years back. Bioprosthetic heart valve was chosen probably 
due to limited life expectancy and compliance issues with monitoring of 
international normalised ratio (INR). She now presented with progressive 
dyspnoea, oedema, and palpitations (New York Heart Association Class III) for 
the last 6 months. The patient was scheduled for transcatheter dual valve 
replacement simultaneously. The procedure was successful with a favourable 
outcome, short hospital stays, and early recovery.
DISCUSSION: This is the first case of simultaneous transcatheter dual valve 
replacement reported from India, which is fluoroscopically guided and supported 
by TEE. It is a valuable and considerable option for patients with failing 
bioprosthesis valves who are at increased peri-operative risk.

Extending selection criteria to face donor organ shortage in heart 
transplantation (HTx) may increase the risk of mortality. Ex-vivo normothermic 
perfusion (EVP) limits ischemic time allowing assessment of graft function. We 
investigated the outcome of HTx in 80 high-risk recipients transplanted with 
marginal donor and EVP-preserved grafts, from 2016 to 2021. The recipients 
median age was 57 years (range, 13-75), with chronic renal failure in 61%, 
impaired liver function in 11% and previous cardiac surgery in 90%; 80% were 
mechanically supported. Median RADIAL score was 3. Mean graft ischemic time was 
118 ± 25 min, "out-of-body" time 420 ± 66 min and median cardiopulmonary bypass 
(CPB) time 228 min (126-416). In-hospital mortality was 11% and ≥moderate 
primary graft dysfunction 16%. At univariable analysis, CPB time and high 
central venous pressure were risk factors for mortality. Actuarial survival at 1 
and 3 years was 83% ± 4%, and 72% ± 7%, with a median follow-up of 16 months 
(range 2-43). Recipient and donor ages, pre-HTx extracorporeal life support and 
intra-aortic balloon pump were risk factors for late mortality. In conclusion, 
the use of EVP allows extension of the graft pool by recruitment of marginal 
donors to successfully perform HTx even in high-risk recipients.

Modern medicine has developed a myriad of therapeutic drugs against a wide range 
of human diseases leading to increased life expectancy and better quality of 
life for millions of people. Despite the undeniable benefit of medical 
advancements in pharmaceutical technology, many of the most effective drugs 
currently in use have serious limitations such as off target side effects 
resulting in systemic toxicity. New generations of specialized drug constructs 
will enhance targeted therapeutic efficacy of existing and new drugs leading to 
safer and more effective treatment options for a variety of human ailments. As 
one of the most efficient drugs known for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, 
Amiodarone presents the same conundrum of serious systemic side effects 
associated with long term treatment. In this article we present the synthesis of 
a next-generation prodrug construct of amiodarone for the purpose of advanced 
targeting of cardiac arrhythmias by delivering the drug to cardiomyocytes using 
a novel cardiac targeting peptide, a cardiomyocyte-specific cell penetrating 
peptide. Our in vivo studies in guinea pigs indicate that cardiac targeting 
peptide-amiodarone conjugate is able to have similar effects on calcium handling 
as amiodarone at 1/15th the total molar dose of amiodarone. Further studies are 
warranted in animal models of atrial fibrillation to show efficacy of this 
conjugate.

Isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (IDDVT) is a frequent manifestation of 
venous thromboembolism (VTE), accounting for up to 50% cases of lower‑extremity 
deep vein thrombosis (DVT). As compared with proximal DVT, IDDVT is more 
frequently associated with transient risk factors and less often occurs 
unprovoked or in the presence of permanent risk factors. IDDVT generally carries 
a significantly lower risk of proximal extension, post‑thrombotic syndrome, and 
recurrence than proximal DVT. Nevertheless, some patient subgroups, such as 
those with active cancer, other predisposing permanent risk factors, prior VTE, 
unprovoked IDDVT, persistently restricted mobility, and trifurcation or 
bilateral involvement, exhibit a non‑negligible recurrence risk. Unlike in 
proximal DVT, the optimal therapeutic management of IDDVT remains uncertain. In 
clinical practice, the vast majority of IDDVT patients are managed with 
anticoagulation rather than with surveillance serial compression 
ultrasonography, which tends to be reserved to individuals at a high bleeding 
risk. Available data seem to favor anticoagulant therapy over no 
anticoagulation, thanks to a significant reduction in the risk for proximal 
extension and recurrence, without increased bleeding risk. Recent results of the 
RIDTS (Rivaroxaban for the Treatment of Symptomatic Isolated Distal Deep Vein 
Thrombosis) randomized clinical trial with rivaroxaban further support the use 
of anticoagulant therapy for 3 months over shorter durations (eg, ≤6 weeks). In 
this review, we offer an updated overview of the epidemiology, risk factors, and 
clinical course of IDDVT, with a focus on the therapeutic management in light of 
current guideline recommendations and most recent evidence. We also present 
real‑life clinical cases of IDDVT with proposed therapeutic approaches, and 
highlight major challenges and gaps in this field.

Fresh wet noodles (FWNs) are popular among people and have attracted increasing 
attention because of their characteristics of freshness, chewiness, good taste, 
and better maintenance of noodle flavor. However, due to the high moisture 
content and abundance of nutrients in FWN, they are prone to spoilage, which 
shortens their shelf life and reduces their quality, greatly restricting their 
large-scale production. Therefore, seeking effective preservation methods to 
prolong the shelf life is a major breakthrough for the industrialization of FWN. 
The present review provides a comprehensive overview of the main factors that 
contribute to the spoilage and degradation of FWN. These factors encompass 
microorganisms, moisture content, nutritional composition, enzymes, and storage 
temperature. Moreover, the recent developments in novel shelf-life extension 
technology applied to FWN, such as chemical preservatives, natural 
preservatives, physical treatment technologies, and composite preservation 
technology, are presented and discussed. From the literature reviewed, the 
application of technologies, such as adding preservatives, modified atmosphere 
packaging, microwave, cold plasma, ozone, and other technologies, has a certain 
effect on improving the shelf life of FWN, but the single preservation 
technology still has some deficiencies. In order to further improve the 
preservation efficiency, using two or more preservation methods is an important 
direction for future research on the preservation technology of FWN.

"Post-Protean" Public Health and the Geroscience Hypothesis.

Farrelly C(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Political Studies, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, K7L 
3N6, Canada.

Despite unprecedented investments in public health and biomedical research, 
improvements in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy have stagnated in 
the United States. Part of the reason for this development can be traced back to 
the influence of "Protean" over "Post-Protean" public health, the names that can 
be given to two contrasting visions of public health advanced in the early 
twentieth century. Protean public health prescribes "waging a war" against 
disease and was successful in reducing the early-life mortality risks from 
infectious disease. But Protean public health has proven less effective in 
improving the quality of life of older persons. Post-Protean public health 
prioritizes the experimental method and research into the indirect methods of 
improving health. It articulated a vision of public heath that was given a more 
concrete specification by Alex Comfort in what is now referred to as the 
Geroscience Hypothesis. To improve the health prospects of aging populations the 
dominance of Protean public health must be relaxed, to enable the benefits of 
Post-Protean public health to be realized. Doing so means shifting public 
health's aspirations towards increasing the healthspan vs "saving lives" by 
extending the duration of time older persons can survive by managing the 
multi-morbidities of late life.

INTRODUCTION: Due to the improved overall survival and life expectancy of older 
women with breast cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) arose as the primary 
cause of non-cancer-related deaths in this population. Therefore, assessing the 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of breast cancer patients with comorbid 
CVD is becoming increasingly vital. Our study aimed to evaluate the association 
between comorbid CVD and HRQoL among older women with early-stage breast cancer 
who are receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) in the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the 
2006-2017 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare Health Outcomes 
Survey data. We identified female patients over the age of 65 who were diagnosed 
with stage I-III hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and treated with AET. 
HRQoL was assessed by the physical and mental component summary (PCS & MCS) in 
the health survey. CVD was defined as a history of acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), angina, stroke, or other heart-related 
conditions. We performed multivariate linear regression models while controlling 
for covariates.
RESULTS: Among 3,904 older women, a history of CHF [β = -1.97, p = 0.025], 
stroke [β = -3.00, p < 0.010], or other heart-related condition [β = -1.10, 
p = 0.046] was significantly associated with lower PCS. However, no significant 
differences in PCS scores were found between women with a history of AMI or 
angina and those without these conditions. Having a history of CHF [β = -1.72, 
p = 0.033] or stroke [β = -1.48, p = 0.038] was significantly associated with 
lower MCS, whereas a history of angina, AMI, or other heart conditions was not 
associated with significant differences in MCS. Our study did not observe any 
significant differences in PCS and MCS between the two types AETs.
DISCUSSION: The study found that older women with early-stage breast cancer who 
were being treated with AETs had a lower HRQoL if they had a history of CHF or 
stroke. These comorbidities were identified as strong predictors for decreased 
HRQoL. The findings highlight the significance of managing cardiovascular 
diseases in such patients for better HRQoL while they receive AET treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Health administrative databases are widely used for the estimation 
of the prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD). Few in general, and none used in 
Italy, have been validated by testing their diagnostic accuracy. The primary 
objective was to validate two algorithms for the identification of persons with 
PD using clinical diagnosis as the reference standard on an Italian sample of 
people with PD. The second objective was to estimate 10-year trends in PD 
prevalence in the Bologna Local Health Trust from 2010 to 2019.
METHODS: Two algorithms (index tests) applied to health administrative databases 
(hospital discharge, drug prescriptions, exemptions for medical costs) were 
validated against clinical diagnosis of PD by an expert neurologist (reference 
standard) in a cohort of consecutive outpatients. Sensitivity and specificity 
with relative 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The prevalence of 
PD in a specific year was estimated as the ratio between the number of subjects 
fulfilling any criteria of the algorithm with better diagnostic accuracy and the 
total population in the same year (×1,000), stratified by age, sex, and district 
of residence.
RESULTS: The two algorithms showed high accuracy for identifying patients with 
PD: one with greater sensitivity of 94.2% (CI: 88.4-97.6) and the other with 
greater specificity of 98.1% (CI: 97.7-98.5). For the estimation of prevalence, 
we chose the most specific algorithm with the fewest total number of 
misclassified cases. We identified 3,798 people with PD as of December 31, 2019, 
corresponding to a prevalence of 4.3 per 1,000 inhabitants (CI: 4.2-4.4). 
Prevalence was higher in males (4.7, CI: 4.5-5.0) than females (3.8, CI: 
3.7-4.0) and increased with age. The crude prevalence over time was slightly 
elevated as it followed a progressive aging of the population. When stratifying 
the prevalence for age groups, we did not observe a trend except in the 45-64 
year category where we observed an increasing trend over time.
CONCLUSION: Algorithms based on administrative data are accurate when detecting 
people with PD in the Italian public health system. In a large northern Italian 
population, increased prevalence of about 10% was observed in the decade 
2010-2019 and is explained by increased life expectancy. These data may be 
useful in planning the allocation of health care resources for people with PD.

Spiders, silkworms, and many other animals can spin silk with exceptional 
properties. However, artificially spun fibers often fall short of their natural 
counterparts partly due sub-optimal production methods. A variety of methods, 
such as wet-, dry-, and biomimetic spinning have been used. The methods are 
based on extrusion, whereas natural spinning also involves pulling. Another 
shortcoming is that there is a lack feedback control during extension. Here we 
demonstrate a robotic fiber pulling device that enables controlled pulling of 
silk fibers and in situ measurement of extensional forces during the pulling and 
tensile testing of the pulled fibers. The pulling device was used to study two 
types of silk-one recombinant spider silk (a structural variant of ADF3) and one 
regenerated silk fibroin. Also, dextran-a branched polysaccharide-was used as a 
reference material for the procedure due to its straightforward preparation and 
storage. No post-treatments were applied. The pulled regenerated silk fibroin 
fibers achieved high tensile strength in comparison to similar extrusion-based 
methods. The mechanical properties of the recombinant spider silk fibers seemed 
to be affected by the liquid-liquid phase separation of the silk proteins.

BACKGROUND: Transport injuries (TIs) are a major cause of global 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and mortality. In this study, we aimed to 
assess the global burden and trends of TIs from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: We assessed the annual age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR) and 
age-standardised DALYs rate of TIs by sex, age, Social Development Index (SDI) 
and geographical region from 1990 to 2019 from the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2019. The changing trends were described by estimated annual percentage 
changes (EAPCs).
RESULTS: Globally, in 2019, the ASIR and age-standardised DALYs rates of TIs 
were 134 6.06/100 000 (95% UI 11 42.6/100 000-157 5.57/100 000) and 97 7.91/100 
000 (86 8.91/100 000-107 6.81/100 000), respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the 
global ASIR of TIs presented significant upwards trends with the EAPC (0.25%, 
95% CI 0.19% to 0.31%), and it was significantly increased in the age groups of 
15-49 (0.37%, 95% CI 0.29% to 0.45%), 50-69 (0.40%, 95% CI 0.36% to 0.44%) and 
70+ (0.22%, 95% CI 0.17% to 0.28%). Prominent increases in ASIR were detected in 
middle-SDI areas (0.72%, 95% CI 0.57% to 0.87%), low-middle SDI areas (0.66%, 
95% CI 0.59% to 0.72%) and low-SDI areas (0.21%, 95% CI 0.17% to 0.26%). The 
global age-standardised DALYs rate presented downwards trends with the EAPC 
(-1.27%, 95% CI -1.35% to -1.2%), and it was significantly decreased in all age 
groups and SDI areas.
CONCLUSION: Globally, TIs still cause a serious burden, and the incidence has 
significantly increased, especially in people above the age of 14 and in 
middle-SDI and low-SDI areas, thus necessitating more attention and health 
interventions.
