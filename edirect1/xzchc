although this syndrome can be diagnosed and eliminated even at the earliest 
stages of its development. Thus, in women carrying any of the above SNPs, 
preventive treatment of this syndrome before a planned pregnancy can reduce the 
risk of death. Similarly, seven SNP markers predicted here (e.g., rs774688955) 
can elevate the risk of myocardial infarction. In line with Bowles' lifespan 
theory, women carrying any of these SNPs may modify their lifestyle to improve 
their longevity if they can take under advisement that risks of myocardial 
infarction increase with age of the mother, total number of pregnancies, in 
multiple pregnancies, pregnancies under the age of 20, hypertension, 
preeclampsia, menstrual cycle irregularity, and in women smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: According to Bowles' lifespan theory-which links reproductive 
potential, quality of life, and life expectancy-the above information was 
compiled for those who would like to reduce risks of diseases corresponding to 
alleles in own sequenced genomes. Candidate SNP markers can focus the clinical 
analysis of unannotated SNPs, after which they may become useful for people who 
would like to bring their lifestyle in line with their sequenced individual 
genomes.

BACKGROUND: Management of gallbladder wall calcifications has been controversial 
for many decades. Although the traditionally perceived strong association with 
gallbladder cancer mandated prophylactic cholecystectomy, newer evidence 
suggests a much lesser association and might indicate an observational approach.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of 113 patients with gallbladder wall 
calcifications diagnosed between 2004 and 2016 at a single institution was 
conducted. Radiographic re-review identified patients with definitive (n = 70) 
and highly probable (n = 43) gallbladder wall calcifications. Patients were 
categorized according to their designated treatment plan.
RESULTS: In the observation group (n = 90), delayed cholecystectomy for 
gallbladder-related symptoms was necessary in 4 patients (4%). None of the 
patients in this group were diagnosed with a gallbladder malignancy during a 
mean of 3.2 ± 3.2 years follow-up. In the operative group (n = 23), 
peri-operative complications occurred in 13%, and gallbladder malignancy was 
found in 2 patients. In comparison, although patients in the observation group 
were older and had more comorbidities, the rate of adverse events was not 
significantly different (4% vs 13%; p = 0.15) with an overall low risk for 
potentially life-threatening complications to the patient when observed 
clinically.
CONCLUSIONS: For management of gallbladder wall calcifications, observation 
appears to provide no significant difference in adverse events, including the 
risk of gallbladder malignancy developing, compared with an operative approach. 
Although there is a need for intervention in the presence of symptoms and 
findings suggestive of malignancy, prophylactic cholecystectomy should be 
avoided in patients with limited life expectancy and significant comorbidities.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) has 
gained rather widespread acceptance as a method to mitigate risk to the lumbar 
plexus during lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) surgery. The most common 
approach to IONM involves using only electromyography (EMG) monitoring, and the 
rate of postoperative deficit remains unacceptably high. Other test modalities, 
such as transcranial electric motor-evoked potentials (tcMEPs) and 
somatosensory-evoked potentials, may be more suitable for monitoring neural 
integrity, but they have not been widely adopted during LLIF. Recent studies 
have begun to examine their utility in monitoring LLIF surgery with favorable 
results.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different IONM paradigms 
in the prevention of iatrogenic neurologic sequelae during LLIF and to 
specifically evaluate the utility of including tcMEPs in an IONM strategy for 
LLIF surgery.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A non-randomized, retrospective analysis of 479 LLIF 
procedures at a single institution over a 4-year period was conducted. During 
the study epoch, three different IONM strategies were used for LLIF procedures: 
(1) surgeon-directed T-EMG monitoring ("SD-EMG"), (2) 
neurophysiologist-controlled T-EMG monitoring ("NC-EMG"), and (3) 
neurophysiologist-controlled T-EMG monitoring supplemented with MEP monitoring 
("NC-MEP").
PATIENT SAMPLE: The patient population comprised 254 men (53.5%) and 221 women 
(46.5%). Patient age ranged from a minimum of 21 years to a maximum of 89 years, 
with a mean of 56.6 years.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Physician-documented physiological measures included manual 
muscle test grading of hip-flexion, hip-adduction, or knee-extension, as well as 
hypo- or hyperesthesia of the groin or anterolateral thigh on the surgical side. 
Self-reported measures included numbness or tingling in the groin or 
anterolateral thigh on the surgical side.
METHODS: Patient progress notes were reviewed from the postoperative period up 
to 12 months after surgery. The rates of postoperative sensory-motor deficit 
consistent with lumbar plexopathy or peripheral nerve palsy on the surgical side 
were compared between the three cohorts.
RESULTS: Using the dependent measure of neurologic deficit, whether motor or 
sensory, patients with NC-MEP monitoring had the lowest rate of immediate 
postoperative deficit (22.3%) compared with NC-EMG monitoring (37.1%) and SD-EMG 
monitoring (40.4%). This result extended to sensory deficits consistent with 
lumbar plexopathy (pure motor deficits being excluded); patients with NC-MEP 
monitoring had the lowest rate (20.5%) compared with NC-EMG monitoring (34.3%) 
and SD-EMG monitoring (36.9%). Additionally, evaluation of postoperative motor 
deficits consistent with peripheral nerve palsy (pure sensory deficits being 
excluded) revealed that the NC-MEP group had the lowest rate (5.7%) of motor 
deficit compared with the SD-EMG (17.0%) and NC-EMG (17.1%) cohorts. Finally, 
when assessing only those patients whose last follow-up was greater than or 
equal to 12 months (n=251), the rate of unresolved motor deficits was 
significantly lower in the NC-MEP group (0.9%) compared with NC-EMG (6.9%) and 
SD-EMG (11.0%). A comparison of the NC-MEP versus NC-EMG and SD-EMG groups, both 
independently and combined, was statistically significant (>95% confidence 
level) for all analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicate that preservation of 
tcMEPs from the adductor longus, quadriceps, and tibialis anterior muscles are 
of paramount importance for limiting iatrogenic sensory and motor injuries 
during LLIF surgery. In this regard, the inclusion of tcMEPs serves to 
compliment EMG and allows for the periodic, functional assessment of at-risk 
nerves during these procedures. Thus, tcMEPs appear to be the most effective 
modality for the prevention of both transient and permanent neurologic injury 
during LLIF surgery. We propose that the standard paradigm for protecting the 
nervous system during LLIF be adapted to include tcMEPs.

With advances in healthcare and an ageing population, the number of older adults 
with epilepsy is set to rise substantially across the world. In developed 
countries the highest incidence of epilepsy is already in people over 65 and, as 
life expectancy increases, individuals who developed epilepsy at a young age are 
also living longer. Recent findings show that older persons with epilepsy are 
more likely to suffer from cognitive dysfunction and that there might be an 
important bidirectional relationship between epilepsy and dementia. Thus some 
people with epilepsy may be at a higher risk of developing dementia, while 
individuals with some forms of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease and 
vascular dementia, are at significantly higher risk of developing epilepsy. 
Consistent with this emerging view, epidemiological findings reveal that people 
with epilepsy and individuals with Alzheimer's disease share common risk 
factors. Recent studies in Alzheimer's disease and late-onset epilepsy also 
suggest common pathological links mediated by underlying vascular changes and/or 
tau pathology. Meanwhile electrophysiological and neuroimaging investigations in 
epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia have focused interest on 
network level dysfunction, which might be important in mediating cognitive 
dysfunction across all three of these conditions. In this review we consider 
whether seizures promote dementia, whether dementia causes seizures, or if 
common underlying pathophysiological mechanisms cause both. We examine the 
evidence that cognitive impairment is associated with epilepsy in older people 
(aged over 65) and the prognosis for patients with epilepsy developing dementia, 
with a specific emphasis on common mechanisms that might underlie the cognitive 
deficits observed in epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. Our analyses suggest that 
there is considerable intersection between epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease and 
cerebrovascular disease raising the possibility that better understanding of 
shared mechanisms in these conditions might help to ameliorate not just 
seizures, but also epileptogenesis and cognitive dysfunction.

Traditional identification of thrips species based on morphology is difficult, 
laborious, and especially challenging for immature thrips. To support monitoring 
and management efforts of thrips as consistent and widespread pests of cotton 
(Gossypium hirsutum L.), a probe-based quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay with crude 
DNA extraction was developed to allow efficient and specific identification of 
the primary species of thrips infesting cotton. The assay was applied to 
identify over 5,000 specimens of thrips (including 3,366 immatures) collected on 
cotton seedlings from Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and 
Virginia in 2016. One half of all adult samples were examined by morphological 
identification, which provided a statistically equivalent species composition as 
the qPCR method. Frankliniella fusca (Hinds) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) was the 
dominant species across all the locations (76.8-94.3% of adults and 81.6-98.0% 
of immatures), followed by Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: 
Thripidae) in Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia (4.6-19% of adults and 
1.7-17.3% of immatures) or Frankliniella tritici (Fitch) (Thysanoptera: 
Thripidae) in South Carolina (10.8% of adults and 7.8% of immatures). Thrips 
tabaci (Lindeman) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) and Neohydatothrips variabilis 
(Beach) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) were occasionally found among adults but were 
rarely present among immature thrips. These five species of thrips represented 
98.2-100% of samples collected across the Southeast. The qPCR assay was 
demonstrated to be a valuable tool for large-scale monitoring of species 
composition of thrips at different life stages in cotton. The tool will 
contribute to a better understanding of thrips population structure in cotton 
and could assist with development and application of improved management 
strategies.

BACKGROUND: Euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) have been legally possible in 
the Netherlands since 2001, provided that statutory due care criteria are met, 
including: (a) voluntary and well-considered request; (b) unbearable suffering 
without prospect of improvement; (c) informing the patient; (d) lack of a 
reasonable alternative; (e) independent second physician's opinion. 'Unbearable 
suffering' must have a medical basis, either somatic or psychiatric, but there 
is no requirement of limited life expectancy. All EAS cases must be reported and 
are scrutinised by regional review committees (RTE). The purpose of this study 
was to investigate whether any particular difficulties arise when the EAS due 
care criteria are applied to patients with an intellectual disability and/or 
autism spectrum disorder.
METHODS: The 416 case summaries available on the RTE website (2012-2016) were 
searched for intellectual disability (6) and autism spectrum disorder (3). 
Direct content analysis was used on these nine cases.
RESULTS: Assessment of decisional capacity was mentioned in eight cases, but few 
details given; in two cases, there had been uncertainty or disagreement about 
capacity. Two patients had progressive somatic conditions. For most, suffering 
was due to an inability to cope with changing circumstances or increasing 
dependency; in several cases, suffering was described in terms of 
characteristics of living with an autism spectrum disorder, rather than an 
acquired medical condition. Some physicians struggled to understand the 
patient's perspective. Treatment refusal was a common theme, leading physicians 
to conclude that EAS was the only remaining option. There was a lack of detail 
on social circumstances and how patients were informed about their prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Autonomy and decisional capacity are highly complex for patients 
with intellectual disabilities and difficult to assess; capacity tests in these 
cases did not appear sufficiently stringent. Assessment of suffering is 
particularly difficult for patients who have experienced life-long disability. 
The sometimes brief time frames and limited number of physician-patient meetings 
may not be sufficient to make a decision as serious as EAS. The Dutch EAS due 
care criteria are not easily applied to people with intellectual disabilities 
and/or autism spectrum disorder, and do not appear to act as adequate 
safeguards.

BACKGROUND: Patients with prostate cancer (PC) may be ready to make trade-offs 
between their quantity and their quality of life. For instance, elderly patients 
may prefer the absence of treatment if it is associated with a low-risk of 
disease progression, compared to treatments aiming at preventing disease 
progression but with a substantial deterioration of their Health-Related Quality 
of Life (HRQoL). Therefore, it seems relevant to compare the treatments by 
considering both survival and HRQoL. In this mini-review, the aim was to 
question whether the potential trade-offs between survival and HRQoL are 
considered in high impact factor journals.
METHODS: The study was conducted from the PubMed database for recent papers 
published between May 01, 2013, and May 01, 2015. We also restricted our search 
to nine medical journals with 2013 impact factor > 15.
RESULTS: Among the 30 selected studies, only six collected individual HRQoL as a 
secondary endpoint by using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate 
(FACT-P) questionnaire. In four studies, the time to HRQoL change was analyzed, 
but its definitions varied. In two studies, the mean changes in HRQoL between 
the baseline and the 12- or 16-week follow-up were analyzed. None of the six 
studies reported in a single endpoint both the quantity and the quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Our mini-review, which only focused on recent publications in 
journals with high-impact, suggests moving PC clinical research towards 
patient-centered outcomes-based studies. This may help physicians to propose the 
most appropriate treatment on behalf of patients. We recommend the use of 
indicators such as Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) as principal endpoint in 
future clinical trials.

Developments in managing CF continue to drive dramatic improvements in survival. 
As newborn screening rolls-out across Europe, CF centres are increasingly caring 
for cohorts of patients who have minimal lung disease on diagnosis. With the 
introduction of mutation-specific therapies and the prospect of truly 
personalised medicine, patients have the potential to enjoy good quality of life 
in adulthood with ever-increasing life expectancy. The landmark Standards of 
Care published in 2005 set out what high quality CF care is and how it can be 
delivered throughout Europe. This underwent a fundamental re-write in 2014, 
resulting in three documents; center framework, quality management and best 
practice guidelines. This document is a revision of the latter, updating 
standards for best practice in key aspects of CF care, in the context of a 
fast-moving and dynamic field. In continuing to give a broad overview of the 
standards expected for newborn screening, diagnosis, preventative treatment of 
lung disease, nutrition, complications, transplant/end of life care and 
psychological support, this consensus on best practice is expected to prove 
useful to clinical teams both in countries where CF care is developing and those 
with established CF centres. The document is an ECFS product and endorsed by the 
CF Network in ERN LUNG and CF Europe.

The polycomb repressor complex 2 molecule EZH2 is now known to play a role in 
essential cellular processes, namely, cell fate decisions, cell cycle 
regulation, senescence, cell differentiation, and cancer 
development/progression. EZH2 inhibitors have recently been developed; however, 
their effectiveness and underlying molecular mechanisms in many malignancies 
have not yet been elucidated in detail. Although the functional role of EZH2 in 
tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma (NB) has been investigated, mutations of EZH2 
have not been reported. A Kaplan-Meier analysis on the event free survival and 
overall survival of NB patients indicated that the high expression of EZH2 
correlated with an unfavorable prognosis. In order to elucidate the functional 
roles of EZH2 in NB tumorigenesis and its aggressiveness, we knocked down EZH2 
in NB cell lines using lentivirus systems. The knockdown of EZH2 significantly 
induced NB cell differentiation, e.g., neurite extension, and the neuronal 
differentiation markers, NF68 and GAP43. EZH2 inhibitors also induced NB cell 
differentiation. We performed a comprehensive transcriptome analysis using Human 
Gene Expression Microarrays and found that NTRK1 (TrkA) is one of the 
EZH2-related suppression targets. The depletion of NTRK1 canceled EZH2 
knockdown-induced NB cell differentiation. Our integrative methylome, 
transcriptome, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using NB cell lines and 
clinical samples clarified that the NTRK1 P1 and P2 promoter regions were 
regulated differently by DNA methylation and EZH2-related histone modifications. 
The NTRK1 transcript variants 1/2, which were regulated by EZH2-related H3K27me3 
modifications at the P1 promoter region, were strongly expressed in favorable, 
but not unfavorable NB. The depletion and inhibition of EZH2 successfully 
induced NTRK1 transcripts and functional proteins. Collectively, these results 
indicate that EZH2 plays important roles in preventing the differentiation of NB 
cells and also that EZH2-related NTRK1 transcriptional regulation may be the key 
pathway for NB cell differentiation.

This unique case series and review of literature suggests that immune checkpoint 
inhibitors may have clinical activity in neuroendocrine tumors.
OBJECTIVE: Summarize advances of immuno-oncology in neuroendocrine tumors with 
the help of a case series.
DESIGN: Case series and review of literature.
INTERVENTION OR EXPOSURE: The patients were treated with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (pembrolizumab or nivolumab).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESS: Life expectancy, quality of life, disease 
progression.
RESULTS: Maximum durable response of 16 months in one of the patients so far. 
All patients showed improvement in quality of life before disease progression. 
Two out of four are still on therapy. None of the patients experienced immune 
checkpoint inhibitor associated side-effects. All patients had failed standard 
of care therapy prior to the initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitors and were 
on the verge of hospice.
CONCLUSIONS: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer management 
and the last 5 years have seen a rapid expansion in the indications for this 
class of drug. Neuroendocrine tumors, unfortunately, have been slow to catch on 
to the immuno-oncology, partly due to difficulties in establishing relevant 
preclinical neuroendocrine tumors models for immune-oncology studies. In this 
manuscript, we review the current status of immunotherapy in neuroendocrine 
tumors.

BACKGROUND: There is an increasing push for dairy production to be 
scientifically grounded and ethically responsible in the oversight of animal 
health and well-being. Addressing underlying challenges affecting the quality 
and length of productive life necessitates novel assessment and accountability 
metrics. Human medical epidemiologists developed the Disability-Adjusted Life 
Year metric as a summary measure of health addressing the complementary nature 
of disease and death. The goal of this project was to develop and implement a 
dairy Disease-Adjusted Lactation (DALact) summary measure of health, as a 
comparison against cumulative disease frequency.
METHODS: A total of 5694 cows were enrolled at freshening from January 1st, 2014 
through May 26th, 2015 on 3 similarly managed U.S. Midwestern Plains' region 
dairies. Eleven health categories of interest were tracked from enrollment until 
culling, death, or the study's completion date. The DALact accounted for the 
days of life lost due to illness, forced removal, and death relative to the 
average lactation length across the participating farms.
RESULTS: The DALact consistently identified mastitis as the primary disease of 
concern on all 3 dairies (19,007-23,955 days lost). Secondary issues included 
musculoskeletal injuries (19,559 days), pneumonia (11,034 days), or lameness 
(8858 days). By comparison, cumulative frequency measures pointed to mastitis 
(31-50%) and lameness (25-54%) as the 2 most frequent diseases. Notably, the 
DALact provided a robust accounting of health events such as musculoskeletal 
injuries (5010-19,559 days) and calving trauma (2952-5868 days) otherwise 
overlooked by frequency measures (0-3%).
CONCLUSIONS: The DALact provides a time-based method for assessing the overall 
burden of disease on dairies. It is important to emphasize that a summary 
measure of dairy health goes beyond simply linking morbidity to culling and 
mortality in a standardized fashion. A summary measure speaks to the burden of 
disease on both the well-being and productivity of individuals and populations. 
When framed as lost days, years, or lactations the various health issues on a 
farm are more comprehensible than they may be by frequency measures alone. Such 
an alternative accounting of disease highlights the lost opportunity costs of 
production as well as the burden of disease on life as a whole.

Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Multiple Brain Metastases: Two Cases of Preserved 
Quality of Life.

Brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumors in the adult population 
and have been historically treated with whole brain radiation therapy 
(WBRT). However, as medical advances improve life expectancy, stereotactic 
radiosurgery (SRS) has replaced WBRT as the standard of care for limited (one to 
three) brain metastases due to the relative sparing of neurocognitive function 
(NCF) and therefore quality of life (QoL). The use of SRS has been less 
documented in the case of multiple (four or more) brain metastases, with 
literature limited to non-randomized studies showing comparable survival and 
local control. In this series, we detail the case of two individuals who 
received SRS at our institution for multiple brain metastases and demonstrated 
remarkable response. The first patient is a 78-year-old woman who received Gamma 
Knife (GK) treatment to 17 lesions at our institution. This patient responded 
very well to treatment and maintains an excellent quality of life, with no 
deficits on serial neurological examination as she continues to travel and drive 
for ridesharing businesses. The second patient is an active 44-year-old woman 
who received SRS to 24 lesions at our institution. The patient has now been free 
of intracranial failures for two years and continues fulfilling her love for 
travel and long-distance biking. SRS is emerging as an acceptable alternative to 
WBRT in treating multiple brain metastases due to its preservation of NCF. 
Because omission of WBRT may lead to increased probability of distant brain 
metastasis failure, it is critical to follow these patients closely with 
frequent neuroimaging. In the event of a failure, it is also possible to use SRS 
salvage therapy with good response. Some patients who receive SRS alone 
demonstrate exceptional outcomes with excellent QoL, and it is possible that 
certain prognostication factors such as performance status, tumor histology, and 
tumor volume may play a role in identifying these patients. The decision to 
treat a patient with SRS alone for multiple brain metastases should be made 
carefully with consideration of systemic therapeutic options, overall prognosis, 
and the patient's goals of care, with adherence to a careful follow-up plan by 
the physician and patient.

Breast cancer represents the second leading cause of brain metastases in women. 
Once diagnosed, brain metastases have been associated with a rapidly progressive 
and universally poor prognosis. Breast cancer patients, particularly those with 
advantageous disease characteristics, may achieve extended survival. This 
extended life expectancy highlights the importance of effective intracranial 
treatments that minimize treatment-related late toxicity. Whole brain radiation 
therapy (WBRT) remains a standard of care palliative option; however, concerns 
remain regarding the late neurocognitive effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery 
(SRS) provides dose-escalated radiation therapy over a shortened course, 
maintaining equivalent survival and minimizing normal brain tissue exposure. 
Herein, we present a breast cancer patient who demonstrated an exceptional 
response and remained functionally independent following 12 SRS courses 
targeting 14 unique brain metastases over eight years. The case illustrates the 
efficacy of SRS alone, as well as the comparable utility of multiple SRS 
treatment techniques (Gamma Knife (AB Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden), CyberKnife 
(Accuray, Sunnyvale, California), and TrueBeam (Varian Medical Systems, Palo 
Alto, California)).

DESCRIPTION: The American College of Physicians developed this guidance 
statement to guide clinicians in selecting targets for pharmacologic treatment 
of type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: The National Guideline Clearinghouse and the Guidelines International 
Network library were searched (May 2017) for national guidelines, published in 
English, that addressed hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) targets for treating type 2 
diabetes in nonpregnant outpatient adults. The authors identified guidelines 
from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Institute for 
Clinical Systems Improvement. In addition, 4 commonly used guidelines were 
reviewed, from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and 
American College of Endocrinology, the American Diabetes Association, the 
Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, and the U.S. Department of Veterans 
Affairs and Department of Defense. The AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for 
Research and Evaluation II) instrument was used to evaluate the guidelines.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 1: Clinicians should personalize goals for glycemic control 
in patients with type 2 diabetes on the basis of a discussion of benefits and 
harms of pharmacotherapy, patients' preferences, patients' general health and 
life expectancy, treatment burden, and costs of care.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 2: Clinicians should aim to achieve an HbA1c level between 7% 
and 8% in most patients with type 2 diabetes.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 3: Clinicians should consider deintensifying pharmacologic 
therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who achieve HbA1c levels less than 
6.5%.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 4: Clinicians should treat patients with type 2 diabetes to 
minimize symptoms related to hyperglycemia and avoid targeting an HbA1c level in 
patients with a life expectancy less than 10 years due to advanced age (80 years 
or older), residence in a nursing home, or chronic conditions (such as dementia, 
cancer, end-stage kidney disease, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease or congestive heart failure) because the harms outweigh the benefits in 
this population.

INTRODUCTION: Injuries of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) are of 
high clinical relevance; however, the clinical evidence for treatment is poor 
and long-term results are rarely published. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate the clinical outcome of symptomatic central traumatic lesions of the 
TFCC (Palmer 1A) following arthroscopic debridement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2013, 87 patients were arthroscopically 
diagnosed with Palmer 1A lesion and accordingly treated with debridement. 
Follow-up was available for 43 patients. Activities of daily living (ADLs) were 
measured with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) 
questionnaire. Pain perception was evaluated with visual analogue scale (VAS 
0-10). Grip strength and wrist motion were assessed with conventional techniques 
using a Jamar dynamometer and a goniometer. Patient satisfaction was assessed 
using a questionnaire at follow-up.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 42.5 months (range 5-70). The mean age of the 
patients (22 male and 21 female) at time of surgery was 41 ± 15.9 years. No 
major complication occurred during surgery and follow-up. The DASH score 
(preoperatively 49.8 ± 19.3 vs. postoperatively 14.1 ± 17.9, p < 0.05) and pain 
perception (VAS: preoperatively 7.2 ± 2.0 vs. postoperatively 1.4 ± 1.6, 
p < 0.05) improved significantly. Grip strength was satisfactory after surgery 
(19.6 ± 13.1). Ulnar deviation improved significantly from 29.3 ± 10.4° to 
35.6 ± 8.3° (p < 0.05) and wrist flexion improved from 53.8 ± 18.9° to 
67.4 ± 12.9° (p < 0.05). Wrist extension, radial deviation, pronation and 
supination did not change significantly after surgery. Improved symptoms were 
reported by 41/43 (95.3%) patients and 40/43 (93%) patients would have had the 
same procedure again knowing the final outcome. Six of 43 patients (15%) had an 
ulnar plus variance. None of these needed ulnar shortening.
CONCLUSIONS: Central traumatic TFCC lesions can safely be treated by 
arthroscopic debridement. We showed a sustained pain relief with significantly 
improved quality of life (DASH score) and wrist motion at follow-up. This 
resulted in a high patient satisfaction and acceptance of the procedure.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To characterize health burden and determine the 
associated level of equality of laryngeal carcinoma (LC) burden at a global 
level.
METHODS: One hundred eighty-four countries were organized by socioeconomic 
status using Human Development Index (HDI) categorizations provided by the 
United Nations Development Program. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 
obtained from The Global Health Data Exchange, were calculated and compared 
between each HDI category for the period from 1990 to 2015. Equality of LC 
burden was then evaluated with concentration indices.
RESULTS: Global LC burden, as measured by age-standardized DALYs, has improved 
significantly over the 25-year period studied. This burden has declined for very 
high, high, and medium HDI countries, whereas it has remained unchanged for low 
HDI countries. The majority of LC global burden was found in high socioeconomic 
countries before 2010 and has shifted toward low socioeconomic countries, as 
indicated by concentration indices. Over the last 25 years, Central and Eastern 
Europe continue to have the largest disease burden in the world.
CONCLUSION: This is the first analysis that we are aware of investigating health 
disparities of LC at a global level. The global burden of the disease has 
declined, which is a trend corresponding with significantly reduced smoking 
behaviors in developed countries. Although the global inequality gap decreased 
between 2010 and 2015, there remain reasons for concern. Smoking continues to 
trend upward in low socioeconomic countries, which could increase LC burden in 
low socioeconomic countries in the near future. A new global initiative directed 
toward low socioeconomic countries may yield dividends in preventing subsequent 
disparities in the LC burden.
