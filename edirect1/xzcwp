significant BP change during the study.
CONCLUSION: In ESRD patients under long-term haemodialysis in whom BP was 
markedly elevated despite administration of many antihypertensive drugs, renal 
denervation lowered both ambulatory and office BP. The reduction persisted over 
a 1-year follow-up.

    Disease Burden of Adverse Childhood Experiences Across 14 States.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the adult health burden and costs in California during 
2013 associated with adults' prior Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).
METHODS: We analyzed five ACEs-linked conditions (asthma, arthritis, COPD, 
depression, and cardiovascular disease) and three health risk factors (lifetime 
smoking, heavy drinking, and obesity). We estimated ACEs-associated fractions of 
disease risk for people aged 18+ for these conditions by ACEs exposure using 
inputs from a companion study of California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System data for 2008-2009, 2011, and 2013. We combined these estimates with 
published estimates of personal healthcare spending and 
Disability-Adjusted-Life-Years (DALYs) in the United States by condition during 
2013. DALYs captured both the years of healthy life lost to disability and the 
years of life lost to deaths during 2013. We applied a published estimate of 
cost per DALY.
RESULTS: Among adults in California, 61% reported ACEs. Those ACEs were 
associated with $10.5 billion in excess personal healthcare spending during 
2013, and 434,000 DALYs valued at approximately $102 billion dollars. During 
2013, the estimated health burden per exposed adult included $589 in personal 
healthcare expenses and 0.0224 DALYs valued at $5,769.
CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of the costs of childhood adversity are far greater than 
previously understood and provide a fiscal rationale for prevention efforts.

Cardiac autonomic dysfunction (CAD) has been reported in patients with multiple 
sclerosis (MS). This systematic review summarizes the evidence for the types and 
prevalence of CAD in MS patients, as well as its association with MS type, 
disease characteristics, fatigue and immunotherapies used to treat MS. The 
analysis revealed that CAD is correlated with pathophysiological processes of 
MS, can trigger serious cardiovascular complications that may reduce life 
expectancy, and may have implications for treatment with immunotherapies, 
especially fingolimod. Numerous mainly small case-control or cohort studies have 
reported various measures of CAD (particularly heart rate variation) in MS 
patients, showing higher rates of abnormality versus controls. A smaller number 
of studies have reported on cardiac autonomic symptoms in MS, including 
orthostatic intolerance/dizziness in around 50% of patients. CAD also appears to 
be associated with disease duration and to be more common in progressive than 
relapsing-remitting MS. However, although a substantial evidence base suggests 
that assessing CAD in people with MS may be important, standardised methods to 
evaluate CAD in these patients have not yet been established. In addition, no 
studies have yet looked at whether treating CAD can reduce the burden of MS 
symptoms, disease activity or the rate of progression.

Each decade, the American Heart Association (AHA) develops an Impact Goal to 
guide its overall strategic direction and investments in its research, quality 
improvement, advocacy, and public health programs. Guided by the AHA's new 
Mission Statement, to be a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier 
lives, the 2030 Impact Goal is anchored in an understanding that to achieve 
cardiovascular health for all, the AHA must include a broader vision of health 
and well-being and emphasize health equity. In the next decade, by 2030, the AHA 
will strive to equitably increase healthy life expectancy beyond current 
projections, with global and local collaborators, from 66 years of age to at 
least 68 years of age across the United States and from 64 years of age to at 
least 67 years of age worldwide. The AHA commits to developing additional 
targets for equity and well-being to accompany this overarching Impact Goal. To 
attain the 2030 Impact Goal, we recommend a thoughtful evaluation of 
interventions available to the public, patients, providers, healthcare delivery 
systems, communities, policy makers, and legislators. This presidential advisory 
summarizes the task force's main considerations in determining the 2030 Impact 
Goal and the metrics to monitor progress. It describes the aspiration that these 
goals will be achieved by working with a diverse community of volunteers, 
patients, scientists, healthcare professionals, and partner organizations needed 
to ensure success.

Aim: To assess the cost-effectiveness of treatment sequences for patients with 
intermediate- to poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma. Patients & methods: A 
discrete event simulation model was developed to estimate patients' lifetime 
costs and survival. Efficacy inputs were derived from the CheckMate 214 and 
CheckMate 025 studies and network meta-analyses. Safety and cost data were 
obtained from the published literature. Results: The estimated average 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained was the highest on 
nivolumab + ipilimumab-initiated sequences (3.6-5.3 QALYs) versus tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (TKI)-initiated sequences (2.1-3.7 QALYs). Incremental cost per 
QALY gained for nivolumab + ipilimumab-initiated sequences was below the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 versus other sequences. Conclusion: 
Immuno-oncology combination therapy followed by TKIs is cost-effective versus 
TKI sequences followed by immuno-oncology or sequencing TKIs.

Iran will encounter rapid population aging, resulting from increased life 
expectancy and fluctuating fertility rates during its eight-year war with Iraq 
(1980-1988). The need for long-term care in Iran is expected to increase 
dramatically. The purpose of this paper is to examine Iran's health care system 
and informal care upon discussing its demographic profile. Scant attention of 
policymakers on the country's demographic transformation has resulted in limited 
resources for quality elder care as well as budget constraints for relevant 
research. In this demographic and political context, the costs of formal care, 
the shortage of health workforce and infrastructures (i.e., long-term care 
facilities), and the continuation of traditional cultural values are the most 
significant reasons for heavy reliance on informal elder care. In addition to 
inadequate systemic support, the prevalence of domestic violence, abuse, and 
infantalization are largely attributable to insufficient knowledge among 
informal elder carers.

BACKGROUND: Against the backdrop of rising statutory retirement age in Germany, 
we analyzed time trends in self-rated health (SRH) among the elderly population 
between 50 and 70 years of age and explored the mediating role of leisure time 
physical activity (LTPA) on the relationship between time period and self-rated 
health (SRH).
METHODS: We used longitudinal survey data (n = 23,161) from a national panel 
study (GSOEP) to analyze time trends in SRH and regular LTPA (at least once a 
week) by means of Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE) analysis for logistic 
regression. The Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) method was applied for decomposing 
trend effects into direct and indirect parts via LTPA. In addition to odds 
ratios (OR), we illustrated the results by means of predicted probabilities and 
average partial effects (APE).
RESULTS: Over time, the predicted probabilities of good SRH and regular LTPA 
increased while those of poor SRH decreased. After adjusting for socioeconomic 
status (SES) 53.4% of the trend in good SRH in women (OR = 1.34 / 
APE = 6.8%-points) could be attributed to the rise in regular LTPA. In men, the 
remaining smaller effect (OR = 1.13 / APE = 2.7%) could be fully assigned to 
temporal changes in regular LTPA. With respect to poor health we found a 
suppression effect of LTPA in the adjusted model, indicating that without 
improvements in regular LTPA over time an increase in poor SRH would have 
occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase of regular LTPA accounted for improved SRH from 1995 
to 2015 among the elderly, indicating that promoting LTPA might be a key factor 
to raise healthy working life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic neuropathic low back pain (CNLBP) is a debilitating 
condition in which established medical treatments seldom alleviate symptoms. 
Evidence demonstrates that high-frequency 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation (SCS) 
reduces pain and improves health-related quality of life in patients with failed 
back surgery syndrome (FBSS), but evidence of this effect is limited in 
individuals with CNLBP who have not had surgery. The aim of this multicentre 
randomised trial is to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of 10 kHz SCS 
for this population.
METHODS: This is a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial 
with a parallel economic evaluation. A total of 96 patients with CNLBP who have 
not had spinal surgery will be implanted with an epidural lead and a sham lead 
outside the epidural space without a screening trial. Patients will be 
randomised 1:1 to 10 kHz SCS plus usual care (intervention group) or to sham 
10 kHz SCS plus usual care (control group) after receiving the full implant. The 
SCS devices will be programmed identically using a cathodal cascade. 
Participants will use their handheld programmer to alter the intensity of the 
stimulation as per routine practice. The primary outcome will be a 7-day daily 
pain diary. Secondary outcomes include the Oswestry Disability Index, 
complications, EQ-5D-5 L, and health and social care costs. Outcomes will be 
assessed at baseline (pre-randomisation) and at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months 
after device activation. The primary analyses will compare primary and secondary 
outcomes between groups at 6 months, while adjusting for baseline outcome 
scores. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) will be 
calculated at 6 months and over the lifetime of the patient.
DISCUSSION: The outcomes of this trial will inform clinical practice and 
healthcare policy on the role of high-frequency 10 kHz SCS for use in patients 
with CNLBP who have not had surgery.

Management, Aalborg University, Aalborg Oest, Denmark lehlers@dcm.aau.dk.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of telehealthcare 
in heart failure patients as add-on to usual care.
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis was conducted from a public payer perspective 
alongside the randomised controlled TeleCare North trial.
SETTING: The North Denmark Region, Denmark.
PARTICIPANTS: The study included 274 heart failure patients with self-reported 
New York Heart Association class II-IV.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients in the intervention group were provided with a Telekit 
consisting of a tablet, a digital blood pressure monitor, and a scale and were 
instructed to perform measurements one to two times a week. The responsibility 
of the education, instructions and monitoring of the heart failure (HF) patients 
was placed on municipality nurses trained in HF and telemonitoring. Both groups 
received usual care.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness was reported as incremental net monetary 
benefit (NMB). A micro-costing approach was applied to evaluate the derived 
savings in the first year in the public health sector. Quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALY) gained were estimated using the EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-Levels 
questionnaire at baseline and at a 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Data for 274 patients were included in the main analysis. The 
telehealthcare solution provided a positive incremental NMB of £5164. The 1-year 
adjusted QALY difference between the telehealthcare solution and the usual care 
group was 0.0034 (95% CI: -0.0711 to 0.0780). The adjusted difference in costs 
was -£5096 (95% CI: -8736 to -1456) corresponding to a reduction in total 
healthcare costs by 35%. All sensitivity analyses showed the main results were 
robust.
CONCLUSIONS: The TeleCare North solution for monitoring HF was highly 
cost-effective. There were significant cost savings on hospitalisations, primary 
care contacts and total costs.

INTRODUCTION: Osteoarthritis knee is one of the most prevalent conditions of 
knee in elder age group of population. Its causes pain, disability in geriatric 
population of society. Longer life expectancy is responsible for increase in 
osteoarthritis knee. K-L scale is well known scale of radiographic OA knee. This 
study was done to find prevalence of OA knee in Indian population of older than 
40 years using K-L scale.
METHOD: The study was a community based cross sectional study. The target 
population was from 5 metropolis, 5 cities near the metropolis, 5 towns and 20 
villages from blocks of these towns. i.e. 5 sample groups were covered. Sample 
size n = 4680 which was further divided into 5 sites equally (936 from each 
site). This was rounded to a sample of 1000 from each site. This evaluation 
study was conducted using the household as the primary sampling unit for the 
quantitative survey. The respondents for the study were above 40 years. 
Quantitative data was collected using structured questionnaire and X-Ray 
Investigation. OA was graded using the Kellgren and Lawrence scale. Data 
analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software. Frequencies and 
percentages were calculated to find the prevalence of OA. Chi-Square test was 
used to find the association of OA with various factors.
RESULTS: The present study shows a prevalence of 28.7% of OA in the overall 
sample. This varies slightly in the individual states - Agra (35.5%), Bangalore 
(26.6%), Kolkata (33.7%), Dehradun (27.2%), and Pune (21.7%).OA prevalence was 
found to be more in participants who used western toilet (42.1%), in sedentary 
people (82.9%), in females and in obese.
CONCLUSION: This study has evidenced that there is a large percentage of 
sub-threshold population. i.e. K-L grade 1 which is considered as border-line or 
doubt-full as far as OA diagnosis. Awareness of OA should be initiated at 
community level, which is needed for prevention of OA at early age.

INTRODUCTION: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in 
adults and is usually located in long bones. Standard treatment consists of 
perioperative chemotherapy and radical surgical resection. In the case of the 
extremity location, the gold standard is limb-sparing surgery (LSS) using a 
variety of reconstructive techniques.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess long-term results of adults patients treated for 
limb osteosarcoma in our referral center depending on the method of surgical 
treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In our study, we analyzed 175 adult patients with 
localized disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage I-III) 
treated for extremity osteosarcoma at our institution between 2000 and 2017. The 
median observation time was 41 months (3-225 months). 111 patients were treated 
with LSS (80 patients had tumor resection followed by endoprosthetic 
reconstruction, 31 patients had local resection without reconstruction) and 64 
patients underwent amputation.
RESULTS: 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in the 
study group were 62% and 52% and the life expectancy was on average 136 months. 
In the group of patients treated with LSS, 5-year OS and PFS were 66% and 59%, 
respectively, and life expectancy was 147 months, while in the group of patients 
undergoing amputation 5-year OS, PFS and life expectancy were 55%, 42% and 117 
months.
CONCLUSIONS: The best results in the treatment of extremity osteosarcoma were 
achieved in a group of patients without distant metastases at the time of 
diagnosis, treated with perioperative chemotherapy and radical resection 
followed by endoprosthetic reconstruction.

This study was focused on shelf-life extension of whole shrimp (Penaeus 
merguiensis) using an active coating containing gelatin hydrolysates. Gelatin 
extracted from Scomberomorus commerson skin was hydrolyzed using actinidin 
extracted from kiwifruit. Some important physicochemical characteristics of fish 
skin gelatin including viscosity, gelling and melting points, and temperatures 
were examined. The whole shrimp was coated with four coating agents including 
fish skin gelatin (FG), commercial gelatin (CG), fish skin gelatin containing 
1 mg/ml fish gelatin hydrolysates (FG + GH), and commercial bovine gelatin 
containing 1 mg/ml fish gelatin hydrolysates (CG + GH). Chemical, microbial, and 
sensorial properties of samples were monitored for 12 days at 4°C with 3-day 
intervals (0-12 days). The pH value of samples coated with FG + GH and CG + GH 
showed the lowest changes during 12 days of storage (1.68 ± 0.00 and 
1.70 ± 0.09, respectively). The free fatty acid content (FFA), total volatile 
base nitrogen (TVB-N), lipid oxidation, and carbonyl content of samples coated 
with FG + GH and CG + GH were significantly lower than that of control, CG, and 
FG samples. The results of this study showed that the gelatin hydrolysates could 
be used as a preservative costing agent for whole shrimp.

Most children are surviving acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) today. Yet, the 
emergence of cardiometabolic comorbidities in this population may impact 
long-term outcomes including the quality of life and lifespan. Obesity is a 
major driver of cardiometabolic disorders in the general population, and in ALL 
patients it is associated with increased risk of hypertension, dysglycemia, and 
febrile neutropenia when compared with lean ALL patients undergoing therapy. 
This systematic review aims to assess the current evidence for bariatric 
interventions to manage obesity in children with ALL. The primary outcome for 
this systematic review was the change in BMI z-score with implementation of the 
interventions studied. Literature searches were conducted in several databases. 
Ten publications addressing the study question were included in this review, and 
five studies were used in the meta-analysis to assess the impact of the 
bariatric interventions on obesity. The BMI z-score did not change significantly 
with the interventions. However, the quality of evidence was low, which 
precluded the recommendation of their use. In conclusion, prospective, rigorous, 
adequately powered, and high-quality longitudinal studies are urgently needed to 
deliver effective lifestyle interventions to children with ALL to treat and 
prevent obesity. These interventions, if successful, may improves 
cardiometabolic health outcomes and enhance the quality of life and life 
expectancy in children with ALL.

OBJECT: The primary treatment option for symptomatic metastatic spinal tumors is 
surgery. Prognostic systems are designed to assist in the establishment of the 
indication and the choice of surgical methodology. The best-known prognostic 
system is the revised Tokuhashi system, which has a predictive ability of about 
60%. In our study, we are attempting to find the reason for its poor predictive 
ability, despite its proper separation ability.
METHODS: We have designed a one-center-based retrospective clinical trial, by 
which we would like to test the feasibility and the inaccuracy of the revised 
Tokuhashi system. In our database, there are 329 patients who underwent surgery. 
Statistical analysis was performed.
RESULTS: A significant increase in survival time was observed in the 
'conservative' category. Earlier studies reported OS 0.15 at the 180-day control 
time, in contrast with our 0.38 OS value. The literature suggested supportive 
care for this category, but in our population, every patient underwent surgery. 
Our population passes the 0.15 OS value on day 475. We propose an adjustment of 
the Tokuhashi category scores. We observed significant success in resolving 
pain. Motor functions were improved or stabilized compared to changes in 
vegetative dysfunction.
CONCLUSION: According to our results, the Tokuhashi scoring system makes very 
conservative predictions and prefers non-surgical palliative or supportive care. 
Surgical treatment increases the life expectancy of patients in poor condition. 
We propose modifying the therapeutic options of the revised Tokuhashi system, 
taking into consideration modern spine surgery techniques.

PURPOSE: In East Asian patients, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is 
characterized primarily by β-cell dysfunction, with lower insulin secretion than 
in Caucasian individuals. Therefore, bolus insulin and premixed insulin 
containing a bolus insulin component are important therapeutic tools in Japan, 
in addition to basal insulin. This subgroup analysis is stratified by insulin 
regimen and uses data from a phase 4, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind and subsequent open-label study in Japan to assess the efficacy and 
safety of once-weekly dulaglutide combined with various insulin therapies.
METHODS: This multicenter study enrolled Japanese patients with T2DM and 
inadequate glycemic control [glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 7.5% to ≤ 10.5%] 
on insulin therapy [basal (B), premixed (PM), or basal bolus (BB)] in 
combination with or without one or two oral antidiabetic agents. Randomized 
participants received once-weekly dulaglutide 0.75 mg (n = 120) or placebo 
(n = 39) during a 16-week double-blind treatment period, and dulaglutide during 
a 36-week open-label extension. In this subgroup analysis, efficacy measures 
were changes from baseline in HbA1c, 7-point self-monitored blood glucose 
profiles, and body weight. Safety measures were incidence of adverse events and 
hypoglycemia during the first 16 weeks.
RESULTS: At week 16, least squares mean differences (95% CI) regarding changes 
from baseline in HbA1c for each insulin regimen versus placebo were: B: - 1.62% 
(- 1.96, - 1.28), PM: - 1.78% (- 2.25, - 1.30), and BB: - 1.15% (- 1.54, 
- 0.77); p < 0.001 dulaglutide vs. placebo for each subgroup. No significant 
differences in body weight changes were observed between dulaglutide and placebo 
for any insulin regimen. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most commonly 
observed adverse events in dulaglutide-treated patients. Hypoglycemia incidence 
rates were: B: dulaglutide 38.5% vs. placebo 23.5%; PM: dulaglutide 38.5% vs. 
placebo 44.4%; BB: dulaglutide 50.0% vs. placebo 30.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, dulaglutide was generally well tolerated and improved 
glycemic control significantly versus placebo, regardless of insulin regimen.

PURPOSE: The proportion of cured gastric cancer patients has drawn the attention 
of patients, physicians, and healthcare providers after comprehensive prevention 
and control measures were carried out for several years. Therefore, the relative 
survival and cure fraction were estimated in our study.
METHODS: Population-based cancer registration data were used to estimate 
survival and cure fraction. A total of 7585 gastric cancer cases 
(ICD10:C16.0 ~ C16.9) were extracted and included in the final analysis. Cases 
were diagnosed in 2003-2012 and followed until the end of 2017. Relative 
survival was calculated as the ratio between the observed survival through the 
life-table method. The expected survival was estimated by the Ederer II method. 
The cure fraction was estimated using flexible parametric cure models stratified 
by age and calendar period when the cases were diagnosed.
RESULTS: The 5-year relative survival of cardia gastric cancer increased with 
the calendar period of 2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012 
(27.5%, 28.3%, 33.5%, 38.2%, and 46.8%, respectively). The increasing trend 
along with the calendar periods was also observed in cure proportion of cardia 
gastric cancer (24.8%, 25.2%, 31.7%, 36.0%, and 43.1%, respectively). Notable 
improvement of cure proportion was observed in the period of 2011-2012, compared 
with the initial period of 2003-2004. There was an improvement of 79.8% among 
all gastric cancer subjects, and it was 74.1% and 55.7% in cardia gastric and 
noncardia gastric cancer subjects, respectively. The median survival of 
"uncured" patients showed no significant improvement along with the calendar 
periods in all age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Notable improvement of gastric cancer relative survival and cure 
proportion was observed in Linzhou during 2003-2012.

Infantile Hemangiopericytoma (HPC)/Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT), a vascular 
tumor of head and neck region, can be congenital or arise during the first year 
of the life. As the infantile form of hemangiopericytoma has a better course 
than the adult form, surgical excision is recommended. Case Report: A full-term 
neonate presented with a congenital right temporal soft tissue mass. MRI 
revealed a highly vascular mass with a hemorrhagic and possible necrotic core 
without intracranial extension. The lesion grew in 2 weeks from 4x4 cm to 
9x7 cm. Histologically, a hypercellular spindle cell mesenchymal neoplasm had 
prominent staghorn vessels, alternating with hypocellular areas. Mitotic 
activity was low(1-3/HPF) and necrosis was absent. Conclusion: Infantile HPC/SFT 
of head and neck can grow rapidly during the infantile period. Complete excision 
without mutilating surgery should be curative.

OBJECTIVES: To identify levels and trends in life expectancy at age 65 (e65) by 
geographic region and metropolitan status in the United States.
METHODS: Using county-level data on population and deaths from the Census and 
National Center for Health Statistics, we consider spatial inequality in e65 
across 4 metropolitan types and 10 geographic regions from 2000 to 2016. We 
examine whether changes in e65 are driven by mortality developments in metro 
types or geographic regions, and compare spatial patterns in the United States 
to mortality trends in other Organization of Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) countries. We use decomposition and regression methods to 
estimate the contributions of 10 causes of death to changes and inequalities in 
e65.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at age 65 increased in all spatial units from 2000 to 
2016. Areas with higher e65 in 2000 also experienced larger gains. Longevity 
increases were greatest in large metropolitan areas and coastal regions. 
Nonmetropolitan areas and the interior lagged far behind not only other parts of 
the United States but all OECD comparison countries. Metropolitan status was a 
better predictor of mortality changes than geographic region. Circulatory 
diseases and diseases associated with smoking were the principal sources of life 
expectancy gains and spatial differentiation in those gains. Larger gains in 
smoking-related mortality accounted for greater improvements among men than 
women.
DISCUSSION: Even at advanced ages, large geographic disparities in life 
expectancy remain. And as mortality has declined, these disparities have 
widened. Public health efforts should pay special attention to identifying and 
ameliorating the sources of lagging life expectancy in nonmetropolitan regions.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate prognostic factors for physical and emotional 
functioning following interdisciplinary multimodal pain rehabilitation, by 
targeting patients' baseline characteristics and health measures.
METHODS: A prospective cohort of 2,876 patients from 38 specialist clinics 
across Sweden, who were completing interdisciplinary multimodal pain 
rehabilitation programmes, was followed through the Swedish Quality Registry for 
Pain Rehabilitation, from initial assessment to 12-month follow-up. Using 
logistic regression, baseline data were regressed to predict improvement in 
Physical functioning and Emotional functioning, fused by principal component 
analyses using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
RESULTS: Employment status emerged as having the largest effect sizes in both 
Physical functioning and Emotional functioning; Working: odds ratio (OR) 2.05 
(95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.64-2.56) and OR 1.59 (95% CI 1.27-1.98), 
respectively. Strong beliefs in restored health, better initial emotional 
health, lower levels of pain and pain interference, and younger age all 
predicted Physical functioning. European origin, higher levels of general 
activity, and sense of life control all predicted Emotional functioning. Worse 
initial physical and emotional health predicted the corresponding dependent 
outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Employment was consistently found to be an important prognostic 
factor, suggesting the significance of avoiding delay in interdisciplinary 
multimodal pain rehabilitation. A positive treatment expectancy was of 
importance. In general, multidimensional measures indicated that better initial 
status was more favourable; however, inconsistency implies a complex prognostic 
picture.

Rationale: Smoking results in at least a decade lower life expectancy. Mortality 
among current smokers is two to three times as high as never smokers. DNA 
methylation is an epigenetic modification of the human genome that has been 
associated with both cigarette smoking and mortality.Objectives: We sought to 
identify DNA methylation marks in blood that are predictive of mortality in a 
subset of the COPDGene (Genetic Epidemiology of COPD) study, representing 101 
deaths among 667 current and former smokers.Methods: We assayed genome-wide DNA 
methylation in non-Hispanic white smokers with and without chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) using blood samples from the COPDGene enrollment visit. 
We tested whether DNA methylation was associated with mortality in models 
adjusted for COPD status, age, sex, current smoking status, and pack-years of 
cigarette smoking. Replication was performed in a subset of 231 individuals from 
the ECLIPSE (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate 
Endpoints) study.Measurements and Main Results: We identified seven CpG sites 
associated with mortality (false discovery rate < 20%) that replicated in the 
ECLIPSE cohort (P < 0.05). None of these marks were associated with longitudinal 
lung function decline in survivors, smoking history, or current smoking status. 
However, differential methylation of two replicated PIK3CD 
(phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta) sites 
were associated with lung function at enrollment (P < 0.05). We also observed 
associations between DNA methylation and gene expression for the PIK3CD 
sites.Conclusions: This study is the first to identify variable DNA methylation 
associated with all-cause mortality in smokers with and without COPD. Evaluating 
predictive epigenomic marks of smokers in peripheral blood may allow for 
targeted risk stratification and aid in delivery of future tailored therapeutic 
interventions.

    J Am Coll Health. 2022 Apr;70(3):677-678.

OBJECTIVE(S): To determine whether there is an association between the 
consumption of nonnutritive sweeteners (NNS) and sex, as well as age. Also, to 
determine awareness of the health risks associated with the use of NNS.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered 
questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to compile the data collected. 
Data were presented using frequencies and percentages. A chi-squared tests were 
performed to test the association between NNS and gender/sex and age. The level 
of significance was set at the ≤ 0.05.
RESULTS: The majority of students [n = 108 (55.1%)] indicated that they have 
never used NNS. The NNS with the highest intake was sucralose. There were no 
significant associations between gender (p-value = 0.508) and age (p-value = 
0.275) and use of NNS. For awareness of the association between NNS, weight 
gain, and cancer, 38.8% (n = 76) of the participants indicated that they were 
not aware that NNS are associated with weight gain. Less than half of the 
participants (n = 46, 23.5%) were not aware that NNS does cause cancer.
CONCLUSION: A large portion of university students do not use NNS. The majority 
of students were aware that NNS are associated with weight gain but did not link 
it to cancer development.
