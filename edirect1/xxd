tables for a three-dimensional state space, using data on community-dwelling 
older adults from the 1989 and 1994 National Long Term Care Survey analytic 
files. Empirical confidence intervals for ALE are compared across 6 models using 
successively higher ADL cutoffs for defining individuals as being disabled.
RESULTS: After considering sampling and other errors in the estimation of 
transition probabilities, the authors found that altering the threshold for 
measuring disability has relatively little effect on ALE estimates, especially 
with higher ADL-level thresholds and at older ages.
DISCUSSION: The implications of the results include that disability measurement, 
including altering the definition of being disabled and possibly expanding the 
state space of a model, may not affect population-based estimates of ALE.

Life expectancy with cognitive impairment in the older population of the United 
States.

California 90089-0191, USA.

OBJECTIVES: This article provides estimates of the prevalence of cognitive 
impairment by age and sex for a nationally representative sample of the U.S. 
population aged 70 and over. From these estimates, years of life with and 
without cognitive impairment are calculated.
METHODS: Using data from the Assets and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old 
(AHEAD) survey, the prevalence of cognitive impairment is estimated for a sample 
representing both the community-dwelling and institutionalized older American 
population. Sullivan's method is used to calculate the average number of years 
an elderly person can expect to live with and without cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to severe cognitive impairment in the total 
U.S. population aged 70 and over is 9.5%. At age 70, the average American can 
expect 1.5 years with cognitive impairment. Expected length of life with 
cognitive impairment is longer for women than men because of their longer life 
expectancy.
DISCUSSION: As total life expectancy continues to increase, the length of life 
with cognitive impairment for the American population will increase unless 
age-specific prevalence is reduced. There is great potential for improvement in 
future early treatment and diagnosis of this condition.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hip protectors 
in the prevention of hip fracture in an elderly population living in 
institutions.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Meta-analysis followed by economic analysis.
METHODS: The meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials was based on 
the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. Model-based economic analysis 
was conducted using estimates of transition probabilities, costs, and utilities 
relevant to Canada.
RESULTS: The results indicate that hip protectors compared with control results 
in a relative risk of hip fracture of 0.40 (95% Confidence Interval 0.23-0.70). 
The economic analysis found that the use of hip protectors is expected to be 
both effective and cost saving. Results were robust to a range of analysis 
exploring the uncertainty of input parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: There is sufficient clinical and economic evidence to support the 
use of hip protectors for institutional dwelling elderly.

The diagnosis of the malignancies of the stomach is generally late (stages III 
and IV to a medium value of 80% of patients). Therefore it is necessary a 
surgical treatment in order to effectuate the extirpation of the lesions and to 
warn or to treat the complications in course of the neoplastic disease. The 
indications and the results of the palliative total gastrectomy (PTG) are 
analyzed in the present study. Between 1992 and 1999 there were studied 
retrospectively and prospectively during three successive periods of time, 217 
patients (pts.) with PTG. This group of pts. represents 22.1% of the total 
number of pts. operated on for gastric malignancies (carcinoma particularly). 
The indication of PTG was established only after one complex evaluation of the 
every patient from the point of view of his general and biological status. 142 
(65.4%/217) of the analyzed pts. presented at the admission in the hospital 
various complications of the malignant disease (gastric different stenosis, 
digestive hemorrhages, loco-regional invasion). The lymph nodes metastases and 
the systemic metastases (in the liver especially) as well as the invasion in the 
neighbouring viscera imposed sometimes the extension of the PTG with partial or 
total extirpation of the invaded organs. A proportion of 61% pts. were submitted 
to those type of enlarged surgical interventions without radical intentions; all 
the operated pts. remained by necessity in R1 or R2 types of operations. The 
reconstructive preferred anastomosis was effectuated with an Y jejunal ansa à la 
Roux completed or not by a "J" reservoir. Microscopically pathologic lesions 
were: adenocarcinoma and carcinoma (82%), followed by primitive lymphoma 
(11.5%), and others malignant forms of lesions (approximately 6%). The general 
perioperative morbidity was 32.5% divided in: 12.3% having a surgical cause (the 
majority anastomotic leakages +/- septically complications or precocious 
occlusions); 20.2% complications depending by the general status and altered 
biology of the patients. Perioperative mortality was 10.1% (22 pts.) comparable 
with other experiences published in the international literature in those forms 
of advanced gastric cancer operated by PTG. The average outcome of the operated 
followed pts. was 16-18 month (extremes 12 months and 29 months). A better 
quality of life and a variable disease-free period was obtained. As a conclusion 
we think that the PTG is a advantageous modality of surgical treatment with an 
acceptable rate of perioperative morbidity and mortality. The outcome of 
operated pts. is superior comparable with that of nonoperated pts. or with that 
secondary to other palliative surgical interventions. The importance of adjuvant 
treatment (chimeo- or radiotherapy) remain to be appreciated in the future.

Multivisceral trauma and exanguinating hemorrhage lead to hypothermia, 
coagulopathy and acidosis. Formal resections and reconstructions in these 
unstable patient is often result in irreversible physiologic insult. For the 
patients with life-threatening injuries the staged control and repair of 
injuries may be a saving surgical strategy. The initial phase of "damage 
control" involves an abbreviated laparotomy, which entails temporary hemorrhage 
control, perfusion of vital organs and avoidance of enteric or urinary spillage. 
The surgical procedure is rapidly terminated, with emphasis on a temporary 
physiologic equilibrium rather than anatomic integrity. That is, the damage 
control surgery represents an extension of resuscitation phase of trauma in the 
operating room. The second therapeutic phase involves standard resuscitation and 
control of hypothermia, coagulopathy and acidosis, combined with surveillance 
and management of the abdominal compartment syndrome. The last phase involves 
the definitive repair of all temporized injuries, homeostasis, vascular 
reconstruction and abdominal wall repair.

The extension of the resection for thyroid nodules depends both on nodules' 
nature and immediate or late postoperative complications risks. This clinical 
study analyzed the immediate complications appeared after partial thyroidectomy 
comparatively with those developed after total thyroidectomy. We studied 1411 
patients operated in two clinics (from Romania and from France) which have two 
different attitudes concerning the width of the resection. Paralysis of 
recurrent laryngeal nerve occurred in 1.0% of patients with partial 
thyroidectomy and 3.0% of patients with total thyroidectomy, while only one 
patient (0.6%) developed permanent hypoparathyroidism after total thyroidectomy. 
In conclusion, total thyroidectomy can be performed by experimented surgeons 
with a recurrent or parathyroid injury risk similar to partial thyroidectomy. 
However, the surgeon should take into account the patient survey capacity and 
the discomfort produced by life substitutive treatment.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Non-transitional cell tumours of the bladder are 
both a diagnostic challenge for the pathologist and a therapeutic challenge for 
the urologist, because although uncommon (less than 5% of all malignancies of 
the bladder) they show different biological behaviours each requiring a unique 
approach. The most significant pathoanatomical types are: primary epidermoid 
carcinoma, primary adenocarcinoma and primary sarcoma. This paper presents an 
analysis of our experience in these types of tumours.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study of unusual cases of cancer of the 
bladder seen in our hospital between 1988-2001. Their biological behaviour and 
the therapies applied are analysed. The extravesical origin of the tumour was 
ruled out in all cases.
RESULTS: We found 21 cases of the following pathoanatomical varieties: 13 
epidermoid carcinomas, 7 adenocarcinomas (3 urachal) and 1 sarcoma. Mean age was 
very different between epidermoid carcinomas (69.2 +/- 9.1 years) and 
adenocarcinomas (50.3 +/- 8.1). Tumour behaviour was very aggressive in all 
three histological varieties. At the time of diagnosis 19 patients had locally 
advanced stages (> or = T2). Although elective therapy was cystectomy, this was 
only feasible in 10 cases. Systemic chemotherapy (most frequently M-VAC) and/or 
local radiotherapy was used in 7 cases. 14 patients have died after a mean 
survival of 15.7 +/- 11.6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Late diagnosis of these tumours and their aggressive biological 
behaviour involve a gloomy prognosis. Only early diagnosis and radical therapy 
could improve the prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: To establish prognostic factors of recurrence and progression in 
stage T1 transitional cell bladder carcinoma, paying special attention to 
prognostic value of p53 and ki67.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 175 patients with incident bladder tumour at T1 category. 
The immunohistochemical study was performed using the monoclonal antibodies 
DO-7, for p53 and MIB-1, for ki67. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used, and a 
multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazards model was carried out in 
order to determine the variables associated with recurrence and progression. ROC 
curves were also drawn up.
RESULTS: The average follow up period was 8.55 years. 5 and 12-year 
recurrence-free survival rates were 57.98% and 48.47%. The independent variables 
for recurrence were histological grade, tumour multifocality, tumour size > 3 
cm, presence of carcinoma in situ and ki67 expression. 5 and 12-year 
progression-free survival rates were 83.12% and 75.63%. The independent 
variables for progression were age, tumour multifocality, solid microscopic 
morphology, p53 expression and ki67 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Solid microscopic pattern and p53 expression are the variables 
which best predict progression. A positive relationship was observed between p53 
and progression: the greater the expression of p53, the greater the progression. 
Tumour multifocality and ki67 expression > 27% are the main prognostic factors 
for recurrence.

OBJECTIVES: Bleeding secondary to severe vesicoprostatic pathology (mainly 
neoplasic disease and radiation cystitis) may be a serious clinical management 
problem due to its morbidity and associated increased resources demand in the 
form of admissions, transfusions and other measures. We review a series of 
patients embolized for this purpose, its efficacy, tolerability and adverse 
events.
METHODS: We review 8 patients who underwent hypogastric arteries embolization 
between July 1998 and December 2001, analyzing indications, efficacy and 
duration, tolerability, and consequences. Right femoral artery access was 
undertaken in all except one case that needed bilateral femoral accesses. 
Embolization was achieved by means of coils and particles. All procedures were 
performed under local anaesthesia.
RESULTS: 9 procedures were performed in 8 patients. 3 patients presented with 
hematuria due to radiation cystitis, 3 from prostatic carcinoma, and 2 with 
urethrorragy from urethral relapses after cystectomy. 7/9 embolizations were 
effective achieving immediate complete or almost complete bleeding control; in 
one case control was partial; another one had limited or no effect. Selective 
embolization of distal arteries was performed in 3 cases; all the remainders 
underwent direct hypogastric trunk embolization sparing the superior gluteal 
artery. Effect lasted between 1 and 31 months. 4 patients died, 3 of them 
without haematuria, 1 because of an intercurrent disease, and the others from 
disease progression. 2 patients underwent posterior surgery, one due to 
recurrent haematuria, and the other, a case of urethral tumour, due to partial 
failure; partial cystectomy and urethrectomy were performed respectively. 2 
patients needed administration of morphic derivatives after embolization, all 
the others were managed with magnesium metamizol. Only one patient referred mild 
transitory gluteal claudication.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous arterial embolization is an effective instrument to 
treat patients with haematuria or urethrorragy and severe lower urinary tract 
pathology in whom curative treatments are not applicable due to their general 
status, life expectancy, or tumor status.

(1)Department of Urology, University of Verona, Italy.

OBJECTIVE: To report a case of small cell carcinoma of the bladder. To analyse 
Literature data concerning disease stage, treatment and prognosis of small cell 
carcinoma of the bladder.
METHODS/RESULTS: We report a case of small cell carcinoma of the bladder with 
hepatic and skeletal metastases who underwent radical cystectomy and systemic 
chemotherapy. The patient died 9 months after surgery because of chemotherapy 
complications and in disease progression. The Authors reviewed and analysed 
Literature data concerning 139 cases of bladder small cell carcinoma with 
available follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The extreme variability of treatment options, the small number of 
cases and stratification by stages make it very difficult to deduce therapeutic 
recommendations. The management that seems to give a better survival is the 
combination of radical cystectomy (or radiotherapy) and chemotherapy.

Public transit agencies have begun to adopt alternative propulsion technologies 
to reduce urban transit bus emissions associated with conventional diesel (CD) 
engines. Among the most popular alternatives are emission controlled diesel 
buses (ECD), defined here to be buses with continuously regenerating diesel 
particle filters burning low-sulfur diesel fuel, and buses burning compressed 
natural gas (CNG). This study uses a series of simplifying assumptions to arrive 
at first-order estimates for the incremental cost-effectiveness (CE) of ECD and 
CNG relative to CD. The CE ratio numerator reflects acquisition and operating 
costs. The denominator reflects health losses (mortality and morbidity) due to 
primary particulate matter (PM), secondary PM, and ozone exposure, measured as 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs). We find that CNG provides larger health 
benefits than does ECD (nine vs six QALYs annually per 1000 buses) but that ECD 
is more cost-effective than CNG (dollar 270 000 per QALY for ECD vs dollar 1.7 
million to dollar 2.4 million for CNG). These estimates are subject to much 
uncertainty. We identify assumptions that contribute most to this uncertainty 
and propose potential research directions to refine our estimates.

OBJECTIVES: To study the putative role of methadone maintenance treatment in the 
improvement of life expectancy of opioid addicts.
DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal study.
PARTICIPANTS: All 1487 patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment in 
Alicante between June 1990 and December 1997.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Mortality rates were studied using Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves. Protection or risk factors were analyzed using Cox's proportional 
hazards model.
RESULTS: Mortality rates decreased from 87/1000 in 1991 to 17/1000 in 1997. The 
following factors influenced mortality: HIV infection [Hazard Ratio (HR)=7, 95% 
confidence interval (CI)=4-12]; current methadone status (HR=3.2, 95%CI=1.5-7.1) 
and MMT retention (retained vs. drop-out, HR=0.5, 95%CI=0.2-1.1; re-enrolled vs. 
drop-out, HR=0.3, 95%CI=0.2-0.5).
CONCLUSION: Expediting entry and re-enrolling in methadone maintenance treatment 
improves survival.

South Florida, Cancer Control, MRC, 12902 Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL 33612-9497,

This paper tests whether the measured cost-effectiveness of treating different 
subgroups of an incident population of lung cancer patients differs 
significantly and, by implication, whether the provision of care to these 
patients is tolerably efficient in economic terms. Data from administrative 
records and Registry follow-up on 544 non-small cell lung cancer patients 
diagnosed at a single NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center are used to 
conduct the empirical analysis. The main results show statistically significant 
differences in cumulative costs and patient outcomes across subgroups differing 
by disease stage and treatment modality. These findings imply that the delivery 
of lung cancer care is inefficient. Substantive and methodological implications 
are discussed.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the gender differential in life expectancy in Italy from 
1970 to 1997, to determine which ages and causes of death mostly influenced its 
trend.
METHODS: Pollard method was used to explain which ages and which pathologies 
give the highest contribution to the gender differential.
RESULTS: A slight reduction of the gender differential has been observed since 
1980. The olds and very olds became the most relevant contributors to the 
differential. Cardiovascular diseases were the principal contributing causes of 
death until 1980 and Cancer replaced them afterwards.
CONCLUSION: Relatively recent adoption of unhealthy life styles by women 
together with an opposite process run by young men towards healthier behaviour, 
seem to be at the basis of the slight reduction of the gender differential in 
life expectancy observed since 1980.

By indirect estimation of mortality from smoking and life table methods we 
estimated expected lifetime without musculoskeletal diseases among never 
smokers, ex-smokers, and smokers. We found that although life expectancy of a 
heavy smoker is 7 years shorter than that of a never smoker, heavy smokers can 
expect to live more than 2 years longer with musculoskeletal diseases than never 
smokers.

Dietary docosahexaenoic acid levels influence the outcome of arabinosylcytosine 
chemotherapy in L1210 leukemic mice.

Cha MC(1), Meckling KA, Stewart C.

(1)Department of Human Biology and Nutrition Sciences, University of Guelph, 
Guelph, ON, Canada N1G 2W1.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether dietary supplementation 
with the n-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in combination with 
arabinosylcytosine (AraC) chemotherapy could prolong the life expectancy of mice 
bearing L1210 leukemia. The four control diets included rodent chow, a diet 
containing 5% of a blended oil mimicking the fatty acid composition of rodent 
chow, and diets containing 5% or 10% fat with safflower oil as the main oil 
source. The two DHA-supplemented diets provided 1.5% or 3.5% DHA and 5% or 10% 
total fat, respectively. After tumor cell inoculation, mice were treated with 
AraC for 10 days. Mice fed the 5% safflower oil diet (30.1 -/+ 4.1 days), but 
not those fed the 10% safflower oil diet, survived longer than the chow-fed 
animals (22.1 -/+ 3.1 days, P = 0.05). The 1.5%-/+ DHA diet (average intake 1.8 
g DHA/kg/day) was associated with a longer life span (33.3 -/+ 3.4 days, P < 
0.01 vs. chow-fed) and no incidence of death due to drug toxicity. Further 
increasing DHA intake (4.5 g DHA/kg/day) resulted in shortened survival time 
(26.5 -/+ 2.0 days), increased circulating tumor cell burden, and lowered red 
blood cell concentrations. These data suggest that a modest level of dietary DHA 
or linoleic acid supplementation may improve the antineoplastic efficacy of 
AraC. However, overconsumption of DHA reverses the beneficial effect of DHA 
intake on drug sensitivity.

The recent development and clinical use of three different types of highly 
effective anti-HIV-1 drugs, including nucleotide and non-nucleotide reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-peptidic viral protease inhibitors 
(PIs) and their combinations, termed highly active antiretroviral therapy 
(HAART), have dramatically reduced the infection-related mortality of AIDS 
patients in developed countries. However, the prolongation of the life 
expectancy of HIV-1-infected patients and/or long-term use of the above 
antiviral agents have generated a score of new problems and complications. Among 
them is the relatively common AIDS-related lipodystrophy/insulin resistance 
syndrome, which is associated with severe metabolic disturbances such as 
carbohydrate intolerance/diabetes mellitus and severe dyslipidemia, which 
influence the quality of life and threaten the life expectancies of 
HIV-1-infected patients by increasing the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease. The etiology of this syndrome appears to be multi-factorial; the 
classes of anti-viral drugs listed above, hypercytokinemia in AIDS patients, and 
the HIV-1 infection itself could induce the pathologic changes of this syndrome 
or increase the vulnerability of patients to the adverse effect of the 
therapeutic compounds. In this article, we review our current understanding of 
the pathogenesis of this severe AIDS-associated metabolic disorder.

Medicine, 111 East 210th Street, Bronx, NY 10467, USA. zeleznikjo@aol.com

An absolute quantified normal rate of change and normal range of functions of 
the respiratory system applicable to all older adults as they age is elusive. 
Like life expectancy, which is dependent on a cohort effect, the norms of 
respiratory system function are related to the birth cohort to which a given 
individual belongs and the age at which the parameter is assessed. No single 
rate of change can express normal across all age ranges even for those 
individuals in apparently good health [29]. Analogous to defining risk factors 
for a disease, determining that a change in anatomy or physiology is not disease 
requires stringent prospective evaluation for the absence of occult disease and 
known risk factors for disease prior to concluding that the alteration is 
inevitable with the normal aging process [19,31]. Additional limitations in 
quantifying the norms of respiratory function with age are the lack of 
participation of the oldest adults in studies and the lack of precision and 
accuracy in these performance-based measurements. The data, although limited, do 
support a qualitative emphysematous change in lung histology and lung-thorax 
mechanics. This change plus altered lung volumes influence oxygenation and 
oxygen consumption. There is no evidence that the changes in the respiratory 
system with aging impact day-to-day function of older adults, but they may 
become evident under circumstances when physiologic demand reaches the limits of 
supply. Despite changes in cholinergic and adrenergic receptor functioning, 
there is no evidence to suggest altering prescribing these classes of 
medications for older people. Pioneer physiologists asked the original question 
"Is there a difference in this measurement for older people?" Researchers in 
pulmonary medicine, pathology, radiology, epidemiology, and public health have 
continued to revise the question toward the clinical implications while studying 
the aging process from their respective viewpoints. Clinicians who need to 
develop an integrated care plan should neither rely on formulas to "normalize" a 
measurement for age nor assume that a established predictive value of a 
diagnostic test done in young adults can be automatically applied to geriatric 
patients [4]. Rather, the clinical situation should consider that the 
variability in normal is greater with older age and that all diagnostic tests 
and care plans should be considered in the context of the patient's symptoms 
[5].

[Expression of p27 and proliferative (MIB-1), mitotic (MI) and apoptotic indices 
in early-phase (EGF) gastric carcinoma. Results of a study by the Italian

AIMS: Since the Japanese Society for Gastroenterology and Endoscopy (JSGE) 
introduced the definition of Early Gastric Cancer (EGC), much more and deeper 
studies were done, which demonstrated that EGC was a more complex phase of the 
neoplastic disease with different morphologic characteristics, tightly linked to 
the prognosis. We evaluated the clinical impact of some prognostic factors, 
known being important in the advanced lesions, in a series of EGC patients with 
special reference to the clinicomorphological features.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the mitotic (MI) and apoptotic (AI) indices and 
the immunohistochemical expression of p27 and MIB-1 in 83 EGC cases 
consecutively recruited in the hospitals of Forlì, Verona, Siena and Milan 
(IRGGC) in the period 1994-95. The classifications of JSGE, Lauren and Kodama 
were used to define the macroscopic, microscopic and growth pattern types, 
respectively. Decreased p27 expression correlated with the macroscopic escavated 
lesions and diffused mixed histotypes; the increase of MIB-1 detection with 
tumour size larger than 2 cm, but lesser than 4 cm; MI with intestinal 
histologic types and AI with mucosal and penetrating lesions, according to 
Kodama. Statistical analysis showed significative correlations among MIB-1, MI 
and AI, but not with p27 and the other variables. All these factors did not 
influence the prognosis of our patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In our series, p27, MIB-1, MI, and AI did not add any useful 
clinical. So, in EGC patients the morphological features have still the most 
important role in influencing the prognosis and treatment of patients.

A discrete-time multilevel mixture model for event history data with long-term 
survivors, with an application to an analysis of contraceptive sterilization in 
Bangladesh.

Event history models typically assume that the entire population is at risk of 
experiencing the event of interest throughout the observation period. However, 
there will often be individuals, referred to as long-term survivors, who may be 
considered a priori to have a zero hazard throughout the study period. In this 
paper, a discrete-time mixture model is proposed in which the probability of 
long-term survivorship and the timing of event occurrence are modelled jointly. 
Another feature of event history data that often needs to be considered is that 
they may come from a population with a hierarchical structure. For example, 
individuals may be nested within geographical regions and individuals in the 
same region may have similar risks of experiencing the event of interest due to 
unobserved regional characteristics. Thus, the discrete-time mixture model is 
extended to allow for clustering in the likelihood and timing of an event within 
regions. The model is further extended to allow for unobserved individual 
heterogeneity in the hazard of event occurrence. The proposed model is applied 
in an analysis of contraceptive sterilization in Bangladesh. The results show 
that a woman's religion and education level affect her probability of choosing 
sterilization, but not when she gets sterilized. There is also evidence of 
community-level variation in sterilization timing, but not in the probability of 
sterilization.

Overall, in the hands of an experienced surgeon, the outcomes following radical 
prostatectomy are excellent. Attention to patient selection, preoperative 
management, surgical technique, and postoperative management are essential 
factors contributing to favorable outcomes for men with a biologically 
significant cancer and 10-year life expectancy. For these men, radical 
prostatectomy represents the optimal management based on cure, morbidity, and 
quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Aortic root replacement with cryopreserved allografts is associated 
with excellent hemodynamics, little endocarditis, low thromboembolic event 
rates, and no need for anticoagulation. There is, however, concern regarding the 
long-term durability of this valve substitute, especially in younger patients. 
Meta-analysis and microsimulation were used to calculate age-specific long-term 
prognosis after allograft aortic root replacement based on current evidence.
METHODS: Our center's experience with cryopreserved allograft aortic root 
replacement in 165 adult patients was combined in a meta-analysis with reported 
and individual results from four other hospitals. Using this information, the 
microsimulation model predicted age- and gender-specific total and 
reoperation-free and event-free life expectancy.
RESULTS: The pooled results comprised 629 patients with a total follow-up of 
1860 patient-years (range 0 to 12.8 years). Annual risks were 0.6% for 
thromboembolism, 0.05% for bleeding, 0.5% for endocarditis, and 0.5% for 
nonstructural valve failure. Structural allograft failure requiring reoperation 
occurred in 15 patients, and a patient age-specific Weibull function was 
constructed accordingly. Calculated total life expectancy varied from 27 years 
in a 25-year-old to 12 years in a 65-year-old male; corresponding actual 
lifetime risk of reoperation was 89% and 35%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Cryopreserved aortic allografts have an age-related limited 
durability. This results in a considerable lifetime risk of reoperation, 
especially in young patients. The combination of meta-analysis and 
microsimulation provides an appropriate tool for estimating individualized 
long-term outcome after aortic valve replacement and can be useful both for 
patient counseling and prognostic research purposes.

Mormyrogyrodactylus gemini gen. et sp. n. (Gyrodactylidea: Gyrodactylidae), a 
viviparous monogenean is described from the skin and fins of Marcusenius 
macrolepidotus (Peters) from South Africa. This new genus is unique in having a 
large cup-shaped cirrus armed with one large needle-like spine and numerous 
small hair-like spinelets. A peduncular bar is present. The haptor is clearly 
demarcated from the body and situated on a small pedicle. The haptor has one 
pair of large anchors, a ventral bar complex, a small dorsal bar and 16 evenly 
spaced marginal hooks. The ventral bar complex consists of three parts: an 
inverted U-shaped piece with two semi-attached bars, each bar consisting of a 
base and an extension. An accessory inverted T-shaped sclerite is present on the 
posterior rim of the haptor. Mormyrogyrodactylus is the fifth genus of the 
Gyrodactylidae to be described from Africa.

Survival of Drosophila melanogaster was estimated in 128 successive generations 
for 5 years. The resultant 116 samples (58 for females and 58 for males) 
containing series of individual values of life span (LS; 50-90 values in each 
series) were analyzed. Each of 58 pairs of samples belonged to a definite 
generation in a continuous succession where every next generation was an 
offspring of the preceding one. In total, 10180 Drosophila flies (5100 females 
and 5080 males) were studied. The mean life span (MLS) was found to be 
considerably heterogeneous in the series of generations: in many pairs of 
consecutive generations, MLSs significantly differed within two errors of the 
mean (P<0.05), and the minimum and maximum MLSs in the series differed from each 
other almost twofold. The use of the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test made it 
possible to conclusively demonstrate highly significant (P<0.001) differences 
between LS distributions and their medians in the series of successive 
generations of D. melanogaster. Highly significant (P<0.0001) positive 
correlations (from 0.61 to 0.91) between the parameters characterizing the 
minimum (t(10)), mean, and maximum (t(90)) LSs were found. This indicates 
considerable consistency of the LS variations in successive generations of the 
same population, with the proportions of individuals with low and high LSs 
remaining about the same irrespective of the MLS. It was demonstrated with the 
use of mathematical simulation that the MLS changes in successive generations 
may be regarded as an oscillatory process and described as a sum of several 
(three to five) harmonic components. The calculated determination coefficients 
were high (93.51 and 88.93% for females and males, respectively). This indicates 
that the mathematical model used for simulation adequately described the 
observed variations in MLS. The results are discussed in terms of population 
gerontology and the problem of geroprotector effectiveness.

What does a fly's individual fecundity pattern look like? The dynamics of 
resource allocation in reproduction and ageing.

Reproduction is usually characterised by an average fecundity pattern having a 
maximum at earlier ages and a subsequent gradual decline later on. An individual 
fecundity trajectory does not follow such a pattern and has no maximum. A 
three-stage pattern, which includes maturation, maturity and reproductive 
senescence, is a more appropriate description. An analysis of the power balance 
of an adult female fly during its life course allows us to predict two critical 
periods in an individual life history. The first crisis occurs at early ages 
when the increasing power demand becomes greater than the power supply. It often 
results in premature death. The surviving flies enjoy maturity and lay eggs at a 
presumably constant rate. The second critical period at advanced ages ends up in 
a senescence-caused death. Our approach predicts that there will be a bimodal 
death time distribution for a population of flies.

Strain variation in the response of body temperature to dietary restriction.

Dietary restriction (DR, also referred to as calorie restriction, energy 
restriction, and food restriction) retards senescence and increases longevity in 
mammals. DR also lowers mean body temperature (T(b)), and thus mean T(b) might 
be useful as a covariate of DR-induced life extension. Indeed, lower T(b) could 
itself underlie some of the beneficial life-extension effects that occur during 
DR. To assess the relationship between lower T(b) during DR and life extension, 
we asked whether significant strain variation exists in the T(b) response of 
mice being fed 60% ad libitum (AL). Individually-housed, female mice from 28 
strains, representing a genealogically diverse sample of the classical inbred 
strains, were directly compared. The mean T(b)s in response to DR exhibited 
highly significant strain variation, ranging from 1.5 degrees C below normal to 
a phenomenal 5 degrees C below normal. This variation was not explained by 
differences in loss of thermoregulation, AL adiposity, sensitivity to a 
nonadaptive hypothermia, motor activity, thermal arousal, absolute food intake, 
or efficacy of nutrient extraction. The variation in strain mean T(b) was also 
present in the absence of torpor. This strain variation could be used to 
critically test whether lower T(b) is a covariate of life extension during DR.

Adult strabismus surgery under propofol sedation with local versus general 
anesthesia.

Greenberg MF(1), Pollard ZF.

Author information:
(1)Eye Consultants of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA.

PURPOSE: To compare operating room and hospital discharge times between adult 
strabismus surgeries using intravenous propofol sedation with local anesthesia 
versus those using general anesthesia.
METHODS: Thirty adult patients underwent uncomplicated strabismus procedures 
performed by one surgeon using propofol sedation and local subtenon's 
anesthesia. These were retrospectively matched with adult patients undergoing 
similar procedures by another surgeon using general inhalational anesthesia. 
Only one muscle had undergone previous surgery, and no adjustable sutures were 
used. Times from incision closure to leaving the operating room (Out OR time), 
and to hospital discharge (DC time) are compared.
RESULTS: Propofol/local Out OR times ranged 2 to 8 minutes (mean, 4.8). General 
anesthesia Out OR times ranged from 3 to 28 minutes (mean, 8.8) (means differ at 
P<.001). At 10 minutes, 100% of propofol patients left the OR, but only 63% of 
general patients had done so (P<.001). Propofol/local DC times ranged from 30 to 
140 minutes (mean, 64.8). General DC times ranged from 68 to 325 minutes (mean 
116.5) (means differ at P<.001). At 60 minutes after completion of surgery, 53% 
of propofol/local patients had left the hospital, whereas none of general 
patients had left (P<.001). At 2.5 hours after surgery, 100% of propofol/local 
patients had left the hospital, but 10% of general patients remained, with two 
staying more than 5 hours.
CONCLUSIONS: Many adult strabismus surgeries may be performed more efficiently 
with intravenous propofol sedation and local subtenon's anesthesia than with 
general anesthesia. Times from the end of surgery to leaving both the OR and the 
hospital are decreased compared with those of general anesthesia. Extreme delays 
are rare with propofol/local, but they occurred with general anesthesia.

Quality-adjusted survival after tumor resection and/or radiation therapy for 
elderly patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

Muacevic A(1), Kreth FW.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurosurgery, Klinikum Grosshadern, 
Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377 Munich, Germany.

OBJECTIVE: Prognostic factors are poorly defined for the elderly subpopulation 
with glioblastoma multiforme and have been exclusively related to conventional 
survival analysis. In this study an additional quality adjusted survival 
analysis (QAS) was performed. The prognostic evaluation of both survival- and 
QAS data after standard treatment were checked for concordant/discordant 
findings. Their usefulness for estimation of treatment effects and treatment 
strategies was then evaluated.
METHODS: 123 patients >or= 65 years of age with a supratentorial, de novo 
glioblastoma were included in the current retrospective report. Microsurgery 
plus radiation therapy (planned tumor dose: 60 Gy) was performed in 58 patients, 
and radiation therapy alone after stereotactic biopsy (planned tumor dose: 60 
Gy) in 65 patients. The functional status of each patient was scored when 
joining the study and at every follow-up using 15 selected neurological signs 
and symptoms (NSSs). Gradation of severity of each NSS was performed with 
subjective weights. Survival time of each patient was adjusted according to any 
changes in these NSSs to become the Quality Time (Q-TIME). Time intervals spent 
with side effects of the treatment (TOX) were subtracted from Q-TIME to become 
the patient's QAS (QAS = Q-TIME-TOX). Prognostic factors for both survival and 
QAS were obtained from the Cox model.
