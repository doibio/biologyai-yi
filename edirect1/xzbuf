not been widely implemented in clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate decisional and 
information needs among users with mental illness as a prerequisite for the 
development of a decision support tool aimed at supporting SDM in 
community-based mental health services in Sweden.
METHODS: Three semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with 22 
adult users with mental illness. The transcribed interviews were analyzed using 
a directed content analysis. This method was used to develop an in-depth 
understanding of the decisional process as well as to validate and conceptually 
extend Elwyn et al.'s model of SDM.
RESULTS: The model Elwyn et al. have created for SDM in somatic care fits well 
for mental health services, both in terms of process and content. However, the 
results also suggest an extension of the model because decisions related to 
mental illness are often complex and involve a number of life domains. Issues 
related to social context and individual recovery point to the need for a 
preparation phase focused on establishing cooperation and mutual understanding 
as well as a clear follow-up phase that allows for feedback and adjustments to 
the decision-making process.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The current study contributes to a 
deeper understanding of decisional and information needs among users of 
community-based mental health services that may reduce barriers to participation 
in decision-making. The results also shed light on attitudinal, 
relationship-based, and cognitive factors that are important to consider in 
adapting SDM in the mental health system.

BACKGROUND: Increasing age is associated with elevated risk of non-communicable 
diseases, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) ε4 allele is a risk factor not only for AD, but also for cognitive 
decline, depressive symptoms, stroke, hypertension, coronary heart disease, 
cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The Lao People's Democratic Republic 
(Laos) is undergoing development; consequently, life expectancy has risen. To 
evaluate the future risk of non-communicable diseases, we investigated APOE 
genotypes and anthropometric characteristics in the Laotian population.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Subjects were 455 members of the Lao Loum 
majority and 354 members of ethnic minorities. APOE genotypes, anthropometric 
characteristics, blood pressure, and blood glucose were recorded. To compare 
individual changes, health examination data collected 5 years apart were 
obtained from a subset of Lao Loum subjects. APOE ε4 allele frequencies were 
higher among minorities (31.3%) than among Lao Loum (12.6%). In Lao Loum, but 
not in minorities, mean waist circumference and blood pressure increased 
significantly across age groups. Comparisons of health conditions between the 
beginning and end of the 5-year period revealed significant increases in obesity 
and blood glucose levels in Lao Loum. APOE ε4 carriers exhibited significant 
increases in resting heart rate in both ethnic groups.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A higher ε4 allele frequency was observed in Laotian 
minorities than in the Laotian majority. Furthermore, higher obesity, blood 
pressure and blood glucose were observed in the middle-aged ethnic majority. 
Therefore, given these genetic and non-communicable disease risk factors, it 
seems likely that as the Laotian population ages, elevated rates of 
non-communicable aging-related diseases, such as dementia, will also become more 
prevalent.

BACKGROUND: The ability to infer network structure from multivariate neuronal 
signals is central to computational neuroscience. Directed network analyses 
typically use parametric approaches based on auto-regressive (AR) models, where 
networks are constructed from estimates of AR model parameters. However, the 
validity of using low order AR models for neurophysiological signals has been 
questioned. A recent article introduced a non-parametric approach to estimate 
directionality in bivariate data, non-parametric approaches are free from 
concerns over model validity.
NEW METHOD: We extend the non-parametric framework to include measures of 
directed conditional independence, using scalar measures that decompose the 
overall partial correlation coefficient summatively by direction, and a set of 
functions that decompose the partial coherence summatively by direction. A time 
domain partial correlation function allows both time and frequency views of the 
data to be constructed. The conditional independence estimates are conditioned 
on a single predictor.
RESULTS: The framework is applied to simulated cortical neuron networks and 
mixtures of Gaussian time series data with known interactions. It is applied to 
experimental data consisting of local field potential recordings from bilateral 
hippocampus in anaesthetised rats.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): The framework offers a non-parametric 
approach to estimation of directed interactions in multivariate neuronal 
recordings, and increased flexibility in dealing with both spike train and time 
series data.
CONCLUSIONS: The framework offers a novel alternative non-parametric approach to 
estimate directed interactions in multivariate neuronal recordings, and is 
applicable to spike train and time series data.

[Enhanced radiosensitivity of H22 ascitic tumor to 12C6+ ions radiation in 
ultra-filtration extract mixture from Astragalus mongholicus-treated mice].

[Article in Chinese]

Wang BB, Wang XH, Liu K, Sun SB, Song P, Li YD.

This study was designed to investigate the impact of ultra-filtration extract 
mixture from Astragals mongholicus (UEMAM) o radiosensitivity of H22 ascitic 
tumor in mice to 12C6+ ions radiation. The H22 ascitic tumor model was 
established in mice by intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 mL H22 ascitic cells. 
The animals were subsequently divided into 4 groups randomly, treated with 
normal saline, UEMAM, heavy ion beam radiotherapy and UEMAM plus heavy ion beam 
radiotherapy, respectively. The body weights, abdomen circumference of the mice 
were measured and the mouse behavior was monitored every day; survival time was 
recorded to evaluate life extension effect; flow cytometry technique was used to 
detect H22 cell apoptosis and cell cycle; protein levels of p53, Bax, Bcl-2 and 
cleaved Caspase-3 were analyzed by Western blot; the single cell gel 
electrophoresis was used to detect the level of deoxyribonucleic acid damage 
(DNA damage). The results suggest that UEMAM significantly increased survival 
time, and decreased body weights and abdomen circumference over the saline 
control group. The treatment increased cell apoptosis, cycle arrest and DNA 
damage compared to the saline control group. UEMAM significantly enhanced the 
therapeutic effect of heavy ion beam radiation in survival time, and decreased 
body weights and abdomen circumference in the tumor-baring mice. The combination 
increased cell apoptosis, cycle arrest and DNA damage compared to the 
radiotherapy group. The results of Western blot suggest that the treatment 
significantly enhanced p53-induced apoptotic signals. The experiment discovered 
that UEMAM could improve radiosensitivity of H22 ascitic tumor through 
activation of p53-mediated apoptotic signal pathway.

INTRODUCTION: Physician shortages in the USA, an issue that has been 
particularly challenging in Mississippi, have been a concern among health 
scholars and policy makers for several decades. Physician shortages hinder 
residents from easily obtaining routine care, potentially magnifying health 
disparities. This study examines physician career life expectancy, or how long 
physicians typically practice, in Mississippi.
METHODS: Data on Mississippi's physician population actively involved between 
2007 and 2011 were obtained from the Mississippi State Board of Medical 
Licensure. Abridged career life tables were constructed for all Mississippi 
physicians and population subgroups based on practice specialty, gender, race, 
urban-rural practice, and health professional shortage area status.
RESULTS: Upon entry into practice in Mississippi, physicians practiced for about 
14.4 years. Rural physicians, primary care physicians, minority physicians, 
physicians practicing in health professional shortage areas, and men had the 
longest career expectancies. Physicians who are women or who practice in urban 
counties were substantially more likely to exit practice compared to all other 
subgroups examined. The odds of remaining in practice were significantly 
different based on gender, race, urban-rural practice county, and health 
professional shortage area status.
CONCLUSIONS: The first 5 years of practice are the most critical regarding 
retention for all physicians, regardless of practice specialty, gender, race, 
urban-rural status, or health professional shortage area status.

BACKGROUND: The content and wording of the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement 
Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function and Pain Interference item banks 
have not been qualitatively assessed by individuals with knee joint impairments. 
The purpose of this investigation was to identify items in the PROMIS Physical 
Function and Pain Interference Item Banks that are irrelevant, unclear, or 
otherwise difficult to respond to for individuals with impairment of the knee 
and to suggest modifications based on cognitive interviews.
METHODS: Twenty-nine individuals with knee joint impairments qualitatively 
assessed items in the Pain Interference and Physical Function Item Banks in a 
mixed-methods cognitive interview. Field notes were analyzed to identify themes 
and frequency counts were calculated to identify items not relevant to 
individuals with knee joint impairments.
RESULTS: Issues with clarity were identified in 23 items in the Physical 
Function Item Bank, resulting in the creation of 43 new or modified items, 
typically changing words within the item to be clearer. Interpretation issues 
included whether or not the knee joint played a significant role in overall 
health and age/gender differences in items. One quarter of the original items 
(31 of 124) in the Physical Function Item Bank were identified as irrelevant to 
the knee joint. All 41 items in the Pain Interference Item Bank were identified 
as clear, although individuals without significant pain substituted other 
symptoms which interfered with their life.
CONCLUSIONS: The Physical Function Item Bank would benefit from additional items 
that are relevant to individuals with knee joint impairments and, by extension, 
to other lower extremity impairments. Several issues in clarity were identified 
that are likely to be present in other patient cohorts as well.

Current and Future Challenges in Point-of-Care Technologies: A Paradigm-Shift in 
Affordable Global Healthcare With Personalized and Preventive Medicine.

Dhawan AP, Heetderks WJ, Pavel M, Acharya S, Akay M, Mairal A, Wheeler B, Dacso 
CC, Sunder T, Lovell N, Gerber M, Shah M, Senthilvel SG, Wang MD, Bhargava B.

This paper summarizes the panel discussion at the IEEE Engineering in Medicine 
and Biology Point-of-Care Healthcare Technology Conference (POCHT 2013) held in 
Bangalore India from Jan 16-18, 2013. Modern medicine has witnessed 
interdisciplinary technology innovations in healthcare with a continuous growth 
in life expectancy across the globe. However, there is also a growing global 
concern on the affordability of rapidly rising healthcare costs. To provide 
quality healthcare at reasonable costs, there has to be a convergence of 
preventive, personalized, and precision medicine with the help of technology 
innovations across the entire spectrum of point-of-care (POC) to critical care 
at hospitals. The first IEEE EMBS Special Topic POCHT conference held in 
Bangalore, India provided an international forum with clinicians, healthcare 
providers, industry experts, innovators, researchers, and students to define 
clinical needs and technology solutions toward commercialization and translation 
to clinical applications across different environments and infrastructures. This 
paper presents a summary of discussions that took place during the keynote 
presentations, panel discussions, and breakout sessions on needs, challenges, 
and technology innovations in POC technologies toward improving global 
healthcare. Also presented is an overview of challenges and trends in developing 
and developed economies with respect to priority clinical needs, technology 
innovations in medical devices, translational engineering, information and 
communication technologies, infrastructure support, and patient and clinician 
acceptance of POC healthcare technologies.

OBJECTIVE: In end-stage knee osteoarthritis the treatment of choice is total 
knee arthroplasty (TKA). An alternative treatment is knee joint distraction 
(KJD), suggested to postpone TKA. Several studies reported significant and 
prolonged clinical improvement of KJD. To make an appropriate decision regarding 
the position of this treatment, a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis 
from healthcare perspective for different age and gender categories was 
performed.
METHODS: A treatment strategy starting with TKA and a strategy starting with KJD 
for patients of different age and gender was simulated. To extrapolate outcomes 
to long-term health and economic outcomes a Markov (Health state) model was 
used. The number of surgeries, QALYs, and treatment costs per strategy were 
calculated. Costs-effectiveness is expressed using the cost-effectiveness plane 
and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: Starting with KJD the number of knee replacing procedures could be 
reduced, most clearly in the younger age categories; especially revision 
surgery. This resulted in the KJD strategy being dominant (more effective with 
cost-savings) in about 80% of simulations (with only inferiority in about 1%) in 
these age categories when compared to TKA. At a willingness to pay of 20.000 
Euro per QALY gained, the probability of starting with KJD to be cost-effective 
compared to starting with a TKA was already found to be over 75% for all age 
categories and over 90-95% for the younger age categories.
CONCLUSION: A treatment strategy starting with knee joint distraction for knee 
osteoarthritis has a large potential for being a cost-effective intervention, 
especially for the relatively young patient.

BACKGROUND: The widely recognized clinical and epidemiological relevance of the 
socioeconomic determinants of health-disease conditions is expected to be 
specifically critical in terms of chronic diseases in fragile populations in 
low-income countries. However, in the literature, there is a substantial gap 
between the attention directed towards the medical components of these problems 
and the actual adoption of strategies aimed at providing solutions for the 
associated socioeconomic determinants, especially in pediatric populations. We 
report a prospective outcome study on the independent contribution and 
reciprocal interaction of the medical and socioeconomic factors to the hard 
end-point of mortality in a cohort of children with chronic kidney disease in 
Nicaragua.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Every child (n = 309) diagnosed with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) and referred to the tertiary unit of Pediatric Nephrology in 
Managua (Nicaragua) from a network of nine hospitals serving 80% of the 
country's pediatric population was registered between January 2005 and December 
2013. The three main socioeconomic determinants evaluated were family income, 
living conditions and the family's level of education. Further potential 
determinants of the outcomes included duration of exposure to disease, CKD stage 
at the first visit as suggested by the KDOQI guidelines in children, the time it 
took the patients to reach the reference centre and rural or urban context of 
life. Well-defined and systematically collected medical and socioeconomic data 
were available for 257 children over a mean follow-up period of 2.5±2.5 years. 
Mortality and lost to follow-up were considered as outcome end-points both 
independently and in combination, because of the inevitably progressive nature 
of the disease. A high proportion (55%) of children presented in the advanced 
stages of CKD (CKD stage IV and V) at the first visit. At the end of follow-up, 
145 (57%) of the 257 cohort children were alive, 47 (18%) were lost to follow-up 
and 65 (25%) had died. Cox regression analysis showed an independent 
contribution to mortality of CKD stage at diagnosis and of level of education, 
with overlapping HR values (HR and 95%CI: 2.66; 1.93-3.66 and 2.72; 1.71-4.33, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The unfavourable socioeconomic and cultural background of the 
pediatric study cohort and the severity of kidney damage at diagnosis were the 
key determinants of the clinical risk conditions at baseline and of the 
mortality outcome. Long-term structural interventions on such backgrounds must 
be adopted to assure effectiveness of medical care and to assure an earlier 
diagnosis of CKD in these patients. The translation-extension of our results is 
currently underway with an agenda which includes: 1) better integration of 
chronic pediatric conditions into primary care strategies to promote prevention 
and early timely referral; 2) the consideration of socioeconomic conditions as a 
mandatory component of the packages of best-care; 3) the formulation and 
flexible adaptation of guidelines and educational programs, based on the 
information generated by a context-specific, epidemiological monitoring of needs 
and outcomes, guaranteed by an effective database.

Surgery, University of California Davis Health System, Sacramento, CA.

DESIGN: Retrospective, single-center analysis of multilevel anterior fusion 
rates and health-related quality-of-life outcomes of mineralized collagen and 
bone marrow aspirate (BMA) in anterior interbody fusion cages for spine fusion 
surgery.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability and effectiveness of mineralized collagen 
and BMA to achieve multilevel anterior spinal fusion in adult spinal deformity 
patients when placed in carbon fiber reinforced polymer cages.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: High rates of postoperative pain and nonunion can 
result from spine fusion procedures. Factors that affect the success of fusion 
include patient comorbidities, position of implant, and mechanical and 
biological deficiencies, as well as the choice of bone graft replacement.
METHODS: Analysis of radiographic images and health-related quality-of-life 
outcomes was performed for a consecutive series of 22 prospectively enrolled 
adult spinal deformity patients with 104 total anterior fusion levels. Fusions 
were graded by 3 blinded surgeons not involved in the operative procedure; each 
fusion was graded on a 1-4 scale based on fusion mass appearance. Levels with an 
average fusion grade of 1-2.4 were classified as fused; levels with an average 
grade >2.5 were classified as not fused.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 51.5 years (range, 38-61) with 21 females. A 
total of 95% of anterior operative levels were graded as fused based on 
flexion/extension and full-length biplane radiographs at 1 year. Computed 
tomography grading showed a reduced fusion rate at 87% overall. There was a 
statistically significant improvement in the Oswestry Disability Index and 
Scoliosis Research Society 22-item questionnaire scores at 1 and 2 years after 
index surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Fusion rates in multilevel anterior spinal fusion using mineralized 
collagen and BMA are relatively low compared with fusion rates of 95% or more 
reported in the existing literature on long fusions with bone morphogenetic 
protein.

BACKGROUND: Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) represent the cornerstone of 
immunosuppressive therapy after liver transplantation. A recent network 
meta-analysis (NMA) evaluated the relative efficacy of CNIs ciclosporin, 
prolonged-release (PR) tacrolimus, and immediate-release (IR) tacrolimus in 
adult liver transplant recipients based on randomized and large observational 
trials published since 2000. Based on the NMA findings, the present study 
evaluated the cost-utility of PR tacrolimus relative to ciclosporin or IR 
tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients in the UK.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-utility of 
immunosuppressive regimens in liver transplant recipients, capturing costs 
associated with immunosuppression, retransplantation, acute rejection (AR), and 
cytomegalovirus infection. Mortality, graft loss, and AR odds ratios were 
derived from the NMA. Costs were taken from the British National Formulary and 
the NHS National Tariff and expressed in 2016 pounds sterling. Future costs and 
effects were discounted at 3.5% annually.
RESULTS: Over 25 years, PR tacrolimus resulted in increased life expectancy and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) relative to IR tacrolimus and 
ciclosporin. Relative to ciclosporin, QALE increased by 1.17 quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) with PR tacrolimus while costs increased by GBP £4645, 
yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £3962 per QALY 
gained. Relative to IR tacrolimus, QALE increased by 0.78 QALYs and costs by 
£1474, resulting in an ICER of £1889 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis 
showed the analysis to be most sensitive to dosing assumptions.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on a UK-specific analysis of the projected cost-utility of PR 
tacrolimus relative to IR tacrolimus and ciclosporin, PR tacrolimus was 
cost-effective, improving life expectancy and QALE relative to both IR 
tacrolimus and ciclosporin, yielding ICERs below £20 000 per QALY gained. The 
main limitations of the study were data source heterogeneity and omitting the 
economic and clinical effects of treating aspects of recurrent liver disease.

Incidence of malignancy and outcomes for dogs undergoing splenectomy for 
incidentally detected nonruptured splenic nodules or masses: 105 cases 
(2009-2013).

Cleveland MJ, Casale S.

OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency of malignancy and survival rates of dogs 
that underwent splenectomy for incidentally detected nonruptured splenic masses 
or nodules. DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 105 client-owned dogs. 
PROCEDURES Medical records of dogs that underwent splenectomy at a veterinary 
teaching hospital between 2009 and 2013 were examined to identify patients with 
incidentally detected nonruptured splenic masses or nodules without associated 
hemoperitoneum. Only dogs with histologically confirmed diagnoses were included. 
Information regarding signalment, preoperative diagnostic tests, perioperative 
blood product transfusions, splenic mass diameter, histologic findings, 
adjunctive treatments, and survival time was collected and analyzed. RESULTS 74 
of 105 (70.5%) patients had benign splenic lesions and 31 (29.5%) had malignant 
neoplasia, most commonly hemangiosarcoma (18/31 [58%]). The hazard of death 
decreased as preoperative PCV increased; histopathologic diagnosis of malignant 
neoplasia was significantly associated with an increased hazard of death. Median 
life expectancy of dogs with benign and malignant lesions was 436 and 110 days, 
respectively; 41 of 74 patients with benign lesions and 3 of 31 patients with 
malignant neoplasia were still alive at study conclusion. Median life expectancy 
of dogs with hemangiosarcoma was 132 days; only 7 of these 18 dogs received any 
adjunctive chemotherapeutic treatments. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE 
Incidentally found, nonruptured splenic masses or nodules without associated 
hemoperitoneum were most commonly benign. Results suggested that life expectancy 
for these dogs with incidentally detected benign or malignant splenic lesions 
that received prompt intervention was better than has previously been reported 
for other studied populations.

Men and women with hip fracture have higher short-term mortality. This study 
investigated mortality risk over two decades post-fracture; excess mortality 
remained high in women up to 10 years and in men up to 20 years. Cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and pneumonia were leading causes of death with a long-term 
doubling of risk.
INTRODUCTION: Hip fractures are associated with increased mortality, 
particularly short term. In this study with a two-decade follow-up, we examined 
mortality and cause of death compared to the background population.
METHODS: We followed 1013 hip fracture patients and 2026 matched community 
controls for 22 years. Mortality, excess mortality, and cause of death were 
analyzed and stratified for age and sex. Hazard ratio (HR) was estimated by Cox 
regression. A competing risk model was fitted to estimate HR for common causes 
of death (CVD, cancer, pneumonia) in the short and long term (>1 year).
RESULTS: For both sexes and at all ages, mortality was higher in hip fracture 
patients across the observation period with men losing most life years 
(p < 0.001). Mortality risk was higher for up to 15 years (women (risk ratio 
(RR) 1.9 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.7-2.1]); men (RR 2.8 [2.2-3.5])) and 
until end of follow-up ((RR 1.8 [1.6-2.0]); (RR 2.7 [2.1-3.3])). Excess 
mortality by time intervals, censored for the first year, was evident in women 
(<80 years, up to 10 years; >80 years, for 5 years) and in men <80 years 
throughout. CVD and pneumonia were predominant causes of death in men and women 
with an associated higher risk in all age groups. Pneumonia caused excess 
mortality in men over the entire observation period.
CONCLUSION: In a remaining lifetime perspective, all-cause and excess mortality 
after hip fracture was higher even over two decades of follow-up. CVD and 
pneumonia reduce life expectancy for the remaining lifetime and highlights the 
need to further improve post-fracture management.

BACKGROUND: Young people's health has emerged as a neglected yet pressing issue 
in global development. Changing patterns of young people's health have the 
potential to undermine future population health as well as global economic 
development unless timely and effective strategies are put into place. We report 
the past, present, and anticipated burden of disease in young people aged 10-24 
years from 1990 to 2013 using data on mortality, disability, injuries, and 
health risk factors.
METHODS: The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) includes annual 
assessments for 188 countries from 1990 to 2013, covering 306 diseases and 
injuries, 1233 sequelae, and 79 risk factors. We used the comparative risk 
assessment approach to assess how much of the burden of disease reported in a 
given year can be attributed to past exposure to a risk. We estimated 
attributable burden by comparing observed health outcomes with those that would 
have been observed if an alternative or counterfactual level of exposure had 
occurred in the past. We applied the same method to previous years to allow 
comparisons from 1990 to 2013. We cross-tabulated the quantiles of 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by quintiles of DALYs annual increase 
from 1990 to 2013 to show rates of DALYs increase by burden. We used the GBD 
2013 hierarchy of causes that organises 306 diseases and injuries into four 
levels of classification. Level one distinguishes three broad categories: first, 
communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders; second, 
non-communicable diseases; and third, injuries. Level two has 21 mutually 
exclusive and collectively exhaustive categories, level three has 163 
categories, and level four has 254 categories.
FINDINGS: The leading causes of death in 2013 for young people aged 10-14 years 
were HIV/AIDS, road injuries, and drowning (25·2%), whereas transport injuries 
were the leading cause of death for ages 15-19 years (14·2%) and 20-24 years 
(15·6%). Maternal disorders were the highest cause of death for young women aged 
20-24 years (17·1%) and the fourth highest for girls aged 15-19 years (11·5%) in 
2013. Unsafe sex as a risk factor for DALYs increased from the 13th rank to the 
second for both sexes aged 15-19 years from 1990 to 2013. Alcohol misuse was the 
highest risk factor for DALYs (7·0% overall, 10·5% for males, and 2·7% for 
females) for young people aged 20-24 years, whereas drug use accounted for 2·7% 
(3·3% for males and 2·0% for females). The contribution of risk factors varied 
between and within countries. For example, for ages 20-24 years, drug use was 
highest in Qatar and accounted for 4·9% of DALYs, followed by 4·8% in the United 
Arab Emirates, whereas alcohol use was highest in Russia and accounted for 
21·4%, followed by 21·0% in Belarus. Alcohol accounted for 9·0% (ranging from 
4·2% in Hong Kong to 11·3% in Shandong) in China and 11·6% (ranging from 10·1% 
in Aguascalientes to 14·9% in Chihuahua) of DALYs in Mexico for young people 
aged 20-24 years. Alcohol and drug use in those aged 10-24 years had an annual 
rate of change of >1·0% from 1990 to 2013 and accounted for more than 3·1% of 
DALYs.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings call for increased efforts to improve health and 
reduce the burden of disease and risks for diseases in later life in young 
people. Moreover, because of the large variations between countries in risks and 
burden, a global approach to improve health during this important period of life 
will fail unless the particularities of each country are taken into account. 
Finally, our results call for a strategy to overcome the financial and technical 
barriers to adequately capture young people's health risk factors and their 
determinants in health information systems.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the overall and disaggregated 
survival based on the Gleason score, age and extent of a patient cohort 
diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer according to standard clinical practice.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: We used an observational and retrospective design for the 
study. For each patient, we recorded clinical variables such as the extent 
(metastatic or locally advanced), Gleason score, age, date of diagnosis, date of 
last contact with the health system and the vital status during the last 
contact. We used univariate and multivariate statistical techniques of survival. 
The parametric survival methods enabled us to calculate the mean survival using 
extrapolation. We analysed 219 patients treated in the public health system 
between 2008 and 2011. The analysis showed statistically significant differences 
in survival depending on Gleason score, age and stage. The longest survival was 
in the subgroup younger than 75 years, with a local extent and a low-risk 
category on the Gleason scale (19.41 years), and the shortest survival (0.97 
years) was in the 75 years or older group. The survival of the other subgroups 
ranged between these outliers.
CONCLUSION: The main contribution of this study is that it is the first to 
calculate the mean survival of advanced prostate cancer in Spain in terms of the 
variables of our study population. This information helps clinicians predict the 
life expectancy of each patient according to their prognostic factors.

INTRODUCTION: Single- and multiple-fraction external beam radiotherapy (SFX-EBRT 
and MFX-EBRT) are palliative treatment options for localized metastatic bone 
pain. MFX is the preferred choice in many developed countries. Evidence shows 
little difference in how effectively SFX and MFX reduce pain. However, SFX is 
associated with higher retreatment and (in one meta-analysis) pathological 
fracture rates. MFX is, however, more time-consuming and expensive. We estimated 
the cost-effectiveness of SFX versus MFX for metastatic bone pain in breast, 
prostate and lung cancer in New Zealand.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov microsimulation model to estimate health gain 
(in quality-adjusted life-years or QALYs), health system costs (in real 2011 NZ 
dollars) and cost-effectiveness. The model was populated using effect estimates 
from randomized controlled trials and other studies, and New Zealand cancer and 
cost data. Disability weights from the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study were 
used in estimating QALYs.
RESULTS: Across all three cancers, QALY gains were similar for SFX compared to 
MFX, and per patient costs were less for SFX than MFX, with a difference of 
NZ$1469 (95% uncertainty interval $1112 to $1886) for lung cancer, $1316 ($810 
to $1854) for prostate cancer and $1344 ($855 to $1846) for breast cancer. 
Accordingly, from a cost-effectiveness perspective, SFX was the preferable 
treatment option. Various sensitivity analyses did not overturn the clear 
preference for SFX.
CONCLUSION: For all three cancers, SFX was clearly more cost-effective than MFX. 
This adds to the case for desisting from offering MFX to patients with 
metastatic bone pain, from a cost-effectiveness angle.

BACKGROUND: Information on the extent to which older people's increasing life 
expectancy is characterized by good or poor health is important for policy and 
fiscal planning. This study explores trends in health expectancies among the 
oldest old in Sweden from 1992 to 2011.
METHODS: Cross-sectional health expectancy estimates at age 77 were obtained for 
1992, 2002, 2004 and 2011 by Sullivan's method. Health expectancy was assessed 
by severe disability, mild disability and mobility problems. Changes in health 
expectancies were decomposed into the contributions attributed to changes of 
mortality rates, and changes in disability and mobility prevalence. Mortality 
data were obtained from Statistics Sweden and prevalence data from two 
nationally representative surveys, the Swedish Panel Study of Living Conditions 
of the Oldest Old and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe.
RESULTS: Years free from severe disability, mild disability and mobility 
problems increased in both men and women. Decomposition analysis indicates that 
the increase was mainly driven by the change in health status rather than change 
in mortality. In relation to total life expectancy, the general patterns suggest 
that women had a compression of health problems and men an expansion.
CONCLUSION: Men's life expectancy increased more than women's; however, the 
increased life expectancy among men was mainly characterized by disability and 
mobility problems. The results suggest that the gender gap in health expectancy 
is decreasing.
