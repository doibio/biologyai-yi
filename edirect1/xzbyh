nivolumab versus ipilimumab for the treatment of previously untreated patients 
with BRAF-advanced melanoma (BRAF-AM) from an Australian health system 
perspective.
METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was constructed to simulate the 
progress of Australian patients with BRAF-AM. The model had a 10-year time 
horizon with outcomes discounted at 5% annually. For the nivolumab group, risks 
of progression and death were based on those observed in the nivolumab arm of a 
phase III trial (nivolumab vs. dacarbazine). Progression-free survival and 
overall survival were extrapolated using parametric survival modeling with a 
log-logistic distribution. In the absence of head-to-head evidence, overall 
survival and progression-free survival for ipilimumab were estimated on the 
basis of an indirect comparison using published data. Costs of managing AM were 
estimated from a survey of Australian clinicians. The cost of ipilimumab was 
based on the reimbursement price in Australia. The cost of nivolumab was based 
on expected reimbursement prices in Australia. Quality-of-life data were 
obtained within the trial using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire.
RESULTS: Compared with ipilimumab, nivolumab therapy over 10 years was estimated 
to yield 1.58 life-years and 1.30 quality-adjusted life-years per person, at a 
(discounted) net cost of US $39,039 per person. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios for nivolumab compared with ipilimumab were US $25,101 
per year of life saved and $30,475 per quality-adjusted life-year saved.
CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab is a cost-effective means of preventing downstream 
mortality and morbidity in patients with AM compared with ipilimumab in the 
Australian setting.

BACKGROUND: A model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) is a type of meta-regression that 
uses nonlinear mixed-effects models estimated on trial-level data to relate 
patient and trial characteristics, dosing, biomarkers, and outcomes of 
treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To use a pharmacometric MBMA within a pharmacoeconomic model of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: A Markov microsimulation model was developed to estimate monthly 
changes in the key disease severity metrics of COPD (forced expiratory volume in 
1 second [FEV1] and exacerbations) to compare a hypothetical drug that increases 
FEV1 to usual care. The MBMA was used to predict a baseline exacerbation rate in 
a group of actual trial patients, given their known baseline FEV1. The 
hypothetical drug increased FEV1, thereby decreasing individuals' predicted 
exacerbation rates. Individual patient simulations allowed stochastic changes in 
monthly FEV1 decline.
RESULTS: In a sample of 1097 trial patients with a mean FEV1 of 50%, the MBMA 
predicted 0.93 exacerbations per year on average. The exacerbation rate ranged 
from 0.52 to 1.3 per year across moderate and severe patient subgroups. A 
hypothetical anti-inflammatory drug that increased FEV1 by 50 ml decreased 
exacerbations by 26%. Given a simplified estimation of costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with COPD, a drug with a 50-ml 
increase priced at €35/mo had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranging 
from €13,000/QALY to approximately €207,000/QALY across patient severity 
subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic aspects of MBMA and pharmacoeconomic modeling are 
highlighted in this hypothetical example. Markov microsimulation modeling allows 
the finer predictions of MBMA to inform parameters. Such an approach has utility 
in both early-phase cost-effectiveness estimations and trial design.

BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are increasingly used to value 
aspects of health. An issue with their adoption is that results may be sensitive 
to the order in which dimensions of health are presented in the valuation task. 
Findings in the literature regarding order effects are discordant at present.
OBJECTIVES: To quantify the magnitude of order effect of quality-of-life (QOL) 
dimensions within the context of a DCE designed to produce country-specific 
value sets for the EORTC Quality of Life Utility Measure-Core 10 dimensions 
(QLU-C10D), a new utility instrument derived from the widely used 
cancer-specific QOL questionnaire, the European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30.
METHODS: The DCE comprised 960 choice sets, divided into 60 versions of 16 
choice sets, with each respondent assigned to a version. Within each version, 
the order of QLU-C10D QOL dimensions was randomized, followed by life duration 
in the last position. The DCE was completed online by 2053 individuals in France 
and Germany. We analyzed the data with a series of conditional logit models, 
adjusted for repeated choices within respondent. We used F tests to assess order 
effects, correcting for multiple hypothesis testing.
RESULTS: Each F test failed to reject the null hypothesis of no position effect: 
1) all QOL order positions considered jointly; 2) last QOL position only; 3) 
first QOL position only. Furthermore, the order coefficients were small relative 
to those of the QLU-C10D QOL dimension levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The order of presentation of QOL dimensions within a DCE designed 
to provide utility weights for the QLU-C10D had little effect on level 
coefficients of those QOL dimensions.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analysis can guide policymakers in resource 
allocation decisions. It assesses whether the health gains offered by an 
intervention are large enough relative to any additional costs to warrant 
adoption. When there are constraints on the health care system's budget or 
ability to increase expenditures, additional costs imposed by interventions have 
an "opportunity cost" in terms of the health foregone because other 
interventions cannot be provided. Cost-effectiveness thresholds (CETs) are 
typically used to assess whether an intervention is worthwhile and should 
reflect health opportunity cost. Nevertheless, CETs used by some decision 
makers-such as the World Health Organization that suggested CETs of 1 to 3 times 
the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita-do not.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate CETs based on opportunity cost for a wide range of 
countries.
METHODS: We estimated CETs based on recent empirical estimates of opportunity 
cost (from the English National Health Service), estimates of the relationship 
between country GDP per capita and the value of a statistical life, and a series 
of explicit assumptions.
RESULTS: CETs for Malawi (the country with the lowest income in the world), 
Cambodia (with borderline low/low-middle income), El Salvador (with borderline 
low-middle/upper-middle income), and Kazakhstan (with borderline 
high-middle/high income) were estimated to be $3 to $116 (1%-51% GDP per 
capita), $44 to $518 (4%-51%), $422 to $1967 (11%-51%), and $4485 to $8018 
(32%-59%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: To date, opportunity-cost-based CETs for low-/middle-income 
countries have not been available. Although uncertainty exists in the underlying 
assumptions, these estimates can provide a useful input to inform resource 
allocation decisions and suggest that routinely used CETs have been too high.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a cancer care coordinator (CCC) 
in helping women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) early breast cancer 
persist with tamoxifen for 5 years.
METHODS: We investigated the cost-effectiveness of a CCC across eight breast 
cancer subtypes, defined by progesterone receptor (PR) status, human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and local/regional spread. These 
subtypes range from excellent to poorer prognoses. The CCC helped in improving 
tamoxifen persistence by providing information, checking-in by phone, and 
"troubleshooting" concerns. We constructed a Markov macrosimulation model to 
estimate health gain (in quality-adjusted life-years or QALYs) and health system 
costs in New Zealand, compared with no CCC. Participants were modeled until 
death or till the age of 110 years. Some input parameters (e.g., the impact of a 
CCC on tamoxifen persistence) had sparse evidence. Therefore, we used estimates 
with generous uncertainty and conducted sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of a CCC for regional ER+/PR-/HER2+ breast 
cancer (worst prognosis) was NZ $23,400 (US $15,800) per QALY gained, compared 
with NZ $368,500 (US $248,800) for local ER+/PR+/HER2- breast cancer (best 
prognosis). Using a cost-effectiveness threshold of NZ $45,000 (US $30,400) per 
QALY, a CCC would be cost-effective only in the four subtypes with the worst 
prognoses.
CONCLUSIONS: There is value in investigating cost-effectiveness by different 
subtypes within a disease. In this example of breast cancer, the poorer the 
prognosis, the greater the health gains from a CCC and the better the 
cost-effectiveness. Incorporating heterogeneity in a cost-utility analysis is 
important and can inform resource allocation decisions. It is also feasible to 
undertake in practice.

BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are becoming increasingly 
popular in orthopedic surgery. Preoperative and postoperative follow-up often 
elicit PROMs in the form of generic quality-of-life instruments (e.g., Short 
Form health survey SF-12 [SF-12]) that can be used in economic evaluation to 
estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). However, the timing of 
postoperative measurement is still under debate.
OBJECTIVES: To explore the timing of postoperative PROMs collection and the 
implications for bias in QALY estimation for economic evaluation.
METHODS: We compared the accuracy of QALY estimation on the basis of utilities 
derived from the SF-12 at one of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months 
after total knee arthroplasty, under different methods of interpolation between 
points. Five years of follow-up data were extracted from the St. Vincent's 
Melbourne Arthroplasty Outcomes (SMART) registry (n = 484). The SMART registry 
collects follow-up PROMs annually and obtained more frequent outcomes on subset 
of patients (n = 133).
RESULTS: Postoperative PROM collection at 6 weeks, 6 months, or 12 months biased 
the estimation of QALY gain from total knee arthroplasty by -41% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] -59% to -22%), 18% (95% CI 4%-32%), and -8% (95% CI -18% to -2%), 
respectively. This bias was minimized by collecting PROMs at 3 months 
postoperatively (6% error; 95% CI -9% to 21%).
CONCLUSIONS: The timing of PROM collection and the interpolation assumptions 
between measurements can bias economic evaluation. In the case of total knee 
arthroplasty, we recommend a postoperative measurement at 3 months with linear 
interpolation between preoperative and postoperative measures. The design of 
economic evaluations should consider timing and interpolation issues.

BACKGROUND: A response to the challenge of high-cost treatments in health care 
has been economic evaluation. Cost-effectiveness analysis presented as cost per 
quality-adjusted life-years gained has been controversial, raising heated 
support and opposition.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of economic evaluation in decisions on what to 
fund in four European countries and discuss the implications of our findings.
METHODS: We used a protocol to review the key features of the application of 
economic evaluation in reimbursement decision making in England, Germany, the 
Netherlands, and Sweden, reporting country-specific highlights.
RESULTS: Although the institutions and processes vary by country, health 
economic evaluation has had limited impact on restricting access of 
controversial high-cost drugs. Even in those countries that have gone the 
furthest, ways have been found to avoid refusing to fund high-cost drugs for 
particular diseases including cancer, multiple sclerosis, and orphan diseases. 
Economic evaluation may, however, have helped some countries to negotiate price 
reductions for some drugs. It has also extended to the discussion of clinical 
effectiveness to include cost.
CONCLUSIONS: The differences in approaches but similarities in outcomes suggest 
that health economic evaluation be viewed largely as rhetoric (in D.N. 
McCloskey's terms in The Rhetoric of Economics, 1985). This is not to imply that 
economics had no impact: rather that it usually contributed to the discourse in 
ways that differed by country. The reasons for this no doubt vary by 
perspective, from political science to ethics. Economic evaluation may have less 
to do with rationing or denial of medical treatments than to do with expanding 
the discourse used to discuss such issues.

BACKGROUND: Designed to overcome influenza B mismatch, new quadrivalent 
influenza vaccines (QIVs) contain one additional B strain compared with 
trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs).
OBJECTIVE: To examine the expected public health impact, budget impact, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness of QIV versus TIV in the United States.
METHODS: A dynamic transmission model was used to predict the annual incidence 
of influenza over the 20-year-period of 2014 to 2034 under either a TIV program 
or a QIV program. A decision tree model was interfaced with the transmission 
model to estimate the public health impact and the cost-effectiveness of 
replacing TIV with QIV from a societal perspective. Our models were informed by 
published data from the United States on influenza complication probabilities 
and relevant costs. The incremental vaccine price of QIV as compared with that 
of TIV was set at US $5.40 per dose.
RESULTS: Over the next 20 years, replacing TIV with QIV may reduce the number of 
influenza B cases by 27.2% (16.0 million cases), resulting in the prevention of 
137,600 hospitalizations and 16,100 deaths and a gain of 212,000 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The net societal budget impact would be US 
$5.8 billion and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio US $27,411/QALY 
gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 100% and 96.5% of the 
simulations fell below US $100,000/QALY and US $50,000/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Introducing QIV into the US immunization program may prevent a 
substantial number of hospitalizations and deaths. QIV is also expected to be a 
cost-effective alternative option to TIV.

OBJECTIVES: To assess additional life expectancy (LE), expected years of life 
lost , and lifetime health care expenditures after type 1 diabetes diagnosis, 
stratified by sex and age of first diagnosis (early: 0-12 years; late: 13-40 
years).
METHODS: A longitudinal cohort of patients with diabetes was constructed from 
Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database of 1999 to 2012. The 
survival functions for diabetic patients and age- and sex-matched general 
population were estimated by using a semiparametric extrapolation method with 
annual life tables. The average monthly health care expenditures were multiplied 
by the corresponding monthly survival rates and summed to calculate the lifetime 
health care expenditures. Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to 
corroborate the effects of sex and age, after being adjusted for comorbidities, 
complications, and calendar years.
RESULTS: A total of 2386 cases (45% early diagnosis, 49% males) were identified. 
An additional LE after diabetes diagnosis was 45.12 years, with an estimated 
17.63 years of life lost. The predicted total and diabetes-related lifetime 
costs were $56,939 and $102,140, respectively. Early diagnosed patients had a 
longer LE and lower health care spending compared with those of late-diagnosed 
patients. Male patients had a shorter LE and a higher expected years of life 
lost than the female patients, which corresponded to lower lifetime costs for 
the former. The Cox model results for overall mortality corroborated these 
trends.
CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of type 1 diabetes and sex-specific strategies 
would probably improve long-term health outcomes and save on the cost of 
diabetes care.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a national atrial fibrillation 
screening program in Ireland involving annual opportunistic pulse palpation of 
all those older than 65 years during general practitioner consultations, with an 
electrocardiogram being performed if an irregular pulse is detected.
METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was used to simulate costs and clinical 
outcomes in a hypothetical cohort of men and women with and without screening 
over the course of 25 years, using a societal perspective.
RESULTS: Screening was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of €23,004/quality-adjusted life-year compared with routine care. Nevertheless, 
if the relative risk of stroke and systematic embolism in screen-detected 
patients is more than 12% lower than that in patients with atrial fibrillation 
identified through routine practice, then screening would not be considered 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €45,000/quality-adjusted 
life-year. An analysis comparing alternative combinations of start age and 
screening interval found that less frequent screening with a later start age may 
be more cost-effective than an annual screening from age 65 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Annual opportunistic screening of men and women aged 65 years and 
older in primary care in Ireland is likely to be cost-effective using 
conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds, assuming that those detected through 
screening have a comparable stroke risk profile as those detected through 
routine practice. Raising the start age of screening or increasing the screening 
interval may improve the cost-effectiveness of a prospective screening program.

Starches from different vegetal sources (tuber, cereal and legume) were 
plasticized with an invariant glycerol content and reinforced with cellulose 
nanocrystals by solution casting method. The influence of both, starch nature 
and filler amount, in the crystallinity and the extension of plasticization have 
been analyzed by X-ray diffraction. Thermoplastic starches (TPS) morphologies 
were obtained by scanning electron microscopy. Mechanical properties and thermal 
stability were analyzed by dynamomechanical and thermogravimetric analysis. 
Water absorption evolution was studied as well. A major extension in 
plasticization (high amylopectin starches) led to matrices with large 
starch-rich domains, a good thermal stability and resistance to water absorption 
but low stiffness. The incorporation of cellulose nanoparticles favoured 
plasticization and increased the rigidity in TPS films, as well as the thermal 
stability and moisture resistance. The aim of this work was to obtain bio-based 
thermoplastic starch films for replacing petroleum-derived ones in packaging 
industry, especially for short-life applications.

Recombinant Lampetra japonica RGD peptide (rLj-RGD3) is a soluble toxin protein 
with three RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motifs and a molecular weight of 13.5kDa. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of rLj-RGD3 on tumor 
growth and survival in pancreatic carcinoma Panc-1 cell-bearing mice. A Panc-1 
human pancreatic carcinoma-bearing nude mouse model was successfully generated, 
and the animals were treated with different doses of rLj-RGD3 for 3 weeks. The 
volume and weight of the subcutaneous tumors, the survival of the nude mice, 
histopathological changes, the intratumoral MVD, the number of apoptotic Panc-1 
cells, and apoptosis-related proteins and gene expressions were determined. 
rLj-RGD3 significantly decreased the tumor volumes and weights, and the maximum 
tumor volume and weight IR values were 53.2% (p<0.001) and 55.9% (p<0.001), 
respectively. The life expectancy of Panc-1-bearing nude mice treated with 
rLj-RGD3 was increased by 56.3% (p<0.001). Meanwhile, rLj-RGD3 promoted the 
expression of Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 and inhibited Bcl-2 and VEGF 
expression. In addition, rLj-RGD3 did not change FAK, PI3K and Akt expression, 
but p-FAK, p-PI3K and p-Akt, levels were down-regulated. These results show that 
rLj-RGD3 induced potent anti-tumor activity in vivo and suppressed the growth of 
transplanted Panc-1 cells in a nude mouse model, implying that rLj-RGD3 may 
serve as a potent clinical therapeutic agent for human pancreatic carcinoma.

Toward a More Comprehensive Concept of Successful Aging: Disability and Care 
Needs.

Rowe and Kahn's model of Successful Aging 2.0 argues that changing environmental 
settings, societal policies, and individual life styles will lead to a 
significant extension of healthy life years. Recent epidemiological research, 
however, confirms the dilemma that the ongoing extension of life expectancy 
prolongs not only the years in good health but also those in poor health. We see 
it as a major limitation that Rowe and Kahn's model is not able to cover the 
emerging linkage between increasing life expectation and aging with disability 
and care needs. Therefore, we suggest a set of propositions towards a more 
comprehensive model of successful aging which captures desirable living 
situations including for those who grow old with disabilities and care needs. We 
describe individual, environmental, and care related strategies and resources 
for autonomy and quality of life when facing disabilities and care needs in late 
life, putting emphasis on inter-individual differences and social inequality. We 
argue that expanding the traditional concept of successful aging to aging with 
disabilities and care needs serves not to undermine, but rather to anchor the 
concept in aging science and in public perception.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost 
effectiveness of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for stroke prevention among 
atrial fibrillation (AF) patients by incorporating Taiwanese demographic 
information derived from a population-based database, the National Health 
Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), into cost-effectiveness analysis.
METHODS: From 1 January to 31 December 2012, 98,213 AF patients were selected 
from the NHIRD database. A Markov model was constructed that combined published 
secondary data with the Taiwan NHIRD to compare the cost and incremental cost 
effectiveness of apixaban 5 mg twice daily, dabigatran 110 or 150 mg twice 
daily, rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily, and warfarin.
RESULTS: The lifetime costs of warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, 
rivaroxaban 20 mg, and apixaban 5 mg were US$10,660, US$13,693, US$13,426, 
US$13,455, US$15,965, respectively. Apixaban resulted in an incremental cost 
effectiveness of US$39,351, US$27,039, US$41,298, and US$48,896 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg, 
dabigatran 150 mg, and rivaroxaban 20 mg, respectively. In Monte-Carlo analyses, 
apixaban 5 mg, rivaroxaban 20 mg, warfarin, and dabigatran 110 mg were cost 
effective in 83, 10.4, 7, and 0.8%, respectively, of the simulations using a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of US$50,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban was more cost effective than warfarin, dabigatran, and 
rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in patients with AF. Among the anticoagulant 
therapies, the WTP threshold of apixaban was about US$50,000 per QALY gained. 
These cost-effectiveness estimations provide useful information to aid clinical 
decision making in stroke prevention for AF patients.

BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The prosthetic valve of choice in patients with 
carcinoid valve disease (CVD) remains controversial due to the limited life 
expectancy of patients with advanced-stage neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) on the 
one hand, and concerns regarding structural valve deterioration (SVD) on the 
other hand.
METHODS: The records of 17 patients (11 females, seven males; mean age 65 ± 11 
years; undergoing 18 operations) with primarily right heart failure due to CVD 
were reviewed. All patients received somatostatin analogs perioperatively. 
Hospital and follow up data (acquired via direct patient contact and 
echocardiography) collected included baseline characteristics, procedural 
details, and clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: The primary NET site was the ileum (n = 11), lungs (n = 2) and stomach, 
colon and appendix (n = 1 each). In one patient the primary tumor location could 
not be identified. Preoperative urinary levels of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid 
(5-HIAA; 61 ± 36 mg/24 h) and serum levels of chromogranin A (2926 ± 4057 ng/ml) 
were 10- and 50-fold greater than normal, respectively. A total of 23 valves was 
implanted: five tricuspid valve replacements (TVR; four tissue and one 
mechanical), TVR and pulmonary valve replacements (PVR; three tissue and one 
mechanical), and TVR and mitral valve replacements (MVR; one tissue and two 
mechanical). The 30-day mortality was 11% (n = 2). No patient experienced a 
carcinoid crisis. The mean follow up was 24 ± 21 months (range: 4-85 months). 
Four patients (receiving seven valves) developed SVD at 12, 14, 15, and 20 
months after surgery, and all of these patients died. The actuarial four-year 
survival and freedom from SVD were 23 ± 14% and 43 ± 15%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The data acquired suggested that the main advantage of tissue valve 
prostheses, namely to avoid lifelong, intense anticoagulation, might be offset 
by accelerated SVD. The use of mechanical valves should be considered in CVD 
patients with a large primary tumor mass and persistent high urinary levels of 
5-HIAA, and who are unresponsive to therapy.

BACKGROUND: A comparison was made between the long-term survival of patients 
undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis and of the general 
Icelandic population, using centralized registries.
METHODS: A total of 366 AVR patients (231 males, 135 females; mean age 70.1 
years) operated on for aortic stenosis in Iceland between 2002 and 2011 was 
included in the study. Concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting was performed 
in 54% of cases. Short-term complications and 30-day mortality were analyzed. 
The patients' overall survival was compared with the survival of Icelanders of 
the same age and gender. The median follow up was 4.7 years.
RESULTS: A bioprosthesis was used in 81% of the patients; the median prosthesis 
size was 25 mm. Atrial fibrillation (68%) and acute kidney injury (23%) were the 
most common complications, and the 30-day operative mortality was 6%. Overall 
survival at one year and five years was 92% and 82%, respectively. There was no 
difference in survival between the surgical cohorts and expected survival of 
Icelanders of the same age and gender (p = 0.08), except for the first 30 
postoperative days.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the significant rate of short-term complications, the 
long-term survival of patients undergoing AVR for aortic stenosis was good 
compared to the general population of the same age and gender. These results 
confirmed the value of AVR as an excellent treatment option for aortic stenosis, 
as it offers a normalization of the patients' life expectancy.

There is information indicating that the variations induced by the menstrual 
cycle may influence the capacity of young women to respond to stress. The 
physiological response to stress changes across the stages of the lifespan; 
however, in spite of the great increase in life expectancy, the way women react 
after menopause, a period characterized by a dramatic decline in sex hormones, 
has not been sufficiently studied. The main objective of the study was to 
examine the capacity to respond to and recover from an acute social stressor in 
post-menopausal women compared to young women. The second objective was to 
investigate the consequences of behavior on the self-regulatory systems. We 
measured behavior, cortisol, and heart rate during a speaking task in front of a 
committee in sixty-seven women: 36 post-menopausal and 31 pre-menopausal 
(follicular group n=14; luteal group n=17). No differences in heart rate 
reactivity between three groups were found. Post-menopausal women showed less 
cortisol reactivity to stress; they also displayed a higher percentage of 
Gestures during the speaking task, reflecting a clearer pattern of active coping 
compared to the young women. In post-menopausal women, behaviors that reflect 
active coping strategies were related to better autonomic regulation. By 
contrast, in pre-menopausal women, cortisol changes seemed to be modulated by 
passive and reactive behaviors such as Submission and Assertion. These results 
emphasize the importance of considering age and Hormonal Status in coping 
processes, including reactivity and recovery from stressful situations.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although kangaroo mother care (KMC) has been shown to 
be safe and effective in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there are no 
published complete economic evaluations including the three components of the 
full intervention.
METHODS: A cost utility analysis performed on the results of an RCT conducted in 
Bogotá, Colombia between 1993 and 1996. Hospital and ambulatory costs were 
estimated by microcosting in a sample of preterm infants from a University 
Hospital in Bogotá in 2011 and at a KMC clinic in the same period. Utility 
scores were assigned by experts by means of (1) direct ordering and scoring 
discrete health states and (2) constructing a multi-attribute utility function. 
Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CIs) for the incremental cost-utility 
ratios (ICURs) were computed by the Fiellers theorem method. One-way sensitivity 
analysis on price estimates for valuing costs was performed.
RESULTS: ICUR at 1 year of corrected age was $ -1,546 per extra quality-adjusted 
life year gained using the KMC method (95% CI $ -7,963 to $ 4,910).
CONCLUSION: In Bogotá, the use of KMC is dominant: more effective and 
cost-saving. Although results from an economic analysis should not be 
extrapolated to different systems and communities, this dominant result suggests 
that KMC could be cost-effective in similar low and middle income countries 
settings.

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation for Treatment of Aortic Valve Stenosis: 
A Health Technology Assessment.

Health Quality Ontario.

Collaborators: Sehatzadeh S, Tu HA, Holubowich C, Higgins C.

BACKGROUND: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is the gold standard for 
treating aortic valve stenosis. It is a major operation that requires sternotomy 
and the use of a heart-lung bypass machine, but in appropriately selected 
patients with symptomatic, severe aortic valve stenosis, the benefits of SAVR 
usually outweigh the harms. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a 
less invasive procedure that allows an artificial valve to be implanted over the 
poorly functioning valve.
METHODS: We identified and analyzed randomized controlled trials that evaluated 
the effectiveness and safety of TAVI compared with SAVR or balloon aortic 
valvuloplasty and were published before September 2015. The quality of the body 
of evidence for each outcome was examined according to the Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group 
criteria. The overall quality was determined to be high, moderate, low, or very 
low using a step-wise, structural methodology. We also developed a Markov 
decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of TAVI compared with 
SAVR over a 5-year time horizon, and we conducted a 5-year budget impact 
analysis.
RESULTS: Rates of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were similar for the 
TAVI and SAVR groups in all studies except one, which reported significantly 
lower all-cause mortality in the TAVI group and a higher rate of stroke in the 
SAVR group. Trials of high-risk patients who were not suitable candidates for 
SAVR showed significantly better survival with TAVI than with balloon aortic 
valvuloplasty. Median survival in the TAVI group was 31 months, compared with 
11.7 months in the balloon aortic valvuloplasty group. Compared with SAVR, TAVI 
was associated with a significantly higher risk of stroke, major vascular 
complications, paravalvular aortic regurgitation, and the need for a permanent 
pacemaker. SAVR was associated with a higher risk of bleeding. Transapical TAVI 
was associated with higher rates of mortality and stroke than transfemoral TAVI 
in high-risk patients. TAVI and SAVR both improved patients' quality of life 
during the first year. However, because of a large amount of missing data and 
the lack of published data beyond 1 year, it was difficult to evaluate the 
impact of critical adverse outcomes on patients' longer-term health status. In 
the base-case analysis, when TAVI was compared with SAVR, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $51,988 per quality-adjusted life-year. The 5-year 
budget impact of funding TAVI ranged from $7.6 to $8.3 million per year.
CONCLUSIONS: Moderate quality evidence showed that TAVI and SAVR had similar 
mortality rates in patients who were eligible for surgery. Information about 
quality of life showed similar results for TAVI and SAVR in the first year, but 
was based on low quality evidence. Moderate quality evidence also showed that 
TAVI was associated with higher rates of adverse events than SAVR. In patients 
who were not suitable candidates for surgery, moderate quality evidence showed 
that TAVI improved survival compared with balloon aortic valvuloplasty. When 
TAVI was compared with SAVR, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
$51,988 per quality-adjusted life-year.

[Osteoporosis in men].

[Article in Czech]

Štěpán J.

The health burden of osteoporosis in men is expected to increase with an aging 
population and increasing life expectancy. Both hip and vertebral fractures are 
associated with increased morbidity and mortality in men. The clinical 
evaluation, measurement of bone mineral density using dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry, laboratory tests and fracture risk assessment is now recognized 
as the standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis in males, and a preferred approach 
to guide treatment decisions. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of 
several treatment options available for men with osteoporosis. Moreover, 
clinical interventions to improve physical performance could also reduce the 
risk of future fractures.

Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: 2017 update on diagnosis, 
risk-stratification, and management.

Tefferi A(1), Barbui T(2).

DISEASE OVERVIEW: Polycythemia Vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are 
myeloproliferative neoplasms respectively characterized by erythrocytosis and 
thrombocytosis; other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, 
thrombosis, bleeding, microcirculatory symptoms, pruritus, and risk of leukemic 
or fibrotic transformation.
DIAGNOSIS: PV is defined by a JAK2 mutation, whose absence, combined with normal 
or increased serum erythropoietin level, makes the diagnosis unlikely. JAK2, 
CALR, and MPL mutations are the mutually exclusive "driver" mutations in ET with 
respective incidences of 55%, 25%, and 3%; approximately 17% are 
triple-negative. However, the same molecular markers might also be present in 
prefibrotic myelofibrosis, whose morphological distinction from ET is 
prognostically relevant.
SURVIVAL AND LEUKEMIC/FIBROTIC TRANSFORMATION: Median survivals are 
approximately 14 years for PV and 20 years for ET; the corresponding values for 
younger patients (age <60 years) are 24 and 33 years. Life-expectancy in ET is 
inferior to the control population. Driver mutational status has not been shown 
to affect survival in ET whereas the presence of JAK2/MPL mutations has been 
associated with higher risk of arterial thrombosis and that of MPL with higher 
risk of fibrotic progression. Risk factors for overall survival in both ET and 
PV include advanced age, leukocytosis and thrombosis. Leukemic transformation 
rates at 20 years are estimated at <10% for PV and 5% for ET; fibrotic 
transformation rates are slightly higher. Most recently, ASXL1, SRSF2, and IDH2 
mutations have been associated with inferior overall, leukemia-free or 
fibrosis-free survival in PV; similarly adverse mutations in ET included SH2B3, 
SF3B1, U2AF1, TP53, IDH2, and EZH2.
THROMBOSIS RISK STRATIFICATION: Current risk stratification in PV and ET is 
designed to estimate the likelihood of recurrent thrombosis. Accordingly, PV 
includes two risk categories: high-risk (age >60 years or thrombosis history) 
and low-risk (absence of both risk factors). In ET, risk stratification includes 
four categories: very low risk (age ≤60 years, no thrombosis history, JAK2/MPL 
un-mutated), low risk (age ≤60 years, no thrombosis history, JAK2/MPL mutated), 
intermediate risk (age >60 years, no thrombosis history, JAK2/MPL un-mutated), 
and high risk (thrombosis history or age >60 years with JAK2/MPL mutation). In
