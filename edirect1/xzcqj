advanced age upon maximum duration of their lifespan. To do this, 
transplantation of 100 million nucleated cells from BM of young syngeneic donors 
to an old nonablated animal was performed at the time when half of the 
population had already died. As a result, the maximum lifespan (MLS) increased 
by 28 ± 5%, and the survival time from the beginning of the experiment increased 
2.8 ± 0.3-fold. The chimerism of the BM 6 months after the transplantation was 
28%.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate health expectancies at age 65 based on physical 
and cognitive function in 2001-2002 and 2011-2012 and project future needs for 
carers from 2021 to 2041.
METHODS: Data from the Elderly Health Centres (EHCs) of the Department of Health 
of the Government of Hong Kong comprising of people aged 65 years or older who 
enrolled between 2001 and 2002 (EHC 2001-2002) and between 2011 and 2012 (EHC 
2011-2012) provided proportion estimates for physical impairment (assessed by 
independence in activities of daily living) and cognitive impairment (assessed 
by Abbreviated Mental Test/Mini-Mental Status Examination and self-reported 
doctor diagnosis of dementia). Health expectancies (years lived with/without 
physical and/or cognitive impairment) were calculated by Sullivan's method. The 
proportions of physical and/or cognitive impairment were used to project future 
needs for carers.
RESULTS: Between 2001-2002 and 2011-2012, years lived without 
physical/cognitive impairment decreased for men but increased for women, both of 
which were less than the increases in total life expectancy. Men assessed in 
2011-2012 (classified as EHC 2011-2012) lived more years with physical and/or 
cognitive impairment than those assessed in 2001-2002 (classified as EHC 
2001-2002), and women in EHC 2011-2012 lived more years with physical 
impairment, but fewer years with cognitive impairment than those in EHC 
2001-2002, and women enrolled in EHC 2011-2012 lived more years with physical 
impairment, but fewer years with cognitive impairment than those in EHC 
2001-2002. As populations age, the number of carers needed is expected to 
increase from 344,000 in 2021 to 629,000 by 2041, or an increase of 
82.9%. Sensitivity analyses excluding the participants who had been assessed in 
2011-2012 from EHC 2001-2002 gave similar estimations.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased life expectancy was not accompanied by an increase in 
years lived without physical/cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that 
people will live longer but could be more dependent, which would have 
considerable implications for elderly service needs in Hong Kong.

BACKGROUND: Lower extremities ulcers (LEU) are associated with considerable 
morbidity and mortality. With longer life expectancy, the prevalence of LEU in 
developed countries is assumed to grow, necessitating an increased demand for 
treatment by specialists.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of a telemedicine video conferencing 
modality with the conventional face-to-face treatment of LEU.
METHODS: The study was conducted in conjunction with a two-million member 
healthcare organization in Israel (Maccabi Healthcare Services). Consecutive 
visits of patients to wound care specialists during a 12-month observation 
period reviewed in 2015 were valuated. A nurse-assisted setting was implemented 
during all treatment sessions. The same specialist supervised patients in both 
modalities.
RESULTS: A sample of 111 patients (n=55 in the telemedicine group; n=56 in the 
face-to-face group) with 593 visits was analyzed. No significant difference in 
healing of LEU (78.2% in telemedicine vs. 75.0% in face-to-face) was detected, P 
= 0.823. A reduced number of visits in telemedicine (4.36 ± 2.36) compared to 
the face-to-face care (6.32 ± 4.17) was shown, P = 0.003. Non-inferiority of 
telemedicine demonstrated within the Δ = 15% range limits and 80% statistical 
power was demonstrated.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the usual face-to-face method, synchronous video 
conferencing-based telemedicine may be a feasible and efficient method for LEU 
management.

BACKGROUND: People with traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) commonly report memory 
impairments. These are persistent, debilitating and reduce quality of life, but 
patients do not routinely receive memory rehabilitation after discharge from 
hospital.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a 
group memory rehabilitation programme for people with TBI.
DESIGN: Multicentre, pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial. Qualitative 
and health economic evaluations were also undertaken.
SETTING: Community settings in nine sites in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were aged 18-69 years, had undergone a TBI > 3 months 
prior to recruitment, reported memory problems, were able to travel to a site to 
attend group sessions, could communicate in English and gave informed consent.
RANDOMISATION AND BLINDING: Clusters of four to six participants were randomised 
to the memory rehabilitation arm or the usual-care arm on a 1 : 1 ratio. 
Randomisation was based on a computer-generated pseudo-random code using random 
permuted blocks of randomly varying size, stratified by study site. Participants 
and therapists were aware of the treatment allocation whereas outcome assessors 
were blinded.
INTERVENTIONS: In the memory rehabilitation arm 10 weekly sessions of a 
manualised memory rehabilitation programme were provided in addition to usual 
care. Participants were taught restitution strategies to retrain impaired memory 
functions and compensation strategies to enable them to cope with memory 
problems. The usual-care arm received usual care only.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were assessed at 6 and 12 months after 
randomisation. Primary outcome: patient-completed Everyday Memory Questionnaire 
- patient version (EMQ-p) at 6 months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes: Rivermead 
Behavioural Memory Test - third edition (RBMT-3), General Health Questionnaire 
30-item version, European Brain Injury Questionnaire, Everyday Memory 
Questionnaire - relative version and individual goal attainment. Costs (based on 
a UK NHS and Personal Social Services perspective) were collected using a 
service use questionnaire, with the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version, 
used to derive quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). A Markov model was developed 
to explore cost-effectiveness at 5 and 10 years, with a 3.5% discount applied.
RESULTS: We randomised 328 participants (memory rehabilitation, n = 171; usual 
care, n = 157), with 129 in the memory rehabilitation arm and 122 in the 
usual-care arm included in the primary analysis. We found no clinically 
important difference on the EMQ-p between the two arms at 6 months' follow-up 
(adjusted difference in mean scores -2.1, 95% confidence interval -6.7 to 2.5; 
p = 0.37). For secondary outcomes, differences favouring the memory 
rehabilitation arm were observed at 6 months' follow-up for the RBMT-3 and goal 
attainment, but remained only for goal attainment at 12 months' follow-up. There 
were no differences between arms in mood or quality of life. The qualitative 
results suggested positive experiences of participating in the trial and of 
attending the groups. Participants reported that memory rehabilitation was not 
routinely accessible in usual care. The primary health economics outcome at 12 
months found memory rehabilitation to be £26.89 cheaper than usual care but less 
effective, with an incremental QALY loss of 0.007. Differences in costs and 
effects were not statistically significant and non-parametric bootstrapping 
demonstrated considerable uncertainty in these findings. No safety concerns were 
raised and no deaths were reported.
LIMITATIONS: As a pragmatic trial, we had broad inclusion criteria and, 
therefore, there was considerable heterogeneity within the sample. The study was 
not powered to perform further subgroup analyses. Participants and therapists 
could not be blinded to treatment allocation.
CONCLUSIONS: The group memory rehabilitation delivered in this trial is very 
unlikely to lead to clinical benefits or to be a cost-effective treatment for 
people with TBI in the community. Future studies should examine the selection of 
participants who may benefit most from memory rehabilitation.

Plain Language Summary: People with brain injuries often report memory problems. 
These difficulties can continue long after the injury, causing complications in 
daily life. Many people do not receive specific help for these memory problems 
after leaving hospital. Our study explored whether receiving ‘memory 
rehabilitation’ (a group treatment to help people deal with memory difficulties) 
was better than the treatment that people usually receive to help reduce the 
frequency of forgetting in daily life. We recruited 328 people who had memory 
problems following brain injury. About half were allocated at random to receive 
memory rehabilitation and half did not have any extra memory treatments, but 
everyone continued to receive their usual care. Those who had memory 
rehabilitation were offered 10 group sessions at which strategies were taught to 
help them cope with memory problems. We asked all participants to complete 
memory tests and questionnaires at the start of the study and again 6 and 12 
months afterwards to find out whether the memory rehabilitation had any effect. 
Some participants were also interviewed about the study. At the 6- and 12-month 
assessments, there were no differences between those who received memory 
rehabilitation and those who did not in terms of how often participants reported 
memory problems in their daily lives or how well they performed on memory tests. 
We also did not find any differences in participants’ mood or quality of life. 
However, individual goals set by the participants at the start of the study were 
a little better met by those who received memory rehabilitation than by those 
who did not. The memory rehabilitation did not represent value for money. In 
interviews, participants reported positive experiences of taking part in the 
study and of attending the group sessions. This group memory rehabilitation 
programme is unlikely to help people with memory problems following a brain 
injury more than the usual treatment that people receive. Some people may 
benefit more from memory rehabilitation than others, but this needs further 
investigation.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a low-load resistance training program 
associated with partial blood-flow restriction in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Forty-eight women with RA were randomized into 1 of 3 groups: high-load 
resistance training (HL-RT; 70% 1 repetition maximum [1RM]), low-load resistance 
training (30% 1RM) with partial blood-flow restriction training (BFRT), and a 
control group. Patients completed a 12-week supervised training program and were 
assessed for lower-extremity 1RM, quadriceps cross-sectional area (CSA), 
physical function (timed-stands test [TST], timed-up-and-go test [TUG], and 
Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]), and quality of life (Short Form 36 
health survey [SF-36]) at baseline and after the intervention.
RESULTS: BFRT and HL-RT were similarly effective in increasing maximum dynamic 
strength in both leg press (22.8% and 24.2%, respectively; P < 0.0001 for all) 
and knee extension (19.7% and 23.8%, respectively; P < 0.0001 for all). 
Quadriceps CSA was also significantly increased in both BFRT and HL-RT (9.5% and 
10.8%, respectively; P < 0.0001 for all). Comparable improvements in TST (11.2% 
and 14.7%; P < 0.0001 for all) and TUG (-6.8% [P < 0.0053] and -8.7% [P < 
0.0001]) were also observed in BFRT and HL-RT, respectively. Improvements in 
both groups were significantly greater than those of the control group (P < 0.05 
for all). SF-36 role physical and bodily pain and HAQ scores were improved only 
in BFRT (45.7%, 22.5%, and -55.9%, respectively; P < 0.05 for all). HL-RT 
resulted in 1 case of withdrawal and several cases of exercise-induced pain, 
which did not occur in BFRT.
CONCLUSION: BFRT was effective in improving muscle strength, mass, function, and 
health-related quality of life in patients with RA, emerging as a viable 
therapeutic modality in RA management.

Out-of-field scattered and transmitted extrafocal radiation may induce secondary 
cancer in long-term survivors of external radiotherapy. Pediatric patients have 
higher life expectancy and tend to receive higher secondary radiation damage due 
to geometric and biological factors. The goal of this study is to characterize 
the location and the magnitude of extrafocal dose regions in the case of 
three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and volumetric arc therapy, to apply 
this information to clinical treatment cases, and to provide mitigation 
strategies. Extrafocal dose has been investigated in a Varian TrueBeam linac 
equipped with a high-definition 120 multileaf collimator using different 
physical and virtual phantoms, dose calculation (including Monte Carlo 
techniques), and dose measurement methods. All Monte Carlo calculations showed 
excellent agreement with measurements. Treatment planning system calculations 
failed to provide reliable results out of the treatment field. Both Monte Carlo 
calculations and dose measurements showed regions with higher dose (extrafocal 
dose areas) when compared to the background. These areas start to be noticeable 
beyond 11 cm from the isocenter in the direction perpendicular to the multileaf 
collimator leaves' travel direction. Out-of-field extrafocal doses up to 160% of 
the mean dose transmitted through the closed multileaf collimator were 
registered. Two overlapping components were observed in the extrafocal 
distribution: the first is an almost elliptical blurred dose distribution, and 
the second is a well-defined rectangular dose distribution. Extra precautions 
should be taken into consideration when treating pediatric patients with a 
high-definition 120 multileaf collimator to avoid directing the extrafocal 
radiation into a radiosensitive organ during external beam therapy.

IMPORTANCE: Understanding causes and correlates of health loss among children 
and adolescents can identify areas of success, stagnation, and emerging threats 
and thereby facilitate effective improvement strategies.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate mortality and morbidity in children and adolescents from 
1990 to 2017 by age and sex in 195 countries and territories.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study examined levels, trends, and 
spatiotemporal patterns of cause-specific mortality and nonfatal health outcomes 
using standardized approaches to data processing and statistical analysis. It 
also describes epidemiologic transitions by evaluating historical associations 
between disease indicators and the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), a composite 
indicator of income, educational attainment, and fertility. Data collected from 
1990 to 2017 on children and adolescents from birth through 19 years of age in 
195 countries and territories were assessed. Data analysis occurred from January 
2018 to August 2018.
EXPOSURES: Being under the age of 20 years between 1990 and 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Death and disability. All-cause and cause-specific 
deaths, disability-adjusted life years, years of life lost, and years of life 
lived with disability.
RESULTS: Child and adolescent deaths decreased 51.7% from 13.77 million (95% 
uncertainty interval [UI], 13.60-13.93 million) in 1990 to 6.64 million (95% UI, 
6.44-6.87 million) in 2017, but in 2017, aggregate disability increased 4.7% to 
a total of 145 million (95% UI, 107-190 million) years lived with disability 
globally. Progress was uneven, and inequity increased, with low-SDI and 
low-middle-SDI locations experiencing 82.2% (95% UI, 81.6%-82.9%) of deaths, up 
from 70.9% (95% UI, 70.4%-71.4%) in 1990. The leading disaggregated causes of 
disability-adjusted life years in 2017 in the low-SDI quintile were neonatal 
disorders, lower respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria, and congenital birth 
defects, whereas neonatal disorders, congenital birth defects, headache, 
dermatitis, and anxiety were highest-ranked in the high-SDI quintile.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mortality reductions over this 27-year period mean 
that children are more likely than ever to reach their 20th birthdays. The 
concomitant expansion of nonfatal health loss and epidemiological transition in 
children and adolescents, especially in low-SDI and middle-SDI countries, has 
the potential to increase already overburdened health systems, will affect the 
human capital potential of societies, and may influence the trajectory of 
socioeconomic development. Continued monitoring of child and adolescent health 
loss is crucial to sustain the progress of the past 27 years.

To objectively assess physical activity levels and sedentary behavior in a 
cohort of Spanish centenarians and their nonagenarian peers. Physical activity 
and sedentary behavior patterns were objectively measured by an ActiGraph GT3X 
accelerometer in centenarians (n = 18; 83% women; 100.8 ± 0.8 [100-103] years) 
and nonagenarians (n = 11; 91% women; 93.3 ± 2.5 [90-98] years). Centenarians 
showed less counts per minute (17.6 ± 7.1 vs. 46.1 ± 23.7, p = .003, d = 1.851) 
and steps per day (455 ± 237 vs. 1,249 ± 776, p = .007, d = 1.587) than 
nonagenarians. The daily number of sedentary breaks was also lower in the former 
(5.0 ± 1.5 vs. 6.7 ± 2.0, p = .019, d = 0.971). When observing time 
distribution, the most active day period in both groups was the morning, with a 
peak between 10:00 and 11:59. This data suggest that the decline in physical 
activity levels continues to worsen until the end of the human lifespan.

Effects of rehabilitation on knee function, activity and health-related quality 
of life after soft-tissue knee injury have been widely studied in clinical 
trials, but there is still a lack of data on the relation between knee muscle 
strength and athlete's perceived performance to identify sports-risk modifiers. 
We performed a prospective observational clinical study of knee muscle strength 
and self-reported health during rehabilitation after unilateral knee soft-tissue 
injury in recreational sports. Forty-three patients performed isokinetic 
dynamometry and filled in the Short form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Oxford 
Knee Score questionnaires before and after 4 months of instructed home 
strengthening program. We observed significant improvement in peak torque 
deficit between two limbs during concentric extension (PTDE) and flexion, 
dynamic control ratio of the involved knee, most of the SF-36 subscales and the 
Oxford Knee Score values (P ≤ 0.001). Dynamic control ratio of the uninvolved 
knee values remained below referential values and unchanged. Improvement of PTDE 
correlated positively with improvement of the bodily pain subscale of SF-36 
score (r = 0.51, P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis 
indicated that reduction of pain by at least nine points predicts at least 10% 
reduction in PTDE, whereby the bodily pain change achieved poor (56%) 
sensitivity and good (86%) specificity as a rehabilitation success measure for 
recreational athletes after knee injury. Primary inferior eccentric strength of 
noninjured knee hamstrings might indicate increased risk of knee injury. 
Diminished perceived pain predicts strength improvement of the injured knee 
extensors with poor sensitivity and good specificity.

We carried out whole genome resequencing of 127 chicken including red jungle 
fowl and multiple populations of commercial broilers and layers to perform a 
systematic screening of adaptive changes in modern chicken (Gallus gallus 
domesticus). We uncovered >21 million high quality SNPs of which 34% are newly 
detected variants. This panel comprises >115,000 predicted amino-acid altering 
substitutions as well as 1,100 SNPs predicted to be stop-gain or -loss, several 
of which reach high frequencies. Signatures of selection were investigated both 
through analyses of fixation and differentiation to reveal selective sweeps that 
may have had prominent roles during domestication and breed development. 
Contrasting wild and domestic chicken we confirmed selection at the BCO2 and 
TSHR loci and identified 34 putative sweeps co-localized with ALX1, KITLG, EPGR, 
IGF1, DLK1, JPT2, CRAMP1, and GLI3, among others. Analysis of enrichment between 
groups of wild vs. commercials and broilers vs. layers revealed a further panel 
of candidate genes including CORIN, SKIV2L2 implicated in pigmentation and LEPR, 
MEGF10 and SPEF2, suggestive of production-oriented selection. SNPs with marked 
allele frequency differences between wild and domestic chicken showed a highly 
significant deficiency in the proportion of amino-acid altering mutations 
(P<2.5×10-6). The results contribute to the understanding of major genetic 
changes that took place during the evolution of modern chickens and in poultry 
breeding.

INTRODUCTION: Multiple studies have demonstrated the benefits of intrapartum 
doula care, including lower risk for cesarean birth and shortened labor time for 
nulliparous women. However, analyses investigating the cost-effectiveness of 
doula care are limited. This study evaluated the potential cost-effectiveness of 
professional doula support during a woman's first birth in a theoretical 
population of US women, with all women having a second birth without doula care.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was designed to compare outcomes in women 
with a professional doula versus no doula labor support. A theoretical cohort of 
1.6 million women, the approximate number of annual low-risk, nulliparous, term, 
singleton births in the United States, was used. Outcomes included mode of 
birth, maternal death, uterine rupture, cesarean hysterectomy, costs, and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probability estimates used in the model 
were derived from the literature, and a cost-effectiveness threshold was set at 
$100,000 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses were used to investigate the robustness 
of the results.
RESULTS: In this theoretical model, professional doula care during the first 
birth resulted in fewer cesarean births and improved QALYs. Additionally, doula 
support resulted in 202,538 fewer cesarean births, 46 fewer maternal deaths 
secondary to fewer cesarean births, 99 fewer uterine ruptures, and 26 fewer 
hysterectomies, with an additional cost of $185 million and 7617 increased QALYs 
for the first and subsequent births. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated a 
professional doula was potentially cost-saving up to $884 and cost-effective up 
to $1360 per doula.
DISCUSSION: Professional doula care during a woman's first birth may lead to 
improved outcomes and increased QALYs during her first and second births. Given 
the limitations of this analysis, the cost-effectiveness estimate is likely 
conservative, further supporting broader integration of professional doulas into 
the US maternity care system and highlighting the need for higher doula care 
reimbursement.

Oral semaglutide, which has undergone multiple phase 3 clinical trials, 
represents the first oral biologic medication for type 2 diabetes in the form of 
a daily capsule. It provides similar efficacy compared with its weekly injection 
counterpart, but it demands a dose on the order of 100 times as high and 
requires more frequent administration. We perform a cost effectiveness analysis 
using a first and second order Monte Carlo simulation to estimate 
quality-adjusted life expectancies associated with an oral daily capsule, oral 
weekly capsule, daily injection, and weekly injection of semaglutide. We 
conclude that the additional costs incurred to produce extra semaglutide for the 
oral formulation are cost effective, given the greater quality of life 
experienced when taking a capsule over a weekly injection. We also demonstrate 
that the potency of semaglutide allows the formulation to be cost effective, and 
less potent drugs will require increased oral bioavailability to make a cost 
effective oral formulation.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the burden of disease attributable to obesity and 
overweight conditions using disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in Colombia.
METHODS: The burden of disease was estimated following an adapted methodology 
published by the World Health Organization. A selection of diseases was 
performed in which overweight and obesity are risk factors. DALYs were 
calculated by obtaining the proportion of cases and deaths of every disease that 
can be attributable to obesity and overweight conditions. The economic impact of 
obesity was calculated by multiplying the cost of care per patient for each 
comorbidity by the number of cases attributable exclusively to obesity.
RESULTS: A total of 997 371 DALYs were estimated, 45% of which corresponded to 
men; 81% of DALYs corresponded to years lived with disability. Conditions with 
greater attributable DALYs are, in order, hypertension (31.6% of the total 
DALYs), type 2 diabetes mellitus (28.0%), cardiac ischemic disease (14.6%), and 
lower back pain (11.2%). An estimation of 20.5 DALYs per 1000 inhabitants was 
made. The economic impact of care for comorbidities associated with obesity 
could amount to $2158 million.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and overweight conditions are related to higher mortality 
and disability than previously estimated; effective interventions aimed at 
prevention and treatment will have a high impact on quality of life.

Urinary Tract and Gynecologic Malignancies.

[Article in English]

Špaček J Jr, Petera J, Broďák M, Práznovec I, Špaček J.

BACKGROUND: The close anatomical relationship of the urogenital system is a 
significant, and sometimes limiting, factor in oncogynecology. Reducing adverse 
effects (treatment-associated toxicity) is an integral part of cancer treatment. 
Radical surgery, as well as oncological therapy, which represent milestones in 
the treatment of such malignancies, may require tailoring the extension of the 
intervention in order to preserve other non-gynecological structures. Despite 
the progress in minimally invasive surgery, and evolution of radiotherapy and 
systemic therapy, treatment-related complications remain; indeed, their 
increasing prevalence in women raises questions about quality of life.
AIM: Here, we highlight the modalities used to treat gynecological cancer and 
discuss the most common urological adverse effects related to these 
interventions. Knowledge of side effects, as well as methods of prevention, is 
fundamental if we are to preserve quality of life.
CONCLUSION: reatment of gynecological cancer is based on cooperation between 
members of the multidisciplinary team. From this point-of-view, combination of 
two radical modalities (mainly surgery and radiotherapy) remains problematic. 
However, the patients prognosis, and plans for other possible oncological 
therapies, play an essential role in management of urological adverse effects 
related to cancer treatment. Key words: gynecologic neoplasms - complication - 
urinary tract - quality of life This work was supported by project PROGES Q40.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that unemployment has negative impacts 
on various aspects of health. However, little is known about the effect of 
unemployment on health-related quality of life. Our aim was to examine how 
unemployment impacts upon health-related quality of life among Swedish adults, 
and to investigate these effects on population subgroups defined by education 
level, marital status, previous health, and gender.
METHODS: As part of a cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was sent to 2500 
randomly selected individuals aged 20 to 64 years living in Sweden in 2016. The 
questionnaire included the EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) instrument and was 
answered by 967 individuals (39%). Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) scores were 
derived from the EQ-5D responses. Of the respondents, 113 were unemployed and 
724 were employed. We used inverse probability-weighted propensity scores in our 
analyses to estimate a risk difference. Gender, age, education level, marital 
status, and previous health were used as covariates in our analyses.
RESULTS: There was a statistically significant lower QALY score by 0.096 points 
for the unemployed compared to the employed. There were also statistically 
significant more problems due to unemployment for usual activities (6.6% more), 
anxiety/depression (23.6% more), and EQ-5D's Visual Analogue Scale (7.5 point 
lower score). Grouped analyses indicated a larger negative health effect from 
becoming unemployed for men, those who are married, and young individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we show that the health deterioration from 
unemployment is likely to be large, as our estimated effect implies an almost 
10% worse health (in absolute terms) from being unemployed compared to being
