INTRODUCTION: Given the rapid increase in novel treatments for patients with 
multiple myeloma (MM), this patient preference study aimed to establish which 
treatment attributes matter most to MM patients and evaluate discrete choice 
experiment (DCE) and swing weighting (SW) as two elicitation methods for 
quantifying patients' preferences.
METHODS: A survey incorporating DCE and SW was disseminated among European MM 
patients. The survey included attributes and levels informed by a previous 
qualitative study with 24 MM patients. Latent class and mixed logit models were 
used to estimate the DCE attribute weights and descriptive analyses were 
performed to derive SW weights. MM patients and patient organisations provided 
extensive feedback during survey development.
RESULTS: 393 MM patients across 21 countries completed the survey (M years since 
diagnosis=6; M previous therapies=3). Significant differences (p<.01) between 
participants' attribute weights were revealed depending on participants' prior 
therapy experience, and their experience with side-effects and symptoms. 
Multivariate analyses showed that participants across the three MM patient 
classes identified via the latent class model differed regarding their past 
number of therapies (F=4.772, p=.009). Patients with the most treatments (class 
1) and those with the least treatments (class 3) attached more value to life 
expectancy versus quality of life-related attributes such as pain, mobility and 
thinking problems. Conversely, patients with intermediary treatment experience 
(class 2) attached more value to quality of life-related attributes versus life 
expectancy. Participants highlighted the difficulty of trading-off between life 
expectancy and quality of life and between physical and mental health. 
Participants expressed a need for greater psychological support to cope with 
their symptoms, treatment side-effects, and uncertainties. With respect to 
patients' preferences for the DCE or SW questions, 42% had no preference, 32% 
preferred DCE, and 25% preferred SW.
CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life-related attributes affecting MM patients' physical, 
mental and psychological health such as pain, mobility and thinking problems 
were considered very important to MM patients, next to life expectancy. This 
underscores a need to include such attributes in decision-making by healthcare 
stakeholders involved in MM drug development, evidence generation, evaluation, 
and clinical practice. This study highlights DCE as the preferred methodology 
for understanding relative attribute weights from a patient's perspective.

Several previous lines of research have suggested, indirectly, that mouse 
lifespan is particularly susceptible to endocrine or nutritional signals in the 
first few weeks of life, as tested by manipulations of litter size, growth 
hormone levels, or mutations with effects specifically on early-life growth 
rate. The pace of early development in mice can also be influenced by exposure 
of nursing and weanling mice to olfactory cues. In particular, odors of same-sex 
adult mice can in some circumstances delay maturation. We hypothesized that 
olfactory information might also have a sex-specific effect on lifespan, and we 
show here that the lifespan of female mice can be increased significantly by 
odors from adult females administered transiently, that is from 3 days until 60 
days of age. Female lifespan was not modified by male odors, nor was male 
lifespan susceptible to odors from adults of either sex. Conditional deletion of 
the G protein Gαo in the olfactory system, which leads to impaired accessory 
olfactory system function and blunted reproductive priming responses to male 
odors in females, did not modify the effect of female odors on female lifespan. 
Our data provide support for the idea that very young mice are susceptible to 
influences that can have long-lasting effects on health maintenance in later 
life, and provide a potential example of lifespan extension by olfactory cues in 
mice.

Plain Language Summary: The environment that animals are exposed to early in 
life can influence their subsequent rate of development, reproduction and aging. 
Experiments done in rodents have shown that social stimuli such as odours from 
the same sex or opposite sex individuals can affect the age at which sexual 
maturity is reached. Variations in age of sexual maturity are directly 
correlated with median lifespans of mice, with strong associations observed 
between later sexual maturity and longer lifespans in female mice. Detailed 
experiments exposing female or male mice to scents from mice of the same or 
another sex strongly suggest that growing up smelling the same sex can delay 
sexual maturity, while scents from another sex can hasten it. Interestingly, 
mice that lacked the cells that sense odours do not change their age of sexual 
maturity in response to scents from the opposite sex. This ability to steer 
one’s developmental timeline depending on environmental cues may allow animals 
to prepare for future environments. But can it also influence an animal’s 
lifespan? To answer this question, Garratt et al. observed the lifespans of 
female and male mice under different conditions. Mice were exposed to same-sex 
or other-sex odours, in the form of urine or soiled bedding, from day 3 to day 
60 of their lives. The results showed that female mice exposed to odours from 
other females exhibited an increased lifespan, as compared to those not exposed 
to scents, while those exposed to odours from males did not show any change in 
their lifespan. In striking contrast, male mice exposed to odours from either 
sex showed no variation in their lifespans. The impairment of a particular type 
of odour-sensing neuron in mice did not change these results, making it likely 
that another neuron type is responsible for the changes in lifespan observed in 
the female mice. These experiments elegantly demonstrate that exposure to 
certain sensory information, in this case scent, can change how long mammals 
live. While similar effects involving smells are unlikely to influence lifespan 
in humans, it is possible that other types of sensory information affect our 
health and how we age.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are considered part of an environmentally 
friendly technology leading to more timely and cost-effective production and 
management of farms. Despite the potential of WSNs to agricultural development 
in the global South, outreach is still very limited, also in Iran. Therefore, in 
order to facilitate the adoption of WSNs, it is necessary to identify the 
factors influencing and challenging the adoption of this technology. This 
exploratory study uses a qualitative approach to identify the main barriers WSN 
outreach is facing. In the results, we distinguish facts that we define as 
issues or barriers that were identified by others from fears that are not 
supported by evidence so far, at the level of the farmers, the government actors 
as well as the technology itself. Facts include communication barriers such as 
internet access, farmers' knowledge levels and rigidity to change as well as the 
government's top-down organisation of the extension programme and support 
levels. Fears are mainly expressed on the technology itself and relate to costs, 
a lack of access, the complexity of use and reliability of the data. We provide 
a nuanced view of how fears need to be acknowledged and facts are to be tackled.

There is an alarmingly high growth in breast and cervical cancers in low- and 
middle-income countries. Due to late presentation to doctors, there is a lower 
cure rate. The screening programmes in low- and middle-income countries are not 
comprehensive. In this paper, we systematically analyse the barriers to 
screening through an accessibility framework. We performed a systematic 
literature search in PubMed, Mendeley and Google Scholar to retrieve all English 
language studies (quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods) that contained 
information on breast and cervical cancer screening in low- and middle-income 
countries. We only considered publications published between 1 January 2016 and 
31 May 2021. The review was guided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses literature search extension (PRISMA-S), an extension 
to the PRISMA Statement for Reporting Literature Searches in Systematic Reviews. 
The search yielded a total of 67 articles from low- and middle-income countries 
in this review. We used a framework on accessibility known as the 5A framework, 
which distinguishes five aspects of access: approachability, acceptability, 
availability, affordability and appropriateness, to classify the screening 
barriers. We added two more aspects: awareness and angst, as they could explain 
other important barriers to screening. They confirmed how the lack of awareness, 
cost of the screening service and distance to the screening centre act as major 
impediments to screening. They also revealed how embarrassment and fear of 
screening and cultural factors such as lack of spousal or family support could 
be obstacles to screening. We conclude that more needs to be done by 
policymakers and governments to improve the confidence of the people in the 
health systems. Women should be made aware of the causes and risk factors of 
cancer through evidence-based strategies so that there is an increased adherence 
to screening.

BACKGROUND: The DONATE HCV trial demonstrated the safety and efficacy of 
transplanting hearts from hepatitis C viremic (HCV+) donors. In this report, we 
examine the cost-effectiveness and impact of universal HCV+ heart donor 
eligibility in the United States on transplant waitlist time and life 
expectancy.
METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model to compare 2 waitlist strategies 
for heart transplant candidates in 2018: (1) status quo (SQ) and (2) SQ plus 
HCV+ donors (SQ + HCV). From the DONATE HCV trial and published national 
datasets, we modeled mean age (53 years), male sex (75%), probabilities of 
waitlist mortality (0.01-0.10/month) and transplant (0.03-0.21/month) stratified 
by medical urgency, and posttransplant mortality (0.003-0.052/month). We assumed 
a 23% increase in transplant volume with SQ + HCV compared with SQ. Costs (2018 
United States dollar) included waitlist care ($2200-190 000/month), transplant 
($213 400), 4-wk HCV treatment ($26 000), and posttransplant care ($2500-11 
300/month). We projected waitlist time, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs [$/QALY, 
discounted 3%/year]; threshold ≤$100 000/QALY).
RESULTS: Compared with SQ, SQ + HCV decreased waitlist time from 8.7 to 6.7 
months, increased undiscounted life expectancy from 8.9 to 9.2 QALYs, and 
increased discounted lifetime costs from $671 400/person to $690 000/person. 
Four-week HCV treatment comprised 0.5% of lifetime costs. The ICER of SQ + HCV 
compared with SQ was $74 100/QALY and remained ≤$100 000/QALY with up to 30% 
increases in transplant and posttransplant costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Transplanting hearts from HCV-infected donors could decrease 
waitlist times, increase life expectancy, and be cost-effective. These findings 
were robust within the context of current high HCV treatment costs.

Healthspan extension, completeness of life and justice.

Recent progress in geroscience holds the promise of significantly slowing down 
or even reversing ageing and age-related diseases, and thus increasing our 
healthspans. In this paper, I offer a novel argument in favour of developing 
such technology and making it unconditionally available to everyone. In 
particular, I argue that justice requires that each person be provided with 
sufficient opportunities to have a 'complete life', that many people currently 
lack such opportunities, and that we would substantially improve the status quo 
by giving them access to anti-ageing technology.

With the increasing population of the world food demand is also increasing but 
unfortunately, many countries in the world are lacking suitable and economical 
postharvest preservation techniques to minimize increasing postharvest losses. 
To ensure food security advanced production technologies, distribution systems 
and minimum losses should be ensured to give accessibility of food to all 
population groups. Innovative preservation techniques should be adopted by the 
agriculture sector to meet intercontinental distribution and demand for fresh 
produce. The application of the edible coating is a novel technique in 
postharvest preservation due to its simple application, ecofriendly nature, and 
effectiveness. Edible coatings can also improve the quality and safety aspects 
of fresh produce and thus extends shelf life. This review aimed to update 
information about recent advances in edible coating formulation and application 
mainly on fresh-cut /minimally processed fruits and vegetables. This information 
will be helpful for processors to select the best coating material and its 
effective concentration for different fresh and minimal processed vegetables.

INTRODUCTION: Chile presents a context of an aging population and increased life 
expectancy, leading to many older adults (OA) needing palliative care (PC) 
during the course of their illness. The SPICT-ES™ is an instrument used to 
clinically evaluate patients with advanced chronic illness (ACI) to detect PC 
needs. Validating this instrument in Chile will allow for early detection of OA 
at risk of clinical deterioration who require this care.
OBJECTIVE: Adapt and validate the SPICT-ES™ instrument to identify PC needs 
among OA in Chile.
METHODOLOGY: Study following quantitative design - cross-sectional, descriptive, 
and developed in three stages: cultural adaptation by expert judgment; 
preliminary test of the SPICT-ESCH instrument to evaluate reliability and 
application of the SPICT-ESCH in 292 patients, to determine internal consistency 
and stability of the instrument. This study was done between January 2019 and 
July 2021. Participants in the study were nurses and OA from 5 health centers in 
Santiago, Chile. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Universidad 
de los Andes.
RESULTS: In the cultural adaptation with content validity, following expert 
judgment, all items were kept. Semantic modifications were made on only three of 
them. A Lawshe coefficient of 84% which determined SPICT-ESCH as an acceptable 
instrument for the following stages of validation and reliability. The pilot for 
the new version in Chile, SPICT-ESCH, determined stability and consistency over 
time, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (ρ) of 0.9167 (p < 0.0001). In the 
final application of the instrument, to fortify the psychometric evaluation 
(n = 292) we identified 53.4% positive SPICT-ESCH. The logistical model via OR 
(< 0.001) showed that the items predicted the positivity of the instrument. The 
internal consistency obtained was 0.8662, confirming a correlation and 
intercorrelation between items. 100% of nurses evaluated the SPICT-ESCH as a 
useful and feasible instrument.
CONCLUSION: SPICT-ESCH includes all the relevant indicators for adequate 
clinical identification of PC needs among the Chilean OA population, who could 
Benefit from the early introduction of palliative support contributing to their 
quality of life.

INTRODUCTION: No information is available in Belgium on life expectancy adjusted 
for health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Quality-adjusted life expectancy 
(QALE) captures the multidimensionality of health by accounting for losses in 
mortality and HRQoL linked to physical, mental, and social impairments. The 
objective of this study is to estimate for Belgium QALE, the changes in QALE 
between 2013 and 2018 and the contribution of mortality, HRQoL and its 
dimensions to this trend.
METHODS: The Belgian Health Interview Survey (BHIS), a representative sample of 
the general population, included the EQ-5D-5L instrument in 2013 and 2018. The 
tool assesses HRQoL comprising five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) using a 5-level severity 
scoring to define a large variety of health states. The Sullivan method was used 
to compute at different ages QALE by gender using mortality data from the 
Belgian statistical office and average EQ-5D scores from the BHIS. QALE was 
calculated for 2013 and 2018, and changes in QALE over time were decomposed into 
mortality and ill-health effect.
RESULTS: In 2018, QALE at age 15 years (QALE15) was 56.3 years for women and 
55.8 years for men, a decrease from 2013 by 0.7 year for women and a stagnation 
for men. In men, the decrease in mortality counterbalanced the decline in HRQoL. 
The decline in QALE in women is driven by a decrease in mortality rates that is 
too small to compensate for the substantial decline in HRQoL before the age of 
50 years. In women at older ages, improvements in HRQoL are observed. In women, 
QALE15 is decreasing due to an increase in pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression 
and problems in usual activities. In men at age 15, the pain/discomfort and 
anxiety/depression domains contributed to the stagnation. QALE65 increased 
somewhat, due to an improvement in self-care and mobility for both genders, and 
usual activities and anxiety/depression in men only.
CONCLUSION: The strength of QALE as member of the family of composite 
indicators, the health expectancies, is the multidimensional structure of the 
underlying health component, including both ill-health with different health 
domains as levels of severity. The ability to decompose differences in the 
health expectancy not only into a mortality and health component but also into 
the different health dimensions allows to better inform on general population 
health trends. Next, compared to other health expectancy indicators, QALE is 
more sensitive to changes at younger ages.

OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have not fully reported the strength and 
independency of the correlation of nursing workforce to life expectancy. This 
study advances that nursing workforce is a major independent contributor to life 
expectancy at birth (LEB) globally and regionally.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted at population level.
SAMPLE: Ecological data were extracted from the United Nations agencies for 215 
populations. Each population is considered a research subject.
MEASUREMENTS: The correlation between nursing workforce and LEB was analyzed 
with scatter plots, bivariate correlation, partial correlation, and multiple 
linear regression analyses, Analysis of Variance post hoc and independent 
T-test. Economic affluence, urban lifestyle and obesity were included as the 
potential confounders in this study.
INTERVENTION: Not applicable RESULTS: Nursing workforce correlated to LEB and 
this relationship remained regardless of the competition of economic affluence, 
urbanization, and obesity. Second to economic affluence, nursing workforce 
showed the greatest influence on LEB. In total, 64.50% of LEB was explained in 
this study. Nursing workforce was a determinant of regional variations of LEB.
CONCLUSIONS: Nursing workforce may be a significant contributor to LEB globally 
and regionally. This contribution was independent of the potential confounding 
effects of economic affluence, urbanization, and obesity.

Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province 671000, P. R. China.

BACKGROUND: There is an overall decreasing trend in stroke incidence and an 
increasing trend in its prevalence. Disease burden of stroke continues to 
increase with an increase in the absolute number. In-depth analysis of stroke 
burden trends in remote areas is extremely important. Our aim was to describe 
the disease burden of and risk factors for stroke in Yunnan, from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: The methodological framework and analytical strategies adopted in the 
2017 Global Burden of Disease study were used.
RESULTS: Age-standardized mortality associated with stroke decreased from 1.53 
per 100 000 in 1990 to 1.14 per 100 000 in 2017. The prevalence of stroke in 
Yunnan Province increased from 344 per 100 000 in 1990 to 870 per 100 000 in 
2017. The age-standardized rates of years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with 
disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) decreased more 
significantly for women than for men. The age-standardized rates of DALYs and 
YLLs of stroke decreased by 24.3 and 28.4%, respectively, from 1990 to 2017, and 
the rate of YLDs increased by 32.5%. The top three risk factors for stroke were 
dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure and tobacco consumption, and their 
percentage contributions to the DALYs of stroke were 67.5, 51.5 and 29.1%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of stroke has increased in Yunnan since 1990. The health 
department should emphasize on the changes of stroke risk factors and advocate 
healthy diet and living habits for residents.

The accurate annotation of transcription start sites (TSSs) and their usage are 
critical for the mechanistic understanding of gene regulation in different 
biological contexts. To fulfill this, specific high-throughput experimental 
technologies have been developed to capture TSSs in a genome-wide manner, and 
various computational tools have also been developed for in silico prediction of 
TSSs solely based on genomic sequences. Most of these computational tools cast 
the problem as a binary classification task on a balanced dataset, thus 
resulting in drastic false positive predictions when applied on the genome 
scale. Here, we present DeeReCT-TSS, a deep learning-based method that is 
capable of identifying TSSs across the whole genome based on both DNA sequence 
and conventional RNA sequencing data. We show that by effectively incorporating 
these two sources of information, DeeReCT-TSS significantly outperforms other 
solely sequence-based methods on the precise annotation of TSSs used in 
different cell types. Furthermore, we develop a meta-learning-based extension 
for simultaneous TSS annotations on 10 cell types, which enables the 
identification of cell type-specific TSSs. Finally, we demonstrate the high 
precision of DeeReCT-TSS on two independent datasets by correlating our 
predicted TSSs with experimentally defined TSS chromatin states. The source code 
for DeeReCT-TSS is available at 
https://github.com/JoshuaChou2018/DeeReCT-TSS_release and

INTRODUCTION: Pelvic fracture is a severe injury resulting in high mortality and 
disability rate, and brought heavy health burden. However, existing research 
conclusions only restricted to the national level while global estimation of 
pelvic fracture was lack. We aimed to estimate the global incidence, prevalence, 
and years lived with disability (YLDs) of pelvic fracture by region, age, 
gender, cause and sociodemographic index (SDI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Publicly available data was gained based on the Global 
Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019. We calculated the estimated annual percent 
change (EAPC) to analyze the temporal trends of pelvic fractures from 1990 to 
2019. Incidence, prevalence and YLDs were analyzed by region, age, gender, cause 
and SDI. Spearman's rank order correlation was used to determine the correlation 
between SDI and incidence, prevalence and YLDs.
RESULTS: Globally, there were about 6 million incident cases, 18.8 million 
prevalent cases and 3.2 million YLDs cases of pelvic fractures for both sexes in 
2019. The incidence number increased over 40% compared to 1990. However, the age 
standardized rate of incidence (ASIR) (EAPC = -0.22; 95% CI, -0.38 to -0.05), 
prevalence (ASPR) (EAPC = -0.42; 95% CI, -0.51 to -0.32) and YLDs (ASYR) 
(EAPC = -0.41; 95% CI, -0.50 to -0.32) all presented downward trends. Males had 
higher ASIR, ASPR and ASYR than females in each year from 1990 to 2019. The 
incidence, prevalence and YLDs rates were higher in males in early adulthood but 
exceeded in females at older age. A positive correlation was observed between 
ASIR and SDI (rho = 0.3732, p < 0.01). Regions with higher SDI tended to have 
higher ASIR, ASPR and ASYR than lower SDI regions. Falls and road injuries were 
the major causes of pelvic fracture at all ages and during the whole period.
CONCLUSION: The global health burden of pelvic fracture still remained high 
during the past thirty years. More policies and strategies are needed to face 
the challenge brought by population growth and aging.

COVID-19 and the forgone health benefits of elective operations.

Gandjour A(1).

Author information:
(1)Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, Adickesallee 32-34, 60322, 
Frankfurt am Main, Germany. a.gandjour@fs.de.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The first SARS-CoV-2 pandemic wave in Germany involved a 
tradeoff between saving the lives of COVID-19 patients by providing sufficient 
intensive care unit (ICU) capacity and foregoing the health benefits of elective 
procedures. This study aims to quantify this tradeoff.
METHODS: The analysis is conducted at both the individual and population levels. 
The analysis calculates quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to facilitate a 
comparison between the health gains from saving the lives of COVID-19 patients 
in the ICU and the health losses associated with postponing operative 
procedures. The QALYs gained from saving the lives of COVID-19 patients are 
calculated based on both the real-world ICU admissions and deaths averted from 
flattening the first wave. Scenario analysis was used to account for variation 
in input factors.
RESULTS: At the individual level, the resource-adjusted QALY gain of saving one 
COVID-19 life is predicted to be 3 to 15 times larger than the QALY loss of 
deferring one operation (the average multiplier is 9). The real-world QALY gain 
at the population level is estimated to fall within the range of the QALY loss 
due to delayed procedures. The modeled QALY gain by flattening the first wave is 
3 to 31 times larger than the QALY loss due to delayed procedures (the average 
multiplier is 17).
CONCLUSION: During the first wave of the pandemic, the resource-adjusted health 
gain from treating one COVID-19 patient in the ICU was found to be much larger 
than the health loss from deferring one operation. At the population level, 
flattening the first wave led to a much larger health gain than the health loss 
from delaying operative procedures.

BACKGROUND: Low-grade glioma (LGG) is a crucial pathological type of glioma. The 
present study aimed to explore multiple RNA methylation regulator-related AS 
events and investigate their prognostic values in LGG.
METHODS: The prognostic model for low-grade glioma was established using the 
LASSO regression analysis. To validate prognostic value, we performed 
Kaplan-Maier survival analysis, ROC curves and nomograms. The ESTIMATE 
algorithm, the CIBERSORT algorithm and the ssGSEA algorithm were utilized to 
explore the role of the immune microenvironment in LGG. Subsequently, we then 
used GO, KEGG and GSEA enrichment analysis to explore the functional roles of 
these genes. In addition, we employed the GDSC database to screen potential 
chemotherapeutic agents.
RESULTS: Eight RNA methylation related AS events were involved in construct a 
survival and prognosis model, which had good ability of independent prediction 
for patients with LGG. Patients in the high-risk group had shorter life 
expectancy and higher mortality, while patients in the low-risk group had a 
better prognosis. We constructed a nomogram which showed an excellent predictive 
performance for individual OS. The risk score exhibited a close correlation with 
some immune cells and expression of immune checkpoints. Patients in high-risk 
group were characterized by immunosuppressive microenvironment and poor response 
to immunotherapy, and were sensitive to more chemotherapeutic drugs. Pathway and 
functional enrichment analyses further confirmed that significant differences 
existed in immune landscape between the two subgroups.
CONCLUSION: The prognostic RNA methylation-related alternative splicing 
signature constructed could constitute a promising prognostic biomarker, which 
could serve to optimize treatment regimens.

OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the views of public health experts on adverse trends in 
life expectancy across England and Wales over the past decade, causal factors, 
possible solutions, and their opinions about how the prepandemic situation 
influenced the UK's COVID-19 response.
STUDY DESIGN: Semistructured, in-depth interviews.
METHODS: Nineteen public health experts were identified by purposeful sampling 
and invited to take part via e-mail. Sixty-three percent responded and 
participated (n = 12), six females and six males. Interviews took place via 
Microsoft Teams between November 2021 and January 2022. Interviews were 
transcribed and analysed using thematic content analysis.
RESULTS: There was no consensus on the significance of the stalling and, at some 
ages, reversal of previous improvements in life expectancy between 2010 and 
2020. Explanations offered included data misinterpretation, widening health 
inequalities, and disinvestment in public services, as well as some 
disease-specific causes. Those accepting that the decline was concerning linked 
it to social factors and suggested solutions based on increased investment and 
implementing existing evidence on how to reduce health inequalities. These 
interviewees also pointed to the same factors playing a role in the UK's poor 
COVID-19 response, highlighting the need to understand and address these 
underlying issues as part of pandemic preparedness.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no consensus among a group of influential public health 
experts in the UK on the scale, nature, and explanations of recent trends in 
life expectancy. A majority called for implementation of existing evidence on 
reducing inequalities, especially in the wake of COVID-19. However, without 
agreement on what the problem is, action is likely to remain elusive.

BACKGROUND: Medical and surgical treatment for musculoskeletal sarcoma (MSS) 
place survivors at risk for impairments in muscle properties including muscle 
strength, muscle size, and neuromuscular activation. The purpose of this study 
was to explore muscle properties, gross motor performance, and quality of life 
(QoL) and the changes in response to a 6-week functional strengthening 
intervention (PT-STRONG) in MSS survivors of childhood cancer (CCS).
METHODS: Eight lower extremity MSS CCS (13-23 years old) performed baseline 
testing and three completed PT-STRONG. Participants completed measurements of 
knee extension strength using handheld dynamometry, vastus lateralis (VL) and 
rectus femoris (RF) muscle thickness using ultrasonography at rest, and 
neuromuscular activation using electromyography during strength testing and a 
step-up task. Participants also completed gross motor and QoL assessments.
RESULTS: Compared with the non-surgical limb, MSS CCS had lower surgical limb 
knee extension strength, VL muscle thickness, and RF step-up muscle rate of 
activation (RoA). Compared with normative values, MSS CCS had decreased 
bilateral knee extension strength, gross motor performance, and physical QoL. 
Positive correlations among muscle strength, muscle thickness, and gross motor 
performance were identified. After PT-STRONG, MSS CCS had improvements in VL 
muscle thickness, VL and RF RoA duing step-up, gross motor performance, and 
physical QoL.
CONCLUSIONS: Positive association between larger muscle thickness with greater 
knee extension strength, and higher knee extension strength with better gross 
motor performance indicate that comprehensive physical therapy assessment and 
interventions that identify and target impairments in muscle properties to guide 
clinical decision making should be considered for MSS CCS into survivorship.

OBJECTIVES: Nadofaragene firadenovec is a gene therapy for bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) 
undergoing Food and Drug Administration review. Pembrolizumab is approved for 
treating patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ (CIS). We 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of these treatments compared with a 
hypothetical therapeutic alternative, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$150 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, in CIS and non-CIS 
BCG-unresponsive NMIBC populations.
METHODS: We developed a Markov cohort simulation model with a 3-month cycle 
length and lifetime horizon to estimate the total costs, QALYs, and cost per 
additional QALY from the health sector perspective. Clinical inputs were 
informed by results of single-arm clinical trials evaluating the treatments, and 
systematic literature reviews were conducted to obtain other model inputs. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty in model results.
RESULTS: Nadofaragene firadenovec, at a placeholder price 10% higher than the 
price of pembrolizumab, had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $263 000 
and $145 000 per QALY gained in CIS and non-CIS populations, respectively. 
Pembrolizumab had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $168 000 per QALY 
gained for CIS. A 5.4% reduction in pembrolizumab's price would make it 
cost-effective. The model was sensitive to many inputs, especially to the 
probabilities of disease progression, initial treatment response and durability,
