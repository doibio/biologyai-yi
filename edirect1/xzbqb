current observed access resulted in cumulative savings of $25·1 million compared 
with the 75% access scenario and $65·5 million compared with the 50% access 
scenario.
INTERPRETATION: ART scale-up in British Columbia has decreased HIV-related 
morbidity, mortality, and transmission. Resulting incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios for actual practice, derived within a limited timeframe, were within 
established cost-effectiveness thresholds and were cost saving from a societal 
perspective.

BACKGROUND: Healthy obese individuals may be protected against adverse health 
outcomes. Diet and race might influence healthy obesity, but data on their roles 
and interactions on the phenotype are limited.
OBJECTIVE: We compared the food intake of metabolically healthy obese men to 
those of other weight status-metabolic health phenotypes.
METHODS: Men (n = 4855) aged ≥ 45 y with BMI ≥ 18.5 kg/m(2) and free of 
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer were evaluated in a 
cross-sectional study of the REGARDS (REasons for Geographic And Racial 
Differences in Stroke) study cohort. Food intake was assessed with the use of a 
food frequency questionnaire. Weight status-metabolic health phenotypes were 
defined by using metabolic syndrome (MetS) and homeostasis model assessment of 
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) criteria. Mean differences in food intake among 
weight status-metabolic health phenotypes were compared with the use of linear 
regression.
RESULTS: MetS-defined healthy obesity was present in 44% of white obese men and 
58% of black obese men; the healthy obese phenotype, based on HOMA-IR, was 
equally prevalent in both white (20%) and black (21%) obese men. Among white 
men, MetS-defined healthy and unhealthy obesity were associated with lower 
wholegrain bread intake and higher consumption of red meat (P < 0.001), whereas 
HOMA-IR-defined healthy and unhealthy obesity were associated with lower red 
meat intake (P < 0.0001) compared with healthy normal weight in 
multivariable-adjusted analyses that adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, 
and clinical confounders. However, results were attenuated and became 
nonsignificant after further adjustment for BMI. Healthy and unhealthy 
overweight, defined by both criteria, were associated with lower whole grain 
bread intake (P < 0.001) in all models. Among black men, weight status-metabolic 
health phenotypes were not associated with food intake in all models.
CONCLUSION: Healthy obesity in men is not associated with a healthier diet. 
Future studies need to consider dietary patterns, which may better inform the 
holistic effect of diet on healthy obesity, in prospective analyses.

BACKGROUND: Combination antiretroviral therapy has substantially increased 
life-expectancy in people living with HIV, but the effects of chronic infection 
on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are unclear. We aimed to compare HRQoL 
in people with HIV and the general population.
METHODS: We merged two UK cross-sectional surveys: the ASTRA study, which 
recruited participants aged 18 years or older with HIV from eight outpatient 
clinics in the UK between Feb 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2012; and the Health Survey 
for England (HSE) 2011, which measures health and health-related behaviours in 
individuals living in a random sample of private households in England. The 
ASTRA study has data for 3258 people (response rate 64%) and HSE for 8503 people 
aged 18 years or older (response rate 66%). HRQoL was assessed with the Euroqol 
5D questionnaire 3 level (EQ-5D-3L) instrument that measures health on five 
domains, each with three levels. The responses are scored on a scale where a 
value of 1 represents perfect health and a value of 0 represents death, known as 
the utility score. We used multivariable models to compare utility scores 
between the HIV and general population samples with adjustment for several 
sociodemographic factors.
FINDINGS: 3151 (97%) of 3258 of participants in ASTRA and 7424 (87%) of 8503 
participants in HSE had complete EQ-5D-3L data. The EQ-5D-3L utility score was 
lower for people with HIV compared with that in the general population (marginal 
effect in utility score adjusted for age, and sex/sexuality -0·11; 95% CI -0·13 
to -0·10; p < 0·0001). HRQoL was lower for people with HIV for all EQ-5D-3L 
domains, particularly for anxiety/depression. The difference in utility score 
was significant after adjustment for several additional sociodemographic 
variables (ethnic origin, education, having children, and smoking status) and 
was apparent across all CD4 cell count, antiretroviral therapy, and viral load 
strata, but was greatest for those people diagnosed with HIV in earlier calendar 
periods. Reduction in HRQoL with age was not greater in people with HIV than in 
the general population (pinteraction > 0·05).
INTERPRETATION: People living with HIV have significantly lower HRQoL than do 
the general population, despite most HIV positive individuals in this study 
being virologically and immunologically stable. Although this difference could 
in part be due to factors other than HIV, this study provides additional 
evidence of the loss of health that can be avoided through prevention of further 
HIV infections.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by an autoimmune attack on pancreatic beta cells 
that leads to insulin deficiency. The incidence of T1D in Australia has doubled 
over the past 20 years. T1D treatment focuses on physiological insulin 
replacement, aiming for near-normal blood glucose levels. Hypoglycaemia is a 
significant cause of morbidity and mortality in T1D. Optimal T1D management is 
complex, and is enhanced by empowering individuals in all aspects of managing 
diabetes. New technologies, including insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors 
and sensor-augmented pumps, can assist people achieve better glycaemic control 
and reduce the risk of severe hypoglycaemia. Women with T1D can achieve 
significantly better outcomes during pregnancy and for their infants by planning 
for their pregnancy and by intensive glycaemic control. Several trials are 
underway that seek to identify the determinants of autoimmunity and to develop 
therapies that prevent T1D in at-risk individuals. Pancreatic and islet cell 
transplants are proven therapies, but are only offered to individuals with 
diabetes and renal failure (pancreas) or severe hypoglycaemia unawareness (islet 
cell transplants). Although T1D is still associated with considerable premature 
mortality, recent findings show that a significant improvement in life 
expectancy has occurred.

Nowadays clinical therapy witnesses a challenging bacterial resistance limiting 
the available armament of antibiotics. Over the decades strains resistant to all 
antibiotics have been selected while medicinal chemists were not able to develop 
agents capable of destroying them or to prevent their extension. In particular, 
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), representing one of the most 
common human pathogens, have been reported with increased frequency since their 
first identification twenty years ago. The enterobacterial carbapenemases differ 
from the extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) in their ability to hydrolyze 
β-lactams, cephalosporins and most importantly monobactams and carbapenems. They 
are progressively spreading throughout the world, therefore leaving no effective 
β-lactam to cure bacterial infections. Several BLs-carbapenemase Xray structures 
have been determined making these enzymes attractive targets for structure-based 
drug design studies. However, very little has been done so far to powerfully 
address the inhibitor design issues for this emerging type of BLs. Here, we 
focus on the structural basis for molecular recognition and for broad spectrum 
activity of class A carbapenemases: based on available 3-dimensional structural 
information we identify a theoretical pharmacophoric model as a starting point 
for the development of needed carbapenemases inhibitors.

There is growing evidence of a substantial decline in pollinators within Europe 
and North America, most likely caused by multiple factors such as diseases, poor 
nutrition, habitat loss, insecticides, and environmental pollution. Diesel 
exhaust could be a contributing factor to this decline, since we found that 
diesel exhaust rapidly degrades floral volatiles, which honey bees require for 
flower recognition. In this study, we exposed eight of the most common floral 
volatiles to diesel exhaust in order to investigate whether it can affect 
volatile mediated plant-pollinator interaction. Exposure to diesel exhaust 
altered the blend of common flower volatiles significantly: myrcene was 
considerably reduced, β-ocimene became undetectable, and β-caryophyllene was 
transformed into its cis-isomer isocaryophyllene. Proboscis extension response 
(PER) assays showed that the alterations of the blend reduced the ability of 
honey bees to recognize it. The chemically reactive nitrogen oxides fraction of 
diesel exhaust gas was identified as capable of causing degradation of floral 
volatiles.

PURPOSE: Several prognostic indices (PI) have been developed to stratify 
patients with brain metastases in groups with good or bad prognosis. The aim of 
our study was to compare nine prognostic scores for patients with brain 
metastases (BM) of breast cancer receiving radiotherapy.
METHODS: The clinical data of 139 breast cancer patients with BM were collected 
retrospectively. All patients were treated with cerebral radiotherapy or surgery 
followed by radiotherapy between January 2007 and December 2012. The prognostic 
value and accuracy of recursive partitioning analysis (RPA), RPA II, graded 
prognostic assessment (GPA), basic score for BM, Breast-RPA, Breast-GPA, Rades 
Score 2011, Germany Score and Breast Rades Score were assessed.
RESULTS: The median survival after BM diagnosis in our cohort was 14 months. The 
overall 6-month, 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates were 49.6, 37.4, 20.9 and 13.7 
%, respectively. Most of the PI were associated with OS, but univariate analysis 
favored GPA regarding OS. GPA was the most accurate score to identify patients 
with long (longer than 12 months) and Breast-GPA patients with short (<3 months) 
life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: GPA and Breast-GPA seem to be the most useful scores and perform 
better than other PI for breast cancer patients with BM receiving radiotherapy.

BACKGROUND: This article investigates the importance of regional health care 
availability for old age survival. Using German reunification as a natural 
experiment, we show that spatial variation in health care in East Germany 
considerably influenced the convergence of East German life expectancy toward 
West German levels.
METHOD: We apply cause-deleted life tables and continuous mortality 
decomposition for the years 1982-2007 to show how reductions in circulatory 
mortality among the elderly affected the East German catch-up in life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: Improvements in remaining life expectancy at older ages were first seen 
in towns with university hospitals, where state-of-the-art services became 
available first.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the modernization of the health care system 
had a substantial effect on old-age life expectancy and helped to significantly 
reduce circulatory diseases as the main cause of death in East Germany.

Health screening for older people-what are the current recommendations?

Sazlina SG.

The world population of older people is on the rise with improved health 
services. With longevity, older people are at increased risk of chronic 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are also leading causes of death among 
older people. Screening through case finding in primary care would allow early 
identification of NCDs and its risk factors, which could lead to the reduction 
of related complications as well as mortality. However, direct evidence for 
screening older people is lacking and the decision to screen for diseases should 
be made based on comorbidity, functional status and life expectancy, and has to 
be individualised.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease with a life 
expectancy of less than 5 years post diagnosis for most patients. Poor molecular 
characterization of IPF has led to insufficient understanding of the 
pathogenesis of the disease, resulting in lack of effective therapies. In this 
study, we have integrated a label-free LC-MS based approach with systems biology 
to identify signaling pathways and regulatory nodes within protein interaction 
networks that govern phenotypic changes that may lead to IPF. Ingenuity Pathway 
Analysis of proteins modulated in response to bleomycin treatment identified 
PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling as the most significant profibrotic pathways. Similar 
analysis of proteins modulated in response to vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) inhibitor (CBO-P11) treatment identified natural killer cell signaling 
and PTEN signaling as the most significant antifibrotic pathways. 
Mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were identified to be key mediators of pro- and 
antifibrotic response, where bleomycin (BLM) treatment resulted in increased 
expression and VEGF inhibitor treatment attenuated expression of mTOR and ERK. 
Using a BLM mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis and VEGF inhibitor CBO-P11 as a 
therapeutic measure, we identified a comprehensive set of signaling pathways and 
proteins that contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis that can be 
targeted for therapy against this fatal disease.

OBJECTIVE: Cancer risk increases with age, creating a challenge for the Chinese 
health system. To inform public health policy and research, we evaluated the 
cancer burden in elderly Chinese.
METHODS: Based on the published Chinese Cancer Registry Annual Report or related 
literature and the China Population and Employment Statistics Yearbooks, we 
estimated the cancer burden of elderly Chinese, who were representative of the 
Chinese population. We calculated the cancer incidence, cancer-related 
mortality, potential years of life lost (PYLL), and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) in 2005-2011 by age, sex, district (rural, urban), and calendar 
year using national cancer registry, publication, and census data. The relative 
ratios (RRs) were determined between the elderly (≥60 years) and young (<60 
years).
RESULTS: Cancer incidence and related mortality in the elderly were 8.47 and 
13.96 times, respectively, those in the young. The PYLL and DALY rates of the 
elderly were 1.63 and 5.00 times, respectively, those in the young. The PYLL and 
DALY rates for elderly men and rural districts were higher than for elderly 
women and urban districts. The RRs for male sex and rural districts were higher 
than for female sex and urban districts. RRs increased sharply from 2005 to 
2011.
CONCLUSIONS: The cancer burden in elderly Chinese was higher in men and rural 
districts than in women and urban districts, which creates considerable 
challenges for the Chinese health care system. Comprehensive measures for cancer 
prevention and treatment in the elderly are needed.

Elevated blood pressure (BP) as a risk factor accounts for the biggest burden of 
disease worldwide and in China. This study aimed to estimate attributed 
mortality and life expectancy (LE) to elevated BP in Jiangxi province between 
2007 and 2010. BP and mortality data (2007 and 2010 inclusive) were obtained 
from the National Chronic Diseases and Risk Factors Surveillance Survey and 
Disease Surveillance Points system, respectively. Population-attributable 
fraction used in comparative risk assessment of the Global Burden of Disease 
study 2010 were followed to quantify the attributed mortality to elevated BP, 
subsequently life table methods were applied to estimate its effects on LE. 
Uncertainty analysis was conducted to get 95% uncertainty intervals (95% 
uncertainty interval [UI]) for each outcome. There are 35,482 (95% UI: 
31,389-39,928) and 47,842 (42,323-53,837) deaths in Jiangxi province were caused 
by elevated BP in 2007 and 2010, respectively. 2.24 (1.87-2.65) years of LE 
would be gained if all the attributed deaths were eliminated in 2007, and 
increased to 3.04 (2.52-3.48) in 2010. If the mean value of elevated BP in 2010 
was decreased by 5 and 10 mm Hg, 5324 (4710-5991) and 11,422 (10,104-12,853) 
deaths would be avoided, with 0.41 (0.37-0.48) and 0.85 (0.71-1.09) years of LE 
gained, respectively. The deaths attributable to elevated BP in Jiangxi province 
has increased by 35% from 2007 to 2010, with 0.8 years of LE loss, suggesting 
the necessity to take actions to control BP in Chinese population.

PURPOSE: Tapentadol extended release (ER) has demonstrated efficacy and safety 
for the management of moderate to severe, chronic pain in adults. This study 
evaluated the long-term safety and tolerability of tapentadol ER in patients 
with chronic osteoarthritis or low back pain.
METHODS: Patients were enrolled in this 1-year, open-label extension study after 
completing one of two 15-week, placebo-controlled studies of tapentadol ER and 
oxycodone controlled release (CR) for osteoarthritis knee pain (NCT00421928) or 
low back pain (NCT00449176), a 7-week crossover study between tapentadol 
immediate release and tapentadol ER for low back pain (NCT00594516), or a 1-year 
safety study of tapentadol ER and oxycodone CR for osteoarthritis or low back 
pain (NCT00361504). After titrating the drug to an optimal dose, patients 
received tapentadol ER (100-250 mg BID) for up to 1 year (after finishing 
treatment in the preceding studies); patients who were previously treated with 
tapentadol ER in the 1-year safety study received tapentadol ER continuously for 
up to 2 years in total.
FINDINGS: Of the 1,154 patients in the safety population, 82.7% were aged >65 
years and 57.9% were female; 50.1% had mild baseline pain intensity. Mean (SD) 
pain intensity scores (11-point numerical rating scale) were 3.9 (2.38) at 
baseline (end of preceding study) and 3.7 (2.42) at end point, indicating that 
pain relief was maintained during the extension study. Improvements in measures 
of quality of life (eg, EuroQol-5 Dimension and the 36-item Short Form Health 
Survey [SF-36]) health status questionnaires) achieved during the preceding 
studies were maintained during the open-label extension study. Tapentadol ER was 
associated with a safety and tolerability profile comparable to that observed in 
the preceding studies. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events 
(incidence ≥10%; n = 1154) were headache (13.1%), nausea (11.8%), and 
constipation (11.1%). Similar efficacy and tolerability results were shown for 
patients who received up to 2 years of tapentadol ER treatment.
IMPLICATIONS: Pain relief and improvements in quality of life achieved during 
the preceding studies were maintained throughout this extension study, during 
which tapentadol ER was well tolerated for the long-term treatment of chronic 
osteoarthritis or low back pain over up to 2 years of treatment.

BACKGROUND: An understanding of public financial flows to reproductive health 
(RH) at the country level is key to assessing the extent to which they 
correspond to political commitments. This is especially relevant for low-income 
countries facing important challenges in the area of RH. To this end, the 
present study analyzes public expenditure levels and trends with regards to RH 
in Burundi between the years 2010 to 2012, looking specifically at financing 
agents, health providers, and health functions.
METHODS: The analysis was performed using standard RH sub-account methodology. 
Information regarding public expenditures was gathered from national budgets, 
the Burundi Ministry of Public Health information system, and from other 
relevant public institutions.
RESULTS: Public RH expenditures in Burundi accounted for $41.163 million 
international dollars in 2012, which represents an increase of 16 % from 2010. 
In 2012, this sum represented 0.57 % of the national GDP. The share of total 
public health spending allocated to RH increased from 15 % in 2010 to 19 % in 
2012. In terms of public agents involved in RH financing, the Ministry of Public 
Health proved to play the most important role. Half of all public RH spending 
went to primary health care clinics, while more than 70 % of this money was used 
for maternal health; average public RH spending per woman of childbearing age 
stagnated during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: The flow patterns and levels of public funds to RH in Burundi 
suggest that RH funding correctly reflects governmental priorities for the 
period between 2010 and 2012. In a context of general shrinking donor 
commitment, local governments have come to play a key role in ensuring the 
efficient use of available resources and the mobilizing of additional domestic 
funding. A strong and transparent financial tracking system is key to carrying 
out this role and making progress towards the MDG Goals and development beyond 
2015.

The Lag of the Proliferative Aging Clock Underlies the Lifespan-Extending Effect 
of Calorie Restriction.

BACKGROUND: The nature of the life-extending effect of calorie restriction (CR) 
is an unsolved problem in biology since 30 years of the last century. 
Furthermore, many different factors that cause analogous life-extending effect, 
so called CR-mimetic factors, have been found. They increase the lifespan of 
different animal species (repeatedly in invertebrates) and therefore remain in 
the forefront of anti-aging researches. The aims of this paper is to find an 
overarching solution for the nature of CR and all CR-mimetic factors and to 
analyze the consequences following this phenomenon.
METHODS: The analysis of empirical scientific data, which concern aging process 
and boundary areas from the point of view of the bioenergetics theory of aging.
RESULTS: "Anything that affects a living system that slows (accelerates) the 
rate of cell division entails extending (reducing) life duration" is this 
overarching solution. CR is one of such factors that cause a retardation in the 
rate of cell divisions due to the shortage in 'construction materials' necessary 
for doubling cell mass during reduplication. This put a brake on realization of 
the aging program. To draw this conclusion, a new concept of the proliferative 
aging clock based on bioenergetics theory of aging was put forward. This clock 
governs the rate of the aging process via programmed, proliferative dependent 
and stepwise bioenergetics decline.
CONCLUSION: The mechanism of the life-extending effect of CR and CR-mimetic 
factors is not related to that of natural aging, therefore this unable to be the 
basis for elaboration of radical remedy for senescence. However, both the CR and 
some of CR-mimetic factors can undoubtedly lead to human life extension: our 
organism differs from that of the other mammals only slightly. It is the 
wellbeing and vulnerability of such extended life that are under consideration. 
To achieve a healthy and unlimited life it is necessary to reprogram gene 
expression so that cell bioenergetics levels either remain at a previous level 
after cell division, which will stop aging, or else grow, which will result in 
organism rejuvenation.

Reduction in Size and Number of Plantar Verrucae in Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus-Infected Individuals After the Implementation of Highly Active 
Antiretroviral Therapy.

Afesllari E, Miller TJ, Huchital MJ, King CM, Johnston JS, Barbosa P.

BACKGROUND: Implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) 
significantly increased the life expectancy of those living with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Except for prevalence, scientific reports 
regarding clinical manifestations of plantar verrucae in the post-HAART era are 
lacking. The objective of this study was to compare clinical manifestations of 
plantar verrucae between HIV-infected and noninfected individuals and then to 
compare these findings with those observed before the implementation of HAART.
METHODS: Nineteen patients with plantar verrucae (ten with HIV and nine without 
HIV) were examined to determine the size, number, and clinical type of verrucae 
present. The two groups were first compared with each other and then with 
previously collected data from a similar analysis conducted in 1995, before the 
implementation of HAART. Statistical significance was determined using the 
Fisher exact test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the size, number, or 
clinical type of verrucae between HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients. 
Compared with the 1995 data, there was a significant decrease in the number of 
verrucae lesions per individual and a nonsignificant decrease in the average 
size of verrucae in HIV-positive patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Study results indicate that the implementation of HAART has 
impacted the clinical manifestations of plantar verrucae in HIV-positive 
individuals. Further analyses with a larger number of patients are required to 
confirm and substantiate these findings.

BACKGROUND: Due to demographic ageing and increasing life expectancy, a growing 
demand for long-term nursing home care can be expected. Stays in nursing homes 
appear to be more socially determined than hospital stays. We therefore looked 
at the impact of socio-demographic and health care variables on the length of 
the last nursing home stay.
METHODS: Nationwide individual data from nursing homes and hospitals in 
Switzerland were linked with census and mortality records. Gender-specific 
negative binomial regression models were used to analyze N = 35,739 individuals 
with an admission age of at least 65 years and deceased in 2007 or 2008 in a 
nursing home.
RESULTS: Preceding death, men spent on average 790 days and women 1250 days in 
the respective nursing home. Adjusted for preceding hospitalizations, care 
level, cause of death and multimorbidity, a low educational level, living alone 
or being tenant as well as a low care level at the admission time increased the 
risk for longer terminal stays. Conversely, a high educational level, being 
homeowner, being married as well as a high care level at the admission time 
decreased the risk for longer stays.
DISCUSSION: The length of the last nursing home stay before death was not only 
dependent on health-related factors alone, but also substantially depended on 
socio-demographic determinants such as educational level, homeownership or 
marital status. The support of elderly people at the admission time of a 
presumably following nursing home stay should be improved and better evaluated 
in order to reduce unnecessary and undesired long terminal nursing home stays.
CONCLUSIONS: Health policy should aim at diminishing the role of situational, 
non-health-related factors in order to empower people to spend the last years 
before death according to individual needs and preferences.

Maternal Behavior Modifications during Pretense and Their Long-Term Effects on 
Toddlers' Understanding of Pretense.

Nakamichi N(1).

Recent studies indicate the need to investigate the sources of toddlers' 
understanding of another person's pretense. The present study is a cultural and 
longitudinal extension of the work of Lillard and Witherington (2004), who 
claimed that mothers modify their behaviors during pretense and that the some of 
these behavior modifications help their toddlers understand maternal pretense. 
Experiment 1 investigated whether mothers would change their behaviors during 
pretense with a sample of 31 Japanese mother-infant pairs. Experiment 2, with a 
subsample of 20 mother-child pairs who had participated in Experiment 1, 
examined whether the maternal behavior modifications at 18 months predicted 
their toddlers' understanding of pretense at 24 months. The results of 
Experiment 1 indicated that Japanese mothers smiled more frequently, gazed at 
their toddlers longer, used sound effects more frequently, and engaged in more 
frequent snack-related actions in a "pretense condition" than in a "real 
condition." In addition, some of these behaviors were significantly related to 
their toddlers' apparent understanding of pretense. Experiment 2 showed that 
both the frequency of maternal smiles and the number of sound effects in the 
pretense condition at 18 months predicted toddlers' understanding of the 
pretense enacted by a strange adult at 24 months. This research indicates the 
impact of maternal behavior modifications during pretense on the development of 
symbolic thought in the 2nd year of life.

The soft genome.

Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) nematodes transmit small RNAs across 
generations, a process that enables transgenerational regulation of genes. In 
contrast to changes to the DNA sequence, transgenerational transmission of small 
RNA-mediated responses is reversible, and thus enables "soft" or "flexible" 
inheritance of acquired characteristics. Until very recently only introduction 
of foreign genetic material (viruses, transposons, transgenes) was shown to 
directly lead to inheritance of small RNAs. New discoveries however, demonstrate 
that starvation also triggers inheritance of endogenous small RNAs in C.elegans. 
Multiple generations of worms inherit starvation-responsive endogenous small 
RNAs, and starvation also results in heritable extension of the progeny's 
lifespan. In this Commentary paper we explore the intriguing possibility that 
large parts of the genome and many additional traits are similarly subjected to 
heritable small RNA-mediated regulation, and focus on the potential influence of 
transgenerational RNAi on the worm's physiology. While the universal relevance 
of this mechanism remains to be discovered, we will examine how the discoveries 
made in worms already challenge long held dogmas in genetics and evolution.

Study Design Retrospective study. Objective Our objective was to identify 
preoperative prognostic factors associated with survival in patients with spinal 
metastasis from lung carcinoma. Methods A retrospective analysis of 26 patients 
diagnosed with lung carcinoma metastatic to the spinal column was performed to 
determine factors associated with survival. We used 3 months survival as the 
clinical cutoff for whether surgical intervention should be performed. We 
analyzed patients who survived less than 3 months compared with those who 
survived more than 3 months. Demographic, preoperative, operative, and 
postoperative factors including functional scores were collected for analysis. 
Results The median survival for all patients in our study was 3.5 months. We 
found a statistically significant difference between the group that survived 
less than 3 months and the group that survived greater than 3 months in terms of 
extrathoracic metastasis, visceral metastasis, and average postoperative 
modified Rankin score. Conclusion Determining which patients with lung cancer 
spinal metastases will benefit from surgical intervention is often dictated by 
the patient's predicted life expectancy. Factors associated with poorer 
prognosis include age, functional status, visceral metastases, and extrathoracic 
metastases. Although the prognosis for patients with lung cancer spinal 
metastases is poor, some patients may experience long-term benefit from surgical 
intervention.

PURPOSE: To report the methodology and findings of a large scale investigation 
of burden and distribution of refractive error, from a contemporary and 
ethnically diverse study of health and disease in adults, in the UK.
METHODS: U K Biobank, a unique contemporary resource for the study of health and 
disease, recruited more than half a million people aged 40-69 years. A subsample 
of 107,452 subjects undertook an enhanced ophthalmic examination which provided 
autorefraction data (a measure of refractive error). Refractive error status was 
categorised using the mean spherical equivalent refraction measure. Information 
on socio-demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity, educational qualifications 
and accommodation tenure) was reported at the time of recruitment by 
questionnaire and face-to-face interview.
RESULTS: Fifty four percent of participants aged 40-69 years had refractive 
error. Specifically 27% had myopia (4% high myopia), which was more common 
amongst younger people, those of higher socio-economic status, higher 
educational attainment, or of White or Chinese ethnicity. The frequency of 
hypermetropia increased with age (7% at 40-44 years increasing to 46% at 65-69 
years), was higher in women and its severity was associated with ethnicity 
(moderate or high hypermetropia at least 30% less likely in non-White ethnic 
groups compared to White).
CONCLUSIONS: Refractive error is a significant public health issue for the UK 
and this study provides contemporary data on adults for planning services, 
health economic modelling and monitoring of secular trends. Further 
investigation of risk factors is necessary to inform strategies for prevention. 
There is scope to do this through the planned longitudinal extension of the UK 
Biobank study.

BACKGROUND: Half-life extension strategies have gained increasing interest to 
improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of protein 
therapeutics. Recently, we established an immunoglobulin-binding domain (IgBD) 
from streptococcal protein G (SpGC3) as module for half-life extension. SpGC3 is 
capable of binding to the Fc region as well as the CH1 domain of Fab arms under
