more than 1 year, HbA1c 7.0-10.0%. The primary endpoint was change in Diabetes 
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status version (DTSQs) total score 
(baseline to month 6). Secondary endpoints included reasons for starting 
Gla-300, changes in the DTSQ change version (DTSQc) total score, Hypoglycemia 
Fear Survey-II (HFS-II) total behavior and worry scores at months 6 and 12, 
HbA1c changes at months 3, 6, 9, and 12, and safety.
RESULTS: MAGE included 87 adults (mean T2DM duration 17 years). The primary 
endpoint of DTSQs mean (standard deviation) total score improvement at month 6 
was achieved (2.80 [5.46] points; p < 0.0001). The main reasons for Gla-300 
initiation were to decrease HbA1c (89.7% of participants) and reduce the number 
of hypoglycemic events (35.6% of participants). Significant improvements were 
observed in the DTSQc total score and perceived hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia 
(baseline to month 6, p < 0.05). Significant changes in HFS-II behavior, worry, 
and total scores at 6 and 12 months were also observed (p < 0.05). There were no 
statistically significant changes in HbA1c. Safety outcomes, including 
hypoglycemia, were comparable to previously reported trials.
CONCLUSIONS: The MAGE study indicates that Gla-300, as part of a basal-bolus 
regimen, results in improved treatment satisfaction and reduced hypoglycemia 
fear in people with advanced T2DM.

Priming of synaptic vesicles involves Munc13-catalyzed transition of the 
Munc18-1/syntaxin-1 complex to the SNARE complex in the presence of SNAP-25 and 
synaptobrevin-2; Munc13 drives opening of syntaxin-1 via the MUN domain while 
Munc18-1 primes SNARE assembly via domain 3a. However, the underlying mechanism 
remains unclear. In this study, we have identified a number of residues in 
domain 3a of Munc18-1 that are crucial for Munc13 and Munc18-1 actions in SNARE 
complex assembly and synaptic vesicle priming. Our results showed that two 
residues (Q301/K308) at the side of domain 3a mediate the interaction between 
the Munc18-1/syntaxin-1 complex and the MUN domain. This interaction enables the 
MUN domain to drive the opening of syntaxin-1 linker region, thereby leading to 
the extension of domain 3a and promoting synaptobrevin-2 binding. In addition, 
we identified two residues (K332/K333) at the bottom of domain 3a that mediate 
the interaction between Munc18-1 and the SNARE motif of syntaxin-1. This 
interaction ensures Munc18-1 to persistently associate with syntaxin-1 during 
the conformational change of syntaxin-1 from closed to open, which reinforces 
the role of Munc18-1 in templating SNARE assembly. Taken together, our data 
suggest a mechanism by which Munc13 activates the Munc18-1/syntaxin-1 complex 
and enables Munc18-1 to prime SNARE assembly.

T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).

AIM: Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
characterized by skin lesions, which can negatively impact the quality of life 
of both patients and their caregivers. The Decision Support Unit (DSU) at the 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK recently 
outlined a rationale for the inclusion of caregiver burden in economic 
evaluations. This study aimed to estimate utilities for health states associated 
with being a caregiver for an individual with CTCL at different stages of 
treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A targeted literature review and interviews with CTCL 
specialists informed the development of health state vignettes describing the 
experience caring for an individual with CTCL. The vignettes were evaluated in 
interviews with the UK general population using a visual analogue scale (VAS), 
the time trade-off (TTO) method and the EQ-5D-5L.
RESULTS: Four vignettes were developed describing the caregiver experience for 
an individual with CTCL on i) second line treatment, ii) third line treatment, 
iii) end of life care, iv) a post-patient death. One hundred interviews were 
conducted to evaluate the health state vignettes. The pattern of results was 
similar across the evaluation methods: second line treatment (VAS: 39.2, TTO = 
0.52, EQ-5D-5L: 0.56), third line treatment (VAS: 31.1, TTO = 0.39, EQ-5D-5L: 
0.37), end of life care (VAS: 28.2, TTO = 0.37, EQ-5D-5L: 0.31) and post-patient 
death (VAS: 41.2, TTO = 0.63, EQ-5D-5L: 0.59). Limitations and conclusions: 
These findings highlight the substantial burden of caring for an individual with 
CTCL and the importance of including caregiver burden in the health technology 
assessment review process. A limitation is the hypothetical vignette approach, 
which meant the TTO participants did not have experience of caring for 
individuals with CTCL, but were imagining this state. There is also the 
possibility that they may also be considering the patient experience when 
responding to the questions.

OBJECTIVE: This post hoc analysis evaluated long-term efficacy and safety in 
patients with focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCS) or generalized 
tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) who entered open-label extension (OLEx) studies to 
receive long-term adjunctive perampanel.
METHODS: Patients aged 12 years and older who completed phase II or III 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies could enter an OLEx study, 
each comprising a blinded conversion period followed by an open-label 
maintenance period (32-424 weeks; maximum perampanel dose = 12 mg/d). Exposure, 
seizure outcomes, and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were analyzed.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between patients with 
FBTCS (n = 720) and GTCS (n = 138). Mean (standard deviation) cumulative 
duration of perampanel exposure was 102.3 (70.3) weeks (FBTCS) and 83.9 (38.4) 
weeks (GTCS). Retention rates were 50.0% for up to 4 years (FBTCS) and 49.2% for 
up to 2 years (GTCS). Across OLEx treatment durations, median reductions in 
seizure frequency per 28 days were 66.7% (FBTCS) and 80.6% (GTCS). Fifty percent 
and 75% responder and seizure-freedom rates were 59.5%, 45.3%, and 18.4%, 
respectively (FBTCS), and 72.5%, 51.5%, and 16.7%, respectively (GTCS). Efficacy 
was sustained for up to 4 years (FBTCS) and up to 3 years (GTCS), even when 
accounting for early dropouts. TEAE incidence was highest during Year 1 (FBTCS, 
85.3%; GTCS, 86.2%); most common were dizziness and somnolence. During Year 1, 
serious TEAEs were reported in 81 (11.3%; FBTCS) and 10 (7.2%; GTCS) patients. 
TEAEs were consistent with the known safety profile of perampanel; no new safety 
signals were identified with long-term treatment.
SIGNIFICANCE: This post hoc analysis suggests long-term (up to 4 years) 
adjunctive perampanel (up to 12 mg/d) is efficacious and well tolerated in 
patients (aged 12 years and older) with FBTCS or GTCS.

The number of cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) repeats ('CTG expansion size') in 
the 3'untranslated region (UTR) region of the dystrophia myotonica-protein 
kinase (DMPK) gene is a hallmark of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), which has 
been related to age of disease onset and clinical severity. However, accurate 
determination of CTG expansion size is challenging due to its characteristic 
instability. We compared five different approaches (heat pulse extension 
polymerase chain reaction [PCR], long PCR-Southern blot [with three different 
primers sets-1, 2 and 3] and small pool [SP]-PCR) to estimate CTG expansion size 
in the progenitor allele as well as the most abundant CTG expansion size, in 15 
patients with DM1. Our results indicated variability between the methods 
(although we found no overall differences between long PCR 1 and 2 and SP-PCR, 
respectively). While keeping in mind the limited sample size of our patient 
cohort, SP-PCR appeared as the most suitable technique, with an inverse 
significant correlation found between CTG expansion size of the progenitor 
allele, as determined by this method, and age of disease onset (r = -0.734, p = 
0.016). Yet, in light of the variability of the results obtained with the 
different methods, we propose that an international agreement is needed to 
determine which is the most suitable method for assessing CTG expansion size in 
DM1.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prediction of stroke impact provides essential 
information for healthcare planning and priority setting. We aim to estimate 
30-year projections of stroke epidemiology in the European Union using multiple 
modeling approaches.
METHODS: Data on stroke incidence, prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted 
life years in the European Union between 1990 and 2017 were obtained from the 
global burden of disease study. Their trends over time were modeled using 3 
modeling strategies: linear, Poisson, and exponential regressions-adjusted for 
the gross domestic product per capita, which reflects the impact of economic 
development on health status. We used the Akaike information criterion for model 
selection. The 30-year projections up to 2047 were estimated using the best 
fitting models, with inputs on population projections from the United Nations 
and gross domestic product per capita prospects from the World Bank. The 
technique was applied separately by age-sex-country groups for each stroke 
measure.
RESULTS: In 2017, there were 1.12 million incident strokes in the European 
Union, 9.53 million stroke survivors, 0.46 million deaths, and 7.06 million 
disability-adjusted life years lost because of stroke. By 2047, we estimated an 
additional 40 000 incident strokes (+3%) and 2.58 million prevalent cases 
(+27%). Conversely, 80 000 fewer deaths (-17%) and 2.31 million fewer 
disability-adjusted life years lost (-33%) are projected. The largest increase 
in the age-adjusted incidence and prevalence rates are expected in Lithuania 
(average annual percentage change, 0.48% and 0.7% respectively), and the 
greatest reductions in Portugal (-1.57% and -1.3%). Average annual percentage 
change in mortality rates will range from -2.86% (Estonia) to -0.08% 
(Lithuania), and disability-adjusted life years' from -2.77% (Estonia) to -0.23% 
(Romania).
CONCLUSIONS: The number of people living with stroke is estimated to increase by 
27% between 2017 and 2047 in the European Union, mainly because of population 
ageing and improved survival rates. Variations are expected to persist between 
countries showing opportunities for improvements in prevention and case 
management particularly in Eastern Europe.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of 
liver cancer, is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide 
with an inferior prognosis. In Indonesia, the average life expectancy is less 
than 5 months, with most patients being in an advanced stage wherein the 
survival rate is very low. Early detection through surveillance program is very 
crucial. HCC guidelines worldwide have provided surveillance recommendation 
through the examination of α-fetoprotein (AFP) and ultrasound for patients at 
risk in developing HCC. However, there have been some controversies regarding 
the usage of AFP concerning its low sensitivity and specificity in detecting 
HCC. Therefore, the effectiveness of AFP in the surveillance of HCC patients and 
identifying the parameters most associated with the increase of AFP ≥ 10 ng/ml 
in Indonesia should be evaluated.
METHODS: We analyzed medical records of HCC patients and those at high risk of 
developing HCC through cross-sectional study, including patients with cirrhosis 
and hepatitis B and C, from 2015 to 2017 who underwent treatment at the Cipto 
Mangunkusumo National General Hospital and Dharmais National Cancer Hospital, 
Indonesia.
RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of AFP in the surveillance of HCC in 
Indonesia with a cut-off of 10 ng/ml were 82.6 and 71.2%, respectively. The 
parameters most associated with the increase of AFP ≥10 ng/ml according to 
multivariate analysis were the etiology of hepatitis B, the stage of Barcelona 
Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) B and C, and the presence of cirrhosis, respectively.
CONCLUSION: AFP can still be used in the surveillance of HCC in Indonesia for 
its high sensitivity value.

BACKGROUND: Life extension by medical interventions and health-related quality 
of life (HRQOL) are sometimes conflicting aspects of medical care. Long-term 
ventilation in children with neuromuscular disease is a well-established 
life-extending procedure and often at the center of this conflict. HRQOL and the 
mental health of affected children and their families become even more important 
in respect to emerging therapies in neuromuscular diseases with longer 
life-expectancy of treated patients and considerable costs of medical treatment.
METHODS: We performed a questionnaire survey in a total of forty-three families 
of children with neuromuscular disease treated in the University Medical Center 
Hamburg-Eppendorf and the Children's Hospital Altona. We evaluated self- and 
proxy-reported HRQOL and mental health outcomes of affected children and their 
parents using validated and age-appropriate instruments.
RESULTS: Compared to normative data, children with neuromuscular diseases and 
their families experienced a lower HRQOL and mental health. However, there was 
no additional negative influence on the overall HRQOL by ventilator use.
CONCLUSIONS: As ventilator use was not responsible for the reduction of HRQOL 
and mental health our data contributes an important aspect to the discussion 
about life-prolonging procedures, in particular mechanical ventilation, in 
severly disabled patients.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) or Steinert's disease (CIE-9-C: 359.21; 
CIE-10-ES: G71.11, ORPHA: 273) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited myopathy 
with almost complete penetrance and multisystemic consequences (neurological, 
cardiological, respiratory, endocrinological, and gastrointestinal). It is one 
of the clinical most variable diseases. The most bothersome symptoms for the 
patients (mobility problems, fatigue, hypersomnia, or gastrointestinal symptoms) 
and their families (apathy, lack of initiative) are not necessarily the most 
dangerous. Respiratory problems and cardiac arrhythmias shorten life expectancy. 
There is no specific treatment. The role of the Primary Care physician is 
crucial in the follow-up of DM1, either by coordinating the different 
professionals or detecting treatable complications. This work addresses the 
latter.

Over the last decade there has been a worldwide increase in the demand of 
platelet concentrates (PCs) for transfusion. This is, to a great extent, due to 
a growing and aging population with the concomitant increase in the incidence of 
onco-hematological diseases, which require frequent platelet (PLT) transfusions. 
Currently, PLTs are sourced uniquely from donations, and their storage time is 
limited only to a few days. The necessity to store PCs at room temperature (to 
minimize loss of PLT functional integrity), poses a major risk for bacterial 
contamination. While the implementation of pathogen reduction treatments (PRTs) 
and new-generation PLT additive solutions have allowed the extension of the 
shelf life and a safer PLT transfusion product, the concern of PCs shortage 
still pressures the scientific community to find alternative solutions with the 
aim of meeting the PLT transfusion increasing demand. In this concise report, we 
will focus on the efforts made to produce, in in vitro culture, high yields of 
viable and functional PLTs for transfusion purposes in a cost-effective manner, 
meeting not only current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs), but also 
transfusion safety standards.

OBJECTIVE: A long-term health economic analysis was performed to establish the 
cost-effectiveness of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) (Dexcom 
G6) versus self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) alone in U.K.-based patients 
with type 1 diabetes (T1D).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The analysis used the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. 
Clinical input data were sourced from the DIAMOND trial in adults with T1D. 
Simulations were performed separately in the overall population of patients with 
baseline HbA1c ≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol), and a secondary analysis was performed in 
patients with baseline HbA1c ≥8.5% (69 mmol/mol). The analysis was performed 
from the National Health Service health care payer perspective over a lifetime 
time horizon.
RESULTS: In the overall population, G6 RT-CGM was associated with a mean 
incremental gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 1.49 quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) versus SMBG (mean [SD] 11.47 [2.04] QALYs versus 9.99 [1.84] 
QALYs). Total mean (SD) lifetime costs were also pounds sterling (GBP) 14,234 
higher with RT-CGM (GBP 102,468 [35,681] versus GBP 88,234 [39,027]) resulting 
in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 9,558 per QALY gained. 
Sensitivity analyses revealed that the findings were sensitive to changes in the 
quality-of-life benefit associated with reduced fear of hypoglycemia and 
avoidance of fingerstick testing as well as the HbA1c benefit associated with 
RT-CGM use.
CONCLUSIONS: For U.K.-based T1D patients, the G6 RT-CGM device is associated 
with significant improvements in clinical outcomes and, over patient lifetimes, 
is a cost-effective disease management option relative to SMBG on the basis of a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of GBP 20,000 per QALY gained.

Patients' views on end-of-life practices that hasten death: a qualitative study 
exploring ethical distinctions.

BACKGROUND: Assisted dying (AD) is currently of wide interest due to legislative 
change. Its relationship to other end-of-life practices such as palliative 
sedation (PS) is the subject of ongoing debate. The aim of this article is to 
describe the perspectives of a group of New Zealanders with life-limiting 
illness, who want or would consider AD, on the provision of end of life 
services, including assisted death, withdrawal of lifeprolonging treatment and 
symptom management with opioids or PS.
METHODS: We recruited 14 people with life-limiting illness and life expectancy 
of less than a year. Their mean age was 61 (range, 34-82) years and half were 
enrolled in Hospice. An additional six family members were also interviewed and 
included in analysis. We asked them about why they would consider AD if it was 
available. Interview transcripts were inductively analyzed consistent with 
thematic analysis. We compared the findings to prevailing ethical frameworks.
RESULTS: Most of the participants viewed current palliative care practices, such 
as pain relief with opioids and symptom management with PS, as hastening death, 
in contrast to some medical research which concludes that proportional 
therapeutic doses do not hasten death. Some participants did not agree with the 
'doctrine of double effect' ('DDE') and saw such practices as 'slow euthanasia' 
and 'covert euthanasia'. They implied such practices were performed without 
patient consent, though they did not conceive of this as murder. Participants 
asserted that active and passive practices for ending life were morally 
equivalent, and preferred to choose the time of death over other legal means for 
death.
CONCLUSIONS: This article contributes to what is known about how patients 
perceive end-of-life practices that potentially hasten death. There is a divide 
in what medical ethics and most health professionals and what some patients 
consider active hastening death. Participants' perspective was consistent with a 
consequentialist framework whereas deontology often guides medical ethics at the 
end of life. Participants' challenge to the interpretation of legal end-of-life 
practices as AD represents an epistemic contest to the foundation of medical 
knowledge, authority and ethics and therefore carries implications for 
preferences in care, communication and palliative care practice.

Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has quickly outpaced open treatment of 
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and iliac artery aneurysms, 
relegating most open AAA repair for either young patients with long life 
expectancy or patients with extreme anatomic constraints. Typically, open repair 
involves opening the aneurysm sac with suture ligation of back-bleeding vessels. 
However, in situations where an aortobifemoral repair is performed, proximal and 
distal ligation can be performed leaving behind a "remnant" aorta and iliac 
arteries. Usually, major palpable vessels are ligated and small lumbars 
spontaneously thrombose. However, failure of this to occur can lead to a rare 
situation in which there is persistent filling of a remnant aorta and aneurysm 
sac leading to a situation similar to a type II endoleak after EVAR. Typically, 
this leak has been repaired by open ligation. We present a technique for 
endovascular coiling and thrombin injection to correct a "type II endoleak" from 
a back-bleeding lumbar artery after open aortoiliac and femoral aneurysm repair.

Hospital, Linkou, Taiwan (Drs Wang and Tang).

BACKGROUND: There is a lack of studies investigating gender differences in 
cancer truth-telling, especially from the Asia Pacific countries.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare preferences for cancer 
truth-telling between male and female cancer patients in Taiwan.
METHODS: We used a quantitative cross-sectional design. Cancer patients (aged 
≥18 years) were enrolled from 6 hospitals across Taiwan. A Taiwanese version of 
the Japanese truth-telling questionnaire was used to collect data. Multiple 
regression and independent t test were used for analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 590 patients (49.6% male, 50.4% female) participated in this 
study. A multiple regression showed no gender differences in total scale and 
subscales (setting, method of disclosure, additional information, and emotional 
support). However, in item analysis, we found that female patients preferred 
detailed medical information (t = -1.973, P = .049). Both male and female 
patients preferred to know their medical condition (t = -1.259, P = .209), 
direct and frank truth-telling (t = -0.262, P = .794), and assistance in 
treatment decision-making (t = -0.467, P = .641). There was no gender difference 
in willingness to know the life expectancy (t = -0.769, P = .442) and families' 
presence during truth-telling (t = -0.416, P = .678).
CONCLUSION: Few gender differences exist in the preferences of truth-telling for 
cancer patients.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our findings can increase the sensitivity of 
truth-telling among nurse and other healthcare personnel when taking care of 
cancer patients of different genders and thereby likely improve the quality of 
cancer care.

The purpose of the article is to analyze the interaction effect between social 
network and extension service in farmers' agricultural technology adoption 
efficiency (TAE). The empirical analysis refers to samples of farmers' 
water-saving irrigation technology (WSIT) adoption from Minqin, China. The 
result indicates that social network and extension service can improve farmers' 
TAE, but they are found to be competitive from the perspective of overall social 
network. While from the perspective of four dimensions of social network, 
interaction and trust have positive effects on farmers' TAE, and learning and 
trust are found to be competitive with extension service. The policy implication 
describes as follows. First, government should pay attention to farmers' social 
learning and demonstration effect. And series of measures should be taken to 
cultivate farmers' social network. Second, extension service should be improved 
to satisfy farmers' multiple demand on agricultural technology. Third, 
government should combine the effects of social network and extension service, 
and make different promotion strategies for different regions. In addition, 
other influential factors cannot be ignored.

AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is a factor that reduces lower 
extremity muscle strength (LEMS) in older type 2 diabetes patients. This 
relationship remains unclear in longitudinal studies. Therefore, we 
longitudinally investigated the apparent effects of DPN on changes in LEMS. 
Furthermore, we cross-sectionally examined relationships among DPN, LEMS, 
mobility and health-related quality of life.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bodyweight-normalized (relative) knee extension force 
(KEF) was examined in 51 DPN and 54 non-DPN patients (68.9 ± 5.6 and 
70.2 ± 5.9 years, respectively) at baseline and follow up at 3.6 ± 0.6 years. At 
follow up, mobility was measured using a 25-question geriatric locomotive 
function scale. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the 
five-dimensions of EuroQol for quality-adjusted life years calculation.
RESULTS: Relative KEF in the DPN group was significantly lower at follow up 
(1.22 ± 0.47 Nm/kg) than at baseline (1.31 ± 0.47 Nm/kg; P < 0.05). DPN 
significantly affected changes in relative KEF. Mobility decreased by 41 and 65% 
in the non-DPN and DPN groups, respectively. Quality-adjusted life years were 
significantly lower in the DPN group (0.856 ± 0.131) than in the non-DPN group 
(0.920 ± 0.105; P < 0.01). Relative KEF was a significant independent variable 
that explained quality-adjusted life years.
CONCLUSIONS: DPN clearly reduced LEMS in older type 2 diabetes patients within 
4 years. Furthermore, DPN resulted in a loss of LEMS and decrease in mobility. 
Therefore, DPN development should be monitored closely, with glycemic control 
and LEMS kept at a high level to maintain health-related quality of life in 
older patients with type 2 diabetes.

Central nervous system leukemia (CNSL) is a severe complication of acute 
leukemia, with serious consequences for life quality and expectancy. The 
molecular mechanism of CNSL is unclear at present. Thus, determining appropriate 
prevention and therapeutic strategies for CNSL remain challenging. Currently, 
inferences regarding gene functions are based on the measurement of average gene 
expression in a bulk lysate. However, leukemia cells are a heterogeneous 
population in which the expression of critical genes may be masked by many 
unrelated genes. Single-cell sequencing may therefore be the best way to explore 
the development of CNSL in the bone marrow and peripheral blood at diagnosis and 
subsequent time points, in order to detect potential targets and prevent the 
development of CNSL. In this review, we first discuss the possible mechanism of 
CNSL, then describe the heterogeneity of leukemia cells. Finally, we focus on 
the role of single-cell technology in preventing and treating CNSL.

Sociality has profound evolutionary roots and is observed from unicellular 
organisms to multicellular animals. In line with the view that social principles 
apply across levels of biological complexity, a growing body of data highlights 
the remarkable social nature of mitochondria - life-sustaining endosymbiotic 
organelles with their own genome that populate the cell cytoplasm. Here, we draw 
from organizing principles of behavior in social organisms to reveal that 
similar to individuals among social networks, mitochondria communicate with each 
other and with the cell nucleus, exhibit group formation and interdependence, 
synchronize their behaviors, and functionally specialize to accomplish specific 
functions within the organism. Mitochondria are social organelles. The extension 
of social principles across levels of biological complexity is a theoretical 
shift that emphasizes the role of communication and interdependence in cell 
biology, physiology, and neuroscience. With the help of emerging computational 
methods capable of capturing complex dynamic behavioral patterns, the 
implementation of social concepts in mitochondrial biology may facilitate 
cross-talk across disciplines towards increasingly holistic and accurate models 
of human health.

Species-specific limits to lifespan (lifespan setpoint) determine the life 
expectancy of any given organism. Whether limiting lifespan provides an 
evolutionary benefit or is the result of an inevitable decline in fitness 
remains controversial. The identification of mutations extending lifespan 
suggests that aging is under genetic control, but the evolutionary driving 
forces limiting lifespan have not been defined. By examining the impact of 
lifespan on pathogen spread in a population, we propose that epidemics drive 
lifespan setpoints' evolution. Shorter lifespan limits infection spread and 
accelerates pathogen clearance when compared to populations with longer-lived 
individuals. Limiting longevity is particularly beneficial in the context of 
zoonotic transmissions, where pathogens must undergo adaptation to a new host. 
Strikingly, in populations exposed to pathogens, shorter-living variants 
outcompete individuals with longer lifespans. We submit that infection outbreaks 
can contribute to control the evolution of species' lifespan setpoints.

The study aimed to: (1) Identify distinct trajectories of change in depressive 
symptoms by mid-treatment during psychotherapy for late-life depression with 
executive dysfunction; (2) examine if nonresponse by mid-treatment predicted 
poor response at treatment end; and (3) identify baseline characteristics 
predicting an early nonresponse trajectory by mid-treatment. A sample of 221 
adults 60 years and older with major depression and executive dysfunction were 
randomized to 12 weeks of either problem-solving therapy or supportive therapy. 
We used Latent Growth Mixture Models (LGMM) to detect subgroups with distinct 
trajectories of change in depression by mid-treatment (6th week). We conducted 
regression analyses with LGMM subgroups as predictors of response at treatment 
end. We used random forest machine learning algorithms to identify baseline 
predictors of LGMM trajectories. We found that ~77.5% of participants had a 
declining trajectory of depression in weeks 0-6, while the remaining 22.5% had a 
persisting depression trajectory, with no treatment differences. The LGMM 
trajectories predicted remission and response at treatment end. A random forests 
model with high prediction accuracy (80%) showed that the strongest modifiable 
predictors of the persisting depression trajectory were low perceived social 
support, followed by high neuroticism, low treatment expectancy, and low 
perception of the therapist as accepting. Our results suggest that modifiable 
risk factors of early nonresponse to psychotherapy can be identified at the 
outset of treatment and addressed with targeted personalized interventions. 
Therapists may focus on increasing meaningful social interactions, addressing 
concerns related to treatment benefits, and creating a positive working 
relationship.

Congenital heart defects (CHD) represent a growing burden of illness among 
adults. We estimated the lifetime health, education, labor, and social outcomes 
of adults with CHD in the USA using the Future Adult Model, a dynamic 
microsimulation model that has been used to study the lifetime impacts of a 
variety of chronic diseases. We simulated a cohort of adult heads of 
households > 25 years old derived from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics who 
reported a childhood heart problem as a proxy for CHD and calculated life 
expectancy, disability-free and quality-adjusted life years, lifetime earnings, 
education attainment, employment, development of chronic disease, medical 
spending, and disability insurance claiming status. Total burden of disease was 
estimated by comparing to a healthy cohort with no childhood heart problem.
