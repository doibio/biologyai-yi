aspirin daily (P = 0.004). Seventh-seven (93%) BE patients with IHD and 36 (90%) 
AdE patients with IHD were on statins (P = 0.86). Logistic regression analysis: 
AdE was more frequent in the elderly, with long term reflux, long BE and 
concurrent IHD (odds ratio: 2.086, P = 0.001) not consuming statins. Eighteen 
(22%) BE patients with IHD [16 (84%) with myocardial infarction] vs 33 (10%) 
without IHD died from non-neoplastic causes within 24 mo from BE diagnosis (P = 
0.005).
CONCLUSION: IHD is more prevalent in AdE than BE patients. Increased prevalence 
of AdE is related with the presence of myocardial infarction but not severe 
heart failure, possibly because patients with BE and severe IHD have low life 
expectancy.

IMPORTANCE: Many Medicare beneficiaries undergo more intensive colonoscopy 
screening than recommended. Whether this is favorable for beneficiaries and 
efficient from a societal perspective is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether more intensive colonoscopy screening than 
recommended is favorable for Medicare beneficiaries (ie, whether it results in a 
net health benefit) and whether it is efficient from a societal perspective (ie, 
whether the net health benefit justifies the additional resources required).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Microsimulation modeling study of 65-year-old 
Medicare beneficiaries at average risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) and with an 
average life expectancy who underwent a screening colonoscopy at 55 years with 
negative results.
INTERVENTIONS: Colonoscopy screening as recommended by guidelines (ie, at 65 and 
75 years) vs scenarios with a shorter screening interval (5 or 3 instead of 10 
years) or in which screening was continued to 85 or 95 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained (measure 
of net health benefit); additional colonoscopies required per additional QALY 
gained and additional costs per additional QALY gained (measures of efficiency).
RESULTS: Screening previously screened Medicare beneficiaries more intensively 
than recommended resulted in only small increases in CRC deaths prevented and 
life-years gained. In comparison, the increases in colonoscopies performed and 
colonoscopy-related complications experienced were large. As a result, all 
scenarios of more intensive screening than recommended resulted in a loss of 
QALYs, rather than a gain (ie, a net harm). The only exception was shortening 
the screening interval from 10 to 5 years, which resulted in 0.7 QALYs gained 
per 1000 beneficiaries. However, this scenario was inefficient because it 
required no less than 909 additional colonoscopies and an additional $711 000 
per additional QALY gained. Results in previously unscreened beneficiaries were 
slightly less unfavorable, but conclusions were identical.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Screening Medicare beneficiaries more intensively 
than recommended is not only inefficient from a societal perspective; often it 
is also unfavorable for those being screened. This study provides evidence and a 
clear rationale for clinicians and policy makers to actively discourage this 
practice.

IMPORTANCE: Routine cancer screening has unproven net benefit for patients with 
limited life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the patterns of prostate, breast, cervical, and colorectal 
cancer screening in the United States in individuals with different life 
expectancies.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data from the population-based National 
Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 2000 through 2010 were used and included 
27 404 participants aged 65 years or older. Using a validated mortality index 
specific for NHIS, participants were grouped into those with low (<25%), 
intermediate (25%-49%), high (50%-74%), and very high (≥75%) risks of 9-year 
mortality.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of prostate, breast, cervical, and colorectal 
cancer screening.
RESULTS: In participants with very high mortality risk, 31% to 55% received 
recent cancer screening, with prostate cancer screening being most common (55%). 
For women who had a hysterectomy for benign reasons, 34% to 56% had a 
Papanicolaou test within the past 3 years. On multivariate analysis, very high 
vs low mortality risk was associated with less screening for prostate (odds 
ratio [OR], 0.65 [95% CI, 0.50-0.85]), breast (OR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.35-0.53]), 
and cervical (OR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.36-0.70]) cancers. There was less screening 
for prostate and cervical cancers in more recent years compared with 2000, and 
there was no significant interaction between calendar year and mortality risk 
for any cancer screening (P > .05 for all cancers). Our sensitivity analysis 
showed that screening was also common in individuals with less than 5-year life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A substantial proportion of the US population with 
limited life expectancy received prostate, breast, cervical, and colorectal 
cancer screening that is unlikely to provide net benefit. These results suggest 
that overscreening is common in both men and women, which not only increases 
health care expenditure but can lead to net patient harm.

Estimation of global content of 5-methylcytosine in DNA during allantoic and 
pulmonary respiration in the chicken embryo.

Gryzińska M, Andraszek K, Jezewska-WItkowska G.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays an important role in 
the proper development and functioning of an organism. The DNA methylation level 
is species-, tissue- and organelle-specific, and the methylation pattern is 
determined during embryogenesis. A correlation between methylation and age is 
also observed. Epigenetic phenomena are an enormously interesting research 
subject, not only from the perspective of pure science, but also due to their 
possible applications in medicine. The aim of this study was to determine the 
global DNA methylation level in relation to the developmental stage of the 
embryo. The global level of 5-methylcytosine in the DNA during pulmonary 
respiration was found to be higher than during allantoic respiration. The 
analysis shows a clear dependence between the stage of individual development 
and the global DNA level of 5-methylcytosine. In the future, methylation level 
may be a determinant of age and perhaps even a tool for predicting life 
expectancy. Abnormalities in the methylation process result in premature ageing 
at the cellular and individual level.

INTRODUCTION: In recent years, in Italy, population lengthening of life leads to 
an higher number of individuals with chronic diseases (Osservatorio, 2010). The 
hospital which deals with the acute phase of diseases needs to be integrated 
with primary care. This connection is particularly important for the treatment, 
care and rehabilitation of patient, as well as a general need for more health 
and social care integrated tools.
OBJECTIVE: At the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza, in the context of the patient's 
post-acute rehabilitation, we analyze the phase between discharge from hospital 
and the expected date of hospitalization in facilities providing rehabilitation. 
The aim of this observational descriptive study is to determine the distribution 
of days of waiting. Furthermore, several different approach are analysed (i.e. 
Integrated Home Care) in order to reduce unnecessary days hospitalization and a 
more intelligent and cost effective use of resources The research question are 
the follow, to quantify waiting time between discharge and hospitalization in 
the rehabilitation facility and to ascertain if patients are sent to the correct 
facility.
RESULT: 1083 individuals were taken into account, of those 55% (N=652) were 
discharged from the hospital later. This leads to a 4505 days of inappropriate 
hospitalization.
CONCLUSION: Although the use of home care could be beneficial to the hospital, 
this can be used only for tiny part of the patients and it is not cost 
effective. A possible solution can be set up a number of low cost bed entirely 
managed by nurses due to the low level of intensity care.

Publisher: INTRODUZIONE. In Italia negli ultimi anni l’aumento della 
sopravvivenza della popolazione ha comportato il cambiamento dello stato di 
salute, che vede l’incremento nella prevalenza delle patologie croniche 
(Osservatorio, 2011). L’ospedale, riservato alla fase acuta delle patologie, si 
integra necessariamente con le cure primarie. La continuità assume particolare 
rilevanza per la cura, assistenza e riabilitazione della persona assistita, così 
come l’appropriato utilizzo delle diverse tipologie di offerta socio sanitaria 
assistenziale e riabilitativa. OBIETTIVO. Al San Gerardo di Monza, nell’ambito 
della riabilitazione del paziente post-acuto, si analizza la fase che intercorre 
tra la dimissione prevista dall’ospedale e la data di accettazione presso gli 
istituti di riabilitazione. E’ possibile quantificare i tempi di attesa? L’ 
allocazione delle persone assistite è appropriata? Scopo dello studio 
osservazionale descrittivo è accertare la distribuzione dei giorni di attesa. 
Inoltre si ipotizza il ricorso all’Assistenza Domiciliare Integrata e a 
soluzioni innovative. Obiettivi sono la diminuzione delle giornate di degenza 
inappropriate e l’utilizzo delle risorse in modo congruo. RISULTATI. Delle 1083 
persone in attesa di riabilitazione il 55% (652), a cui sono associate 4505 
giornate “inappropriate”, è stato dimesso dall’ospedale oltre i tempi previsti. 
CONCLUSIONI. L’utilizzo dell’assistenza domiciliare, vantaggiosa per l’ospedale, 
può essere utilizzata solo per una minoranza di pazienti e in modo diseconomico. 
Per abbattere la totalità delle giornate, una soluzione innovativa può essere 
l’istituzione di posti letto a basso costo. E dato che la maggioranza dei casi 
sono solo ad alta complessità assistenziale ma a bassa intensità clinica 
potrebbero essere letti gestiti da infermieri.

BACKGROUND: There is a higher prevalence of obesity in individuals with mental 
disorders compared to the general population. The results of several studies 
suggested that weight reduction in this population is possible following 
psycho-educational and/or behavioural weight management interventions. Evidence 
of the effectiveness alone is however inadequate for policy making. The aim of 
the current study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a health promotion 
intervention targeting physical activity and healthy eating in individuals with 
mental disorders.
METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model using a public payer perspective was 
applied, projecting the one-year results of a 10-week intervention over a time 
horizon of 20 years, assuming a repeated yearly implementation of the programme. 
Scenario analysis was applied evaluating the effects on the results of 
alternative modelling assumptions. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to 
assess the effects on the results of varying key input parameters.
RESULTS: An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 27,096€/quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY) in men, and 40,139€/QALY in women was found in the base case. 
Scenario analysis assuming an increase in health-related quality of life as a 
result of the body mass index decrease resulted in much better 
cost-effectiveness in both men (3,357€/QALY) and women (3,766€/QALY). The 
uncertainty associated with the intervention effect had the greatest impact on 
the model.
CONCLUSIONS: As far as is known to the authors, this is the first health 
economic evaluation of a health promotion intervention targeting physical 
activity and healthy eating in individuals with mental disorders. Such research 
is important as it provides payers and governments with better insights how to 
spend the available resources in the most efficient way. Further research 
examining the cost-effectiveness of health promotion targeting physical activity 
and healthy eating in individuals with mental disorders is required.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined by differences in social communication 
and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. 
Skills and challenges can change depending on environmental stimuli, supports, 
and stressors. Quality of life can be improved by the use of accommodations, 
assistive technologies, therapies to improve adaptive function or communication, 
caregiver training, acceptance, access, and inclusion. This article focuses on 
the identification of ASD in adults, referrals for services, the recognition of 
associated conditions, strategies and accommodations to facilitate effective 
primary care services, and ethical issues related to caring for autistic adults.

OBJECTIVE: To use contingent valuation (CV) to derive individual consumer values 
for both health and broader benefits of a public-health intervention directed at 
lifestyle behaviour change (LBC) and to examine the feasibility and validity of 
the method.
METHOD: Participants of a lifestyle intervention trial (n = 515) were invited to 
complete an online CV survey. Respondents (n = 312) expressed willingness to 
invest money and time for changes in life expectancy, health-related quality of 
life (HRQOL) and broader quality of life aspects. Internal validity was tested 
for by exploring associations between explanatory variables (i.e. income, paid 
work, experience and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases) and willingness 
to invest, and by examining ordering effects and respondents' sensitivity to the 
scope of the benefits.
RESULTS: The majority of respondents (94.3%) attached value to benefits of LBC, 
and 87.4% were willing to invest both money and time. Respondents were willing 
to invest more for improvements in HRQOL (€42/month; 3 h/week) and broader 
quality of life aspects (€40/month; 2.6 h/week) than for improvements in life 
expectancy (€24/month; 2 h/week). Protest answers were limited (3%) and findings 
regarding internal validity were mixed.
CONCLUSION: The importance of broader quality of life outcomes to consumers 
suggests that these outcomes are relevant to be considered in the decision 
making. Our research showed that CV is a feasible method to value both health 
and broader outcomes of LBC, but generalizability to other areas of public 
health still needs to be examined. Mixed evidence regarding internal validity 
pleads for caution to use CV as only the base for decision making.

Trans-boundary haze events in Southeast Asia are associated with large forest 
and peatland fires in Indonesia. These episodes of extreme air pollution usually 
occur during drought years induced by climate anomalies from the Pacific (El 
Niño Southern Oscillation) and Indian Oceans (Indian Ocean Dipole). However, in 
June 2013--a non-drought year--Singapore's 24-hr Pollutants Standards Index 
reached an all-time record 246 (rated "very unhealthy"). Here, we show using 
remote sensing, rainfall records and other data, that the Indonesian fires 
behind the 2013 haze followed a two-month dry spell in a wetter-than-average 
year. These fires were short-lived (one week) and limited to a localized area in 
Central Sumatra (1.6% of Indonesia): burning an estimated 163,336 ha, including 
137,044 ha (84%) on peat. Most burning was confined to deforested lands (82%; 
133,216 ha). The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during this brief, localized 
event were considerable: 172 ± 59 Tg CO2-eq (or 31 ± 12 Tg C), representing 
5-10% of Indonesia's mean annual GHG emissions for 2000-2005. Our observations 
show that extreme air pollution episodes in Southeast Asia are no longer 
restricted to drought years. We expect major haze events to be increasingly 
frequent because of ongoing deforestation of Indonesian peatlands.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is still referred to as the leading cause 
of severe and irreversible visual loss world-wide. The disease has a profound 
effect on quality of life of affected individuals and represents a major 
socioeconomic challenge for societies due to the exponential increase in life 
expectancy and environmental risks. Advances in medical research have identified 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as an important pathophysiological 
player in neovascular AMD and intraocular inhibition of VEGF as one of the most 
efficient therapies in medicine. The wide introduction of anti-VEGF therapy has 
led to an overwhelming improvement in the prognosis of patients affected by 
neovascular AMD, allowing recovery and maintenance of visual function in the 
vast majority of patients. However, the therapeutic benefit is accompanied by 
significant economic investments, unresolved medicolegal debates about the use 
of off-label substances and overwhelming problems in large population 
management. The burden of disease has turned into a burden of care with a 
dissociation of scientific advances and real-world clinical performance. 
Simultaneously, ground-breaking innovations in diagnostic technologies, such as 
optical coherence tomography, allows unprecedented high-resolution visualisation 
of disease morphology and provides a promising horizon for early disease 
detection and efficient therapeutic follow-up. However, definite conclusions 
from morphologic parameters are still lacking, and valid biomarkers have yet to 
be identified to provide a practical base for disease management. The European 
Society of Retina Specialists offers expert guidance for diagnostic and 
therapeutic management of neovascular AMD supporting healthcare givers and 
doctors in providing the best state-of-the-art care to their patients.

Vaccination is the most effective medical intervention ever introduced and, 
together with clean water and sanitation, it has eliminated a large part of the 
infectious diseases that once killed millions of people. A recent study 
concluded that since 1924 in the United States alone, vaccines have prevented 40 
million cases of diphtheria, 35 million cases of measles, and a total of 103 
million cases of childhood diseases. A report from the World Health Organization 
states that today vaccines prevent 2.5 million deaths per year: Every minute 
five lives are saved by vaccines worldwide. Overall, vaccines have done and 
continue to do an excellent job in eliminating or reducing the impact of 
childhood diseases. Furthermore, thanks to new technologies, vaccines now have 
the potential to make an enormous contribution to the health of modern society 
by preventing and treating not only communicable diseases in all ages, but also 
noncommunicable diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The 
achievement of these results requires the development of novel technologies and 
health economic models able to capture not only the mere cost-benefit of 
vaccination, but also the value of health per se.

AIMS: We wish to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of remote monitoring 
of heart failure patients with cardiac implanted electronic devices.
METHODS: REM-HF is a multicentre, randomized, non-blinded, parallel trial 
designed to compare weekly remote monitoring-driven management with usual care 
for patients with cardiac implanted electronic devices (ICD, CRT-D, or CRT-P). 
The trial is event driven, and the final analysis will be performed when 546 
events have been observed or the study is terminated at the interim analysis. We 
have randomized 1650 patients to be followed up for a minimum of 2 years. 
Patients will remain in the trial up to study termination. The first patient was 
randomized in September 2011 and the study is expected to complete in early 
2016. The primary combined endpoint is time to first event of all-cause death or 
unplanned hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. An economic evaluation 
will be performed, estimating the cost per quality-adjusted life year, with 
direct costs estimated from the National Health Service perspective and quality 
of life assessed by the EQ-5D, Short-Form 12, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy 
Questionnaires. The study design has been informed by a feasibility study.
CONCLUSION: REM-HF is a multicentre randomized study that will provide important 
data on the effect of remote monitoring-driven management of implanted cardiac 
devices on morbidity and mortality, as well as the cost-effectiveness of this 
approach.

Joubert syndrome (JS) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive 
ciliopathy with 22 genes implicated to date, including a small, ciliary GTPase, 
ARL13B. ARL13B is required for cilia formation in vertebrates. JS patients 
display multiple symptoms characterized by ataxia due to the cerebellar vermis 
hypoplasia, and that can also include ocular abnormalities, renal cysts, liver 
fibrosis or polydactyly. These symptoms are shared with other ciliopathies, some 
of which display additional phenotypes, such as obesity. Here we identified a 
novel homozygous missense variant in ARL13B/JBTS8 in a JS patient who displayed 
retinal defects and obesity. We demonstrate the variant disrupts ARL13B 
function, as its expression did not rescue the mutant phenotype either in 
Arl13b(scorpion) zebrafish or in Arl13b(hennin) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, 
while the wild-type ARL13B did. Finally, we show that ARL13B is localized within 
the primary cilia of neonatal mouse hypothalamic neurons consistent with the 
known link between hypothalamic ciliary function and obesity. Thus our data 
identify a novel ARL13B variant that causes JS and retinopathy and suggest an 
extension of the phenotypic spectrum of ARL13B mutations to obesity.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition that can affect any 
part of the gastrointestinal tract. It leads to severe symptoms and reduced 
quality of life. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody against TNF-α and is 
effective in treating moderate to severe CD. It is associated with high 
treatment costs, but subsequent reductions in hospitalisation and surgery have 
been reported. This review examines the evidence for the cost-effectiveness of 
infliximab for the treatment of CD. Studies have been found to be very 
heterogeneous depending on setting, costs assumed and clinical data. Within the 
UK setting infliximab has been found to be cost effective with increased costs 
of around £25,000 per quality adjusted life year gained.

Comment in
    Sleep Breath. 2015 May;19(2):737-9.

PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is common in adult population 
and it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, especially due to 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both diagnosis, based on polysomnography, and 
treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), carry a potentially 
high cost. The present study aims to analyze the cost-effectiveness of CPAP 
treatment versus no treatment, in the long-term, as it examines the effect of 
this treatment on the incidence of CVD.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to observe the disease evolution in 
patients with OSAS based on published evidence. Data on treatment costs were 
collected from public hospitals in Greece. Within each cycle of the model, each 
patient may remain free of CVD, may develop CVD, may die due to a cause related 
to CVD, or may die from other causes. The model begins at the age of 55 years in 
a severe OSAS patient (apnea-hypopnea index ≥30/h) and lasts for 45 years.
RESULTS: Within the limitation of the model, CPAP was found to be a 
cost-effective strategy versus no treatment, due to the reduction of the cost 
for the CVD treatment, when the analysis was restricted to the male population. 
Moreover, CPAP was found to be clinically more effective than no treatment, as 
it increases life expectancy in both males and females.
CONCLUSIONS: CPAP was found to be clinically more effective therapy than no 
treatment in relation to CVD and a cost-effective strategy in males with severe 
OSAS.

In this study, aerobic decolorization and degradation of azo dye Acid Orange G 
(AOG) by both suspended growing cells and immobilized cells of a yeast strain 
Candida tropicalis TL-F1 were studied. The effects of different parameters on 
decolorization of AOG by both growing suspended and immobilized strain TL-F1 
were investigated. Furthermore, a possible decolorization mechanism of AOG was 
proposed through analyzing metabolic intermediates using UV-vis and 
high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) methods. 
Strain TL-F1 could decolorize AOG in both liquid and solid mediums through 
degradation. The optimal conditions for decolorization with suspended growing 
cells of strain TL-F1 were as follows: 6-10 g/L sucrose, 5-7 g/L urea, ≥6 % 
(v/v) inoculation size, ≥160 rpm, 35-40 °C, and pH 5.0-6.0; and those for 
immobilized cells, the conditions were as follows: 4-6 g/L glucose, 0.2-0.4 g/L 
urea, 6-10 g/L (wet cell pellets) inoculation size, ≥160 rpm, 35-40 °C, and pH 
5.0-7.0. Results of UV-vis scanning spectra suggested that AOG was decolorized 
through biodegradation, and the possible pathway was proposed through the 
results of HPLC-MS analysis and related literature. This is a systematic 
research on aerobic decolorization and degradation of AOG by both suspended and 
immobilized cells of a C. tropicalis strain.

Arabidopsis thaliana calmodulin-like protein CML24 regulates pollen tube growth 
by modulating the actin cytoskeleton and controlling the cytosolic Ca(2+) 
concentration.

Cytosolic free calcium ([Ca(2+)]cyt), which is essential during pollen 
germination and pollen tube growth, can be sensed by calmodulin-like proteins 
(CMLs). The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes over 50 CMLs, the physiological 
role(s) of most of which are unknown. Here we show that the gene AtCML24 acts as 
a regulator of pollen germination and pollen tube extension, since the pollen 
produced by loss-of-function mutants germinated less rapidly than that of 
wild-type (WT) plants, the rate of pollen tube extension was slower, and the 
final length of the pollen tube was shorter. The [Ca(2+)]cyt within germinated 
pollen and extending pollen tubes produced by the cml24 mutant were higher than 
their equivalents in WT plants, and pollen tube extension was less sensitive to 
changes in external [K(+)] and [Ca(2+)]. The pollen and pollen tubes produced by 
cml24 mutants were characterized by a disorganized actin cytoskeleton and 
lowered sensitivity to the action of latrunculin B. The observations support an 
interaction between CML24 and [Ca(2+)]cyt and an involvement of CML24 in actin 
organization, thereby affecting pollen germination and pollen tube elongation.

BACKGROUND: Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are ubiquitous in green plants. AGPs 
comprise a widely varied group of hydroxyproline (Hyp)-rich cell surface 
glycoproteins (HRGPs). However, the more narrowly defined classical AGPs 
massively predominate and cover the plasma membrane. Extensive glycosylation by 
pendant polysaccharides O-linked to numerous Hyp residues like beads of a 
necklace creates a unique ionic compartment essential to a wide range of 
physiological processes including germination, cell extension and fertilization. 
The vital clue to a precise molecular function remained elusive until the recent 
isolation of small Hyp-arabinogalactan polysaccharide subunits; their structural 
elucidation by nuclear magentic resonance imaging, molecular simulations and 
direct experiment identified a 15-residue consensus subunit as a β-1,3-linked 
galactose trisaccharide with two short branched sidechains each with a single 
glucuronic acid residue that binds Ca(2+) when paired with its adjacent 
sidechain.
SCOPE: AGPs bind Ca(2+) (Kd ∼ 6 μm) at the plasma membrane (PM) at pH ∼5·5 but 
release it when auxin-dependent PM H(+)-ATPase generates a low periplasmic pH 
that dissociates AGP-Ca(2+) carboxylates (pka ∼3); the consequential large 
increase in free Ca(2+) drives entry into the cytosol via Ca(2+) channels that 
may be voltage gated. AGPs are thus arguably the primary source of cytosolic 
oscillatory Ca(2+) waves. This differs markedly from animals, in which cytosolic 
Ca(2+) originates mostly from internal stores such as the sarcoplasmic 
reticulum. In contrast, we propose that external dynamic Ca(2+) storage by a 
periplasmic AGP capacitor co-ordinates plant growth, typically involving 
exocytosis of AGPs and recycled Ca(2+), hence an AGP-Ca(2+) oscillator.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel concept of dynamic Ca(2+) recycling by an AGP-Ca(2+) 
oscillator solves the long-standing problem of a molecular-level function for 
classical AGPs and thus integrates three fields: AGPs, Ca(2+) signalling and 
auxin. This accounts for the involvement of AGPs in plant morphogenesis, 
including tropic and nastic movements.

This article deals with the study "Competencies in later life" (CiLL), a 
parallel study to the German program for the international assessment of adult 
competencies (PIAAC) survey which assesses the level and distribution of skills 
of the adult population in a representative study. Assuming the growing 
importance of learning and education in a society challenged by demographic 
changes, the first section of the paper outlines the qualitative research of 
learning activities of focus groups in the daily life of elderly people. The 
second section of the paper presents the survey design and exemplary findings of 
the quantitative CiLL study. Initial results show that basic skills of the 
elderly are highly influenced by personal and sociodemographic variables, 
particularly by educational background. The data available indicate that the 
participation of the elderly in adult education and the options available for 
competence development have to be increased.

Imatinib has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We 
evaluated clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness, using Swedish registry data 
based on patients with CML diagnosed 1973-2008. Outcome from three time periods 
(I: 1973-1979; II: 1991-1997; III: 2002-2008) associated with symptomatic 
treatment, interferon-α/stem cell transplant and implementation of imatinib, 
respectively, were compared and a lifetime cost-effectiveness model developed. 
Survival data from population registries, estimated resource use from clinical 
practice and quality of life estimates were employed. Substantial health gains 
were noted over time, paralleled by increased treatment costs. Median survival 
was 1.9, 4.0 and 13 years during the respective time periods. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between periods III and II was €52,700 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. An estimated 80% price reduction of 
imatinib, related to patent expiry, would reduce this ICER to €22,700. Our data 
from four decades reveal dramatically improved survival in CML, paralleled by 
ICER levels generally accepted by health authorities.

The life expectancy for HIV-positive individuals has improved over time due to 
increasing access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Yet, as the 
HIV-positive population ages, their risk of developing cancers also increases. 
Studies of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) among elderly HIV-infected persons are quite 
limited. We examined the age patterns of KS incidence and an association between 
age and KS risk in a US cohort of 3458 HIV-infected men, the Multicenter AIDS 
Cohort Study (MACS). Poisson distribution was used to calculate incidence rates 
and respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Cox proportional hazards 
regression was performed to examine the association between age and KS risk. 
There were 534 incident KS cases with a total follow-up time of 25,134 
person-years. The overall KS incidence rate was 2.13 per 100 person-years (95% 
CI: 1.95-2.32) (Non-HAART users-ever: 5.57 per 100 person-years [95% CI: 
5.09-6.10]; HAART users-ever: 0.39 per 100 person-years [95% CI: 0.31-0.51]). 
Overall, KS frequency and incidence declined with age, even in the oldest age 
group (p(trend) < 0.0001). However, among non-HAART users-ever, the oldest age 
group had the highest incidence rate ratio compared to younger individuals 
[15.01, 95% CI: 6.12-44.22]). While the incidence of KS decreased with age, 
older HIV-infected persons who do not receive HAART are still at increased risk 
of KS. As KS remains an important malignancy among HIV-infected persons, earlier 
HIV diagnoses and HAART initiation, particularly in older HIV-infected persons 
is warranted.

University of Birmingham, Edgbaston B15 2TT, United Kingdom; and University of 
Leeds School of Medicine (P.M.S.), Leeds LS2 9NL, United Kingdom.

CONTEXT: Central hypoadrenalism is a frequent complication of pituitary and 
hypothalamic pathology and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. 
Optimal exogenous glucocorticoid use is dependent on the use of appropriate 
diagnostic tests and careful assessment of the clinical response to 
glucocorticoid replacement therapy.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A PubMed search for the terms central hypoadrenalism, ACTH 
deficiency, glucocorticoid suppression, and glucocorticoid replacement was 
conducted; the papers identified and the references listed were used to build a 
reference list.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The published literature was assessed to present a summary 
of the available evidence with regard to etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of 
central hypoadrenalism.
CONCLUSIONS: A functional hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis is essential for 
normal health and life expectancy; its complexity presents challenges to the 
clinician in the identification of patients and in the maintenance of such 
patients in a glucocorticoid-sufficient state. The most common cause of central 
hypoadrenalism remains exogenous glucocorticoid use. Further research in this 
field should be directed toward disease prevention by minimizing glucocorticoid 
exposure and toward the identification of a biomarker for glucocorticoid 
sufficiency that will aid clinicians in optimizing treatment.
