Infants and children with complex chronic diseases have lifelong, 
life-threatening conditions and for many, early death is an unavoidable outcome 
of their disease process. But not all chronic diseases in children are fatal 
when treated well. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is more common in children with 
chronic diseases than in healthy children. Resuscitation of infants and children 
presents significant challenges to physicians and healthcare providers. 
Primarily, these situations occur only rarely and are therefore not only 
medically demanding but also associated with emotional stress. In case of 
resuscitation in infants and children with chronic diseases these challenges 
become much more complex. The worldwide valid Pediatric Advanced Life Support 
Guidelines do not give clear recommendations how to deal with periarrest 
situations in chronically ill infants and children. For relevant life-limiting 
illnesses, a "do not resuscitate" order should be discussed early, taking into 
account medical, ethical, and emotional considerations. The decision to 
terminate resuscitative efforts in cardiopulmonary arrest in infants and 
children with chronic illnesses such as severe lung disease, heart disease, or 
even incurable cancer is complex and controversial among physicians and parents. 
Judging the "outcome" of resuscitation as a "good" outcome becomes complex 
because for some, life extension itself and for others, quality of life is a 
goal. Physicians often decide that a healthy child is more likely to have a 
reversible condition and thereby have a better outcome than a child with 
multiple comorbidities and chronic health care needs. Major challenges in 
resuscitation infants and children are that clinicians need to individualize 
resuscitation strategies in light of each chronic disease, anatomy and 
physiology. This review aims to highlight terms of resuscitation infants and 
children with complex chronic diseases, considering resuscitation-related 
factors, parent-related factors, patient-related factors, and physician-related 
factors.

and COL3A1 duplication mutation without alteration in the [Gly-X-Y] repeat 
sequence.

Background: Vascular-type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is an autosomal dominant 
inherited disorder caused by a deficit in collagen III as a result of 
heterogeneous mutations in the α1 type III collagen gene (COL3A1). Patients with 
vEDS often experience the first major complications in their early 20s and >80% 
have at least one complication by their 40s, reducing their average life 
expectancy to 48 years. Most commonly, vEDS variants are heterozygous missense 
substitutions of a base-pair encoding a glycine (Gly) residue of the [Gly-X-Y] 
repeat of the COL3A1 protein. When a peptide chain derived from a mutant allele 
is present in the procollagen triple helical structure, the helical structure 
cannot be maintained. Therefore, typically, the mutated collagen peptide induces 
a dominant negative effect on procollagen production. We reported the case of a 
patient with vEDS and a unique novel duplication mutation without alteration in 
the [Gly-X-Y] triplet repeat sequence. Case presentation: A 58-year-old man 
developed a sudden disorder of consciousness and abdominal pain and was 
consequently taken to a nearby hospital, where an intra-abdominal aneurysm was 
found, in addition to mild small joint hypermobility and acrogeria. There has 
been no history of spontaneous pneumothorax, dislocation, or subcutaneous 
hematoma. The analysis of genomic DNA from a blood sample identified a likely 
pathogenic in-frame duplication mutation in the COL3A1 gene coding region. 
Interestingly, this mutation is not expected to alter the [Gly-X-Y] triplet 
repeat sequence. We verified the mutation's pathogenicity by performing an 
analysis of synthetic procollagen from cultured skin fibroblasts, electron 
microscopy, and mRNA expression analysis of unfolded protein response sensors 
for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Conclusion: Although the clinical 
findings of the case were mild, when compared to typical vEDS, decreased α1 
collagen III levels and morphological abnormalities of the collagenous bundles 
were observed in the patient samples when compared with the normal control 
samples. Our evidence supports the conclusion that this variant is pathogenic. 
However, unlike the common vEDS, ER stress was not observed, and the mild 
phenotype presentation was suggested to be due to the unique mutation, allowing 
the triple helical structure to be maintained to a certain extent.

INTRODUCTION: There is a scarcity of epidemiological data on neurodegenerative 
diseases (NDs) in East Africa. This meta-analysis provides the regional 
prevalence of NDs, their contributing factors, and evidence of change over time 
concerning gender per age or year.
METHODS: Articles were retrieved from electronic databases following the PRISMA 
standard.
RESULTS: Forty-two studies were reviewed, and 25 were meta-analyzed with a 
random-effects model. The pool estimate proportion of 15.27%, 95% CI (0.09-0.23) 
(I2 = 98.25%), (Q = 1,369.15, p < 0.0001) among a population of 15,813 
male/female and 1,257 with NDs. Epidemiological characteristics associated with 
NDs include Dyskinesias prevalence 55.4%, 95% CI (13.5; 90.9), I2 (96%) and 
subsistence farming prevalence 11.3%, 95% CI (5.8; 20.9), I2 (99%). Publication 
bias by Egger test was (z = 4.1913, p < 0.0001), while rank correlation test 
using Kendall's model was (tau = 0.1237, p = 0.3873). Heterogeneity (R2 design = 
5.23%, p design < 0.0001; R2 size = 52.163%, p size < 0.001; and R2 period = 
48.13, p period < 0.0001. Covariates (R2 design + size + period = 48.41%, p < 
0.001).
CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of NDs in the East African region, which 
could impact life expectancy, morbidity, and quality of life. Thus, early 
screening and regular surveillance could assist in management strategies.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of individuals with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome, 
DS) has risen to more than 60 years over the past few decades. As a result, 
diseases arising in mid and later life have become an issue of major concern in 
the care of individuals with DS. This article discusses and summarizes, from a 
multidisciplinary perspective, the diseases commonly affecting this population.
METHODS: This narrative review is based on publications identified by a 
selective literature search, extrapolation of the available evidence, and the 
authors' personal experience.
RESULTS: Robust epidemiological evidence indicates that many different diseases, 
which are dealt with by many different medical specialties, are more common in 
individuals with DS. The genetic background of some of these diseases is now 
understood down to the molecular level, e.g., primary hypothyroidism or 
Alzheimer's disease in DS. Recent gains in epidemiological and 
pathophysiological understanding contrast with a dearth of evidence on treatment 
for most of these disorders.
CONCLUSION: In view of the complexity of DS-associated morbidity, it would be 
desirable for DS-specific multidisciplinary care to be made available to 
patients with DS.

BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed to present mortality indicators from a 
database of death causes by age and sex in Navarre (Spain) for 2020: life 
expectancy at birth, excess mortality, and mortality from COVID-19 and other 
causes.
METHODS: A Poisson regression model, which accounts for temporal trends in the 
previous years, was used to estimate the expected deaths by sex and age for 
2020.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth in Navarre for 2020 was 80.6 and 85.9 years 
for men and women, respectively, 1.4 and 1.0 years lower than in 2019. Deaths in 
people aged <55 years were similar to those expected. The highest adjusted 
excess mortality rate occurred among men and women aged >85 years, were 61% of 
excess deaths was concentrated. The estimated number of excess deaths did not 
exceed the number of reported deaths from COVID-19. In individuals aged >75 
years, around 9 out of 10 people died from COVID-19. Coinciding with the 
COVID-19 pandemic, there was a remarkable decrease in mortality in people 
affected by diseases where dementia is included.
CONCLUSIONS: The first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced life 
expectancy at birth to figures observed ten years ago. The increase in deaths in 
Navarre for 2020 is largely attributable to COVID-19.

FUNDAMENTO: El objetivo del estudio fue presentar varios indicadores de 
mortalidad obtenidos de la base de datos de causas de muerte por edad y sexo de 
Navarra en 2020: esperanza de vida al nacer, exceso de mortalidad y mortalidad 
por COVID-19 y por otras causas de muerte.
MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: Se utilizó un modelo de regresión de Poisson que tiene en 
cuenta las tendencias temporales en los años previos para estimar las muertes 
esperadas por sexo y edad en 2020.
RESULTADOS: La esperanza de vida al nacer en 2020 fue de 80,6 años en los 
hombres y 85,9 años en las mujeres, 1,4 y 1,0 años mas baja, respectivamente, 
que en 2019. No se observó un exceso de mortalidad por debajo de los 55 años. 
Las tasas ajustadas de exceso de mortalidad más altas se registraron en los 
hombres y mujeres de 85 y más años entre los que se concentraron el 61% del 
exceso de muertes. Los fallecimientos por COVID-19 superaron el número de exceso 
de muertes estimado. Los mayores de 75 años fueron el subgrupo de población 
donde se produjeron aproximadamente 9 de cada 10 muertes por COVID-19. 
Coincidiendo con la pandemia de COVID-19 se produjo un llamativo descenso de las 
tasas de mortalidad por el grupo de enfermedades donde está incluida la 
demencia.
CONCLUSIÓN: La primera y segunda ondas de la pandemia de COVID-19 redujeron la 
esperanza de vida al nacer a las cifras observadas diez años atrás. El 
incremento de fallecimientos en 2020 en Navarra es en gran parte atribuible a 
COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: To determine atrial fibrillation (AF) prevalence and temporal trends, 
and examine associations between AF and risk of adverse health outcomes in older 
care home residents.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using anonymised linked data from the Secure 
Anonymised Information Linkage Databank on CARE home residents in Wales with AF 
(SAIL CARE-AF) between 2003 and 2018. Fine-Gray competing risk models were used 
to estimate the risk of health outcomes with mortality as a competing risk. Cox 
regression analyses were used to estimate the risk of mortality.
RESULTS: There were 86,602 older care home residents (median age 86.0 years 
[interquartile range 80.8-90.6]) who entered a care home between 2003 and 2018. 
When the pre-care home entry data extraction was standardised, the overall 
prevalence of AF was 17.4% (95% confidence interval 17.1-17.8) between 2010 and 
2018. There was no significant change in the age- and sex-standardised 
prevalence of AF from 16.8% (15.9-17.9) in 2010 to 17.0% (16.1-18.0) in 2018. 
Residents with AF had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular mortality 
(adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.27 [1.17-1.37], P < 0.001), all-cause mortality 
(adjusted HR 1.14 [1.11-1.17], P < 0.001), ischaemic stroke (adjusted 
sub-distribution HR 1.55 [1.36-1.76], P < 0.001) and cardiovascular 
hospitalisation (adjusted sub-distribution HR 1.28 [1.22-1.34], P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Older care home residents with AF have an increased risk of adverse 
health outcomes, even when higher mortality rates and other confounders are 
accounted for. This re-iterates the need for appropriate oral anticoagulant 
prescription and optimal management of cardiovascular co-morbidities, 
irrespective of frailty status and predicted life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of dumbbell jugular foramen schwannomas can be 
challenging. The main goals of surgery are maximal resection with preservation 
of function and overall patient quality of life.
METHODS: In this paper, we present a step-by-step technical description of a 
microsurgical resection of dumbbell-shaped JF schwannoma using a modified 
retrosigmoid infra-jugular approach.
CONCLUSION: The modified retrosigmoid infra-jugular is a safe and suitable 
approach in selected cases. This technique, however, must be limited only to 
those tumors with minimal extension into the jugular foramen.

The presented work analyzes the energy prices, climate shock, and health 
deprivation nexus in the BRICS economies for the period 1995-2020. Panel 
ARDL-PMG technique is used to reveal the underexplored linkages. The long-run 
estimates of energy prices are observed to be negatively significant to the 
health expenditure and life expectancy model, whereas, positively significant to 
the climate change model. These findings suggest that energy prices 
significantly reduce health expenditures and life expectancy and, thus, increase 
the death rate in the BRICS economies. The long-run country-wise estimate of 
energy prices is found negatively significant in case of Brazil, India, China, 
and South Africa. Alongside, the group-wise significance of CO2 emissions is 
discovered to be negatively, positively, and insignificant in the cases of life 
expectancy, death rate, and health expenditure models, respectively. Besides, 
country-wise long-run estimate of CO2 emissions witnesses negative significance 
for Russia, India, China, and South Africa.

OBJECTIVES: Improved life expectancy has increased the prevalence of older 
adults living with multimorbidity which likely deteriorates their health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL). However, relatively little is known about patterns and 
the relationships of multimorbidity by HRQoL status in older adults.
METHODS: Individuals aged 65 or older from the Korea National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey V-VII (2010-2018) were analyzed. HRQoL was assessed 
by the EuroQoL-5 dimensions questionnaire and categorized as poor, normal, or 
good. The impact of multimorbidity on HRQoL was evaluated using logistic 
regression. The patterns and inter-relationships between multimorbidity, 
stratified by HRQoL groups, were analyzed using the association rules and 
network analysis approach.
RESULTS: Multimorbidity was significantly associated with poor HRQoL (3 or more 
diseases vs. none; adjusted odds ratio, 2.70; 95% confidence interval, 2.10 to 
3.46). Hypertension, arthritis, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes were the most 
prevalent diseases across all HRQoL groups. Complex interrelationships of 
morbidities, higher prevalence, and node strengths in all diseases were observed 
in the poor HRQoL group, particularly for arthritis, depression, and stroke, 
compared to other groups (1.5-3.0 times higher, p<0.05 for all). Apart from 
hypertension, arthritis and hyperlipidemia had a higher prevalence and stronger 
connections with other diseases in females, whereas this was the case for 
diabetes and stroke in males with poor HRQoL.
CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity patterns formed complicatedly inter-correlated 
disease networks in the poor HRQoL group with differences according to sex. 
These findings enhance the understanding of multimorbidity connections and 
provide information on the healthcare needs of older adults, especially those 
with poor HRQoL.

Injectable, thermosensitive hydrogels, constructed from cross-linked polymers, 
can offset the limitations of other sustained release delivery systems, overcome 
constrains of available therapies, and improve patient compliance to chronic 
therapy. The goal of this project was to identify and evaluate such sustained 
release, in situ formulations that can help achieve prolonged exposure of 
protein therapeutics with a short systemic half-life. Natural polymers were used 
to develop injectable, thermosensitive in situ hydrogels and single-chain 
variable fragment (scFv) of trastuzumab was used as the model protein with a 
short half-life. The three polymer combinations tested were: (1) Chitosan and 
β-glycerophosphate, (2) Chitosan, β-glycerophosphate, and Hyaluronic Acid, and 
(3) Hyaluronic Acid and Dextran. In vitro drug release experiments were 
conducted, using different combinations of various polymer concentrations and 
different drug loading amounts, to identify optimal combinations with prolonged 
and controlled drug release while exhibiting minimal burst release effect. 
Select formulations were injected subcutaneously in normal mice to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics of scFv for 14 days and identify drug release kinetics in vivo. 
A two-compartment PK model was also established to quantitatively characterize 
the release kinetics and disposition of scFv following in vivo administration of 
the hydrogels. The scFv was undetectable in plasma after 4 and 24 hours 
following intravenous and subcutaneous administration, respectively. However, 
all three hydrogel systems were found to provide controlled release of scFv in 
vivo and maintain detectable concentrations of scFv for at least 14 days. The 
results suggested that subcutaneous injection of thermosensitive in situ 
hydrogels may be used to achieve sustained exposure of protein therapeutics 
which have a very short half-life and thus require frequent administration.

BACKGROUND: Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) causes degenerative changes 
warranting total hip arthroplasty (THA) in approximately 50% of patients by age 
60 years. For severe SCFE, a reorienting intertrochanteric osteotomy (ITO) 
following in situ pinning (ISP) can decrease impingement with hip flexion, but 
by altering proximal femoral geometry, complicates subsequent conversion THA. We 
hypothesized that increasing implant survivorship would affect the most 
cost-effective treatment strategy (ISP followed by ITO [ISP + ITO] with later 
THA versus ISP alone [ISPa] with earlier THA) over a patient's lifetime.
METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was constructed to analyze the 
cost-effectiveness of either ISPa or ISP + ITO over a 60-year time horizon for 
children who have severe, stable SCFE. Transition probabilities associated with 
implant and native hip survivorship, state utilities, and costs were derived 
from the literature. Sensitivity analyses assessed the model robustness. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were compared to a societal 
willingness to pay (WTP) of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).
RESULTS: Over a 60-year horizon, ISPa was costlier ($291,836) than ISP + ITO 
($75,227) but achieved overall better outcomes (51.4 QALYs ISPa versus 48.7 
QALYs ISP + ITO), rendering ISPa cost-effective with an ICER of $80,980/QALY. 
Implant survivorship and time horizon were sensitive variables.
CONCLUSION: Based upon current implant performance, ISPa with subsequent earlier 
THA is cost-effective when considering an individual's life expectancy and 
thereby deserves consideration in patients who have severe SCFE. Without clear 
level 1 clinical data, our economic model considers a difficult problem, while 
providing families and clinicians with a framework for understanding treatment 
options.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and decision analysis, Level III.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical and radiographic characteristics of hip joint 
deformities in children with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), and the evolution 
of hip joint deformities in affected infants for the first 3 years of life.
STUDY DESIGN: This prospective observational study evaluated orthopedic clinical 
examinations performed every 3 months to assess hip flexion and extension, 
lateral and medial rotation, and abduction and adduction, as well as lower limb 
muscle length and tone. The biannual radiograph comprised anteroposterior 
panoramic pelvic radiographs with the lower limbs in extension. Percentage of 
migration was used as a radiographic study tool to measure and evaluate linear 
hip displacement.
RESULTS: From November 2018 to March 2020, we followed 30 children with CZS, of 
whom 15 (50%) had normal pelvic radiographs on admission; 5 (33.3%) developed 
hip displacement by the second radiograph examination. During follow-up 
radiographic examinations, 20 of the 30 children (66.7%) were diagnosed with hip 
displacement and/or dislocation of at least 1 side, and 10 of the 30 (33.3%) 
remained normal. Among 30 affected patients, 13 (43.3%) had hip displacement on 
the right side and 9 (30%) on the left side. Logistic regression analysis 
revealed that spasticity (P = .0033; OR, 15.9) and ophthalmologic abnormalities 
(P = .0163; OR, 16.9) were associated with hip dislocation during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic radiographic follow-up for all children with CZS will 
complement physical examination, diagnosis, and monitoring for hip joint 
deformities.

For life science infrastructures, sensitive data generate an additional layer of 
complexity. Cross-domain categorisation and discovery of digital resources 
related to sensitive data presents major interoperability challenges. To support 
this FAIRification process, a toolbox demonstrator aiming at support for 
discovery of digital objects related to sensitive data (e.g., regulations, 
guidelines, best practice, tools) has been developed. The toolbox is based upon 
a categorisation system developed and harmonised across a cluster of 6 life 
science research infrastructures. Three different versions were built, tested by 
subsequent pilot studies, finally leading to a system with 7 main categories 
(sensitive data type, resource type, research field, data type, stage in data 
sharing life cycle, geographical scope, specific topics). 109 resources attached 
with the tags in pilot study 3 were used as the initial content for the toolbox 
demonstrator, a software tool allowing searching of digital objects linked to 
sensitive data with filtering based upon the categorisation system. Important 
next steps are a broad evaluation of the usability and user-friendliness of the 
toolbox, extension to more resources, broader adoption by different life-science 
communities, and a long-term vision for maintenance and sustainability.

Individuals with high levels of blood-injection-injury (BII) fears are more 
likely to avoid health screenings, vaccination, and even minor medical 
interventions. This could result in more serious health issues, lower quality of 
life, and even shorter life expectancy. However, still little is known about how 
various emotions (i.e., fear and disgust) affect subjective evaluation on 
phobia-related stimuli, and what are the potential risk and protective factors 
that may change the perception of such stimuli throughout these emotions. We 
investigated the role of fear of medical interventions and the degree of disgust 
sensitivity in the evaluation of BII phobia-related content and whether previous 
relevant experience and age may provide protection against the development of a 
phobia. We collected online survey data from multiple university sources. 
Participants (N = 228) completed measures of medical fear, disgust sensitivity, 
prior relevant experience and medical knowledge. Participants were also asked to 
rate images related to medical settings on dimensions of valence, arousal, 
disgust, and threat. Our results suggest that high disgust sensitivity and fear 
of medical interventions may be a risk factor for avoiding medical settings. 
However, previous relevant medical experience may function as protective factor. 
The pandemic of recent years underscored the importance of medical intervention 
and screening tests. These results have implications for professionals helping 
(e.g., as counselors) people with BII phobia, and physicians and nurses in 
informing and treating patients.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether the cost-effectiveness of an 
infant sleep intervention from the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) 
trial was influenced by socioeconomic position (SEP).
METHODS: An SEP-specific economic evaluation of the sleep intervention was 
conducted. SEP-specific intervention costs and effects at age 5 years, derived 
from the trial data, were applied to a representative cohort of 4,898 4- to 
5-year-old Australian children. Quality-adjusted life years and health care 
costs were simulated until age 17 years using a purpose-built SEP-specific 
model. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and acceptability curves were 
derived for each SEP group.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, in Australian dollars per 
quality-adjusted life year gained, were smaller in the low- ($23,010) and 
mid-SEP ($18,206) groups compared with the high-SEP group ($31,981). The 
probability that the intervention was cost-effective was very high in the low- 
and mid-SEP groups (92%-100%) and moderately high in the high-SEP group (79%).
CONCLUSIONS: An infant sleep intervention is more cost-effective in low- and 
mid-SEP groups compared with high-SEP groups. Targeting this intervention to 
low-SEP groups would not require trade-offs between efficiency and equity.

Green agriculture has become the &quot;wind vane&quot; of agricultural reform in 
the new era. The development concept of Chinese materia medica(CMM) ecological 
agriculture and the emergence of new technologies provide momentum for the 
supply of high-quality green ecological products. As special ecological 
products, Dao-di herbs have medicinal, economic, ecological, and cultural 
values. The ecological planting of CMM and the value realization of ecological 
products are of great significance for the high-quality development of CMM 
agriculture and for prospering agriculture by improving quality. Therefore, this 
paper reviews the development status and typical cases, and puts forward the 
advantages of ecological product value realization of Dao-di herbs. On this 
basis, a value accounting system for ecological products of CMM was constructed 
from three aspects: supply services, ecological services, and cultural services. 
Finally, the suggestions for realizing the value of CMM ecological products are 
put forward.(1)It is suggested to strengthen the practice of ecological planting 
and production of CMM, and innovate the value realization model of ecological 
products.(2)The ecological planting bases of Dao-di herbs should be constructed 
to enhance the supply capacity of high-quality ecological products.(3)The 
quality and safety of ecological CMM should be improved to create the ecological 
planting brand of Dao-di herbs.(4)The ecological product value system and 
mechanism should be improved for realizing the value of CMM ecological 
products.(5)The education and publicity should be strengthened to raise the 
public awareness of the value of CMM ecological products.

Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) may increase the risk of 
neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. However, little is 
known about the trends of PM2.5-related neonatal encephalopathy burden under 
different levels of social and economic development. We studied the burden of 
PM2.5-related neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma measured 
by the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and the age-standardized 
disability-adjusted life years rate (ASDR), and its trends with the 
socio-demographic index (SDI) in 192 countries and regions from 1990 to 2019. 
This is a retrospective study using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 
(GBD2019) database. The age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and 
age-standardized disability-adjusted life years rate (ASDR) are used to measure 
the burden of PM2.5-related neonatal encephalopathy in different countries and 
regions. The mortality rate (per 100 thousand) is used to evaluate the 
differences of PM2.5-related neonatal encephalopathy burden in sex and age. The 
annual percentage changes (APCs) and the average annual percentage changes 
(AAPCs) are used to reflect the trends of PM2.5-related neonatal encephalopathy 
burden over years (1990-2019) and are calculated using a Joinpoint model. The 
relationship of the socio-demographic index with the ASMR and ASDR is calculated 
using Gaussian process regression. In summary, the global burden of 
PM2.5-related neonatal encephalopathy increased since 1990, especially in boys, 
early neonates, and regions with low-middle SDI. Globally, the ASMR and ASDR of 
PM2.5-related neonatal encephalopathy burden in 2019 were 0.59 (95% CI: 0.40, 
0.83) per 100,000 people and 52.59 (95% CI: 35.33, 73.67) per 100,000 people, 
respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the ASMR and ASDR of PM2.5-related neonatal 
encephalopathy increased by 44.39% and 44.19%, respectively. The global average 
annual percentage changes of ASMR and ASDR were 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0, 1.6). The 
relationship between the socio-demographic index and the burden of PM2.5-related 
neonatal encephalopathy presented negative correlation when the 
socio-demographic index was more than 0.60. Middle, high-middle, and high SDI 
regions had decreasing trends of PM2.5-related neonatal encephalopathy, of which 
the AAPCs for both ASMR and ASDR ranged from - 0.3 to - 3.1. Besides improving 
the progress in national policy and the coverage rate of maternal and neonatal 
health care and facility-based delivery, air pollution control may also be a 
better way for countries with large and increasing amounts of exposure to PM2.5 
pollution to reduce neonatal encephalopathy. And our results also suggest that 
low and low-middle SDI countries should appropriately pay more attention to 
early newborns and boys.

OBJECTIVES: A number of deprescribing tools are available to assist clinicians 
to make decisions on medication management. We aimed to review deprescribing 
tools that may be used with older adults that have limited life expectancy 
(LLE), including those at the palliative and end-of-life stage, and consider the 
rigour with which the tools were developed and validated.
KEY FINDINGS: Literature was searched in PubMed, Embase, CINHAL and Google 
Scholar until February 2021 for studies involving the development and/or 
consensus validation of deprescribing tools targeting those aged ≥65 years with 
LLE. We were interested in the tool development process, tool validation process 
and clinical components addressed by the tool.Six studies were included. The 
approaches followed for tool development were systematic review (n = 3), 
expert-literature review (n = 2) and concept data (n = 1). The content included 
a list of disease-non-specific medications divided with or without 
recommendations (n = 4) and disease-specific medications with recommendations (n 
= 2). The tool validation was performed using the Delphi method (n = 4) or GRADE 
framework (n = 2) with panel size ranging from 8 to 17 and 60-80% consensus 
agreement with or without a rating scale. LLE targeted were ≤1 year (n = 2) or 
≤3 months (n = 1).
SUMMARY: There is a limited number of deprescribing tools with consensus 
validation available for use in older adults with LLE. These tools are either 
targeted for disease-specific medication/medication class guided by the GRADE 
framework or targeted for a list of medications or medication classes 
irrespective of disease that are developed using a combination of approaches and 
validated using a Delphi method.
