BACKGROUND: Implantable electronic cardiac devices (CIED) have emerged as an 
essential component in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. 
Due to increased life expectancy, expanding indications and limited technical 
survival, an increasing number of revision procedures can be anticipated. Venous 
access site occlusion (VASO) is the main obstacle during revision surgery. In 
this retrospective study we evaluated the prevalence, predictive parameters and 
operative management of venous access site occlusion.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 01/2016 and 12/2020 304 patients underwent lead 
revision surgery of transvenous CIED in our department. Prevalence of VASO was 
25.7% (n = 78), one patient was symptomatic. Independent predicting clinical 
parameters were male sex (2.86 (1.39-5.87), p < 0.01) and lead age (1.11 
(1.05-1.18), p < 0.01)). Revision surgery despite VASO was successful in 97.4% 
(n = 76) without prolongation of the total surgery time or higher complication 
rates. Yet, lead extraction was possible in 92% of patients with VASO vs. 98.2% 
of patients without VASO (p 0.01).
CONCLUSION: VASO is a frequent condition in patients undergoing lead revision 
surgery, but successful revision is feasible in most cases without preceding 
lead extraction. However, the lower success rates of lead extractions may be 
prognostically relevant, especially for younger patients.

The state of Goiás and the Federal District together cover an area of about 346 
thousand km2, including the diversified Cerrado vegetation, also known as the 
Brazilian Savanna, a biodiversity hotspot with many endangered and endemic 
species. Much of the Cerrado has been converted to agriculture, but little is 
known of its earthworms, and the impacts of land use management and agricultural 
practices on their density and diversity. In the present paper we review the 
known earthworm species in Goiás and the Federal District based on historical 
and museum records, and update information on their distribution and populations 
in different counties and land use systems with data from recent samplings. Five 
additional species are reported here for the first time, raising the total to 12 
species currently known from Goiás, from the families Benhamiidae (1), 
Glossoscolecidae (1), Megascolecidae (3), Ocnerodrilidae (2) and Rhinodrilidae 
(5). In the Federal District, an additional 10 species are reported, bringing 
the total to 23 earthworm species, belonging to the families Benhamiidae (4), 
Eudrilidae (1), Glossoscolecidae (2), Ocnerodrilidae (1), Lumbricidae (2), 
Megascolecidae (1) and Rhinodrilidae (12). Native species in Goiás (6) were 
found in areas with lesser disturbance, such as in native forest and flooded 
areas/river banks, a phenomenon also observed in the Federal District. On the 
other hand, the exotic and peregrine species found in Goiás (6) and in the 
Federal District (9) dominated in disturbed sites, such as perennial crops, 
agroforestry, annual crops, urban areas, secondary forests, pastures and 
agropastoral systems, among others. Given the many new species found and the 
extension of Goiás and the Federal District, further effort is needed to 
adequately characterize the earthworm fauna of the region, from where many other 
species are expected.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically analyse global, regional and national burden change 
of unintentional drowning from 1990 to 2019, and to further quantify the 
contribution of social determinants of health (SDH) on the change.
DESIGN: Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 were used in this 
study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Individuals of all ages and genders from 204 countries 
and territories.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcomes were the age-standardised rates (ASRs) 
of mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of unintentional 
drowning. The percentage change in the ASRs were used to estimate the joint 
effect of SDH on trends in global burden of drowning.
RESULTS: We observed that the global burden of unintentional drowning declined 
markedly from 1990 to 2019, with age-standardised mortality rate and DALYs rate 
decreasing by 61.5% and 68.2%, respectively. Women, children, middle 
Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) countries, South-East Asia and Western Pacific 
region had higher reduction. At national level, greater reductions were observed 
in Armenia and Republic of Korea, but significant increases in Cabo Verde and 
Vanuatu. We found that every one percentile increase in six SDHs (Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) per person, SDI, educational attainment, health spending, health 
workers and urbanisation) was associated with a decrease of 0.15% and 0.16% in 
drowning age-standardised mortality rate and DALYs rate globally, respectively. 
Health spending and GDP per capita were the main contributors to the reduction 
of drowning globally.
CONCLUSIONS: The global burden of unintentional drowning significantly declined 
in the past three decades, and the improvement of SDHs such as GDP per capita 
and health spending mainly contributed to the decrease. Our findings indicate 
that improvement of SDHs is critical for drowning prevention and control.

INTRODUCTION: There is no comparative evidence for relative motion extension 
(RME) orthosis with dynamic wrist-hand-finger-orthosis (WHFO) management of 
zones V-VI extensor tendon repairs.
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To determine if RME with wrist-hand-orthosis (RME plus) is 
noninferior to dynamic WHFO for these zones in clinical outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled non-inferiority trial.
METHODS: Skilled hand therapists managed 37 participants (95% male; mean age 39 
years, SD 18) with repaired zones V-VI extensor tendons randomized to RME plus 
(n = 19) or dynamic WHFO (n = 18). The primary outcome of percentage of total 
active motion (%TAM) and secondary outcomes of satisfaction, function, and 
quality of life were measured at week-6 and -12 postoperatively; percentage grip 
strength (%Grip), complication rates, and cost data at week-12. Following the 
intention-to-treat principle non-inferiority was assessed using linear 
regression analysis (5% significance) and adjusted for injury complexity factors 
with an analysis of costs performed.
RESULTS: RME plus was noninferior for %TAM at week-6 (adjusted estimates 2.5; 
95% CI -9.0 to 14.0), %TAM at week-12 (0.3; -6.8 to 7.5), therapy satisfaction 
at week-6 and -12, and orthosis satisfaction, QuickDASH, and %Grip at week-12. 
Per protocol analysis yielded 2 tendon ruptures in the RME plus orthoses and 1 
in the dynamic WHFO. There were no differences in health system and societal 
cost, or quality-adjusted life years.
DISCUSSION: RME plus orthosis wearers had greater injury complexity than those 
in dynamic WHFOs, with overall rupture rate for both groups comparatively more 
than reported by others; however, percentage %TAM was comparable. The number of 
participants needed was underestimated, so risk of chance findings should be 
considered.
CONCLUSIONS: RME plus management of finger zones V-VI extensor tendon repairs is 
non-inferior to dynamic WHFO in %TAM, therapy and orthotic satisfaction, 
QuickDASH, and %Grip. Major costs associated with this injury are related to 
lost work time.

OBJECTIVES: To compare mortality risk and life expectancy among individuals with 
different sleep durations and sleeping pill use.
METHODS: A cohort of 484,916 community-dwelling adults in Taiwan was recruited 
into a health screening program from 1994 to 2011. Subjects were categorized by 
daily sleep duration into 4 groups: extremely short (<4 hours), short 
(4-6 hours), medium (6-8 hours), and long (>8 hours). Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to investigate the associations of mortality risk with 
sleep duration and sleeping pill use. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic 
characteristics, lifestyle, and comorbidities. Life expectancy tables were 
calculated among sleeping pill users and nonusers with different sleep 
durations.
RESULTS: With 6- 8 hours of daily sleep, sleeping pill nonusers had the lowest 
mortality risk. Sleeping pill users, even with this optimal amount of sleep, had 
a 55% (p < .001, 95% CI, 1.38-1.73) higher mortality risk than nonusers. The 
life expectancy of 30-year-old male sleeping pill users with extremely short or 
long sleep durations was 12-13 years shorter than sleeping pill nonusers who had 
6-8 hours of sleep. On average, life expectancy in individuals using sleeping 
pills (vs. nonusers) was shorter by 5.3 (95% CI, 4.10-6.32) years in men and 5.7 
(95% CI, 5.28-7.98) years in women.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the use of sleeping pills is associated 
with an increased risk of mortality and shortened life expectancy, especially in 
extreme sleepers. Regular users should be aware of potential harms from sleeping 
pills.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
immunosuppressive therapy for patients with progressive idiopathic membranous 
nephropathy (IMN) from the Chinese healthcare system perspective.
METHODS: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of four regimens namely 
cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, rituximab and tacrolimus-rituximab in treatment 
of IMN recommended by the updated Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 
(KDIGO) guideline 2021, a Markov model with five discrete states (active 
disease, remission, dialysis, kidney transplant and death) based on IMN patients 
aged 50 or above over a 30-years time horizon was constructed. Total costs were 
imputed from the Chinese healthcare system perspective, and health outcomes were 
converted into quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used to describe the results. The 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at $12,044 (China's 2021 Gross 
Domestic Product per capita). Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the 
uncertainties of the results.
RESULT: Compared with cyclophosphamide, both cyclosporine (incremental cost 
$28,337.09, incremental QALY-1.63) and tacrolimus-rituximab (incremental cost 
$28,324.13, incremental QALY -0.46) were considered at strictly dominated for 
their negative values in QALYs, and the ICER value of rituximab was positive 
(incremental cost $9,162.19, incremental QALY 0.44). Since the ICER of rituximab 
exceeds the pre-determined threshold, cyclophosphamide was likely to be the best 
choice for the treatment of IMN within the acceptable threshold range. The 
results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that the model outcome was mostly 
affected by the probability of remission in rituximab. In a probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, cyclophosphamide had 62.4% probability of being 
cost-effective compared with other regimens when the WTP was $12,044 per QALY. 
When WTP exceeded $18,300, rituximab was more cost-effective than 
cyclophosphamide.
CONCLUSION: Compared with cyclosporine, rituximab and tacrolimus-rituximab, our 
model results indicated that cyclophosphamide represented the most 
cost-effective regimen for patients with progressive IMN in China.

Despite the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) significantly improved the 
efficacy and safety of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), particularly 
in a high-risk group of patients, the gap between PCI with his competitor's 
coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) and/or optimal medical treatment alone was 
not reduced. In this revision, we highlighted the fact that in recent years 
landmark randomized studies reported at mid and long-term follow-ups a high 
incidence of non-cardiac death, cancer incidence, or both in the DES group of 
patients. The overall incidence of non-cardiac death was significantly higher in 
the DES vs. the comparator arm: 5.5% and 3.8%, respectively, p = 0.000018, and 
non-cardiac death appears to be more divergent between DES vs. the comparator at 
the extended follow-up to expenses of the last one. One of these trials reported 
five times greater cancer incidence in the DES arm at late follow-up, 5% vs. 
0.7% p < 0.0018. We review the potential reason for these unexpected findings, 
although we can discard that DES biology could be involved in it. Until all 
these issues are resolved, we propose that DES implantation should be tailored 
accorded patient age, life expectancy, and lesion complexity.

Life expectancy and age-related diseases burden increased significantly over the 
past few decades. Age-related conditions are commonly discussed in a very 
limited paradigm of depleted cellular proliferation and maturation with 
exponential accumulation of senescent cells. However, most recent evidence 
showed that the majority of age-associated ailments, i.e., diabetes mellitus, 
cardiovascular diseases and neurodegeneration. These diseases are closely 
associated with tissue nonspecific inflammation triggered and controlled by 
mesenchymal stromal cell secretion. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are known 
as the most common type of cells for therapeutic approaches in clinical 
practice. Side effects and complications of MSC-based treatments increased 
interest in the MSCs secretome as an alternative concept for validation tests in 
regenerative medicine. The most recent data also proposed it as an ideal tool 
for cell-free regenerative therapy and tissue engineering. However, senescent 
MSCs secretome was shown to hold the role of 'key-driver' in inflammaging. We 
aimed to review the immunomodulatory effects of the MSCs-secretome during cell 
senescence and provide eventual insight into the interpretation of its 
beneficial biological actions in inflammaging-associated diseases.

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is an ultra-rare inborn error of metabolism 
characterised by painful phototoxic burn injuries after short exposure times to 
visible light. Patients with EPP are highly adapted to their condition which 
makes the quantification of their health-related quality of life (QoL) 
challenging. In the presented patient-initiated feasibility study, we describe a 
new approach to assess treatment benefits in EPP by measuring QoL with the 
generic EQ-5D instrument in five patients under long-term (≥two years) treatment 
with afamelanotide, the first approved therapy for EPP. For the study, we 
selected patients with EPP who in addition were affected by an involuntary 
treatment interruption (caused by a temporary reimbursement suspension) because 
we hypothesized that individuals who had previously unlearned their adaptation 
are better able to assess their life without treatment than treatment-naïve 
patients. QoL under treatment was comparable to the age-matched population norm, 
and retrospective results for a treatment interruption and phototoxic reaction 
time point were comparable to the QoL of patients with chronic neuropathic pain 
and acute burn injuries, respectively. The results were accepted by the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England for their evaluation of the 
cost-effectiveness of afamelanotide, i.e., the calculation of quality-adjusted 
life years.

Maintaining sufficient muscle strength is fundamental to prevent a decline in 
basic physical functions such as gait, and is therefore a prerequisite for a 
healthy independent life in older people. However, the relationship between gait 
parameters and the strength of single muscle groups is reported with 
inconclusive results. The objective of this study was to analyze the 
relationship of strength of nine single muscle groups of lower and upper leg 
muscles as well as handgrip strength for gait parameters in older adults. 
Sixty-nine independently living older adults participated in the study. Maximum 
ankle plantar- and dorsiflexion, knee flexion and extension, as well as hip 
abduction, adduction, flexion, and extension strength, were measured using an 
isokinetic dynamometer. Additionally, hand grip strength measured via a hand 
dynamometer was obtained. Walking gait parameters were recorded with a 3D motion 
capture system on an instrumented treadmill. The relationships between multiple 
strength and gait variables were analyzed by Pearson's correlation coefficient. 
Linear regression analyses were performed to identify the predictive ability of 
muscle strength (normalized to body weight) for gait speed, stride time, stance 
time, stride length and step width. Multiple significant weak to moderate 
positive ([r = 0.343, p = 0.047]-[r = 0.538, p = 0.002]) and negative ([r = 
-0.340, p = 0.046]-[r = 0.593, p = 0.001]) correlations that were unequally 
distributed between both sexes were detected. Significant regression models 
explained ([r2 = 16.6%, p = 0.015]-[r2 = 44.3 %, p = 0.003]) and ([r2 = 21.8%, p 
= 0.022]-[r2 = 36.1%, p = 0.044]) of the gait parameter variations for men and 
women, respectively. The results suggest a sex-specific relevance of single 
muscle groups for all gait parameters. This may be attributed to anatomical 
differences and it is important to prevent strength-related changes in gait 
parameters.

HIV anti-retrovirals (ARVs) have vastly improved the life expectancy of people 
living with HIV (PLWH). However, toxic effects attributed to long-term ARV use 
also contribute to HIV-related co-morbidities such as heart disease, bone loss 
and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Unfortunately, mouse models 
used to study the effects of ARVs on viral suppression, toxicity and HIV 
latency/tissue reservoirs have not been widely established. Here, we demonstrate 
an effective mouse model utilizing immune-compromised mice, reconstituted with 
infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs). ARVs areincorporated 
into mouse chow and administered daily with combination ARV regimens 
includingAtripla (efavirenz, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and emtricitabine) 
and Triumeq (abacavir, dolutegravir and lamivudine). This model measures 
HIV-infected human cell trafficking, and ARV penetration throughout most 
relevant HIV organs and plasma, with a large amount of trafficking to the 
secondary lymphoid organs. Furthermore, the HIV viral load within each organ and 
the plasma was reduced in ARV treated vs. untreated control. Overall, we have 
demonstrated a mouse model that is relatively easy and affordable to establish 
and utilize to study ARVs' effect on various tissues, including the co-morbid 
conditions associated with PLWH, such as HAND, and other toxic effects.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a highly prevalent autoimmune disease causing 
the destruction of pancreatic islet β-cells. The resulting insulin production 
deficiency leads to a lifelong need for insulin re-placement therapy, systemic 
complications, and reduced life quality and expectancy. Cell therapy has been 
extensively attempted to restore insulin independence (IID), and autologous 
nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHST) has appeared to 
give the most promising results, but with a highly variable quote of patients 
achieving IID across the studies. We performed a comprehensive review of the 
trials involving stem cells, and in particular AHST, for the treatment of T1DM. 
We then pooled the patients enrolled in the different trials and looked for the 
patient characteristics that could be associated with the achievement of IID. We 
found a significantly higher probability of achieving IID in older patients (OR 
1.17, 95%CI 1.06-1.33, p = 0.002) and a significantly lower probability in 
patients with a history of ketoacidosis (OR 0.23, 95%CI 0.06-0.78, p = 0.023). 
This suggests that there could be a population of patients more likely to 
benefit from AHST, but further data would be required to depict the profile of 
the ideal candidate.

Myocardial Infarction (MI) occurs due to a blockage in the coronary artery 
resulting in ischemia and necrosis of cardiomyocytes in the left ventricular 
heart muscle. The dying cardiac tissue is replaced with fibrous scar tissue, 
causing a decrease in myocardial contractility and thus affecting the functional 
capacity of the myocardium. Treatments, such as stent placements, cardiac 
bypasses, or transplants are beneficial but with many limitations, and may 
decrease the overall life expectancy due to related complications. In recent 
years, with the advent of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), newer 
avenues using cell-based approaches for the treatment of MI have emerged as a 
potential for cardiac regeneration. While hiPSCs and their derived 
differentiated cells are promising candidates, their translatability for 
clinical applications has been hindered due to poor preclinical reproducibility. 
Various preclinical animal models for MI, ranging from mice to non-human 
primates, have been adopted in cardiovascular research to mimic MI in humans. 
Therefore, a comprehensive literature review was essential to elucidate the 
factors affecting the reproducibility and translatability of large animal 
models. In this review article, we have discussed different animal models 
available for studying stem-cell transplantation in cardiovascular applications, 
mainly focusing on the highly translatable porcine MI model.

The control of spoilage microorganisms and foodborne pathogens in meat and meat 
products is a challenge for food producers, which potentially can be overcome 
through the combined use of biopreservatives, in the form of a mix of various 
microbial hurdles. The objective of this work is to systematically review the 
available knowledge to reveal whether various microbial hurdles applied in 
combination can pose an effective decontamination strategy for meat and meat 
products. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were utilized to identify and 
evaluate studies through February 2023. Search results yielded 45 articles that 
met the inclusion criteria. The most common meat biopreservatives were 
combinations of various starter cultures (24 studies), and the use of mixtures 
of non-starter protective cultures (13 studies). In addition, studies evaluating 
antimicrobial combinations of bacteriocins with other bacteriocins, BLIS 
(bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance), non-starter protective cultures, 
reuterin, and S-layer protein were included in the review (7 studies). In one 
study, a biopreservative mixture comprised antifungal protein PgAFP and 
protective cultures. The literature search revealed a positive effect, in most 
of the included studies, of the combination of various bacterial antimicrobials 
in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria in meat products. 
The main advantages of the synergistic effect achieved were: (1) the induction 
of a stronger antimicrobial effect, (2) the extension of the spectrum of 
antibacterial action, and (3) the prevention of the regrowth of undesirable 
microorganisms. Although further research is required in this area, the 
combination of various microbial hurdles can pose a green and valuable 
biopreservation approach for maintaining the safety and quality of meat 
products.

Despite advancements in the current standard of care, cardiovascular diseases 
continue to hold the top spot as the leading cause of mortality worldwide. The 
development of atherosclerosis is the most common culprit behind ailments such 
as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Consequently, 
it imposes a significant burden on life expectancy, quality of life, morbidity, 
and societal costs. Both increased cholesterol levels and the activation of the 
inflammatory cascade are known as cardiovascular risk facts. Their relative 
weight is in the spotlight of curent biomedical research. Newly published data 
shed light on the role of inflammation in determining cardiovascular risk 
irrespective of cholesterol levels and cholesterol-lowering therapies.

The term osteomalacia (OM) refers to a series of processes characterized by 
altered mineralization of the skeleton, which can be caused by various disorders 
of mineral metabolism. OM can be genetically determined or occur due to acquired 
disorders, among which the nutritional origin is particularly relevant, due to 
its wide epidemiological extension and its nature as a preventable disease. 
Among the hereditary diseases associated with OM, the most relevant is X-linked 
hypophosphatemia (XLH), which manifests in childhood, although its consequences 
persist into adulthood where it can acquire specific clinical characteristics, 
and, although rare, there are XLH cases that reach the third or fourth decade of 
life without a diagnosis. Some forms of OM present very subtle initial 
manifestations which cause both considerable diagnosis and treatment delay. On 
occasions, the presence of osteopenia and fragility fractures leads to an 
erroneous diagnosis of osteoporosis, which may imply the prescription of 
antiresorptive drugs (i.e., bisphosphonates or denosumab) with catastrophic 
consequences for OM bone. On the other hand, some radiological features of OM 
can be confused with those of axial spondyloarthritis and lead to erroneous 
diagnoses. The current prevalence of OM is not known and is very likely that its 
incidence is much higher than previously thought. Moreover, OM explains part of 
the therapeutic failures that occur in patients diagnosed with other bone 
diseases. Therefore, it is essential that clinicians who treat adult skeletal 
diseases take into account the considerations provided in this practical review 
when focusing on the diagnosis and treatment of their patients with bone 
diseases.

People who drink naturally hardened water may experience longevity-enhancing 
effects. In this study, we investigated water hardness and longevity from both 
geological and epidemiological perspectives in Japan's Amami islands, where 
drinking water is drawn from coralline or non-coralline bedrock. We investigated 
drinking water hardness, limestone bedrock occupancy, and the centenarian rate 
(number per 10,000 population) by municipality across four adjacent islands 
(Amami-Oshima (non-coralline), Tokunoshima, Okinoerabu, and Yoron (predominantly 
coralline)). Limestone was strongly correlated with water hardness (r = 0.99; p 
< 0.01), occupying more than 80% of the bedrock where the water was the hardest 
(Tokunoshima's Isen municipality: 86.5%; Yoron: 82.9%) and being scarcely 
detectable in Amami-Oshima (0.0 to 0.2%), where the water was the least hard. 
The centenarian rate was also strongly correlated with water hardness (r = 0.84, 
p < 0.01), with the highest figures in Yoron (29.7) and Isen (29.2), and the 
lowest in Amami-Oshima (0.0 to 12.2). Therefore, we hypothesize a potentially 
beneficial effect of hard water on longevity when that water is drawn from 
coralline limestone. Water hardness is determined by the water content of 
calcium and magnesium and may plausibly influence life expectancy through a 
preventative effect against cardiovascular disease. Our findings are of interest 
to current debates about future global access to drinking water and its quality.

Age-related neurobiological changes significantly affect hippocampal structure 
and function, such that the main cognitive impairments associated with aging are 
related to the integrity of this brain structure, including the deterioration in 
spatial object recognition (SOR) memory. Previous studies have shown that 
intrinsic factors such as neuroinflammation, as well as lifestyle factors such 
as diet, can affect aging-associated brain functions and cognitive performance. 
In this regard, caloric restriction (CR) produces beneficial effects on health 
and life expectancy, although its ability to slow down age-dependent effects on 
cognitive decline and hippocampus (HPC) functioning remains unclear. Therefore, 
we set out to evaluate the effects of CR on SOR memory in aged male Wistar rats, 
as well as those on hippocampal neuron loss, neurogenesis and inflammation. The 
data show that CR in aged rats attenuates the decline in SOR memory, 
age-associated hippocampal neuron loss, and age-dependent microglial activation. 
Furthermore, we found a significant reduction in neurogenesis in the dentate 
gyrus of the old animals relative to adult rats. These findings support the 
positive effect of CR on SOR memory, suggesting that it dampens hippocampal 
neuronal loss and reduces proinflammatory activity.

N-of-1 trials provide a higher level of evidence than randomized controlled 
trials for determining which treatment works best for an individual, and the 
design readily accommodates testing of personalized nutrition. The aim of this 
systematic review was to synthesize nutrition-related studies using an N-of-1 
design. The inclusion criterion was adult participants; the 
intervention/exposure was any nutrient, food, beverage, or dietary pattern; the 
comparators were baseline values, a control condition untreated or placebo, or 
an alternate treatment, alongside any outcomes such as changes in diet, body 
weight, biochemical outcomes, symptoms, quality of life, or a disease outcome 
resulting from differences in nutritional conditions. The information sources 
used were Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Central, and PsychInfo. The quality 
of study reporting was assessed using the Consort Extension for N-of-1 trials 
(CENT) statement or the STrengthening Reporting of OBservational Studies in 
Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, as appropriate. From 211 articles screened, a 
total of 7 studies were included and were conducted in 5 countries with a total 
of 83 participants. The conditions studied included prediabetes, diabetes, 
irritable bowel syndrome, weight management, and investigation of the effect of 
diet in healthy people. The quality of reporting was mostly adequate, and 
dietary assessment quality varied from poor to good. The evidence base is small, 
but served to illustrate the main characteristics of N-of-1 study designs and 
considerations for moving research forward in the era of personalized medical 
nutrition therapy.

Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg. (T. hemsleyanum) is an economically and 
medicinally valuable species within the genus Tetrastigma. However, the material 
basis of its pharmacological action and the biomarkers associated with its 
anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects are still unclear. Additionally, the 
T. hemsleyanum industry cannot grow because there is a lack of a scientific, 
universal, and measurable quality control system. This study aimed to explore 
the chemical basis quality markers related to the anti-cancer and 
anti-inflammatory effects of T. hemsleyanum to establish an effective quality 
evaluation method. UPLC-Q-TOF-MSE fingerprint profiles of T. hemsleyanum from 
different origins were established. Pharmacodynamic studies used HepG2 and HuH-7 
cells and LPS-induced RAW264.7 to evaluate the anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory 
effects of the active ingredients. The spectrum-effect relationships between 
UPLC fingerprints and anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities were 
evaluated using PCA and PLSR statistical methods. Moreover, docking analysis was 
performed to identify specific active biomarkers with molecular targets 
associated with cancer and inflammation. Chlorogenic acid, quinic acid, 
catechin, kaempferol 3-rutinoside, apigenin-8-C-glucoside, and linolenic acid 
were associated with anticancer activity, while chlorogenic acid, quercetin, 
quinic acid, kaempferol 3-rutinoside, rutinum, apigenin-8-C-glucoside, and 
linolenic acid were associated with anti-inflammatory activity. The 
spectrum-effect relationship of T. hemsleyanum was successfully established, and 
the biomarkers for anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects were preliminary 
confirmed. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the elucidation of the 
substance basis of T. hemsleyanum and lay the foundation for its rapid 
identification, quality control, industrial research, and utilization.

València, 46022 Valencia, Spain.

In this work, a decentralized but synchronized real-world system for smart 
battery management was designed by using a general controller with cloud 
computing capability, four charge regulators, and a set of sensorized battery 
monitors with networking and Bluetooth capabilities. Currently, for real-world 
applications, battery management systems (BMSs) can be used in the form of 
distributed control systems where general controllers, charge regulators, and 
smart monitors and sensors are integrated, such as those proposed in this work, 
which allow more precise estimations of a large set of important parameters, 
such as the state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH), current, voltage, and 
temperature, seeking the safety and the extension of the useful life of energy 
storage systems based on battery banks. The system used is a paradigmatic 
real-world example of the so-called intelligent battery management systems. One 
of the contributions made in this work is the realization of a distributed 
design of a BMS, which adds the benefit of increased system security compared to
