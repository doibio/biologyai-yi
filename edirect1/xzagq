PURPOSE: The stigma attached to epilepsy often restricts early diagnosis and 
optimal care, particularly among the underprivileged. We aimed to ascertain any 
gender bias in the utilization of services for epilepsy in a tertiary and 
community care facility in Kerala State, India.
METHODS: The R. Madhavan Nayar Center for Comprehensive Epilepsy Care (RMNC) is 
a leading tertiary care facility in South India. The District Mental Health 
Program (DMHP) is a community-based care facility that provides medical 
consultation and anti-epileptic drugs (AED) free of charge. We analyzed the sex 
ratio (SR) - number of women per one thousand men - of all registrations in 
these centers according to year of registration, age, religion, income, distance 
from domicile to the center, and religion.
RESULTS: The SR in the RMNC (1976-2004, n = 12354) was 729. At RMNC, 
age-specific SR increased up to the 3rd decade (864), and progressively declined 
beyond 50 years. The SR was lower for those domiciliated at more than 200 km 
from the center when compared to others. The SR at the DMHP (1999-2004, n = 221) 
was high (1125). The age-specific SR at DMHP showed two peaks at 21-30 years 
(1368) and 51-60 years (2333).
CONCLUSION: Fewer women with epilepsy (particularly in lower socioeconomic 
groups) receive tertiary care in this state, in spite of a higher SR in the 
community (907 for epilepsy and 1058 for all population). The tertiary treatment 
gap is wider for women over 30 years (particularly over 50 years), when their 
longer life expectancy is also taken into consideration.

OBJECTIVE: The presence of depressive symptoms after myocardial infarction (MI) 
is a risk factor for new cardiovascular events. The importance of the course of 
post-MI depressive symptoms for cardiac prognosis is not clear. We therefore set 
out to investigate whether different courses of post-MI depressive symptoms can 
be identified and determine their associations with cardiac events.
METHODS: Data were derived from the Depression after Myocardial Infarction 
(DepreMI) study, a naturalistic follow-up study of patients admitted for an MI 
in four hospitals in The Netherlands (N = 475). Scores on the Beck Depression 
Inventory (BDI) during hospitalization and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-MI were 
analyzed. Using latent class analysis (LCA), we identified classes characterized 
by distinctive courses of depressive symptoms and then examined their link to 
cardiac prognosis.
RESULTS: The prevalence of significant depressive symptoms ranged from 22.7% to 
25.5% throughout the post-MI year. Five distinct courses were found: no 
depressive symptoms (56.4%), mild depressive symptoms (25.7%), moderate and 
increasing depressive symptoms (9.3%), significant but decreasing depressive 
symptoms (4.6%), and significant and increasing depressive symptoms (4.0%). 
Subjects in this last class had, statistically, a significantly higher risk for 
a new cardiovascular event compared with subjects without depressive symptoms 
(hazard ratio (HR) = 2.73; p = .01). Controlling for baseline cardiac status and 
sociodemographic data did not alter the association (HR = 2.46; p = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Post-MI depressed subjects with significant and increasing 
depressive symptoms are at particular risk of new cardiac events. This subgroup 
may be most suited for evaluation of the effects of antidepressant treatment on 
cardiac prognosis.

A cost-utility analysis of chronic spinal pain treatment outcomes: converting 
SF-36 data into quality-adjusted life years.

OBJECTIVES: The present retrospective case review study sought to analyze the 
cost-utility, expressed in cost/quality-adjusted life years (QALY), of current 
chronic spinal pain treatments. In addition, it expands upon previously 
published data evaluating the efficacy of interdisciplinary pain management in 
relation to medication management.
METHODS: A recently developed algorithm was used to calculate QALYs using SF-36, 
v. 1 responses for 121 patients receiving treatment for chronic spinal pain at a 
pain rehabilitation center. Treatment groups evaluated were: (1) 
interdisciplinary program completers who received medication management and 
supplementary anesthetic procedures; (2) interdisciplinary program completers 
receiving medication management but not anesthetic procedures; (3) patients 
receiving medication management alone; and (4) patients receiving medication 
management with supplemental anesthetic procedures. Assessments were conducted 
at pretreatment and 6 months after the initiation of treatment.
RESULTS: One-way analyses of covariance indicated that patients who participated 
in an interdisciplinary pain management program, which included medication 
management, psychotherapy, group education, and physical therapy, reported 
significantly less impairment in daily activities of living, less subjective 
experience of pain, and a higher quality of life and more preferred health state 
at the completion of their treatment phase, relative to patients receiving 
medication with or without anesthetic procedures. In addition, improvements in 
all outcome measures between pretreatment and posttreatment were significantly 
greater for those patients completing the interdisciplinary component of 
treatment. Cost-utility analyses revealed that the interdisciplinary treatment 
alone group was cost-saving, relative to the medication and procedures 
alternative, suggesting the former modality was both less costly and more 
effective than the latter.
DISCUSSION: Average cost-utility ratios for both interdisciplinary treatment 
groups, ranging from 57,627 dollars /QALY to 75,885 dollars /QALY, were within 
established cost-effective parameters (20,000 dollars to 100,000 dollars /QALY, 
generally considered a good value), whereas cost-utility ratios for the standard 
care treatment groups were not interpretable because of a decrease in QALYs from 
pretreatment to posttreatment.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Living donor liver transplantation is becoming increasingly 
important in the Western world, but the economic issues remain controversial. We 
conducted a cost-utility analysis to evaluate whether living donor liver 
transplantation is cost-effective.
METHODOLOGY: Cost and utility analyses were performed in a longitudinal survey 
of a single center in Sapporo, Japan. Medical costs were derived from 11 
patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation. Health utility was 
measured in quality-adjusted life year. Data for health utility scores were 
derived from 19 patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation.
RESULTS: Median medical cost was U.S. dollars 154,626 from the first day of 
preoperative evaluation to 24 months post-transplantation. Cumulative 
quality-adjusted life years were 1.60 at 24 months after transplantation. 
Medical cost per quality-adjusted life year decreased progressively, leading to 
medical cost of U.S. dollars 605,131 per quality-adjusted life year at 3 months 
to U.S. dollars 94,169 at 24 months after transplantation. The results were 
sensitive to medical cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up survey identified progressive increases in the 
cost-effectiveness of living donor liver transplantation for patients with 
end-stage liver disease. Living donor liver transplantation appears to represent 
a cost-effective medical technology.

INTRODUCTION: Goitre presenting with acute, life-threatening airway compromise 
is an uncommon indication for thyroid surgery. The management of this critical 
condition is controversial.
AIMS: To investigate the incidence of life-threatening airway compromise in 
patients with benign goitre, to investigate the predisposing factors, and to 
outline an optimal management policy for such critical cases.
METHODS: Retrospective review of the medical records of patients presenting with 
life-threatening, acute airway compromise secondary to benign thyroid disease, 
treated by the senior author (CT) between July 1994 and July 2005.
RESULTS: Of a total of 505 thyroid surgery procedures over the 11-year period, 
five patients with benign thyroid disease had presented with life-threatening, 
acute airway compromise. Three of the five patients had been thyrotoxic and two 
of these had received an iodine load prior to airway compromise. Immediate 
endotracheal intubation for airway control followed by admission to the 
intensive care unit had been the presentation in two patients. An incidental 
diagnosis of tracheal compression had been made from the computed tomography 
(CT) scan in two patients who had non-resolved obstructive airway disease. 
Emergency thyroidectomy had been performed in all five patients. Significant 
tracheomalacia had been noted in four patients. Following thyroidectomy, two 
patients had required tracheostomy and one had required tracheal stenting.
CONCLUSION: Chronic obstructive airways disease, substernal extension and 
long-standing goitre are considered as risk factors for developing acute, 
life-threatening airway compromise in the presence of benign thyroid disease. A 
recent iodine load may lead to airway compromise in thyrotoxic patients. A CT 
scan is indicated in cases of unresponsive chronic obstructive airways disease 
to rule out substernal extension of non-palpable goitres. Life-threatening 
airway compromise secondary to benign goitres is best treated by endotracheal 
intubation if conservative measures fail, followed by emergency thyroidectomy. 
Following surgery, close observation is mandatory to exclude airway compromise 
due to tracheomalacia and laryngeal oedema.

OBJECTIVE: Aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy or radical oncological 
surgery in young women with cancer has greatly enhanced these patients' life 
expectancy, but these treatments often cause infertility or premature ovarian 
failure due to a massive destruction of the ovarian reserve. The objective of 
this review is to discuss the effect of the various cancer treatments on 
fertility and present the various fertility sparing operations and fertility 
preservation strategies.
METHOD: An extensive survey of the most up-to-date literature was performed.
RESULTS: This review discusses the impact of current cancer treatment on 
fertility potential and the various surgical and assisted-reproduction 
innovations available today for the most common cancers in young women. Although 
the ability to retain reproductive potential is becoming a major quality-of-life 
factor in an increasing number of young female cancer survivors, they are still 
being poorly counseled with regard to the negative impact of the treatment on 
their fertility and on their options for fertility preservation.
CONCLUSION: As the emerging discipline of fertility preservation is steadily 
attracting increasing interest, developments in the near future promise to be 
very exciting. However, in everyday routine work, better interdisciplinary 
cooperation between gynecological and pediatric oncologists, surgeons, 
immunologists, and endocrinologists is necessary so that individualized options 
for fertility preservation can be offered in advance of surgical procedures or 
cancer treatments.

PURPOSE: Cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses are of increasing 
importance to clinicians and health policy experts. This study determines the 
costs in Germany and other countries in relation to gain of utility for patients 
with bilateral poor vision owing to corneal disease undergoing penetrating 
keratoplasty (PK) in 1 eye.
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis was performed using retrospective clinical data 
and high-level evidence-based data.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty patients (mean age, 46.3 years) with bilateral poor vision 
who underwent PK for corneal disease.
METHODS: Visual acuity and utility values were obtained before and 1 year after 
PK and after suture removal. A 10-year graft survival rate of 80% was assumed. 
Expenses included costs for the corneal transplant and surgery, medication, and 
optical rehabilitation. A discount rate of 5% was applied for costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost-utility analysis encompassed a 10-year 
period after surgery.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of QALYs was calculated for the study group 
undergoing PK. This was divided into the cost of the procedure to get the number 
of euros spent per QALY gained.
RESULTS: Median binocular preoperative visual acuity was -log mean angle of 
resolution (-logMAR) 0.91+/-0.53 (Snellen equivalent 20/160) yielding a utility 
value of 0.67. After suture removal and optical rehabilitation, binocular visual 
acuity increased to median -logMAR 0.36+/-0.36 (20/46) with a utility value of 
0.79. Over the 10 years after surgery and considering graft survival and 
discounting, a cost utility of 9551 euros per QALY was gained (equivalent to 
US11,557 dollars). One-way sensitivity analysis yielded a range from 7706 euros 
to 12874 euros per QALY, highlighting the robustness of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Although an expensive procedure, PK is cost effective in patients 
with bilateral poor vision.

Comment in
    Ann Thorac Surg. 2006 Oct;82(4):1391.

BACKGROUND: Because of increasing life expectancy of patients with heart valve 
replacement and a limited durability of heart valve bioprostheses, cardiac 
reoperation becomes necessary in a significant percentage of patients. Reliable 
data on mortality and risk factors in octogenarians after replacement of aortic 
valve prostheses are scanty, however.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 71 patients aged 80 years and older who 
underwent cardiac reoperation of the aortic valve (69 bioprostheses, 2 
mechanical prostheses) between 1991 and 2004 at our heart center. Survival rate 
of the study cohort was compared with a control group of octogenarians matched 
for age, sex, and year of aortic valve replacement. To assess predictors of 
30-day survival and 3-year survival, we performed univariate and multivariate 
analyses.
RESULTS: Survival rates at 30 days, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years were 83.6%, 
76.1%, 70.8%, and 51.3%, respectively. Results did not differ significantly 
between the study cohort and the controls. Patients with reoperation had an 
estimated median survival of 5.6 years. Postoperative complications such as low 
cardiac output syndrome and intestinal failure were the only independent 
predictors of 30-day survival (p = 0.020 and p = 0.015, respectively). Low 
cardiac output, intestinal failure, and diabetes mellitus were independent 
predictors of 3-year survival (p = 0.001 to 0.033).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that it is possible to achieve an acceptable 
outcome in octogenarians who have reoperation of the aortic valve prosthesis. 
Early and mid-term survival is predominantly influenced by unexpected 
postoperative complications and not by preoperative risk factors, with the 
exception of diabetes mellitus.

Impact of model, methodological, and parameter uncertainty in the economic 
analysis of vaccination programs.

Brisson M(1), Edmunds WJ.

Author information:
(1)Modelling and Economics Unit, Health Protection Agency, London, UK.

Guidelines for economic evaluations insist that the sensitivity of model results 
to alternative parameter values should be thoroughly explored. However, 
differences in model construction and analytical choices (such as the choice of 
a cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit framework) also introduce uncertainty in 
results, though these are rarely subjected to a thorough sensitivity analysis. 
In this article, the authors quantify the effect of model, methodological, and 
parameter uncertainty, taking varicella vaccination as an example. They used 3 
different models (a static model, a dynamic model that only looks at the effect 
of vaccination on varicella, and a dynamic model that also assesses the 
implications of vaccination for zoster epidemiology) and 2 forms of analysis 
(cost-benefit and cost-utility). They also varied the discount rate and time 
frame of analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to estimate 
the impact of parameter uncertainty. In their example, model and methodological 
choice had a profound effect on estimated cost-effectiveness, but parameter 
uncertainty played a relatively minor role. Under cost-utility analysis, the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that there was a near certainty 
that vaccination dominates no vaccination, or the other way around, depending on 
model choice and perspective. Under cost-benefit analysis, vaccination always 
appeared to be attractive. Thus, the authors clearly show that model and 
methodological assumptions can have greater impact on results than parameter 
estimates, although sensitivity analyses are rarely performed on these sources 
of uncertainty.

A heart transplant is at present considered the treatment of choice in cases of 
terminal cardiac insufficiency refractory to medical or surgical treatment. Due 
to factors such as the greater life expectancy of the population and the more 
efficient management of acute coronary syndromes, there is an increasing number 
of people who suffer from heart failure. It is estimated that the prevalence of 
the disease in developed countries is around 1%; of this figure, some 10% are in 
an advanced stage and are thus potential receptors of a heart transplant. The 
problem is that it is still not possible to offer this therapeutic form to all 
of the patients that require it. Consequently, it is necessary to optimise the 
results of the heart transplant through the selection of patients, selection and 
management of donors, perioperative management and control of the disease due to 
graft rejection. Since the first transplant carried out in 1967, numerous 
advances and changes have taken place, which has made it possible to increase 
survival and quality of life of those who have received a new heart. In this 
article we review the most relevant aspects of the heart transplant and the 
challenges that are currently faced.

The increasing prevalence of brain tumours and longer duration of survival 
achieved by recent advances in treatment prompt a critical analysis of the 
impact of functional rehabilitation on patients with brain tumours. In this 
review brain tumours and outcome of brain tumour patients are discussed from a 
rehabilitation perspective, taking into account not only life expectancy but 
also the direct and indirect causes of functional impairment. Results of 
functional rehabilitation and factors involved in its effectiveness are 
presented and analysed to serve as a basis to neurologists involved in the 
management of patients with brain tumours.

Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwanoha 6-5-1, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8577, Japan.

To understand patients' preferences regarding the disclosure of bad news is 
important in the clinical oncology setting. The aim of this study was to clarify 
descriptively the preferences of cancer patients. Five hundred and twenty-nine 
Japanese cancer outpatients were surveyed regarding their preferences regarding 
the disclosure of bad news, and several psychosocial and medical demographic 
variables were analyzed. In a descriptive analysis, more than 90% of the 
patients strongly preferred to discuss their current medical condition and 
treatment options with their physician and to have their physicians take the 
feelings of their family into consideration as well. While half of the patients 
preferred to receive information regarding their life expectancy, 30% preferred 
not to receive it. Multiple regression analyses indicated the preferences 
showing interindividual variations were associated with the level of education 
and the mental adjustment to cancer scores. A factor analysis revealed four 
preferences factors: method of disclosure of the bad news, provision of 
emotional support, provision of additional information, and setting. These four 
factors had good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 
0.93-0.77). Providing emotional support, including the desire for the physician 
to show consideration for the patient's family, and understanding an 
individual's communication preferences may be useful for promoting 
patient-physician communication.

PURPOSE: Conduct an integrative literature review to evaluate the safety and 
effectiveness of live-virus vaccines, namely, the measles, mumps, rubella, and 
varicella vaccines, in children who are immune compromised by exogenous 
medication either posttransplant or while undergoing maintenance chemotherapy 
for leukemia.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, MedlinePlus, EBSCO, PubMed, MD Consult, CINAHL, Clinical 
Pharmacology, ERIC, Biomedical Reference Collection-Basic, Health 
Source-Consumer Edition, Health Source-Nursing/Academic Edition, Ovid, 
CANCERLIT, and the Cochrane Library Online.
CONCLUSIONS: Because measles infection has a low incidence rate in the United 
States, it may be advisable not to vaccinate children who are immunocompromised 
and risk side effects of the vaccine. In contrast to measles infection, 
varicella has a higher incidence rate and poses a more imminent threat to those 
who are immunocompromised. Children who are immunosuppressed can receive the 
varicella vaccination; however, they should have regular titers drawn to confirm 
adequate protection against the disease and should receive boosters as deemed 
appropriate.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The number of solid organ transplant recipients is 
steadily increasing with more than 600,000 solid organ transplantations 
worldwide since the first renal transplant in 1954. The steadily increasing 
numbers of pediatric patients surviving transplantation, coupled with increased 
life expectancy, accelerate the need for nurse practitioners to understand the 
management of these delicate patients following release from the transplant 
unit.

Low-income communities will within the next decades undergo rapid changes. The 
burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes, cardio-vascular 
disease and cancer, will comprise an increasing proportion of the total disease 
burden. The results of projections indicate that the already constrained health 
systems will face a double burden of disease, in which HIV/AIDS and other common 
infectious diseases will co-exist with the new NCDs. In order for preventive 
measures directed towards NCD to be cost-effective, these have to be implemented 
within the next 10-20 years.

The E6 oncoproteins of high-risk human papillomaviruses provide important 
functions not only for malignant transformation but also in the productive viral 
life cycle. E6 proteins have been shown to bind to a number of cellular factors, 
but only a limited number of analyses have investigated the effects of these 
interactions on the viral life cycle. In this study, we investigated the 
consequences of HPV 31 E6 binding to E6TP1, a putative Rap1 GAP protein. HPV 16 
E6 has been shown to bind as well as induce the rapid turnover of E6TP1, and 
similar effects were observed with HPV 31 E6. Mutation of amino acid 128 in HPV 
31 E6 was found to abrogate the ability to bind and degrade E6TP1 but did not 
alter binding to another alpha-helical domain protein, E6AP. When HPV 31 genomes 
containing mutations at amino acid 128 were transfected into human 
keratinocytes, the viral DNAs were not stably maintained as episomes indicating 
the importance of this residue for pathogenesis. Many E6 binding partners 
including E6TP1 are cytoplasmic proteins, but E6 has been also reported to be 
localized to the nucleus. We therefore investigated the importance of E6 
localization to the nucleus in the viral life cycle. Using a fusion of E6 to 
Green Fluorescent Protein, we mapped one component of the nuclear localization 
sequences to residues 121 to 124 of HPV 31 E6. Mutation of these residues in the 
context of the HPV 31 genome abrogated the ability for episomes to be stably 
maintained and impaired the ability to extend the life span of cells. These 
studies identify two activities of HPV 31 E6 that are important for its function 
in the viral life cycle and for extension of cell life span.

PURPOSE: To determine the relative rates of common iliac artery (CIA) expansion 
after elective straight aortic tube-graft replacement of infrarenal abdominal 
aortic aneurysms (AAA).
METHODS: Five participating centers in this 2004 study entered patients they had 
managed by an aortoaortic tube graft for elective AAA repair. The procedures 
took place between January 1995 and December 2003. Postoperative computed 
tomography (CT) scans were obtained for all patients in 2004 to assess changes 
in CIA diameter. Measurements on preoperative and postoperative CT scans were 
all made at the same level using the same technique.
RESULTS: Entered in the study were 147 patients (138 men, 9 women) with a mean 
age of 68 years. Mean follow-up from aortic surgery to verification of CIA 
diameter on the postoperative CT scan was 4.8 years. Mean preoperative CIA 
diameter was 13.6 mm vs 15.2 mm postoperatively. No patient developed occlusive 
iliac artery disease during follow-up. Three patients (2%) required repeat 
surgery during follow-up for a CIA aneurysm. The 147 patients were divided into 
three groups based on preoperative CIA diameter shown in CT scan: group A (n = 
59, 40.1%), both CIA were of normal diameter; group B (n = 53, 36.1%), ectasia 
(diameter between 12 and 18 mm) of at least one CIA; group C (n = 35, 23.8%), an 
aneurysm (diameter >18 mm) of at least one CIA. CIA diameter increased by a mean 
of 1 mm (9.4%) over 5.5 years in group A vs 1.7 mm (12.1%) over 4.3 years in 
group B and 2.3 mm (12.7%) over 4.2 years in group C. The three patients who 
required repeat surgery for a CIA aneurysm during follow-up were all in group C. 
Four variables were associated with aneurysmal change in CIA: initial CIA 
diameter, celiac aorta diameter on the preoperative CT scan, a coexisting 
aneurysm site, and the follow-up duration.
CONCLUSIONS: Tube-graft placement during AAA surgery is justified even for 
moderate CIA dilatation (<18 mm). CIA aneurysms with a preoperative diameter > 
or =25 mm enlarge more rapidly and warrant insertion of a bifurcated graft 
during the same surgical session as AAA repair. The evolutive potential of CIA 
between 18 mm and 25 mm in diameter justifies a bifurcated graft when the celiac 
aorta diameter is >25 mm or the patient's life expectancy is > or =8 years.

OBJECTIVE: Aortic complications determine the life expectancy of most patients 
with Marfan syndrome. To find out whether there is heterogenous aortic 
involvement among patients and, if there is, to characterize aortic patterns and 
response to long-term beta-blocker therapy, we investigated aortic elastic 
properties before and during beta-blocker treatment.
METHODS: In 46 patients with Marfan syndrome (age, 17.4 +/- 11.1 years) and 46 
healthy control subjects, ascending and descending aortic elastic parameters 
were determined noninvasively before and after 39 +/- 16 months of beta-blocker 
treatment with atenolol.
RESULTS: Aortic diameters and distensibility distinguished Marfan patients and 
controls with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 87%. Cluster analysis 
revealed 4 patterns of aortic phenotypic expression: (1) reduced ascending 
aortic elasticity (46% of patients), (2) diminished ascending and descending 
aortic elasticity (17%), (3) minimal alterations of ascending and descending 
aortic elasticity (20%), and (4) reduced descending aortic elasticity (17%). 
During follow-up, aortic elastic properties improved in 21 (70%) of 30 patients 
and deteriorated in 9 (30%) irrespective of beta-blocker dosage. Improvement was 
observed in 100% of patients (n = 7; age, 5.3 +/- 4.2 years) with end-diastolic 
aortic root diameters between 20 and 30 mm and in 61% of patients (14/23; age, 
20.5 +/- 10.0 years) with root diameters between 30 and 52 mm.
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic elastic parameters distinguish between patients with Marfan 
syndrome and healthy controls and show the pattern of regional aortic 
involvement. Improvement or deterioration during follow-up can influence 
therapeutic decisions to prevent aortic dissection and rupture. Young age, small 
root diameter, and high distensibility are favorable prognostic factors.

BACKGROUND: Evidence comparing laparoscopic versus open hernia repair has varied 
with time and with changes in techniques used. Cost effectiveness is an 
important consideration when evidence for predominance of one surgical technique 
is lacking. Current cost estimates of hernia repair are not available.
STUDY DESIGN: This study is a cost effectiveness analysis within a randomized 
controlled trial comparing open (OPEN) versus laparoscopic (LAP) hernia repair 
using mesh at 14 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers, with 2-year 
followup for each patient. Between January 1999 and November 2001, 2,164 men 
with inguinal hernia were randomized and 1,983 had an operation; 1,395 patients 
(708 OPEN and 687 LAP) with outpatient hernia operations were included in the 
cost effectiveness analysis. Outcomes included surgical and postoperative costs, 
quality adjusted life years (QALY), and incremental cost per QALY gained or the 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Over 2 years, LAP cost an average of $638 more than OPEN. QALYs at 2 
years were similar, resulting in $45,899 per QALY gained (95% CI: -$669,045, 
$722,457). The probability that LAP is cost effective at the $50,000 per QALY 
level (slightly more costly but more effective), was 51%. For unilateral primary 
and unilateral recurrent hernia repair, the probabilities that LAP is cost 
effective at the $50,000 per QALY level were 64% and 81%, respectively. For 
bilateral hernia repair, OPEN was less costly and more effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, laparoscopic hernia repair is not cost effective compared 
with open repair. For patients with unilateral (primary or recurrent) hernia, 
laparoscopic repair is a cost effective treatment option.

BACKGROUND: Watchful waiting (WW) has been shown to be an acceptable option in 
men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias when clinical 
and patient-reported outcomes are considered. Although WW is likely to be less 
costly initially when compared with tension-free repair (TFR) because of the 
cost of the operation, it is not clear whether WW remains the least costly 
option when longer-term costs are considered.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of a randomized 
controlled trial at six community and academic centers. We examined costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and cost-effectiveness at 2 years of 
followup. Costs were assessed by applying Medicare reimbursement rates to 
patients' health-care use, which was obtained by contacting patients' 
health-care providers. Quality of life was assessed using the Short Form-36 
version 2 health-related quality-of-life survey. Of the 724 men randomized, 641 
were available for the economic analysis: 317 were randomized to TFR and 324 
were randomized to watchful waiting.
RESULTS: At 2 years, TFR patients had $1,831 higher mean costs than WW patients 
(95% CI, $409-$3,044), with 0.031 higher QALY (95% CI, 0.001-0.058). The cost 
per additional QALY for TFR patients was $59,065 (95% CI, $1,358-$322,765). The 
probability that TFR was cost-effective at the $50,000 per QALY level was 40%.
CONCLUSION: At 2 years, WW was a cost-effective treatment option for men with 
minimal or no hernia symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Nonadherence with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is 
common in typical human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient care settings, but 
the consequences have not been well described. This study aimed to quantify the 
clinical and economic effects of nonadherence and estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of improving adherence in treatment-naive HIV patients.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to project quality-adjusted life 
expectancy and direct medical costs for patients on an initial once-daily 
regimen of efavirenz, lamivudine, and stavudine XR. The model compared 2 
adherence scenarios: "ideal" (based on clinical trials) and "typical" (based on 
observational studies in actual practice). Disease progression was a function of 
viral load, CD4 count, and adherence. Data on HIV natural history, treatment 
benefits, costs, and utilities were derived from the literature.
RESULTS: With typical adherence, patients lose 1.2 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) that could be gained with ideal adherence. Improving adherence to ideal 
levels is cost-effective at 29,400 US dollars/QALY gained. As much as 1,600 US 
dollars/y per patient could be spent on an intervention to improve adherence to 
ideal levels, and the incremental cost-effectiveness would remain less than 
50,000 US dollars/QALY gained. A cost-effectiveness ratio of 50,000 US 
dollars/QALY is a commonly accepted minimum standard for cost-effective medical 
interventions in the United States, although many experts believe this standard 
has drifted upwards over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Typical adherence with HAART reduces quality-adjusted life 
expectancy by 12% compared with ideal adherence. Interventions to improve 
adherence appear to be a highly cost-effective use of resources.

Withdrawal of mitogens (growth factors) arrests normal cells in G0 (quiescence). 
All other stresses and factors arrest cell cycle beyond the restriction point in 
G1 and G2 (non-G0 arrest), in the presence of mitogenic stimulation. Strong 
mitogenic stimuli by themselves cause non-G0 arrest. Unlike G0, arrest beyond 
restriction point is characterized by both high levels of cyclins and CDK 
inhibitors, activated mitogenic pathways with a secondary GF resistance, and 
continuous mass growth (cell hypertrophy). Prolonged hypertrophic arrest 
culminates in cell senescence. This review discusses that quiescence and 
senescence are two opposite, mutually exclusive conditions and that cell 
senescence can be reversed and prevented.

[The role of clinical suicidology in the system of measures directed towards 
lowering early mortality and increasing population life span].

[Article in Russian]

Dmitrieva TB, Polozhiĭ BS.

The level of early mortality has increased substantially in Russia within the 
last fifteen years, having exceeded the same parameter in developed countries 
and in the entire post-Soviet area. The second frequent reason for early 
mortality is a group of factors that includes accidents, suicides, murders, and 
other external causes. The proportion of suicides in this group is 45 to 50%. As 
a result, in the recent years the suicide rate in Russia has filled the second 
place in the world. The authors of this article analyze the suicide rate in 
different Russian regions, distinguishing between regions with the highest and 
lowest rate, and characterizing population risk factors of suicidal danger, a 
special place among which is filled by socioeconomic condition of the regions 
and the ethnic composition of their population. Increase of the effectiveness of 
suicide prevention depends on creation of adequate scientific basis, which 
clinical suicidology can become. The authors substantiate the necessity to 
distinguish suicidology as a separate field of clinical medicine, and formulate 
its definition, goals and objectives. Basing on the obtained results, the 
authors come to a conclusion on the medico-social importance of the development 
of clinical suicidology in lowering early mortality and increasing the country's 
population life span.

QALYs: are they helpful to decision makers?

Comment in
    Pharmacoeconomics. 2006;24(10):953-4.

The QALY is the product of life expectancy (estimated in years) and its quality 
over that time (estimated in utilities or QOL units). It theoretically enables 
direct comparison of the costs of obtaining different health outcomes through 
cost utility analysis (CUA). In this review, we argue that, at present, the 
problems related to the use of utilities preclude the use of cost per QALY as a 
major determinant of policy decisions on the acquisition and use of health 
technologies. Those who use CUA can be divided into (i) those who inform the 
process of decision making through CUA and (ii) those who make the decisions. 
The former have no direct budgetary responsibility for the decisions that are 
taken, while the decision makers must pay for those decisions from their 
budgets. Use of CUA rests on the assumption that all QALYs are of equivalent 
value in the eyes of society. However, the value accorded to them varies with 
circumstances. The utilities or QOL indices required to compute QALYs can be 
measured in different ways, which give different answers, and have been shown to 
be unreliable. Thus, the QALY is not sufficiently accurate or reliable to be 
used by decision makers as a basis for comparison of the costs of different 
technologies. Until the theoretical and practical problems of determining health 
preferences are resolved and the methods of their measurement are standardised, 
it is necessary to estimate the cost effectiveness of health interventions by 
relating their cost to their primary health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is widely considered the 
standard of care for stoke prophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation who 
are at high risk of stroke. Community-based studies in the US have reported that 
the effectiveness of anticoagulation varies by management approach and that 
patients receiving warfarin have international normalised ratio (INR) values 
within the target therapeutic range less than half the time.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the lifetime societal costs and health benefits of 
warfarin therapy to prevent strokes, specifically in elderly patients (mean age 
70 years) with atrial fibrillation who are at high risk of stroke, when 
anticoagulation is managed through usual care versus anticoagulation management 
services, where dedicated anticoagulation professionals (e.g. physician or 
pharmacist) monitor and oversee patients.
METHODS: Semi-Markov decision model with a 30-day cycle length and 10-year time 
horizon (to reflect the mean life expectancy of the study population). 
Univariate sensitivity analyses and Bayesian second-order multivariate 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation were performed. 
Outcomes measures were costs and QALYs. Most of the probability and outcome 
estimates included were derived from the recent SPORTIF (Stroke Prevention using 
ORal Thrombin Inhibitor in atrial Fibrillation) V trial. Utility values were 
derived from a large, nationally representative sample of individuals in the 
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and were adjusted for age, sex, race, 
ethnicity, income, education and co-morbidity. Resource utilisation was based on 
experience at the University Medicine Group Practice Anticoagulation Clinic 
(University of Colorado, Denver, CO, USA) and costs ($US; 2004 values) included 
were for warfarin and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) use and those associated 
with major bleeding, treatment of primary events, routine INR and biochemistry 
monitoring, ECGs, and clinic visits. Costs and outcomes were discounted by 3% 
per annum.
RESULTS: The anticoagulation management service improved effectiveness by 0.057 
(95% credible interval 0, 0.36) QALYs and reduced costs by $US2100 (95% credible 
interval -$US19,800, $US300) [2004 values] compared with usual care. Results 
were sensitive to the extent of the increase in risk of primary events (all 
strokes and systemic embolic events attributable to usual care, but were robust 
to variation in other input variables). The anticoagulation management service 
was the dominant strategy in 91% of Monte Carlo simulations.
CONCLUSION: The anticoagulation management service appears to cost less and 
provide greater effectiveness than usual care. To enhance stroke prophylaxis 
among high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation, physicians and Medicare plans 
may wish to consider augmenting 'usual care' by the addition of 
patient-monitoring technology strategies such as formally organised 
anticoagulation monitoring programmes.
