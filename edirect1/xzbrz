tumors primarily causing drug-resistant seizures for two years or more. They 
include low-grade glial and glioneuronal tumors with normal life expectancy. We 
studied a large cohort of patients with LEATs who underwent surgery through our 
epilepsy program.
PATIENTS & METHODS: From 1998-2011, 105 patients with LEATs underwent surgery in 
our center. We utilized their data archived in a prospective registry to 
evaluate their electro-clinical-imaging characteristics affecting the long-term 
seizure outcome.
RESULTS: Of 105 patients (age 3-50 years), mean age at surgery was 20 years and 
mean pre-surgical duration of epilepsy was 10.9 years. 66 (62.8%) had secondary 
generalized seizures. 82 had temporal tumors, 23 had extra temporal (13 frontal, 
3 parietal, 2 occipital and 5 multilobar lesions) and four had associated 
hippocampal sclerosis. The interictal discharges and ictal onset were concordant 
to the lesion in 82 (78%) and 98 (93%) patients respectively. Lesionectomy 
and/or adjoining corticectomy or temporal lobectomy was done. Ganglioglioma was 
the most dominant pathological substrate in 61 (58%). During a mean follow-up of 
7.5 years (range 3-16 years), 78/105 (74.2%) were seizure-free and 45 (57.4%) 
were totally off drugs. Secondary generalized seizures (p-0.02), temporal 
location of tumor (p-0.008) and spikes in third month post-operative EEG 
(p-0.03) caused unfavorable seizure outcome. A pre-surgical duration of epilepsy 
of more than 6.6 years caused less than optimal surgical outcome
CONCLUSIONS: Early surgery should be considered a priority in LEATs. Presence of 
secondary generalized seizures is the single most important predictor of a poor 
seizure outcome.

PURPOSE: The present review article aims to provide an overview of the available 
radionuclides for palliative treatment of bone metastases beyond (89)Sr and 
(153)Sm. In addition, it aims to review and summarize the clinical outcomes 
associated with the palliative treatment of bone metastases using different 
radiopharmaceuticals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Science Direct and 
PubMed databases (1990 - 2015). The following search terms were combined in 
order to obtain relevant results: "bone", "metastases", "palliative", "care", 
"therapy", "treatment", "radiotherapy", "review", "radiopharmaceutical", 
"phosphorus-32", "strontium-89", "yttrium-90", "tin-117m", "samarium-153", 
"holmium-166", "thulium-170", "lutetium-177", "rhenium-186", "rhenium-188" and 
"radium-223". Studies were included if they provided information regarding the 
clinical outcomes.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A comparative analysis of the measured therapeutic 
response of different radiopharmaceuticals, based on previously published data, 
suggests that there is a lack of substantial differences in palliative efficacy 
among radiopharmaceuticals. However, when the comparative analysis adds factors 
such as patient's life expectancy, radionuclides' physical characteristics (e.g. 
tissue penetration range and half-life) and health economics to guide the 
rational selection of a radiopharmaceutical for palliative treatment of bone 
metastases, (177)Lu and (188)Re-labeled radiopharmaceuticals appear to be the 
most suitable radiopharmaceuticals for treatment of small and medium/large size 
bone lesions, respectively.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a common psychiatric disorder, with a lifetime 
prevalence of 10-15% in the Danish population. Although depression is associated 
with excess mortality, it is not yet understood how this affects life 
expectancy. Our aim was to examine mortality rates and life expectancy in 
patients with unipolar depression compared to the general population, and to 
assess the impact of comorbid somatic illness and substance abuse.
METHODS: We followed a Danish population-based cohort from 1995-2013 
(N=5,103,699). The cohort included all residents in Denmark during the study 
period. Mortality rate ratios (MRRs) and life expectancy in persons with 
unipolar depression were calculated using survival analysis techniques.
RESULTS: The overall MRR was 2.07 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.05-2.09) in 
people with a previous unipolar depression diagnosis compared to the general 
Danish population. This excess mortality translated into a reduced life 
expectancy of 14.0 years in men and 10.1 years in women (assuming onset at age 
15). The MRR was highest for death due to suicide and accidents (MRR: 4.66; 95% 
CI: 4.53-4.79), but the absolute number of deaths was highest for natural 
causes.
CONCLUSION: People with unipolar depression have a significant shorter life 
expectancy, especially men.

To investigate the effects of aerobic exercise and starvation on growth 
performance, postprandial metabolic response and their interaction in a 
sedentary fish species, either satiation-fed or starved juvenile southern 
catfish (Silurus meridionalis) were exercised at 25 °C under three water 
velocities, i.e., nearly still water (control), 1 body length (bl) s(-1) and 2 
bl s(-1), for eight weeks. Then, the feed intake (FI), food conversion 
efficiency (FCE), specific growth rate (SGR), morphological parameters, resting 
ṀO2 (ṀO2rest) and postprandial ṀO2 responses of the experimental fish were 
measured. Exercise at a low velocity (1 bl s(-1)) showed no effect on any growth 
performance parameter, whereas exercise at a high velocity (2 bl s(-1)) 
exhibited higher FI but similar SGR due to the extra energy expenditure from 
swimming and consequent decreased FCE. Starvation led to a significant body mass 
loss, whereas the effect intensified in both exercise groups. Exercise resulted 
in improved cardio-respiratory capacity, as indicated by increased gill and 
heart indexes, whereas it exhibited no effect on resting and postprandial 
metabolism in S. meridionalis. The starved fish displayed significantly larger 
heart, gill and digestive tract indexes compared with the feeding fish, 
suggesting selective maintenance of cardio-respiratory and digestive function in 
this fish species during starvation. However, starved fish still exhibited 
impaired digestive performance, as evidenced by the prolonged duration and low 
postprandial metabolic increase, and this effect was further exacerbated in both 
the 1 and 2 bl s(-1) exercise groups. These data suggest the following: (1) 
aerobic exercise produced no improvement in growth performance but may have led 
to the impairment of growth under insufficient food conditions; (2) the mass of 
different organs and tissues responded differently to aerobic exercise and 
starvation due to the different physiological roles they play; and (3) aerobic 
exercise had no effect on the postprandial metabolic response under a "normal 
feeding" situation, whereas it may have resulted in the impairment of the 
digestive capacity when food availability was low due to the competition of 
energy and oxygen under unfavorable conditions in juvenile S. meridionalis.

Phosphate is an essential constituent of critical cellular functions including 
energy metabolism, nucleic acid synthesis and phosphorylation-dependent cell 
signaling. Increased plasma phosphate levels are an independent risk factor for 
lowered life-expectancy as well as for heart and kidney failure. Nevertheless, 
direct cellular effects of elevated phosphate concentrations within the 
microenvironment are poorly understood and have been largely neglected in favor 
of phosphor-regulatory hormones. Because interstitial fibrosis is the common 
determinant of chronic progressive kidney disease, and because fibroblasts are 
major mediators of fibrogenesis, we here explored the effect of high 
extracellular phosphate levels on renal fibroblasts. We demonstrate that high 
inorganic phosphate directly induces fibrotic fibroblast activation associated 
with increased proliferative activity, increased expression of α-smooth muscle 
actin and increased synthesis of type I collagen. We further demonstrate that 
such fibroblast activation is dependent on phosphate influx, aberrant 
phosphorylation of DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 and aberrant CpG island promoter 
methylation. In summary, our studies demonstrate that elevated phosphate 
concentrations induce pro-fibrotic fibroblast activation independent of 
phospho-regulatory hormones.

BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common 
psychiatric disorder in children, with worldwide prevalence of ADHD varying from 
5.9 to 7.1 %, depending on the reporter. In case of inadequate response to 
stimulants, combination therapy of stimulants and an adjunctive medication may 
improve the control of ADHD symptoms, reduce the dose-limiting adverse events, 
and help control comorbidities. To date, the only medication to be used for 
adjunctive therapy to psychostimulants is guanfacine extended release (GXR). The 
aim of this study was to assess the economic impact of GXR as an adjunct therapy 
with long-acting stimulants (GXR + stimulant) compared to long-acting stimulant 
monotherapy (stimulant alone) in the treatment of children and adolescents with 
ADHD in Canada.
METHOD: A Markov model was developed using health states defined based on the 
clinician-reported Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score (normal, 
mild, moderate, severe). Transition probabilities were calculated based on 
patient-level data from a published study. Long-acting stimulants available in 
Canada were considered in the base-case model: amphetamine mixed salts, 
methylphenidate HCl formulations, and lisdexamfetamine dimesylate. Analyses were 
conducted from a Canadian Ministry of Health (MoH; Ontario) and a societal 
perspective over a 1-year time horizon with weekly cycles.
RESULTS: Over a 1-year time horizon, GXR + stimulant was associated with 0.655 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY), compared to 0.627 QALY with stimulant alone, 
for a gain of 0.028 QALY. From a MoH perspective, GXR+ stimulant and stimulant 
alone were associated with total costs of $CA1,617 and $CA949, respectively 
(difference of $CA668), which resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of $CA23,720/QALY. From a societal perspective, GXR + stimulant and 
stimulant alone were associated with total costs of $CA3,915 and $CA3,582, 
respectively (difference of $CA334), which resulted in an ICER of 
$CA11,845/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) of GXR + stimulant 
showed that it remains a cost-effective strategy in 100 % of the simulations 
from both perspectives in numerous PSA and one-way sensitivity analyses, 
relative to a willingness to pay threshold of $50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: This economic evaluation demonstrates that GXR +  stimulant is 
cost-effective compared to stimulant alone in the treatment of children and 
adolescents with ADHD in Canada.

[Rare diseases from a life insurance perspective].

[Article in German]

Senn A, Filzmaier K.

A rare disease is defined as a disease that affects a maximum of 5 in 10,000 
people. As of today there are roughly 7000 different rare diseases known. On 
account of this one can say that "rare diseases are rare, but people affected by 
them are common". For Germany this amounts to: 4 million people that are 
affected by a rare disease. Diagnosis, therapeutic options and prognosis have 
substantially improved for some of the rare diseases. Besides the general 
medical advances--especially in the area of genetics--this is also due to 
networking and sharing information by so-called Centres of Competence on a 
national and international scale. This results in a better medical care for the 
corresponding group of patients. Against this backdrop, the number of people 
applying for life assurance who are suffering from a complex or rare disease has 
risen steadily in the last years. Due to the scarce availability of data 
regarding long-term prognosis of many rare diseases, a biomathematical, medical 
and actuarial expertise on the part of the insurer is necessary in order to 
adequately assess the risk of mortality and morbidity. Furthermore there is 
quite a focus on the issue of rare diseases from not only politics but society 
as well. Therefore evidence based medical assessment by insurers is especially 
important in this group of applicants--thinking of legal compliance and 
reputational risk.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer affects women's health-related quality of life 
negatively, but little is known about how breast cancer affects this in younger 
women aged 18-44 years. This study measures preference-based health state 
utility (HSU) values, a scaled index of health-related quality of life for 
economic evaluation, for younger women with breast cancer and compares these 
values with same-age women with other cancers and older women (aged ≥45 years) 
with breast cancer.
METHODS: Data from the 2009 and 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
were analyzed in 2014. The sample included 218,852 women; 7,433 and 18,577 had 
histories of breast and other cancers. HSU values were estimated using Healthy 
Days survey questions and a published mapping algorithm. Linear regression 
models for HSU were estimated by age group (18-44 and ≥45 years).
RESULTS: The adjusted breast cancer HSU impact was four times larger for younger 
women than for older women (-0.097 vs -0.024, p<0.001). For younger women, the 
effect of breast cancer on HSU was 70% larger than that of other cancers (-0.097 
vs -0.057, p=0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: Younger breast cancer survivors reported lower HSU values than 
older survivors, highlighting the impact of breast cancer on the physical and 
mental health of younger women. The estimates may be used to evaluate 
quality-adjusted life-years or expectancy for prevention or treatment of breast 
cancer. This study also indicates that separate quality of life adjustments for 
women by age group are important for economic analysis of public health breast 
cancer interventions.

OBJECTIVE: Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines recommend 
arteriovenous fistulas as the preferred access for hemodialysis patients. 
However, this may not hold across all populations of patients, especially the 
elderly, given their comorbidities and relatively reduced life expectancy. 
Therefore, we investigated whether fistulas held benefit over arteriovenous 
grafts as hemodialysis access in elderly patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively searched a vascular access database to compare the 
outcomes for 138 fistulas and 44 grafts that were placed in elderly patients 
(≥75 years old) during a 4-year period at a tertiary medical center.
RESULTS: The primary failure rate was higher for the fistulas compared with the 
grafts (odds ratio, 2.89; P = .008), and more fistulas required one or more 
interventions before their successful use compared with grafts (31% vs 10%, 
respectively; P = .03). In addition, the time to catheter-free dialysis was 
longer for fistulas than for grafts (P < .001). However, the primary and 
secondary patency rates were comparable between the fistulas and grafts and 
between the different access locations. The all-cause mortality rates were also 
comparable between the fistula and graft groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the Fistula First Initiative recommendations, grafts need 
not be discounted as a first-line hemodialysis access option in select elderly 
patients.

Regulation of Nlrp3 inflammasome by dietary metabolites.

Camell C, Goldberg E, Dixit VD.

The bidirectional communication between innate immune cells and energy 
metabolism is now widely appreciated to regulate homeostasis as well as chronic 
diseases that emerge from dysregulated inflammation. Macronutrients-derived from 
diet or endogenous pathways that generate and divert metabolites into energetic 
or biosynthetic pathways – regulate the initiation, duration and cessation of 
the inflammatory response. The NLRP3 inflammasome is an important innate sensor 
of structurally diverse metabolic damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) 
that has been implicated in a wide range of inflammatory disorders associated 
with caloric excess, adiposity and aging. Understanding the regulators of 
immune-metabolic interactions and their contribution towards chronic disease 
mechanisms, therefore, has the potential to reduce disease pathology, improve 
quality of life in elderly and promote the extension of healthspan. Just as 
specialized subsets of immune cells dampen inflammation through the production 
of negative regulatory cytokines; specific immunoregulatory metabolites can 
deactivate inflammasome-mediated immune activation. Here, we highlight the role 
of energy substrates, alternative fuels and metabolic DAMPs in the regulation of 
the NLRP3 inflammasome and discuss potential dietary interventions that may 
impact sterile inflammatory disease.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for 
people whose depression has not responded to antidepressants. However, the 
long-term outcome is unknown. In a long-term follow-up of the CoBalT trial, we 
examined the clinical and cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy as 
an adjunct to usual care that included medication over 3-5 years in primary care 
patients with treatment-resistant depression.
METHODS: CoBalT was a randomised controlled trial done across 73 general 
practices in three UK centres. CoBalT recruited patients aged 18-75 years who 
had adhered to antidepressants for at least 6 weeks and had substantial 
depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI-II] score ≥14 and met ICD-10 
depression criteria). Participants were randomly assigned using a computer 
generated code, to receive either usual care or CBT in addition to usual care. 
Patients eligible for the long-term follow-up were those who had not withdrawn 
by the 12 month follow-up and had given their consent to being re-contacted. 
Those willing to participate were asked to return the postal questionnaire to 
the research team. One postal reminder was sent and non-responders were 
contacted by telephone to complete a brief questionnaire. Data were also 
collected from general practitioner notes. Follow-up took place at a variable 
interval after randomisation (3-5 years). The primary outcome was self-report of 
depressive symptoms assessed by BDI-II score (range 0-63), analysed by intention 
to treat. Cost-utility analysis compared health and social care costs with 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). This study is registered with isrctn.com, 
number ISRCTN38231611.
FINDINGS: Between Nov 4, 2008, and Sept 30, 2010, 469 eligible participants were 
randomised into the CoBalT study. Of these, 248 individuals completed a 
long-term follow-up questionnaire and provided data for the primary outcome (136 
in the intervention group vs 112 in the usual care group). At follow-up (median 
45·5 months [IQR 42·5-51·1]), the intervention group had a mean BDI-II score of 
19·2 (SD 13·8) compared with a mean BDI-II score of 23·4 (SD 13·2) for the usual 
care group (repeated measures analysis over the 46 months: difference in means 
-4·7 [95% CI -6·4 to -3·0, p<0·001]). Follow-up was, on average, 40 months after 
therapy ended. The average annual cost of trial CBT per participant was £343 (SD 
129). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £5374 per QALY gain. This 
represented a 92% probability of being cost effective at the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence QALY threshold of £20 000.
INTERPRETATION: CBT as an adjunct to usual care that includes antidepressants is 
clinically effective and cost effective over the long-term for individuals whose 
depression has not responded to pharmacotherapy. In view of this robust evidence 
of long-term effectiveness and the fact that the intervention represented good 
value-for-money, clinicians should discuss referral for CBT with all those for 
whom antidepressants are not effective.

INTRODUCTION: Many of the patients admitted to a general medical ward have a 
compromised quality of life, or short life expectancy, so they are potential 
candidates for withhold/withdraw (WH/WD) treatment. The first objectif was to 
describe which measures were WH/WD among patients who died during their 
admission in a general medical ward from a tertiary hospital in Madrid. 
Secondly, to define the clinical characteristics of this population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study during 6 months from 
2011 and 2012 of all the patients dead while their admission in the Internal 
Medicine Department.
RESULTS: 2007 patients were admitted, 211 died (10.5%). 121 (57%) were female, 
with 85±9 years of mean age. 103 (48.8%) came from a residential facility and 
105 fulfilled terminality criteria (49.8%). One decision to WH/WD treatment was 
made in 182 patients (86.3%, CI 95%: 81.4-91.1), two in 99 cases (46.9%, CI 95%: 
39.9-53.9) and 3 or more in 31 subjects (14.7%, CI 95%: 9.6-19.7). The most 
frequent decisions involved do-not-resuscitate orders (154, 73.0%), rejection of 
«aggressive treatment measures» (80, 38.0%), use of antibiotics (19, 9.0%), 
admission in ICU (18, 8.5%), and/or surgical treatment (11, 5.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: WH/WD treatment is very frequent among patients who died in a 
general medical ward. The most frequent involved do-not-resuscitate orders and 
rejection of «aggressive treatment measures». WH/WD decisions are adopted in an 
elderly population, with extensive comorbidity and an elevated prevalence of 
advanced dementia and/or terminal disease.

The world is experiencing aging of its population. Age-specific incidence rates 
of cancer are higher and cancer is now recognized as a part of aging. Treating 
older patients can be challenging. The clinical behavior of some tumors changes 
with age and the aging process itself brings physiological changes leading to 
decline in the function of organs. It is essential to identify those patients 
with longer life expectancy, potentially more likely to benefit from aggressive 
treatment vs. those that are more vulnerable to adverse outcomes. A primary 
determination when considering therapy for an older cancer patient is a 
patient's physiologic, rather than chronologic age. In order to differentiate 
amongst patients of the same age, it is useful to determine if a patient is fit 
or frail. Frail older adults have multiple chronic conditions and difficulties 
maintaining independence. They may be more vulnerable to therapy toxicities, and 
may not have substantial lasting benefits from therapy. Geriatric assessment 
(GA) may be used as a tool to determine reversible deficits and devise treatment 
strategies to mitigate such deficits. GA is also used in treatment decision 
making by clinicians, helping to risk stratify patients prior to potentially 
high-risk therapy. An important practical aspect of GA is the feasibility of 
incorporating it into a busy oncology practice. Key considerations in performing 
the GA include: available resources, patient population, GA tools to use, and 
who will be responsible for using the GA results and develop care plans. 
Challenges in implementing GA in clinical practice will be discussed.

Systemic therapy of non-colorectal gastrointestinal malignancies in the elderly.

Desai AM(1), Lichtman SM(1).

11725, USA.

In the coming years life expectancy is expected to increase and with this the 
percentage of the population above age 65 will grow. Patients above 65 make up 
more than two thirds of those currently diagnosed with gastrointestinal 
malignancies. Available evidence based medicine does not focus on the average 
patient, above the age 70, encountered in every day practice. Most guidelines 
and clinical trials are not designed to take into account the special 
considerations needed when treating the elderly such as functional status, 
comorbidities, polypharmacy, life expectancy, and social support. The majority 
of available data is based on retrospective reviews or subset analyses of larger 
studies where the elderly represent a fraction of the studied population. This 
review focuses on the toxicities and tolerability of current standard therapies 
for non-colorectal gastrointestinal malignancies, including gastroesophageal, 
pancreatic, bile duct and hepatocellular cancers in the elderly. With careful 
patient selection and geriatric assessment the elderly can safely benefit from 
standard therapies offered to younger patients.

PURPOSE: Prostate cancer is a common cancer in men in the world. It is rapidly 
increasing. This study investigated the incidence and mortality of prostate 
cancer and the relationship with the Human Development Index (HDI) and its 
dimensions in Asia in 2012.
METHODS: The study was conducted based on data from the world data of cancer and 
the World Bank (including the HDI and its components). The standardized 
incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer were calculated for Asian 
countries. The correlation between incidence, mortality rates, and the HDI and 
its components were assessed with the use of the correlation test, using SPSS 
software.
RESULTS: There was a total of 191,054 incidences and 81,229 death were recorded 
in Asian countries in 2012. Among the Asian countries, the five countries with 
the highest standardized incidence rates of prostate cancer were Israel, Turkey, 
Lebanon, Singapore, and Japan, and the five countries with the highest 
standardized mortality rates were Turkey, Lebanon, Timor-Leste, Armenia, and the 
Philippines. The correlation between standardized incidence rate of prostate 
cancer and the HDI was 0.604 (P ≤ 0.001), with life expectancy at birth 0.529 
(P = 0.002), with mean years of schooling 0.427 (P = 0.001), and with level of 
income per each person of the population 0.349 (P = 0.013). Also, between the 
standardized mortality rate and the HDI, it was 0.228 (P = 0.127).
CONCLUSIONS: A significant and positive correlation was observed between the 
standardized incidence rate of prostate cancer, and the HDI and its dimensions, 
such as life expectancy at birth, mean years of schooling, and income level of 
the population per each person of population. However, there was no significant 
correlation between the standardized mortality rate, and the HDI and its 
dimensions.

BACKGROUND: The nature versus nurture debate is one of the oldest issues in the 
study of longevity, health and successful aging.
OBJECTIVE: We present a 97-year-old man (I.K.) as an example of the effects of 
habitual exercise on the aging process.
METHODS: Extensive assessments included medical examinations, interviews, 
musculoskeletal structure, performance characteristics, cognitive function and 
gut microbiota composition.
RESULTS: I.K. suffers from iatrogenic hypogonadism, prostate cancer, 
hypothyroidism and a history of deep popliteal thrombosis. Notwithstanding, he 
cycles up to 5,000 km a year and participates in competitive sports. His 
musculoskeletal properties, athletic performance, cognitive function and gut 
microbiota are outstanding. Some traits even exceed those seen in middle-aged 
men.
CONCLUSIONS: His long-term physically and intellectually active lifestyles 
combined with extensive social interactions have most likely contributed to his 
exercise capacity, despite his medical history.

Old age is associated with a progressive decline of mitochondrial function and 
changes in nuclear chromatin. However, little is known about how metabolic 
activity and epigenetic modifications change as organisms reach their midlife. 
Here, we assessed how cellular metabolism and protein acetylation change during 
early aging in Drosophila melanogaster. Contrary to common assumptions, we find 
that flies increase oxygen consumption and become less sensitive to histone 
deacetylase inhibitors as they reach midlife. Further, midlife flies show 
changes in the metabolome, elevated acetyl-CoA levels, alterations in 
protein-notably histone-acetylation, as well as associated transcriptome 
changes. Based on these observations, we decreased the activity of the 
acetyl-CoA-synthesizing enzyme ATP citrate lyase (ATPCL) or the levels of the 
histone H4 K12-specific acetyltransferase Chameau. We find that these targeted 
interventions both alleviate the observed aging-associated changes and promote 
longevity. Our findings reveal a pathway that couples changes of intermediate 
metabolism during aging with the chromatin-mediated regulation of transcription 
and changes in the activity of associated enzymes that modulate organismal life 
span.

Because of improvements in the treatment of patients with metastatic breast 
cancer, the development of brain metastases (BM) has become a major limitation 
of life expectancy and quality of life for many breast cancer patients. The 
improvement of management strategies for BM is thus an important clinical 
challenge, especially among high-risk patients such as human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2-positive and triple-negative patients. However, the formation 
of BM as a multistep process is thus far poorly understood. To grow in the 
brain, single tumor cells must pass through the tight blood-brain barrier (BBB). 
The BBB represents an obstacle for circulating tumor cells entering the brain, 
but it also plays a protective role against immune cell and toxic agents once 
metastatic cells have colonized the cerebral compartment. Furthermore, animal 
studies have shown that, after passing the BBB, the tumor cells not only require 
close contact with endothelial cells but also interact closely with many 
different brain residential cells. Thus, in addition to a genetic predisposition 
of the tumor cells, cellular adaptation processes within the new 
microenvironment may also determine the ability of a tumor cell to metastasize. 
In this review, we summarize the biology of breast cancer that has spread into 
the brain and discuss the implications for current and potential future 
treatment strategies.

PURPOSE: To estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALY) loss due to each of the 
following nine chronic conditions-depression, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
heart disease, stroke, emphysema, asthma, arthritis, and cancer.
METHODS: We ascertained respondents' health-related quality of life scores and 
mortality status from the 2005 to 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES) with mortality follow-up data through December 31, 2011. We 
included respondents aged 65 years and older (n = 2380). A hybrid estimator was 
used to calculate QALY from two parts: QALY during the follow-up period and QALY 
beyond the follow-up period. We calculated QALY by each of the nine chronic 
conditions.
RESULTS: For persons aged 65 and older, QALY throughout the reminder of lifetime 
was 12.3 years. After adjusting for age- and sex-related differences, depression 
had an associated 8.2 years of QALY loss; diabetes, 5.6 years; hypertension, 
2.5 years; heart disease, 5.4 years; stroke, 6.4 years; emphysema, 8.0 years; 
asthma, 4.8 years; arthritis, 0.3 years; and cancer, 2.5 years. Compared to 
persons without any chronic conditions, persons with one condition had an 
associated 4.7 years of QALY loss; persons with two conditions, 7.9 years; and 
persons with three or more conditions, 10.8 years.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a QALY estimator for respondents in the 
NHANES-Linked Mortality File and demonstrates the utility of this method to 
other follow-up data. Continued application of our method would enable the 
burden of disease to be compared for a range of health conditions and risk 
factors in the ongoing effort to improve population health.

Seldom have studies taken account of changes in lifestyle habits in the elderly, 
or investigated their impact on disease-free life expectancy (LE) and LE with 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Using data on subjects aged 50+ years from three 
European cohorts (RCPH, ESTHER and Tromsø), we used multi-state Markov models to 
calculate the independent and joint effects of smoking, physical activity, 
obesity and alcohol consumption on LE with and without CVD. Men and women aged 
50 years who have a favourable lifestyle (overweight but not obese, 
light/moderate drinker, non-smoker and participates in vigorous physical 
activity) lived between 7.4 (in Tromsø men) and 15.7 (in ESTHER women) years 
longer than those with an unfavourable lifestyle (overweight but not obese, 
light/moderate drinker, smoker and does not participate in physical activity). 
The greater part of the extra life years was in terms of "disease-free" years, 
though a healthy lifestyle was also associated with extra years lived after a 
CVD event. There are sizeable benefits to LE without CVD and also for survival 
after CVD onset when people favour a lifestyle characterized by salutary 
behaviours. Remaining a non-smoker yielded the greatest extra years in overall 
LE, when compared to the effects of routinely taking physical activity, being 
overweight but not obese, and drinking in moderation. The majority of the 
overall LE benefit is in disease free years. Therefore, it is important for 
policy makers and the public to know that prevention through maintaining a 
favourable lifestyle is "never too late".
