rivaroxaban was inferior to enoxaparin among post-THR patients. The sensitivity 
analyses confirmed these results.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis found that apixaban was not cost-effective and that 
rivaroxaban was inferior to enoxaparin. This finding indicates that compared 
with enoxaparin, the use of apixaban for VTE prophylaxis after THR does not 
represent a good value for the cost at the acceptable threshold in China; in 
addition, the cost of rivaroxaban was higher with lower QALYs.

Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer 
death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due 
to the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic 
inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, 
and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that 
diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed 
countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can 
reach 30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of 
many bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, 
irritable bowel syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter 
pyloriinfection, and colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from 
the Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with 
a potential use in the prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of 
gastrointestinal tract disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely 
important studies regarding the possibility of using probiotics to promote a 
balanced microbiota composition, and a sufficient immunological surveillance 
system as a way to prevent cancer. Considering the fact that the human 
intestines host 100 trillion bacteria, including more than 1,000 species, there 
is still need to perform more in depth investigations in order to find 
probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat cancerous diseases, adding a 
very promising effect to this already successful panorama. This revision aims to 
conduct a review of the most recent studies correlating probiotics and its 
cancer preventing and treatment potential.

Whey-based diets have been linked with prolonged life expectancy and improved 
physical performance. These observations based on numerous clinical and 
simulated studies are attributed to diverse biological activities of whey 
peptides. Recently, bioactive whey peptides were exploited for enveloping 
nutraceuticals and drugs in view of fabricating capsules that the carrier matrix 
is also bioactive. Some of the most considered bioactivities of whey peptides 
including antihypertension, antioxidant, anti-obesity, anti-diabetes, and 
hypocholesterolemic properties with corresponding underlying mechanisms are 
briefly discussed. Then, we overview the supramolecular and gelation-prompted 
encapsulation of nutraceuticals with whey proteins, followed by summarizing 
recent developments in utilization of synthetic peptides for gene and drug 
delivery. Finally, particulation of bioactive whey peptides are communicated. 
Whey peptides may exert both biologically beneficial and technologically 
appreciated activities. Two procedures including desolvation and internal 
gelation have been so far employed for bioactive peptides particulation. 
Crosslinking is a prerequisite to confer acid-induced cold-set gelation to 
bioactive peptides. It also increases peptides Fe3+-reducing power. Surface 
activity of a population of peptides in whey protein hydrolysate may result in 
co-adsorption of the peptides together with small molecule surfactants onto 
oil-water interface, leading to modulated interfacial architecture and particle 
morphology.

BACKGROUND: Indigenous Australians and New Zealanders have a significantly 
shorter life expectancy than non-Indigenous people, mainly due to differences in 
prevalence of chronic diseases. Physical activity helps in the prevention and 
management of chronic diseases, however, activity levels are lower in Indigenous 
than in non-Indigenous people.
OBJECTIVE: To synthesise the literature on the effects of physical activity 
interventions for Indigenous people in Australia and New Zealand on activity 
levels and health outcomes.
METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, SPORTSDiscus and PsycINFO were searched 
for peer-reviewed articles and grey literature was searched. Interventions 
targeted Indigenous people in Australia or New Zealand aged 18+ years and their 
primary or secondary aim was to increase activity levels. Data were extracted by 
one author and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed independently by 
two authors. Data were synthesised narratively.
RESULTS: 407 records were screened and 13 studies included. Interventions 
included individual and group based exercise programs and community lifestyle 
interventions of four weeks to two years. Six studies assessed physical activity 
via subjective (n = 4) or objective (n = 2) measures, with significant 
improvements in one study. Weight and BMI were assessed in all but one study, 
with significant reductions reported in seven of 12 studies. All five studies 
that used fitness tests reported improvements, as did four out of eight 
measuring blood pressure and seven out of nine in clinical markers.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no clear evidence for an effect of physical activity 
interventions on activity levels, however, there were positive effects on 
activity related fitness and health outcomes.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO 
(registration number: CRD42015016915 ).

Consultancy (CRENC), Douala, Cameroon.

INTRODUCTION: Low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) are experiencing a 
growing disease burden due to cardiovascular and other chronic non-communicable 
diseases. Interventions for the control of these diseases are paramount; 
however, these countries are faced with competing health and financial needs. 
There is an urgent need for quality evidence on cost-effective strategies to 
address these chronic diseases. We aim to synthesise the current literature on 
economic evaluations of interventions for primary and secondary cardiovascular 
disease prevention in LMICs.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review of studies (published and unpublished) 
in LMICs up to 30 October 2016 will be conducted. The following databases will 
be searched: PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL, Web of Science, EconLit, 
NHS Economic Evaluations Database (NHS EED). Data sources specific to African 
literature, such as the WHO AFROLIB, Africa Index Medicus and African Journals 
online (AJOL) as well as grey literature, will also be searched. 2 reviewers 
shall independently screen potential articles for inclusion and disagreements 
shall be resolved by consensus. Quality appraisal of studies shall be done using 
Drummond's checklist for economic evaluation of studies. A descriptive synthesis 
of the evidence obtained is planned. The primary outcomes will be costs per life 
years gained or unit of clinical outcome, cost per quality-adjusted life years 
or disability-adjusted life years. This systematic review protocol has been 
prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and 
Meta-analyses for Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 statement.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required considering that this 
is a protocol for a systematic review of published studies. Results from this 
review will be disseminated via conference presentations and peer-reviewed 
journal publications.

PURPOSE: To establish from the literature, cost of preventable adverse events 
(PAEs) to member states of the Joint Action European Union Network for Patient 
Safety and Quality of Care.
DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL for studies in Europe 
estimating cost of adverse events (AEs) and PAEs (2000-March 2016). Using data 
from the literature, we estimated PAE costs based on national 2013 total health 
expenditure (THE) data reported by World Health Organization and converted to 
2015 Euros.
STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: Information on type, frequency and incremental 
cost per episode or estimated cost of AEs was extracted. Total annual 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) resulting from PAEs in 30 EU nations were 
calculated using an estimate from a published study and adjusted for the 
percentage of AEs considered preventable.
RESULT OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Published estimates of costs of AEs and PAEs vary 
based on the care setting, methodology, population and year conducted. Only one 
study was from primary care, the majority were conducted in acute care. Nine 
studies estimated percentage of THE caused by AEs, 13 studies calculated 
attributable length of stay. We estimated the annual cost of PAEs to the 30 
nations in 2015 to be in the range of 17-38 billion Euros, total DALYs lost from 
AEs as 3.5 million, of which 1.5 million DALYs were likely due to PAEs.
CONCLUSION: The economic burden of AEs and PAEs is substantial. However, whether 
patient safety interventions will be 'cost saving' depends on the effectiveness 
and costs of the interventions.

Neuronal cell identity is established during development and must be maintained 
throughout an animal's life (Fishell G, Heintz N. Neuron 80: 602-612, 2013). 
Transcription factors critical for establishing neuronal identity can be 
required for maintaining it (Deneris ES, Hobert O. Nat Neurosci 17: 899-907, 
2014). Posttranscriptional regulation also plays an important role in neuronal 
differentiation (Bian S, Sun T. Mol Neurobiol 44: 359-373, 2011), but its role 
in maintaining cell identity is less established. To better understand how 
posttranscriptional regulation might contribute to cell identity, we examined 
the proprioceptive neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), a highly 
specialized sensory neuron class, with well-established properties that 
distinguish them from other neurons in the ganglion. By conditionally ablating 
Dicer in mice, using parvalbumin (Pvalb)-driven Cre recombinase, we impaired 
posttranscriptional regulation in the proprioceptive sensory neuron population. 
Knockout (KO) animals display a progressive form of ataxia at the beginning of 
the fourth postnatal week that is accompanied by a cell death within the DRG. 
Before cell loss, expression profiling shows a reduction of proprioceptor 
specific genes and an increased expression of nonproprioceptive genes normally 
enriched in other ganglion neurons. Furthermore, although central connections of 
these neurons are intact, the peripheral connections to the muscle are 
functionally impaired. Posttranscriptional regulation is therefore necessary to 
retain the transcriptional identity and support functional specialization of the 
proprioceptive sensory neurons.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We have demonstrated that 
selectively impairing Dicer in parvalbumin-positive neurons, which include the 
proprioceptors, triggers behavioral changes, a lack of muscle connectivity, and 
a loss of transcriptional identity as observed through RNA sequencing. These 
results suggest that Dicer and, most likely by extension, microRNAs are 
crucially important for maintaining proprioception. Additionally, this study 
hints at the larger question of how neurons maintain their functional and 
molecular specificity.

The safety, efficacy, and prolonged half-life of recombinant factor IX Fc fusion 
protein (rFIXFc) were demonstrated in the Phase 3 B-LONG (adults/adolescents ≥12 
years) and Kids B-LONG (children <12 years) studies of subjects with haemophilia 
B (≤2 IU/dl). Here, we report interim, long-term safety and efficacy data from 
B-YOND, the rFIXFc extension study. Eligible subjects who completed B-LONG or 
Kids B-LONG could enrol in B-YOND. There were four treatment groups: weekly 
prophylaxis (20-100 IU/kg every 7 days), individualised prophylaxis (100 IU/kg 
every 8-16 days), modified prophylaxis (further dosing personalisation to 
optimise prophylaxis), and episodic (on-demand) treatment. Subjects could change 
treatment groups at any point. Primary endpoint was inhibitor development. One 
hundred sixteen subjects enrolled in B-YOND. From the start of the parent 
studies to the B-YOND interim data cut, median duration of rFIXFc treatment was 
39.5 months and 21.9 months among adults/adolescents and children, respectively; 
68/93 (73.1 %) adults/adolescents and 9/23 (39.1 %) children had ≥100 cumulative 
rFIXFc exposure days. No inhibitors were observed. Median annualised bleeding 
rates (ABRs) were low in all prophylaxis regimens: weekly (≥12 years: 2.3; <6 
years: 0.0; 6 to <12 years: 2.7), individualised (≥12 years: 2.3; 6 to <12 
years: 2.4), and modified (≥12 years: 2.4). One or two infusions were sufficient 
to control 97 % (adults/adolescents) and 95 % (children) of bleeding episodes. 
Interim data from B-YOND are consistent with data from B-LONG and Kids B-LONG, 
and confirm the long-term safety of rFIXFc, absence of inhibitors, and 
maintenance of low ABRs with prophylactic dosing every 1 to 2 weeks.

BACKGROUND: Asthma episodes and deaths are known to be seasonal. A number of 
reports have shown peaks in asthma episodes in school-aged children associated 
with the return to school following the summer vacation. A fall in prescription 
collection in the month of August has been observed, and was associated with an 
increase in the number of unscheduled contacts after the return to school in 
September.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the study was to assess whether or not a 
NHS-delivered public health intervention reduces the September peak in 
unscheduled medical contacts.
DESIGN: Cluster randomised trial, with the unit of randomisation being 142 NHS 
general practices, and trial-based economic evaluation.
SETTING: Primary care.
INTERVENTION: A letter sent (n = 70 practices) in July from their general 
practitioner (GP) to parents/carers of school-aged children with asthma to 
remind them of the importance of taking their medication, and to ensure that 
they have sufficient medication prior to the start of the new school year in 
September. The control group received usual care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of 
children aged 5-16 years who had an unscheduled medical contact in September 
2013. Supporting end points included the proportion of children who collected 
prescriptions in August 2013 and unscheduled contacts through the following 12 
months. Economic end points were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and 
costs from an NHS and Personal Social Services perspective.
RESULTS: There is no evidence of effect in terms of unscheduled contacts in 
September. Among children aged 5-16 years, the odds ratio (OR) was 1.09 [95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.25] against the intervention. The 
intervention did increase the proportion of children collecting a prescription 
in August (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.64) as well as scheduled contacts in the 
same month (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.52). For the wider time intervals 
(September-December 2013 and September-August 2014), there is weak evidence of 
the intervention reducing unscheduled contacts. The intervention did not reduce 
unscheduled care in September, although it succeeded in increasing the 
proportion of children collecting prescriptions in August as well as having 
scheduled contacts in the same month. These unscheduled contacts in September 
could be a result of the intervention, as GPs may have wanted to see patients 
before issuing a prescription. The economic analysis estimated a high 
probability that the intervention was cost-saving, for baseline-adjusted costs, 
across both base-case and sensitivity analyses. There was no increase in QALYs.
LIMITATION: The use of routine data led to uncertainty in the coding of medical 
contacts. The uncertainty was mitigated by advice from a GP adjudication panel.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention did not reduce unscheduled care in September, 
although it succeeded in increasing the proportion of children both collecting 
prescriptions and having scheduled contacts in August. After September there is 
weak evidence in favour of the intervention. The intervention had a favourable 
impact on costs but did not demonstrate any impact on QALYs. The results of the 
trial indicate that further work is required on assessing and understanding 
adherence, both in terms of using routine data to make quantitative assessments, 
and through additional qualitative interviews with key stakeholders such as 
practice nurses, GPs and a wider group of children with asthma.

Novel principles for optimizing the properties of peptide-based drugs are needed 
in order to leverage their full pharmacological potential. We present the 
design, synthesis, and evaluation of a library of neoglycolipidated 
glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues, which are valuable drug candidates 
for treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Neoglycolipidation of GLP-1 
balanced the lipophilicity, directed formation of soluble oligomers, and 
mediated albumin binding. Moreover, neoglycolipidation did not compromise 
bioactivity, as in vitro potency of neoglycolipidated GLP-1 analogues was 
maintained or even improved compared to native GLP-1. This translated into 
pronounced in vivo efficacy in terms of both decreased acute food intake and 
improved glucose homeostasis in mice. Thus, we propose neoglycolipidation as a 
novel, general method for modulating the properties of therapeutic peptides.

Is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease an Accelerated Aging Disease?

MacNee W(1).

United Kingdom.

Aging is one of the most important risk factors for most chronic diseases. The 
worldwide increase in life expectancy has been accompanied by an increase in the 
prevalence of age-related diseases that result in significant morbidity and 
mortality and place an enormous burden on healthcare and resources. Aging is a 
progressive degeneration of the tissues that has a negative impact on the 
structure and function of vital organs. The lung ages, resulting in decreased 
function and reduced capacity to respond to environmental stresses and injury. 
Many of the changes that occur in the lungs with normal aging, such as decline 
in lung function, increased gas trapping, loss of lung elastic recoil, and 
enlargement of the distal air spaces, also are present in chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). The prevalence of COPD is two to three times higher in 
people over the age of 60 years than in younger age groups. Indeed, COPD has 
been considered a condition of accelerated lung aging. Several mechanisms 
associated with aging are present in the lungs of patients with COPD. Cell 
senescence is present in emphysematous lungs and is associated with shortened 
telomeres and decreased antiaging molecules, suggesting accelerated aging in the 
lungs of patients with COPD. Increasing age leads to elevated basal levels of 
inflammation and oxidative stress (inflammaging) and to increased 
immunosenescence associated with changes in both the innate and adaptive immune 
responses. These changes are similar to those that occur in COPD and may enhance 
the activity of the disease as well as increase susceptibility to exacerbations 
in patients with COPD. Understanding the mechanism of age-related changes in 
COPD may identify novel therapies for this condition.

As life expectancy increases, a larger number of elderly people require dental 
health care attention for implant-supported rehabilitation, with the aim of 
restoring the function and aesthetics of the oral cavity. Most of these patients 
have lost their teeth long time ago, causing a severe bone resorption and 
maxillary sinus pneumatization. Therefore, the current study aims to 
demonstrate, through the description of the clinical case, the treatment with 
zygomatic implants as an option for treating severely atrophic maxillas. In this 
clinical study, the patient presented, in the clinical and image evaluation, 
severe alveolar bone atrophy, with height and thickness loss, in addition to a 
high-level pneumatization of the maxillary sinus, bilaterally. The classical 
zygomatic fixation technique was suggested, with 2 anterior conventional 
implants and 2 zygomatic implants in the posterior region with the placement of 
implant-supported prosthesis with immediate loading. The patient was monitored 
for 7 years and did not present pain complaints, absence of infection, or 
implant loss. Based on this clinical case study, it was concluded that the 
zygomatic implants are satisfactory options to aid the implant-supported 
rehabilitation of atrophic maxillas.

INTRODUCTION: Calculating the cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
averted associated with interventions is an increasing popular means of 
assessing the cost-effectiveness of strategies to improve population health. 
However, there has been no systematic attempt to characterize the literature and 
its evolution.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies 
reporting cost-per-DALY averted from 2000 through 2015. We developed the Global 
Health Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (GHCEA) Registry, a repository of 
English-language cost-per-DALY averted studies indexed in PubMed. To identify 
candidate studies, we searched PubMed for articles with titles or abstracts 
containing the phrases "disability-adjusted" or "DALY". Two reviewers with 
training in health economics independently reviewed each article selected in our 
abstract review, gathering information using a standardized data collection 
form. We summarized descriptive characteristics on study methodology: e.g., 
intervention type, country of study, study funder, study perspective, along with 
methodological and reporting practices over two time periods: 2000-2009 and 
2010-2015. We analyzed the types of costs included in analyses, the study 
quality on a scale from 1 (low) to 7 (high), and examined the correlation 
between diseases researched and the burden of disease in different world 
regions.
RESULTS: We identified 479 cost-per-DALY averted studies published from 2000 
through 2015. Studies from Sub-Saharan Africa comprised the largest portion of 
published studies. The disease areas most commonly studied were communicable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders (67%), followed by 
non-communicable diseases (28%). A high proportion of studies evaluated primary 
prevention strategies (59%). Pharmaceutical interventions were commonly assessed 
(32%) followed by immunizations (28%). Adherence to good practices for 
conducting and reporting cost-effectiveness analysis varied considerably. 
Studies mainly included formal healthcare sector costs. A large number of the 
studies in Sub-Saharan Africa addressed high-burden conditions such as HIV/AIDS, 
tuberculosis, neglected tropical diseases and malaria, and diarrhea, lower 
respiratory infections, meningitis, and other common infectious diseases.
CONCLUSION: The Global Health Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry reveals a 
growing and diverse field of cost-per-DALY averted studies. However, study 
methods and reporting practices have varied substantially.

OBJECTIVES: To validate trajectories of late-life mobility change using a novel 
approach designed to overcome the constraints of modest sample size and few 
follow-up time points.
METHODS: Using clinical reasoning and distribution-based methodology, we 
identified trajectories of mobility change (Late Life Function and Disability 
Instrument) across 2 years in 391 participants age ≥65 years from a prospective 
cohort study designed to identify modifiable impairments predictive of mobility 
in late-life. We validated our approach using model fit indices and comparing 
baseline mobility-related factors between trajectories.
RESULTS: Model fit indices confirmed that the optimal number of trajectories 
were between 4 and 6. Mobility-related factors varied across trajectories with 
the most unfavorable values in poor mobility trajectories and the most favorable 
in high mobility trajectories. These factors included leg strength, trunk 
extension endurance, knee flexion range of motion, limb velocity, physical 
performance measures, and the number and prevalence of medical conditions 
including osteoarthritis and back pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the validity of this approach and may 
facilitate the investigation of a broader scope of research questions within 
aging populations of varied sizes and traits.

Microhyla sholigari is an endangered frog described in the year 2000. The 
original description was based on non-adult types and lacked information on 
several morphological characters, call structure, genetic material and 
photographs of the animal in life. The absence of such information posed 
challenges in field identification of this species. Since the original 
description, there is one other reported sighting of this species from Kerala in 
2001. We encountered specimens that we confer to this species based on 
morphological similarity to the subadult holotype, from several new localities 
within and outside the Western Ghats of Karnataka. We here redescribe the 
species based on additional adult vouchers, provide molecular data, describe the 
advertisement call and report a range extension. Based on its current 
distribution, we assess the threat status of the species and suggest listing it 
as Least Concern according to IUCN Red List criteria. Our paper bridges an 
important gap in the knowledge of the genus Microhyla in India and highlights 
the importance of systematic surveys in documenting and understanding amphibian 
diversity in the region.

Transplant-related survival benefit is calculated as the difference between life 
expectancy with transplantation and life expectancy without transplantation. 
Determining eligibility and prioritization for liver transplantation based on 
the highest survival benefit is a superior strategy to prioritization based on 
the highest urgency (ie, the highest wait-list mortality) or the highest utility 
(ie, the highest posttransplant survival) because prioritization based on the 
highest survival benefit maximizes the overall life expectancy of all patients 
in need of liver transplantation. Although the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease 
(MELD)-based prioritization system was designed as an urgency-based system, in 
practice it functions to a large extent as a survival benefit-based system, when 
the natural MELD score is used without exceptions. Survival benefit 
considerations should be used to determine the consequences of deviating from 
prioritization based on the natural MELD score, such as when exception points 
are awarded to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that are independent 
of MELD score or tumor burden, or the appropriateness of expanding eligibility 
for transplantation. The most promising application of survival benefit-based 
prioritization would be to replace the current system of prioritization of 
patients with HCC by one that uses their natural MELD score and tumor 
characteristics such as HCC tumor burden, serum alpha fetoprotein level, and 
response to locoregional therapies to predict the impact on survival benefit 
caused by the presence of HCC and adjust the natural MELD score for 
prioritization accordingly. Liver Transplantation 23 652-662, 2017 AASLD.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to analyze health-related quality-of-life (HrQoL) 
outcomes of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) 
based on data from GARY (German Aortic Valve Registry).
BACKGROUND: Typically, patients currently referred for and treated by TAVR are 
elderly with a concomitant variable spectrum of multiple comorbidities, 
disabilities, and limited life expectancy. Beyond mortality and morbidity, the 
assessment of HrQoL is of paramount importance not only to guide 
patient-centered clinical decision-making but also to judge this new treatment 
modality in this high-risk patient population.
METHODS: In 2011, 3,875 patients undergoing TAVR were included in the GARY 
registry. HrQoL was prospectively measured using the EuroQol 5 dimensions 
questionnaire self-complete version on paper at baseline and 1 year.
RESULTS: Complete follow-up EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire evaluation was 
available for 2,288 patients (transvascular transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement [TAVR-TV]: n = 1,626 and transapical TAVR [TAVR-TA]: n = 662). 
In-hospital mortality was 5.9% (n = 229) and the 1-year mortality was 23% (n = 
893). The baseline visual analog scale score for general health status was 52.6% 
for TAVR-TV and 55.8% for TAVR-TA and, in parallel to an improvement in New York 
Heart Association functional class, improved to 59.6% and 58.5% at 1 year, 
respectively (p < 0.001). Between baseline and 1 year, the number of patients 
reporting no complaints increased by 7.8% (TAVR-TV) and by 3.5% within the 
mobility dimension, and by 14.1% (TAVR-TV) and 9.2% within the usual activity 
dimension, whereas only moderate changes were found for the self-care, pain or 
discomfort, and anxiety or depression dimensions. In a multiple linear 
regression analysis several pre- and post-operative factors were predictive for 
less pronounced HrQoL benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR treatment led to improvements in HrQoL, especially in terms of 
mobility and usual activities. The magnitude of improvements was higher in the 
TAVR-TV group as compared to the TAVR-TA group. However, there was a sizable 
group of patients who did not derive any HrQoL benefits. Several independent 
pre- and post-operative factors were identified being predictive for less 
pronounced HrQoL benefits.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the technique of laparoscopic approach in a rare 
case of rectovaginal splenosis with severe dyspareunia and dyschesia.
DESIGN: A step-by-step explanation of the patient's condition, diagnosis, 
surgical technique, and postoperative results (Canadian Task Force 
classification II-3).
SETTING: Splenosis consists of ectopic functioning splenic tissue that can be 
located anywhere within the abdomen or pelvis. Fragments are often multiple and 
range in diameter from a few millimeters to a few centimeters. They are 
reddish-blue and are sessile or pedunculated. Their appearance can mimic that of 
neoplasms or endometriosis, which are the main differential diagnoses. Trauma 
and subsequent splenectomy is the cause in most cases. Splenosis is a benign 
condition usually found incidentally and is usually asymptomatic. The need for 
therapy is controversial, and treatment is suggested only in symptomatic cases, 
primarily those related to pelvic or abdominal lesions, as in our patient. The 
diagnosis of splenosis in a woman complaining of pelvic pain may present 
diagnostic difficulties. The splenic tissue has the macroscopic appearance of 
endometriosis, and its position in the pelvis also may suggest this diagnosis. 
Where excision of splenosis is considered necessary, the approach should be 
laparoscopic, unless this is considered too risky owing to the proximity of 
vital structures.
INTERVENTION: A 40-year-old woman was referred to our department for severe 
dyspareunia and dyschezia. The gynecologic examination revealed a painfull 
nodularity on the posterior vaginal cul de sac. Further evaluation with 2- and 
3-dimensional ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed several soft 
tissue nodules in the pouch of Douglas (POD), which were enhanced on contrast 
administration. She had undergone a splenectomy 15 years earlier after a car 
accident. A laparoscopic approach to a rectovaginal nodularity was performed. 
Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal decubitus 
position with her arms alongside her body and her legs in abduction. 
Pneumoperitoneum was achieved using a Veres needle placed at the umbilicus. Four 
trocars were placed: a 10-mm trocar at the umbilicus for the 0-degree 
laparoscope; a 5-mm trocar at the right anterosuperior iliac spine; a 5-mm 
trocar in the midline between the umbilicus and the pubic symphysis, 
approximately 8 to 10 cm inferior to the umbilical trocar; and a 5-mm trocar at 
the left anterosuperior iliac spine. The entire pelvis was inspected for 
endometriotic lesions. In the pelvis, hypervascular and bluish nodules were 
visible with extension from the POD into the deep rectovaginal space. The 
macroscopic appearance was atypical for endometriotic implants. The nodularities 
were carefully dissected and excised, and histological assessment revealed 
splenic tissue. At the time of this report, the patient had been asymptomatic 
for 6 months after surgery.
CONCLUSION: Rectovaginal splenosis may mimic endometriosis. The laparoscopic 
approach to rectovaginal splenosis avoids an abdominal incision, with its 
associated pain and possible adhesion formation. It also provides a better view 
for dissection. In this patient, the splenosis was removed by laparoscopy, with 
no postoperative dyspareunia or dyschesia.

Despite improvement of therapeutic treatments for breast cancer, the development 
of brain metastases has become a major limitation to life expectancy for many 
patients. Brain metastases show very commonly alterations in EGFR and HER2 
driven pathways, of which PTEN is an important regulator. Here, we analyzed PTEN 
expression in 111 tissue samples of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM). Loss 
of PTEN was found in a substantial proportion of BCBM samples (48.6%) and was 
significantly associated with triple-negative breast cancer (67.5%, p = 0.001) 
and a shorter survival time after surgical resection of brain metastases (p = 
0.048). Overexpression of PTEN in brain-seeking MDA-MB-231 BR cells in vitro 
reduced activation of the AKT pathway, notably by suppression of Akt1 kinase 
activity. Furthermore, the migration of MDA-MB-231 BR cells in vitro was 
promoted by co-culturing with both astrocytes and microglial cells. 
Interestingly, when PTEN was overexpressed the migration was significantly 
inhibited. Moreover, in an ex vivo organotypic brain slice model, PTEN 
overexpression reduced invasion of tumor cells. This was accompanied by reduced 
astrocyte activation that was mediated by autocrine and paracrine activation of 
GM-CSF/ CSF2RA and AKT/ PTEN pathways. In conclusion, loss of PTEN is frequently 
detected in triple-negative BCBM patients and associated with poor prognosis. 
The findings of our functional studies suggest that PTEN loss promotes a 
feedback loop between tumor cells and glial cells, which might contribute to 
disease progression.

INTRODUCTION: Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating mental disorder that 
affects the patient's and their family's quality of life, as well as financial 
costs and health care settings. Despite the variety of available antipsychotics, 
optimal treatment outcomes are not always achieved. Novel drugs, such as 
iloperidone, can provide more effective, tolerable and safer strategies.
AIM: To review the evidence for the clinical impact of iloperidone on the 
treatment of patients with schizophrenia.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: Clinical trials, observational studies and meta-analyses 
reached a common consensus that iloperidone is as effective as haloperidol, 
risperidone and ziprasidone in reducing schizophrenia symptoms. Similar amounts 
of adverse events and discontinuations were observed with iloperidone compared 
to placebo and active treatments. Common adverse events are mild and include 
dizziness, hypotension, dry mouth and weight gain. Iloperidone can induce 
extension of QTc interval, and clinicians should be aware of its 
contraindications. In long-term trials, iloperidone also showed promising safety 
and tolerability profiles. The low propensity to cause akathisia, extrapyramidal 
symptoms (EPS), increased prolactin levels or changes to metabolic laboratory 
parameters support its use in practice. Results showed that iloperidone prevents 
relapse in stabilized patients, with a time to relapse superior to placebo and 
similar to haloperidol. Patients using a prior antipsychotic (eg, risperidone 
and aripiprazole) can easily switch to iloperidone with no serious impact on 
safety or efficacy. However, the acquisition costs of iloperidone may hamper its 
use. Further evidence comparing iloperidone with other antipsychotics, and 
pharmacoeconomic studies would be welcome.
PLACE IN THERAPY: Considering just the clinical profile of iloperidone, it 
represents a promising drug for treating schizophrenia, particularly in patients 
who are intolerant to previous antipsychotics, as well as being suitable as 
first-line therapy. Cost-effectiveness comparisons are needed to justify its use 
in clinical practice.
