BACKGROUND: Muscle force is important for daily life and sports and can be 
measured with a handheld dynamometer. Reference values are employed to quantify 
a subject's muscle force. It is not unambiguous whether reference values can be 
generalized to other populations. Objectives in this study were; first to 
confirm the reliability of the utilization of hand-held dynamometers for 
isometric strength measurement; second to determine reference values for a 
population of Dutch workers; third to compare these values with those of a USA 
population.
METHODS: 462 Healthy working subjects (259 male, 203 female) were included in 
this study. Their age ranged from 20 to 60 years with a mean (sd) of 41 (11) 
years. Muscle force values from elbow flexion and extension, knee flexion and 
extension, and shoulder abduction were measured with the break method using a 
MicroFet 2 hand-held dynamometer. Reliability was analyzed by calculating ICC's 
and limits of agreement. Muscle force expressed in Newton, means, and confidence 
intervals were determined for males and females in age groups ranging from 
twenty to sixty years old. Regression equations and explained variances were 
calculated from weight, height, age, and gender. The mean values and 95% CI were 
compared to the results from other studies.
RESULTS: Reliability was good; the ICC ranged between 0.83 to 0.94. The 
explained variance ranged from 0.25 to 0.51. Comparison of data for the Dutch 
population mean muscle force values with those from the USA revealed important 
differences between muscle force reference values for the American and Dutch 
populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Muscle force measurements demonstrate a sound reliability. 
Reference values and regressions equations are made available for the Dutch 
population. Comparison with other studies indicates that reference values differ 
between countries.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the treatment of advanced 
hormone-dependent prostate cancer with degarelix compared to luteinizing 
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists in the UK using the latest available 
evidence and the model submitted to AWMSG.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed from the perspective of the UK 
National Health Service evaluating monthly injection of degarelix against 
3-monthly leuprorelin therapy plus anti-androgen flare cover for the first-line 
treatment of patients with advanced (locally advanced or metastatic) 
hormone-dependent prostate cancer. A Markov process model was constructed using 
the patient population characteristics and efficacy information from the CS21 
Phase III clinical trial and associated extension study (CS21A). The 
intention-to-treat (ITT) population and a high-risk sub-group with a PSA level 
>20 ng/mL were modeled.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis using the patient access scheme (PAS) price, 
degarelix was dominant compared to leuprorelin with cost savings of £3633 in the 
ITT population and £4310 in the PSA > 20 ng/mL sub-group. The chance of being 
cost-effective was 95% in the ITT population and 96% in the PSA > 20 ng/mL 
sub-group at a threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). In 
addition, degarelix remained dominant when PSA progression was assumed equal and 
only the benefits of preventing testosterone flare were taken into account. 
Treatment with degarelix also remained dominant in both populations when the 
list price was used. The additional investment required to treat patients with 
degarelix could be offset in 19 months for the ITT population and 13 months for 
the PSA > 20 ng/mL population. The model was most sensitive to the hazard ratio 
assumed for PSA progression between degarelix and leuprorelin and the 
quality-of-life (utility) of patients receiving palliative care.
CONCLUSION: Degarelix is likely to be cost-effective compared to leuprorelin 
plus anti-androgen flare cover in the first-line treatment of advanced 
hormone-dependent prostate cancer.

The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is an example of an effective 
intervention with high up-front costs and delayed benefits. It has become a 
proven and well-accepted therapy not only for secondary but also for primary 
prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic 
heart disease. In recent years, the international guidelines have extended the 
indications to the prophylactic ICD, increasing the number of eligible patients 
and, together, the financial challenges of a widespread implementation. In this 
article, we review the available economic tools that can help address the ICD 
cost issue. We think that the awareness of such knowledge may facilitate 
dialogues between physicians, administrators and policy-makers, and help foster 
rational decision making.

BACKGROUND: EQ-5D is a widely used generic measure of health with a 'tariff', or 
preference weights, obtained from the general population, using time trade-off 
(TTO). PRET (Preparatory study for the Re-valuation of the EQ-5D Tariff project) 
contributes towards the methodology for its revaluation.
METHODS: Stage 1 examined key assumptions typically involved in health-state 
valuations through a series of binary choice exercises, namely that health-state 
preferences are independent of (1) duration of the state; (2) whose health it is 
(i.e. perspective); (3) length of 'lead time' (a mechanism to value all states 
on the same scale, including those who are worse than being dead); (4) when 
health events take place (time preference); and (5) satisfaction associated with 
the state. Further topics addressed were (6) exhaustion of lead time in the 
worst state; (7) health-state valuation using discrete choice experiments (DCEs) 
with a duration attribute; and (8) binary choice administration of lead time - 
time trade-off (LT-TTO). Stage 1 consisted of an online survey with 6000 
respondents. Stage 2 compared the results above to those of an identical survey 
conducted in 200 face-to-face computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPIs), 
covering topics (1) to (7). Stages 3 and 4 examined - in more detail and depth - 
issues taken from stage 1. Stage 3 consisted of CAPI surveys of a representative 
UK sample of 300, using examples of TTO, LT-TTO, and DCE with duration, each 
followed by extensive feedback questions. Stage 4 was a more intensive exercise 
involving a qualitative analysis of people's thought processes during both 
binary choice and iterative health-state valuation exercises. Data were 
collected through 'think-aloud' methods in 30 interviews of a convenience 
sample.
RESULTS: Stage 1 found that health-state values are not independent of (1) 
duration of the state but there is no clear pattern; (2) whose health it is; (3) 
the duration of 'lead time' but there was no clear pattern; (4) when health 
events take place; or (5) satisfaction associated with the state. Furthermore, 
(6) exhaustion of lead time in the worst state was subject to substantial 
framing effects; (7) the five-level version of the EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) can be 
valued using DCE with duration as an attribute; and (8) binary choice LT-TTO can 
be administered in an online environment. Stage 2 found that although online 
surveys and CAPI surveys resulted in different compositions of respondents, at 
the aggregate, their responses to the experimental questions covering (1) to (7) 
above were not statistically significantly different from each other. Stages 3 
and 4 found that TTO and LT-TTO were easier than DCE with duration; respondents 
did not necessarily trade across all attributes of EQ-5D; some respondents found 
it difficult to distinguish between the two worst levels of EQ-5D-5L, and some 
respondents may be thinking about the impact of their ill health on their 
family.
CONCLUSIONS: In order for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
to make the most appropriate decisions, the EQ-5D tariff needs to incorporate 
the latest understanding of health-state preferences. PRET contributed to the 
knowledge base on the conduct of health-state valuation studies.
FUNDING: The Medical Research Council (MRC)-National Institute for Health 
Research (NIHR) Methodology Research Programme funded the PRET project (MRC ref. 
G0901500), and the EuroQol Group funded the PRET-AS project (Preparatory study 
for the Re-valuation of the EQ-5D Tariff project - Additional Sample) as an 
extension to the PRET project with formal agreement from the MRC.

BACKGROUND: Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant 
subtype of oesophageal carcinoma in China, with the overall 5-year survival rate 
of <10%. The current tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system has become so 
complex that it is not easy to use in the life expectancy assessment. We aim to 
combine clinical variables and biomarkers to develop and validate a relative 
simple and reliable model, named the FENSAM, for ESCC prognosis.
METHODS: To build the FENSAM, we analysed 22 potential prognostic factors from 
461 patients, including 9 biomarkers (Ezrin, Fascin, desmocollin 2 (DSC2), 
pFascin, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), connective-tissue growth 
factor (CTGF), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), NGAL receptor 
(NGALR), and cysteine-rich angiogenic protein 61 (CYR61)) and other 13 clinical 
variables. We selected significant factors associated with survival of ESCC 
patients, and used them to build our FENSAM model. We then obtained the hazard 
risk score of the model to classify ESCC patients. In addition, we validated the 
model in an independent cohort of 290 patients from the same hospital. The 
predictive performance of the model was assessed by the Area under the Receiver 
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
RESULTS: We found six markers significantly associated with survival of ESCC 
patients (Ezrin, Fascin, ATF3, surgery extent, N-stage, and M-stage). They were 
combined to create a novel four-stage FENSAM model for patients' classification. 
FENSAM possessed a high classification precision similar to the TNM staging 
system, but with a much simpler model. The efficiency of FENSAM was evaluated by 
different quantiles of AUC and the results of survival analysis. The validation 
result demonstrated the potential of the FENSAM model to improve classification 
accuracy for ESCC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: FENSAM provides an alternative classifier for ESCC patients with a 
high classification precision using a simple model.

The history and reception of Charles Darwin's hypothesis of pangenesis.

15213, USA, kate.holterhoff@gmail.com.

This paper explores Charles Darwin's hypothesis of pangenesis through a popular 
and professional reception history. First published in The Variation of Animals 
and Plants under Domestication (1868), pangenesis stated that inheritance can be 
explained by sub-cellular "gemmules" which aggregated in the sexual organs 
during intercourse. Pangenesis thereby accounted for the seemingly arbitrary 
absence and presence of traits in offspring while also clarifying some botanical 
and invertebrates' limb regeneration abilities. I argue that critics largely 
interpreted Variation as an extension of On the Origin of Species by Means of 
Natural Selection (1859), while pangenesis was an extension of natural 
selection. Contrary to claims that pangenesis was divorced from natural 
selection by its reliance on the inheritance of acquired characters, 
pangenesis's mid nineteenth-century reception suggests that Darwin's hypothesis 
responded directly to selection's critics. Using Variation's several editions, 
periodical reviews, and personal correspondence I assess pangenesis popularly, 
professionally, and biographically to better understand Variation's impact on 
1860s and 70s British evolutionism and inheritance.

Acceleration kinematics in cricketers: implications for performance in the 
field.

University of Newcastle , Australia.

Cricket fielding often involves maximal acceleration to retrieve the ball. There 
has been no analysis of acceleration specific to cricketers, or for players who 
field primarily in the infield (closer to the pitch) or outfield (closer to the 
boundary). This study analyzed the first two steps of a 10-m sprint in 
experienced cricketers. Eighteen males (age = 24.06 ± 4.87 years; height = 1.81 
± 0.06 m; mass = 79.67 ± 10.37 kg) were defined as primarily infielders (n = 10) 
or outfielders (n = 8). Timing lights recorded 0-5 and 0-10 m time. Motion 
capture measured first and second step kinematics, including: step length; step 
frequency; contact time; shoulder motion; lead and rear arm elbow angle; drive 
leg hip and knee extension, and ankle plantar flexion; swing leg hip and knee 
flexion, and ankle dorsi flexion. A one-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05) 
determined between-group differences. Data was pooled for a Pearson's 
correlation analysis (p < 0.05) to analyze kinematic relationships. There were 
no differences in sprint times, and few variables differentiated infielders and 
outfielders. Left shoulder range of motion related to second step length (r = 
0.471). First step hip flexion correlated with both step lengths (r = 
0.570-0.598), and frequencies (r = -0.504--0.606). First step knee flexion 
related to both step lengths (r = 0.528-0.682), and first step frequency (r = 
-0.669). First step ankle plantar flexion correlated with second step length (r 
= -0.692) and frequency (r = 0.726). Greater joint motion ranges related to 
longer steps. Cricketers display similar sprint kinematics regardless of 
fielding position, likely because players may field in the infield or outfield 
depending on match situation. Due to relationships with shoulder and leg motion, 
and the importance and trainability of step length, cricketers should target 
this variable to enhance acceleration. Key PointsRegardless of whether 
cricketers field predominantly in the infield or outfield, they will produce 
relatively similar sprint acceleration kinematics. This is likely due to the 
fact that cricketers will often field in both areas of the cricket ground, 
depending on the requirements of the match.Due to the complexity of sprint 
acceleration, there were relatively few significant correlations between 
technique variables. However, step length had positive relationships with 
shoulder range of motion, swing leg hip and knee flexion, and drive leg ankle 
plantar flexion.As previous research has established the importance of step 
length to acceleration, as well as the trainability of this kinematic variable, 
training specifically to improve step length could lead to enhanced sprint 
acceleration in cricketers.

after heavy eccentric exercise.

A clinical study was undertaken to evaluate the associations between the tissue 
levels of omega-3 (N3), also known as the Omega-3 Index (N3 Index), on various 
clinical and quality of life outcomes in healthy young adults after heavy 
eccentric exercise.. To ensure an adequate number of participants with an 
elevated N3 index would be available for comparison to those with a lower N3 
Index, a subgroup of the study participants received N3 dietary supplementation 
(2.7 g·d(-1)) for 30 days prior to the performance of the heavy eccentric 
exercise. The remaining participants received a placebo supplement for the same 
30-day period. After 30 days of supplementation, participants performed an 
eccentric exercise routine and were then measured at baseline (time 0), 24-, 
48-, 72-, and 96 hours respectively on the following outcomes; C-reactive 
protein (CRP) and creatine kinase. Blood lactate levels were analyzed 
immediately after the exercise. Functional measurements of delayed onset of 
muscle soreness (DOMS), extension and torque were also analyzed. Quality of life 
(QOL) was measured by the quantitative questionnaire, the Profile of Mood States 
Questionnaire (POMS). Safety monitoring and analysis of adverse events was 
continuous throughout the study. Differences as demonstrated by a reduction in 
pain following eccentric exercise was experienced at both 72 and 96 hour time 
points in subjects with a higher N3 Index however there were no differences in 
extension or strength between the two groups. There was a significant difference 
in blood lactate levels (p = 0.0309) and improved emotional stability, reflected 
by the POMS questionnaire, in subjects with a higher N3 Index level. There was a 
statistically significant difference in CRP levels in subjects with a higher N3 
Index level at 24 hours and a trend toward significance over 96 hours. There 
were no significant differences in creatine kinase levels and no reported 
adverse events. Subjects with a higher Omega-3 (N3) Index reported less pain 
related to DOMS following heavy exercise at 72 and 96 hours post-exercise. 
Reduced pain in the higher N3 Index Group may be due to an increased 
concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in the muscle cell walls, thus triggering a 
higher elasticity, flexibility and lower risk of physical damage to muscle 
tissue during exercise. Serum levels of blood lactate were lower in subjects 
with a high N3 Index, CRP was reduced at 24 hours and POMS scores were improved 
in high N3 Index subjects demonstrating better QOL. No serious adverse events 
were reported further supporting that omega-3 dietary supplementation is safe, 
bio-available and may improve athletic performance and well being in healthy 
young adults. Key PointsOmega-3 index (N3) is elevated after supplementation 
versus placebo in healthy young adultsSubjects with higher N3 index demonstrated 
reduced DOMS after heavy exerciseSubjects with higher N3 index reported better 
quality of life.

Risk assessment considers the situations and characteristics of the exposure 
environment and host. Various physiological variables of the human body reflects 
the characteristics of the population that can directly influence risk exposure. 
Therefore, identification of exposure factors based on the Korean population is 
required for appropriate risk assessment. It is expected that a handbook about 
general exposure factors will be used by professionals in many fields as well as 
the risk assessors of the health department. The process of developing the 
exposure factors handbook for the Korean population will be introduced in this 
article, with a specific focus on the general exposure factors including life 
expectancy, body weight, surface area, inhalation rates, amount of water intake, 
and soil ingestion targeting the Korean population. The researchers used 
national databases including the Life Table and the 2005 Time Use Survey from 
the National Statistical Office. The anthropometric study of size in Korea used 
the resources provided by the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards. In 
addition, direct measurement and questionnaire surveys of representative samples 
were performed to calculate the inhalation rate, drinking water intake, and soil 
ingestion.

Economic analysis of aprepitant-containing regimen to prevent 
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients receiving highly emetogenic 
chemotherapy in Hong Kong.

Cancer, Department of Clinical Oncology, Hong Kong Cancer Institute and Prince 
of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.

AIM: We aim to evaluate the cost effectiveness of aprepitant-containing regimens 
for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) among 
patients receiving high emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) in Hong Kong.
METHODS: Both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were conducted 
utilizing a decision-analytic model to measure the economic costs and clinical 
outcomes associated with the aprepitant-containing regimen versus a standard 
regimen in the prevention of CINV. Analyses were conducted on the basis of four 
published double-blind randomized clinical trials involving different usages of 
serotonin receptor antagonists.
RESULTS: The use of aprepitant-containing regimens is associated with an 
improvement in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with non-aprepitant 
regimens. For cisplatin-based chemotherapy, the incremental cost per QALY gained 
is HKD 239,644 (1 USD approximates HKD 7.8) when ondansetron is administered on 
day 1 only. The incremental cost per QALY is HKD 440,950 when ondansetron is 
used on day 1 to 4. For anthracycline and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, the 
aprepitant-containing regimen is associated with incremental cost of HKD 195,442 
per QALY gained. Similar results were obtained when other 5HT3 receptor 
antagonists are used. The use of aprepitant was associated with higher cost of 
drug but lower costs of emesis-related management. With the cost-effectiveness 
threshold set at the World Health Organization endorsed criteria of three times 
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (three times GDP per capita in Hong Kong 
in 2011 is HKD 798,078), the current analyses showed that the 
aprepitant-containing regimen was cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing HEC, the use of aprepitant as the 
anti-emetic is cost-effective in Hong Kong.

AIM: While Indigenous people in Queensland have lower colorectal cancer (CRC) 
incidence and mortality than the rest of the population, CRC remains the third 
most frequent cancer among Australian Indigenous people overall. This study 
aimed to investigate patterns of care and survival between Indigenous and 
non-Indigenous Australians with CRC.
METHODS: Through a matched-cohort design we compared 80 Indigenous and 85 
non-Indigenous people all diagnosed with CRC and treated in Queensland public 
hospitals during 1998-2004 (frequency matched on age, sex, geographical 
remoteness). We compared clinical and treatment data (Pearson's chi-square) and 
all-cause and cancer survival (Cox regression analysis).
RESULTS: Indigenous patients with CRC were not significantly more likely to have 
comorbidity, advanced disease at diagnosis or less treatment than non-Indigenous 
people. There was also no statistically significant difference in all-cause 
survival (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.69, 1.89) or cancer survival (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.60, 
1.69) between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Similar CRC mortality among Indigenous and other Australians may 
reflect both the lower incidence and adequate management. Increasing life 
expectancy and exposures to risk factors suggests that Indigenous people are 
vulnerable to a growing burden of CRC. Primary prevention and early detection 
will be of paramount importance to future CRC control among Indigenous 
Australians. Current CRC management must be maintained and include prevention 
measures to ensure that predicted increases in CRC burden are minimized.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is affecting millions of people every year and it 
is characterized by impaired ventricular performance, exercise intolerance and 
shortened life expectancy. Despite significant advancements in drug therapy, 
mortality of the disease remains excessively high, as heart transplant remains 
the gold standard treatment for end-stage HF when no contraindications subsist. 
Traditionally, implanted Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) have been employed in 
order to provide circulatory support to patients who cannot survive the waiting 
time to transplantation, reducing the workload imposed on the heart. In many 
cases that process could recover its contractility performance.
OBJECTIVES: The SensorART platform focuses on the management and remote 
treatment of patients suffering from HF. It provides an interoperable, 
extendable and VAD-independent solution, which incorporates various hardware and 
software components in a holistic approach, in order to improve the quality of 
the patients' treatment and the workflow of the specialists. This paper focuses 
on the description and analysis of Specialist's Decision Support System (SDSS), 
an innovative component of the SensorART platform.
METHODS: The SDSS is a Web-based tool that assists specialists on designing the 
therapy plan for their patients before and after VAD implantation, analyzing 
patients' data, extracting new knowledge, and making informative decisions.
RESULTS: SDSS offers support to medical and VAD experts through the different 
phases of VAD therapy, incorporating several tools covering all related fields; 
Statistics, Association Rules, Monitoring, Treatment, Weaning, Speed and Suction 
Detection.
CONCLUSIONS: SDSS and its modules have been tested in a number of patients and 
the results are encouraging.

BACKGROUND: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) burden consists of years of life lost 
from IHD deaths and years of disability lived with 3 nonfatal IHD sequelae: 
nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and ischemic heart 
failure. Our aim was to estimate the global and regional burden of IHD in 1990 
and 2010.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Global and regional estimates of acute myocardial 
infarction incidence and angina and heart failure prevalence by age, sex, and 
world region in 1990 and 2010 were estimated based on data from a systematic 
review and nonlinear mixed-effects meta-regression methods. Age-standardized 
acute myocardial infarction incidence and angina prevalence decreased globally 
between 1990 and 2010; ischemic heart failure prevalence increased slightly. The 
global burden of IHD increased by 29 million disability-adjusted life-years (29% 
increase) between 1990 and 2010. About 32.4% of the growth in global IHD 
disability-adjusted life-years between 1990 and 2010 was attributable to aging 
of the world population, 22.1% was attributable to population growth, and total 
disability-adjusted life-years were attenuated by a 25.3% decrease in per capita 
IHD burden (decreased rate). The number of people living with nonfatal IHD 
increased more than the number of IHD deaths since 1990, but >90% of IHD 
disability-adjusted life-years in 2010 were attributable to IHD deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, age-standardized acute myocardial infarction incidence 
and angina prevalence have decreased, and ischemic heart failure prevalence has 
increased since 1990. Despite decreased age-standardized fatal and nonfatal IHD 
in most regions since 1990, population growth and aging led to a higher global 
burden of IHD in 2010.

The effect of temperature on reproduction in the summer and winter annual 
Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Bur and Cvi.

Warwickshire CV35 9EF, UK.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Seed yield and dormancy status are key components of 
species fitness that are influenced by the maternal environment, in particular 
temperature. Responses to environmental conditions can differ between ecotypes 
of the same species. Therefore, to investigate the effect of maternal 
environment on seed production, this study compared two contrasting Arabidopsis 
thaliana ecotypes, Cape Verdi Isle (Cvi) and Burren (Bur). Cvi is adapted to a 
hot dry climate and Bur to a cool damp climate, and they exhibit winter and 
summer annual phenotypes, respectively.
METHODS: Bur and Cvi plants were grown in reciprocal controlled environments 
that simulated their native environments. Reproductive development, seed 
production and subsequent germination behaviour were investigated. Measurements 
included: pollen viability, the development of floral structure, and germination 
at 10 and 25 °C in the light to determine dormancy status. Floral development 
was further investigated by applying gibberellins (GAs) to alter the 
pistil:stamen ratio.
KEY RESULTS: Temperature during seed development determined seed dormancy 
status. In addition, seed yield was greatly reduced by higher temperature, 
especially in Bur (>90 %) compared with Cvi (approx. 50 %). The reproductive 
organs (i.e. stamens) of Bur plants were very sensitive to high temperature 
during early flowering. Viability of pollen was unaffected, but limited filament 
extension relative to that of the pistils resulted in failure to pollinate. Thus 
GA applied to flowers to enhance filament extension largely overcame the effect 
of high temperature on yield.
CONCLUSIONS: High temperature in the maternal environment reduced dormancy and 
negatively affected the final seed yield of both ecotypes; however, the extent 
of these responses differed, demonstrating natural variation. Reduced seed yield 
in Bur resulted from altered floral development not reduced pollen viability. 
Future higher temperatures will impact on seed performance, but the consequences 
may differ significantly between ecotypes of the same species.

Cost-effectiveness of treatment of diabetic macular edema.

Pershing S, Enns EA, Matesic B, Owens DK, Goldhaber-Fiebert JD.

Comment in
    Indian J Ophthalmol. 2023 Nov;71(11):3448-3453.

BACKGROUND: Macular edema is the most common cause of vision loss among patients 
with diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of different treatments of 
diabetic macular edema (DME).
DESIGN: Markov model.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature and expert opinion.
TARGET POPULATION: Patients with clinically significant DME.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: Laser treatment, intraocular injections of triamcinolone or a 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, or a combination of both.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted costs, gains in quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: All treatments except laser monotherapy 
substantially reduced costs, and all treatments except triamcinolone monotherapy 
increased QALYs. Laser treatment plus a VEGF inhibitor achieved the greatest 
benefit, gaining 0.56 QALYs at a cost of $6975 for an ICER of $12 410 per QALY 
compared with laser treatment plus triamcinolone. Monotherapy with a VEGF 
inhibitor achieved similar outcomes to combination therapy with laser treatment 
plus a VEGF inhibitor. Laser monotherapy and triamcinolone monotherapy were less 
effective and more costly than combination therapy.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: VEGF inhibitor monotherapy was sometimes 
preferred over laser treatment plus a VEGF inhibitor, depending on the reduction 
in quality of life with loss of visual acuity. When the VEGF inhibitor 
bevacizumab was as effective as ranibizumab, it was preferable because of its 
lower cost.
LIMITATION: Long-term outcome data for treated and untreated diseases are 
limited.
CONCLUSION: The most effective treatment of DME is VEGF inhibitor injections 
with or without laser treatment. This therapy compares favorably with 
cost-effective interventions for other conditions.

Is individualized medicine more cost-effective? A systematic review.

Germany, Maximilian.Hatz@uni-hamburg.de.

BACKGROUND: Individualized medicine (IM) is a rapidly evolving field that is 
associated with both visions of more effective care at lower costs and fears of 
highly priced, low-value interventions. It is unclear which view is supported by 
the current evidence.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to systematically review the health economic 
evidence related to IM and to derive general statements on its 
cost-effectiveness.
DATA SOURCES: A literature search of MEDLINE database for English- and 
German-language studies was conducted.
STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHOD: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility 
studies for technologies meeting the MEDLINE medical subject headings (MeSH) 
definition of IM (genetically targeted interventions) were reviewed. This was 
followed by a standardized extraction of general study characteristics and 
cost-effectiveness results.
RESULTS: Most of the 84 studies included in the synthesis were from the USA (n = 
43, 51 %), cost-utility studies (n = 66, 79 %), and published since 2005 (n = 
60, 71 %). The results ranged from dominant to dominated. The median value 
(cost-utility studies) was calculated to be rounded $US22,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (adjusted to $US, year 2008 values), 
which is equal to the rounded median cost-effectiveness in the peer-reviewed 
English-language literature according to a recent review. Many studies reported 
more than one strategy of IM with highly varying cost-effectiveness ratios. 
Generally, results differed according to test type, and tests for disease 
prognosis or screening appeared to be more favorable than tests to stratify 
patients by response or by risk of adverse effects. However, these results were 
not significant.
LIMITATIONS: Different definitions of IM could have been used. Quality 
assessment of the studies was restricted to analyzing transparency.
CONCLUSIONS: IM neither seems to display superior cost-effectiveness than other 
types of medical interventions nor to be economically inferior. Instead, rather 
than 'whether' healthcare was individualized, the question of 'how' it was 
individualized was of economic relevance.

OBJECTIVE: While metformin is generally accepted as the first-line agent in 
treatment of type 2 diabetes, there are insufficient evidence and extensive 
debate about the best second-line agent. We aimed to assess the benefits and 
harms of four commonly used antihyperglycemia treatment regimens considering 
clinical effectiveness, quality of life, and cost.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed and validated a new population-based 
glycemic control Markov model that simulates natural variation in HbA1c 
progression. The model was calibrated using a U.S. data set of privately insured 
individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. We compared treatment 
intensification of metformin monotherapy with sulfonylurea, dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 inhibitor, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, or insulin. 
Outcome measures included life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
mean time to insulin dependence, and expected medication cost per QALY from 
diagnosis to first diabetes complication (ischemic heart disease, myocardial 
infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, blindness, renal failure, 
amputation) or death.
RESULTS: According to our model, all regimens resulted in similar LYs and QALYs 
regardless of glycemic control goal, but the regimen with sulfonylurea incurred 
significantly lower cost per QALY and resulted in the longest time to insulin 
dependence. An HbA1c goal of 7% (53 mmol/mol) produced higher QALYs compared 
with a goal of 8% (64 mmol/mol) for all regimens.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of sulfonylurea as second-line therapy for type 2 diabetes 
generated glycemic control and QALYs comparable with those associated with other 
agents but at lower cost. A model that incorporates HbA1c and diabetes 
complications can serve as a useful clinical decision tool for selection of 
treatment options.

An experimental and morphometric test of the relationship between vertebral 
morphology and joint stiffness in Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus).

Despite their semi-aquatic mode of life, modern crocodylians use a wide range of 
terrestrial locomotor behaviours, including asymmetrical gaits otherwise only 
found in mammals. The key to these diverse abilities may lie in the axial 
skeleton. Correlations between vertebral morphology and both intervertebral 
joint stiffness and locomotor behaviour have been found in other animals, but 
the vertebral mechanics of crocodylians have not yet been experimentally and 
quantitatively tested. We measured the passive mechanics and morphology of the 
thoracolumbar vertebral column in Crocodylus niloticus in order to validate a 
method to infer intervertebral joint stiffness based on morphology. Passive 
stiffness of eight thoracic and lumbar joints was tested in dorsal extension, 
ventral flexion and mediolateral flexion using cadaveric specimens. Fifteen 
measurements that we deemed to be potential correlates of stiffness were taken 
from each vertebra and statistically tested for correlation with joint 
stiffness. We found that the vertebral column of C. niloticus is stiffer in 
dorsoventral flexion than in lateral flexion and, in contrast to that of many 
mammals, shows an increase in joint stiffness in the lumbar region. Our findings 
suggest that the role of the axial column in crocodylian locomotion may be 
functionally different from that in mammals, even during analogous gaits. A 
moderate proportion of variation in joint stiffness (R(2)=0.279-0.520) was 
predicted by centrum width and height, neural spine angle and lamina width. 
These results support the possible utility of some vertebral morphometrics in 
predicting mechanical properties of the vertebral column in crocodiles, which 
also should be useful for forming functional hypotheses of axial motion during 
locomotion in extinct archosaurs.

Role of quality measurement in inappropriate use of screening for colorectal 
cancer: retrospective cohort study.

Healthcare System, 2215 Fuller Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the age based quality measure for screening for 
colorectal cancer is associated with overuse of screening in patients aged 70-75 
in poor health and underuse in those aged over age 75 in good health.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study utilizing electronic data from the Veterans 
Affairs (VA) Health Care System, the largest integrated healthcare system in the 
United States.
SETTING: VA Health Care System.
PARTICIPANTS: Veterans aged ≥ 50 due for repeat average risk colorectal cancer 
screening at a primary care visit in fiscal year 2010.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Completion of colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or fecal occult 
blood testing within 24 months of the 2010 visit.
RESULTS: 399,067 veterans met inclusion/exclusion criteria (mean age 67, 97% 
men). Of these, 38% had electronically documented screening within 24 months. In 
multivariable log binomial regression adjusted for Charlson comorbidity index, 
sex, and number of primary care visits, screening decreased markedly after the 
age of 75 (the age cut off used by the quality measure) (adjusted relative risk 
0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.40). A veteran who was aged 75 and 
unhealthy (in whom life expectancy might be limited and screening more likely to 
result in net burden or harm) was significantly more likely to undergo screening 
than a veteran aged 76 and healthy (unadjusted relative risk 1.64, 1.36 to 
1.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Specification of a quality measure can have important implications 
for clinical care. Future quality measures should focus on individual 
risk/benefit to ensure that patients who are likely to benefit from a service 
receive it (regardless of age), and that those who are likely to incur harm are 
spared unnecessary and costly care.

Patients with lung cancer experience elevated risk of venous thromboembolism. 
Cancer patients with thrombosis have a shorter life expectancy and the 
occurrence of VTE worsens the quality of life and may delay, interrupt, or 
completely halt the cancer therapy. In a large cohort of lung cancer patients we 
monitored the incidence of venous thromboembolism and we identified groups of 
patients with the highest risk of venous thromboembolism suitable for 
antithrombotic prophylaxis, which could favourably affect their morbidity and 
mortality.

Polish population according to the National Census of Population and Housing, 
which was conducted in 2011, was 38 511.8 thousand. The average life expectancy 
in Poland is 71.0 years for men and 79.7 years for women. The reason for 
hospitalization in Poland are primarily cardiovascular disease (18%), tumors 
(11.4%), digestive diseases (10.6%), respiratory (9.3%), trauma (9.1%), 
infectious diseases (2.3%) and others (39%). Mortality rates determined on the 
basis of the analyzes and simulations in different disease groups indicates that 
the predominant causes of death of Polish citizens are strongly cardiovascular 
disease and cancer. Respiratory diseases occupy fourth place. World analyses 
clearly show that the number of deaths in 2030 due to lung diseases will be the 
fourth (COPD), fifth (pneumonia) and sixth (lung cancer) cause of death. As it 
turns out, the existence of various pathologies affecting the country's economic 
status. Respiratory allergies are observed more often, including in 
approximately 20% of Europeans are symptoms of allergic rhinitis (15-20% severe) 
and in 5-11% are diagnosed with asthma. Malignant tumors are the second most 
common causes of death in the group with the highest risk of life for the 
residents of Polish, particularly for men, is lung cancer, because of which in 
2001, 20 570 people died. Incurred costs of the social security system are 
mainly caused by inflammatory diseases of the respiratory system, which 
corresponds to the number of days of sick leave, especially in the age group 
19-28 years, with a decrease in the age group above 59 years of age. Numbers 
hospitalized for respiratory diseases according to data from the National Health 
Fund also clearly indicate the cause of inflammation and cancer, and in the 
population aged 41-60 years, the need for hospital treatment is multiplied. The 
data indicate the constant threat of respiratory diseases.
