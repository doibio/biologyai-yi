BACKGROUND: Poor diet quality has been linked to increased risk of many chronic 
diseases and premature mortality. Less research has considered dietary habits in 
relation to disease-free life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate the association of diet quality 
with cardiometabolic disease-free life expectancy between ages 50 and 85 y.
METHODS: Diet quality of 8041 participants of the Whitehall II cohort study was 
assessed with the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010) in 
1991-1994, 1997-1999, and 2002-2004. The measurement of diet quality closest to 
age 50 for each participant was used. We utilized repeat measures of 
cardiometabolic disease (coronary heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes) 
from the first observation when participants were aged ≥50 y. Multistate life 
table models with covariates age, gender, occupational position, smoking, 
physical activity, and alcohol consumption were used to estimate total and 
sex-specific cardiometabolic disease-free life expectancy from age 50 to 85 y 
for each AHEI-2010 quintile, where the lowest quintile represents unhealthiest 
dietary habits and the highest quintile the healthiest habits.
RESULTS: The number of cardiometabolic disease-free life-years after age 50 was 
23.9 y (95% CI: 23.0, 24.9 y) for participants with the healthiest diet, that 
is, a higher score on the AHEI-2010, and 21.4 y (95% CI: 20.6, 22.3 y) for 
participants with the unhealthiest diet. The association between diet quality 
and cardiometabolic disease-free life expectancy followed a dose-response 
pattern and was observed in subgroups of participants of different occupational 
position, BMI, physical activity level, and smoking habit, as well as when 
participants without cardiometabolic disease at baseline were excluded from 
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthier dietary habits are associated with cardiometabolic 
disease-free life expectancy between ages 50 and 85.

BACKGROUND: We perform an econometric assessment of the impact that 
pharmaceutical innovation had on the burden of disease in Ireland.
METHODS: We use a difference-in-differences (or two-way fixed effects) research 
design: we investigate whether diseases for which more new drugs were launched 
had larger subsequent reductions in mortality. This design controls for the 
effects of general economic and societal factors (e.g. income, education, and 
behavioral risk factors), to the extent that those effects are similar across 
diseases.
RESULTS: New Chemical Entities launched during 1983-1997 are estimated to have 
reduced the total number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost in 2015 
by about 234 600.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharmaceutical expenditure per DALY gained in 2015 from drugs 
launched during 1983-1997 was €1137, which indicates that the new drugs launched 
during 1983-1997 were very cost-effective, overall.

Independently of age, evidence-based guidelines recommend a multidisciplinary 
treatment approach in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). But 
actually, elderly patients are grossly underrepresented in clinical trials, 
accounting < 10% of enrolled cases. Therefore, LARC management in elderly 
patients remains a crucial issue in daily practice, especially due to their 
frailty. Multiple clinical factors, including general health status, cognitive 
status, co-morbidity, disability, and life expectancy should be considered to 
understand the complexities of geriatric assessment and then define therapy. We 
use a patient-centered approach in order to tailor the optimal treatment 
strategy. We treat fit elderly patients as younger patients, including 
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT), surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy. 
Whereas, in vulnerable and frail patients, we propose standard CRT (vulnerable 
patients) or radiotherapy alone (frail patients).

With only six recognised genera, the family Clinostomidae Lühe, 1901 remains a 
global research interest of parasitologists and ecologists. Recent efforts have 
focused on providing molecular data to investigate species diversity, elucidate 
life-cycles, and make inferences on the group's evolutionary history. Of the 
clinostomid genera, the monotypic Ithyoclinostomum Witenberg, 1926 has remained 
more enigmatic compared to the commonly encountered Clinostomum Leidy, 1856. 
Recent morphological and molecular evidence from metacercariae suggests a second 
Ithyoclinostomum species may exist in freshwater cichlids in Central America and 
Mexico. In a recent survey of great blue herons Ardea herodias L. from 
commercial catfish production farms in Mississippi, USA, two specimens of an 
abnormally large (> 20 mm) clinostomid were encountered in the oesophagus of a 
single bird. These specimens were identified as an Ithyoclinostomum sp. 
morphologically distinct from the only nominal species Ithyoclinostomum 
dimorphum (Diesing, 1850). Using morphological and molecular data these adult 
specimens were confirmed as conspecific with the larval metacercariae previously 
described from Central America and Mexico and represent the novel species, 
Ithyoclinostomum yamagutii n. sp.

BACKGROUND: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms 
(AAA) is associated with decreased perioperative morbidity and mortality.
OBJECTIVES: To report the outcomes of EVAR among patients older than 80 years of 
age.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed patients older than 80 years 
of age who underwent elective EVAR at our institution between 2007 and 2017. The 
demographics, perioperative morbidity and mortality, and long-term results are 
reported.
RESULTS: During the study period, 444 patients underwent elective EVAR for AAAs. 
Among them 128 patients (29%) were > 80 years of age. Mean age was 84 ± 3.4 
(range 80-96) years, and 110 patients (86%) were male. The EVAR was technically 
successful in 127 patients (99%) and there were intraoperative mortalities. 
Within 30 days of the surgery, nine patients (7%) died. Major and minor adverse 
events occurred in 26 (20%) and 59 (46%) patients, respectively. Factors 
associated with increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality included 
chronic kidney disease, peripheral artery disease, and the existence of three or 
more co-morbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: EVAR in the elderly can be performed with a high rate of success; 
however, it is associated with a substantial rate of morbidity and mortality, 
particularly when patients present with multiple co-morbidities. When performing 
EVAR in this population group, the risk of rupture must be considered opposed to 
the life expectancy of these patients and the risk of perioperative morbidity 
and mortality.

If Jeanne Calment Were 122, That Is All the More Reason for Biosampling.

This article discusses the need for biosampling as a way to test "super-duper" 
centenarians (persons aged >120 years) to identify biological pathways for Homo 
sapiens to live to their fullest biological lifespan potential (estimated by 
extreme value theory to be currently between 123 years and 128 years) and, by 
extension, the possibility of biosampling leading to the identification through 
scientific research testing and data analysis areas of potential life extension. 
Studies of twins have shown that the proportion of longevity attributed to 
heredity (genetic potential) versus environment increases substantially the 
higher the age group being tested, especially after age 75 years. Even among the 
oldest-old, the proportion attributed to biological factors continues increasing 
the higher the age category, which is a selective process as the genetically 
weaker of the remaining survivors continue to die off first, leaving a more and 
more highly selected remaining population. This self-selection process means 
that the very oldest individuals are already the "genetic lottery winners" who 
have the biological potential to come close to the maximum human lifespan. 
Testing of these persons may result in faster breakthroughs in the attempt to 
extend the human lifespan through biological testing and analysis. Indeed, it is 
possible that, just as some human lifespans are shortened due to random genetic 
mutations unique to the individual (such as persons with progeria), it is 
possible that there could be some humans whose maximum genetic potential was due 
in part to a genetic mutation unique to that particular individual. This remains 
an area of potential research that has not yet been thoroughly biotested-but one 
that could change soon, and biotesting a 122-year-old woman's biosamples would 
be a prime opportunity for such a test: Jeanne Calment. Because only one 
122-year-old woman has been validated in recorded scientific history, the 
uniqueness of the case makes it a unique opportunity that should not be passed 
by. Herewith, I take a closer look at the Jeanne Calment case and the conclusion 
is the same as the start: Jeanne Calment was 122 years, her age is relatively 
unique but not impossible to repeat in the future; however, her samples may be 
available right now, and thus remains the only current opportunity to study a 
>120-year-old person from a biological perspective.

Aim: To assess the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab monotherapy for 
recurrent/metastatic (R/M) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) 
in the US.Methods: We constructed a cohort-based partitioned survival model for 
three health states (progression-free, progressed disease, and death). Using 
overall survival and progression-free survival data from the nivolumab and 
investigator's choice (IC) arms of the CheckMate 141 study, the proportion of 
patients in each health state was estimated by parametric modeling over a 
25-year period. Cost, utility, adverse event, and disease management data inputs 
were obtained from relevant literature and applied to patients in each health 
state. A scenario analysis was conducted assuming increased uptake of subsequent 
immunotherapies. A one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis assessed the 
impact of variation in multiple parameters. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
in which probabilistic distributions were applied to each input during 1,000 
model iterations was also conducted.Results: Total costs incurred were higher 
with nivolumab ($101,552) than with IC ($38,067). Nivolumab was associated with 
a higher number of life-years (LY; 1.21) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 
0.89), compared with IC (0.68 and 0.42, respectively). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for nivolumab compared with IC was $134,438 per QALY, 
and this remained qualitatively similar when increased uptake of subsequent 
immunotherapies was assumed ($129,603 per QALY). Sensitivity analyses supported 
these findings.Conclusions: These results suggest that, at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $150,000 per QALY, nivolumab is a cost-effective option for therapy 
of SCCHN in the US.

The present study was carried out to unveil interactive relevance among 
consecutive and alternate members of a tritrophic system comprised of sugar beet 
genotypes, beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hübner), and its parasitoid, 
Habrobracon hebetor (Say) using demographic parameters. To do so, H. hebetor was 
reared on S. exigua fed on 10 sugar beet genotypes, including SB26; SB27; SB29; 
SB33; SB34; (7112*SB36)*Sh-1-HSF-5; FC220; FC301; SBSI006; and HM 1339RZ in a 
growth chamber at 25 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 5% RH, and 16:8 (L: D) h photoperiod. The data 
was analyzed based on the age-stage, two-sex life table theory. Our results 
revealed high variation in duration of different life stages of H. hebetor on S. 
exigua reared on different sugar beet genotypes examined. The shortest (10.605 
days) and longest (13.721 days) pre-adult period of H. hebetor was on S. exigua 
reared on SB26 and SB34, respectively. The longest (17.2 days) and shortest 
adult longevity (7.5 days) was on S. exigua reared on SB26 and SB27, 
respectively. The highest values of the intrinsic rate of increase (r) (0.209 
day-1) and finite rate of increase (λ) (1.233 day-1) were observed on S. exigua 
reared on SB34 and their lowest values (0.159 and 1.172 day-1, respectively) 
were recorded on SB27. Resistant and susceptible genotypes to S. exigua, FC301 
and (7112*SB36)*Sh-1-HSF-5, respectively, were only genotypes on which H. 
hebetor had greater and approximately equal r compared with S. exigua. This 
finding indicates high capability of H. hebetor to be successfully employed 
against S. exigua on sugar beet genotypes which are extremely different in 
resistance to this pest.

AIM: Schizophrenia is a serious health problem worldwide. This systematic 
analysis aims to quantify the burden of schizophrenia at the global, regional 
and national levels using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 (GBD 2017).
METHODS: We collected detailed information on the number of incidence cases, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and age-standardised incidence rate 
(ASIR) and age-standardised rate of DALYs (ASDR) during 1990-2017 from GBD 2017. 
The estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) in the ASIR and in the ASDR were 
calculated to quantify the temporal trends in the ASIR and ASDR of 
schizophrenia.
RESULTS: Globally there were 1.13 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] = 1.00 
to 1.28) incident schizophrenia cases and 12.66 million (95% UI = 9.48 to 15.56) 
DALYs due to schizophrenia in 2017. The global ASIR decreased slightly from 1990 
to 2017 (EAPC = -0.124, 95% UI = -0.114 to -0.135), while the ASDR was stable. 
The number of incident cases, DALYs, ASIR and ASDR were higher for males than 
for females. The incident rate and DALYs rate were highest among those aged 
20-29 and 30-54 years, respectively. ASIR and ASDR were highest in East Asia in 
2017, at 19.66 (95% UI = 17.72 to 22.00) and 205.23 (95% UI = 153.13 to 253.34), 
respectively. In 2017, the ASIR was highest in countries with a high-moderate 
sociodemographic index (SDI) and the ASDR was highest in high-SDI countries. We 
also found that the EAPC in ASDR was negatively correlated with the ASDR in 1990 
(P = 0.001, ρ = -0.23).
CONCLUSION: The global burden of schizophrenia remains large and continues to 
increase, thereby increasing the burden on health-care systems. The reported 
findings should be useful for resource allocation and health services planning 
for the increasing numbers of patients with schizophrenia in ageing societies.

Intragastric Fluid Filled Balloon for Weight Reduction - A Single Bariatric 
Center Study.

Filip G, Filip S, Dumbrava B.

Introduction: Obesity is a pandemic health problem which significantly reduces 
life expectancy because of its strong association with severe cardiologic, 
respiratory, dermatological, gastrointestinal, genito-urinary and psychiatric 
complications. Intragastric fluid filled balloon (IGB) is a minimally invasive 
option for weight reduction. Several studies have demonstrated its superiority 
to lifestyle changes in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with 
obesity. Long-term data is very limited, while the balloons are not anticipated 
to maintain weight beyond 1 year unless an efficient nutritional program is 
maintained. Aim: This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of intragastric 
fluid filled balloon in the weight reduction process for patients referred for 
weight cutback in a center of excellence in bariatric surgery. Methods: This is 
a retrospective, single institution study which included all the consecutive 
patients opting for gastric balloon therapy at Ponderas Academic Hospital, 
Bucharest between October 2017 and October 2019. Two surgeons certified in 
endoscopy performed the procedures of implantation and extraction. Results: 
Forty-four patients were included in this study, with a mean age of 36 years. 
There were 34 (77%) females and 10 (23%) males. The mean index BMI was 32.56 
kg/m2 and the mean BMI after 6 months (post extraction of the balloon) was 28.83 
kg/m2. Length of stay was 24 hours for 40 (91%) of patients and 48 hours for 4 
(9%) patients. Minor complications were registered in 8 (18%) cases and these 
were not followed by balloon extraction. Overall total weight loss (TWL) mean 
was 11.76%. Conclusions: Our data demonstrated a clear benefit of intragastric 
fluid-filled balloon on weight loss, after six month placement of the balloon. 
At the end of treatment, body weight, excess body weight and BMI were 
significantly lowered as compared with initial measurements. Successful weight 
loss was defined as 10% weight loss after 6 months with intragastric balloon in 
situ. Further research is needed in order to better define the long-term results 
after balloon extraction.

Lysine (K) 63-linked polyubiquitination plays important roles in cellular 
processes including DNA-damage tolerance (DDT), NF-κB signaling and endocytosis. 
Compared to yeast and mammals, little is known about K63-linked 
polyubiquitination in plants. To date, a Uev-Ubc13 complex is the only known 
Ub-conjugating enzyme to catalyze K63-linked polyubiquitination, in which Uev 
serves as a regulatory subunit. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains four 
UEV1 genes that can be classified into two subfamilies (UEV1A/B and UEV1C/D), in 
which Uev1A/B have a C-terminal extension. Database analysis reveals that all 
higher plant genomes contain both subfamily UEV1s, which were evolved as early 
as angiosperm plants. Interestingly, all C-terminal tails in the Uev1A/B 
subfamily contain a putative prenylation motif, CaaX. Combined experimental 
results using AtUev1B demonstrated that it is most likely farnesylated and that 
its C-terminal tail, particularly the catalytic Cys residue in the CaaX motif, 
plays critical roles in protein-protein interaction, nuclear exclusion and 
membrane association. Using AtUev1B as bait for a yeast-two-hybrid screen, we 
identified 14 interaction proteins in a prenylation-dependent manner. These 
results collectively imply that prenylation of AtUev1A/B plays a critical role 
in its functional differentiation from AtUev1C/D.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most frequent recessive inherited diseases in 
western countries. Advances in medical care have led to a substantial increase 
in the life expectancy of CF patients. Survival beyond adolescence has permitted 
to see fungi not only as late colonizers, but also as potential pathogens 
responsible of allergic reactions and chronic infections related to lung 
function deterioration. The role of fungi, nevertheless, has been overlooked 
until recently. As a result, a number of questions on their epidemiology, 
clinical significance, or diagnosis, among others, remain unanswered. Besides 
more in depth studies about the extent of the deleterious effect of fungi on the 
CF host, new technologies may provide the key to understand its pathogenic role, 
its interaction with other microbial components of the respiratory microbiota, 
and should pave the way to define subsets of patients at risk who would benefit 
from specific therapy. This review is intended to provide a quick overview on 
what we know about the presence of fungi in the CF airway and its repercussion 
in the host, and to point out some of the many knowledge gaps needed to 
understand and advance in the management of fungi in the airway of CF subjects.

OBJECTIVES: The number of critical care survivors is growing, but their 
long-term outcomes and resource use are poorly characterized. Estimating the 
cost-utility of critical care is necessary to ensure reasonable use of 
resources. The objective of this study was to analyze the long-term resource use 
and costs, and to estimate the cost-utility, of critical care.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: Seventeen ICUs providing critical care to 85% of the Finnish adult 
population.
PATIENTS: Adult patients admitted to any of 17 Finnish ICUs from September 2011 
to February 2012, enrolled in the Finnish Acute Kidney Injury (FINNAKI) study, 
and matched hospitalized controls from the same time period.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We primarily assessed total 3-year healthcare 
costs per quality-adjusted life-years at 3 years. We also estimated predicted 
life-time quality-adjusted life-years and described resource use and costs. The 
costing year was 2016. Of 2,869 patients, 1,839 (64.1%) survived the 3-year 
follow-up period. During the first year, 1,290 of 2,212 (58.3%) index episode 
survivors were rehospitalized. Median (interquartile range) 3-year cumulative 
costs per patient were $49,200 ($30,000-$85,700). ICU costs constituted 21.4% of 
the total costs during the 3-year follow-up. Compared with matched hospital 
controls, costs of the critically ill remained higher throughout the follow-up. 
Estimated total mean (95% CI) 3-year costs per 3-year quality-adjusted 
life-years were $46,000 ($44,700-$48,500) and per predicted life-time 
quality-adjusted life-years $8,460 ($8,060-8,870). Three-year costs per 3-year 
quality-adjusted life-years were $61,100 ($57,900-$64,400) for those with an 
estimated risk of in-hospital death exceeding 15% (based on the Simplified Acute 
Physiology Score II).
CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare resource use was substantial after critical care and 
remained higher compared with matched hospital controls. Estimated cost-utility 
of critical care in Finland was of high value.

BACKGROUND: We projected the clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and budget 
impact of ibalizumab plus an optimized background regimen (OBR) for people with 
multidrug-resistant (MDR) HIV in the United States.
METHODS: Using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications 
microsimulation model and a health care sector perspective, we compared 2 
treatment strategies for MDR HIV: (1) IBA + OBR-ibalizumab plus OBR and (2) 
OBR-OBR alone. Ibalizumab efficacy and cohort characteristics were from trial 
data: mean age 49 years, 85% male, and mean CD4 150/µL. Six-month viral 
suppression was 50% with IBA + OBR and 0% with OBR. The ibalizumab loading dose 
cost $10,500, and subsequent ibalizumab injections cost $8400/month; OBR cost 
$4500/month. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated using 
discounted (3%/year) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. ICERs 
≤$100,000/QALY were considered cost-effective. We performed sensitivity analysis 
on key parameters and examined budget impact.
RESULTS: In the base case, 5-year survival increased from 38% with OBR to 47% 
with IBA + OBR. Lifetime costs were $301,700/person with OBR and $661,800/person 
with IBA + OBR; the ICER for IBA + OBR compared with OBR was $260,900/QALY. IBA 
+ OBR was not cost-effective even with 100% efficacy. IBA + OBR became 
cost-effective at base case efficacy if ibalizumab cost was reduced by ≥88%. For 
an estimated 12,000 people with MDR HIV in the United States, IBA + OBR 
increased care costs by $1.8 billion (1.5% of total treatment budget) over 5 
years.
CONCLUSIONS: For people with MDR HIV lacking other treatment options, ibalizumab 
will substantially increase survival when effective. Although adding ibalizumab 
to OBR is not cost-effective, the low number of eligible patients in the United 
States makes the budget impact relatively small.

Introduction  The increase in life expectancy is an incentive to the development 
of researches with the elderly population aiming at actions that may ensure 
healthy and active aging. Objective  To analyze the profile of laryngeal 
microsurgery performed in patients > 60 years old. Methods  A retrospective 
observational study, with a cross-sectional design. A retrospective analysis of 
the medical records of elderly patients submitted to laryngeal microsurgery was 
performed at a private hospital in Curitiba, state of Paraná, Brazil, between 
January 2004 and December 2016. Were included all of the patients > 60 years old 
that underwent laryngeal microsurgery during this period. Results  During the 
studied period, 213 laryngeal microsurgeries were performed in 181 patients > 60 
years old. There was a preponderance of male patients. The mean age was 67.6 
years old. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was the most prevalent disorder (26%), 
followed by Reinke edema (20%), papillomatosis (14%), polyps (11%), leukoplakia 
(8%), minor structural alterations (8%), associated lesions (9%), and others 
(4%). Men presented a higher probability of SCC diagnosis, regardless of the age 
group, while Reinke edema was more frequently observed in women. A directly 
proportional relation between the frequency of laryngeal cancer and age increase 
was also observed. No significant differences were observed in professional 
voice users. Conclusion  Further researches are required to properly comprehend 
the factors associated with laryngeal lesions and determine prevention and 
treatment approaches.

OBJECTIVE: To research the clinical characteristics and risk factors of lung 
cancer-associated acute ischemic stroke (LCA-AIS).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with LCA-AIS, simple lung cancer, and simple AIS 
were enrolled. The primary information, laboratory results, tumor 
histopathology, neurological deficits, and survival time of the patients were 
collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: (1) In the LCA-AIS group, the pathology of 69.56% patients were 
adenocarcinoma, and the proportion of poorly differentiated patients was 
significantly more than that in moderately differentiated or highly 
differentiated. The number of stage IV lung cancer patients in the LCA-AIS group 
was significantly more common than in other stages. (2) 56.52% of patients with 
lung cancer were diagnosed before AIS, and the peak of AIS attack was 1-6 months 
after the diagnosis of lung cancer. (3) The independent risk factors of LCA-AIS 
were CYFRA-211 (OR 1.070; 95% confidence interval 1.005, 1.139; p = 0.035), TT 
(OR 1.275; 95% confidence interval 1.089, 1.493; p = 0.003), and Hct (OR 0.878; 
95% confidence interval 0.779, 0.990; p = 0.034), making ROC curve, suggesting 
the area under the curve is 0.871. (4) The neurological deficit of patients in 
the LCA-AIS group was similar to the simple AIS group and could not be 
identified by the severity of neurological deficits. (5) The median survival 
time of LCA-AIS group patients was five months (95% confidence interval 3.796, 
6.204). There were statistical differences in survival time between LCA-AIS 
group and simple AIS group patients (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The interaction between lung cancer and AIS may shorten patients' 
life expectancy and worsen their quality of life.

AIMS/INTRODUCTION: The present study estimated the cost-effectiveness of 
bariatric surgery versus medication therapy for the management of recently 
diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in obese patients from a Chinese 
health insurance payer perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was established to compare the 40-year 
time costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between bariatric surgery and 
medication therapy. The health-care costs in the bariatric surgery group, 
proportion of patients in each group with remission of diabetes, and state 
transition probabilities were calculated based on observed resource utilization 
from the hospital information system (HIS). The corresponding costs in the 
medication therapy group were derived from the medical insurance database. QALYs 
were estimated from previous literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted 5% 
annually.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, bariatric surgery was more effective and 
less costly than medication therapy. Over a 40-year time horizon, the mean 
discounted costs were 86,366.55 RMB per surgical therapy patient and 113,235.94 
CNY per medication therapy patient. The surgical and medication therapy patients 
lived 13.46 and 10.95 discounted QALYs, respectively. Bariatric surgery was 
associated with a mean health-care savings of 26,869.39 CNY and 2.51 additional 
QALYs per patient compared to medication therapy. Uncertainty around the 
parameter values was tested comprehensively in sensitivity analyses, and the 
results were robust.
CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery is a dominant intervention over a 40-year time 
horizon, which leads to significant cost savings to the health insurance payer 
and increases in health benefits for the management of recently diagnosed T2DM 
in obese patients in China.

A Review of the Literature on Native Hawaiian End-of-Life Care: Implications for 
Research and Practice.

The need for cultural understanding is particularly important in end-of-life 
(EOL) care planning as the use of EOL care in minority populations is 
disproportionately lower than those who identify as Caucasian. Data regarding 
the use of EOL care services by Native Hawaiians in Hawai'i and the United 
States is limited but expected to be similarly disproportionate as other 
minorities. In a population with a lower life expectancy and higher prevalence 
of deaths related to chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
and obesity, as compared to the state of Hawai'i as a whole, our objective was 
to review the current literature to understand the usage and perceptions of EOL 
care planning in the Native Hawaiian population. We searched ten electronic 
databases and after additional screening, seven articles were relevant to our 
research purpose. We concluded that limited data exists regarding EOL care use 
specifically in Native Hawaiians. The available literature highlighted the 
importance of understanding family and religion influences, educating staff on 
culturally appropriate EOL care communication, and the need for more research on 
the topic. The paucity of data in EOL care and decision-making in Native 
Hawaiians is concerning and it is evident this topic needs more study. From 
national statistics it looks as though this is another health disparate area 
that needs to be addressed and is especially relevant when considering the rapid 
increase in seniors in our population.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal 
excision (TME) is the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. 
There is interest in deescalating local therapy after a clinical complete 
response to CRT. We hypothesized that a watch-and-wait (WW) strategy offers 
comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and 
reduced cost compared with upfront TME.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to compare WW, low anterior 
resection, and abdominoperineal resection for patients achieving a clinical 
complete response to CRT. Rates of local regrowth, pelvic recurrence, and 
distant metastasis were derived from series comparing WW with TME after 
pathologic complete response. Lifetime incremental costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALY) were calculated between strategies, and sensitivity analyses 
were performed to study model uncertainty.
RESULTS: The base case 5-year cancer-specific survival was 93.5% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 91.5% to 94.9%) on a WW program compared with 95.9% (95% CI = 
93.6% to 97.4%) after upfront TME. WW was dominant relative to low anterior 
resection, with cost savings of $28 500 (95% CI = $22 200 to $39 000) and 
incremental QALY of 0.527 (95% CI = 0.138 to 1.125). WW was also dominant 
relative to abdominoperineal resection, with a cost savings of $32 100 (95% CI = 
$21 800 to $49 200) and incremental QALY of 0.601 (95% CI = 0.213 to 1.208). WW 
remained dominant in sensitivity analysis unless the rate of surgical salvage 
fell to 73.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: Using current multi-institutional recurrence estimates, we observed 
comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and 
decreased costs with WW compared with upfront TME. Upfront TME was preferred 
when surgical salvage rates were low.

Background: Lack of awareness about the life-limiting nature of renal failure is 
a significant barrier to palliative care for older adults with end-stage renal 
disease. Objective: To train nephrologists to use the best case/worst case 
(BC/WC) communication tool to improve shared decision making about dialysis 
initiation for older patients with limited life expectancy. Design: This is a 
pre-/postinterventional pilot study. Setting/Subjects: There were 16 
nephrologists and 30 patients of age 70 years and older with estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <20 mL/min per 1.73 m2 in outpatient 
nephrology clinics, in Madison, WI. Measurements: Performance of tool elements, 
content of communication about dialysis, shared decision making, acceptability 
of the intervention, decisions to pursue dialysis, and palliative care referrals 
were measured. Results: Fifteen of 16 nephrologists achieved competence 
performing the BC/WC tool with standardized patients, executing at least 14 of 
19 items. Nine nephrologists met with 30 patients who consented to audio record 
their clinic visit. Before training, clinic visits focused on laboratory results 
and preparation for dialysis. After training, nephrologists noted that declining 
kidney function was "bad news," presented dialysis and "no dialysis" as 
treatment options, and elicited patient preferences. Observer-measured shared 
decision-making (OPTION 5) scores improved from a median of 20/100 
(interquartile range [IQR] 15-35) before training to 58/100 (IQR 55-65). 
Patients whose nephrologist used the BC/WC tool were less likely to make a 
decision to initiate dialysis and were more likely to be referred to palliative 
care. Conclusions: Nephrologists can learn to use the BC/WC tool with older 
patients to improve shared decision making about dialysis, which may increase 
access to palliative care.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) is increasing. 
Effective biomedical prevention methods (treatment as prevention and preexposure 
prophylaxis) are being widely implemented in high-income nations. Therefore, 
research into quality of life, including sexual adjustment, is of increasing 
importance to HIV care. Yet, sexual adjustment of PLWH has been neglected in 
past research. We propose a new model of sexual adjustment to HIV which explores 
the dynamic process, facilitators and barriers characterising sexual life of 
PLWH overtime.
METHOD: Thirty PLWH (19 male, 11 female) recruited from two HIV treatment
