The management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) during pregnancy 
has become recently a matter of continuous debate. The introduction of the 
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) in clinical practice has dramatically changed 
the prognosis of CML patients; in fact, patients diagnosed in chronic phase can 
reasonably expect many years of excellent disease control and good quality of 
life, as well as a normal life expectancy, including the necessity to address 
issues relating to fertility and pregnancy. Physicians are frequently being 
asked for advice regarding the need for, and/or the appropriateness of, stopping 
treatment in order to conceive. In this report, we will review the data 
published in terms of fertility, conception, pregnancy, pregnancy outcome and 
illness control for TKI treated CML patients, as well as how to manage a planned 
and/or unplanned pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic heart failure (HF) experience a marked 
reduction in their exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and life 
expectancy. Despite substantive evidence supporting exercise training in HF, 
uncertainties remain in the interpretation and understanding of this evidence 
base. Clinicians and healthcare providers seek definitive estimates of impact on 
mortality, hospitalisation and health-related quality of life, and which HF 
patient subgroups are likely to most benefit. The original Exercise Training 
Meta-Analysis for Chronic Heart Failure (ExTraMATCH) individual participant data 
(IPD) meta-analysis conducted in 2004 will be updated by the current 
collaboration (ExTraMATCH II), to investigate the effects of exercise training 
in HF.
METHODS: Randomised controlled trials have been identified from the updated 2014 
Cochrane systematic review and the original ExTraMATCH IPD meta-analysis with 
exercise training of 3 weeks' duration or more compared with a non-exercise 
control and a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Particular outcomes of interest are 
mortality, hospitalisation and health-related quality of life plus key baseline 
patient demographic and clinical data. Original IPD will be requested from the 
authors of all eligible trials; we will check original data and compile a master 
dataset. IPD meta-analyses will be conducted using a one-step approach where the 
IPD from all studies are modelled simultaneously whilst accounting for the 
clustering of participants with studies.
DISCUSSION: The information from ExTraMATCH II will help inform future national 
and international clinical and policy decision-making on the use of 
exercise-based interventions in HF and improve the quality, design and reporting 
of future trials in this field.

When longevity meets vitality.

2333 AA Leiden,The Netherlands.

Alarmed by the sustainability of our health and social security systems, 
longevity has become a great societal challenge. In line with evolutionary logic 
we see a continuous increase of average life expectancy and maximal lifespan. 
Striving for a healthy old age, however, is an infelicitous expression as for 
human subjects the ageing process cannot be ultimately postponed. Not 
disregarding the huge variation in health trajectories, in old age we will all 
suffer from frailty and infirmity. As yet efforts of the biomedical arena are 
almost exclusively focused on stalling the ageing process and preventing 
dysfunction. Too little effort is spend on how to inspire and coach the great 
majority of people who still feel relatively well notwithstanding the presence 
of multiple age-related disorders. There is a strong rationale to separate the 
quest to live in good health for longer from actively and effectively 
negotiating the challenge of functional decline in old age. In particular, we 
emphasise a focus on adjusting the environment in order to correct the 
gene-environment mismatch that contributes to ill health. An additional strategy 
is to empower people to set ambitions and to realise appropriate goals, in spite 
of infirmity. Striving for vitality presents a striking opportunity to achieve 
subjective feelings of life satisfaction when ageing.

Biomechanical study of upper-limb exoskeleton for resistance training with 
three-dimensional motion analysis system.

(1)Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 
Taiwan (Republic of China).

The world's population is aging rapidly, particularly in developed countries. 
The trend toward prolonged life expectancy will increase the elderly population 
and thereby lead to an increase in occurrences of age-related health problems 
such as chronic disease. Healthcare services and home-based rehabilitation are 
in high demand, and the demand for professional physical therapy is imposing an 
increasing burden on the healthcare system. Rehabilitation training devices must 
keep pace with standards of care, be cost effective, and meet the home-based 
training requirements of today's rehabilitation trends. This article presents an 
experimental study of a novel spring-loaded upper-limb exoskeleton meant to 
enable a patient or nondisabled individual to move a limb at multiple joints in 
different planes for resistance training in a free and unconstrained 
environment. To assess the functionality of the design, we have measured its 
kinematic data while performing designated movements and adopted a 
motion-capture system to verify the function of our mechanism. The collected 
data and analysis of the kinematic and dynamic joint torques may not only verify 
our mechanism but also provide a profound understanding of the design 
requirements for an appropriate spring-loaded exoskeleton for upper-limb 
resistance training.

BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common among young 
athletes. Biomechanical studies have led to the development of training programs 
to improve neuromuscular control and reduce ACL injury rates as well as 
screening tools to identify athletes at higher risk for ACL injury. The purpose 
of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these training methods 
and screening strategies for preventing ACL injuries.
METHODS: A decision-analysis model was created to evaluate three strategies for 
a population of young athletes participating in organized sports: (1) no 
training or screening, (2) universal neuromuscular training, and (3) universal 
screening, with neuromuscular training for identified high-risk athletes only. 
Risk of injury, risk reduction from training, and sensitivity and specificity of 
screening were based on published data from clinical trials. Costs of training 
and screening programs were estimated on the basis of the literature. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed on key model parameters to evaluate their 
effect on base case conclusions.
RESULTS: Universal neuromuscular training of all athletes was the dominant 
strategy, with better outcomes and lower costs compared with screening. On 
average, the implementation of a universal training program would save $100 per 
player per season, and would reduce the incidence of ACL injury from 3% to 1.1% 
per season. Screening was not cost-effective within the range of reported 
sensitivity and specificity values.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Given its low cost and ease of 
implementation, neuromuscular training of all young athletes represents a 
cost-effective strategy for reducing costs and morbidity from ACL injuries. 
While continued innovations on inexpensive and accurate screening methods to 
identify high-risk athletes remain of interest, improving existing training 
protocols and implementing neuromuscular training into routine training for all 
young athletes is warranted.

IMPORTANCE: Research prioritization should be guided by impact of disease.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether systematic reviews and protocol topics in 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) reflect disease burden, measured 
by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) 2010 project.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two investigators independently assessed 15 
skin conditions in the CDSR for systematic review and protocol representation 
from November 1, 2013, to December 6, 2013. The 15 skin diseases were matched to 
their respective DALYs from GBD 2010. An official publication report of all 
reviews and protocols published by the Cochrane Skin Group (CSG) was also 
obtained to ensure that no titles were missed. There were no study participants 
other than the researchers, who worked with databases evaluating CDSR and GBD 
2010 skin condition disability data.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Relationship of CDSR topic coverage (systematic 
reviews and protocols) with percentage of total 2010 DALYs, 2010 DALY rank, and 
DALY percentage change from 1990 to 2010 for 15 skin conditions.
RESULTS: All 15 skin conditions were represented by at least 1 systematic review 
in CDSR; 69% of systematic reviews and 67% of protocols by the CSG covered the 
15 skin conditions. Comparing the number of reviews/protocols and disability, 
dermatitis, melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, viral skin diseases, and fungal 
skin diseases were well matched. Decubitus ulcer, psoriasis, and leprosy 
demonstrated review/protocol overrepresentation when matched with corresponding 
DALYs. In comparison, acne vulgaris, bacterial skin diseases, urticaria, 
pruritus, scabies, cellulitis, and alopecia areata were underrepresented in CDSR 
when matched with corresponding DALYs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Degree of representation in CDSR is partly correlated 
with DALY metrics. The number of published reviews/protocols was well matched 
with disability metrics for 5 of the 15 studied skin diseases, while 3 skin 
diseases were overrepresented, and 7 were underrepresented. Our results provide 
high-quality and transparent data to inform future prioritization decisions.

A degenerated strain of Pleurotus eryngii KNR2312 was isolated from a commercial 
farm. Random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis performed on the genomic DNA of 
the normal and degenerated strains of this species revealed differences in the 
DNA banding pattern. A unique DNA fragment (1.7 kbp), which appeared only in the 
degenerated strain, was isolated and sequenced. Comparing this sequence with the 
KNR2312 genomic sequence showed that the sequence of the degenerated strain 
comprised three DNA regions that originated from nine distinct scaffolds of the 
genomic sequence, suggesting that chromosome-level changes had occurred in the 
degenerated strain. Using the unique sequence, three sets of PCR primers were 
designed that targeted the full length, the 5' half, and the 3' half of the DNA. 
The primer sets P2-1 and P2-2 yielded 1.76 and 0.97 kbp PCR products, 
respectively, only in the case of the degenerated strain, whereas P2-3 generated 
a 0.8 kbp product in both the normal and the degenerated strains because its 
target region was intact in the normal strain as well. In the case of the P2-1 
and P2-2 sets, the priming regions of the forward and reverse primers were 
located at distinct genomic scaffolds in the normal strain. These two primer 
sets specifically detected the degenerate strain of KNR2312 isolated from 
various mushrooms including 10 different strains of P. eryngii, four strains of 
P. ostreatus, and 11 other wild mushrooms.

[The receptorial responsiveness method (RRM): a new possibility to estimate the 
concentration of pharmacologic agonists at their receptors].

[Article in Hungarian]

Pák K, Kiss Z, Erdei T, Képes Z, Gesztelyi R.

Cardiovascular disease is the biggest challenge in terms of life expectancy in 
developed countries. Adenosine contributes to the adaptation of the heart to 
ischemia and hypoxia, because adenosine, in addition to its metabolite role in 
the nucleic acid metabolism, is the endogenous agonist of the ubiquitous 
adenosine receptor family. Adenosine receptor activation is beneficial in most 
cases, it improves the balance between energy supply and consumption, reduces 
injury caused by stressors and inhibits the unfavorable tissue remodeling. 
Pharmacological manipulation of cardioprotective effects evoked by adenosine is 
an important, although to date not sufficiently utilized endeavor that may have 
therapeutic and preventive implications in cardiovascular diseases. As the 
ligand binding site of adenosine receptors is accessible from the extracellular 
space, it is especially important to know the adenosine concentration of the 
interstitial fluid ([Ado](ISF)). However, in the functioning heart, [Ado](ISF) 
values range in an extremely wide interval, spanning from nano- to micromolar 
concentrations, as estimated by the commonly used methods. Our recently 
developed procedure, the receptorial responsiveness method (RRM), may resolve 
this problem in certain cases. RRM enables quantification of an acute increase 
in the concentration of a pharmacological agonist, uniquely in the 
microenvironment of the receptors of the given agonist. As a limitation, 
concentration of agonists with short half-life (just like adenosine) at their 
receptors can only be quantified with the equieffective concentration of a 
stable agonist exerting the same action. In a previous study using RRM, 
inhibition of the transmembrane nucleoside transport in the euthyroid guinea pig 
atrium produced an increase in [Ado](ISF) that was equieffective with 18.8 +/- 3 
nM CPA (N6-cyclopentyladenosine, a stable, selective A1 adenosine receptor 
agonist). This finding is consistent with observations of others, i.e., in the 
normoxic heart, adenosine flow is directed into the cell interior, and thus 
transport blockade elevates the extracellular adenosine level. In turn, 
nucleoside transport inhibition in the hyperthyroid guinea pig atrium caused a 
rise in [Ado](ISF) equieffective with 46.5 +/- 13.7 nM CPA. In sum, our work 
team was the first to demonstrate that adenosine transport in the hyperthyroid 
atrium has the same direction but is more intense as/than that in the euthyroid 
one.

The Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study is the largest study of its kind. It 
provides a large volume of information about the global burden of disease and 
associated risk factors. It estimates that lower respiratory infections, 
diabetes, diarrhea, and tuberculosis cause the greatest burden in the Pacific, 
and noncommunicable diseases caused a substantially greater burden in 2010 
compared with 1990. Although the Pacific is considered to be a region rich in 
data, very little of these data has been analyzed, synthesized, and made 
publically available. Consequently, burden estimates for the Pacific are derived 
from models built with very limited data, and it is difficult to know how 
accurate they are. Health information in the Pacific needs strengthening, 
particularly in relation to data collection, analysis, use, and sharing. This 
will improve the reliability and comparability of burden of disease estimates.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadly adult brain tumor. Despite 
aggressive surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, the life expectancy of patients 
diagnosed with GBM is ∼14 months. The extremely aggressive nature of GBM results 
from glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) that sustain GBM growth, survive 
intensive chemotherapy, and give rise to tumor recurrence. There is accumulating 
evidence revealing that GSC resilience is because of concomitant activation of 
multiple survival pathways. In order to decode the signal transduction networks 
responsible for the malignant properties of GSCs, we analyzed a collection of 
GSC lines using a dual, but complementary, experimental approach, that is, 
reverse-phase protein microarrays (RPPMs) and kinase inhibitor library 
screening. We treated GSCs in vitro with clinically relevant concentrations of 
temozolomide (TMZ) and performed RPPM to detect changes in phosphorylation 
patterns that could be associated with resistance. In addition, we screened GSCs 
in vitro with a library of protein and lipid kinase inhibitors to identify 
specific targets involved in GSC survival and proliferation. We show that GSCs 
are relatively insensitive to TMZ treatment in terms of pathway activation and, 
although displaying heterogeneous individual phospho-proteomic profiles, most 
GSCs are resistant to specific inhibition of the major signaling pathways 
involved in cell survival and proliferation. However, simultaneous multipathway 
inhibition by the staurosporin derivative UCN-01 results in remarkable 
inhibition of GSC growth in vitro. The activity of UCN-01 on GSCs was confirmed 
in two in vivo models of GBM growth. Finally, we used RPPM to study the 
molecular and functional effects of UCN-01 and demonstrated that the sensitivity 
to UCN-01 correlates with activation of survival signals mediated by PDK1 and 
the DNA damage response initiated by CHK1. Taken together, our results suggest 
that a combined inhibition of PDK1 and CHK1 represents a potentially effective 
therapeutic approach to reduce the growth of human GBM.

BACKGROUND: Patients with psychiatric illness have increased somatic morbidity 
and increased mortality. Knowledge of how to integrate the prevention and care 
of somatic illness into the treatment of psychiatric patients is required. The 
aims of this study were to investigate whether an intervention programme to 
improve physical health is effective.
METHODS: An extension of the European Network for Promoting the Health of 
Residents in Psychiatric and Social Care Institutions (HELPS) project further 
developed as a 12-month controlled cluster-randomized intervention study in the 
Danish centre. Waist circumference was a proxy of unhealthy body fat in view of 
the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes.
RESULTS: Waist circumference was 108 cm for men and 108 cm for women. Controlled 
for cluster randomization, sex, age, and body fat, the intervention group showed 
a small, but not significant, reduction in waist circumference, while 
participants in the control group showed a significant increase in waist 
circumference.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention had a positive effect on the physical health of 
the patients measured by a reduction in the increase of waist circumference.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study is the analysis of years of life lost due to 
external causes of death, particularly due to traffic accidents and suicides.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study material includes a database containing 
information gathered from 376,281 death certificates of inhabitants of the Lodz 
province who died between 1999 and 2010. The Lodz province is characterized by 
the highest mortality rates in Poland. The SEYLLp (Standard Expected Years of 
Life Lost per living person) and the SEYLLd (per death) indices were used to 
determine years of life lost. Joinpoint models were used to analyze time trends.
RESULTS: In 2010, deaths due to external causes constituted 6.0% of the total 
number of deaths. The standardized death rate (SDR) due to external causes was 
110.0 per 100,000 males and was five times higher than for females (22.0 per 
100,000 females). In 2010, the SEYLLp due to external causes was 3746 per 
100,000 males and 721 per 100,000 females. Among males, suicides and traffic 
accidents were the most common causes of death (the values of the SEYLLp were: 
1098 years and 887 years per 100,000 people, respectively). Among females, the 
SEYLLp values were 183 years due to traffic accidents and 143 years due to 
suicides (per 100,000 people).
CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in the number of years of life lost due to external 
causes is much higher among females. The authors observe that a growing number 
of suicides contribute to an increase in the value of the SEYLLp index. This 
directly contributes to over-mortality of males due to external causes. The 
analysis of the years of life lost focuses on the social and economic aspects of 
premature mortality due to external causes.

BACKGROUND: Tunneled central venous catheters (tCVCs) are considered inferior to 
arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts in all nephrology guidelines. However, 
they are being increasingly used as hemodialysis vascular access. The purpose of 
this study was to document the natural history of tCVCs and determine the rate 
and type of catheter replacement.
METHODS: This was a prospective study of 141 patients who underwent hemodialysis 
with tCVCs between January 2008 and December 2012. The patients used 154 tCVCs. 
Standard protocols about management of tCVCs, according to European Renal Best 
Practice, were well established. All catheters were inserted in the internal 
jugular vein. Criteria for catheter removal were persistent bloodstream 
infection, detection of an outbreak of catheter-related bloodstream (CRBS) 
infections, or catheter dysfunction. Event rates were calculated per 1,000 
catheter days; tCVC cumulative survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: Catheter replacement occurred in 15 patients (0.29 per 1,000 days); 
catheter dysfunction was the main cause of replacement (0.18 per 1,000 days), 
typically within 12 months of surgical insertion. A total of 53 CRBS events in 
36 patients were identified (0.82 per 1,000 days); 17 organisms, most commonly 
Gram-positive pathogens, were isolated; 87% of CVC infections were treated by 
systemic antibiotics associated with lock therapy. tCVC cumulative survival was 
91% at 1 year, 88% at 2 years and 85% at 4 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a high survival rate of tCVCs in hemodialysis 
patients, with low incidence of catheter dysfunction and CRBS events. These data 
justify tCVC use for hemodialysis vascular access, also as first choice, 
especially in patients with exhausted peripheral access and limited life 
expectancy.

limb prosthetic joints.

The average age of patients presenting for total joint arthroplasty is 
decreasing. The number of primary and revision arthroplasty procedures performed 
in the UK, Europe and USA is increasing annually. As number of procedures 
performed increases, the life expectancy of our patients and therefore the in 
vivo duration of prosthetic joints increase, and the potential for complications 
such as infection increases. One potential source for this is bacterial 
dissemination during dental surgery. Many attempts have been made to address 
this issue in the form of national guidelines, but there is no clear consensus 
on antibiotic prophylaxis before these procedures in order to decrease the risk 
of prosthetic joint infection. This continues to be an area of indecision and 
uncertainty resulting in patients having delays in their treatment while 
decisions are made by oral and orthopaedic surgeons about prophylactic 
antibiotic use. This article reviews the existing national guidelines, 
highlighting the current views and issues surrounding this subject, and a 
critical appraisal of current evidence for the use of prophylactic antibiotics 
in this patient population is presented. We will also review the response in 
literature to the 2009 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons information 
statement release on antibiotic prophylaxis in joint arthroplasty patients 
undergoing dental procedures.

BACKGROUND: To estimate patency of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts 
(AVGs) for dialysis access.
METHODS: Records of all adult patients who had a dialysis access placed from 
January 2008 to June 2011 were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: A total of 494 patients with 655 accesses (390 AVFs, 265 AVGs) were 
examined. We found that AVG fared worse in assisted primary patency. But AVG had 
superior secondary patency up to 1.2 years (hazard ratio [HR] .6, confidence 
interval [CI]: [.4 to .8]) and was no different than AVF after 1.2 years. (HR 
1.6, CI: [.9 to 3.1]). On univariate analysis, dialysis catheters negatively 
impacted assisted primary patency (HR 1.4, CI: [1.09 to 1.77]).
CONCLUSIONS: AVG can be maintained with higher rates of secondary patency in the 
short term and are no different in the long term. This result suggests that in 
patients with limited life expectancy an AVG may be an effective alternative to 
an AVF to reduce both catheter time and associated complications.

Due to the increase in average life expectancy and the higher incidence of 
cardiovascular disease with advancing age, more elderly patients present for 
cardiac surgery nowadays. Advances in pre- and postoperative care have led to 
the possibility that an increasing number of elderly patients can be operated on 
safely and with a satisfactory outcome. Currently, coronary artery bypass 
surgery, aortic and mitral valve surgery, and major surgery of the aorta are 
performed in elderly patients. The data available show that most cardiac 
surgical procedures can be performed in elderly patients with a satisfactory 
outcome. Nevertheless, the risk for these patients is only acceptable in the 
absence of comorbidities. In particular, renal dysfunction, cerebrovascular 
disease, and poor clinical state are associated with a worse outcome in elderly 
patients. Careful patient selection, flawless surgery, meticulous hemostasis, 
perfect anesthesia, and adequate myocardial protection are basic requirements 
for the success of cardiac surgery in elderly patients. The care of elderly 
cardiac surgical patients can be improved only through the strict collaboration 
of geriatricians, anesthesiologists, cardiologists, and cardiac surgeons, in 
order to obtain a tailored treatment for each individual patient.

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in 
the United States and other developed countries, and is fast growing in 
developing countries, particularly as life expectancy in all parts of the world 
increases. Current recommendations for the prevention of cardiovascular disease 
issued jointly from the American Academy of Cardiology and American Heart 
Association emphasize that lifestyle modification should be incorporated into 
any treatment plan, including those on statin drugs. However, there is a dearth 
of data on the interaction between diet and statins with respect to additive, 
complementary or antagonistic effects. This review collates the available data 
on the interaction of statins and dietary patterns, cognition, genetics and 
individual nutrients, including vitamin D, niacin, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, 
phytochemicals (polyphenols and stanols) and alcohol. Of note, although the 
available data is summarized, the scope is limited, conflicting and disparate. 
In some cases it is likely there is unrecognized synergism. Virtually no data 
are available describing the interactions of statins with dietary components or 
dietary pattern in subgroups of the population, particularly those who may 
benefit most were positive effects identified. Hence, it is virtually impossible 
to draw any firm conclusions at this time. Nevertheless, this area is important 
because were the effects of statins and diet additive or synergistic harnessing 
the effect could potentially lead to the use of a lower intensity statin or 
dose.

Withdrawal of immunosuppression following pediatric liver transplantation: a 
Markov analysis.

OBJECTIVES: Survivors of pediatric liver transplantation are at risk for 
developing complications related to posttransplant immunosuppressive 
medications. Withdrawal is possible in selected patients but carries the risk of 
graft rejection and loss. We modeled the effect of withdrawing immunosuppressive 
medications on survival, cost, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in a 
hypothetical cohort of pediatric patients who received transplantation for 
biliary atresia with stable liver enzymes and no recent episodes of rejection, 
and who were free from immunosuppression-related adverse effects.
METHODS: A decision analysis tree was developed, and Monte Carlo simulations 
were used to track patients through the model during a 10-year time course with 
1-year cycles. Data from the literature were used to assign probabilities to 
major clinical events and preference-based utility scores to the values of 
health outcomes. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to 
evaluate the impact of uncertainty.
RESULTS: Patients following the withdrawal strategy had a 10-year survival rate 
of 95.8% and experienced 8.61 QALYs versus 88.6% survival and 8.01 QALYs for 
those taking immunosuppressive medications. Each additional QALY is attained at 
a cost of -$18,992.41 and was therefore cost saving.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients in our model who had their immunosuppression withdrawn had 
improved survival and QALYs with lower costs. Although every effort was made to 
validate the model, it is limited by the accuracy of the underlying assumptions. 
Therefore, clinical trials are needed to determine predictors of successful 
immunosuppression withdrawal to allow for personalization of medication 
regimens.

BACKGROUND: Excessive use of alcohol is associated with poor sexual health, but 
the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of brief alcohol intervention 
in this setting has not been investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects and cost-effectiveness of brief intervention 
for excessive alcohol consumption among people who attend sexual health clinics.
DESIGN: A two-arm, parallel-group, single-blind, pragmatic, randomised 
controlled trial. Participants were randomised via an independent and remote 
telephone randomisation service using permuted blocks, stratified by clinic.
SETTING: Study participants were recruited from three sexual health clinics in 
central and west London.
PARTICIPANTS: For inclusion, potential participants had to be aged ≥ 19 years, 
drink excessive alcohol according to the Modified-Single Alcohol Screening 
Question, and be willing to provide written informed consent. We excluded those 
who were unable to communicate in English sufficiently well to complete the 
baseline assessment and those who could not provide contact details for the 
follow-up assessment.
INTERVENTIONS: Brief advice was delivered by the treating clinician and 
comprised feedback on the possible health consequences of excessive drinking, a 
discussion of whether the participant's clinic attendance was linked to current 
alcohol use, written information on alcohol and health and an offer of an 
appointment with an alcohol health worker (AHW). Appointments with AHWs took 
place either in person or by telephone, lasted up to 30 minutes, and used the 
'FRAMES' (Feedback about the adverse effects of alcohol, an emphasis on personal 
Responsibility for changing drinking behaviour, Advice about alcohol 
consumption, a Menu of options for further help and advice, an Empathic stance 
towards the patient and an emphasis on Self-efficacy) approach. Those in the 
control arm of the trial were offered a copy of a leaflet providing general 
information on health and lifestyle.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were assessed 6 months after randomisation. The 
primary outcome was mean weekly alcohol consumption during the previous 90 days. 
The main secondary outcome was unprotected sex during this period.
RESULTS: Eight hundred and two people were recruited to the study of whom 592 
(74%) were followed up 6 months later. Among 402 participants who were 
randomised to brief intervention, 397 (99%) received brief advice from the 
treating clinician and 81 (20%) also received input from an AHW. The adjusted 
mean difference in alcohol consumption after 6 months was -2.33 units per week 
[95% confidence interval (CI) -4.69 to 0.03 units per week, p = 0.053] for those 
in the active arm compared with the control arm. Unprotected sex was reported by 
154 (53%) of those who received brief intervention and by 178 (59%) of controls 
(adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.25, p = 0.496). Participants 
randomised to brief intervention reported drinking a mean of 10.4 units of 
alcohol per drinking day compared with 9.3 units among control participants 
(difference 1.10, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.96, p = 0.009). We found no statistically 
significant differences in other outcomes. Brief intervention (brief advice and 
input from an AHW) cost on average £12.60 per person to deliver and did not 
appear to provide a cost-effective use of resources.
CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of universal screening and brief intervention for 
excessive alcohol use among people who attend sexual health clinics does not 
result in clinically important reductions in alcohol consumption or provide a 
cost-effective use of resources. While people attending sexual health clinics 
may want to achieve better sexual health, attempts to reduce alcohol consumption 
may not be seen by them as a necessary means of trying to achieve this aim.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as ISRCTN 99963322.

programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol.

BACKGROUND: A substantial minority of adolescents suffer from depression and it 
is associated with increased risk of suicide, social and educational impairment, 
and mental health problems in adulthood. A recently conducted randomized 
controlled trial in England evaluated the effectiveness of a manualized 
universally delivered age-appropriate CBT programme in school classrooms. The 
cost-effectiveness of the programme for preventing low mood and depression for 
all participants from a health and social care sector perspective needs to be 
determined.
METHODS: A trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis based on a cluster-randomized 
controlled trial (trial registration--ISRCTN 19083628) comparing classroom-based 
CBT with usual school provision of Personal Social and Health Education. 
Per-student cost of intervention was estimated from programme records. The study 
was undertaken in eight mixed-sex U.K. secondary schools, and included 3,357 
school children aged 12 to 16 years (in the two trial arms evaluated in the 
cost-effectiveness analysis). The main outcome measures were individual 
self-reported data on care costs, Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs, based on 
the EQ-5D health-related quality-of-life instrument) and symptoms of depression 
(Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire) at baseline, 6 and 12 months.
RESULTS: Although there was lower quality-adjusted life-years over 12 months 
(-.05 QALYs per person, 95% confidence interval -.09 to -.005, p = .03) with 
CBT, this is a 'clinically' negligible difference, which was not found in the 
complete case analyses. There was little evidence of any between-arm differences 
in SMFQ scores (0.19, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.95, p = .62), or costs (£142, 95% CI 
-£132 to £415, p = .31) per person for CBT versus usual school provision.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that the universal provision of 
classroom-based CBT is unlikely to be either more effective or less costly than 
usual school provision.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously generated as a consequence of 
plant metabolic processes due to incomplete reduction of O2. Previously 
considered to be only toxic by-products of metabolism, ROS are now known to act 
as second messengers in intracellular signalling cascades to trigger tolerance 
of various abiotic and biotic stresses. The accumulation of proline is 
frequently observed during the exposure of plants to adverse environmental 
conditions. Interestingly proline metabolism may also contribute to ROS 
formation in mitochondria, which play notably a role in hypersensitive response 
in plants, life-span extension in worms and tumor suppression in animals. Here 
we review current knowledge about the regulation of proline metabolism in 
response to environmental constraints and highlight the key role of ROS in the 
regulation of this metabolism. The impact of proline on ROS generation is also 
investigated. Deciphering and integrating these relationships at the whole plant 
level will bring new perspectives on how plants adapt to environmental stresses.
