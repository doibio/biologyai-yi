BACKGROUND: Measurement of changes in health across locations is useful to 
compare and contrast changing epidemiological patterns against health system 
performance and identify specific needs for resource allocation in research, 
policy development, and programme decision making. Using the Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we drew from two widely used 
summary measures to monitor such changes in population health: 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We 
used these measures to track trends and benchmark progress compared with 
expected trends on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
METHODS: We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study 2016 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and 
non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and 
territories from 1990 to 2016. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost 
and years of life lived with disability for each location, age group, sex, and 
year. We estimated HALE using age-specific death rates and years of life lived 
with disability per capita. We explored how DALYs and HALE differed from 
expected trends when compared with the SDI: the geometric mean of income per 
person, educational attainment in the population older than age 15 years, and 
total fertility rate.
FINDINGS: The highest globally observed HALE at birth for both women and men was 
in Singapore, at 75·2 years (95% uncertainty interval 71·9-78·6) for females and 
72·0 years (68·8-75·1) for males. The lowest for females was in the Central 
African Republic (45·6 years [42·0-49·5]) and for males was in Lesotho (41·5 
years [39·0-44·0]). From 1990 to 2016, global HALE increased by an average of 
6·24 years (5·97-6·48) for both sexes combined. Global HALE increased by 6·04 
years (5·74-6·27) for males and 6·49 years (6·08-6·77) for females, whereas HALE 
at age 65 years increased by 1·78 years (1·61-1·93) for males and 1·96 years 
(1·69-2·13) for females. Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 
to 2016 (-2·3% [-5·9 to 0·9]), with decreases in communicable, maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) disease DALYs offset by increased DALYs due to 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The exemplars, calculated as the five lowest 
ratios of observed to expected age-standardised DALY rates in 2016, were 
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Maldives, Peru, and Israel. The leading three causes 
of DALYs globally were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and 
lower respiratory infections, comprising 16·1% of all DALYs. Total DALYs and 
age-standardised DALY rates due to most CMNN causes decreased from 1990 to 2016. 
Conversely, the total DALY burden rose for most NCDs; however, age-standardised 
DALY rates due to NCDs declined globally.
INTERPRETATION: At a global level, DALYs and HALE continue to show improvements. 
At the same time, we observe that many populations are facing growing functional 
health loss. Rising SDI was associated with increases in cumulative years of 
life lived with disability and decreases in CMNN DALYs offset by increased NCD 
DALYs. Relative compression of morbidity highlights the importance of continued 
health interventions, which has changed in most locations in pace with the gross 
domestic product per person, education, and family planning. The analysis of 
DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework with 
which to benchmark location-specific health performance. Country-specific 
drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected 
DALYs, should inform health policies, health system improvement initiatives, 
targeted prevention efforts, and development assistance for health, including 
financial and research investments for all countries, regardless of their level 
of sociodemographic development. The presence of countries that substantially 
outperform others suggests the need for increased scrutiny for proven examples 
of best practices, which can help to extend gains, whereas the presence of 
underperforming countries suggests the need for devotion of extra attention to 
health systems that need more robust support.

BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 
(GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of risk factor exposure and 
attributable burden of disease. By providing estimates over a long time series, 
this study can monitor risk exposure trends critical to health surveillance and 
inform policy debates on the importance of addressing risks in context.
METHODS: We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for 
previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, 
attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by 
age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and 
occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2016. This 
study included 481 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for 
convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk (RR) 
and exposure estimates from 22 717 randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled 
cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources, 
according to the GBD 2016 source counting methods. Using the counterfactual 
scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the 
portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. Finally, 
we explored four drivers of trends in attributable burden: population growth, 
population ageing, trends in risk exposure, and all other factors combined.
FINDINGS: Since 1990, exposure increased significantly for 30 risks, did not 
change significantly for four risks, and decreased significantly for 31 risks. 
Among risks that are leading causes of burden of disease, child growth failure 
and household air pollution showed the most significant declines, while 
metabolic risks, such as body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose, showed 
significant increases. In 2016, at Level 3 of the hierarchy, the three leading 
risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs at the global level for men were 
smoking (124·1 million DALYs [95% UI 111·2 million to 137·0 million]), high 
systolic blood pressure (122·2 million DALYs [110·3 million to 133·3 million], 
and low birthweight and short gestation (83·0 million DALYs [78·3 million to 
87·7 million]), and for women, were high systolic blood pressure (89·9 million 
DALYs [80·9 million to 98·2 million]), high body-mass index (64·8 million DALYs 
[44·4 million to 87·6 million]), and high fasting plasma glucose (63·8 million 
DALYs [53·2 million to 76·3 million]). In 2016 in 113 countries, the leading 
risk factor in terms of attributable DALYs was a metabolic risk factor. Smoking 
remained among the leading five risk factors for DALYs for 109 countries, while 
low birthweight and short gestation was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 38 
countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In terms of 
important drivers of change in trends of burden attributable to risk factors, 
between 2006 and 2016 exposure to risks explains an 9·3% (6·9-11·6) decline in 
deaths and a 10·8% (8·3-13·1) decrease in DALYs at the global level, while 
population ageing accounts for 14·9% (12·7-17·5) of deaths and 6·2% (3·9-8·7) of 
DALYs, and population growth for 12·4% (10·1-14·9) of deaths and 12·4% 
(10·1-14·9) of DALYs. The largest contribution of trends in risk exposure to 
disease burden is seen between ages 1 year and 4 years, where a decline of 27·3% 
(24·9-29·7) of the change in DALYs between 2006 and 2016 can be attributed to 
declines in exposure to risks.
INTERPRETATION: Increasingly detailed understanding of the trends in risk 
exposure and the RRs for each risk-outcome pair provide insights into both the 
magnitude of health loss attributable to risks and how modification of risk 
exposure has contributed to health trends. Metabolic risks warrant particular 
policy attention, due to their large contribution to global disease burden, 
increasing trends, and variable patterns across countries at the same level of 
development. GBD 2016 findings show that, while it has huge potential to improve 
health, risk modification has played a relatively small part in the past decade.

OBJECTIVE: The impact of age on survival after hepatic resection for 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been thoroughly examined. We reviewed the 
data of a nationwide follow-up survey to determine the outcomes of hepatectomy 
for HCC in elderly patients.
BACKGROUND: Management of malignant diseases in elderly patients has become a 
global clinical issue because of the increased life expectancy worldwide. 
Advancements in surgical techniques and perioperative management have reduced 
age-related contraindications for liver surgery.
METHODS: In all, 12,587 patients with HCC who underwent curative hepatic 
resection were included in this cohort study and classified according to age 
group [40-59 years (n = 2991), 60-74 years (n = 7576,), and ≥75 years (n = 
2020)]. Clinicopathological features, long-term survival, and cumulative 
incidences of death after hepatic resection were compared among the groups. The 
cause-specific subdistribution hazard ratios for 3 types of death depending on 
age were also estimated.
RESULTS: Preoperative liver function tests showed that the prothrombin activity 
and platelet count were higher in the ≥75-year age group than in the other age 
groups. The overall survival was significantly lower in the elderly than younger 
patients. However, recurrence-free survival was almost identical among the 3 
groups. The cumulative incidence of HCC-related or liver-related death was 
almost identical among the 3 groups; however, the cumulative incidence of other 
causes of death was significantly different. The 60-year subdistribution hazard 
ratio for other causes of death increased remarkably with increasing age.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients in this nationwide survey had significantly worse 
overall survival after hepatectomy than middle-aged and young patients. The 
cumulative incidence of other causes of death in elderly patients was 
significantly different from that of HCC-related or liver-related death among 
the 3 groups.

Update in
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2020 May 1;5:CD002309.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013 Nov 04;(11):CD002309.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with 
cough, sputum production or dyspnoea and a reduction in lung function, quality 
of life and life expectancy. Apart from smoking cessation, there are no other 
treatments that slow lung function decline. Roflumilast and cilomilast are oral 
phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors proposed to reduce the airway inflammation 
and bronchoconstriction seen in COPD. This is an update of a Cochrane review 
first published in 2011 and updated in 2013.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral PDE4 inhibitors in the 
management of stable COPD.
SEARCH METHODS: We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the 
Cochrane Airways Trials Register (date of last search October 2016). We found 
other trials from web-based clinical trials registers.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs if they compared oral PDE4 inhibitors with 
placebo in people with COPD. We allowed co-administration of standard COPD 
therapy.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author extracted data and a second 
review author checked the data. We reported pooled data in Review Manager as 
mean differences (MD), standardised mean differences (SMD) or odds ratios (OR). 
We converted the odds ratios into absolute treatment effects in a 'Summary of 
findings' table.
MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-four separate RCTs studying roflumilast (20 trials with 
17,627 participants) or cilomilast (14 trials with 6457 participants) met the 
inclusion criteria, with a duration of between six weeks and one year. These 
included people across international study centres with moderate to very severe 
COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades 
II-IV), with a mean age of 64 years.We considered that the methodological 
quality of the 34 published and unpublished trials was acceptable overall. 
Treatment with a PDE4 inhibitor was associated with a significant improvement in 
forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) over the trial period compared 
with placebo (MD 51.53 mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) 43.17 to 59.90, 27 
trials with 20,585 participants, moderate-quality evidence due to moderate 
levels of heterogeneity and risk of reporting bias). There were small 
improvements in quality of life (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), 
MD -1.06 units, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.43, 11 trials with 7645 participants, 
moderate-quality evidence due to moderate levels of heterogeneity and risk of 
reporting bias) and COPD-related symptoms, but no significant change in exercise 
tolerance. Treatment with a PDE4 inhibitor was associated with a reduced 
likelihood of COPD exacerbation (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.83; 23 trials with 
19,948 participants, high-quality evidence). For every 100 people treated with 
PDE4 inhibitors, five more remained exacerbation-free during the study period 
compared with placebo (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial 
outcome (NNTB) 20, 95% CI 16 to 26). More participants in the treatment groups 
experienced non-serious adverse events compared with controls, particularly a 
range of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting or 
dyspepsia. For every 100 people treated with PDE4 inhibitors, seven more 
suffered from diarrhoea during the study period compared with placebo (number 
needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 15, 95% CI 13 to 17). 
Roflumilast in particular was associated with weight loss during the trial 
period and an increase in insomnia and depressive mood symptoms. There was no 
significant effect of treatment on non-fatal serious adverse events (OR 0.99, 
95% CI 0.91 to 1.07) or mortality (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.23), although 
mortality was a rare event during the trials. Participants treated with PDE4 
inhibitors were more likely to withdraw from the trials because of adverse 
effects; on average 14% in the treatment groups withdrew compared with 8% in the 
control groups.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In people with COPD, PDE4 inhibitors offered benefit over 
placebo in improving lung function and reducing the likelihood of exacerbations; 
however, they had little impact on quality of life or symptoms. Gastrointestinal 
adverse effects and weight loss were common, and safety data submitted to the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have raised concerns over psychiatric adverse 
events with roflumilast. The findings of this review give cautious support to 
the use of PDE4 inhibitors in COPD. They may be best used as add-on therapy in a 
subgroup of people with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite optimal 
COPD management. This is in accordance with the GOLD 2017 guidelines. 
Longer-term trials are needed to determine whether or not PDE4 inhibitors modify 
FEV1 decline, hospitalisation or mortality in COPD.

BACKGROUND: Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) targeting depression 
have been shown to be clinically effective and are considered a cost-effective 
complement to established interventions. The aim of this review was to provide 
an overview of the evidence for the cost-effectiveness of IMIs for the treatment 
and prevention of depression.
METHODS: A systematic database search was conducted (Medline, PsychInfo, 
CENTRAL, PSYNDEX, OHE HEED). Relevant articles were selected according to 
defined eligibility criteria. IMIs were classified as cost-effective if they 
were below a willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP) of €22,845 (£20,000) - €34,267 
(£30,000) per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) according to the 
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) standard. Study 
quality was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting 
Standard guidelines and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.
RESULTS: Of 1538 studies, seven economic evaluations of IMIs for the treatment 
of major depression, four for the treatment of subthreshold/minor depression and 
one for the prevention of depression. In six studies, IMIs were classified as 
likely to be cost-effective with an incremental cost-utility ratio between €3088 
and €22,609. All of these IMIs were guided. Overall quality of most economic 
evaluations was evaluated as good. All studies showed some risk of bias.
LIMITATIONS: The studies used different methodologies and showed some risk of 
bias. These aspects as well as the classification of cost-effectiveness 
according to the WTP proposed by NICE should be considered when interpreting the 
results.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that guided IMIs for the treatment of 
(subthreshold) depression have the potential to be a cost-effective complement 
to established interventions, but more methodologically sound studies are 
needed.

Post-prostatectomy radiation therapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer.

Isharwal S(1), Stephenson AJ(1).

Author information:
(1)a Department of Urology , Glickman Urology and Kidney Institute, Cleveland 
Clinic , Cleveland , OH , USA.

Approximately 15-30% of men with localized prostate cancer will experience 
biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy. Postoperative 
radiation therapy is used in men with adverse pathological features to reduce 
the risk of BCR or with curative intent in men with known BCR. In this study, we 
review the evidence for the adjuvant and salvage radiation therapy after radical 
prostatectomy. Areas covered: A literature review of the Medline and Embase 
databases was performed. The search strategy included the following terms: 
prostate cancer, adjuvant radiotherapy, salvage radiotherapy, radical 
prostatectomy, biochemical recurrence, and prostate cancer recurrence. 
Prospective randomized trials for the adjuvant radiotherapy and observational 
studies supporting salvage radiotherapy were included for discussion. Expert 
commentary: As postoperative radiotherapy is associated with non-trivial risks 
of acute and long-term toxicity and given the absence of compelling data 
supporting adjuvant over early salvage radiotherapy, the authors advocate, with 
rare exceptions, close observation and timely (early) salvage radiotherapy for 
patients with BCR and long life expectancy. Adjuvant radiotherapy may be 
considered in patients at high-risk for recurrence. Observation is appropriate 
in patients with limited life expectancy and/or absence of adverse features.

BACKGROUND: The roll out of antiretroviral therapy in Botswana, as in many 
countries with near universal access to treatment, has transformed HIV into a 
complex yet manageable chronic condition and has led to the emergence of a 
population aging with HIV. Although there has been some realization of this 
development at international level, no clear defined intervention strategy has 
been established in many highly affected countries. Therefore we explored 
attitudes of policy-makers and service providers towards HIV among older adults 
(50 years or older) in Botswana.
METHODS: We conducted qualitative face-to-face interviews with 15 consenting 
personnel from the Ministry of Health, medical practitioners and 
non-governmental organizations involved in the administration of medical 
services, planning, strategies and policies that govern social, physical and 
medical intervention aimed at people living with HIV and health in general. The 
Shiffman and Smith Framework of how health issues become a priority was used as 
a guide for our analysis.
RESULTS: Amidst an HIV prevalence of 25% among those aged 50-64 years, the 
respondents passively recognized the predicament posed by a population aging 
with HIV but exhibited a lack of comprehension and acknowledgement of the extent 
of the issue. An underlying persistent ageist stigma regarding sexual behaviour 
existed among a number of interviewees. Respondents also noted the lack of 
defined geriatric care within the provision of the national health care system. 
There seemed, however, to be a debate among the policy strategists and care 
providers as to whether the appropriate response should be specifically towards 
older adults living with HIV or rather to improve health services for older 
adults more generally. Respondents acknowledged that health systems in Botswana 
are still configured for individual diseases rather than coexisting chronic 
diseases even though it has become increasingly common for patients, 
particularly the aged, to have two or more medical conditions at the same time.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV among older adults remains a low priority among policy-makers 
in Botswana but is at least now on the agenda. Action will require more 
concerted efforts to recognize HIV as a lifelong infection and putting greater 
emphasis on targeted care for older adults, focussing on multimorbidity.

Introduction: Le déploiement de la thérapie antirétrovirale auBotswana, comme 
dans nombreux pays avec près de l’accèsuniversel au traitement, a transformé le 
VIH une maladiechronique complexe mais facile à gérer et a conduit àl’émergence 
d’un vieillissement de la population avec le VIH.Bien qu’il y a eu quelques 
réalisation de cette évolution auniveau international, aucune stratégie 
d’intervention définisclairement n’établi dans de nombreux pays fortement 
touchés.C’est pourquoi nous avons exploré les attitudes des décideurset des 
fournisseurs de services pour le VIH chez les personnesâgées (50 ans ou plus) au 
Botswana. Méthodes: Nous avonsmené qualitatives entrevues face à face avec 15 
personnelconsentant de la Ministère de la santé, les médecins et 
lesorganisations non gouvernementales participant àl’administration des services 
médicaux, planification, stratégieset les politiques qui régissent 
l’intervention sociale, physique etmédicale destiné aux personnes vivant avec le 
VIH et la santéen général. Le Shiffman et Smith cadre de comment lesquestions de 
santé deviennent une priorité a été utilisé commeun guide pour notre analyse. 
Résultats: Au milieu d’un VIHprévalence de 25 % chez ceux âgés de 50 à 64 
ans,passivement, les intimés ont reconnu les difficultés posées parun 
vieillissement de la population avec le VIH maisprésentaient un manque de 
compréhension et reconnaissancede l’ampleur de la question. Un stigmate 
persistant âgistessous-jacente concernant le comportement sexuel existait chezun 
certain nombre de personnes interrogées. Répondants ontégalement signalé 
l’absence de soins gériatriques définis ausein de la fourniture du système 
national de soins de santé. Ilsemble, cependant, être un débat parmi les 
stratègespolitiques et les prestataires de soins quant à savoir si laréponse 
appropriée devrait être spécifiquement vers lesadultes âgés vivant avec le VIH 
ou plutôt d’améliorer lesservices de santé aux personnes âgées plus 
généralement.Répondants ont reconnu que les systèmes de santé auBotswana sont 
encore configurés pour maladies individuellesplutôt que des maladies chroniques 
pouvant coexister mêmes’il est devenu plus en plus courant pour les 
patients,particulièrement les personnes âgées, d’avoir deux ouplusieurs medical 
conditions en même temps. Conclusions: Le VIH chez les personnes âgées reste une 
faible priorité parmiles décideurs au Botswana mais est au moins maintenant 
àl’ordre du jour. Action nécessitera des efforts plus concertéspour reconnaître 
le VIH comme une infection permanente etmettant davantage l’accent sur les soins 
ciblés pour les aînés,en mettant l’accent sur la multimorbidité.

BACKGROUND: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have higher rates of 
chronic disease and a lower life expectancy than non-Indigenous Australians. In 
non-urban areas these health disparities are even larger. The aim of this 
qualitative study was to explore perceived barriers and enablers to attending an 
eight-week physical activity program in a rural and regional setting which aimed 
to improve health outcomes, but had a low attendance rate.
METHODS: Thirty-four Indigenous Australians participated in the intervention 
from the rural (n = 12) and the regional (n = 22) community. Qualitative 
semi-structured individual interviews were conducted at the follow-up health 
assessments with 12 participants. A thematic network analysis was undertaken to 
examine the barriers and enablers to participation in the program.
RESULTS: Overall, there were positive attitudes to, and high levels of 
motivation towards, the physical activity program. Enablers to participation 
were the inclusion of family members, no financial cost and a good relationship 
with the principal investigator, which was strengthened by the community-based 
participatory approach to the program design. Barriers to program attendance 
were mostly beyond the control of the individuals, such as 'sorry business', 
needing to travel away from the community and lack of community infrastructure.
CONCLUSIONS: More consideration is needed prior to implementation of programs to 
understand how community-specific barriers and enablers will affect attendance 
to the program.

The most common infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are lung 
infections. The microorganisms causing these infections most frequently are 
Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium abscessus 
complex. Their incidence has increased in the last three decades. After 
identifying an NTM in the respiratory tract, clinical and radiological aspects 
must be considered to determine if isolations are clinically relevant. 
Predisposing conditions that could contribute to infection must also be 
investigated. Pulmonary disease due to NTM is presented in three clinical forms: 
a) pneumonitis due to hypersensitivity; b) fibrocavitary form; and c) 
nodular-bronchiectasic. The diagnosis of respiratory disease due to NTM does not 
make it obligatory to immediately initiate treatment. Before initiating the 
latter, other factors must be considered, such as age, comorbidities, life 
expectancy, due to the prolonged nature of treatments, with potential side 
effects and, in many cases, only a slight response to the treatment.

The Decline in Adult Activities Among U.S. Adolescents, 1976-2016.

The social and historical contexts may influence the speed of development. In 
seven large, nationally representative surveys of U.S. adolescents 1976-2016 
(N = 8.44 million, ages 13-19), fewer adolescents in recent years engaged in 
adult activities such as having sex, dating, drinking alcohol, working for pay, 
going out without their parents, and driving, suggesting a slow life strategy. 
Adult activities were less common when median income, life expectancy, college 
enrollment, and age at first birth were higher and family size and pathogen 
prevalence were lower, consistent with life history theory. The trends are 
unlikely to be due to homework and extracurricular time, which stayed steady or 
declined, and may or may not be linked to increased Internet use.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the usage of cost-utility analysis (CUA) in oral health 
interventions and to evaluate the methods used and the reporting quality of CUA 
in publications on oral health interventions.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed on literature published between 2000 
and 2016 where cost-utility analyses of oral health interventions were included. 
The reporting quality of these oral health CUAs was assessed against the 
Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist.
RESULTS: Of the 6637 publications identified initially, 23 met the inclusion 
criteria. Of these, 14 (61%) had been published in the last 6 years. Included 
studies were on oral cancer (n = 6), provision of dental prosthesis (n = 6), 
dental caries (n = 4), periodontal diseases (n = 3), antibiotic prophylaxis (n = 
2), dento-facial anomalies (n = 1) and dental service provision (n = 1). 
Twenty-one studies were able to identify the most cost-effective intervention 
among the different options compared. Of the 23 studies identified, 15 (65%) 
used quality-adjusted life years (QALY) as the outcome measure, and 18 (78%) 
reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The economic perspective was 
clearly stated in 13 articles (57%). Twenty studies (87%) reported the discount 
rate, and 22 (96%) undertook sensitivity analysis. The reporting quality of 
studies, appraised by the CHEERS checklist, varied from 75% to 100% (median 
92%).
CONCLUSION: The use of CUAs in evaluation of oral health interventions has been 
increasing recently, especially from 2011 to 2016. The majority of CUA articles 
were of good reporting quality as assessed by the CHEERS checklist and were able 
to provide conclusions regarding the most cost-effective intervention among the 
different options compared: this will assist in healthcare decision-making and 
resource allocation. These positive outcomes of our study encourage wider use of 
CUAs within the dental and oral health professions.

Background Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia are at high 
risk of cardiovascular disease due to high low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL)-cholesterol levels. Cardiovascular disease outcome studies are impossible 
to conduct, due to the rarity of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. We 
modelled the potential efficacy of lomitapide, a microsomal transfer protein 
inhibitor, on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and survival. Design 
We calculated the effect on cardiovascular outcomes of a 38% plasma 
LDL-cholesterol reduction induced by lomitapide. Methods Age-dependent hazards 
and treatment-dependent hazard ratios for mortality and time to first MACE were 
calculated from an observational study of 149 South African homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia patients. Cardiovascular-related mortality hazards were 
derived by adjusting for general population non-cardiovascular-related 
mortality. For every mmol/L LDL-cholesterol reduction, a relative risk 
reductions of 23% (mortality) and 15% (major adverse cardiovascular events) were 
observed. Results For the most robust model, baseline median survival with 
current treatments (LDL-cholesterol 8.7 mmol/L) was 48 years. In the survival 
benefit analysis, starting lomitapide at age 18 years and reducing 
LDL-cholesterol by 3.3 mmol/L from baseline would increase life expectancy by 
11.2 years and delay the time to first MACE by 5.7 years. Analysis suggested 
lifetime lomitapide treatment could increase median life expectancy by 11.7 
years and time to first MACE by 6.7 years. Conclusion Our modelling analyses 
show that additional LDL-cholesterol lowering by lomitapide may increase life 
expectancy in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Further 
clinical studies are warranted to determine the cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality benefits of lomitapide.
