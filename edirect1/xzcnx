conducted. The second stage will involve updating a systematic review on 
electronic cigarettes identified in the overview; randomized controlled trials 
will be considered for outcomes relating to benefits while randomized controlled 
trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and comparative observational studies 
will be considered for evaluating harms. Search strategies will be developed and 
peer-reviewed by medical information specialists. The search strategy for the 
updated review on e-cigarettes will be developed using that of the candidate 
systematic review. The MEDLINE®, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library 
electronic databases will be searched as of 2008 for the overview of reviews and 
from the last search date of the selected review for the updated review. 
Organizational websites and trial registries will be searched for unpublished or 
ongoing reviews/studies. Two reviewers will independently screen the title and 
abstracts of citations using the liberal accelerated method. Full-text screening 
will be performed independently by two reviewers. Extracted data will be 
verified by a second reviewer. Disagreements regarding full-text screening and 
data extraction will be resolved by consensus or third-party adjudication. The 
methodological quality of systematic reviews, risk of bias of randomized and 
non-randomized trials, and methodological quality of cohort studies will be 
evaluated using AMSTAR 2, the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and a modified version 
of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network critical appraisal tool, 
respectively. The GRADE framework will be used to assess the quality of the 
evidence for outcomes.
DISCUSSION: The evidence review will evaluate the benefits and harms of various 
stop smoking interventions for adults. Findings will be used to inform a 
national tobacco cessation guideline by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive 
Health Care.

Hemophilia A is an X-linked genetic hemorrhagic disorder characterized by a 
factor VIII deficiency. The availability of secured substitution products has 
led to a dramatic improvement of life expectancy in hemophiliac patients. 
Nowadays, adult hemophiliac patients may develop Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) 
resulting from age-related comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, diabetes). In 
addition, the high prevalence of viral infections in this population exposes 
patients to an increased risk of CKD. The risk of hemorrhage in hemophiliac 
patients is a challenge for their clinical management, both for diagnostic 
procedures (kidney biopsy in particular) and for renal replacement therapy 
(dialysis or renal transplantation) when it is needed. This work provides an 
update of the literature data concerning the management of hemophiliac patients 
in nephrology, illustrated by the cases of two patients.

Recombination in mammals is not uniformly distributed along the chromosome but 
concentrated in small regions known as recombination hotspots. Recombination 
starts with the double-strand break of a chromosomal sequence and results in the 
transmission of the sequence that does not break (preventing recombination) more 
often than the sequence that breaks (allowing recombination). Thus recombination 
itself renders individual recombination hotspots inactive and over time should 
drive them to extinction in the genome. Empirical evidence shows that individual 
recombination hotspots die but, far from being driven to extinction, they are 
abundant in the genome: a contradiction referred to as the Recombination Hotspot 
Paradox. What saves recombination hotspots from extinction? The current answer 
relies in the formation of new recombination hotspots in new genomic sites 
driven by viability selection in favor of recombination. Here we formulate a 
population genetics model that incorporates the molecular mechanism initiating 
recombination in mammals (PRDM9-like genes), to provide an alternative solution 
to the paradox. We find that weak selection allows individual recombination 
hotspots to become inactive (die) while saving them from extinction in the 
genome by driving their re-activation (resurrection). Our model shows that when 
selection for recombination is weak, the introduction of rare variants causes 
recombination sites to oscillate between hot and cold phenotypes with a 
recombination hotspot dying only to come back. Counter-intuitively, we find that 
low viability selection leaves a hard selective sweep signature in the genome, 
with the selective sweep at the recombination hotspot being the hardest when 
viability selection is the lowest. Our model can help to understand the rapid 
evolution of PRDM9, the co-existence of two types of hotspots, the life 
expectancy of hotspots, and the volatility of the recombinational landscape 
(with hotspots rarely being shared between closely related species).

BACKGROUND: There is no recommended therapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma 
that has progressed after first-line pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Disease control has been less than 30% in all previous studies of second-line 
drugs. Preliminary results have suggested that anti-programmed cell death 1 
(PD-1) monoclonal antibody could be efficacious in these patients. We thus aimed 
to prospectively assess the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody alone or in 
combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA-4) antibody in 
patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.
METHODS: This multicentre randomised, non-comparative, open-label, phase 2 trial 
was done at 21 hospitals in France. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or 
older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, 
histologically proven malignant pleural mesothelioma progressing after 
first-line or second-line pemetrexed and platinum-based treatments, measurable 
disease by CT, and life expectancy greater than 12 weeks. Patients were randomly 
allocated (1:1) to receive intravenous nivolumab (3 mg/kg bodyweight) every 2 
weeks, or intravenous nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) plus intravenous 
ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks), given until progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. Central randomisation was stratified by histology (epithelioid vs 
non-epithelioid), treatment line (second line vs third line), and 
chemosensitivity to previous treatment (progression ≥3 months vs <3 months after 
pemetrexed treatment) and used a minimisation method with a 0·8 random factor. 
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who achieved 12-week disease 
control, assessed by masked independent central review; the primary endpoint 
would be met if disease control was achieved in at least 40% of patients. The 
primary endpoint was assessed in the first 108 eligible patients. Efficacy 
analyses were also done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses 
were done in all patients who received at least one dose of their assigned 
treatment. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02716272.
FINDINGS: Between March 24 and August 25, 2016, 125 eligible patients were 
recruited and assigned to either nivolumab (n=63) or nivolumab plus ipilimumab 
(n=62). In the first 108 eligible patients, 12-week disease control was achieved 
by 24 (44%; 95% CI 31-58) of 54 patients in the nivolumab group and 27 (50%; 
37-63) of 54 patients in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group. In the 
intention-to-treat population, 12-week disease control was achieved by 25 (40%; 
28-52) of 63 patients in the nivolumab group and 32 (52%; 39-64) of 62 patients 
in the combination group. Nine (14%) of 63 patients in the nivolumab group and 
16 (26%) of 61 patients in the combination group had grade 3-4 toxicities. The 
most frequent grade 3 adverse events were asthenia (one [2%] in the nivolumab 
group vs three [5%] in the combination group), asymptomatic increase in 
aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase (none vs four [7%] of 
each), and asymptomatic lipase increase (two [3%] vs one [2%]). No patients had 
toxicities leading to death in the nivolumab group, whereas three (5%) of 62 in 
the combination group did (one fulminant hepatitis, one encephalitis, and one 
acute kidney failure).
INTERPRETATION: Anti-PD-1 nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab plus anti-CTLA-4 
ipilimumab combination therapy both showed promising activity in relapsed 
patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, without unexpected toxicity. These 
regimens require confirmation in larger clinical trials.

Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake is associated with tooth decay, obesity 
and diabetes. We aimed to model the health and cost impact of reducing the 
serving size of all single serve SSB to a maximum of 250 ml in New Zealand. A 
250 ml serving size cap was modeled for all instances of single serves (<600 ml) 
of sugar-sweetened carbonated soft drinks, fruit drinks, carbonated energy 
drinks, and sports drinks in the New Zealand National Nutrition Survey intake 
data (2008/09). A multi-state life-table model used the change in energy intake 
and therefore BMI to predict the resulting health gains in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and health system costs over the remaining life course of the 
New Zealand population alive in 2011 (N = 4.4 million, 3% discounting). The 
'base case' model (no compensation for reduced energy intake) resulted in an 
average reduction in SSB and energy intake of 23 ml and 44 kJ (11 kcal) per day 
or 0.22 kg of weight modeled over two years. The total health gain and 
cost-savings were 82,100 QALYs (95% UI: 65100 to 101,000) and NZ$1.65 billion 
[b] (95% UI: 1.19 b to 2.24 b, (US$1.10 b)) over the lifespan of the cohort. 
QALY gains increased to 116,000 when the SSB definition was widened to include 
fruit juices and sweetened milks. A cap on single serve SSB could be an 
effective part of a suite of obesity prevention and sugar reduction 
interventions in high income countries.

In recent years, there has been a very active debate about the stability of drug 
products especially after exceeding the expiry dates. The regulatory authorities 
require comprehensive stability data for market approval. The shelf-life 
obtained determines the expiry date, which is typically between 1 and 5 years 
and commonly set in a conservative manner. Conducting stability studies is a 
resource- and time-consuming matter for the pharmaceutical manufacturer. Short 
shelf-lives of drug products are also a challenge for managers of hospitals, 
nursing homes, and strategic national stockpile agencies which have to dispose 
of large quantities of outdated medicines every year. This conflict raises the 
question whether shelf-lives are often longer than the labeled one. In the past 
years, the FDA has launched several programs for shelf-life extension in order 
to defer replacement costs and to prevent drug shortages due to supply 
disruption. The aim of this review was to bring together the available 
literature of expired drug products as well as historical pharmaceutical relicts 
with an age of more than 80 years and to discuss the actual shelf-life with 
regard to the respective dosage form and the affiliation of the drug class. It 
seems to be reasonable for a large portion of drugs to extend the expiry dates 
far beyond five years.

CGRP ligand and receptor monoclonal antibodies for migraine prevention: Evidence 
review and clinical implications.

Dodick DW(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.

Erratum in
    Cephalalgia. 2019 Jul;39(8):1069.

BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies that target calcitonin gene-related peptide or 
the canonical calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor have emerged as effective 
and well tolerated for the preventive treatment of migraine. These large 
molecules appear ideally suited for migraine prevention. They have an extended 
biological half-life, are administered either monthly or quarterly either by 
subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion, require minimal or no 
dose-titration and have the potential for a rapid onset of effect compared to 
conventional oral preventive drugs. There is high selectivity and they target an 
important mediator in the pathogenesis of migraine.
INVESTIGATION: Phase II and pivotal phase III studies have all yielded positive 
results with a favorable adverse event profile. No serious treatment-related 
adverse outcomes have thus far been reported in controlled or long-term 
open-label extension studies. This tolerability profile promises to improve 
adherence and, possibly, long-term outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies are effective 
and well tolerated for the preventive treatment of migraine. They have distinct 
advantages over currently available oral preventive drugs. While 
treatment-related serious adverse events have not been observed in open-label 
extension studies, long-term outcomes and safety will require broad exposure in 
heterogeneous patient populations in clinical practice. In addition, their 
safety in women, especially during pregnancy, will require longitudinal 
surveillance. Given the overlapping mechanism(s), the effectiveness of existing 
(triptans) and emerging (calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists) 
acute therapies in those using a calcitonin gene-related peptide mAb will 
require further study.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the generic or disease-specific pediatric quality of life 
(QoL) instruments used in oral health research among children and adolescents 
and to provide an overview of these QoL instruments.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed with multiple databases to 
identify the pediatric QoL instruments used in oral health research.
RESULTS: The literature search yielded 872 records; from these, 16 pediatric QoL 
instruments were identified that had been used among children and adolescents in 
oral health research. Of these, 11 were oral health-specific QoL instruments and 
five were generic instruments. Of the 11 oral health-specific QoL instruments, 
none were multiattribute utility instruments (MAUI), whereas of the five generic 
instruments, two (Child Health Utility 9D index and EuroQoL-5D youth) were 
classified as an MAUI. Except for one, all pediatric QoL instruments were 
published after the year 2000 and the majority originated from the USA (n = 8). 
Of the 11 oral health-specific QoL instruments, five instruments are designed 
for the respondent to be a child (i.e., self-report), one uses proxy responses 
from a parent or guardian, and five instruments have both self and proxy 
versions. Of the five generic QoL instruments, one uses proxy responses and the 
other four instruments have both self and proxy versions.
CONCLUSIONS: This review identified a wide variety of pediatric oral 
health-specific and generic QoL instruments used in oral health research among 
children and adolescents. The availability of these QoL instruments provides 
researchers with the opportunity to select the instrument most suited to address 
their research question.

A standardized 5-level EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) valuation 
protocol was first used in national studies in the period 2012 to 2013. A set of 
problems encountered in this initial wave of valuation studies led to the 
subsequent refinement of the valuation protocol. To clarify lessons learned and 
how the protocol was updated when moving from version 1.0 to the current version

OBJECTIVES: Interest in the measurement of health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) in children and adolescents has been increasing, and appropriate 
instruments are required for this target group. This article focuses on the 
EQ-5D-Y instrument, presenting an overview of its characteristics, development, 
and current use, and includes a discussion of methodological and conceptual 
issues related to the valuation of child health and the development of an 
EQ-5D-Y value set.
METHODS: This article brings together the experiences of the research team that 
developed and validated the EQ-5D-Y, supplemented by information derived from 
EQ-5D-Y study registrations on the EuroQol Group's website.
RESULTS: EQ-5D-Y is a child-specific and age-appropriate measure of HRQoL. Study 
registration data show that the instrument's use has steadily increased since 
its first publication. It has been used in various types of studies and in 
different disease areas. Currently there is no value set for EQ-5D-Y, and so its 
use in cost-utility analysis (CUA) is limited. There are methodological and 
conceptual issues that affect the design of valuation studies for child health. 
Issues that are discussed include the need for separate value sets for children 
and adolescents, the choice of appropriate reference samples and valuation 
techniques, and the framing of the tasks.
CONCLUSIONS: Research on EQ-5D-Y and its use has increased in the last years. 
Further research is required to clarify methodological issues regarding health 
state valuation in children and adolescents. This will support the development 
of a value set for EQ-5D-Y and the use of EQ-5D-Y in CUA.

Matter?

OBJECTIVES: To explore how the use of EQ-5D-5L value set and crosswalk from 
EQ-5D-5L to EQ-5D-3L (and use of 3L value set) would affect cost-effectiveness 
analysis results for England and six other countries (Canada, the Netherlands, 
China, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore).
METHODS: Individual-level utilities derived from primary 5L data using both 
value set (5L) and crosswalk (c5L) approaches were applied to three Markov 
models assessing the cost-effectiveness of hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal 
dialysis (PD) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients to estimate 
incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The mathematic functions 
between incremental QALY and utility were derived.
RESULTS: 5L- and c5L-based incremental QALYs were similar in the model for 
non-diabetic patients (range: 1.910-2.149, 1.922-2.121). 5L tends to generate 
more incremental QALYs than c5L in the model for diabetic patients (range: 
1.454-1.633, 1.365-1.568) but fewer incremental QALYs in the model for all ESRD 
patients (range: 0.290-0.480, 0.315-0.493). In all models, 5L (c5L) generated 
more incremental QALYs when Chinese (South Korean) value sets were used. The 
largest and smallest differences in 5L- and c5L-based incremental QALYs were 
observed when Chinese and Dutch value sets were used. Incremental QALYs was a 
positive linear function of both utility of PD and difference in utilities of HD 
and PD.
CONCLUSIONS: The value set and crosswalk approaches may not be used 
interchangeably in economic evaluation when EQ-5D-5L data are used to estimate 
utilities. Results of cost-effectiveness analysis using Markov models may be 
affected by both absolute utilities and their differences.

The widespread adoption of the EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) has 
been important for the comparability, transparency, and consistency of economic 
evaluations for informing resource allocation in healthcare. The objectives of 
this article were to (1) critically assess whether the widespread adoption of 
the EQ-5D and its time trade-off-based value sets to inform economic evaluation 
is likely to continue and (2) speculate about how benefits may be measured and 
valued to inform economic evaluation in the future. Evidence supports the use of 
the EQ-5D in many areas of health, but there are notable gaps. Furthermore, 
there has been interest among some policy makers in measuring changes in 
well-being, and in using common outcomes across sectors. Possibilities for 
measuring well-being alongside health can be achieved through bolt-on dimensions 
or an entirely new measure capturing both health and well-being. Nevertheless, 
there are significant concerns about the logic of estimating a common utility 
function. The development of online valuation methods has had a major impact on 
the field, which is likely to continue. We, however, recommend more allowance 
for respondents to consider their answers. There is an ongoing debate on the 
role of patient values or experience-based values. To date, this has seen 
limited take-up by decision makers and there are significant technical problems 
to obtaining representative and meaningful values. Policy makers and the general 
population must decide on the focus and scope of benefits that are incorporated 
into economic evaluation, and current evidence on this is mixed. In part, this 
will determine whether the widespread adoption will continue.

Economic Evaluation for Health Investments En Route to Universal Health 
Coverage: Cost-Benefit Analysis or Cost-Effectiveness Analysis?

BACKGROUND: It is an unresolved issue as to whether cost-benefit analysis (CBA) 
or cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is the preferable analytical toolkit for 
use in health technology assessment (HTA). The distinction between the two and 
an expressed preference for CEA go back at least to 1980 in the USA and, most 
recently, a Harvard-based group has been reappraising the case for CBA.
OBJECTIVES: This article seeks to answer the question: would the use of 
cost-benefit analysis rather than the more usual cost-effectiveness analysis be 
an improvement, specifically in appraising health and health-related investments 
in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) as they transition to Universal 
Health Coverage?.
METHODS/RESULTS: A selective literature review charts the welfare economics 
(welfarism and extra-welfarism) roots of both approaches. The principal 
distinguishing feature of the two is the monetary valuation of health outcomes 
under CBA compared with the use of health constructs such as the 
Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY) or Disability-Adjusted Life-Year (DALY) under 
CEA. The former enables direct comparison of the outcomes of health investments 
with the monetized outcomes of other investments, while the CEA approach 
facilitates direct comparisons with other health investments. Seven challenges 
in using CBA in developing countries arise, including ethical issues in outcome 
valuation, practical challenges in the acquisition of data, intrinsic bias in 
data on values, and some of the practical issues of implementation for either 
CBA or CEA.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude with a list of nine issues that both CBA and CEA need 
to settle if they are to be useful in LMICs. For the immediate future we judge 
CBA to be the less practicable.

During the trunk-to-tail transition, axial progenitors relocate from the 
epiblast to the tail bud. Here, we show that this process entails a major 
regulatory switch, bringing tail bud progenitors under Gdf11 signaling control. 
Gdf11 mutant embryos have an increased number of such progenitors that favor 
neural differentiation routes, resulting in a dramatic expansion of the neural 
tube. Moreover, inhibition of Gdf11 signaling recovers the proliferation ability 
of these progenitors when cultured in vitro. Tail bud progenitor growth is 
independent of Oct4, relying instead on Lin28 activity. Gdf11 signaling 
eventually activates Hox genes of paralog group 13, which halt expansion of 
these progenitors, at least in part, by down-regulating Lin28 genes. Our results 
uncover a genetic network involving Gdf11, Lin28, and Hox13 genes controlling 
axial progenitor activity in the tail bud.

Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin related cancer affecting 1 in 7 men 
in the United States. Treatment of patients with prostate cancer still remains a 
difficult decision-making process that requires physicians to balance clinical 
benefits, life expectancy, comorbidities, and treatment-related side effects. 
Gleason score (a sum of the primary and secondary Gleason patterns) solely based 
on morphological prostate glandular architecture has shown as one of the best 
predictors of prostate cancer outcome. Significant progress has been made on 
molecular subtyping prostate cancer delineated through the increasing use of 
gene sequencing. Prostate cancer patients with Gleason score of 7 show 
heterogeneity in recurrence and survival outcomes. Therefore, we propose to 
assess the correlation between histopathology images and genomic data with 
disease recurrence in prostate tumors with a Gleason 7 score to identify 
prognostic markers. In the study, we identify image biomarkers within tissue 
WSIs by modeling the spatial relationship from automatically created patches as 
a sequence within WSI by adopting a recurrence network model, namely long 
short-term memory (LSTM). Our preliminary results demonstrate that integrating 
image biomarkers from CNN with LSTM and genomic pathway scores, is more strongly 
correlated with patients recurrence of disease compared to standard clinical 
markers and engineered image texture features. The study further demonstrates 
that prostate cancer patients with Gleason score of 4+3 have a higher risk of 
disease progression and recurrence compared to prostate cancer patients with 
Gleason score of 3+4.

BACKGROUND: Korean ginseng is an important cash crop in Asian countries. 
However, plant yield is reduced by pathogens. Among the Ilyonectria 
radicicola-species complex, I. mors-panacis is responsible for root-rot and 
replant failure of ginseng in Asia. The development of new methods to reveal the 
existence of the pathogen before cultivation is started is essential. Therefore, 
a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method was developed to 
detect and quantify the pathogen in ginseng soils.
METHODS: In this study, a species-specific histone H3 primer set was developed 
for the quantification of I. mors-panacis. The primer set was used on DNA from 
other microbes to evaluate its sensitivity and selectivity for I. mors-panacis 
DNA. Sterilized soil samples artificially infected with the pathogen at 
different concentrations were used to evaluate the ability of the primer set to 
detect the pathogen population in the soil DNA. Finally, the pathogen was 
quantified in many natural soil samples.
RESULTS: The designed primer set was found to be sensitive and selective for 
I. mors-panacis DNA. In artificially infected sterilized soil samples, using 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction the estimated amount of 
template was positively correlated with the pathogen concentration in soil 
samples (R 2  = 0.95), disease severity index (R 2  = 0.99), and colony-forming 
units (R 2  = 0.87). In natural soils, the pathogen was recorded in most fields 
producing bad yields at a range of 5.82 ± 2.35 pg/g to 892.34 ± 103.70 pg/g of 
soil.
CONCLUSION: According to these results, the proposed primer set is applicable 
for estimating soil quality before ginseng cultivation. This will contribute to 
disease management and crop protection in the future.
