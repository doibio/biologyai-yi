a rigid WHO to reduce upper limb impairment, in combination with usual 
multidisciplinary care, is worth the effort and costs.

BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive fatal 
neurodegenerative disease, involving both upper and lower motor neurons. The 
disease is induced by multifactorial pathologies, and as such, it requires a 
multifaceted therapeutic approach. CXCR4, a chemokine receptor widely expressed 
in neurons and glial cells and its ligand, CXCL12, also known as 
stromal-cell-derived factor (SDF1), modulate both neuronal function and 
apoptosis by glutamate release signaling as well as hematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells (HSPCs) migration into the blood and their homing towards 
injured sites. Inhibition approaches towards the CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling may 
result in preventing neuronal apoptosis and alter the HSPCs migration and 
homing. Such inhibition can be achieved by means of treatment with AMD3100, an 
antagonist of the chemokine receptor CXCR4.
METHODS: We chronically treated male and female transgenic mice model of ALS, 
SOD1(G93A) mice, with AMD3100. Mice body weight and motor function, evaluated by 
Rotarod test, were recorded once a week. The most effective treatment regimen 
was repeated for biochemical and histological analyses in female mice.
RESULTS: We found that chronic administration of AMD3100 to SOD1(G93A) mice led 
to significant extension in mice lifespan and improved motor function and weight 
loss. In addition, the treatment significantly improved microglial pathology and 
decreased proinflammatory cytokines in spinal cords of treated female mice. 
Furthermore, AMD3100 treatment decreased blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) 
permeability by increasing tight junction proteins levels and increased the 
motor neurons count in the lamina X area of the spinal cord, where adult stem 
cells are formed.
CONCLUSIONS: These data, relevant to the corresponding disease mechanism in 
human ALS, suggest that blocking CXCR4 by the small molecule, AMD3100, may 
provide a novel candidate for ALS therapy with an increased safety.

BACKGROUND: Eczema, synonymous with atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis, is a 
chronic skin disease that has a similar impact on health-related quality of life 
as other chronic diseases. The proposed research aims to provide a comprehensive 
systematic assessment of the economic evidence base available to inform economic 
modelling and decision making on interventions to prevent and treat eczema at 
any stage of the life course. Whilst the Global Resource of Eczema Trials 
(GREAT) database collects together the effectiveness evidence for eczema, there 
is currently no such systematic resource on the economics of eczema. It is 
important to gain an overview of the current state of the art of economic 
methods in the field of eczema in order to strengthen the economic evidence base 
further.
METHODS/DESIGN: The proposed study is a systematic review of the economic 
evidence surrounding interventions for the prevention and treatment of eczema. 
Relevant search terms will be used to search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Database of 
Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, National Health Service (NHS) 
Economic Evaluation Database, Health Technology Assessment, Cumulative Index to 
Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EconLit, Scopus, Cost-Effectiveness 
Analysis Registry and Web of Science in order to identify relevant evidence. To 
be eligible for inclusion studies will be primary empirical studies evaluating 
the cost, utility or full economic evaluation of interventions for preventing or 
treating eczema. Two reviewers will independently assess studies for eligibility 
and perform data abstraction. Evidence tables will be produced presenting 
details of study characteristics, costing methods, outcome methods and quality 
assessment. The methodological quality of studies will be assessed using 
accepted checklists.
DISCUSSION: The systematic review is being undertaken to identify the type of 
economic evidence available, summarise the results of the available economic 
evidence and critically appraise the quality of economic evidence currently 
available to inform future economic modelling and resource allocation decisions 
about interventions to prevent or treat eczema. We aim to use the review to 
offer guidance about how to gather economic evidence in studies of eczema and/or 
what further research is necessary in order to inform this.

In a modern society that is increasingly older and "heavier," it is 
understandable that the majority favors a slimmer body that helps to sail 
smoothly into the dusk of life. Given the association between obesity and many 
metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, there are stern criticisms over such a 
thought of "good fat". Ironically, a phenomenon called "obesity paradox", that 
is, the overweight population purportedly enjoys the lowest all-cause mortality, 
and baffles open-minded clinicians and scientists. Lipids are essential to all 
life forms. Fat, in particular, triacylglycerol, also exists in different forms 
and in different locations in the human body, making any simple statement that 
vilifies all fat invalid. Whether the phenomenon of obesity paradox, indeed, has 
its root in a hitherto unrealized pro-survival function of fat deserves a 
serious look. Indeed, a recent publication using yeast as the model showed that 
elevation in the cellular storage of triacylglycerol extends lifespan in an 
energy expenditure independent fashion. In stark contrast, lean cells devoid of 
triacylglycerol biosynthetic capability die upon entering the senescence phase. 
Together, a new cytoprotective function of fat emerges. This mini-review aims to 
discuss potential mechanisms for the observed lifespan preservation function of 
triacylglycerol.

Men have a shorter life expectancy compared with women but the underlying 
factor(s) are not clear. Late-onset, sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) is a common 
and lethal neurodegenerative disorder and many germline inherited variants have 
been found to influence the risk of developing AD. Our previous results show 
that a fundamentally different genetic variant, i.e., lifetime-acquired loss of 
chromosome Y (LOY) in blood cells, is associated with all-cause mortality and an 
increased risk of non-hematological tumors and that LOY could be induced by 
tobacco smoking. We tested here a hypothesis that men with LOY are more 
susceptible to AD and show that LOY is associated with AD in three independent 
studies of different types. In a case-control study, males with AD diagnosis had 
higher degree of LOY mosaicism (adjusted odds ratio = 2.80, p = 0.0184, AD 
events = 606). Furthermore, in two prospective studies, men with LOY at blood 
sampling had greater risk for incident AD diagnosis during follow-up time 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 6.80, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 2.16-21.43, AD 
events = 140, p = 0.0011). Thus, LOY in blood is associated with risks of both 
AD and cancer, suggesting a role of LOY in blood cells on disease processes in 
other tissues, possibly via defective immunosurveillance. As a male-specific 
risk factor, LOY might explain why males on average live shorter lives than 
females.

BACKGROUND: The kidney is the most frequently transplanted human organ 
worldwide. In patients with end-stage renal failure, renal transplantation 
improves both quality of life and life expectancy. The current literature 
indicates that the numbers of renal recipients over 60 years of age has 
increased in recent years.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence and management of lower urinary tract 
symptoms (LUTS) related to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) in a contemporary 
series of male renal transplant (RTx) recipients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 150 consecutive transplant 
recipients at the University of Jena 12 months postoperatively for the presence 
and treatment of LUTS related to BPO.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 59 years (range 27 - 82 years). By 12 
months postoperatively, 91% (n = 137/150) were off dialysis with a functioning 
kidney graft. Two patients died during follow up. Six patients had undergone 
treatment for prostate cancer prior to RTx. Of the remaining 131 patients, 47% 
(n = 62/131) were considered as patients with BPO 12 months after RTx. Six 
percent (n = 8/131) of the patients experienced urinary retention due to BPO and 
6% (n = 8/131) had a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) during the 
first year after RTx. No major complications were observed in those patients. A 
significant increase was noted in the use of α-blocker therapy after RTx (P = 
0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: We observed a high prevalence of LUTS related to BPO in our cohort 
of patients. Due to the increasing age of transplant recipients, more attention 
should be paid to the evaluation and treatment of BPO prior to RTx.

Anomalous origin of the right pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta is a 
rare congenital deformity associated with poor quality of life and reduced life 
expectancy. Without a corrective surgery, less than one third of cases will live 
to see their sixth month. We report a case of a 10-month-old male child from 
Tanzania who presented with a 6-month history of recurrent respiratory tract 
infections, mild effort intolerance, and failure to thrive.

CONTEXT: Informal caregivers (ICs) are increasingly involved in the monitoring 
of symptoms during advanced cancer patients' treatment with palliative intent. A 
common but subjective symptom during this extended treatment phase is fatigue.
OBJECTIVES: This exploratory longitudinal study aimed to determine agreement 
between patients and ICs about patients' fatigue severity. In addition, 
predictors of agreement over time were studied.
METHODS: A sample of 107 patients with advanced cancer (life expectancy ≥ six 
months) and their ICs completed the subscale fatigue severity of the Checklist 
Individual Strength based on the patient's status at baseline and six months 
later. This eight-item subscale has a validated cutoff to determine the presence 
of clinically relevant levels of fatigue. ICs' own fatigue severity, strain, 
self-esteem, and relationship satisfaction were examined as predictors of 
agreement.
RESULTS: A total of 107 dyads completed measures at baseline and 69 dyads six 
months later. At baseline, ICs' significantly overestimated patients' fatigue 
severity (P < 0.001) with a moderate amount of bias (Cohen's d = 0.48). In 81 of 
the 107 dyads (76%), there was congruence about the presence or absence of 
severe fatigue. On a group level, congruence did not significantly change over 
time. On a dyad level, there was a tendency to either remain congruent or reach 
congruence. Next to baseline congruence, ICs' fatigue severity and strain 
predicted ICs' fatigue ratings (R(2) = 0.22).
CONCLUSION: Most ICs accurately predict presence or absence of clinically 
relevant levels of patients' fatigue. ICs' own fatigue severity and strain 
should be taken into account as they influence agreement.

CONTEXT: In 2010, California launched Partners for Children (PFC), a pediatric 
palliative care pilot program offering hospice-like services for children 
eligible for full-scope Medicaid delivered concurrently with curative care, 
regardless of the child's life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: We assessed the change from before PFC enrollment to the enrolled 
period in 1) health care costs per enrollee per month (PEPM), 2) costs by 
service type and diagnosis category, and 3) health care utilization (days of 
inpatient care and length of hospital stay).
METHODS: A pre-post analysis compared enrollees' health care costs and 
utilization up to 24 months before enrollment with their costs during 
participation in the pilot, from January 2010 through December 2012. Analyses 
were conducted using paid Medicaid claims and program enrollment data.
RESULTS: The average PEPM health care costs of program enrollees decreased by 
$3331 from before their participation in PFC to the enrolled period, driven by a 
reduction in inpatient costs of $4897 PEPM. PFC enrollees experienced a nearly 
50% reduction in the average number of inpatient days per month, from 4.2 to 
2.3. Average length of stay per hospitalization dropped from an average of 
16.7 days before enrollment to 6.5 days while in the program.
CONCLUSION: Through the provision of home-based therapeutic services, 24/7 
access to medical advice, and enhanced, personally tailored care coordination, 
PFC demonstrated an effective way to reduce costs for children with 
life-limiting conditions by moving from costly inpatient care to more 
coordinated and less expensive outpatient care. PFC's home-based care strategy 
is a cost-effective model for pediatric palliative care elsewhere.

After cervical spinal cord injury, the loss of upper limb function is common. 
This affects an individual's ability to perform activities of daily living and 
participate in previous life roles. There are surgical procedures that can 
restore some of the upper limb function lost after cervical spinal cord injury. 
Tendon transfer surgery has been performed in the tetraplegic population since 
the early 1970s. The goals of surgery are to provide a person with tetraplegia 
with active elbow extension, wrist extension (if absent), and sufficient pinch 
and/or grip strength to perform activities of daily living without the need for 
adaptive equipment or orthoses. These procedures are suitable for a specific 
group, usually with spinal cord impairment of C4-8, with explicit components of 
motor and sensory loss. Comprehensive team assessments of current functioning, 
environment, and personal circumstances are important to ensure success of any 
procedure. Rehabilitation after tendon transfer surgery involves immobilization 
for tendon healing followed by specific, targeted therapy based on motor 
learning and goal-orientated training. Outcomes of tendon transfer surgery are 
not limited to the improvements in an individual's strength, function, and 
performance of activities but have much greater life affects, especially with 
regard to well-being, employment, and participation. This article will provide 
an overview of the aims of surgery, preoperative assessment, common procedures, 
postoperative rehabilitation strategies, and outcomes based on clinical 
experience and international published literature.

OBJECTIVES: Compression of morbidity postulates that as the populations age, the 
age of onset of disease is postponed. The objective of this study is to test for 
evidence of compression of morbidity in Spain.
METHODS: We calculated the age and sex-specific incidence of myocardial 
infarction, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, as well as bladder, 
prostate, breast, lung, and colon cancer among hospital discharges covering 
99.5 % of the Spanish population, approximately 40 million inhabitants for two 
non-overlapping periods, 1997-2000 and 2007-2010, and estimated the length of 
life spent with disease using the Sullivan method.
RESULTS: We found that expansion of morbidity due to an earlier age-specific 
onset of incident disease and increase in life expectancy was the norm in Spain. 
Notable exceptions were cardiovascular disease in women (-0.2 % time spent with 
disease) and lung cancer for men (-0.9 % time spent with disease) from 1997-2000 
to 2007-2010.
CONCLUSIONS: Compression of morbidity is often cited by policy makers when 
discussing adjustments to the health-care system. If morbidity is measured by 
age at onset of disease, the burden of morbidity has increased in Spain.

BACKGROUND: Living-donor kidney transplantation has a positive influence on 
recipients' life expectancy and improves quality of life for patients with 
end-stage renal disease compared with dialysis patients. Evaluation of the 
physical and mental quality of life for donors can promote positive perceptions 
about donation and help potential donors in their decision-making process. The 
aim of this study was to explore the predictive factors of quality of life for 
living kidney donors.
METHODS: A cross-sectional and descriptive design was used, and the study was 
conducted from January to July 2013. The donors were a convenience sample of 34 
participants who had undergone kidney transplant surgery >1 year earlier.
RESULTS: The results showed that kidney donors had a low to moderate physical 
and mental quality of life. Multiple regression analysis revealed that financial 
concerns and anxiety explained 27.8% of the total variance of quality of life in 
the physical component. Anxiety and paid work explained 61.4% of the total 
variance of quality of life in the mental component.
CONCLUSIONS: After renal transplantation, living kidney donors experienced low 
to moderate quality of life. Because donors are family members (siblings, sons 
or daughters, spouses, or parents), monthly family income is a significant issue 
that influences both the decision to donate and quality of life after 
transplantation. Our findings suggest that pre-transplantation assessment must 
include social workers as part of the health care team to evaluate the impact of 
a donor's financial status on post-transplantation quality of life.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In Italy, the Italian Pharmaceutical Agency (AIFA) 
criteria used F3-F4 fibrosis stages as the threshold to prioritise the treatment 
with interferon (IFN)-free regimens, while in genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C (G1 
CHC) patients with fibrosis of liver stage 2, an approach with pegylated 
interferon (PEG-IFN)-based triple therapy with simeprevir was suggested. The key 
clinical question is whether, in an era of financial constraints, the 
application of a universal IFN-free strategy in naïve G1 CHC patients is 
feasible within a short time horizon. The aim of this study is to perform an 
economic analysis to estimate the cost-utility of the early innovative therapy 
in Italy for managing hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients.
METHODS: The incremental cost-utility analysis was carried out to quantify the 
benefits of the early treatment approach in HCV subjects. A Markov simulation 
model including direct and indirect costs and health outcomes was developed from 
an Italian National Healthcare Service and societal perspective. A total of 5000 
Monte Carlo simulations were performed on two distinct scenarios: standard of 
care (SoC) which includes 14,000 genotype 1 patients in Italy treated with 
innovative interferon-free regimens in the fibrosis of liver stages 3 and 4 
(F3-F4) versus early-treatment scenario (ETS) where 2000 patients were 
additionally treated with simeprevir plus PEG-IFN and ribavirin in the fibrosis 
stage 2 (F2) (based on Italian Medicines Agency AIFA reimbursement criteria). A 
systematic literature review was carried out to identify epidemiological and 
economic data, which were subsequently used to inform the model. Furthermore, a 
one-way probabilistic sensitivity was performed to measure the relationship 
between the main parameters of the model and the cost-utility results.
RESULTS: The model shows that, in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, ETS appeared to be the most 
cost-utility option compared with both perspective societal (ICER = EUR11,396) 
and NHS (ICER = EUR14,733) over a time period of 10 years. The cost-utility of 
ETS is more sustainable as it extends the time period analysis [ICER = EUR 6778 
per QALY to 20 years and EUR4474 per QALY to 30 years]. From the societal 
perspective, the ETS represents the dominant option at a time horizon of 
30 years. If we consider the sub-group population of treated patients [16,000 
patients of which 2000 not treated in the SoC, the ETS scenario was dominant 
after only 5 years and the cost-utility at 2 years of simulation. The one-way 
sensitivity analysis on the main variables confirmed the robustness of the model 
for the early-treatment approach.
CONCLUSION: Our model represents a tool for policy makers and health-care 
professionals, and provided information on the cost-utility of the 
early-treatment approach in HCV-infected patients in Italy. Starting innovative 
treatment regimens earlier keeps HCV-infected patients in better health and 
reduces the incidence of HCV-related events; generating a gain both in terms of 
health of the patients and correct resource allocation.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is considered a chronic medical 
condition. Several new drugs are available, including fixed-dose combination 
tablets, that have greatly simplified combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
regimens to treat HIV, while increasing the life-expectancy of infected 
individuals. In the last decade, multiple well-regarded studies have established 
the benefits of using ART in high-risk, HIV-negative persons to prevent HIV 
acquisition. The primary care provider must not only understand commonly 
encountered issues pertaining to ART, such as toxicities and drug interactions, 
but also needs to be aware of using ART for HIV prevention.

BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic patients with limited 
life expectancy may not be beneficial or cost-effective. The purpose of this 
study was to examine relationships among survival, outcomes, and costs within 2 
years following CEA among asymptomatic patients.
METHODS: Prospectively collected data from 3097 patients undergoing CEA for 
asymptomatic disease from Vascular Quality Initiative VQI registry were linked 
to Medicare. Models were used to identify predictors of 2-year mortality 
following CEA. Patients were classified as low, medium, or high risk of death 
based on this model. Next, we examined costs related to cerebrovascular care, 
occurrence of stroke, rehospitalization, and reintervention within 2 years 
following CEA across risk strata.
RESULTS: Overall, 2-year mortality was 6.7%. Age, diabetes, smoking, congestive 
heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal insufficiency, 
absence of statin use, and contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis 
were independently associated with a higher risk of death following CEA. 
In-hospital costs averaged $7500 among patients defined as low risk for death, 
and exceeded $10,800 among high risk patients. Although long-term costs related 
to cerebrovascular disease were 2 times higher in patients deemed high risk for 
death compared with low risk patents ($17,800 vs. $8800, P = 0.001), high risk 
of death was not independently associated with a high probability of high cost. 
Predictors of high cost at 2 years were severe contralateral ICA stenosis, 
dialysis dependence, and American Society for Anesthesia Class 4. Both statin 
use and CHF were protective of high cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Greater than 90% of patients undergoing CEA live long enough to 
realize the benefits of their procedure. Moreover, the long-term costs are 
supported by the effectiveness of this procedure at all levels of patient risk.

BACKGROUND: Optimum surgical intervention for low-grade haemorrhoids is unknown. 
Haemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) has been proposed as an efficacious, safe 
therapy while rubber band ligation (RBL) is a commonly used outpatient 
treatment. We compared recurrence after HAL versus RBL in patients with grade 
II-III haemorrhoids.
METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, parallel group, randomised controlled 
trial included patients from 17 acute UK NHS trusts. We screened patients aged 
18 years or older presenting with grade II-III haemorrhoids. We excluded 
patients who had previously received any haemorrhoid surgery, more than one 
injection treatment for haemorrhoids, or more than one RBL procedure within 3 
years before recruitment. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 
ratio) to either RBL or HAL with Doppler. Randomisation was computer-generated 
and stratified by centre with blocks of random sizes. Allocation concealment was 
achieved using a web-based system. The study was open-label with no masking of 
participants, clinicians, or research staff. The primary outcome was recurrence 
at 1 year, derived from the patient's self-reported assessment in combination 
with resource use from their general practitioner and hospital records. 
Recurrence was analysed in patients who had undergone one of the interventions 
and been followed up for at least 1 year. This study is registered with the 
ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN41394716.
FINDINGS: From Sept 9, 2012, to May 6, 2014, of 969 patients screened, 185 were 
randomly assigned to the HAL group and 187 to the RBL group. Of these 
participants, 337 had primary outcome data (176 in the RBL group and 161 in the 
HAL group). At 1 year post-procedure, 87 (49%) of 176 patients in the RBL group 
and 48 (30%) of 161 patients in the HAL group had haemorrhoid recurrence 
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2·23, 95% CI 1·42-3·51; p=0·0005). The main reason 
for this difference was the number of extra procedures required to achieve 
improvement (57 [32%] participants in the RBL group and 23 [14%] participants in 
the HAL group had a subsequent procedure for haemorrhoids). The mean pain 1 day 
after procedure was 3·4 (SD 2·8) in the RBL group and 4·6 (2·8) in the HAL group 
(difference -1·2, 95% CI -1·8 to -0·5; p=0·0002); at day 7 the scores were 1·6 
(2·3) in the RBL group and 3·1 (2·4) in the HAL group (difference -1·5, -2·0 to 
-1·0; p<0·0001). Pain scores did not differ between groups at 21 days and 6 
weeks. 15 individuals reported serious adverse events requiring hospital 
admission. One patient in the RBL group had a pre-existing rectal tumour. Of the 
remaining 14 serious adverse events, 12 (7%) were among participants treated 
with HAL and two (1%) were in those treated with RBL. Six patients had pain (one 
treated with RBL, five treated with HAL), three had bleeding not requiring 
transfusion (one treated with RBL, two treated with HAL), two in the HAL group 
had urinary retention, two in the HAL group had vasovagal upset, and one in the 
HAL group had possible sepsis (treated with antibiotics).
INTERPRETATION: Although recurrence after HAL was lower than a single RBL, HAL 
was more painful than RBL. The difference in recurrence was due to the need for 
repeat bandings in the RBL group. Patients (and health commissioners) might 
prefer such a course of RBL to the more invasive HAL.

The TEXT and SOFT trials concluded that an aromatase inhibitor (AI) with ovarian 
ablation (OA) yields a higher 5-year disease-free survival than tamoxifen alone 
in premenopausal ER+ high-risk early breast cancer. However, the long-term 
health consequences and costs of OA, either by GnRH agonist or oophorectomy, 
have not been evaluated. The objective was to conduct a cost-effectiveness 
analysis comparing tamoxifen to OA with AI. Markov Monte Carlo simulation model 
estimated the costs and benefits of 3 endocrine strategies: (1) tamoxifen; (2) 
GnRH agonist with AI (GnRHa-AI); (3) bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with AI 
(BSO-AI). Effectiveness was measured in life expectancy gain (years), and costs 
were averaged over a lifetime (USD 2015). Adverse events and deaths from each 
strategy were modeled in the United States population over a time horizon of 
40 years. For women without prior chemotherapy (low-risk), tamoxifen alone was 
more effective (18.03 years) and less costly ($1566) than GnRHa-AI (17.66 years, 
$93,692) or BSO-AI (17.63 years, $25,892). For those with prior chemotherapy 
(high-risk), BSO-AI was more costly but more effective (16.78 years, $25,368) 
than tamoxifen alone (16.55 years, $1523) with an ICER of $102,290, while 
GnRHa-AI yielded an ICER of $443,376. The simulation estimated 787 and 577 
deaths attributable to OA among 9320 high-risk women after BSO-AI and GnRHa-AI, 
respectively. There may be a role for ovarian ablation in premenopausal women 
with ER+ high-risk early breast cancer; however, this analysis raises concerns 
about the long-term health consequences of ovarian ablation and the potential 
effects on overall survival.

PURPOSE: To discuss whether the available standard methods for preclinical 
evaluation of posterior spine stabilization devices can represent basic everyday 
life activities and how to compare the results obtained with different 
procedures.
METHODS: A comparative finite element study compared ASTM F1717 and ISO 12189 
standards to validated instrumented L2-L4 segments undergoing standing, upper 
body flexion and extension. The internal loads on the spinal rod and the maximum 
stress on the implant are analysed.
RESULTS: ISO recommended anterior support stiffness and force allow for 
reproducing bending moments measured in vivo on an instrumented physiological 
segment during upper body flexion. Despite the significance of ASTM model from 
an engineering point of view, the overly conservative vertebrectomy model 
represents an unrealistic worst case scenario. A method is proposed to determine 
the load to apply on assemblies with different anterior support stiffnesses to 
guarantee a comparable bending moment and reproduce specific everyday life 
activities.
CONCLUSIONS: The study increases our awareness on the use of the current 
standards to achieve meaningful results easy to compare and interpret.

Cancer, the much dreaded name, is a multifactorial and genetically a difficult 
disease with less or so far no 100% cure available. Globally, it has become a 
major social concern and worsened the economical burden, with emergence of 
1,658,370 new cancer cases and 589,430 cancer deaths in the United States only 
in 2015. In India, the scenario is no better with high cancer prevalence of 
around 2.5 million incidences, with over 800,000 new cases occurring each year. 
By 2015, WHO has predicted estimated deaths by cancer to be 700,000. The 
increase could be accounted to urbanization, industrialization, hectic and 
unhealthy lifestyle, increased life expectancy and population growth. The 
current treatment regimes are becoming inefficacious due to tumor heterogeneity 
and increased resistance to drugs. Bioactive compounds from natural resources 
have revolutionized the arena of drug chemistry and rapid researches in in vitro 
and in vivo studies are encouraging. These natural therapeutic agents have 
therefore, become important for the development of multi- treatment strategies 
to be deployed in cancer therapy. The review summarizes the various 
chemopreventive and bioactive compounds isolated from several herbs which have 
become milestone in various kinds of tumor treatments. Also emphasis is led on 
including latest research data obtained from animal cell culture, animal models 
and preclinical trials studies conducted by scientists around the world to 
derive potential anti-tumorigenic agents. Finally, the review examines 
mechanisms of action of these compounds which will add to our existing knowledge 
and effort to serve and enhance the current chemotherapeutic protocols.

Despite the proven association between smoking and high rates of medical 
morbidity and reduced life expectancy in people with severe mental disorders 
(SMD), their smoking rates do not decline as they do in the general population. 
We carried out a non-randomized, open-label, prospective, 9-month follow-up 
multicentre trial to investigate the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability 
of a 12-week smoking cessation programme for patients with SMD in the community 
under real-world clinical conditions. Eighty-two adult outpatients with 
schizophrenic/bipolar disorder smoking ≥15 cigarettes/day were assigned by 
shared decision between doctors and patients to transdermal nicotine patches 
(TNP) [36(46.2%)] or varenicline [39(50%)]. Short-term efficacy: The 12-week 
7-day smoking cessation (self-reported cigarettes/day=0 and breath carbon 
monoxide levels≤9ppm) prevalence was 49.3%, without statistically significant 
differences between medications (TNP 50.0% vs varenicline 48.6%, 
chi-square=0.015, p=1.000). Long-term efficacy: At weeks 24 and 36, 41.3 and 
37.3% of patients were abstinent, with no statistically significant differences 
between treatments. Safety and Tolerability: no patients made suicide 
attempts/required hospitalization. There was no worsening on the psychometric 
scales. Patients significantly increased weight [TNP 1.1(2.8) vs varenicline 
2.5(3.3), p=0.063], without significant changes in vital signs/laboratory 
results, except significant decreases in alkaline phosphatase and low-density 
lipoprotein-cholesterol levels in the varenicline group. Patients under 
varenicline more frequently presented nausea/vomiting (p<0.0005), patients under 
TNP experienced skin reactions more frequently (p=0.002). Three patients under 
varenicline had elevated liver enzymes. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that 
in real-world clinical settings it is feasible and safe to help patients with 
stabilized severe mental disorders to quit smoking.

Once thought to be impossible, it is now clear that changing the activity of 
several conserved genetic pathways can lead to lifespan extension in 
experimental organisms. In humans, however, the goal is to extend healthspan, 
the functional and disease-free period of life. Are the current pathways to 
lifespan extension also improving healthspan?
