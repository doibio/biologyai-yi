liver-related deaths increased to 20-26% of deaths in each year and drug-related 
deaths decreased to 13-19%. Excluding drug-related causes of death, life 
expectancy was lowered by an average of 4.2 (SD ± 1.0) and 5.4 (SD ± 0.7) years 
for males and females, respectively. Among people with an HCV notification, an 
increasing proportion of deaths are liver-related. Following removal of 
drug-related mortality, life expectancy in this population remained considerably 
lower, compared with the general population.

guttata).

Maternal effects provide a mechanism to adapt offspring phenotype and optimize 
the mother's fitness to current environmental conditions. Transferring steroids 
to the yolk is one way mothers can translate environmental information into 
potential adaptive signals for offspring. However, maternally-derived hormones 
might also have adverse effects for offspring. For example, recent data in zebra 
finch chicks suggested that ageing related-processes (i.e. oxidative stress and 
telomere loss) were increased after egg-injection of corticosterone (CORT). 
Still, we have few experimental data describing the effect of maternal effects 
on the growth-ageing trade-off in offspring. Here, we chronically treated 
pre-laying zebra finch females (Taeniopygia guttata) with 17-β-estradiol (E2) or 
CORT, and followed offspring growth and cellular ageing rates (oxidative stress 
and telomere loss). CORT treatment decreased growth rate in male chicks and 
increased rate of telomere loss in mothers and female offspring. E2 increased 
body mass gain in male offspring, while reducing oxidative stress in both sexes 
but without affecting telomere loss. Since shorter telomeres were previously 
found to be a proxy of individual lifespan in zebra finches, maternal effects 
may, through pleiotropic effects, be important determinants of offspring 
life-expectancy by modulating ageing rate during embryo and post-natal growth.

BACKGROUND: This prospective multicenter study aimed to study the impact of the 
recalibration component of response-shift (RS) on time to deterioration (TTD) in 
health related quality of life (QoL) scores in breast cancer (BC) patients and 
the influence of baseline QoL expectations on TTD.
METHODS: The EORTC-QLQ-C30 and BR-23 questionnaires were used to assess the QoL 
in a prospective multicenter study at inclusion (T0), at the end of the first 
hospitalization (T1) and, three (T2) and 6 months after the first 
hospitalization (T3). Recalibration was investigated by the then-test method. 
QoL expectancy was assessed at diagnosis. Deterioration was defined as a 5-point 
decrease in QoL scores, considered a minimal clinically important difference 
(MCID). TTD was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression analyses 
were used to identify factors influencing TTD.
RESULTS: From February 2006 to February 2008, 381 women were included. 
Recalibration of breast cancer patients' internal standards in the assessment of 
their QoL had an impact on TTD. Median TTD were significantly shorter when 
recalibration was not taken into account than when recalibration was taken into 
account for global health, role-functioning, social-functioning, body-image and 
side effects of systemic therapy. Cox multivariate analyses showed that for body 
image, when recalibration was taken into account, radiotherapy was associated 
with a shorter TTD (HR: 0.60[0.38-0.94], whereas, no significant impact of 
surgery type on TTD was observed. For global health, cognitive and social 
functioning dimensions, patients expecting a deterioration in their QoL at 
baseline had a significantly shorter TTD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that RS and baseline QoL expectations were 
associated with time to deterioration in breast cancer patients.

Health-related quality of life after myocardial infarction, does choice of 
method make a difference?

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) scores obtained from the instrument Short Form (SF)-36 through the 
so-called SF-6D utilities, and those obtained from 15D, in patients with 
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and to evaluate the consequences in 
estimation of quality adjusted life years (QALYs).
DESIGN: This was a sub-study of the Norwegian District Treatment of STEMI, in 
which patients with STEMI treated with tenecteplase, were randomized to early 
angioplasty or standard management (n = 266). HRQoL data were collected at all 
visits (0, 1, 3, 7 and 12 months). All patients with complete data were included 
(n = 248).
RESULTS: The score range was 0.33-1.0 for SF-6D and 0.49-1.0 for 15D. Mean 
utility scores from 15D were higher and had different distribution compared to 
scores from SF-6D. Mean QALY for the whole group was higher using 15D than SF-6D 
(0.89 vs. 0.77). The incremental number of QALYs with early angioplasty compared 
to standard treatment was 0.005 (95% CI: - 0.018 to 0.028) using SF-6D, and 
0.004 (95% CI: - 0.010 to 0.018) using the 15D instrument.
CONCLUSIONS: Choice of instrument may influence HRQoL scores, but not 
necessarily the gain in QALYs.

Health ‡Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX.

BACKGROUND: Cancer screening in individuals with limited life expectancy 
increases the risk of diagnosis and treatment of cancer that otherwise would not 
have become clinically apparent.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate screening mammography use in women with limited life 
expectancy, its geographic variation, and association with access to primary 
care and mammographic resources.
METHODS: We assessed screening mammography use in 2008-2009 in 106,737 women 
aged 66 years or older with an estimated life expectancy of <7 years using a 5% 
national sample of Medicare beneficiaries. Descriptive statistics were used to 
estimate the screening mammography utilization, by access to primary care.
RESULTS: Among women with a life expectancy of <7 years, 28.5% received 
screening mammography during 2008-2009. The screening rates were 34.6% versus 
20.5% for women with and without an identifiable primary care physician, 
respectively. The screening rates were higher among women who saw >1 generalist 
physician and who had more visits to generalist physicians. There was 
substantial geographic variation across the United States, with an average rate 
of 39.5% in the hospital referral regions (HRRs) in the top decile of screening 
versus 19.5% in the HRRs in the bottom decile. The screening rates were higher 
among HRRs with more primary care physicians (r=0.14, P=0.02), mammography 
facilities (r=0.12, P=0.04), and radiologists (r=0.22, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Substantial proportions of women with limited life expectancy 
receive screening mammography. Results presented sound a cautionary note that 
greater access to primary care and mammographic resources is also associated 
with higher overuse.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of specialized multidisciplinary 
tinnitus treatment based on cognitive behavioral therapy, compared with care as 
usual.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial including an economic evaluation from a 
health-care and societal perspective, using a one-year time horizon.
SETTING: Audiologic center.
PATIENTS: A referred sample of 626 patients with tinnitus were eligible for 
participation. Approximately 492 patients were included in the study. Eighty-six 
(35%) of 247 patients in the usual care group, and 74 (30%) of 245 patients in 
the specialized care group were lost to follow-up by month 12.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as measured with the 
Health Utilities Index Mark III and cost in US dollars.
RESULTS: Compared with patients receiving usual care, patients who received 
specialized care gained on average 0.015 QALYs (95% bootstrapped confidence 
interval [BCI], -0.03 to 0.06). The incremental costs from a societal 
perspective are $357 (95% BCI,-$1,034 to $1,785). The incremental cost per QALY 
from a societal perspective amounted to $24,580. The probability that SC is 
cost-effective from a societal perspective is 58% for a willingness to pay for a 
QALY of $45,000.
CONCLUSION: Specialized multidisciplinary tinnitus treatment based on cognitive 
behavioral therapy is cost-effective as compared with usual care. Although 
uncertainty surrounding the incremental costs and effects is considerable, 
sensitivity analysis indicated that cost-effectiveness results were robust.

Medical Sciences, Tehran , Iran.

BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC), as the prototype of inflammatory bowel 
disease of the large bowel, is increasing in Iran and other developing 
countries. There are few studies that discuss the properties of this disease 
Iran. The result of this review may provide a general consensus about the 
epidemiological features of UC in Iran.
METHODS: This was a qualitative, systematic review that investigated the 
incidence, prevalence, and demographic properties of UC in Iran. We evaluated 
all published studies in the PubMed database, IranMedex, Magiran, and Scientific 
Information Database (SID) that pertained to the epidemiology and demographic 
features of UC in Iran from January 1987 to January 2012. After searching with 
defined keywords and implementing the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 11 case 
series and 2 case-control studies fulfilled the criteria for inclusion.
RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of UC is 15 per 105 persons, and the reported 
incidences were 3.04 and 3.25 per 105 persons in two Iranian provinces. The 
disease was more commonly observed in women and people in their fourth decade of 
life. Cigarette smoking conferred protection and familial association seemed to 
be similar to developed countries. UC did not appear to be more common among the 
higher socioeconomic class. In addition the proximal colon and rectum were less 
commonly involved.
CONCLUSION: Although the data is limited, the prevalence and incidence of UC in 
Iran shows an increasing pattern similar to other countries in the region. There 
is no clear association with socioeconomic status. Milder forms of the disease 
are common in Iran. A comprehensive nationwide data bank is needed for a better 
definition of the disease characteristics.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The autosomal dominant TRPV4 disorders (previously 
considered to be clinically distinct phenotypes before their molecular basis was 
discovered) are now grouped into neuromuscular disorders and skeletal 
dysplasias; however, the overlap within each group is considerable. Affected 
individuals typically have either neuromuscular or skeletal manifestations 
alone, and in only rare instances an overlap syndrome has been reported. The 
three autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorders (mildest to most severe) are: 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2C. Scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy. 
Congenital distal spinal muscular atrophy. The autosomal dominant neuromuscular 
disorders are characterized by a congenital-onset, static, or later-onset 
progressive peripheral neuropathy with variable combinations of laryngeal 
dysfunction (i.e., vocal fold paresis), respiratory dysfunction, and joint 
contractures. The six autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasias (mildest to most 
severe) are: Familial digital arthropathy-brachydactyly. Autosomal dominant 
brachyolmia. Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Kozlowski type. Spondyloepiphyseal 
dysplasia, Maroteaux type. Parastremmatic dysplasia. Metatropic dysplasia. The 
skeletal dysplasia is characterized by brachydactyly (in all 6); the five that 
are more severe have short stature that varies from mild to severe with 
progressive spinal deformity and involvement of the long bones and pelvis. In 
the mildest of the autosomal dominant TRPV4 disorders life span is normal; in 
the most severe it is shortened. Bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing 
loss (SNHL) can occur with both autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorders and 
skeletal dysplasias.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of an autosomal dominant TRPV4 disorder is 
established in a proband with characteristic clinical and neurophysiologic 
findings, radiographic findings in the skeletal dysplasias, and a heterozygous 
TRPV4 pathogenic variant identified on molecular genetic testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is focused on symptom 
management. Affected individuals are often evaluated and managed by a 
multidisciplinary team that may include neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic 
surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists. SNHL is managed by 
specialists to determine the best management options. For neuromuscular 
disorders, neuropathy and respiratory dysfunction are managed in a routine 
manner; individuals with laryngeal dysfunction require ENT evaluation that 
should include speech therapy, laryngoscopy, and, in some instances, surgery. 
For skeletal dysplasias, physical therapy/exercise and heel-cord stretching to 
maintain function; surgical intervention when kyphoscoliosis compromises 
pulmonary function and/or causes pain and/or when upper cervical spine 
instability and/or cervical myelopathy are present. Surveillance: For 
neuromuscular disorders, annual neurologic examinations, physical therapy 
assessments, ENT monitoring of laryngeal function, dynamic breathing chest 
x-ray, and hearing assessment. For skeletal dysplasias, annual evaluation for 
joint pain and scoliosis; assessment for odontoid hypoplasia before a child 
reaches school age and before surgical procedures involving general anesthesia; 
annual hearing assessment. Agents/circumstances to avoid: For neuromuscular 
disorders, obesity, as it makes walking more difficult; diabetes; medications 
that are toxic or potentially toxic to persons with a peripheral neuropathy. For 
skeletal dysplasias, extreme neck flexion and extension (in those with odontoid 
hypoplasia); activities that place undue stress on the spine and weight-bearing 
joints. Pregnancy management: Ideally a woman with TRPV4 disorder would seek 
consultation from a high-risk OB-GYN or maternal-fetal medicine specialist to 
evaluate risk associated with pregnancy and delivery.
GENETIC COUNSELING: TRPV4 disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant 
manner. Most individuals diagnosed with an autosomal dominant TRPV4 disorder 
have an affected parent. However, since the most severe skeletal phenotypes can 
be lethal in childhood (or in utero), children with these phenotypes likely have 
a de novo pathogenic variant and unaffected parents. Each child of an individual 
with an autosomal dominant TRPV4 disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the 
pathogenic variant. Specific phenotype, age of onset, and disease severity 
cannot be predicted accurately because of reduced penetrance and variable 
expressivity. However, in general, a child who inherits a TRPV4 pathogenic 
variant associated with neuromuscular disease or skeletal dysplasia from an 
affected parent is likely to have the same phenotype as the parent. Prenatal and 
preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variant has been 
identified in an affected family member.

Glutaredoxins (Grx) are small proteins, conserved throughout all the kingdoms of 
life, which are engaged in a wide variety of biological processes. According to 
the number of cysteines in their active site, Grx are classified as dithiolic or 
monothiolic (1-C-Grx). In most organisms, 1-C-Grx are implicated in iron-sulfur 
cluster (FeS) metabolism and utilize glutathione as cofactor. Trypanosomatids 
are parasitic protozoa of the order Kinetoplastida, which cause severe diseases 
in humans and domestic animals. These parasites exploit a unique thiol-dependent 
redox system based on bis(glutathionyl)spermidine (trypanothione) rather than on 
glutathione. Mitochondrial 1-C-Grx1 from trypanosomes differs from orthologues 
in several features including the use of trypanothione as ligand for FeS binding 
and the presence of a parasite-specific N-terminal extension. We have recently 
shown that 1-C-Grx1 from Trypanosoma brucei is indispensable for parasite 
survival in mouse, making this protein a potential drug target candidate against 
trypanosomiasis. However, structural information for the full-length form of 
1-C-Grx1 is still lacking. Here, we report the NMR resonance assignment of the 
mature form of Tb1-C-Grx1 including an N-terminal tail, paving the way to 
disclose the role of this intrinsically disordered region in the protein 
function.

BACKGROUND: Social deprivation is associated with a greater morbidity and 
shorter life expectancy. This study evaluates differences in weight loss 
following bariatric surgery and deprivation, based on UK deprivation measures in 
a London bariatric centre.
METHODS: All patients undergoing bariatric surgery between 2002 and 2012 were 
retrospectively identified. Demographic details, type of surgery and percentage 
excess weight loss data were collected. UK Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD, 
2010) and IMD domain of the Health Deprivation and Disability (HDD) scores were 
used to assess deprivation (where 1 is the most deprived in rank order and 
32,482 is the least deprived). Two-way between-subjects analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) was performed to examine the effect of IMD score, deprivation, procedure 
type and gender on percentage excess weight loss.
RESULTS: Data were included from 983 patients (178 male, 805 female) involving 
3,663 patient episodes. Treatments comprised laparoscopic gastric bands (n=533), 
gastric bypass (n=362) and gastric balloons (n=88). The average percentage 
excess weight loss across all procedures was 38 % over a follow-up period (3 
months-9 years). There was no correlation between weight loss and IMD/HDD rank 
scores. Gastric bypass was significantly more effective at achieving weight loss 
than the other two procedures at 3-, 6- and 9-month and 1-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Social deprivation does not influence weight loss after bariatric 
surgery, suggesting that all socioeconomic groups may equally benefit from 
surgical intervention. Social deprivation should not therefore negatively 
influence the decision for surgical intervention in these patients.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the change of life expectancy (LE) among residents of 
Fujian province over the past two decade and to evaluate the impact of age and 
causes of death on the differences related to LE.
METHODS: Mortality data from Causes of Death Surveillance System of Ministry of 
Health in Fujian province during 1990-2010 were used to calculate the life 
expectancy, and Arriaga decomposition method was applied to quantitatively 
evaluate its changes, based on the age-specific and cause-specific mortality.
RESULTS: The LE in urban and rural residents of Fujian province had an increase 
of 5.82 and 11.67 years during the past two decade, respectively, which were 
higher in urban residents than in rural residents. Although the increment of LE 
was higher in rural populations than in urban population, the difference of LE 
between urban and rural was seen narrowed. The contribution rate of children on 
LE was reducing and the contribution rate of children below 14 years old to LE 
in rural resident declined from 78.29% to 31.23%. Middle age and elderly 
populations had become the major ones that causing the change of LE. The impact 
of cancer, respiratory diseases and cerebrovascular diseases on LE in urban 
residents was reducing, while the influence of infectious disease, nervous 
system disease and cardiac disease was increasing, causing the LE of urban 
resident increased 1.54,0.67 and 0.49 years, respectively. The impact of 
respiratory diseases, digestive system diseases, as well as injury and poisoning 
on LE in the rural residents was reducing, while the effect of cancer, 
cerebrovascular and cardiac disease increased, causing the LE in the rural 
resident increased 1.23 years. Different causes of death had different impact on 
the LE in each age group.
CONCLUSION: To reduce the mortality rate in the middle-aged and elderly 
population and to control the incidence of non-communicable diseases could help 
to improve the LE in the residents of Fujian province.

OBJECTIVES: To conduct an economic evaluation of the currently prescribed 
treatments for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation (NVAF) including warfarin, aspirin, and novel oral anticoagulants 
(NOACs) from a French payer perspective.
METHODS: A previously published Markov model was adapted in accordance to the 
new French guidelines of the Commission for Economic Evaluation and Public 
Health (CEESP), to adopt the recommended efficiency frontier approach. A cohort 
of patients with NVAF eligible for stroke preventive treatment was simulated 
over lifetime. Clinical events modeled included strokes, systemic embolism, 
intracranial hemorrhage, other major bleeds, clinically relevant non-major 
bleeds, and myocardial infarction. Efficacy and bleeding data for warfarin, 
apixaban, and aspirin were obtained from ARISTOTLE and AVERROES trials, whilst 
efficacy data for other NOACs were from published indirect comparisons. Acute 
medical costs were obtained from a dedicated analysis of the French national 
hospitalization database (PMSI). Long-term medical costs and utility data were 
derived from the literature. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were performed to assess the robustness of the model projections.
RESULTS: Warfarin and apixaban were the two optimal treatment choices, as the 
other five treatment strategies including aspirin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 
in sequential dosages, dabigatran 150 mg, and rivaroxaban were strictly 
dominated on the efficiency frontier. Further, apixaban was a cost-effective 
alternative vs warfarin with an incremental cost of €2314 and an incremental 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of 0.189, corresponding to an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €12,227/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban may be the most economically efficient alternative to 
warfarin in NVAF patients eligible for stroke prevention in France. All other 
strategies were dominated, yielding apixaban as a less costly yet more effective 
treatment alternative. As formally requested by the CEESP, these results need to 
be verified in a French clinical setting using stroke reduction and bleeding 
safety observed in real-life patient cohorts using these anticoagulants.

with varenicline for smoking cessation? A systematic review and economic 
evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide. 
Nearly one-fifth of adults in the UK regularly smoke cigarettes. The ill-health 
associated with smoking costs the NHS over £3B every year. A number of 
pharmacological interventions are available that can help people to quit 
smoking. These include nicotinic receptor partial agonists such as varenicline 
or cytisine. Varenicline is a synthetic product licensed for use in the UK, 
while cytisine is derived naturally from the seeds of the plant Cytisus 
laborinum L. (golden rain acacia).
OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence on the clinical effectiveness and safety of 
cytisine from smoking cessation compared with varenicline; to develop an 
economic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of cytisine and varenicline; 
and to provide recommendations based on value of information analyses as to 
whether or not a head-to-head trial of cytisine and varenicline would represent 
effective use of resources.
DATA SOURCES: Efficacy and adverse events data were sourced from a recent 
Cochrane review. These data were supplemented with an updated search of twelve 
electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature and The Cochrane Library, for the period from December 
2011 to January 2013. The review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 
adult smokers attempting to quit using varenicline or cytisine. Further 
interventions were considered (placebo, nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion) 
to allow an indirect comparison between varenicline and cytisine. The primary 
outcome was abstinence at a minimum of 6 months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes 
were common adverse events such as abnormal dreams, headache, nausea, insomnia 
and serious adverse events.
REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of the clinical 
evidence was undertaken. A random-effects model was used to allow for 
heterogeneity between studies. The economic model structure was based on a 
published model. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to estimate 
the treatment expected to be most cost-effective given current information. 
Formal expected value of perfect information, perfect partial information and of 
sample information were performed.
RESULTS: Twenty-three (RCTs) were included in the systematic review, comprising 
a total of 10,610 participants. Twenty-one trials of varenicline of differing 
dosing schedules and two trials of cytisine at standard dose met the inclusion 
criteria. No head-to-head trials comparing varenicline with cytisine were 
identified. The methodological quality of the studies was judged to be moderate 
to good. Cytisine was more efficacious than placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 4.27, 95% 
credible interval (CrI) 2.05 to 10.05], as was standard-dose varenicline (HR 
2.58, 95% Crl 2.16 to 3.15). Standard-dose varenicline treatment was associated 
with significantly higher rates of headache, insomnia and nausea than placebo; 
there was no significant difference in the rates of abnormal dreams. There were 
no significant differences in the rates of headache or nausea between cytisine 
and placebo; data were identified for neither abnormal dreams nor insomnia. 
Using expected values, cytisine is anticipated to dominate varenicline, in that 
it produces more quality-adjusted life-years at a lower associated cost. This 
occurred in approximately 90% of the scenarios performed. However, owing to the 
large number of people who wish to quit smoking (estimated to be 3 million over 
a 10-year period), the implications of making an incorrect decision is large. 
The expected value of sample information indicated that conducting a 
head-to-head trial of cytisine and varenicline was worthwhile, and that 1000 
smokers per arm was an appropriate number to recruit.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the evidence included in this review, varenicline 
and cytisine are both effective interventions to aid smoking cessation when 
compared with placebo. Cytisine is estimated to be both more clinically 
effective and cost-effective than varenicline. However, there is uncertainty in 
the decision, and a head-to-head trial of cytisine and varenicline would appear 
to be an effective use of resources.

Are healthcare expenditures increasing faster for the elderly than the rest of 
the population?

1089 Blindern, 0317 Oslo, Norway.

The debate about whether health expenditures will increase more or less for the 
old is conceptually confused because the participants focus on different 
factors, use different assumptions and, finally, do not connect the predictions 
to more general theories of demand for health services. Some focus on increases 
in life expectancy and how this will change the distribution of end-of-life 
costs. Others focus on how changes in income and technology will affect the 
relationship between age and health spending. Higher income, and a larger share 
of the population, will make it more profitable to invest in treatments aimed at 
old people, which will lead to steepening in some age groups, but a flattening 
in other age groups.

BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural effusion is associated with short life expectancy 
and significant morbidity. A randomized controlled trial comparing indwelling 
pleural catheters (IPCs) with talc pleurodesis found that IPCs reduced 
in-hospital time and the need for additional procedures but were associated with 
excess adverse events.
METHODS: Using data from the clinical trial, we compared costs associated with 
use of IPCs and with talc pleurodesis. Resource use and adverse events were 
captured through case report forms over the 1-year trial follow-up. Costs for 
outpatient and inpatient visits, diagnostic imaging, nursing, and doctor time 
were obtained from the UK National Health Service reference costs and University 
of Kent's Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2011 and inflated to 2013 using 
the UK Consumer Price Index. Procedure supply costs were obtained from the 
manufacturer. Difference in mean costs was compared using nonparametric 
bootstrapping. All costs were converted to US dollars using the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development Purchasing Power Parity Index.
RESULTS: Overall mean cost (SD) for managing patients with IPCs and talc 
pleurodesis was $4,993 ($5,529) and $4,581 ($4,359), respectively. The 
incremental mean cost difference was $401, with 95% CI of -$1,387 to $2,261. The 
mean cost related to ongoing drainage in the IPC group was $1,011 ($732) vs $57 
($213) in the talc pleurodesis group (P = .001). This included the cost of 
drainage bottles, dressing changes in the first month, and catheter removal. 
There was no significant difference in cost of the initial intervention or 
adverse events between the groups. For patients with survival < 14 weeks, IPC is 
significantly less costly than talc pleurodesis, with mean cost difference of 
-$1,719 (95% CI, -$3,376 to -$85).
CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference in the mean cost of managing 
patients with IPCs compared with talc pleurodesis. For patients with limited 
survival, IPC appears less costly.

Challenges to time trade-off utility assessment methods: when should you 
consider alternative approaches?

Boye KS(1), Matza LS, Feeny DH, Johnston JA, Bowman L, Jordan JB.

2142, Indianapolis, IN, USA.

In recent years, the time trade-off (TTO) method, most commonly with a 10-year 
time horizon, has been the most frequently used approach for direct health state 
utility assessment, likely due to National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) preference for comparability with the EQ-5D, which has a 
utility scoring algorithm derived via this method. Although comparability to 
previous utility studies is important, there are situations when the TTO method 
may not be appropriate. The purpose of the current review is to highlight 
challenges to the TTO method. Five challenges to the TTO method are discussed: 
mild health states, small differences among health states, temporary health 
states, pediatric health states, and assessment of samples with particular 
characteristics. Some of these challenges are associated with the 10-year time 
horizon, while other situations may raise issues for TTO methods regardless of 
the time horizon. Alternative approaches for valuing health states are 
suggested.

DiMaggio and Guohua Li are also with the Department of Anesthesiology, College 
of Physicians and Surgeons, and the Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a package of roadway 
modifications in New York City funded under the Safe Routes to School (SRTS) 
program.
METHODS: We used a Markov model to estimate long-term impacts of SRTS on injury 
reduction and the associated savings in medical costs, lifelong disability, and 
death. Model inputs included societal costs (in 2013 US dollars) and observed 
spatiotemporal changes in injury rates associated with New York City's 
implementation of SRTS relative to control intersections. Structural changes to 
roadways were assumed to last 50 years before further investment is required. 
Therefore, costs were discounted over 50 consecutive cohorts of modified roadway 
users under SRTS.
RESULTS: SRTS was associated with an overall net societal benefit of $230 
million and 2055 quality-adjusted life years gained in New York City.
CONCLUSIONS: SRTS reduces injuries and saves money over the long run.

Transferability of results of cost utility analyses for biologicals in 
inflammatory conditions for Central and Eastern European countries.

Budapest, 1093, Hungary, laszlo.gulacsi@uni-corvinus.hu.

BACKGROUND: Several Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries require 
cost-utility analyses (CUAs) to support reimbursement formulary listing. 
However, CUAs informed by local evidence are often unavailable, and the 
cost-effectiveness of the several currently reimbursed biologicals is unclear.
AIM: To estimate the cost-effectiveness as multiples of per capita GDP/quality 
adjusted life years (QALY) of four biologicals (infliximab, etanercept, 
adalimumab, golimumab) currently reimbursed in six CEE countries in six 
inflammatory rheumatoid and bowel disease conditions.
METHODS: Systematic literature review of published cost-utility analyses in the 
selected conditions, using the United Kingdom (UK) as reference country and with 
study selection criteria set to optimize the transfer of results to the CEEs. 
Prices in each CEE country were pro-rated against UK prices using purchasing 
power parity (PPP)-adjusted per capita GDP, and local GDP per capita/QALY ratios 
estimated.
RESULTS: Central and Eastern European countries list prices were 144-333% higher 
than pro rata prices. Out of 85 CUAs identified by previous systematic 
literature reviews, 15 were selected as a convenience sample for estimating the 
cost-effectiveness of biologicals in the CEE countries in terms of per capita 
GDP/QALY. Per capita GDP/QALY values varied from 0.42 to 6.4 across countries 
and conditions (Bulgaria: 0.97-6.38; Czech Republic: 0.42-2.76; Hungary: 
0.54-3.54; Poland: 0.59-3.90; Romania: 0.77-5.07; Slovakia: 0.55-3.61).
CONCLUSION: While results must be interpreted with caution, calculating pro rata 
(cost-effective) prices and per capita GDP/QALY ratios based on CUAs can aid 
reimbursement decision-making in the absence of analyses using local data.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse change in the health status of 
the population in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) since 1990, 
compared with the 'old' EU-15 member states of the European Union (EU).
METHODS: We analysed data from the Health for All Database and the Global Burden 
of Disease report of the World Health Organization (WHO). Life expectancy at 
birth and disability-adjusted life years were analysed for 1990-2010. 
Age-standardised death rates (ASDR) and potential years of life lost (PYLL) were 
assessed for selected inflammatory diseases.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth for male individuals improved in CEE by 4.8 
years and in the EU-15 by 5.4 years. During the same period, life expectancy at 
birth for female individuals improved in CEE by 4.0 years and in the EU-15 by 
4.2 years. The difference in life expectancy at birth between male and female 
individuals in the EU-15 decreased by 1.2 years and in CEE by 0.8 years. 
Comparisons of ASDR and PYLL among the EU-15 and CEE countries were difficult 
because of the potentially low validity of the available data.
CONCLUSIONS: The health status of the CEE population has improved since 1990. 
However, only a few countries have closed the gap with the EU-15 countries. 
Inflammatory conditions might represent a significant disease burden in CEE 
countries; however, a thorough analysis and comparison to the EU-15 is difficult 
because of a shortage of good-quality data.

A patient-centered vision of care for ESRD: dialysis as a bridging treatment or 
as a final destination?

Comment in
    J Am Soc Nephrol. 2014 Aug;25(8):1609-11.

The ESRD population is heterogeneous, including patients without severe 
comorbidity for whom dialysis is a bridge to transplantation or a long-term 
maintenance treatment, as well as patients with a limited life expectancy as a 
result of advanced age or severe comorbidity for whom dialysis will be the final 
treatment destination. The complex medical and social context of this latter 
group fits poorly in the homogeneous, disease-centered, and process-driven 
approach of many clinical practice guidelines for dialysis. In this commentary, 
we argue that the standards of treatment allocated to each individual patient 
should be defined not merely by his or her disease state, but also by his or her 
preferences and prognosis. In this more patient-centered approach, three 
attainable treatment goals with a corresponding therapeutic approach could be 
defined: (1) dialysis as bridging or long-term maintenance treatment, (2) 
dialysis as final treatment destination, and (3) active medical management 
without dialysis. For patients with a better overall prognosis, this approach 
will emphasize complication prevention and long-term survival. For patients with 
a limited overall prognosis, strictly disease-centered interventions often 
impose a treatment burden that does not translate into a proportional 
improvement in quantity or quality of life. For these patients, a 
patient-centered approach will place more emphasis on palliative management 
strategies that are less disease specific.

During the early vertebrate body plan formation, convergent extension (CE) of 
dorsal mesoderm and neurectoderm is coordinated by the evolutionarily conserved 
non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling. Disheveled (Dvl), a key mediator of Wnt/PCP 
signaling, is essential for the medial-lateral polarity formation in the cells 
undergoing convergent extension movements. NEDD4L, a highly conserved HECT type 
E3 ligase, has been reported to regulate the stability of multiple substrates 
including Dvl2. Here we demonstrate that NEDD4L is required for the cellular 
polarity formation and convergent extension in the early Xenopus embryos. 
Depletion of NEDD4L in early Xenopus embryos results in the loss of mediolateral 
polarity of the convergent-extending mesoderm cells and the shortened body axis, 
resembling those defects caused by the disruption of non-canonical Wnt 
signaling. Depletion of xNEDD4L also blocks the elongation of the animal 
explants in response to endogenous mesoderm inducing signals and partially 
compromises the expression of Brachyury. Importantly, reducing Dvl2 expression 
can largely rescue the cellular polarity and convergent extension defects in 
NEDD4L-depleted embryos and explants. Together with the data that NEDD4L reduces 
Dvl2 protein expression in the frog embryos, our findings suggest that 
regulation of Dvl protein levels by NEDD4L is essential for convergent extension 
during early Xenopus embryogenesis.
