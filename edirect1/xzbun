Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common and complex genetic disorder that 
develops under varying degrees of hyperandrogenemic and hyperinsulinemic 
conditions that cause phenotypic variability ranging from mild hirsutism to 
anovulation and infertility. In addition to increased risk of reproductive 
disability, PCOS is associated with metabolic diseases including type 2 
diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. Similar prevalence rates and 
shared genetic susceptibility of PCOS among different populations suggest that 
genetic risk factors were already present in the ancestors of humans. 
Contemporary human genetic studies inform us that the origin of human ancestors 
is from Africa. Sharing common susceptibility loci between Chinese and European 
ancestry suggests that PCOS may have persisted for more than 50,000 years, 
before the migration of humans out of Africa. Although PCOS is the most common 
cause of anovulatory infertility, its high prevalence is still a paradox. From 
an evolutionary perspective, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying PCOS might be 
candidate factors for survival advantage of the human being. Former compensatory 
advantageous factors may become pathogenic mechanisms underlying complex 
metabolic disease with prolonged life expectancy and transition to sedentary 
lifestyle.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of patients with disorders of consciousness 
(DOCs) is ever-increasing, but little is known about their clinical course over 
late stages. Several issues (premorbid conditions, complications and pressure 
sores) are to be considered for their effect on clinical outcome, risk of death 
and recovery of functional performance. Unfortunately, in late stages of 
long-term rehabilitation, these aspects are still more neglected than in acute 
and postacute stages. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical 
course and the complications of patients in the late stages of DOCs and to 
explore the relationship between mortality and specific biomarkers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 112 patients, admitted over 10 years in a 
dedicated ward, were retrospectively studied. Sociodemographic data, 
preadmission and inpatient clinical features were collected. Disability Rating 
Scale scores, complications including pressure sores and blood markers were 
assessed monthly. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics and 
correlations using SPSS.
RESULTS: Most patients were men older than 50 years with a nontraumatic etiology 
and a history of hypertension (42.86%). The most common complication was 
pneumonia (76.79%). No association was found between sex and mortality or 
between etiology and mortality (P > 0.05). Mortality correlated significantly 
with sepsis (ρ = 0.253), albumin (ρ = -0.558), hemoglobin (ρ = -0.354) and white 
blood cells (ρ = 0.243). Only 42% of patients remained unchanged at Disability 
Rating Scale evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS: These data confirmed that DOCs are not static conditions and they 
require ongoing monitoring and assessment of clinical status, level of 
consciousness and laboratory biomarkers.

Background: In the last year of life, persons with advanced cancer and their 
significant others are affected by several transitions. They perform 
psychological adjustment processes during transformation. This requires 
strategies for patients and their significant others. Research in German about 
this theme is missing. Aim: We explored the experiences with illness management 
during transitions in the last year of life of patients with advanced cancer and 
their significant others. Method: In this qualitative study, we conducted 
structured interviews with five dyads, consisting of persons with Karnofsky 
Index ≥ 60 % and life expectancy of six to twelve months as well as their 
significant others. To interpret the interviews, we used qualitative content 
analysis according to Mayring. Results: The main theme “Don't let the world 
become too small” expresses that limitations diminished the lifeworld and the 
participants struggled against this process. This is revealed in three 
categories: “Being shocked by diagnosis – realigning again”, “Bearing 
limitations and loss – finding new ways in daily life”, “Living in uncertainty – 
holding out together”. Conclusions: Patients and significant others live in 
changing lifeworlds caused by transitions. Health care professionals should be 
attentive and may gain deeper knowledge about transitions. Further research in 
German-speaking contexts will help to improve nursing care and psychooncological 
interventions.

This study was conducted to compare the shelf-life of beef steaks stored in 
different packaging conditions: overwrapped (OW) packaging and 2 modified 
atmosphere packaging systems (MAP): 80% O2 MAP (80% O2 /20% CO2 ) and 50% O2 MAP 
(50% O2 /40% CO2 /10% N2 ). Steaks were stored at 2 °C for 20 d. Headspace gas 
composition, microbial counts, color stability, pH, purge loss, and lipid 
oxidation were monitored. Among the packaging types, 50% O2 MAP was superior to 
OW packaging and 80% O2 MAP in delaying bacterial growth and extending 
shelf-life to 20 d. 50% O2 MAP also gave steaks an acceptable color during 
storage. No significant differences were observed in color stability of steaks 
packaged in both 50% O2 MAP and 80% O2 MAP. This study reveals 50% O2 MAP is a 
realistic alternative to preserve beef steaks efficiently.

The pig is an ideal large animal model for genetic engineering applications. A 
relatively short gestation interval and large litter size makes the pig a 
conducive model for generating and propagating genetic modifications. The 
domestic pig also shares close similarity in anatomy, physiology, size, and life 
expectancy, making it an ideal animal for modeling human diseases. Often, 
however, the technical difficulties in generating desired genetic modifications 
such as targeted knockin of short stretches of sequences or transgenes have 
impeded progress in this field. In this study, we have investigated and compared 
the relative efficiency of CRISPR/Cas ribonucleoproteins in engineering targeted 
knockin of pseudo attP sites downstream of a ubiquitously expressed COL1A gene 
in porcine somatic cells and generated live fetuses by somatic cell nuclear 
transfer (SCNT). By leveraging these knockin pseudo attP sites, we have 
demonstrated subsequent phiC31 integrase mediated integration of green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene into the site. This work for the first time 
created an optimized protocol for CRISPR/Cas mediated knockin in porcine somatic 
cells, while simultaneously creating a stable platform for future transgene 
integration and generating transgenic animals.

Recent evidence demonstrating an increased fracture risk among obese individuals 
suggests that adipose tissue may negatively impact bone health, challenging the 
traditional paradigm of fat mass playing a protective role towards bone health. 
White adipose tissue, far from being a mere energy depot, is a dynamic tissue 
actively implicated in metabolic reactions, and in fact secretes several 
hormones called adipokines and inflammatory factors that may in turn promote 
bone resorption. More specifically, Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) may 
potentially prove detrimental. It is widely acknowledged that obesity is 
positively associated to many chronic disorders such as metabolic syndrome, 
dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes, conditions that could themselves affect bone 
health. Although aging is largely known to decrease bone strength, little is yet 
known on the mechanisms via which obesity and its comorbidities may contribute 
to such damage. Given the exponentially growing obesity rate in recent years and 
the increased life expectancy of western countries it appears of utmost 
importance to timely focus on this topic.

BACKGROUND: Stroke poses a growing human and economic burden in South Africa. 
Excess sugar consumption, especially from sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), has 
been associated with increased obesity and stroke risk. Research shows that 
price increases for SSBs can influence consumption and modelling evidence 
suggests that taxing SSBs has the potential to reduce obesity and related 
diseases. This study estimates the potential impact of an SSB tax on 
stroke-related mortality, costs and health-adjusted life years in South Africa.
METHODS: A proportional multi-state life table-based model was constructed in 
Microsoft Excel (2010). We used consumption data from the 2012 South African 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, previously published own and 
cross price elasticities of SSBs and energy balance equations to estimate 
changes in daily energy intake and BMI arising from increased SSB prices. Stroke 
relative risk, and prevalent years lived with disability estimates from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study and modelled disease epidemiology estimates from 
a previous study, were used to estimate the effect of the BMI changes on the 
burden of stroke.
RESULTS: Our model predicts that an SSB tax may avert approximately 72 000 
deaths, 550 000 stroke-related health-adjusted life years and over ZAR5 billion, 
(USD400 million) in health care costs over 20 years (USD296-576 million). Over 
20 years, the number of incident stroke cases may be reduced by approximately 85 
000 and prevalent cases by about 13 000.
CONCLUSIONS: Fiscal policy has the potential, as part of a multi-faceted 
approach, to mitigate the growing burden of stroke in South Africa and 
contribute to the achievement of the target set by the Department of Health to 
reduce relative premature mortality (less than 60 years) from non-communicable 
diseases by the year 2020.

    Lancet HIV. 2016 Jun;3(6):e244-6.

BACKGROUND: Home HIV testing and counselling (HTC) achieves high levels of HIV 
testing and linkage to care. Periodic home HTC, particularly targeted to those 
with high HIV viral load, might facilitate expansion of antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) coverage. We used a mathematical model to assess the effect of periodic 
home HTC programmes on HIV incidence in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
METHODS: We developed a dynamic HIV transmission model with parameters, primary 
cost data, and measures of viral suppression collected from a prospective study 
of home HTC in KwaZulu-Natal. In our model, we assumed home HTC took place every 
5 years with ART initiation for people with CD4 counts of 350 cells per μL or 
less. For individuals with CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per μL, we compared 
increasing ART coverage for those with 350-500 cells per μL with initiating 
treatment for those who have viral loads of more than 10 000 copies per mL.
FINDINGS: Maintaining the presently observed level of 36% viral suppression in 
HIV-positive people, HIV incidence decreases by 33·8% over 10 years. Home HTC 
every 5 years with linkage to care with ART initiation at CD4 counts of 350 
cells per μL or less reduces HIV incidence by 40·6% over 10 years. Expansion of 
ART to people with CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per μL who also have a 
viral load of 10 000 copies per mL or more decreases HIV incidence by 51·6%, and 
this was the most cost-effective strategy for prevention of HIV infections at 
US$2960 per infection averted. Expansion of ART eligibility CD4 counts of 
350-500 cells per μL is cost-effective at $900 per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained. Following health economic guidelines, expansion of ART use to 
individuals who have viral loads of more than 10 000 copies per mL among those 
with CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per μL was cost-effective to reduce 
HIV-related morbidity.
INTERPRETATION: Our results show that province-wide home HTC every 5 years can 
be a cost-effective strategy to increase ART coverage and reduce HIV burden. 
Expanded ART initiation criteria that includes individuals with high viral load 
will improve the effectiveness of home HTC in linking individuals to ART who are 
at high risk of transmitting HIV, thereby preventing morbidity and onward 
transmission.

Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adulthood is associated with an increased 
risk of developing adverse cardiovascular events and with reduced life 
expectancy. Cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities have so far been 
evaluated only in a small number of children with GHD and adolescents. In this 
article we review these abnormalities and their underlying mechanisms and 
discuss the beneficial effect of growth hormone treatment in subjects with GHD.

Gene functions of strains of Maize chlorotic mottle virus, which comprises the 
monotypic genus Machlomovirus, have not been previously identified. In this 
study mutagenesis of the seven genes encoded in maize chlorotic mottle virus 
(MCMV) showed that the genes with positional and sequence similarity to their 
homologs in viruses of related tombusvirid genera had similar functions. p50 and 
its readthrough protein p111 are the only proteins required for replication in 
maize protoplasts, and they function at a low level in trans. Two movement 
proteins, p7a and p7b, and coat protein, encoded on subgenomic RNA1, are 
required for cell-to-cell movement in maize, and p7a and p7b function in trans. 
A unique protein, p31, expressed as a readthrough extension of p7a, is required 
for efficient systemic infection. The 5' proximal MCMV gene encodes a unique 
32kDa protein that is not required for replication or movement. Transcripts 
lacking p32 expression accumulate to about 1/3 the level of wild type 
transcripts in protoplasts and produce delayed, mild infections in maize plants. 
Additional studies on p32, p31 and the unique amino-terminal region of p50 are 
needed to further characterize the life cycle of this unique tombusvirid.

During the last 40 years, Finland has experienced a remarkable decline in 
coronary heart disease and stroke mortality. The latest coronary heart disease 
mortality figures in the working-age population are <20% of the top figures in 
the early 1970s. Equal declines can be seen in men and in women, and the 
improvement extends to elderly populations as well. However, due to the very 
high historic levels, Finland still continues to have clearly higher 
cardiovascular mortality than, for example, the Mediterranean countries. 
Parallel to the decline in cardiovascular mortality, the life expectancy of 
Finns has increased by 11.6 years in men and by 9.2 years in women. The 
probability for a 30-year-old man to die of cardiovascular disease has dropped 
from about 30% in 1970 to 7% in 2013, and for a 30-year-old woman, the 
corresponding probability has dropped from 13% to about 2%.

Predicting precisely where a crack will develop in a material under stress and 
exactly when in time catastrophic fracture of the component will occur is one 
the oldest unsolved mysteries in the design and building of large-scale 
engineering structures. Where human life depends upon engineering ingenuity, the 
burden of testing to prove a 'fracture safe design' is immense. Fitness 
considerations for long-life implementation of large composite structures 
include understanding phenomena such as impact, fatigue, creep and stress 
corrosion cracking that affect reliability, life expectancy and durability of 
structure. Structural integrity analysis treats the design, the materials used, 
and figures out how best components and parts can be joined, and takes service 
duty into account. However, there are conflicting aims in the complete design 
process of designing simultaneously for high efficiency and safety assurance 
throughout an economically viable lifetime with an acceptable level of risk. 
This article is part of the themed issue 'Multiscale modelling of the structural 
integrity of composite materials'.

Reconsolidation of memories has mostly been studied at the behavioral and 
molecular level. Here, we put forward a simple extension of existing 
computational models of synaptic consolidation to capture hippocampal slice 
experiments that have been interpreted as reconsolidation at the synaptic level. 
The model implements reconsolidation through stabilization of consolidated 
synapses by stabilizing entities combined with an activity-dependent reservoir 
of stabilizing entities that are immune to protein synthesis inhibition (PSI). 
We derive a reduced version of our model to explore the conditions under which 
synaptic reconsolidation does or does not occur, often referred to as the 
boundary conditions of reconsolidation. We find that our computational model of 
synaptic reconsolidation displays complex boundary conditions. Our results 
suggest that a limited resource of hypothetical stabilizing molecules or 
complexes, which may be implemented by protein phosphorylation or different 
receptor subtypes, can underlie the phenomenon of synaptic reconsolidation.

Suzuki, T, Shioda, K, Kinugasa, R, and Fukashiro, S. Simultaneous knee extensor 
muscle action induces an increase in voluntary force generation of plantar 
flexor muscles. J Strength Cond Res 31(2): 365-371, 2017-Maximum activation of 
the plantar flexor muscles is required for various sporting activities that 
involve simultaneous plantar flexion and knee extension. During a multi-joint 
movement, activation of the plantar flexor muscles is affected by the activity 
of the knee extensor muscles. We hypothesized that coactivation of the plantar 
flexor muscles and knee extensor muscles would result in a higher plantar 
flexion torque. To test this hypothesis, 8 male volunteers performed maximum 
voluntary isometric action of the plantar flexor muscles with and without 
isometric action of the knee extensor muscles. Surface electromyographic data 
were collected from 8 muscles of the right lower limb. Voluntary activation of 
the triceps surae muscles, evaluated using the interpolated twitch technique, 
significantly increased by 6.4 percentage points with intentional knee extensor 
action (p = 0.0491). This finding is in line with a significant increase in the 
average rectified value of the electromyographic activity of the vastus 
lateralis, fibularis longus, and soleus muscles (p = 0.013, 0.010, and 0.045, 
respectively). The resultant plantar flexion torque also significantly increased 
by 11.5% of the predetermined maximum (p = 0.031). These results suggest that 
higher plantar flexor activation coupled with knee extensor activation 
facilitates force generation during a multi-joint task.

Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.

BACKGROUND: Bereaved parents experience significant psychosocial and health 
sequelae, suggesting that this population may benefit from the ongoing extension 
of support and resources throughout the grief journey. The interaction of 
hospital staff with patients and families at the end of a child's life and after 
death profoundly affects parental grief, offering a unique opportunity for the 
medical community to positively impact the bereavement experience. The current 
study was conducted to explore the role of the health care team and medical 
institutions in the grief journeys of parents whose child died a cancer-related 
death.
METHODS: Eleven bereaved parents participated in 2 focus groups. Responses to 
each of the 3 main prompts were coded and analyzed independently using semantic 
content analysis techniques.
RESULTS: Four main concepts were identified within the parental narratives, 
including the importance of strong and ongoing relationships between providers 
and bereaved families, the importance of high-quality communication, the effect 
of negative experiences between providers and families on parental grief, and 
the importance of the institution's role in the grief journeys of bereaved 
parents.
CONCLUSIONS: Bereaved parents consistently identified the critical role played 
by medical staff and medical institutions throughout the grief journey. Key 
components of bereavement support identified by parents should serve to guide 
the actions of providers as well as provide a template for the development of a 
comprehensive bereavement program within an institution. Cancer 2016. © 2016

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most common and severe of the 
inherited dystrophies, with an incidence of 1 in 3 500 live, male births 
worldwide. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) has a lower incidence of 1:14 000 - 
18 000 boys and a milder progression and longer life expectancy. Over the last 
two decades, better understanding of the underlying disease aetiology as well as 
major advances in medical technology have brought about significantly improved 
genetic diagnosis and clinical care for B/DMD patients. Exciting developments in 
the field of gene-based therapies have once again put B/DMD in the limelight, 
with renewed focus on the importance of comprehensive genetic testing protocols. 
We present a historical overview of the medical and molecular service for B/DMD 
offered over the last three decades in South Africa, specifically in the Western 
Cape, from a clinical as well as a laboratory perspective.

BACKGROUND: Long-term improvement of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 
schizophrenia may improve adherence and reduce relapse and rehospitalization. 
This analysis examines long-term changes in HRQoL among patients with 
schizophrenia switched to lurasidone from other antipsychotics.
METHODS: Patients who completed an open-label 6-week switch study continued on 
lurasidone for an additional 24-weeks. HRQoL was measured using the 
self-reported Personal Evaluation of Transitions in Treatment (PETiT) scale and 
Short-Form 12 (SF-12) questionnaire. The PETiT assessed HRQoL via total and 
domain scores (adherence-related attitude and psychosocial functioning). The 
SF-12 assessed patients' mental and physical component summary scores (MCS and 
PCS). Mean changes from the initial baseline were calculated at extension 
baseline and extension endpoint using analysis of covariance models. Analyses 
were further stratified by prior antipsychotic medication and responder status; 
responders were defined as having a ≥20 % improvement in Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale during the first 6-weeks of treatment.
RESULTS: The analysis included 144 patients with PETIT or SF-12 data who 
received ≥1 dose of lurasidone. Mean (standard deviation) PETiT total score 
improved significantly from 34.9 (9.3) at baseline to 39.5 (8.9) at extension 
baseline and 39.1 (9.0) at extension endpoint, representing improvements of 4.5 
(7.9) and 5.1 (7.2) points, respectively (both p < 0.001). Significant 
improvements in adherence-related attitude and psychosocial functioning were 
observed at extension baseline and extension endpoint (all p < 0.001). 
Improvement in SF-12 MCS score was observed at extension baseline and endpoint, 
and PCS score at extension endpoint (all p < 0.01). Patients who switched from 
quetiapine and aripiprazole showed significant improvement of PETiT total score 
and adherence-related attitude at extension baseline and extension endpoint. In 
addition, patients who switched from quetiapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, or 
ziprasidone showed significant improvement in MCS scores from baseline to 
extension endpoint. Responders to lurasidone demonstrated greater improvement in 
PETiT total, psychosocial functioning, and MCS scores at extension baseline than 
nonresponders.
CONCLUSIONS: After switching to lurasidone, patients with schizophrenia 
experienced HRQoL improvements that were sustained for an additional 24 weeks of 
treatment. Further study is warranted to understand the implications of these 
improvements in terms of employment, adherence, relapse, and rehospitalization.

OBJECTIVE Cervical spondylotic myelopathy usually presents in the 5th decade of 
life or later but can also present earlier in patients with congenital spinal 
stenosis. As life expectancy continues to increase in the United States, the 
preconceived reluctance toward operating on the elderly population based on 
older publications must be rethought. It is a known fact that outcomes in the 
elderly cannot be as robust as those in the younger population. There are no 
publications with detailed meta-analyses to determine an acceptable level of 
outcome in this population. In this review, the authors compare elderly patients 
older than 75 years to a nonelderly population, and they discuss some of the 
relevant strategies to minimize complications. METHODS In accordance with PRISMA 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, 
the authors performed a PubMed database search to identify English-language 
literature published between 1995 and 2015. Combinations of the following 
phrases that describe the age group ("elderly," "non-elderly," "old," "age") and 
the disease of interest as well as management ("surgical outcome," "surgery," 
"cervical spondylotic myelopathy," "cervical degenerative myelopathy") were 
constructed when searching for relevant articles. Two reviewers independently 
assessed the outcomes, and any disagreement was discussed with the first author 
until it was resolved. A random-effects model was applied to assess pooled data 
due to high heterogeneity between studies. The mean difference (MD) and odds 
ratio were calculated for continuous and dichromatic parameters, respectively. 
RESULTS Eighteen studies comprising elderly (n = 1169) and nonelderly (n = 1699) 
patients who received surgical treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy 
were included in this meta-analysis. Of these studies, 5 were prospective and 13 
were retrospective. Intraoperatively, both groups required a similar amount of 
operation time (p = 0.35). The elderly group had lower Japanese Orthopaedic 
Association (JOA) scores (MD -1.36, 95% CI -1.62 to -1.09; p < 0.00001) to begin 
with compared with the nonelderly group. The nonelderly group also had a higher 
postoperative JOA score (MD -1.11, 95% CI -1.44 to -0.79; p < 0.00001), 
therefore demonstrating a higher recovery rate from surgeries (MD -11.98, 95% CI 
-16.16 to -7.79; p < 0.00001). The length of stay (MD 4.14, 95% CI 3.54-4.73; p 
< 0.00001) was slightly longer in the elderly group. In terms of radiological 
outcomes, the elderly group had a smaller postoperative Cobb angle but a greater 
increase in spinal canal diameter compared with the nonelderly group. The 
complication rates were not significant. CONCLUSIONS Cervical myelopathy is a 
disease of the elderly, and age is an independent factor for recovery from 
surgery. Postoperative and long-term outcomes have been remarkable in terms of 
improvement in mobility and independence requiring reduced nursing care. There 
is definitely a higher potential risk while operating on the elderly population, 
but no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative complications 
was noted. Withholding surgery from the elderly population can lead to increased 
morbidity due to rapid progression of symptoms in addition to deconditioning 
from lack of mobility and independence. Reduction in operative time under 
anesthesia, lower blood loss, and perioperative fluid management have been shown 
to minimize the complication rate. The authors request that neurosurgeons weigh 
the potential benefit against the risks for every patient before withholding 
surgery from elderly patients.

BACKGROUND: Advance in medicine has led to an increase in life expectancy of 
elderly diabetic patients especially on the growing population called the 
"oldest old", those in their mid-80s upwards. The aim of this study is to 
describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of "oldest old" patients in a 
specialized diabetes center.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on medical records of type 2 
diabetes who were older than 85 years at Theptarin hospital from September 2014 
to August 2015.
RESULTS: During the study period, there were 143 oldest old diabetic patients 
who visited our hospital regularly. Of the 133 active follow-up patients (median 
time of follow-up 15 years, range 1-30 years), 70.7 % was female, the mean age 
of onset was 68.3 ± 11.5 years and duration of diabetes was 20.1 ± 11.1 years. 
According to the Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI), 35.3 % of patients were 
classified as having severe co-morbidities. The mean A1C, blood pressure, LDL 
were 6.7 ± 1.1 %, 132/65 mmHg and 80 ± 29 mg/dl respectively. 66.9 % of patients 
had tight glycemic control (A1C <7 %) while 12.0 % had poor control (A1C >8 %). 
Oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA) dual therapy was the most common treatment 
(26.3 %) followed by OHA monotherapy (22.6 %), insulin alone (19.5 %), diet 
therapy alone (12.7 %), and insulin plus OHA (8.3 %). Hypoglycemia was found in 
10.5 % of patients in previous 12 months. Diabetic retinopathy, chronic kidney 
disease, cardiovascular disease, and stroke were presented in 23.4, 54.9, 15.8, 
18.0 % of patients, respectively. Among patients whose received diabetic 
medications and resulted in very low level of A1C (A1C less than 6.0 %), only 
20.0 % underwent deintensification.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that real-world clinical outcomes of extreme 
elderly diabetic patients were diverse and being too "aggressive" diabetes 
treatment with older patients did occur frequently. Decision making in older 
people with diabetes is complex as chronic co-morbidities are very common.

Central adrenal insufficiency (CAI) in acromegaly may be related to pituitary 
adenoma or induced by various medical treatments, transsphenoidal neurosurgery 
(TNS) or radiotherapy (RT), alone or combined. We assessed the role of all 
available treatments for acromegaly in inducing CAI. We retrospectively studied 
97 patients. CAI was diagnosed if morning serum cortisol was <138 nmol/l, or if 
its response was inadequate in the low-dose short synacthen test. Seventy-four 
subjects underwent TNS (and 17 of whom also underwent RT), and 23 were on 
primary medical therapy: overall we diagnosed 21 cases of CAI. Duration of 
acromegaly, invasion of cavernous sinus, disease control, and type of medical 
treatment were much the same for patients with and without CAI, which was 
identified in 18% of patients (10/57) after one TNS, and in 53% (9/17) after RT 
(p=0.01); repeat surgery increased the risk of CAI (p=0.02). The risk of CAI 
onset during the follow-up was lower among patients treated with TNS or medical 
therapy than after RT (p=0.035). Medical treatment did not raise the risk of 
CAI, whereas a 5- and 4-fold higher risk of CAI was associated with repeat TNS 
and RT, respectively. Basal or stimulated cortisol levels were similar among 
acromegalic patients without CAI and matched controls with nonsecreting 
pituitary lesions. A significant proportion of patients with acromegaly 
developed CAI over time. While primary or secondary medical treatment did not 
contribute to the risk of CAI, repeat TNS and RT correlated with 
pituitary-adrenal axis impairment.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent the most widespread type of 
genetic variation (approximately 90%) in the human genome, and the demand to 
overcome such variation has received more attention now than ever before. The 
capacity to rapidly assess SNPs that correlate with disease predisposition, drug 
efficacy and drug toxicity is a key step for the development of personalized 
medicine. In this work, a rapid one-step SNP detection method, real-time 
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), was first applied for CYP2C19 
polymorphisms testing. The optimized method was established with specifically 
designed primers for target amplification by real-time detection in 
approximately 30 min under isothermal conditions. RT-LAMP amplified few copies 
of template to produce significant amounts of product and quantitatively 
detected human DNA with compatible specificity and sensitivity. The success in 
the establishment of this RT-LAMP protocol for CYP2C19 polymorphism testing is 
significant for the extension of this technique for the detection of other SNPs, 
which will further facilitate the development of personalized medicine.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a worldwide pathogen that 
is resistant to practically the entire class of β-lactam antibiotics due to the 
presence of the mecA gene. The mecA gene is located on a large mobile genetic 
element referred to as staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), and the 
excision and integration of SCCmec are mediated by the Ccr recombinase encoded 
by ccrAB or ccrC, which are also located on SCCmec. Previous studies have shown 
that the ccrAB genes are only expressed in a minority of cells and that their 
expression levels can be affected by certain environmental stimuli, but the 
molecular mechanisms controlling these phenotypes remain elusive. Here, we found 
that overexpression of SigB can dramatically enhance ccrA transcription and 
SCCmec excision in MRSA strain N315, revealing an important role for this 
alternative sigma factor in the lateral transfer of SCCmec. Further primer 
extension-blot analysis and 5'RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) indicated 
that an unrecognized SigB-dependent promoter region, which exists in certain 
SCCmec type II and IV strains, is responsible for the enhancement, and the ccrAB 
genes are in fact transcribed in a two-promoter pattern with a low activity of 
the SigB-dependent promoter under normal growth conditions.

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the relative cost-effectiveness of haloperidol 
decanoate (HD), a first-generation long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic, 
and paliperidone palmitate (PP), a second-generation LAI antipsychotic.
METHODS: A double-blind, randomized 18-month clinical trial conducted at 22 
clinical research sites in the United States compared the cost-effectiveness of 
HD and PP among 311 adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who 
had been clinically assessed as likely to benefit from an LAI antipsychotic. 
Patients were randomly assigned to monthly intramuscular injections of HD
