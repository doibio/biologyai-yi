showed some improved signs. In both groups, increasing body weight and age 
corresponded with worse clinical and laboratory findings.
CONCLUSION: A single injection of platelet concentrate had a positive effect, 
lasting up to 6 months, on several clinical, imaging, and laboratory signs in a 
naturally occurring canine OA model.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We characterized the effects of this platelet concentrate in 
dogs, considered the gold standard of the study of OA, with a group of working 
animals with similar high demands as athletes.

INTRODUCTION: Improvements in life expectancy imply that an increase of 
geriatric trauma patients occurs. These patients require special attention due 
to their multiple comorbidity issues. The aim of this study was to assess the 
impact of the implementation of geriatric comanagement (GC) on the allocation 
and clinical outcome of geriatric trauma patients.
METHODS: This observational cohort study aims to compare the demographic 
development and the clinical outcome in geriatric trauma patients (aged 70 years 
and older) before and after implementation of a certified geriatric trauma 
center (GC). Geriatric trauma patients admitted between January 1, 2010 and 
December 31, 2010 were stratified to group pre-GC and admissions between January 
1, 2018 and December 31, 2018 to Group post-GC. We excluded patients requiring 
end-of-life treatment and those who died within 24 h or due to severe traumatic 
brain injury. Outcome parameters included demographic changes, medical 
complexity (measured by American Society of Anaesthesiology Score (ASA) and 
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)), in-hospital mortality and length of 
hospitalization.
RESULTS: This study includes 626 patients in Group pre-GC (mean age 80.3 ± 6.7 
years) and 841 patients in Group post-GC (mean age 81.1 ± 7.3 years). Group 
pre-GC included 244 (39.0%) males, group post-GC included 361 (42.9%) males. The 
mean CCI was 4.7 (± 1.8) points in pre-GC and 5.1 (± 2.0) points in post-GC (p 
<0.001). In Group pre-GC, 100 patients (16.0%) were stratified as ASA 1 compared 
with 47 patients (5.6%) in Group post-GC (p <0.001). Group pre-GC had 
significantly less patients stratified as ASA 3 or higher (n = 235, 37.5%) 
compared with Group post-GC (n = 389, 46.3%, p <0.001). Length of stay (LOS) 
decreased significantly from 10.4 (± 20.3) days in Group pre-GC to 7.9 (±22.9) 
days in Group post-GC (p = 0.011). The 30-day mortality rate was comparable 
amongst these groups (pre-GC 8.8% vs. post-GC 8.9%).
CONCLUSION: This study appears to support the implementation of a geriatric 
trauma center, as certain improvements in the patient care were found: Despite a 
higher CCI and a higher number of patients with higher ASA classifications, 
Hospital LOS, complication rates and mortality did were not increased after 
implementation of the CG. The increase in the case numbers supports the fact 
that a higher degree of specialization leads to a response by admitting 
physicians, as it exceeded the expectable trend of demographic ageing. We feel 
that a larger data base, hopefully in a multi center set up should be undertaken 
to verify these results.

Studying the spatial characteristics of China's ageing and its influencing 
factors is of great practical significance because China has the largest elderly 
population in the world. Using 2000 and 2010 census data, this study explores 
the degree, pace, and pattern of population ageing and its driving mechanism 
using exploratory spatial data analysis and the geographically weighed 
regression model. Between 2000 and 2010, population ageing increased rapidly 
countrywide; yet, spatial differences between eastern and western China 
narrowed. The degree of provincial population ageing and its spatiality were 
determined by natural population growth, migration, and local economic 
development. Life expectancy and mortality were the primary long-term factors, 
and GDP per capita was the prime contributor in the early days of economic 
development; the migration rate was the dominant influence after 2010. China's 
overall spatial differentiation of population ageing shifted from a north-south 
to an east-west division.

BACKGROUND: Health indicators, such as mortality rates or life expectancy, need 
to be presented at the local level to improve the health of local residents and 
to reduce health inequality across geographic areas. The aim of this study was 
to estimate life expectancy at the district level in Korea through a 
spatio-temporal analysis.
METHODS: Spatio-temporal models were applied to the National Health Information 
Database of the National Health Insurance Service to estimate the mortality 
rates for 19 age groups in 250 districts from 2004 to 2017 by gender in Korea. 
Annual district-level life tables by gender were constructed using the estimated 
mortality rates, and then annual district-level life expectancy by gender was 
estimated using the life table method and the Kannisto-Thatcher method. The 
annual district-level life expectancies based on the spatio-temporal models were 
compared to the life expectancies calculated under the assumption that the 
mortality rates in these 250 districts are independent from one another.
RESULTS: In 2017, district-level life expectancy at birth ranged from 75.5 years 
(95% credible interval [CI], 74.0-77.0 years) to 84.2 years (95% CI, 83.4-85.0 
years) for men and from 83.9 years (95% CI, 83.2-84.6 years) to 88.2 years (95% 
CI, 87.3-89.1 years) for women. Between 2004 and 2017, district-level life 
expectancy at birth increased by 4.57 years (95% CI, 4.49-4.65 years) for men 
and by 4.06 years (95% CI, 3.99-4.12 years) for women. To obtain stable annual 
life expectancy estimates at the district level, it is recommended to use the 
life expectancy based on spatio-temporal models instead of calculating life 
expectancy using observed mortality.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we estimated the annual district-level life 
expectancy from 2004 to 2017 in Korea by gender using a spatio-temporal model. 
Local governments could use annual district-level life expectancy estimates as a 
performance indicator of health policies to improve the health of local 
residents. The approach to district-level analysis with spatio-temporal modeling 
employed in this study could be used in future analyses to produce 
district-level health-related indicators in Korea.

Acquiring gait parameters from usual walking is important to predict clinical 
outcomes including life expectancy, risk of fall, and neurocognitive performance 
in older people. We developed a novel gait analysis tool that is small, 
less-intrusive and is based on two-dimensional light detection and ranging 
(2D-LiDAR) technology. Using an object-tracking algorithm, we conducted a 
validation study of the spatiotemporal tracking of ankle locations of young, 
healthy participants (n = 4) by comparing our tool and a stereo camera with the 
motion capture system as a gold standard modality. We also assessed parameters 
including step length, step width, cadence, and gait speed. The 2D-LiDAR system 
showed a much better accuracy than that of a stereo camera system, where mean 
absolute errors were 46.2 ± 17.8 mm and 116.3 ± 69.6 mm, respectively. Gait 
parameters from the 2D-LiDAR system were in good agreement with those from the 
motion capture system (r = 0.955 for step length, r = 0.911 for cadence). 
Simultaneous tracking of multiple targets by the 2D-LiDAR system was also 
demonstrated. The novel system might be useful in space and resource constrained 
clinical practice for older adults.

BACKGROUND: In view of the upcoming demographic transition, there is still no 
clear evidence on how increasing life expectancy will affect future disease 
burden, especially regarding specific diseases. In our study, we project the 
future development of Germany's ten most common non-infectious diseases 
(arthrosis, coronary heart disease, pulmonary, bronchial and tracheal cancer, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular diseases, dementia, 
depression, diabetes, dorsal pain and heart failure) in a Markov illness-death 
model with recovery until 2060.
METHODS: The disease-specific input data stem from a consistent data set of a 
major sickness fund covering about four million people, the demographic 
components from official population statistics. Using six different scenarios 
concerning an expansion and a compression of morbidity as well as increasing 
recovery and effective prevention, we can show the possible future range of 
disease burden and, by disentangling the effects, reveal the significant 
differences between the various diseases in interaction with the demographic 
components.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that, although strongly age-related diseases like 
dementia or heart failure show the highest relative increase rates, diseases of 
the musculoskeletal system, such as dorsal pain and arthrosis, still will be 
responsible for the majority of the German population's future disease burden in 
2060, with about 25-27 and 13-15 million patients, respectively. Most 
importantly, for almost all considered diseases a significant increase in burden 
of disease can be expected even in case of a compression of morbidity.
CONCLUSION: A massive case-load is emerging on the German health care system, 
which can only be alleviated by more effective prevention. Immediate action by 
policy makers and health care managers is needed, as otherwise the prevalence of 
widespread diseases will become unsustainable from a capacity point-of-view.

Scaffold analysis of compound data sets has reemerged as a chemically 
interpretable alternative to machine learning for chemical space and 
structure-activity relationships analysis. In this context, analog series-based 
scaffolds (ASBS) are synthetically relevant core structures that represent 
individual series of analogs. As an extension to ASBS, we herein introduce the 
development of a general conceptual framework that considers all putative cores 
of molecules in a compound data set, thus softening the often applied "single 
molecule-single scaffold" correspondence. A putative core is here defined as any 
substructure of a molecule complying with two basic rules: (a) the size of the 
core is a significant proportion of the whole molecule size and (b) the 
substructure can be reached from the original molecule through a succession of 
retrosynthesis rules. Thereafter, a bipartite network consisting of molecules 
and cores can be constructed for a database of chemical structures. Compounds 
linked to the same cores are considered analogs. We present case studies 
illustrating the potential of the general framework. The applications range from 
inter- and intra-core diversity analysis of compound data sets, 
structure-property relationships, and identification of analog series and ASBS. 
The molecule-core network herein presented is a general methodology with 
multiple applications in scaffold analysis. New statistical methods are 
envisioned that will be able to draw quantitative conclusions from these data. 
The code to use the method presented in this work is freely available as an 
additional file. Follow-up applications include analog searching and core 
structure-property relationships analyses.

BACKGROUND: During the Randomized Assessment of Rapid Endovascular Treatment 
(EVT) of Ischemic Stroke (ESCAPE) trial, patient-level micro-costing data were 
collected. We report a cost-effectiveness analysis of EVT, using ESCAPE trial 
data and Markov simulation, from a universal, single-payer system using a 
societal perspective over a patient's lifetime.
METHODS: Primary data collection alongside the ESCAPE trial provided a 3-month 
trial-specific, non-model, based cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). A 
Markov model utilizing ongoing lifetime costs and life expectancy from the 
literature was built to simulate the cost per QALY adopting a lifetime horizon. 
Health states were defined using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. 
Uncertainty was explored using scenario analysis and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: The 3-month trial-based analysis resulted in a cost per QALY of 
$201,243 of EVT compared to the best standard of care. In the model-based 
analysis, using a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon, EVT dominated the 
standard of care; EVT was both more effective and less costly than the standard 
of care (-$91). When the time horizon was shortened to 1 year, EVT remains cost 
savings compared to standard of care (∼$15,376 per QALY gained with EVT). 
However, if the estimate of clinical effectiveness is 4% less than that 
demonstrated in ESCAPE, EVT is no longer cost savings compared to standard of 
care.
CONCLUSIONS: Results support the adoption of EVT as a treatment option for acute 
ischemic stroke, as the increase in costs associated with caring for EVT 
patients was recouped within the first year of stroke, and continued to provide 
cost savings over a patient's lifetime.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT01778335.

Salute e della Scienza" Hospital, Turin, Italy.

OBJECTIVE: Hope promotes oncology patients' adaptability to their illness, 
regardless of the stage of cancer. This study aimed to determine the prevalence 
of hope in a sample of end-of-life patients and to investigate the possible 
relationships between hope and a set of clinical and psychosocial measures.
METHOD: Three hundred and fifty end-of-life oncology patients, with a presumed 
life expectancy of 4 months or less and a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of 
50 or lower, were administered the Italian validated versions of a set of rating 
scales during their first consultation with a psychologist. This included the 
Herth Hope Index (HHI), Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI), Demoralization Scale 
(DS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Functional Assessment of 
Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT-Sp), and the Visual Analogue Scale for pain 
(VAS).
RESULTS: On average, the sample scored between moderate and high on the HHI and 
the average level of spirituality was high. However, most patients had 
clinically relevant anxious and depressive symptomatology and high levels of 
demoralization. Other than the pain scale, the total HHI score significantly 
correlated with the total scores of all rating scales and their subscales, as 
well as with the measure of personal religious practice. The "Meaning" FACIT-Sp 
subscale was found to be the main predictor of hope.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Since hope represents a core need and a tool for 
patients dealing with their illness, it is essential to implement stage-specific 
and realistic hope-facilitating interventions and support patients in their 
search for meaning, which promotes spiritual well-being and appears relevant in 
fostering hope.

OBJECTIVES: Abiraterone acetate is registered for the treatment of metastatic 
castration-sensitive and resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Treatment outcome is 
associated with plasma trough concentrations (Cmin) of abiraterone. Patients 
with a plasma Cmin below the target of 8.4 ng/mL may benefit from treatment 
optimization by dose increase or concomitant intake with food. This study aims 
to investigate the cost-effectiveness of monitoring abiraterone Cmin in patients 
with mCRPC.
METHODS: A Markov model was built with health states progression-free survival, 
progressed disease, and death. The benefits of monitoring abiraterone Cmin 
followed by a dose increase or food intervention were modeled via a difference 
in the percentage of patients achieving adequate Cmin taking a healthcare payer 
perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed 
to assess uncertainties and their impac to the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Monitoring abiraterone followed by a dose increase resulted in 0.149 
incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with €22 145 incremental costs 
and an ICER of €177 821/QALY. The food intervention assumed equal effects and 
estimated incremental costs of €7599, resulting in an ICER of €61 019/QALY. The 
likelihoods of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) with a dose increase or food 
intervention being cost-effective were 8.04%and 81.9%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring abiraterone followed by a dose increase is not 
cost-effective in patients with mCRPC from a healthcare payer perspective. 
Monitoring in combination with a food intervention is likely to be 
cost-effective. This cost-effectiveness assessment may assist decision making in 
future integration of abiraterone TDM followed by a food intervention into 
standard abiraterone acetate treatment practices of mCRPC patients.

OBJECTIVES: Bullying and aggression among children and young people are key 
public mental health priorities. In this study, we evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of a complex school-based intervention to address these 
outcomes within a large-cluster randomized trial (Inclusive).
METHODS: Forty state secondary schools were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive 
the intervention or continue with current practice as controls. Data were 
collected using paper questionnaires completed in classrooms including measures 
of their health-related quality of life using the Childhood Utility Index and 
police and National Health Service resource use. Further detailed data were 
collected on the cost of delivering the intervention. We calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios following the intention-to-treat principle using 
multilevel linear regression models that allowed for clustering of pupils at the 
school level.
RESULTS: Overall, we found that the intervention was highly cost-effective, with 
cost-per quality-adjusted life year thresholds of £13 284 and £1875 at 2 years 
and 3 years, respectively. Analysis of uncertainty in the result at 2 years 
revealed a 65% chance of being cost-effective, but after 3 years there was a 90% 
chance that it was cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: This study provides strong evidence collected prospectively from a 
randomized study that this school-based intervention is highly cost-effective. 
Education- and health-sector policy makers should consider investment in scaling 
up this intervention.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of extending the Dutch 
influenza vaccination program for elderly and medical high-risk groups to 
include pediatric influenza vaccination, taking indirect protection into 
account.
METHODS: An age-structured dynamic transmission model was used that was 
calibrated to influenza-associated GP visits over 4 seasons (2010-2011 to 
2013-2014). The clinical and economic impact of different pediatric vaccination 
strategies were compared over 20 years, varying the targeted age range, the 
vaccine type for children or elderly and high-risk groups. Outcome measures 
include averted symptomatic infections and deaths, societal costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. 
Costs and QALYs were discounted at 4% and 1.5% annually.
RESULTS: At an assumed coverage of 50%, adding pediatric vaccination for 2- to 
17-year-olds with quadrivalent live-attenuated vaccine to the current 
vaccination program for elderly and medical high-groups with quadrivalent 
inactivated vaccine was estimated to avert, on average, 401 820 symptomatic 
cases and 72 deaths per year. Approximately half of averted symptomatic cases 
and 99% of averted deaths were prevented in other age groups than 2- to 
17-year-olds due to herd immunity. The cumulative discounted 20-year economic 
impact was 35 068 QALYs gained and €1687 million saved, that is, the 
intervention was cost-saving. This vaccination strategy had the highest 
probability of being the most cost-effective strategy considered, dominating 
pediatric strategies targeting 2- to 6-year-olds or 2- to 12-year-olds or 
strategies with trivalent inactivated vaccine.
CONCLUSION: Modeling indicates that introducing pediatric influenza vaccination 
in The Netherlands is cost-saving, reducing the influenza-related disease burden 
substantially.

OBJECTIVES: As of 2019, quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) has replaced 
trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in the national immunization program in The 
Netherlands. Target groups are individuals of 60+ years of age and those with 
chronic diseases. The objective was to estimate the incremental break-even price 
of QIV over TIV at a threshold of €20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
METHODS: An age-structured compartmental dynamic model was adapted for The 
Netherlands to assess health outcomes and associated costs of vaccinating all 
individuals at higher risk for influenza with QIV instead of TIV over the 
seasons 2010 to 2018. Influenza incidence rates were derived from a global 
database. Other parameters (probabilities, QALYs and costs) were extracted from 
the literature and applied according to Dutch guidelines. A threshold of €20 000 
per QALY was applied to estimate the incremental break-even prices of QIV versus 
TIV. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Retrospectively, vaccination with QIV instead of TIV could have 
prevented on average 9500 symptomatic influenza cases, 2130 outpatient visits, 
84 hospitalizations, and 38 deaths per year over the seasons 2010 to 2018. This 
translates into 385 QALYs and 398 life-years potentially gained. On average, 
totals of €431 527 direct and €2 388 810 indirect costs could have been saved 
each year.
CONCLUSION: Using QIV over TIV during the influenza seasons 2010 to 2018 would 
have been cost-effective at an incremental price of maximally €3.81 (95% 
confidence interval, €3.26-4.31). Sensitivity analysis showed consistent 
findings on the incremental break-even price in the same range.

OBJECTIVES: In Germany, routine influenza vaccination with quadrivalent 
influenza vaccines (QIV) is recommended and reimbursed for individuals ≥60 years 
of age and individuals with underlying chronic conditions. The present study 
examines the cost-effectiveness of a possible extension of the recommendation to 
include strategies of childhood vaccination against seasonal influenza using 
QIV.
METHODS: A dynamic transmission model was used to examine the epidemiological 
impact of different childhood vaccination strategies. The outputs were used in a 
health economic decision tree to calculate the costs per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) gained from a societal and a third-party payer (TPP) perspective. 
Strain-specific epidemiology, vaccine uptake, and vaccine efficacy data from the 
10 non-pandemic seasons from 2003/2004 to 2013/2014 were used, and cost data 
were drawn mainly from a health insurance claims data analysis and supplemented 
by estimates from literature. Uncertainty is explored via scenario, 
deterministic, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Vaccinating 2- to 9-year-olds with QIV assuming a vaccine uptake of 40% 
is cost-saving with a benefit-cost ratio of 1.66 from a societal perspective and 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €998/QALY from a TPP perspective. 
Lower and higher vaccine uptakes show marginal effects, while extending the 
target group to 2- to 17-year-olds further increases the health benefits while 
still being below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. Assuming no 
vaccine-induced herd protection has a negative effect on the cost-effectiveness 
ratio, but childhood vaccination remains cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Routine childhood vaccination against seasonal influenza in Germany 
is most likely to be cost-saving from a societal perspective and highly 
cost-effective from a TPP perspective.

OBJECTIVES: Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) are based on the value judgment 
that health outcomes (eg, quantified in quality-adjusted life-years; QALYs) are 
all equally valuable irrespective of their context. Whereas most published CEAs 
perform extensive sensitivity analysis on various parameters and assumptions, 
only rarely is the influence of the QALY-equivalence assumption on 
cost-effectiveness results investigated. We illustrate how the integration of 
alternative social value judgments in CEA can be a useful form of sensitivity 
analysis.
METHODS: Because varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccination affects 2 distinct 
diseases (varicella zoster and herpes zoster) and likely redistributes 
infections across different age groups, the program has an important equity 
dimension. We used a cost-effectiveness model and disentangled the share of 
direct protection and herd immunity within the total projected QALYs resulting 
from a 50-year childhood VZV program in the UK. We use the UK population's 
preferences for QALYs in the vaccine context to revalue QALYs accordingly.
RESULTS: Revaluing different types of QALYs for different age groups in line 
with public preferences leads to a 98% change in the projected net impact of the 
program. The QALYs gained among children through direct varicella protection 
become more important, whereas the QALYs lost indirectly through zoster in 
adults diminish in value. Weighting of vaccine-related side effects made a large 
difference.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that a sensitivity analysis in which alternative 
social value judgments about the value of health outcomes are integrated into 
CEA of vaccines is relatively straightforward and provides important additional 
information for decision makers to interpret cost-effectiveness results.

OBJECTIVES: Cost-effectiveness analysis can guide decision making about health 
interventions, but the appropriate cost-effectiveness threshold to use is 
unclear in most countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 
vaccinating girls 9 to 14 years against human papillomavirus (HPV), but over 
half the world's countries have not introduced it. This study aimed to 
investigate whether country-level decisions about HPV vaccine introduction are 
consistent with a particular cost-effectiveness threshold, and to estimate what 
that threshold may be.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of vaccinating 12-year-old girls was estimated 
in 179 countries using the Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and 
Economics (PRIME) model, together with vaccine price data from World Health 
Organization's Market Information for Access to Vaccines database. In each year 
from 2006 to 2018, countries were categorized based on (1) whether they had 
introduced HPV vaccination, and (2) whether the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio for HPV vaccine introduction fell below a certain cost-effectiveness 
threshold.
RESULTS: A cost-effectiveness threshold of 60% to 65% of GDP per capita has the 
best ability to discriminate countries that introduced vaccination, with a 
diagnostic odds ratio of about 7. For low-income countries the optimal threshold 
was lower, at 30% to 40% of GDP per capita.
CONCLUSIONS: A cost-effectiveness threshold has some ability to discriminate 
between HPV vaccine introducer and non-introducer countries, although the 
average threshold is below the widely used threshold of 1 GDP per capita. These 
results help explain the current pattern of HPV vaccine use globally. They also 
inform the extent to which cost-effectiveness thresholds proposed in the 
literature reflect countries' actual investment decisions.

Catastrophic Health Outcomes: How Can We Capture the Value of Risk Reduction?

In the last 5 years, guidelines have been developed for performing 
cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) for the economic evaluation of vaccination 
programs against infectious diseases. However, these cost-effectiveness 
guidelines do not provide specific guidance for including the value of reducing 
the risk of rare but potentially catastrophic health outcomes, such as mortality 
or long-term sequelae. Alternative economic evaluation methods, including 
extended CEA, the impact inventory, cost-benefit analyses, willingness to pay or 
the value of a statistical life, to capture the value of this risk reduction 
could provide more complete estimates of the value of vaccination programs for 
diseases with potentially catastrophic health and nonhealth outcomes. In this 
commentary, using invasive meningococcal disease as an example, we describe 
these alternative approaches along with examples to illustrate how the benefits 
of vaccination in reducing risk of catastrophic health outcomes can be valued. 
These benefits are not usually captured in CEAs that only include population 
benefits estimated as the quality-adjusted life-years gained and reduced costs 
from avoided cases.

OBJECTIVES: This cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of 4CMenB infant vaccination 
in England comprehensively considers the broad burden of serogroup B invasive 
meningococcal disease (MenB IMD), which has not been considered, or was only 
partially considered in previous CEAs.
METHODS: A review of previous MenB vaccination CEAs was conducted to identify 
aspects considered in the evaluation of costs and health outcomes of the disease 
burden of MenB IMD. To inform the model structure and comprehensive analysis, 
the aspects were grouped into 5 categories. A stepwise analysis was conducted to 
analyze the impact of each category, and the more comprehensive consideration of 
disease burden, on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: MenB IMD incidence decreased by 46.0% in infants and children 0-4 years 
old within 5 years after introduction of the program. Stepwise inclusion of the 
5 disease burden categories to a conventional narrow CEA setting reduced the 
ICER from £360 595 to £18 645-that is, considering the impact of all 5 
categories, 4CMenB infant vaccination is cost-effective at a threshold of £20 
000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: When considering comprehensively the MenB IMD burden, 4CMenB infant 
vaccination can be cost-effective, a finding contrary to previous CEAs. This 
analysis allows policy decision-makers globally to infer the impact of current 
disease burden considerations on the cost-effectiveness and the comprehensive 
assessment necessary for MenB IMD. Although this comprehensive CEA can help 
inform decision making today, it may be limited in capturing the full disease 
burden and complex interactions of health and economics of MenB IMD.

The American Diabetes Association 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 
(Standards of Care) recommends a hemoglobin A1c (A1C) of <7% (53 mmol/mol) for 
many children with type 1 diabetes (T1D), with an emphasis on target 
personalization. A higher A1C target of <7.5% may be more suitable for youth who 
cannot articulate symptoms of hypoglycemia or have hypoglycemia unawareness and 
for those who do not have access to analog insulins or advanced diabetes 
technologies or who cannot monitor blood glucose regularly. Even less stringent 
A1C targets (e.g., <8%) may be warranted for children with a history of severe 
hypoglycemia, severe morbidities, or short life expectancy. During the 
"honeymoon" period and in situations where lower mean glycemia is achievable 
without excessive hypoglycemia or reduced quality of life, an A1C <6.5% may be 
safe and effective. Here, we provide a historical perspective of A1C targets in 
pediatrics and highlight evidence demonstrating detrimental effects of 
hyperglycemia in children and adolescents, including increased likelihood of 
brain structure and neurocognitive abnormalities, microvascular and 
macrovascular complications, long-term effects, and increased mortality. We also 
review data supporting a decrease over time in overall severe hypoglycemia risk 
for youth with T1D, partly associated with the use of newer insulins and 
devices, and weakened association between lower A1C and severe hypoglycemia 
risk. We present common barriers to achieving glycemic targets in pediatric 
diabetes and discuss some strategies to address them. We aim to raise awareness 
within the community on Standards of Care updates that impact this crucial goal 
in pediatric diabetes management.

BACKGROUND: Smoking, obesity and alcohol abuse greatly affect mortality and 
exhibit a distinct time dynamic, with their prevalence and associated mortality 
rates increasing and (eventually) declining over time. Their combined impact on 
secular trends in life expectancy is unknown but is relevant for understanding 
these trends. We therefore estimate the combined impact of smoking, obesity and 
alcohol on life-expectancy trends in Europe.
METHODS: We used estimated national age-specific smoking-, obesity- and 
alcohol-attributable mortality fractions for 30 European countries by sex, 
1990-2014, which we aggregated multiplicatively to obtain lifestyle-attributable 
mortality. We estimated potential gains in life expectancy by eliminating 
lifestyle-attributable mortality and compared past trends in life expectancy at 
birth (e0) with and without lifestyle-attributable mortality. We examined all 
countries combined, by region and individually.
RESULTS: Among men, the combined impact of smoking, obesity and alcohol on e0 
declined from 6.6 years in 1990 to 5.8 years in 2014, mainly due to declining 
smoking-attributable mortality. Among women, the combined impact increased from 
1.9 to 2.3 years due to mortality increases in all three lifestyle-related 
factors. The observed increase in e0 over the 1990-2014 period was 5.0 years for 
men and 4.0 years for women. After excluding lifestyle-attributable mortality, 
this increase would have been 4.2-4.3 years for both men and women.
CONCLUSION: Without the combined impact of smoking, obesity and alcohol, the 
increase over time in life expectancy at birth would have been smaller among men 
but larger among women, resulting in a stable increase in e0, parallel for men 
and women.
