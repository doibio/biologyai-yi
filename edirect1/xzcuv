We investigated the therapeutic potential of polymerized anthocyanin (PA) on a 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model in mice. C57BL/6 mice were fed a 
high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks to establish the NAFLD mouse model and randomly 
divided into four groups: control diet (con), NAFLD mice treated with saline 
(NAFLD), NAFLD mice treated with PA (PA), and NAFLD mice treated with orlistat 
(Orlistat) for four weeks. Mice were euthanized at the end of the four weeks. 
Total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels were estimated, and 
pathological changes in the liver, white adipose tissue, and signaling pathways 
related to lipid metabolism were evaluated. Results revealed that the body, 
liver, and white fat weight of the NAFLD group was significantly increased 
compared to that of the con group, while that of the PA group showed significant 
reduction. NAFLD led to an increase in blood lipids in mice (except for HDL). 
Conversely, PA effectively reduced TC and LDL-C. Compared to the control group, 
the degree of steatosis in the mice of PA group was decreased. Moreover, PA also 
regulated the NAFLD signaling pathway. In agreement with improved lipid 
deposition, PA supplementation inhibited the activation of inflammatory 
pathways, depressing oxidative stress through increased antioxidant levels, and 
increasing β-oxidation to inhibit mitochondrial dysfunction. Taken together, our 
results demonstrate that PA can improve the liver function of NAFLD mice, 
regulating blood lipids, reducing liver-fat accumulation, and regulating lipid 
metabolism.

The use of interferon α-2 in combination with thymosin α-1 shows higher 
anti-cancer effect in comparison when both are used individually because of 
their synergistic effects. In this study we produced an important human 
interferon α-2-thymosin α-1 (IFNα2-Tα1) fusion protein with probable 
pharmaceutical properties coupled to its high-level expression, 
characterization, and study of its biological activity. The IFNα2-Tα1 fusion 
gene was constructed by over-lap extension PCR and expressed in Escherichia coli 
expression system. The expression of IFNα2-Tα1 fusion protein was optimized to 
higher level and its maximum expression was obtained in modified terrific broth 
medium when lactose was used as inducer. The fusion protein was refolded into 
its native biologically active form with maximum yield of 83.14% followed by 
purification with ∼98% purity and 69% final yield. A band of purified IFNα2-Tα1 
fusion protein equal to ∼23 kDa was observed on 12 % SDS-PAGE gel. The integrity 
of IFNα2-Tα1 fusion protein was confirmed by western blot analysis and secondary 
structure was assessed by CD spectroscopy. When IFNα2-Tα1 fusion protein was 
subjected to its biological activity analysis it was observed that it exhibits 
both IFNα2 & Tα1 activities as well as significantly higher anticancer activity 
as compared to IFNα-2 alone.

BACKGROUND: Health resources are limited, which means spending should be focused 
on the people, places and programs that matter most. Choosing the mix of 
programs to maximize a health outcome is termed allocative efficiency. Here, we 
extend the methodology of allocative efficiency to answer the question of how 
resources should be distributed among different geographic regions.
METHODS: We describe a novel geographical optimization algorithm, which has been 
implemented as an extension to the Optima HIV model. This algorithm identifies 
an optimal funding of services and programs across regions, such as multiple 
countries or multiple districts within a country. The algorithm consists of 
three steps: (1) calibrating the model to each region, (2) determining the 
optimal allocation for each region across a range of different budget levels, 
and (3) finding the budget level in each region that minimizes the outcome (such 
as reducing new HIV infections and/or HIV-related deaths), subject to the 
constraint of fixed total budget across all regions. As a case study, we applied 
this method to determine an illustrative allocation of HIV program funding 
across three representative oblasts (regions) in Ukraine (Mykolayiv, Poltava, 
and Zhytomyr) to minimize the number of new HIV infections.
RESULTS: Geographical optimization was found to identify solutions with better 
outcomes than would be possible by considering region-specific allocations 
alone. In the case of Ukraine, prior to optimization (i.e. with status quo 
spending), a total of 244,000 HIV-related disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
were estimated to occur from 2016 to 2030 across the three oblasts. With 
optimization within (but not between) oblasts, this was estimated to be reduced 
to 181,000. With geographical optimization (i.e., allowing reallocation of funds 
between oblasts), this was estimated to be further reduced to 173,000.
CONCLUSIONS: With the increasing availability of region- and even facility-level 
data, geographical optimization is likely to play an increasingly important role 
in health economic decision making. Although the largest gains are typically due 
to reallocating resources to the most effective interventions, especially 
treatment, further gains can be achieved by optimally reallocating resources 
between regions. Finally, the methods described here are not restricted to 
geographical optimization, and can be applied to other problems where competing 
resources need to be allocated with constraints, such as between diseases.

BACKGROUND: Aortic valve sparing surgery (AVS), in combination with aortic cusp 
repair (ACR), still raises many questions about the increased surgical 
complexity and applicability for patients with pure aortic valve regurgitation 
(AR). The aim of this study was to investigate our long-term outcomes and 
predictors of recurrent AR (> 2+) after AVS and reconstructive cusp surgery.
METHODS: We reviewed data of 81 patients who underwent AVS (a reimplantation 
technique) with concomitant ACR for AR and or dilatation of the aortic root at 
our institution during the period from April 2004 to October 2016. On 
preoperative echocardiography, the majority of the patients, 70 (86.4%) 
presented with severe AR grade (> 3+) and 28 (34.5%) of the patients had the 
bicuspid phenotype. Time to event analysis (long-term survival, freedom from 
reoperation, and recurrence of AR > 2+) was performed with the Kaplan-Meier 
method. Multivariate Cox regression risk analysis was performed to identify 
independent predictors of recurrent AR (> 2+). The mean follow-up was 
5.3 ± 3.3 years and 100% complete.
RESULTS: The in-hospital (30-day) mortality rate after elective surgery was 
1.2%. The overall actuarial survival rates were 92.9 ± 3.1% and 90.4 ± 3.9% at 
five and 10 years, respectively. Actuarial freedom from recurrent AR (> 2+) was 
83.7 ± 4.5% within the cohort at five and 10 years. The cumulative freedom from 
all causes of cardiac reoperation was 94.2 ± 2.8% within the cohort at 10 years. 
Neither bleeding nor thromboembolic or permanent neurologic events were reported 
during follow-up. By multivariate analysis, independent predictors of reccurent 
AR (> 2+) were an effective height lower than 9 mm (p= 0.02) and intraoperative 
residual mild AR (p= 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: AVS with ACR, combined in a systematic fashion, is a safe and 
reproducible option with low risk of long-term valve related events and normal 
life expectancy for patients with pure aortic regurgitation. The competent 
aortic valve and effective height, not lower than 9 mm intraoperatively, are 
mandatory to achieve long-lasting AV competency.

Grb2-associated regulator of Erk/MAPK (GAREM), is an adaptor protein related to 
the several cell growth factor receptor-signaling. The GAREM family has two 
subtypes, GAREM1 and GAREM2, both encoded in the human and mouse genome. Recent 
genome-wide research identified GAREM2 as a candidate of neurodegenerative 
diseases. Here, we use knockout (KO) mice to show the role of GAREM2, that is 
highly expressed in the brain. According to the comprehensive behavioral 
battery, they exhibited less anxiety both in elevated plus maze and open field 
tests, mildly increased social approaching behavior in the reciprocal social 
interaction test, and longer latency to immobility in the tail suspension test 
as compared to wild-type (WT). Additionally, the extension of neurites in the 
primary cultured neurons was suppressed in ones derived from GAREM2 KO mice. 
Furthermore, we also identified Intersectin, as a binding partner of GAREM2 in 
this study. Intersectin is also a multi-domain adaptor protein that regulates 
endocytosis and cell signaling, which can potentially alter the subcellular 
localization of GAREM2. The important molecules, such as the neurotrophin 
receptor and Erk family, that are involved in the signaling pathway of the 
neural cell growth in the mouse brain, have been reported to participate in 
emotional behavior. As GAREM plays a role in the cellular growth factor receptor 
signaling pathway, GAREM2 may have a common role related to the transduction of 
Erk signaling in the higher brain functions.

INTRODUCTION: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative 
disorder with no known cure and with an average life expectancy of 3-5 years 
post diagnosis. The use of complementary medicine such as medicinal cannabis in 
search for a potential treatment or cure is common in ALS. Preclinical studies 
have demonstrated the efficacy of cannabinoids in extending the survival and 
slowing of disease progression in animal models with ALS. There are anecdotal 
reports of cannabis slowing disease progression in persons with ALS (pALS) and 
that cannabis alleviated the symptoms of spasticity and pain. However, a 
clinical trial in pALS with these objectives has not been conducted.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Efficacy of cannabis-based Medicine Extract in slowing 
the disease pRogression of Amyotrophic Lateral sclerosis or motor neurone 
Disease trial is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled cannabis trial 
in pALS conducted at the Gold Coast University Hospital, Australia. The 
investigational product will be a cannabis-based medicine extract (CBME) 
supplied by CannTrust Inc., Canada, with a 
high-cannabidiol-low-tetrahydrocannabinol concentration. A total of 30 pALS with 
probable or definite ALS diagnosis based on the El Escorial criteria, with a 
symptom duration of <2 years, age between 25 and 75years and with at least 70% 
forced vital capacity (FVC) will be treated for 6 months. The primary objective 
of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of CBME compared with placebo in 
slowing the disease progression measured by differences in mean ALS Functional 
Rating Scale-Revised and FVC score between the groups at the end of treatment. 
The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CBME by 
summarising adverse events, the effects of CBME on spasticity, pain, weight loss 
and quality of life assessed by the differences in mean Numeric Rating Scale for 
spasticity and Numeric Rating Scale for pain, percentage of total weight loss 
and ALS specific quality of life-Revised questionnaire.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the local Institutional 
Review Board. The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed 
journal.

We evaluate methods to calculate the economic value of protected areas derived 
from the improved mental health of visitors. A conservative global estimate 
using quality-adjusted life years, a standard measure in health economics, is 
US$6 trillion p.a. This is an order of magnitude greater than the global value 
of protected area tourism, and two to three orders greater than global aggregate 
protected area management agency budgets. Future research should: refine this 
estimate using more precise methods; consider interactions between health and 
conservation policies and budgets at national scales; and examine links between 
personalities and protected area experiences at individual scale.

Anti-mucin1 (MUC1) antibodies have long been used clinically in cancer diagnosis 
and therapy and specific bindings of some of them are known to be dependent on 
the differential glycosylation of MUC1. However, a systematic comparison of the 
binding specificities of anti-MUC1 antibodies was not previously conducted. 
Here, a total of 20 glycopeptides including the tandem repeat unit of MUC1, 
APPAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPAHGV with GalNAc (Tn-antigen), Galβ1-3GalNAc (T-antigen), 
NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAc (sialyl-T-antigen), or NeuAcα2-6GalNAc 
(sialyl-Tn-antigen) at each threonine or serine residue were prepared by a 
combination of chemical glycopeptide synthesis and enzymatic extension of 
carbohydrate chains. These glycopeptides were tested by the enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for their capacity to bind 13 monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) known to be specific for MUC1. The results indicated that anti-MUC1 mAbs 
have diverse specificities but can be classified into a few characteristic 
groups based on their binding pattern toward glycopeptides in some cases having 
a specific glycan at unique glycosylation sites. Because the clinical 
significance of some of these antibodies was already established, the structural 
features identified by these antibodies as revealed in the present study should 
provide useful information relevant to their further clinical use and the 
biological understanding of MUC1.

Abrin is a highly toxic protein produced by Abrus precatorius. Exposure to 
abrin, either through accident or by act of terrorism, poses a significant risk 
to human health and safety. Abrin functions as a ribosome-inactivating protein 
by depurinating the 28S rRNA and inhibits protein synthesis. It is a potent 
toxin warfare agent. There are no antidotes available for abrin intoxication. 
Supportive care is the only option for treatment of abrin exposure. It is 
becoming increasingly important to develop countermeasures for abrin by 
developing pre- and post-exposure therapy. The aim of this study is to screen 
certain pharmaceutical compounds for their chemoprotective properties against 
abrin toxicity in vivo in BALB/c male mice. Twenty-one compounds having either 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cyto-protective properties or combination of 
them, were screened and administered as 1h pre-treatment followed by exposure of 
lethal dose (2×LD50, intraperitoneally) of abrin. To assess the protective 
efficacy of the compounds, survival and body weight was monitored. Fifteen 
compounds extended the survival time of animals significantly, as compared to 
abrin. The following five of these compounds, namely: Epicatechin-3-gallate, 
Gallic Acid, Lipoic Acid, GSH and Indomethacin extended the life time ranging 
from 6 to 9 days. These compounds also attenuated the abrin induced inflammation 
and enzymes associated with liver function, but none of them could prevent abrin 
induced lethality. The compounds offering extension of life could be useful to 
provide a time-window for other supportive treatment and could also be used as 
combinatorial therapy with other medical countermeasures against abrin induced 
lethality.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) predominantly affects African-Americans (AAs) in the 
United States (US). Due to increasing life expectancy in developed countries, 
SCD-associated cardiomyopathy is typically seen in adults. The aim of this study 
was to distinguish hospitalization for this phenotype from traditional heart 
failure (HF) in AAs. We used the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database to 
identify HF hospitalizations in AAs between 2005 and 2014 and stratified them 
according to SCD status. We compared the characteristics and outcomes before and 
after matching in a 1:3 ratio for age, gender, insurance, smoking status and 
admission year. Amongst the 1,195,718 HF admissions in AAs, SCD accounted for 
7835. The age (mean ± SD) in the SCD cohort was significantly younger (45.66 ± 
13.2) vs non-SCD (64.8 ± 15.2), p<0.001. SCD adults had significantly higher 
rates of pulmonary hypertension (PH), deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary 
embolism while non-SCD adults had higher rates of cardiogenic shock and 
respiratory failure requiring intubation. The national hospitalization rate for 
HF in AAs increased from 151 to 257 per million between 2005 and 2011 before 
declining to 241 per million in 2014. There was a decrease in in-hospital 
mortality in AAs from 4.8% in 2005 to 3.6% in 2014. We also identified 
independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in SCD with HF. In conclusion, 
we described hospitalizations for an emerging heart failure phenotype in AAs. 
Although there is a national decreasing rate of HF hospitalizations in the US, 
this may not be reflective of the AA population.

Self-expanding metals stent are used for recanalization of malignant CAO. 
Fracture of such a stent has been described. This prompts its removal. However 
removal of a metal stent is difficult and can be hazardous. Due to this US FDA 
advisory was released against their insertion in benign diseases where long life 
expectancy can expose the patients to the complications of prolonged indwelling 
time of these stents. We describe a case of adenoid cystic carcinoma who 
required SEMS placement for tracheal obstruction. However, stent fracture 
developed soon after its insertion causing patient to cough out stent pieces 
multiple times. In view of the challenge associated with removal of metal stent 
fixed to the tracheal walls at its proximal and distal ends, the stent was left 
in-situ. Patient has tolerated the fractured stent for 1-year and remains on 
follow-up without any complication or adverse event. This illustrates the 
long-term tolerance and safety of a fractured stent and helps to allay anxiety 
associated with this complication.

PURPOSE: A randomized phase III trial demonstrated that gemcitabine plus 
cisplatin (GP) prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival compared 
with fluorouracil plus cisplatin (FP) as first-line chemotherapy in patients 
with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The cost-effectiveness analysis 
was designed to identify the economic option for metastatic NPC from a Chinese 
societal perspective.
METHODS: We established a Markov model that involved three health states 
representing the stages of disease to simulate therapy. Survival data of 
clinical outcomes were derived from the trial and adjusted to quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs). Transition probabilities and health utilities were obtained 
from the clinical trial and published literatures. The cost-effective strategy 
was estimated for these treatments using a willing-to-pay (WTP) threshold. A 
one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the influences of 
parameters.
RESULTS: GP treatment group produced a gain of 0.37 QALYs with an incremental 
cost of $2520.80, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
$6812.97 per QALY, compared with FP treatment ($15,530.96 versus $13,010.16). 
The ICER was lower than the accepted WTP threshold, which was 3 times gross 
domestic product per capita of China ($25,749 per QALY).
CONCLUSION: GP regimen is more cost-effective compared with FP regimen as the 
first-line treatment for Chinese patients with metastatic NPC.

OBJECTIVE: To carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis of the use of Neuropad as 
a screening test for diabetic neuropathy together with the standard care tool, 
the 10-g monofilament, in people with diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model 
was developed to assess the impact on costs and outcomes of using Neuropad as a 
test for diabetic neuropathy (1) as a complement to the standard test, the 10-g 
monofilament (Neuropad + monofilament vs. monofilament); and (2) as a substitute 
for the monofilament (Neuropad vs. monofilament); from the healthcare provider 
perspective. The time horizon was 3 years. Data on costs and health gains were 
extracted from the literature. The incremental cost-utility ratio was 
calculated. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also 
performed.
RESULTS: Compared with standard care, Neuropad, in combination with the 10-g 
monofilament tool, is the dominant strategy as it leads to higher health gains 
and lower costs. In practice, compared with using the monofilament alone, 
performing both tests would lead to a savings of £1049.26 per patient and 0.044 
QALY gain. Results were found to be consistent across the sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Using both screening tools (Neuropad + monofilament) is a 
cost-effective strategy and the dominant alternative, when compared against 
using the 10-g monofilament alone. The results would be of special relevance in 
the early detection of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and to ensure the 
efficient allocation of resources and, thus, the sustainability of healthcare 
systems.

Introduction: For late stage organ failure patients, transplantation is the best 
option to increase life expectancy with a superior quality of life. 
Unfortunately, after transplantation many patients are at risk of cellular and 
antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). The latter is initiated by donor specific 
antibodies (DSA) which depend on the actions of B cells, T follicular helper 
(Tfh) cells and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells that are present in the 
germinal center of lymphoid organs.Areas covered: In this overview paper, we 
discuss the biology and function of Tfh and Tfr cells in lymphoid tissues, 
transplanted organs and their circulating counterparts. We report on their 
relevance to alloimmunity and on the effects of immunosuppressive drugs on these 
immunocompetent cell populations.Expert opinion: Growing knowledge about the 
actions of Tfh and Tfr allows for a better understanding of the immunological 
mechanisms of ABMR after organ transplantation. This understanding feeds the 
hypothesis that immunosuppressive drugs targeting the actions of Tfh cells have 
huge therapeutic potential. This new concept in the treatment of the humoral 
rejection response will improve graft and patient survival after organ 
transplantation.

Introduction: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) with C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency 
(C1-INH-HAE) is a rare disease that manifests with cutaneous and/or submucosal 
swellings due to uncontrolled activation of the contact/kinin system. Attacks 
recur with unpredictable frequency and severity, laryngeal edema is potentially 
lethal, and the disease burden may severely disrupt patients' lives.Areas 
covered: This review provides an overview of lanadelumab, a human monoclonal 
antibody targeted against plasma kallikrein that was recently approved for 
prevention of symptoms in C1-INH-HAE.Expert opinion: The phase III HELP Study 
demonstrated the efficacy of lanadelumab in reducing HAE attacks. These positive 
results are being further confirmed in the open-label extension study. This 
agent addresses some of the limitations of existing prophylactic options as 
tolerability issues, the need for intravenous administration and frequent 
dosing. Therefore, lanadelumab can profoundly improve the quality of life of 
patients with C1-INH-HAE.

BACKGROUND: The small-molecule phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor apremilast 
modulates cytokines that are up-regulated in Behçet's syndrome. In a phase 2 
trial involving patients with Behçet's syndrome, apremilast reduced the 
incidence and severity of oral ulcers. Data on the efficacy and safety of 
apremilast in patients with Behçet's syndrome who had active oral ulcers and had 
not previously received biologic agents are limited.
METHODS: In a phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients who 
had Behçet's syndrome with active oral ulcers but no major organ involvement to 
receive either apremilast at a dose of 30 mg or placebo, administered orally, 
twice daily for 12 weeks, followed by a 52-week extension phase. The primary end 
point was the area under the curve (AUC) for the total number of oral ulcers 
during the 12-week placebo-controlled period (with lower values indicating fewer 
ulcers). There were 13 secondary end points, including complete response of oral 
ulcers, change from baseline in pain associated with oral ulcers, disease 
activity, and change from baseline in the Behçet's Disease Quality of Life score 
(range, 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater impairment in quality of 
life). Safety was also assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 207 patients underwent randomization (104 patients to the 
apremilast group and 103 to the placebo group). The AUC for the number of oral 
ulcers was 129.5 for apremilast, as compared with 222.1 for placebo 
(least-squares mean difference, -92.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], -130.6 to 
-54.6; P<0.001). The change from baseline in the Behçet's Disease Quality of 
Life score was -4.3 points in the apremilast group, as compared with -1.2 points 
in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, -3.1 points; 95% CI, -4.9 
to -1.3). Adverse events with apremilast included diarrhea, nausea, and 
headache.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet's syndrome, 
apremilast resulted in a greater reduction in the number of oral ulcers than 
placebo but was associated with adverse events, including diarrhea, nausea, and 
headache. (Funded by Celgene; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02307513.).

BACKGROUND: Obesity in childhood is associated with adverse health outcomes and 
complications throughout the life-span of a child. Available evidence suggests a 
dramatic increase in childhood obesity in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) over the past 
two decades. The health risks associated with obesity/overweight are 
particularly problematic in children due to the potential for long-term health 
concerns. The researchers propose to conduct a systematic scoping review to map 
evidence on the burden and distribution of childhood obesity in SSA.
METHODS: The study will be guided by the scoping review framework proposed by 
Arksey and O'Malley. A comprehensive literature search will be performed in the 
following electronic databases: PubMed, Web of Science, African Index Medicus, 
and CINAHL with full text via EBSCOhost platform. Primary studies both published 
in peer-reviewed journals and gray literature such as unpublished studies, 
thesis, and studies in press addressing the research topic will be included. One 
reviewer will conduct title screening, and the results will be exported to 
Mendeley Desktop library. Two independent reviewers will perform both abstract 
and full article screening in parallel as well as data extraction from eligible 
studies. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis: 
Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) will be utilized to present the study 
findings of the proposed scoping review. NVivo version 11.0 will be used to 
extract the relevant outcomes from the included studies, a content thematic 
analysis performed, and the results reported using a narrative approach. The 
Mixed Method Quality Appraisal Tool Version 2018 will be used to assess the 
methodological quality of all included studies.
DISCUSSION: We anticipate that the proposed study will contribute to the 
existing body of knowledge on childhood obesity, identify gaps in knowledge on 
the topic, inform future research direction, and provide evidence-based 
information to strengthen health systems and policies on childhood obesity 
towards achieving the WHO global target of halting the rise in obesity by 2025.

The benefits of family planning (FP) use in Benin: an application of the 
Demographic Dividend Model (DemDiv).

Dansou J(1).

Author information:
(1)Pan African University Institute for Life and Earth Sciences, University of 
Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria.

Background: Despite the increasing interest in improving access to and 
utilization of family planning (FP) methods, contraceptives prevalence rates 
remain low in Benin, and its benefits are not well studied. This study projected 
FP's benefits for maternal health and child survival over the Sustainable 
Development Goals period. Methods: The Demographic Dividend Model created by the 
Health Policy Project using a large range of data was applied based exclusively 
on assumptions on FP policy options between 2015 and 2030. Results: It was found 
that, under the base scenario with no improvements in FP, education and economic 
variables, however unrealistic, the number of children per Beninese woman would 
be the same in 2030 as it was in 2015 - about 4.5 children per woman. Benin's 
age structure would remain very young and be dominated by dependents. But, 
FP-scenarios of improvements in contraceptive variables alone showed a negative 
and linear relationship between FP use and maternal and child deaths. Under the 
optimistic scenario, increasing access to and use of FP alone from 7.9% (2015) 
to 33.95% (2030) will save lives of about 200,000 under five year children and 
10,000 mothers by 2030. In addition, the average number of children per woman 
will fall to 3.5 increasing female life expectancy by 5 years. Benin's age 
structure will be balanced with more working age people. The country will also 
record an increase in its human development indicator. Conclusion: To accelerate 
progresses towards improvement of maternal health and child survival, and get on 
track in meeting related health targets of SDGs, the present study revealed the 
importance of strengthening actions toward access to and use of FP in Benin 
Republic. There is also a need to strengthen education and economic policies to 
successfully harness the demographic dividend.

The inherited disorders of hemoglobin, which include sickle cell disease and 
thalassemias, are the most common and widespread distributed monogenic 
disorders. Due to a selective advantage in malaria regions, these hemoglobin 
defects are particularly frequent in Africa, Asia, or in the Mediterranean 
areas, where malaria was endemic until the last century. In recent decades, the 
globalization of migration has contributed to generate multiethnic European 
societies. Due to migration from countries or regions with high hemoglobinopathy 
frequencies such as Africa, Middle East, or Asia, large numbers of patients with 
these disorders are living in almost every European country today. Furthermore, 
the numbers are increasing because of increasing refugee flows toward Europe. 
Additional requirements are the development of European recommendations and 
guidelines for diagnosis and effective therapeutic approaches. These, together 
with the advancement of clinical trials using new drugs and therapeutic 
procedures could ameliorate the quality of life of patients affected with these 
diseases and increase their life expectancy. Lastly, coordinated efforts should 
be made to develop diagnostic pathways for thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies, 
in order to plan interventions, including prenatal diagnosis and cure. For these 
reasons, the development of new tools to reliably diagnose anemias is urgently 
needed and fits well with the needs of personalized medicine. In the last 15 
years, hematology research has made many big leaps forward. Our general aim will 
be to solve several hematologic problems using these new approaches. We expect 
that the development of such a diagnostic tool will improve timely diagnosis 
throughout Europe, especially in those countries where it is difficult to gain 
access to "classical" diagnostic tests.

BACKGROUND: African American life expectancy at age 65 is about 2 years less 
than that of Caucasians, but by age 85, African Americans may have a longevity 
advantage. One possible explanation for this cross-over effect is that African 
Americans who make it to the oldest ages have done so by handling stressful 
contextual and health disadvantages. The purpose of this study was to examine 
possible within group cohort differences that lead to exceptional longevity 
among older African Americans.
METHODS: Data came from three cohorts of older African Americans: the Carolina 
African American Twin Study of Aging (CAATSA), the Baltimore Study of Black 
Aging-Patterns of Cognitive Aging (BSBA-PCA), and the Study of Longevity and 
Stress in African American Families (SOLSAA). Of the 533 participants, we 
compared two age cohorts (60-79 and 80+) with an average age of 73.2 (SD = 8.33) 
and 26.3% are men. Variables included measures of stress, depression, coping, 
cognition, and health indicators.
RESULTS: The variance for depression and average peak expiratory flow (APEF) was 
significantly larger for the older cohort but after controlling for demographic 
factors, the measure of depressive symptoms was not. The Alpha Span test showed 
a significant difference with the older cohort having larger variances after 
controlling for demographic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that there are changes in the characteristics 
of who makes it to later life, but counter to our hypothesis, there was greater 
variability in the oldest group relative to the younger.

BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding the optimal surveillance strategy 
following local excision of T1NX rectal adenocarcinoma. This study aims to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of surveillance strategies for locally excised 
T1NX rectal adenocarcinoma based on histopathologic and local staging risk 
factors.
METHODS: A Markov model with 10-year follow-up was developed for 
cost-effectiveness analysis of high-, medium-, and low-intensity surveillance 
strategies after local excision of T1NX rectal adenocarcinoma. Literature review 
and expert consensus were utilized to populate state/transition probabilities 
and rewards. Based on this data, 87% of T1NX patients undergoing local excision 
were low risk. Healthcare utilization costs were based on Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services data. The primary outcomes were costs in 2018 US dollars 
and effectiveness in life-years presented as net monetary benefit and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Net monetary benefit for low-, medium-, and high-intensity surveillance 
strategies ($393,117.00, $397,978.80, and $397,290.00) shows medium-intensity 
surveillance to be optimal. One-way sensitivity analysis shows medium-intensity 
surveillance to be optimal when the cohort is 73-94% low risk. High-intensity 
surveillance is preferred when less than 73% of the cohort is low risk. 
Low-intensity surveillance is preferred when greater than 94% is low risk. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis of the base-case shows medium-intensity 
surveillance is the optimal strategy for 51.5% of the iterations performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Medium-intensity surveillance is the most cost-effective 
surveillance strategy for locally excised T1NX rectal adenocarcinoma in a 
clinically representative population model.
