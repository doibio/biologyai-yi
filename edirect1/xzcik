The time-dependent response of structural materials dominates our aging 
infrastructure's life expectancy and has important resilience implications. For 
calcium-silicate-hydrates, the glue of cement, nanoscale mechanisms underlying 
time-dependent phenomena are complex and remain poorly understood. This 
complexity originates in part from the inherent difficulty in studying nanoscale 
longtime phenomena in atomistic simulations. Herein, we propose a three-staged 
incremental stress-marching technique to overcome such limitations. The first 
stage unravels a stretched exponential relaxation, which is ubiquitous in glassy 
systems. When fully relaxed, the material behaves viscoelastically upon further 
loading, which is described by the standard solid model. By progressively 
increasing the interlayer water, the time-dependent response of 
calcium-silicate-hydrates exhibits a transition from viscoelastic to logarithmic 
creep. These findings bridge the gap between atomistic simulations and 
nanomechanical experimental measurements and pave the way for the design of 
reduced aging construction materials and other disordered systems such as 
metallic and oxide glasses.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) can promote tissue protection following injury, 
in part by modulating inflammatory cell responses. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the potential tissue protective properties of encapsulated MSCs 
(eMSC) in an organotypic injury model induced by fibronectin culture. MSC were 
encapsulated in alginate beads containing a network of nanopores, which 
segregate the cells from the extracapsular milieu, while still permitting 
diffusion into and out of the capsule. An increase in blood brain barrier 
permeability during pathological conditions permits the influx of blood plasma 
constituents that can be quite harmful to surrounding tissues. In particular, 
increased concentrations of fibronectin have been shown in a number of diseases 
and CNS traumas, co-localizing in areas of activated microglia. We observed over 
a 14-day period, a consistent increase in OHC degradation in the presence of 
fibronectin measured by a significant decrease in slice area, the breakdown in 
OHC pyramidal layers, and consistent cell death over the culture period. 
Microglial ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA-1) expression 
remained elevated throughout the culture period with the majority found within 
the pyramidal layers. When eMSC were added to the cultures, a significant 
decrease in OHC degradation was observed as reflected by a reduction in OHC area 
shrinkage and in the amount of cell death. In the presence of eMSC, pyramidal 
layer structure was maintained and axonal extension from the periphery of the 
OHCs was observed. Therefore, MSC, delivered in a nanoporous alginate matrix, 
can modulate responses to injury by reversing fibronectin-induced OHC 
degradation.

OBJECTIVES: To explore in a sample of medical oncology outpatients and their 
nominated support persons (SPs): (1) the relative influence of pain, 
consciousness and life extension on end-of-life choices using a discrete choice 
experiment (DCE); (2) the extent to which SPs can predict the choices of index 
patients and (3) whether having a previous end-of-life discussion was associated 
with dyad agreement.
METHODS: Adult medical oncology patients and their SPs were approached for 
consent to complete a survey containing a DCE. Participants chose between three 
unlabelled care scenarios characterised by three attributes: pain (mild, 
moderate or severe), consciousness (some, half or most of time) and extension of 
life (1, 2 or 3 weeks). Respondents selected (1) most-preferred and (2) 
least-preferred scenarios within each question. SPs answered the same questions 
but from patient's perspective.
RESULTS: A total of 110 patients and 64 SPs responded overall (42 matched 
patient-SP dyads). For patients, pain was the most influential predictor of 
most- and least-preferred scenarios (z = 12.5 and z = 12.9). For SPs, pain was 
the only significant predictor of most and least-preferred scenarios (z = 9.7 
and z = 11.5). Dyad agreement was greater for choices about least- (69%) 
compared to most-preferred scenarios (55%). Agreement was slightly higher for 
dyads reporting a previous EOL discussion (68 versus 48%; p = 0.065).
CONCLUSION: Patients and SPs place significant value on avoiding severe pain 
when making end-of-life choices, over and above level of consciousness or life 
extension. People's views about end-of-life scenarios they most as well as least 
prefer should be sought.

China.

The cladoceran Moina macrocopa was used as test animal to investigate the 
effects of ibuprofen concentrations (0, 0.45, 0.9, 1.8, 3.6, 7.2 and 14.4 
mg·L-1) on its life table demographic parameters under low (0.5×106 cells·mL-1), 
medium (1.0×106 cells·mL-1), and high (2.0×106 cells·mL-1) densities of 
Scenedesmus obliquus. The results showed that at low and high food levels, 
ibuprofen concentration significantly affected the intrinsic rate of population 
increase and the life expectancy of M. macrocopa, respectively. At all the three 
food levels, however, ibuprofen concentration did not significantly affect the 
generation time, net and gross reproduction rate of M. macrocopa. Compared with 
the controls, the intrinsic rate of population increase of M. macrocopaexposed 
to ibuprofen at 0.45, 0.9, 3.6 and 14.4 mg·L-1 was significantly decreased at 
low food level. At high food level, the life expectancy at hatching of M. 
macrocopa exposed to ibuprofen at 3.6 and 14.4 mg·L-1 was significantly 
increased. The results indicated that at low food level, certain concentrations 
of ibuprofen had negative effect on the population growth of M. macrocopa, which 
disappeared at medium and high food levels. At high food level, ibuprofen had 
positive effect on the survival of M. macrocopa, which disappeared at low and 
medium food levels. The effects of ibuprofen concentration on demographic 
parameters of M. macrocopa were dependent on food levels.

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of new treatment strategies are increasingly 
reported. This can be a part of a clinical trial or as a separate study. 
Governments and healthcare payers frequently require a CEA to decide whether a 
new treatment strategy will be reimbursed. CEA is a framework to assess the 
effectiveness and costs of a new treatment strategy (e.g. a drug or 
intervention) when compared with a reference strategy. Effectiveness is often 
measured in life-years or quality-adjusted life-years, whereas costs consist of 
direct costs (the costs of the treatment), induced costs (downstream costs and 
cost offsets) and indirect costs. In this statistical primer, the rationale for 
assessing the economic consequences of new therapies is explained, followed by 
the fundamental concepts of CEAs, the different types of CEAs and an 
introduction to interpretation of CEAs. Finally, a real-world example of a CEA 
is discussed, comparing cost-effectiveness of transcatheter versus surgical 
aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis at intermediate 
surgical risk.

Nitrate Supplement Benefits Contractile Forces in Fatigued but Not Unfatigued 
Muscle.

KINGDOM.

PURPOSE: Evidence suggests dietary nitrate supplementation enhances 
low-frequency (≤20 Hz) involuntary, but not voluntary, forces in unfatigued 
human muscle. We investigated the hypotheses that nitrate supplementation would 
also attenuate low-frequency fatigue and the loss of explosive voluntary forces 
in fatigued conditions.
METHODS: In a counterbalanced double-blinded order, 17 male participants 
completed two experimental trials after 7 d of dietary supplementation with 
either nitrate-rich (NIT) or nitrate-depleted (PLA) beetroot juice. Each trial 
consisted of measuring isometric knee extension forces during a series of 
explosive maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) and involuntary tetanic 
contractions (at 10, 20 50, and 100 Hz) in unfatigued conditions, followed by a 
fatigue protocol of 60 MVC and a repeat of the tetanic contractions immediately 
after the 60 MVC.
RESULTS: In unfatigued conditions, there was no effect of NIT on any of the 
measured dependent variables, including maximal voluntary force, explosive 
impulse, and tetanic peak forces or peak rate of force developments at any 
frequency. In contrast, the percentage decline in explosive voluntary impulse 
from the first to the last 6 MVC in the fatigue protocol was lower in NIT (51.1% 
± 13.9%) than in PLA (57.3% ± 12.4%; P = 0.039; d = 0.51). Furthermore, 
low-frequency fatigue determined via the percentage decline in the 20/50-Hz 
ratio was attenuated in NIT for tetanic peak force (NIT: 12.3% ± 12.0% vs PLA: 
17.0% ± 10.1%; P = 0.110; d = 0.46) and tetanic peak rate force development 
(NIT: 12.3% ± 10.4% vs PLA: 20.3% ± 9.5%; P = 0.011; d = 0.83).
CONCLUSIONS: Nitrate supplementation reduced the decline in explosive voluntary 
forces during a fatiguing protocol and attenuated low-frequency fatigue, likely 
due to reduced disruption of excitation-contraction coupling. However, contrary 
to previous findings, nitrate supplementation had no effect on contractile 
performance in unfatigued conditions.

In this study, we examined the effects of an ε-polylysine (PL) and chitosan (CH) 
coating on the quality of shrimp under refrigeration. Pacific white shrimp 
(Litopenaeus vannamei) were coated with PL, CH, or CH + PL and stored at 4 °C 
for 15 days. The quality of shrimp was measured by observing changes in 
microbiota, pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), and sensory 
characteristics. Among the coating films, the CH + PL coating most effectively 
inhibited the growth of mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria, Pseudomonas 
spp., and H2S-producing bacteria. This coating increased the shelf life of 
shrimp by decreasing the amount of mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria, with 
inhibition greater than three log cycles on the ninth day of storage. In 
addition, the CH and CH + PL coatings effectively suppressed the formation of 
TVB-N compared with that in the control by 43% and 30%, respectively. The pH of 
all treated samples increased slowly compared with that of the control, but no 
significant difference was observed. Sensory quality was similar to microbial 
and physicochemical properties, and the acceptability of all treated samples 
gradually decreased.

Among the 13 Mico species recognized by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, 
six are listed as "Data Deficient". The geographic range of most of the Mico 
species has been estimated from only a few records. We report new localities and 
the geographic extension of Mico chrysoleucos. In addition, we confirmed the 
presence of the species in two distinct protected areas. We modeled the habitat 
suitability of M. chrysoleucos using the maximum entropy method and including 
new records obtained by the authors in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. From the 
total area of occurrence calculated for the species, 22.8% is covered by 
protected areas and indigenous lands. The annual mean deforestation rate 
estimated between 2000 and 2015 was 2.95%, and the total area deforested by 2015 
was 3354 km2 or 8.6% of the total distribution limits of the species. The 
habitat lost between 2000 and 2015 was 3.2% (1131 km2) of the total potential 
distribution, while the habitat loss area legally protected was 31 km2, and the 
habitat loss in settlements was equal to 691 km2. Our results extend the 
geographic distribution of the species about 100 km farther south, with the 
Maracanã River being a possible geographic barrier for the species. The 
significantly low rate of habitat loss inside protected areas and indigenous 
land, when compared to unprotected areas, points out the importance of these 
areas to M. chrysoleucos conservation. The species is relatively wide-ranging, 
legally protected, and resilient to regional anthropic threats. However, the 
hydroelectric schemes and the improvement of the road system in southern 
Amazonia pose an imminent threat to the species.

INTRODUCTION: Many diabetes education programs address the problem of diabetes, 
but little attention is given to the economic impact of such programs. Our 
objective was to assess the effectiveness of a community-based education program 
in improving diabetes-related lifestyle behaviors and biomarkers and ascertain 
the economic benefits of the program for adults aged 18 years or older with type 
2 diabetes, prediabetes, or no diagnosis of diabetes in Pennsylvania.
METHODS: From October 2012 through June 2015, Pennsylvania State University 
Extension's Dining with Diabetes program collected data on 2,738 adults with 
type 2 diabetes or prediabetes and adult family members without diabetes. The 
program consisted of 4 weekly 2-hour classes and a follow-up class conducted 3 
months after the fourth 2-hour class. In the initial class and the follow-up 
class, participants completed a lifestyle questionnaire and their hemoglobin A1c 
and blood pressure were measured. Economic benefit was calculated as the medical 
expenditure cost savings resulting from program participation.
RESULTS: At 3-month follow-up, a significant number of participants had improved 
their lifestyle behaviors (diet and physical activity), had reductions in 
hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure, and improved their diabetes status. The 
Dining with Diabetes program had a 5-year benefit-cost ratio of 2.49 to 3.35.
CONCLUSION: Participants who completed the Dining with Diabetes program had 
significant improvements in diabetes-related biomarkers and lifestyle behaviors. 
If the Dining with Diabetes program were extended to half of the 1.3 million 
people living with diabetes in Pennsylvania and if they had similar 
improvements, the 1-year benefit to the state would be approximately $195 
million, assuming a conservative 15% decrease in direct medical costs.

Honey bees will learn to respond to an odor when their antennae are stimulated 
with sucrose, even if they are not fed during the conditioning phase. However, 
if they are not fed, the memory of this association is significantly reduced 
24 h after conditioning. These results suggest that stimulation of proboscis 
with sucrose and/or the nutritional quality of the reward plays an important 
role in establishing a long lasting memory. Three sugars, xylose, sorbitol and 
mannitol, are used to investigate the relationship among learning, sensory 
perception and nutritional value. The proboscis extension reflex is used to show 
that honey bees cannot taste these sugars, whereas mortality data suggest that 
bees can metabolize all three sugars. Feeding with sorbitol or xylose during 
olfactory associative conditioning restores robust 24 h memories. However, when 
given a free choice between consuming sucrose alone or sucrose supplemented with 
these nutritional sugars, bees did not show a preference for food containing the 
higher nutritional content. Furthermore, bees did not ingest solutions 
containing only the tasteless sugar even when it was the only food source. 
Together, these results suggest that nutritional content and not just sensory 
information is important for establishing long term memories, but that bees may 
not be able to assess nutritional content when it is disassociated from taste.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost effectiveness of renin-angiotensin aldosterone 
system (RAAS) blockade in the progression of chronic kidney disease using Thai 
clinical data in 2014.
METHODS: A Markov model for cost-effectiveness analysis was applied to estimate 
from a societal perspective the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gained and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of RAAS versus non-RAAS used 
in preventing the progression of end-stage renal disease and death stratified by 
diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Input parameters related to clinical outcomes 
were obtained from a cohort study of treatment effectiveness, whereas costs were 
retrieved from the Ramathibodi Hospital electronic database in 2015 and the 
Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program in Thailand. One-way 
analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to evaluate 
uncertainty surrounding model parameters.
RESULTS: From the model, using RAAS improved QALY from 2.41 to 3.16 years and 
from 2.37 to 3.20 years in diabetic and nondiabetic groups, respectively. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for these groups were 78,250 baht (US 
$2,353.39) and 66,674 baht (US $2,005.22), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Using RAAS in patients with chronic kidney disease improved QALY in 
both diabetic and nondiabetic patients and proved to be cost-effective.

In pathological retinal neovascularization (RNV) disorders, the retina is 
infiltrated by activated leukocytes and macrophages. Triggering receptor 
expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1), an inflammation amplifier, activates 
monocytes and macrophages and plays an important role in cancer, autoimmune and 
other inflammation-associated disorders. Hypoxia-inducible TREM-1 is involved in 
cancer angiogenesis but its role in RNV remains unclear. Here, to close this 
gap, we evaluated the role of TREM-1 in RNV using a mouse model of 
oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). We found that hypoxia induced overexpression 
of TREM-1 in the OIR retinas compared to that of the room air group. TREM-1 was 
observed specifically in areas of pathological RNV, largely colocalizing with 
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and CD45- and Iba-1-positive cells. 
TREM-1 blockade using systemically administered first-in-class 
ligand-independent TREM-1 inhibitory peptides rationally designed using the 
signaling chain homooligomerization (SCHOOL) strategy significantly (up to 95%) 
reduced vitreoretinal neovascularization. The peptides were well-tolerated when 
formulated into lipopeptide complexes for peptide half-life extension and 
targeted delivery. TREM-1 inhibition substantially downregulated retinal protein 
levels of TREM-1 and M-CSF suggesting that TREM-1-dependent suppression of 
pathological angiogenesis involves M-CSF. Targeting TREM-1 using TREM-1-specific 
SCHOOL peptide inhibitors represents a novel strategy to treat retinal diseases 
that are accompanied by neovascularization including retinopathy of prematurity.

BACKGROUND: A recent clinical trial showed that self-expandable transcatheter 
aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was non-inferior to surgical aortic valve 
replacement (SAVR). However, the cost-effectiveness of self-expandable TAVR in 
the intermediate-risk population remains unknown.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis from the Canadian health care system payer's 
perspective was undertaken to compare self-expandable TAVR with SAVR. A fully 
probabilistic Markov model over the patient's lifetime was constructed to 
estimate differences in costs (2016 Canadian dollars) and effectiveness 
(quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), discounted at 1.5% per annum. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Efficacy inputs were obtained 
from the Surgical Replacement and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation trial, 
and costs were primarily obtained from the Canadian Institute of Health 
Information. Probabilistic analysis (PA) and one-way deterministic sensitivity 
analyses were conducted around key point estimates to address uncertainty.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, with discounting, the total lifetime costs 
(mean ± standard deviation) in the TAVR and SAVR arms were $44,299 ± $7,260 and 
$32,994 ± $13,434, respectively, whereas total effectiveness values were 6.42 ± 
1.33 QALYs and 6.28 ± 1.32 QALYs, respectively. This yielded an incremental cost 
of $11,305 and incremental effectiveness of 0.15 QALYs when TAVR was compared 
with SAVR for an ICER of $76,736/QALY. In the PA, there was moderate 
uncertainty, with 52.8% and 57.2% of simulations less than willingness-to-pay 
thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000, respectively. In the sensitivity analysis, 
when the cost of TAVR valve system was priced at $17,397 (base case $22,000 
Canadian dollars), TAVR was found to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-expandable TAVR was found to be cost-effective; however, there 
was moderate uncertainty, reflecting the non-inferiority nature of the data.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Older adults with hematologic malignancy are a growing 
demographic. Estimating risk of chemotherapy toxicity based on age alone is an 
unreliable estimate of quality of life, functional capacity, or risk of 
treatment complications.
RECENT FINDINGS: Dedicated geriatric assessment tools can aid the clinician in 
identifying geriatric syndromes such as frailty, resulting in improved 
prognostication to decrease morbidity and mortality. Frailty is not synonymous 
with individual performance status and is dynamic. Establishing the patient 
goals, values, and preferences is central to the consideration of malignant 
hematology decision process. Careful considerations of available data on the 
patient's prognosis based on estimated life expectancy, geriatric assessment 
data, and age-specific cancer mortality, with and without treatment, can 
reconcile the risks and benefits. Assessments of frailty can aid the clinical 
feasibility and burden of the treatment to the patient and family in the context 
of each patient's unique needs.

The worldwide obesity epidemic continues unabated, adversely impacting upon 
global health and economies. People with severe obesity suffer the greatest 
adverse health consequences with reduced life expectancy. Currently, bariatric 
surgery is the most effective treatment for people with severe obesity, 
resulting in marked sustained weight loss, improved obesity-associated 
comorbidities and reduced mortality. Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y 
gastric bypass (RYGB), the most common bariatric procedures undertaken globally, 
engender weight loss and metabolic improvements by mechanisms other than 
restriction and malabsorption. It is now clear that a plethora of 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract-derived signals plays a critical role in energy and 
glucose regulation. SG and RYGB, which alter GI anatomy and nutrient flow, 
impact upon these GI signals ultimately leading to weight loss and metabolic 
improvements. However, whilst highly effective overall, at individual level, 
post-operative outcomes are highly variable, with a proportion of patients 
experiencing poor long-term weight loss outcome and gaining little health 
benefit. RYGB and SG are markedly different anatomically and thus differentially 
impact upon GI signalling and bodyweight regulation. Here, we review the 
mechanisms proposed to cause weight loss following RYGB and SG. We highlight 
similarities and differences between these two procedures with a focus on gut 
hormones, bile acids and gut microbiota. A greater understanding of these 
procedure-related mechanisms will allow surgical procedure choice to be tailored 
to the individual to maximise post-surgery health outcomes and will facilitate 
the discovery of non-surgical treatments for people with obesity.

Health,Vancouver,British Columbia,Canada.

Background Survival estimates are integral to care for patients diagnosed with 
dementia. Few Canadian studies have carried out long-term follow-up of 
well-described cohorts, analyzing survival related to multiple risk factors. 
Methods Survival analysis of an inception cohort enrolled at a British Columbia 
(BC) tertiary dementia referral clinic between 1997 and 1999 was undertaken. 
Vital status was completed for 168 patients diagnosed with dementia. An 
evaluation of the effects of demographics, vascular risk factors, cognitive and 
functional ratings, apolipoprotein 4-status, and cholinesterase use on survival 
was performed using a log-rank test and time-dependent Cox regression. Survival 
of this dementia cohort was compared with the age-matched life expectancy of 
persons in BC. Results In all, 158/168 (94.0%) subjects died over 16.6 years, 
with a median survival of 7.08 years. Risk factors associated with shorter 
survival in dementia groups included age of onset ≥80 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.56, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.32); greater functional disability 
(Disability Assessment for Dementia<55% [HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.04-2.08]); and 
cumulative medical illness severity (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale≥7 [HR 1.51, 
95% CI 1.08-2.12)]. Compared with the BC population, years of potential life 
lost for dementia subjects aged <65 was 15.36 years, and for dementia subjects 
aged ≥80 it was 1.82 years. Conclusions Survival in dementia subjects is shorter 
than population life expectancies for each age strata, with greatest impact on 
younger patients. For people diagnosed with dementia, age ≥80 years, cumulative 
medical illness severity, and functional disabilities are the most significant 
survival predictors and can be used to guide prognosis.

INTRODUCTION: Health technology appraisal agencies often rely on 
cost-effectiveness analyses to inform coverage decisions for new treatments. 
These assessments, however, frequently measure a treatment's value from the 
payer's perspective, and may not capture value generated from reduced caregiving 
costs, increased productivity, value based on patient risk preferences, option 
value or the insurance value to non-patients.
METHODS: To examine how using a broader societal perspective of treatment value 
affects cost-effectiveness estimates, this case study analyzed the net monetary 
benefit (NMB) of second-line nivolumab treatment of patients with squamous 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Canada. The comparator was treatment with 
docetaxel. NMB was measured from three perspectives: (i) traditional payer, (ii) 
traditional societal and (iii) broad societal.
RESULTS: Nivolumab was more effective (increased quality-adjusted life years by 
0.66 versus docetaxel), but also increased costs by $100,168 CAD. When valuing a 
quality-adjusted life year at $150,000, the net monetary benefit from the payer 
perspective suggested that costs modestly exceed benefits (NMB: -$1031). 
Adopting a societal perspective, however, nivolumab's benefits outweighed its 
costs (NMB: +$6752 and +$91,084 from the traditional and broad societal 
perspectives, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Broadening cost-effectiveness analysis beyond the traditional payer 
perspective had a significant impact on the result and should be considered in 
order to capture all treatment benefits and costs of societal relevance.

BACKGROUND: For patients in whom statins are not tolerated or effective as 
monotherapy, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) 
represent a new class of lipid lowering therapies that may reduce low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by up to 50% and lower cardiovascular 
events. While an important treatment option, the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9i in 
Australia remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness 
of PCSK9i compared to placebo in the prevention of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov cohort state-transition model was developed in 
Microsoft Excel. A hypothetical sample of 1000 individuals based on subjects in 
the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects 
with Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial populated the model. With each 
five-year cycle, model subjects could have non-fatal CVD events (myocardial 
infarction and/or stroke), or die from CVD or other causes. Follow-up was 
simulated for 25 years. CVD risk reduction, cost and utility data were gathered 
from published sources. At current acquisition prices (AU$8174 per person per 
year), the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was AU$308,558 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. Acquisition prices would need to be 
reduced to approximately AU$1500 per person per annum for PCSK9i to reach the 
arbitrary cost-effectiveness threshold of AU$50,000 per QALY saved.
CONCLUSION(S): PCSK9i are an effective alternative for those with existing CVD 
or at high risk of CVD in whom statin therapy alone is ineffective, but are not 
cost-effective to the Australian healthcare system based on current prices.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of universal maternal HIV 
screening at time of delivery to decrease mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), 
by comparing the cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of universal rapid 
HIV screening at time of delivery to two current standards of care for prenatal 
HIV screening in the United States.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare the cost and 
QALY of universal intrapartum rapid HIV screening with two current standards of 
care: (I) opt-out rapid HIV testing limited to patients without previous 
third-trimester screening and (II) opt-out rapid HIV testing limited to patients 
without any prenatal screening. We developed a decision-tree model and performed 
sensitivity analyses to estimate the impact of variances in QALY, estimated 
lifetime medical costs, HIV prevalence, and cumulative incidence.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for universal screening was 
$7,973.45/QALY. The results remained robust to sensitivity analysis, except for 
annual cumulative incidence. In areas with an annual cumulative incidence rate 
of <0.02% for reproductive-age women, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
for the expanded program would exceed $89,926.94/QALY, approaching the commonly 
applied cost-effectiveness thresholds ($100,000/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Intrapartum universal rapid HIV screening to decrease MTCT appears 
cost-effective in populations with high HIV incidence in the United States.

One of the most revolutionary technologies in recent years in the field of 
molecular biology is CRISPR-Cas9. CRISPR technology is a promising tool for gene 
editing that provides researchers the opportunity to easily alter DNA sequences 
and modify gene function. Its many potential applications include correcting 
genetic defects, treating and preventing the spread of diseases. Cystic fibrosis 
(CF) is one of the most common lethal genetic diseases caused by mutations in 
the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Although CF is an old 
acquaintance, there is still no effective/resolutive cure. Life expectancy has 
improved thanks to the combination of various treatments, but it is generally 
below average. Recently, a significant number of additional key medications have 
become licensed in Europe for the CF treatment including CFTR modulators. But 
innovative genomically-guided therapies have begun for CF and it is predictable 
that this will lead to rapid improvements in CF clinical disease and survival in 
the next decades. In this way, CRISPR-Cas9 approach may represent a valid tool 
to repair the CFTR mutation and hopeful results were obtained in tissue and 
animal models of CF disease.

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Herbarium specimens provide a robust record of historical 
plant phenology (the timing of seasonal events such as flowering or fruiting). 
However, the difficulty of aggregating phenological data from specimens arises 
from a lack of standardized scoring methods and definitions for phenological 
states across the collections community.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To address this problem, we report on a consensus reached 
by an iDigBio working group of curators, researchers, and data standards experts 
regarding an efficient scoring protocol and a data-sharing protocol for 
reproductive traits available from herbarium specimens of seed plants. The 
phenological data sets generated can be shared via Darwin Core Archives using 
the Extended MeasurementOrFact extension.
CONCLUSIONS: Our hope is that curators and others interested in collecting 
phenological trait data from specimens will use the recommendations presented 
here in current and future scoring efforts. New tools for scoring specimens are 
reviewed.
