Dongting and Lake Poyang. Our results indicate that up to 1.73 × 109 t sediment 
was retained in TGR from June 2003 to December 2014. This resulted in a 
145.9 × 106 t yr-1 decline in the suspended sediment load at Zhicheng and a 
16.8 × 106 t yr-1 lower sediment flow from Yangtze River to Lake Dongting, which 
partially explains the 13.4 × 106 t yr-1 lower sedimentation in Lake Dongting 
during the post-TGR period. Furthermore, TGR resulted in a 0.5 ± 0.3 m reduction 
of the multi-year mean water level at the Lake Poyang outlet Hukou, accelerating 
the suspended sediment export discharge from the lake. The reduced sedimentation 
in Lake Poyang during the post-TGR period was estimated to 6.3 × 106 t yr-1. We 
estimate that a monthly mean concentration of sediment flow from TGR below 
0.60 kg m-3 will lead to erosion in Lake Dongting and Lake Poyang. Better 
regulation of TGR may extend the life expectancy of the two vanishing large 
lakes.

In the last few decades, the life expectancy of regularly transfused 
β-thalassaemia major (TM) patients has dramatically improved following the 
introduction of safe transfusion practices, iron chelation therapy, aggressive 
treatment of infections and improved management of cardiac complications. How 
such changes, especially those attributed to the introduction of iron chelation 
therapy, improved the survival of TM patients to approach those with 
β-thalassaemia intermedia (TI) remains unknown. Three hundred and seventy-nine 
patients with TM (n = 284, dead 40) and TI (n = 95, dead 13) were followed 
retrospectively since birth until 30 June 2015 or death. Kaplan-Meir curves 
showed statistically significant differences in TM and TI survival (P < 0·0001) 
before the introduction of iron chelation in 1965, which were no longer apparent 
after that date (P = 0·086), reducing the Hazard Ratio of death in TM compared 
to TI from 6·8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2·6-17·5] before 1965 to 2·8 (95% 
CI 0·8-9·2). These findings suggest that, in the era of iron chelation therapy 
and improved survival for TM, the major-intermedia dichotomy needs to be 
revisited alongside future directions in general management and prevention for 
both conditions.

Pharmacoeconomic Analysis of Pain Medications Used to Treat Adult Patients with 
Chronic Back Pain in the United States.

Shah D, Anupindi VR, Vaidya V.

Chronic back pain is an extremely common health problem. The largest category 
for pain therapy costs includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
and opioids. However, there has been limited evidence outlining their 
effectiveness in terms of quality of life for the treatment of chronic back 
pain. The authors performed a comparative pharmacoeconomic analysis of chronic 
back pain patients using NSAIDs versus those using opioids alone or combination 
opioid analgesics. This pharmacoeconomic evaluation was conducted using the 
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Adults ≥18 years with chronic back pain 
diagnosis were included in the study. Individuals using opioids were matched in 
1:1 ratio with those using only NSAIDs using propensity scores. All direct 
medical costs were included, and utility scores from Short Form 6D (SF-6D) were 
used to calculate QALYs (quality-adjusted life years). Monte Carlo probabilistic 
simulation technique was employed to determine the cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curve. After matching, there were 1109 patients in each cohort. 
The total mean annual cost was found to be $6137.41 for NSAIDs and $8982.28 for 
opioids. The mean utility gain for NSAIDs was found to be 0.661, whereas for 
opioids it was 0.633. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at all 
willingness-to-pay thresholds, the probability of NSAIDs being cost-effective 
was higher than the probability of the opioids being cost-effective. The authors 
found NSAIDs to be a dominant strategy as compared with opioids. Considering the 
higher cost associated with opioids/combination opioid analgesics, it might be 
cost-effective if they are used in patients who did not respond to the NSAIDs.

OBJECTIVES: Randomised controlled trials and open-label extension studies have 
demonstrated the clinical efficacy and safety of tumour necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-α) blocking therapy in pre-selected study patients with ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS). Our aim was to investigate the 7-year drug survival and 
clinical effectiveness of etanercept treatment in AS patients in daily clinical 
practice.
METHODS: Consecutive AS patients from the prospective observational GLAS cohort 
who started etanercept because of active disease were included and evaluated 
over 7 years according to a fixed protocol. Continuation of treatment was based 
on BASDAI improvement and/or expert opinion.
RESULTS: Of the 89 included AS patients, 45 (51%) were still using etanercept at 
7 years of follow-up. Reasons for treatment discontinuation were adverse events 
(n=22), inefficacy (n=13), or other reasons although good clinical response 
(n=9). Etanercept treatment resulted in a rapid (after 6 weeks) and sustained 
improvement in disease activity (BASDAI, ASDAS, CRP, physician GDA), spinal 
mobility, physical function (BASFI), quality of life (ASQoL), and extra-spinal 
manifestations (swollen joints, tender joints and tender entheses). Furthermore, 
concomitant NSAID or DMARD use decreased significantly during follow-up. At 7 
years, low disease activity and remission were present in 67-73% and 29-30% of 
the 45 patients, respectively. Of the patients who discontinued etanercept, 18 
switched successfully to a second or third TNF-α blocker during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of AS patients treated with etanercept, 
approximately 50% continued this treatment for 7 years. Our broad evaluation of 
clinical endpoints proves the long-term effectiveness of etanercept treatment in 
daily clinical practice.

OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to use decision analysis to evaluate the 
impact of varying uncertainties on the outcomes of patients with anomalous 
aortic origin of a coronary artery.
METHODS: Two separate decision analysis models were created: one for anomalous 
left coronary artery (ALCA) and one for anomalous right coronary artery (ARCA). 
Three strategies were compared: observation, exercise restriction, and surgery. 
Probabilities and health utilities were estimated on the basis of existing 
literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Surgery was the optimal management strategy for patients <30 years of 
age with ALCA. As age increased, observation became an equivalent strategy and 
eventually surpassed surgery as the treatment of choice. The advantage on life 
expectancy for surgery over observation ranged from 2.6 ± 1.7 years for a 
10-year-old patient to -0.03 ± 0.1 for a 65-year old patient. In patients with 
ARCA, observation was the optimal strategy for most patients with a life 
expectancy advantage over surgery of 0.1 ± 0.1 years to 0.2 ± 0.4 years, 
depending on age. Surgery was the preferred strategy only for patients <25 years 
of age when the perceived risk of sudden cardiac death was high and the 
perioperative mortality was low. Exercise restriction was a suboptimal strategy 
for both ALCA and ARCA in all scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: The optimal management in anomalous aortic origin of a coronary 
artery depends on multiple factors, including individual patient 
characteristics. Decision analysis provides a tool to understand how these 
characteristics affect the outcomes with each management strategy and thus may 
aid in the decision making process for a particular patient.

BACKGROUND: Incident patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal 
dialysis (CAPD) are often prescribed either 3 or 4 exchanges per day. However, 
the effects on residual kidney function and clinical outcomes of 3 versus 4 
exchanges are not known.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Incident CAPD patients aged 18 to 80 years with 
glomerular filtration rates (GFRs; mean of renal urea and creatinine clearance 
from a 24-hour urine collection) ≥ 2mL/min and urine volume ≥ 500mL/d. Exclusion 
criteria included refusal for informed consent, history of maintenance 
hemodialysis therapy or transplantation, or limited life expectancy.
INTERVENTION: 24-month intervention with 3- or 4-exchange CAPD using 
glucose-based peritoneal dialysis fluids.
OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes were GFR, urine volume, and anuria-free survival. 
Secondary outcomes included peritonitis, patient survival, and technique 
survival.
RESULTS: The study recruited 139 patients, 70 in the 3-exchange group and 69 in 
the 4-exchange group. Baseline body mass indexes were 21.4±3.0 and 21.9±3.2kg/m2 
for the 3- and 4-exchange groups, respectively (P=0.4). After 24 months, for 3 
versus 4 exchanges, GFR (1.6±2.0 vs 1.7±1.9mL/min; P=0.8), urine volume (505±522 
vs 474±442mL/d; P=0.8), and anuria-free survival (log-rank test statistic = 
0.055; P=0.8) did not differ between groups, but Kt/V (1.95±0.39 vs 2.19±0.48; 
P=0.03) and ultrafiltration (404±499 vs 742±512mL/d; P=0.004) were lower in the 
3-exchange group. The 3-exchange group had nominally longer peritonitis-free 
survival time (log-rank test statistic = 3.811; P=0.05), and nominally fewer 
patients had peritonitis in this group, though this was not statistically 
significant (13% vs 26%; P=0.06). Patient survival (log-rank test statistic = 
0.978; P=0.3) and technique survival (log-rank test statistic = 0.347; P=0.6) 
were similar between groups.
LIMITATIONS: Single-center design; no formal sample-size calculations.
CONCLUSIONS: In this small trial, CAPD regimens with 3 and 4 exchanges had 
similar effects on residual GFR, urine volume, and time to anuria. Incremental 
peritoneal dialysis starts appear safe when patients are monitored.

PURPOSE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis study of sevelamer versus 
calcium-based binders (CBBs) in treating hyperphosphatemia among patients with 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in China.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model of a lifetime horizon was used for base case 
analysis from the payers' perspective. The transition probabilities between 
different health states were derived from survival analysis. The overall 
survival of CBBs was derived from the Dialysis Clinical Outcomes Revisited study 
for up to 44 months and a Weibull regression model was used to extrapolate the 
overall survival to a lifetime horizon. A hazard ratio (0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.93) 
of the overall survival for sevelamer versus CBBs was used to calculate the 
survival of the sevelamer group. Clinical and cost data were derived from 
literature and health care system in the local setting. Incremental life year 
and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were the primary outcomes. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty of 
the model assumptions and parameters. The results were reported in 2015 Chinese 
Renminbi.
FINDINGS: The incremental cost per life year and per QALY gained of sevelamer 
versus CBBs was ¥44,475 and ¥57,910, respectively. The incremental cost per QALY 
gained was below the World Health Organization's recommended cost-effectiveness 
threshold (¥151,070), which is 3 times the gross domestic product per capita of 
2015 in China. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was most sensitive to 
the hazard ratio of overall survival with sevelamer versus CBBs in the 1-way 
sensitivity analysis. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated that 
sevelamer had a 89.6% likelihood of cost-effectiveness at the ¥151,070 
threshold.
IMPLICATIONS: Sevelamer is likely to be a cost-effective option in treating 
hyperphosphatemia among patients with ESRD compared with CBBs in the local 
context of China.

PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea is a prevalent sleep disorder among older 
adults. Oral appliances are increasingly prescribed as therapy for obstructive 
sleep apnea. Adherence to oral appliance therapy is highly variable. Based on 
value-expectancy theory and other social-psychological theories, adherence to 
oral appliance therapy may be influenced by patients' perceived effectiveness of 
the therapy, self-efficacy, and availability of social support. We examined 
these perceptions among older adults with obstructive sleep apnea who were 
prescribed oral appliance therapy.
METHODS: We mailed surveys to all patients aged ≥65 years who had been 
prescribed oral appliance therapy for obstructive sleep apnea over the prior 36 
months at a Veterans Affairs medical center. We examined frequencies of 
responses to items that assessed perceived effectiveness, self-efficacy, and 
social support for nightly use of oral appliances from friends, family, or 
health care staff.
FINDINGS: Thirty-nine individuals responded (response rate, 30%; mean [SD] age 
71.4 [SD 6.3] years; 97% male). Thirty-six percent of the respondents perceived 
regular use of oral appliance therapy to be effective in managing obstructive 
sleep apnea; 39% agreed that they felt confident about using oral appliances 
regularly; 41% felt supported by people in their life in using oral appliance 
therapy; and 38% agreed that health care staff would help them to use their oral 
appliance regularly. These rates represented less than half of respondents 
despite the finding that 65% of patients believed that they would use their oral 
appliance regularly.
IMPLICATIONS: Although oral appliance therapy is increasingly prescribed for 
obstructive sleep apnea, only about one third of older adults prescribed it 
perceived it to be an effective treatment, were confident about oral appliance 
use, and/or believed that they would receive needed support. Future research is 
needed to better understand older adults' perceptions so that interventions can 
be designed to improve the effectiveness of oral appliances, their self-efficacy 
for using oral appliances, and their social support for this therapy, which may, 
in turn, improve oral appliance therapy adherence.

BACKGROUND: The prognosis of super-elderly patients (age≥85 years) who undergo 
bradycardia pacemaker (PM) implantation remains unknown.
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 868 patients (men 49.0%, 76.6±10.6 years) 
who could walk unassisted and whose expected life expectancy was more than 1 
year, receiving their first bradycardia PM implantation between January 1, 2006, 
and June 30, 2013. Clinical outcomes were compared between super-elderly 
patients (n=201, mean age 88.6±3.2 years) and younger patients (n=667, 73.0±9.3 
years).
RESULTS: At the end of a median 1285-day follow-up, 128 patients (14.7%) died, 
of which 54 were cardiac deaths (42.2%). Mortality rates were similar between 
the groups (16.4% vs. 14.2%, log-rank p=0.56) and across different indications 
for implantation (atrio-ventricular conduction disturbance or sick sinus 
syndrome, p=0.59), initial rhythms (sinus rhythm or persistent atrial 
fibrillation, p=0.62), pacing modes (dual chamber pacing or VVI pacing, p=0.26), 
and ventricular lead positions (septum or apex, p=0.52). On Cox proportional 
hazard model analysis, hypertension [hazard ratio (HR)=1.74, 95% confidence 
interval (CI)=1.19-2.54, p=0.004], diabetes mellitus (HR=2.18, 95% CI=1.51-3.14, 
p<0.001), history of myocardial infarction (HR=3.59, 95% CI=2.49-5.16, p<0.001), 
and history of stroke (HR=2.26, 95% CI=1.51-3.37, p<0.001) were independent 
predictors for mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate of super-elderly patients who had no critical 
illnesses and were healthy enough to walk unassisted at the time of PM 
implantation was not inferior to that of younger patients. Prognosis was 
determined by comorbidities, but not by age, PM indication, initial rhythm, 
pacing leads, or mode.

BACKGROUND: Adventitial cystic disease (ACD) is an unusual arteriopathy; case 
reports and small series constitute the available literature regarding 
treatment. We sought to examine the presentation, contemporary management, and 
long-term outcomes using a multi-institutional database.
METHODS: Using a standardized database, 14 institutions retrospectively 
collected demographics, comorbidities, presentation/symptoms, imaging, 
treatment, and follow-up data on consecutive patients treated for ACD during a 
10-year period, using Society for Vascular Surgery reporting standards for limb 
ischemia. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed comparing 
treatment methods and factors associated with recurrent intervention. Life-table 
analysis was performed to estimate the freedom from reintervention in comparing 
the various treatment modalities.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (32 men, 15 women; mean age, 43 years) were 
identified with ACD involving the popliteal artery (n = 41), radial artery (n = 
3), superficial/common femoral artery (n = 2), and common femoral vein (n = 1). 
Lower extremity claudication was seen in 93% of ACD of the leg arteries, whereas 
patients with upper extremity ACD had hand or arm pain. Preoperative diagnosis 
was made in 88% of patients, primarily using cross-sectional imaging of the 
lower extremity; mean lower extremity ankle-brachial index was 0.71 in the 
affected limb. Forty-one patients with lower extremity ACD underwent operative 
repair (resection with interposition graft, 21 patients; cyst resection, 13 
patients; cyst resection with bypass graft, 5 patients; cyst resection with 
patch, 2 patients). Two patients with upper extremity ACD underwent cyst 
drainage without resection or arterial reconstruction. Complications, including 
graft infection, thrombosis, hematoma, and wound dehiscence, occurred in 12% of 
patients. Mean lower extremity ankle-brachial index at 3 months postoperatively 
improved to 1.07 (P < .001), with an overall mean follow-up of 20 months (range, 
0.33-9 years). Eight patients (18%) with lower extremity arterial ACD required 
reintervention (redo cyst resection, one; thrombectomy, three; redo bypass, one; 
balloon angioplasty, three) after a mean of 70 days with symptom relief in 88%. 
Lower extremity patients who underwent cyst resection and interposition or 
bypass graft were less likely to require reintervention (P = .04). One patient 
with lower extremity ACD required an above-knee amputation for extensive tissue 
loss.
CONCLUSIONS: This multi-institutional, contemporary experience of ACD examines 
the treatment and outcomes of ACD. The majority of patients can be identified 
preoperatively; surgical repair, consisting of cyst excision with arterial 
reconstruction or bypass alone, provides the best long-term symptomatic relief 
and reduced need for intervention to maintain patency.

Prostate cancer is the first cancer and the second cause of cancer death in men 
in France. It is now a major public health issue, particularly given the 
increase of life expectancy. If screening is based on blood PSA and clinical 
examination (DRE), diagnosis requires the histological analysis of prostate 
samples. In current clinical routine, these biopsies are performed by endorectal 
through ultrasound guidance. In most cases, the cancer is not visible in the 
ultrasound image and the latter is used to make a dozen samples (or core), 
distributed as best as possible in the prostate. To increase the accuracy and 
the contribution of these biopsies, the use of data acquired by the magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), as well as the fusion of ultrasound and MRI images, is 
a therapeutic undergoing validation, and today performed in many institutions 
with dedicated tools. The objective of this work is to present the practical 
arrangements for the implementation of these biopsies using the image fusion, 
and discuss the advantages and benefits.

Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), a constituent of the traditional medicinal plant 
Salvia miltiorrhiza BUNGE, has been reported to possess anticancer activity 
through induction of apoptosis in many cancer cells. Surprisingly, the present 
study finds that Tan IIA simultaneously causes apoptosis and necroptosis in 
human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. We further find that apoptosis can 
be converted to necroptosis by pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, and the two 
death modes can be blocked by necroptotic inhibitor necrostatin-1. The 
underlying mechanisms are revealed by analysis of the signaling molecules using 
western blotting. In control cells, FLICE inhibitory protein in short form 
(FLIPS) is expressed in relatively high levels and binds to caspase 8 in 
ripoptosome, which supposedly sustains cell survival. However, in Tan 
IIA-treated cells, FLIPS is down-regulated and may thus cause homodimer 
formation of cleaved caspase 8, cleavage of receptor-interacting 
serine/threonine-protein kinases 1, 3 (RIP1, RIP3), and mixed-lineage kinase 
domain-like (MLKL), in turn leads to cell apoptosis. In parallel, Tan IIA causes 
necroptosis by forming a suggested necrosomal complex composed of RIP1/RIP3. 
Regarding the inhibitors, z-VAD-fmk diminishes the cleaved caspase 8, RIP1, 
RIP3, and MLKL induced by Tan IIA, and reconstructs the ripoptosome complex, 
which marks cells moving from apoptosis to necroptosis. Nec-1 recovers the Tan 
IIA down-regulated FLIPS, consequently causes FLIPS to form heterodimer with 
caspase 8 and thus block apoptosis. Meanwhile, cleaved forms of RIP1 and RIP3 
were observed preventing necroptosis. Intriguingly, the cytotoxicity of tumor 
necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand to HepG2 cells is enhanced by 
Tan IIA in a pilot study, which may be attributed to low FLIPS levels induced by 
Tan IIA. In short, Tan IIA simultaneously induces both Nec-1 inhibition and 
FLIPS regulation-mediated apoptosis/necroptosis, which has not been previously 
documented. Moreover, the involvement of the cleavage type of MLKL in executing 
necroptosis warrants further investigation.

As the life expectancy of people with intellectual disability (ID) has 
progressed, they have become similarly at risk of cancer as individuals of the 
general population. Epidemiological studies indicate a reduced incidence and 
mortality from lung cancer in the total population of persons with ID. However, 
the pattern is heterogeneous and the risk is strongly correlated with the 
impairment level; persons with mild intellectual impairment have higher cancer 
risk, and this subgroup also has the highest tobacco consumption (the major risk 
factor for lung cancer) compared to individuals with more severe impairment. 
Clinical presentation of lung cancer in persons with ID is often atypical, with 
symptoms frequently hidden by the mental state and communication impairments. 
Treatment can be impeded by incomplete understanding and lack of cooperation on 
the part of the patient; nevertheless, general principles for treating lung 
cancer must be applied to persons with ID. Early diagnosis and implementation of 
an adapted treatment plan may result in lung cancer outcomes similar to those of 
individuals in the general population. Physicians facing the difficult task of 
treating lung cancer in persons with ID are called to carry out their mission of 
care in a responsible, free, and creative way.

Introduction: Medical advances have improved life expectancy and survival of 
patients with thalassemia. However, as getting older, patients with thalassemia 
experience different complications which impair their quality of life. The aim 
of this study was to examine the effects of a nurse-implemented orientation 
program on quality of life in patients with thalassemia. Methods: A convenience 
sample of 55 patients with thalassemia were recruited in this quasi-experimental 
study. Patients were randomly allocated to control or experimental groups. A 
demographic questionnaire, Thalassemia quality of life questionnaire, and 
36-item short form health survey were used for data collection before and one 
month after the intervention. In the intervention group, 1.5-month orientation 
program including of the three steps of inauguration, implementation, and 
closure was implemented, while the control group received routine care. The 
Chi-square, independent t-test and paired-samples t-test were used for data 
analysis by using SPSS ver.13 software. Results: The intervention and control 
group did not differ significantly from each other regarding demographic 
characteristics. Moreover, no significant difference was observed between the 
two groups regarding the quality of life scores after the implementation of 
orientation program. Conclusion: Implementing a short-term orientation program 
was not effective in enhancing the quality of life in patients with thalassemia; 
hence, developing long-term multimodal strategies may result in better 
improvement.

Glycans play diverse roles in a wide range of biological processes. Research on 
glycan-binding events is essential for learning their biological and 
pathological functions. However, the functions of terminal and internal glycan 
epitopes exhibited during binding with glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) and/or 
viruses need to be further identified. Therefore, a focused library of 36 
biantennary asparagine (Asn)-linked glycans with some presenting tandem glycan 
epitopes was synthesized via a combined Core Isolation/Enzymatic Extension 
(CIEE) and one-pot multienzyme (OPME) synthetic strategy. These N-glycans 
include those containing a terminal sialyl N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc), sialyl 
Lewis x (sLex) and Siaα2-8-Siaα2-3/6-R structures with N-acetylneuraminic acid 
(Neu5Ac) or N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) sialic acid form, LacNAc, Lewis x 
(Lex), α-Gal, and Galα1-3-Lex; and tandem epitopes including α-Gal, Lex, 
Galα1-3-Lex, LacNAc, and sialyl LacNAc, presented with an internal sialyl LacNAc 
or 1-2 repeats of an internal LacNAc or Lex component. They were synthesized in 
milligram-scale, purified to over 98% purity, and used to prepare a glycan 
microarray. Binding studies using selected plant lectins, antibodies, and 
viruses demonstrated, for the first time, that when interpreting the binding 
between glycans and GBPs/viruses, not only the structure of the terminal glycan 
epitopes, but also the internal epitopes and/or modifications of terminal 
epitopes needs to be taken into account.

BACKGROUND: Insulin analogues have a pharmacokinetic advantage over human 
insulin and are increasingly used to treat diabetes mellitus. A summary of their 
cost effectiveness versus other available treatments was required.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to systematically review the published 
cost-effectiveness studies of insulin analogues for the treatment of patients 
with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: We searched major databases and health technology assessment agency 
reports for economic evaluation studies published up until 30 September 2015. 
Two reviewers performed data extraction and assessed the quality of the data 
using the CHEERS (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) 
guidelines.
RESULTS: Seven of the included studies assessed short-acting insulin analogues, 
12 assessed biphasic insulin analogues, 30 assessed long-acting insulin 
analogues and one assessed a combination of short- and long-acting insulin 
analogues. Only 17 studies involved patients with T1DM, all were modelling 
studies and 12 were conducted in Canada. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) for short-acting insulin analogues ranged from dominant to 
$US435,913 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, the ICERs for biphasic 
insulin analogues ranged from dominant to $US57,636 per QALY gained and the 
ICERs for long-acting insulin analogues ranged from dominant to $US599,863 per 
QALY gained. A total of 15 studies met all the CHEERS guidelines reporting 
quality criteria. Only 26 % of the studies assessed heterogeneity in their 
analyses.
CONCLUSION: Current evidence indicates that insulin analogues are cost effective 
for T1DM; however, evidence for their use in T2DM is not convincing. Additional 
evidence regarding compliance and efficacy is required to support the broader 
use of long-acting and biphasic insulin analogues in T2DM. The value of insulin 
analogues depends strongly on reductions in hypoglycaemia event rates and its 
efficacy in lowering glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c).

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
manufacturer of azacitidine (Celgene) to submit evidence for the clinical and 
cost effectiveness of this drug for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia 
with more than 30 % bone marrow blasts in adults who are not eligible for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as part of the NICE's Single 
Technology Appraisal process. The Peninsula Technology Assessment Group was 
commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a 
critical review of the evidence contained within the company's submission to 
NICE. The clinical effectiveness data used in the company's economic analysis 
were derived from a single randomised controlled trial, AZA-AML-001. It was an 
international, multicentre, controlled, phase III study with an open-label, 
parallel-group design conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of 
azacitidine against a conventional care regimen (CCR). The CCR was a composite 
comparator of acute myeloid leukaemia treatments currently available in the 
National Health Service: intensive chemotherapy followed by best supportive care 
(BSC) upon disease relapse or progression, non-intensive chemotherapy followed 
by BSC and BSC only. In AZA-AML-001, the primary endpoint was overall survival. 
Azacitidine appeared to be superior to the CCR, with median overall survival of 
10.4 and 6.5 months, respectively. However, in the intention-to-treat analysis, 
the survival advantage associated with azacitidine was not statistically 
significant. The company submitted a de novo economic evaluation based on a 
partitioned survival model with four health states: "Remission", 
"Non-remission", "Relapse/Progressive disease" and "Death". The model time 
horizon was 10 years. The perspective was the National Health Service and 
Personal Social Services. Costs and health effects were discounted at the rate 
of 3.5 % per year. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
azacitidine compared with the CCR was £20,648 per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean ICER was 
£17,423 per QALY. At the willingness-to-pay of £20,000, £30,000 and £50,000 per 
QALY, the probability of azacitidine being cost effective was 0.699, 0.908 and 
0.996, respectively. The ERG identified a number of errors in Celgene's model 
and concluded that the results of the company's economic evaluation could not be 
considered robust. After amendments to Celgene's model, the base-case ICER was 
£273,308 per QALY gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean 
ICER was £277,123 per QALY. At a willingness-to-pay of £100,000 per QALY, the 
probability of azacitidine being cost effective was less than 5 %. In all 
exploratory analyses conducted by the ERG, the ICER exceeded the NICE's 
cost-effectiveness threshold range of £20,000-30,000 per QALY. Given the 
evidence provided in the submission, azacitidine did not fulfil NICE's 
end-of-life criteria. After considering the analyses performed by the ERG and 
submissions from clinician and patient experts, the NICE Appraisal Committee did 
not recommend azacitidine for this indication.

An analytical method entailing high-performance liquid chromatography coupled 
with electrochemical detection was developed for determining forsythiaside (FTS) 
in rat plasma. Rat plasma samples were prepared through efficient 
trichloroacetic acid deproteination. FTS and the internal standard were 
chromatographically separated on a reversed-phase core-shell silica C18 column 
(100 mm × 2.1 mm, i.d. 2.6 μm), with a mobile phase consisting of an 
acetonitrile-0.05-M phosphate solution (11.8:88.2, v/v), at a flow rate of 400 
μL/min. The calibration curve, with r² > 0.999, was linear in the 20-1000 ng/mL 
range. The intra- and interday precision were less than 9.0%, and the accuracy 
ranged from 94.5% to 106.5% for FTS. The results indicated that the newly 
developed HPLC-EC method is more sensitive than previous reported methods using 
UV detection, and this new analytical method is applied successfully for the 
pharmacokinetic study of FTS. The hydrogel delivery system can efficiently 
improve bioavailability and mean residual time for FTS, as evidenced by the 2.5- 
and 6.3-fold increase of the area under the curve and the extension of the 
half-life, respectively.

challenges in different areas, including gerontology and geriatric education and 
research. Although in the European Union there are more than 3,000 institutions 
that focus on aging research, in Latin America there are only 250 programs where 
theoretical and practical knowledge is taught. In Mexico, the number of 
institutions that offer gerontology and geriatric education is relatively small. 
One of the major concerns is that Mexico is not adequately prepared to optimally 
deal with the aging of its population. Thus, the main challenge that Mexico 
faces is to train practitioners, researchers, and policy makers to be able to 
respond to the aging priorities of this country. The goal of this review is to 
investigate the literature regarding 60 years in the fields of gerontology and 
geriatrics in Mexico. Even when programs have evolved within the past decades, 
there are some challenges to gerontological and geriatric education and aging 
research in Mexico. The implications for Mexico are discussed, as well as 
opportunities for moving these fields forward.
