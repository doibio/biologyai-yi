BACKGROUND: Although diet is related to chronic disease risk and mortality, its 
association with total disease burden is not clear.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the minimum impact of different dietary patterns on 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by using individual longitudinal data.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 33,066 healthy men and women 
aged 20-70 y recruited into the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer 
and Nutrition-Netherlands study during 1993-1997. We measured adherence to 3 a 
priori dietary patterns [the modified Mediterranean diet score (mMDS), the 
WHO-based Healthy Diet Indicator, and the Dutch Healthy Diet index] and 2 a 
posteriori dietary patterns. Two a posteriori methods were used to extract 
Western and prudent patterns. Participants were followed until the end of 2007 
for the occurrence of and mortality from the most important chronic diseases. 
The disease burden was expressed in DALYs, which are the sum of Years Lost due 
to Disability and Years of Life Lost because of premature mortality. The 
associations between dietary patterns (per SD change in score) and DALYs were 
estimated by using a 2-part model and adjusted for relevant confounders (sex, 
age at recruitment, smoking status and intensity, educational level, marital 
status, job status, energy intake, and physical activity).
RESULTS: After an average follow-up of 12.4 y, higher adherence to the mMDS or 
prudent pattern was most strongly associated with healthy survival; per SD 
higher adherence to the mMDS or prudent pattern, fewer healthy life years were 
lost [51 d (-0.14 DALYs; 95% CI: -0.21, -0.08 DALYs) and 58 d (-0.16 DALYs; 95% 
CI: -0.23, -0.09 DALYs), respectively].
CONCLUSION: In this Dutch study, of various dietary patterns evaluated, higher 
adherence to the mMDS or prudent dietary pattern was associated with a lower 
disease burden as assessed by DALYs.

The aim of this study was to explore the voluntary activation level during 
maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in individuals with intellectual disability 
(ID) versus individuals without ID using the twitch interpolation technique. Ten 
individuals with mild ID (ID group) and 10 sedentary men without ID (control 
group) participated in this study. The evaluation of neuromuscular function 
consisted in three brief MVCs (3s) of the knee extension superimposed with 
electrical nerve stimulation (NES) to measure voluntary activation. Muscle 
activity levels were also measured with surface EMG. The root mean square (RMS) 
was extracted from the EMG signal. The RMS/Mmax ratio and the neuromuscular 
efficiency (NME) were calculated. Our results reported that individuals with ID 
present lower muscle strength (p < 0.001), lower voluntary activation level (p < 
0.001), lower RMS values of vastus lateralis (p < 0.05), vastus medialis (p < 
0.05), and rectus femoris (p < 0.001) muscles. In addition, our results showed 
lower RMS/Mmax values in the ID group than in the control group for the VM (0.05 
± 0.01 mV vs. 0.04 ± 0.01 mV; p < 0.05) and the RF (0.06 ± 0.02 mV vs. 0.05 ± 
0.02 mV; p < 0.05) muscles. However, no significant difference was reported for 
the VL muscle (0.05 ± 0.02 mV vs. 0.05 ± 0.02 mV; p=0.463). Moreover, 
Individuals with ID present smaller potentiated twitch (p < 0.001). However, no 
significant difference was reported in the NME ratio. These results suggest that 
the lower muscle strength known in individuals with ID is related to a central 
nervous system failure to activate motor units and to some abnormal intrinsic 
muscle properties. It seems that the inactive lifestyle adopted by individuals 
with ID is one of the most important factors of their lower voluntary activation 
levels. Therefore, physical activities should be introduced in life style of 
individuals with ID to improve their neuromuscular function.

INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: To project the long-term cost-effectiveness of treating 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) patients for stroke prevention with 
rivaroxaban compared to warfarin in Portugal.
METHODS: A Markov model was used that included health and treatment states 
describing the management and consequences of AF and its treatment. The model's 
time horizon was set at a patient's lifetime and each cycle at three months. The 
analysis was conducted from a societal perspective and a 5% discount rate was 
applied to both costs and outcomes. Treatment effect data were obtained from the 
pivotal phase III ROCKET AF trial. The model was also populated with utility 
values obtained from the literature and with cost data derived from official 
Portuguese sources. The outcomes of the model included life-years, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental costs, and associated 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Extensive sensitivity analyses 
were undertaken to further assess the findings of the model. As there is 
evidence indicating underuse and underprescription of warfarin in Portugal, an 
additional analysis was performed using a mixed comparator composed of no 
treatment, aspirin, and warfarin, which better reflects real-world prescribing 
in Portugal.
RESULTS: This cost-effectiveness analysis produced an ICER of €3895/QALY for the 
base-case analysis (vs. warfarin) and of €6697/QALY for the real-world 
prescribing analysis (vs. mixed comparator). The findings were robust when 
tested in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that rivaroxaban may be a cost-effective 
alternative compared with warfarin or real-world prescribing in Portugal.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab versus ranibizumab 
for patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in China.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to compare cost per quality-adjusted 
life year of bevacizumab with ranibizumab in patients with neovascular AMD. In 
the Markov model, with cycle length of 3 months and time horizon of 10 years, 
three health states were defined by visual acuity. One way deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the uncertainties 
from a number of variables.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, patients in ranibizumab group obtained 0.007 
QALY more than patients in bevacizumab group, while the average total cost was 
¥794 400 higher. The ICUR reached ¥109.23 million per QALY. In all sensitivity 
analyses, the ICURs were over ¥ 2.48 million per QALY between ranibizumab and 
bevacizumab groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Ranibizumab for neovascular AMD patients gained similar QALY at 
significantly higher costs in comparison with bevacizumab. The ICURs generated 
in this study were much higher than the possible QALY threshold in the society 
of China. Compared with ranibizumab, bevacizumab was cost-effective for 
neovascular AMD patients.

Changes in social inequalities in disability-free life expectancy in Southern 
Europe: the case of the Basque Country.

Martín U, Esnaola S.

BACKGROUND: Health expectancy is a useful tool to monitor health inequalities. 
The evidence about the recent changes in social inequalities in healthy 
expectancy is relatively scarce and inconclusive, and most studies have focused 
on Anglo-Saxon and central or northern European countries. The objective of this 
study was to analyse the changes in socioeconomic inequalities in 
disability-free life expectancy in a Southern European population, the Basque 
Country, during the first decade of the 21st century.
METHODS: This was an ecological cross-sectional study of temporal trends on the 
Basque population in 1999-2003 and 2004-2008. All-cause mortality rate, life 
expectancy, prevalence of disability and disability free-life expectancy were 
calculated for each period according to the deprivation level of the area of 
residence. The slope index of inequality and the relative index of inequality 
were calculated to summarize and compare the inequalities in the two periods.
RESULTS: Disability free-life expectancy decreased as area deprivation increased 
both in men and in women. The difference between the most extreme groups in 
2004-2008 was 6.7 years in men and 3.7 in women. Between 1999-2003 and 
2004-2008, socioeconomic inequalities in life expectancy decreased, and 
inequalities in disability-free expectancy increased in men and decreased in 
women.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found important socioeconomic inequalities in health 
expectancy in the Basque Country. These inequalities increased in men and 
decreased in women in the first decade of the 21st century, during which the 
Basque Country saw considerable economic growth.

BACKGROUND: Compression is an effective and recommended treatment for venous leg 
ulcers. Although the four-layer bandage (4LB) is regarded as the gold standard 
compression system, it is recognised that the amount of compression delivered 
might be compromised by poor application technique. Also the bulky nature of the 
bandages might reduce ankle or leg mobility and make the wearing of shoes 
difficult. Two-layer compression hosiery systems are now available for the 
treatment of venous leg ulcers. Two-layer hosiery (HH) may be advantageous, as 
it has reduced bulk, which might enhance ankle or leg mobility and patient 
adherence. Some patients can also remove and reapply two-layer hosiery, which 
may encourage self-management and could reduce costs. However, little robust 
evidence exists about the effectiveness of two-layer hosiery for ulcer healing 
and no previous trials have compared two-layer hosiery delivering 'high' 
compression with the 4LB.
OBJECTIVES: Part I To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness 
of HH and 4LB in terms of time to complete healing of venous leg ulcers. Part II 
To synthesise the relative effectiveness evidence (for ulcer healing) of 
high-compression treatments for venous leg ulcers using a mixed-treatment 
comparison (MTC). Part III To construct a decision-analytic model to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of high-compression treatments for venous leg ulcers.
DESIGN: Part I A multicentred, pragmatic, two-arm, parallel, open randomised 
controlled trial (RCT) with an economic evaluation. Part II MTC using all 
relevant RCT data - including Venous leg Ulcer Study IV (VenUS IV). Part III A 
decision-analytic Markov model.
SETTINGS: Part I Community nurse teams or services, general practitioner 
practices, leg ulcer clinics, tissue viability clinics or services and wound 
clinics within England and Northern Ireland.
PARTICIPANTS: Part I Patients aged ≥ 18 years with a venous leg ulcer, who were 
willing and able to tolerate high compression.
INTERVENTIONS: Part I Participants in the intervention group received HH. The 
control group received the 4LB, which was applied according to standard 
practice. Both treatments are designed to deliver 40 mmHg of compression at the 
ankle. Part II and III All relevant high-compression treatments including HH, 
the 4LB and the two-layer bandage (2LB).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Part I The primary outcome measure was time to healing of 
the reference ulcer (blinded assessment). Part II Time to ulcer healing. Part 
III Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs.
RESULTS: Part I A total of 457 participants were recruited. There was no 
evidence of a difference in time to healing of the reference ulcer between 
groups in an adjusted analysis [hazard ratio (HR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 0.79 to 1.25; p = 0.96]. Time to ulcer recurrence was significantly shorter 
in the 4LB group (HR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.94; p = 0.026). In terms of 
cost-effectiveness, using QALYs as the measure of benefit, HH had a > 95% 
probability of being the most cost-effective treatment based on the within-trial 
analysis. Part II The MTC suggests that the 2LB has the highest probability of 
ulcer healing compared with other high-compression treatments. However, this 
evidence is categorised as low to very low quality. Part III Results suggested 
that the 2LB had the highest probability of being the most cost-effective 
high-compression treatment for venous leg ulcers.
CONCLUSIONS: Trial data from VenUS IV found no evidence of a difference in 
venous ulcer healing between HH and the 4LB. HH may reduce ulcer recurrence 
rates compared with the 4LB and be a cost-effective treatment. When all 
available high-compression treatments were considered, the 2LB had the highest 
probability of being clinically effective and cost-effective. However, the 
underpinning evidence was sparse and more research is needed. Further research 
should thus focus on establishing, in a high-quality trial, the effectiveness of 
this compression system in particular.

Examining the potential contribution of social theory to developing and 
supporting Australian Indigenous-mainstream health service partnerships.

Haynes E, Taylor KP, Durey A, Bessarab D, Thompson SC.

INTRODUCTION: The substantial gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and 
non-Indigenous Australians has been slow to improve, despite increased dedicated 
funding. Partnerships between Australian Indigenous and mainstream Western 
biomedical organisations are recognised as crucial to improved Indigenous health 
outcomes. However, these partnerships often experience challenges, particularly 
in the context of Australia's race and political relations.
METHODS: We examined the relevant literature in order to identify the potential 
role for social theory and theoretical models in developing and maintaining 
intercultural partnerships. Having identified relevant theoretical models, terms 
and possible key words, a range of databases were searched and relevant articles 
selected for inclusion. An integrative approach brought together theoretical 
models and practical considerations about working in partnership, to inform our 
analysis of the literature.
FINDINGS: Considering partnerships between Australian Indigenous and mainstream 
health organisations as 'bi-cultural' is simplistic: rather they are culturally 
diverse across social and professional levels. As such, partnerships between 
Australian Indigenous and mainstream health organisations may be better 
conceptualised as 'intercultural', operating across diverse and shifting 
cultural frames of reference. Theories identified by this review as useful to 
guide partnerships include power relations, reflexivity and dialogue, borders 
and strangeness and the intercultural or third space. This paper examines how 
these theoretical approaches can develop understanding and improve intercultural 
engagement between mainstream and Australian Indigenous partners in healthcare.
CONCLUSIONS: Rather than viewing partnerships merely as arrangements between 
disembodied entities, sometimes contractual in nature, they are better seen as 
activities between people and organisations and essentially dependent on 
relationships, occurring in an intercultural space that is complex, dynamic and 
subject to changes in power relations. Theoretical models aiming to understand 
and improve partnerships indicate the complexity of building and maintaining 
such partnerships and stress the importance of understanding factors that can 
strengthen or derail their effectiveness. While the theories presented here are 
by no means exhaustive, they nonetheless provide a series of entry points 
through which to engage with the issue and expand the discourse. This approach 
allows the transformative nature of Australian Indigenous-mainstream 'culture' 
to be explored and understood in its lived expression; rather than relegated to 
prescriptive categories.

Fear of falling (FoF) in elderly frequently leads to decreased quality of life. 
FoF is suggested to be associated with changes in gait quality and muscle 
strength with aging. The aim of this study was to determine whether gait quality 
and maximal voluntary torque (MVT) of knee extensor muscles are associated with 
FoF. We hypothesized that high between-stride variability and local divergence 
exponent (LDE) of trunk kinematics in gait are associated with higher FoF in 
non-fallers, but not in fallers. Moreover, we hypothesized that knee extensor 
muscle strength is associated with a high variability and LDE of trunk 
kinematics during gait. 134 four adults, aged 62.4 (SD 6.2) years agreed to 
participate. FoF was assessed on a 10-point numerical rating scale. Subjects 
with at least one fall in the past 12 months were considered as fallers. LDE and 
variability were calculated from data of a trunk-mounted inertial-sensor 
collected during several minutes of treadmill walking. Maximal voluntary knee 
extension torque (MVT) was assessed isometrically. Fall history was an effect 
modifier in the association between LDE and FoF only, i.e. only subjects without 
fall history and a high LDE had a five times higher chance of reporting FoF. 
Gait variability was not associated with FoF. Low MVT was associated with FoF. 
Multivariate analysis demonstrated that LDE was more strongly associated with 
FoF than MVT. Decreased stability of gait as reflected in a high LDE and low 
muscle strength are associated with and a potential cause of FoF in subjects 
without fall history.

The objective of the study is to establish the link between air pollution, 
fossil fuel energy consumption, industrialization, alternative and nuclear 
energy, combustible renewable and wastes, urbanization, and resulting impact on 
health services in Malaysia. The study employed two-stage least square 
regression technique on the time series data from 1975 to 2012 to possibly 
minimize the problem of endogeniety in the health services model. The results in 
general show that air pollution and environmental indicators act as a strong 
contributor to influence Malaysian health services. Urbanization and nuclear 
energy consumption both significantly increases the life expectancy in Malaysia, 
while fertility rate decreases along with the increasing urbanization in a 
country. Fossil fuel energy consumption and industrialization both have an 
indirect relationship with the infant mortality rate, whereas, carbon dioxide 
emissions have a direct relationship with the sanitation facility in a country. 
The results conclude that balancing the air pollution, environment, and health 
services needs strong policy vistas on the end of the government officials.

Foundation Vancouver, BC.

Men are more likely to die of cancer, heart disease, or diabetes at younger ages 
than women - a reality that is compounded by the reluctance of men to use 
healthcare services. In addition to reduced life expectancy, men can also expect 
to live fewer healthy years than their female counterparts. As gynecologists and 
obstetricians have led the women's health movement in addressing gender-specific 
gaps in care, urologists are well-poised to take on a leadership role to 
advocate for, and address, men's health initiatives.

Prenatal alcohol exposure alters p35, CDK5 and GSK3β in the medial frontal 
cortex and hippocampus of adolescent mice.

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are the number one cause of preventable 
mental retardation. An estimated 2-5% of children are diagnosed as having a 
FASD. While it is known that children prenatally exposed to alcohol experience 
cognitive deficits and a higher incidence of psychiatric illness later in life, 
the pathways underlying these abnormalities remain uncertain. GSK3β and CDK5 are 
protein kinases that are converging points for a vast number of signaling 
cascades, including those controlling cellular processes critical to learning 
and memory. We investigated whether levels of GSK3β and CDK5 are affected by 
moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), specifically in the hippocampus and 
medial frontal cortex of the adolescent mouse. In the present work we utilized 
immunoblotting techniques to demonstrate that moderate PAE increased hippocampal 
p35 and β-catenin, and decreased total levels of GSK3β, while increasing GSK3β 
Ser9 and Tyr216 phosphorylation. Interestingly, different alterations were seen 
in the medial frontal cortex where p35 and CDK5 were decreased and increased 
total GSK3β was accompanied by reduced Tyr216 of the enzyme. These results 
suggest that kinase dysregulation during adolescence might be an important 
contributing factor to the effects of PAE on hippocampal and medial frontal 
cortical functioning; and by extension, that global modulation of these kinases 
may produce differing effects depending on brain region.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse mortality and life expectancy in people with alcohol use 
disorder in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.
METHOD: A population-based register study including all patients admitted to 
hospital diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (1,158,486 person-years) from 1987 
to 2006 in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.
RESULTS: Life expectancy was 24-28 years shorter in people with alcohol use 
disorder than in the general population. From 1987 to 2006, the difference in 
life expectancy between patients with alcohol use disorder and the general 
population increased in men (Denmark, 1.8 years; Finland, 2.6 years; Sweden, 1.0 
years); in women, the difference in life expectancy increased in Denmark (0.3 
years) but decreased in Finland (-0.8 years) and Sweden (-1.8 years). People 
with alcohol use disorder had higher mortality from all causes of death 
(mortality rate ratio, 3.0-5.2), all diseases and medical conditions (2.3-4.8), 
and suicide (9.3-35.9).
CONCLUSION: People hospitalized with alcohol use disorder have an average life 
expectancy of 47-53 years (men) and 50-58 years (women) and die 24-28 years 
earlier than people in the general population.

In pursuit of a moving target: nanotherapeutics for the treatment of non-Hodgkin 
B-cell lymphoma.

Ave., Pittsburgh, PA 15213 , USA.

INTRODUCTION: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is diagnosed in 70,000 Americans 
annually. Chemotherapy was the standard course of treatment until the addition 
of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) drug, rituximab, to therapy regimens in 1997. 
Although disease prognosis has improved dramatically since that time, nearly 
20,000 patients succumb annually to the disease, with an average life expectancy 
beyond diagnosis of only 12 years. The advent of nanomedicine may fulfill the 
remaining need for novel therapy capable of eradicating solid tumor and 
disseminated B-cell lymphomas.
AREAS COVERED: This review details the current landscape of B-cell NHL and 
nanoparticles now being developed for its treatment. Specifically, we discuss 
lipid, polymer and metal nanoparticles that deliver an array of drugs, including 
toxins, chemotherapeutic agents and nucleic acids.
EXPERT OPINION: Because B-cell malignancies have responded quite well to new 
components in multi-drug regimens, nanomedicines that are mechanistically 
distinct from existing therapies hold significant promise. In our opinion, 
advancement of these technologies into the clinic will likely require 
significantly more effective targeting systems coupled with a better 
understanding of lymphoma biology. Furthermore, it is important for researchers 
to recognize the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of NHL and to develop 
therapeutic strategies for distinct subsets of NHL before attempting to 
generalize approaches.

lobe epilepsy: a decision analysis.

OBJECTIVES: Anterior temporal lobectomy is curative for many patients with 
disabling medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy, but carries an inherent 
risk of disabling verbal memory loss. Although accurate prediction of iatrogenic 
memory loss is becoming increasingly possible, it remains unclear how much 
weight such predictions should have in surgical decision making. Here we aim to 
create a framework that facilitates a systematic and integrated assessment of 
the relative risks and benefits of surgery versus medical management for 
patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov decision model to evaluate the probabilistic 
outcomes and associated health utilities associated with choosing to undergo a 
left anterior temporal lobectomy versus continuing with medical management for 
patients with medically refractory left temporal lobe epilepsy. Three base-cases 
were considered, representing a spectrum of surgical candidates encountered in 
practice, with varying degrees of epilepsy-related disability and potential for 
decreased quality of life in response to post-surgical verbal memory deficits.
RESULTS: For patients with moderately severe seizures and moderate risk of 
verbal memory loss, medical management was the preferred decision, with 
increased quality-adjusted life expectancy. However, the preferred choice was 
sensitive to clinically meaningful changes in several parameters, including 
quality of life impact of verbal memory decline, quality of life with seizures, 
mortality rate with medical management, probability of remission following 
surgery, and probability of remission with medical management.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our decision model suggests that for patients with left temporal 
lobe epilepsy, quantitative assessment of risk and benefit should guide 
recommendation of therapy. In particular, risk for and potential impact of 
verbal memory decline should be carefully weighed against the degree of 
disability conferred by continued seizures on a patient-by-patient basis.

The Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) is a monogenic X-linked primary 
immunodeficiency characterised also by thrombocytopenia, eczema, and a high 
susceptibility to develop tumours and autoimmunity. WAS patients have a severely 
reduced life expectancy, unless they undergo a successful HLA-matched 
haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. However, several WAS patients 
lack a compatible donor and complications, such as autoimmunity, can arise in a 
significant fraction of HSC transplanted patients. Administration of WAS 
gene-corrected autologous HSC represents an alternative therapeutic approach, 
potentially applicable to all WAS patients. To this aim, several gene therapy 
approaches for WAS using initially γ-retroviral vectors (RVs) and subsequently 
HIV-based lentiviral vectors (LVs) have been developed. In the present review, 
we will first describe the results of the preclinical studies conducted in the 
murine model of WAS and then discuss the outcome of different phase I/II 
clinical trials using RV or LV- transduced HSC. Both gene therapy approaches led 
to restored WASP expression, correction of functional defects and clinical 
improvement. While RV-mediated gene therapy was associated with a high 
occurrence of leukaemia, results obtained in the first patients treated with 
LV-based HSC gene therapy indicate a safer risk-benefit profile.

BACKGROUND: Giving the public and the patients good information enables them to 
make effective choices about their care. This study describes public preferences 
for both themselves and their relatives on receiving information on end-of-life 
care topics when faced with a life-limiting illness and to identify associated 
factors.
METHOD: This study used data from the cross-sectional Health Interview Study 
(HIS) 2008 that collected data from a representative sample (N = 9651) of the 
Belgian population.
RESULTS: Around 82% of respondents wanted to be informed always about diagnosis, 
chances of cure and available treatments, 77% wanted to be informed on life 
expectancy, 72% on options regarding palliative care and 67% on possibilities of 
prolonging or shortening life. Around 55% wanted their relative to be informed 
always about diagnosis, chances of cure, life expectancy and different 
treatments available, whereas 50% wanted this in relation to the options 
regarding palliative care and 46% on the possibilities of prolonging or 
shortening life. Younger adults, people with more education and people with a 
regular GP were more likely to want to be informed always. Younger adults and 
women were less likely to want their relatives to be informed always.
CONCLUSION: The majority of the Belgian population wants to be informed always 
about end-of-life care topics when faced with a life-limiting illness. 
Physicians should be aware of the desired level of information and tailor 
information to individual patient preferences. Understanding population 
preferences may help to tailor patient education and health promotion programmes 
appropriately.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of liraglutide versus 
sitagliptin or exenatide, added to oral antidiabetic drug mono- or combination 
therapy respectively, in patients with Type 2 diabetes in Greece.
METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model, a validated computer simulation model, was 
adapted to the Greek healthcare setting. Patient and intervention effects data 
were gathered from a clinical trial comparing liraglutide 1.2 mg once daily vs. 
sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, both combined with metformin, and a clinical 
trial comparing liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily vs. exenatide 10 μg twice daily, 
both as add-on to metformin, glimepiride or both. Direct costs were reported in 
2013 Euros and calculated based on published and local sources. All future 
outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per annum, and the analysis was conducted from 
the perspective of a third-party payer in Greece.
RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime, treatment with liraglutide 1.2 mg vs. 
sitagliptin drove a mean increase in discounted life expectancy of 0.13 (SD 
0.23) years and in discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.19 (0.16) 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), whereas therapy with liraglutide 1.8 mg vs. 
exenatide yielded increases of 0.14 (0.23) years and 0.19 (0.16) QALYs 
respectively. As regards lifetime direct costs, liraglutide 1.2 mg resulted in 
greater costs of €2797 (€1468) versus sitagliptin, and so did liraglutide 1.8 mg 
compared with exenatide (€1302 [€1492]). Liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg doses were 
associated with incremental cost effectiveness ratios of €15101 and €6818 per 
QALY gained, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide is likely to be a cost-effective option for the 
treatment of Type 2 diabetes in a Greek setting.

Nonmalignant blood disorders currently affect millions of Americans, and their 
prevalence is expected to grow over the next several decades. This is owing to 
improvements in treatment leading to increased life expectancy of people with 
hereditary conditions, like sickle cell disease and hemophilia, but also the 
rising occurrence of risk factors for venous thromboembolism. The lack of 
adequate surveillance systems to monitor these conditions and their associated 
health indicators is a significant barrier to successfully assess, inform, and 
measure prevention efforts and progress toward national health goals. CDC is 
strengthening surveillance activities for blood disorders by improving and 
developing new methods that are tailored to best capture and monitor the 
epidemiologic characteristics unique to each disorder. These activities will 
provide a robust evidence base for public health action to improve the health of 
patients affected by or at risk for these disorders.

Health statistics and epidemiologic studies have shown that Hispanics live 
longer than Non Hispanic Whites, despite a high prevalence of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) risk factors and an average low socioeconomic status, both strong 
predictors of CVD and mortality. This phenomenon has been dubbed "The Hispanic 
paradox" and has been demonstrated in old and contemporary cohorts. To date, no 
factor has been identified that could explain this phenomenon, but socio 
demographic factors, dietary intake and genetic predisposition have been 
proposed as possible explanations for the Hispanic paradox. As with the French 
paradox, where French were found to have a lower rate of coronary heart disease 
(CHD), helped to identify the role of the Mediterranean diet and wine 
consumption in the prevention of CHD, the Hispanic paradox could help identify 
protective factors against CHD. This article describes the current evidence 
supporting the existence of the Hispanic paradox and provides a brief review on 
the possible explanations.

Messenger RNAs lacking a stop codon trap ribosomes at their 3' ends, depleting 
the pool of ribosomes available for protein synthesis. In bacteria, a remarkable 
quality control system rescues and recycles stalled ribosomes in a process known 
as trans-translation. Acting as a tRNA, transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) is 
aminoacylated, delivered by EF-Tu to the ribosomal A site, and accepts the 
nascent polypeptide. Translation then resumes on a reading frame within tmRNA, 
encoding a short peptide tag that targets the nascent peptide for degradation by 
proteases. One unsolved issue in trans-translation is how tmRNA and its protein 
partner SmpB preferentially recognize stalled ribosomes and not actively 
translating ones. Here, we examine the effect of the length of the 3' extension 
of mRNA on each step of trans-translation by pre-steady-state kinetic methods 
and fluorescence polarization binding assays. Unexpectedly, EF-Tu activation and 
GTP hydrolysis occur rapidly regardless of the length of the mRNA, although the 
peptidyl transfer to tmRNA decreases as the mRNA 3' extension increases and the 
tmRNA·SmpB binds less tightly to the ribosome with an mRNA having a long 3' 
extension. From these results, we conclude that the tmRNA·SmpB complex 
dissociates during accommodation due to competition between the downstream mRNA 
and the C-terminal tail for the mRNA channel. Rejection of the tmRNA·SmpB 
complex during accommodation is reminiscent of the rejection of near-cognate 
tRNA from the ribosome in canonical translation.

Delayed maturity, low fecundity, and high adult survival are traits typical for 
species with a long-life expectancy. For such species, even a small change in 
adult survival can strongly affect the population dynamics and viability. We 
examined the effects of both regional and local climatic variability on adult 
survival of the little auk, a long-lived and numerous Arctic seabird species. We 
conducted a mark-resighting study for a period of 8 years (2006-2013) 
simultaneously at three little auk breeding sites that are influenced by the 
West Spitsbergen Current, which is the main carrier of warm, Atlantic water into 
the Arctic. We found that the survival of adult little auks was negatively 
correlated with both the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and local summer 
sea surface temperature (SST), with a time lag of 2 and 1 year, respectively. 
The effects of NAO and SST were likely mediated through a change in food quality 
and/or availability: (1) reproduction, growth, and development of Arctic Calanus 
copepods, the main prey of little auks, are negatively influenced by a reduction 
in sea ice, reduced ice algal production, and an earlier but shorter lasting 
spring bloom, all of which result from an increased NAO; (2) a high sea surface 
temperature shortens the reproductive period of Arctic Calanus, decreasing the 
number of eggs produced. A synchronous variation in survival rates at the 
different colonies indicates that climatic forcing was similar throughout the 
study area. Our findings suggest that a predicted warmer climate in the Arctic 
will negatively affect the population dynamics of the little auk, a high Arctic 
avian predator.

Life Expectancy Free of Chronic Condition-induced Activity Limitations Among 
White and Black Americans, 2000-2006.

Molla MT, Madans JH.

Objective-Life expectancy without activity limitations or active life expectancy 
is one of the health expectancy measures that is used to summarize population 
health. The measure differentiates the remaining years of life that are expected 
to be spent with activity limitations from expected years of life without 
activity limitations. The objective of this study was to estimate life 
expectancy with and without activity limitations for the white and black 
populations of the United States in the years 2000-2006, focusing on expected 
years free of chronic condition-induced activity limitations. Methods-Life 
expectancies for the total as well as the white and black populations for the 
years 2000-2006 were calculated separately using abridged single decrement life 
tables. Expected years of life with and without chronic condition-induced 
activity limitations were calculated using Sullivan's method. The statistical 
analysis is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center 
for Health Statistics. Results-Results of the study show that during the 7-year 
period, expected years free of chronic condition-induced activity limitations 
increased for the total population as well as the white and black populations of 
both sexes. For the total population, all males and all females, years free of 
chronic condition-induced activity limitations increased significantly at all 
ages except at 85 and over. Expected years free of chronic condition-induced 
activity limitations increased at age 75 and under for the white population and 
at age 65 and under for the black population.
