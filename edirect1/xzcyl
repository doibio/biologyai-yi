BACKGROUND: Orphan drugs offer important therapeutic options to patients 
suffering from rare conditions, but are typically considerably more expensive 
than non-orphan drugs, leading to questions about their cost-effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the value of orphan and non-orphan drugs approved by the 
FDA from 1999 through 2015.
DESIGN: We searched the PubMed database to identify estimates of incremental 
health gains (measured in quality-adjusted life-years, or QALYs) and incremental 
costs that were associated with orphan and non-orphan drugs compared with 
preexisting care. We excluded pharmaceutical industry-funded studies from the 
dataset. When a drug was approved for multiple indications, we considered each 
drug-indication pair separately. We then compared incremental QALY gains, 
incremental costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for orphan and 
non-orphan drugs using the Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test (to compare median values 
of the different distributions) and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test (to compare 
the shape of different distributions).
RESULTS: We identified estimates for 49 orphan drug-indication pairs, and for 
169 non-orphan drug-indication pairs. We found that orphan drug-indication pairs 
offered larger median incremental health gains than non-orphan drug-indication 
pairs (0.25 vs. 0.05 QALYs; MWU p = 0.0093, KS p = 0.02), but were associated 
with substantially higher costs ($47,652 vs. $2870; MWU p < 0.001, KS p < 0.001) 
and less favorable cost-effectiveness ($276,288 vs. $100,360 per QALY gained; 
MWU p = 0.0068, KS p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that orphan drugs often offer larger health 
gains than non-orphan drugs, but due to their substantially higher costs they 
tend to be less cost-effective than non-orphan drugs. Our findings highlight the 
challenge faced by health care payers to provide patients appropriate access to 
orphan drugs while achieving value from drug spending.

Echinococcosis caused by the larval form of Echinococcus granulosus (E. 
granulosus) is known as an important zoonotic disease in various parts of the 
world, including Iran. The genetic diversity of this parasite is very high, 
particularly in areas where the disease is endemic. It has been suggested in the 
literature from different parts of the world that diverse factors, such as 
parasite life cycle, transmission pathways, pathologic disease, immunization, 
and disease control can be affected by the genetic diversity of the parasite. 
Various studies indicated sheep strain G1 as the most common genotype throughout 
the world. This strain is commonly found in the liver and lung repeatedly 
causing echinococcosis in humans, sheep, and cattle. The present study was 
conducted to determine the genetic affinity between the protoscolex of E. 
granulosus in humans and sheep in East Azerbaijan province, Iran for the first 
time. A total of 120 hydatid cyst samples were collected, 60 of which were from 
people who referred to the hospitals of East Azerbaijan and 60 were from the 
sheep slaughtered in Tabriz slaughterhouse. Following DNA extraction, certain 
regions of the cox1 gene were amplified and evaluated by the polymerase chain 
reaction. The replicated parts in all isolates had the same size of 450 bp. 
Electrophoresis was followed by selecting a total of 60 suitable samples, 
including 30 human samples and 30 sheep samples and sending them for genome 
sequencing. The overlap of the samples was investigated using the BLAST 
software. The results of BLAST, sequencing, and overlap demonstrated a genetic 
linkage of approximately 91.76% between the protoscolex of E. granulosus in 
human and sheep.

Background: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) remains one of the most 
challenging malignancies to treat in the modern era. Most patients present with 
or develop recurrent/metastatic incurable disease with poor response rates to 
conventional chemotherapy, and life expectancy is short. Next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) can be leveraged in ATC to identify oncogenic alterations that 
can be targeted with molecularly specific therapy, offering new effective 
treatment options to a subset of patients. Patient Findings: A 73-year-old man 
presenting with locally advanced papillary thyroid carcinoma containing a minor 
component of ATC was treated with surgery and iodine-131. He developed 
biopsy-confirmed ATC distant metastases that progressed on cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. NGS revealed several alterations, including a CCDC6-RET gene 
fusion. The patient enrolled in LIBRETTO-001, a phase I/II trial of the potent 
and specific RET inhibitor, LOXO-292. The patient tolerated LOXO-292 well and 
experienced a deep and durable partial response, ongoing beyond 19 months. 
Conclusion: This clinically significant response achieved with LOXO-292 in a 
patient with a CCDC6-RET fusion-positive ATC who had exhausted conventional 
treatment options highlights the importance of conducting tumor genomic 
profiling in patients with ATC to identify uncommon but actionable genomic 
alterations, such as RET gene fusions.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the lifestyles, healthy living strategies and 
socio-cultural characteristics of elderly people who lived long and healthy.
METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional study. This study was conducted on 472 
elderly patients, aged 80 years and over, selected by random sampling method. 
The socio-demographic characteristics and daily living activities of the elderly 
were determined by face to face interview technique using the "Elderly 
Questionnaire" developed by the researchers in 2018. Chi-square test was used 
for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Based on the average age (84) of the elderly in the research group, it 
was seen that they were able to exceed the average life expectancy of their 
fathers (72) and mothers (73). It has been found that the participants live 
11-12 years longer than their parents. It was also found that more than half 
(51.9%) of the elderly have the habit of walking regularly every day. It was 
determined that the elderly mostly consumed vegetables and fruits (88.5%), milk 
and dairy products and meat, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The elderly stated that natural and healthy nutrition, working and 
staying away from stress in the top three places as the reason of their long and 
healthy life.

BACKGROUND: Both amisulpride and olanzapine are leading treatments for 
schizophrenia in China. This study aimed to investigate the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of amisulpride and olanzapine in the treatment of 
schizophrenia in China.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to simulate the lifetime 
clinical and economic outcomes of schizophrenia treatment from the healthcare 
payer perspective. The long-term costs and QALYs were estimated. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed to explore the impact of variance of parameters on the 
results.
RESULTS: Treatment with amisulpride provided an effectiveness gain of 16.59 
QALYs at an average cost of USD 25,884 whereas olanzapine resulted in 16.38 
QALYs at a cost of USD 34,839 over a lifetime horizon. One-way sensitivity 
analysis suggested that the most sensitive variable was the unit cost of 
olanzapine. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis based on a Monte Carlo 
simulation with a lifetime horizon, the probability of amisulpride being 
cost-effective was 99.8% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of USD 9,322, the GDP 
per capita in China 2018. A scenario analysis with updated olanzapine unit cost 
suggested an ICER of 7,857 USD/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Amisulpride is likely to be a cost-effective option with increased 
effectiveness compared with olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia 
patients in China.

INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a primary disease of the carbohydrate 
metabolism that is characterised by absolute or relative insulin deficiency, or 
insulin resistance. Although life expectancy is low for diabetic patients, the 
prognosis has been improved in recent decades. Metformin is an oral antidiabetic 
that reduces insulin resistance and plasma glucose levels by decreasing glucose 
production in the liver. It can be used as a standalone treatment or in 
combination with other antidiabetic medications or insulin. Urotensin 2 (U-II), 
which is one of the most effective known vasoconstrictor peptides, was observed 
to act as a vasoconstrictor in diseases such as hypertension and heart failure, 
and to induce vasodilation in healthy volunteers. Some studies have proposed 
that the activation of the U-II system could lead to metabolic syndrome. Certain 
studies have determined a link between DM and U-II. However, there exist no 
studies on the effects of U-II in recently diagnosed type 2 DM patients after 
metformin treatment. This study aims to investigate the plasma and saliva levels 
of U-II at diagnosis and after a three-month metformin treatment in recently 
diagnosed type 2 DM patients, and to compare these levels to those of healthy 
volunteers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study compared 30 recently diagnosed type 2 DM 
patients to their states after three-month metformin treatment and 30 healthy 
volunteers.
RESULTS: When compared with the control group, there was no significant increase 
in the plasma and saliva U-II levels of recently diagnosed type 2 DM patients. 
We determined a statistically significant increase in the plasma and saliva 
ureotensin-2 levels of recently diagnosed type 2 DM patients after a three-month 
metformin treatment (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that the patients with type 2 DM have a 
multifactorial aetiopathogenesis and an increase in U-II levels after metformin 
treatment. Metformin has no known effect on the U-II metabolism; therefore, the 
findings need confirmation through more clinical and experimental studies with 
more participants.

Following a rise in the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, many 
adults with CF form couple relationships. Yet, dyadic coping has not been 
previously examined in people with CF. This study examined how adults with CF 
and their partners cope as a couple with the illness, and what meanings each 
partner and the couple as a unit attribute to the experience. Seventeen adult CF 
patients and their partners participated in separate semi-structured in-depth 
interviews. Two main patterns of dyadic coping with CF were identified as 
follows: cooperation and tension. For couples in cooperation, the marital 
relationship served as a resource for adaptive coping. These couples were 
characterized by similarities in their perception of the place of CF in their 
lives and of their roles in the marital relationship. Couples in tension 
described the couple relationship as strained by difficulty of accepting the 
disease, proliferation of negative emotions, and a sense of burden and 
loneliness in the process of coping. Findings point to the importance of mutual 
empathy, clear and accepted division of roles between the partners, and open 
communication for facilitating coping as a couple.

Publisher: Después de un aumento de la expectativa de vida de los pacientes con 
fibrosis quística, muchos adultos con fibrosis quística forman relaciones de 
pareja. Sin embargo, no se ha analizado previamente el afrontamiento diádico en 
personas con esta enfermedad. Este estudio analizó cómo los adultos con fibrosis 
quística y sus parejas afrontan como pareja la enfermedad, y qué significados 
cada integrante de la pareja y la pareja como unidad atribuyen a la experiencia. 
Diecisiete pacientes adultos con fibrosis quística y sus parejas participaron en 
entrevistas individuales, detalladas y semiestructuradas. Se identificaron dos 
patrones principales de afrontamiento diádico de la fibrosis quística: la 
cooperación y la tensión. En las parejas del patrón de cooperación, la relación 
conyugal sirvió como recurso para el afrontamiento adaptativo. Estas parejas se 
caracterizaron por similitudes en su percepción del lugar que ocupa la fibrosis 
quística en sus vidas y de sus roles en la relación conyugal. Las parejas del 
patrón de tensión describieron la relación de pareja como deteriorada por la 
dificultad de aceptar la enfermedad, la proliferación de emociones negativas y 
una sensación de carga y soledad en el proceso de afrontamiento. Los resultados 
señalan la importancia de la empatía mutua, una división clara y aceptada de los 
roles entre los integrantes de la pareja y una comunicación abierta para 
facilitar el afrontamiento como pareja.

Publisher: 随着囊胞性纤维症（CF）患者寿命的延长，许多患有CF的成年人走进婚姻成为伴侣。然而，针对患有CF的一些人，尚未研究过伴侣双方的应对能力。 
本研究调查了患有CF的成年人和他们的伴侣作为一对夫妇如何应对疾病，以及伴侣作为个体和伴侣双方共同作为一个整体对经历这种疾病赋予了什么样的意义。研究对象是17名成年CF患者及其伴侣，他们都参加了单独的半结构化深入访谈。本研究总结出了双方应对疾病时的两个主要模式：合作融洽和关系紧张。对于合作模式的伴侣来说，婚姻关系成为调适应对策略的资源。这些伴侣的特点有他们看待CF在生活中的地位时和他们看待各自在婚姻关系中角色时有相似性。关系紧张的伴侣形容伴侣关系时认为他们的关系因为这些方面变得紧张：难以接受疾病、消极情绪的扩散以及应对过程中视疾病为负担和孤独感。调查结果指出，作为一对伴侣一起促进对疾病的应对，以下方面非常重要：对彼此持有同理心、伴侣之间有明确的和双方接受的角色划分以及开放性地坦诚沟通。.

Pressure ulcers/injuries (PU/Is) affect the social, mental, and physical 
well-being of patients; increase treatment costs; prolong hospital stays; 
increase patient risk for infections; and may independently decrease life 
expectancy.
PURPOSE: The aim of this retrospective study was to examine the association 
between PU/I development and mortality in a large cohort of consecutively 
admitted critically ill patients.
METHODS: Data from adult patients ( >18 years of age) admitted to an intensive 
care unit (ICU) between 2010 and 2013 were extracted from the ICU electronic 
clinical information system. Patients were excluded if they had a PU/I present 
on admission, no recorded admission modified Jackson/Cubbin (mJ/C) or Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, or their ICU outcome was undetermined. 
The mJ/C risk scale (score range 9-48) was used to assess the PU/I risk (the 
lower the score, the higher the PU/I risk), the SOFA score (score range 0-24; 
the higher the SOFA score, the sicker the patient, with a higher risk of death) 
was used to assess the severity of the condition and outcome. ICU outcome was 
defined as 1) moved from the ICU to a ward/recovering or 2) no response to ICU 
treatment/deceased. All data were transferred to statistical software for 
analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the outcome related 
to PU/I development, SOFA, and mJ/C scores. Descriptive contingency tables of 
different scenarios were used to further evaluate relationships among different 
risk factors related to mortality; the Wald χ2 test was used to assess the 
statistical significance of the contingency tables.
RESULTS: Of the 6582 patients admitted, 6089 were included for analysis. Two 
hundred, one (201) had a PU/In on admission, 212 had missing mJ/C or SOFA 
scores, and ICU outcome was undetermined in 80 patients. Patient mean age was 
61.1 ± 15.8 (range 18-94) years; 3891 (63.9%) were male, average length of stay 
(LOS) was 3.6 days, denoted by quartile (Q) (median 1.58 days; Q1: 0.9, Q3: 3.9 
days), and 1589 (26.1%) stayed 3 days or more in the ICU. The incidence of PU/I 
was 6.9% (423 patients), and ICU mortality rate was 9.1% (n=553). The mean LOS 
of patients with PU/I was 13.35 ± 15.56 days (median 8.95, Q1: 4.88, Q3: 16.2) 
and 2.84 ± 3.87 days for patients with no PU/I (median: 1.20, Q1: 0.90, Q3: 
3.17; P <.0001). Mean LOS was 3.42 ± 5.95 days (median: 1.30, Q1: 0.90, Q3: 
3.70) among recovering and 5.00 ± 7.17 days among deceased patients (median 
2.56, Q1: 1.26, Q3: 6.40; P <.0001). The proportion of patients with an 
admission mJ/C score of 29 or less ranged from 48.8% to 51.5%, and the mean SOFA 
score was 7.0 ± 3.2. PU/I development and SOFA or mJ/C scores were independent 
predictors of mortality. The probability of a negative outcome was higher in 
persons with PU/Is compared to persons with no PU/Is. Persons with lower SOFA 
scores (ie, less severely ill patients) and higher mJ/C scores for each factor 
separately (ie, at low risk of PU/I development) each factor separately had a 
lower mortality risk.
CONCLUSION: PU/I development in critically ill patients treated at an ICU is an 
independent predictor of mortality, even though the PU/I incidence and hospital 
mortality were relatively low. The ICU admission SOFA and mJ/C score also were 
independent prognosticators of ICU mortality. Future research could focus on the 
role of different steps in the cascade of PU/I development, especially to the 
role of inflammation.

BACKGROUND: In this retrospective study, we evaluated the biochemical recurrence 
rate, metastatic disease progression, and prostate cancer-specific and overall 
survival in patients curatively treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) 
for early prostate cancer (PC). We also examined the prognostic effect of 
comorbidity by Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and overall performance status 
by Eastern Clinical Oncology Group (ECOG) score.
METHODS: A total of 665 men treated between 2008 and 2013 were enrolled from 
Tampere University Hospital, Finland. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests and 
hospital records were used to determine the 5-year survival for each 
aforementioned endpoint using a Kaplan-Meyer estimate. To analyze the impact of 
the selected prognostic factor, we used a Cox regression model to calculate the 
corresponding hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: With a median follow-up-time of 7.12 years, the 5-year overall survival 
(OS) after EBRT was 88.9% [86.5 -91.3%], prostate cancer-specific survival 
(PCSS) was 97.9% [96.7 -99.1%], metastasis-free survival (MFS) 94.8% [93.0 
-96.6%] and biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) 88.7% [86.2 -91.2%]. 
Both CCI (HR = 1.38, [1.25-1.51]) and ECOG score (HR = 1.63, [1.29-2.05]) 
declined OS, as well as Gleason score and T score (P <  0.05). Gleason score and 
T grade also associated to worse PCSS, MFS and BRFS.
CONCLUSIONS: CCI and ECOG score are useful tools in evaluating the overall life 
expectancy of the patient after EBRT for PC. T-stage and Gleason score remain 
still the major prognostic factors.

OBJECTIVE: Bereavement care is one of the major components of hospice palliative 
care. Previous studies revealed the barriers to the success of the system, 
including lack of time or support from mental health professionals. Few studies 
have explored the intrapersonal barriers to bereavement care by clinical staff. 
The aims of the study were to explore (1) the emotional and cognitive barriers 
of bereavement care by hospice palliative care staff and (2) the demographic and 
work characteristics related to these emotional and cognitive barriers.
METHOD: The participants were clinical staff (n = 301) who were working in 
hospice palliative care units, including hospice wards, home care, and 
hospital-based palliative care teams. Their professional backgrounds included 
physicians (n = 12), nurses (n = 172), social workers (n = 59), psychologists (n 
= 34), spiritual care specialists (n = 15), and others (n = 9). A 
cross-sectional design was used and a standardized questionnaire including 
emotional and cognitive barriers was developed. Information on demographic and 
work characteristics was also collected. Content validity index, an exploratory 
factor analysis, and multiple regression analysis were conducted.
RESULTS: One emotional barrier, "negative emotional reactions" (13 items, 
Cronbach's α = 0.92), and three cognitive barriers, "lack of ability" (7 items, 
Cronbach's α = 0.85), "belief in avoidance" (5 items, Cronbach's α = 0.86), and 
"outcome expectancy" (4 items, Cronbach's α = 0.85) were identified. Clinical 
staff who had higher working stress, lower self-rated ability for bereavement 
care, and higher negative impact from major life loss tended to have higher 
emotional and cognitive barriers.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Clinical staff should be aware of intrapersonal 
barriers to bereavement care. Educational programs should be developed to 
improve the ability to engage in bereavement care.

University, Delhi, India.

BACKGROUND: The mobilization of resources to prevent and treat human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is 
unparalleled in the history of public health. The uptake of antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) has been rapid and unprecedented and made possible by the 
availability of funding - external and domestic. To justify continuous funding 
of ART in resource-scarce settings, a spate of cost-effectiveness studies has 
been undertaken in a number of countries. This paper is based on a systematic 
review of global studies on cost-effectiveness analysis of ART.
OBJECTIVES: The major objective was to review the existing literature on 
cost-effectiveness of ART to determine whether ART has been cost-effective (CE) 
in different settings.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for articles published between 
2008 and 2017. We included studies that measured costs as well as effectiveness 
of HIV treatment - specifically ART - using incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
as one of the outcomes.
RESULTS: We identified 15 studies that met the search criteria for inclusion in 
the systematic review. The review confirms that ART programs have been CE across 
different settings, contexts, and strategies.
CONCLUSION: The review would be useful for countries that are straining to raise 
funds for the health sector, generally, and for AIDS prevention and control 
program, specifically. This would also be beneficial for carrying out similar 
studies, if necessary, and as an advocacy tool for garnering additional funding.

Health System Outcomes in BRICS Countries and Their Association With the 
Economic Context.

The aim of the article is to compare health system outcomes in the BRICS 
countries, assess the trends of their changes in 2000-2017, and verify whether 
they are in any way correlated with the economic context. The indicators 
considered were: nominal and per capita current health expenditure, government 
health expenditure, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, GDP growth, 
unemployment, inflation, and composition of GDP. The study covered five 
countries of the BRICS group over a period of 18 years. We decided to 
characterize countries covered with a dataset of selected indicators describing 
population health status, namely: life expectancy at birth, level of 
immunization, infant mortality rate, maternal mortality ratio, and tuberculosis 
case detection rate. We constructed a unified synthetic measure depicting the 
performance of individual health systems in terms of their outcomes with a 
single numerical value. Descriptive statistical analysis of quantitative traits 
consisted of the arithmetic mean (xsr), standard deviation (SD), and, where 
needed, the median. The normality of the distribution of variables was tested 
with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Spearman's rho and Kendall tau rank coefficients 
were used for correlation analysis between measures. The correlation analyses 
have been supplemented with factor analysis. We found that the best results in 
terms of health care system performance were recorded in Russia, China, and 
Brazil. India and South Africa are noticeably worse. However, the entire group 
performs visibly worse than the developed countries. The health system outcomes 
appeared to correlate on a statistically significant scale with health 
expenditures per capita, governments involvement in health expenditures, GDP per 
capita, and industry share in GDP; however, these correlations are relatively 
weak, with the highest strength in the case of government's involvement in 
health expenditures and GDP per capita. Due to weak correlation with economic 
background, other factors may play a role in determining health system outcomes 
in BRICS countries. More research should be recommended to find them and 
determine to what extent and how exactly they affect health system outcomes.

Services, Trento, Italy.

PURPOSE: This article provides an overview on the current worldwide disease 
epidemiology in older persons, analyzing information contained in the World 
Health Organization (WHO) health data and statistics database.
METHODS: Epidemiology data on diseases in older persons (i.e., in subjects aged 
60 years or older) were retrieved from the official WHO health data and 
statistics database.
RESULTS: Ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) are the leading causes of disability and death in older people, 
whilst dementias have displayed the largest increase during the past 16 years. 
With only few exceptions, significant sex difference can be observed in the 
majority of diseases causing disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths 
in older people. DALYs are mostly caused by IHD, malignancies, COPD and 
cirrhosis in older men; whilst dementias, hearing loss, falls, hypertensive 
heart disease, back and neck pain and diarrheal diseases cause larger health 
loss in older women. Death rate for malignancies (except colorectal cancer), 
COPD, cirrhosis and tuberculosis is larger in older men; whilst mortality for 
cardiovascular disorders, dementias and diarrheal diseases is larger in older 
women. IHD is the leading cause of health loss and deaths in nearly all WHO 
regions, whilst infectious diseases still cause a substantial epidemiologic 
burden in Africa.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancers and dementias will probably display the highest mortality 
escalation during the next 40 years.

Background. There is growing evidence that quality of life (QoL) has a strong 
association with mortality. However, incorporation of QoL is uncommon in 
standard survival modeling. Methods. Using data extracted from a registry of 
patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR), the impact of incorporating 
QoL in survival modeling was explored using 4 parametric survival models. QoL 
was incorporated and tested in 2 forms, which are baseline and change in QoL due 
to intervention. Life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 
calculated and comparisons made to a reference model (no QoL) to translate the 
findings in the context of modeled economic evaluations. Results. A total of 
2858 TKR cases (2309 patients) who had TKR between 2006 and 2015 were included 
in this analysis. Increases in baseline and change in QoL were associated with a 
reduction in mortality. Compared to the reference model, differences of up to 
0.32 life years and 0.53 QALYs were observed, and these translated into a 9.5% 
change in incremental effectiveness. These differences were much larger as the 
strength of the association between QoL and mortality increased. Conclusions. 
This work has demonstrated that the inclusion of QoL measures (at baseline and 
change from baseline) when extrapolating survival does matter. It can influence 
health outcomes such as life expectancy and QALYs, which are relevant in 
cost-effectiveness analysis. This is important because neglecting the 
correlation between QoL and mortality can lead to imprecise extrapolations and 
thus risk misleading results affecting subsequent decisions made by policy 
makers.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common disease to increase as life 
expectancy increases. Most high-profile pharmacological treatments for 
age-related CVD have led to inefficacious results, implying that novel 
approaches to treating these pathologies are needed. Emerging data have 
demonstrated that senescent cardiovascular cells, which are characterized by 
irreversible cell cycle arrest and a distinct senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype, accumulate in aged or diseased cardiovascular systems, suggesting 
that they may impair cardiovascular function. This review discusses the evidence 
implicating senescent cells in cardiovascular ageing, the onset and progression 
of CVD, and the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular cell senescence. 
We also review eradication of senescent cardiovascular cells by 
small-molecule-drug-mediated apoptosis and immune cell-mediated efferocytosis 
and toxicity as promising and precisely targeted therapeutics for CVD prevention 
and treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Gram-negative bacteria are among the causative microorganisms for 
zoonotic diseases in humans and teleosts. Outer membrane proteins (Omps) of 
Aeromonas hydrophila, a gram-negative bacterium, are critical for the 
subcellular integration to eukaryotic cell that can modulate the functions of 
macrophages. Hence Omps are recognized as immune markers for the vaccine 
development.
METHODS: In the present study, a 3-D model of Omps was identified using in 
silico technique and recognized through the Swiss model web-server and confirmed 
with Procheck and ProSA server.. The B-cell binding sites of the protein were 
selected from sequence alignment.. Further, the identification of B-cell epitope 
was carried out using modules of BCpred server (i.e., BCPred and Amino Acid 
Pairs). The identified antigenic amino acid sequences for B-cells were used to 
determine the T-cell epitope (both MHC I & II allelic binding sequences) using 
ProPred 1 and ProPred servers.
RESULTS: The epitopic regions (9 mer: LAGKTTNES and GFDGSQYGK) in the Omps that 
are bound together with the MHC molecules (MHC-I & II), and have maximum 
possible numbers of MHC alleles are recognized. It was observed that Omps of A. 
hydrophila are conserved across the serotypes and are immunogenic. These 
epitopes can stimulate significant immune responses and can be advantageous 
while preparing peptide-based vaccines against A. hydrophila infections. Thus, 
suggesting the use of Omps in the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics 
against the bacterial diseases in humans and teleosts.

BACKGROUND: Stroke and dementia have several modifiable risk factors in common. 
In the primary care prevention project INVADE (INtervention project on VAscular 
brain diseases and Dementia in the district of Ebersberg), these vascular risk 
factors were recorded systematically and treated according to evidence-based 
guidelines.
METHODS: All insurants of the AOK Bayern who were ≥ 50 years of age and lived in 
the Upper Bavarian district of Ebersberg received the offer to participate in 
INVADE, about one-third enrolled in the program. Examinations by the family 
doctor, self-reports of the participants, laboratory analyses, and a duplex 
sonography of the extracranial neck vessels were used to create individual risk 
profiles, from which the intervention measures were derived. GPs documented the 
treatment and health status of the participants at quarterly intervals. The 
entire examination program was repeated every two years. The success of the 
intervention was determined in comparison with the district of Dachau, where the 
insurants received the primary care treatment as usual. Administrative data of 
the health and long-term care fund for the period from 2013 to 2016 were used as 
clinical endpoints. Primary endpoints included mortality and onset of long-term 
care, secondary endpoints were inpatient treatments due to cerebrovascular 
disease.
RESULTS: The comparison between the district of Ebersberg (N = 10.663) and the 
district of Dachau (N = 13.225) was in favor of the prevention program for both 
the primary clinical endpoints and the combined secondary endpoint. Mortality 
risk (HR = 0.90; 95 % confidence interval: 0.84-0.97), long-term care risk 
(HR = 0.88; 0.81-0.96), and the likelihood of inpatient treatment for 
cerebrovascular disease (OR = 0.87; 0.77-0.97) were significantly reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: The results support the assumption that the incidence of 
cerebrovascular disease and dementia can be reduced by a systematic 
general-practice based identification and treatment of vascular risk factors and 
can thus increase life expectancy and disability-free life time.

Publisher: EINLEITUNG: Schlaganfall und Demenz haben zahlreiche modifizierbare 
Risikofaktoren gemeinsam. Im hausärztlichen Präventionsprojekt INVADE 
(INterventionsprojekt VAskuläre Hirnerkrankungen und Demenz im Landkreis 
Ebersberg) wurden diese vaskulären Risikofaktoren systematisch erfasst und 
evidenzbasiert behandelt.
METHODEN: Alle über 50-jährigen Versicherten der AOK Bayern mit Wohnsitz im 
oberbayerischen Landkreis Ebersberg erhielten das Angebot zur Teilnahme an 
INVADE, rund 1 Drittel schrieb sich in das Programm ein. Durch hausärztliche 
Untersuchungen, Selbstauskünfte der Versicherten, Laboranalysen und eine 
Duplexsonografie der extrakraniellen Halsgefäße wurden individuelle 
Risikoprofile erstellt, aus denen sich die Interventionsmaßnahmen ableiteten. In 
jedem Quartal dokumentierten die Hausärzte Behandlung und Gesundheitszustand der 
Teilnehmer, nach jeweils 2 Jahren wurde das gesamte Untersuchungsprogramm 
wiederholt. Der Erfolg der Intervention wurde am Landkreis Dachau bemessen, wo 
die Versicherten die übliche hausärztliche Versorgung erhielten. Als Endpunkte 
wurden administrative Daten der Kranken- und Pflegekasse für den Zeitraum von 
2013 bis 2016 verwendet. Primäre Endpunkte bestanden in der Mortalität und im 
Eintritt von Pflegebedürftigkeit, sekundäre Endpunkte in den stationären 
Behandlungen infolge von zerebrovaskulären Erkrankungen.
ERGEBNISSE: Der Vergleich zwischen den Versicherten im Landkreis Ebersberg 
(n = 10 663) und im Landkreis Dachau (n = 13 225) fiel sowohl in den primären 
klinischen Endpunkten als auch im kombinierten sekundären Endpunkt zugunsten des 
Präventionsprogramms aus. Mortalitätsrisiko (HR = 0,90; 95 %-Konfidenzintervall: 
0,84–0,97), Pflegebedürftigkeitsrisiko (HR = 0,88; 95 %-KI 0,81–0,96) und die 
Wahrscheinlichkeit einer stationären Behandlung aufgrund zerebrovaskulärer 
Erkrankungen (OR = 0,87; 95 %-KI 0,77–0,97) waren signifikant reduziert.
DISKUSSION: Die Ergebnisse stützen die Annahme, dass durch eine intensivierte 
hausärztliche Identifikation und Behandlung vaskulärer Risikofaktoren das 
Auftreten von zerebrovaskulären Erkrankungen und Demenzen gesenkt werden kann 
und sich damit Lebenserwartung und von Pflegebedürftigkeit freie Lebenserwartung 
erhöhen lassen. Registrierung clinicaltrials.gov, NCT1107548,

BACKGROUND: Community water fluoridation (CWF) is considered one of the 10 
greatest public health achievements of the twentieth century and has been a 
cornerstone strategies for the prevention and control of dental caries in many 
countries. However, for decision-makers the effectiveness and safety of any 
given intervention is not always sufficient to decide on the best option. 
Economic evaluations (EE) provide key information that managers weigh, alongside 
other evidence. This study reviews the relevant literature on EE in CWF.
METHODS: A systematic database search up to August 2019 was carried out using 
MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, LILACS, Paediatric Economic Database 
Evaluation and National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database. The review 
included full economic evaluations on CWF programs, written in English, Spanish 
or Portuguese. The selection process and data extraction were carried out by two 
researchers independently. A qualitative synthesis of the results was performed.
RESULTS: Of 498 identified articles, 24 studies met the inclusion criteria; 11 
corresponded to cost-benefit analysis; nine were cost-effectiveness analyses; 
and four cost-utility studies. Two cost-utility studies used Disability-Adjusted 
Life Years,, one used Quality-Adjusted Tooth Years, and another Quality-Adjusted 
Life Years. EEs were conducted in eight countries. All studies concluded that 
water fluoridation was a cost-effective strategy when it was compared with 
non-fluoridated communities, independently of the perspective, time horizon or 
discount rate applied. Four studies adopted a lifetime time horizon. The outcome 
measures included caries averted (n = 14) and savings cost of dental treatment 
(n = 4). Most of the studies reported a caries reduction effects between 25 and 
40%.
CONCLUSION: Findings indicated that CWF represents an appropriate use of 
communities' resources, using a range of economic evaluation methods and in 
different locations. These findings provide evidence to decision-makers which 
they could use as an aid to deciding on resource allocation.

BACKGROUND: Raine syndrome (RS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by 
biallelic loss-of-function mutations of FAM20C. The most common clinical 
features are microcephaly, exophthalmos, hypoplastic nose and severe midface 
hypoplasia, leading to choanal atresia. The radiological findings include 
generalized osteosclerosis and brain calcifications. RS is usually lethal during 
the neonatal period due to severe respiratory distress. However, there exists a 
non-lethal RS form, the phenotype of which is extremely heterogeneous. There is 
paucity of data about clinical course and life expectancy of these patients.
RESULTS: This is the first description of follow-up features of non-lethal RS 
patients. Moreover, we present three unpublished cases. There are five Asian and 
two Arab patients. All were born to consanguineous parents. The most common 
neonatal comorbidity was respiratory distress secondary to choanal atresia. A 
variable degree of neurodevelopmental delay was seen in the majority of our 
cases and seizures and hearing or vision involvement were also frequent. 
Neurological and orthopedic issues were the most frequent complications seen at 
follow-up in our group. Persistent hypophosphatemic rickets was the most 
striking endocrinological manifestation, which was scarcely responsive to 
therapy with phosphate salts and alfacalcidol. Life expectancy of our patients 
goes beyond childhood, with the oldest of those described being 18 years old at 
present.
CONCLUSIONS: Manifestations of RS in those surviving the neonatal period are 
being increasingly recognized. Our study supports previous findings and provides 
clinical and biochemical observations and data from longer follow up. Finally, 
we propose multidisciplinary follow up for patients with non-lethal RS.
