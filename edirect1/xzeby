(CVH), estimated by the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 (LE8) 
metrics, with life expectancy free of major chronic disease, including 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, cancer, and dementia, in UK adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included 135 199 adults in 
the UK Biobank study who were initially free of major chronic disease and had 
complete data on LE8 metrics. Data analyses were performed in August 2022.
EXPOSURES: Cardiovascular health levels, as estimated by LE8 score. The LE8 
score, which consists of 8 components: (1) diet, (2) physical activity, (3) 
tobacco/nicotine exposure, (4) sleep, (5) body mass index, (6) non-high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, (7) blood glucose, and (8) blood pressure. The CVH 
level was evaluated at baseline and categorized into low (LE8 score <50), 
moderate (LE8 score ≥50 but <80), and high (LE8 score ≥80) levels.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the life expectancy free of 
4 major chronic diseases (CVD, diabetes, cancer, and dementia).
RESULTS: Of the 135 199 adults (44.7% men; mean [SD] age, 55.4 [7.9] years) 
included in the study, a total of 4712, 48 955, and 6748 men had low, moderate, 
and high CVH levels, respectively, and the corresponding numbers for women were 
3661, 52 192, and 18 931. At age 50 years, the estimated disease-free years were 
21.5 (95% CI, 21.0-22.0), 25.5 (95% CI, 25.4-25.6), and 28.4 (95% CI, 27.8-29.0) 
for men with low, moderate, and high CVH levels, respectively; the corresponding 
estimated disease-free years at age 50 years for women were 24.2 (95% CI, 
23.5-24.8), 30.5 (95% CI, 30.4-30.6), and 33.6 (95% CI, 33.1-34.0). 
Equivalently, men with moderate or high CVH levels lived on average 4.0 (95% CI, 
3.4-4.5) or 6.9 (95% CI, 6.1-7.7) longer years free of chronic disease, 
respectively, at age 50 years, compared with men with low CVH levels. The 
corresponding longer years lived free of disease for women were 6.3 (95% CI, 
5.6-7.0) or 9.4 (95% CI, 8.5-10.2). For participants with high CVH level, there 
was not a statistically significant difference in disease-free life expectancy 
between participants with low and other socioeconomic status.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, a high level of CVH, evaluated 
using the LE8 metrics, was associated with longer life expectancy free of major 
chronic diseases and may contribute to narrowing socioeconomic health 
inequalities in both men and women.

Long-term efficacy and safety of the extended half-life recombinant factor IX Fc 
fusion protein (rFIXFc) has been established among previously treated patients 
with severe hemophilia B in 2 phase 3 trials (B-LONG [#NCT01027364] and Kids 
B-LONG [#NCT01440946]) and a long-term extension study (B-YOND [#NCT01425723]). 
In this study, we report post hoc analyses of pooled longitudinal data for up to 
6.5 years for rFIXFc prophylaxis. In the B-LONG study, subjects ≥12 years 
received weekly dose-adjusted prophylaxis (WP; starting dose, 50 IU/kg), 
individualized interval-adjusted prophylaxis (IP; initially, 100 IU/kg every 
10 days), or on-demand dosing. In the Kids B-LONG study, subjects <12 years 
received 50 to 60 IU/kg every 7 days, adjusted as needed. In the B-YOND study, 
subjects received WP (20-100 IU/kg every 7 days), IP (100 IU/kg every 
8-16 days), modified prophylaxis, or on-demand dosing; switching between 
treatment groups was permitted. A total of 123 subjects from B-LONG and 30 from 
Kids B-LONG study were included, of whom 93 and 27, respectively, enrolled in 
the B-YOND study. The median cumulative duration of treatment was 3.63 years 
(range, 0.003-6.48 years) in B-LONG/B-YOND and 2.88 years (range, 0.30-4.80 
years) in Kids B-LONG/B-YOND group. Annualized bleed rates (ABRs) remained low, 
annualized factor consumption remained stable, and adherence remained high 
throughout treatment. Low ABRs were also maintained in subjects with dosing 
intervals ≥14 days or with target joints at baseline. Complete resolution of 
evaluable target joints and no recurrence in 90.2% of baseline target joints 
during follow-up were observed. rFIXFc prophylaxis was associated with sustained 
clinical benefits, including long-term bleed prevention and target joint 
resolution, for severe hemophilia B.

Tackling the mechanisms underlying ageing is desirable to help to extend the 
duration and improve the quality of life. Life extension has been achieved in 
animal models by suppressing the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor 1 
(IGF-1) axis and also via dietary restriction. Metformin has become the focus of 
increased interest as a possible anti-ageing drug. There is some overlap in the 
postulated mechanisms of how these three approaches could produce anti-ageing 
effects, with convergence on common downstream pathways. In this Review, we draw 
on evidence from both animal models and human studies to assess the effects of 
suppression of the growth hormone-IGF-1 axis, dietary restriction, and metformin 
on ageing.

BACKGROUND: A series of phase 3 clinical trials have demonstrated that 
elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) is safe and efficacious 
in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) aged ≥12 years with ≥1 F508del mutation in 
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The impact 
of this treatment on lifetime clinical outcomes and survival, however, has yet 
to be assessed.
METHODS: We used a person-level microsimulation model to estimate the survival 
and lifetime clinical benefits of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment versus other CFTR 
modulator combinations (tezacaftor plus ivacaftor [TEZ/IVA] or lumacaftor plus 
ivacaftor [LUM/IVA]) or best supportive care (BSC) alone in pwCF aged ≥12 years 
who are homozygous for F508del-CFTR. Disease progression inputs were derived 
from published literature; clinical efficacy inputs were derived from an 
indirect treatment comparison conducted using relevant phase 3 clinical trial 
data and extrapolations of clinical data.
RESULTS: The median projected survival for pwCF homozygous for F508del-CFTR 
treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA was 71.6 years. This was an increase of 23.2 years 
versus TEZ/IVA, 26.2 years versus LUM/IVA, and 33.5 years versus BSC alone. 
Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA also reduced disease severity as well as the number 
of pulmonary exacerbations and lung transplants. In a scenario analysis, the 
median projected survival for pwCF initiating ELX/TEZ/IVA between the ages of 12 
and 17 years was 82.5 years, an increase of 45.4 years compared with BSC alone.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from our model suggest ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment may 
substantially increase survival for pwCF, with early initiation potentially 
allowing pwCF to achieve near-normal life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: A common challenge in health technology assessments (HTAs) of cancer 
treatments is how subsequent therapy use within the trial follow-up may 
influence cost-effectiveness model outcomes. Although overall survival (OS) is 
often a key driver of model results, there are no guidelines to advise how to 
adjust for this potential confounding, with different approaches available 
dependent on the model structure.
OBJECTIVE: We compared a partitioned survival analysis (PartSA) with a 
semi-Markov multi-state model (MSM) structure, with and without attempts to 
adjust for the impact of subsequent therapies on OS using a case study 
describing outcomes for people with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
METHODS: Both model structures included three health states: pre-progression, 
progressed disease and death. Three traditional crossover methods were 
considered within the context of the PartSA, whereas for the MSM, the 
probability of post-progression death was pooled across arms. Impacts on the 
model incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were recorded.
RESULTS: The unadjusted PartSA produced an ICER of £623,563, and after 
adjustment yielded an ICER range of £381,340-£386,907. The unadjusted MSM 
produced an ICER of £1,283,780. Adjusting OS in the MSM resulted in an ICER of 
£345,486.
CONCLUSIONS: The simplicity of the PartSA is lost when the decision problem 
becomes more complex (for example, when OS data are confounded by subsequent 
therapies). In this setting, the MSM structure may be considered more flexible, 
with fewer and less restrictive assumptions required versus the PartSA. 
Researchers should consider important study design features that may influence 
the generalisability of data when undertaking model conceptualisation.

BACKGROUND: Pain is a common symptom in palliative care cancer patients and is 
often insufficiently relieved. In recent years, transcranial direct-current 
stimulation (tDCS) of the motor cortex has been shown to be effective to treat 
chronic pain, essentially neuropathic pain. We propose to test the efficacy of 
tDCS in patients experiencing cancer pain in the palliative care setting.
METHOD/DESIGN: This article describes the protocol of a bicentre, randomized, 
parallel-arm, sham-controlled clinical trial evaluating tDCS in the treatment of 
palliative care patients with refractory cancer pain. Seventy patients between 
the ages of 18 and 80 years experiencing refractory pain with a pain score of 
4/10 on a numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 to 10 will be enrolled in 
this trial. The main exclusion criteria are patients unable to fill in the 
various rating scales and life expectancy less than 3 weeks. Treatment consists 
of 5 consecutive tDCS sessions targeting the motor cortex (one daily session for 
5 days) on the contralateral side to the pain. After randomization (1:1 ratio), 
35 patients will receive active stimulation and 35 patients will receive sham 
stimulation. The primary endpoint is the NRS score and the primary objective is 
a significant improvement of this score between the baseline score recorded 
between D-3 and D-1 and the score recorded 4 days after stopping treatment (D8). 
The secondary objectives are to evaluate whether this improvement is maintained 
16 days after stopping treatment (D21) and whether the following scores are 
improved on D14 and D21: Brief Pain Inventory, Edmonton Symptom Assessment 
System, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and 
Medication Quantification Scale.
DISCUSSION: Positive results of this trial would indicate that tDCS can improve 
pain and quality of life of cancer patients in the palliative care setting. 
Reduction of analgesic consumption and improvement of activities of daily living 
should allow many patients to return home with a decreased workload for 
caregivers.

BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is an aggressive, primary brain 
tumor. Despite extensive tumor resection followed by radio- and chemotherapy, 
life expectancy of GBM patients did not improve over decades. Several studies 
reported transcription deregulation in GBMs, but regulatory mechanisms driving 
overexpression of GBM-specific genes remain largely unknown. Transcription in 
open chromatin regions is directed by transcription factors (TFs) that bind to 
specific motifs, recruit co-activators/repressors and the transcriptional 
machinery. Identification of GBM-related TFs-gene regulatory networks may reveal 
new and targetable mechanisms of gliomagenesis.
RESULTS: We predicted TFs-regulated networks in GBMs in silico and intersected 
them with putative TF binding sites identified in the accessible chromatin in 
human glioma cells and GBM patient samples. The Cancer Genome Atlas and Glioma 
Atlas datasets (DNA methylation, H3K27 acetylation, transcriptomic profiles) 
were explored to elucidate TFs-gene regulatory networks and effects of the 
epigenetic background. In contrast to the majority of tumors, c-Jun expression 
was higher in GBMs than in normal brain and c-Jun binding sites were found in 
multiple genes overexpressed in GBMs, including VIM, FOSL2 or UPP1. Binding of 
c-Jun to the VIM gene promoter was stronger in GBM-derived cells than in cells 
derived from benign glioma as evidenced by gel shift and supershift assays. 
Regulatory regions of the majority of c-Jun targets have distinct DNA 
methylation patterns in GBMs as compared to benign gliomas, suggesting the 
contribution of DNA methylation to the c-Jun-dependent gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS: GBM-specific TFs-gene networks identified in GBMs differ from 
regulatory pathways attributed to benign brain tumors and imply a decisive role 
of c-Jun in controlling genes that drive glioma growth and invasion as well as a 
modulatory role of DNA methylation.

Physical exercise is of great significance for maintaining human health. 
Exercise can provide varying degrees of benefits to cognitive function at all 
stages of life cycle. Currently, with the aging of the world's population and 
increase of life expectancy, cognitive dysfunction has gradually become a 
disease of high incidence, which is accompanied by neurodegenerative diseases in 
elderly individuals. Patients often exhibit memory loss, aphasia and weakening 
of orientation once diagnosed, and are unable to have a normal life. Cognitive 
dysfunction largely affects the physical and mental health, reduces the quality 
of life, and causes a great economic burden to the society. At present, most of 
the interventions are aimed to maintain the current cognitive level and delay 
deterioration of cognition. In contrast, exercise as a nonpharmacological 
therapy has great advantages in its nontoxicity, low cost and universal 
application. The molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of exercise on 
cognition are complex, and studies have been extensively centered on neural 
plasticity, the direct target of exercise in the brain. In addition, 
mitochondrial stability and energy metabolism are essential for brain status. 
Meanwhile, the organ-brain axis responds to exercise and induces release of 
cytokines related to cognition. In this review, we summarize the latest evidence 
on the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of exercise on cognition, and 
point out directions for future research.

The sit-to-stand (STS) motion evaluates physical functions in frail older 
adults. Mounting sensors or using a camera is necessary to measure trunk 
movement during STS motion. Therefore, we developed a simple measurement method 
by embedding laser range finders in the backrests and seats of chairs that can 
be used in daily life situations. The objective of this study was to validate 
the performance of the proposed measurement method in comparison with that of 
the optical motion capture (MoCap) system during STS motion. The STS motions of 
three healthy young adults were simultaneously measured under seven conditions 
using a chair with embedded sensors and the optical MoCap system. We evaluated 
the waveform similarity, absolute error, and relationship of the trunk joint 
angular excursions between these measurement methods. The experimental results 
indicated high waveform similarity in the trunk flexion phase regardless of STS 
conditions. Furthermore, a strong relationship was observed between the two 
measurement methods with respect to the angular excursion of the trunk flexion. 
Although the angular excursion of the trunk extension exhibited a large error, 
the developed chair with embedded sensors evaluated trunk flexion during the STS 
motion, which is a characteristic of frail older adults.

Continuous monitoring of health status has the potential to enhance the quality 
of life and life expectancy of people suffering from chronic illness and of the 
elderly. However, such systems can only come into widespread use if the cost of 
manufacturing is low. Advancements in material science and engineering 
technology have led to a significant decrease in the expense of developing 
healthcare monitoring devices. This review aims to investigate the progress of 
the use of low-cost sensors in healthcare monitoring and discusses the 
challenges faced when accomplishing continuous and real-time monitoring tasks. 
The major findings include (1) only a small number of publications (N = 50) have 
addressed the issue of healthcare monitoring applications using low-cost sensors 
over the past two decades; (2) the top three algorithms used to process sensor 
data include SA (Statistical Analysis, 30%), SVM (Support Vector Machine, 18%), 
and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour, 12%); and (3) wireless communication techniques 
(Zigbee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and RF) serve as the major data transmission tools 
(77%) followed by cable connection (13%) and SD card data storage (10%). Due to 
the small fraction (N = 50) of low-cost sensor-based studies among thousands of 
published articles about healthcare monitoring, this review not only summarises 
the progress of related research but calls for researchers to devote more effort 
to the consideration of cost reduction as well as the size of these components.

A large percentage of power, petroleum, and chemical plants over the world were 
in operation for a long duration with the corresponding critical components 
being used beyond the design life of 30 to 40 years. It is generally more 
cost-effective to refurbish or modernize the degraded equipment or components, 
rather than to construct a new plant. Therefore, a reliable plant life extension 
assessment that can evaluate the critical components is needed. The key element 
in plant life extension is the residual life assessment technology. However, at 
present, there is still no general consensus among the industry players on the 
approach to adopt when performing residual life assessment for such a critical 
damage mechanism as creep. In this article, a three-level residual life 
assessment methodology is proposed as a general approach for high-temperature 
components prone to creep. A detailed validation of the selected guidelines and 
calculation models is also described. Eventually, an application of the 
three-level methodology to a real industrial case study is presented.

The aim of the present study was to investigate if the presence of anterior 
cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk factors depicted in the laboratory would 
reflect at-risk patterns in football-specific field data. Twenty-four female 
footballers (14.9 ± 0.9 year) performed unanticipated cutting maneuvers in a 
laboratory setting and on the football pitch during football-specific exercises 
(F-EX) and games (F-GAME). Knee joint moments were collected in the laboratory 
and grouped using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The clusters were used 
to investigate the kinematics collected on field through wearable sensors. Three 
clusters emerged: Cluster 1 presented the lowest knee moments; Cluster 2 
presented high knee extension but low knee abduction and rotation moments; 
Cluster 3 presented the highest knee abduction, extension, and external rotation 
moments. In F-EX, greater knee abduction angles were found in Cluster 2 and 3 
compared to Cluster 1 (p = 0.007). Cluster 2 showed the lowest knee and hip 
flexion angles (p < 0.013). Cluster 3 showed the greatest hip external rotation 
angles (p = 0.006). In F-GAME, Cluster 3 presented the greatest knee external 
rotation and lowest knee flexion angles (p = 0.003). Clinically relevant 
differences towards ACL injury identified in the laboratory reflected at-risk 
patterns only in part when cutting on the field: in the field, low-risk players 
exhibited similar kinematic patterns as the high-risk players. Therefore, in-lab 
injury risk screening may lack ecological validity.

The here presented vignette study was part of a survey on ethical judgement 
skills among advanced veterinary students at the University of Veterinary 
Medicine Hannover, Foundation. The vignette describes a fictitious dilemma in 
veterinary practice due to medication supply shortages. First, the students 
should make an ethically justified decision: who of the two patients in the 
waiting room gets the last dosage of a medication. Important factors were the 
animal patients' characteristics (age, state of health, life expectancy), the 
patient owners' wellbeing, and context-related criteria. Second, the students 
were asked for decisional changes if one of the patients was their own dog. They 
reacted in four different ways: (1) for a professional, this should not make a 
difference; (2) most likely being "egoistic" and preferring their own dog; (3) 
giving the medication to the other dog; and (4) avoiding a decision. Finally, 
the students judged a list of possible solutions to the dilemma on a 9-point 
scale. They preferred patient-related criteria to patient-owner-related criteria 
in this task. In the overall results, it became obvious that no "gold standard" 
or guidelines for situations of medication shortages exist, yet, which presents 
an important subject for future research and veterinary ethics teaching.

Sida golden mosaic virus (SiGMV) was first detected from snap bean (Phaseolus 
vulgaris L.) in Florida in 2006 and recently in Georgia in 2018. Since 2018, it 
has caused significant economic losses to snap bean growers in Georgia. This 
study, using a SiGMV isolate field-collected from prickly sida (Sida spinosa 
L.), examined the putative host range, vector-mediated transmission, and 
SiGMV-modulated effects on host-vector interactions. In addition, this study 
analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of SiGMV with other begomoviruses 
reported from Sida spp. Host range studies confirmed that SiGMV can infect 
seasonal crops and perennial weed species such as snap bean, hollyhock (Alcea 
rosea L.), marsh mallow (Althaea officinalis L.), okra (Abelmoschus esculentus 
(L.) Moench), country mallow (Sida cordifolia L.), prickly sida (S. spinosa), 
and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). The incidence of infection ranged from 70 to 
100%. SiGMV-induced symptoms and virus accumulation varied between hosts. The 
vector, Bemisia tabaci Gennadius, was able to complete its life cycle on all 
plant species, irrespective of SiGMV infection status. However, SiGMV infection 
in prickly sida and country mallow positively increased the fitness of 
whiteflies, whereas SiGMV infection in okra negatively influenced whitefly 
fitness. Whiteflies efficiently back-transmitted SiGMV from infected prickly 
sida, hollyhock, marsh mallow, and okra to snap bean, and the incidence of 
infection ranged from 27 to 80%. Complete DNA-A sequence from this study shared 
97% identity with SiGMV sequences reported from Florida and it was determined to 
be closely related with sida viruses reported from the New World. These results 
suggest that SiGMV, a New World begomovirus, has a broad host range that would 
allow its establishment in the farmscapes/landscapes of the southeastern United 
States and is an emerging threat to snap bean and possibly other crops.

BACKGROUND: The appropriate provision of sedation as a last resort for the 
relief of suffering in palliative care is dealt with variably in actual 
practice. This article is intended as an overview of practically relevant 
information found in treatment recommendations and guidelines.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, and 
Google Scholar databases, and a manual search was carried out online. 
Recommendations that were not available in either German or English, or that 
were specific to pediatric practice, were excluded. Publication quality was 
assessed with the AGREE II instrument (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & 
Evaluation II). The recommendations in the documents were qualitatively 
evaluated.
RESULTS: 29 publications (11 journal articles, 18 other) of varying quality 
according to AGREE II were included. All recommendations and guidelines were 
essentially based on expert consensus. The common indications for sedation are 
otherwise intractable delirium, dyspnea, and pain, in patients with a life 
expectancy of no more than two weeks. Existential distress is a controversial 
indication. The drug of first choice is midazolam. As the sedating effect of 
opioids is hard to predict, they should not be used as sedatives. The risks of 
sedation include respiratory and circulatory depression, as well as the loss of 
communicative ability, control, and autonomy. It is generally recommended that 
the patient's symptom burden and depth of sedation should be monitored; clinical 
and technically supported monitoring are recommended in some publications as 
well, depending on the situation.
CONCLUSION: There is a broad consensus in favor of sedation to relieve suffering 
in the last days and hours of life. Recommendations vary for patients with a 
longer life expectancy and for those with existential distress, and with respect 
to monitoring.

Studying the effects of temperature on cookies are necessary especially if the 
impact on quality attributes are to be deduced. More so, blending wheat flour, 
date flour, and pineapple juice could improve the nutrient quality required in 
modern-day cookies. This current study investigated the quality attributes of 
date and wheat flour pineapple juice blended cookies as affected by different 
baking temperatures. With pineapple juice serving as water substitute, the 
formulated date, and wheat flour blends adhered to the following ratios: 100:0, 
90:10, 80:20, and 70:30. Baking cookies involved two different temperatures (160 
°C and 180 °C) with constant time (30 min). Quality attributes determined 
proximate composition, micronutrients, physical and functional properties, and 
microbial and sensory qualities. Cookies proximate results showed moisture 
(6.89-7.40%), protein (8.73-10.22%), fat (14.37-15.99%), fiber (1.02-1.11%), ash 
(0.77-1.20%) and carbohydrate (64.85-67.71%). Various ranges appeared, from 
energy values (434.90-444.10 kcal), minerals (calcium = 33.18-62.45 mg/100 g; 
iron = 3.47-5.75 mg/100 g; potassium = 100.07-358.63 mg/100 g), vitamins 
(vitamin A =1.99-4.89 mg/100 g; vitamin C = 0.04-0.15 mg/100 g), physical 
(weight = 7.4-7.75 g; diameter = 3.50-4.01 cm; thickness = 0.99-1.20 cm; volume 
= 3.11-3.77 cm3; density = 2.06-2.41 g/cm3; spread ratio = 2.92-4.05 cm3), to 
functional (water absorption = 1.14-1.18 g/g; oil absorption capacity = 
1.31-1.33 g/g; bulk density = 0.74-0.76 g/mL) properties. The microbial loads 
seemed somewhat acceptable as overall acceptability favoured sample WDFb (90% 
wheat, 10% date flour). The acceptability of cookies baked at 160 °C over those 
baked at 180 °C suggests the need for further studies to determine the energy 
requirements, and long-term environmental implications such (baking) 
temperatures would pose.

This study investigated the influence of two different devices with lower torso 
sports training in patients with asthma. Patients with asthma (n = 300) aged 
55-60 years with FEV1/FVC ratio < 65%, who were repeatedly admitted to a 
pulmonary rehabilitation centre, participated. Patients were evaluated and 
randomized into two groups (experimental group 1; EXP-1, n = 150, who applied a 
conventional threshold loading device, and experimental group 2; EXP-2, n = 150, 
who used an innovative respiratory training device). Patients were included only 
if they met the global criteria for asthma. The experimental intervention period 
lasted 10 weeks with 3 weekly training sessions lasting 30-40 min. The maximal 
inspiratory pressure (PI, max), pulmonary function test, baseline dyspnoea index 
(BDI), oxygen saturation, and 6 min walking test (6MWT) performance were all 
measured at baseline and postintervention. Also, an assessment of the 1 min 
repeated exercise performance (leg extension and leg press) was performed. 
Moreover, St. George Respiratory Questionnaire was used to quantify the quality 
of life (SGRQ). Statistical analysis displayed significant favourable effects on 
6MWT, leg press, and FRV1, for patients using both devices (EXP-1 and EXP-2, 
respectively) with lower torso athletic training. The other variables, weight 
SPO2 and SGRO, also showed no significant change in neither EXP-1 nor EXP-2. 
Thus, the new respiratory training device (EXP-2) appeared to be as effective as 
the conventional threshold loading device (EXP-1). In conclusion, our findings 
demonstrated beneficial effects of combining respiratory training with athletic 
training in asthma patients. Additionally, the validity of a unique respiratory 
training device for asthma patients was confirmed.

INTRODUCTION: Human health and wellbeing may depend on economic growth, the 
implication being that policymakers need to choose between population health and 
the health of ecosystems. Over two decades of low economic growth, Japan's life 
expectancy grew. Here we assess the temporal changes of subjective health and 
health inequality during the long-term low economic growth period.
METHODS: Eight triennial cross-sectional nationally representative surveys in 
Japan over the period of economic stagnation from 1992 to 2013 were used 
(n = 625,262). Health is defined positively as wellbeing, and negatively as poor 
health, based on self-rated health. We used Slope and Relative Indices of 
Inequality to model inequalities in self-rated health based on household income. 
Temporal changes in health and health inequalities over time were examined 
separately for children/adolescents, working-age adults, young-old and old-old.
RESULTS: At the end of the period of economic stagnation (2013), compared to the 
beginning (1992), the overall prevalence of wellbeing declined slightly in all 
age groups. However, poor health was stable or declined in the young-old and 
old-old, respectively, and increased only in working-age adults (Prevalence 
ratio: 1.14, 95% CI 1.08, 1.20, <0.001). Over time, inequality in wellbeing and 
poor self-rated health were observed in adults but less consistently for 
children, but the inequalities did not widen in any age group between the start 
and end of the stagnation period.
CONCLUSIONS: Although this study was a case study of one country, Japan, and 
inference to other countries cannot be made with certainty, the findings provide 
evidence that low economic growth over two decades did not inevitably translate 
to unfavourable population health. Japanese health inequalities according to 
income were stable during the study period. Therefore, this study highlighted 
the possibility that for high-income countries, low economic growth may be 
compatible with good population health.
