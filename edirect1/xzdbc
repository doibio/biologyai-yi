BACKGROUND: Obesity represents an urgent problem that needs to be properly 
addressed, especially among children. Public and global health policy- and 
decision-makers need timely, reliable quantitative information to develop 
effective interventions aimed at counteracting the burden generated by high body 
mass index (BMI). Few studies have assessed the high-BMI-related burden on a 
global scale.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Following the methodology framework and analytical 
strategies used in the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2017, the global 
deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to high BMI were 
analyzed by age, sex, year, and geographical location and by Socio-demographic 
Index (SDI). All causes of death and DALYs estimated in GBD 2017 were organized 
into 4 hierarchical levels: level 1 contained 3 broad cause groupings, level 2 
included more specific categories within the level 1 groupings, level 3 
comprised more detailed causes within the level 2 categories, and level 4 
included sub-causes of some level 3 causes. From 1990 to 2017, the global deaths 
and DALYs attributable to high BMI have more than doubled for both females and 
males. However, during the study period, the age-standardized rate of 
high-BMI-related deaths remained stable for females and only increased by 14.5% 
for males, and the age-standardized rate of high-BMI-related DALYs only 
increased by 12.7% for females and 26.8% for males. In 2017, the 6 leading GBD 
level 3 causes of high-BMI-related DALYs were ischemic heart disease, stroke, 
diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, hypertensive heart disease, and low 
back pain. For most GBD level 3 causes of high-BMI-related DALYs, high-income 
North America had the highest attributable proportions of age-standardized DALYs 
due to high BMI among the 21 GBD regions in both sexes, whereas the lowest 
attributable proportions were observed in high-income Asia Pacific for females 
and in eastern sub-Saharan Africa for males. The association between SDI and 
high-BMI-related DALYs suggested that the lowest age-standardized DALY rates 
were found in countries in the low-SDI quintile and high-SDI quintile in 2017, 
and from 1990 to 2017, the age-standardized DALY rates tended to increase in 
regions with the lowest SDI, but declined in regions with the highest SDI, with 
the exception of high-income North America. The study's main limitations 
included the use of information collected from some self-reported data, the 
employment of cutoff values that may not be adequate for all populations and 
groups at risk, and the use of a metric that cannot distinguish between lean and 
fat mass.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that the number of global deaths and 
DALYs attributable to high BMI has substantially increased between 1990 and 
2017. Successful population-wide initiatives targeting high BMI may mitigate the 
burden of a wide range of diseases. Given the large variations in 
high-BMI-related burden of disease by SDI, future strategies to prevent and 
reduce the burden should be developed and implemented based on country-specific 
development status.

Renal cell carcinoma is the 2nd most frequent urological malignancy in women and 
the third most frequent in men, with an age peak in the seventh decade of life. 
If detected early in a local non-metastatic stage, options for complete recovery 
are excellent. While two decades ago, even locally limited cancers of the kidney 
were cured by radical nephrectomy, treatment today mostly consists of local 
treatment for locally confined cancers. Guidelines today recommend local 
surgical excision (open or minimally-invasive) or - in selected cases - topical 
energy application (radio-frequency ablation, cryoablation). The surgeon's 
expertise is most important in the selection of the appropriate kind of surgery 
and different guidelines have slightly different recommendations.Treatment 
decisions should be made on an individual basis in due consideration of an 
individual's age and co-morbidities. This may lead to the recommendation that, 
due to low perioperative morbidity, even localised carcinomas should be treated 
by (minimally-invasive) radical nephrectomy instead of nephron-sparing surgery 
and, in other cases, a non-interventional, active surveillance strategy may be 
pursued without compromising the patient's life expectancy. For higher-grade 
renal cell carcinomas, there is usually an indication for radical nephrectomy, 
as long as no metastases are detected. This also applies to carcinomas with 
venous thrombi extending into the atrium of the heart. Complications in the 
treatment of renal carcinomas are usually rare and easily treatable in most 
cases.

Publisher: Das Nierenzellkarzinom ist der zweithäufigste bzw. dritthäufigste 
urologische maligne Tumor der Frau bzw. des Mannes mit einem Erkrankungsgipfel 
in der 7. Lebensdekade. Früh erkannt ist es gut heilbar, sofern der Tumor nicht 
metastasiert ist. Im Gegensatz zu früher ist bei lokal begrenzten 
Nierenzellkarzinomen die lokale Therapie (Teil-Entfernung/topische 
Energieapplikation wie Radio-Frequenz-Ablation oder Kryoablation) die 
leitliniengerechte operative Therapie, wobei je nach Expertise des Operateurs 
die minimalinvasive (laparoskopisch/roboterassistiert) oder offene Operation 
ihre Berechtigung haben. Die verschiedenen Leitlinien setzen hier 
unterschiedliche Akzente. Bei der individuellen Therapieentscheidung müssen aber 
insbesondere Alter und Komorbiditäten in die Überlegung einbezogen werden. Dies 
kann dazu führen, dass auch bei lokal begrenzten Tumoren aufgrund der geringen 
perioperativen Morbidität eine (minimalinvasive) radikale Nephrektomie an Stelle 
einer Teil-Nephrektomie zu empfehlen ist oder aber eine aktive 
Überwachungsstrategie die richtige Behandlungsoption darstellt, ohne die 
Lebenserwartung des Karzinomträgers zu kompromittieren. Höhergradige Tumoren 
hingegen sollen – vorausgesetzt es sind keine Metastasen 
nachweisbar – Indikation zur Nephrektomie sein, auch wenn z. B. Tumorthromben 
bis in den Vorhof reichen. Mögliche Komplikationen eines operativen Eingriffs 
sind in aller Regel selten und gut beherrschbar.

OBJECTIVES: Geriatric palliative care approaches support deprescribing of 
antihypertensives in older nursing home (NH) residents with limited life 
expectancy and/or advanced dementia (LLE/AD) who are intensely treated for 
hypertension (HTN), but information on real-world deprescribing patterns in this 
population is limited. We examined the incidence and factors associated with 
antihypertensive deprescribing.
DESIGN: National, retrospective cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Older Veterans with LLE/AD and HTN admitted to VA NHs 
in fiscal years 2009-2015 with potential overtreatment of HTN at admission, 
defined as receiving at least 1 antihypertensive class of medications and mean 
daily systolic blood pressure (SBP) <120 mm Hg.
MEASURES: Deprescribing was defined as subsequent dose reduction or 
discontinuation of an antihypertensive for ≥7 days. Competing risk models 
assessed cumulative incidence and factors associated with deprescribing.
RESULTS: Within our sample (n = 10,574), cumulative incidence of deprescribing 
at 30 days was 41%. Veterans with the greatest level of overtreatment (ie, 
multiple antihypertensives and SBP <100 mm Hg) had an increased likelihood 
(hazard ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.59, 1.93) of deprescribing vs 
those with the lowest level of overtreatment (ie, one antihypertensive and SBP 
≥100 to <120 mm Hg). Several markers of poor prognosis (ie, recent weight loss, 
poor appetite, dehydration, dependence for activities of daily living, pain) and 
later admission year were associated with increased likelihood of deprescribing, 
whereas cardiovascular risk factors (ie, diabetes, congestive heart failure, 
obesity), shortness of breath, and admission source from another NH or 
home/assisted living setting (vs acute hospital) were associated with decreased 
likelihood.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Real-world deprescribing patterns of 
antihypertensives among NH residents with HTN and LLE/AD appear to reflect 
variation in recommendations for HTN treatment intensity and individualization 
of patient care in a population with potential overtreatment. Factors 
facilitating deprescribing included treatment intensity and markers of poor 
prognosis. Comparative effectiveness and safety studies are needed to guide 
clinical decisions around deprescribing and HTN management.

Aging, which is accompanied by decreased organ function and increased disease 
incidence, limits human lifespan and has attracted investigators for thousands 
of years. In recent decades, with the rapid development of biology, scientists 
have shown that epigenetic modifications, especially DNA methylation, are key 
regulators involved in this process. Regular fluctuations in global DNA 
methylation levels have been shown to accurately estimate biological age and 
disease prognosis. In this review, we discuss recent findings regarding the 
relationship between variations in DNA methylation level patterns and aging. In 
addition, we introduce the known mechanisms by which DNA methylation regulators 
affect aging and related diseases. As more studies uncover the mechanisms by 
which DNA methylation regulates aging, antiaging interventions and treatments 
for related diseases may be developed that enable human life extension.

This research focused on the development of carrageenan based biodegradable 
films incorporated with olive leaves extract (OLE). OLE microbial inhibition and 
its total phenolics (TP) were evaluated. Carrageenan films were produced by 
casting technique and were characterized by thickness, water vapor permeability 
(WVP), color, mechanical properties, and infrared spectroscopy. In order to 
apply as lamb meat packaging, the antimicrobial effect of the films was 
investigated. Results showed that OLE inhibited E. coli growth and presented 
excellent TP (41.40 mgGAE/g). Thicknesses of the film with OLE (CAR-OLE) were 
approximately 28% higher than film without OLE. Addition of OLE reduced the WVP 
by approximately 54%. CAR-OLE was less resistant to breakage and more flexible 
showing darker color. FTIR showed interaction of carrageenan with OLE. Results 
revealed that CAR-OLE promoted 167-fold reduction in initial count of aerobic 
mesophiles indicating shelf-life extension of lamb meat and promising use as 
antimicrobial food packaging.

Wampee fruit is a popular fruit cultivar in South-East Asia due to its high 
levels of nutrients and antioxidants; however, pericarp browning leads to a 
short storage life with great economic loss during years. The purpose of this 
work was to determine whether postharvest ethanol fumigation affected pericarp 
browning development of wampee fruit during 12 days of storage at 8 ± 0.5°C, and 
if so, how it is related to phenol metabolism and how it affects quality 
attributes and antioxidant systems during storage. After fruits were fumigated 
with 100, 300, 500, and 800 μl/L for 5 hr at 22 ± 0.5°C, ethanol significantly 
reduced the development of pericarp browning by increasing total phenolics (TP) 
content and decreasing the activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), especially in 
500 μl/L ethanol treatment. Additionally, ethanol delayed the losses in fruit 
firmness (FF), soluble solid content (SSC), and titratable acidity (TA), 
retarded weight loss and accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) content and 
maintained relatively high contents of ascorbic acid (AsA), total flavonoids 
(TF), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and activities of superoxide 
dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD). In conclusion, results 
demonstrated that postharvest ethanol fumigation in wampee fruit has ability to 
reduce pericarp browning development by regulating phenol metabolism and 
enhancing antioxidant systems.

IMPORTANCE: A stepwise approach that includes screening and lifestyle 
modification followed by the addition of metformin for individuals with high 
risk of diabetes is recommended to delay progression to diabetes; however, there 
is scant evidence regarding whether this approach is cost-effective.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a stepwise approach in the 
Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation study included 578 
adults with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or both. 
Participants were enrolled in the Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement 
Program, a randomized clinical trial with 3-year follow-up conducted at a 
diabetes care and research center in Chennai, India.
INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group underwent a 6-month lifestyle modification 
curriculum plus stepwise addition of metformin; the control group received 
standard lifestyle advice.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cost, health benefits, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated from multipayer (including 
direct medical costs) and societal (including direct medical and nonmedical 
costs) perspectives. Costs and ICERs were reported in 2019 Indian rupees (INR) 
and purchasing power parity-adjusted international dollars (INT $).
RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 578 participants was 44.4 (9.3) years, and 364 
(63.2%) were men. Mean (SD) body mass index was 27.9 (3.7), and the mean (SD) 
glycated hemoglobin level was 6.0% (0.5). Implementing lifestyle modification 
and metformin was associated with INR 10 549 (95% CI, INR 10 134-10 964) (INT 
$803 [95% CI, INT $771-834]) higher direct costs; INR 5194 (95% CI, INR 3187-INR 
7201) (INT $395; 95% CI, INT $65-147) higher direct nonmedical costs, an 
absolute diabetes risk reduction of 10.2% (95% CI, 1.9% to 18.5%), and an 
incremental gain of 0.099 (95% CI, 0.018 to 0.179) quality-adjusted life-years 
per participant. From a multipayer perspective (including screening costs), mean 
ICERs were INR 1912 (INT $145) per 1 percentage point diabetes risk reduction, 
INR 191 090 (INT $14 539) per diabetes case prevented and/or delayed, and INR 
196 960 (INT $14 986) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In the scenario of 
a 50% increase or decrease in screening and intervention costs, the mean ICERs 
varied from INR 855 (INT $65) to INR 2968 (INT $226) per 1 percentage point 
diabetes risk reduction, from INR 85 495 (INT $6505) to INR 296 681 (INT 
$22 574) per diabetes case prevented, and from INR 88 121 (INT $6705) to INR 
305 798 (INT $23 267) per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that a stepwise 
approach for diabetes prevention is likely to be cost-effective, even if 
screening costs for identifying high-risk individuals are added.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Decision-making for systemic treatments in older patients 
with cancer is difficult because of concerns for decreased organ function, risk 
of toxicity, limited life expectancy due to comorbidities and the lack of 
evidence available to guide its management in this population. Here, we review 
the data on the role of systemic agents for the treatment of common malignancies 
in this age group.
RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence on the use of systemic treatments for older patients 
with cancer is increasing, especially for newer options including immune 
checkpoint inhibitors and targeted agents that provide comparable benefit in 
older and younger patients. Nonetheless, the risks for short- and long-term 
toxicities need to be considered. More research is warranted and represents a 
unique opportunity to increase the knowledge on cancer treatment for older 
adults. Healthy, older individuals should be considered for standard systemic 
treatment options, whereas those at risk based on geriatric assessments require 
adjusted plans. Geriatric assessments are key for decision-making.

Hemophilia A (HA) and B (HB) are X-linked bleeding disorders caused by mutations 
in the F8 or F9 gene that result in the absence, or reduced activity, of the 
corresponding clotting factor. The severity of bleeding and related 
complications is proportional to the amount of residual circulating functional 
factor. The development of a safe and effective hemophilia treatment lasted 
several decades and has been mainly based on clotting factor replacement. 
Advances in the engineering and manufacturing of clotting concentrates have led 
to the widespread availability of extended half-life products that reduced the 
number of intravenous infusions needed to achieve adequate trough levels. The 
recent development of new nonfactor replacement treatments and biotechnology 
techniques has offered therapeutic alternatives for hemophilia patients with and 
without inhibitors. These are characterized by an easier route of 
administration, low immunogenicity, and, regarding gene therapy and cell-based 
treatments, potential long-term protection from bleeding after a single 
treatment course. In this review, we analyze recent progresses in the management 
of hemophilia and discuss opportunities and challenges.

Half-dried Pacific saury of Cololabis saira (HDPS) is a fatty fish of high 
nutritional value with remarkable consumer interest in the Asia Pacific region, 
however, it undergoes various deteriorative changes associated with browning, 
bacterial contamination, oxidation, and decreased sensory attributes while 
marketed in various processed forms. To withstand these complications, research 
aimed to investigate the hot smoking technology to improve physicochemical, 
microbiological, and sensory attributes of HDPS with prolonged shelf life in 
storage conditions. The HDPS fillets were processed with hot smoking (70 °C) 
using various sawdust materials of Apple, Chestnut, Oak, Cherry, and Walnut, 
wherein the smoke time was set at different time points of 0, 20, 25, and 30 
min. The results indicated that 25 min of smoking time with the selective Oak 
sawdust showed better sensorial characteristics, physicochemical properties, and 
microbiological qualities. Moreover, HDPS possessed higher nutritional value and 
valuable functional fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid and 
eicosapentaenoic acid, having a storage ability of up to 30 days at 10 °C. The 
processed HDPS offered a reduced level of Trimethylamine-N-oxide and 
Benzo[a]pyrene contents, indicating the acceptable and safe for human 
consumption. Therefore, HDPS with hot smoking could likely be a promising 
technique for preserving the premium quality of the product by providing desired 
characteristics of health and nutrition to end-point consumers.

BACKGROUND: Expanded access programs (EAPs) allow patients with serious, 
life-threatening conditions access to drugs prior to their formal approval. 
Despite the possible benefits for patients, EAPs present several challenges, 
including uncertainty regarding a drug's efficacy and safety as well as 
inequities regarding access to treatment. Although the number of EAPs is 
growing, the experience of patients participating in EAPs has not yet been 
studied. In Germany, an EAP for the treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) 
with nusinersen ran from December 2016 to May 2017). SMA is a rare, progressive 
neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle atrophy and proximal muscle 
weakness. Insights into patients' and caregivers' experiences could help to 
improve future EAPs.
RESULTS: We conducted a prospective study using semi-structured interviews with 
caregivers of children with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1who participated 
in the nusinersen EAP in Germany. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and 
analyzed using an inductive approach according to the principles of content 
analysis. Eight families participated in the study. Their children were between 
2 and 28 months old. Six children received non-invasive ventilation. 
Participation in the EAP marked an important turning point in the caregivers' 
experiences. Their perspective changed from a severely limited life expectancy 
and a palliative approach to a more optimistic view including hopes for a longer 
life and positive development of their children. However, participating in the 
EAP was also challenging for caregivers in several ways. Lack of information 
regarding the launch of the program and the enrollment procedures caused 
significant uncertainty and stress among caregivers prior to the actual 
treatment. Further, concerns persisted that nusinersen could not be approved or 
that the child could be excluded due to an insufficient treatment response. Good 
communication and trusting relationships with medical and non-medical staff at 
the hospital helped caregivers cope with the uncertainties associated with the 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: From the caregivers' perspective, there was no alternative to 
participating in the EAP for nusinersen. All participants were positive 
regarding their decision to participate. However, this study suggests that 
developing procedures to increase speed and transparency and to ensure fairness 
could help to further improve the system of EAPs as a way to provide urgently 
needed care to highly vulnerable patients.

BACKGROUND: Markov models are a key tool for calculating expected time spent in 
a state, such as active life expectancy and disabled life expectancy. In 
reality, individuals often enter and exit states recurrently, but standard 
analytical approaches are not able to describe this dynamic. We develop an 
analytical matrix approach to calculating the expected number and length of 
episodes spent in a state.
METHODS: The approach we propose is based on Markov chains with rewards. It 
allows us to identify the number of entries into a state and to calculate the 
average length of episodes as total time in a state divided by the number of 
entries. For sampling variance estimation, we employ the block bootstrap. Two 
case studies that are based on published literature illustrate how our methods 
can provide new insights into disability dynamics.
RESULTS: The first application uses a classic textbook example on prednisone 
treatment and liver functioning among liver cirrhosis patients. We replicate 
well-known results of no association between treatment and survival or recovery. 
Our analysis of the episodes of normal liver functioning delivers the new 
insight that the treatment reduced the likelihood of relapse and extended 
episodes of normal liver functioning. The second application assesses frailty 
and disability among elderly people. We replicate the prior finding that frail 
individuals have longer life expectancy in disability. As a novel finding, we 
document that frail individuals experience three times as many episodes of 
disability that were on average twice as long as the episodes of nonfrail 
individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide a simple analytical approach for calculating the number 
and length of episodes in Markov chain models. The results allow a description 
of the transition dynamics that goes beyond the results that can be obtained 
using standard tools for Markov chains. Empirical applications using published 
data illustrate how the new method is helpful in unraveling the dynamics of the 
modeled process.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify US female and male Olympic athletes' longevity and the 
years of life lost or saved due to multiple causes of death as compared with the 
US general population.
METHODS: Former US athletes who had participated in the summer or winter Olympic 
Games at least once between 1912 and 2012 were included. Olympians' date of 
birth, death and the underlying causes of death were certified by the National 
Death Index. The Olympians' overall and cause-specific mortality were compared 
with the US general population based on the US life tables, adjusted by sex, 
period and age. Mortality differences between the populations were quantified 
using the years lost/years saved (YS) method.
RESULTS: 8124 US Olympians (2301 women and 5823 men) lived 5.1 years longer (YS 
95% CI 4.3 to 6.0) than the general population, based on 2309 deaths observed 
(225 women, 2084 men). Different causes of death contributed to longevity for 
Olympians as follows: 2.2 years were saved (1.9 to 2.5) from cardiovascular 
diseases (CVDs); cancer, 1.5 years (1.3 to 1.8); respiratory diseases (eg, 
influenza, pneumonia), 0.8 years (0.7 to 0.9); external causes (eg, accidents, 
homicides), 0.5 years (0.4 to 0.6); endocrine and metabolic diseases (eg, 
diabetes, hyperlipidaemia), 0.4 years (0.2 to 0.5) and digestive system diseases 
(eg, cirrhosis, hepatic failure), 0.3 years (0.2 to 0.4). Mortality rates due to 
nervous system disorders (eg, Alzheimer's and Parkinsons's diseases) and mental 
illness (eg, dementia, schizophrenia) were not different from the general 
population.
CONCLUSION: US Olympians lived longer than the general population, an advantage 
mainly conferred by lower risks of CVD and cancer. Nervous system disorders and 
mental illness did not differ between US Olympians and the general population.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate of second primary lung cancer (SPLC) and 
describe the clinical characteristics and radiological findings in individuals 
with a prior history of cancer presenting to a low-dose computed tomography 
(LDCT) lung cancer screening program at a tertiary cancer center.
METHODS: Patients with a previous history of malignancy, a life expectancy 
≥ 5 years referred for CT lung cancer screening between May 2, 2011, and 
November 28, 2018, were included. Demographics regarding risk factors including 
smoking history and prior history of thoracic radiation were collected. CT scan 
features assessed nodule size, morphologic features, and number. The Lung-CT 
Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) scoring system was retrospectively applied 
to studies performed before October 2014 and prospectively applied to remainder 
of studies. Data was collected in a Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant manner.
RESULTS: A total of 543 patients were studied (mean age of 66 years). All had a 
previous history of cancer, most commonly breast cancer 205 (38%), head and neck 
cancer 105 (19%), and lung cancer 87 (16%). Of screening CTs performed, 17.5% 
were positive screening study results as per Lung-RADS scoring system. SPLC was 
diagnosed in 35 patients (6.4%) with 21 prevalence cancers detected and 14 
interval cancers detected in subsequent screening rounds.
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of screen-detected SPLC in patients with prior malignancy 
is higher than reported rates seen in historical prospective screening studies. 
Our study suggests the need for prospective research to evaluate any mortality 
benefit that screening may have in this population.
KEY POINTS: • The rate of screen-detected second primary lung cancer in patients 
with prior malignancy is higher than reported rates seen in historical 
prospective randomized lung cancer screening studies in a general screened 
population. • Patients with a prior malignancy undergoing lung cancer screening 
have higher rates of positive screening studies and higher rates of invasive 
diagnostic procedures than those reported in a general screening population. • 
Prospective research is required to evaluate if screening offers a mortality 
benefit in this population.

BACKGROUND: Utilization of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected donors represents an 
opportunity to expand the liver transplantation (LT) donor pool. However, 
benefits of accepting HBV-positive donors for HBV-negative candidates, 
potentially expanding the donor pool resulting in earlier transplantation, must 
be balanced with costs of lifelong antiviral therapy. The aim of this study was 
to evaluate cost-effectiveness of this strategy.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model with two strategies, transplant with (1) a 
HBV-positive donor versus and (2) a HBV-negative donor for a HBV-negative LT 
candidate. A healthcare system perspective was utilized, effectiveness measured 
in quality-adjusted life-years, and costs in 2018 USD.
RESULTS: In the base-case, the HBV-positive donor strategy is more effective 
(gain of 0.46 QALYs), but $26,159 more expensive, yielding an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $57,389/QALY. However, increasing the 
candidate's Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score resulted in increasing 
cost-effectiveness, ICER of $69,507/QALY (MELD 6-10) to $47,385/QALY (MELD 
> 30). Results were most sensitive to antiviral cost and cost after first year 
of LT. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the HBV-positive strategy was 
always more effective but more expensive, with average ICER of $64,883/QALY. 
This strategy was highly cost-effective (ICER < $50,000/QALY) 21% of the time 
and cost < $100/000/QALY 94% of the time.
CONCLUSIONS: Consideration of these donors must be individualized to each 
candidate's severity of liver disease, associated costs, and personal 
preferences that impact quality of life. Expansion of the donor pool to include 
HBV-positive donors for appropriate recipients may be a cost-effective policy 
and may provide significant benefit for individual patients.

Dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft versus standard of care alone in 
treatment of Wagner 1 diabetic foot ulcers: a trial-based health economics 
study.

Carter MJ(1).

AIMS: The aim of this health economics study was to estimate the cost-utility of 
an aseptically processed, dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft (dHACA) 
plus standard of care (SOC) (group 1) versus SOC alone (group 2) based on a 
published randomized controlled trial in which patients who had an eligible 
Wagner 1 diabetic foot ulcer wound were randomized to either of these 
treatments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov microsimulation was used to project trial 
results out to a 1-year horizon time with a third-party payer perspective. The 
starting health state was an unhealed non-infected ulcer with other health 
states of healed ulcer, infected non-healed ulcer, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, 
and absorbing states of dead or amputation. All patients started with unhealed 
non-infected ulcers at cycle 0. Costs were incurred by patients for procedures 
at hospital outpatient wound care provider-based departments (PBDs) and 
hospitals (if complications occurred) and were calculated using time-based 
activity costing methods. Effectiveness units were quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) computed from literature utility values. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA) were also conducted.
RESULTS: After 1 year, the calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) for group 1 versus group 2 was -$4,373 with group 1 (dHACA) being 
dominant over group 2 (SOC). PSA demonstrated that group 1 had 69.2% lower cost 
values with increased positive incremental effectiveness for 94.9% of values. A 
willingness to pay (WTP) curve showed that about 92% of interventions were cost 
effective for group 1 when $50,000 was paid.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated that dHACA added to SOC 
compared to SOC alone was extremely cost-effective in the defined trial 
population.

AIMS: This study aimed to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of infliximab 
and its biosimilar compared to conventional therapy in refractory 
moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (CD) in Thailand.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate lifetime costs and 
health benefits of infliximab from a societal perspective. Our analyses 
consisted of three choices of treatment (conventional therapy, infliximab 
originator, and biosimilar) and three treatment scenarios (infliximab 2 years 
and 3 years if relapse, infliximab 2 years and lifelong if relapse, and 
infliximab lifelong). The input parameters were obtained from the CD registry 
and systematic literature reviews. The results were reported as incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2017 USD per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained. The sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence 
of parameter uncertainty. Threshold sensitivity analyses were carried out to 
determine the optimal drug prices. Finally, budget impact analyses were 
conducted.
RESULTS: None of the scenarios was cost-effective at Thai willingness-to-pay 
threshold (4,706 USD/QALY gained). The lowest ICER of 30,121 USD/QALY gained was 
reported in the scenario that included only standard dose of infliximab 
biosimilar with the maximum of 5-year treatment. The drug prices need to be 
reduced by at least 72% to allow infliximab biosimilar to be cost-effective. The 
5-year budget impact was only 695,958 USD for the current biosimilar price.
CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab for the treatment of refractory moderate-to-severe CD in 
Thailand would be cost-effective if the drug prices were significantly 
decreased. The best value for money strategy was infliximab biosimilar with a 
restricted duration of treatment. Key points The use of infliximab and its 
biosimilar in a restricted duration of maximum 5-year is not cost-effective for 
patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease refractory to conventional 
therapy, unless their price was lowered around 72-90% in Thailand. The estimated 
budget impact for adopting infliximab or its biosimilar for such indication has 
potential financial feasibility. Policy makers may consider cost-effectiveness 
and budget impact findings as well as other aspects such as rarity of disease as 
a part of the decision making process.
