PURPOSE: Accurate life expectancy estimates are required to inform prostate 
cancer treatment decisions. However, few models are specific to the population 
served or easily implemented in a clinical setting. We sought to create life 
expectancy estimates specific to Veterans diagnosed with prostate cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using national Veterans Health Administration electronic 
health records, we identified Veterans diagnosed with prostate cancer between 
2000 and 2015. We abstracted demographics, comorbidities, oncologic staging, and 
treatment information. We fit Cox Proportional Hazards models to determine the 
impact of age, comorbidity, cancer risk, and race on survival. We stratified 
life expectancy estimates by age, comorbidity and cancer stage.
RESULTS: Our analytic cohort included 145,678 patients. Survival modeling 
demonstrated the importance of age and comorbidity across all cancer risk 
categories. Life expectancy estimates generated from age and comorbidity data 
were predictive of overall survival (C-index 0.676, 95% CI 0.674-0.679) and 
visualized using Kaplan-Meier plots and heatmaps stratified by age and 
comorbidity. Separate life expectancy estimates were generated for patients with 
localized or advanced disease. These life expectancy estimates calibrate well 
across prostate cancer risk categories.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy estimates are essential to providing 
patient-centered prostate cancer care. We developed accessible life expectancy 
estimation tools for Veterans diagnosed with prostate cancer that can be used in 
routine clinical practice to inform medical-decision making.

Population health, economics and ethics in the age of COVID-19.

Are the steps that have been taken to arrest the spread of COVID-19 justifiable? 
Specifically, are they likely to have improved public health understood 
according to widely used aggregate population health measures, such as Quality 
Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) as much 
or more than alternatives? This is a reasonable question, since such measures 
have been promoted extensively in global and national health policy by 
influential actors, and they have become almost synonymous with quantification 
of public health. If the steps taken against COVID-19 did not meet this test, 
then either the measures or the policies must be re-evaluated. There are 
indications that policies against COVID-19 may have been unbalanced and 
therefore not optimal. A balanced approach to protecting population health 
should be proportionate in its effects across distinct health concerns at a 
moment, across populations over time and across populations over space. These 
criteria provide a guide to designing and implementing policies that diminish 
harm from COVID-19 while also providing due attention to other threats to 
aggregate population health. They should shape future policies in response to 
this pandemic and others.

OBJECTIVE: To perform an individual participant data meta-analysis using 
randomized trials and propensity-score matched (PSM) studies which compared 
laparoscopic versus open hepatectomy for patients with colorectal liver 
metastases (CLM).
BACKGROUND: Randomized trials and PSM studies constitute the highest level of 
evidence in addressing the long-term oncologic efficacy of laparoscopic versus 
open resection for CLM. However, individual studies are limited by the reporting 
of overall survival in ways not amenable to traditional methods of 
meta-analysis, and violation of the proportional hazards assumption.
METHODS: Survival information of individual patients was reconstructed from the 
published Kaplan-Meier curves with the aid of a computer vision program. 
Frequentist and Bayesian survival models (taking into account random-effects and 
nonproportional hazards) were fitted to compare overall survival of patients who 
underwent laparoscopic versus open surgery. To handle long plateaus in the tails 
of survival curves, we also exploited "cure models" to estimate the fraction of 
patients effectively "cured" of disease.
RESULTS: Individual patient data from 2 randomized trials and 13 PSM studies 
involving 3148 participants were reconstructed. Laparoscopic resection was 
associated with a lower hazard rate of death (stratified hazard ratio = 0.853, 
95% confidence interval: 0.754-0.965, P = 0.0114), and there was evidence of 
time-varying effects (P = 0.0324) in which the magnitude of hazard ratios 
increased over time. The fractions of long-term cancer survivors were estimated 
to be 47.4% and 18.0% in the laparoscopy and open surgery groups, respectively. 
At 10-year follow-up, the restricted mean survival time was 8.6 months (or 
12.1%) longer in the laparoscopy arm (P < 0.0001). In a subgroup analysis, 
elderly patients (≥65 years old) treated with laparoscopy experienced longer 
3-year average life expectancy (+6.2%, P = 0.018), and those who live past the 
5-year milestone (46.1%) seem to be cured of disease.
CONCLUSIONS: This patient-level meta-analysis of high-quality studies 
demonstrated an unexpected survival benefit in favor of laparoscopic over open 
resection for CLM in the long-term. From a conservative viewpoint, these results 
can be interpreted to indicate that laparoscopy is at least not inferior to the 
standard open approach.

Angeles, CA.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of open, laparoscopic, and robotic 
colectomy.
BACKGROUND: The use of robotic-assisted colon surgery is increasing. Robotic 
technology is more expensive and whether a robotically assisted approach is 
cost-effective remains to be determined.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed to evaluate the 1-year costs 
and quality-adjusted time between robotic, laparoscopic, and open colectomy. 
Model inputs were derived from available literature for costs, quality of life 
(QOL), and outcomes. Results are presented as incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs), defined as incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to 
test the effect of clinically reasonable variations in the inputs on our 
results.
RESULTS: Open colectomy cost more and achieved lower QOL than robotic and 
laparoscopic approaches. From the societal perspective, robotic colectomy costs 
$745 more per case than laparoscopy, resulting in an ICER of $2,322,715/QALY 
because of minimal differences in QOL. From the healthcare sector perspective, 
robotics cost $1339 more per case with an ICER of $4,174,849/QALY. In both 
models, laparoscopic colectomy was more frequently cost-effective across a wide 
range of willingness-to-pay thresholds. Sensitivity analyses suggest robotic 
colectomy becomes cost-effective at $100,000/QALY if robotic disposable 
instrument costs decrease below $1341 per case, robotic operating room time 
falls below 172 minutes, or robotic hernia rate is less than 5%.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic and robotic colectomy are more cost-effective than 
open resection. Robotics can surpass laparoscopy in cost-effectiveness by 
achieving certain thresholds in QOL, instrument costs, and postoperative 
outcomes. With increased use of robotic technology in colorectal surgery, there 
is a burden to demonstrate these benefits.

BACKGROUND: Recent advances in medicine have caused positive impact on the life 
expectancy of most countries, resulting in increased older adult population. 
Aging comes with a number of health challenges. This study investigated health 
conditions of older adults at admission and clinical outcomes in a regional 
referral hospital in southwestern Uganda.
METHODS: A retrospective study reviewed clinical data of older adult patients 
admitted between January 2016 and December 2017. Demographic data, cause of 
admission, length, and outcomes of hospitalization are described.
RESULTS: Up to 813 patient files were reviewed. The patients had been 
hospitalized to emergency, 371 (45.6%); medical, 355 (43.7%); surgical, 84 
(10.3%); psychiatry, 2 (0.3%); and obstetrics and gynecology, 1 (0.1%) wards. 
The majority, 427 (52.5%), of the patients were females. Cancer was the most 
common reason for hospitalization, 130/889 (14.6%), followed by stroke, 94/889 
(10.6%); heart failure, 76/889 (8.6%); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
56/889 (6.3%); pneumonia, 47/889 (5.3%); and head injury, 45/889 (5.1%), whilst 
560 (68.9%) of the hospitalized patients were discharged, 197 (24.2%) died, 18 
(2.2%) were referred for advanced care, and 38 (4.7%) escaped from the facility. 
The emergency ward had the highest deaths, 101 (51.3%), then medical, 56 
(28.4%), and surgical, 39 (19.8%), wards. Mortality of those who died was 
admitted with stroke, 30 (15.2%), cancer, 21 (10.7%), head injury, 16 (8.1%), 
heart failure, 14 (7.1%), sepsis, 14 (7.1%), and renal disease, 12 (6.1%). On 
average, patients were admitted for 5 days (IQR: 3-8).
CONCLUSIONS: The high proportion of mortality in this group is worrying and 
requires further investigations.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening disease. 
Target-specific anticoagulant rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor that 
can be safely used without laboratory monitoring.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban versus warfarin 
for the treatment of acute pulmonary thromboembolism in real-world clinical 
practice.
METHOD: This was a semiretrospective, semiprospective, and real-world trial 
involving 128 patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism with or without 
active tumor or frailty. We compared rivaroxaban to the standard therapy 
consisting of low-molecular-weight heparin combined with warfarin. The primary 
efficacy outcome was absorption of thrombus. The principal safety outcome was 
bleeding episode.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in thrombus absorption between 
rivaroxaban and standard therapy after 3-month treatment (P = 0.798, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.686 to 1.336) or more than 6-month treatment (P = 
0.534, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.795 to 1.556). There was no decline in 
efficacy (including computed tomographic pulmonary angiography and recurrence) 
when the rivaroxaban dose was reduced to 10 mg once daily after 3 months of 
administration. The ratio of patients without bleeding was 48.84% for 
rivaroxaban and 19.05% for standard therapy (P = 0.001). There was no 
significant difference in rivaroxaban monotherapy subgroups (including frail 
patients, tumor patients, and thrombolysis or nonthrombolysis at 
intermediate-high-risk patients).
CONCLUSION: In this real-world study, the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban 
alone was not different to standard therapy for pulmonary emboli absorption. 
With an extension in treatment duration, the rivaroxaban regimen had a higher 
efficacy and safety than standard therapy and there was no decline in treatment 
efficacy when the rivaroxaban dose was reduced to 10 mg once daily.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of hypertension has been increasing in the past 
decade. Little is known regarding the relationship between hypertension and 
human development index (HDI).
OBJECTIVES: The objective is to identify the relationship between the prevalence 
of hypertension and human development index (HDI).
METHODS: An ecological study was conducted. The data from World Health 
Organization reports and United Nations Development Programme reports for 182 
countries, including the HDI values, rates of tobacco use, physical inactivity, 
alcohol use, and salt intake. The Generalized Additive Models were implemented 
to assess the association between the prevalence of hypertension and the HDI.
RESULTS: Among 182 countries, the prevalence of hypertension ranged from 13% to 
41%. The highest HDI value was 0.949 and the lowest was 0.352. In model 1, 
statistically significant associations were found in three populations, the 
largest R2 was 0.245. In model 2, the largest R2 was 0.485. In linear part, 
there was negative relationship in female population, while HDI was associated 
with prevalence of hypertension in all three populations, which was explained by 
spline function. The curve indicated that there were three intervals from low to 
high HDI. From 0 to 0.6 and 0.8 to 1, an evident decreasing trend of prevalence 
was found, while the rate increased when HDI was in the interval of 0.6 to 0.8.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified the association between the prevalence 
of hypertension and the HDI and the underlying pattern of the relationship. The 
findings will aid the planning of hypertension control priorities and provide 
suggestions for interventions.

Parasitoid lifespan is influenced by nutrient availability, thus the lifespan of 
parasitoids that rely on their hosts for nutritional resources (either via host 
feeding or by consuming honeydew) should vary with host density. We assessed the 
survival and reproduction of one such species, Aphelinus certus-a parasitoid of 
the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines-over a range of host densities using a 
laboratory assay. We found a positive, asymptotic relationship between host 
density and the lifespan and fecundity of A. certus that was supported by a 
traditional survivorship analysis as well as a logistic model. Parasitoids from 
this assay were also used to develop a wing wear index relating setae damage to 
parasitoid age. This index was used to estimate the life expectancy of 
field-collected parasitoids, which was shorter than the life expectancy of 
laboratory-reared female parasitoids. Finally, host-density-dependent parasitoid 
lifespan was incorporated into a coupled-equations matrix population model that 
revealed that decreasing the degree of host density dependence leads to higher 
equilibrium host densities and changes in the quality of equilibrium (e.g. 
stable limit cycles). These results detail the relatively unstudied phenomenon 
of host-density-dependent parasitoid lifespan and suggest that differences 
between laboratory- and field-determined parasitoid life expectancy have 
important implications for population dynamics and the biological control of 
insects.

Do the Benefits of COVID-19 Policies Exceed the Costs? Exploring Uncertainties 
in the Age-VSL Relationship.

Numerous analyses of the benefits and costs of COVID-19 policies have been 
completed quickly as the crisis has unfolded. The results often largely depend 
on the approach used to value mortality risk reductions, typically expressed as 
the value per statistical life (VSL). Many analyses rely on a population-average 
VSL estimate; some adjust VSL for life expectancy at the age of death. We 
explore the implications of theory and empirical studies, which suggest that the 
relationship between age and VSL is uncertain. We compare the effects of three 
approaches: (1) an invariant population-average VSL; (2) a constant value per 
statistical life-year (VSLY); and (3) a VSL that follows an inverse-U pattern, 
peaking in middle age. We find that when applied to the U.S. age distribution of 
COVID-19 deaths, these approaches result in average VSL estimates of $10.63 
million, $4.47 million, and $8.31 million. We explore the extent to which 
applying these estimates alters the conclusions of frequently cited analyses of 
social distancing, finding that they significantly affect the findings. However, 
these analyses do not address other characteristics of COVID-19 deaths that may 
increase or decrease the VSL estimates. Examples include the health status and 
income level of those affected, the size of the risk change, and the extent to 
which the risk is dreaded, uncertain, involuntarily incurred, and outside of 
one's control. The effects of these characteristics and their correlation with 
age are uncertain; it is unclear whether they amplify or diminish the effects of 
age on VSL.

Sequences of toddler negative emotion and parent-toddler verbal communication 
during a waking day.

Fields-Olivieri MA(1), Cole PM(1).

Although the second year of life is characterized by dramatic changes in 
expressive language and by increases in negative emotion expression, verbal 
communication and emotional communication are often studied separately. With a 
sample of twenty-five one-year-olds (12-23 months), we used Language Environment 
Analysis (LENA; Xu, Yapanel, & Gray, 2009, Reliability of the LENA™ language 
environment analysis system in young children's natural home environment. LENA 
Foundation) to audio-record and quantify parent-toddler communication, including 
toddlers' vocal negative emotion expressions, across a full waking day. Using a 
multilevel extension of lag-sequential analysis, we investigated whether parents 
are differentially responsive to toddlers' negative emotion expressions compared 
to their verbal or preverbal vocalizations, and we examined the effects of 
parents' verbal responses on toddlers' subsequent communicative behavior. 
Toddlers' negative emotions were less likely than their vocalizations to be 
followed by parent speech. However, when negative emotions were followed by 
parent speech, toddlers were most likely to vocalize next. Post hoc analyses 
suggest that older toddlers and toddlers with higher language abilities were 
more likely to shift from negative emotion to verbal or preverbal vocalization 
following parent response. Implications of the results for understanding the 
parent-toddler communication processes that support both emotional development 
and verbal development are discussed.

BACKGROUND: The Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is internationally recognized 
as standard metric of health outcomes in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) in 
healthcare. The ongoing debate concerning the appropriateness of its use for 
decision-making in palliative care has been recently mapped in a review. The aim 
was to report on and draw conclusions from two expert meetings that reflected on 
earlier mapped issues in order to reach consensus, and to advise on the QALY's 
future use in palliative care.
METHODS: A nominal group approach was used. In order to facilitate group 
decision making, three statements regarding the use of the QALY in palliative 
care were discussed in a structured way. Two groups of international 
policymakers, healthcare professionals and researchers participated. Data were 
analysed qualitatively using inductive coding.
RESULTS: 1) Most experts agreed that the recommended measurement tool for the 
QALYs 'Q' component, the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), is inappropriate for palliative 
care. A more sensitive tool, which might be based on the capabilities approach, 
could be used or developed. 2) Valuation of time should be incorporated in the 
'Q' part, leaving the linear clock time in the 'LY' component. 3) Most experts 
agreed that the QALY, in its current shape, is not suitable for palliative care.
CONCLUSIONS: 1) Although the EQ-5D does not suffice, a generic tool is needed 
for the QALY. As long as no suitable alternative is available, other tools can 
be used besides or serve as basis for the EQ-5D because of issues in conceptual 
overlap. 2) Future research should further investigate the valuation of time 
issue, and how best to integrate it in the 'Q' component. 3) A generic outcome 
measure of effectiveness is essential to justly allocate healthcare resources. 
However, experts emphasized, the QALY is and should be one of multiple criteria 
for choices in the healthcare insurance package.

Dromedaries have been essential for the prosperity of civilizations in arid 
environments and the dispersal of humans, goods and cultures along ancient, 
cross-continental trading routes. With increasing desertification their 
importance as livestock species is rising rapidly, but little is known about 
their genome-wide diversity and demographic history. As previous studies using 
few nuclear markers found weak phylogeographic structure, here we detected 
fine-scale population differentiation in dromedaries across Asia and Africa by 
adopting a genome-wide approach. Global patterns of effective migration rates 
revealed pathways of dispersal after domestication, following historic caravan 
routes like the Silk and Incense Roads. Our results show that a Pleistocene 
bottleneck and Medieval expansions during the rise of the Ottoman empire have 
shaped genome-wide diversity in modern dromedaries. By understanding subtle 
population structure we recognize the value of small, locally adapted 
populations and appeal for securing genomic diversity for a sustainable 
utilization of this key desert species.

Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease: Challenges With Transition to Adult 
Health Care.

Varty M(1), Popejoy LL(1).

(1)University of Missouri-Columbia.

Because life expectancy has increased greatly in the past few decades for 
individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD), transition to the adult 
healthcare setting has become a necessity to continue disease management. 
Transition for young adults with SCD is associated with declining health 
outcomes, including increased acute care use and mortality. Nurses can assist 
young adults with SCD who are at risk after transition by assessing the young 
adult's ability to carry out disease self-management, facilitating the 
supportive role of the family, and recognizing young adults who may have 
difficulty accessing healthcare resources and providers.

Patients with severe mental illness (SMI) have a higher burden of premature 
cardio-metabolic abnormalities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, and obesity resulting into a 3-fold increase in mortality, and 
up to 20% reduction in life expectancy compared to the general population. 
Although over 30% of Ugandans have some form of mental illness, there are no 
national or hospital-based screening guidelines for cardio-metabolic 
abnormalities among these patients a general trend in most low-income countries. 
The screening rates for cardio-metabolic abnormalities in most low-income 
countries are at only 0.6%. The objective of this study was to describe the 
cardio-metabolic abnormalities among patients with SMI at Mbarara Regional 
Referral Hospital. Through a cross-sectional study, we recruited 304 patients 
with SMI and evaluated them for cardio-metabolic abnormalities using the 
National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for 
dyslipidemias, World Health Organisation criteria for diabetes mellitus, 
obesity, and the Joint national committee criteria for hypertension. We then 
determined the proportion of participants who met the criteria for each of the 
individual cardio-metabolic abnormalities. Of the 304 participants, 44.41% were 
male and 55.59% female with a mean age of 38.56±13.66 years. Almost half 
(46.38%) of the participants were either overweight or obese, 33.22% had 
abdominal obesity, 40.46% were hypertensive, 34.11% had low high-density 
lipoproteins, 37.42% had hypertriglyceridemia and 34.77% had 
hypercholesterolemia. Based on fasting blood sugar, 11.18% and 9.87% had 
pre-diabetes and diabetes respectively. There is a high level of 
cardio-metabolic abnormalities among patients with psychiatric disorders and 
thus metabolic screening for these abnormalities should be done routinely during 
psychiatric reviews. There is a need for national guidelines for screening of 
metabolic abnormalities among patients with SMI so that these abnormalities can 
be detected early enough at stages where they can be either reversed or delayed 
to progress to cardiovascular disease.

This study investigated the isolated effect of modified atmosphere packaging 
(MAP; 50% CO2 and 50% N2) and ultraviolet radiation (UV; 0.30 J/cm2) as well as 
their combined (MAP/UV) effect on reduction of Salmonella typhimurium and 
Escherichia coli O157:H7, biogenic amines (BA), and on shelf life of tilapia 
fillets stored at 4 ± 1 °C for 10 days. UV samples had the highest reduction of 
S. typhimurium (1.13 log colony forming units/g; CFU/g) and E. coli O157:H7 
(0.70 log CFU/g). MAP and MAP/UV reduced the growth of S. typhimurium in 0.50 
log CFU/g and did not affect the growth of E. coli O157:H7. UV, MAP, and MAP/UV 
increased lag phase and/or generation time of all evaluated bacterial groups, 
decreased pH values, ammonia formation, texture changes, and, in general, the BA 
formation throughout storage period, and, therefore, UV, MAP, and MAP/UV 
extended the shelf life for two, three, and at least five days, respectively. 
MAP/UV, MAP, and UV decreased redness, MAP/UV and MAP increased yellowness and 
lipid oxidation, while UV did not affect it. MAP/UV demonstrated promising 
results for shelf life extension; however, different gas ratios in combination 
with other ultraviolet radiation type C (UV-C) doses should be investigated to 
reach the highest microbiological safety and maintenance of the overall quality 
of tilapia fillets.

BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (D-G6PD) is an X-linked 
recessive disorder resulted from deleterious variants in the housekeeping gene 
Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (G6PD), causing impaired response to 
oxidizing agents. Screening for new variations of the gene helps with early 
diagnosis of D-G6PD resulting in a reduction of disease related complications 
and ultimately increased life expectancy of the patients.
METHODS: One thousand five hundred sixty-five infants with pathological jaundice 
were screened for G6PD variants by Sanger sequencing all of the 13 exons, and 
the junctions of exons and introns of the G6PD gene.
RESULTS: We detected G6PD variants in 439 (28.1%) of the 1565 infants with 
pathological jaundice. In total, 9 types of G6PD variants were identified in our 
cohort; and a novel G6PD missense variant c.1118 T > C, p.Phe373Ser in exon 9 of 
the G6PD gene was detected in three families. Infants with this novel variant 
showed decreased activity of G6PD, severe anemia, and pathological jaundice, 
consistent with Class I G6PD deleterious variants. Analysis of the resulting 
protein's structure revealed this novel variant affects G6PD protein stability, 
which could be responsible for the pathogenesis of D-G6PD in these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: High rates of G6PD variants were detected in infants with 
pathological jaundice, and a novel Class I G6PD deleterious variants was 
identified in our cohort. Our data reveal that variant analysis is helpful for 
the diagnosis of D-G6PD in patients, and also for the expansion of the spectrum 
of known G6PD variants used for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis.

QUESTION: Is preoperative physiotherapy cost-effective in reducing postoperative 
pulmonary complications (PPC) and improving quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
after major abdominal surgery?
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis from the hospitals' perspective within a 
multicentre randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation, blinded 
assessors and intention-to-treat analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and forty-one adults awaiting elective upper 
abdominal surgery attending pre-anaesthetic clinics at three public hospitals in 
Australia and New Zealand.
INTERVENTIONS: The experimental group received an information booklet and a 
30-minute face-to-face session, involving respiratory education and breathing 
exercise training, with a physiotherapist. The control group received the 
information booklet only.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The probability of cost-effectiveness and incremental net 
benefits was estimated using bootstrapped incremental PPC and QALY 
cost-effectiveness ratios plotted on cost-effectiveness planes and associated 
probability curves through a range of willingness-to-pay amounts. 
Cost-effectiveness modelling utilised 21-day postoperative hospital cost audit 
data and QALYs estimated from Short Form-Six Domain health utilities and 
mortality to 12 months.
RESULTS: Preoperative physiotherapy had 95% probability of being cost-effective 
with an incremental net benefit to participating hospitals of A$4,958 (95% CI 10 
to 9,197) for each PPC prevented, given that the hospitals were willing to pay 
$45,000 to provide the service. Cost-utility for QALY gains was less certain. 
Sensitivity analyses strengthened cost-effectiveness findings. Improved 
cost-effectiveness and QALY gains were detected when experienced 
physiotherapists delivered the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative physiotherapy aimed at preventing PPCs was highly 
likely to be cost-effective from the hospitals' perspective. For each PPC 
prevented, preoperative physiotherapy is likely to cost the hospitals less than 
the costs estimated to treat a PPC after surgery. Potential QALY gains require 
confirmation.

BACKGROUND: As volumes of total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA) continue to rise, it is important to understand their 
economic impact. No systematic review on cost-effectiveness of THA/TKA has been 
performed since 2016 despite recent changes in the healthcare environment. The 
purpose of the study is to provide a contemporary analysis of the 
cost-effectiveness of total joint arthroplasty and the use of quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs).
METHODS: A systematic review was performed from 2005 to 2020. Online databases 
(OVID Medline, PubMed, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, Google Scholar, 
Elton B. Stephens Co) were queried to identify economic analyses that evaluated 
the cost-effectiveness of THA/TKA.
RESULTS: In total, 38 studies met the screening criteria. Study designs were 
primarily Markov models (68%), cohort studies (16%), and randomized trials (8%). 
Most studies adopted either a societal perspective (45%) or a health system 
perspective (39%). Analysis revealed that THA/TKA was strongly cost-effective 
compared to nonsurgical treatment. THA/TKA procedures that were not delayed were 
more cost-effective than delayed intervention. The majority of studies used 
QALYs as the primary quality metric (82%); in all these studies there was a 
significant improvement in QALYs gained.
CONCLUSION: Given the high economic impact of arthroplasty, ongoing assessment 
of cost-effectiveness is needed. Twenty-four percent of studies included in this 
systematic review were published in the last 4 years of this 15-year study 
period, highlighting the need for continuous assessment of aggregate data. 
Future studies should incorporate the cost-effectiveness of THA and TKA with 
respect to the work-value provided by surgeon providers to support health policy 
and reimbursement.

PURPOSE: To perform a societal cost-benefit analysis comparing intravitreal 
bevacizumab (Avastin), ranibizumab (Lucentis), and aflibercept (Eylea) 
monotherapies for treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD).
DESIGN: Cost-benefit analysis.
METHODS: Center for Value-Based Medicine using published clinical trial and 
Medicare data.
PATIENT POPULATION: 168,400 estimated 2018 U.S. patients with new-onset NVAMD. 
Procedure(s): cost-benefit analysis using 2018 U.S. real dollars.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: 11-year direct ophthalmic medical costs expended for 
bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept monotherapies were compared with 
ophthalmic and nonophthalmic direct medical, direct nonmedical, and indirect 
medical (productivity) costs saved by the therapies.
RESULTS: Bevacizumab monotherapy had an individual, 11-year $14,772 treatment 
cost and net $357,680 societal return (11-year 2,421% return on investment 
[ROI]). Ranibizumab therapy cost $106,582 and returned $265,870 to society (249% 
ROI), whereas aflibercept treatment cost $61,811 and returned $310,611 to 
society (503% ROI). The 2018 NVAMD overall treatment cohort, 11-year net 
societal gain was $28.5 billion to patients and insurers, with $24.2 billion 
(84.9%) coming from bevacizumab therapy, $0.7 billion (2.5%) from ranibizumab 
therapy, and $3.6 billion (12.6%) from aflibercept therapy. Substituting 
bevacizumab for ranibizumab and aflibercept in the 2018 new-onset NVAMD patients 
would save an estimated $1.343 billion over 11 years. Vascular endothelial 
growth factor-inhibitor (VEGF-I) therapy in 2018 should contribute $12.2 billion 
to the Gross Domestic Product over 11 years. Late treatment would decrease this 
by 78% to $2.7 billion.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal NVAMD bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept 
monotherapies accrue considerable financial, ROIs to patients and insurers as 
they increase national wealth.

OBJECTIVE: The symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) in many circumstances lead 
to gait dysfunction which contribute to decreased mobility, reduced quality of 
life, and increased risk of falling. Dual-task conditions have been shown to 
amplify gait dysfunction from a spatiotemporal parameter standpoint; however,
