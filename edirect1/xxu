discussed. Risk factors for depression are presented, and attention is paid to 
the dramatic fact that depression may not only decrease the quality of life, but 
may also stand behind the patient's loss of full functional capacity or even 
death. Suicidal thoughts are experienced by 60% of depressive patients, while as 
many as 15% of them do actually commit suicide. Collective analysis of the 
depression risk factors and concomitant somatic disorders in a given patient 
will surely increase the likelihood of correct diagnosis.

Leprosy patients lack specific cellular immunity against Mycobacterium leprae, 
but other immunological functions are thought to be preserved. However, in a 
leprosy sanatorium in South Japan between 1982 and 2000, we found that the 
average age at death of cured lepromatous leprosy patients was about 5 yrs 
younger than that of cured tuberculoid patients; [male/lepromatous, 76.0 +/- 
10.0 yrs old vs. male/tuberculoid, 79.7 +/- 9.4 yrs old, p = 0.026], and 
[female/lepromatous, 78.0 +/- 10.5 vs. female/tuberculoid, 85.3 +/- 9.8, p = 
0.0001]. This trend was also observed in autopsy records of two other leprosy 
sanatoria in Japan. In a prospective study based on their age in 1982, among 
females in the age group between 60 and 69, lepromatous patients (75.3 +/- 6.0 
yrs) died earlier than tuberculoid patients (81.0 +/- 5.1 yrs) (p < 0.01). These 
findings suggest that lepromatous patients have higher risk of death even in a 
post-chemotherapy era.

ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : The combination of transfusion and chelation therapy has 
dramatically extended the life expectancy of thalassemic patients. The main 
objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of prominent thalassemia 
complications. METHODS : Two hundred twenty patients entered the study. 
Physicians collected demographic and anthropometric data and the history of 
therapies as well as menstrual histories. Patients have been examined to 
determine their pubertal status. Serum levels of 25(OH) D, calcium, phosphate, 
iPTH were measured. Thyroid function was assessed by T3, T4 and TSH. Zinc and 
copper in serum were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. 
Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements at lumbar and femoral regions have been 
done using dual x-ray absorptiometry. The dietary calcium, zinc and copper 
intakes were estimated by food-frequency questionnaires. RESULTS : Short stature 
was seen in 39.3% of our patients. Hypogonadism was seen in 22.9% of boys and 
12.2% of girls. Hypoparathyroidism and primary hypothyroidism was present in 
7.6% and 7.7% of the patients. About 13 % of patients had more than one 
endocrine complication with mean serum ferritin of 1678 +/- 955 micrograms/lit. 
Prevalence of lumbar osteoporosis and osteopenia were 50.7% and 39.4%. Femoral 
osteoporosis and osteopenia were present in 10.8% and 36.9% of the patients. 
Lumbar BMD abnormalities were associated with duration of chelation therapy. Low 
serum zinc and copper was observed in 79.6% and 68% of the study population 
respectively. Serum zinc showed significant association with lumbar but not 
femoral BMD. In 37.2% of patients serum levels of 25(OH) D below 23 nmol/l were 
detected. CONCLUSION : High prevalence of complications among our thalassemics 
signifies the importance of more detailed studies along with therapeutic 
interventions.

BACKGROUND: This article proposes a conceptual framework for addressing social 
contextual factors in cancer prevention interventions, and describes work that 
operationalizes this model in interventions for working class, multiethnic 
populations.
METHODS: The Harvard Cancer Prevention Program Project Includes Three Studies: 
(1) an intervention study in 25 small businesses; (2) an intervention study in 
10 health centers; and (3) a computer simulation modeling project that 
translates risk factor modifications into gains in life expectancy and number of 
cancers averted. The conceptual framework guiding this work articulates pathways 
by which social context may influence health behaviors, and is used to frame the 
interventions and guide evaluation design.
RESULTS: Social contextual factors cut across multiple levels of influence, and 
include individual factors (e.g., material circumstances, psychosocial factors), 
interpersonal factors (e.g., social ties, roles/responsibilities, social norms), 
organizational factors (e.g., work organization, access to health care), and 
neighborhood/community factors (e.g., safety, access to grocery stores). Social 
context is shaped by sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., social class, 
race/ethnicity, gender, age, language) that impact day-to-day realities.
CONCLUSIONS: By illuminating the pathways by which social contextual factors 
influence health behaviors, it will be possible to enhance the effectiveness of 
interventions aimed at reducing social inequalities in risk behaviors.

Catalytically active human telomerase mutants with allele-specific biological 
properties.

Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143-2200, USA.

Expression of the catalytic subunit of human telomerase, hTERT, extends human 
primary fibroblast life span. Such life span extension has generally been 
reported to be accompanied by net telomere lengthening, which led to the 
hypothesis that it is the telomere lengthening that causes the life span 
extension. Here we show that hTERT+C and hTERT-FlagC, mutant telomerase proteins 
with either 10 additional residues or a FLAG epitope added to the hTERT 
C-terminus, confer significant but limited life span extension to IMR90 human 
primary lung fibroblasts. However, as the cells continue to grow for >100 
population doublings past their normal senescence point, bulk telomere length 
continues to erode to lengths much shorter than those seen at the senescence of 
control telomerase-negative cells. Expression of hTERT+C immortalized IMR90 
cells transformed by three different oncogenes. Again, bulk telomeres became 
much shorter than those of the control cells at crisis. Additional hTERT mutants 
were constructed and analyzed similarly. Enzymatically active hTERT-N125A+T126A, 
like other previously reported conserved GQ domain mutants and C-terminally 
HA-tagged hTERT, failed to extend life span. Another GQ domain mutant, 
hTERT-E79A, was indistinguishable from wild-type hTERT in its cell growth 
effects, but there was no net telomere lengthening. These results uncover 
further hTERT allele-specific phenotypes that uncouple telomerase activity, net 
telomere lengthening and life span extension.

Research on smoking cessation has found consistencies and similarities during 
abstinence, but also that the specific signs and symptoms and their intensity 
vary greatly from individual to individual. One possible source of this 
variation is the cognitions associated with quitting. We investigated the 
experiences and associated cognitions in normal cessation by asking quitting 
smokers to rate their experiences on a questionnaire and to indicate the most 
likely reason for each experience. Statistical analyses confirmed that 
attributions to abstinence were significantly higher for increased negative 
experiences, and there were significantly more reattributions than would be 
found by chance for items associated with smoking abstinence. Significantly more 
attributions to abstinence were made by clinic attendees and significantly more 
attributions of negative experiences to abstinence were made by unaided quitters 
using self-help materials. These results can be interpreted in the context of 
attribution theory; quitters may use the cognitions available to them to 
attribute their negative experiences to quitting. Consequently, counsellors 
could use cognitive therapy to alter their clients' expectations and 
explanations of their experiences, and emphasise the positive outcomes of 
cessation.

Potential health and economic impact of adding a human papillomavirus vaccine to 
screening programs.

CONTEXT: Recently published results suggest that effective vaccines against 
cervical cancer-associated human papillomavirus (HPV) may become available 
within the next decade.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential health and economic effects of an HPV 
vaccine in a setting of existing screening.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: A Markov model was used to estimate the 
lifetime (age 12-85 years) costs and life expectancy of a hypothetical cohort of 
women screened for cervical cancer in the United States. Three strategies were 
compared: (1) vaccination only; (2) conventional cytological screening only; and 
(3) vaccination followed by screening. Two of the strategies incorporated a 
vaccine targeted against a defined proportion of high-risk (oncogenic) HPV 
types. Screening intervals of 1, 2, 3, and 5 years and starting ages for 
screening of 18, 22, 24, 26, and 30 years were chosen for 2 of the strategies 
(conventional cytological screening only and vaccination followed by screening).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per life-year gained.
RESULTS: Vaccination only or adding vaccination to screening conducted every 3 
and 5 years was not cost-effective. However, at more frequent screening 
intervals, strategies combining vaccination and screening were preferred. 
Vaccination plus biennial screening delayed until age 24 years had the most 
attractive cost-effectiveness ratio (44 889 dollars) compared with screening 
only beginning at age 18 years and conducted every 3 years. However, the 
strategy of vaccination with annual screening beginning at age 18 years had the 
largest overall reduction in cancer incidence and mortality at a cost of 236 250 
dollars per life-year gained compared with vaccination and annual screening 
beginning at age 22 years. The cost-effectiveness of vaccination plus delayed 
screening was highly sensitive to age of vaccination, duration of vaccine 
efficacy, and cost of vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination for HPV in combination with screening can be a 
cost-effective health intervention, but it depends on maintaining effectiveness 
during the ages of peak oncogenic HPV incidence. Identifying the optimal age for 
vaccination should be a top research priority.

(level 2), York YO10 5NH, UK.

Imatinib mesilate (Glivec), Novartis Pharmaceuticals) is a novel therapy for the 
treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). We evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of imatinib (600 mg daily) when used for the treatment of 
patients in advanced stages of CML (accelerated phase and blast crisis) against 
conventional therapies of combination chemotherapy (DAT) and palliative care in 
hospital or at home. A Markov model simulated the transitions of hypothetical 
patient cohorts and outcomes were modelled for 5 years from the start of 
treatment. Costs were estimated from the perspective of the UK National Health 
Service. Over 5 years, a patient in accelerated phase will, on average, accrue 
an additional 2.09 QALYs with imatinib compared to conventional therapies, while 
patients in blast crisis will accrue an additional 0.58 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) with imatinib compared to conventional therapies. The costs 
per additional QALY gained from treatment with imatinib compared with 
conventional therapies were pound 29344 (accelerated phase) and pound 42239 
(blast crisis). The results were particularly sensitive to the price of 
imatinib, improvements in quality of life, and the duration of haematological 
responses. We conclude that treatment of CML with imatinib confers considerably 
greater survival and quality of life than conventional treatments but at a cost.

Burden of cardiovascular disease in Canada.

Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Team.

BACKGROUND: This report updates the death estimates for cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) in Canada and introduces a population-based perspective on disease 
prevalence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) burden.
METHODS: The Canadian Mortality Database was used to estimate the mortality of 
men and women in different age groups for the 139 Canadian health regions from 
1950 to 1999. Heart disease prevalence and its impact on HRQOL were estimated 
using the 2000-2001 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). Life table 
techniques were used to estimate the impact of heart disease on life and health 
expectancy.
RESULTS: Although CVD remains the leading cause of death in Canada, between 1950 
and 1999 the death rates from CVD dropped from 702 per 100,000 to 288 per 
100,000 men, and from 562 per 100,000 to 175 per 100,000 women. Results from the 
CCHS indicated that 5.4% of men and 4.6% of women reported having heart disease 
as diagnosed by a medical professional. Of these individuals, 14% of men and 21% 
of women reported difficulty ambulating - about six times more than people 
without heart disease. In total, 4.5 years of life expectancy and 2.8 years of 
health expectancy were lost due to CVD. The study also found large differences 
in the burden of CVD among men and women and across the 139 Canadian health 
regions.
CONCLUSIONS: CVD is a major disease burden in terms of both mortality and HRQOL 
and is an important source of health inequalities between populations in Canada. 
Any attempt to improve the health of Canadians or to reduce health inequalities 
should include interventions to reduce CVD mortality and morbidity. Given the 
present impact of CVD on HRQOL, reducing or eliminating heart disease may 
potentially result in an increase in life expectancy that will be larger than 
the gains in health expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The major complications of pelvic inflammatory disease (infertility, 
ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain) are the leading cause of non-HIV 
sexually transmitted disease morbidity in the United States.
GOAL: The goal of the study was to estimate a plausible range for the average 
lifetime cost of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and its major complications 
in a cohort of U.S. women of reproductive age.
STUDY DESIGN: We developed a state-transition computer-based model to simulate 
the natural history of PID, incorporating the severity of infection, number of 
recurrent episodes, treatment setting, and the risk over time of major 
complications. Clinical and cost data were from the published literature. Model 
outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and 
lifetime costs.
RESULTS: In a cohort of 100,000 females acquiring PID between 20 and 24 years of 
age, 8550 ectopic pregnancies, 16,800 cases of infertility, and 18,600 cases of 
chronic pelvic pain were projected to occur. Assuming a 3% annual discount rate, 
we found the average per-person lifetime cost to be $2150. Average lifetime 
costs for women who developed major complications were $6350 for chronic pelvic 
pain, $6840 for ectopic pregnancy, and $1270 for infertility. The majority of 
costs (79%) were accrued within 5 years of upper genital tract infection. 
Results were most sensitive to assumptions about the timing of major 
complications and the discount rate.
CONCLUSION: The average per-person lifetime cost of PID ranges between $1060 and 
$3180. Future cost-effectiveness analyses of STD screening programs can include 
this range as a reasonable upper and lower bound. These findings suggest 
successful PID prevention efforts may avert substantial costs for care providers 
such as managed care organizations while providing well documented clinical 
benefits for women in the United States.

Lumping and splitting: the health policy agenda in India.

Peters DH(1), Rao KS, Fryatt R.

of Public Health, Baltimore 21205, USA. dpeters@jhsph.edu

India's health system was designed in a different era, when expectations of the 
public and private sectors were quite different. India's population is also 
undergoing transitions in the demographic, epidemiologic and social aspects of 
health. Disparities in life expectancy, disease, access to health care and 
protection from financial risks have increased. These factors are challenging 
the health system to respond in new ways. The old approach to national health 
policies and programmes is increasingly inappropriate. By analyzing inter- and 
intra-state differences in contexts and processes, we argue that the content of 
national health policy needs to be more diverse and accommodating to specific 
states and districts. More 'splitting' of India's health policy at the state 
level would better address their health problems, and would open the way to 
innovation and local accountability. States further along the health transition 
would be able to develop policies to deal with the emerging epidemic of 
non-communicable diseases and more appropriate health financing systems. States 
early in the transition would need to focus on improving the quality and access 
of essential public health services, and empowering communities to take more 
ownership. Better 'lumping' of policy issues at the central level is also 
needed, but not in ways that have been done in the past. The central government 
needs to focus on overcoming the large inequalities in health outcomes across 
India, tackle growing challenges to health such as the HIV epidemic, and provide 
the much needed leadership on systemic issues such as the development of systems 
for quality assurance and regulation of the private sector. It also needs to 
support and facilitate states and districts to develop critical capacities 
rather than directly manage programmes. As India develops a more diverse set of 
state health policies, there will be more opportunities to learn what works in 
different policy environments.

University, Anichstrasse 35, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.

OBJECTIVES: to determine medium term technical and clinical success of kissing 
stents for aortoiliac occlusive disease.
DESIGN: retrospective study.
SUBJECTS: twenty-five patients presenting with intermittent claudication (IC) or 
critical limb ischaemia (CLI) due to aortoiliac disease (41 complex stenoses, 8 
occlusions).
METHODS: balloon- or self-expanding kissing stents, with or without 
predilatation depending upon the nature of the disease, were inserted via 
bilateral retrograde femoral artery punctures. Clinical examination, ABPI, 
exercise testing and duplex ultrasound were performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, 
and then annually.
RESULTS: technical success was achieved in 86% segments. All patients with CLI 
improved and 6 of 7 ulcerated limbs showed complete healing. During follow-up, 7 
patients died and two patients required major amputation at 7 and 8 months. The 
primary assisted patency rate was 94, 91 and 65% at 6, 12, and 24 months, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: despite acceptable short-term technical and clinical success, as 
the medium term patency rates are clearly inferior to those of bypass surgery, 
the kissing stent technique should be reserved for high risk patients with a 
limited life expectancy.

Pain in persons with cerebral palsy: extension and cross validation.

Engel JM(1), Jensen MP, Hoffman AJ, Kartin D.

Author information:
(1)Department of Rehabilitation, University of Washington School of Medicine, 
Seattle, WA 98195, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To cross-validate and extend the assessment of pain in persons with 
cerebral palsy (CP).
DESIGN: Standardized in-person interviews.
SETTING: University medical clinics and local residential and community housing 
for persons with developmental disabilities.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred adults with CP.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures of pain intensity, pain interference in daily 
activities, psychologic function, significance of pain problem, and satisfaction 
with pain treatment.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven (67%) subjects reported 1 or more chronic pain problem(s). 
Low back, hip, and leg pain were most common. Twenty-four percent reported 
constant pain; 19% reported that pain occurred daily. Mean pain intensity +/- 
standard deviation over the previous week on an 11-point scale (0, no pain; 10, 
pain as bad as could be) was 4.08+/-2.25. Minor interference (2.55+/-3.03; scale 
range, 0-10) from pain with routine daily activities was reported. Responses to 
the Satisfaction with Life Scale (n=63) indicated only moderate life 
satisfaction (18.44+/-8.34; scale range, 5-35) among those with 1 or more pain 
problem(s). Responses to the Rand Mental Health Inventory (n=65; mean score, 
60.65+/-20.36) revealed relatively high levels of psychologic distress in those 
with chronic pain. Consumer satisfaction with pain management care varied, with 
32.8% of the subjects reporting dissatisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: The study findings are consistent with earlier findings concerning 
pain problems in adults with CP and provide further evidence that pain problems 
may be overlooked and undertreated in this population.

Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, OH 44109, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To measure the satisfaction of individuals with tetraplegia with 
their upper-extremity reconstructive surgery.
DESIGN: Survey.
SETTING: Two Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems centers.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-seven individuals with spinal cord injury at the C4 through 
C8 motor level (107 arms).
INTERVENTIONS: Participants had upper-extremity surgery to improve function. The 
surgical procedures included tendon transfers for elbow extension, wrist 
extension, hand grasp, and pinch or hand grasp neuroprosthesis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: A survey was mailed to participants, who were asked to 
respond to statements such as, "If I had it to do over, I would have the 
hand/arm surgery again," using a 5-level Likert scale (ranging from strongly 
agree to strongly disagree).
RESULTS: Seventy percent of the participants were generally satisfied with the 
results of their upper-extremity surgery, 77% reported a positive impact on 
their lives, 68% reported improvements in activities of daily living (ADLs), 66% 
reported improved independence, 69% reported improvement in occupation, 71% 
reported improved appearance or neutral, 78% reported their hand worked as well 
(or neutral) as it did when surgery was first performed, and 86% reported 
postoperative therapy as being beneficial.
CONCLUSIONS: Upper-extremity surgery had a positive impact on life, increased 
ability to perform ADLs and to be independent, and improved quality of life.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to know if the use of oral Tegafur 
associated to intravesical mitomycin is effective in the prevention of the 
relapses of Ta bladder tumors.
METHOD: This is a prospective study in which we compare the recurrence rate and 
the disease-free interval of 2 groups of 40 patients each one, the first of them 
treated after the TUR with oral Tegafur and intravesical mitomycin, and the 
second with intravesical mitomycin alone. Tolerance of Tegafur was also studied.
RESULTS: The group of the Tegafur presented a descent of the relapse rate and a 
continuation of the time free of illness; but it was not statistically 
significant. The tolerance to the drug was good, without important adverse 
effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Tegafur seems an useful drug in the prevention of the recurrence of 
superficial bladder tumors, although it will be necessary bigger studies to 
reach statistically valid conclusions.

Long-term survival of patients with partial atrioventricular septal defect 
(PAVSD) without operative therapy is very rare. The case is reported of a 
75-year-old man who presented with dyspnea and decline of general condition. A 
heart defect was known but not investigated as the patient refused to undergo 
invasive cardiologic diagnosis. Hence, treatment was conservative. At autopsy, a 
huge (3 cm diameter) ostium primum atrial septal defect (ASD) was found, 
together with deformation of the right and left atrioventricular valves and 
extreme dilatation of the heart. Pulmonary arteriosclerosis indicating pulmonary 
hypertension was present, but there was no lung fibrosis. Life expectancy in 
patients with PAVSD ranges from 3 to 37.5 years. The present patient showed very 
late onset pulmonary hypertension, which may be a critical parameter for 
survival.

Ireland. des.oneill@amnch.ie

Despite a low level of popular advocacy for older people, specialist medical and 
psychiatric services for older people have developed rapidly in Ireland, and 
geriatric medicine has become the largest medical specialty in hospital 
practice. Official policy has incorporated significant recognition of the 
special needs of older people, but implementation of these policies has been 
variable and inadequate. No significant transfer of funding has accompanied 
advances in specialist medical manpower, and there are deficiencies in the full 
complement of rehabilitation therapists available in the hospitals and the 
community. Community and long-term care services are relatively underdeveloped; 
it may require legislative initiatives similar to the Older Americans Act to 
prompt the profound improvement required in these areas.

A metabolic model for life span determination in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Street, Boulder, CO 80309, USA. srea@colorado.edu

Several studies with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have made the 
unexpected discovery that certain hypomorphic mutations in genes encoding 
mitochondrial proteins result in life span extension. These mutations appear to 
act independently of the other known pathway that regulates life span extension, 
the dauer-specifying insulin/IGF-1-like pathway. Here we present a hypothesis 
that unifies the effects of these two classes of genes on longevity. The central 
concept is that energy generation in C. elegans occurs by differential flux 
through two coexisting mitochondrial metabolic pathways-aerobic respiration and 
fermentative malate dismutation. In the latter process, fumarate is terminally 
reduced at complex II to succinate. We suggest that most, if not all, long-lived 
mutants in C. elegans utilize malate dismutation, a byproduct of which is the 
generation of fewer radical species.

We conducted a randomized trial to compare the intensive conventional 
chemotherapy regimen ACVBP (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, 
prednisone) with standard CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and 
prednisone) in previously untreated patients with poor-risk aggressive lymphoma. 
Patients aged 61 to 69 years who had aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma with at 
least one prognostic factor of the age-adjusted international prognostic index 
(IPI) were included. ACVBP consisted of an induction phase of intensified 
chemotherapy and central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis followed by a 
sequential consolidation phase. Of the 708 patients registered for the study, 
635 were eligible. The rate of complete response was 58% in the ACVBP group and 
56% in the CHOP group (P =.5). Treatment-related death occurred in 13% of the 
ACVBP group and 7% of the CHOP group (P =.014). At 5 years, the event-free 
survival was 39% in the ACVBP group and 29% in the CHOP group (P =.005). The 
overall survival was significantly longer for patients treated with ACVBP, at 5 
years it was 46% compared with 38% for patients treated with CHOP (P =.036). CNS 
progressions or relapses were more frequent in the CHOP group (P =.004). Despite 
higher toxicity, the ACVBP regimen, used as first-line treatment for patients 
with poor-risk aggressive lymphoma, is superior to standard CHOP with regard to 
both event-free survival and overall survival.

chronic heart failure.

Academy at Göteborg University, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, 
Sweden. asa.cider@fhs.gu.se

AIMS: Hydrotherapy, i.e. exercise in warm water, as a rehabilitation program has 
been considered potentially dangerous in patients with chronic heart failure 
(CHF) due to the increased venous return caused by the hydrostatic pressure. 
However, hydrotherapy has advantages compared to conventional training. We 
studied the applicability of an exercise programme in a temperature-controlled 
swimming pool, with specific reference to exercise capacity, muscle function, 
quality of life and safety.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with CHF (NYHA II-III, age 72.1+/-6.1) 
were randomised into either 8 weeks of hydrotherapy (n=15), or into a control 
group (n=10). The training program was well tolerated with no adverse events. 
Patients in the hydrotherapy group improved their maximal exercise capacity 
(+6.5 vs.-5.9 W, P=0.001), isometric endurance in knee extension (+4 vs.-9 s, 
P=0.01) together with an improvement in the performance of heel-lift (+4 vs. -3 
n.o., P=<0.01), shoulder abduction (+12 vs. -8 s, P=0.01) and shoulder flexion 
(+6 vs. +4, P=0.01) in comparison to patients in the control group.
CONCLUSION: Physical training in warm water was well tolerated and seems to 
improve exercise capacity as well as muscle function in small muscle groups in 
patients with CHF. This new approach broadens the variety of training regimes 
for older patients with CHF.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess cumulative delivery rates in 
patients with non-obstructive or obstructive azoospermia following treatment by 
testicular sperm extraction (TESE)-ICSI.
METHODS: A cohort follow-up study was conducted. Between January 1994 and 
December 2000, 364 couples with obstructive azoospermia underwent a total of 609 
fresh TESE-ICSI treatment cycles. In addition, 303 fresh TESE-ICSI treatment 
cycles were performed in 235 couples for non-obstructive azoospermia. This study 
included only patients in whom sperm was recovered. In the non-obstructive 
group, only patients with maturation arrest, atrophic sclerosis and germ cell 
aplasia were included. The main outcome measure was a delivery beyond 25 weeks 
gestation.
RESULTS: In patients with obstructive azoospermia, the crude delivery rate after 
three cycles was 35% while the expected cumulative delivery rate was 48% [95% 
confidence interval (CI), 41-55]. On the other hand, in patients with 
non-obstructive azoospermia, the crude cumulative delivery rate after three 
treatment cycles was 17% while the expected delivery rate was 31% (95% CI, 
15-46). A high dropout rate in couples with both non-obstructive and obstructive 
azoospermia was observed (75 and 50% respectively, after the first cycle).
CONCLUSION: This study shows that there is a value in performing several 
TESE-ICSI attempts in patients with obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia. 
The estimates of the non-obstructive group beginning from the third cycle are 
less reliable due to fewer patients. However, overall, the obstructive group 
performed better than the non-obstructive group.

    J Hypertens. 2003 Sep;21(9):1631-4.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of blood 
pressure-lowering treatment over a lifetime.
DESIGN: Markov decision analysis model comparing treatment and non-treatment of 
hypertension.
PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohorts for 20 different strata of sex, age (30-79 
years, in 10-year age bands), and cardiovascular risk (low and high risk).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, and incremental cost : effectiveness 
ratios for treatment and non-treatment strategies.
RESULTS: In terms of life expectancy, blood pressure treatment increased life 
expectancy in all age, sex, and risk strata, by between 1.6 and 10.3%, compared 
with a policy of non-treatment. In terms of cost-effectiveness, treatment was 
more effective, but also cost more than non-treatment for all age, sex, and risk 
strata except the oldest high-risk men and women. Incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) among low-risk groups ranged from pound 1030 
to pound 3304. Cost-effectiveness results for low-risk individuals were 
sensitive to the utility of receiving antihypertensive treatment. Treatment of 
high-risk individuals was highly cost-effective, such that it was the dominant 
strategy in the oldest age group, and resulted in incremental costs per QALY 
ranging from pound 34 to pound 265 in younger age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Policy decisions about which patients to treat depend on whether a 
life-expectancy or cost-effectiveness perspective is taken. Treatment increases 
life expectancy in all strata of age, sex, and cardiovascular risk. However, 
younger individuals stand to gain proportionately more from blood pressure 
treatment than do the elderly. In terms of cost-effectiveness, patients at high 
risk of cardiovascular disease are a highly cost-effective group to treat. In 
patients at lower risk of cardiovascular disease, consideration should be given 
to issues of patient preference and cost.

Obesity is a life-long, progressive, life-threatening, genetically related, 
costly, multifactorial disease manifested by excessive fat storage. It is often 
accompanied by multiple comorbidities including mainly hypertension, diabetes, 
hyperlipidemia, hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, degenerative arthritis 
and psychosocial impairment which influence the patients quality of life and 
ultimately limit their life expectancy. Conservative treatment of morbid and 
extreme obesity including diet, physical activity, behaviour modifications or 
pharmacotherapy is not effective in achieving a medically significant long-term 
weight loss. The costs of such therapy often exceed the costs of the surgical 
procedure. Surgical treatment of obesity was initiated over 50 years ago. Then 
the surgical methods were to lead to an increased excretion but finally did not 
prove useful. They were replaced by restrictive and malabsorption procedures. 
The first methods including vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) were introduced 
in 1982 while gastric banding in 1985. The second method including gastric 
bypasses or biliopancreatic diversion were implemented in the years 1966-1986. 
There are also some methods joining these two techniques. Nowadays as a results 
of minimally invasive surgery development, most of the operations can be 
performed laparoscopically.

Principles of rheumatoid arthritis control.

United Kingdom.

One percent of the UK population suffers from rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with a 
female to male ratio of 3:1. The disease has a major influence on employment and 
disability rates. About 15% are classified as having serious illness, which 
prognostically is equivalent to 3-vessel coronary artery disease. Overall life 
expectancy for those with RA is reduced on average by 5 years. Financial costs 
are enormous. Per-patient, each year, direct and indirect costs total about 7000 
pounds sterling. Costs escalate with disease severity. In a specialist 
rheumatology clinic, about 12% of new referrals have RA, and these patients 
account for more than 40% of the followup workload. The approach to management 
is changing, with emphasis on earlier, more aggressive intervention. This is 
acknowledged to improve outcome. For the severe disease, management has been 
revolutionized by the introduction of biologic agents. RA is managed by a 
multidisciplinary team, and there are active patient support groups. Advances in 
knowledge about genetic and immunological mechanisms of disease hold promise for 
further progress. Never was there a greater need for a successful alliance to 
deliver effective, high quality services involving government, professionals, 
patients, and their advocates.

Bone and joint diseases around the world. Sweden: a brief update on burden and 
priority.

Musculoskeletal conditions are increasingly common with advancing age. The life 
expectancy increased early and rapidly in Sweden, and today 17% of the 
population is over age 65. Musculoskeletal problems are therefore common but in 
general are receiving low attention, despite enormous costs for society. The 
indirect costs for musculoskeletal conditions vastly exceed direct costs (80% vs 
20%). This is obviated by the fact that in 2001, of all persons receiving 
disability pension or taking longterm sick leave, 60% had a diagnosis related to 
the musculoskeletal system. Further, in a population of 9 million, 70,000 
fragility fractures occur each year, 18,000 of the hip and 25,000 of the 
forearm, corresponding to a hip fracture incidence of 20.14/10,000, among the 
highest in the world. Government policy is implemented through several agencies, 
national and local. State of the art reports are currently available in 12 areas 
of musculoskeletal condition, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
osteoporosis, and hip fracture, while no national evidence-based guidelines have 
been developed for these conditions. The Swedish Council on Technology 
Assessment in Health Care provides the scientific foundation of present methods 
for treatment through evidence-based evaluations. National registers are 
continuously evaluating orthopedic implant procedures, of which the Swedish Hip 
Register has provided valuable information on total hip replacements since 1979. 
For the future, there is a need for setting of priorities with regard to 
musculoskeletal conditions, including development of guidelines of mechanism of 
implementation.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of transvaginal sonography (TVS) in 
the diagnostic work-up of women with postmenopausal bleeding.
METHODS: We performed a decision analysis in which we estimated life expectancy 
and cost of four strategies for the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding: TVS 
(I), TVS and office endometrial biopsy (II), TVS and hysteroscopy (III), and 
endometrial biopsy (IV). In strategies incorporating TVS, calculations were 
performed for three different cut-off values between 3 and 9 mm double layer. 
Expectant management, i.e. no diagnosis or treatment was considered to be the 
reference strategy to which the other four strategies were compared. Data were 
obtained from the published literature. In extensive sensitivity analyses, we 
varied patient's age, discount rate, prevalence of endometrial carcinoma and 
atypical hyperplasia, and costs.
RESULTS: The strategy with endometrial biopsy and the strategy with TVS followed 
by endometrial biopsy in case of an increased endometrial thickness were the 
most cost-effective strategies. The strategy starting with endometrial biopsy 
was the most cost-effective when the prevalence of endometrial carcinoma was > 
or =15.3%, whereas the strategy with TVS and endometrial biopsy was the most 
cost-effective for women in which the prevalence of endometrial carcinoma was 
lower. In these strategies, a cut-off level for abnormality of 9 mm resulted in 
lowest cost per life-year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: TVS is of use in women with postmenopausal bleeding and a 
probability of endometrial carcinoma below 15%.

Several reports have shown that the ectopic expression of the human telomerase 
catalytic subunit gene (hTERT) leads to an indefinite extension of the life span 
of human fibroblasts cultured in vitro without the appearance of 
cancer-associated changes. We infected two fibroblast strains derived from 
centenarian individuals with an hTERT containing retrovirus and isolated 
transduced massive populations (cen2tel and cen3tel). In both populations, hTERT 
expression reconstituted telomerase activity and extended the life span. In 
cen2tel, a net telomere lengthening was observed while, in cen3tel, telomeres 
stabilized at a length lower than that detected in senescent parental cells. 
Interestingly, both cen2tel and cen3tel cells developed chromosome anomalies, 
numerical first and structural thereafter. Moreover, cen3tel cells acquired the 
ability to grow in the absence of solid support, a typical feature of
