BACKGROUND: Twenty percent of all newly diagnosed patients with small-cell lung 
cancer (SCLC) are >75 years. Elderly patients may show more toxicity due to 
co-morbidity. We evaluated motives for adherence to treatment guidelines, 
completion of treatment and toxicity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Population-based data from patients aged ≥75 years and 
diagnosed with SCLC in 1997-2004 in The Netherlands were used (368 limited 
disease and 577 extensive disease). Additional data on co-morbidity (Adult 
Co-morbidity Evaluation 27), World Health Organisation performance status (PS), 
treatment, motive for no chemotherapy, adaptations and underlying motive and 
grade 3 or 4 toxicity were gathered from the medical records.
RESULTS: Forty-eight percent did not receive chemotherapy. The most common 
motives were refusal by the patient or family, short life expectancy or a 
combination of high age, co-morbidity and poor PS. Although only relatively fit 
elderly were selected for chemotherapy, 60%-75% developed serious toxicity, and 
two-thirds of all patients could not complete the full chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesise that a better selection by proper geriatric 
assessments is needed to achieve a more favourable balance between benefit and 
harm.

Many advocates of US health reform point to the nation's relatively low 
life-expectancy rankings as evidence that the health care system is performing 
poorly. Others say that poor US health outcomes are largely due not to health 
care but to high rates of smoking, obesity, traffic fatalities, and homicides. 
We used cross-national data on the fifteen-year survival of men and women over 
three decades to examine the validity of these arguments. We found that the risk 
profiles of Americans generally improved relative to those for citizens of many 
other nations, but Americans' relative fifteen-year survival has nevertheless 
been declining. For example, by 2005, fifteen-year survival rates for 
forty-five-year-old US white women were lower than in twelve comparison 
countries with populations of at least seven million and per capita gross 
domestic product (GDP) of at least 60 percent of US per capita GDP in 1975. The 
findings undercut critics who might argue that the US health care system is not 
in need of major changes.

Bedside emergency cardiac ultrasound in children.

Oakland 747, 52 Street, Oakland CA 94609.

Bedside emergency ultrasound has rapidly developed over the past several years 
and has now become part of the standard of care for several applications. While 
it has only recently been applied to critically ill pediatric patients, several 
of the well-established adult indications may be applied to pediatric patients. 
One of the most important and life-saving applications is bedside 
echocardiography. While bedside emergency ultrasonography does not serve to 
replace formal comprehensive studies, it serves as an extension of the physical 
examination. It is especially useful as a rapid and effective tool in the 
diagnosis of pericardial effusions, tamponade and in distinguishing potentially 
reversible causes of pulseless electrical activity from asystole. Most recently, 
left ventricular function and inferior vena cava measurements have proven 
helpful in the assessment of undifferentiated hypotension and shock in adults 
and children. Future research remains to be carried out in determining the 
efficacy of bedside ultrasonography in pediatric-specific pathology such as 
congenital heart disease. This article serves as a comprehensive review of the 
adult literature and a review of the recent applications in the pediatric 
emergency department. It also highlights the techniques of bedside 
ultrasonography with examples of normal and pathologic images.

INTRODUCTION: Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is a common disease whose 
frequency has risen throughout the world in concomitance with the increase in 
life expectancy. BPH causes voiding disturbances known by the acronym LUTS 
(lower urinary tract symptoms), which heavily influence the quality of life in 
the elderly. The treatment for LUTS is mainly divided into medical and surgical, 
the latter usually represented by prostate ablation. Medical therapy includes 
synthetic molecules that interfere with the hormonal control of BPH or act on 
the bladder neck tonus, as well as natural remedies based on plant extracts from 
Serenoa Repens and/or Urtica Dioica.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two groups of patients who were candidates for surgery for 
BPH-induced LUTS, were randomly recruited in a six-month trial aimed at 
comparing outcome of treatment with a new combination of plants extracts 
(Pluvio®), which differs from the previous ones in that it also contains avocado 
and soya oil, as well as a high dose of Urtica Dioica, with no therapy. Age, 
IPSS score, maximal uroflow, prostate volume, PSA, free-to-total PSA ratio, post 
voiding residual urine and number of nocturia episodes were recorded and 
statistically evaluated using a NCSS 60® program.
RESULT: A marked benefit in terms of quality of life, measured by IPSS score, 
uroflow, residual urine and nocturia, was observed in the treated group compared 
to controls. PSA and prostate volume were not significantly affected. No 
noteworthy adverse events were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The new phytotherapeutic combination evaluated in the present study 
would seem to be highly effective for the treatment of LUTS in BPH patients and 
does not have negative side effects. Its use could therefore be strongly 
advocated in this setting.

BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome may have serious consequences for 
both mother and fetus. Women who have suffered from preeclampsia or the HELLP 
syndrome, have an increased risk of developing preeclampsia in a subsequent 
pregnancy. However, most women will develop no or only minor complications. In 
this study, we intend to determine cost-effectiveness of recurrence risk guided 
care versus care as usual in pregnant women with a history of early-onset 
preeclampsia.
METHODS/DESIGN: We developed a prediction model to estimate the individual risk 
of recurrence of early-onset preeclampsia and the HELLP syndrome. In a 
before-after study, pregnant women with preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome in their 
previous pregnancy receiving care as usual (before introduction of the 
prediction model) will be compared with women receiving recurrence risk guided 
care (after introduction of the prediction model). Eligible and pregnant women 
will be recruited at six university hospitals and seven large non-university 
tertiary referral hospitals in the Netherlands. The primary outcome measure is 
the recurrence of early-onset preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome in women allocated 
to the regular monitoring group. For the economic evaluation, a modelling 
approach will be used. Costs and effects of recurrence risk guided care with 
those of care as usual will be compared by means of a decision model. Two 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated: 1) cost per Quality 
Adjusted Life Year (mother unit of analysis) and 2) cost per live born child 
(child unit of analysis).
DISCUSSION: This is, to our knowledge, the first study that evaluates 
prospectively the efficacy of a multivariable prediction rule for recurrent 
hypertensive disease in pregnancy. Results of this study could either be 
integrated into the current guideline on Hypertensive Disorders in Pregnancy, or 
be used to develop a new guideline.

Development of a cardiopulmonary exercise prognostic score for optimizing risk 
stratification in heart failure: the (P)e(R)i(O)dic (B)reathing during 
(E)xercise (PROBE) study.

BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides powerful 
information on risk of death in heart failure (HF). We sought to define the 
relative and additive contribution of the 3 landmark (CPET) prognostic 
markers--peak oxygen consumption (VO₂), minute ventilation/carbon dioxide 
production (VE/VCO₂) slope, and exercise periodic breathing (EPB)-to the overall 
risk of cardiac death and to develop a prognostic score for optimizing risk 
stratification in HF patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 695 stable HF patients (average LVEF: 25 ± 8%) 
underwent a symptom-limited CPET maximum test after familiarization and were 
prospectively tracked for cardiac mortality. At multivariable Cox analysis EPB 
emerged as the strongest prognosticator. Using a statistical bootstrap technique 
(5000 data resamplings), point estimates, and 95% confidence intervals were 
obtained. Thirty-two configurations were adopted to classify patients into a 
given cell, according to EPB presence or absence and values of the 2 other 
covariates. Configurations without EPB and with VE/VCO₂ slope ≤30 were not 
significantly different from 0 (reference value). Statistical power of 
configurations increased with higher VE/VCO₂ slope and lower peak VO₂. This 
prompted us to formulate a score including EPB as a discriminating variable, the 
(P)e(R)i(O)dic (B)reathing during (E)xercise (PROBE), which ranges between -1 
and 1, with zero as reference configuration, that would help to optimize the 
prognostic accuracy of CPET-derived variables. The greatest PROBE score impact 
was provided by EPB, followed by VE/VCO₂ slope, whereas peak VO₂ added minimal 
prognostic power.
CONCLUSIONS: EPB with an elevated VE/VCO₂ slope leads to the highest and most 
precise PROBE score, whereas no additional risk information emerges when EPB is 
present with a peak VO₂ ≤10 mL O₂·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹. PROBE score appears to provide a 
step forward for optimizing CPET use in HF prognostic definition.

Heart rate predicts mortality in patients with heart failure and preserved 
systolic function.

Kapoor JR(1), Heidenreich PA.

Author information:
(1)Division of Cardiology, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.

BACKGROUND: Elevated resting heart rates have been associated with increased 
mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure and decreased left 
ventricular ejection fraction (EF). It is unclear, though, if this association 
applies to those with heart failure and preserved EF.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined outcome for 685 consecutive patients with a 
prior diagnosis of heart failure and a preserved EF (>50%) documented on 
echocardiography at 1 of 3 laboratories. Patients with non-sinus rhythm were 
excluded from the analysis. We determined adjusted mortality rates at 1 year 
after the echocardiogram. The mean age of the cohort was 70 ± 11 years. Of the 
685 included patients, 87% had a history of hypertension, 50% had diabetes, and 
the mean EF was 60% ± 6%. All-cause mortality at 1 year was significantly lower 
in the group with heart rate below 60 beats/min (10%) when compared with the 
group with heart rates between 60 and 70 beats/min (18%), 71-90 beats/min (20%), 
and >90 beats/min (35%) (P < .0001). After adjustment for patient history, 
demographics, laboratory values, and echocardiographic findings, the hazard 
ratios for total mortality (relative to a heart rate of <60) were 1.26 (95% CI, 
0.88-1.80) for HR 60-69, 1.47 (95% CI, 1.02-2.07) for HR 70-90, and 2.00 (95% 
CI, 1.31-3.04) for HR>90 (P = .01 across all groups).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that an elevated resting heart rate is a marker 
for increased mortality in patients with heart failure and preserved systolic 
function. Heart rate may be useful in these patients for improved cardiovascular 
risk assessment.

Comment in
    Am J Kidney Dis. 2010 Dec;56(6):1023-5.

BACKGROUND: The objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of treating 
anemic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to a low (9-10.9 g/dL), intermediate 
(11-12 g/dL), or high (> 12 g/dL) hemoglobin level target compared with a 
strategy of managing anemia without ESAs.
STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Publicly funded health care system. Anemic patients with 
CKD, overall and stratified into dialysis-/non-dialysis-dependent subgroups.
MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: Decision analysis, health care payer, patient's 
lifetime.
MAIN OUTCOME: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: For dialysis patients, compared with anemia management without ESAs, 
using ESAs to target a low hemoglobin level is associated with a cost per QALY 
of $96,270. Given a lack of direct trials comparing low and intermediate 
targets, significant uncertainty exists between these strategies. Treatment to a 
high hemoglobin target was always associated with worse clinical outcomes and 
higher costs compared with a low hemoglobin target. Results were similar in 
non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD, with a cost per QALY for a low target 
compared with no ESA of $147,980.
LIMITATIONS: Given limitations in the available randomized controlled trials, we 
were able to model only 4 treatment strategies, balancing the need to consider 
relevant targets with the requirement for accurate estimates of clinical effect. 
We assumed that the efficacy of the different strategies would continue over a 
patient's lifetime.
CONCLUSIONS: Using ESAs to target a hemoglobin level > 12 g/dL is associated 
with worse clinical outcomes and significant additional cost compared with using 
ESAs to target lower hemoglobin levels (9-12 g/dL). Given a lack of studies 
comparing low (9-10.9 g/dL) and intermediate (11-12 g/dL) hemoglobin targets for 
clinical outcomes, including quality of life, the most cost-effective hemoglobin 
level target within the range of 9-12 g/dL is uncertain, although aiming for 
higher targets within this range will lead to higher costs.

PURPOSE: To compare the quality-adjusted life expectancy and overall survival in 
patients with Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with either 
stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or surgery.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We constructed a Markov model to describe health states 
after either SBRT or lobectomy for Stage I NSCLC for a 5-year time frame. We 
report various treatment strategy survival outcomes stratified by age, sex, and 
pack-year history of smoking, and compared these with an external outcome 
prediction tool (Adjuvant! Online).
RESULTS: Overall survival, cancer-specific survival, and other causes of death 
as predicted by our model correlated closely with those predicted by the 
external prediction tool. Overall survival at 5 years as predicted by baseline 
analysis of our model is in favor of surgery, with a benefit ranging from 2.2% 
to 3.0% for all cohorts. Mean quality-adjusted life expectancy ranged from 3.28 
to 3.78 years after surgery and from 3.35 to 3.87 years for SBRT. The utility 
threshold for preferring SBRT over surgery was 0.90. Outcomes were sensitive to 
quality of life, the proportion of local and regional recurrences treated with 
standard vs. palliative treatments, and the surgery- and SBRT-related 
mortalities.
CONCLUSIONS: The role of SBRT in the medically operable patient is yet to be 
defined. Our model indicates that SBRT may offer comparable overall survival and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy as compared with surgical resection. 
Well-powered prospective studies comparing surgery vs. SBRT in early-stage lung 
cancer are warranted to further investigate the relative survival, quality of 
life, and cost characteristics of both treatment paradigms.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vitro the pre-cementation resistance of CAD/CAM inlays 
subjected to functional occlusal tapping.
METHODS: An extracted tooth model (molar and premolar) with simulated bone and 
periodontal ligament was used to make a medium-size mesio-occlusal inlay 
preparation (molar). Immediate dentin sealing was applied to the prepared tooth. 
The corresponding inlays were fabricated with Cerec either using composite resin 
(Paradigm MZ100) or ceramic (e.max CAD and Mark II) blocks (n=14). A high 
marginal ridge was designed in order to generate hyper-occlusion. 
Pre-cementation occlusal tapping was simulated using closed-loop 
servo-hydraulics at 2 Hz, starting with a load of 40 N, followed by 80, 120, 
160, 200, 240, and 280 N (10 cycles each). All samples were loaded until 
fracture or to a maximum of 70 cycles. Groups were compared using the life table 
survival analysis (p=0.016, Bonferroni method).
RESULTS: Survival probability was e.max CAD>MZ100>Mark II. None of the specimens 
survived the 70 cycles except for two e.max CAD inlays (survival: 14%).
SIGNIFICANCE: Material selection has a significant effect on the risk of Cerec 
inlay fracture during pre-cementation functional occlusal tapping.

Informed consent for interventions in stable coronary artery disease: problems, 
etiologies, and solutions.

Chandrasekharan DP(1), Taggart DP.

Author information:
(1)Nuffield Department of Surgery, Oxford University, John Radcliffe Hospital, 
Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK.

The objective of this review was to determine whether patients undergoing 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting 
(CABG) (1) understand the aims of the proposed intervention, and (2) whether 
they are offered alternative and potentially more effective therapies, as 
required for the process of informed consent. We performed a systematic review 
of Medline for observational studies of patient understanding and perceptions of 
coronary revascularization and of the consent process. Data extraction was of 
patient perceptions of expected symptomatic and prognostic benefits of PCI and 
CABG, and the proportion of patients offered potential alternative treatments. 
Eight studies were identified, of which seven were relevant to PCI and three to 
CABG. On average, 55% of patients correctly believed that PCI would improve 
symptoms, while 78% erroneously believed that PCI would extend life expectancy 
and 71% erroneously believed PCI would prevent future myocardial infarction. On 
average, over 80% of patients correctly identified that CABG would improve 
symptoms, reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and extend life expectancy. 
In the three studies that examined whether alternative therapies were discussed, 
68% of PCI patients and 59% of CABG patients reported no such discussion. In 
conclusion, a large proportion of patients undergoing coronary interventions do 
not appear to understand the rationale for treatment and have erroneous 
perceptions regarding expected benefits. Moreover, patients are frequently not 
offered potentially more effective alternative therapies. This raises important 
questions about the adequacy of the current informed consent process. We 
recommend a multidisciplinary team approach as the most obvious way to remedy 
current practice.

RATIONALE: The markedly improved life expectancy of children with cystic 
fibrosis (CF) has created a new challenge, as traditional markers of lung 
disease are frequently normal in young children. This prevents identification of 
individuals who may benefit from more aggressive therapy and also obliges large 
study numbers and prolonged duration for intervention studies. There is an 
urgent need for alternative surrogates that detect early lung disease and track 
through early childhood.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine whether multiple-breath washout (MBW) 
results at preschool age can predict subsequent abnormal lung function.
METHODS: Preschool children (3-5 yr) with CF and healthy control subjects 
underwent spirometry and MBW with testing repeated during early school age (6-10 
yr). Primary outcomes were FEV1 from spirometry and lung clearance index (LCI) 
from MBW.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-eight children with CF and 45 healthy 
children completed testing. Thirty-five (73%) children with CF had abnormal LCI 
at preschool age, whereas only five had abnormal FEV1. The positive predictive 
value of preschool LCI for predicting any abnormal school-age result was 94%, 
with a negative predictive value of 62%. Only one child with abnormal FEV1 at 
school age had had a normal preschool LCI. In contrast, for preschool FEV1 the 
positive predictive value was 100%, but negative predictive value was only 25%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that an abnormal preschool LCI predicts 
subsequent lung function abnormalities, whereas a normal preschool LCI usually 
remains normal. MBW has potential as a clinical and research outcome in young 
children with CF.

Denosumab is an injectable drug that reduces the risk of fractures. The 
objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of denosumab in a Swedish 
setting, also accounting for poor adherence to treatment. Denosumab is 
cost-effective, particularly for patients at high risk of fracture and low 
adherence to oral treatments.
INTRODUCTION: Denosumab is a novel biologic agent developed for the treatment of 
osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures that has been shown to reduce the risk 
of fractures in a phase III trial. The objective of this study was to estimate 
the cost-effectiveness of denosumab from a societal perspective compared with 
generic alendronate, branded risedronate, strontium ranelate, and no treatment 
in a Swedish setting.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
denosumab given for up to 5 years to a typical Swedish patient population (women 
aged 71 years, T-score ≤ -2.5 SD and a prevalence of morphometric vertebral 
fractures of 34%). The model included treatment persistence and residual effect 
after discontinuation assumed to be equal to the time on treatment. Persistence 
with the comparator treatments and with denosumab was derived from prescription 
data and a persistence study, respectively.
RESULTS: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated at 
€27,000, €12,000, €5,000, and €14,000, for denosumab compared with generic 
alendronate, risedronate, strontium ranelate, and no treatment, respectively. 
Sub-optimal persistence had the greatest impact in the comparison with generic 
alendronate, where the difference in drug cost was large.
CONCLUSION: Improving persistence with osteoporosis treatment impacts positively 
on cost-effectiveness with a larger number of fractures avoided in the 
population targeted for treatment. Denosumab is a cost-effective alternative to 
oral osteoporosis treatments, particularly for patients at high risk of fracture 
and low expected adherence to oral treatments.

This study aimed at determining the effect of chitosan coating on shelf life 
extension of salmon ( Salmo salar ) fillets. The success of edible coatings 
depends highly on their effective wetting capacity of the surfaces on which they 
are applied. In this context in a first stage the surface properties of salmon 
fillets and the wetting capacity of the coatings on fish were evaluated. In 
terms of wettability there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between 
the solutions presenting higher values (solutions 1-4); therefore, solution 1 
with a spreading coefficient (Ws) of -4.73 mN m(-1), was chosen to be 
subsequently analyzed and applied on fish fillets. For shelf life analyses the 
fillets were coated and stored at 0 °C for 18 days. The control and coated fish 
samples were analyzed periodically for total aerobic plate count (TPC), pH, 
total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N), trimethylamine (TMA), thiobarbituric acid 
(TBA), and ATP breakdown products (K value). The results showed that fish 
samples coated with chitosan presented a significant reduction (p < 0.05) for pH 
and K value after 6 days and for TVB, TMA, and TBA values after 9 days of 
storage, when compared to control samples. In terms of microbial growth, a 
slower increase in TPC was observed for the coated fish, indicating that 
chitosan-based coatings were effective in extending for an additional 3 days the 
shelf life of the salmon. These results demonstrate that chitosan-based coatings 
may be an alternative for extending the shelf life of salmon fillets during 
storage at 0 °C.

Program, Department of Pharmacy, Seattle, Washington 98195-7630, USA.

The use of pharmacogenetic testing in clinical practice is limited thus far. A 
potential barrier to the widespread implementation of pharmacogenetic testing is 
the lack of evidence on whether testing provides good value for money. The 
objective of this review was to provide a systematic and critical review of 
economic evaluations of pharmacogenetic testing. A literature search using 
publically available databases was performed for articles published up to 
October 2009. To be included, studies had to meet the definition of being a 
pharmacogenomic study (defined as use of information on human genetic variation 
to target drug therapy) and an economic evaluation (defined as an evaluation of 
both costs and clinical outcomes). Articles that met these criteria were 
subsequently reviewed and graded using the Quality of Health Economic Studies 
(QHES) instrument. Lastly, the evidence for biomarker validity and utility were 
qualitatively assessed using expert opinion. A total of 34 articles were 
identified using our defined criteria. The most common disease category was 
thromboembolic-related diseases (26%), while the most common biomarkers were 
thiopurine methyltransferase and cytochrome P450 2C9 (18% each). Almost all 
studies were published after 2004 (91%). Two types of studies were identified: 
cost-effectiveness studies and cost-utility studies, with roughly half of the 
overall studies being cost-utility studies (53%) and a majority of these 
published within the last 3 years. The average quality score was 77 (range 
29-99). Of the biomarkers reviewed, it was estimated that most had demonstrated 
clinical validity, but only two had demonstrated clinical utility. Despite a 
recent increase in the number of economic evaluations of pharmacogenetic 
applications, further studies examining the clinical validity and utility of 
these biomarkers are needed to support cost-effectiveness assessments.

hyperparathyroidism in Italy.

BACKGROUND: Imbalanced levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum calcium (Ca) 
and phosphorous (P) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) 
death and fracture in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism 
(SHPT). The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet can attenuate the mineral and hormonal 
imbalances characteristic of SHPT and may improve outcomes in such patients. 
Here we describe a cost-utility analysis of cinacalcet for SHPT in dialysis 
patients in Italy.
METHODS: We developed a probabilistic Markov model to simulate the effect of 
cinacalcet on Ca, P and PTH levels in dialysis patients with SHPT, based on data 
from a European, multicentre, open-label study. The model then correlated these 
levels with mortality and morbidity (CV events, fractures and 
parathyroidectomies) using data from the literature, and incorporated Italian 
data for dialysis, drugs and management of events according to the national cost 
structure. The simulation horizon was patient lifetime; simulated treatment 
alternatives were standard treatment (mainly vitamin D sterols and phosphate 
binders) and cinacalcet + standard treatment. A 3.5% discount rate was applied 
to life expectancy (LE), quality-adjusted life-expectancy (QALE), costs and 
times below the upper ranges (time in range [TiR]) recommended by the National 
Kidney Foundation - Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality initiative for PTH, Ca, P 
and Ca × P. Utilities were derived from the published literature and took into 
account dialysis and the impairment of quality of life due to the occurrence of 
CV events and fractures. Costs were evaluated in year 2009 values from the 
perspective of the Italian National Healthcare System.
RESULTS: Baseline results were calculated with 10,000 iterations. Compared with 
standard treatment alone, addition of cinacalcet was associated with a mean (SD) 
increase in TiR of 5.26 (6.59), 3.63 (6.87), 1.70 (6.66) and 2.68 (5.55) 
discounted patient-years for PTH, Ca and P, respectively, and combined PTH, Ca, 
P and Ca × P. Cinacalcet increased LE by 1.20 (3.75) life-years (LYs) and QALE 
by 0.89 (2.59) QALYs. When including the cost for dialysis, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was €50,012 per LY and €67,361 per QALY, while, 
if dialysis costs were not included, the ICER was €23,473 per LY and €31,616 per 
QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that cinacalcet treatment could be considered 
cost effective for treatment of SHPT in the Italian healthcare setting, but 
further investigations are needed to confirm these findings.

Cost effectiveness of imiquimod 5% cream compared with methyl 
aminolevulinate-based photodynamic therapy in the treatment of 
non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic (solar) keratoses: a decision tree

BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis (AK) is caused by chronic exposure to UV radiation 
(sunlight). First-line treatments are cryosurgery, topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 
and topical diclofenac. Where these are contraindicated or less appropriate, 
alternatives are imiquimod and photodynamic therapy (PDT).
OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost effectiveness of imiquimod and methyl 
aminolevulinate-based PDT (MAL-PDT) from the perspective of the UK NHS.
METHODS: A decision tree model was populated with data from a literature review 
and used to estimate costs and QALYs gained and incremental cost effectiveness 
over 1 year. The model simulated patients who were in secondary care, who had 
four to nine AK lesions, and for whom cryosurgery, 5-FU and diclofenac were 
contraindicated or considered less appropriate.
RESULTS: Over 1 year, imiquimod cost £174 less than MAL-PDT (year 2006 values) 
but resulted in 0.005 fewer QALYs gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of MAL-PDT over imiquimod was £34,576. In the probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, there was a 75% probability that imiquimod was cost 
effective compared with MAL-PDT at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained, 
falling to 73% at £30,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Imiquimod may be the more cost-effective treatment at conventional 
cost-effectiveness thresholds. A direct head-to-head study of MAL-PDT versus 
imiquimod is required to reduce uncertainty.

Olecranon fractures are a common injury in fractures. The tension band technique 
for olecranon fractures yields good clinical outcomes; however, it is associated 
with significant complications. In many patients, implants irritate overlying 
soft tissues and cause pain. This is mostly due to protrusion of the proximal 
ends of the K-wires or by the twisted knots of the metal wire tension band. 
Below we described 2 cases of olecranon fractures treated with a unique 
technique using FiberWire without any metallic implants. Technically, the 
fragment was reduced, and two K-wires were inserted from the dorsal cortex of 
the distal segment to the tip of the olecranon. K-wire was exchanged for a 
suture retriever, and 2 strands of FiberWire were retrieved twice. Each of the 
two FiberWires was manually tensioned and knotted on the posterior surface of 
the olecranon. Bony unions could be achieved, and patients had no complaint of 
pain and skin irritation. There was only a small loss of flexion and extension 
in comparison with that of the contralateral side, and the patient did not feel 
inconvenienced in his daily life. Using the method described, difficulty due to 
K-wire or other metallic implants was avoided.

Disability and Mental Health Problems, Dolderseweg 164, 3734 BN Den Dolder, The 
Netherlands. channadewinter@hotmail.com

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of people with intellectual disabilities (IDs) is 
rapidly normalizing, as are prevalences of age-related cardiovascular disease in 
this group. We investigated the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in the 
older population with ID and associations with patient characteristics.
METHODS: Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, according to National Cholesterol 
Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, was assessed with 
standardized physical examinations in 470 Dutch adults with ID, aged ≥50 years, 
who receive residential care from three Dutch care providing organizations. 
Because of skewing towards an overrepresentation of females and more moderate to 
severe ID in the study population, reweighting was applied to obtain a 
representative population prevalence. Correlations with patient characteristics 
were analysed with logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: Four hundred and twelve participants completed all assessments. The 
weighted prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 25.1% [95% confidence interval 
(CI) 21.0-29.3%], with a significantly higher risk for people with mild ID.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in the population with ID 
is significantly higher than that in the general Dutch population aged ≥50 years 
(15.7%, 95% CI 13.5-17.9%).

BACKGROUND: Accurate estimates of cancer survival are important for assessing 
optimal patient care and prognosis. Evaluation of these estimates via relative 
survival (a ratio of observed and expected survival rates) requires a population 
life table that is matched to the cancer population by age, sex, race and/or 
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and ideally risk factors for the cancer under 
examination. Because life tables for all subgroups in a study may be 
unavailable, we investigated whether cause-specific survival could be used as an 
alternative for relative survival.
METHODS: We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
Program for 2,330,905 cancer patients from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 
2004. We defined cancer-specific deaths according to the following variables: 
cause of death, only one tumor or the first of multiple tumors, site of the 
original cancer diagnosis, and comorbidities. Estimates of relative survival and 
cause-specific survival that were derived by use of an actuarial method were 
compared.
RESULTS: Among breast cancer patients who were white, black, or of Asian or 
Pacific Islander descent and who were older than 65 years, estimates of 5-year 
relative survival (107.5%, 106.6%, and 103.0%, respectively) were higher than 
estimates of 5-year cause-specific survival (98.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
= 98.4% to 98.8%; 97.4%, 95% CI = 96.2% to 98.2%; and 99.2%, 95% CI = 98.4%, 
99.6%, respectively). Relative survival methods likely underestimated rates for 
cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (eg, for white cancer patients aged ≥65 
years, relative survival = 54.2%, 95% CI = 53.1% to 55.3%, and cause-specific 
survival = 60.1%, 95% CI = 59.1% to 60.9%) and the lung and bronchus (eg, for 
black cancer patients aged ≥65 years, relative survival = 10.5%, 95% CI = 9.9% 
to 11.2%, and cause-specific survival = 11.9%, 95% CI = 11.2 % to 12.6%), 
largely because of mismatches between the population with these diseases and the 
population used to derive the life table. Socioeconomic differences between 
groups with low and high status in relative survival estimates appeared to be 
inflated (eg, corpus and uterus socioeconomic status gradient was 13.3% by 
relative survival methods and 8.8% by cause-specific survival methods).
CONCLUSION: Although accuracy of the cause of death on a death certificate can 
be problematic for cause-specific survival estimates, cause-specific survival 
methods may be an alternative to relative survival methods when suitable life 
tables are not available.

Vision loss that cannot be corrected medically, surgically, or by refractive 
means is considered low vision. Low vision often results in impairment of daily 
activities, loss of independence, increased risk of fractures, excess health 
care expense, and reduced physical functioning, quality of life, and life 
expectancy. Vision rehabilitation can enable more independent functioning for 
individuals with low vision. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
recognizes the importance of rehabilitation for achieving medically necessary 
goals but has denied Medicare coverage for vision assistive equipment that is 
necessary to complete these goals, although they provide coverage for assistive 
equipment to provide compensation for other disabilities. We believe that this 
is discriminatory and does not comport with congressional intent. The Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services should provide coverage for vision assistive 
equipment, allowing beneficiaries with vision loss to benefit fully from 
Medicare-covered rehabilitation to achieve the cost-effective results of these 
services.

Grainyhead-like 2 enhances the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene 
expression by inhibiting DNA methylation at the 5'-CpG island in normal human 
keratinocytes.

We recently identified Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) as a novel transcription factor 
that binds to and regulates the activity of the human telomerase reverse 
transcriptase (hTERT) gene promoter. In this study, we investigated the 
biological functions of GRHL2 and the molecular mechanism underlying hTERT gene 
regulation by GRHL2. Retroviral transduction of GRHL2 in normal human 
keratinocytes (NHK) led to a significant extension of replicative life span, 
whereas GRHL2 knockdown notably repressed telomerase activity and cell 
proliferation. Using promoter magnetic precipitation coupled with Western 
blotting, we confirmed the binding of GRHL2 to the hTERT promoter and mapped the 
minimal binding region at -53 to -13 of the promoter. Furthermore, mutation 
analysis revealed the three nucleotides from -21 to -19 to be critical for GRHL2 
binding. Because hTERT expression is regulated in part by DNA methylation, we 
determined the effects of GRHL2 on the methylation status of the hTERT promoter. 
Senescent NHK exhibited hypermethylation of the CpG island, which occurred with 
the loss of hTERT expression. On the contrary, the promoter remained 
hypomethylated in GRHL2-transduced NHK, irrespective of cell proliferation 
status. Also, knockdown of endogenous GRHL2 led to hypermethylation of the 
promoter. These results indicate that GRHL2 regulates the hTERT expression 
through an epigenetic mechanism and controls the cellular life span.

BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is widely used for 
the treatment of morbidly obese patients. We prospectively evaluated the effect 
of LAGB since 1995.
METHODS: Between March 1995 and August 2003, 232 morbidly obese patients 
underwent LAGB. The pars flaccida technique was used in the majority of the 
patients. Data were prospectively collected.
RESULTS: The median age was 35 years and 93% were female. Initial median body 
weight was 129 kg with a median BMI of 46. After 5 years of follow-up, median 
BMI decreased to 36 and the median body weight decreased to 98 kg. Median excess 
weight loss was 37% after 1 year, 42% after 3 years and 42% after 5 years of 
follow-up. Late postoperative complications were pouch dilatation (n = 33), port 
revision (n = 19), erosion (n = 4) and necrosis (n = 1).
CONCLUSION: LAGB is a safe and successful treatment for patients with morbid 
obesity. Maximal weight reduction is achieved within 12 months and remains 
stable up to at least 5 years. These results suggest that LAGB could have a 
positive outcome on morbid obesity-associated morbidity and overall life 
expectancy.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of acute spinal cord injury patients having 
assisted ventilation on or after admission between 1981 and 2005.
OBJECTIVE: To assess survival after acute ventilatory support.
SETTING: Northwest Regional Spinal Injuries Centre, Southport, England.
METHODS: Causes of death were ascertained from the Office of National 
Statistics. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival was calculated according to 
ventilator-wean status at discharge. Risk factors were obtained by Cox 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: Over 50% of deaths in weaned and ventilated patients were respiratory 
in origin. The mean survival of weaned patients in the age group 31-45 was 19.3 
compared with 10.5 years for ventilated patients (P=0.047). Those under 30 
survived a further 22.1 and 18.4 years (P=0.31), while those over 45 lived for 
11.0 and 8.3 years (P=0.50), values for weaned and ventilated patients,
