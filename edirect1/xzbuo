(25-200 mg) or PP (39-234 mg) for up to 24 months. Quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) were measured by a schizophrenia-specific algorithm based on the 
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and side-effect assessments; total health 
care costs were assessed from the perspective of the health system.
RESULTS: Mixed-model analysis showed that PP was associated with .0297 greater 
QALYs over 18 months (p=.03) and with $2,100 more in average costs per quarter 
for inpatient and outpatient services and medication compared with HD (p<.001). 
Bootstrap analysis with 5,000 replications showed an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for PP of $508,241 per QALY (95% confidence 
interval=$122,390-$1,582,711). Net health benefits analysis showed a .98 
probability of greater cost-effectiveness for HD compared with PP at an 
estimated value of $150,000 per QALY and a .50 probability of greater 
cost-effectiveness at $500,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: HD was more cost-effective than PP, suggesting that PP's slightly 
greater benefits did not justify its markedly higher costs, which are likely to 
fall once the medication's patent expires.

The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is an 
agricultural pest that seriously infests many crops worldwide. This study used 
electrical penetration graphs (EPGs) and life table parameters to estimate the 
sublethal effects of cyantraniliprole and imidacloprid on the feeding behavior 
and hormesis of M. persicae The sublethal concentrations (LC30) of 
cyantraniliprole and imidacloprid against adult M. persicae were 4.933 and 
0.541 mg L(-1), respectively. The feeding data obtained from EPG analysis 
indicated that the count probes and number of short probes (<3 min) were 
significantly increased when aphids were exposed to LC30 of imidacloprid-treated 
plants. In addition, the phloem-feeding behavior of M persicae was significantly 
impaired on fed tobacco plants treated with cyantraniliprole and imidacloprid at 
LC30 Analysis of life table parameters indicated that the growth and 
reproduction of F1 generation aphids were significantly affected when initial 
adults were exposed to LC30 of cyantraniliprole and imidacloprid. The nymphal 
period, female longevity, total preoviposition period, and mean generation time 
were significantly prolonged when initial adults were exposed to LC30 of 
imidacloprid. By comparison, these parameters were prolonged but not 
significantly in the cyantraniliprole treatment. The fecundity and gross 
reproductive rate were significantly increased in the treated groups. Similarly, 
the net reproductive rate was greater in the treated group than the control 
group. Our results indicate that treatment with LC30 of imidacloprid and 
cyantraniliprole would lead to a hormetic response of M. persicae, with higher 
likelihood of occurrence when initial adults were exposed to LC30 of 
cyantraniliprole.

Prostate cancer is the most common type of male cancer worldwide. Although 
radical prostatectomy (RP) is advised for prostate cancer in patients with a 
life expectancy of more than 10 years by various guidelines, most elderly men 
still do not undergo the procedure regardless of increasing life expectancy. 
This study aimed to determine whether RP is suitable for patients with prostate 
cancer aged 75 years or older. A retrospective study of patients who underwent 
RP at 6 institutions between 2005 and 2012 was conducted. Patients were divided 
into 2 groups at the time of surgery: 65-69 years (younger group) and 75 years 
or older (older group). We compared clinical characteristics, pathological 
results, complication rates, and recurrence-free survival between the two 
groups. Compared with the younger group, the older group had significantly 
higher preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen level, pre- and 
postoperative Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
grade, hypertension prevalence, and Gleason score at biopsy and RP. However, 
except urinary incontinence, there were no statistically significant differences 
in the peri- and post-operative complications. After median follow-up periods of 
36 months (younger group) and 40 months (older group), the biochemical 
recurrence-free survival rates were not significantly different (P = 0.581). 
Although the urinary incontinence rate was higher in the older group, RP was a 
suitable option for selected Korean men aged 75 years or older with limited 
complication rates and excellent outcomes similar to those for patients aged 
65-69 years.

The cooccurrence of more than one oncologic illness in a patient can present a 
diagnostic challenge. Here we report an unusual case of concomitant existence of 
multiple myeloma, breast cancer, and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis on initial 
presentation. The challenge was to accurately diagnose each disease and stage in 
order to maximize the therapeutic regimen to achieve cure/remission. Successful 
management of the patient and increased life expectancy can be achieved by 
multidisciplinary management and patient-oriented approach in multiple primary 
malignant synchronous tumors.

Strategies for Sustainable Cancer Care.

There is an increasing focus on the relative cost-effectiveness and 
sustainability of delivering high-quality cancer care, with most emphasis, 
debatably, given to cost control of innovative treatments. It is difficult to 
calculate all the direct and indirect contributors to the total cost of cancer 
treatment, but it is estimated that cancer drugs constitute 10% to 30% of the 
total cost of cancer care. A 2007 study in France showed the contribution of 
drug costs was less than 20%, with approximately 70% of the total expenditure on 
cancer accounted for by health care resource use, such as hospitalization. The 
U.K. government established the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE)-the dominant function of which is technology appraisal-to 
assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceutical and 
biopharmaceutical products. This is to ensure that all National Health Service 
(NHS) patients have equitable access to the most clinically effective and 
cost-effective treatments that are viable. NICE has developed a transparent, 
public process to judge incremental cost-effectiveness using the 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY), which allows comparisons of 
cost-effectiveness across medical specialties. NICE has been both lauded and 
criticized-especially when it passes judgment on marginally effective but 
expensive anticancer drugs-but it provides a route to "rational rationing" and, 
therefore, may contribute to sustainable cancer care by highlighting the issue 
of affordable medicine. This implies a challenge to the wider oncology community 
as to how we might cooperate to introduce the concept of value-driven cancer 
care.

The number of surgeries performed for adult spinal deformity (ASD) has been 
increasing due to an aging population, longer life expectancy, and studies 
supporting an improvement in health-related quality of life scores after 
operative intervention. However, medical and surgical complication rates remain 
high, and neurological complications such as spinal cord injury and motor 
deficits can be especially debilitating to patients. Several independent factors 
potentially influence the likelihood of neurological complications including 
surgical approach (anterior, lateral, or posterior), use of osteotomies, 
thoracic hyperkyphosis, spinal region, patient characteristics, and revision 
surgery status. The majority of ASD surgeries are performed by a posterior 
approach to the thoracic and/or lumbar spine, but anterior and lateral 
approaches are commonly performed and are associated with unique neural 
complications such as femoral nerve palsy and lumbar plexus injuries. Spinal 
morphology, such as that of hyperkyphosis, has been reported to be a risk factor 
for complications in addition to three-column osteotomies, which are often 
utilized to correct large deformities. Additionally, revision surgeries are 
common in ASD and these patients are at an increased risk of procedure-related 
complications and nervous system injury. Patient selection, surgical technique, 
and use of intraoperative neuromonitoring may reduce the incidence of 
complications and optimize outcomes.

AIM: The maintenance and improvement of self-rated health is important for 
prolonging healthy life expectancy in a well-aged society. In the present study, 
we examined the effectiveness of beauty care on self-rated health among 
community-dwelling older people through a quasi- randomized controlled trial by 
propensity score matching (PSM).
METHOD: One hundred twelve community-dwelling older people who were recruited 
from the local community, participated in a beauty care program that consisted 
of two training sessions per month for 3 months and daily enforcement of facial 
skin care (intervention group). Seven hundred fifty-nine participants who 
received a comprehensive geriatric assessment were treated as a control group. 
Sex, age, BMI, lifestyle habits, hand grip strength, walking speed, skeletal 
muscle mass, bone density, medical history and life function (Kihon Checklist) 
were matched by the PSM method. We compared the subjects' self-rated health, 
depressive mood status (self-rating depression scale: SDS), and the frequency of 
going outdoors in the intervention and control groups before and after 
intervention.
RESULTS: The improvements of SDS were significantly greater in the intervention 
group than in the control group. The self-rated health and the frequency of 
going outdoors were maintained in the intervention group but were significantly 
decreased in the control group.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that beauty care is effective for maintaining and 
improving the self-rated health and depression status of community-dwelling 
older people and that it may help prolong healthy life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Research on socio-economic determinants of migrant health 
inequalities has produced a large body of evidence. There is lack of evidence on 
the influence of structural factors on lives of fragile groups, frequently 
exposed to health inequalities. The role of poor socio-economic status and 
country level structural factors, such as migrant integration policies, in 
explaining migrant health inequalities is unclear. The objective of this paper 
is to examine the role of migrant socio-economic status and the impact of 
migrant integration policies on health inequalities during the recent economic 
crisis in Europe.
METHODS: Using the 2012 wave of Eurostat EU-SILC data for a set of 23 European 
countries, we estimate multilevel mixed-effects ordered logit models for 
self-assessed poor health (SAH) and self-reported limiting long-standing 
illnesses (LLS), and multilevel mixed-effects logit models for self-reported 
chronic illness (SC). We estimate two-level models with individuals nested 
within countries, allowing for both individual socio-economic determinants of 
health and country-level characteristics (healthy life years expectancy, 
proportion of health care expenditure over the GDP, and problems in migrant 
integration policies, derived from the Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX).
RESULTS: Being a non-European citizen or born outside Europe does not increase 
the odds of reporting poor health conditions, in accordance with the "healthy 
migrant effect". However, the country context in terms of problems in migrant 
integration policies influences negatively all of the three measures of health 
(self-reported health status, limiting long-standing illnesses, and 
self-reported chronic illness) in foreign people living in European countries, 
and partially offsets the "healthy migrant effect".
CONCLUSIONS: Policies for migrant integration can reduce migrant health 
disparities.

OBJECTIVES: Increase in aging population is expected to lead to increasing 
prevalence of dementia in India. In this study, we aimed to determine 
prevalence, incidence, and mortality of dementia and its subtypes and assess 
dementia burden in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALY).
METHODS: A community study was conducted over 5 years (2003-2008) in Kolkata, 
India, on 100,802 (males 53,209) randomly selected subjects to assess prevalence 
and capture data on incident cases and deaths. Standard case definitions were 
used. The data were used to estimate years of life lost (YLL) due to premature 
mortality, years of life lived with disability (YLD), and DALY, based on Global 
Burden of Disease 2010 approach.
RESULTS: During 2003-2004, there were 103 (men 55) cases of dementia. The 
prevalence was 1.53% (age adjusted 1.12%) at age ≥65 years. In those ≥55 years 
age, average annual incidence rate of dementia was 72.57 per 100,000. All-cause 
standardized mortality ratio in dementia cases was 4.74 (men 6.19, women 3.03). 
The burden of dementia in 2007-2008 revealed that overall YLL was 47.13 per 
100,000 and YLD ranged from 1.87 to 16.95 per 100,000 depending on the clinical 
severity of dementia. The overall DALY lost per 100,000 due to dementia for the 
year 2007-2008 was 74.19.
CONCLUSIONS: This community study revealed a low prevalence and incidence of 
dementia with consequent low DALY-derived burden of illness compared with many 
industrialized nations. YLL formed major component of DALY indicating premature 
mortality to be an outcome of dementia burden. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &

Although it is considered to be a benign condition, previous studies have shown 
that a subset of patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) may be at risk of 
ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Previous studies have 
suggested that the interval between the peak and the end of the T wave (Tp-e) 
can be used as a marker for the transmural dispersion of repolarization. 
Increased Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio are associated with ventricular 
arrhythmias and SCD. The aim of this study was to assess alterations in 
ventricular repolarization by using the Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio in 
children with MVP and to investigate their relationships with the degree of 
valvular regurgitation. This study prospectively investigated 110 children with 
MVP and 107 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Tp-e interval, 
Tp-e/QT ratio, and QT and QTc dispersions were measured from a 12-lead 
electrocardiogram and compared between groups. QT and QTc dispersions, Tp-e 
interval, and Tp-e/QTc ratio were found to be significantly higher in patients 
with MVP. A positive correlation was found between Tp-e/QTc ratio and increase 
in the degree of mitral regurgitation (MR) (p < 0.05; r = 0.2). However, the 
degree of MR was not associated with QT, QTc, or Tp-e intervals; QT, QTc, or 
Tp-e dispersions; or Tp-e/QT ratio (all p values >0.05). Individuals with MVP 
may be more prone to ventricular arrhythmias due to prolonged QTd, QTcd, and 
Tp-e interval and increased Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios. Therefore, due to their 
longer life expectancy, children with MVP should be followed up on regarding 
life-threatening arrhythmias.

Wood is the main terrestrial biotic reservoir for long-term carbon 
sequestration(1), and its formation in trees consumes around 15% of 
anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions each year(2). However, the seasonal 
dynamics of woody biomass production cannot be quantified from eddy covariance 
or satellite observations. As such, our understanding of this key carbon cycle 
component, and its sensitivity to climate, remains limited. Here, we present 
high-resolution cellular based measurements of wood formation dynamics in three 
coniferous forest sites in northeastern France, performed over a period of 3 
years. We show that stem woody biomass production lags behind stem-girth 
increase by over 1 month. We also analyse more general phenological observations 
of xylem tissue formation in Northern Hemisphere forests and find similar time 
lags in boreal, temperate, subalpine and Mediterranean forests. These time lags 
question the extension of the equivalence between stem size increase and woody 
biomass production to intra-annual time scales(3, 4, 5, 6). They also suggest 
that these two growth processes exhibit differential sensitivities to local 
environmental conditions. Indeed, in the well-watered French sites the seasonal 
dynamics of stem-girth increase matched the photoperiod cycle, whereas those of 
woody biomass production closely followed the seasonal course of temperature. We 
suggest that forecasted changes in the annual cycle of climatic factors(7) may 
shift the phase timing of stem size increase and woody biomass production in the 
future.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer screening in the Basque Country has shown 20 % 
reduction of the number of BC deaths and an acceptable overdiagnosis level (4 % 
of screen detected BC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the breast cancer 
early detection programme in the Basque Country in terms of retrospective 
cost-effectiveness and budget impact from 1996 to 2011.
METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was built to reproduce the natural 
history of breast cancer (BC). We estimated for lifetime follow-up the total 
cost of BC (screening, diagnosis and treatment), as well as quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY), for women invited to participate in the evaluated programme 
during the 15-year period in the actual screening scenario and in a hypothetical 
unscreened scenario. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated with 
the use of aggregated costs. Besides, annual costs were considered for budget 
impact analysis. Both population level and single-cohort analysis were 
performed. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was applied to assess the impact 
of parameters uncertainty.
RESULTS: The actual screening programme involved a cost of 1,127 million euros 
and provided 6.7 million QALYs over the lifetime of the target population, 
resulting in a gain of 8,666 QALYs for an additional cost of 36.4 million euros, 
compared with the unscreened scenario. Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio was 4,214€/QALY. All the model runs in the probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio lower than 
10,000€/QALY. The screening programme involved an increase of the annual budget 
of the Basque Health Service by 5.2 million euros from year 2000 onwards.
CONCLUSIONS: The BC screening programme in the Basque Country proved to be 
cost-effective during the evaluated period and determined an affordable budget 
impact. These results confirm the epidemiological benefits related to the 
centralised screening system and support the continuation of the programme.

BACKGROUND: A declining prevalence of AAA and a shift in the distribution 
towards the older population have been observed during the last decade in 
Europe. The aim was to estimate the current screening prevalence of AAA in men 
aged 65-74 years in a metropolitan area in north-east Spain and to identify 
associated risk factors.
METHODS: A cross sectional prevalence study in men registered in L'Hospitalet 
Primary Healthcare Services (Barcelona, Spain) was performed. There were 619 
randomly selected subjects (expected prevalence of aneurysm, 5%; accuracy of 
estimation, ±2%; loss to follow up, 30%). Exclusion criteria were life 
expectancy <1 year, limited quality of life, previous diagnosis of AAA, prior 
aorto-femoral surgery, and non-Caucasian. The following were measured: internal 
diameter of the infrarenal abdominal aorta using ultrasound, cardiovascular risk 
factors, personal (heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease) and 
family history (AAA), physical examination, and blood tests. We estimated the 
prevalence and 95% confidence interval of AAA, and used logistic regression 
analysis to identify risk factors for AAA.
RESULTS: Among the 651 individuals included in the analysis the prevalence of 
aneurysm was 2.30% (95% CI, 1.30-3.77%). In the regression analysis, AAA was 
associated with smoking (0-10, 11-20, or >20 cigarettes/day), diagnosis of 
myocardial infarction, and being taller than the median (165 cm).
CONCLUSIONS: The current screening prevalence of AAA among men aged 65-74 years 
in a metropolitan area in north-east Spain is similar to that in northern 
Europe. Smoking, myocardial infarction, and height were associated with the 
presence of AAA.

University, Pune, India pchikarmane1@gmail.com.

I draw on my experiences as an organizer with a waste-pickers collective, Kagad 
Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat in Pune, India, to reflect on the power dynamics 
in control of public space. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), a public body, 
has used public resources to facilitate and enable accumulation by private 
companies, who have not been able to produce what they had committed to in the 
processing of waste. The waste pickers, in alliance with affected village-based 
land agitation committees, have mobilized against the dumping that is ruining 
their way of life, environments, and health, and are fighting for their own 
integration into waste value chains. The article uses the frame of David 
Harvey's(1) "right to the city"; a key part of the mobilizing work with waste 
pickers has been Freirean conscientization methods to spread awareness of the 
economic importance, to the city and to the planet, of waste recycling.

OBJECTIVE: To compare how costs relate to disability, disease activity, and 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF)-treated patients with RA in 
southern Sweden (n = 2341) were monitored 2005-2010. Health Assessment 
Questionnaire (HAQ), 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28), and EQ-5D scores 
were linked to register-derived costs of antirheumatic drugs (excluding anti-TNF 
agents), patient care, and work loss from 30 days before to 30 days after each 
visit (n = 13,289). Associations of HAQ/DAS28/EQ-5D to healthcare (patient care 
and drugs) and work loss costs (patients < 65 yrs) were studied in separate 
regression models, comparing standardized β coefficients by nonparametric 
bootstrapping to assess which measure best reflects costs. Analyses were 
conducted based on both individual means (linear regression, comparing 
between-patient associations) and by generalized estimating equations (GEE), 
using all observations to also account for within-patient associations of 
HAQ/DAS28/EQ-5D to costs.
RESULTS: Regardless of the methodology (linear or GEE regression), HAQ was most 
closely related to both cost types, while work loss costs were also more closely 
associated with EQ-5D than DAS28. The results of the linear models for 
healthcare costs were standardized β = 0.21 (95% CI 0.15-0.27), 0.16 
(0.11-0.21), and -0.15 (-0.21 to -0.10) for HAQ/DAS28/EQ-5D, respectively (p < 
0.05 for HAQ vs DAS28/EQ-5D). For work loss costs, the results were standardized 
β = 0.43 (95% CI 0.39-0.48), 0.27 (0.23-0.32), and -0.34 (-0.38 to -0.29) for 
HAQ/DAS28/EQ-5D, respectively (p < 0.05 for HAQ vs DAS28/EQ-5D and for EQ-5D vs 
DAS28).
CONCLUSION: Overall, HAQ disability is a better marker of RA costs than DAS28 or 
EQ-5D HRQOL.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospective multicenter adult spinal 
deformity (ASD) database.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between operative 
and nonoperative treatments for ASD patients.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Operative management of ASD repeatedly demonstrates 
improvements in HRQOL over nonoperative treatment. However, little is reported 
regarding QALY improvements after surgical correction of ASD.
METHODS: Inclusion criteria: ≥18 years, ASD. Health utility values were 
calculated from SF6D scores and used to calculate QALYs at minimum 2 years from 
the baseline utility value as well as at 1, 2, and 3 years for the available 
patients. A 1:1 propensity score matching using six baseline variables was 
conducted to account for the nonrandom distribution of operative and 
nonoperative treatments.
RESULTS: Four hundred seventy-nine patients were included (OP:258, 70.7%, 
NONOP:221, 47.1%). One hundred fifty-one (OP:90, NONOP:61) had complete 1, 2, 
and 3 year data available for QALY trending. Unmatched results are not listed in 
the abstract. Mean baseline utility scores were statistically similar between 
the matched groups (OP: 0.609 ± 0.093, NONOP: 0.600 ± 0.091, P = 0.6401) and at 
2 year min postop mean OP QALY was greater than NONOP (1.377 ± 0.345 vs. 
1.256 ± 0.286, respectively, P < 0.01). For the subanalysis cohort, mean OP 
QALYs at 1, 2, and 3 years postoperative were all significantly greater than 
NONOP, P < 0.03 for all (1 yr: 0.651 ± 0.089 vs. 0.61 ± 0.079, 2 yr: 
1.29 ± 0.157 vs. 1.189 ± 0.141, and 3 yr: 1.903 ± 0.235 vs. 1.749 ± 0.198, 
respectively). Matched OP had a larger QALYs gained (from baseline) at 2 year 
minimum postoperative (0.112 ± 0.243 vs. 0.008 ± 0.195, P < 0.01). For 
subanalysis of patients with complete 1 to 3 years data, OP had a significantly 
larger QALYs gained at 1, 2, and 3 years compared with NONOP: 1 year 
(0.073 ± 0.121 vs. 0.029 ± 0.082, P = 0.0447), 2 years (0.167 ± 0.232 vs. 
0.036 ± 0.173, P = 0.0030), and 3years (0.238 ± 0.379 vs. 0.059 ± 0.258, 
P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The operative treatment of adult spinal deformity results in 
significantly greater mean QALYs and QALYs gained at minimum 2 years postop as 
well as at the 1-, 2-, and 3-year time points compared with nonoperative 
management.

OBJECTIVE: Early-onset inflammatory bowel diseases can result from a wide 
spectrum of rare mendelian disorders. Early molecular diagnosis is crucial in 
defining treatment and in improving life expectancy. Herein we aimed at defining 
the mechanism of an immunodeficiency-polyendrocrinopathy and 
enteropathy-X-linked (IPEX)-like disease combined with a severe immunodeficiency 
in 2 siblings born from distantly related parents.
METHODS: Whole exome sequencing was performed on blood-extracted genomic DNA 
from the 2 affected children and their parents on the genomic platform of 
Institut IMAGINE. Candidate gene mutation was identified using the in-house 
software PolyWeb and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Protein expression was 
determined by western blot. Flow cytometry was used to assess consequences of 
the mutation on lymphocyte phenotype and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) 
activation at diagnosis and after treatment by hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation.
RESULTS: We identified a homozygous missense mutation in mucosa-associated 
lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation 1 gene (MALT1), which precluded protein 
expression. In keeping with the known function of MALT1, NF-κB-dependent 
lymphocyte activation was severely impaired. Moreover, there was a drastic 
reduction in Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) regulatory T cells accounting for the 
IPEX-like phenotype. Following identification of the mutation, both children 
received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which permitted full clinical 
recovery. Immunological workup at 6 and 12 months after transplantation showed 
normal NF-κB activation and correction of regulatory T cells frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: Along with FOXP3, interleukin 2 receptor alpha chain (IL2RA), and 
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 precursor (CTLA-4) mutations, MALT1 deficiency 
should now be considered as a possible cause of IPEX-like syndrome associated 
with immunodeficiency that can be cured by hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation.

Trends in life expectancy of HIV-positive adults on antiretroviral therapy 
across the globe: comparisons with general population.

University of Cape Town, South Africa.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Improved virological and immunological outcomes and reduced 
toxicity of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) raise the hope that life 
expectancy of HIV-positive persons on ART will approach that of the general 
population. We systematically review the literature and summarize published 
estimates of life expectancy of HIV-positive populations on ART. We compare 
their life expectancy with the life expectancy of the general or, in sub-Saharan 
Africa, HIV-negative populations, by time period and gender.
RECENT FINDINGS: Ten relevant studies were published from 2006 to 2015. Three 
studies were from Canada, two from European countries, three from sub-Saharan 
Africa and two were multicountry studies. Life expectancy increased over time in 
all studies and regions. Expressed as the percentage of life expectancy in the 
HIV-negative or general population, estimated life expectancy at age 20 years in 
HIV-positive people on ART ranged from 60.3% (95% CI 58.0-62.6%) in Rwanda 
(2008-2011) to 89.1% (95% CI 84.7-93.6%) in Canada (2008-2012). The percentage 
of life expectancy in the HIV-negative or general population achieved was higher 
in HIV-positive women than in HIV-positive men in all countries, except for 
Canada wherein the opposite was the case.
SUMMARY: Life expectancy in HIV-positive people on ART has improved worldwide in 
recent years, but important gaps remain compared with the general and 
HIV-negative population, and between regions and genders.

OBJECTIVES: Although Americans aged 65 years and older account for only 13.0% of 
the population, they consume one-third of all prescription medications each 
year. Increased life expectancy, age-related deterioration in health, and 
polypharmacy lead to a significant risk of potential medication errors. National 
Poison Data System studies have evaluated the older adult population and their 
interaction with poison centers; however, descriptive studies using regional 
poison center data to evaluate older adult-related medication errors, 
specifically in Alabama, have not been conducted. Our study assessed therapeutic 
errors in patients aged 65 years and older to evaluate the need for potential 
interventions by pharmacists and preventive education to reduce errors reported 
to the Regional Poison Control Center (RPCC) at Children's of Alabama.
METHODS: A four-year retrospective analysis was conducted by gathering 
call-specific data from the RPCC toxiCALL database. Calls were included if they 
were made to the RPCC between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013, involved 
patients aged 65 years and older, and were coded as unintentional therapeutic 
errors. Analysis of call data was conducted using the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention's EpiInfo version 7.0.9.7.
RESULTS: A total of 1699 calls were evaluated for patient demographics (sex, 
age), call data (month, year, shift, caller site), reason for therapeutic error, 
clinical effects, medical outcome, management site, and reported substance 
details. Nearly 40.0% of the therapeutic errors were caused by patients taking 
or being given the same medication twice. Five of the 15 reasons for therapeutic 
errors accounted for nearly 82.0% of all calls reported. The reasons included 
taking or being given the same medication twice (37.3%), taking or being given 
the wrong medication (14.6%), using an incorrect dosing route (13.1%), other 
incorrect dosing errors (9.9%), and taking doses too close together (7.5%). The 
top individual substance involved in a therapeutic error was reported verbatim 
by callers as Spiriva inhalation capsules (10.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic error calls represent a significant and increasing 
proportion of calls made by older adults to the RPCC. The frequent interactions 
between healthcare providers and patients create opportunities to prospectively 
prevent medication problems in older adult patients. Healthcare providers, 
specifically pharmacists, should encourage clients to always read the label on 
medications and should counsel patients carefully when dispensing a product that 
is not an oral preparation. In addition, although national drug take-back days 
are conducted biennially, patients should be encouraged to dispose of old 
medications and expired over-the-counter medications. The RPCC toll-free 
telephone number (800-222-1222) may be displayed to educate patients on its 
24-hour/day availability. Current data will be used to implement programs for 
pharmacist interventions and to create appropriate educational material.

BACKGROUND: The rising life expectancy in the developed world leads to an 
increase in the number of older patients and the complexity of their complaints 
in general practice. Although interventions and support for general 
practitioners are available, implementation lags. Knowledge on what determines a 
complex older patient, the problems of which general practitioners encounter and 
the situations they actually need support for, is necessary for better 
implementation.
METHODS: To provide support to general practitioners in their struggle with 
complex older patients, the aim of this research was to disentangle the concept 
of the complex older patient in general practice. A qualitative approach was 
used consisting of 15 semi-structured interviews with general practitioners. The 
general practitioner was asked to prepare a case of a complex older patient out 
of their own practice that could be discussed during the interview. Transcripts 
of the interview were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Analysis of the interviews resulted in twelve themes that could be 
categorised into five factors that contribute to the complexity of cases of 
older patients. The five factors are: not being in charge, different views on 
necessary care, encountering the boundaries of medicine, limits to providing 
social care, ill-equipped.
CONCLUSION: The factors that were found imply that a better organisational 
structure for elderly care and consulting elderly care physicians could support 
general practitioners in providing care for older complex patients. Furthermore, 
understanding the current concept of patient autonomy seems unjustified in cases 
of complex older patients.
