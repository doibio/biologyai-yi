Recently, there has been a growing interest in the development of 
pharmacological interventions targeting ageing, as well as in the use of machine 
learning for analysing ageing-related data. In this work, we use machine 
learning methods to analyse data from DrugAge, a database of chemical compounds 
(including drugs) modulating lifespan in model organisms. To this end, we 
created four types of datasets for predicting whether or not a compound extends 
the lifespan of C. elegans (the most frequent model organism in DrugAge), using 
four different types of predictive biological features, based on: 
compound-protein interactions, interactions between compounds and proteins 
encoded by ageing-related genes, and two types of terms annotated for proteins 
targeted by the compounds, namely Gene Ontology (GO) terms and physiology terms 
from the WormBase's Phenotype Ontology. To analyse these datasets, we used a 
combination of feature selection methods in a data pre-processing phase and the 
well-established random forest algorithm for learning predictive models from the 
selected features. In addition, we interpreted the most important features in 
the two best models in light of the biology of ageing. One noteworthy feature 
was the GO term "Glutathione metabolic process", which plays an important role 
in cellular redox homeostasis and detoxification. We also predicted the most 
promising novel compounds for extending lifespan from a list of previously 
unlabelled compounds. These include nitroprusside, which is used as an 
antihypertensive medication. Overall, our work opens avenues for future work in 
employing machine learning to predict novel life-extending compounds.

Tea residues represent one of the major agricultural wastes that are generated 
after the processing of tea. They account for 21-28% of crude protein and are 
often discarded without the extraction of valuable proteins. Due to various 
bioactivity and functional properties, tea proteins are an excellent alternative 
to other plant-based proteins for usage as food supplements at a higher dosage. 
Moreover, their good gelation capacity is ideal for the manufacturing of dairy 
products, jellies, condensation protein, gelatin gel, bread, etc. The current 
study is the first to comprehend various tea protein extraction methods and 
their amino acid profile. The preparation of tea protein bioactive peptides and 
hydrolysates are summarized. Several functional properties (solubility, foaming 
capacity, emulsification, water/oil absorption capacity) and bioactivities 
(antioxidant, antihypertensive, antidiabetic) of tea proteins are emphasized.

The Recombination Hotspot Paradox: Co-evolution between PRDM9 and its target 
sites.

Recombination often concentrates in small regions called recombination hotspots 
where recombination is much higher than the genome's average. In many 
vertebrates, including humans, gene PRDM9 specifies which DNA motifs will be the 
target for breaks that initiate recombination, ultimately determining the 
location of recombination hotspots. Because the sequence that breaks (allowing 
recombination) is converted into the sequence that does not break (preventing 
recombination), the latter sequence is over-transmitted to future generations 
and recombination hotspots are self-destructive. Given their self-destructive 
nature, recombination hotspots should eventually become extinct in genomes where 
they are found. While empirical evidence shows that individual hotspots do 
become inactive over time (die), hotspots are abundant in many vertebrates: a 
contradiction called the Recombination Hotspot Paradox. What saves recombination 
hotspots from their foretold extinction? Here we formulate a co-evolutionary 
model of the interaction among sequence-specific gene conversion, fertility 
selection, and recurrent mutation. We find that allelic frequencies oscillate 
leading to stable limit cycles. From a biological perspective this means that 
when fertility selection is weaker than gene conversion, it cannot stop 
individual hotspots from dying but can save them from extinction by driving 
their re-activation (resuscitation). In our model, mutation balances death and 
resuscitation of hotspots, thus maintaining their number over evolutionary time. 
Interestingly, we find that multiple alleles result in oscillations that are 
chaotic and multiple targets in oscillations that are asynchronous between 
targets thus helping to maintain the average genomic recombination probability 
constant. Furthermore, we find that the level of expression of PRDM9 should 
control for the fraction of targets that are hotspots and the overall 
temperature of the genome. Therefore, our co-evolutionary model improves our 
understanding of how hotspots may be replaced, thus contributing to solve the 
Recombination Hotspot Paradox. From a more applied perspective our work provides 
testable predictions regarding the relation between mutation probability and 
fertility selection with life expectancy of hotspots.

BACKGROUND: Long-term and comparative assessments of trends in non-communicable 
disease (NCD) burden attributable to metabolic risk are sparse. This study aimed 
to assess burdens and trends of NCD attributable to metabolic risk factors in 
Australia, 1990-2019.
DESIGN: Population-based observational study.
SETTINGS AND DATA SOURCE: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2019 for Australia and trends in NCD burden attributable metabolic risks 
were estimated using the joinpoint regression model.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: NCD deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) 
attributed to metabolic risk factors, 1990-2019.
RESULTS: Results indicate a 1.1% yearly increase in exposure to combined 
metabolic risk factors from 1990 to 2019. Between 1990 and 2019, the estimated 
absolute number of deaths from NCDs attributed to combined metabolic risks 
increased by 17.0%. However, metabolic risk-related NCD burdens in Australia 
decreased between 1990 and 2019. In 2019, 34.0% of NCD deaths and 20.0% of NCD 
DALYs were attributed to metabolic risk factors, compared with 42.9% and 
24.4%, respectively, in 1990. In 2019, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), neoplasms 
and chronic kidney diseases were the most common NCD deaths attributed to 
metabolic risks. High body mass index accounted for the highest proportion of 
diabetes deaths (47.0%) and DALYs (58.1%) as well as chronic kidney disease 
deaths (35.4%) and DALYs (39.7%). Similarly, high systolic blood pressure 
contributed to a high proportion of chronic kidney disease deaths (60.9%) and 
DALYs (53.2%), and CVDs deaths (44.0%) and DALYs (46.0%).
CONCLUSION: While the contribution of metabolic risk factors to the burden of 
NCDs has declined from 1990 to 2019, their role in NCD death and disability 
remains a challenge as the prevalence of these risk factors has increased. 
Prevention strategies should focus on metabolic risks particularly high body 
mass index and high systolic blood pressure to substantially reduce NCD burdens.

OBJECTIVES: To establish proof of concept of a prehabilitation intervention, a 
combination of education and behavioural change, preceding a physical activity 
programme in people with fibromyalgia (FM).
SETTINGS: Open-label, feasibility clinical trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Eleven people with FM (10 women).
INTERVENTIONS: The prehabilitation intervention consisted of 4 weeks, 1 weekly 
session (~1 to 1.5 hours), aimed to increase self-efficacy and understand why 
and how to engage in a gentle and self-paced physical activity programme (6 
weeks of walking with telephone support).
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the acceptability 
and credibility of the intervention by means of the Credibility/Expectancy 
Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes comprised scales to measure FM severity, 
specific symptoms and sedentary behaviour. An exit interview was conducted to 
identify the strengths and weaknesses and barriers to the intervention.
RESULTS: One participant dropped out due to finding the walking programme 
excessively stressful. Participants expected the intervention would improve 
their symptoms by 22%-38% but resulted in 5%-26% improvements. Participants 
would be confident in recommending this intervention to a friend who experiences 
similar problems. The interviews suggested that the fluctuation of symptoms 
should be considered as an outcome and that the prehabilitation intervention 
should accomodate these fluctuation. Additional suggestions were to incorporate 
initial interviews (patient-centred approach), to tailor the programmes to 
individuals' priorities and to offer a variety of physical activity programmes 
to improve motivation.
CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study demonstrated that our novel approach is 
acceptable to people with FM. Future interventions should pay attention to 
flexibility, symptoms fluctuation and patients support.

Syphilis is a global public health concern. This study aimed to assess the 
global and regional burden of syphilis from 1990 to 2019. Disease burden was 
evaluated using disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and prevalence. Data were 
extracted from the 2019 global burden of disease Study, an open database 
available for download. Age-standardized rates (ASR) and estimated annual 
percentage changes (EAPC) were calculated to evaluate the syphilis burden over 
time. In 2019, the total number of prevalent cases of syphilis was 49.71 million 
worldwide. The ASR of prevalence was stable from 1990 to 2019 with an EAPC 
of 0.00 (95% CI - 0.10-0.11). The number of DALYs caused by syphilis was 
7.36 million in 2019, reflecting a reduction of 16.38% compared with that in 
1990 (8.80 million). The ASR of DALYs exhibited a decreasing trend from 1990 to 
2019 (EAPC =  - 1.01; 95% CI - 1.19 to - 0.84), with the highest rates observed 
in the younger age group (< 14 years old). In 2019, the highest ASR of DALYs was 
found in low sociodemographic index (SDI) regions (239.21/100,000), and the 
lowest in high SDI regions (3.14/100,000). Generally, the ASR of DALYs decreased 
as the SDI increased. The top three countries with the highest ASR of DALYs for 
syphilis were the Solomon Islands, Equatorial Guinea, and Liberia. While the 
global prevalence of syphilis remained persistently high from 1990 to 2019, 
there has been a recent decrease in the ASR of DALYs. Increased attention should 
be dedicated to younger populations and regions characterized by low SDIs.

Lung cancer patients have a high symptom burden that negatively affects their 
quality of life. Increasing patient self-efficacy to deal with treatment side 
effects can ameliorate their symptom burden. Education programs can help enhance 
patient self-efficacy by giving patients more control over their condition 
through increased disease literacy. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility 
of microlearning for delivering lung cancer patients' information on side 
effects of chemotherapy. Secondary objectives of the program are to understand 
the acceptability of microlearning for delivery this type of education to lung 
cancer patients and the potential impact of microlearning on patient 
self-efficacy, knowledge and confidence managing side effects of chemotherapy. A 
mixed-methods prepost test (or quasi-experimental) study design was used to 
better enable patients to identify and manage the side effects of their 
condition and chemotherapy. Participants were patients diagnosed with stage II 
to stage IV lung cancer, who had a life expectancy of greater than 3 months and 
were aged 18 years or older. Multiple validated scales were used to assess 
patient self-efficacy pre- and post-intervention. The online program was 
evaluated using quantitative data of completion rates extracted from the online 
platform. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore the impact of the 
online program on perceived self-efficacy and quality of life. Twenty-three 
participants agreed to participate in the study and five agreed to complete a 
semi-structured interview. Participants found the content comprehensive, 
relevant and engaging. The program improved perceived disease literacy and 
helped participants develop coping strategies to manage side effects. 
Participants also found the platform easy to use and navigate. Additional 
courses and features were requested. Patients with a diagnosis of cancer receive 
a large amount of information about the side effects of chemotherapy and how to 
manage them. This information is often provided soon after diagnosis or upon 
commencement of therapy, which can be overwhelming for some patients. 
Microlearning, a method of online learning that spaces distributing of content 
over several weeks, may be a useful tool for supporting delivering of health 
information to this group of patients.

Alcohol use is a major risk factor for the burden of mortality and morbidity. 
Alcoholic cirrhosis (AC) and alcoholic liver cancer (ALC) are most important and 
severe liver disease outcomes caused by alcohol use. The objectives of the 
current study were to investigate the global prevalence and burden of disease in 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for AC and ALC, based on data from the 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD). Incidence, prevalence, death, and DALYs for GBDs 
in different locations, years, sex, and age groups were estimated using 
DisMod-MR 2.1 and a generic Cause of Death Ensemble Modeling approach. The 
correlations between the age-standardized incidence rate or age-standardized 
death rate and gender, sociodemographic index (SDI), and alcohol usage were 
conducted by Generalized Linear Models. Globally, the changes of 
age-standardized rates of indicators were not much significant over the 30-year 
period. However, the changes varied widely across regions. Central Asia and East 
Europe contributed the highest age-standardized incidence, prevalence, death, 
and DALYs and increased sharply by past 30 years. Generalized Linear Models 
(GLMs) showed male gender as a risk factor of AC, with the relative risk of 
incidence of 1.521 and relative risk of death of 1.503. Globally, there were 
improvements in overall health with regard to GBDs over the 30 years. However, 
the prevention of AC and ALC should be promoted in middle and middle-high SDI 
regions, especially Central Asia and East Europe, whereas more medical resources 
should be provided to improve treatment levels in low SDI region.

Brain and spinal metastases are common in cancer patients and are associated 
with significant morbidity and mortality. Continued advancement in the systemic 
care of cancer has increased the life expectancy of patients, and consequently, 
the incidence of brain and spine metastasis has increased. There has been an 
increase in the understanding of oncogenic mutations, and research has also 
demonstrated spatial and temporal mutations in patients that may drive overall 
treatment resistance and failure. Combinatory treatments with radiation, 
surgery, and newer systemic therapies have continued to increase the life 
expectancy of patients with brain and spine metastases. Given the overall 
complexity of brain and spine metastases, this chapter aims to give a 
comprehensive overview and cover important topics concerning brain and spine 
metastases. This will include the molecular, genetic, radiographic, surgical, 
and non-surgical treatments of brain and spinal metastases.

BACKGROUND: Association of a high-fat diet with increased risks of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, has prompted evaluation of 
lipids in people with CF (pwCF). However, most evidence on dyslipidemia was 
published before CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators became 
a standard of care. The main goal of this study was to investigate the effect of 
CFTR modulator therapies on lipid and lipoprotein profiles in children and 
adolescents with CF.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 153 pwCF (10.1 ± 4.7 years of age) 
and 60 age-matched controls. Most pwCF were pancreatic insufficient on 
pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. By the end of the study, 65% of CF 
participants were on CFTR modulator therapy for >1 month. The results of 
traditional and advanced lipid testing in pwCF were correlated with clinical and 
dietary information.
RESULTS: Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were 
significantly lower in pwCF compared to non-CF participants. Those not receiving 
CFTR modulators also had significantly lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol and HDL particle number than controls. Individuals with CF on 
modulator therapy had significantly higher concentrations of anti-atherogenic 
HDL cholesterol and HDL particles along with lower levels of atherogenic large 
very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, total and small LDL particles, 
and triglycerides compared to those without CFTR modulator therapy.
CONCLUSION: CFTR modulator therapy has a beneficial effect on dyslipidemia in 
CF. It remains to be seen if these positive changes translate into decreased CVD 
risk later in life given the increasing life expectancy in CF.

BACKGROUND: High fasting plasma glucose (HFPG) is the fastest-growing risk 
factor for cancer deaths worldwide. We reported the cancer mortality 
attributable to HFPG at global, regional, and national levels over the past 
three decades and associations with age, period, and birth cohort.
METHODS: Data for this study were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2019, and we used age-period-cohort modelling to estimate age, cohort and 
period effects, as well as net drift (overall annual percentage change) and 
local drift (annual percentage change in each age group).
RESULTS: Over the past 30 years, the global age-standardized mortality rate 
(ASMR) attributable to HFPG has increased by 27.8%. The ASMR in 2019 was highest 
in the male population in high sociodemographic index (SDI) areas (8.70; 95% CI, 
2.23-18.04). The net drift for mortality was highest in the female population in 
low SDI areas (2.33; 95% CI, 2.12-2.55). Unfavourable period and cohort effects 
were found across all SDI quintiles. Cancer subtypes such as "trachea, bronchus, 
and lung cancers", "colon and rectal cancers", "breast cancer" and "pancreatic 
cancer" exhibited similar trends.
CONCLUSIONS: The cancer mortality attributable to HFPG has surged during the 
past three decades. Unfavourable age-period-cohort effects on mortality were 
observed across all SDI quintiles, and the cancer mortality attributable to HFPG 
is expected to continue to increase rapidly in the future, particularly in lower 
SDI locations. This is a grim global public health issue that requires immediate 
attention.

Copper is widely used in agriculture and aquaculture due to its high 
disinfection properties and relatively low cost. However, the increase in copper 
concentration due to evaporation can lead to water reservoir pollution, which 
can harm the health of consumers. The present study aimed to determine the role 
of sulfated polysaccharides (SPs) extracted from Sargassum tenerimum algae in 
reducing lesions caused by the heavy metal copper. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were 
used as a human model in five treatments. The negative and positive control 
groups were fed a diet containing zero percent of SPs, while the experimental 
groups were fed 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% of SPs in three treatments for 56 days, 
finally CuSO4 was exposed only to the positive control group and the groups fed 
with SPs. Results showed a significant decrease in the activity level of ALT 
enzymes (39-16 U/mL), AST (67-46 U/mL), and ALP (485-237 U/mL), confirming the 
results obtained from histopathological studies in CuSO4 exposed groups. The 
addition of SPs to the diet resulted in a significant reduction (sig < 0.05) of 
mortalities due to the decrease of tissue damage. Additionally, due to the 
anti-inflammatory properties and the protective effect of SPs, a significant 
decrease (sig < 0.05) was observed in the relative expression of Il-1β and Tnf-α 
genes.

Listeriosis is a foodborne disease caused by Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), which 
represents a public health problem. Lm has been identified as an important 
contaminating bacterium of ready-to-eat meat products (RTEM) in Mexico. The 
objective was to explore the risk factors for acquiring listeriosis due to 
sausage consumption by defining the consumer profile, evaluating the survival of 
Lm in sausage (5, 10, and 25 °C for 32 days) and performing a quantitative 
microbiological risk assessment. The survey of 100 participants revealed that 
the factors compromising the safety of the RTEM by the consumer are the 
extension of the shelf life. Acquiring packaged RTEM was observed as a safe 
habit. All respondents stated that they were unaware of listeriosis, but 18% 
reported infections linked to RTEM, mainly sausage. The sausage supports the 
growth of Lm, whose population increases in congruence with temperature (25 °C > 
10 °C >5 °C) and storage time (P ≤ 0.05). The increase in temperature decreases 
the adaptation time (Lag25 °C = 1.0 h, Lag10 °C= 92.5 h, Lag5 °C = 226.1 h) and 
increases the growth rate (μ25 °C = 4.43 CFU/h, μ10 °C = 0.075 CFU/h, μ5 °C = 
0.0026 CFU/h) of Lm on the sausage. The risk of listeriosis due to sausage 
consumption increased according to the increase in temperature: 5.53 × 10-8-1.42 
× 10-5 (5 °C), 0.00616-0.111 (10 °C), and 0.109-1.00 (25 °C). Consumer education 
in the hygienic management of RTEM and information on associated pathogens will 
minimize the risk of disease.

Determination of pavement internal condition from a non-destructive field test 
is a persistent topic for its practical necessity and difficulty. It is 
essentially an inverse problem calibrating pavement material and structural 
properties from pavement responses. Considering the intrinsic complexity of 
asphalt pavement materials (e.g., time and temperature dependencies of asphalt 
mixture and stress dependency of unbound granular materials), this problem has 
become a typical high-dimensional optimization problem with a large and diverse 
set of calibrated parameters. This study investigated the feasibility of 
artificial intelligence-based finite element model updating in addressing this 
problem, and focused on the accuracy as well as stability of the backcalculated 
results. For a comprehensive evaluation of this method, the effects of its 
components such as the surrogate model representing the pavement system, 
the applied pavement response, the optimization algorithm and 
the backcalculation scheme were characterized. Finally, we found that the 
sensitivity of applied pavement responses to thebackcalculated pavement 
condition, the number of applied pavement responses and the balance between the 
backcalculated pavement condition and the applied test were of significant 
importance to achieving accurate and stable backcalculation results. 
Corresponding modifications were recommended to be conducted in future research 
for improving the performance of the proposed backcalculation method. This 
article is part of the theme issue 'Artificial intelligence in failure analysis 
of transportation infrastructure and materials'.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the trends in incidence, 
mortality, and burden of esophageal cancer (EC) in Asia from 2010 through 2019 
and compare with other global continental data.
METHODS: We collected EC data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study from 
2010 to 2019 in 49 countries and territories in Asia based on the 
sociodemographic index (SDI). For all locations, annual case data and 
age-standardized rates (ASRs) were extracted to investigate the EC incidence, 
prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). The ASR 
relative difference (%) between years and the male/female (M/F) ratio were 
calculated. Data are reported in values and 95% uncertainty interval (UI).
RESULTS: In 2019, more than 70% of EC new cases, deaths, prevalence, and DALYs 
occurred in Asian countries. From 2010 to 2019, incidences, deaths, prevalence 
cases, and DALY number of EC increased over 1.10-, 1.07-, 1.14-, and 1.03-fold, 
in Asia. During this period, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), 
age-standardized death rate (ASDR), age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), and 
age-standardized DALYs rate (DALYs ASR) of EC decreased by 18, 21, 14, and 22%, 
respectively. The rate of decline in Asia is higher than in the world and other 
continents. In 2019, age-specific incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY cases 
of EC cancer peaked at 65-74, 70-74, 65-69, and 65-69 years, respectively. In 
2019, the highest ASIR, ASDR, ASPR, and DALYs ASR of EC were observed in East 
Asian countries, while having the highest decreasing trend. In 2019, among high 
SDI Asian countries, Taiwan had the highest ASIR, ASPR, and DALYs ASR, and the 
United Arab Emirates had the highest ASDR. Among high-middle SDIs, Kazakhstan 
had the highest ASIR, ASPR, ASDR, and DALYs ASR; among middle SDIs, China had 
the highest ASIR, ASDR, and ASPR, and Viet Nam had the highest DALYs ASR; among 
low-middle SDIs, Mongolia had the highest ASIR, ASDR, ASPR, and DALY ASR of EC 
cancer. Among low SDI Asian countries, Pakistan had the highest ASIR and ASPR, 
and DALY ASR for EC cancer. For four indicators, in most countries, the ratio of 
men was higher than women, and in some countries, this ratio reached more than 
10 times.
CONCLUSION: Although the rate of decline in incidence, death, prevalence and 
burden of EC in Asia was higher than in other areas in the last 10 years, more 
than 70% of these amounts occur in Asia. Therefore, it appears that adopting 
appropriate strategies in the field of identifying and controlling modifiable 
risk factors for EC, implementing screening programs, and timely diagnosis and 
treatment will help in reducing the burden of this disease in Asian countries.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Greater prognostic understanding is associated with 
higher quality care at the end of life. We undertook a scoping review to explore 
how long dialysis recipients expect to live.
STUDY DESIGN: Scoping Review.
SETTING & STUDY POPULATIONS: People with kidney failure over 18 years old.
SEARCH STRATEGY & SOURCES: Studies were identified by searching Medline, Embase, 
APA PsycINFO, HMIC, and ProQuest database for terms related to "life 
expectancy", "self-estimated", and "end stage kidney disease".
DATA EXTRACTION: Search strategies reported 349 unique, potentially eligible 
studies, with 8 studies meeting the inclusion criteria after screening.
RESULTS: Significant mismatches between dialysis recipients and their health 
care provider's estimations of prognosis were reported, with patients predicting 
significantly higher life expectancies than health care professionals and almost 
no agreement between patient and nephrologist's estimates of 1-year survival. 
Documented cognitive impairment did not affect 1-year or 5-year prognosis 
estimates, nor did gender, age, time on dialysis, or discussing perceived life 
expectancy. Dialysis recipients who thought they were on the transplant list or 
who self-identified as African American reported higher perceived life 
expectancy, whereas people who were 75 years or older, or with fair or poor 
self-reported health status reported a lower perceived life expectancy. Those 
with a lower perceived life expectancy preferred care focusing on relieving pain 
and discomfort, whereas people who thought they had a higher chance of survival 
were significantly more likely to prefer life-extending care.
LIMITATIONS: There is a marked paucity of research in this area, with most 
studies conducted in North American cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimistic patient prognostic expectations persist in dialysis 
recipients. Given the effects of perceived life expectancy on treatment choices 
and subsequent quality of life, it is important that transparent discussions 
regarding prognosis are conducted with people receiving dialysis and their 
families.
PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Understanding illness severity and prognosis allows 
people to make decisions and prioritize areas of their lives that are important 
to them. We undertook a scoping review to explore how long dialysis recipients 
expect to live. We found significant mismatches between the perceived life 
expectancy of people treated with dialysis and their health care providers. 
Perceived life expectancy influenced treatment choices; thus, those who thought 
they would die sooner prioritized care focusing on relieving pain and 
discomfort. Those who thought they had a higher chance of survival were more 
likely to prefer life-extending care (with potential effects on quality of 
life). It is important to have frank discussions about prognosis with people 
receiving dialysis, to empower individuals and help them make informed decisions 
about their care.

BACKGROUND: Fractures of the proximal femur account for 30% of all fractures 
requiring surgical treatment. The optimal treatment for per- and 
intertrochanteric fractures, particularly associated with trochanter 
instability, is still open to debate. For these reasons, some authors have 
recently supported the use of bipolar arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty as a 
treatment capable of reducing the risk of complications and obtaining a better 
functional result. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional and 
clinical outcomes at minimum six months of follow up of bipolar hemiarthroplasty 
as the primary treatment for intertrochanteric fracture in older patients. A 
secondary objective was to study the risk of early and intraoperative 
complications.
METHODS: From November 2020 to April 2022, 102 patients with lateral proximal 
femur fracture underwent surgical operation with implant of a long-stemmed 
bipolar hemiarthroplasty. 86 patients were enrolled. The average age at the time 
of fracture was 87.4 ± 4.6 (range 77-98) years. Of the patients, 76.7% were 
female. For all patients intra- and perioperative data were extracted. All 
available patients were evaluated at a minimum 6-months follow-up to
