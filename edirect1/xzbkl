Network-based analysis of comorbidities risk during an infection: SARS and HIV 
case studies.

BACKGROUND: Infections are often associated to comorbidity that increases the 
risk of medical conditions which can lead to further morbidity and mortality. 
SARS is a threat which is similar to MERS virus, but the comorbidity is the key 
aspect to underline their different impacts. One UK doctor says "I'd rather have 
HIV than diabetes" as life expectancy among diabetes patients is lower than that 
of HIV. However, HIV has a comorbidity impact on the diabetes.
RESULTS: We present a quantitative framework to compare and explore comorbidity 
between diseases. By using neighbourhood based benchmark and topological 
methods, we have built comorbidity relationships network based on the OMIM and 
our identified significant genes. Then based on the gene expression, PPI and 
signalling pathways data, we investigate the comorbidity association of these 2 
infective pathologies with other 7 diseases (heart failure, kidney disorder, 
breast cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, bone diseases, Type 1 and Type 2 
diabetes). Phenotypic association is measured by calculating both the Relative 
Risk as the quantified measures of comorbidity tendency of two disease pairs and 
the ϕ-correlation to measure the robustness of the comorbidity associations. The 
differential gene expression profiling strongly suggests that the response of 
SARS affected patients seems to be mainly an innate inflammatory response and 
statistically dysregulates a large number of genes, pathways and PPIs 
subnetworks in different pathologies such as chronic heart failure (21 genes), 
breast cancer (16 genes) and bone diseases (11 genes). HIV-1 induces 
comorbidities relationship with many other diseases, particularly strong 
correlation with the neurological, cancer, metabolic and immunological diseases. 
Similar comorbidities risk is observed from the clinical information. Moreover, 
SARS and HIV infections dysregulate 4 genes (ANXA3, GNS, HIST1H1C, RASA3) and 3 
genes (HBA1, TFRC, GHITM) respectively that affect the ageing process. It is 
notable that HIV and SARS similarly dysregulated 11 genes and 3 pathways. Only 4 
significantly dysregulated genes are common between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 
including NFKBIA that is a key regulator of immune responsiveness implicated in 
susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our method presents a ripe opportunity to use data-driven 
approaches for advancing our current knowledge on disease mechanism and 
predicting disease comorbidities in a quantitative way.

Safety and possible effects of low-intensity resistance training associated with 
partial blood flow restriction in polymyositis and dermatomyositis.

Mattar MA, Gualano B, Perandini LA, Shinjo SK, Lima FR, Sá-Pinto AL, Roschel H.

INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a low-intensity 
resistance training program combined with partial blow flow restriction (BFR 
training) in a cohort of patients with polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis 
(DM).
METHODS: In total, 13 patients with PM and DM completed a 12-week twice a week 
low-intensity (that is, 30% one-repetition-maximum (1RM)) resistance exercise 
training program combined with partial blood flow restriction (BFR). Assessments 
of muscle strength, physical function, quadriceps cross sectional (CSA) area, 
health-related quality of life, and clinical and laboratory parameters were 
assessed at baseline and after the intervention.
RESULTS: The BFR training program was effective in increasing the maximal 
dynamic strength in both the leg-press (19.6%, P <0.001) and knee-extension 
exercises (25.2% P <0.001), as well as in the timed-stands (15.1%, P <0.001) and 
timed-up-and-go test (-4.5%, P =0.002). Quadriceps CSA was also significantly 
increased after the intervention (4.57%, P =0.01). Similarly, all of the 
components of the Short Form-36 Health Survey, the Health Assessment 
Questionnaire scores, and the patient- and physician reported Visual Analogue 
Scale were significantly improved after training (P <0.05). Importantly, no 
clinical evidence or any other self-reported adverse event were found. 
Laboratory parameters (creatine kinase and aldolase) were also unchanged (P 
>0.05) after the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that a 12-week supervised low-intensity resistance 
training program associated with partial blood flow restriction may be safe and 
effective in improving muscle strength and function as well as muscle mass and 
health-related quality of life in patients with PM and DM.

PSA in screening for prostate cancer: more good than harm or more harm than 
good?

Duffy MJ.

The aim of screening for prostate cancer is to detect malignancy at an early and 
potentially treatable stage, thereby increasing the chance of cure. Although 
serum PSA has been used as a screening test for prostate cancer for over 20 
years, the practice is controversial. As a screening test for prostate cancer, 
PSA lacks sensitivity and specificity for early disease. Furthermore, screening 
may lead to unnecessary biopsies, overdetection, and overtreatment. It is thus 
unclear whether the benefits of screening outweigh the harms. Although published 
guidelines differ in their recommendation for PSA screening, almost all state 
that prior to PSA testing, men should be informed of the risks and benefits of 
the process. Most guidelines also state that men with a life expectancy of less 
than 10 years should not be screened. New markers currently undergoing 
evaluation such as -2proPSA, Prostate Health Index, and PCA3 may complement PSA 
in the detection of early prostate cancer.

[Perioperative risk assessment tailored to elderly patients].

[Article in Polish]

Szczepanik AM, Brzuszkiewicz K, Walewska E, Scisło L, Pietruszka S, Szura M, 
Kulig J.

Proper preparation of the patient for surgery has a crucial impact on the 
outcome. Due to the continuous increase in life expectancy more and more often 
the problem of proper perioperative preparation of the patients over 65 years of 
age burdened with a higher risk of perioperative complications is undertaken. 
Proper assessment of the health condition and physical capacity allows to 
optimize treatment and thus minimize the risk of complications. In many 
countries, the recommended procedure is to perform the Comprehensive Geriatric 
Assessment (CGA), which, however, due to the need to carry out a number of 
additional diagnostic tests and consultations is too expensive for the vast 
majority of hospitals. Therefore the search for more convenient methods of 
abbreviated assessment is undertaken, the methods that will identify patients at 
greatest risk of complications. The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment includes 
a series of tests and scales assessing, interalia, cognitive functions, motor 
efficiency, dependency, nutrition and mood. Applied abbreviated methods of 
perioperative assessment also have limitations in predicting the course of 
hospitalization. So far, there is no general practice guidelines for patients 
over 65 years of age. But it seems reasonable to perform the CGA in case of an 
unfavorable outcome of abbreviated assessment or when the threat of frailty 
syndrome is suspected. This procedure enables to select the best method of 
treatment, the implementation of appropriate prevention, thus improving the 
outcome of treatment and quality of life.

[The effectiveness of non-invasive lung ventilation in lateral amyotrophic 
sclerosis].

[Article in Russian]

Levitskiĭ GN, Babak SL, Levin OS, Zverev VV.

OBJECTIVE: Lateral amyotrophic sclerosis (LAS) is a very severe 
neurodegenerative disease with progressive course and terminal respiratory 
insufficiency. Non-invasive lung ventilation (NLV) is a main method of 
treatment. We studied the effectiveness of NLV in LAS and assessed patient's 
adaptation to NLV, life expectancy, compliance and an effect of NLV on 
spirometric parameters.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: NVL was administered to 28 patients, mean age 56.2 ± 9.4 
years, including 10 patients with bulbar onset and 16 with spinal onset. The 
rapid progression of the disease was observed in 15 patients, slow progression 
in 13 patients.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: NLV used in regime S extended the life of patients, in 
particular, patients with spinal onset. The adjustment to the NLV device plays a 
crucial role. Two types of the adjustment were established: gradual (13 
patients) and accelerated (4 patients). The causes of the latter were not found. 
It should be emphasized that several questions related to the details of NVL 
regime should be specified in further research in the field.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of chronic severe pediatric ITP is not well studied. In a 
phase 1/2 12-16-week study, 15/17 romiplostim-treated patients achieved platelet 
counts ≥50 × 109 /L, and romiplostim treatment was well tolerated. In a 
subsequent open-label extension (≤109 weeks), 20/22 patients received 
romiplostim; all achieved platelet counts >50 × 109 /L. Twelve patients 
continued in a second extension (≤127 weeks). Longitudinal data from start of 
romiplostim treatment through the two extensions were evaluated to investigate 
the safety and efficacy of long-term romiplostim treatment in chronic severe 
pediatric ITP.
PROCEDURE: Patients received weekly subcutaneous romiplostim, adjusted by 
1 µg/kg/week to maintain platelet counts (50-200 × 109 /L, maximum dose 
10 µg/kg). Bone marrow examinations were not required.
RESULTS: At baseline, patients were median age 10.0 years; median ITP duration 
2.4 years; median platelet count 13 × 109 /L; 73% were male; and 36% had prior 
splenectomy. Median romiplostim treatment duration was 167 weeks (Q1, Q3: 78,227 
weeks), and median average weekly dose was 5.4 µg/kg (Q1, Q3: 4.3, 8.0 µg/kg). 
Seven patients discontinued treatment: four withdrew consent, two were 
noncompliant, and one received alternative therapy. None withdrew because of 
adverse events (AEs). After the first 12 weeks, median platelet counts remained 
>50 × 109 /L. Eight (36.4%) patients received rescue medication, and 14 (63.6%) 
used concurrent ITP therapy. Seven patients (31.8%) reported serious AEs, and 
two (9.1%) reported life-threatening AEs (both thrombocytopenia); there were no 
serious AEs attributed to treatment and no fatalities.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term romiplostim treatment in this small cohort increased and 
maintained platelet counts for over 4 years in children with ITP with good 
tolerability and without significant toxicity. Pediatr Blood Cancer

The clinical management of HCV in the HIV-infected patient.

Norton B(1), Naggie S.

Author information:

bnorton@montefiore.org.

Chronic hepatitis C affects an estimated 170 million persons worldwide and due 
to shared transmission routes many persons are coinfected with HIV. Since the 
advent of HAART, HIV patients have longer life expectancy and suffer fewer 
AIDS-related complications. The result has been an increase in morbidity and 
mortality from HIV-associated non-AIDS conditions, with high rates of 
liver-related deaths resulting from HCV in the coinfected population. 
Coinfection with HIV is an independent predictor of liver disease progression, 
and proper staging of fibrosis is of critical importance in the coinfected 
patient. In contrast to HIV, it is possible to eradicate HCV infection; and 
undetectable viral load 12 weeks after cessation of therapy, or sustained viral 
response (SVR), is considered a clinical cure. As achievement of SVR has been 
associated with significantly reduced mortality from liver disease and liver 
disease complications, it is imperative that patients coinfected with HIV-HCV 
receive therapy for their HCV infection. The length of therapy with previously 
available interferon-based regimens added a significant burden to 
HIV-HCV-coinfected patients. Newer, all-oral, interferon-free regimens promise 
to simplify treatment regimens, reduce side-effect profiles, and demonstrate 
reduced drug interactions with numerous HAART regimens.

Long-term evaluation of combined prolonged-release oxycodone and naloxone in 
patients with moderate-to-severe chronic pain: pooled analysis of extension 
phases of two Phase III trials.

BACKGROUND: While opioids provide effective analgesia, opioid-induced 
constipation (OIC) can severely impact quality of life and treatment compliance. 
This pooled analysis evaluated the maintenance of efficacy and safety during 
long-term treatment with combined oxycodone/naloxone prolonged-release tablets 
(OXN PR) in adults with moderate-to-severe chronic pain.
METHODS: Patients (N = 474) received open-label OXN PR during 52-week extension 
phases of two studies, having completed 12-week, double-blind, randomized 
treatment with oxycodone prolonged-release tablets (Oxy PR) or OXN PR. Analgesia 
and bowel function were assessed at each study visit using 'Average pain over 
last 24 h scale and Bowel Function Index (BFI), respectively. Treatment 
Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication was assessed at study end only.
KEY RESULTS: Improvement in bowel function was particularly marked in patients 
who switched from Oxy PR in the double-blind phase to OXN PR during the 
extension phase, resulting in a clinically meaningful reduction (≥12 points) in 
BFI score: at the start of the extension phases, mean (SD) BFI score was 44.3 
(28.13), and was 29.8 (26.36) for patients who had received OXN PR in the 
double-blind phase. One week later, BFI scores were similar for the two groups 
(26.5 [24.40] and 27.5 [25.60], respectively), as was observed throughout the 
following months. Fewer than 10% of patients received laxatives regularly. Mean 
24-h pain scores were low and stable throughout the extension phases. No 
unexpected adverse events were observed.
CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Pooled data demonstrate OXN PR is an effective 
long-term therapy for patients with chronic non-cancer pain, and can address 
symptoms of OIC. No new safety issues were observed which were attributable to 
the long-term administration of OXN PR.

with type 2 diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Optimal glucose-lowering therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus 
requires a patient-specific approach. Although a good framework, current 
guidelines are insufficiently detailed to address the different phenotypes and 
individual needs of patients seen in daily practice. We developed a 
patient-specific decision support tool based on a systematic analysis of expert 
opinion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European 
Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2012 position statement, a panel of 
12 European experts rated the appropriateness (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method) 
of treatment strategies for 930 clinical scenarios, which were permutations of 
clinical variables considered relevant to treatment choice. These included 
current treatment, hemoglobin A1c difference from individualized target, risk of 
hypoglycemia, body mass index, life expectancy, and comorbidities. Treatment 
options included addition of a second or third agent, drug switches, and 
replacement by monotherapies if the patient was metformin-intolerant. Treatment 
costs were not considered. Appropriateness (appropriate, inappropriate, 
uncertain) was based on the median score and expert agreement. The panel 
recommendations were embedded in an online decision support tool (DiaScope(®); 
Novo Nordisk Health Care AG, Zürich, Switzerland).
RESULTS: Treatment appropriateness was associated with (combinations of) the 
patient variables mentioned above. As second-line agents, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitors were considered appropriate in all scenarios, followed by 
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (50%), insulins (33%), and 
sulfonylureas (25%), but not pioglitazone (0%). Ratings of third-line 
combinations followed a similar pattern. Disagreement was highest for regimens 
including pioglitazone, sulfonylureas, or insulins and was partly due to 
differences in panelists' opinions and in drug availability and reimbursement 
across European countries (although costs were disregarded in the rating 
process).
CONCLUSIONS: A novel decision support tool based on the ADA/EASD 2012 position 
statement and a systematic analysis of expert opinion has been developed to help 
healthcare professionals to individualize glucose-lowering therapy in daily 
clinical situations.

Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide and flavin 
adenine dinucleotide-essential cofactors for a wide variety of enzymes involving 
in numerous metabolic processes. In this study, a partial-length cDNA encoding 
bifunctional GTP cyclohydrolase II/3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase 
(LcRIBA), 2 full-length cDNAs encoding lumazine synthase (LcLS1 and LcLS2), and 
a full-length cDNA encoding riboflavin synthase (LcRS) were isolated from Lycium 
chinense, an important traditional medicinal plant. Sequence analyses showed 
that these genes exhibited high identities with their orthologous genes as well 
as having the same common features related to plant riboflavin biosynthetic 
genes. LcRIBA, like other plant RIBAs, contained a DHBPS region in its N 
terminus and a GCHII region in its C-terminal part. LcLSs and LcRS carried an 
N-terminal extension found in plant riboflavin biosynthetic genes unlike the 
orthologous microbial genes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
analysis showed that 4 riboflavin biosynthetic genes were constitutively 
expressed in all organs examined of L. chinense plants with the highest 
expression levels found in the leaves or red fruits. LcRIBA, which catalyzes 2 
initial reactions in riboflavin biosynthetic pathway, was the highest transcript 
in the leaves, and hence, the richest content of riboflavin was detected in this 
organ. Our study might provide the basis for investigating the contribution of 
riboflavin in diverse biological activities of L. chinense and may facilitate 
the metabolic engineering of vitamin B2 in crop plants.

Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) can generate heat when 
subjected to an alternating magnetic field (AMF). In the European Union, SPIONs 
actuated by AMF are used in hyperthermia treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, 
an aggressive form of brain cancer. Current data from clinical trials suggest 
that this therapy improves patient life expectancy, but their effect on healthy 
brain cells is virtually unknown. Thus, a viability study involving SPIONs 
subjected to an AMF was carried out on healthy cortical rat astrocytes, the most 
abundant cell type in the mammalian brain. The cells were cultured with 
aminosilane- or starch-coated SPIONs with or without application of an AMF. 
Significant cell death (p < 0.05) was observed only when SPIONs were added to 
astrocyte cultures and subjected to an AMF. Unexpectedly, the decrease in 
astrocyte viability was observed at physiological temperatures (34-40 °C) with 
AMF. A further decrease in astrocyte viability was found only when bulk 
temperatures exceeded 45 °C. To discern differences in the astrocyte structure 
when astrocytes were cultured with particles with or without AMF, scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) was performed. SEM images revealed a change in the 
structure of the astrocyte cell membrane only when astrocytes were cultured with 
SPIONs and actuated with an AMF. This study is the first to report that 
astrocyte death occurs at physiological temperatures in the presence of magnetic 
particles and AMF, suggesting that other mechanisms are responsible for inducing 
astrocyte death in addition to heat.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative 
disease, affecting ∼ 5.2 million people worldwide. Continuous subcutaneous 
apomorphine (CSAI) represents an alternative treatment option for advanced PD 
with motor fluctuation. The purpose of this analysis was to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of CSAI compared with Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel 
(LCIG), Deep-Brain-Stimulation (DBS) and Standard-of-care (SOC).
METHODS: A multi-country Markov-Model to simulate the long-term consequences, 
disease progression (Hoehn & Yahr stages 3-5, percentage of waking-time in the 
OFF-state), complications, and adverse events was developed. Monte-Carlo 
simulation accounted for uncertainty. Probabilities were derived from RCT and 
open-label studies. Costs were estimated from the UK and German healthcare 
provider's perspective. QALYs, life-years (LYs), and costs were projected over a 
life-time horizon.
RESULTS: UK lifetime costs associated with CSAI amounts to £78,251.49 and 
generates 2.85 QALYs and 6.28 LYs (€104,500.08, 2.92 QALYs and 6.49 LYs for 
Germany). Costs associated with LCIG are £130,011.34, achieves 3.06 QALYs and 
6.93 LYs (€175,004.43, 3.18 QALYs and 7.18 LYs for Germany). The 
incremental-cost per QALY gained (ICER) was £244,684.69 (€272,914.58). Costs for 
DBS are £87,730.22, associated with 2.75 QALYs and 6.38 LYs (€105,737.08, 2.85 
QALYs and 6.61 LYs for Germany). CSAI dominates DBS. SOC associated UK costs are 
£76,793.49; 2.62 QALYs and 5.76 LYs were reached (€90,011.91, 2.73 QALYs and 6 
LYs for Germany).
CONCLUSIONS: From a health economic perspective, CSAI is a cost-effective 
therapy and could be seen as an alternative treatment to LCIG or DBS for 
patients with advanced PD.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Upper airway stimulation (UAS) is a new approach to treat 
moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. Recently, 12-month data from the 
Stimulation Treatment for Apnea Reduction (STAR) trial were reported, evaluating 
the effectiveness of UAS in patients intolerant or non-adherent to continuous 
positive airway pressure therapy. Our objective was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of UAS from a U.S. payer perspective.
DESIGN: A 5-state Markov model was used to predict cardiovascular endpoints 
(myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, hypertension), motor vehicle collisions 
(MVC), mortality, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs. We computed 
10-year relative event risks and the lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) in $/QALY, comparing UAS therapy to no treatment under the 
assumption that the STAR trial-observed reduction in mean apnea-hypopnea index 
from 32.0 to 15.3 events/h was maintained. Costs and effects were discounted at 
3% per year.
SETTING: U.S. healthcare system; third-party payer perspective.
PARTICIPANTS: 83% male cohort with mean age of 54.5 years.
INTERVENTIONS: UAS vs. no treatment.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: UAS substantially reduced event probabilities over 10 
years (relative risks: MI 0.63; stroke 0.75; MVC 0.34), and was projected to add 
1.09 QALYs over the patient's lifetime. Costs were estimated to increase by 
$42,953, resulting in a lifetime ICER of $39,471/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Relative to the acknowledged willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$50,000-$100,000/QALY, our results indicate upper airway stimulation is a 
cost-effective therapy in the U.S. healthcare system.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: A link between sleep loss and increased risk for the 
development of diabetes is now well recognized. The current study investigates 
whether sleep extension under real-life conditions is a feasible intervention 
with a beneficial impact on glucose metabolism in healthy adults who are 
chronically sleep restricted.
DESIGN: Intervention study.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen healthy non-obese volunteers (25 [23, 27.8] years old, 3 
men).
INTERVENTIONS: Two weeks of habitual time in bed followed by 6 weeks during 
which participants were instructed to increase their time in bed by one hour per 
day.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Continuous actigraphy monitoring and daily sleep logs 
during the entire study. Glucose and insulin were assayed on a single morning 
blood sample at the end of habitual time in bed and at the end of sleep 
extension. Home polysomnography was performed during one weekday of habitual 
time in bed and after 40 days of sleep extension. Sleep time during weekdays 
increased (mean actigraphic data: +44 ± 34 minutes, P < 0.0001; polysomnographic 
data: +49 ± 68 minutes, P = 0.014), without any significant change during 
weekends. Changes from habitual time in bed to the end of the intervention in 
total sleep time correlated with changes in glucose (r = +0.53, P = 0.041) and 
insulin levels (r = -0.60, P = 0.025), as well as with indices of insulin 
sensitivity (r = +0.76, P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: In healthy adults who are chronically sleep restricted, a simple 
low cost intervention such as sleep extension is feasible and is associated with 
improvements in fasting insulin sensitivity.

The genes encoding six novel esterolytic/lipolytic enzymes, termed LC-Est1∼6, 
were isolated from a fosmid library of a leaf-branch compost metagenome by 
functional screening using tributyrin agar plates. These enzymes greatly vary in 
size and amino acid sequence. The highest identity between the amino acid 
sequence of each enzyme and that available from the database varies from 44 to 
73%. Of these metagenome-derived enzymes, LC-Est1 is characterized by the 
presence of a long N-terminal extension (LNTE, residues 26-283) between a 
putative signal peptide (residues 1-25) and a C-terminal esterase domain 
(residues 284-510). A putative esterase from Candidatus Solibacter usitatus 
(CSu-Est) is the only protein, which shows the significant amino acid sequence 
identity (46%) to the entire region of LC-Est1. To examine whether LC-Est1 
exhibits activity and its LNTE is important for activity and stability of the 
esterase domain, LC-Est1 (residues 26-510), LC-Est1C (residues 284-510), and 
LC-Est1C* (residues 304-510) were overproduced in E. coli, purified, and 
characterized. LC-Est1C* was only used for structural analysis. The crystal 
structure of LC-Est1C* highly resembles that of the catalytic domain of 
Thermotoga maritima esterase, suggesting that LNTE is not required for folding 
of the esterase domain. The enzymatic activity of LC-Est1C was lower than that 
of LC-Est1 by 60%, although its substrate specificity was similar to that of 
LC-Est1. LC-Est1C was less stable than LC-Est1 by 3.3°C. These results suggest 
that LNTE of LC-Est1 rather exists as an independent domain but is required for 
maximal activity and stability of the esterase domain.

OBJECTIVE: To assess, from a health sector perspective, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness of three treatment recommendations in the most recent 
Australian Clinical Practice Guidelines for posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD). The interventions assessed are trauma-focused cognitive behavioural 
therapy (TF-CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for the 
treatment of PTSD in adults and TF-CBT in children, compared to current practice 
in Australia.
METHOD: Economic modelling, using existing databases and published information, 
was used to assess cost-effectiveness. A cost-utility framework using both 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) averted was used. Costs were tracked for the duration of the respective 
interventions and applied to the estimated 12 months prevalent cases of PTSD in 
the Australian population of 2012. Simulation modelling was used to provide 95% 
uncertainty around the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Consideration was 
also given to factors not considered in the quantitative analysis but could 
determine the likely uptake of the proposed intervention guidelines.
RESULTS: TF-CBT is highly cost-effective compared to current practice at 
$19,000/QALY, $16,000/DALY in adults and $8900/QALY, $8000/DALY in children. In 
adults, 100% of uncertainty iterations fell beneath the $50,000/QALY or DALY 
value-for-money threshold. Using SSRIs in people already on medications is 
cost-effective at $200/QALY, but has considerable uncertainty around the costs 
and benefits. While there is a 13% chance of health loss there is a 27% chance 
of the intervention dominating current practice by both saving dollars and 
improving health in adults.
CONCLUSION: The three Guideline recommended interventions evaluated in this 
study are likely to have a positive impact on the economic efficiency of the 
treatment of PTSD if adopted in full. While there are gaps in the evidence base, 
policy-makers can have considerable confidence that the recommendations assessed 
in the current study are likely to improve the efficiency of the mental health 
care sector.

BACKGROUND: The myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) comprises a diverse group of 
haematopoietic stem cell disorders. Due to symptomatic anaemia, most people with 
MDS require supportive therapy including repeated red blood cell (RBC) 
transfusions. In combination with increased iron absorption, this contributes to 
the accumulation of iron resulting in secondary iron overload and the risk of 
organ dysfunction and reduced life expectancy. Since the human body has no 
natural means of removing excess iron, iron chelation therapy, i.e. the 
pharmacological treatment of iron overload, is usually recommended. However, it 
is unclear whether or not the newer oral chelator deferasirox leads to relevant 
benefit.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral deferasirox for 
managing iron overload in people with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to 03 April 2014: 
MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Biosis Previews, Web of Science, Derwent 
Drug File and four trial registries: Current Controlled Trials 
(www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), ICTRP 
(www.who.int./ictrp/en/), and German Clinical Trial Register (www.drks.de).
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing deferasirox 
with no therapy, placebo or with another iron-chelating treatment schedule.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We did not identify any trials eligible for 
inclusion in this review.
MAIN RESULTS: No trials met our inclusion criteria. However, we identified three 
ongoing and one completed trial (published as an abstract only and in 
insufficient detail to permit us to decide on inclusion) comparing deferasirox 
with deferoxamine, placebo or no treatment.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We planned to report evidence from RCTs that evaluated the 
effectiveness of deferasirox compared to either placebo, no treatment or other 
chelating regimens, such as deferoxamine, in people with MDS. However, we did 
not identify any completed RCTs addressing this question.We found three ongoing 
and one completed RCT (published as an abstract only and in insufficient detail) 
comparing deferasirox with deferoxamine, placebo or no treatment and data will 
hopefully be available soon. These results will be important to inform 
physicians and patients on the advantages and disadvantages of this treatment 
option.

The biological interface between an orthopedic implant and the surrounding host 
tissue may have a dramatic effect upon clinical outcome. Desired effects include 
bony ingrowth (osseointegration), stimulation of osteogenesis (osteoinduction), 
increased vascularization, and improved mechanical stability. Implant loosening, 
fibrous encapsulation, corrosion, infection, and inflammation, as well as 
physical mismatch may have deleterious clinical effects. This is particularly 
true of implants used in the reconstruction of load-bearing synovial joints such 
as the knee, hip, and the shoulder. The surfaces of orthopedic implants have 
evolved from solid-smooth to roughened-coarse and most recently, to porous in an 
effort to create a three-dimensional architecture for bone apposition and 
osseointegration. Total joint surgeries are increasingly performed in younger 
individuals with a longer life expectancy, and therefore, the postimplantation 
lifespan of devices must increase commensurately. This review discusses 
advancements in biomaterials science and cell-based therapies that may further 
improve orthopedic success rates. We focus on material and biological properties 
of orthopedic implants fabricated from porous metal and highlight some relevant 
developments in stem-cell research. We posit that the ideal primary and revision 
orthopedic load-bearing metal implants are highly porous and may be chemically 
modified to induce stem cell growth and osteogenic differentiation, while 
minimizing inflammation and infection. We conclude that integration of new 
biological, chemical, and mechanical methods is likely to yield more effective 
strategies to control and modify the implant-bone interface and thereby improve 
long-term clinical outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To compare model input influence on incremental net monetary benefit 
(INMB) across 3 uncertainty methods: 1) 1-way sensitivity analysis; 2) 
probabilistic analysis of covariance (ANCOVA); and 3) expected value of partial 
perfect information (EVPPI).
METHODS: In a preliminary model, we used a published cost-effectiveness model 
and assumed £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) willingness-to-pay 
(Case 1: lower decision uncertainty) and £8000/QALY willingness-to-pay (Case 2: 
higher decision uncertainty). We conducted 1-way sensitivity, ANCOVA (10,000 
Monte Carlo draws), and EVPPI for each model input (1000 inner and 1000 outer 
draws). We ranked inputs based on influence of INMB and compared input ranks 
across methods within case using Spearman's rank correlation. We replicated this 
approach in 3 follow-up models: an additional linear model, a less linear model 
with uncorrelated inputs, and a less linear model with correlated inputs.
RESULTS: In the preliminary model, lower and higher decision uncertainty cases 
had the same top 3 influential parameters across uncertainty methods. The 2 most 
influential inputs contributed 78% and 49% of variation in outcome based on 
ANCOVA for lower decision uncertainty and higher decision uncertainty cases, 
respectively. In the follow-up models, input rank order correlations were higher 
across uncertainty methods in the linear model compared with both of the less 
linear models.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence across models suggests influential input rank agreement 
between 1-way and more advanced uncertainty analyses for relatively linear 
models with uncorrelated parameters but less agreement for less linear models. 
Although each method provides unique information, the additional resources 
needed to generate and communicate advanced analyses should be weighed, 
especially when outcome decision uncertainty is low. For less linear models or 
those with correlated inputs, performing and reporting deterministic and 
probabilistic uncertainty analyses appear prudent and conservative.

A framework for estimating health state utility values within a discrete choice 
experiment: modeling risky choices.

BACKGROUND: There has been recent interest in using the discrete choice 
experiment (DCE) method to derive health state utilities for use in 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) calculations, but challenges remain.
OBJECTIVES: We set out to develop a risk-based DCE approach to derive utility 
values for health states that allowed 1) utility values to be anchored directly 
to normal health and death and 2) worse than dead health states to be assessed 
in the same manner as better than dead states. Furthermore, we set out to 
estimate alternative models of risky choice within a DCE model.
METHOD: A survey was designed that incorporated a risk-based DCE and a 
"modified" standard gamble (SG). Health state utility values were elicited for 3 
EQ-5D health states assuming "standard" expected utility (EU) preferences. The 
DCE model was then generalized to allow for rank-dependent expected utility 
(RDU) preferences, thereby allowing for probability weighting. A convenience 
sample of 60 students was recruited and data collected in small groups.
RESULTS: Under the assumption of "standard" EU preferences, the utility values 
derived within the DCE corresponded fairly closely to the mean results from the 
modified SG. Under the assumption of RDU preferences, the utility values 
estimated are somewhat lower than under the assumption of standard EU, 
suggesting that the latter may be biased upward.
CONCLUSION: Applying the correct model of risky choice is important whether a 
modified SG or a risk-based DCE is deployed. It is, however, possible to 
estimate a probability weighting function within a DCE and estimate "unbiased" 
utility values directly, which is not possible within a modified SG. We conclude 
by setting out the relative strengths and weaknesses of the 2 approaches in this 
context.

AIMS: The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of two 
screening methods for detection of silent AF, intermittent electrocardiogram 
(ECG) recordings using a handheld recording device, at regular time intervals 
for 30 days, and short-term 24 h continuous Holter ECG, in comparison with a 
no-screening alternative in 75-year-old patients with a recent ischaemic stroke.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The long-term (20-year) costs and effects of all 
alternatives were estimated with a decision analytic model combining the result 
of a clinical study and epidemiological data from Sweden. The structure of a 
cost-effectiveness analysis was used in this study. The short-term decision tree 
model analysed the screening procedure until the onset of anticoagulant 
treatment. The second part of the decision model followed a Markov design, 
simulating the patients' health states for 20 years. Continuous 24 h ECG 
recording was inferior to intermittent ECG in terms of cost-effectiveness, due 
to both lower sensitivity and higher costs. The base-case analysis compared 
intermittent ECG screening with no screening of patients with recent stroke. The 
implementation of the screening programme on 1000 patients resulted over a 
20-year period in 11 avoided strokes and the gain of 29 life-years, or 23 
quality-adjusted life years, and cost savings of €55 400.
CONCLUSION: Screening of silent AF by intermittent ECG recordings in patients 
with a recent ischaemic stroke is a cost-effective use of health care resources 
saving costs and lives and improving the quality of life.

Improving piglet survivability rates is of high priority for swine production as 
well as for piglet well-being. Dysfunction in the serotonin (5-HT) system has 
been associated with growth deficiencies, infant mortalities, or failure to 
thrive in human infants. The aim of this research was to determine if a
