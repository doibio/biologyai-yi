OBJECTIVE: Pembrolizumab + chemotherapy substantially extends life expectancy 
for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Its 
cost-effectiveness (CE) was previously evaluated based on interim trial analyses 
(follow-up ∼1 year). The present analysis describes CE incorporating additional 
follow-up based on protocol-specified final trial analyses (1-1.5 years 
additional follow-up), from a US healthcare payer perspective.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model is used to compare 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs chemotherapy using data from the KN189 
(non-squamous patients) and KN407 (squamous patients) clinical trials. An 
indirect treatment comparison vs pembrolizumab monotherapy is made for patient 
subgroups with PD-L1 TPS ≥50% and 1-49% based on data from the KN024 and KN042 
trials. Efficacy, treatment utilization, health utility, and safety data are 
derived from trials and projected over 20 years. Costs for drugs, non-drug 
disease management, and adverse events are also incorporated.
RESULTS: Overall, versus chemotherapy alone, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy is 
projected to increase life expectancy by 1.12 years (3.35 vs 2.23) and 
0.67 years (3.17 vs 2.50) in non-squamous and squamous patients, respectively. 
Resultant ICERs ($158,030/QALY and $178,387/QALY) are below a US 3-times GDP per 
capita threshold ($195,000/QALY). ICERs vs chemotherapy also generally fall 
below the threshold within PD-L1 sub-groups (except in squamous PD-L1 < 1%, 
which may have differed due to small sample size) while ICERs vs pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in PD-L1 ≥ 50% and 1-49% sub-groups generally exceed it (except in 
squamous PD-L1 1-49%); largely a result of the higher drug acquisition cost of 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy relative to differences in life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, with longer-term trial follow-up and in the context 
of prior literature, in the US, one of the two options for pembrolizumab use 
(either pembrolizumab + chemotherapy or pembrolizumab monotherapy), represents a 
cost-effective treatment in virtually all non-squamous and squamous metastatic 
NSCLC patient populations and PD-L1 sub-groups evaluated.

INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer and its etiopathogenesis, the age of women in whom 
it is diagnosed, average life expectancy, and prognosis are information widely 
covered in scientific reports. However, there is no coherent information 
regarding which regions-urban or rural-it may occur more often. This is 
important because the literature on the subject reports that people living in 
rural areas have a worse prognosis when it comes to detection, treatment, and 
life expectancy than city dwellers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The subjects of the study were women and their knowledge 
about cervical cancer. The research was carried out using a survey directly 
distributed among respondents and via the Internet, portals, and discussion 
groups for women from Poland. Three hundred twenty-nine women took part in the 
study, including 164 from rural and 165 from urban areas. The collected data 
enabled the following: (1) an analysis of the studied groups, (2) assessment of 
the respondents' knowledge about cervical cancer, and (3) comparison of women's 
knowledge depending on where they live.
RESULTS: The average assessment of all respondents' knowledge was 3.59, with 
women living in rural areas scoring 3.18 and respondents from the city-4.01. 
Statistical significance (p < 0.001) between the level of knowledge and place of 
residence was determined. The results indicate that an increase in the level of 
education in the subjects significantly increases the chance of getting the 
correct answer. In the case of age analysis, the coefficients indicate a 
decrease in the chance of obtaining the correct answer in older subjects despite 
the fact that a statistically significant level was reached in individual 
questions.
CONCLUSIONS: Women living in rural areas have less knowledge of cervical cancer 
than female respondents from the city. There is a need for more awareness 
campaigns to provide comprehensive information about cervical cancer to women in 
rural areas. A holistic approach to the presented issue can solve existing 
difficulties and barriers to maintaining health regardless of the place of life 
and residence.
IMPLICATION FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: They need intensive care for women's groups 
most burdened with risk factors.

BACKGROUND: The study aims to assess two approaches that apply the empirical 
completeness method to generate age-specific mortality statistics from 
incomplete death registration systems.
METHODS: We use the empirical completeness method to calculate all-age death 
registration completeness, which is used with a model life table to generate 
mortality statistics and age-specific completeness using (1) the conventional 
method and (2) the equivalent deaths method. The results are compared with a 
capture-recapture (C-RC) study and three alternative mortality estimates for 
Brazilian states, and C-RC studies in Thailand, Oman and Vietnam, which 
independently estimate the level and age pattern of mortality or completeness.
RESULTS: The empirical completeness method produces similar estimates of all-age 
completeness of registration to the C-RC studies. Compared with C-RC studies, at 
15-59 years, the conventional method's estimates of mortality and completeness 
are more concordant, while at 60-84 years the equivalent death method's 
estimates are closer. Estimates of life expectancy from the two approaches each 
have similar concordance with the C-RC studies. For male adult mortality 
in Brazilian states, there is relatively strong average correlation of this 
study's estimates with three alternative estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: The two approaches produce mortality statistics from incomplete 
data that are mostly concordant with C-RC studies, and can be most usefully 
applied to subnational populations.

INTRODUCTION: Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is critical for identifying 
high-value interventions that address significant unmet need. This study 
examines whether CEA study volume is proportionate to the burden associated with 
21 major disease categories.
METHODS: We searched the Tufts Medical Center CEA and Global Health CEA 
Registries for studies published between 2010 and 2019 that measured cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year or cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY). 
Stratified by geographical region and country income level, the relationship 
between literature volume and disease burden (as measured by 2019 Global Burden 
of Disease estimates of population DALYs) was analysed using ordinary least 
squares linear regression. Additionally, the number of CEAs per intervention 
deemed 'essential' for universal health coverage by the Disease Control 
Priorities Network was assessed to evaluate how many interventions are supported 
by cost-effectiveness evidence.
RESULTS: The results located below the regression line but with relatively high 
burden suggested disease areas that were 'understudied' compared with expected 
study volume. Understudied disease areas varied by region. Higher-income and 
upper-middle-income country (HUMIC) CEA volume for non-communicable diseases 
(eg, mental/behavioural disorders) was 100-fold higher than that in low-income 
and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs). LLMIC study volume remained 
concentrated in HIV/AIDS as well as other communicable and neglected tropical 
diseases. Across 60 essential interventions, only 33 had any supporting CEA 
evidence, and only 21 had a decision context involving a low-income or 
middle-income country. With the exception of one intervention, available CEA 
evidence revealed the 21 interventions to be cost-effective, with base-case 
findings less than three times the GDP per capita.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis highlights disease areas that require significant 
policy attention. Research gaps for highly prevalent, lethal or disabling 
diseases, as well as essential interventions may be stifling potential 
efficiency gains. Large research disparities between HUMICs and LLMICs suggest 
funding opportunities for improving allocative efficiency in LLMIC health 
systems.

Despite recent success in computational design of structured cyclic peptides, de 
novo design of cyclic peptides that bind to any protein functional site remains 
difficult. To address this challenge, we develop a computational "anchor 
extension" methodology for targeting protein interfaces by extending a peptide 
chain around a non-canonical amino acid residue anchor. To test our approach 
using a well characterized model system, we design cyclic peptides that inhibit 
histone deacetylases 2 and 6 (HDAC2 and HDAC6) with enhanced potency compared to 
the original anchor (IC50 values of 9.1 and 4.4 nM for the best binders compared 
to 5.4 and 0.6 µM for the anchor, respectively). The HDAC6 inhibitor is among 
the most potent reported so far. These results highlight the potential for de 
novo design of high-affinity protein-peptide interfaces, as well as the 
challenges that remain.

To assess the utility of autofluorescence as a noninvasive biomarker of 
senescence in Caenorhabditis elegans, we measured the autofluorescence of 
individual nematodes using spectrofluorometry. The fluorescence of each worm 
increased with age. Animals with lower fluorescence intensity exhibited longer 
life expectancy. When proteins extracted from worms were incubated with sugars, 
the fluorescence intensity and the concentration of advanced glycation end 
products (AGEs) increased over time. Ribose enhanced these changes not only in 
vitro but also in vivo. The glycation blocker rifampicin suppressed this rise in 
fluorescence. High-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that vitellogenins 
accumulated in old worms, and glycated vitellogenins emitted six-fold higher 
fluorescence than naive vitellogenins. The increase in fluorescence with ageing 
originates from glycated substances, and therefore could serve as a useful 
noninvasive biomarker of AGEs. C. elegans can serve as a new model to look for 
anti-AGE factors and to study the relationship between AGEs and senescence.

Metabolism influences locomotor behaviors, but the understanding of neural 
curcuit control for that is limited. Under standard light-dark cycles, 
Drosophila exhibits bimodal morning (M) and evening (E) locomotor activities 
that are controlled by clock neurons. Here, we showed that a high-nutrient diet 
progressively extended M activity but not E activity. Drosophila tachykinin 
(DTk) and Tachykinin-like receptor at 86C (TkR86C)-mediated signaling was 
required for the extension of M activity. DTk neurons were anatomically and 
functionally connected to the posterior dorsal neuron 1s (DN1ps) in the clock 
neuronal network. The activation of DTk neurons reduced intracellular Ca2+ 
levels in DN1ps suggesting an inhibitory connection. The contacts between DN1ps 
and DTk neurons increased gradually over time in flies fed a high-sucrose diet, 
consistent with the locomotor behavior. DN1ps have been implicated in 
integrating environmental sensory inputs (e.g., light and temperature) to 
control daily locomotor behavior. This study revealed that DN1ps also 
coordinated nutrient information through DTk signaling to shape daily locomotor 
behavior.

INTRODUCTION: The effectiveness of nivolumab plus ipilimumab with two cycles of 
chemotherapy (NIC) for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been 
demonstrated. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of NIC for advanced 
NSCLC from the US payer perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model has been established to predict the disease course of 
previously untreated advanced NSCLC. The clinical data were derived from the 
CheckMate 9LA trial. Cost and utility were obtained from the literature. Model 
outputs included the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), incremental 
monetary benefit (INMB), and incremental net-health benefit (INHB). A series of 
sensitivity analyses were performed to analyze the uncertainty of the model.
RESULTS: Our results showed that NIC versus chemotherapy alone cost $264,278 and 
yielded an additional 0.80 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), which led to an 
ICER of $202,275/QALY gained. The INHB was - 0.28 QALY, and the INMB was - 
$41,865 at the threshold of $150,000/QALY. The results of one-way sensitivity 
analysis showed that the hazard ratio of overall survival was the most sensitive 
parameter.
CONCLUSION: NIC was unlikely to be cost-effective as a first-line treatment for 
patients with advanced NSCLC.

Working life expectancies among individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes over 
a 30-year period.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to (i) estimate working life expectancies (WLE) and 
the number of working years lost (WYL) among individuals with type 1 and type 2 
diabetes over a 30-year period and (ii) identify educational differences in WLE 
and WYL.
METHODS: Individuals aged 18-65 years diagnosed with type 1 (N=33 188) or type 2 
diabetes (N=81 930) in 2000-2016 and age- and gender-matched controls without 
diabetes (N=663 656) were identified in Danish national registers. WLE in years 
were estimated as time in employment from age 35-65 years. We used a life-table 
approach with multi-state (eg, disability pension, sickness absence, 
unemployment) Cox proportional hazard modeling. Analyses were performed 
separately for sex, cohabitation status, educational duration, and type of 
diabetes. Inverse probability weights accounted for differences between 
populations.
RESULTS: People with diabetes had significantly shorter WLE and greater WYL 
compared to people without diabetes over the 30-year span. At age 35, cohabitant 
women with lower education and diabetes lost up to 8.0 years [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 5.0-11.0] and men 7.0 years (95% CI 4.0-8.7). WYL among women with 
higher education was 4.4 (95% CI 6.6-2.3) and 3.7 years among men (95% CI 
1.5-4.5). Compared to people with type 2 diabetes, those with type 1 spend 
significantly more years in disability pension, but there were no significant 
differences in the other WYL estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: The WYL among people with diabetes is substantial and characterized 
by social disparities. The WYL help identify intervention targets at different 
ages, types of diabetes, sex, educational and cohabitant status.

AIM: Up-to-date epidemiological studies on the global burden of severe 
periodontitis is scarce. This study aimed to present the latest estimates for 
prevalence of severe periodontitis from 1990 to 2019, by region, age, and level 
of socio-demographic development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Estimates from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019 
were used to investigate burden and trends of prevalence of severe periodontitis 
and its association with socio-demographic development at global, regional, and 
national level. Decomposition analysis was performed to explore the contribution 
of demographic and epidemiological factors to the evolving burden of severe 
periodontitis.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 1.1 billion (95% uncertainty interval: 0.8-1.4 
billion) prevalent cases of severe periodontitis globally. From 1990 to 2019, 
age-standardized prevalence rate of severe periodontitis increased by 8.44% 
(6.62%-10.59%) worldwide. Prevalence of severe periodontitis is higher among 
less developed countries/regions. Global population growth accounted for 67.9% 
of the increase in the number of prevalent cases of severe periodontitis from 
1990 to 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The global burden of severe periodontitis has been substantial and 
increasing over the past three decades. Upstream policy changes are urgently 
needed to address the global public health challenge of severe periodontitis.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of 
olokizumab (OKZ), an anti-interleukin (IL)-6 monoclonal antibody, in patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inadequate response to tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha inhibitors.
METHODS: Eligible patients completed study RA0056, which tested several doses of 
OKZ, placebo (PBO), and tocilizumab (TCZ) plus methotrexate (MTX) in Western 
countries, and RA0083 included several doses of OKZ and PBO plus MTX in Asian 
countries. Both studies were followed by open-label extension (OLE) studies with 
OKZ 120 mg every 2 weeks, RA0057 and RA0089, respectively. Safety assessments 
were reported up to 124 weeks in RA0057 and 92 weeks in RA0089. Efficacy 
assessments were reported up to week 60 in RA0057 and week 52 in RA0089. No 
formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed, and missing data were not 
imputed.
RESULTS: A total of 190 patients in RA0057 and 103 patients in RA0089 received 
OKZ with median treatment duration of 14.1 and 10.1 months, respectively. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 44 patients (23.2%, 32.7 events 
per 100 patient-years [PY]) in RA0057 and in 13 patients (12.6%, 23.6 events per 
100 PY) in RA0089. Among treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including 
SAEs, infections were the most common events. TEAEs leading to withdrawal were 
reported in 33 (17.4%) patients in RA0057 and in 7 (6.8%) patients in RA0089. 
Disease activity score 28-joint count on the basis of C-reactive protein level, 
clinical disease activity index, and simplified disease activity index, as well 
as the American College of Rheumatology 20%, 50%, and 70% response rates were 
maintained during the OLE studies, including in those who switched from PBO or 
TCZ. Improvements in patient-reported outcomes were maintained in OLEs as well.
CONCLUSION: In the 2 long-term studies, OKZ treatment demonstrated a safety 
profile expected for IL-6 blocking agents without new safety signals and led to 
sustained improvements in RA symptoms, physical function, and quality of life.

Mild Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia, accounting for 50-70% 
of cases. Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease, 
which affects daily life activities and social functioning. As life expectancy 
increases and demographic ageing occurs, the global prevalence of Alzheimer's 
disease is expected to continue to rise especially in developing countries, 
leading to a costly burden of disease. Alzheimer's disease is a complex and 
multifactorial disorder that is determined by the interaction of genetic 
susceptibility and environmental factors across the life course. Epidemiological 
studies have identified potential modifiable risk and protective factors for 
Alzheimer's disease prevention. Moreover, Alzheimer's disease is considered to 
start decades earlier before clinical symptoms occur, thus interventions 
targeting several risk factors in non-demented elderly people even middle-aged 
population might prevent or delay Alzheimer's disease onset. Here, we provide an 
overview of current epidemiological advances related to Alzheimer's disease 
modifiable risk factors, highlighting the concept of early prevention.

BACKGROUND: To examine overall survival rates within a large cohort of German 
prostate cancer (PCa) patients and to compare these with life-expectancy (LE) 
predictions derived from German life tables. We hypothesized that the advantage 
of good general health in radical prostatectomy (RP) patients combined with 
favorable cancer outcomes might lead to even higher overall survival rates over 
10 years compared to the LE of a general population.
METHODS: A total of 6483 patients were treated with RP between 1992 and 2007 at 
the Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center. Preoperative risk classification was 
performed according to D'Amico. Postoperative risk classification was performed 
according to the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score (CAPRA-S). A 
simulated cohort was created that resembled the exact age distribution of the RP 
population using Monte Carlo simulation which was based on data derived from 
official male German life tables (1992-2017). Markov chain was used to represent 
natural age progression of the simulated cohort. Kaplan-Meier plots were created 
to display the differences between 10-year observed overall survival (OS) and 
the simulated, predicted LE.
RESULTS: For D'Amico low risk and intermediate risk, 10-year OS was 12.0% and 
9.2% above predicted LE in the simulated cohort, respectively. For D'Amico high 
risk, OS was virtually the same as predicted LE (0.8% difference in favor of RP 
treated patients). For CAPRA-S low and intermediate risk, OS was 11.8% and 9.7% 
above predicted LE. For CAPRA-S high risk, OS was virtually the same as 
predicted LE (0.3% difference in favor of the simulated cohort).
CONCLUSIONS: Low- and intermediate risk PCa patients treated with RP can expect 
a very favorable overall survival, that even exceeds LE predictions. High risk 
patients' overall survival perfectly aligns with LE predictions.

Non-communicable diseases, including diabetes, are partly responsible for the 
deceleration of improvements of life expectancy in many countries. Diabetes is 
also associated with sleep disturbances. Our aim was to determine whether sleep 
disturbances, particularly in people with diabetes, were associated with 
increased mortality risk. Data from the UK Biobank were analysed (n = 487,728, 
mean follow-up time = 8.9 years). The primary exposure was sleep disturbances, 
assessed through the question: Do you have trouble falling asleep at night or do 
you wake up in the middle of the night? The primary outcome was mortality. We 
also dichotomized sleep disturbances into "never/sometimes" versus "usually" 
(frequently), and combined with the presence/absence of diabetes: 24.2% of 
participants reported "never/rarely" experiencing sleep disturbances, 47.8% 
"sometimes" and 28.0% "usually". In age- and sex-adjusted models, frequent sleep 
disturbances were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-1.37), which 
remained significant in the fully adjusted model (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.09-1.18). 
The presence of both diabetes and frequent sleep disturbances was associated 
with greater risk of all-cause mortality than either condition alone. In the 
fully adjusted model, the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.11 (95% CI, 
1.07-1.15) for frequent sleep disturbances alone, 1.67 (95% CI, 1.57-1.76) for 
diabetes alone and 1.87 for both (95% CI, 1.75-2.01). Frequent sleep 
disturbances (experienced by more than one quarter of the sample) were 
associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Mortality risk was 
highest in those with both diabetes and frequent sleep disturbances. Complaints 
of difficulty falling or staying asleep merit attention by physicians.

BACKGROUND: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of stratified care demonstrated 
superior clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness for low back pain (LBP) 
patients in UK primary care. This is the first study in Europe, outside of the 
original UK study, to investigate the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness 
of stratified care compared with current practice for patients with non-specific 
LBP.
METHODS: The study was a two-armed RCT. Danish primary care patients with LBP 
were randomized to stratified care (n = 169) or current practice (n = 164). 
Primary outcomes at 3- and 12-months' follow-up were Roland Morris Disability 
Questionnaire (RDMQ), patient-reported global change and time off work. 
Secondary outcomes included pain intensity, patient satisfaction, healthcare 
resource utilization and quality-adjusted life years.
RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses found no between-group difference in RMDQ 
scores at 3 months (0.5, 95% CI -1.8 to 0.9) or 12 months (0.4, -2.1 to 1.3). No 
overall differences were found between the arms at 3 and 12 months with respect 
to time off work or secondary outcomes. Stratified care intervention resulted in 
significantly fewer treatment sessions (3.5 [SD 3.1] vs. 4.5 [3.5]) and 
significantly lower total healthcare costs (€) (13.4 [529] vs. 228 [830], 
p = .002). There was no difference in cost-effectiveness (0.09, 0.05 to 0.13 vs. 
0.10, 0.07-0.14, p = .70).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes between 
patients with non-specific LBP receiving stratified care and those receiving 
current practice. However, stratified care may reduce total healthcare costs if 
implemented in Danish primary care.
SIGNIFICANCE: Stratified care for low back pain based on risk profile is 
recommended by recent evidence based clinical guidelines. This study is the 
first broad replication of the STarT Back Trial in Europe. Therefore, the study 
adds to the body of knowledge evaluating the effectiveness of stratified care 
for low back pain in primary care, and provides insight into the effects of 
stratification on clinical practice.

The optimal management of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) is 
the subject of extensive debate. According to the 2017 European Society for 
Vascular Surgery guidelines, carotid endarterectomy should (Class IIa; Level of 
Evidence: B) or carotid artery stenting may be considered (Class IIb; Level of 
Evidence: B) in the presence of one or more clinical/imaging characteristics 
that may be associated with an increased risk of late ipsilateral stroke (e.g., 
silent embolic infarcts on brain computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, 
progression in the severity of ACS, a history of contralateral transient 
ischemic attack/stroke, microemboli detection on transcranial Doppler, etc.), 
provided documented perioperative stroke/death rates are <3% and the patient's 
life expectancy is >5 years. Besides these clinical/imaging characteristics, 
there are additional individual, ethnic/racial or social factors that should 
probably be evaluated in the decision process regarding the optimal management 
of these patients, such as individual patient needs/patient choice, patient 
compliance with best medical treatment, patient sex, culture, race/ethnicity, 
age and comorbidities, as well as improvements in imaging/operative 
techniques/outcomes. The present multispecialty position paper will present the 
rationale why the management of patients with ACS may need to be individualized.

OBJECTIVES: Few studies in China have focused on the economic evaluation of 
newborn screening (NBS) for inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) by tandem mass 
spectrometry (MS/MS). This study assesses the total costs, benefits, 
benefit-cost ratio (BCR), cost-utility ratio (CUR) and incremental cost-utility 
ratio (ICUR) of NBS using MS/MS compared to the non-screened group.
METHODS: The NBS outcomes of newborns who underwent MS/MS screening for IMDs in 
2009-2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Records were extracted from a screening 
management system at the NBS Center of Zhejiang province. A cost-benefit 
analysis of screening was conducted, assessing screening costs for each subject, 
and direct and indirect treatment costs for IMDs detected by screening. The 
putative benefit of clinical outcomes related to early diagnosis was assumed to 
be improvement in quality of life and prolonged life expectancy in the screened 
group, as compared to the non-screened group.
RESULTS: Of the 3,040,815 newborns screened, 735 (2.86%) cases were diagnosed 
through gene sequence analysis. The most frequently occurring types of IMD were 
amino acid disorders (n = 276), then fatty acid oxidation disorders (n = 248), 
followed by organic acidaemias (n = 211). The difference in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) ranged from 0.78 to 15.4 in the screened group. The CUR was 
CNY¥ 116,183.89/QALY in the screened group and CNY¥ 3,078,823.65/QALY in the 
non-screened group. The ICUR was CNY¥ -768,428.76/QALY, and the BCR was 6.09.
CONCLUSIONS: NBS using MS/MS can be considered cost-effective in China. The 
nationwide promotion of NBS using MS/MS deserves priority consideration and 
sufficient publicity.

Neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), 
stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), 
epilepsy, traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression, and anxiety are responsible 
for thousands of deaths worldwide every year. With the increase in life 
expectancy, there has been a rise in the prevalence of these disorders. Age is 
one of the major risk factors for these neurological disorders, and with the 
aged population set to rise to 1.25 billion by 2050, there is a growing concern 
to look for new therapeutic molecules to treat age-related diseases. Caffeic 
acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a molecule obtained from a number of botanical 
sources, such as the bark of conifer trees as well as propolis which is 
extracted from beehives. Though CAPE remains relatively unexplored in human 
trials, it possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimitogenic, and 
anti-cancer activities, as shown by preclinical studies. Apart from this, it 
also exhibits tremendous potential for the treatment of neurological disorders 
through the modulation of multiple molecular pathways and attenuation of 
behavioural deficits. In the present article, we have reviewed the therapeutic 
potential of CAPE and its mechanisms in the treatment of neurological disorders.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab/lenvatinib (P/L) 
versus standard-of-care carboplatin/paclitaxel (C/T) as first-line systemic 
therapy for patients with advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer.
METHODS: We designed a Markov model to simulate treatment outcomes for 
advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer patients whose tumors are either 
microsatellite stable (MSS) or have high microsatellite instability (MSI-high). 
We adopted a healthcare sector perspective for the analysis. Model inputs for 
costs, health utility, and clinical estimates were obtained from the literature 
including data from GOG0209 and KEYNOTE-146. Primary outcomes included costs of 
care, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The time-horizon was three years and the 
discount rate was 3% annually.
RESULTS: In a MSS cohort, compared to C/T, first-line treatment with P/L 
increased treatment costs by $212,670 and decreased QALYs by 0.28 per patient. 
In a MSI-high cohort, compared to C/T, P/L increased costs by $313,487 and 
increased QALYs by 0.11 per patient, representing an ICER of $2,849,882 per 
QALY. Sensitivity analyses found that the price of the new drugs was the most 
important determinant of the ICER and that the price of the new drugs would need 
to decrease by 85% to $2817 per cycle to reach a $150,000/QALY threshold.
CONCLUSION: In the MSS model, we found that first-line therapy for advanced or 
recurrent endometrial cancer with P/L increased costs and worsened outcomes 
compared to C/T. In the MSI-high model, P/L improved survival and QALYs compared 
to C/T but was not cost-effective at the current cost of the drugs.
