Previously established predictors of survival may no longer apply in the current 
era of cystic fibrosis (CF) care. Our objective was to identify risk factors 
associated with survival in a contemporary CF population. We used the Canadian 
CF Registry, a population-based cohort, to calculate median age of survival and 
summarise patient characteristics from 1990 to 2012. Clinical, demographic and 
geographical factors, and survival were estimated for a contemporary cohort 
(2000-2012) using Cox proportional hazards models. There were 5787 individuals 
in the registry between 1990 and 2012. Median survival age increased from 31.9 
years (95% CI 28.3-35.2 years) in 1990 to 49.7 years (95% CI 46.1-52.2 years) in 
the most current 5-year window ending in 2012. Median forced expiratory volume 
in 1 s improved (p=0.04) and fewer subjects were malnourished (p<0.001) over 
time. Malnourished patients (hazard ratio (HR) 2.1, 95% CI 1.6-2.8), those with 
multiple exacerbations (HR 4.5, 95% CI 3.2-6.4) and women with CF-related 
diabetes (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7) were at increased risk of death. Life 
expectancy in Canadians with CF is increasing. Modifiable risk factors such as 
malnutrition and pulmonary exacerbations are associated with an increased risk 
of death. The sex gap in CF survival may be explained by an increased hazard for 
death in women with CF-related diabetes.

Valuing Stillbirths.

Phillips J, Millum J.

Estimates of the burden of disease assess the mortality and morbidity that 
affect a population by producing summary measures of health such as 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). 
These measures typically do not include stillbirths (fetal deaths occurring 
during the later stages of pregnancy or during labor) among the negative health 
outcomes they count. Priority-setting decisions that rely on these measures are 
therefore likely to place little value on preventing the more than three million 
stillbirths that occur annually worldwide. In contrast, neonatal deaths, which 
occur in comparable numbers, have a substantial impact on burden of disease 
estimates and are commonly seen as a pressing health concern. In this article we 
argue in favor of incorporating unintended fetal deaths that occur late in 
pregnancy into estimates of the burden of disease. Our argument is based on the 
similarity between late-term fetuses and newborn infants and the assumption that 
protecting newborns is important. We respond to four objections to counting 
stillbirths: (1) that fetuses are not yet part of the population and so their 
deaths should not be included in measures of population health; (2) that valuing 
the prevention of stillbirths will undermine women's reproductive rights; (3) 
that including stillbirths implies that miscarriages (fetal deaths early in 
pregnancy) should also be included; and (4) that birth itself is in fact 
ethically significant. We conclude that our proposal is ethically preferable to 
current practice and, if adopted, is likely to lead to improved decisions about 
health spending.

Anterior translation and rotational stability of anterior cruciate 
ligament-deficient knees during walking: speed and turning direction.

Republic of Korea.

BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is one of the most common 
injuries associated with the knee. After ACL injury, knee joint stability can be 
altered, resulting in abnormal loading during functional activities. Since 
ACL-deficient (ACLD) knees are also vulnerable to translational and rotational 
instability, patients need to be wary of certain motions encountered in daily 
life. The present study investigated the effect of walking speed and pivoting 
directional change during gait on knee joint kinematics of ACLD knees. We 
hypothesized that faster walking and crossover turning would induce severe 
kinematic changes.
METHODS: Thirty-five patients (22 males and 13 females) having a unilateral 
isolated subacute ACLD knee (from 1 to 3 months after injury) and contralateral 
intact (CLI) knee participated in this study. Spatiotemporal parameters, 
three-dimensional (3D) knee joint angles, and anterior-posterior (AP) 
translation were obtained by a 3D high-speed motion-capturing system. The CLI 
knee of each patient served as the control. The calculated AP stability and knee 
joint angles were used to test the research hypothesis. Mixed two-way repeated 
measures analysis of variance was performed to clarify the effects of walking 
speed and pivoting direction with a significance of 0.05. When a significance of 
mean comparison was detected, a post hoc test was performed.
RESULTS: Significant and consistent increased AP translation of the tibia 
relative to the femur at the whole stance phase of the gait cycle was evident in 
ACLD knees compared to CLI knees for normal and faster (20 % greater than 
normal) walking speeds. Faster walking speed did not induce significantly more 
anterior location of the tibia. In addition, ACLD knees were significantly less 
extended than CLI knees during a large portion of midstance. Although there was 
a consistent varus offset between the curves of ACLD and CLI knees, the 
difference did not reach statistical significance during the stance phase. Also, 
ACLD knees did not show any significant difference in tibial rotation compared 
to CLI knees during the entire stance phase of the gait cycle. For pivoting 
turns, ACLD knees showed significantly less extended and varus offset than CLI 
knees only during the cutting turn. ACLD knees exhibited less tibial internal 
rotation during the crossover turn and less tibial external rotation during the 
cutting turn than CLI knees.
CONCLUSIONS: In ACLD knees, the tibia tended to shift more anteriorly and 
changed with less extension at walking. However, faster walking speed did not 
induce any significant difference compared with normal-speed walking. In 
addition, ACLD knees displayed kinematic changes during pivoting, but not the 
crossover turn.

BACKGROUND: Smoking reduces life years in good health but it is unclear how 
education modifies the impact of smoking. We hypothesize that the vulnerability 
of the effect of smoking on health expectancy decreases with educational level 
in both genders and examine the contributions of mortality and health effects.
METHODS: Life tables by educational level and smoking category were constructed 
from registers and survey data. For each educational level, difference in 
expected lifetime in self-rated good and poor health between 30-year-old never 
smokers and smokers were estimated and decomposed into contributions from 
mortality and health status.
RESULTS: Difference in expected lifetime in good health between never smokers 
and smokers decreased with educational level for women but increased for men. 
Thus, the differences between never smokers and heavy smokers among 30-year-old 
women with a low, medium and high educational level were 12.9, 8.9 and 4.1 
years, respectively. In contrast, the differences between male never smokers and 
heavy smokers with a low, medium and high educational level were 10.3, 11.4 and 
14.3 years, respectively. Regardless of educational level, the mortality effect 
increased by exposure to smoking but the effect of health status increased by 
educational level for men and decreased for women.
CONCLUSION: The social differential vulnerability to the effect of smoking 
differed between genders. Thus, whereas smoking had a substantial effect on 
health among women with a low educational level the pattern for men was opposite 
because the health gain for never smokers was greatest for men with a high 
education.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a serious public health problem, the prevalence of which 
is increasing dramatically all over the world. The aim of this study was to 
examine trends in body mass index (BMI) and the proportion of overweight and 
obese individuals among 19-year-old Polish males reporting for mandatory 
military fitness exams from 1965 to 2010.
METHODS: Height, weight and BMI [weight (kg)/height (m(2))] in five 10% 
nationwide random samples of 19-year-old conscripts examined in 1965, 1986, 
1995, 2001 and 2010 were analysed.
RESULTS: From 1965 to 2010, mean BMI in 19-year-old Polish males increased from 
21.7 to 22.9. The rate of change was not uniform, with a rapid increase in mean 
BMI from 1995 to 2010. Beginning in 1965, the proportion of men with a BMI over 
25 has been steadily increasing from one decade to the next, and was four times 
higher in 2010 than it was in 1965. The rate of increase per decade was twice as 
high from 2001 to 2010 than it was from 1995 to 2001. In 2010, only 70.8% of 
young men were of ideal weight.
CONCLUSION: Increase in obesity can be attributed to the social and economic 
changes brought about by the transformation of the country from a communist to a 
free-market economy in 1989. The challenges of the obesity epidemic for public 
health services and its impact on morbidity and life expectancy are also 
discussed.

Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is one of the nodal points that need to be 
preserved to retain physiologic cellular/organismal balance. The 
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for the removal of both normal 
and damaged proteins, with the proteasome being the downstream effector. The 
proteasome is the major cellular protease with progressive impairment of 
function during aging and senescence. Despite the documented age-retarding 
properties of proteasome activation in various cellular models, simultaneous 
enhancement of the 20S core proteasome content, assembly, and function have 
never been reported in any multicellular organism. Consequently, the possible 
effects of the core proteasome modulation on organismal life span are elusive. 
In this study, we have achieved activation of the 20S proteasome at organismal 
level. We demonstrate enhancement of proteasome levels, assembly, and activity 
in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, resulting in life span extension and 
increased resistance to stress. We also provide evidence that the observed life 
span extension is dependent on the transcriptional activity of Dauer formation 
abnormal/Forkhead box class O (DAF-16/FOXO), skinhead-1 (SKN-1), and heat shock 
factor-1 (HSF-1) factors through regulation of downstream longevity genes. We 
further show that the reported beneficial effects are not ubiquitous but they 
are dependent on the genetic context. Finally, we provide evidence that 
proteasome core activation might be a potential strategy to minimize protein 
homeostasis deficiencies underlying aggregation-related diseases, such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Huntington's disease (HD). In summary, this is the 
first report demonstrating that 20S core proteasome up-regulation in terms of 
both content and activity is feasible in a multicellular eukaryotic organism and 
that in turn this modulation promotes extension of organismal health span and 
life span.

Existence of cellular structures with specific size raises a fundamental 
question in biology: How do cells measure length? One conceptual answer to this 
question is by a molecular ruler, but examples of such rulers in eukaryotes are 
lacking. In this work, we identified a molecular ruler in eukaryotic cilia and 
flagella. Using cryo-electron tomography, we found that FAP59 and FAP172 form a 
96-nanometer (nm)-long complex in Chlamydomonas flagella and that the absence of 
the complex disrupted 96-nm repeats of axonemes. Furthermore, lengthening of the 
FAP59/172 complex by domain duplication resulted in extension of the repeats up 
to 128 nm, as well as duplication of specific axonemal components. Thus, the 
FAP59/172 complex is the molecular ruler that determines the 96-nm repeat length 
and arrangements of components in cilia and flagella.

OBJECTIVES: To conduct two economic analyses addressing whether to: routinely 
monitor HIV-infected children on antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinically or with 
laboratory tests; continue or stop cotrimoxazole prophylaxis when children 
become stabilized on ART.
DESIGN AND METHODS: The ARROW randomized trial investigated alternative 
strategies to deliver paediatric ART and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in 1206 
Ugandan/Zimbabwean children. Incremental cost-effectiveness and value of 
implementation analyses were undertaken. Scenario analyses investigated whether 
laboratory monitoring (CD4 tests for efficacy monitoring; 
haematology/biochemistry for toxicity) could be tailored and targeted to be 
delivered cost-effectively. Cotrimoxazole use was examined in malaria-endemic 
and non-endemic settings.
RESULTS: Using all trial data, clinical monitoring delivered similar health 
outcomes to routine laboratory monitoring, but at a reduced cost, so was 
cost-effective. Continuing cotrimoxazole improved health outcomes at reduced 
costs. Restricting routine CD4 monitoring to after 52 weeks following ART 
initiation and removing toxicity testing was associated with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $6084 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) across 
all age groups, but was much lower for older children (12+ years at initiation; 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $769/QALY). Committing resources to 
improve cotrimoxazole implementation appears cost-effective. A healthcare system 
that could pay $600/QALY should be willing to spend up to $12.0 per patient-year 
to ensure continued provision of cotrimoxazole.
CONCLUSION: Clinically driven monitoring of ART is cost-effective in most 
circumstances. Routine laboratory monitoring is generally not cost-effective at 
current prices, except possibly CD4 testing amongst adolescents initiating ART. 
Committing resources to ensure continued provision of cotrimoxazole in health 
facilities is more likely to represent an efficient use of resources.

Landscape classification and hydrological regionalisation studies are being 
increasingly used in ecohydrology to aid in the management and research of 
aquatic resources. We present a methodology for classifying hydrologic 
landscapes based on spatial environmental variables by employing non-parametric 
statistics and hybrid image classification. Our approach differed from previous 
classifications which have required the use of an a priori spatial unit (e.g. a 
catchment) which necessarily results in the loss of variability that is known to 
exist within those units. The use of a simple statistical approach to identify 
an appropriate number of classes eliminated the need for large amounts of 
post-hoc testing with different number of groups, or the selection and 
justification of an arbitrary number. Using statistical clustering, we 
identified 23 distinct groups within our training dataset. The use of a hybrid 
classification employing random forests extended this statistical clustering to 
an area of approximately 228,000 km2 of south-eastern Australia without the need 
to rely on catchments, landscape units or stream sections. This extension 
resulted in a highly accurate regionalisation at both 30-m and 2.5-km 
resolution, and a less-accurate 10-km classification that would be more 
appropriate for use at a continental scale. A smaller case study, of an area 
covering 27,000 km2, demonstrated that the method preserved the intra- and 
inter-catchment variability that is known to exist in local hydrology, based on 
previous research. Preliminary analysis linking the regionalisation to 
streamflow indices is promising suggesting that the method could be used to 
predict streamflow behaviour in ungauged catchments. Our work therefore 
simplifies current classification frameworks that are becoming more popular in 
ecohydrology, while better retaining small-scale variability in hydrology, thus 
enabling future attempts to explain and visualise broad-scale hydrologic trends 
at the scale of catchments and continents.

INTRODUCTION: HIV/AIDS is now a global epidemic that has become the leading 
infectious killer of adults worldwide. Although antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has 
dramatically improved the quality of life and increased the life expectancy of 
those infected with HIV but frequency of dosing and drug toxicity as well as the 
development of viral resistance pose additional limitations. The rapidly 
expanding field of nanotechnology has vast potential to radically advance the 
treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS. Nanoparticles can provide improved drug 
delivery, by virtue of their small size, robustness, safety, multimodality or 
multifunctionality.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Since HIV primarily infects CD4+ cells; we aim to use CD4 
as a selectable target to deliver a pro-apoptotic protein to HIV-infected cells 
using nanoparticles as carriers. The aim of study was to develop a 
nanotechnology-based death inducing delivery system for the destruction of 
CD4+HIV infected cells through the activation of caspase-3.
METHODOLOGY: A modified caspase-3 protein (Mut-3) was engineered, which is 
cleavable only by HIV-1 protease. Mut-3 can activate apoptosis in the presence 
of HIV-1 protease, consequently killing HIV-positive cells. Mut-3 protein was 
conjugated to gold nanoparticles together with a CD4-targeting peptide. The 
efficacy of the gold nanoparticles was tested on CHO cells that were genetically 
engineered to express GFP labelled CD4 and HIV-1 protease.
RESULTS: Mut-3 was expressed in bacterial cells and purified. CHO cells that 
stably over express CD4-GFP and HIV-1 protease were selected using Fluorescence 
Activated Cell Sorting. Dose response cell culture experiments showed that gold 
nanoparticles without Mut-3 and CD4-targeting peptide did not induce cell death 
in CHO cells, while gold nanoparticles that was conjugated with Mut-3 and the 
CD4-targeting peptide rapidly induced cell death in CHO cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that gold nanoparticles conjugated with Mut-3 
and a CD4-targeting peptide could potentially induce apoptosis in HIV-infected 
cells.

BACKGROUND: We examined efficacy, toxicity, relapse, cost, and quality-of-life 
thresholds of hypothetical HIV cure interventions that would make them 
cost-effective compared to life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART).
METHODS: We used a computer simulation model to assess three HIV cure 
strategies: Gene Therapy, Chemotherapy, and Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT), 
each compared to ART. Efficacy and cost parameters were varied widely in 
sensitivity analysis. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life expectancy, 
lifetime cost, and cost-effectiveness in dollars/quality-adjusted life year 
($/QALY) gained. Strategies were deemed cost-effective with incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios <$100,000/QALY.
RESULTS: For patients on ART, discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy was 
16.4 years and lifetime costs were $591,400. Gene Therapy was cost-effective 
with efficacy of 10%, relapse rate 0.5%/month, and cost $54,000. Chemotherapy 
was cost-effective with efficacy of 88%, relapse rate 0.5%/month, and cost 
$12,400/month for 24 months. At $150,000/procedure, SCT was cost-effective with 
efficacy of 79% and relapse rate 0.5%/month. Moderate efficacy increases and 
cost reductions made Gene Therapy cost-saving, but substantial efficacy/cost 
changes were needed to make Chemotherapy or SCT cost-saving.
CONCLUSIONS: Depending on efficacy, relapse rate, and cost, cure strategies 
could be cost-effective compared to current ART and potentially cost-saving. 
These results may help provide performance targets for developing cure 
strategies for HIV.

This special issue of the American Journal of Occupational Therapy includes 
summaries from a systematic evidence-based literature review of occupational 
therapy and driving and community mobility for older adults. Since the previous 
review on this topic in 2008, the cohort of 78 million baby boomers began 
turning 65 in January 2011. As a group, this cohort is more likely to have 
longer life expectancy, stay in the workforce longer, and age in place in the 
community. Is the occupational therapy profession ready for the potential demand 
for driving rehabilitation services from this generation of older drivers who 
grew up with the automobile and are dependent on it for access to and 
participation in their communities?

BACKGROUND: In 2007 the children's right to specialised paediatric palliative 
home care became law in Germany. This claim should be met in Lower Saxony by the 
establishment of a comprehensive specialised paediatric home care (SPPHC). Since 
April 2010, a central office undertakes the coordination and administration 
throughout the federal state. Regional teams comprising nursing, medical and 
psychosocial specialists care for the children and adolescents suffering from 
complex conditions due to life-limiting conditions - subsidiary to regional 
health care providers. The aim of the study was to evaluate SPPHC in Lower 
Saxony.
METHODOLOGY: From June 2012 to February 2013, semi-structured interviews were 
conducted with 20 parents of children aged from 3 to 18 years. The young 
patients fulfilled all criteria to be eligible for SPPHC. 13 of the families 
experienced SPPHC. 7 families did not utilise the specialised care, mostly 
because the palliative situation occurred before the implementation of 
specialised care. Data were analysed using content analysis (Mayring). 
Therefore, key aspects of paediatric palliative home care were summarised in 
main categories. The evaluation of parent's satisfaction with palliative home 
care was performed by an evaluation scheme developed for the main categories 
(very good - good - bad- very bad) and operated for every case.
RESULTS: 6 dimensions of paediatric palliative home care were identified: (i) 
benefit of care, (ii) continuity of care, (iii) perception of care providers as 
a team, (iv) dealing with the issues death and dying/hospice and palliative, (v) 
care provider's communication/cooperation with parents, and (vi) parent's 
Information. As all parents clearly indicated a rating on the first 3 
categories, these categories were selected for the evaluation of parent's 
satisfaction with the received home care. The evaluation revealed that parents 
experienced in SPPHC looked upon these 3 main categories more favourably than 
parents without the experience of SPPHC. As room for improvement, the 
respondents requested the extension of physician's presence and communication 
with the families as well as with each other, efforts to better meet the needs 
of psycho-social support of the families and to optimise follow up-care.
CONCLUSION: The implementation of SAPPV was rated positively by the concerned 
families. In addition, options for improvement could be identified.

[Treatment of gunshot fractures of the lower extremity: Part 2: Procedures for 
secondary reconstruction and treatment results].

BACKGROUND: Gunshot wounds of the lower extremities are always serious injuries, 
especially in cases in which bone is affected. Contamination and extensive 
tissue damage can be life-threatening for the patient and severely affect the 
function of the extremity. Contamination and local infections with multidrug 
resistant pathogens are regularly encountered particularly in casualties 
evacuated from crisis regions. Treatment of this special type of injury, which 
differs in the form and extent from conventional high-energy trauma of the lower 
extremities, usually requires lengthy and extensive therapy algorithms in order 
to preserve the affected extremity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Based on the results of 34 gunshot wounds of the lower 
extremities which were surgically treated in this department between 2005 and 
2011, this article reports on procedures used for wound management, soft tissue 
reconstruction and restoration of bone continuity. This group included 18 
patients with a total of 20 gunshot-related fractures, 40% of which affected the 
lower leg and 35% the thigh. The affected extremities could be salvaged in all 
cases.
RESULTS: The therapeutic spectrum required for bone reconstruction after soft 
tissue coverage demonstrated in these case examples ranged from conventional 
osteosynthesis with or without local cancellous bone transplant with 
platelet-rich plasma, to healing in a fixator, bone resection and the Masquelet 
method, distraction osteogenesis using a fixator in order to restore continuity 
and definitive secondary extension using an intramedullary skeletal kinetic 
distractor (ISKD) nail. Out of 15 bullet fractures affecting large tubular bones 
8 could be healed without any shortening, axis deviation or malrotation. In 7 
cases definitive shortening by an average of 20 mm (minimum 10 mm and maximum 40 
mm) was necessary. The average treatment time before full weight-bearing was 
achieved within tolerable pain limits was 66 weeks (minimum 4 weeks and maximum 
267 weeks). Secondary osteitis and osteomyelitis following primary restoration 
was detected in only one case.
CONCLUSION: These results show that the treatment of gunshot wounds of the lower 
extremities is time-consuming and extensive and requires the complete spectrum 
of modern trauma surgery. Despite the high risk of complications during 
treatment it is possible and feasible to apply procedures that preserve the 
extremities.

A comparison of methods for converting DCE values onto the full health-dead QALY 
scale.

Sheffield, UK (DR, JB, BVH).

BACKGROUND: Preference elicitation techniques such as time trade-off (TTO) and 
standard gamble (SG) receive criticism for their complexity and difficulties of 
use. Ordinal techniques such as discrete choice experiment (DCE) are arguably 
easier to understand but generate values that are not anchored onto the full 
health-dead 1-0 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) scale required for use in 
economic evaluation.
METHODS: This article compares existing methods for converting modeled DCE 
latent values onto the full health-dead QALY scale: 1) anchoring DCE values 
using dead as valued in the DCE and 2) anchoring DCE values using TTO value for 
worst state to 2 new methods: 3) mapping DCE values onto TTO and 4) combining 
DCE and TTO data in a hybrid model. Models are compared using their ability to 
predict mean TTO health state values.
DATA: We use postal DCE data (n = 263) and TTO data (n = 307) collected by 
interview in a general population valuation study of an asthma 
condition-specific measure (AQL-5D).
RESULTS: New methods 3 and 4 using mapping and hybrid models are better able to 
predict mean TTO health state values (mean absolute difference [MAD], 
0.052-0.084) than the anchor-based methods (MAD, 0.075-0.093) and were better 
able to predict mean TTO health state values even when using in their estimation 
a subsample of the available TTO data.
CONCLUSIONS: These new mapping and hybrid methods have a potentially useful role 
for producing values on the QALY scale from data elicited using ordinal 
techniques such as DCE for use in economic evaluation that makes best use of the 
desirable properties of each elicitation technique and elicited data. Further 
research is encouraged.

we afford it?

During the last years, the numbers of interventions in structural heart disease 
such as transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), percutaneous treatment 
of mitral regurgitation using the MitraClip, closure of atrial septal defects 
(ASD) and others have constantly increased. While the 20th century was called 
the century of surgery, it appears that the present century might be the century 
of minimally invasive percutaneous therapy. The reduced invasiveness of these 
procedures and the success in elderly patients make these treatments 
increasingly attractive for younger and healthier patients. Now that these 
procedures are moving forward, some questions arise, namely, who is deciding on 
treatment modality, and can we afford it?

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess potential cost-effectiveness of 
using a prostate cancer specific functional imaging technology capable of 
identifying residual localized disease versus small volume metastatic disease 
for asymptomatic men with low but detectable prostate specific antigen (PSA) 
elevation following radical prostatectomy.
METHODS: Markov modeling was used to estimate the incremental impact on 
healthcare system costs (2012 USD) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 
two alternative strategies: (i) using the new diagnostic to guide therapy versus 
(ii) current usual care-using a combination of computed tomography, magnetic 
resonance imaging, and bone scan to guide therapy. Costs were based on estimates 
from literature and Medicare reimbursement. Prostate cancer progression, 
survival, utilities, and background risk of all-cause mortality were obtained 
from literature. Base-case diagnostic sensitivity (75 percent), specificity (90 
percent), and cost (USD 2,500) were provided by our industry partner GE 
Healthcare.
RESULTS: The new diagnostic strategy provided an average gain of 1.83 (95 
percent uncertainty interval [UI]: 1.24-2.64) QALYs with added costs of USD 
15,595 (95 percent UI: USD -6,330-44,402) over 35 years. The resulting 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was USD 8,516/QALY (95 percent UI: USD 
-2,947-22,372). RESULTS were most influenced by the utility discounting rate and 
test performance characteristics; however, the new diagnostic provided clinical 
benefits over a wide range of sensitivity and specificity.
CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests a diagnostic technology capable of 
identifying whether men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy 
have localized versus metastatic disease would be a cost-effective alternative 
to current standard work-up. The results support additional investment in 
development and validation of such a diagnostic.

Chemokines and its receptors have significant impact on physiological and 
pathological processes and studies concerning their association with tumor 
biology are subject of great interest in scientific community. CXCL12/CXCR4 axis 
has been widely studied due to its significant role in tumor microenvironment, 
but it is also important to development and maintenance of tissues and organs, 
for example, in the brain and cerebellum. Studies have demonstrated that CXCL12 
and CXCR4 are required for normal cerebellar development and that dysfunction in 
this pathway may be involved with medulloblastoma pathogenesis. In this context, 
a new molecular subgroup has been suggested based on the importance of the 
association between CXCR4 overexpression and sonic hedgehog subgroup. Treatment 
using CXCR4 antagonists showed significant results, evidencing the important 
role and possible therapeutic capacity of CXCR4 in MB. This review summarizes 
studies on MB cell biology, focusing on a chemokine-receptor axis, CXCL12/CXCR4, 
that may have implications for treatment strategies once it can improve life 
expectancy and reduce neurocognitive sequelae of patients with this neoplasia.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate cost effectiveness of coronary 
artery bypass graft (CABG) versus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with 
stenting from Iran society perspective.
METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out to estimate the annual cost and 
health related quality of life (HRQoL) of 109 patients who underwent coronary 
revascularization (PCI [n = 75] and CABG [n = 34]). A Markov model has been 
developed to determine the cost effectiveness of CABG compared with PCI. We used 
the model to calculate lifetime costs, life-years (LYs), and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) of each strategy. We also used probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis to test model robustness.
RESULTS: We found that discounted QALY lived per person in CABG versus PCI group 
in 5 years, 10 years, and lifetime time horizon were (3.8 ± 0.13 versus 3.88 ± 
0.14), (6.4 ± 0.23 versus 6.33 ± 0.22), and (8.74 ± 0.29 versus 8.33 ± 0.27), 
respectively. The estimated medical cost of CABG and PCI per patient in 5 years, 
10 years, and lifetime time horizon were (USD 6,819 ± 765 versus 9,011 ± 1,816), 
(USD 8,852 ± 1,348 versus 12,034 ± 2,375), and (USD 14,037± 4,201 versus 18,798 
± 5,821), respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio results showed 
CABG is a dominate alternative in 10 years and lifetime time horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that despite higher initial cost and lower 
HRQoL, CABG is a cost-effective revascularization strategy compared with PCI for 
patients with multivessel coronary artery disease in long-term.

Stockholm, Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of medical yoga as an early 
intervention compared with evidence-based exercise therapy and self-care advice 
for non-specific low back pain.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with a cost-effectiveness analysis.
SUBJECTS: A total of 159 participants randomized into the medical yoga group 
(n = 52), the exercise therapy group (n = 52) and the self-care advice group 
(n = 55).
METHODS: The health outcome measure EQ-5D was applied to measure quality of life 
data combined with cost data collected from treatment groups from baseline to 12 
months follow-up. Outcome measure was health-related quality of life (HRQL). 
Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was also calculated. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted primarily from the societal and 
employer perspectives.
RESULTS: Medical yoga is cost-effective compared with self-care advice if an 
employer considers the significant improvement in the HRQL of an employee with 
low back pain justifies the additional cost of treatment (i.e. in this study EUR 
150). From a societal perspective, medical yoga is a cost-effective treatment 
compared with exercise therapy and self-care advice if an additional QALY is 
worth EUR 11,500. Sensitivity analysis suggests that medical yoga is more 
cost-effective than its alternatives.
CONCLUSION: Six weeks of uninterrupted medical yoga thera-py is a cost-effective 
early intervention for non-specific low back pain, when treatment 
recommendations are adhered to.

BACKGROUND: What is the factor that affects healthy life expectancy? Healthy 
life expectancy (HLE) at birth may be influenced by components of the gender 
inequality index (GII). Notably, this claim is not tested on the between 
components of the GII, such as population at least secondary education (PLSE) 
with ages 25 and older, labor force participation rate (LFPR) with ages 15 and 
older, and the HLE in the world's countries. Thus, this study estimates the 
associations between the PLSE, LFPR of components of the GII and the HLE.
METHODS: The data for the analysis of HLE in 148 countries were obtained from 
the World Health Organization. Information regarding the GII indicators for this 
study was obtained from the United Nations database. Associations between these 
factors and HLE were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients and 
regression models.
RESULTS: Although significant negative correlations were found between HLE and 
the LFPR, positive correlations were found between HLE and PLSE. Finally, the 
HLE predictors were used to form a model of the components of the GII, with 
higher PLSE as secondary education and lower LFPR as labor force (R(2) = 0.552, 
P <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Gender inequality of the attainment secondary education and labor 
force participation seems to have an important latent effect on healthy life 
expectancy at birth. Therefore, in populations with high HLE, the gender 
inequalities in HLE are smaller because of a combination of a larger secondary 
education advantage and a smaller labor force disadvantage in male-females.

BACKGROUND: Currently there are no reported cancer-specific health state 
valuations in low- and middle-income countries using a validated
