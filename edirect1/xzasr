BACKGROUND: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services considered whether to 
reimburse stool DNA testing for colorectal cancer screening among Medicare 
enrollees.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the conditions under which stool DNA testing could be 
cost-effective compared with the colorectal cancer screening tests currently 
reimbursed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
DESIGN: Comparative microsimulation modeling study using 2 independently 
developed models.
DATA SOURCES: Derived from literature.
TARGET POPULATION: A cohort of persons aged 65 years. A sensitivity analysis was 
also conducted, in which a cohort of persons aged 50 years was studied.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer.
INTERVENTION: Stool DNA test every 3 or 5 years in comparison with currently 
recommended colorectal cancer screening strategies.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, lifetime costs, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios, and threshold costs.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Assuming a cost of $350 per test, strategies of 
stool DNA testing every 3 or 5 years yielded fewer life-years and higher costs 
than the currently recommended colorectal cancer screening strategies. Screening 
with the stool DNA test would be cost-effective at a per-test cost of $40 to $60 
for stool DNA testing every 3 years, depending on the simulation model used. 
There were no levels of sensitivity and specificity for which stool DNA testing 
would be cost-effective at its current cost of $350 per test. Stool DNA testing 
every 3 years would be cost-effective at a cost of $350 per test if the relative 
adherence to stool DNA testing were at least 50% better than that with other 
screening tests.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: None of the results changed substantially when 
a cohort of persons aged 50 years was considered.
LIMITATION: No pathways other than the traditional adenoma-carcinoma sequence 
were modeled.
CONCLUSION: Stool DNA testing could be a cost-effective alternative for 
colorectal cancer screening if the cost of the test substantially decreased or 
if its availability would entice a large fraction of otherwise unscreened 
persons to receive screening.

Hallmark features of immunosenescence are absent in familial longevity.

Seropositivity for CMV is one of the parameters of the "immune risk profile" 
associated with mortality in longitudinal studies of the very elderly and may 
accelerate immunosenescence. Thus, any genetic factors influencing human 
longevity may be associated with susceptibility to CMV and CMV-accelerated 
immunosenescence. To test this, we analyzed long-lived families in the Leiden 
Longevity Study (LLS) in which offspring enjoy a 30% reduced standardized 
mortality rate, possibly owing to genetic enrichment. Serum C-reactive protein 
levels and the frequency of different T cell subsets were compared between 97 
LLS offspring and 97 controls (their partners, representing the normal 
population). We also determined the capacity of T cells to respond against 
immunodominant Ags from CMV in a smaller group of LLS subjects and controls. CMV 
infection was strongly associated with an age-related reduction in the frequency 
of naive T cells and an accumulation of CD45RA-re-expressing and 
late-differentiated effector memory T cells in the general population, but not 
in members of long-lived families. The latter also had significantly lower 
C-reactive protein levels, indicating a lower proinflammatory status compared 
with CMV-infected controls. Finally, T cells from a higher proportion of 
offspring mounted a proliferative response against CMV Ags, which was also of 
greater magnitude and broader specificity than controls. Our data suggest that 
these rare individuals genetically enriched for longevity are less susceptible 
to the characteristic CMV-associated age-driven immune alterations commonly 
considered to be hallmarks of immunosenescence, which might reflect better 
immunological control of the virus and contribute to their decreased mortality 
rate.

OBJECTIVE: [F-18]-Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is 
used increasingly in the work-up to surgery for patients with potentially 
resectable colorectal liver metastases. This study evaluates the clinical 
effectiveness, impact on health care resources and cost-effectiveness of adding 
FDG-PET to the diagnostic algorithm alongside a randomized clinical trial from a 
health care perspective.
METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial, the net monetary benefit (NMB) of 
FDG-PET added to conventional diagnostic work-up (CWU) was determined in 
patients with colorectal liver metastases. Seventy-five patients were included 
in each arm. Change in clinical management, futile laparotomies, preoperative 
findings and all relevant health care consumption were prospectively documented 
during 3 years. To assess health-related quality of life European Quality of 
Life-5 Dimensions was administered at the time of randomization, 3 and 6 weeks 
postoperatively, and every 3 months postoperatively for 3 years. 
Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated based on European Quality of 
Life-5 Dimensions outcomes.
RESULTS: In adding FDG-PET, diagnostic performance increased and futile 
laparotomies were reduced by 38%. Both health-related quality of life and QALYs 
showed no significant difference between the CWU and PET groups. For CWU and PET 
groups costs were euro 92,836 and euro 81,776, respectively, accumulated in 3 
years after randomization. NMB ranged from euro 1004 to euro 11,060 depending on 
the monetary value given to a QALY. When costs for chemotherapy were 
disregarded, costs amounted to euro 15,874 for CWU and euro 18,664 for PET 
group.
CONCLUSION: Additional costs of FDG-PET in the diagnostic work-up of patients 
with potentially resectable colorectal liver metastases were compensated by a 
reduction in futile laparotomies. The NMB analysis showed savings over a 
relevant range of willingness to pay for a QALY.

Combining coma score and serum biomarker levels to predict unfavorable outcome 
following childhood brain trauma.

This study aims to determine if pairing the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) with serum 
biomarker levels may achieve higher outcome predictive values than using either 
the GCS or biomarker levels alone in childhood brain trauma. Twenty-eight 
critically ill children with isolated accidental brain trauma were studied in a 
prospective observational study. The GCS was recorded at various time points 
post injury. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify 
eight different serum biomarker levels (S100b, NSE, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, 
L-selectin, SICAM, and endothelin) on day 1 post injury. The Glasgow Outcome 
Score (GOS) was used to assess global outcome at 6 months post injury. Outcome 
predictive values of the GCS, individual biomarker levels, and paired 
combinations of the GCS and biomarkers were compared using receiver operator 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and its multivariate extension, multivariate 
ROC curve (MultiROC). When using either the GCS or individual biomarker levels 
alone to predict unfavorable outcome, only the PICU discharge summated GCS 
achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of more than 0.95. This high degree 
of outcome predictability was also achieved by pairing the GCS with a single 
biomarker level. The most pronounced improvement in outcome prediction was 
observed by pairing the post-resuscitation summated GCS with the day-1 serum 
IL-8 level, which increased the AUC from 0.78 to 0.98 and the sensitivity and 
specificity from 75% to 100% and 96% respectively. Paired combinations of the 
GCS and serum biomarker levels greatly enhanced the accuracy of post-traumatic 
unfavorable outcome prediction than may be achieved using either the GCS or 
individual biomarker levels alone.

Treatment of chronic radiculopathy of the first sacral nerve root using 
neuromobilization techniques: A case study.

Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The engagement of the first sacral nerve root is one 
of the most common etiologies in Sciatic Pain Syndrome (SPS). Different 
interfering methods are used in the physical therapy of people with SPS 
including physical modalities, exercise therapy, traction, and joint and 
neuromobilization, depending on the symptoms and radiculopathy phase. The 
present case study attempts to describe neuromobilization methods in treating 
chronic radiculopathy of the first sacral nerve root, as well as its abnormal 
neurodynamic responses.
THE CASE: The patient was a 36-year-old man with lower back pain during 
construction work 9 months before, and presenting with complaint of burning pain 
and tingling in his left Posterior part of the thigh and leg. Active extension, 
rotation, and lateral flexion of the trunk in standing position had a complete 
range with no pain. SLR and Slump neurodynamic tests revealed that with 
increasing sensitive elements, there appeared to be abnormal sciatic nerve 
tension, and complaint due to returning burn and tingling in the posterior part 
of the thigh and leg. MRI findings revealed intervertebral disc dehydrations at 
L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1 levels, as well as postero-lateral protrusion in L5-S1 
intervertebral disc. Following three routine physical therapy sessions, with no 
improvement, neuromobilization technique was used for 6 sessions.
RESULTS: The usual routine physical therapy methods did have any visible impact 
in solving the patient's problems during daily-life activities and physical 
diagnosis findings, yet, following neuromobilization technique, the assessment 
at the beginning of the eleventh session and the patient's follow-ups two months 
later showed that his problems during daily-life activities and in neurodynamic 
tests were totally solved.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Abnormal neurodynamic responses and consequently 
symptoms in patients with chronic radiculopathy may be due to a pathomechanic 
problem and deficiency in neural adjustment for movement and tension transfer. 
Neuromobilization techniques can increasingly useful in treatment of abnormal 
neural tensions and removing chronic radiculopathy symptoms.

Novel insights into the management of brain metastases.

Center, Madison, Wisconsin 53792, USA. gondi@humonc.wisc.edu

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review provides available clinical evidence regarding 
current therapies, discusses ongoing controversies, and introduces 
investigational approaches in the management of brain metastases.
RECENT FINDINGS: Novel approaches to estimating prognosis of patients with brain 
metastases highlight the importance of tailoring treatment to each particular 
patient. In the setting of unfavorable prognosis, either hospice care, symptom 
management, or short-course whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is a critical 
component of palliation. In the setting of favorable or intermediate prognosis, 
treatment options can include a slightly more prolonged course of WBRT, surgery, 
stereotactic radiosurgery, systemic therapy, or a combination. Selection of the 
appropriate treatment is influenced by the number of brain metastases, overall 
patient performance status and residual life expectancy, as well as an 
understanding of the benefits and toxicities of each modality. Recent clinical 
studies have shed novel insight on the temporal sequence of memory changes 
following WBRT. Innovative approaches to mitigating these radiation-induced 
memory effects are currently being investigated.
SUMMARY: Evidence-based management of brain metastases represents an evolving 
field of active clinical research. Ongoing and future investigations focus on 
the preservation of cognition and quality of life, in addition to conventional 
outcomes such as intracranial tumor control and survival.

The leading causes of death in the Umbria Region (Italy) between 1994-2008 were 
analysed and a comparison was made between data from three five-year time 
periods: 1994-1998, 1999-2003 and 2004-2008. Standardized rates of Years of 
Potential Life Lost (YPLL) at 75 years, by gender and cause of death, were also 
measured. Mortality data was obtained from the Umbria Registry of causes of 
death; diagnoses were codified according to the International Classification of 
Diseases 10th revision (ICD10). Mortality trends over time were analysed by 
using standardized mortality rates with the 2001 Umbria census data as the 
reference population . The joinpoint regression program was used to analyze 
rates calculated by the SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) 
software of the National Cancer Institute (USA). Mortality for all causes, 
standardised by age, show a significantly decreasing trend from 1994 to 2008 in 
both genders. Mortality rates for cardiovascular diseases and malignant tumours 
show a significant constant decline in both genders. Standardised rates of YPLL 
at 75 years declined by 32% in males and 29% in females between the five-year 
period 1994-1998 and the period 2004-2008. In conclusion, a generalised decline 
in mortality and a shift towards older age groups is observed with a consequent 
decline in YPLL, allowing a positive judgment to be given regarding the efficacy 
of preventive, therapeutic and rehabilitation interventions implemented by the 
regional health care system.

National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

HIV/AIDS is a global pandemic and is the leading infectious cause of death among 
adults. Although antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has dramatically improved the 
quality of life and increased the life expectancy of those infected with HIV, 
life-long suppressive treatment is required and a cure for HIV infection remains 
elusive; frequency of dosing and drug toxicity as well as the development of 
viral resistance pose additional limitations. Furthermore, preventative measures 
such as a vaccine or microbicide are urgently needed to curb the rate of new 
infections. The capabilities inherent to nanotechnology hold much potential for 
impact in the field of HIV treatment and prevention. This article reviews the 
potential for the multidisciplinary field of nanotechnology to advance the 
fields of HIV treatment and prevention.

Gender imbalances induced by age limits in stroke trials.

Main, Germany. foerch@em.uni-frankfurt.de

BACKGROUND: Gender differences in life expectancy result in a higher proportion 
of women in the older population. This causes a female preponderance among 
elderly patients with ischaemic stroke. On the other hand, upper age limits are 
frequently used in clinical trials, in part due to safety reasons and logistical 
concerns. In this study, we model how applying upper age limits will lead to a 
gender disparity in stroke trials, favouring the inclusion of men rather than 
women.
METHODS: We analyzed a prospective hospital-based stroke registry covering the 
entire Federal State of Hesse, Germany. All cases with admission between 2003 
and 2005 and a final diagnosis of ischaemic stroke (ICD10:I63) were selected. 
For various upper age limits (70, 75, 80, 85 and 90 years), we calculated the 
proportion of men and women excluded based on their age when applying the 
respective age span to the study population.
RESULTS: A total of 34,754 patients were analyzed, and 17,748 (51%) hereof were 
women. Their mean age was 73.6 ± 12.1 years. The women were older than the men 
(76.8 ± 11.7 years vs. 70.2 ± 11.7 years; p < 0.001). All upper age limits 
provoked a significant gender disparity by leaving a higher proportion of female 
than male patients outside the admissible range. In particular, selecting 80 
years as the upper age cut-off excluded 19% of all male patients but 44% of all 
female patients (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Setting an upper age limit for ischaemic stroke trials is likely 
not to be gender neutral but withholds a higher proportion of female than male 
patients from study participation. Investigators should be aware of such gender 
imbalances, which may involuntarily be transferred into routine clinical 
practice.

BACKGROUND: Indian guidelines recommend routine referral for HIV testing of all 
tuberculosis (TB) patients in the nine states with the highest HIV prevalence, 
and selective referral for testing elsewhere. We assessed the clinical impact 
and cost-effectiveness of alternative HIV testing referral strategies among TB 
patients in India.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We utilized a computer model of HIV and TB disease to 
project outcomes for patients with active TB in India. We compared life 
expectancy, cost, and cost-effectiveness for three HIV testing referral 
strategies: 1) selective referral for HIV testing of those with increased HIV 
risk, 2) routine referral of patients in the nine highest HIV prevalence states 
with selective referral elsewhere (current standard), and 3) routine referral of 
all patients for HIV testing. TB-related data were from the World Health 
Organization. HIV prevalence among TB patients was 9.0% in the highest 
prevalence states, 2.9% in the other states, and 4.9% overall. The selective 
referral strategy, beginning from age 33.50 years, had a projected discounted 
life expectancy of 16.88 years and a mean lifetime HIV/TB treatment cost of 
US$100. The current standard increased mean life expectancy to 16.90 years with 
additional per-person cost of US$10; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
was US$650/year of life saved (YLS) compared to selective referral. Routine 
referral of all patients for HIV testing increased life expectancy to 16.91 
years, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$730/YLS compared to 
the current standard. For HIV-infected patients cured of TB, receiving 
antiretroviral therapy increased survival from 4.71 to 13.87 years. Results were 
most sensitive to the HIV prevalence and the cost of second-line antiretroviral 
therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Referral of all patients with active TB in India for HIV testing 
will be both effective and cost-effective. While effective implementation of 
this strategy would require investment, routine, voluntary HIV testing of TB 
patients in India should be recommended.

ETS-4 is a transcriptional regulator of life span in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.

Aging is a complex phenotype responsive to a plethora of environmental inputs; 
yet only a limited number of transcriptional regulators are known to influence 
life span. How the downstream expression programs mediated by these factors (or 
others) are coordinated into common or distinct set of aging effectors is an 
addressable question in model organisms, such as C. elegans. Here, we establish 
the transcription factor ETS-4, an ortholog of vertebrate SPDEF, as a longevity 
determinant. Adult worms with ets-4 mutations had a significant extension of 
mean life span. Restoring ETS-4 activity in the intestine, but not neurons, of 
ets-4 mutant worms rescued life span to wild-type levels. Using RNAi, we 
demonstrated that ets-4 is required post-developmentally to regulate adult life 
span; thus uncoupling the role of ETS-4 in aging from potential functions in 
worm intestinal development. Seventy ETS-4-regulated genes, identified by gene 
expression profiling of two distinct ets-4 alleles and analyzed by 
bioinformatics, were enriched for known longevity effectors that function in 
lipid transport, lipid metabolism, and innate immunity. Putative target genes 
were enriched for ones that change expression during normal aging, the majority 
of which are controlled by the GATA factors. Also, some ETS-4-regulated genes 
function downstream of the FOXO factor, DAF-16 and the insulin/IGF-1 signaling 
pathway. However, epistasis and phenotypic analyses indicate that ets-4 
functioned in parallel to the insulin/IGF-1 receptor, daf-2 and akt-1/2 kinases. 
Furthermore, ets-4 required daf-16 to modulate aging, suggesting overlap in 
function at the level of common targets that affect life span. In conclusion, 
ETS-4 is a new transcriptional regulator of aging, which shares transcriptional 
targets with GATA and FOXO factors, suggesting that overlapping pathways direct 
common sets of lifespan-related genes.

The intrusion of the discourse of economics into the clinical space III: 
economic rationalism and clinical effects.

Moorabbin, Victoria, Australia. m.plastow@alfred.org.au

OBJECTIVE: Language has always been a means of imposing political and economic 
dominance. The ascendancy of the discourse of economics is examined in the 
context of economic rationalism. Some of the effects of this discourse, both 
upon our services, as well as upon different modes of conceptualizing the 
therapeutic relationship, will be examined in this paper.
CONCLUSIONS: The intensification of the use of terms from economics and 
management can be dated from the introduction of neo-liberal policies in our 
Western democracies, but the economic discourse circulates with a life of its 
own. The use of the language of economics and management has spread generally 
through our society. Thus, if the economic discourse is the language utilized by 
some clinicians, it is also to some degree the language adopted by our patients. 
It is proposed that the extension of the economic discourse into the clinical 
field is re-shaping the therapeutic relationship with our patients.

We present the case of a 101-year-old female who was successfully operated for 
an open elective repair of a symptomatic 9 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is 
the oldest case reported in the literature for elective open abdominal aortic 
aneurysm repair with successful outcome. This case raises an important ethical 
issue of human life expectancy and the appropriateness of high-risk surgery on a 
centenarian.

OBJECTIVES: I examined the association between income inequality and population 
health and tested whether this association was mediated by interpersonal trust 
or public expenditures on health.
METHODS: Individual data on trust were collected from 48 641 adults in 33 
countries. These data were linked to country data on income inequality, public 
health expenditures, healthy life expectancy, and adult mortality. Regression 
analyses tested for statistical mediation of the association between income 
inequality and population health outcomes by country differences in trust and 
health expenditures.
RESULTS: Income inequality correlated with country differences in trust (r = 
-0.51), health expenditures (r = -0.45), life expectancy (r = -0.74), and 
mortality (r = 0.55). Trust correlated with life expectancy (r = 0.48) and 
mortality (r = -0.47) and partly mediated their relations to income inequality. 
Health expenditures did not correlate with life expectancy and mortality, and 
health expenditures did not mediate links between inequality and health.
CONCLUSIONS: Income inequality might contribute to short life expectancy and 
adult mortality in part because of societal differences in trust. Societies with 
low levels of trust may lack the capacity to create the kind of social supports 
and connections that promote health and successful aging.

Extracellular dopamine potentiates mn-induced oxidative stress, lifespan 
reduction, and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a BLI-3-dependent manner in 
Caenorhabditis elegans.

States of America.

Parkinson's disease (PD)-mimicking drugs and pesticides, and more recently 
PD-associated gene mutations, have been studied in cell cultures and mammalian 
models to decipher the molecular basis of PD. Thus far, a dozen of genes have 
been identified that are responsible for inherited PD. However they only account 
for about 8% of PD cases, most of the cases likely involving environmental 
contributions. Environmental manganese (Mn) exposure represents an established 
risk factor for PD occurrence, and both PD and Mn-intoxicated patients display a 
characteristic extrapyramidal syndrome primarily involving dopaminergic 
(DAergic) neurodegeneration with shared common molecular mechanisms. To better 
understand the specificity of DAergic neurodegeneration, we studied Mn toxicity 
in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans. Combining genetics and biochemical assays, we 
established that extracellular, and not intracellular, dopamine (DA) is 
responsible for Mn-induced DAergic neurodegeneration and that this process (1) 
requires functional DA-reuptake transporter (DAT-1) and (2) is associated with 
oxidative stress and lifespan reduction. Overexpression of the anti-oxidant 
transcription factor, SKN-1, affords protection against Mn toxicity, while the 
DA-dependency of Mn toxicity requires the NADPH dual-oxidase BLI-3. These 
results suggest that in vivo BLI-3 activity promotes the conversion of 
extracellular DA into toxic reactive species, which, in turn, can be taken up by 
DAT-1 in DAergic neurons, thus leading to oxidative stress and cell 
degeneration.

Many investigations in recent years have targeted understanding the genetic and 
biochemical basis of aging. Collectively, genetic factors and biological 
mechanisms appear to influence longevity in general and specifically; reduction 
of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling cascade has extended life span in diverse 
species. Genetic alteration of mammals for life extension indicates correlation 
to serum IGF-1 levels in mice, and IGF-1 levels have been demonstrated as a 
physiological predictor of frailty with aging in man. Longevity and aging data 
in the dog offer a close measure of the natural multifactorial longevity 
interactions of genetic influence, IGF-1 signaling, and environmental factors 
such as exposure, exercise, and lifestyle. The absence of genetic alteration 
more closely represents the human longevity status, and the unique species 
structure of the canine facilitates analyses not possible in other species. 
These investigations aimed to measure serum IGF-1 in numerous purebred and 
mixed-breed dogs of variable size and longevity in comparison to age, gender, 
and spay/neuter differences. The primary objective of this investigation was to 
determine plasma IGF-1 levels in the adult dog, including a wide range of breeds 
and adult body weight. The sample set includes animals ranging from just a few 
months of age through 204 months and ranging in size from 5 to 160 lb. Four 
groups were evaluated for serum IGF-1 levels, including intact and neutered 
males, and intact and spayed females. IGF-1 loss over time, as a function of 
age, decreases in all groups with significant differences between males and 
females. The relationship between IGF-1 and weight differs depending upon 
spay/neuter status, but there is an overall increase in IGF-1 levels with 
increasing weight. The data, currently being interrogated further for 
delineation of IGF-1 receptor variants and sex differences, are being collected 
longitudinally and explored for longevity associations previously unavailable in 
non-genetically modified mammals.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent complication in cancer patients, and 
represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Especially in those 
patients who have a poor life expectancy, preventing death from pulmonary 
embolism is the mainstay of treatment. Critically ill patients should promptly 
be administered thrombolytic drugs. Except for selected patients requiring 
aggressive therapy, the initial VTE treatment should be conducted with 
adjusted-dose unfractionated heparin, fixed-dose low-molecular-weight heparin 
(LMWH) or fondaparinux. LMWHs and fondaparinux have the potential to greatly 
simplify the initial treatment of VTE, making the treatment of suitable patients 
feasible in an outpatient setting. During anticoagulant therapy, cancer patients 
have a twofold to fourfold higher risk of recurrent VTE and major bleeding 
complications when compared to non-cancer patients. The long-term administration 
of LMWH should be considered as an alternative to anti-vitamin K drugs in 
patients with advanced disease and in those with conditions limiting the use of 
oral anticoagulants. Prolongation of anticoagulation should be considered for as 
long as the malignant disorder is active.

used for the reconstruction of maxillo-mandibular defects due to extreme 
atrophy.

Paolo Hospital, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. matteo.chiapasco@unimi.it

PURPOSE: the objectives of this study were to evaluate (a) the clinical outcome 
of revascularized fibula flaps used for the reconstruction of extremely atrophic 
jaws and (b) the survival rates of dental implants placed in the reconstructed 
areas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: between 1999 and 2004, 12 patients presenting with 
extreme atrophy of the edentulous jaws were reconstructed with fibula free 
flaps. Five to 12 months after the reconstructive procedure, 75 titanium dental 
implants were placed in the reconstructed areas, while prosthetic rehabilitation 
was started 4-6 months afterward. The mean follow-up of patients after the start 
of prosthetic loading was 77 months (range: 48-116).
RESULTS: an uneventful healing of the bone transplants occurred in all patients. 
One out of the 75 dental implants placed was not loaded due to prosthetic 
reasons. No dental implants failed to integrate before prosthetic loading, while 
three were removed during the follow-up period. Despite the high survival rate 
of dental implants (95.8%), a relevant number of them presented relevant 
peri-implant bone-level loss, ranging from 1 to 7 mm for maxillary dental 
implants and from 1 to 4.5 mm for mandibular dental implants.
CONCLUSION: although no failures of the bone transplants occurred and a high 
long-term survival rate of dental implants were observed, this study showed that 
fibula free flaps do not guarantee dimensional stability of peri-implant bone, 
despite the immediate blood supply delivered by the vascular pedicle. The 
peri-implant bone resorption was higher when compared with the one related to 
dental implants placed in native bone.

Reoperative valve surgery in the elderly: predictors of risk and long-term 
survival.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients requiring reoperative cardiac surgery for valve 
disease are considered high risk for immediate outcomes, but little is known 
about their long-term survival. It is often conjectured that medical therapy 
provides equivalent late survival in this population, which may dissuade both 
patient and surgeon from considering reoperation. We analyzed a cohort of such 
patients undergoing reoperative valve surgery to determine their long-term 
survival.
METHODS: From 1992 through 2007, 363 patients aged 75 years or more underwent 
reoperative isolated valve surgery; 211 (58%) had aortic valve replacement and 
152 (42%) had mitral valve surgery. Mean age was 80.5 years. Hospital outcomes 
were prospectively recorded. Survival from all-cause death was determined from 
the Social Security Death Index.
RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 13.8% (12.8% for aortic and 15.1% for mitral 
valve operations; p = 0.52). Multivariable predictors of hospital death were New 
York Heart Association functional class III or IV heart failure (odds ratio = 
3.19, p = 0.012), dialysis (odds ratio = 15.63, p = 0.003), and more than one 
reoperation (odds ratio = 2.59, p = 0.058). At 5 years, overall survival was 62% 
± 3% for all patients (66% ± 4% for aortic and 56% ± 4% for mitral valve 
patients). For aortic valve patients aged 80 years or more, 5-year survival was 
60% ± 0.6%. Life expectancy table analysis predicted a 5-year survival of 57% 
for an age-matched and sex-matched comparison group.
CONCLUSIONS: Reoperative surgery for elderly patients with isolated aortic or 
mitral valve pathology is associated with excellent long-term survival, 
particularly when treating aortic valve disease. While in-hospital mortality is 
higher among the elderly than among younger patients, specific predictors of 
poor outcome can be identified preoperatively to risk stratify these patients.

Half of the most severe cases of cerebral palsy (CP) survive to adulthood, but 
because this longevity is relatively recent, there is no empirical experience of 
their life expectancy past middle age. The last 2 decades have seen significant 
developments in the management of persons with CP, involving specialist services 
from an increasing number of disciplines that require coordination to maximize 
their effectiveness. This article provides an overview of CP. The author 
discusses definitions of CP, its epidemiology, pathologies, and range of 
possible clinical descriptions, and briefly touches on management and 
prevention.

Electrostatic effects on deposition of multiple phospholipid bilayers at oxide 
surfaces.

We investigated electrostatic effects on the formation of multiple supported 
phospholipid bilayers (SPB) by varying the oxide substrate, ionic strength, the 
presence of divalent Ca(2+), and phospholipid (PL) headgroup charge. Whereas the 
current understanding of processes and forces controlling SPB formation is based 
primarily on studies involving planar substrates, we report results from 
experiments using aqueous suspensions of quartz (α-SiO(2)) and corundum 
(α-Al(2)O(3)) particles. Using fluorescent dye-loaded 
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) vesicles, we determined that the vesicles 
underwent oxide particle-induced rupture and formed supported planar bilayers 
rather than a supported vesicle layer. Adsorption isotherms of DPPC at pH 7.2 in 
solutions of varying ionic strength set by NaCl, and with or without 2 mM 
Ca(2+), support our hypotheses that van der Waals forces predominantly account 
for two DPPC bilayers, and that adsorption beyond the second bilayer occurs at 
low ionic strength due to extension of the electric double-layer near the oxide 
surface. In contrast, adsorption isotherms of anionic 
dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine (DPPS) and cationic 
dipalmitoylethylphosphatidylcholine (DPEPC) show that adsorption of highly 
charged bilayers is decreased or prevented altogether due to bilayer-oxide 
and/or bilayer-bilayer repulsion. Results have potential implications for 
biomedical, industrial, and environmental remediation applications involving 
SPBs and for proto-cell stability in origin-of-life hypotheses.

BACKGROUND: If carotid artery narrowing remains asymptomatic (ie, has caused no 
recent stroke or other neurological symptoms), successful carotid endarterectomy 
(CEA) reduces stroke incidence for some years. We assessed the long-term effects 
of successful CEA.
METHODS: Between 1993 and 2003, 3120 asymptomatic patients from 126 centres in 
30 countries were allocated equally, by blinded minimised randomisation, to 
immediate CEA (median delay 1 month, IQR 0·3-2·5) or to indefinite deferral of 
any carotid procedure, and were followed up until death or for a median among 
survivors of 9 years (IQR 6-11). The primary outcomes were perioperative 
mortality and morbidity (death or stroke within 30 days) and non-perioperative 
stroke. Kaplan-Meier percentages and logrank p values are from 
intention-to-treat analyses. This study is registered, number ISRCTN26156392.
FINDINGS: 1560 patients were allocated immediate CEA versus 1560 allocated 
deferral of any carotid procedure. The proportions operated on while still 
asymptomatic were 89·7% versus 4·8% at 1 year (and 92·1%vs 16·5% at 5 years). 
Perioperative risk of stroke or death within 30 days was 3·0% (95% CI 2·4-3·9; 
26 non-disabling strokes plus 34 disabling or fatal perioperative events in 1979 
CEAs). Excluding perioperative events and non-stroke mortality, stroke risks 
(immediate vs deferred CEA) were 4·1% versus 10·0% at 5 years (gain 5·9%, 95% CI 
4·0-7·8) and 10·8% versus 16·9% at 10 years (gain 6·1%, 2·7-9·4); ratio of 
stroke incidence rates 0·54, 95% CI 0·43-0·68, p<0·0001. 62 versus 104 had a 
disabling or fatal stroke, and 37 versus 84 others had a non-disabling stroke. 
Combining perioperative events and strokes, net risks were 6·9% versus 10·9% at 
5 years (gain 4·1%, 2·0-6·2) and 13·4% versus 17·9% at 10 years (gain 4·6%, 
1·2-7·9). Medication was similar in both groups; throughout the study, most were 
on antithrombotic and antihypertensive therapy. Net benefits were significant 
both for those on lipid-lowering therapy and for those not, and both for men and 
for women up to 75 years of age at entry (although not for older patients).
INTERPRETATION: Successful CEA for asymptomatic patients younger than 75 years 
of age reduces 10-year stroke risks. Half this reduction is in disabling or 
fatal strokes. Net benefit in future patients will depend on their risks from 
unoperated carotid lesions (which will be reduced by medication), on future 
surgical risks (which might differ from those in trials), and on whether life 
expectancy exceeds 10 years.

Quality of life index (Quality Of Well-Being [QWB]) was used to calculate the 
costs per quality of well year (QWY) in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and compare 
it to other interventions. Ninety-eight primary and/or revision THA were 
reviewed. Patients had minimum 1-year follow-up. Quality of life index was used
