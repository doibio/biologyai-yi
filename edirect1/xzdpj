implementing AMS at Tikur Anbessa Specialised Hospital (TASH), a tertiary care 
hospital in Ethiopia.
DESIGN: We developed a Markov cohort model to assess the cost-utility of 
pharmacist-led AMS with concurrent strengthening of laboratory capacity compared 
with usual care from a 'restricted societal' perspective. We used a lifetime 
time horizon and discounted health outcomes and cost at 3% annually. Data were 
extracted from a prospective study of bloodstream infections among patients 
hospitalised at TASH, supplemented by published literature. We assessed 
parameter uncertainty using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
SETTING: Tertiary care hospital in Ethiopia, with 800 beds and serves over half 
a million patients per year.
POPULATION: Cohort of adults and children inpatient population aged 19.8 years 
at baseline.
INTERVENTION: Laboratory-supported pharmacist-led AMS compared with usual care. 
Usual care is defined as empirical initiation of antibiotic therapy in the 
absence of strong laboratory and AMS.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Expected life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
costs (US$2018) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: Laboratory-supported AMS strategy dominated usual care, that is, AMS 
was associated with an expected incremental gain of 38.8 QALYs at lower expected 
cost (incremental cost savings:US$82 370) per 1000 patients compared with usual 
care. Findings were sensitive to medication cost, infection-associated mortality 
and AMS-associated mortality reduction. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that AMS programme was likely to be cost-effective at 100% of the 
simulation compared with usual care at 1%-51% of gross domestic product/capita.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that laboratory-supported pharmacist-led AMS can 
result in improved health outcomes and substantial healthcare cost savings, 
demonstrating its economic advantage in a tertiary care hospital despite greater 
upfront investments in a low-resource setting.

The increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes in the general population as well as 
enhanced life expectancy has resulted in a rapid rise in the prevalence of 
diabetes in the older population. Diabetes causes significant morbidity and 
impairs quality of life. Managing diabetes in older adults is a daunting task 
due to unique health and psychosocial challenges. Medical management is 
complicated by polypharmacy, cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, 
injurious falls, and persistent pain. Health care providers now have several 
traditional and contemporary pharmacologic agents to manage diabetes. Avoidance 
of hypoglycemia is critical; however, evidence-based guidelines are lacking due 
to the paucity of clinical trials in older adults. For many in this population, 
maintaining independence is more important than adherence to published 
guidelines to prevent diabetes complications. The goal of diabetes care in older 
adults is to enhance the quality of life without subjecting these patients to 
intrusive and complicated interventions. Recent technological advancements such 
as continuous glucose monitoring systems can have crucial supplementary benefits 
in the geriatric population.

Recent foodborne illness outbreaks have heightened pressures on growers to deter 
wildlife from farms, jeopardizing conservation efforts. However, it remains 
unclear which species, particularly birds, pose the greatest risk to food 
safety. Using >11,000 pathogen tests and 1565 bird surveys covering 139 bird 
species from across the western United States, we examined the importance of 11 
traits in mediating wild bird risk to food safety. We tested whether traits 
associated with pathogen exposure (e.g., habitat associations, movement, and 
foraging strategy) and pace-of-life (clutch size and generation length) mediated 
foodborne pathogen prevalence and proclivities to enter farm fields and defecate 
on crops. Campylobacter spp. were the most prevalent enteric pathogen (8.0%), 
while Salmonella and Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) were rare 
(0.46% and 0.22% prevalence, respectively). We found that several traits related 
to pathogen exposure predicted pathogen prevalence. Specifically, Campylobacter 
and STEC-associated virulence genes were more often detected in species 
associated with cattle feedlots and bird feeders, respectively. Campylobacter 
was also more prevalent in species that consumed plants and had longer 
generation lengths. We found that species associated with feedlots were more 
likely to enter fields and defecate on crops. Our results indicated that 
canopy-foraging insectivores were less likely to deposit foodborne pathogens on 
crops, suggesting growers may be able to promote pest-eating birds and birds of 
conservation concern (e.g., via nest boxes) without necessarily compromising 
food safety. As such, promoting insectivorous birds may represent a win-win-win 
for bird conservation, crop production, and food safety. Collectively, our 
results suggest that separating crop production from livestock farming may be 
the best way to lower food safety risks from birds. More broadly, our 
trait-based framework suggests a path forward for co-managing wildlife 
conservation and food safety risks in farmlands by providing a strategy for 
holistically evaluating the food safety risks of wild animals, including 
under-studied species.

Seventy five percent of the world's food crops benefit from insect pollination. 
Hence, there has been increased interest in how global change drivers impact 
this critical ecosystem service. Because standardized data on crop pollination 
are rarely available, we are limited in our capacity to understand the variation 
in pollination benefits to crop yield, as well as to anticipate changes in this 
service, develop predictions, and inform management actions. Here, we present 
CropPol, a dynamic, open, and global database on crop pollination. It contains 
measurements recorded from 202 crop studies, covering 3,394 field observations, 
2,552 yield measurements (i.e., berry mass, number of fruits, and fruit density 
[kg/ha], among others), and 47,752 insect records from 48 commercial crops 
distributed around the globe. CropPol comprises 32 of the 87 leading global 
crops and commodities that are pollinator dependent. Malus domestica is the most 
represented crop (32 studies), followed by Brassica napus (22 studies), 
Vaccinium corymbosum (13 studies), and Citrullus lanatus (12 studies). The most 
abundant pollinator guilds recorded are honey bees (34.22% counts), bumblebees 
(19.19%), flies other than Syrphidae and Bombyliidae (13.18%), other wild bees 
(13.13%), beetles (10.97%), Syrphidae (4.87%), and Bombyliidae (0.05%). 
Locations comprise 34 countries distributed among Europe (76 studies), North 
America (60), Latin America and the Caribbean (29), Asia (20), Oceania (10), and 
Africa (7). Sampling spans three decades and is concentrated on 2001-2005 (21 
studies), 2006-2010 (40), 2011-2015 (88), and 2016-2020 (50). This is the most 
comprehensive open global data set on measurements of crop flower visitors, crop 
pollinators and pollination to date, and we encourage researchers to add more 
datasets to this database in the future. This data set is released for 
non-commercial use only. Credits should be given to this paper (i.e., proper 
citation), and the products generated with this database should be shared under

AIMS: To report the prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and its attributable risk 
factors in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019, by age, sex, and 
socio-demographic index (SDI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Ischemic heart disease was defined as acute myocardial 
infarction (MI) and chronic IHD (angina; asymptomatic IHD following MI). Cause 
of death ensemble modelling was used to produce fatality estimates. The 
prevalence of the non-fatal sequalae of IHD was estimated using DisMod MR 2.1. 
All estimates were presented as counts and age-standardized rates per 100 000 
population. In 2019, IHD accounted for 197.2 million (177.7-219.5) prevalent 
cases, 9.1 million (8.4-9.7) deaths, and 182.0 million (170.2-193.5) DALYs 
worldwide. There were decreases in the global age-standardized prevalence rates 
of IHD [-4.6% (-5.7, -3.6)], deaths [-30.8% (-34.8, -27.2)], and DALYs [-28.6% 
(-33.3, -24.2)] from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, the global prevalence and death 
rates of IHD were higher among males across all age groups, while the death rate 
peaked in the oldest group for both sexes. A negative association was found 
between the age-standardized DALY rates and SDI. Globally, high systolic blood 
pressure (54.6%), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (46.6%), and smoking 
(23.9%) were the three largest contributors to the DALYs attributable to IHD.
CONCLUSION: Although the global age-standardized prevalence, death, and DALY 
rates all decreased. Prevention and control programmes should be implemented to 
reduce population exposure to risk factors, reduce the risk of IHD in high-risk 
populations, and provide appropriate care for communities.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers among women 
worldwide. The formulation or evaluation on prevention strategies all require an 
accurate understanding of the burden for cervical cancer burden. We aimed to 
report the up-to-date estimates of cervical cancer burden at global, regional, 
and national levels.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 study. The counts, age-standardized rates, and 
percentage changes of incidence, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and 
death attributed to cervical cancer at the global, regional, and national levels 
in all 195 countries and territories from 21 regions during 2007 to 2017 by age 
and by Socio-demographic Index (SDI) were measured. All estimates were reported 
with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).
RESULTS: In 2017, 601,186 (95% UI 554,455 to 625,402) incident cases of cervical 
cancer were reported worldwide, which caused 8,061,667 (7,527,014 to 8,401,647) 
DALYs and 259,671 (241,128 to 269,214) deaths. The age-standardized rates for 
incidence, DALYs and death decreased by - 2.8% (- 7.8% to 0.6%), - 7.1% [- 11.8% 
to - 3.9%] and - 6.9% [- 11.5% to - 3.7%] from 2007 to 2017, respectively. The 
highest age-standardized incidence, DALYs and death rates in 2017 were observed 
in the low SDI quintile, Oceania, Central and Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa. During 
2007 to 2017, only East Asia showed increase in these rates despite not 
significant. At the national level, the highest age-standardized rates for 
incidence, DALYs, and death in 2017 were observed in Kiribati, Somalia, Eritrea, 
and Central African Republic; and Georgia showed the largest increases in all 
these rates during 2007 to 2017.
CONCLUSION: Although the age-standardized rates for incidence, DALYs, and death 
of cervical cancer have decreased in most parts of the world from 2007 to 2017, 
cervical cancer remains a major public health concern in view of the absolute 
number of cervical cancer cases, DALYs, and deaths increased during this period. 
The challenge is more prone to in the low SDI quintile, Oceania, Central and 
Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia, and some countries, suggesting an urgent 
to promote human papillomavirus vaccination in these regions.

BACKGROUND: To improve health outcomes to their maximum level, defining indices 
to measure healthcare quality and accessibility is crucial. In this study, we 
implemented the novel Quality of Care Index (QCI) to estimate the quality and 
accessibility of care for patients with gallbladder and biliary tract cancer 
(GBBTC) in 195 countries, 21 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) regions, 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintiles, and sex groups.
METHOD: This cross-sectional study extracted estimates on GBBTC burden from the 
GBD 2017, which presents population-based estimates on GBBTC burden for higher 
than 15-year-old patients from 1990 to 2017. Four secondary indices indicating 
quality of care were chosen, comprising Mortality to incidence, 
Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) to prevalence, prevalence to incidence, and 
years of life lost (YLL) to years lived with disability (YLD) ratios. Then, the 
whole dataset was analyzed using Principal Component Analysis to combine the 
four indices and create a single all-inclusive measure named QCI. The QCI was 
scaled to the 0-100 range, with 100 indicating the best quality of care among 
countries. Gender Disparity Ratio (GDR) was defined as the female to male QCI 
ratio to show gender inequity throughout the regions and countries.
RESULTS: Global QCI score for GBBTC was 33.5 in 2017, which has increased by 29% 
since 1990. There was a considerable gender disparity in favor of men 
(GDR = 0.74) in 2017, showing QCI has moved toward gender inequity since 1990 
(GDR = 0.85). Quality of care followed a heterogeneous pattern among regions and 
countries and was positively correlated with the countries' developmental status 
reflected in SDI (r = 0.7; CI 95%: 0.61-0.76; P value< 0.001). Accordingly, 
High-income North America (QCI = 72.4) had the highest QCI; whereas, Eastern 
Sub-Saharan Africa (QCI = 3) had the lowest QCI among regions. Patients aged 45 
to 80 had lower QCI scores than younger and older adults. The highest QCI score 
was for the older than 95 age group (QCI = 54), and the lowest was for the 50-54 
age group (QCI = 26.0).
CONCLUSIONS: QCI improved considerably from 1990 to 2017; however, it showed 
heterogeneous distribution and inequity between sex and age groups. In each 
regional context, plans from countries with the highest QCI and best gender 
equity should be disseminated and implemented in order to decrease the overall 
burden of GBBTC.

Hemophilia A is an inherited coagulation disease characterized by factor VIII 
(FVIII) deficiency and is associated with high hemorrhagic risk, especially in 
its severe forms. As the average life expectancy of patients with hemophilia has 
increased, so has the prevalence of acute coronary events. There is however 
limited experience in dealing with them. The strategy of acting on acute 
coronary events in patients with hemophilia, as demonstrated in the present 
case, is a real challenge, not only due to the need for antiplatelet therapy 
(which is essential in the prevention of stent thrombosis, but increases 
hemorrhagic risk), but also due to the lack of specific recommendations related 
to the most adequate and safe replacement therapy in these situations. The 
authors describe the case of a 48-year-old man with unstable angina and a 
previous diagnosis of severe hemophilia A who underwent percutaneous coronary 
intervention under FVIII therapy without hemorrhagic complications.

BACKGROUND: The clinical and cost-effectiveness of left ventricular assist 
device (LVAD) therapy for patients with advanced heart failure (HF) who are 
ineligible for heart transplantation is debated in the UK. This study develops 
an indirect comparison between the fully magnetically levitated HeartMate 3 (HM 
3) LVAD and medical therapy (MT) to evaluate expected clinical and 
cost-effectiveness in the UK National Health Service (NHS) context.
METHODS: We performed an economic analysis comparing the HM3 pump against the 
HeartMate II LVAD (MOMENTUM 3), and then another analysis comparing MT with the 
first- and second-generation HeartMate XVE pump LVAD and HeartMate II LVAD for 
the same patient population (REMATCH and ROADMAP, respectively). By bridging 
those 2 analyses, an indirect comparison between HM3 and MT in the form of a 
network meta-analysis was developed. A literature search was performed to select 
the most appropriate pair of studies for this purpose. Outcomes were adjusted to 
produce Kaplan-Meier curves for the cost-effectiveness evaluation by using a 
decision-analytic model. Data were extrapolated linearly over a 5-year time 
horizon. Uncertainty and additional scenarios were addressed by one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Local costs and health utility were used 
from England, thereby representing the UK context.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for LVAD vs MT in 
transplant ineligible patients with advanced HF was estimated to be £47,361 per 
quality-adjusted life year gained, with a 97.1% probability of being 
cost-effective at £50,000. In a subgroup of patients who are inotropic therapy 
dependent (INTERMACS 1-3 severity profile), the ICER was £45,616, while for a 
population with less-ill ambulatory HF (INTERMACS profile 4-7) the ICER changed 
to £64,051.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that HM3 LVAD therapy in advanced HF 
patients ineligible for heart transplantation may be cost-effective compared to 
MT in the NHS UK-England context. The ICER is lowest for patients dependent on 
inotropic support, but exceeds the willingness to pay threshold of £50,000 in 
ambulatory noninotropic therapy dependent advanced HF patients.

BACKGROUND: Palliative radiotherapy (RT) is effectively used to relieve cancer 
related symptoms. The demand for these services is increasing worldwide. Rapid 
response clinics have been developed as a means to streamline the palliative RT 
radiotherapy process and increase efficiency and improve patient experiences. 
Key components to successful rapid response palliative RT are access to care, 
streamlined services and innovation. To successfully implement a rapid response 
RT programme, it is essential to identify gaps between currently provided care 
and ideal or enhanced care. The aims of this work are to audit the current 
palliative RT workflow at our institution both prior to and during the 
coronavirus pandemic. This work reports the impact of covid-19 on rate of 
palliative RT referrals and proposes a radiographer led, MR guided rapid 
response workflow to reduce wait times METHODS: A retrospective audit of 
palliative radiotherapy booking forms was completed over a two yearperiod 
(2019-2020) to assess the current pathway both prior to and during the covid-19 
pandemic. This audit identified patients who had received urgent/emergency 
spinal RT in the specified timeframe. Further data on these patients was 
collected using departmental oncology information systems to form a detailed 
analysis of the pathway and wait times. Data was recorded and analysed using 
Microsoft Excel.
RESULTS: A total of 813 patients met the inclusion criteria for this audit. Data 
was reported for 2019 and 2020 separately to determine any significant impact 
caused by the covid-19 pandemic. In 2020 there was an 11.5% increase in 
referrals for palliative radiotherapy with an equal portion (81%) of total 
referrals in each year being for single fractions. Timelines from referral to 
treatment delivery were reported, with those patients receiving same day single 
fraction RT palliative radiotherapy undergoing further analysis to determine the 
amount of time spent in the department. Mean wait time for these patients was 5 
hours and 20 minutes in 2019 but increased by 20.9% in 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: The increasing demand for palliative RT due to rising global cancer 
rates and extended life expectancy due to advanced systemic treatments may lead 
to increased wait times. An increase in both referrals and mean wait time was 
seen during the covid-19 pandemic. Improving efficiency and access to care is 
essential for this population. The MR Linac could play a role in streamlining 
palliative RT workflows due to its ability to employ a scan, plan and treat 
model in a single session. This work forms preliminary support for the 
development of a trial one stop palliative program on the MR Linac.

BACKGROUND: The exacerbation of asthma and respiratory allergies has been 
associated with exposure to aeroallergens such as pollen. Within an urban area, 
tree cover, level of urbanization, atmospheric conditions, and the number of 
source plants can influence spatiotemporal variations in outdoor pollen 
concentrations.
OBJECTIVE: We analyze weekly pollen measurements made between March and October 
2018 over 17 sites in Toronto, Canada. The main goals are: to estimate the 
concentration of different types of pollen across the season; estimate the 
association, if any, between pollen concentration and environmental variables, 
and provide a spatiotemporal surface of concentration of different types of 
pollen across the weeks in the studied period.
METHODS: We propose an extension of the land-use regression model to account for 
the temporal variation of pollen levels and the high number of measurements 
equal to zero. Inference is performed under the Bayesian framework, and 
uncertainty of predicted values is naturally obtained through the posterior 
predictive distribution.
RESULTS: Tree pollen was positively associated with commercial areas and tree 
cover, and negatively associated with grass cover. Both grass and weed pollen 
were positively associated with industrial areas and TC brightness and 
negatively associated with the northing coordinate. The total pollen was 
associated with a combination of these environmental factors. Predicted surfaces 
of pollen concentration are shown at some sampled weeks for all pollen types.
SIGNIFICANCE: The predicted surfaces obtained here can help future 
epidemiological studies to find possible associations between pollen levels and 
some health outcome like respiratory allergies at different locations within the 
study area.

The aim of this study was to examine the combined effects of thyme essential oil 
(TEO) and prebiotic (Immunogen ®) on growth performance, hematological 
parameters, innate immunity, and oxidative status of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus 
mykiss. For this purpose, the fish (11.92 ± 0.06 g) were fed (3% of biomass) 
experimental diets that contained 0 (Control; without Immunogen and/or TEO); 1% 
TEO + 0.1% Immunogen (T1); 1% TEO + 0.2% Immunogen (T2); 2% TEO + 0.1% Immunogen 
(T3) and 2% TEO + 0.2% Immunogen (T4) for 60 days. According to results, all 
experimental treatments exhibited similar final weight, weight gain, specific 
growth rate (SGR), and survival rate (SR), which were significantly higher than 
those of the control treatment. Although all treatments reduced the feed 
conversion ratio (FCR) compared to the control group, the lowest value was 
observed in T4. All experimental treatments showed a significant increase in 
amylase and protease activity compared to the control group. Moreover, the fish 
fed on T4 and T1 diets showed the highest and lowest lipase activity. Dietary 
TEO and Immunogen supplementations significantly increased WBC count and Hb 
level compared to the control group. Fish fed on control and T2 diets displayed 
lower hematocrit than fish fed on other experimental diets. The highest and 
lowest MCH index were recorded in T3 and control groups, respectively. The fish 
fed diets supplemented with T3 diet presented significantly higher MCV index 
compared to the control and T2 treatment. All experimental treatments exhibited 
similar AST, and ALP activities, which were significantly lower than those of 
the control group. Also, the lowest ALT activity was observed in T2 and T4 
treatments compared to other groups. Dietary TEO and Immunogen supplementations 
significantly enhanced skin mucus total Ig, total protein level, and ACH50, 
protease, and lysozyme. All experimental treatments exhibited enhanced intestine 
total Ig, ACH50, and lysozyme level. Dietary thyme essential oil and Immunogen 
supplementations significantly enhanced liver antioxidant parameters including 
catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and 
superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreased MDA production compared to fish fed on 
control diet. As a result, it can be suggested that the combination of thyme 
essential oil and Immunogen (specially 2% TEO + 0.2% Immunogen) is useful for 
enhancing the yield and well-being of farmed rainbow trout.

BACKGROUND: It is estimated that there are 101 million older care-dependent 
people (60+). This group is expected to double by 2050 due to the ageing of the 
world's population and the rise in life expectancy. Although people tend to live 
longer, there is little evidence that they live their later years in better 
health. In the future, this might put even more stress on an already 
overburdened acute care health system. Hospitals therefore need to focus on 
preventive measures to avoid rehospitalisation of older people. Family 
participation could be part of the solution.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to gain insight into the preferences of family 
caregivers, patients and nurses towards family caregivers taking up care tasks 
during hospitalisation, after receiving education.
METHODS: Data were collected using a cross-sectional survey of nursing staff, 
family caregivers and older patients in nine wards for older people within three 
hospitals. Data collection ran from October 2019 till March 2020 using a 
questionnaire of 25 care tasks with three answer options (perform alone, 
together with a nurse, do not perform). A consecutive sample of 330 patients and 
133 family caregivers (81 dyads could be formed) next to a convenience sample of 
67 nurses was obtained.
RESULTS: Patients (65%) are more prepared to let their family caregiver perform 
tasks alone than family caregivers (59%) and nurses (52%). Only few patients 
(3.8%) and family caregivers (13%) prefer the family caregiver to perform a task 
together with a nurse. The latter answer thus rather dichotomously, while nurses 
answer more dynamically over the three answer options. Of all family caregivers, 
50% indicate willingness and ability to perform tasks on a regular basis. 
Significant correlations indicate that patients, family caregivers and nurses 
agree on which care tasks would be more preferable to be performed by a family 
caregiver. Looking at the dyads, preferences of a patient are not suspected to
