and those with muscle impairments/weakness has been a goal for exoskeleton 
designers for decades. In this work, we discover that significant reductions in 
the energy cost required for walking can be achieved with almost 50% less 
mechanical power compared to the state of the art. This was achieved by 
leveraging human-in-the-loop optimization to understand the importance of 
individualized assistance for hip flexion, a relatively unexplored joint motion. 
Specifically, we show that a tethered hip flexion exosuit can reduce the 
metabolic rate of walking by up to 15.2 ± 2.6%, compared to locomotion with 
assistance turned off (equivalent to 14.8% reduction compared to not wearing the 
exosuit). This large metabolic reduction was achieved with surprisingly low 
assistance magnitudes (average of 89 N, ~ 24% of normal hip flexion torque). 
Furthermore, the ratio of metabolic reduction to the positive exosuit power 
delivered was 1.8 times higher than ratios previously found for hip extension 
and ankle plantarflexion. These findings motivated the design of a lightweight 
(2.31 kg) and portable hip flexion assisting exosuit, that demonstrated a 7.2 ± 
2.9% metabolic reduction compared to walking without the exosuit. The high ratio 
of metabolic reduction to exosuit power measured in this study supports previous 
simulation findings and provides compelling evidence that hip flexion may be an 
efficient joint motion to target when considering how to create practical and 
lightweight wearable robots to support improved mobility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) substantially contributes to the burden of mental 
disorders. Improved awareness and changes in diagnostic criteria of ASD may have 
influenced the diagnostic rates of ASD. However, while data on trends in 
diagnostic rates in some individual countries have been published, updated 
estimates of diagnostic rate trends and ASD-related disability at the global 
level are lacking. Here, we used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study data to address this gap, focusing on changes in prevalence, 
incidence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of ASD across the world. 
From 1990 to 2019, overall age-standardized estimates remained stable globally. 
Both prevalence and DALYs increased in countries with high socio-demographic 
index (SDI). However, the age-standardized incidence decreased in some low SDI 
countries, indicating a need to improve awareness. The male/female ratio 
decreased between 1990 and 2019, possibly accounted for by increasing clinical 
attention to ASD in females. Our results suggest that ASD detection in low SDI 
countries is suboptimal, and that ASD prevention/treatment in countries with 
high SDI should be improved, considering the increasing prevalence of the 
disorder. Additionally, growing attention is being paid to ASD diagnosis in 
females, who might have been left behind by ASD epidemiologic and clinical 
research previously. ASD burden estimates are underestimated as GBD does not 
account for mortality in ASD.

INTRODUCTION: Multiple studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of 
pharmacokinetic (PK)-guided individualized prophylaxis with human coagulation 
factor VIII (FVIII) compared with standard prophylaxis, but no studies have 
evaluated the economics of PK-guided prophylaxis in China. Hence, we conducted 
this study to assess the cost-effectiveness of PK-guided prophylaxis with 
recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) versus standard prophylaxis in Chinese adult patients 
with severe hemophilia A.
METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was developed to simulate 10,000 
patients with hemophilia A who received rFVIII treatment over a 1-year time 
horizon. The standard prophylaxis rFVIII dose was 30 IU/kg by intravenous 
injection. The PK-guided prophylaxis dosage was adjusted for each patient to 
maintain FVIII trough level at 1-5 IU/dL. Dosing interval for both approaches 
was kept fixed at 48 h. The health outcomes included annual joint bleed rate 
(AJBR) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The model considered the costs 
of drug. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated and scenario 
analysis was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 94.3% of patients receiving PK-guided individualized 
prophylaxis achieved the goal of maintaining the trough concentration at 
1-5 IU/dL compared with 62.7% on standard prophylaxis. AJBR and QALYs gained in 
PK-guided and standard prophylaxis were 1.527 vs 1.601, and 0.8384 vs 0.8383, 
respectively. Costs of drug prophylaxis and costs of treatment for bleeding 
events in PK-guided prophylaxis (148,641.47 USD; 4546.43 USD) were lower than 
those in standard prophylaxis (159,620.93 USD; 4753.39 USD). An average saving 
of USD 11,186.47 was obtained by the PK-guided approach. The prophylaxis 
treatment scenarios were the most influential factors.
CONCLUSION: PK-guided individualized prophylaxis appeared to be a dominant 
treatment compared with standard prophylaxis, with slightly higher QALYs but 
lower total costs.

Regular transfusion and chelation therapy produces increased life expectancy in 
thalassaemic patients who may develop new complications. Since few data are 
available regarding hypercalciuria in β-thalassaemia major (TM), the aim of our 
study was to evaluate its prevalence, risk factors and clinical consequences. We 
enrolled 176 adult TM patients followed at the Center of Thalassemia of Ferrara. 
Hypercalciuria was defined by a calciuria of 4 mg/kg/day or more in a 24-h urine 
sample. Anamnestic, biochemical and radiological data were collected. 
Hypercalciuria prevalence was reported in 69.3% of patients (females 52.5%). 
Hypercalciuric (HC) patients used deferasirox (DFX) more often than 
normocalciuric (NC) patients (47.5% vs 29.6%; p < 0.05). In HC subjects plasma 
parathyroid hormone (PTH) (24.1 ± 10.4 vs 30.1 ± 13.2 pg/ml) and phosphate 
levels (3.6 ± 0.5 vs 3.8 ± 0.7 mg/dl) were lower, whereas serum calcium 
(9.6 ± 0.4 vs 9.4 ± 0.4 mg/dl) and urinary 24-h phosphaturia (0.9 ± 0.4 vs 
0.6 ± 0.3 g/day) were higher as compared to NC patients (p < 0.05 for all 
comparisons). Supplementation with oral calcium and cholecalciferol was similar 
between the groups. A higher rate of kidney stones was present in HC (14.8%) 
versus NC patients (3.7%) (p < 0.05). Hypercalciuria is a frequent complication 
in adequately treated adult TM patients. Hypercalciuria prevalence is increased 
in DFX users whereas haemoglobin level or calcium supplements play no role. A 
significant proportion of HC patients developed kidney stones.

BACKGROUND: Glatiramer acetate (GA) is US-approved for relapsing multiple 
sclerosis.
OBJECTIVES: To describe GA long-term clinical profile. To compare effectiveness 
of early start (ES) versus delayed start (DS; up to 3 years) with GA.
METHODS: Phase 3 trial participants entered a randomized placebo-controlled 
period then an open-label extension (OLE) with GA.
RESULTS: Overall, 208 out of 251 (82.9%) randomized participants entered the 
OLE; 24 out of 101 (23.8%, ES) and 28 out of 107 (26.2%, DS) participants 
completed the OLE. Median GA treatment was 9.8 (0.1-26.3) years. Annualized 
change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was lower with ES versus 
DS (p = 0.0858: full study; p = 0.002; Year 5). Participants with 
improved/stable EDSS was consistently higher with ES versus DS: 40.3% versus 
31.6% (p = 0.1590; full study); 70.8% versus 55.6% (p = 0.015; Year 5). ES 
prolonged time-to-6-month confirmed disease worsening (CDW) versus DS (9.8 vs 
6.7 years), time-to-12-month CDW (18.9 vs 11.6 years), and significantly reduced 
time-to-second-6-month CDW (p = 0.0441). No new safety concerns arose.
CONCLUSION: GA long-term treatment maintained clinical benefit with a similar 
safety profile to phase 3 results; a key limitation was that only 25% of 
participants completed the OLE. Early initiation of GA had sustained benefits 
versus delayed treatment.

BACKGROUND: As Turner syndrome (TS) predisposes to obesity and metabolic 
disorders, and their complications, such as cardiovascular diseases, are the 
main causes of shortened life expectancy in patients with TS, new metabolic 
markers that could serve as early predictors of dysmetabolic state are sought.
OBJECTIVE: Assessment of MMP-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1), MMP-2 (matrix 
metalloproteinase-2), MMP-9 (matrix metallopeptidase-9), BDNF (brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor), GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), and 
VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) before the onset of growth hormone 
(GH) therapy and then during GH treatment as well as markers assessment during 
GH medication in girls with TS to establish marker stability and repeatability, 
and the impact of GH on markers concentration.
METHOD: The concentrations of circulating MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, BDNF, GDNF, and 
VEGF were measured in nine girls with TS before the onset of GH therapy and then 
after at least 3 months of treatment period. Subsequently, markers concentration 
was determined in 17 girls during GH medication, with the first determination 
after at least a 3-month treatment period. The patients' clinical and 
biochemical phenotypes were determined by weight, height, BMI, total 
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose concentration.
RESULTS: Comparison of markers concentration revealed a significantly higher 
concentration of MMP-2 in patients undergoing GH treatment (132.1 ± 42.05) than 
before the onset of therapy (105.0 ± 45.5, p=0.045). The values of the first 
measurement of VEGF in girls with TS undergoing GH therapy were significantly 
higher than those during the second measurement (30.9 ± 33.4 vs. 12.5 ± 11.7, 
p=0.029). There were no statistically significant differences between the 
measurements of the remaining markers concentration at any stage of the 
analysis.
CONCLUSION: Increase in MMP-2 concentration is visible during GH therapy in 
comparison to the pre-GH period in girls with TS which demands confirmation in 
subsequent tests. The role of VEGF requires further studies in the context of 
carbohydrate-lipid disturbances in girls with TS and its association with GH 
treatment.

For the past century, life expectancy in industrialized countries has increased, 
and the U.S. has shared in that progress. However, beginning in the 1980s, 
advances in U.S. life expectancy began to lose pace with peer countries. By 
1998, U.S. life expectancy had fallen below the average for Organisation for 
Economic Cooperation and Development nations. U.S. life expectancy peaked in 
2014 and has been decreasing for three consecutive years, a trend not been seen 
since the influenza pandemic a century ago. Put simply, U.S. health is in 
decline.

Interpretation of Online Artworks of Digital Art Design in the New Media 
Environment.

In order to realize the interpretation of online artworks, the art design of 
artworks is studied on the basis of new media digital environment. Through the 
presentation of digital works, the enhancement of dramatic art appreciation, the 
balanced display of art appreciation, and the enhancement of digital aesthetic 
creation, the interpretation of artworks has been successfully completed, which 
strongly supports the digitization of new media. Art design is to constantly 
breed an updated online art space and attract and summon more viewers' new 
experience, new creation, and new perception so as to trigger and develop new 
propositions, new exploration, and new atmosphere of new media drama. For the 
current construction of traditional art design, new media digital technology 
plays a major role. The transformation of digital technology and Internet media 
is another "holographic" extension of the human body, which has an extremely 
strong impact on new media art and comprehensively updated our life, art, and 
aesthetic concepts. This is not only a revolution of media but also a change of 
art. At the same time, it is also accompanied by the "expansion" of art theory. 
What this change ultimately needs to complete is the revolution of media culture 
that affects the development process of human civilization.

Root Causes of Appalachia's Deaths of Despair.

Scutchfield FD.

The U.S. is experiencing a decline in life expectancy, particularly among rural 
white males in their most productive years. Appalachia is disproportionally 
represented in mortality rates, accounting for 30% of the U.S. population, but 
50% of the excess mortality attributed to the "deaths of despair": drug 
overdose, suicide, and alcoholic cirrhosis. A substantial proportion of that 
excess mortality is related to the current opioid crisis we are experiencing. We 
have data on evidence-based solutions to the treatment of addiction, but little 
information on prevention of addiction as well as the other deaths of despair, 
likely with the same etiologic agent. We must focus on finding the root cause of 
the current epidemic, so that we can prevent this devastating mortality.

The inception of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has changed the 
management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients, with an 
improvement in life expectancy. However, neurological complications associated 
with high dosage and chronic administration of HAART have not been fully 
addressed. Therefore, this study evaluated the potential benefits of silver 
nanoparticles (AgNPs) conjugated-HAART (HAART-AgNPs) and its interaction with 
neuronal and glial cells in type-2 diabetic rats. Forty-two (n = 42) adult male 
Sprague-Dawley rats (250 ± 13 g) were divided into non-diabetic and diabetic 
groups. Each rat was administered with either distilled water, HAART, or 
HAART-AgNPs for eight weeks. After that, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was excised 
for immunohistochemical, biochemical, and ultrastructural analysis. The 
formulated HAART-AgNPs were characterised by Ultraviolet-Visible, Transmission 
electron microscope, Energy Dispersive X-ray and Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy. Of the various concentrations of HAART-AgNPs, 1.5 M exhibited 
20.3 nm in size and a spherical shape was used for this study. Administration of 
HAART-AgNPs to diabetic rats significantly decreased (p < 0.05) blood glucose 
level, number of faecal pellets, malondialdehyde (MDA), tumour necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) compared with HAART-treated 
diabetic rats. Notably, there was a significant increase (p < 0.05) in 
antioxidant biomarkers (SOD and GSH), improvement in PFC-glial fibrillary acid 
protein (PFC-GFAP) positive cells and alleviation of anxiety-like behaviour in 
HAART-AgNPs treated diabetic rats. These results showed that HAART-AgNPs 
alleviates the anxiogenic effect and neuronal toxicity aggravated by HAART 
exposure via the reduction of oxidative and neuroinflammatory injury as well as 
preserving PFC GFAP-positive cells and neuronal cytoarchitecture.

Roanoke's Collective Public Health Activities.

Lytton M.

Roanoke is addressing problems that confront many small and medium sized cities 
in the U.S., especially disparities in health and life expectancy between 
neighborhoods. These disparities are often legacies of decades of racial and 
economic segregation, resulting in low-income or disinvested communities. 
Typically, such neighborhoods have fewer parks, higher vacancy rates and less 
stable affordable housing stock, inadequate public transit systems, too few 
clinics, too many fast food restaurants and insufficient access to high quality 
schools. In Roanoke these are the northwest and southeast quadrants, both 
federally designated Medically Underserved Areas, and characterized by a large 
proportion of the city's low-income individuals and families who may be 
uninsured, underinsured and/or Medicaid recipients.

A Virginia Mountain City Responds to the Challenge of Improving Health Outcomes.

Cowell RS Jr(1).

Author information:
(1)City of Roanoke, Virginia, bob.cowell@roanokeva.gov.

In 2012, Roanoke Virginia was becoming a city of haves and have-nots, a place 
where many were benefitting from revitalization underway but too many were 
seeing their situation grow worse and becoming even more entrenched. Poverty 
with levels as high as 50% in some neighborhoods; life expectancy sometimes 14 
years shorter than those living just one or two neighborhoods over; and lack of 
access to fresh food, medical care, and economic opportunities-all within view 
of the largest hospital in the region was unacceptable.

BACKGROUND: Poor medication adherence among patients with Chronic Diseases is 
one of the significant health problems globally. Despite this, evidence on 
chronic medication adherence in low and middle-income countries is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to identify factors influencing poor 
medication adherence amongst patients with chronic diseases in low and 
middle-income countries.
METHODS: We searched studies exploring factors influencing poor medication 
adherence amongst patients in low and middle-income countries across the 
following databases published between 2008 to 2018: Public or publisher Medline, 
Google scholar, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Health 
Source, and Medline with full text via Elton B. Stephen's Company host. 
Methodological quality assessment of the primary studies was done as recommended 
by Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien (2010) review using a Mixed-Method Appraisal 
Tool 2018. We reported the results following the Preferred Reporting Item for 
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Review guidelines.
RESULTS: From the initial 154 records screened, we identified six (6) eligible 
studies that presented evidence on factors influencing poor medication adherence 
amongst patients in low and middle-income countries. Studies included were from 
the following countries: Jordan, South Africa, Guatemala, Ethiopia, Indonesia, 
India, and Palestine. Kappa agreement of the full article screening shows that 
there was 76.92% agreement versus 58.12% expected by chance which constitutes a 
considerably good agreement between screeners (Kappa statistic = 0.45 and 
p-value <0.05). Of the six included studies that underwent methodological 
quality, five scored 100%, which is regarded as the highest score the remaining 
one scored between 50-75%, indicating a moderate to low risk bias overall. All 
included studies presented evidence on medication adherence as being in either 
knowledge of the diseases, attitudes towards medication taking, beliefs that a 
patient holds about the treatment or disease, and quality control amongst 
chronic diseases patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our scoping review provides evidence that poor medication adherence 
in LMICs is influenced by a lack of knowledge, negative attitudes, and negative 
beliefs, leading to poor quality of life. There is limited research evidence on 
the effect of patients' beliefs and perceptions on medication adherence in low 
and middle-income countries. We call upon further research on beliefs, 
perceptions, and effectiveness of interventions towards chronic medication 
adherence in low and middle-income countries.

Due to the increase in cancer among young women, the risk of premature ovarian 
insufficiency with subsequent infertility has been raised. Fertility 
preservation restores reproductive potential along with increasing life 
expectancy in these patients. Given the articles on new options for treating 
cancerous women, we searched the keywords, including fertility preservation, in 
vitro maturation (IVM), and ovarian cryopreservation. This review focuses on the 
currently available procedures, including in (IVM) of retrieved immature 
oocytes, oocyte, embryo, and ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC). OTC is a 
helpful procedure that restores ovarian function and natural pregnancy. Also, we 
summarized the literature that reported the qualification of using the 
abovementioned procedures, comparing the cryopreservation methods including 
vitrification and slow freezing. Due to the impressive clinical development of 
OTC in cancerous patients, it is recommended as a standard treatment in 
cryopreservation strategies.

The project "Audiovisual production and vital strategies" interwove art, life, 
academic research, and activism with decolonial feminist perspectives. It was 
carried out as part of an audiovisual laboratory with students from the Federal 
State University of Rio de Janeiro and Casa Nem, a squatters' settlement, 
cultural and educational project in Rio de Janeiro led by transgender people in 
situations of high social vulnerability. The audiovisual Lab was facilitated by 
a group of artists and educators, and the majority of project participants were 
Black people who identified as trans* or LGBTQIA+. We worked with critical and 
emancipatory pedagogies that allowed the impacts of each participants racialized 
and gendered life experiences to guide the entire creative processes. The 
project's creative processes were inspired by bodywork dynamics from the field 
of performance art, and focused on uncovering profound dialogues and depths in 
each participant's life narratives. In this essay, we reflect critically on 
aesthetic choices and modes of creation. Through our discussion of the images 
and processes as a whole, we discuss how reimagining the encounter between 
pedagogy and audiovisual production established new modes of mediating 
relationships inside and outside of the university, and connect these processes 
to broader questions of health promotion.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC), as the top neoplasm in prevalence and mortality 
in females, imposes a heavy burden on health systems. Evaluation of quality of 
care and management of patients with BC and its responsible risk factors was the 
aim of this study.
METHODS: We retrieved epidemiologic data of BC from the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) 1990-2019 database. Epidemiology and burden of BC and its risk factors 
were explored besides the Quality of Care Index (QCI) introduced before, to 
assess the provided care for patients with BC in various scales. Provided care 
for BC risk factors was investigated by their impact on years of life lost and 
years lived with disability by a novel risk factor quality index (rQCI). We used 
the socio-demographic index (SDI) to compare results in different socio-economic 
levels.
RESULTS: In 2019, 1,977,212 (95% UI: 1,807,615-2,145,215) new cases of BC in 
females and 25,143 (22,231-27,786) in males was diagnosed and this major cancer 
caused 688,562 (635,323-739,571) deaths in females and 12,098 (10,693-13,322) 
deaths in males, globally. The all-age number of deaths and disability-adjusted 
life years attributed to BC risk factors in females had an increasing pattern, 
with a more prominent pattern in metabolic risks. The global estimated 
age-standardized QCI for BC in females in 2019 was 78.7. The estimated QCI was 
highest in high SDI regions (95.7). The top countries with the highest 
calculated QCI in 2019 were Iceland (100), Japan (99.8), and Finland (98.8), and 
the bottom countries were Mozambique (16.0), Somalia (8.2), and Central African 
Republic (5.3). The global estimated age-standardized rQCI for females was 82.2 
in 2019.
CONCLUSION: In spite of the partially restrained burden of BC in recent years, 
the attributable burden to risk factors has increased remarkably. Countries with 
higher SDI provided better care regarding both the condition and its responsible 
risk factors.

Decision models can combine information from different sources to simulate the 
long-term consequences of alternative strategies in the presence of uncertainty. 
A cohort state-transition model (cSTM) is a decision model commonly used in 
medical decision making to simulate the transitions of a hypothetical cohort 
among various health states over time. This tutorial focuses on time-independent 
cSTM, in which transition probabilities among health states remain constant over 
time. We implement time-independent cSTM in R, an open-source mathematical and 
statistical programming language. We illustrate time-independent cSTMs using a 
previously published decision model, calculate costs and effectiveness outcomes, 
and conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of multiple strategies, including a 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We provide open-source code in R to 
facilitate wider adoption. In a second, more advanced tutorial, we illustrate 
time-dependent cSTMs.

OBJECTIVES: Minimal extrathyroid extension (mETE) was removed from the TNM 
staging system. This study was designed prospectively to compare the safety and 
efficacy of microwave ablation (MWA) versus surgery for treating T1N0M0 
papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) with sonographically detected mETE.
METHODS: From December 2019 to April 2021, 198 patients with T1N0M0 mETE-PTCs 
evaluated by preoperative ultrasound from 10 hospitals were included. Ninety-two 
patients elected MWA, and 106 patients elected surgery for treatment. MWA was 
performed using extensive ablation with hydrodissection. Surgery consisted of 
lobectomy with ipsilateral central lymph node dissection (CLD), lobe and isthmus 
excision with ipsilateral CLD and total thyroidectomy with ipsilateral CLD. The 
rates of technical success, cost, oncologic outcomes, complications and quality 
of life of the two groups were assessed.
RESULTS: The follow-up times for the MWA and surgery groups were 12.7 ± 4.1 and 
12.6 ± 5.0 months, respectively. The technical success rate was 100% for both 
groups. Oncological outcomes of the two groups were similar during the follow-up 
(all p > 0.05). The MWA group had a shorter operation time, less blood loss and 
lower costs (all p < 0.001). Three complications (3.3%) were reported in the MWA 
group and 4 (3.8%) in the surgery group (p = 0.846). The surgery group had 
higher scores for scar problems and anxiety (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Microwave ablation was comparable in the short term to surgery in 
terms of treatment safety and efficacy in selected patients with T1N0M0 mETE-PTC 
detected by ultrasound.
KEY POINTS: • Microwave ablation is comparable to surgery in the safety and 
short-term efficacy for PTCs with sonographically detected mETE. • Thermal 
ablation is technically feasible for mETE-PTC treatment. • Patients with 
mETE-PTC have similar quality of life in the two groups, except for worse scar 
problems and anxiety in the surgery group.
