BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic inequalities in life expectancy have been shown among 
the middle aged and the youngest of the old individuals, but the situation in 
the oldest old is less clear. The aim of this study was to investigate trends in 
life expectancy at ages 85, 90 and 95 years by education in Norway in the period 
1961-2009.
METHODS: This was a register-based population study including all residents in 
Norway aged 85 and over. Individual-level data were provided by the Central 
Population Register and the National Education Database. For each decade during 
1961-2009, death rates by 1-year age groups were calculated separately for each 
sex and three educational categories. Annual life tables were used to calculate 
life expectancy at ages 85 (e85), 90 (e90) and 95 (e95).
RESULTS: Educational differentials in life expectancy at each age were 
non-significant in the early decades, but became significant over time. For 
example, for the decade 2000-9, a man aged 90 years with primary education had a 
life expectancy of 3.4 years, while a man with tertiary education could expect 
to live for 3.8 years. Similar numbers in women were 4.1 and 4.5 years, 
respectively. Even among 95-year-old men, statistically significant differences 
in life expectancy were found by education in the two last decades.
CONCLUSION: Education matters regarding remaining life expectancy also for the 
oldest old in Norway. Life expectancy at these ages is low, so a growth of 0.5 
years in the life expectancy differential is sizeable.

Microbiological, chemical and sensory changes of sea bass slices wrapped with 
fish protein isolate (FPI)/fish skin gelatin (FSG) films incorporated with 3 % 
ZnO nanoparticles (ZnONP) (w/w, based on protein content) and 100 % basil leaf 
essential oil (BEO) (w/w, based on protein content) during storage of 12 days at 
4 °C were investigated. Sea bass slices wrapped with FPI/FSG-ZnONP-BEO film had 
the lowest growth of psychrophilic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and spoilage 
microorganisms including Pseudomonas , H2S-producing bacteria and 
Enterobacteriaceae throughout storage of 12 days in comparison with those 
wrapped with FPI/FSG-BEO, FPI/FSG-ZnONP, FPI/FSG film, polypropylene film (PP 
film) and the control (without wrapping), respectively (P < 0.05). Lowered 
increases in pH, total volatile base, peroxide value and TBARS value were found 
in FPI/FSG-ZnO-BEO film wrapped samples, compared with others (P < 0.05). 
Sensory evaluation revealed that shelf-life of sea bass slices was longest for 
samples wrapped with FPI/FSG-ZnONP-BEO film (12 days), as compared to the 
control (6 days) (P < 0.05).

Efficacy of mint (Mentha arvensis) leaf and citrus (Citrus aurantium) peel 
extracts in retarding the quality changes in Indian mackerel during chilled 
storage was investigated. Mint leaf extract showed higher quantity of phenolics 
and superior in-vitro antioxidant activities than citrus peel extract. Gutted 
mackerel were given a dip treatment in mint extract (0.5 %, w/v) and citrus 
extract (1 % w/v), packed in LDPE pouches and stored at 0-2 °C. The biochemical 
quality indices viz. total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N), trimethylamine 
nitrogen (TMA-N), free fattyacids (FFA) were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in 
mint extract (ME) treated fishes compared to citrus extract (CE) treated and 
control fishes (C) without any treatment. Plant extract treatment significantly 
inhibited lipid oxidation in mackerel as indicated by peroxide value (PV) and 
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Aerobic plate count (APC) was 
markedly higher in C group followed by CE group throughout the storage period. 
As per sensory evaluation, shelf life of Indian mackerel was determined to be 
11-13 days for C group, 13-15 days for CE group and 16-17 days for ME group, 
during storage at 0-2 °C.

Functional deficits due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) can have significant and 
enduring consequences upon patients' life quality and expectancy. Although 
functional neuroimaging is essential for understanding TBI pathophysiology, an 
insufficient amount of effort has been dedicated to the task of translating 
functional neuroimaging findings into information with clinical utility. The 
purpose of this review is to summarize the use of functional neuroimaging 
techniques - especially functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor 
imaging, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and 
electroencephalography - for advancing current knowledge of TBI-related brain 
dysfunction and for improving the rehabilitation of TBI patients. We focus on 
seven core areas of functional deficits, namely consciousness, motor function, 
attention, memory, higher cognition, personality, and affect, and, for each of 
these, we summarize recent findings from neuroimaging studies which have 
provided substantial insight into brain function changes due to TBI. 
Recommendations are also provided to aid in setting the direction of future 
neuroimaging research and for understanding brain function changes after TBI.

BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal and liver diseases (GILD) constitute a noteworthy 
portion of causes of death and disability in Iran. However, data on their 
prevalence and burden is sparse in Iran. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
study in 2010 has provided invaluable comprehensive data on the burden of GILD 
in Iran. METHODS Estimations of death, years of life lost due to premature death 
(YLL), years of life lost due to disability (YLD), disability-adjusted life 
years (DALY), life expectancy, and healthy life expectancy have been reported 
for 291 diseases, 67 risk factors, 1160 sequelae, for both sexes and 19 age 
groups, form 1990 to 2010 for 187 countries. In the current paper, 5 major 
categories of gastrointestinal (GI) and liver diseases have been investigated as 
follows: GI infectious diseases, GI and liver cancers, liver infections, chronic 
end stage liver disease, and other digestive diseases. RESULTS Among women, 7.6% 
of all deaths and 3.9% of all DALYs were due to digestive and liver diseases in 
2010. The respective figures in men were 7.8% of deaths and 4.6% of DALYs. The 
most important cause of death among children under 5 is diarrhea. Among adults 
between 15 to 49 years old, the main causes of death are GI and liver cancers 
and cirrhosis, while diarrhea still remains a major cause of DALY. Among adults 
50 years and above, GI and liver cancers and cirrhosis are the main causes of 
both deaths and DALYs. Gastritis and duodenitis, diarrheal diseases, gall 
bladder and bile duct diseases, acute hepatitis A, peptic ulcer disease, 
appendicitis, and acute hepatitis A mainly cause disability rather than death. 
CONCLUSION GBD study provides invaluable source of data on burden of GILD in 
Iran. However, there exist limitations, namely overestimation of burden of liver 
cancer and underestimation of the burden of GI diseases that are usually 
diagnosed in outpatient settings. The collaboration of scientists across the 
world and specifically those from developing countries is necessary for 
improving the accuracy of future updates of GBD in these countries.

Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) affects nearly half of patients with diabetes. 
The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of starting 
patients with PDN on pregabalin (PRE), duloxetine (DUL), gabapentin (GABA), or 
desipramine (DES) over a 10-year time horizon from the perspective of 
third-party payers in the United States. A Markov model was used to compare the 
costs (2013 $US) and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) of 
first-line PDN treatments in 10,000 patients using microsimulation. Costs and 
QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. Probabilities and utilities were derived 
from the published literature. Costs were average wholesale price for drugs and 
national estimates for office visits and hospitalizations. One-way and 
probabilistic (PSA) sensitivity analyses were used to examine parameter 
uncertainty. Starting with PRE was dominated by DUL as DUL cost less and was 
more effective. Starting with GABA was extendedly dominated by a combination of 
DES and DUL. DES and DUL cost $23,468 and $25,979, while yielding 3.05 and 3.16 
QALYs, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for DUL compared 
with DES was $22,867/QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that the 
model was most sensitive to the adherence threshold and utility for mild pain. 
PSA showed that, at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $50,000/QALY, DUL was the most 
cost-effective option in 56.3% of the simulations, DES in 29.2%, GABA in 14.4%, 
and PRE in 0.1%. Starting with DUL is the most cost-effective option for PDN 
when WTP is greater than $22,867/QALY. Decision makers may consider starting 
with DUL for PDN patients.

The onset of symptoms of heart failure is a landmark in the natural history of 
aortic stenosis, and is associated with a dramatic reduction in survival. Aortic 
valve replacement markedly increases life-expectancy in such patients. However, 
the presence of heart failure and/or left ventricular dysfunction are strong 
predictors of poor acute and late mortality after cardiac surgery and the most 
frequent conditions leading to deny surgical aortic valve replacement in elderly 
patients. The last decade has witnessed the development of transcatheter aortic 
valve implantation (TAVI) and, consequently, the resurgence of percutaneous 
balloon aortic valvuloplasty (PBAV) and, both, are currently routine therapy for 
high-risk patients. These minimally invasive procedures are appealing 
therapeutic options for the subset of patients with heart failure and or/left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction. The available evidence on the results of PBAV 
and TAVI therapies in this setting is discussed and a management strategy is 
proposed.

BACKGROUND: Snakebite envenoming (SBE) is a major problem in rural areas of West 
Africa (WA). Compared to other Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD), the public 
health burden of SBE has not been well characterized. We estimated the impact of 
snakebite mortality and morbidity using the Disability Adjusted Life Years 
(DALYs) metrics for 16 countries in WA.
METHODS: We used the reported annual number of SB deaths and mean age at time of 
SB and converted these into years of life lost (YLL). Similarly, the years of 
life lived with disability (YLD) were estimated by multiplying the number of 
amputations by the respective disability weight of 0.13.
RESULTS: In WA, the annual cases of SB mortality and amputations ranged from 24 
(95% Confidence Interval: 19-29) and 28 (17-48) respectively in Guinea-Bissau 
with the highest estimates of 1927 (1529-2333) and 2368 (1506-4043) respectively 
in Nigeria. We calculated that the annual DALYs associated with a SB death 
ranged from 1550 DALYs (95%CI: 1227-1873 DALYs) in Guinea Bissau to 124,484 
DALYs (95%CI: 98,773-150,712 DALYs) in Nigeria. The annual DALYs associated with 
amputation for the two countries were 149 DALYs (95%CI: 91-256 DALYs) and 12,621 
DALYs (95%CI: 8027-21,549 DALYs) respectively. The total burden of SBE was 
estimated at 319,874 DALYs (95% CI: 248,357-402,654 DALYs) in the 16 countries 
in WA. These estimates are similar, and in some instances even higher, than for 
other NTDs encountered in WA (e.g., Buruli ulcer, Echinococcosis, Intestinal 
Nematode Infections, Leishmaniasis, Onchocerchiasis, Trachoma and 
Trypanosomiasis) as reported in the Global Burden of Diseases 2010 (GBD).
CONCLUSIONS: The public health burden of SBE in WA is very substantial and 
similar to other more widely recognized NTDs. Efforts and funding commensurate 
with its burden should be made available for the control of snakebite in the 
sub-region.

Juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an aggressive multisystem 
autoimmune disease. Despite improvements in outcomes for adult patients, 
children with SLE continue to have a lower life expectancy than adults with SLE, 
with more aggressive disease, a higher incidence of lupus nephritis and there is 
an emerging awareness of their increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
In this review, we discuss the evidence for an increased risk of CVD in SLE, its 
pathogenesis, and the clinical approach to its management.

Susan D. McCammon and Nicole M. Piemonte offer a thoughtful and thorough 
commentary on our manuscript entitled "Expanding the use of Continuous Sedation 
Until Death." In this reply we attempt to clarify and further defend our 
position. We show how continuous sedation until death is not a "first resort" 
but rather a legitimate option among many that should available to terminally 
ill patients whose life expectancy is less than six months. We also attempt to 
show that we do not equivocate the meaning of palliative care as the 
commentators suggested. We argue that the traditional notion of palliative care 
should move beyond relief of "experienced suffering" to relief of potential 
suffering for those whose life expectancy is less than six months. Lastly, we 
challenge the commentator's position that the realm of ordinary medicine" should 
be the guide to care, by showing how the notion of ordinary medicine has been 
successfully challenged in both bioethical scholarship and the courts in a way 
that shows ordinary medicine to be an evolving concept rather than a static, 
universal guide.

BACKGROUND: Sequencing technologies provide a wealth of details in terms of 
genes, expression, splice variants, polymorphisms, and other features. A 
standard for sequencing analysis pipelines is to put genomic or transcriptomic 
features into a context of known functional information, but the relationships 
between ontology terms are often ignored. For RNA-Seq, considering genes and 
their genetic variants at the group level enables a convenient way to both 
integrate annotation data and detect small coordinated changes between 
experimental conditions, a known caveat of gene level analyses.
RESULTS: We introduce the high throughput data integration tool, htsint, as an 
extension to the commonly used gene set enrichment frameworks. The central aim 
of htsint is to compile annotation information from one or more taxa in order to 
calculate functional distances among all genes in a specified gene space. 
Spectral clustering is then used to partition the genes, thereby generating 
functional modules. The gene space can range from a targeted list of genes, like 
a specific pathway, all the way to an ensemble of genomes. Given a collection of 
gene sets and a count matrix of transcriptomic features (e.g. expression, 
polymorphisms), the gene sets produced by htsint can be tested for 'enrichment' 
or conditional differences using one of a number of commonly available packages.
CONCLUSION: The database and bundled tools to generate functional modules were 
designed with sequencing pipelines in mind, but the toolkit nature of htsint 
allows it to also be used in other areas of genomics. The software is freely 
available as a Python library through GitHub at 
https://github.com/ajrichards/htsint.

OBJECTIVES: With improving prognosis the prevalence of adult congenital heart 
disease (ACHD) is increasing. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have 
a shorter life expectancy compared with the general population. We investigated, 
in a large national diabetes registry, the prevalence of ACHD in combination 
with T2DM to estimate the associated clinical risk, outcome and patient 
characteristics.
DESIGN: Data from the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR) were linked with 
the Swedish National Patient Register (NPR) and the Cause of Death Register.
RESULTS: 833 ACHD patients were matched with 5 controls each. ACHD patients had 
significantly lower body mass index or BMI, higher creatinine and were more 
sedentary as compared with patients with T2DM but without congenital heart 
disease. The overall mortality was 26.2% for ACHD patients as compared with 
19.9% (P < 0.001) for the control group, and five-year mortality rates were 5.2 
versus 3.4%, P = 0.014.
CONCLUSIONS: Congenital heart disease and secondary risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease frequently coexist and the development of T2DM also in 
the ACHD population is not uncommon with an estimated prevalence of between 4 
and 8%. Treatment of conventional cardiovascular risk factors in patients with 
congenital heart disease could be considered secondary prevention given the 
relatively high morbidity and high risk for mortality observed in patients with 
the combination of ACHD and T2DM.

Currently, the most important prognostic factor in oral squamous cell carcinoma 
(OSCC) is the presence of regional lymph node metastases, which correlates with 
a 50% reduction in life expectancy. We have previously observed that expression 
of hypoxia genes in the tumor inflammatory infiltrate is statistically related 
to prognosis in OSCC. FAS and FASL expression levels in OSCC have previously 
been related to patient survival. The present study analyzed the relationship 
between FASL expression in the inflammatory infiltrate lymphoid cells and 
clinical variables, tumor histology, and prognosis of OSCC. Strong FASL 
expression was significantly associated with lymph node metastases (P = 0.035) 
and disease-specific death (P = 0.014), but multivariate analysis did not 
confirm FASL expression as an independent death risk factor (OR = 2.78, 95%CI = 
0.81-9.55). Disease-free and disease-specific survival were significantly 
correlated with FASL expression (P = 0.016 and P = 0.005, respectively). 
Multivariate analysis revealed that strong FASL expression is an independent 
marker for earlier disease relapse and disease-specific death, with 
approximately 2.5-fold increased risk compared with weak expression (HR = 2.24, 
95%CI = 1.08-4.65 and HR = 2.49, 95%CI = 1.04-5.99, respectively). Our results 
suggest a potential role for this expression profile as a tumor prognostic 
marker in OSCC patients.

PURPOSE: To determine the target intensity for fast walking during interval 
walking training (IWT) in water for middle-aged and older people to enhance 
physical fitness.
METHODS: Thirty-one women [59 ± 5 (SD) years old] were randomly divided into two 
groups: IWT on land (LG, N = 15) and in water (WG, N = 16). All subjects were 
instructed to perform ≥ 6 sets of fast and slow walking for 3 min each in a day, 
≥ 4 days week(-1), for 8 weeks, at an intensity 35% higher than the oxygen 
consumption rate at the gas exchange threshold (VO2GET), with a subjective 
feeling of 16-18 points of the Borg scale during fast walking in each condition. 
Before and after IWT, we measured VO2GET, peak aerobic capacity (VO2peak) by 
graded walking and cycling tests on land and isometric knee extension (F EXT) 
and flexion (F FLX) forces.
RESULTS: Before IWT, the VO2GET for walking in water was 14% higher and the 
heart rate (HR) at a given VO2 was ~10 beats min(-1) lower (P=0.001) than on 
land. During IWT, subjects in both groups performed IWT for ~4 days week(-1)(P > 
0.9) with a 14% higher fast walking intensity in WG than in LG (P < 0.05). After 
IWT, the VO2peak and VO2GET for cycling, F EXT and F FLX increased more in WG 
than in LG (all, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Walking in water elevated VO2GET and decreased HR at a given 
exercise intensity in middle-aged and older women, which enabled them to perform 
exercise at a higher metabolic rate than on land due to improved subjective 
feelings, which, for these subjects, resulted in greater gains in physical 
fitness.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality in the Western 
world. Multiple factors are involved in CVD, including genetic factors and 
modifiable factors such as diet, physical activity, and smoking. CVD incidence 
and prevalence increase progressively with age, and it is estimated that over 
80% of men and women older than 75 years have clinically manifest CVD. To reduce 
the gap between life expectancy (LE) and healthy life expectancy is one of the 
main challenges of the 21st century. Lifestyle improvement appears to be the 
only sustainable approach to face the dramatic chronic-degenerative disease 
burden of an aging population. A healthy lifestyle, represented by avoiding 
smoking, following a healthy diet, and practicing physical activity, protects 
from chronic-degenerative disease onset and progression. A healthy dietetic 
approach specifically formulated for elderly people, with a defined pattern of 
nutraceutical bioactive compounds, may represent a key strategy to improve the 
aging process and increase the life span. This short review summarizes the 
biochemical mechanisms underpinning the cardiovascular protective effects of 
some nutraceutical compounds such as quercetin and sulforaphane.

BACKGROUND: There are over 15 million children who have cardiac anomalies around 
the world, resulting in a significant morbidity and mortality. Early recognition 
and treatment can improve the outcomes and lengthen life-expectancy of these 
patients. The NIH and WHO have promoted guidelines for screening for congenital 
cardiac anomalies using ultrasound in rural environments.
METHODS: Our study took place in Bocas Del Toro, Panama where a mobile clinic 
was established for community healthcare screening and ultrasonographic 
evaluation by medical student volunteers and volunteer clinical faculty. This 
was a non-blinded, investigational study utilizing a convenience sample of 
pediatric patients presenting for voluntary evaluation. Seven first-year medical 
students were recruited for the study. These students underwent a training 
program for advanced cardiac ultrasound instruction, termed "Pediatric 
Echocardiography Cardiac Screening (PECS)".
RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled in the study. Nine patients had adequate 
images as defined by the PECS criteria and were all classified as normal cardiac 
pathology by the medical students, resulting in a sensitivity and specificity of 
100%. A single patient was identified by medical students as having a pathologic 
pulmonic stenosis. This was confirmed as correct by a blinded ultrasonographer.
CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, the first-year medical students were able to 
correctly identify pediatric cardiac anatomy and pathology in rural Panama after 
undergoing a 12-hour ultrasound PECS training session. We believe that with this 
knowledge, minimally trained practitioners can be used to screen for cardiac 
anomalies in rural Panama using ultrasound.

Characteristics associated with life expectancy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are 
still far from known. Here we aimed at examining the ability of 
baseline/longitudinal clinical variables to predict time to death. One-hundred 
fifty AD outpatients underwent diagnostic, neuropsychiatric, and functional 
assessment at baseline (when ApoE ɛ4 was also investigated) and at each 
subsequent annual visit. A random effects joint modeling approach was used to 
simultaneously model the baseline and longitudinal trajectory of each factor and 
predict the time to death, adjusting for demographic covariates. An ancillary 
analysis of ApoE ɛ4 status as a predictor was also conducted. Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves were constructed to elucidate the relationship between each 
factor and the estimated probability of death over time. Shorter survival was 
associated with male gender, higher education, older age, lower cognition, and 
worse functioning in daily life, but not ApoE ɛ4 status. Longitudinal 
trajectories increased predictive power over using just baseline levels 
highlighting apathy, and secondarily aberrant motor behaviors and sleep 
disorders, as a highly reliable predictor for mortality. Apathy was the 
strongest neuropsychiatric predictor of time to death, which supports its role 
in the pathogenesis of the disorder. An increased knowledge of factors 
modulating survival in AD is a strategic prerequisite to plan therapeutic 
interventions.

Screening for prostate cancer should help to detect malignancy at an early and 
potentially treatable stage. Serum psa has been used as a test for prostate 
cancer for over 20 years, but its practise is still very controversial 
worldwide. Studies can demostrate good aspects for screening with psa: the 
overall mortality and especially the metastases at stage of primary diagnosis 
can be reduced. A relevant factor is measuring the serum psa in younger men aged 
40-50 for a baseline to evaluate the individual risk of prostate cancer. 
Furthermore, it is important not to exclude patients because of their age of 
measuring the psa. The individual life expectancy should help to decide about 
its usefulness. This aspect is especially important in the face of an increasing 
life expectancy and fitness level at old age. Further studies are needed to 
publish a recommendation for psa-screening. In Germany, the PROBASE is a current 
study to research this topic.

Coping Expectancies, Not Enhancement Expectancies, Mediate Trauma Experience 
Effects on Problem Alcohol Use: A Prospective Study From Early Childhood to 
Adolescence.

OBJECTIVE: The relationship between experiencing trauma and increased alcohol 
consumption has been well established. Exposure to childhood trauma has been 
linked to both early onset of drinking and problematic substance use. However, 
the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. The results of early 
work suggested that drinking to relieve negative affect (i.e., drinking to cope) 
was driving this connection. However, the findings of more recent work suggest 
that drinking might be used to enhance positive affect as a way of addressing 
the aftereffects of early trauma. The current study looked at these two drinking 
expectancies as indirect pathways between the experience in early childhood of 
living in a home with parental violence and peak alcohol use in emerging 
adulthood.
METHOD: Participants were 1,064 children and their parents involved in a 
longitudinal community study of children at high risk for the development of 
alcoholism and a community contrast group of those at lower risk. Baseline 
assessment was at age 3-5 years, self-reports of internalizing behavior and 
drinking expectancies were obtained at age 12-14, and drinking measures were 
assessed at age 18-20.
RESULTS: Results indicated that coping expectancy was a mediator of the 
relationship between early childhood trauma and later peak alcohol use, whereas 
enhancement expectancy was not.
CONCLUSIONS: Children living in homes with parental violence were more likely to 
develop ineffective coping strategies, such as using alcohol to decrease 
negative affect. These results support the self-medication theory. They also 
demonstrate the long-term effects of early life experience on drinking behavior 
in early adulthood.

Protein Dynamics in the Solid State from (2)H NMR Line Shape Analysis. II. MOMD 
Applied to C-D and C-CD3 Probes.

Deuterium line shape analysis from mobile C-D and C-CD3 groups has emerged as a 
particularly useful tool for studying dynamics in the solid state. The 
theoretical models devised so far consist typically of sets of independent 
dynamic modes. Each such mode is simple and usually case-specific. In this 
scenario, model improvement entails adding yet another mode (thereby changing 
the overall model), comparison of different cases is difficult, and ambiguity is 
unavoidable. We recently developed the microscopic order macroscopic disorder 
(MOMD) approach as a single-mode alternative. In MOMD, the local spatial 
restrictions are expressed by an anisotropic potential, the local motion by a 
diffusion tensor, and the local molecular geometry by relative (magnetic and 
model-related) tensor orientations, all of adjustable symmetry. This approach 
provides a consistent method of analysis, thus resolving the issues above. In 
this study, we apply MOMD to PS-adsorbed LKα14 peptide and dimethylammonium 
tetraphenylborate (C-CD3 and N-CD3 dynamics, respectively), as well as HhaI 
methyltransferase target DNA and phase III of benzene-6-hexanoate (C-D 
dynamics). The success with fitting these four disparate cases, as well as the 
two cases in the previous report, demonstrates the generality of this MOMD-based 
approach. In this study, C-D and C-CD3 are both found to execute axial diffusion 
(rates R⊥ and R∥) in the presence of a rhombic potential given by the L = 2 
spherical harmonics (coefficients c02 and c22). R⊥ (R∥) is in the 102-103 
(104-105) s-1 range, and c02 and c22 are on the order of 2-3 kBT. Specific 
parameter values are determined for each mobile site. The diffusion and 
quadrupolar tensors are tilted at either 120° (consistent with trans-gauche 
isomerization) or nearly 110.5° (consistent with methyl exchange). Future 
prospects include extension of the MOMD formalism to include MAS, and 
application to 15N and 13C nuclei.

Accumulating evidence shows nutritional factors influence the risk of developing 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its rate of clinical progression. Dietary and 
lifestyle guidelines to help adults reduce their risk have been developed. 
However, the clinical dementia picture remains complex, and further evidence is 
required to demonstrate that modifying nutritional status can protect the brain 
and prevent, delay, or reduce pathophysiological consequences of AD. Moreover, 
there is a pressing need for further research because of the global epidemic of 
overweight and obesity combined with longer life expectancy of the general 
population and generally observed decreases in body weight with aging and AD. A 
new research approach is needed, incorporating more sophisticated models to 
account for complex scenarios influencing the relationship between nutritional 
status and AD. Systematic research should identify and address evidence gaps. 
Integrating longitudinal epidemiological data with biomarkers of disease, 
including brain imaging technology, and randomized controlled interventions may 
provide greater insights into progressive and subtle neurological changes 
associated with dietary factors in individuals at risk for or living with AD. In 
addition, greater understanding of mechanisms involved in nutritional influences 
on AD risk and progression, such as oxidative stress and loss of neuronal 
membrane integrity, will better inform possible interventional strategies. There 
is consensus among the authors that nutritional deficits, and even states of 
excess, are associated with AD, but more work is needed to determine cause and 
effect. Appropriately designed diets or nutritional interventions may play a 
role, but additional research is needed on their clinical-cognitive 
effectiveness.

OBJECTIVES: We propose a novel approach to examine vulnerability in the 
relationship between heat and years of life lost and apply to neighborhood 
social disparities in Montreal and Paris.
METHODS: We used historical data from the summers of 1990 through 2007 for 
Montreal and from 2004 through 2009 for Paris to estimate daily years of life 
lost social disparities (DYLLD), summarizing social inequalities across groups. 
We used Generalized Linear Models to separately estimate relative risks (RR) for 
DYLLD in association with daily mean temperatures in both cities. We used 30 
climate scenarios of daily mean temperature to estimate future temperature 
distributions (2021-2050). We performed random effect meta-analyses to assess 
the impact of climate change by climate scenario for each city and compared the 
impact of climate change for the two cities using a meta-regression analysis.
RESULTS: We show that an increase in ambient temperature leads to an increase in 
social disparities in daily years of life lost. The impact of climate change on 
DYLLD attributable to temperature was of 2.06 (95% CI: 1.90, 2.25) in Montreal 
and 1.77 (95% CI: 1.61, 1.94) in Paris. The city explained a difference of 0.31 
(95% CI: 0.14, 0.49) on the impact of climate change.
CONCLUSION: We propose a new analytical approach for estimating vulnerability in 
the relationship between heat and health. Our results suggest that in Paris and 
Montreal, health disparities related to heat impacts exist today and will 
increase in the future.

Impingement after reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is believed to occur from 
repetitive contact in adduction between the humeral component and the inferior 
scapular pillar. The primary purpose of this biomechanical study was to confirm 
the presence of different types of impingement and to examine which daily-life 
movements are responsible for them. A secondary aim was to provide 
recommendations on the type of components that would best minimize notching and 
loss of range of motion (ROM). The study included 12 fresh frozen shoulder
