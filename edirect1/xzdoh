Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome is one of the major pathologies of modern 
life, with multiple etiologies intertwining: the increase in life expectancy, 
facial and dental changes, metabolic syndrome, and others. The current diagnosis 
is based on sleep studies, flexible endoscopy, imaging studies and a complete 
differential diagnosis from other possible pathologies. We present a 
retrospective study of 80 cases with OSA managed in 2019 prior to the beginning 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed various demographic, anthropometric and 
metabolic data recorded in our study group. Some of the results, such as high 
levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, were consistent with worldwide 
literature. However, regarding the anthropometric data, we underline a general 
decrease in height in the Romanian population. In addition, demographic data 
have changed in the last decade due to the work immigration in the European 
Union. This data will be used in a future analysis for comparison with variables 
recorded from cases with OSA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Current cases with 
OSA are not a priority for healthcare systems, and patients avoid referral to a 
specialist as much as possible.

Postoperative complications contribute to recurrences and poor long-term 
outcomes for gastric cancer patients, especially among the elderly. However, the 
prognostic effect of postoperative complications on non-cancer-related death in 
elderly patients with gastric cancer has not been reported. Two hundred and 
twenty elderly (> 75 years of age) patients with stage I gastric cancer were 
retrospectively identified from consecutive admissions between 1995 and 2020. 
Non-cancer-related death following gastrectomy occurred in 13.6% (30/220) of 
patients. Non-cancer-related death was associated with respiratory disease in 
46.7% (14/30) of cases. Although there was no association with any preoperative 
comorbidities, postoperative complications [P < 0.001, HR 4.16 (95% CI: 
1.91-9.02)] and open gastrectomy [P=0.002, HR 3.87 (95% CI: 1.54-9.66)] were 
independently associated with a poorer prognosis for non-cancer-related death. 
Poor nutritional status [P=0.028, OR 4.25 (95% CI: 1.17-15.4)] was an 
independent risk factor for postoperative complications. Postoperative 
complications shortened life expectancy from 8.8 years to 6.1 years. 
Specifically, postoperative complications shortened life expectancy from 6.7 
years to 3.9 years in elderly patients over 80 years of age. Postoperative 
complications and open gastrectomy affected the incidence of non-cancer-related 
death among elderly patients with gastric cancer, primarily attributed to 
respiratory disease. Efforts should be made to perform minimally invasive 
surgery, improve preoperative nutrition, and avoid postoperative complications.

Blood and urine biomarkers in prostate cancer: Are we ready for reflex testing 
in men with an elevated prostate-specific antigen?

OBJECTIVE: There is no consensus on the role of biomarkers in determining the 
utility of prostate biopsy in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 
There are numerous biomarkers such as prostate health index, 4Kscore, prostate 
cancer antigen 3, ExoDX, SelectMDx, and Mi-Prostate Score that may be useful in 
this decision-making process. However, it is unclear whether any of these tests 
are accurate and cost-effective enough to warrant being a widespread reflex test 
following an elevated PSA. Our goal was to report on the clinical utility of 
these blood and urine biomarkers in prostate cancer screening.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of studies published between January 
2000 and October 2020 to report the available parameters and cost-effectiveness 
of the aforementioned diagnostic tests. We focus on the negative predictive 
value, the area under the curve, and the decision curve analysis in comparing 
reflexive tests due to their relevance in evaluating diagnostic screening tests.
RESULTS: Overall, the biomarkers are roughly equivalent in predictive accuracy. 
Each test has additional clinical utility to the current diagnostic standard of 
care, but the added benefit is not substantial to justify using the test 
reflexively after an elevated PSA.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest these biomarkers should not be used in binary 
fashion and should be understood in the context of pre-existing risk predictors, 
patient's ethnicity, cost of the test, patient life-expectancy, and patient 
goals. There are more recent diagnostic tools such as multi-parametric magnetic 
resonance imaging, polygenic single-nucleotide panels, IsoPSA, and miR Sentinel 
tests that are promising in the realm of prostate cancer screening and need to 
be investigated further to be considered a consensus reflexive test in the 
setting of prostate cancer screening.

BACKGROUND: Although being the historical gold standard for rotator cuff repair, 
open transosseous (TO) repair was largely replaced by anchor-based methods with 
the advent of arthroscopic surgery owing to their comparative ease of use. 
However, suture anchors are at risk of dislodgement, especially among older 
patients, who have more osteopenic bone or those presenting large tears. 
Considering the ever-increasing active life expectancy and associated increased 
quality of life expectations by older generations, the need to offer safe and 
efficient surgical treatments to these patients imposes itself. Arthroscopic TO 
repairs would combine the best of both worlds and be well adapted to these 
populations. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the functional 
outcome and complication rate of the TO arthroscopic repair technique when using 
a 2-mm braided suture tape. The secondary objective of this study was to assess 
functional outcome of TO repair in older patients and patients with >3-cm tears.
METHODS: One hundred thirty-seven consecutive patients with full-thickness 
rotator cuff tear who underwent arthroscopic TO (anchorless) rotator cuff repair 
between January 2011 and December 2013 were reviewed. The surgery was performed 
by a single surgeon with a reusable curved suture passer and 2-mm braided tape 
suture. Follow-up was 3 to 5 years (mean = 50 months). All patients underwent 
preoperative and postoperative functional assessments (American Shoulder and 
Elbow Surgeons and Quick Dash) and were questioned with their overall 
satisfaction.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight (28%) of the 137 patients were 65 years and older, and 62 
(45%) had a large or massive tear. One patient (0.7%) had early retear at the 
suture-tendon interface after trauma 3 weeks postoperatively. The average Quick 
Dash score improved by 55.6 points and the average American Shoulder and Elbow 
Surgeons score improved by 69.7 points 3.5 and 6.3 times their minimal 
clinically important differences, respectively. There was no significant 
difference in final functional outcomes between patients 65 years and older and 
younger patients or between patients with large and massive (>3 cm) and smaller 
tears (≤3 cm). Mean operative time was 68 min ± 16.
CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic TO repair using a 2-mm tape material has achieved 
significant mid-term functional improvement, with results statistically 
unaffected by larger tear size (>3 cm) or older age (≥65 years).

Fish is perishable and has the short shelf-life. To maintain its quality, it is 
necessary to implement the appropriate technology, particularly nonthermal 
processing along with safe additive, especially from plant origin under the 
concept of "hurdle technology". The use of potential vesicle including liposome 
for loading the plant extract could be a means to enhance the stability and 
activities of the extract. The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of 
liposomes loaded with betel leaf ethanolic extract (L/BLEEs) or unencapsulated 
BLEE (U/BLEE) in conjunction with modified atmospheric packaging (MAP) and 
nonthermal plasma (NTP) on the quality changes and shelf-life of Nile tilapia 
fillets (TFs) stored under refrigerated condition (4°C). TFs treated with L/BLEE 
or U/BLEE at 400 ppm, packed under modified atmosphere (CO2 :Ar:O2  = 60:30:10) 
and subjected to NTP for 300 s (L/BLEE-400/MAP-NTP and U/BLEE-400/MAP-NTP, 
respectively) had the lowest microbial and chemical changes during storage, 
while the control showed the highest changes (p < 0.05). Lipid oxidation was 
lower in these samples, ascertained by more retained polyunsaturated fatty acids 
and lower lipid oxidation based on Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra. 
Overall likeness scores were similar (p > 0.05) between all the samples at day 0 
of storage. Only L/BLEE-400/MAP-NTP and U/BLEE-400/MAP-NTP were still 
sensorially acceptable after 12 days at 4°C. Therefore, L/BLEE or U/BLEE 
combined with MAP/NTP treatment could be adopted as a potent hurdle for 
shelf-life extension of TFs. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Natural additives and 
nonthermal processing technologies have gained increasing interest for 
preservation of fish. Liposomes loaded with betel leaf ethanolic extract 
(L/BLEE) rich in polyphenolics could be used together with modified atmospheric 
packaging (MAP) and nonthermal plasma (NTP) to retard bacterial growth and 
chemical deterioration in Nile tilapia fillets. These hurdles were proven to be 
able to maintain the qualities of tilapia fillets stored at 4°C up to 12 days, 
especially when L/BLEE was used at 400 ppm. Therefore, shelf-life extension of 
Nile tilapia fillets or other fish can be achieved by using the natural additive 
and nonthermal processing technologies.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the most cost-effective of all prophylactic 
measures available in Switzerland for women not yet affected by breast and 
ovarian cancer who tested positive for a BRCA1/2 mutation.
METHODS: Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy (PBM), salpingo-oophorectomy (PBSO), 
combined PBM&PBSO and chemoprevention (CP) initiated at age 40 years were 
compared with intensified surveillance (IS). A Markov model with a life-long 
time horizon was developed from the perspective of the Swiss healthcare system 
using mainly literature-derived data to evaluate costs, quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) and survival. Costs and QALYs were discounted by 3% per year. 
Robustness of the results was tested with deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: All prophylactic measures were found to be cost-saving with an increase 
in QALYs and life years (LYs) compared to IS. PBM&PBSO were found to be most 
cost-effective and dominated all other strategies in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 
mutation. Lifetime costs averaged to 141,293 EUR and 14.5 QALYs per woman with a 
BRCA1 mutation under IS, versus 76,639 EUR and 19.2 QALYs for PBM&PBSO. 
Corresponding results for IS per woman with a BRCA2 mutation were 102,245 EUR 
and 15.5 QALYs, versus 60,770 EUR and 19.9 QALYs for PBM&PBSO. The results were 
found to be robust in sensitivity analysis; no change in the dominant strategy 
for either BRCA-mutation was observed.
CONCLUSION: All more invasive strategies were found to increase life expectancy 
and quality of life of women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and were cost-saving 
for the Swiss healthcare system compared to IS.

PURPOSE: Patients with advanced cancer often have unrealistic expectations about 
prognosis and treatment. This study assessed the effect of an oncology nurse-led 
primary palliative care intervention on illness expectations among patients with 
advanced cancer.
METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized trial of 
primary palliative care conducted at 17 oncology clinics. Adult patients with 
advanced solid tumors for whom the oncologist would not be surprised if died 
within 1 year were enrolled. Monthly visits were designed to foster realistic 
illness expectations by eliciting patient concerns and goals for their medical 
care and empowering patients and families to engage in discussions with 
oncologists about treatment options and preferences. Baseline and 3-month 
questionnaires included questions about life expectancy, treatment intent, and 
terminal illness acknowledgment. Odds of realistic illness expectations at 3 
months were adjusted for baseline responses, patient demographic and clinical 
characteristics, and intervention dose.
RESULTS: Among 457 primarily White patients, there was little difference in 
realistic illness expectations at 3 months between intervention and standard 
care groups: 12.8% v 11.4% for life expectancy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 
1.15; 95% CI, 0.59 to 2.22; P = .684); 24.6% v 33.3% for treatment intent (aOR = 
0.76; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.27; P = .290); 53.6% v 44.7% for terminal illness 
acknowledgment (aOR = 1.28; 95% CI, 0.81 to 2.00; P = .288). Results did not 
differ when accounting for variation in clinic sites or intervention dose.
CONCLUSION: Illness expectations are difficult to change among patients with 
advanced cancer. Additional work is needed to identify approaches within 
oncology practices that foster realistic illness expectations to improve patient 
decision making.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: AUGUSTUS trial demonstrated that, for patients with atrial 
fibrillation (AF) having acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or undergoing 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), an antithrombotic regimen with 
apixaban and P2Y12 resulted in less bleeding, fewer hospitalizations, and 
similar ischemic events than regimens including a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), 
aspirin, or both. This study objective was to evaluate long-term health and 
economic outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of apixaban over VKA, as a 
treatment option for patients with AF having ACS/PCI.
METHODS: A lifetime Markov cohort model was developed comparing apixaban versus 
VKA across multiple treatment strategies (triple [with P2Y12 + aspirin] or dual 
[with P2Y12] therapy followed by monotherapy [apixaban or VKA]; triple followed 
by dual and then monotherapy; dual followed by monotherapy). The model adopted 
the Spanish healthcare perspective, with a 3-month cycle length and costs and 
health outcomes discounted at 3%.
RESULTS: Treatment with apixaban resulted in total cost savings of €883 and 
higher life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) per patient than VKA 
(net difference, LYs: 0.13; QALYs: 0.11). Bleeding and ischemic events (per 100 
patients) were lower with apixaban than VKA (net difference, -13.9 and -1.8, 
respectively). Incremental net monetary benefit for apixaban was €3,041, using a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, apixaban was dominant in the majority of simulations (92.6%), 
providing additional QALYs at lower costs than VKA.
CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban was a dominant treatment strategy than VKA from both the 
Spanish payer's and societal perspectives, regardless of treatment strategy 
considered.

BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer have an increased risk of complications from 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination to prevent COVID-19 is recommended, but data 
on the immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccines for patients with solid 
tumours receiving systemic cancer treatment are scarce. Therefore, we aimed to 
assess the impact of immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and chemoimmunotherapy on the 
immunogenicity and safety of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna Biotech, Madrid, Spain) 
COVID-19 vaccine as part of the Vaccination Against COVID in Cancer (VOICE) 
trial.
METHODS: This prospective, multicentre, non-inferiority trial was done across 
three centres in the Netherlands. Individuals aged 18 years or older with a life 
expectancy of more than 12 months were enrolled into four cohorts: individuals 
without cancer (cohort A [control cohort]), and patients with solid tumours, 
regardless of stage and histology, treated with immunotherapy (cohort B), 
chemotherapy (cohort C), or chemoimmunotherapy (cohort D). Participants received 
two mRNA-1273 vaccinations of 100 μg in 0·5 mL intramuscularly, 28 days apart. 
The primary endpoint, analysed per protocol (excluding patients with a positive 
baseline sample [>10 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL], indicating previous 
SARS-CoV-2 infection), was defined as the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-specific IgG serum 
antibody response (ie, SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody concentration of >10 BAU/mL) 
28 days after the second vaccination. For the primary endpoint analysis, a 
non-inferiority design with a margin of 10% was used. We also assessed adverse 
events in all patients who received at least one vaccination, and recorded 
solicited adverse events in participants who received at least one vaccination 
but excluding those who already had seroconversion (>10 BAU/mL) at baseline. 
This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04715438.
FINDINGS: Between Feb 17 and March 12, 2021, 791 participants were enrolled and 
followed up for a median of 122 days (IQR 118 to 128). A SARS-CoV-2-binding 
antibody response was found in 240 (100%; 95% CI 98 to 100) of 240 evaluable 
participants in cohort A, 130 (99%; 96 to >99) of 131 evaluable patients in 
cohort B, 223 (97%; 94 to 99) of 229 evaluable patients in cohort C, and 143 
(100%; 97 to 100) of 143 evaluable patients in cohort D. The SARS-CoV-2-binding 
antibody response in each patient cohort was non-inferior compared with cohort 
A. No new safety signals were observed. Grade 3 or worse serious adverse events 
occurred in no participants in cohort A, three (2%) of 137 patients in cohort B, 
six (2%) of 244 patients in cohort C, and one (1%) of 163 patients in cohort D, 
with four events (two of fever, and one each of diarrhoea and febrile 
neutropenia) potentially related to the vaccination. There were no 
vaccine-related deaths.
INTERPRETATION: Most patients with cancer develop, while receiving chemotherapy, 
immunotherapy, or both for a solid tumour, an adequate antibody response to 
vaccination with the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine is also safe in 
these patients. The minority of patients with an inadequate response after two 
vaccinations might benefit from a third vaccination.

The prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss has increased along with increases 
in life expectancy and exposure to noisy environments. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) 
is a cluster of co-occurring conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, 
stroke and type 2 diabetes, along with other conditions that affect the blood 
vessels. Components of MetS include insulin resistance, body weight, lipid 
concentration, blood pressure, and blood glucose concentration, as well as other 
features of insulin resistance such as microalbuminuria. MetS has become a major 
public health problem affecting 20-30% of the global population. This study 
utilized health examination to investigate whether metabolic syndrome was 
related to hearing loss.
METHODS: A total of 94,223 people who underwent health check-ups, including 
hearing tests, from January 2010 to December 2020 were evaluated. Subjects were 
divided into two groups, with and without metabolic syndrome. In addition, 
Scopus, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane libraries were systematically searched, 
using keywords such as "hearing loss" and "metabolic syndrome", for studies that 
evaluated the relationship between the two.
RESULTS: Of the 94,223 subjects, 11,414 (12.1%) had metabolic syndrome and 
82,809 did not. The mean ages of subjects in the two groups were 46.1 and 43.9 
years, respectively. A comparison of hearing thresholds by age in subjects with 
and without metabolic syndrome showed that the average pure tone hearing 
thresholds were significantly higher in subjects with metabolic syndrome than in 
subjects without it in all age groups. (p < 0.001) Rates of hearing loss in 
subjects with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the components of metabolic syndrome were 
7.9%, 12.1%, 13.8%, 13.8%, 15.5% and 16.3%, respectively, indicating a 
significant association between the number of components of metabolic syndrome 
and the rate of hearing loss (p < 0.0001). The odds ratio of hearing loss was 
significantly higher in subjects with four components of metabolic syndrome: 
waist circumference, blood pressure, and triglyceride and fasting blood sugar 
concentrations (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The number of components of the metabolic syndrome is positively 
correlated with the rate of sensorineural hearing loss.

(1) Background: Pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) is one of the main factors 
affecting the quality of life and life expectancy in patients with cystic 
fibrosis (CF). Our study aimed to evaluate the change in selected pulmonary 
function parameters, including lung clearance index (LCI), in patients with CF 
diagnosed with PEx. (2) Methods: We enrolled 40 children with CF aged 6-17. They 
performed spirometry and multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBNW) tests during a 
stable condition period at the beginning and the end of intravenous antibiotic 
treatment. (3) Results: LCI increased by 65% and FEV1 decreased by ≥10% in 40% 
of patients with CF during PEx. An absolute change in LCI between a stable 
condition period and PEx was 1.05 (±1.92) units, which corresponds to a relative 
change of 11.48% (±18.61) of the baseline. The relative decrease in FEV1 was 
-9.22% (±12.00) and the z-score was -0.67 (±1.13). After the PEx treatment, FEV1 
increased by 11.05% (±9.04) on average, whereas LCI decreased by 1.21 ± 1.59 
units on average, which represented 9.42% ± 11.40 compared to the value at the 
beginning of PEx. (4) Conclusions: The change in LCI captures a higher 
proportion of events with functional impairment than FEV1 in school-age children 
with CF.

Devastated Bladder Outlet in Pelvic Cancer Survivors: Issues on Surgical 
Reconstruction and Quality of Life.

Bladder outlet obstruction following treatment of pelvic cancer, predominantly 
prostate cancer, occurs in 1-8% of patients. The high incidence of prostate 
cancer combined with the long-life expectancy after treatment has increased 
concerns with cancer survivorship care. However, despite increased oncological 
cure rates, these adverse events do occur, compromising patients' quality of 
life. Non-traumatic obstruction of the posterior urethra and bladder neck 
include membranous and prostatic urethral stenosis and bladder neck stenosis 
(also known as contracture). The devastated bladder outlet can result from 
benign conditions, such as neurogenic dysfunction, trauma, iatrogenic causes, or 
more frequently from complications of oncologic treatment, such as prostate, 
bladder and rectum. Most posterior urethral stenoses may respond to endoluminal 
treatments such as dilatation, direct vision internal urethrotomy, and 
occasionally urethral stents. Although surgical reconstruction offers the best 
chance of durable success, these reconstructive options are fraught with severe 
complications and, therefore, are far from being ideal. In patients with prior 
RT, failed reconstruction, densely fibrotic and/or necrotic and calcified 
posterior urethra, refractory incontinence or severe comorbidities, 
reconstruction may not be either feasible or recommended. In these cases, 
urinary diversion with or without cystectomy is usually required. This review 
aims to discuss the diagnostic evaluation and treatment options for patients 
with bladder outlet obstruction with a special emphasis on patients unsuitable 
for reconstruction of the posterior urethra and requiring urinary diversion.

Obesity may aggravate the effects of sarcopenia on skeletal muscle structure and 
function in the elderly, but no study has attempted to identify the gene 
variants associated with sarcopenia in obese women. Therefore, the aims of the 
present study were to: (1) describe neuromuscular function in sarcopenic and 
non-sarcopenic women with or without obesity; (2) identify gene variants 
associated with sarcopenia in older obese women. In 307 Caucasian women (71 ± 6 
years, 66.3 ± 11.3 kg), skeletal muscle mass was estimated using bioelectric 
impedance, and function was tested with a 30 s one-leg standing-balance test. 
Biceps brachii thickness and vastus lateralis cross-sectional area (VLACSA) were 
measured with B-mode ultrasonography. Handgrip strength, maximum voluntary 
contraction elbow flexion (MVCEF), and knee extension torque (MVCKE) were 
measured by dynamometry, and MVCKE/VLACSA was calculated. Genotyping was 
performed for 24 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), selected based on their 
previous associations with muscle-related phenotypes. Based on sarcopenia and 
obesity thresholds, groups were classified as sarcopenic obese, non-sarcopenic 
obese, sarcopenic non-obese, or non-sarcopenic non-obese. A two-way analysis of 
covariance was used to assess the main effects of sarcopenia and obesity on 
muscle-related phenotypes and binary logistic regression was performed for each 
SNP to investigate associations with sarcopenia in obesity. There were no 
significant obesity * sarcopenic status interactions for any of the investigated 
muscle-related phenotypic parameters. Neither sarcopenia nor obesity had a 
significant effect on biceps brachii thickness, but sarcopenia was associated 
with lower VLACSA (p = 0.003). Obesity was associated with lower MVCEF (p = 
0.032), MVCKE (p = 0.047), and MVCKE/VLACSA (p = 0.012) with no significant 
effect of sarcopenia. Adjusted for age and height, three SNPs (ACTN3 rs1815739, 
MTHFR rs1801131, and MTHFR rs1537516) were associated with sarcopenia in obese 
participants. Sarcopenia was associated with a smaller muscle size, while 
obesity resulted in a lower muscle quality irrespective of sarcopenia. Three 
gene variants (ACTN3 rs1815739, MTHFR rs1801131, and MTHFR rs1537516) suspected 
to affect muscle function, homocysteine metabolism, or DNA methylation, 
respectively, were associated with sarcopenia in obese elderly women. 
Understanding the skeletal muscle features affected by sarcopenia and obesity, 
and identification of genes related to sarcopenia in obese women, may facilitate 
early detection of individuals at particular risk of sarcopenic obesity.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) incidence increases with age reaching 
37.9/100,000 in patients over 85 years. Although there is no standardized 
geriatric tool specifically validated for CLL, a correct framing of the fitness 
status is of critical importance to individualize treatment strategies. Based on 
the evidence available to date, frontline chemoimmunotherapy has an increasingly 
narrowing application, being eligible for candidacy only in elderly fit patients 
without or with minimal geriatric syndromes. On the other hand, treatment with 
BCR inhibitors, monotherapy, or in combination with anti-CD20 antibodies (e.g., 
obinutuzumab), must be preferred both for frontline and relapsed CLL not only in 
unfit patients, but also in fit patients with unmutated IGHV or harboring 
del(17p) and/or TP53 mutations/deletions. Second-generation inhibitors (e.g., 
acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, pirtobrutinib) are novel compounds that, due to 
their better safety profile and different specificity, will help physicians 
overcome some of the safety issues and treatment resistances. In the era of 
targeted therapies, treatment decisions in elderly and/or unfit patients with 
CLL must be a balance between efficacy and safety, carefully evaluating 
comorbidities and geriatric syndromes to ensure the best approach to improve 
both quality of life and life expectancy.

York, NY 10065, USA.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia in older adults and is 
fast becoming a major societal and economic burden due to an increase in life 
expectancy. Age seems to be the major factor driving AD, and currently, only 
symptomatic treatments are available. AD has a complex etiology, although 
mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolic 
abnormalities have been widely and deeply investigated as plausible mechanisms 
for its neuropathology. Aβ plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates, along 
with cognitive deficits and behavioral problems, are the hallmarks of the 
disease. Restoration of mitochondrial bioenergetics, prevention of oxidative 
stress, and diet and exercise seem to be effective in reducing Aβ and in 
ameliorating learning and memory problems. Many mitochondria-targeted 
antioxidants have been tested in AD and are currently in development. However, 
larger streamlined clinical studies are needed to provide hard evidence of 
benefits in AD. This review discusses the causative factors, as well as 
potential therapeutics employed in the treatment of AD.

Natural antimicrobials (NA) have stood out in the last decade due to the growing 
demand for reducing chemical preservatives in food. Once solubility, stability, 
and changes in sensory attributes could limit their applications in foods, 
several studies were published suggesting micro-/nanoencapsulation to overcome 
such challenges. Thus, for our systematic review the Science Direct, Web of 
Science, Scopus, and Pub Med databases were chosen to recover papers published 
from 2010 to 2020. After reviewing all titles/abstracts and keywords for the 
full-text papers, key data were extracted and synthesized. The systematic review 
proposed to compare the antimicrobial efficacy between nanoencapsulated NA (nNA) 
and its free form in vitro and in situ studies, since although in vitro studies 
are often used in studies, they present characteristics and properties that are 
different from those found in foods; providing a comprehensive understanding of 
primary mechanisms of action of the nNA in foods; and analyzing the effects on 
quality parameters of foods. Essential oils and nanoemulsions (10.9-100 nm) have 
received significant attention and showed higher antimicrobial efficacy without 
sensory impairments compared to free NA. Regarding nNA mechanisms: (i) 
nanoencapsulation provides a slow-prolonged release to promote antimicrobial 
action over time, and (ii) prevents interactions with food constituents that in 
turn impair antimicrobial action. Besides in vitro antifungal and antibacterial, 
nNA also demonstrated antioxidant activity-potential to shelf life extension in 
food. However, of the studies involving nanoencapsulated natural antimicrobials 
used in this review, little attention was placed on proximate composition, 
sensory, and rheological evaluation. We encourage further in situ studies once 
data differ from in vitro assay, suggesting food matrix greatly influences NA 
mechanisms.

The objective of this paper was to gain novel insights into the complex 
relationships among Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in shaping productivity 
(GDP/capita) growth. Using dynamic panel regressions on data collected in 138 
countries between 2000 and 2017, we found that rising temperatures negatively 
affect growth and mitigate the impact of other SDGs on growth. We also found 
that CO2 emissions have a U-shaped relationship with growth; life expectancy 
negatively influences growth (positively moderated by rising temperatures), and 
food security positively impacts growth (negatively moderated by rising 
temperatures). This study highlights the difficulty of simultaneously 
implementing SDGs and elucidates novel research perspectives and policies to 
decrease the negative impacts of climate change on socio-economic and 
environmental well-being.

Estimation of Life Expectancy for Dependent Population in a Multi-State Context.

Population statistics show that there was an increase in life expectancy during 
the last century. However, this fact hides that this increase was not equal for 
all groups of the population. One of the most problematic cases for measuring 
this increase is that of the dependent population because of the absence of 
specific statistics. This paper describes a methodology for calculating life 
expectancy using multistate models that take into account the diversity of 
situations considered by Spanish legislation. For this purpose, statistical 
information contained in the national survey on disability and dependency (EDAD 
2008) is used. The results suggest that life expectancies are lower than those 
of the general population and that they differ according to gender and intensity 
of suffering from this contingency. The calculations were made considering the 
legal framework currently existing in Spain. This fact conditions the definition 
of dependent person and, therefore, the set of individuals, their 
characteristics, and therefore, their final results.
