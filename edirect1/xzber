OBJECTIVES: To identify key determinants explaining country-year variations in 
antibiotic use and resistance.
METHODS: Ambulatory antibiotic use data [in defined daily doses per 1000 
inhabitants per day (DIDs)] for 19 European countries from 1999 to 2007 were 
collected, along with 181 variables describing countries in terms of their 
agriculture, culture, demography, disease burden, education, healthcare 
organization and socioeconomics. After assessing data availability, overlap and 
relevance, multiple imputation generalized estimating equations were applied 
with a stepwise selection procedure to select significant determinants of global 
antibiotic use (expressed in DIDs), relative use of subgroups (amoxicillin and 
co-amoxiclav) and resistance of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
RESULTS: Relative humidity, healthcare expenditure proportional to gross 
domestic product, feelings of distrust, proportion of population aged >65 years 
and availability of treatment guidelines were associated with higher total 
antibiotic use expressed in DIDs. Restrictions on marketing activities towards 
prescribers, population density, number of antibiotics, educational attainment 
and degree of atheism were associated with a lower number of total DIDs used. 
Relative prescribing of amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav was mainly determined by 
healthcare system choices [e.g. general practitioner (GP) registration and 
restricted marketing]. Specific antibiotic use was found to be a significant 
determinant of resistance for some but not all drug/organism combinations. 
Incentives to stimulate GP gatekeeping were associated with lower levels of 
resistance, and life expectancy at age 65+ and atheism were associated with more 
resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: Myriad factors influence antibiotic use and resistance at the 
country level and an important part of these can be modified by policy choices.

The BUILD model was created to provide a systematic framework for hospice 
clinicians to have important conversations with patients and families as well as 
facilitating useful conversations with interdisciplinary teammates. Although 
this article focuses on medication appropriateness and discontinuation of 
medications, this model can also be used when discussing prognosis, code status, 
goals of care, drug diversion, and when collaborating to develop a plan of care. 
When provided with a communication tool that is versatile, logical, and 
effective, hospice clinicians may use it, supporting improved patient care 
outcomes.

University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.

BACKGROUND: This study was designed to determine the surgical outcomes of 
gastric cancer in elderly patients. This information can help establish 
appropriate treatment for these patients.
METHODS: A total of 1,193 patients with gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy 
between 1995 and 2010 were enrolled in this retrospective study. The 
clinicopathologic features of 104 elderly patients (aged ≥80 years) were 
compared with those of 1,089 nonelderly patients.
RESULTS: (1) Tumors located in the lower-third of the stomach, differentiated 
cancer, and surgery with limited lymph node dissection were more common in 
elderly patients. However, there was no difference in the proportion of 
laparoscopic gastrectomy between elderly and nonelderly patients. (2) Although 
surgical complication rates were similar in the two groups, the operative 
mortality rate was higher in elderly patients (1.9 %) than in nonelderly 
patients (0.7 %). (3) Elderly patients had a significantly poorer overall 
survival rate, whereas the disease-specific survival rates of the two groups 
were similar. Limited lymph node dissection did not influence the 
disease-specific survival rate of elderly patients. (4) The median life 
expectancy of elderly gastric cancer survivors was 9.8 years in patients aged 
80-84 years and 6.0 years in those ≥85 years. The patients with limited lymph 
node dissection had slightly better prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The treatment results in elderly patients were comparable to those 
in nonelderly patients. These findings suggest that R0 resection with at least 
limited lymph node dissection according to Japanese guidelines should be 
considered, even for elderly patients.

We report 3 cases of pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in patients with advanced 
cancer who received palliative care. All patients received long-term steroid 
therapy for symptom management. A diagnosis of PCP was based on clinical 
symptoms and a positive Pneumocystis jiroveci polymerase chain reaction test 
from induced sputum specimens. Despite appropriate treatment, only 1 patient 
recovered from PCP. Long-term steroid, often prescribed in palliative care 
settings, is the most common risk factor for PCP in non-HIV patients. 
Pneumocystis pneumonia may cause distressing symptoms such as severe dyspnea, 
and the mortality rate is high. Therefore, it is important to consider PCP 
prophylaxis for high-risk patients and to diagnose PCP early and provide 
appropriate treatment to alleviate PCP-related symptoms and avert unnecessary 
shortening of a patient's life expectancy.

An experiment was conducted on pear fruit (cv. 'Lagoon') to extend the shelf 
life by using different packaging materials. Fruits were packed in low density 
polyethylene (LDPE, 0.025 mm), polypropylene (PP, 0.025 mm), linear low density 
polyethylene (LLDPE, 0.0125 mm) and high density polyethylene (HDPE, 0.025 mm) 
with or without perforation and stored at ambient condition (25 ± 2 °C and 
65.0 ± 5% RH). Periodical observations were recorded on CO2 & O2 concentration 
(%), physiological loss in weight (PLW, %), decay loss (%), firmness (kgf), 
colour value (colour difference and colour index), total soluble solid (TSS, 
°Brix), acidity (mg of malic acid/g), and ascorbic acid loss (%) at 3 days 
interval. Reduced rate of PLW and decay losses was recorded in pear fruits 
packed in PP non-perforated (8.04%) and PP perforated (12.5%), respectively as 
compared to other treatments. The maximum firmness (5.18 kgf) and minimum 
ascorbic acid loss (49.97%) were also recorded in PP non-perforated up to 12 and 
15 days of storage, respectively. It could be inferred that the, PP 
non-perforated (0.025 mm) was the most suitable packaging materials for 
extending the shelf life of pear fruits up to 15 days at ambient condition.

A novel marker procalcitonin may help stem the antibiotic overuse in emergency 
setting.

Faridkot, Punjab, India.

The day the wonder drugs, antibiotics, were available for cure to humans; 
dramatic rise of average life expectancy has been recorded compared to past. 
However, disease-causing microbes that have developed resistance to antibiotics 
are an increasing public health problem. Recently, superbug emergence was 
reported in some countries including India. One of the reasons quoted was misuse 
of antibiotics. Clinical signs and symptoms of infection often do not point 
towards the etiology. The dilemma occurs as diagnosis of sepsis is difficult 
because of nonspecificity of clinical signs and symptoms, and frequent 
overlapping of symptoms with other noninfectious causes of systemic 
inflammation. Key for improving survival rates lies in early diagnosis and 
treatment. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels measuring in sick patients during 
infection may be valuable in diagnosing the conditions, and its changing levels 
have some prognostic value too.

Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Many changes have been made in different sciences by developing and 
advancing information and communication technology in last two decades. E-health 
is a very broad term that includes many different activities related to the use 
of electronic devices, software as well as hardware in health organizations.
AIMS: The aim of this study is comparing electronic health indicators in the 
selected countries and discussion on the best indicators.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This study has chosen 12 countries randomly based on the 
regional division of the WHO. The relevant numbers of health indicators and 
general indicators and information technology indicators are extracted of these 
countries. We use data from the Bitarf's comparative study, which is conducted 
by the Iranian Supreme Council of Information Technology in 2007.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: By using Pearson correlation test, the relations between 
health general indicators and IT indicators are studied.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data was analyzed based on the research objectives 
using SPSS software and in accordance with research questions Pearson 
correlation test were used.
RESULTS: The findings show that there is a positive relation between indicators 
related to IT and "Total per capita health, healthy life expectancy, percent 
literacy". Furthermore, there is a mutual relation between IT indicators and 
"mortality indicator".
CONCLUSION: This study showed differences between selective indicators among 
different countries. The modern world, with its technological advances, is not 
powerless in the face of these geographic and health disparity challenges. 
Researchers must not rely on the available indicators. They must consider 
indicators like e-business companies, electronic data internet, medical 
supplies, health electronic record, health information system, etc., In future, 
continuous studies in this field, to provide the exact and regular reports of 
amount of using of these indicators through different countries must be 
necessary.

PURPOSE: To determine the long-term cost-effectiveness of osteo-odonto 
keratoprosthesis (OOKP) relative to no treatment among patients with end-stage 
corneal and ocular surface diseases in Singapore.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on data from a retrospective cohort 
study.
METHODS: From a health system perspective, we calculated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of OOKP treatment relative to no treatment over a 
30-year horizon, based on data from a cohort of 23 patients who underwent OOKP 
surgery between 2004 and 2009 at Singapore National Eye Centre. Preoperative and 
postoperative vision-related quality-of-life values were estimated from 
patients' visual outcomes and were used to calculate the gain in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) resulting from OOKP treatment. Unsubsidized 
costs for surgery, consultations, examinations, medications, follow-up visits, 
and treatments for complications were retrieved from patients' bills to estimate 
the total costs associated with OOKP treatment. Sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to test the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: Over a 30-year period, OOKP treatment, compared with no treatment, 
improved QALYs by 3.991 among patients with end-stage corneal and ocular surface 
diseases at an additional cost of S$67 840 (US$55 150), resulting in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of S$17 000/QALY (US$13 820/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on commonly cited cost-effectiveness benchmarks, the OOKP is 
a cost-effective treatment for patients with end-stage corneal and ocular 
surface diseases.

Sciences Hiroshima University, Japan E-mail : ktr5124@rerf.or.jp.

Here we assessed the effectiveness of cervical cancer screening using data from 
the Hiroshima Prefecture Cancer Registry regarding patient age at the start of 
screening and differences in screening intervals. A screening model was created 
to calculate the health status in relation to prognosis following cervical 
cancer screening and its influence on life expectancy. Epidemiological data on 
the mortality rate of cervical cancer by age groups and mortality rates from the 
Hiroshima Prefecture Cancer Registry were used for the model projections. Our 
results showed that life expectancy when screening rate was 100% compared with 
0% was extended by approximately 1 month. Furthermore, when the incidence of 
cervical cancer was 0% compared with the screening rate was 100%, life 
expectancy was extended by a maximum of 3 months. Moreover, among individuals 
affected by cervical cancer, a difference of 13 years in life expectancy was 
calculated between screened and unscreened groups.

In a population of individuals, whose mortality is governed by a 
Gompertz-Makeham hazard, we derive closed-form solutions to the life-expectancy 
integral, corresponding to the cases of homogeneous and gamma-heterogeneous 
populations, as well as in the presence/absence of the Makeham term. Derived 
expressions contain special functions that aid constructing high-accuracy 
approximations, which can be used to study the elasticity of life expectancy 
with respect to model parameters. Knowledge of Gompertz-Makeham life 
expectancies aids constructing life-table exposures.

BACKGROUND: Endoprosthetic replacement (EPR) for limb salvage is an established 
treatment modality for orthopaedic malignancies around the knee. Increasingly, 
they are being used for non-tumour indications such as fractures, bone loss 
associated with aseptic loosening, septic loosening and ligament 
insufficiencies.
METHODS: We reviewed the evolution and biomechanics of knee EPRs. MEDLINE was 
searched using the PubMed interface to identify relevant studies pertaining to 
the use of knee EPRs in non-tumour conditions. Failures, mortality and knee 
scores were the main outcome measures. Subgroup analysis in the non-tumour 
conditions was also performed.
RESULTS: There were nine studies with an average follow-up of 3.3years (Range 
1-5years) describing 241 EPRs used in non-tumour conditions. Re-operation for 
any reason occurred in 17% (41/241) of cases. The most common complication was 
infection (15%) followed by aseptic loosening (5%) and periprosthetic fractures 
(5%). The mortality rate averaged 22%. Infected knee arthroplasties were less 
likely to have a successful outcome when salvaged with an EPR with failure rates 
up to 33%.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoprosthetic replacement is a limb salvage option when other 
surgical options are unfeasible, especially in low demand elderly patients with 
limited life expectancy. They have low rates of failure in the medium term.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 1.

Multi-fragment site-directed mutagenic overlap extension polymerase chain 
reaction as a competitive alternative to the enzymatic assembly method.

Laboratory University of Uppsala, SE-751 23 Uppsala, Sweden.

Methods for introducing multiple site-directed mutations are important 
experimental tools in molecular biology. Research areas that use these methods 
include the investigation of various protein modifications in cellular 
processes, modifying proteins for efficient recombinant expression, and the 
stabilization of mRNAs to allow for increased protein expression. Introducing 
multiple site-directed mutations is also an important tool in the field of 
synthetic biology. There are two main methods used in the assembling of 
fragments generated by mutagenic primers: enzymatic assembly and overlap 
extension polymerase chain reaction (OE-PCR). In this article, we present an 
improved OE-PCR method that can be used for the generation of large DNA 
fragments (up to 7.4 kb) where at least 13 changes can be introduced using a 
genomic template. The improved method is faster (due to fewer reaction steps) 
and more accurate (due to fewer PCR cycles), meaning that it can effectively 
compete with the enzymatic assembly method. Data presented here show that the 
site-directed mutations can be introduced anywhere between 50 and 1800 bp from 
each other. The method is highly reliable and predicted to be applicable to most 
DNA engineering when the introduction of multiple changes in a DNA sequence is 
required.

Cost-effectiveness of computer-tailored smoking cessation advice in primary 
care: a randomized trial (ESCAPE).

INTRODUCTION: Smoking remains a significant public health problem and is a 
leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality around the world. By 
combining the behavioral intervention principles used in specialist services 
with the high reach rates of public health interventions, personal tailored 
self-help cessation intervention provides a potential economical method for 
improving reach and effectiveness.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis is performed alongside a randomized 
controlled trial to compare the computer-tailored self-help intervention with a 
generic self-help intervention in smoking cessation. A Markov model was 
developed to extrapolate lifetime cost-effectiveness by combining trial data 
with estimates from the literature.
FINDINGS: In the short term, smokers in the intervention group gained 0.0006 
(95% CI = -0.0024 to 0.0036) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) more than those 
in the control group at an increased cost of about £9 per person (95% CI = 
£5-£12). This yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
£14,432/QALY. Precision of the ICER estimates was assessed by 5,000 
bootstrapping replications. The probability that the intervention was cost 
effective was 54% (58%) at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000(£30,000) 
per QALY. The Markov model showed that simulating lifetime outcomes improved the 
cost-effectiveness ratio (£9,700/QALY) in favor of the tailored intervention. 
The intervention would have a 55%-57% chance of being more cost effective than 
nontailored intervention at the willingness-to-pay threshold of 
£20,000-30,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The computer-tailored intervention appears slightly more likely to 
be cost effective than the generic self-help intervention in smoking cessation, 
in both the short term and the long term, but caution is required given the 
considerable uncertainty surrounding the estimates.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine for the screening 
of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and identify changes within the demographics of a 
patient population after telemedicine implementation.
DESIGN: A retrospective medical chart review (cohort study) was conducted.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 900 type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients enrolled in a 
medical system with a telemedicine screening program for DR.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of the DR telemedicine program was determined by 
using a finite-horizon, discrete time, discounted Markov decision process model 
populated by parameters and testing frequency obtained from patient records. The 
model estimated the progression of DR and determined average quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) saved and average additional cost incurred by the 
telemedicine screening program.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, blindness, and 
associated QALYs.
RESULTS: The results indicate that telemedicine screening is cost-effective for 
DR under most conditions. On average, it is cost-effective for patient 
populations of >3500, patients aged <80 years, and all racial groups. Observable 
trends were identified in the screening population since the implementation of 
telemedicine screening: the number of known DR cases has increased, the overall 
age of patients receiving screenings has decreased, the percentage of nonwhites 
receiving screenings has increased, the average number of miles traveled by a 
patient to receive a screening has decreased, and the teleretinal screening 
participation is increasing.
CONCLUSIONS: The current teleretinal screening program is effective in terms of 
being cost-effective and increasing population reach. Future screening policies 
should give consideration to the age of patients receiving screenings and the 
system's patient pool size because our results indicate it is not cost-effective 
to screen patients aged older than 80 years or in populations with <3500 
patients.

METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to simulate appendicitis during 
pregnancy taking into consideration the health outcomes for both the pregnant 
women and developing fetuses. Strategies included diagnostic laparoscopy, CT, 
and MRI. Outcomes included positive appendectomy, negative appendectomy, 
maternal perioperative complications, preterm delivery, fetal loss, childhood 
cancer, lifetime costs, discounted life expectancy, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging is the most cost-effective strategy, costing 
$6,767 per quality-adjusted life-year gained relative to CT, well below the 
generally accepted $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year threshold. In a 
setting where MRI is unavailable, CT is cost-effective even when considering the 
increased risk of radiation-associated childhood cancer ($560 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained relative to diagnostic laparoscopy). Unless 
the negative appendectomy rate is less than 1%, imaging of any type is more 
cost-effective than proceeding directly to diagnostic laparoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: Depending on imaging costs and resource availability, both CT and 
MRI are potentially cost-effective. The risk of radiation-associated childhood 
cancer from CT has little effect on population-level outcomes or 
cost-effectiveness but is a concern for individual patients. For pregnant women 
with suspected appendicitis, an extremely high level of clinical diagnostic 
certainty must be reached before proceeding to operation without preoperative 
imaging.

[Primary myelofibrosis--pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment].

[Article in Norwegian]

Ghanima W, Knutsen H, Delabie J, Bruserud Ø.

BACKGROUND: Primary myelofibrosis is a malignant myeloproliferative disease. It 
is characterised by proliferation of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, 
dysregulated cytokine production and reactive fibrosis that causes bone marrow 
failure. The purpose of this article is to provide an up-to-date presentation of 
the pathophysiology, diagnostics and treatment of the disease.
METHOD: The article is based on the authors' own experience and on a selection 
of articles identified through many years of experience of treating patients 
with myelofibrosis.
RESULTS: The molecular mechanisms that trigger the disease remain unidentified, 
but mutations in two genes (JAK2 and MPL) occur in 70% of patients and result in 
increased production of haematopoietic cells. Diagnosis is based on clinical 
examination, bone marrow histology and molecular biological examinations. The 
clinical course of primary myelofibrosis varies. Life expectancy depends on a 
number of factors and is severely decreased by high-risk disease. Allogeneic 
stem cell transplantation is the only treatment with a curative potential, but 
only a minority of patients are eligible for it. If transplantation is not 
possible, therapy is symptomatic. JAK2-inhibitors are new drugs that counteract 
cytokine production and cell proliferation. Ruxolitinib is the first approved 
JAK2 inhibitor and has proved effective on symptoms and quality of life.
INTERPRETATION: Medical inhibition of the JAK2 gene and associated JAK-STAT 
signalling pathway is a step forward in treatment. However, stem cell 
transplantation remains the only potentially curative treatment for 
myelofibrosis.

In order to manage the rise in life expectancy and the concomitant increased 
occurrence of age-related diseases, research into ageing has become a strategic 
priority. Mouse models are commonly utilised as they share high homology with 
humans and show many similar signs and diseases of ageing. However, the time and 
cost needed to rear aged cohorts can limit research opportunities. Sharing of 
resources can provide an ethically and economically superior framework to 
overcome some of these issues but requires dedicated infrastructure. Shared 
Ageing Research Models (ShARM) ( www.ShARMUK.org ) is a new, not-for-profit 
organisation funded by Wellcome Trust, open to all investigators. It collects, 
stores and distributes flash frozen tissues from aged murine models through its 
biorepository and provides a database of live ageing mouse colonies available in 
the UK and abroad. It also has an online environment (MICEspace) for collation 
and analysis of data from communal models and discussion boards on subjects such 
as the welfare of ageing animals and common endpoints for intervention studies. 
Since launching in July 2012, thanks to the generosity of researchers in UK and 
Europe, ShARM has collected more than 2,500 tissues and has in excess of 2,000 
mice registered in live ageing colonies. By providing the appropriate support, 
ShARM has been able to bring together the knowledge and experience of 
investigators in the UK and Europe to maximise research outputs with little 
additional cost and minimising animal use in order to facilitate progress in 
ageing research.

The increase in life expectancy in the western world means that we are faced 
with patients diagnosed with breast cancer in old age with increasing frequency. 
The management of these cases is a challenge for the oncologist, who must take 
into account the conditions associated with advanced age and the lack of trials 
in this population. In this review, we addressed the incorporation of geriatric 
assessment methods that may be useful in making decisions, the particular 
biological characteristics of breast cancer in elderly patients and their 
treatment in both localized and advanced disease. Finally, we collected 
recommendations based on scientific evidence regarding the monitoring and 
life-style after finishing treatment.

Comment in
    Br J Psychiatry. 2014 Feb;204(2):164.

In schizophrenia, life expectancy is reduced by 20 years, primarily due to 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Physical activity modifies CVD risk factors, but 
physical activity levels are low in this patient group. We urgently need 
evidence-based interventions that increase physical activity to improve health 
and reduce premature mortality in people with schizophrenia.

Human immunodeficiency virus infection and kidney disease.

Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996, 
mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has 
decreased markedly. As a result, morbidity from other chronic conditions such as 
kidney, liver and heart disease is increasing. This is in part as a natural 
consequence of ageing, and in part due to the higher risk of solid organ failure 
in these individuals. This higher risk is related to the co-morbidities 
associated with HIV infection and to the metabolic consequences of drug therapy. 
Kidney disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with 
HIV infection and encompasses a range of clinical presentations including acute 
kidney injury, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage kidney disease. Black 
race is the most important predictor of kidney disease in HIV-infected persons 
due to both genetic and modifiable causes. HIVassociated nephropathy (HIVAN) is 
caused by viral infection of the renal epithelium and, although decreasing in 
incidence, remains the most common cause of CKD in HIV-infected persons. In 
addition to HIVAN, a wide spectrum of other histopathological presentations, 
many of which are immune complex-mediated, is increasingly recognised. 
Clinicians who treat these patients should be aware of the nephrotoxic potential 
of several commonly used medications, particularly antiviral agents, and also 
the need to dose-adjust medication in renal impairment. The increased life 
expectancy of patients with HIV and end-stage kidney disease has meant that 
kidney transplantation is increasingly an option. Results from carefully 
conducted prospective studies are promising, at least in the short term.

Is it worthwhile to conduct a randomized controlled trial of glaucoma screening 
in the United Kingdom?

OBJECTIVES: To assess the value of conducting a glaucoma screening randomized 
controlled trial in the UK.
METHODS: Decision model based economic evaluation and value of information 
analysis. Model derived from a previous health technology assessment. Model 
updated in terms of structure and parameter estimates with data from surveys, 
interviews with members of the public and health care providers and routine 
sources.
RESULTS: On average, across a range of ages of initiating screening (40-60 
years), glaucoma prevalence (1-5%), screening uptake (30-100%), and the 
performance of current case finding, screening was not cost-effective at a 
£30,000 threshold per quality adjusted life year (QALY) from the perspective of 
the National Health Service (NHS). The societal value of removing all 
uncertainty around glaucoma screening is £107 million at a threshold of £20,000 
per QALY. For informing policy decisions on glaucoma screening, reducing 
uncertainty surrounding the NHS and personal social care cost of sight 
impairment (£74 million) was of most value, followed by reducing uncertainty in 
test performance (£14 million) and uptake of either screening or current eye 
care (£8 million each).
CONCLUSIONS: A glaucoma screening trial in the UK is unlikely to be the best use 
of research resources. Further research to quantify the costs of sight 
impairment falling on the NHS and personal social services is a priority. 
Further development of glaucoma tests and research into strategies to promote 
the uptake of screening or current eye care such as through the use of a 
behavioural intervention would be worthwhile.

Spindler KP; MOON Knee Group.

BACKGROUND: An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is a common knee injury, 
particularly among young and active individuals. Little is known, however, about 
the societal impacts of ACL tears, which could be large given the typical 
patient age and increased lifetime risk of knee osteoarthritis. This study 
evaluates the cost-effectiveness of ACL reconstruction compared with structured 
rehabilitation only.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis of ACL reconstruction compared with structured 
rehabilitation only was conducted with use of a Markov decision model over two 
time horizons: the short to intermediate term (six years), on the basis of 
Level-I evidence derived from the KANON Study and the Multicenter Orthopaedic 
Outcomes Network (MOON) database; and the lifetime, on the basis of a 
comprehensive literature review. Utilities were assessed with use of the SF-6D. 
Costs (in 2012 U.S. dollars) were estimated from the societal perspective and 
included the effects of the ACL tear on work status, earnings, and disability. 
Effectiveness was expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: In the short to intermediate term, ACL reconstruction was both less 
costly (a cost reduction of $4503) and more effective (a QALY gain of 0.18) 
compared with rehabilitation. In the long term, the mean lifetime cost to 
society for a typical patient undergoing ACL reconstruction was $38,121 compared 
with $88,538 for rehabilitation. ACL reconstruction resulted in a mean 
incremental cost savings of $50,417 while providing an incremental QALY gain of 
0.72 compared with rehabilitation. Effectiveness gains were driven by the higher 
probability of an unstable knee and associated lower utility in the 
rehabilitation group. Results were most sensitive to the rate of knee 
instability after initial rehabilitation.
CONCLUSIONS: ACL reconstruction is the preferred cost-effective treatment 
strategy for ACL tears and yields reduced societal costs relative to 
rehabilitation once indirect cost factors, such as work status and earnings, are 
considered. The cost of an ACL tear over the lifetime of a patient is 
substantial, and resources should be directed to developing innovations for 
injury prevention and for altering the natural history of an ACL injury.

Cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor and generic clopidogrel in patients with acute 
coronary syndrome in Switzerland.

Gasche D(1), Ulle T, Meier B, Greiner RA.

Author information:
(1)IMS Health, Munich, Germany; dgasche@es.imshealth.com.

QUESTION UNDER STUDY: The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor and generic clopidogrel as add-on therapy to 
acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), from 
a Swiss perspective.
METHODS: Based on the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, 
one-year mean healthcare costs per patient treated with ticagrelor or generic 
clopidogrel were analysed from a payer perspective in 2011. A two-part 
decision-analytic model estimated treatment costs, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), life years and the cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor and generic 
clopidogrel in patients with ACS up to a lifetime at a discount of 2.5% per 
annum. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime, treatment with ticagrelor generates an 
additional 0.1694 QALYs and 0.1999 life years at a cost of CHF 260 compared with 
generic clopidogrel. This results in an Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio 
(ICER) of CHF 1,536 per QALY and CHF 1,301 per life year gained. Ticagrelor 
dominated generic clopidogrel over the five-year and one-year periods with 
treatment generating cost savings of CHF 224 and 372 while gaining 0.0461 and 
0.0051 QALYs and moreover 0.0517 and 0.0062 life years, respectively. Univariate 
sensitivity analyses confirmed the dominant position of ticagrelor in the first 
five years and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed a high probability of 
cost-effectiveness over a lifetime.
CONCLUSION: During the first five years after ACS, treatment with ticagrelor 
dominates generic clopidogrel in Switzerland. Over a patient's lifetime, 
ticagrelor is highly cost-effective compared with generic clopidogrel, proven by 
ICERs significantly below commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds.

Infliximab dose reduction sustains the clinical treatment effect in active 
HLAB27 positive ankylosing spondylitis: a two-year pilot study.

at Gothenburg University, Guldhedsgatan 10A, 41346 Gothenburg, Sweden.

The rationale of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of infliximab (IFX) 
treatment in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and to determine whether 
IFX dose reduction and interval extension sustains the treatment effect. 
Nineteen patients were included and treated with IFX 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks for 
56 weeks. All patients concomitantly received MTX with median dose 
7.5 mg/weekly. During the second year, the IFX dose was reduced to 3 mg/kg every 
8 weeks. Eighteen patients completed the 1-year and 15 patients the 2-year 
trial. The ≥50% improvement at week 16 from baseline of BASDAI was achieved in 
16/19 (84%) patients. Significant reductions in BASDAI, BASFI, and BASMI scores, 
decrease in ESR and CRP, and improvement in SF-36 were observed at weeks 16 and 
56. The MRI-defined inflammatory changes in the sacroiliac joints disappeared in 
10/15 patients (67%) already at 16 weeks. IFX treatment effect was sustained 
throughout the second year after IFX dose reduction and interval extension. We 
conclude that IFX treatment is effective in well-established active AS and a 
dose reduction sustains the treatment effect. These observations are of clinical 
importance and open the opportunity to reduce the drug costs.

Author information:
(1)University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective population-based study with mortality follow-up.
OBJECTIVE: To study mortality, causes and risk factors for death in Estonian 
patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI).
SETTING: All Estonian hospitals.
METHODS: Medical records of patients with TSCI from all regional, central, 
general, and rehabilitation hospitals in Estonia from 1997 to 2007, were 
retrospectively reviewed. Mortality status was ascertained as of 31 December 
2011. Causes of death were collected from the Estonian Causes of Death Registry. 
Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for the entire sample and 
for causes of death. A Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to identify 
the risk indicators for death.
RESULTS: During the observation period (1997-2011) 162 patients of 595 died. 
Nearly half of the patients (n = 76) died during the first year after TSCI. The 
main causes of death were external causes (30%), cardiovascular disease (29%). 
and suicide (8%). The overall SMR was 2.81 (95% confidence interval 2.40-3.28) 
and SMR was higher for women than for men (3.80 vs. 2.70). Cause-specific SMRs 
were markedly elevated for sepsis and suicide. Mortality was significantly 
affected by the age at the time of injury, neurological level, and extent of the 
injury as well as the year of TSCI and complications.
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy is significantly decreased in patients with TSCI in 
Estonia compared with the general population. Deaths during the first year after 
the injury have an important impact on statistics. Treatment of cardiovascular 
diseases, infections, and prevention of suicide are useful for reducing 
mortality in patients with TSCI.

Long-term survival after intensive care unit discharge in Thailand: a 
retrospective study.

Luangasanatip N, Hongsuwan M, Lubell Y, Limmathurotsakul D, Teparrukkul P, 
Chaowarat S, Day NP, Graves N, Cooper BS.

INTRODUCTION: Economic evaluations of interventions in the hospital setting 
often rely on the estimated long-term impact on patient survival. Estimates of 
mortality rates and long-term outcomes among patients discharged alive from the 
intensive care unit (ICU) are lacking from lower- and middle-income countries. 
This study aimed to assess the long-term survival and life expectancy (LE) 
amongst post-ICU patients in Thailand, a middle-income country.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data from a regional tertiary 
hospital in northeast Thailand and the regional death registry were linked and 
used to assess patient survival time after ICU discharge. Adult ICU patients 
aged at least 15 years who had been discharged alive from an ICU between 1 
January 2004 and 31 December 2005 were included in the study, and the death 
registry was used to determine deaths occurring in this cohort up to 31st 
December 2010. These data were used in conjunction with standard mortality life 
tables to estimate annual mortality and life expectancy.
