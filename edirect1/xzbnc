AIM: The aim of the present study was to compute total life expectancy (TLE), 
active life expectancy (ALE) and inactive life expectancy among older 
Singaporeans by gender, education and ethnicity.
METHODS: Data from a longitudinal survey of older Singaporeans were used. No 
difficulty in carrying out activities of daily living or instrumental activities 
of daily living was considered as "active." Transition probabilities across 
health states (active/inactive/dead) were assessed to develop multistate life 
tables, which estimated TLE, ALE and inactive life expectancy.
RESULTS: At age 60 years, women, versus men, had significantly higher TLE (25.9, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 24.0-27.8 vs 21.6, 95% CI 20.1-23.1), but similar 
ALE (18.1, 95% CI 17.0-19.2 vs 18.9, 95% CI 17.7-20.2). Those with high 
(secondary or higher), versus low (primary or less), education had significantly 
higher TLE (28.5, 95% CI 25.0-32.0 vs 22.5, 95% CI 21.1-23.9) and ALE (23.5, 95% 
CI 21.2-25.7 vs 17.1, 95% CI 16.1-18.0) at age 60 years. Those of Chinese, 
versus non-Chinese, ethnicity had significantly higher ALE at age 60 years 
(19.4, 95% CI 18.4-20.3 vs 15.0, 95% CI 13.4-16.7).
CONCLUSION: Unlike Western nations, there was no gender difference in ALE among 
older adults in Singapore. However, difference in ALE by education among older 
Singaporeans was similar to that observed in Western societies. Policies 
focusing specifically on improving women's health at all ages, in addition to 
policies that increase population education levels, are promising approaches to 
improving ALE. Recognizing ethnic differences in ALE will help target policies 
that increase ALE in multicultural societies.

BACKGROUND: The NCIC CTG LY.12 study showed that gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and 
cisplatin (GDP) were noninferior to dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin 
(DHAP) in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive histology lymphoma 
prior to autologous stem cell transplantation. We conducted an economic 
evaluation from the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare system based 
on trial data.
METHODS: The primary outcome was an incremental cost utility analysis comparing 
costs and benefits associated with GDP vs DHAP. Resource utilization data were 
collected from 519 Canadian patients in the trial. Costs were presented in 2012 
Canadian dollars and disaggregated to highlight the major cost drivers of care. 
Benefit was measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) based on utilities 
translated from prospectively collected quality-of-life data. All statistical 
tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: The mean overall costs of treatment per patient in the GDP and DHAP 
arms were $19 961 (95% confidence interval (CI) = $17 286 to $24 565) and $34 
425 (95% CI = $31 901 to $39 520), respectively, with an incremental difference 
in direct medical costs of $14 464 per patient in favor of GDP (P < .001). The 
predominant cost driver for both treatment arms was related to hospitalizations. 
The mean discounted quality-adjusted overall survival with GDP was 0.161 QALYs 
and 0.152 QALYs for DHAP (difference = 0.01 QALYs, P = .146). In probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, GDP was associated with both cost savings and improved 
quality-adjusted outcomes compared with DHAP in 92.6% of cost-pair simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: GDP was associated with both lower costs and similar 
quality-adjusted outcomes compared with DHAP in patients with relapsed or 
refractory lymphoma. Considering both costs and outcomes, GDP was the dominant 
therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Stem cell transplantation has been used for many years to treat 
haematological malignancies that could not be cured by other treatments. Despite 
this medical breakthrough, mortality rates remain high. Our purpose was to 
evaluate labour productivity losses associated with premature mortality due to 
blood cancer in recipients of stem cell transplantations.
METHODS: We collected primary data from the clinical histories of blood cancer 
patients who had undergone stem cell transplantation between 2006 and 2011 in 
two Spanish hospitals. We carried out a descriptive analysis and calculated the 
years of potential life lost and years of potential productive life lost. Labour 
productivity losses due to premature mortality were estimated using the Human 
Capital method. An alternative approach, the Friction Cost method, was used as 
part of the sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Our findings suggest that, in a population of 179 transplanted and 
deceased patients, males and people who die between the ages of 30 and 49 years 
generate higher labour productivity losses. The estimated loss amounts to over 
€31.4 million using the Human Capital method (€480,152 using the Friction Cost 
method), which means an average of €185,855 per death. The highest labour 
productivity losses are produced by leukaemia. However, lymphoma generates the 
highest loss per death.
CONCLUSIONS: Further efforts are needed to reduce premature mortality in blood 
cancer patients undergoing transplantations and reduce economic losses.

OBJECTIVES: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a common premalignant lesion for which 
surveillance is recommended. This strategy is limited by considerable variations 
in clinical practice. We conducted an international, multidisciplinary, 
systematic search and evidence-based review of BE and provided consensus 
recommendations for clinical use in patients with nondysplastic, indefinite, and 
low-grade dysplasia (LGD).
METHODS: We defined the scope, proposed statements, and searched electronic 
databases, yielding 20,558 publications that were screened, selected online, and 
formed the evidence base. We used a Delphi consensus process, with an 80% 
agreement threshold, using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation) to categorize the quality of evidence and strength 
of recommendations.
RESULTS: In total, 80% of respondents agreed with 55 of 127 statements in the 
final voting rounds. Population endoscopic screening is not recommended and 
screening should target only very high-risk cases of males aged over 60 years 
with chronic uncontrolled reflux. A new international definition of BE was 
agreed upon. For any degree of dysplasia, at least two specialist 
gastrointestinal (GI) pathologists are required. Risk factors for cancer include 
male gender, length of BE, and central obesity. Endoscopic resection should be 
used for visible, nodular areas. Surveillance is not recommended for <5 years of 
life expectancy. Management strategies for indefinite dysplasia (IND) and LGD 
were identified, including a de-escalation strategy for lower-risk patients and 
escalation to intervention with follow-up for higher-risk patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In this uniquely large consensus process in gastroenterology, we 
made key clinical recommendations for the escalation/de-escalation of BE in 
clinical practice. We made strong recommendations for the prioritization of 
future research.

UK research spend in 2008 and 2012: comparing stroke, cancer, coronary heart 
disease and dementia.

Luengo-Fernandez R(1), Leal J(1), Gray A(1).

Old Road Campus, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.

OBJECTIVE: To assess UK governmental and charity research funding in 2012 for 
cancer, coronary heart disease (CHD), dementia and stroke, and to make 
comparisons with 2008 levels.
DESIGN: Analysis of research expenditure.
SETTING: United Kingdom.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We identified UK governmental agencies and charities 
providing health research funding to determine the 2012 levels of funding for 
cancer, CHD, dementia and stroke. Levels of research funding were compared to 
burden of disease measures, including prevalence, disability adjusted life years 
and economic burden.
RESULTS: The combined research funding into cancer, CHD, dementia and stroke by 
governmental and charity organisations in 2012 was £856 million, of which £544 
million (64%) was devoted to cancer, £166 million (19%) to CHD, £90 million 
(11%) to dementia and £56 million (7%) to stroke. For every £10 of health and 
social care costs attributable to each disease, cancer received £1.08 in 
research funding, CHD £0.65, stroke £0.19 and dementia £0.08. A considerable 
shift in the distribution of government research funding was observed between 
2008 and 2012. In 2008, 66% of governmental research funding into the four 
conditions under study was devoted to cancer, 21% to CHD, 9% to dementia and 4% 
to stroke. In 2012, the proportions devoted to dementia and stroke had increased 
to 21% and 12%, respectively, with cancer accounting for 45% of total research 
spend.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there has been much progress by government to increase 
levels of research funding for dementia and stroke, these areas remain 
underfunded when compared with the burden of disease.

OBJECTIVES: Communication of relevant prognostic information is critical in 
helping patients understand the implications of their cancer diagnosis. We 
describe measures of prognosis to help communicate relevant prognostic 
information to improve patients' understanding of the implications of their 
cancer diagnosis.
SETTING: Australia-wide population-based cancer registry cohort.
PARTICIPANTS: 870,878 patients aged 15-89 years diagnosed with invasive cancer 
between 1990 and 2007, with mortality follow-up information to December 2010.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Flexible parametric models were used to 
estimate loss of life expectancy (LOLE), remaining life expectancy (RLE) and 
10-year cumulative probability of cancer-specific death (1-relative survival).
RESULTS: On average, Australians diagnosed with cancer at age 40 years faced 
losing an average of 11.2 years of life (95% CI 11.1 to 11.4) due to their 
cancer, while those diagnosed at 80 years faced losing less, an average of 
3.9 years (3.9 to 4.0) because of higher competing mortality risks. In contrast, 
younger people had lower estimated cumulative probabilities of cancer-specific 
death within 10 years (40 years: 21.5%, 21.4% to 22.1%) compared with older 
people (80 years: 55.4%, 55.0% to 55.9%). The patterns for individual cancers 
varied widely, both by cancer type and by age within cancer type.
CONCLUSIONS: The LOLE and RLE measures provide complementary messages to 
standard relative survival estimates (expressed here in terms of cumulative 
probability of cancer-specific death). Importantly, relative survival per se 
underplays the greater absolute impact that a cancer diagnosis has at a younger 
age on LOLE. When presented in isolation for all cancers, it may provide a 
misleading impression of future mortality burden of cancer overall, and 
furthermore, it will obscure patterns of mortality by type and by age data 
within type. Alternative measures of LOLE, therefore, provide important 
communication about mortality risk to patients with cancer worldwide and should 
be incorporated into standard reporting and dissemination strategies.

Morphometrical, histopathological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural 
findings in human pulmonary tissue destruction following penetrating 
low-velocity firearm injuries to the lungs.

This autopsy-based study investigated the morphological correlates of pulmonary 
tissue destruction following fatal penetrating gunshot wounds to the lungs using 
morphometry, histology, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy 
on whole human lungs fixed-expanded via formalin inflation. As the residue of 
temporary cavity formation, mantle-like hemorrhagic destruction zones were seen 
surrounding the missile track that showed an eccentric, conical extension 
enlarging toward subpleural lung segments. In addition, circumscribed, 
satellite-like bleeding zones at distances of up to 5.5 cm beyond the border of 
the permanent cavity were observed that corresponded to interstitial 
perivascular hemorrhages around larger and smaller pulmonary vessels on the 
micro-morphological level. These multifocal hemorrhages within macroscopically 
unaffected parts of pulmonary tissue at some distance from the actual missile 
track may represent unrecognized, life-threatening intrapulmonary bleeding 
sources in survivors, potentially leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and 
progressive lung failure. A further noticeable microscopic and ultrastructural 
finding was that of club-shaped distensions of ruptured alveolar septa strictly 
limited to the extent of the temporary cavity. These club-shaped distensions of 
ruptured alveolar septa seem to represent a special feature of alveolar 
architectural damage that can be explained by the dynamics of the temporary 
cavity formation: the radial acceleration and overdistension of tissue during 
temporary cavitation initiates stretch mechanisms of the displaced tissue, 
causing the alveolar septa to rupture with subsequent foreshortening and pursing 
of elastic alveolar fibers.

PURPOSE: Difficulty swallowing, oropharyngeal dysphagia, is widespread among 
many patient populations (such as stroke and cancer groups) and aged 
community-dwelling individuals. It is commonly managed with bolus modification: 
altering food (usually cutting, mashing or puréeing) or fluids (typically 
thickening) to make them easier or safer to swallow. Although this treatment is 
ubiquitous, anecdotal evidence suggests patients dislike this management, and 
this may affect compliance and well-being. This review aimed to examine the 
impact of bolus modification on health-related quality of life.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted by speech 
pathologists with experience in oropharyngeal dysphagia. The literature search 
was completed with electronic databases, PubMed and Embase, and all available 
exclusion dates up to September 2012 were used. The search was limited to 
English-language publications which were full text and appeared in peer-reviewed 
journals.
RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Generally, bolus modification 
was typically associated with worse quality of life. Modifications to foods 
appeared to be more detrimental than modifications to fluids, but this may be 
due to the increased severity of dysfunction that is implied by the necessity 
for significant alterations to foods. The number of studies retrieved was quite 
small. The diverse nature of methodologies, terminologies and assessment 
procedures found in the studies makes the results difficult to generalise.
CONCLUSION: Overall, even though the severity of dysphagia may have been a 
confounding factor, the impact of bolus modification on health-related quality 
of life in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia appears to be negative, with 
increased modification of food and fluids often correlating to a decreased 
quality of life. Further, associated disease factors, such as decreased life 
expectancy, may also have affected health-related quality of life. More research 
is needed.

Cardiovascular disease, and in particular ischemic heart disease (IHD), is a 
major cause of morbidity and mortality in the very elderly (> 80 years) 
worldwide. These patients represent a rapidly growing cohort presenting for 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), now constituting more than one in five 
patients treated with PCI in real-world practice. Furthermore, they often have 
greater ischemic burden than their younger counterparts, suggesting that they 
have greater scope of benefit from coronary revascularization therapy. Despite 
this, the very elderly are frequently under-represented in clinical 
revascularization trials and historically there has been a degree of physician 
reluctance in referring them for PCI procedures, with perceptions of 
disappointing outcomes, low success and high complication rates. Several issues 
have contributed to this, including the tendency for older patients with IHD to 
present late, with atypical symptoms or non-diagnostic ECGs, and reservations 
regarding their procedural risk-to-benefit ratio, due to shorter life 
expectancy, presence of comorbidities and increased bleeding risk from 
antiplatelet and anticoagulation medications. However, advances in PCI 
technology and techniques over the past decade have led to better outcomes and 
lower risk of complications and the existing body of evidence now indicates that 
the very elderly actually derive more relative benefit from PCI than younger 
populations. Importantly, this applies to all PCI settings: elective, urgent and 
emergency. This review discusses the role of PCI in the very elderly presenting 
with chronic stable IHD, non ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, and 
ST-elevation myocardial infarction. It also addresses the clinical challenges 
met when considering PCI in this cohort and the ongoing need for research and 
development to further improve outcomes in these challenging patients.

Bucharest, Romania.

Acute pancreatitis is a serious disease. Triggered by the local inflammation of 
the pancreas, it can cause inflammation in various organs and systems in the 
body. It is important to identify severe forms of acute pancreatitis with an 
increased morbidity and mortality rate. Lately, internationally, numerous 
clinical and paraclinical factors predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis 
have been proposed. The purpose of the study is to identify the prognostic 
intraoperative factors of severity. The prospective study was conducted over a 
period of four years, between 2007 and 2010 and included 238 patients treated in 
a surgical clinic in Bucharest. 103 patients experienced a severe form of acute 
pancreatitis, which means 67.95% of all operations practiced. We monitored 
intraoperative factors, in particular: the presence and/ or the extent of 
pancreatic necrosis, common bile duct lithiasis and intraperitoneal fluid, 
parameters proposed to become statistically prognostic factors in the 
development and long-term morbidity of acute pancreatitis. The presence and/ or 
extension of necrosis was identified in the histopathology only in patients with 
severe acute pancreatitis. 71.43% of the patients with common bile duct 
lithiasis and 73.91% of the patients with inflammatory intraperitoneal fluid had 
severe acute pancreatitis. Most patients who developed postoperative 
complications (86.49%) or who required a surgical intervention (85.71%), 
presented a severe form of the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: pancreatic necrosis, common bile duct lithiasis and intraperitoneal 
fluid may contribute to a more precise prediction of severity, as confirmed by 
international literature.

BACKGROUND: The International Maternal, Pediatric, and Adolescent Clinical 
Trials P1060 trial demonstrated superior outcomes for HIV-infected children less 
than 3 years old initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) with 
lopinavir/ritonavir compared to nevirapine, but lopinavir/ritonavir is four-fold 
costlier.
DESIGN/METHODS: We used the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications 
(CEPAC)-Pediatric model, with published and P1060 data, to project outcomes 
under three strategies: no ART; first-line nevirapine (with second-line 
lopinavir/ritonavir); and first-line lopinavir/ritonavir (second-line 
nevirapine). The base-case examined South African children initiating ART at age 
12 months; sensitivity analyses varied all key model parameters. Outcomes 
included life expectancy, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios [ICERs; dollars/year of life saved ($/YLS)]. We considered interventions 
with ICERs less than 1× per-capita gross domestic product (South Africa: 
$7500)/YLS as 'very cost-effective,' interventions with ICERs below 3× gross 
domestic product/YLS as 'cost-effective,' and interventions leading to longer 
life expectancy and lower lifetime costs as 'cost-saving'.
RESULTS: Projected life expectancy was 2.8 years with no ART. Both ART regimens 
markedly improved life expectancy and were very cost-effective, compared to no 
ART. First-line lopinavir/ritonavir led to longer life expectancy (28.8 years) 
and lower lifetime costs ($41 350/person, from lower second-line costs) than 
first-line nevirapine (27.6 years, $44 030). First-line lopinavir/ritonavir 
remained cost-saving or very cost-effective compared to first-line nevirapine 
unless: liquid lopinavir/ritonavir led to two-fold higher virologic failure 
rates or 15-fold greater costs than in the base-case, or second-line ART 
following first-line lopinavir/ritonavir was very ineffective.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of P1060 data, first-line lopinavir/ritonavir leads to 
longer life expectancy and is cost-saving or very cost-effective compared to 
first-line nevirapine. This supports WHO guidelines, but increasing access to 
pediatric ART is critical regardless of the regimen used.

A novel "signal-on" photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor for sensitive detection 
of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II) DNA was developed on the 
basis of enzymatic amplification coupled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl 
transferase (TdT)-mediated extension strategy. The intensity of the photocurrent 
signal was proportional to the concentration of the HTLV-II DNA-target DNA 
(tDNA) by dual signal amplification. In this protocol, GR-CdS:Mn/ZnS 
nanocomposites were used as photoelectric conversion material, while pDNA was 
used as the tDNA recognizing unit. Moreover, the TdT-mediated extension and the 
enzymatic signal amplification technique were used to enhance the sensitivity of 
detection. Using this novel dual signal amplification strategy, the prototype of 
PEC DNA sensor can detect as low as ∼0.033 fM of HTLV-II DNA with a linear range 
of 0.1-5000 fM, with excellent differentiation ability even for single-base 
mismatches. This PEC DNA assay opens a promising platform to detect various DNA 
targets at ultralow levels for early diagnoses of different diseases.

Truncated cross-sectional average length of life: A measure for comparing the 
mortality history of cohorts.

Canudas-Romo V(1), Guillot M.

Author information:
(1)a University of Southern Denmark.

Period life expectancies are commonly used to compare populations, but these 
correspond to simple juxtapositions of current mortality levels. In order to 
construct life expectancies for cohorts, a complete historical series of 
mortality rates is needed, and these are available for only a subset of 
developed countries. The truncated cross-sectional average length of life (TCAL) 
is a new measure that captures historical information about all cohorts present 
at a given moment and is not limited to countries with complete cohort mortality 
data. The value of TCAL depends on the rates used to complete the cohort series, 
but differences between TCALs of two populations remain similar irrespective of 
the data used to complete the cohort series. This result is illustrated by a 
comparison of TCALs for the US with those for Denmark, Japan, and other 
high-longevity countries. Specific cohorts that account for most of the 
disparity in mortality between the populations are identified.

Epidemiological and demographic HIV/AIDS projections: South Africa.

Rehle TM(1), Shisana O.

Author information:

DC , 20003 , USA.

The Epidemic Projection Package (EPP) recently developed by the UNAIDS Reference 
Group on Estimates, Models and Projections and the Spectrum model program 
developed by the Futures Group were used to model the South African HIV 
epidemic, project future trends in HIV/AIDS and estimate the demographic impact 
of AIDS. The national HIV prevalence surveys among pregnant women from 1990-2001 
and the first national, population-based HIV survey in 2002 served as the data 
sets used to calibrate the input HIV prevalence values for the model. The 
scenario created by the model showed that a dramatic rise in HIV prevalence 
during the 1990s has peaked in 2002 with 4.69 million infected people and it is 
projected that the epidemic in South Africa has now begun to level off. Adult 
(15-49 years) incidence rates have decreased substantially in the past five 
years since 1997 (4.2%) and are expected to reach a level of 1.7% in 2003. The 
annual number of deaths due to AIDS is projected to peak with 487 320 AIDS 
deaths in the year 2008. By 2020, the total population of South Africa is 
expected to be 23% smaller than it would be without AIDS, however, a negative 
population growth rate is not expected during the projection period. Life 
expectancy at birth is expected to hit a low of 45.6 years in the time period 
2005-2010, which is 22 years less than it would have been in the absence of 
AIDS. Ten years from now over 2.5 million AIDS orphans are projected for South 
Africa. Models play an important role in estimating HIV variables that are 
difficult to measure. Projections of the future HIV/AIDS burden in South Africa 
underscore the importance of acting now to reduce the number of new infections 
and plan for medical and social care needs.

Racial and ethnic minority communities, including American Indian and Alaska 
Natives, have been disproportionately impacted by environmental pollution and 
contamination. This includes siting and location of point sources of pollution, 
legacies of contamination of drinking and recreational water, and mining, 
military and agricultural impacts. As a result, both quantity and quality of 
culturally important subsistence resources are diminished, contributing to poor 
nutrition and obesity, and overall reductions in quality of life and life 
expectancy. Climate change is adding to these impacts on Native American 
communities, variably causing drought, increased flooding and forced relocation 
affecting tribal water resources, traditional foods, forests and forest 
resources, and tribal health. This article will highlight several extramural 
research projects supported by the United States Environmental Protection Agency 
(USEPA) Science to Achieve Results (STAR) tribal environmental research grants 
as a mechanism to address the environmental health inequities and disparities 
faced by tribal communities. The tribal research portfolio has focused on 
addressing tribal environmental health risks through community based 
participatory research. Specifically, the STAR research program was developed 
under the premise that tribal populations may be at an increased risk for 
environmentally-induced diseases as a result of unique subsistence and 
traditional practices of the tribes and Alaska Native villages, community 
activities, occupations and customs, and/or environmental releases that 
significantly and disproportionately impact tribal lands. Through a series of 
case studies, this article will demonstrate how grantees-tribal community 
leaders and members and academic collaborators-have been addressing these 
complex environmental concerns by developing capacity, expertise and tools 
through community-engaged research.

INTRODUCTION: This study analyzes the incremental cost-effectiveness of Oncotype 
DX(®) testing to support adjuvant chemotherapy recommendations, versus current 
clinical practice, for patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)), 
node-negative or micrometastatic (pN1mic) early-stage breast cancer in The 
Netherlands.
METHODS: Markov model projecting distant recurrence, survival, quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) and healthcare costs over a 30-year time horizon.
RESULTS: Oncotype DX was projected to increase QALYs by 0.11 (0.07-0.58) and 
costs with €1236 (range: -€142-€1236) resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of €11,236/QALY under the most conservative scenario.
CONCLUSION: Reallocation of adjuvant chemotherapy based on Oncotype DX testing 
is most likely a cost-effective use of scarce resources, improving long-term 
survival and QALYs at marginal or lower costs.

BACKGROUND: Abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms (A/TAA) are an important 
cause of mortality amongst the older population. Although A/TAA repair can be 
performed with low peri-operative risk, overall life expectancy remains poor in 
the years that follow surgery. The majority of deaths are caused by heart attack 
or stroke, which can both be prevented by cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in 
patients with clinically-manifest coronary artery disease. A Cochrane review has 
urged researchers to widen the use of CR to other populations with severe 
cardiovascular risk, and patients surviving A/TAA repair appear ideal 
candidates. However, it is unknown whether CR is feasible or acceptable to A/TAA 
patients, who are a decade older than those currently enrolling in CR. 
Aneurysm-CaRe is a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will 
address these issues.
METHODS AND DESIGN: Aneurysm-CaRe is a pilot RCT of CR versus standard care 
after A/TAA repair, with the primary objectives of estimating enrolment to a 
trial of CR after A/TAA repair and estimating compliance with CR amongst 
patients with A/TAA. Aneurysm-CaRe will randomise 84 patients at two sites. 
Patients discharged from hospital after elective A/TAA repair will be randomised 
to standard care or enrolment in their local CR programme with a protocolised 
approach to medical cardiovascular risk reduction. The primary outcome measures 
are enrolment in the RCT and compliance with CR. Secondary outcomes will include 
phenotypic markers of cardiovascular risk and smoking cessation, alongside 
disease-specific and generic quality-of-life measures.

OBJECTIVE: To make an inventory of the number of intensive care (ICU) patients
