Apple cankers are extremely destructive diseases threatening the global apple 
industry through direct and indirect losses. The population structure of the 
pathogens is of paramount significance for the development of efficient 
management strategies. Therefore, phenotypic, pathogenic, and genetic diversity 
of Diplodia seriata causing black rot canker of apple was investigated in this 
study. All the isolates were included for investigating the in vitro mycelial 
growth, conidial dimensions, and pathogenic variability on two-year-old potted 
apple seedlings. The ISSR approach was used to investigate the molecular 
diversity of D. seriata. Mycelial growth rates were found to vary significantly 
amongst the isolates; however, there were no major variations seen between the 
different geographical groupings of isolates. Pathogenicity tests revealed 
variations in the size of cankers among the isolates indicating the presence of 
virulence variability. The isolates were segregated into three virulence groups 
based on canker length. The Bayesian analyses of ISSR data divided the isolates 
into two genetic clusters. The genetic clustering of the isolates revealed no 
relationship with geographical origin of the isolates. Furthermore, no direct 
relationship of genetic clustering was observed with morphological or pathogenic 
variability. The ISSR primers revealed very high level of variability in D. 
seriata; however, no distinct populations of the pathogen existed which is an 
indication of high level of gene flow between the diverse geographical 
populations. According to our knowledge, this is the first thorough 
investigation on the diversity of D. seriata associated with apple black rot 
canker in India.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection is 
higher in Asia than in Europe and North America and varies significantly between 
different regions within Asia. Important routes of transmission of both these 
infections include high-risk unprotected sexual contact, intravenous drug use, 
and transmission of maternal infection perinatally or in early childhood. While 
life expectancy among people living with HIV has been extended with effective 
antiretroviral therapy (ART), HBV-induced liver injury and complications have 
emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in people living with HIV.
OBJECTIVES: This article describes the prevalence of co-infection, current 
clinical practice, and recommendations for the management of people living with 
HIV-HBV co-infection in Asia.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Screening for HBV should occur at the time of HIV 
diagnosis; however, HBV screening rates in people living with HIV in Asia vary 
widely by region. Similarly, people with HBV should be screened for HIV before 
initiation of HBV antiviral therapy. People with HIV-HBV co-infection should be 
assessed for liver damage and risk factors for liver disease and be monitored 
regularly for liver complications and HBV DNA. Medical treatment with ART is 
lifelong and includes tenofovir and lamivudine or emtricitabine, unless 
intolerant or contraindicated, as these are active against both HIV and HBV. HBV 
vaccination programmes are effective in reducing co-infection rates. 
Mother-to-child transmission can be prevented through measures such as 
vaccination, antenatal screening, and treatment of pregnant women who are 
infected.

BACKGROUND: Food systems instantiate the complex interdependencies across 
humans, physical environments, and other organisms. Applying One Health 
approaches for agri-food system transformation, which adopts integrated and 
unifying approaches to optimize the overall health of humans, animals, plants, 
and environments, is crucial to enhance the sustainability of food systems. This 
study develops a potential assessment tool, named the global One Health 
index-Food Security (GOHI-FS), aiming to evaluate food security performance 
across countries/territories from One Health perspective and identify relevant 
gaps that need to be improved for sustainable food systems.
METHODS: We comprehensively reviewed existing frameworks and elements of food 
security. The indicator framework of GOHI-FS was conceptualized following the 
structure-process-outcome model and confirmed by expert advisory. Publicly 
available data in 2020 was collected for each indicator. The weighting strategy 
was determined by the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process. The data for each 
indicator was normalized and aggregated by weighted arithmetic mean. Linear 
regressions were performed to evaluate the associations of GOHI-FS with health 
and social-economic indicators.
RESULTS: The GOHI-FS includes 5 first-level indicators, 19 second-level 
indicators and 45 third-level indicators. There were 146 countries/territories 
enrolled for evaluation. The highest average score of first-level indicators was 
Nutrition (69.8) and the lowest was Government Support and Response (31.3). 
There was regional heterogeneity of GOHI-FS scores. Higher median scores with 
interquartile range (IQR) were shown in North America (median: 76.1, IQR: 
75.5-76.7), followed by Europe and Central Asia (median: 66.9, IQR: 60.1-74.3), 
East Asia and the Pacific (median: 60.6, IQR: 55.5-68.7), Latin America and the 
Caribbean (median: 60.2, IQR: 57.8-65.0), Middle East and North Africa (median: 
56.6, IQR: 52.0-62.8), South Asia (median: 51.1, IQR: 46.7-53.8), and 
sub-Saharan Africa (median: 41.4, IQR: 37.2-46.5). We also found significant 
associations between GOHI-FS and GDP per capita, socio-demographic index, health 
expenditure and life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: GOHI-FS is a potential assessment tool to understand the gaps in 
food security across countries/territories under the One Health concept. The 
pilot findings suggest notable gaps for sub-Saharan Africa in numerous aspects. 
Broad actions are needed globally to promote government support and response for 
food security.

Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus sensu stricto mosquitoes are major 
East African malaria vectors. Understanding their dispersal and population 
structure is critical for developing effective malaria control tools. Three 
mark-release-recapture (MRR) experiments were conducted for 51 nights to assess 
daily survival and flight range of An. arabiensis and An. funestus mosquitoes in 
south-eastern, Tanzania. Mosquitoes were marked with a fluorescent dye as they 
emerged from breeding sites via a self-marking device. Mosquitoes were collected 
indoors and outdoors using human landing catches (HLC) and Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention light traps (CDC-LT). In total, 4210 An. arabiensis and 
An. funestus were collected with 316 (7.5%) marked and recaptured (MR). Daily 
mean MR was 6.8, standard deviation (SD ± 7.6) for An. arabiensis and 8.9 
(SD ± 8.3) for An. funestus. Probability of daily survival was 0.76 for An. 
arabiensis and 0.86 for An. funestus translating into average life expectancy of 
3.6 days for An. arabiensis and 6.5 days for An. funestus. Dispersal distance 
was 654 m for An. arabiensis and 510 m for An. funestus. An. funestus life 
expectancy was substantially longer than that of An. arabiensis. The MRR method 
described here could be routinely utilized when evaluating the impact of new 
vector control tools on mosquito survival.

The spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula (White, 1845), is an invasive species 
in the United States. This pest causes damage to vineyards and has the potential 
to negatively affect other crops and industries. Information describing the 
seasonal timing of life stages can improve its management. In 2019 and 2020, 
spotted lanternfly seasonal activity was followed weekly from spring egg hatch 
to the first hard freeze. Weighted mean timing of activity for each nymphal 
instar, early adults, late adults, total adults, and egg mass deposition are 
presented for 2019 and 2020 on Acer rubrum and 2020 on Ailanthus altissima. 
Logistic equations describing the percentage completion of each activity period 
on these hosts were fitted using a start date of 1 January to calculate 
accumulated degree days (ADD). For the adult and egg mass deposition periods, we 
additionally used a biofix of the date adults were first observed to calculate 
ADD. ADD from 1 January adequately estimated the timing of nymphal instars but 
ADD from observation of the first adult better estimated the timing of adult 
activity and egg mass deposition. Late adult activity and egg mass deposition 
periods appeared to be influenced by another environmental cue, such as day 
length. Maps of season-long ADD show that spotted lanternflies are unlikely to 
reach adulthood in colder regions of the northeast United States, and therefore 
may not establish there. We also report a strong seasonal trend in sex ratio on 
A. rubrum, where the population shifted from over 80% male to over 80% female in 
October.

Increased life expectancy means that women are now in a hypoestrogenic state for 
approximately one-third of their lives. Overall health and specifically bone 
health during this period evolves in accordance with aging and successive 
exposure to various risk factors. In this review, we provide a summary of the 
approaches to the sequential management of osteoporosis within an integrative 
model of care to offer physicians a useful tool to facilitate therapeutic 
decision-making. Current evidence suggests that pharmacologic agents should be 
selected based on the risk of fractures, which does not always correlate with 
age. Due to their effect on bone turnover and on other hormone-regulated 
phenomena, such as hot flushes or breast cancer risk, we position hormone 
therapy and selective estrogen receptor modulators as an early postmenopause 
intervention for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. When the use of 
these agents is not possible, compelling evidence supports antiresorptive agents 
as first-line treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in many clinical 
scenarios, with digestive conditions, kidney function, readiness for compliance, 
or patient preferences playing a role in choosing between bisphosphonates or 
denosumab during this period. For patients at high risk of osteoporotic 
fracture, the "anabolic first" approach reduces that risk. The effect on bone 
health with these bone-forming agents or with denosumab should be consolidated 
with the subsequent use of antiresorptive agents. Regardless of the strategy, 
follow-up and treatment should be maintained indefinitely to help prevent 
fractures.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed concerns around life span and aging, but these 
tensions and anxieties around longevity are not new. Physicians, scientists, and 
philosophers have been meditating on the idea and consequences of life extension 
for many centuries. In this short article, we put into conversation some of the 
ways that people have understood longevity from the early modern period to the 
present. We trace the history of texts like Alvise Cornaro's Treatise on the 
Sober Life through present-day dieting manuals, consider accounts of extreme old 
age from Old Man Parr in the sixteenth century to Jeanne Calment in the 
twentieth, and reflect on the role of caretakers for older adults, from Gabriele 
Zerbi's fifteenth-century gerontocomos to graphic novel representations of aging 
parents in the present. Our goal is to represent the history of human longevity 
and aging as integrated, dynamic processes, helping us better explain and 
address the present treatment of elders and how to improve their care in the 
future.

AIMS: Ferroptosis has grown in importance as a key factor in 
ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study explores the mechanism underlying 
fibrotic scarring extending along myofibers in cardiac ischemic injury and 
demonstrates the integral role of ferroptosis in causing a unique cell death 
pattern linked to I/R injury.
MAIN METHODS: Cadaveric hearts from individuals who had ischemic injury were 
examined by histological assays. We created a novel model of inducing cell death 
in H9c2 cells, and used it to demonstrate ferroptotic cell death extending in a 
cell-to-cell manner. Ex vivo Langendorff-perfused hearts were used alongside the 
model to replicate cell death extension along myofibers while also demonstrating 
protective effects of a ferroptosis inhibitor, ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1).
KEY FINDINGS: Human hearts from individuals who had I/R injury demonstrated 
scarring along myofibers that was consistent with mouse models, suggesting that 
cell death extended from cell-to-cell. Treatment with Ras-selective lethal 3 
(RSL3), a ferroptosis inducer, and exposure to excess iron exacerbated cell 
death propagation in in vitro models, and inhibition of ferroptosis by Fer-1 
blunted this effect in both settings. In ex vivo models, Fer-1 was sufficient to 
reduce cell death along the myofibers caused by external injury.
SIGNIFICANCE: The unique I/R injury-induced pattern of cell death along 
myofibers requires novel injury models that mimic this phenomenon, thus we 
established new methods to replicate it. Ferroptosis is important in propagating 
injury between cells and better understanding this mechanism may lead to 
therapeutic responses that limit I/R injury.

The twofold life expectancy difference between dog breeds predicts differential 
behavioral and cognitive aging patterns between short- and long-lived dogs. To 
investigate this prediction, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis using 
survey data from over 15,000 dogs. We examined the effect of expected lifespan 
and three related factors (body size, head shape, and purebred status) on the 
age trajectory of various behavioral characteristics and the prevalence of 
canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD). Our findings reveal that, although 
age-related decline in most behavioral characteristics began around 10.5 years 
of age, the proportion of dogs considered "old" by their owners began to 
increase uniformly around 6 years of age. From the investigated factors, only 
body size had a systematic, although not gradual, impact on the aging 
trajectories of all behavioral characteristics. Dogs weighing over 30 kg 
exhibited an earlier onset of decline by 2-3 years and a slower rate of decline 
compared to smaller dogs, probably as a byproduct of their faster age-related 
physical decline. Larger sized dogs also showed a lower prevalence of CCD risk 
in their oldest age group, whereas smaller-sized dogs, dolichocephalic breeds, 
and purebreds had a higher CCD risk prevalence. The identification of 
differential behavioral and cognitive aging trajectories across dog groups, and 
the observed associations between body size and the onset, rate, and degree of 
cognitive decline in dogs have significant translational implications for human 
aging research, providing valuable insights into the interplay between 
morphology, physiological ageing, and cognitive decline, and unravelling the 
trade-off between longevity and relative healthspan.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the knowledge, self-efficacy, and 
attitudes toward suicide prevention among nurses with different demographic 
characteristics.
METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive design was adopted, and the study was 
conducted between August and September 2020. The content of the questionnaire 
included basic demographics, knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitudes toward 
suicide prevention. Correlation analysis was performed to determine nurses' 
knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitudes toward suicide prevention.
RESULTS: The sample comprised 778 nursing staff from a medical center in 
southern Taiwan. The results showed that age, years of nursing experience, 
department type, education on suicide prevention, and care experience of nursing 
staff were associated with their knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitudes toward 
suicide prevention in general hospital patients. Younger and less experienced 
nurses demonstrated superior knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitudes toward 
suicide prevention. Nurses who received suicide-related education and training 
exhibited better self-efficacy and attitudes than those who did not. Nurses with 
care experience had better knowledge of suicide prevention than those without 
experience. Knowledge and self-efficacy in suicide prevention were both 
significantly and positively correlated with attitudes.
CONCLUSION: Younger, less experienced, psychiatric nurses demonstrated superior 
knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitudes toward suicide prevention. Therefore, 
education on suicide prevention should be strengthened for older, experienced, 
and non-psychiatric nurses.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome, a significant risk factor for cardiovascular 
mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease, profoundly impacts patient 
prognosis and survival. Despite its clinical importance, the prevalence of 
metabolic syndrome remains unexplored in this population. Therefore, the 
objective of this study was to systematically assess the prevalence of metabolic 
syndrome among patients with end-stage renal disease and raise awareness among 
healthcare professionals.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in CNKI, WANFANG, WeiPu, CBM, 
PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library databases. The search 
time was until August 21, 2023. Standardized tables were employed for data 
extraction and imported into Stata 16.0 software for subsequent meta-analysis. A 
random-effects model was employed to estimate combined prevalence and 95% 
confidence intervals. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
explore potential sources of heterogeneity, while publication bias was evaluated 
using a funnel plot and Egger's test. This study has been registered with 
PROSPERO under the registration number CRD42023456284.
RESULTS: This meta-analysis comprised 35 studies involving a total of 14,202 
participants. The pooled prevalence estimate for metabolic syndrome was 49.0% 
[95% CI (46.0,53.0)]. We conducted subgroup analyses based on participant 
characteristics, gender distribution, publication year, national economic 
status, diagnostic criteria employed, and components of metabolic syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is higher among patients with 
end-stage renal disease, necessitating early prevention and control measures to 
reduce its incidence and delay the progression of the disease, thereby improving 
patient life expectancy.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by airflow 
obstruction on spirometry and symptoms such as dyspnea on exertion and chronic 
cough with sputum production, thus making it a significant healthcare issue 
worldwide. Japanese patients with COPD have unique characteristics compared to 
patients in Western countries, including older age and lower exacerbation 
frequency. The Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) published the 6th edition of 
the COPD guideline in June 2022. This article introduces the management goals of 
COPD and describes its management during the stable phase, as outlined in the 
guideline. Management goals include improving the current status, such as the 
symptoms, quality of life (QOL), exercise tolerance, and physical activity, and 
reducing future risks through prevention of exacerbation and suppression of 
disease progression to prevent shortening of healthy life expectancy. Management 
plans should include avoidance of causative substances, assessment of disease 
severity, and personalized treatment plans. Pharmacotherapy using inhalation 
bronchodilators is a key component of the treatment of stable COPD. 
Bronchodilators, including short- and long-acting dilators, are commonly used to 
relieve symptoms and improve QOL. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are used in 
combination with long-acting bronchodilators, especially in patients with asthma 
and COPD overlap, or those experiencing frequent exacerbation of eosinophilia. 
Combination therapy with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), a 
long-acting beta 2 agonist (LABA), and ICS is expected to improve QOL and 
respiratory function and reduce mortality and exacerbation compared to the 
LAMA + LABA combination. Non-pharmacological therapies, including smoking 
cessation and pulmonary rehabilitation, should also be considered.

OBJECTIVES: Randomized controlled trials of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for 
treating atrial fibrillation (AF) have proven the procedure's efficacy. Studies 
assessing its empirical cost-effectiveness outside randomized trial settings are 
lacking. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PVI 
versus medical therapy for AF.
METHODS: We followed a target trial approach using the Swiss-AF cohort, a 
prospective observational cohort study that enrolled patients with AF between 
2014 and 2017. Resource utilization and cost information were collected through 
claims data. Quality of life was measured with EQ-5D-3L utilities. We estimated 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from the perspective of the Swiss 
statutory health insurance system.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing PVI compared with medical therapy had a 5-year 
overall survival advantage with a hazard ratio of 0.75 (95% CI 0.46-1.21; P = 
.69) and a 19.8% SD improvement in quality of life (95% CI 15.5-22.9; P < .001), 
at an incremental cost of 29 604 Swiss francs (CHF) (95% CI 16 354-42 855; P < 
.001). The estimated ICER was CHF 158 612 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gained within a 5-year time horizon. Assuming similar health effects and costs 
over 5 additional years changed the ICER to CHF 82 195 per QALY gained. Results 
were robust to the sensitivity analyses performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that PVI might be a cost-effective intervention 
within the Swiss healthcare context in a 10-year time horizon, but unlikely to 
be so at 5 years, if a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF 100 000 per QALY 
gained is assumed. Given data availability, we find target trial designs are a 
valuable tool for assessing the cost-effectiveness of healthcare interventions 
outside of randomized controlled trial settings.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to quantify the preferences of patients with 
advanced cancer for quality of life (QoL) outcomes versus survival extension in 
Malaysia. The secondary aim of this study is to explore the change in 
preferences over time.
METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was developed to include 7 attributes 
valued in cancer management: physical, psychological and social functioning, 
pain control, survival, place of death, and cost. Patients were recruited via 
convenience sampling from 2 Malaysian public hospitals. The survey questionnaire 
was administered to patients within 6 months of their cancer diagnosis with a 
follow-up 3 months later. Conditional logit regression was used to estimate the 
preference weight, relative attribute importance, and willingness to pay.
RESULTS: One hundred valid responses were collected at baseline and 45 at 
follow-up. Respondents placed higher values on QoL improvements from severe to 
moderate or mild levels and to achieve home death over survival extension from 6 
to 18 months. However, additional improvements (from moderate to mild) in some 
of the QoL outcomes were not valued as highly as life extension from 12 to 18 
months, showing that it was vital for patients to avoid being in "severe" health 
dysfunction. Improving physical dysfunction from severe to mild yielded 3 times 
as much value as additional 1-year survival. After 3 months, the respondents' 
preferences changed significantly, with increased relative attribute importance 
of physical functioning, pain control, and cost.
CONCLUSIONS: As QoL outcomes are valued more than survival, palliative care 
should be introduced as early as possible to alleviate suffering related to 
advanced cancer.

OBJECTIVES: To perform a distributional cost-effectiveness analysis of liquid 
biopsy (LB) followed by, if needed, tissue biopsy (TB) (LB-first strategy) 
relative to a TB-only strategy to inform first-line treatment of advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) from a US payer perspective by which we 
quantify the impact of LB-first on population health inequality according to 
race and ethnicity.
METHODS: With a health economic model, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 
costs per patient were estimated for each subgroup. Given the lifetime risk of 
aNSCLC, and assuming equally distributed opportunity costs, the incremental net 
health benefits of LB-first were calculated, which were used to estimate general 
population quality-adjusted life expectancy at birth (QALE) by race and 
ethnicity with and without LB-first. The degree of QALYs and QALE differences 
with the strategies was expressed with inequality indices. Their differences 
were defined as the inequality impact of LB-first.
RESULTS: LB-first resulted in an additional 0.21 (95% uncertainty interval: 
0.07-0.39) QALYs among treated patients, with the greatest gain observed among 
Asian patients (0.31 QALYs [0.09-0.61]). LB-first resulted in an increase in 
relative inequality in QALYs among patients, but a minor decrease in relative 
inequality in QALE.
CONCLUSIONS: LB-first to inform first-line aNSCLC therapy can improve health 
outcomes. With current diagnostic performance, the benefit is the greatest among 
Asian patients, thereby potentially widening racial and ethnic differences in 
survival among patients with aNSCLC. Assuming equally distributed opportunity 
costs and access, LB-first does not worsen and, in fact, may reduce inequality 
in general population health according to race and ethnicity.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease with a dismal prognosis, mainly 
affecting the elderly. In recent years, new drugs have improved life expectancy 
and quality of life, and a better understanding of the genetic-molecular nature 
of the disease has shed light on previously unknown aspects of leukemogenesis. 
In parallel, increasing attention has been attracted to the complex interactions 
between cells and soluble factors in the bone marrow (BM) environment, 
collectively known as the microenvironment. In this review, we discuss the 
central role of the microenvironment in physiologic and pathologic hematopoiesis 
and the mechanisms of senescence, considered a fundamental protective mechanism 
against the proliferation of damaged and pretumoral cells. The microenvironment 
also represents a fertile ground for the development of myeloid malignancies, 
and the leukemic niche significantly interacts with drugs commonly used in AML 
treatment. Finally, we focus on the role of the microenvironment in the 
engraftment and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation, the only curative option in a conspicuous proportion of 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of weekly somatrogon compared to 
daily growth hormones (GH-d) in the pediatric population of Spain with growth 
hormone deficiency (GHD).
METHODS: Markov model with two states (patients with or without GH-d or 
somatrogon treatment) in prepubertal children (3 to 11 years and 3 to 12 years 
in girls and boys, respectively) with GHD in isolation or as part of multiple 
pituitary hormone deficiency and without previous treatment, from the 
perspective of the National Health System. The simulation of the economic model 
ends at the age of 18. The costs of hormones and monitoring were obtained from 
Spanish sources. The utilities were obtained from the literature. Spanish 
clinical experts validated the assumptions of the model.
RESULTS: In the deterministic analysis, somatrogon would be cost-effective, 
compared to GH-d, with a cost per QALY (quality-adjusted life year) gained of 
€19,259 and a clinically relevant QALY gain (0.336). This result was confirmed 
in deterministic sensitivity analyses. According to the probabilistic analysis, 
somatrogon would be the dominant treatment, with a 61% probability of a 
willingness to pay of €25,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Compared to GH-d, somatrogon is cost-effective in the Spanish 
pediatric population with GHD.

The health of the population is the highest value, therefore, an effectively 
functioning system of protecting the health of citizens is the most important 
priority of regional socio-demographic policy and national security. The purpose 
of the study is to consider the most important priority of socio-demographic 
policy - capital management of public health in the regions of the Russian 
Federation. The relevance of the research topic is due to the fact that 
currently the conditions of the domestic health care system are extremely 
complex. Health capital management is a key socio-demographic task on a global 
scale, which ensures well-being both from the perspective of current 
socio-economic development, which is measured by the efficiency of the use of 
human capital, and from the point of view of the long-term effect of improving 
people's lives.
