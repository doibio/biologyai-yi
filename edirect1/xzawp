The Intermountain Risk Score (IMRS) encapsulates the mortality risk information 
from all components of the complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic 
profile (BMP), along with age. To individualize the IMRS more clearly, this 
study evaluated whether IMRS weightings for 1-year mortality predict 
age-specific survival over more than a decade of follow-up. Sex-specific 1-year 
IMRS values were calculated for general medical patients with CBC and BMP 
laboratory tests drawn during 1999-2005. The population was divided randomly 60% 
(N = 71,921, examination sample) and 40% (N = 47,458, validation sample). 
Age-specific risk thresholds were established, and both survival and life 
expectancy were compared across low-, moderate-, and high-risk IMRS categories. 
During 7.3 ± 1.8 years of follow-up (range, 4.5-11.1 years), the average IMRS of 
decedents was higher than censored in all age/sex strata (all P < 0.001). For 
examination and validation samples, every age stratum had incrementally lower 
survival for higher risk IMRS, with hazard ratios of 2.5-8.5 (P < 0.001). Life 
expectancies were also significantly shorter for higher risk IMRS (all P < 
0.001): For example, among 50-59 year-olds, life expectancy was 7.5, 6.8, and 
5.9 years for women with low-, moderate-, and high-risk IMRS (with mortality in 
5.7%, 16.3%, and 37.0% of patients, respectively). In Men, life expectancy was 
7.3, 6.8, and 5.4 for low-, moderate-, and high-risk IMRS (with patients having 
7.3%, 19.5%, and 40.0% mortality), respectively. IMRS significantly stratified 
survival and life expectancy within age-defined subgroups during more than a 
decade of follow-up. IMRS may be used to stratify age-specific risk of mortality 
in research, clinical/preventive, and quality improvement applications. A web 
calculator is located at http://intermountainhealthcare.org/IMRS.

Park, NC 27709, USA. tjh@rti.org

INTRODUCTION: By improving lipid standardization, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Lipid Standardization Program and Cholesterol 
Reference Method Laboratory Network have contributed to the marked reduction in 
heart disease deaths since 1980. The objective of this study was to estimate the 
benefits (ie, the value of reductions in heart disease deaths) and costs 
attributable to these lipid standardization programs.
METHODS: We developed a logic model that shows how the inputs and activities of 
the lipid standardization programs produce short- and medium-term outcomes that 
in turn lead to improvements in rates of cardiovascular disease and death. To 
calculate improvements in long-term outcomes, we applied previous estimates of 
the change in heart disease deaths between 1980 and 2000 that was attributable 
to statin treatment and to the reduction in total cholesterol during the period. 
Experts estimated the share of cholesterol reduction that could be attributed to 
lipid standardization. We applied alternative assumptions about the value of a 
life-year saved to estimate the value of life-years saved attributable to the 
programs.
RESULTS: Assuming that 5% of the cholesterol-related benefits were attributable 
to the programs and a $113,000 value per life-year, the annual benefit 
attributable to the programs was $7.6 billion. With more conservative 
assumptions (0.5% of cholesterol-related benefits attributable to the programs 
and a $50,000 value per life-year), the benefit attributable to the programs was 
$338 million. In 2007, the CDC lipid standardization programs cost $1.7 million.
CONCLUSION: Our estimates suggest that the benefits of CDC's lipid 
standardization programs greatly exceed their costs.

University, Bundoora, VIC 3086, Australia. p.levinger@latrobe.edu.au

PURPOSE: Knee pain and disability can persist following knee replacement surgery 
which may place patients at increased risk of falls. This study investigated the 
falls risk and the occurrence of falls of people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) 
before and at 12 months following knee replacement surgery.
METHOD: Thirty-five patients with knee OA were tested prior to undergoing knee 
replacement surgery and at 12 months following surgery using the short form 
Physiological Profile Assessment, which incorporates tests of vision, lower limb 
proprioception, knee extension strength, reaction time and postural sway. 
Physical activity, number of falls, fear of falling, pain, disability and 
health-related quality of life were also assessed.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the number of falls pre- 
and post-surgery (n.s.), with 48.5 and 40% reporting at least one fall in the 12 
months before and following the surgery, respectively. Improvements in knee 
strength, reaction time and fear of falling were evident following surgery, with 
no improvement in lower limb proprioception. Self-reported pain, function and 
stiffness were significantly improved, but health-related quality of life 
deteriorated following the surgery.
CONCLUSION: The number of falls experienced following knee replacement surgery 
remained relatively high, which may be attributed to the persistence of impaired 
lower limb proprioception. Although knee replacement surgery improves function 
and alleviates pain, people who undergo this procedure may need to engage in 
rehabilitation following the surgery to reduce the risk of falling.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic study investigating the result of treatment on 
patient outcomes, Level IV.

responses.

Plant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play a pivotal role in a 
range of biotic and abiotic stress responses. In this study, we isolated a novel 
group D MAPK gene, ZmMPK17, from maize (Zea mays L.). ZmMPK17 is localized 
mainly to the nucleus and its C-terminal domain extension is believed to be 
essential for this. Northern-blot analysis indicated that ZmMPK17 transcription 
is involved in response to exogenous signaling molecules such as abscisic acid, 
hydrogen peroxide, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene and induced by low 
temperature and osmotic stress. Hydrogen peroxide and Ca²⁺ mediate PEG-induced 
downregulation of ZmMPK17 at transcription level and Ca²⁺ also mediates low 
temperature-induced expression of ZmMPK17. Overexpression of ZmMPK17 in tobacco 
(Nicotonia tobaccum) accumulated less reactive oxygen species under osmotic 
stress by affecting antioxidant defense systems. Transgenic tobacco exhibited 
enhanced tolerance to cold by means of an increased germination rate, and 
increased proline and soluble sugar levels relative to control plants. The 
transcription levels of NtERD10 genes were higher in ZmMPK17-overexpressing 
lines than in control plants under cold and osmotic stress conditions. 
ZmMPK17-overexpressing plants displayed enhanced resistance to viral pathogens, 
and the expression of the pathogenesis-related gene PR1a was significantly 
increased, indicating that ZmMPK17 might be involved in SA-mediated pathogen 
defense-signaling pathways.

OBJECTIVE: To review the present status of lung transplant (LTx) in patients 
with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
DATA SOURCES: Current English-language literature review using MEDLINE.
STUDY SELECTION: Prospective and retrospective trials, series, reviews, 
databases, and editorials regarding the clinical and basic science aspects of 
LTx in patients with IPF.
DATA EXTRACTION: We analyzed results from trials and series.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an incurable disease with a 
dismal prognosis. The only treatment of proven benefit is LTx. Since the 
introduction of the Lung Allocation Score, IPF has become the most common 
indication for LTx in the United States. These patients have a limited life 
expectancy and benefit from early referral for transplant. Although 
controversial, the most recent data suggest that bilateral LTx is superior to 
single LTx in the population of patients with IPF. For this population, LTx 
increases the length and quality of their lives.
CONCLUSION: Although patients with IPF have a dismal prognosis, LTx is a safe 
and effective treatment to improve their survival and functional status.

What is known about the health and living conditions of the indigenous people of 
northern Scandinavia, the Sami?

per.sjolander@vilhelmina.se

BACKGROUND: The Sami are the indigenous ethnic population of northern 
Scandinavia. Their health condition is poorly known, although the knowledge has 
improved over the last decade.
OBJECTIVES: The aim was to review the current information on mortality, 
diseases, and risk factor exposure in the Swedish Sami population.
DESIGN: Health-related research on Sami cohorts published in scientific journals 
and anthologies was used to compare the health condition among the Sami and the 
majority non-Sami population. When relevant, data from the Sami populations in 
Swedish were compared with corresponding data from Norwegian and Finnish Sami 
populations.
RESULTS: Life expectancy and mortality patterns of the Sami are similar to those 
of the majority population. Small differences in incidences of cancer and 
cardiovascular diseases have been reported. The traditional Sami lifestyle seems 
to contain elements that reduce the risk to develop cancer and cardiovascular 
diseases, e.g. physical activity, diet rich in antioxidants and unsaturated 
fatty acids, and a strong cultural identity. Reindeer herding is an important 
cultural activity among the Sami and is associated with high risks for 
accidents. Pain in the lower back, neck, shoulders, elbows, and hands are 
frequent among both men and women in reindeer-herding families. For men, these 
symptoms are related to high exposure to terrain vehicles, particularly 
snowmobile, whereas for women psychosocial risk factors seem to more important, 
e.g. poor social support, high effort, low reward, and high economical 
responsibilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the health condition of the Sami population appears to be 
rather similar to that of the general Swedish population, a number of specific 
health problems have been identified, especially among the reindeer-herding 
Sami. Most of these problems have their origin in marginalization and poor 
knowledge of the reindeer husbandry and the Sami culture in the majority 
population. It is suggested that the most sustainable measure to improve the 
health among the reindeer-herding Sami would be to improve the conditions of the 
reindeer husbandry and the Sami culture.

Newer drugs and earlier treatment: impact on lifetime cost of care for 
HIV-infected adults.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the component costs of care to optimize treatment with 
limited resources.
DESIGN: We used the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications Model of 
HIV disease and treatment to project life expectancy and both undiscounted and 
discounted lifetime costs (2010 €).
METHODS: We determined medical resource utilization among HIV-infected adults 
followed from 1998 to 2005 in northern France. Monthly HIV costs were stratified 
by CD4 cell count. Costs of CD4, HIV RNA and genotype tests and antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) were derived from published literature. Model inputs from national 
data included mean age 38 years, mean initial CD4 cell count 372 cells/μl, ART 
initiation at CD4 cell counts less than 350 cells/μl, and ART regimen costs 
ranging from €760 to 2570 per month.
RESULTS: The model projected a mean undiscounted life expectancy of 26.5 years 
and a lifetime undiscounted cost of €535,000/patient (€320,700 discounted); 73% 
of costs were ART related. When patients presented to care with mean CD4 cell 
counts of 510 cells/μl and initiated ART at CD4 cell counts less than 500 
cells/μl or HIV RNA more than 100,000 copies/ml, life expectancy was 27.4 years 
and costs increased 1-2%, to €546,700 (€324,500 discounted). When we assumed 
introducing generic drugs would result in a 50% decline in first-line ART costs, 
lifetime costs decreased 4-6%, to €514,200 (€302 ,800 discounted).
CONCLUSION: As HIV disease is treated earlier with more efficacious drugs, 
survival and thus costs of care will continue to increase. The availability in 
high-income countries of widely used antiretroviral drugs in generic form could 
reduce these costs.

The randomization design used to collect the data provides basis for the exact 
distributions of the permutation tests. The truncated binomial design is one of 
the commonly used designs for forcing balance in clinical trials to eliminate 
experimental bias. In this article, we consider the exact distribution of the 
weighted log-rank class of tests for censored data under the truncated binomial 
design. A double saddlepoint approximation for p-values of this class is derived 
under the truncated binomial design. The speed and accuracy of the saddlepoint 
approximation over the normal asymptotic facilitate the inversion of the 
weighted log-rank tests to determine nominal 95% confidence intervals for 
treatment effect with right censored data.

Seattle, WA (AB)

PURPOSE: To develop regression models for outcomes with truncated supports, such 
as health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data, and account for features typical 
of such data such as a skewed distribution, spikes at 1 or 0, and 
heteroskedasticity.
METHODS: Regression estimators based on features of the Beta distribution. 
First, both a single equation and a 2-part model are presented, along with 
estimation algorithms based on maximum-likelihood, quasi-likelihood, and 
Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods. A novel Bayesian quasi-likelihood 
estimator is proposed. Second, a simulation exercise is presented to assess the 
performance of the proposed estimators against ordinary least squares (OLS) 
regression for a variety of HRQoL distributions that are encountered in 
practice. Finally, the performance of the proposed estimators is assessed by 
using them to quantify the treatment effect on QALYs in the EVALUATE 
hysterectomy trial. Overall model fit is studied using several goodness-of-fit 
tests such as Pearson's correlation test, link and reset tests, and a modified 
Hosmer-Lemeshow test.
RESULTS: The simulation results indicate that the proposed methods are more 
robust in estimating covariate effects than OLS, especially when the effects are 
large or the HRQoL distribution has a large spike at 1. Quasi-likelihood 
techniques are more robust than maximum likelihood estimators. When applied to 
the EVALUATE trial, all but the maximum likelihood estimators produce unbiased 
estimates of the treatment effect.
CONCLUSION: One and 2-part Beta regression models provide flexible approaches to 
regress the outcomes with truncated supports, such as HRQoL, on covariates, 
after accounting for many idiosyncratic features of the outcomes distribution. 
This work will provide applied researchers with a practical set of tools to 
model outcomes in cost-effectiveness analysis.

Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Guildford, UK. m.hussein@nhs.net

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 6 and 15-MV 
photon energies on intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) prostate cancer 
treatment plan outcome and to compare the theoretical risks of secondary induced 
malignancies.
METHODS: Separate prostate cancer IMRT plans were prepared for 6 and 15-MV 
beams. Organ-equivalent doses were obtained through thermoluminescent dosemeter 
measurements in an anthropomorphic Aldersen radiation therapy human phantom. The 
neutron dose contribution at 15 MV was measured using 
polyallyl-diglycol-carbonate neutron track etch detectors. Risk coefficients 
from the International Commission on Radiological Protection Report 103 were 
used to compare the risk of fatal secondary induced malignancies in out-of-field 
organs and tissues for 6 and 15 MV. For the bladder and the rectum, a 
comparative evaluation of the risk using three separate models was carried out. 
Dose-volume parameters for the rectum, bladder and prostate planning target 
volume were evaluated, as well as normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) 
and tumour control probability calculations.
RESULTS: There is a small increased theoretical risk of developing a fatal 
cancer from 6 MV compared with 15 MV, taking into account all the organs. 
Dose-volume parameters for the rectum and bladder show that 15 MV results in 
better volume sparing in the regions below 70 Gy, but the volume exposed 
increases slightly beyond this in comparison with 6 MV, resulting in a higher 
NTCP for the rectum of 3.6% vs 3.0% (p=0.166).
CONCLUSION: The choice to treat using IMRT at 15 MV should not be excluded, but 
should be based on risk vs benefit while considering the age and life expectancy 
of the patient together with the relative risk of radiation-induced cancer and 
NTCPs.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Acute stroke units in hospitals are known to be more costly 
than standard care, but proponents claim that the health gains will justify the 
expense. Yet, despite widespread adoption of stroke units, the evidence on the 
cost effectiveness of stroke units has been mixed, due in part to differences in 
the pathway of care across hospitals. The purpose of this study is to compare 
costs and outcomes for patients admitted to a stroke unit with those admitted to 
a general ward.
METHODS: Data on 530 stroke sufferers from a large incidence study of stroke 
(the Auckland Regional Community Stroke Outcome Study) were used. Cost of health 
services, places of discharge were identified at one-, six- and 12 months 
poststroke and were linked with long-term cost and survival five-years 
poststroke. A decision analytical model was developed, including the 
relationship between waiting time for discharge and probability of admission to 
stroke unit. Cost effectiveness was determined using a willingness to pay 
threshold of NZ$20 000 (US$15 234).
RESULTS: Regression analysis suggested that there were no significant 
differences between patients admitted to a stroke unit and a general ward. The 
incremental cost-utility ratio for the first-year was NZ$42 813/quality-adjusted 
life year (US$32 610/quality-adjusted life year), but fell substantially to 
NZ$6747/quality-adjusted life year (US$5139/quality-adjusted life year) when 
lifetime costs and outcomes were considered. Probabilistic and one-way 
sensitivity analysis suggests that the results are robust to areas of 
uncertainty or delays in the pathway of care.
CONCLUSION: Stroke unit care was cost effective in Auckland, New Zealand.

BACKGROUND: A high percentage of cervical cancer cases have not undergone 
cytological tests within 10 years prior to diagnosis. Different population 
interventions could improve coverage in the public system, although costs will 
also increase. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and the 
costs of three types of population interventions to increase the number of 
female participants in the screening programmes for cancer of the cervix carried 
out by Primary Care in four basic health care areas.
METHODS/DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from the 
perspective of public health system including women from 30 to 70 years of age 
(n = 20,994) with incorrect screening criteria from four basic health care areas 
in the Valles Occidental, Barcelona, Spain. The patients will be randomly 
distributed into the control group and the three intervention groups (IG1: 
invitation letter to participate in the screening; IG2: invitation letter and 
informative leaflet; IG3: invitation letter, informative leaflet and a phone 
call reminder) and followed for three years. Clinical effectiveness will be 
measured by the number of HPV, epithelial lesions and cancer of cervix cases 
detected. The number of deaths avoided will be secondary measures of 
effectiveness. The temporal horizon of the analysis will be the life expectancy 
of the female population in the study. Costs and effectiveness will be 
discounted at 3%. In addition, univariate and multivariate sensitivity analysis 
will be carried out.
DISCUSSION: IG3 is expected to be more cost-effective intervention than IG1 and 
IG2, with greater detection of HPV infections, epithelial lesions and cancer 
than other strategies, albeit at a greater cost.

Heart failure is a chronic and progressive disease that is estimated to affect 
approximately 20 million people worldwide and is one of the major public health 
problems. Its prevalence is reaching epidemic levels with about 550,000 new 
cases diagnosed annually, partly due to increased life expectancy in developed 
countries. And as it is a systemic disease, it can cause dysfunction in various 
organs, but especially in the kidney. The renal failure is often associated with 
heart failure and, when present together, make the treatment more complex and 
the prognosis is worse. This is the cardio-renal syndrome. The definition of 
cardio-renal syndrome varies according to the working groups, and there isn't a 
consensus. The exact cause of deterioration of renal function and the mechanism 
behind this interaction are complex, multifactorial in nature and not fully 
known at present. The treatment available is the one used for the treatment of 
heart failure. It is necessary to maintain the normal function of filtration, 
secretion and reabsorption in kidney to have a real improvement of the clinical 
condition of the patient. Patients with higher risk of developing nephropathy 
and those who have diagnosed renal failure should have prescribed drugs that are 
handled very carefully. But as in many other clinical situations, there aren't 
perfect drugs available to treat cardio-renal syndrome and the existing ones may 
have serious side effects in medium/long term causing the deterioration of renal 
function and possibly an increased mortality. The treatment is truly challenging 
in patients with severe fluid overload that is refractory to diuretics. This 
article aims to present the existing definitions of cardio-renal syndrome, its 
epidemiology, describe the current knowledge about the pathophysiology and its 
relationship to therapeutic interventions, some actual strategies and future 
technologies in an attempt to preserve the kidney, mainly during the 
decompensation of chronic heart failure.

This study was an extension of a previous study that considered dental student 
attitudes about older adults. In the current study, the association of student 
interactions with older adults, in both the dental school clinic and daily life, 
with their attitudes about this group was evaluated using the Aging Semantic 
Differential. A total of 311 dental students across all four years of academic 
standing were included in the study. The results showed that students' 
interactions with older adults outside the clinic did not relate to positive 
attitudes; however, even after controlling for the age of the student and the 
frequency, type of individual, and context of interactions with older adults 
outside the dental clinic, the number of older adult patients seen in the clinic 
showed a significant positive relationship with attitudes towards older adults. 
These results reinforce the conclusions drawn in a previous study that dental 
students' general attitudes about older adults may be changed, but that it is 
the exposure to older adults in a clinical setting that seems to be more 
critical in shaping these attitudes.

AIM: Reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and 
increases hospital survival. We investigated whether the benefit of reperfusion 
therapy for myocardial infarction was sustained long-term and assessed the gain 
in life expectancy by reperfusion therapy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the outcome of 533 patients (mean age 56 years, 
82% men), who were randomized to either reperfusion therapy or conventional 
therapy during 1980-1985. Median follow up was 27 years (25-30 years). At follow 
up, 59 patients (22%) of the 269 patients allocated to reperfusion treatment and 
only 39 patients (15%) of the 264 conventionally treated patients were still 
alive (p = 0.02). The cumulative 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-year survival rates were 
69, 48, 37, and 24% after reperfusion therapy and 59, 38, 27, and 18% in the 
control group, respectively (p < 0.001). Life expectancy of the reperfusion 
group was 15.6 years vs. 12.5 years in the conventionally treated group 
(p < 0.02). Myocardial reinfarction and subsequent coronary interventions were 
more frequent after reperfusion therapy, particularly during the first year. In 
multivariable analysis, reperfusion therapy was an important independent 
predictor of lower mortality at long-term follow up. Other independent 
predictors of mortality were age, impaired left ventricular function, 
multivessel disease, infarct size, and inability to perform an exercise test at 
the time of discharge.
CONCLUSION: These data confirm that the benefits of early reperfusion therapy 
for acute myocardial infarction are sustained throughout the lifetime of the 
patients. More than 3 life years were gained by reperfusion therapy.

Diseases of poverty and lifestyle, well-being and human development.

Singh AR(1), Singh SA.

Author information:
(1)Psychiatrist. Editor, Mens Sana Monographs, India.

The problems of the haves differ substantially from those of the have-nots. 
Individuals in developing societies have to fight mainly against infectious and 
communicable diseases, while in the developed world the battles are mainly 
against lifestyle diseases. Yet, at a very fundamental level, the problems are 
the same-the fight is against distress, disability, and premature death; against 
human exploitation and for human development and self-actualisation; against the 
callousness to critical concerns in regimes and scientific power centres.While 
there has been great progress in the treatment of individual diseases, human 
pathology continues to increase. Sicknesses are not decreasing in number, they 
are only changing in type.The primary diseases of poverty like TB, malaria, and 
HIV/AIDS-and the often co-morbid and ubiquitous malnutrition-take their toll on 
helpless populations in developing countries. Poverty is not just income 
deprivation but capability deprivation and optimism deprivation as well.While 
life expectancy may have increased in the haves, and infant and maternal 
mortality reduced, these gains have not necessarily ensured that well-being 
results. There are ever-multiplying numbers of individuals whose well-being is 
compromised due to lifestyle diseases. These diseases are the result of faulty 
lifestyles and the consequent crippling stress. But it serves no one's purpose 
to understand them as such. So, the prescription pad continues to prevail over 
lifestyle-change counselling or research.The struggle to achieve well-being and 
positive health, to ensure longevity, to combat lifestyle stress and 
professional burnout, and to reduce psychosomatic ailments continues unabated, 
with hardly an end in sight.WE THUS REALISE THAT MORBIDITY, DISABILITY, AND 
DEATH ASSAIL ALL THREE SOCIETIES: the ones with infectious diseases, the ones 
with diseases of poverty, and the ones with lifestyle diseases. If it is 
bacteria in their various forms that are the culprit in infectious diseases, it 
is poverty/deprivation in its various manifestations that is the culprit in 
poverty-related diseases, and it is lifestyle stress in its various avatars that 
is the culprit in lifestyle diseases. It is as though poverty and lifestyle 
stress have become the modern "bacteria" of developing and developed societies, 
respectively.For those societies afflicted with diseases of poverty, of course, 
the prime concern is to escape from the deadly grip of 
poverty-disease-deprivation-helplessness; but, while so doing, they must be 
careful not to land in the lap of lifestyle diseases. For the haves, the need is 
to seek well-being, positive health, and inner rootedness; to ask science not 
only to give them new pills for new ills, but to define and study how negative 
emotions hamper health and how positive ones promote it; to find out what is 
inner peace, what is the connection between spirituality and health, what is 
well-being, what is self-actualisation, what prevents disease, what leads to 
longevity, how simplicity impacts health, what attitudes help cope with chronic 
sicknesses, how sicknesses can be reversed (not just treated), etc. Studies on 
well-being, longevity, and simplicity need the concerted attention of 
researchers.THE TASK AHEAD IS CUT OUT FOR EACH ONE OF US: physician, patient, 
caregiver, biomedical researcher, writer/journalist, science administrator, 
policy maker, ethicist, man of religion, practitioner of alternate/complementary 
medicine, citizen of a world community, etc. Each one must do his or her bit to 
ensure freedom from disease and achieve well-being.Those in the developed world 
have the means to make life meaningful but, often, have lost the meaning of life 
itself; those in the developing world are fighting for survival but, often, have 
recipes to make life meaningful. This is especially true of a society like 
India, which is rapidly emerging from its underdeveloped status. It is an 
ancient civilization, with a philosophical outlook based on a robust mix of the 
temporal and the spiritual, with vibrant indigenous biomedical and related 
disciplines, for example, Ayurveda, Yoga, etc. It also has a burgeoning corpus 
of modern biomedical knowledge in active conversation with the rest of the 
world. It should be especially careful that, while it does not negate the fruits 
of economic development and scientific/biomedical advance that seem to beckon it 
in this century, it does not also forget the values that have added meaning and 
purpose to life; values that the ancients bequeathed it, drawn from their 
experiential knowledge down the centuries.The means that the developed have 
could combine with the recipes to make them meaningful that the developing have. 
That is the challenge ahead for mankind as it gropes its way out of poverty, 
disease, despair, alienation, anomie, and the ubiquitous all-devouring lifestyle 
stresses, and takes halting steps towards well-being and the glory of human 
development.

There is currently a global pandemic of obesity and obesity-engendered 
comorbidities; in particular, certain major chronic metabolic diseases (eg, type 
2 diabetes) which markedly reduce life expectancy and quality of life. This 
review is predicated on the fact that management of the obese patient is a 
primary concern of all physicians and health care providers, and that 
metabolic/bariatric surgery is a highly successful therapeutic option for this 
disease.

[Trends in self-perceived health and chronic disability in the elderly Spanish 
population: evolution between years 1993 and 2006].

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study analyzes the evolution of the health status 
of the non-institutionalized Spanish population of 65 and more years, during the 
period 1993-2006, in terms of self-perceived health and chronic disability.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data were analyzed from the National Health Surveys of 
non-institutionalized population in Spain in the years 1993 and 2006, through 
weighted logistic regression models.
RESULTS: During the period 1993-2006, there was an increase in self-perception 
of good health (0.4%) and chronic disability (2.0%). These increases varied with 
gender and age. Men presented higher prevalences of good self perceived health 
(GSH) and chronic disability than women, and their health evolved also 
differently. The gender gap in GSH reached 15.4% in 2006, while the gap in 
chronic disability reached 10.5%. With age, the prevalence of chronic disability 
increased, and self-perception of good health decreased. The evolution of health 
also varied with age. Individuals 75 years and older showed an opposite 
evolution compared to younger people, decreasing their GSH and increasing their 
chronic disability.
CONCLUSIONS: Results are compatible with a scenario of morbidity compression, 
where expectancy of life in good health increases, concentrating the years in 
bad health and chronic disability in the late ages. Evolution differs by age and 
gender.

BACKGROUND: Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a life-threatening autoimmune bullous 
disease, mediated by autoantibodies directed against antigens on the 
keratinocyte cell surface of stratified squamous epithelia. The frequency of 
ear, nose, and throat (ENT) involvement in PV is not clearly identified.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the ENT involvement in new patients with PV 
examined by ENT endoscopy before and after treatment.
METHODS: This study included 41 new patients with PV. All patients were 
evaluated for ENT manifestations by otoscopic and endoscopic examination before 
treatment. After these examinations, the patients received proper treatment 
according to standard protocols. Thirty patients were re-evaluated by endoscopic 
examination after clinical remission of mucocutaneous signs.
RESULTS: A total of 41 (33 [80.5%] male and 8 [19.5%] female) patients with mean 
age of 44.56 ± 12.76 years entered this study. In ENT examination of patients 
before the treatment, 11 (26.8%) patients showed ear, 15 (36.6%) nasal, 37 
(90.3%) oral, 25 (61%) pharyngeal, and 24 (58.5%) laryngeal involvement. Thirty 
patients underwent the posttreatment ENT examination. We found ear signs in 2 
(6.7%), nasal involvement in 1 (3.3%), oral signs in 4 (13.3%), pharyngeal 
manifestations in 6 (20%), and laryngeal signs in 3 (10%) patients after 
treatment. The treatment was significantly effective in the improvement of 
mucosal lesion in different sites (P < .01).
LIMITATION: Eleven patients refused to undergo posttreatment ENT examination.
CONCLUSION: ENT evaluation may be worthwhile to evaluate the disease extension 
in patients with PV more definitely and exclude other potential etiologies in 
recalcitrant patients.

Avoidable mortality in Estonia: exploring the differences in life expectancy 
between Estonians and non-Estonians in 2005-2007.

Baburin A(1), Lai T, Leinsalu M.

(1)Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, National Institute for Health 
Development, Tallinn, Estonia. alex.baburin@tai.ee

OBJECTIVES: A considerable increase in social inequalities in mortality was 
observed in Eastern Europe during the post-communist transition. This study 
evaluated the contribution of avoidable causes of death to the difference in 
life expectancy between Estonians and non-Estonians in Estonia.
STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study.
METHODS: Temporary life expectancy (TLE) was calculated for Estonian and 
non-Estonian men and women aged 0-74 years in 2005-2007. The ethnic TLE gap was 
decomposed by age and cause of death (classified as preventable or treatable).
RESULTS: The TLE of non-Estonian men was 3.53 years less than that of Estonian 
men, and the TLE of non-Estonian women was 1.36 years less than that of Estonian 
women. Preventable causes of death contributed 2.19 years to the gap for men and 
0.78 years to the gap for women, while treatable causes contributed 0.67 and 
0.33 years, respectively. Cardiorespiratory conditions were the major treatable 
causes of death, with ischaemic heart disease alone contributing 0.29 and 0.08 
years to the gap for men and women, respectively. Conditions related to alcohol 
and substance use represented the largest proportion of preventable causes of 
death.
CONCLUSIONS: Inequalities in health behaviours underlie the ethnic TLE gap in 
Estonia, rather than inequalities in access to health care or the quality of 
health care. Public health interventions should prioritize primary prevention 
aimed at alcohol and substance use, and should be implemented in conjunction 
with wider social policy measures.

The St. Gallen Prize Lecture 2011: evolution of long-term adjuvant anti-hormone 
therapy: consequences and opportunities.

The successful translation of the scientific principles of targeting the breast 
tumour oestrogen receptor (ER) with the nonsteroidal anti-oestrogen tamoxifen 
and using extended durations (at least 5 years) of adjuvant therapy, 
dramatically increased patient survivorship and significantly enhanced a drop in 
national mortality rates from breast cancer. The principles are the same for the 
validation of aromatase inhibitors to treat post-menopausal patients but 
tamoxifen remains a cheap, life-saving medicine for the pre-menopausal patient. 
Results from the Oxford Overview Analysis illustrate the scientific principle of 
"longer is better" for adjuvant therapy in pre-menopausal patients. One year of 
adjuvant therapy is ineffective at preventing disease recurrence or reducing 
mortality, whereas five years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduces recurrence by 50% 
which is maintained for a further ten years after treatment stops. Mortality is 
reduced but the magnitude continues to increase to 30% over a 15-year period. 
With this clinical database, it is now possible to implement simple solutions to 
enhance survivorship. Compliance with long-term anti-hormone adjuvant therapy is 
critical. In this regard, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) to reduce severe menopausal side effects may be inappropriate. It is 
known that SSRIs block the CYP2D6 enzyme that metabolically activates tamoxifen 
to its potent anti-oestrogenic metabolite, endoxifen. The selective 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, venlafaxine, does not block CYP2D6, and may 
be a better choice. Nevertheless, even with perfect compliance, the relentless 
drive of the breast cancer cell to acquire resistance to therapy persists. The 
clinical application of long-term anti-hormonal therapy for the early treatment 
and prevention of breast cancer, focused laboratory research on the discovery of 
mechanisms involved in acquired anti-hormone resistance. Decades of laboratory 
study to reproduce clinical experience described not only the unique mechanism 
of selective ER modulator (SERM)-stimulated breast cancer growth, but also a new 
apoptotic biology of oestradiol action in breast cancer, following 5 years of 
anti-hormonal treatment. Oestradiol-induced apoptotic therapy is currently shown 
to be successful for the short-term treatment of metastatic ER positive breast 
cancer following exhaustive treatment with anti-hormones. The "oestrogen purge" 
concept is now being integrated into trials of long-term adjuvant anti-hormone 
therapy. The Study of Letrazole Extension (SOLE) trial employs "anti-hormonal 
drug holidays" so that a woman's own oestrogen may periodically purge and kill 
the nascent sensitized breast cancer cells that are developing. This is the 
translation of an idea first proposed at the 1992 St. Gallen Conference. 
Although tamoxifen is the first successful targeted therapy in cancer, the 
pioneering medicine is more than that. A study of the pharmacology of tamoxifen 
opened the door for a pioneering application in cancer chemoprevention and 
created a new drug group: the SERMs, with group members (raloxifene and 
lasofoxifene) approved for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis with a 
simultaneous reduction of breast cancer risk. Thus, the combined strategies of 
long-term anti-hormone adjuvant therapy, targeted to the breast tumour ER, 
coupled with the expanding use of SERMs to prevent osteoporosis and prevent 
breast cancer as a beneficial side effect, have advanced patient survivorship 
significantly and promise to reduce breast cancer incidence.

AIM: Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) may use data from cluster randomized 
trials (CRTs), where the unit of randomization is the cluster, not the 
individual. However, most studies use analytical methods that ignore clustering. 
This article compares alternative statistical methods for accommodating 
clustering in CEAs of CRTs.
METHODS: Our simulation study compared the performance of statistical methods 
for CEAs of CRTs with 2 treatment arms. The study considered a method that 
ignored clustering--seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) without a robust 
standard error (SE)--and 4 methods that recognized clustering--SUR and 
generalized estimating equations (GEEs), both with robust SE, a "2-stage" 
nonparametric bootstrap (TSB) with shrinkage correction, and a multilevel model 
(MLM). The base case assumed CRTs with moderate numbers of balanced clusters (20 
per arm) and normally distributed costs. Other scenarios included CRTs with few
