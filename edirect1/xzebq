OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of universal repeat screening for 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the third trimester of 
pregnancy.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare two strategies: 
screening for HIV infection in the first trimester alone compared with the 
addition of repeat screening in the third trimester. Probabilities, costs, and 
utilities were derived from the literature and varied in sensitivity analyses. 
The assumed incidence of HIV infection in pregnancy was 0.0145% or 14.5 per 
100,000. Outcomes included costs (in 2022 U.S. dollars), maternal and neonatal 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cases of neonatal HIV infection. Our 
theoretical cohort contained 3.8 million pregnant individuals, the approximate 
number of births per year in the United States. The willingness-to-pay threshold 
was set at $100,000/QALY. We performed univariable and multivariable sensitivity 
analyses to determine inputs that most influenced the model.
RESULTS: Universal third-trimester screening prevented 133 cases of neonatal HIV 
infection in this theoretical cohort. Universal third-trimester screening led to 
an increased cost of $17.54 million and 2,732 increased QALYs, with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6,418.56 per QALY, less than the 
willingness-to-pay threshold. In a univariate sensitivity analysis, 
third-trimester screening remained cost effective with variation of HIV 
incidence in pregnancy to as low as 0.0052%.
CONCLUSION: In a theoretical U.S.-based cohort of pregnant individuals, 
universal repeat screening for HIV infection in the third trimester was found to 
be cost effective and to reduce vertical transmission of HIV. These results 
merit consideration of a broader HIV-screening program in the third trimester.

INTRODUCTION: Increasing life expectancy raises concerns whether the years 
gained will be spent free of disability. Lately, trends across countries have 
been heterogeneous. This work examined recent trends in disability-free life 
expectancy and life expectancy with mild  or severe disability in Switzerland.
METHODS: Life expectancy was estimated using national life tables, by sex and 
5-year age groups. Based on Sullivan's method, disability-free life expectancy 
and life expectancy with disability were computed using information from the 
Swiss Health Survey on age- and sex-specific prevalence of mild and severe 
disability. Life expectancy, disability-free life expectancy and life expectancy 
with disability were estimated in 2007, 2012, and 2017, at 65 and 80 years of 
age, for both sexes.
RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2017, disability-free life expectancy at 65 and 80 
years of age increased by 2.1 and 1.4 years, respectively, in men and by 1.5 and 
1.1 years, respectively, in women. Meanwhile, life expectancy with mild 
disability decreased by 6 months in both sexes at age 65 and in men at age 80, 
but only 1 month in women at age 80. Life expectancy with severe disability also 
decreased at both ages, by approximately 6 months in women but only 2 to 3 
months in men. The proportion of disability-free life expectancy increased 
significantly in both sexes and ages. For example, disability-free life 
expectancy / life expectancy at age 65 increased from 67% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 66‒69) to 73% (95% CI 71‒74) in women and from 77% (95% CI 75‒79) 
to 82% (95% CI 81‒84) in men.
CONCLUSION: From 2007 to 2017, disability-free life expectancy at age 65 and 80 
increased in Swiss women and men. These gains outweighed those in life 
expectancy, reflecting some compression of morbidity.

Perceived Barriers Among Clinicians and Older Adults Aged 65 and Older Regarding 
Use of Life Expectancy to Inform Cancer Screening: A Narrative Review and 
Comparison.

While cancer screening guidelines increasingly recommend incorporating life 
expectancy estimates to inform screening decisions for older adults, little is 
known about how this happens in practice. This review summarizes current 
knowledge about primary care clinician and older adult (65+) perspectives about 
use of life expectancy to guide cancer screening decisions. Clinicians report 
operational barriers, uncertainty, and hesitation around use of life expectancy 
in screening decisions. They recognize it may help them more accurately weigh 
benefits and harms but are unsure how to estimate life expectancy for individual 
patients. Older adults face conceptual barriers and are generally unconvinced of 
the benefits of considering their life expectancy when making screening 
decisions. Life expectancy will always be a difficult topic for clinicians and 
patients, but there are advantages to incorporating it in cancer screening 
decisions. We highlight key takeaways from both clinician and older adult 
perspectives to guide future research.

OBJECTIVE: In the context of aging, Chinese families consisting of more than 
three generations (grandparents, parents, children) are the norm. The second 
generation (parents) and other family members may establish a downward (contact 
only with children) or two-way multi-generational relationship (contact with 
children and grandparents). These multi-generational relationships may have the 
potential effect on multimorbidity burden and healthy life expectancy in the 
second generation, but less is known about the direction and intensity of this 
effect. This study aims to explore this potential effect.
METHODS: We obtained longitudinal data from the China Health and Retirement 
Longitudinal Study from 2011 to 2018, which included 6,768 people. Cox 
proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association between 
multi-generational relationships and the number of multimorbidity. The Markov 
multi-state transition model was used to analyze the relationship between 
multi-generational relationships and the severity of multimorbidity. The 
multistate life table was used to calculate healthy life expectancy for 
different multi-generational relationships.
RESULTS: The risk of multimorbidity in two-way multi-generational relationship 
was 0.830 (95% CIs: 0.715, 0.963) times higher than that in downward 
multi-generational relationship. For mild multimorbidity burden, downward and 
two-way multi-generational relationship may prevent aggravation of burden. For 
severe multimorbidity burden, two-way multi-generational relationship may 
aggravate the burden. Compared with two-way multi-generational relationship, the 
second generations with downward multi-generational relationship has a higher 
healthy life expectancy at all ages.
CONCLUSION: In Chinese families with more than three generations, the second 
generations with severe multimorbidity burden may aggravate the condition by 
providing support to elderly grandparents, and the support provided by offspring 
to the second generations plays a vital positive role in improving the quality 
of life and narrowing the gap between healthy life expectancy and life 
expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been a global public health 
problem and a major source of suffering and poor quality of life for those 
afflicted. Using data from the global burden of disease (GBD) study 2019, we 
estimated the magnitude of the burden of CKD as well as the underlying causes of 
CKD in the Zambian population.
METHOD: The data used for this study were extracted from the GBD 2019 study. The 
GBD 2019 provides estimates of several metrics of disease burden including the 
commonly used disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) for over 369 diseases and 
injuries, and 87 risk factors and combinations of these in 204 countries and 
territories from 1990 to 2019. We estimated the burden of CKD as the number and 
rates (per 100,000 population) of DALYs, disaggregated by year, sex, and age 
group. We examined the underlying causes of CKD by estimating the population 
attributable fraction as the percentage contributions of risk factors to CKD 
DALY.
RESULTS: The number of DALYs for CKD was estimated as 76.03 million (95% UI: 
61.01 to 93.36) in 2019 compared to 39.42 million (95% UI: 33.09 to 45.90) in 
1990, representing 93% increase whereas the DALYs rate per 100,000 population 
was estimated as 416.89 (95% UI: 334.53 to 511.93) in 2019 compared to 496.38 
(95% UI: 416.55 to 577.87) in 1990, representing 16% reduction. CKD due to 
hypertension accounted for 18.7% of CKD DALYs and CKD due to diabetes (types 1 
and 2) accounted for 22.7%, while CKD from glomerulonephritis accounted for the 
most DALYs at 33%. The age group most impacted from CKD were adolescents and 
young adults.
CONCLUSION: The burden of CKD remains high in the Zambian population with 
diabetes, high blood pressure, and glomerulonephritis as important causes. The 
results highlight the need to develop a comprehensive action plan to prevent and 
treat kidney disease. Increasing the awareness of CKD among the public as well 
as adaptation of guidelines for treating patients with end stage kidney disease 
are important considerations.

Sarcoma is defined as a tumor located in the thoracic cavity. However, sarcoma 
can occur on every side of the body. Synovial sarcoma is a rare soft tissue 
tumor originating from pluripotent with a high malignancy rate. The most common 
predilection of synovial sarcoma is in the joints. Primary synovial sarcoma of 
the lung and mediastinum are rare tumors and generally malignant. There are only 
a few cases have been reported. Definite diagnosis is made by histopathological, 
immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetic examination. The management strategy for 
synovial sarcoma requires multimodality treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, 
and radiotherapy. However, effective and relatively non-toxic therapy for 
primary synovial sarcoma is still developed. The five years life expectancy is 
higher if the patient received adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy after 
surgery.

BACKGROUND: Entamoeba infection-associated diseases (EIADs) in humans are a 
worldwide public health problem, but there is a lack of a global picture of 
EIADs, which is vital to prevention and control.
METHODS: We applied 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data collected from 
multiple sources at global, national and regional levels. The 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) with corresponding 95% uncertainty 
intervals (95% UIs) were extracted as the main measure of the burden of EIADs. 
The Joinpoint regression model was used to estimate the trends of 
age-standardised DALY rates by age, sex, geographical region, and 
sociodemographic index (SDI). Besides, a generalized linear model was conducted 
to analyze the influence of sociodemographic factors on the DALY rate of EIADs.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 2,539,799 (95% UI 850,865-6,186,972) DALY cases 
attributable to Entamoeba infection, and the global age-standardised DALY rate 
of EIADs was 36.77/100,000 (95% UI: 12.03-90.49). Although over the past 30 
years, the age-standardised DALY rate of EIADs presented significantly declining 
trends [average annual percent change (AAPC) = -3.79%, 95% CI: -4.05% - -3.53%], 
it has remained a heavy burden among the age group of <5 years (257.43/100,000, 
95% UI: 67.73-676.78) and the low SDI regions (100.47/100,000, 95% UI: 
32.27-249.09). The age-standardized DALY rate in high-income North America and 
Australia had an increasing trend (AAPC = 0.38%, 95% CI: 0.47% - 0.28% and 
0.38%, 95% CI: 0.46% - 0.29%, respectively). Furthermore, the DALY rates in high 
SDI regions showed statistically significant increasing trends among the age 
groups of 14-49, 50-69 years and 70+ years, with AAPCs of 1.01% (95% CI: 0.87% - 
1.15%), 1.58% (95% CI: 1.43% - 1.73%), and 2.93% (95% CI: 2.58% - 3.29%), 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 30 years, the burden of EIADs has declined 
significantly. However, it has still caused a high burden in the low SDI regions 
and the age group of <5 years. At the same time, in adults and the elderly of 
the high SDI regions, the increasing trends of Entamoeba infection-associated 
burden should also be given more attention.

Within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, goals were 
formulated, including those targeting to improve quality of life of people all 
around the world. The task was formulated to ensure universal coverage of health 
services. In 2019, the United Nations General Assembly noted that at least half 
of world's population have no access to basic health services. The study 
developed methodology to carry out comprehensive comparative analysis of values 
of individual public health indicators and amount of population payments for 
medications to confirm possibility of applying these indicators to monitor 
public health, including possibility of international comparisons. The study 
demonstrated inverse relationship between share of citizens' funds to pay for 
medications, index of universal health coverage and life expectancy. The stable 
direct relationship between such indicators as overall mortality rate from 
non-communicable diseases and likelihood of dying at the age of 30-70 years from 
any of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory 
diseases.

обратная зависимость между долей средств граждан на оплату лекарственных 
средств, индексом всеобщего охвата услугами здравоохранения и ожидаемой 
продолжительностью жизни, а также определена устойчивая прямая взаимосвязь с 
такими показателями, как общий коэффициент смертности от неинфекционных 
заболеваний и вероятность умереть в возрасте 30-70 лет от любого из 
сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний, рака, диабета или хронических респираторных 
заболеваний.

BACKGROUND: France converted to universal pathogen reduced (PR; amotosalen/UVA) 
platelets in 2017 and extended platelet component (PC) shelf-life from 5- to 
7-days in 2018 and 2019. Annual national hemovigilance (HV) reports 
characterized longitudinal PC utilization and safety over 11 years, including 
several years prior to PR adoption as the national standard of care.
METHODS: Data were extracted from published annual HV reports. Apheresis and 
pooled buffy coat [BC] PC use was compared. Transfusion reactions (TRs) were 
stratified by type, severity, and causality. Trends were assessed for three 
periods: Baseline (2010-14; ~7% PR), Period 1 ([P1] 2015-17; 8%-21% PR), and 
Period 2 ([P2] 2018-20; 100% PR).
RESULTS: PC use increased by 19.1% between 2010 and 2020. Pooled BC PC 
production increased from 38.8% to 68.2% of total PCs. Annual changes in PCs 
issued averaged 2.4% per year at baseline, -0.02% (P1) and 2.8% (P2). The 
increase in P2 coincided with a reduction in the target platelet dose and 
extension to 7-day storage. Allergic reactions, alloimmunization, febrile 
non-hemolytic TRs, immunologic incompatibility, and ineffective transfusions 
accounted for >90% of TRs. Overall, TR incidence per 100,000 PCs issued declined 
from 527.9 (2010) to 345.7 (2020). Severe TR rates declined 34.8% between P1-P2. 
Forty-six transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections (TTBI) were associated 
with conventional PCs during baseline and P1. No TTBI were associated with 
amotosalen/UVA PCs. Infections with Hepatitis E (HEV) a non-enveloped virus 
resistant to PR, were reported in all periods.
DISCUSSION: Longitudinal HV analysis demonstrated stable PC utilization trends 
with reduced patient risk during conversion to universal 7-day amotosalen/UVA 
PCs.

Empowering communities through experiential learning: the 'Enhance' program in 
Leadership and Social Medicine.

Clegg R(1).

Author information:

INTRODUCTION: Social determinants of health cause disparities in health and life 
expectancy in the UK1, especially in rural populations. Communities must be 
empowered to control their health2, alongside clinicians being more generalist 
and holistic. Health Education East Midlands is pioneering this approach, 
creating the 'Enhance' program. From August 2022, up to 12 Internal Medicine 
Trainees (IMT) will start the 'Enhance' program. They will spend 1 day per week 
learning about social inequalities, advocacy, and public health, before 
undertaking experiential learning with a community partner, working together to 
create and implement a Quality Improvement (QI) project. This will integrate 
trainees into communities, and help communities utilise assets to create 
sustainable changes. This longitudinal program will span over all 3 years of 
IMT.
METHODS: After conducting a detailed literature search into experiential 
learning and service learning programs in medical education, virtual interviews 
were held with researchers worldwide to discuss how they created, implemented, 
and evaluated similar projects. The curriculum was created using Health 
Education England's 'Enhance' handbook, the IMT curriculum, and relevant 
literature. The teaching program was created with a Public Health specialist.
RESULTS: The program commences in August 2022. Evaluation will commence 
thereafter.
DISCUSSION: This will be the first experiential learning program of this scale 
in UK Postgraduate medical education, with future expansion focusing 
specifically on rural communities. Afterwards, trainees will understand the 
social determinants of health, health policy creation, medical advocacy, 
leadership, and research including asset-based assessments and QI. Trainees will 
be more holistic and generalist, working with and empowering their local 
communities. Future work will evaluate the program after 
commencement.References1 Marmot M, Allen J, Boyce T, Goldblatt P, Morrison J.

Ontogeny of collective behaviour.

Muratore IB(1), Garnier S(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, New Jersey Institute of Technology, 
Newark, NJ 07102, USA.

During their lifetime, superorganisms, like unitary organisms, undergo 
transformations that change the machinery of their collective behaviour. Here, 
we suggest that these transformations are largely understudied and propose that 
more systematic research into the ontogeny of collective behaviours is needed if 
we hope to better understand the link between proximate behavioural mechanisms 
and the development of collective adaptive functions. In particular, certain 
social insects engage in self-assemblage, forming dynamic and physically 
connected architectures with striking similarities to developing multicellular 
organisms, making them good model systems for ontogenetic studies of collective 
behaviour. However, exhaustive time series and three-dimensional data are 
required to thoroughly characterize the different life stages of the collective 
structures and the transitions between these stages. The well-established fields 
of embryology and developmental biology offer practical tools and theoretical 
frameworks that could speed up the acquisition of new knowledge about the 
formation, development, maturity and dissolution of social insect 
self-assemblages and, by extension, other superorganismal behaviours. We hope 
that this review will encourage an expansion of the ontogenetic perspective in 
the field of collective behaviour and, in particular, in self-assemblage 
research, which has far-reaching applications in robotics, computer science and 
regenerative medicine. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 
'Collective behaviour through time'.

BACKGROUND: There is currently a need for additional diagnostic information to 
help guide treatment decisions and to properly determine the best treatment 
pathway for patients identified with indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). The 
aim of this study was to demonstrate the incremental cost-effectiveness of 
LungLB compared to the current clinical diagnostic pathway (CDP) in the 
management of patients with IPNs, from a US payer's perspective.
METHODS: A decision tree and Markov model hybrid was chosen from a payer 
perspective in the US setting, based on published literature, to assess the 
incremental cost-effectiveness of LungLB compared to the current CDP in the 
management of patients with IPNs. Primary endpoints of the analysis include 
expected costs, life years (LYs), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for 
each arm of the model, as well as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER), which is calculated as the incremental costs per QALY, and net monetary 
benefit (NMB).
RESULTS: We find that, with the inclusion of LungLB to the current CDP 
diagnostic pathway, expected LYs over the typical patient's lifespan increase by 
0.07 years and QALYs increase by 0.06. The average patient in the CDP arm will 
pay approximately $44,310 over their lifespan, while a patient in the LungLB arm 
will pay $48,492, resulting in a difference of $4,182. The differentials between 
the CDP and LungLB arms of the model in costs and QALYs yield an ICER of $75,740 
per QALY and an incremental NMB of $1,339.
CONCLUSION: This analysis provides evidence that LungLB, in conjunction with 
CDP, is a cost-effective alternative compared to the current CDP alone in a US 
setting for individuals with IPNs.

BACKGROUND: Patients with malignant tumors are more likely to have psychological 
problems due to their worries about their life expectancy. To understand the 
psychological status of elderly patients with malignant liver tumor undergoing 
hepatectomy better, the study was designed to investigate the current situation 
of anxiety and depression in elderly patients with malignant liver tumor 
undergoing hepatectomy and to analyze its related factors.
METHODS: A total of 126 elderly patients with malignant liver tumor undergoing 
hepatectomy were selected as the research objects. The anxiety and depression of 
all subjects were evaluated by HADS (Hosptial Anxiety and Depression Scale). The 
correlation factors affecting the psychological state of elderly patients with 
malignant liver tumor undergoing hepatectomy were analyzed by linear regression 
method.
RESULTS: The HADS-A score of elderly patients with malignant liver tumor 
undergoing hepatectomy was 8.79 ± 2.56, among which 37 patients were 
asymptomatic, 60 patients with suspicious symptoms, and 29 patients with 
definite symptoms. The HADS-D score was 8.40 ± 2.97, among which 61 patients 
were asymptomatic, 39 patients with suspicious symptoms, and 26 patients with 
definite symptoms. Multivariate analysis using linear regression method showed 
that FRAIL score, residence, and complication were significantly associated with 
anxiety and depression of elderly patients with malignant liver tumor undergoing 
hepatectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety and depression in elderly patients with malignant liver 
tumor undergoing hepatectomy were obvious. FRAIL score, regional differences, 
and the complication were the risk factors for anxiety and depression in elderly 
patients with malignant liver tumor undergoing hepatectomy. Improving frailty, 
reducing regional differences, and preventing complications is beneficial to 
alleviate the adverse mood of elderly patients with malignant liver tumor 
undergoing hepatectomy.

INTRODUCTION: Individuals living with severe mental illness (SMI) have a reduced 
life expectancy of approximately 15-20 years compared to the general 
population1,2. Individuals with SMI and comorbid cancer have increased cancer 
related mortality rates compared to the non SMI population. This scoping review 
examines the current evidence in relation to the impact on cancer outcomes where 
individuals have a pre-existing SMI.
METHODS: Scopus, PsychINFO, PubMed, PsycArticles and the Cochrane Library were 
searched for peer reviewed research articles, published in English language 
between 2001 and 2021. Initial title and abstract screening, followed by full 
text screening sourced articles reporting on the impact of SMI and cancer on: 
stage at diagnosis, survival, treatment access or quality of life. Articles were 
quality appraised, and data were extracted and summarised.
RESULTS: The search yielded 1226 articles, 27 met the inclusion criteria. The 
search yielded no articles that met the inclusion criteria that were from the 
perspective of the service user or that were focused on the impact of SMI and 
cancer quality of life. Three themes were developed following analysis: Cancer 
related mortality, stage at diagnosis, and access to stage appropriate 
treatment.
DISCUSSION: The collective study of populations with comorbid SMI and cancer is 
complex and challenging without a large-scale cohort study. The studies yielded 
through this scoping review were heterogenous and often study multiple diagnoses 
of SMI and cancer. Collectively these indicate that cancer related mortality is 
increased in the population of individuals with pre-existing SMI and the SMI 
population are more likely to have an increased likelihood of metastatic disease 
at diagnosis and less likely to receive stage appropriate treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with pre-existing SMI and cancer have increased cancer 
specific mortality. Comorbid SMI and cancer is complex, and individuals with SMI 
and cancer are less likely to receive optimal treatments, experience increased 
interruptions and delays to treatment.

AIMS: Type 1 diabetes has been associated with a significant reduction in life 
expectancy. Major advances in treatment of type 1 diabetes have been associated 
with improved survival. However, life expectancy for type 1 diabetes under 
contemporary care is not known.
METHODS: Health care registers were used to obtain data on all people with type 
1 diabetes in Finland in 1964-2017 and their mortality in 1972-2017. Survival 
analyses were used to study long-term trends in survival and abridged period 
life table methods to calculate life expectancy estimates. Causes of death were 
examined to consider development.
RESULTS: Study data included 42,936 persons with type 1 diabetes and 6,771 
deaths. Kaplan-Meier curves showed improved survival during the study period. In 
2017, the remaining life expectancy at the age of 20 for a person diagnosed for 
type 1 diabetes was estimated to be 51.64 (95% CI: 51.51, 51.78) years which was 
9.88 (9.74, 10.01) years lower than for the general Finnish population.
CONCLUSIONS: We found improved survival among persons with type 1 diabetes 
during the last decades. However, their life expectancy remained significantly 
below that of the general Finnish population. Our results call for further 
innovations and improvements in diabetes care.

INTRODUCTION: Previously in our unit, urodynamics were delayed after insertion 
of suprapubic (SP) lines. We postulated that performing urodynamics on the same 
day as SP line insertion would not result in increased morbidity. We 
retrospectively compared complications in those having urodynamics on the same 
day against those who had delayed urodynamics.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Notes were reviewed for patients undergoing urodynamics 
via SP lines from May 2009 until December 2018. In 2014 we modified our practice 
to allow urodynamics on the same day as SP line insertion in some patients. 
Patients undergoing videourodynamics would have two 5 Fr (mini Paed) SP lines 
inserted under general anaesthesia. Patients were divided into two groups: those 
that had urodynamics on the same day as SP line insertion and those that had 
urodynamics after an interval of more than one day. The outcome measure was the 
number of problems affecting those in each group. The two groups were compared 
using Mann-Whitney U tests and Fisher's Exact tests.
RESULTS: There were a total of 211 patients with a median age of 6.5 years 
(range three months to 15.9 years). Urodynamics were performed on the same day 
in 86. Delayed Urodynamics were performed at an interval of more than one day in 
125. Adverse events included pain or difficulty with voiding, increased urinary 
frequency, urinary incontinence, leak from catheter site, extravasation, 
extension of in-patient stay, visible haematuria, urethral catheterisation, and 
urinary tract infection. Problems affected 43 (20.4%) children. In the same day 
group, 11 (13.3%) patients had problems, in the delayed group 32 (25.6%) had 
problems; this was statistically significant (p = 0.03). The difference in 
combined incidence of important problems (requiring urethral catheterisation, 
extended admission or abandonment of urodynamics) was not statistically 
significant between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: When using suprapubic catheters for urodynamics there is no 
additional morbidity when catheters are inserted on the same day as the 
urodynamics study compared to when urodynamic are delayed.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted people's lifestyles and 
changed the delivery of health interventions, especially interventions for 
community-dwelling older people with sarcopenia.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize the components and explore the effectiveness of 
home-based interventions for improving sarcopenia and other health-related 
outcomes among community-dwelling older people with sarcopenia.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: The Cochrane Library, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Medline 
(via PubMed), and PsycINFO were searched for relevant papers published from 
January 1, 2010 to March 29, 2022. Only papers written in English were included. 
The modified version of Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the 
risks of bias in the included studies. The template for intervention description 
and replication checklist was used to summarize the intervention components. The 
mean difference (MD) or standard mean difference with a 95 % confidence interval 
(CI) was used to determine the effect size of studies using the same or 
different measuring methods. Random-effects models were in meta-analyses to pool 
the effects of home-based interventions on the included outcomes.
RESULTS: After detailed screening and exclusion, 11 randomized controlled trials 
including 1136 older people with sarcopenia were included in our analyses. Three 
categories of home-based interventions were identified: exercise interventions, 
nutritional interventions, and combined exercise and nutritional interventions. 
The overall analysis of the outcomes (e.g., appendicular skeletal muscle mass 
index, lean mass, body fat mass, handgrip strength, and gait speed), showed that 
the effects of home-based exercise interventions were inconclusive. Compared 
with passive controls, home-based exercise interventions significantly improved 
knee extension strength (MD = 0.56 kg, 95 % CI: 0.09, 1.03, p = 0.020) and 
reduced the time required to complete the Timed Up and Go Test (MD = -1.41 s, 
95 % CI: -2.28, -0.54, p = 0.001). Home-based nutritional interventions were 
effective in improving appendicular skeletal muscle mass (MD = 0.25 kg, 95 % CI: 
0.02, 0.49, p = 0.030), gait speed (MD = 0.06 m/s, 95 % CI: 0.03, 0.09, p = 
0.0001), and quality of life in terms of both the physical component summary 
(MD = 13.54, 95 % CI: 0.73, 26.34, p = 0.040) and mental component summary 
scores (MD = 8.69, 95 % CI: 2.98, 14.41, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: Home-based exercise interventions have the potential to improve 
muscle strength and physical function, while home-based nutritional 
interventions are effective in increasing muscle mass, physical function, and 
quality of life. Both of these can be applied at home during and after the 
COVID-19 pandemic to alleviate sarcopenia and improve health-related outcomes in 
community-dwelling older people.

PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH: The success of modern health care increases life 
expectancy and prolongs the days of having multimorbidity and functional 
limitations; the so-defined "high need, high cost (HNHC)" state represents the 
extreme scenarios of care burden and complexity. This study aims to explore 
health care utilization and the risk of preventable adverse outcomes stratified 
by age and HNHC state.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the 
National Health Insurance (NHI) database. People aged ≥40 years were included 
and further stratified by age (middle-aged: 40-64 and older adults: 65) and HNHC 
state (top 10% of spending). Health care utilization and drug consumption across 
different groups were obtained. The multimorbidity frailty index (mFI) was 
developed for further analysis. Cox regression models were used to examine the 
associations between HNHC and adverse clinical outcomes (preventable 
hospitalizations, preventable emergency department visits, and mortality).
RESULTS: HNHC participants were older, had a higher mFI and drug consumption, 
and had higher health care utilization. Compared with non-HNHC participants, 
HNHC participants exhibited a 4.4-fold and 2.4-fold higher risk of preventable 
hospitalizations in middle-aged (HR=4.41; 95% CI, 4.17-4.65, p<0.01) and older 
adults (HR=2.44; 95% CI, 2.34-2.55, p<0.01). Similar risks were observed for 
preventable emergency department visits and mortality (all p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The HNHC state substantially increased health care utilization, 
polypharmacy, and potentially preventable adverse outcomes after adjustment for 
frailty. Intervention studies developing integrated care models using the 
life-course approach are needed to improve the quality of health care systems in 
super-aged societies.

BACKGROUND: Chlamydia remains a significant public health problem that 
contributes to adverse reproductive health outcomes. In the United States, 
sexually active women 24 years and younger are recommended to receive annual 
screening for chlamydia. In this study, we evaluated the impact of estimated 
current levels of screening and partner notification (PN), and the impact of 
screening based on guidelines on chlamydia associated sequelae, quality adjusted 
life years (QALYs) lost and costs.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of chlamydia screening, 
using a published calibrated pair formation transmission model that estimated 
trends in chlamydia screening coverage in the United States from 2000 to 2015 
consistent with epidemiological data. We used probability trees to translate 
chlamydial infection outcomes into estimated numbers of chlamydia-associated 
sequelae, QALYs lost, and health care services costs (in 2020 US dollars). We 
evaluated the costs and population health benefits of screening and PN in the 
United States for 2000 to 2015, as compared with no screening and no PN. We also 
estimated the additional benefits that could be achieved by increasing screening 
coverage to the levels indicated by the policy recommendations for 2016 to 2019, 
compared with screening coverage achieved by 2015.
RESULTS: Screening and PN from 2000 to 2015 were estimated to have averted 1.3 
million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 490,000-2.3 million) cases of pelvic 
inflammatory disease, 430,000 (95% UI, 160,000-760,000) cases of chronic pelvic 
pain, 300,000 (95% UI, 104,000-570,000) cases of tubal factor infertility, and 
140,000 (95% UI, 47,000-260,000) cases of ectopic pregnancy in women. We 
estimated that chlamydia screening and PN cost $9700 per QALY gained compared 
with no screening and no PN. We estimated the full realization of chlamydia 
screening guidelines for 2016 to 2019 to cost $30,000 per QALY gained, compared 
with a scenario in which chlamydia screening coverage was maintained at 2015 
levels.
DISCUSSION: Chlamydia screening and PN as implemented in the United States from 
2000 through 2015 has substantially improved population health and provided good 
value for money when considering associated health care services costs. Further 
population health gains are attainable by increasing screening further, at 
reasonable cost per QALY gained.

    J Arthroplasty. 2023 Nov 17;:

BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) may improve clinical 
outcomes for patients who have end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee. However, 
the costs of rTKA are high, and there is a paucity of data evaluating the 
cost-effectiveness of rTKA. We aimed to analyze the cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) of rTKA relative to manual TKA.
METHODS: A Markov decision analysis was performed using known parameters for 
costs, outcomes, implant survivorships, and mortalities. The cost-effectiveness 
of rTKA relative to manual TKA was assessed for end-stage knee osteoarthritis 
patients who had a mean age of 65 years (range, 27 to 94 years). The rTKA costs 
were calculated for a pay-per-use contract robot.
