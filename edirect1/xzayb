Expansins are proteins that are generally accepted to be key regulators of cell 
wall extension and plant growth. We examined the expression pattern of TaEXPB23, 
a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) expansin gene, under exogenous phytohormone and 
abiotic stress treatments. In addition, we evaluated its function in the 
tolerance to salt stress and high temperature (HT) by overexpressing it in 
transgenic tobacco plants. In subcellular localization assays, TaEXPB23 
localized to the cell wall. Expression analysis demonstrated that the 
transcription pattern of TaEXPB23 corresponded to wheat coleoptile growth. 
Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that TaEXPB23 transcript expression was 
upregulated by exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salt stress, but 
downregulated by exogenous gibberellins (GA₃), ethylene (ET), indole-3-acetic 
acid (IAA) and α-naphthlcetic acid (NAA). Overexpression of TaEXPB23 in tobacco 
(tabacum) conferred tolerance to salt stress by enhancing water retention 
ability (WRA) and decreasing osmotic potential (OP). However, transgenic plants 
overexpressing TaEXPB23 did not show any improvement in the tolerance to HT 
stress. These results suggested that TaEXPB23 is regulated by phytohormones and 
is involved in the regulation of salt stress tolerance.

Screening of healthcare workers for tuberculosis: development and validation of 
a new health economic model to inform practice.

University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.

BACKGROUND: Methods for determining cost-effectiveness of different treatments 
are well established, unlike appraisal of non-drug interventions, including 
novel diagnostics and biomarkers.
OBJECTIVE: The authors develop and validate a new health economic model by 
comparing cost-effectiveness of tuberculin skin test (TST); blood test, 
interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and TST followed by IGRA in conditional 
sequence, in screening healthcare workers for latent or active tuberculosis 
(TB).
DESIGN: The authors focus on healthy life years gained as the benefit metric, 
rather than quality-adjusted life years given limited data to estimate quality 
adjustments of life years with TB and complications of treatment, like 
hepatitis. Healthy life years gained refer to the number of TB or hepatitis 
cases avoided and the increase in life expectancy. The authors incorporate 
disease and test parameters informed by systematic meta-analyses and clinical 
practice. Health and economic outcomes of each strategy are modelled as a 
decision tree in Markov chains, representing different health states informed by 
epidemiology. Cost and effectiveness values are generated as the individual is 
cycled through 20 years of the model. Key parameters undergo one-way and Monte 
Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
SETTING: Screening healthcare workers in secondary and tertiary care.
RESULTS: IGRA is the most effective strategy, with incremental costs per healthy 
life year gained of £10 614-£20 929, base case, £8021-£18 348, market costs TST 
£45, IGRA £90, IGRA specificities of 99%-97%; mean (5%, 95%), £12 060 
(£4137-£38 418) by Monte Carlo analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Incremental costs per healthy life year gained, a conservative 
estimate of benefit, are comparable to the £20 000-£30 000 NICE band for IGRA 
alone, across wide differences in disease and test parameters. Health gains 
justify IGRA costs, even if IGRA tests cost three times TST. This health 
economic model offers a powerful tool for appraising non-drug interventions in 
the market and under development.

Should identical CVD risks in young and old patients be managed identically? 
Results from two models.

Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

OBJECTIVES: To assess whether delaying risk reduction treatment has a different 
impact on potential life years lost in younger compared with older patients at 
the same baseline short-term cardiovascular risk.
DESIGN: Modelling based on population data.
METHODS: Potential years of life lost from a 5-year treatment delay were 
estimated for patients of different ages but with the same cardiovascular risk 
(either 5% or 10% 5-year risk). Two models were used: an age-based residual life 
expectancy model and a Markov simulation model. Age-specific case fatality rates 
and time preferences were applied to both models, and competing mortality risks 
were incorporated into the Markov model.
RESULTS: Younger patients had more potential life years to lose if untreated, 
but the maximum difference between 35 and 85 years was <1 year, when models were 
unadjusted for time preferences or competing risk. When these adjusters were 
included, the maximum difference fell to about 1 month, although the direction 
was reversed with older people having more to lose.
CONCLUSIONS: Surprisingly, age at onset of treatment has little impact on the 
likely benefits of interventions that reduce cardiovascular risk because of the 
opposing effects of life expectancy, case fatality, time preferences and 
competing risks. These findings challenge the appropriateness of recommendations 
to use lower risk-based treatment thresholds in younger patients.

A globalization-oriented perspective on health, inequality and socio-economic 
development.

Tausch A(1).

Author information:

OBJECTIVES: There has been an attention to inequality as a causal factor for 
deficient health in the medical journals over the last decades (Richard G. 
Wilkinson et al. and Schnell et al.); however, the reasons for inequality and 
the interactions of the underlying causes of inequality at the level of the 
world economy have not yet been properly explored in this kind of literature. 
The aim of this article is to provide a new, globalization-oriented, 
multi-disciplinary perspective on life expectancy, under-five mortality, 
inequality and socio-economic development in the world system, compatible with 
the advances in international sociological research on the subject over the last 
three decades.
DESIGN: Taking up the traditions of quantitative sociology to study the effects 
of multinational corporation (MNC) penetration as a key determining variable for 
development outcomes such as socio-economic inequality and infant mortality, 
this article analyzes from the perspective of quantitative political science and 
economics this particular role of MNC penetration as the key variable for the 
determination of health, inequality and socio-economic development in 183 
countries of the world system, using international social science standard data.
MAIN OUTCOMES: As correctly predicted by quantitative sociology, but largely 
overlooked by the medical profession, the development style, implied by a high 
MNC penetration of their host countries, reflects the oligopolistic power, which 
transnational corporations wield over local economies. We took up an idea from 
Austro-American economist Joseph Alois Schumpeter (1883-1950), which states that 
the long-term effects of oligopolistic power are negative and lead toward 
economic and social stagnation. Our data show that although MNC penetration 
indeed led to certain short-term growth effects after 1990, today, social 
polarization and stagnation increase as a consequence of the development model, 
based on high MNC penetration. There is a negative trade-off between MNC 
penetration and health, both in terms of life expectancy and avoiding under-five 
mortality. But it can be shown for the 115 countries with complete data that 
Richard G. Wilkinson's hypothesis still plays an important role in explaining 
deficient health development in the world system, once we control for the 
effects of MNC penetration-driven globalization.

Expanding the recommendations for annual influenza vaccination to school-age 
children in the United States.

30329, USA. afiore@cdc.gov

BACKGROUND: Despite long-standing recommendations to vaccinate children who have 
underlying chronic medical conditions or who are contacts of high-risk persons, 
vaccination coverage among school-age children remains low. Community studies 
have indicated that school-age children have the highest incidence of influenza 
and are an important source of amplifying and sustaining community transmission 
that affects all age groups.
METHODS: A consultation to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a 
universal recommendation for annual influenza vaccination of all children age ≥6 
months was held in Atlanta, Georgia, in September 2007. Consultants provided 
summaries of current data on vaccine effectiveness, safety, supply, successful 
program implementation, and economics studies and discussed challenges 
associated with continuing a risk- and contact-based vaccination strategy 
compared with a universal vaccination recommendation.
RESULTS: Consultants noted that school-age children had a substantial illness 
burden caused by influenza, that vaccine was safe and effective for children 
aged 6 months through 18 years, and that evidence suggested that vaccinating 
school-age children would provide benefits to both the vaccinated children and 
their unvaccinated household and community contacts. However, implementation of 
an annual recommendation for all school-age children would pose major challenges 
to parents, medical providers and health care systems. Alternative vaccination 
venues were needed, and of these school-located vaccination programs might offer 
the most promise as an alternative vaccination site for school-age children.
CONCLUSIONS: Expansion of recommendations to include all school-age children 
will require additional development of an infrastructure to support 
implementation and methods to adequately evaluate impact.

Is it beneficial to increase the provision of thrombolysis?-- a discrete-event 
simulation model.

Cromore Road, Coleraine, NI, BT52 1SA, UK.

BACKGROUND: Although Thrombolysis has been licensed in the UK since 2003, it is 
still administered only to a small percentage of eligible patients.
AIM: We consider the impact of investing the impact of thrombolysis on important 
acute stroke services, and the effect on quality of life. The concept is 
illustrated using data from the Northern Ireland Stroke Service.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
METHODS: We first present results of survival analysis utilizing length of stay 
(LOS) for discharge destinations, based on data from the Belfast City Hospital 
(BCH). None of these patients actually received thrombolysis but from those who 
would have been eligible, we created two initial groups, the first representing 
a scenario where they received thrombolysis and the second comprising those who 
do not receive thrombolysis. On the basis of the survival analysis, we created 
several subgroups based on discharge destination. We then developed a discrete 
event simulation (DES) model, where each group is a patient pathway within the 
simulation. Coxian phase type distributions were used to model the group LOS. 
Various scenarios were explored focusing on cost-effectiveness across hospital, 
community and social services had thrombolysis been administered to these 
patients, and the possible improvement in quality of life, should the proportion 
of patients who are administered thrombolysis be increased. Our aim in 
simulating various scenarios for this historical group of patients is to assess 
what the cost-effectiveness of thrombolysis would have been under different 
scenarios; from this we can infer the likely cost-effectiveness of future 
policies.
RESULTS: The cost of thrombolysis is offset by reduction in hospital, community 
rehabilitation and institutional care costs, with a corresponding improvement in 
quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that provision of thrombolysis would produce 
moderate overall improvement to the service assuming current levels of funding.

The increasing burden of harm resulting from the use of multiple drugs in older 
patient populations represents a major health problem in developed countries. 
Approximately 1 in 4 older patients admitted to hospitals are prescribed at 
least 1 inappropriate medication, and up to 20% of all inpatient deaths are 
attributable to potentially preventable adverse drug reactions. To minimize this 
drug-related iatrogenesis, we propose a quality use of medicine framework that 
comprises 10 sequential steps: 1) ascertain all current medications; 2) identify 
patients at high risk of or experiencing adverse drug reactions; 3) estimate 
life expectancy in high-risk patients; 4) define overall care goals in the 
context of life expectancy; 5) define and confirm current indications for 
ongoing treatment; 6) determine the time until benefit for disease-modifying 
medications; 7) estimate the magnitude of benefit versus harm in relation to 
each medication; 8) review the relative utility of different drugs; 9) identify 
drugs that may be discontinued; and 10) implement and monitor a drug 
minimization plan with ongoing reappraisal of drug utility and patient adherence 
by a single nominated clinician. The framework aims to reduce drug use in older 
patients to the minimum number of essential drugs, and its utility is 
demonstrated in reference to a hypothetic case study. Further studies are 
warranted in validating this framework as a means for assisting clinicians to 
make more appropriate prescribing decisions in at-risk older patients.

Comment in
    Lancet. 2012 Mar 3;379(9818):777.

China has seen the largest human migration in history, and the country's rapid 
urbanisation has important consequences for public health. A provincial analysis 
of its urbanisation trends shows shifting and accelerating rural-to-urban 
migration across the country and accompanying rapid increases in city size and 
population. The growing disease burden in urban areas attributable to nutrition 
and lifestyle choices is a major public health challenge, as are troubling 
disparities in health-care access, vaccination coverage, and accidents and 
injuries in China's rural-to-urban migrant population. Urban environmental 
quality, including air and water pollution, contributes to disease both in urban 
and in rural areas, and traffic-related accidents pose a major public health 
threat as the country becomes increasingly motorised. To address the health 
challenges and maximise the benefits that accompany this rapid urbanisation, 
innovative health policies focused on the needs of migrants and research that 
could close knowledge gaps on urban population exposures are needed.

Economic analysis of active surveillance for localized prostate cancer.

Kim S 2nd(1), Dall'Era MA, Evans CP.

Author information:
(1)Department of Urology, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, 
California, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Active surveillance is gaining wider acceptance in the 
urologic community as an effective treatment option for patients with low-risk 
prostate cancer. The purpose of this review is to analyze the economics of 
active surveillance in comparison with other therapies.
RECENT FINDINGS: Evaluating the economics of active surveillance in patients 
with low-risk prostate cancer is constrained by a prolonged natural history of 
disease. Recent cost model studies using hypothetical patients with low-risk 
prostate cancer showed that the estimated direct cost of active surveillance 
over long term was the lowest compared with direct costs of immediate treatment 
with radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy, primary androgen 
deprivation therapy or brachytherapy. Active surveillance is associated with 
more quality-adjusted life years than immediate therapies with similar or lower 
lifetime costs. Physician reimbursement for active surveillance exceeded that 
from upfront radical prostatectomy after 3-5 years of follow-up and may be an 
important driving factor for physicians to practice active surveillance.
SUMMARY: Active surveillance appears to reduce prostate cancer healthcare 
expenditure by reducing the number of costly therapies. Results from clinical 
trials will allow the measurement of the true economic value of active 
surveillance in the future.

Fair reckoning: a qualitative investigation of responses to an economic health 
resource allocation survey.

Health Economics & Policy Analysis, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONProfessor, 
Department of Economics, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONDoctoral Candidate, 
Health Research Methodology Program, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate how participants in an economic resource allocation 
survey construct notions of fairness.
DESIGN: Qualitative interview study guided by interpretive grounded theory 
methods.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with volunteer 
university- (n=39) and community-based (n =7) economic survey participants. 
INTERVENTION OR MAIN VARIABLES STUDIED: We explored how participants constructed 
meanings to guide or explain fair survey choices, focusing on rationales, 
imagery and additional desired information not provided in the survey scenarios.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data were transcribed and coded into qualitative 
categories. Analysis iterated with data collection iterated through three waves 
of interviews.
RESULTS: Participants compared the survey dilemmas to domains outside the health 
system. Most compared them with other micro-level, inter-personal sharing tasks. 
Participants raised several fairness-relevant factors beyond need or capacity to 
benefit. These included age, weight, poverty, access to other options and 
personal responsibility for illness; illness duration, curability or 
seriousness; life expectancy; possibilities for sharing; awareness of other's 
needs; and ability to explain allocations to those affected. They also 
articulated a fairness principle little considered by equity theories: that 
everybody must get something and nobody should get nothing.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Lay criteria for judging fairness are myriad. Simple 
scenarios may be used to investigate lay commitments to abstract principles. 
Although principles are the focus of analysis and inference, participants may 
solve simplified dilemmas by imputing extraneous features to the problem or 
applying unanticipated principles. These possibilities should be taken into 
account in the design of resource allocation surveys eliciting the views of the 
public.

Reappraisal of the options for colorectal cancer screening in England.

Whyte S(1), Chilcott J, Halloran S.

Author information:

AIM: The aim was to use newly available data to estimate the cost effectiveness 
and endoscopy requirements of screening options for colorectal cancer (CRC) to 
inform screening policy in England.
METHODS: A state transition model simulated the life experience of a cohort of 
individuals in the general population of England with normal colon/rectal 
epithelium through to the development of adenomas and CRC and subsequent death. 
CRC natural history model parameters and screening test characteristics were 
estimated simultaneously by a process of model calibration. This process was 
fitted to observed data on CRC incidence in the absence of screening, data from 
existing screening programmes, and data from the UK flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) 
screening trial. The costs, effects and resource impact were evaluated for a 
range of screening options involving the guaiac or immunochemical faecal occult 
blood test (gFOBT/iFOBT) and FS.
RESULTS: The model suggests that screening strategies involving FS or iFOBT may 
produce additional benefits compared with the current policy of biennial gFOBT 
for 60-74-year-olds. The age at which a single FS screen results in the greatest 
quality-adjusted life year gain was 55, with similar gains for ages between 52 
and 58. Strategies which combined FS and iFOBT showed further benefits and 
improved economic outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Strategies which combine different screening modalities may provide 
greater clinical and economic benefits. The collection of comprehensive 
screening data using a uniform format will enable comparative analysis across 
screening programmes in different countries, will improve our understanding of 
the disease and will allow identification of optimal screening modalities.

Acromegaly remains a therapeutic challenge for the endocrinologist. Among the 
available therapeutic options, octreotide long-acting repeatable (Sandostatin(®) 
LAR(®), Novartis) plays a chief role, both as a primary therapy and as an 
adjuvant treatment after unsuccessful surgery. A plethora of papers and a 
meta-analysis have demonstrated its efficacy in: control of clinical picture; 
achievement of safe growth hormone and normal age-matched IGF-I levels (both 
factors associated with restoration of normal life expectancy) in 60-70% of 
patients; control of tumor volume (with real shrinkage in over half of cases); 
and halt or reversal of most acromegaly-associated comorbidities. Treatment is 
well tolerated in most patients and can be safely prolonged for many years if 
required.

The benefits of moderate amounts of alcohol for a better health and longer life 
expectancy compared with abstinence have been suggested by the findings of 
numerous studies. However, controversies have emerged regarding the influence of 
confounding factors and the systematic errors that might have been inadvertently 
disregarded in the early studies. This review includes a description of the 
findings of those research studies published in the last 5 years on the effects 
of moderate alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality, CVD and inflammation, 
the immune system, insulin sensitivity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD) and cancer. Promising evidences exist from both animal studies and human 
clinical trials regarding intermediate end-points of CHD and insulin 
sensitivity, such as HDL, adiponectin or fibrinogen. However, controversies and 
inconsistent findings exist regarding many of these diseases and related 
functions and biomarkers. Further research and human randomised-controlled 
trials with adequate standardisation of the study conditions are necessary in 
order to draw a comparison between studies, establish the causal effect of 
moderate alcohol intake on disease protection and reach consensus on the 
circumstances that allow the recommendation of moderate alcohol habitual intakes 
as a strategy for health maintenance.

While most studies assess the cost-effectiveness of treating acute coronary 
conditions, the Century Health Study for Cardiovascular Medicine (Century Trial) 
focuses on ameliorating coronary artery disease (CAD) through a comprehensive 
lifestyle modification program. This 1,300-patient phase III randomized study 
uses positron emission tomography for risk stratification, complemented with 
comprehensive educational and motivational therapy for patients with preclinical 
or established CAD. The Century Trial is in its second year of a five-year 
follow-up protocol, and it is one of the first to combine imaging technology and 
lifestyle modification as a way to improve patient behavior and health. In this 
article, we present the economic study design used in the Century Trial and 
provide considerable methodological detail to serve as reference for other 
researchers. We describe the cost and effect estimation methods as well as our 
analysis and uncertainty modeling plans. The study will incorporate 
quality-adjusted life years and use a societal perspective to measure both 
in-trial and lifetime costs through incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The 
approach we follow should provide further evidence on the cost-effectiveness of 
comprehensive lifestyle modification programs in regressing coronary artery 
disease.

Educational attainment and longevity are strongly related. Large population 
studies covering long periods to provide evidence of trends in educational 
inequalities regarding life expectancy are scarce though, especially prior to 
the 1980s. Our objective was to document changes in life expectancy by education 
in Norway in the period 1961-2009, and to determine whether the patterns differ 
between sexes. This is a register-based population study of all Norwegian 
residents over 34 years, with data from the National Central Population Registry 
and the National Education Database. For each calendar year during 1961-2009, 
death rates by 1 year age groups were calculated separately for each sex and 
three educational categories (primary, secondary and tertiary). Annual life 
tables were used to calculate life expectancy at age 35 (e ( 35 )) and survival 
probability for the three age-intervals 35-44, 45-64, and 65-90. All education 
groups increased their e ( 35 ) over time, but inequalities in e ( 35 ) between 
tertiary and primary educational categories widened 5.3 years for men and 3.2 
years for women during the study period. The probability for women with primary 
education to survive to age 64 did not improve from 1961 to 2009. The gain in 
life expectancy lagged about 10 years in lower compared to higher education 
groups which might suggest that improvements in life sustaining factors reach 
different segments of the population at different times. The widening of the gap 
seems to have partly tapered off over the last two decades, and the changes in 
life expectancy should be followed carefully in the future to document the 
development.

PURPOSE: The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) C9343 trial found that adjuvant 
radiation therapy (RT) provided minimal benefits for older women with breast 
cancer. Although treatment guidelines were changed to indicate that some women 
could forego RT, the impact of the C9343 results on clinical practice is 
unclear.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
(SEER) -Medicare data set to assess the use of adjuvant RT in a sample of women 
≥ 70 years old diagnosed with stage I breast cancer from 2001 to 2007 who 
fulfilled the C9343 inclusion criteria. We used log-binomial regression to 
estimate the relation between publication of C9343 and use of RT in the full 
sample and across strata of patient and health system characteristics.
RESULTS: Of the 12,925 Medicare beneficiaries in our sample (mean age, 77.7 
years), 76.5% received RT. Approximately 79% of women received RT before study 
publication compared with 75% after (adjusted relative risk of receiving RT 
postpublication v prepublication: 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95 to 0.98). Although use of 
RT was lower after the trial within all strata of age and life expectancy, the 
magnitude of this decrease did not differ significantly by strata. For instance, 
among patients with life expectancy less than 5 years, RT use decreased by 3.7%, 
from 44.4% prepublication to 40.7% postpublication. Among patients with life 
expectancy ≥ 10 years, RT use decreased by 3.0%, from 92.0% to 89.0%.
CONCLUSION: The C9343 trial had minimal impact on the use of RT among older 
women in the Medicare population, even among the oldest women and those with 
shorter life expectancies.

PURPOSE: The 2006 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline 
recommended primary prophylaxis (PP) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 
(G-CSF) instead of secondary prophylaxis (SP) for elderly patients with diffuse 
aggressive lymphoma receiving chemotherapy. We examined the cost-effectiveness 
of PP when compared with SP.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis to compare PP to SP for diffuse 
aggressive lymphoma. We used a Markov model with an eight-cycle chemotherapy 
time horizon with a government-payer perspective and Ontario health, economic, 
and cost data. Data for efficacies of G-CSF, probabilities, and utilities were 
obtained from published literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was 
conducted.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of PP to SP was $700,500 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). One-way sensitivity analyses 
(willingness-to-pay threshold = $100,000/QALY) showed that if PP were to be 
cost-effective, the cost of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia (FN) had to 
be more than $31,138 (2.5 × > base case), the cost of G-CSF per cycle less than 
$960 (base case = $1,960), the risk of first-cycle FN more than 47% (base case = 
24%), or the relative risk reduction of FN with G-CSF more than 91% (base case = 
41%). Our result was robust to all variables. PSA revealed a 10% probability of 
PP being cost-effective over SP at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: PP is not cost-effective when compared with SP in this population. 
PP becomes attractive only if the cost of hospitalization for FN is 
significantly higher or the cost of G-CSF is significantly lower.

Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2012 Mar 6;156(5):I30.

DESCRIPTION: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related 
deaths for men and women in the United States. The American College of 
Physicians (ACP) developed this guidance statement for clinicians by assessing 
the current guidelines developed by other organizations on screening for 
colorectal cancer. When multiple guidelines are available on a topic or when 
existing guidelines conflict, ACP believes that it is more valuable to provide 
clinicians with a rigorous review of the available guidelines rather than 
develop a new guideline on the same topic.
METHODS: The authors searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse to identify 
guidelines developed in the United States. Four guidelines met the inclusion 
criteria: a joint guideline developed by the American Cancer Society, the U.S. 
Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of 
Radiology and individual guidelines developed by the Institute for Clinical 
Systems Improvement, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and the American 
College of Radiology. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 1: ACP recommends that clinicians 
perform individualized assessment of risk for colorectal cancer in all adults. 
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 2: ACP recommends that clinicians screen for colorectal 
cancer in average-risk adults starting at the age of 50 years and in high-risk 
adults starting at the age of 40 years or 10 years younger than the age at which 
the youngest affected relative was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. GUIDANCE 
STATEMENT 3: ACP recommends using a stool-based test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or 
optical colonoscopy as a screening test in patients who are at average risk. ACP 
recommends using optical colonoscopy as a screening test in patients who are at 
high risk. Clinicians should select the test based on the benefits and harms of 
the screening test, availability of the screening test, and patient preferences. 
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 4: ACP recommends that clinicians stop screening for 
colorectal cancer in adults over the age of 75 years or in adults with a life 
expectancy of less than 10 years.

Genetic background modulates the phenotype of a mouse model of DYT1 dystonia.

Tanabe LM(1), Martin C, Dauer WT.

Author information:

Michigan, United States of America.

DYT1 dystonia is a debilitating neurological disease characterized by 
involuntary twisting movements. The disease is caused by an in-frame deletion 
(GAG, "ΔE") mutation in the TOR1A gene that encodes the torsinA protein. 
Intriguingly, only 30% of mutation carriers exhibit motor symptoms despite the 
fact that functional brain imaging studies show abnormal brain metabolism in all 
carriers. Because genetic modifiers may be a determinant of this reduced 
penetrance, we examined the genetic contribution of three different inbred 
strains of mice on the DYT1 mutation in animals that are homozygous 
(Tor1a(ΔE/ΔE)) or heterozygous (Tor1a(ΔE/+); disease state) for the 
disease-causing ΔE mutation. We find that the DBA/2J, C57BL/6J, and CD1-ICR 
contribution of genes significantly alter lifespan in Tor1a(ΔE/ΔE) mice, which 
die during the first few days of life on the 129S6/SvEvTac (129) background. The 
C57BL/6J (B6) strain significantly decreases life expectancy of Tor1a(ΔE/ΔE) 
animals but, like 129S6/SvEvTac Tor1a(ΔE/+) mice, congenic C57BL/6J Tor1a(ΔE/+) 
mice do not exhibit any motor abnormalities. In contrast, the DBA/2J (D2) strain 
significantly increases life expectancy. This effect was not present in congenic 
DBA/2J Tor1a(ΔE/ΔE) mice, indicating that the extended lifespan of F2 129/D2 
mice was due to a combination of homozygous and heterozygous allelic effects. 
Our observations suggest that genetic modifiers may alter the penetrance of the 
ΔE mutation, and that mapping these modifiers may provide fresh insight into the 
torsinA molecular pathway.

OBJECT: The object of this study was to determine whether aggressive treatment 
of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), including invasive intracranial 
monitoring and decompressive craniectomy, is cost-effective.
METHODS: A decision-analytical model was created to compare costs, outcomes, and 
cost-effectiveness of 3 strategies for treating a patient with severe TBI. The 
aggressive-care approach is compared with "routine care," in which Brain Trauma 
Foundation guidelines are not followed. A "comfort care" category, in which a 
single day in the ICU is followed by routine floor care, is included for 
comparison only. Probabilities of each treatment resulting in various Glasgow 
Outcome Scale (GOS) scores were obtained from the literature. The GOS scores 
were converted to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), based on expected 
longevity and calculated quality of life associated with each GOS category. 
Estimated direct (acute and long-term medical care) and indirect (loss of 
productivity) costs were calculated from the perspective of society. Sensitivity 
analyses employed a 2D Monte Carlo simulation of 1000 trials, each with 1000 
patients. The model was also used to estimate these values for patients 40, 60, 
and 80 years of age.
RESULTS: For the average 20-year-old, aggressive care yields 11.7 (± 1.6 [SD]) 
QALYs, compared with routine care (10.0 ± 1.5 QALYs). This difference is highly 
significant (p < 0.0001). Although the differences in effectiveness between the 
2 strategies diminish with advancing age, aggressive care remains significantly 
better at all ages. When all costs are considered, aggressive care is also 
significantly less costly than routine care ($1,264,000 ± $118,000 vs $1,361,000 
± $107,000) for the average 20-year-old. Aggressive care remains significantly 
less costly until age 80, at which age it costs more than routine care. However, 
even in the 80-year-old, aggressive care is likely the more cost-effective 
approach. Comfort care is associated with poorer outcomes at all ages and with 
higher costs for all groups except 80-year-olds.
CONCLUSIONS: When all the costs of severe TBI are considered, aggressive 
treatment is a cost-effective option, even for older patients. Comfort care for 
severe TBI is associated with poor outcomes and high costs, and should be 
reserved for situations in which aggressive approaches have failed or testing 
suggests such treatment is futile.

Hungary health system review.

Gaal P(1), Szigeti S, Csere M, Gaskins M, Panteli D.

Hungary has achieved a successful transition from an overly centralized, 
integrated Semashko-style health care system to a purchaser provider split model 
with output-based payment methods. Although there have been substantial 
increases in life expectancy in recent years among both men and women, many 
health outcomes remain poor, placing Hungary among the countries with the worst 
health status and highest rate of avoidable mortality in the EU (life expectancy 
at birth trailed the EU27 average by 5.1 years in 2009). Lifestyle factors 
especially the traditionally unhealthy Hungarian diet, alcohol consumption and 
smoking play a very important role in shaping the overall health of the 
population.In the single-payer system, the recurrent expenditure on health 
services is funded primarily through compulsory, non-risk-related contributions 
made by eligible individuals or from the state budget. The central government 
has almost exclusive power to formulate strategic direction and to issue and 
enforce regulations regarding health care. In 2009 Hungary spent 7.4% of its 
gross domestic product (GDP) on health, with public expenditure accounting for 
69.7% of total health spending, and with health expenditure per capita ranking 
slightly above the average for the new EU Member States, but considerably below 
the average for the EU27 in 2008. Health spending has been unstable over the 
years, with several waves of increases followed by longer periods of 
cost-containment and budget cuts. The share of total health expenditure 
attributable to private sources has been increasing, most of it accounted for by 
out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses. A substantial share of the latter can be 
attributed to informal payments, which are a deeply rooted characteristic of the 
Hungarian health system and a source of inefficiency and inequity. Voluntary 
health insurance, on the other hand, amounted to only 7.4% of private and 2.7% 
of total health expenditure in 2009. Revenue sources for health have been 
diversified over the past 15 years, but the current mix has yet to be tested for 
sustainability. The fit between existing capacities and the health care needs of 
the population remains less than ideal, but improvements have been made over the 
past 15 years. In general, the average length of stay and hospital admission 
rates have decreased since 1990, as have bed occupancy rates. However, capacity 
for long-term nursing care in both the inpatient and outpatient setting is still 
considered insufficient. Hungary is currently also facing a health workforce 
crisis, explained by the fact that it is a net donor country with regard to 
health care worker migration, and health care professionals on the whole are 
ageing. Although the overall technical efficiency of the system has increased 
considerably, mainly due to the introduction of output-based payment systems, 
allocative efficiency remains a problem. Considerable variations exist in 
service delivery both geographically and by specialization, and equity of access 
is far from being realized, a fact which is mirrored in differing health 
outcomes for different population groups. A key problem is the continuing lack 
of an overarching, evidence-based strategy for mobilizing resources for health, 
which leaves the health system vulnerable to broader economic policy objectives
