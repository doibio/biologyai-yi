BACKGROUND: The disparities in health and life expectancy of Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander peoples compared to non-Indigenous Australians are well 
documented. Chronic diseases are a leading contributor to these disparities. We 
aimed to determine the feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness of a case 
management approach to chronic disease care integrated within an urban 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary health care service.
METHODS: The Home-based, Outreach case Management of chronic disease Exploratory 
(HOME) Study provided holistic, patient centred multidisciplinary care for 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with chronic disease. A 
developmental evaluation approach supported the implementation and ongoing 
adaptations in the delivery of the model of care, and ensured its alignment with 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' understandings of, and approaches 
to, health and wellbeing. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted 
with nine patient participants (one interview also included a participant's 
spouse) and 15 health service staff and key themes were identified through an 
iterative reflective process. Quantitative data were collected directly from 
patient participants and from their medical records at baseline, 3 and 6 months. 
Patient participants' baseline characteristics were described using frequencies 
and percentages. Attrition and patterns of missing values over time were 
evaluated using binomial generalized estimating equation (GEE) models and mean 
differences in key clinical outcomes were determined using normal GEE models.
RESULTS: Forty-one patients were recruited and nine withdrew over the 6 month 
period. There was no evidence of differential attrition. All participants 
(patients and health service staff) were very positive about the model of care. 
Patient participants became more involved in their health care, depression rates 
significantly decreased (p = 0.03), and significant improvements in systolic 
blood pressure (p < 0.001) and diabetes control (p = 0.05) were achieved.
CONCLUSIONS: The exploratory nature of our study preclude any definitive 
statements about the effectiveness of our model of care. However, staff and 
patients' high levels of satisfaction and improvements in the health and 
wellbeing of patients are promising and suggest its feasibility, acceptability 
and appropriateness. Further research is required to determine its efficacy, 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in improving the quality of life and 
quality of care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples living with 
chronic disease.

POC CD4 Testing Improves Linkage to HIV Care and Timeliness of ART Initiation in 
a Public Health Approach: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

BACKGROUND: CD4 cell count is an important test in HIV programs for baseline 
risk assessment, monitoring of ART where viral load is not available, and, in 
many settings, antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation decisions. However, 
access to CD4 testing is limited, in part due to the centralized conventional 
laboratory network. Point of care (POC) CD4 testing has the potential to address 
some of the challenges of centralized CD4 testing and delays in delivery of 
timely testing and ART initiation. We conducted a systematic review and 
meta-analysis to identify the extent to which POC improves linkages to HIV care 
and timeliness of ART initiation.
METHODS: We searched two databases and four conference sites between January 
2005 and April 2015 for studies reporting test turnaround times, proportion of 
results returned, and retention associated with the use of point-of-care CD4. 
Random effects models were used to estimate pooled risk ratios, pooled 
proportions, and 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: We identified 30 eligible studies, most of which were completed in 
Africa. Test turnaround times were reduced with the use of POC CD4. The time 
from HIV diagnosis to CD4 test was reduced from 10.5 days with conventional 
laboratory-based testing to 0.1 days with POC CD4 testing. Retention along 
several steps of the treatment initiation cascade was significantly higher with 
POC CD4 testing, notably from HIV testing to CD4 testing, receipt of results, 
and pre-CD4 test retention (all p<0.001). Furthermore, retention between CD4 
testing and ART initiation increased with POC CD4 testing compared to 
conventional laboratory-based testing (p = 0.01). We also carried out a 
non-systematic review of the literature observing that POC CD4 increased the 
projected life expectancy, was cost-effective, and acceptable.
CONCLUSIONS: POC CD4 technologies reduce the time and increase patient retention 
along the testing and treatment cascade compared to conventional 
laboratory-based testing. POC CD4 is, therefore, a useful tool to perform CD4 
testing and expedite result delivery.

Comparison of Functional Outcome and Quality of Life in Patients With Idiopathic 
Scoliosis Treated by Spinal Fusion.

Road, Guangzhou, China.

Longer spinal fusions have been shown to result in improved deformity 
correction; however, loss of normal flexibility in the fusion area should not be 
ignored. Current consensus was to achieve a shorter fusion in primary surgery, 
with the goal of preserving as much of the distal motion segment as possible. 
However, the correlation between the length of fusion and functional outcome 
remains controversial. To the best of our knowledge, a previous study has 
demonstrated the function outcomes and the differences in HRQoL with specific 
fusion levels.In this cross-sectional study, 172 patients (mean age, 17.8 y) 
with idiopathic scoliosis treated by spinal fusion (mean time since surgery, 
29.7 mo) were included to measure lumbar spine mobility and quality of life 
using validated outcome instruments in the study population. Patients were 
assigned to 5 groups according to the lower instrumented vertebra (LIV) level: 
group A (fusion above L2) 26 patients; group B (fusion to L2) 21 patients; group 
C (fusion to L3) 46 patients; group D (fusion to L4) 53 patients; and group E 
(fusion to L5) 26 patients. At each follow-up, patients were asked to complete 
the Scoliosis Research Society 22 (SRS-22) Questionnaire. Lumbar mobility was 
assessed using a dual digital inclinometer.Average spinal range of motion (ROM) 
was 41.4 degrees (SD, 20.7), forward flexion was 29.2 degrees (SD, 15.0), and 
backward extension was 12.2 degrees (SD, 9.5). The total spinal range of motion 
and forward flexion dropped noticeably as the LIV got more distal. Statistically 
significant between-group differences (1-way ANOVA) were found for ROM 
(P < 0.001), forward flexion (P < 0.001), or backward extension (P < 0.001). The 
motion segments preserved significantly correlated with ROM (r = 0.76, 
P < 0.001), ROMF (r = 0.76, P < 0.001), and ROME (r = 0.39, P < 0.001). However, 
no significant between-group differences was found for each domain of SRS-22 
questionnaire.The motion segments preserved strongly correlated with lumbar 
mobility. Less fusion levels can preserve better lumbar flexibility by keeping 
more motion segments.

Although cancer is the second leading cause of death among persons 65 years and 
older, there is a paucity of clinical trial data about the effectiveness and 
harms of cancer screening in this population. Given the heterogeneous nature of 
the older population, cancer screening in these patients should not be based on 
age alone. Studies suggest that a life expectancy of at least 10 years is 
necessary to derive a survival benefit from screening for breast and colorectal 
cancers; therefore, screening for these cancers is not recommended in those with 
a life expectancy of less than 10 years. Prostate cancer screening, if performed 
at all, should not be performed after 69 years of age. Cervical cancer screening 
may be stopped after 65 years of age if the patient has an adequate history of 
negative screening results. An individualized approach to cancer screening 
decisions involves estimating life expectancy, determining the potential 
benefits and harms of screenings, and weighing those benefits and harms in 
relation to the patient's values and preferences.

BACKGROUND: There is strong concern about the costs associated with adding 
tumor-treating fields (TTF) therapy to standard first-line treatment for 
glioblastoma (GBM). Hence, we aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of TTF 
therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed patients with GBM.
METHODS: We developed a 3-health-state Markov model. The perspective was that of 
the French Health Insurance, and the horizon was lifetime. We calculated the 
transition probabilities from the survival parameters reported in the EF-14 
trial. The main outcome measure was incremental effectiveness expressed as 
life-years gained (LYG). Input costs were derived from the literature. We 
calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as 
cost/LYG. We used 1-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to 
evaluate the model uncertainty.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, adding TTF therapy to standard of care 
resulted in increases of life expectancy of 4.08 months (0.34 LYG) and €185 476 
per patient. The ICER was €549 909/LYG. The discounted ICER was €596 411/LYG. 
Parameters with the most influence on ICER were the cost of TTF therapy, 
followed equally by overall survival and progression-free survival in both arms. 
The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed a 95% confidence interval of the 
ICER of €447 017/LYG to €745 805/LYG with 0% chance to be cost-effective at a 
threshold of €100 000/LYG.
CONCLUSION: The ICER of TTF therapy at first-line treatment is far beyond 
conventional thresholds due to the prohibitive announced cost of the device. 
Strong price regulation by health authorities could make this technology more 
affordable and consequently accessible to patients.

BACKGROUND: The short form 36 (SF36) questionnaire is used for assessment of 
generic quality of life. Responses to the individual question in SF36 are also 
used for calculation of the SF6D index score. This score is used for calculation 
of quality adjusted-life years (QALYs) in economical analyses. As the individual 
patient questionnaires are not always available for performing systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses, a new formula has been developed for derivation of 
SF6D index score from the reported SF36-domain scores. This study aimed to 
evaluate the validity of this formula for use in patients with intermittent 
claudication.
METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of a 
randomized controlled trial was performed. A total of 178 patients were 
recruited. Clinical indicators of ischemia were recorded. All patients completed 
SF36 questionnaires. Response and domain-based SF6D scores (R-SF6D and D-SF6D) 
and QALYs were calculated. Correlation and agreement analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Response rate was 88% (n = 781) over a 1-year follow-up period. 
Domain-based SF6D score (mean, 0.684; standard deviation [SD] 0.110) was 
significantly higher (paired t-test, P = 0.001) than the response-based score 
(mean, 0.627; SD, 0.110) with a mean difference of 0.056 (95% confidence 
interval, 0.053-0.060). Mean QALY calculated using D-SF6D score (0.503; SD, 
0.116) was also significantly higher than the QALY calculated from the R-SF6D 
score (0.467; SD, 0.121). Bland-Altman comparison showed strong agreement (limit 
of agreement -0.167 to 0.054) between the 2 methods with equal variances 
(Pitman's test, P = 0.629). D-SF6D scores showed stronger correlation with 
clinical indicators of ischemia (r = 0.246-0.602) compared with that of R-SF6D 
scores (r = 0.233-0.549).
CONCLUSIONS: Domain-based estimation of SF6D score is a valid and reliable 
method with strong agreement to the gold standard response-based scores in 
claudicants. However, adjustments may be required in studies using a mixture of 
D-SF6D and R-SF6D scores for QALY calculation.

Social factors and cardiovascular morbidity.

Electronic address: e.brunner@ucl.ac.uk.

Recent progress in population health at aggregate level, measured by life 
expectancy, has been accompanied by lack of progress in reducing the difference 
in health prospects between groups defined by social status. Cardiovascular 
disease is an important contributor to this undesirable situation. The stepwise 
gradient of higher risk with lower status is accounted for partly by social 
gradients in health behaviors. The psychosocial hypothesis provides a stronger 
explanation, based on social patterning of living and working environments and 
psychological assets that individuals develop during childhood. Three decades of 
research based on Whitehall II and other cohort studies provide evidence for 
psychosocial pathways leading to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Job 
stress is a useful paradigm because exposure is long term and depends on 
occupational status. Studies of social-biological translation implicate 
autonomic and neuroendocrine function among the biological systems that mediate 
between chronic adverse psychosocial exposures and increased cardiometabolic 
risk and cardiovascular disease incidence.

BACKGROUND: The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma sets national 
targets for the accuracy of field trauma triage at ≥95% sensitivity and ≥65% 
specificity, yet the cost-effectiveness of realizing these goals is unknown. We 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of current field trauma triage practices 
compared with triage strategies consistent with the national targets.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a cost-effectiveness analysis using data from 79,937 
injured adults transported by 48 emergency medical services agencies to 105 
trauma and nontrauma hospitals in 6 regions of the western United States from 
2006 through 2008. Incremental differences in survival, quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (costs per 
QALY gained) were estimated for each triage strategy during a 1-year and 
lifetime horizon using a decision analytic Markov model. We considered an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold of <$100,000 to be 
cost-effective.
RESULTS: For these 6 regions, a high-sensitivity triage strategy consistent with 
national trauma policy (sensitivity 98.6%, specificity 17.1%) would cost 
$1,317,333 per QALY gained, and current triage practices (sensitivity 87.2%, 
specificity 64.0%) cost $88,000 per QALY gained, compared with a moderate 
sensitivity strategy (sensitivity 71.2%, specificity 66.5%). Refining emergency 
medical services transport patterns by triage status improved 
cost-effectiveness. At the trauma-system level, a high-sensitivity triage 
strategy would save 3.7 additional lives per year at a 1-year cost of $8.78 
million, and a moderate sensitivity approach would cost 5.2 additional lives and 
save $781,616 each year.
CONCLUSIONS: A high-sensitivity approach to field triage consistent with 
national trauma policy is not cost-effective. The most cost-effective approach 
to field triage appears closely tied to triage specificity and adherence to 
triage-based emergency medical services transport practices.

Dental development in living and fossil orangutans.

Smith TM(1).

Author information:

Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02138, United States. Electronic address: 
tsmith@fas.harvard.edu.

Numerous studies have investigated molar development in extant and fossil 
hominoids, yet relatively little is known about orangutans, the only great ape 
with an extensive fossil record. This study characterizes aspects of dental 
development, including cuspal enamel daily secretion rate, long-period line 
periodicities, cusp-specific molar crown formation times and extension rates, 
and initiation and completion ages in living and fossil orangutan postcanine 
teeth. Daily secretion rate and periodicities in living orangutans are similar 
to previous reports, while crown formation times often exceed published values, 
although direct comparisons are limited. One wild Bornean individual died at 4.5 
years of age with fully erupted first molars (M1s), while a captive individual 
and a wild Sumatran individual likely erupted their M1s around five or six years 
of age. These data underscore the need for additional samples of orangutans of 
known sex, species, and developmental environment to explore potential sources 
of variation in molar emergence and their relationship to life history 
variables. Fossil orangutans possess larger crowns than living orangutans, show 
similarities in periodicities, and have faster daily secretion rate, longer 
crown formation times, and slower extension rates. Molar crown formation times 
exceed reported values for other fossil apes, including Gigantopithecus blacki. 
When compared to African apes, both living and fossil orangutans show greater 
cuspal enamel thickness values and periodicities, resulting in longer crown 
formation times and slower extension rates. Several of these variables are 
similar to modern humans, representing examples of convergent evolution. Molar 
crown formation does not appear to be equivalent among extant great apes or 
consistent within living and fossil members of Pongo or Homo.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the HIV/AIDS burden in Iran from 1980 to 2010 using the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010).
METHODS: The burden of HIV/AIDS in Iran was obtained from a systematic study 
from 1990 to 2010 by the GBD team. The GBD 2010 disability weights were used to 
calculate the HIV/AIDS Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) based on the HIV 
prevalence reported by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 
estimation. Mortality data were obtained from the vital registration and 
statistics system of Iran. In the current study, the results are discussed, and 
the potential solutions are provided for observed deficiencies.
RESULTS: HIV/AIDS-related DALYs (3.6 per 100,000 in 1990, and 154 per 100,000 in 
2010) and death (0.07 per 100,000 in 1990, and 3 per 100,000 in 2010) had 
increased in Iran from 1990 to 2010. The majority of individuals who died of HIV 
were between 15 to 49 years old. The estimated rank of HIV/AIDS burden compared 
with the burden of other leading disease was 152nd in 1990 and considerably 
increased to 37th in 2010 in Iran.
CONCLUSION: Since the majority of HIV/AIDS DALYs and deaths occur among young 
people, the burden of HIV/AIDS still remains high in Iran. Due to the 
limitations of the GBD study, National and Sub-National Burden of Diseases 
(NASBOD) study is being conducted in Iran to calculate the burden of diseases, 
including HIV/AIDS.

Psychosocial factors have significant potential to affect long-term outcomes of 
bariatric surgery, including emotional adjustment, adherence to the recommended 
postoperative lifestyle regimen, weight loss outcomes, and co-morbidity 
improvement and or resolution. Thus, it is recommended that bariatric behavioral 
health clinicians with specialized knowledge and experience be involved in the 
evaluation and care of patients both before and after surgery. The evaluating 
clinician plays a number of important roles in the multidisciplinary treatment 
of the bariatric patient. Central among these is the role of identifying factors 
that may pose challenges to optimal surgical outcome and providing 
recommendations to the patient and bariatric team on how to address these 
issues. This document outlines recommendations for the psychosocial evaluation 
of bariatric surgery patients, appropriate qualifications of those conducting 
these evaluations, communication of evaluation results and suggested treatment 
plan, and the extension of behavioral healthcare of the bariatric patient to the 
entire span of the surgical and postsurgical process.

Targeted therapies in connective tissue diseases (CTDs) have led to improvements 
of disease-associated outcomes, but life expectancy remains lower compared to 
general population due to emerging co-morbidities, particularly due to excess 
cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a noninvasive 
imaging technique which can provide detailed information about multiple 
cardiovascular pathologies without using ionizing radiation. CMR is considered 
the reference standard for quantitative evaluation of left and right ventricular 
volumes, mass and function, cardiac tissue characterization and assessment of 
thoracic vessels; it may also be used for the quantitative assessment of 
myocardial blood flow with high spatial resolution and for the evaluation of the 
proximal coronary arteries. These applications are of particular interest in 
CTDs, because of the potential of serious and variable involvement of the 
cardiovascular system during their course. The International Consensus Group on 
CMR in Rheumatology was formed in January 2012 aiming to achieve consensus among 
CMR and rheumatology experts in developing initial recommendations on the 
current state-of-the-art use of CMR in CTDs. The present report outlines the 
recommendations of the participating CMR and rheumatology experts with regards 
to: (a) indications for use of CMR in rheumatoid arthritis, the 
spondyloarthropathies, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis of small, medium 
and large vessels, myositis, sarcoidosis (SRC), and scleroderma (SSc); (b) CMR 
protocols, terminology for reporting CMR and diagnostic CMR criteria for 
assessment and quantification of cardiovascular involvement in CTDs; and (c) a 
research agenda for the further development of this evolving field.

A-T is a prototype genome instability syndrome and a multifaceted disease. A-T 
leads to neurodegeneration - primarily cerebellar atrophy, immunodeficiency, 
oculocutaneous telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels), vestigial thymus and 
gonads, endocrine abnormalities, cancer predisposition and varying sensitivity 
to DNA damaging agents, particularly those that induce DNA double-strand breaks. 
With the recent increase in life expectancy of A-T patients, the premature 
ageing component of this disease is gaining greater awareness. The complex A-T 
phenotype reflects the ever growing number of functions assigned to the protein 
encoded by the responsible gene - the homeostatic protein kinase, ATM. The quest 
to thoroughly understand the complex A-T phenotype may reveal yet elusive ATM 
functions.

OBJECTIVE: To review the literature addressing the relationship of growth and 
nutritional parameters with pulmonary function in pediatric patients with cystic 
fibrosis.
DATA SOURCE: A collection of articles published in the last 15 years in English, 
Portuguese and Spanish was made by research in electronic databases - PubMed, 
Cochrane, Medline, Lilacs and Scielo - using the keywords cystic fibrosis, 
growth, nutrition, pulmonary function in varied combinations. Articles that 
addressed the long term association of growth and nutritional parameters, with 
an emphasis on growth, with pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis, were included, 
and we excluded those that addressing only the relationship between nutritional 
parameters and cystic fibrosis and those in which the aim was to describe the 
disease.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Seven studies were included, with a total of 12,455 patients. 
Six studies reported relationship between growth parameters and lung function, 
including one study addressing the association of growth parameters, solely, 
with lung function, and all the seven studies reported relationship between 
nutritional parameters and lung function.
CONCLUSIONS: The review suggests that the severity of the lung disease, 
determined by spirometry, is associated with body growth and nutritional status 
in cystic fibrosis. Thus, the intervention in these parameters can lead to the 
better prognosis and life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients.

OBJETIVO: Revisar a literatura que aborda a relação entre os parâmetros de 
crescimento e nutricionais com a função pulmonar em pacientes pediátricos com 
fibrose cística.
FONTES DE DADOS: Dados foram coletados de artigos publicados nos últimos 15 anos 
em Inglês,Português e Espanhol através de pesquisa nas bases de dados 
eletrônicas - PubMed, Cochrane, Medline, Lilacs e Scielo - usando as 
palavras-chave: fibrose cística, crescimento, nutrição, função pulmonar 
utilizando combinações variadas. Os artigos que analisaram a associação de longo 
prazo entre parâmetros de crescimento e nutricionais, com ênfase em crescimento, 
com doença pulmonar em fibrose cística, foram incluídos, sendo excluídos aqueles 
que analisaram apenas a relação entre os parâmetros nutricionais e fibrose 
cística e aqueles em que o objetivo era descrever a doença.
SÍNTESE DOS DADOS: Sete estudos foram incluídos, com um total de 12.455 
pacientes. Seis relataram relação entre parâmetros de crescimento e função 
pulmonar, incluindo um estudo que analisou apenas a associação de parâmetros de 
crescimento com a função pulmonar, e todos os sete relataram associação entre 
parâmetros nutricionais e função pulmonar.
CONCLUSÕES: A revisão sugere que a gravidade da doença pulmonar, determinada por 
espirometria, está associada com crescimento corporal e o estado nutricional em 
fibrose cística. Assim, a intervenção nesses parâmetros pode contribuir para um 
melhor prognóstico e expectativa de vida em pacientes com fibrose cística.

The population health effect and cost-effectiveness of implementing intensive 
blood pressure goals in high-cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk adults have not 
been described. Using the CVD Policy Model, CVD events, treatment costs, 
quality-adjusted life years, and drug and monitoring costs were simulated over 
2016 to 2026 for hypertensive patients aged 35 to 74 years. We projected the 
effectiveness and costs of hypertension treatment according to the 2003 Joint 
National Committee (JNC)-7 or 2014 JNC8 guidelines, and then for adults aged ≥50 
years, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding an intensive goal of 
systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg for patients with CVD, chronic kidney 
disease, or 10-year CVD risk ≥15%. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
<$50 000 per quality-adjusted life years gained were considered cost-effective. 
JNC7 strategies treat more patients and are more costly to implement compared 
with JNC8 strategies. Adding intensive systolic blood pressure goals for 
high-risk patients prevents an estimated 43 000 and 35 000 annual CVD events 
incremental to JNC8 and JNC7, respectively. Intensive strategies save costs in 
men and are cost-effective in women compared with JNC8 alone. At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per quality-adjusted life years gained, 
JNC8+intensive had the highest probability of cost-effectiveness in women (82%) 
and JNC7+intensive the highest probability of cost-effectiveness in men (100%). 
Assuming higher drug and monitoring costs, adding intensive goals for high-risk 
patients remained consistently cost-effective in men, but not always in women. 
Among patients aged 35 to 74 years, adding intensive blood pressure goals for 
high-risk groups to current national hypertension treatment guidelines prevents 
additional CVD deaths while saving costs provided that medication costs are 
controlled.

Asymmetry of Force Fluctuation During Low Intensity Isometric Contraction in Leg 
Muscle.

Oshita K(1), Yano S(1).

and Environment, Kobe University, Kobe, JAPAN.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the asymmetry of force fluctuation 
in the leg muscles during isometric knee extension and flexion. Twenty healthy 
males (21±2 years) performed the maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) 
in knee extensor and flexor. On the basis of MVC measurement, the subjects 
performed sustained isometric knee extension and flexion for 15s at levels 
corresponding to 10%, 20% and 30% MVC. The main findings of this study were: (1) 
a greater force fluctuation was found in the stronger MVC limb than in the 
weaker MVC limb at 30% MVC; (2) no difference was found in the force fluctuation 
between the stronger and weaker MVC limbs at 10% and 20% MVC; and (3) 
significant positive correlations were found between the target force values and 
the force fluctuation at each contraction intensity. These results suggest that: 
(1) asymmetry of force fluctuation increases with load, (2) asymmetry of the 
force fluctuation is observed at more than 30% MVC intensity; and (3) if the 
contraction intensity is same relatively loads (% MVC), force fluctuation is 
increase with absolute load (target force value). Force fluctuation influence 
the functional ability of an individual in controlling finger or limb movements 
in daily life. Further, asymmetry of force fluctuation might influence for more 
than 30% MVC of daily activities.

Inpatient Utilization and Costs for Medicare Fee-for-Service Beneficiaries with 
Heart Failure.

BACKGROUND: Although the medical and economic burden of heart failure in the 
United States is already substantial, it will likely grow as the population ages 
and life expectancy increases. Not surprisingly, most of the heart failure 
burden is borne by individuals aged ≥65 years, many of whom are in the Medicare 
population. The population-based utilization and costs of inpatient care for 
Medicare beneficiaries with heart failure are not well understood by payers and 
providers.
OBJECTIVE: To create a real-world view of utilization and costs associated with 
inpatient admissions, readmissions, and admissions to skilled nursing facilities 
among Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries with heart failure.
METHODS: The study used the 2011 and 2012 Medicare 5% sample limited data set to 
perform a retrospective analysis of claims data. The look-back year that was 
used to identify certain patient characteristics was 2011, and 2012 was the 
analysis period for the study. Beneficiaries with heart failure were defined as 
those who had ≥1 acute inpatient, emergency department, nonacute inpatient, or 
outpatient claims in 2012 containing an International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision code for heart failure. To be included in the study, 
beneficiaries with heart failure had to have eligibility for ≥1 months in 2012 
and in all 2011 months, with Part A and Part B eligibility in all the study 
months, and no enrollment in an HMO (Medicare Advantage plan). Utilization of 
inpatient admissions, inpatient readmissions, and skilled nursing facility 
admissions in 2012 were reported for Medicare FFS beneficiaries with heart 
failure and for all Medicare FFS beneficiaries. The costs for key metrics 
included all allowed Medicare payments in 2012 US dollars.
RESULTS: The 2012 Medicare FFS population for this study consisted of 1,461,935 
patients (1,301,545 without heart failure; 160,390 with heart failure); the 
heart failure prevalence was 11%. The Medicare-allowed cost per member per month 
(PMPM) was $3395 for a patient with heart failure, whereas the allowed cost for 
the total Medicare population was $1045 PMPM. The Medicare-allowed amounts for 
the population with heart failure accounted for 34% of the total annual Medicare 
FFS population-allowed amounts. The heart failure population constituted 41.5%, 
55.3%, and 49.5% of total Medicare FFS inpatient admissions, readmissions, and 
admissions to skilled nursing facilities, respectively. The costs of inpatient 
admissions, readmissions, and admissions to skilled nursing facilities among the 
heart failure population contributed $182 PMPM (17.5%), $58 PMPM (5.6%), and $46 
PMPM (4.4%), respectively, to the total Medicare FFS population-allowed cost of 
$1045 PMPM.
CONCLUSIONS: Medicare FFS beneficiaries with heart failure have high inpatient 
admission and readmission rates and generate substantial costs. Because a 
substantial portion of all inpatient admissions are for Medicare beneficiaries 
with heart failure, it is reasonable for hospitals in Medicare accountable care 
organizations to focus on more aggressive post-acute care management, including 
a focus on reducing readmissions for the population with heart failure. Our 
study findings highlight areas of high service utilization and cost for Medicare 
patients with heart failure that can be of value to Medicare, Medicare Advantage 
plans, and providers.

Telomerase Repeated Amplification Protocol (TRAP).

Mender I(1), Shay JW(2).

Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Telomeres are found at the end of eukaryotic linear chromosomes, and proteins 
that bind to telomeres protect DNA from being recognized as double-strand breaks 
thus preventing end-to-end fusions (Griffith et al., 1999). However, due to the 
end replication problem and other factors such as oxidative damage, the limited 
life span of cultured cells (Hayflick limit) results in progressive shortening 
of these protective structures (Hayflick and Moorhead, 1961; Olovnikov, 1973). 
The ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex telomerase-consisting of a protein 
catalytic component hTERT and a functional RNA component hTR or hTERC- 
counteracts telomere shortening by adding telomeric repeats to the end of 
chromosomes in ~90% of primary human tumors and in some transiently 
proliferating stem-like cells (Shay and Wright, 1996; Shay and Wright, 2001). 
This results in continuous proliferation of cells which is a hallmark of cancer. 
Therefore, telomere biology has a central role in aging, cancer 
progression/metastasis as well as targeted cancer therapies. There are commonly 
used methods in telomere biology such as Telomere Restriction Fragment (TRF) 
(Mender and Shay, 2015b), Telomere Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) and 
Telomere dysfunction Induced Foci (TIF) analysis (Mender and Shay, 2015a). In 
this detailed protocol we describe Telomere Repeat Amplification Protocol 
(TRAP). The TRAP assay is a popular method to determine telomerase activity in 
mammalian cells and tissue samples (Kim et al., 1994). The TRAP assay includes 
three steps: extension, amplification, and detection of telomerase products. In 
the extension step, telomeric repeats are added to the telomerase substrate 
(which is actually a non telomeric oligonucleotide, TS) by telomerase. In the 
amplification step, the extension products are amplified by the polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) using specific primers (TS upstream primer and ACX downstream 
primer) and in the detection step, the presence or absence of telomerase is 
analyzed by electrophoresis. TSNT is, an internal standard control, amplified by 
TS primer. NT is its own reverse primer, which is not a substrate for 
telomerase. These primers are used to identify false-negative results by if the 
gel lacks internal control bands.

Politics and population health: Testing the impact of electoral democracy.

This study addresses questions of whether and why electoral democracies have 
better health than other nations. After devising a replicable approach to 
missing data, we compare political, economic, and health-related data for 168 
nations collected annually from 1960 through 2010. Regression models estimate 
that electoral democracies have 11 years of longer life expectancy on average 
and 62.5% lower rates of infant mortality. The association with life expectancy 
reduces markedly after controlling for GDP, while a combination of factors may 
explain the democratic advantage in infant health. Results suggest that income 
inequality associates independently with both health outcomes but does not 
mediate their associations with democracy.
