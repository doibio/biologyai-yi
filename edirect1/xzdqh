BACKGROUND: BReast CAncer (BRCA) genes are extensively studied in the context of 
fertility and reproductive aging. BRCA proteins are part of the DNA repair 
Fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA pathway, in which more than 20 proteins are implicated. 
According to which gene is mutated and which interactions are lost owing to the 
mutation, carriers and patients with monoallelic or biallelic FA/BRCA mutations 
exhibit very different phenotypes, from overt FA to cancer predisposition or no 
pathological implications. The effect of the so far neglected non-BRCA FA 
mutations on fertility also deserves consideration.
OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: As improved treatments allow a longer life expectancy 
in patients with biallelic FA mutations and overt FA, infertility is emerging as 
a predominant feature. We thus reviewed the mechanisms for such a manifestation, 
as well as whether they also occur in monoallelic carriers of FA non-BRCA 
mutations.
SEARCH METHODS: Electronic databases PUBMED, EMBASE and CENTRAL were searched 
using the following term: 'fanconi' OR 'FANC' OR 'AND' 'fertility' OR 
'pregnancy' OR 'ovarian reserve' OR 'spermatogenesis' OR 'hypogonadism'. All 
pertinent reports in the English-language literature were retrieved until May 
2021 and the reference lists were systematically searched in order to identify 
any potential additional studies.
OUTCOMES: Biallelic FA mutations causing overt FA disease are associated with 
premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) occurring in the fourth decade in women 
and with primary non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) in men. Hypogonadism in FA 
patients seems mainly associated with a defect in primordial germ cell 
proliferation in fetal life. In recent small, exploratory whole-exome sequencing 
studies, biallelic clinically occult mutations in the FA complementation group A 
(Fanca) and M (Fancm) genes were found in otherwise healthy patients with 
isolated NOA or POI, and also monoallelic carrier status for a loss-of-function 
mutation in Fanca has been implicated as a possible cause for POI. In those 
patients with known monoallelic FA mutations undergoing pre-implantation genetic 
testing, poor assisted reproduction outcomes are reported. However, the 
mechanisms underlying the repeated failures and the high miscarriage rates 
observed are not fully known.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The so far 'neglected' members of the FA/BRCA family will 
likely emerge as a relevant focus of investigation in the genetics of 
reproduction. Several (rather than a single) non-BRCA genes might be implicated. 
State-of-the-art methods, such as whole-genome/exome sequencing, and further 
exploratory studies are required to understand the prevalence and mechanisms for 
occult FA mutations in infertility and recurrent miscarriage.

INTRODUCTION: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease that is 
characterized by smooth muscle-like cell growth in the lungs. The current 
available oral treatment rapamycin slows down the disease progression but does 
not result in a cure. Rapamycin is also limited by its low bioavailability and 
dose-related adverse side effects. New treatments are, therefore, underway to 
investigate alternative targets and combination therapies for LAM. In recent 
years, much focus has been on the development of therapies based on inhaled 
nanotechnology using carriers to deliver drugs, as it is shown to improve drug 
solubility, local targeted treatment, and bioavailability.
AREAS COVERED: This review, therefore, focuses on future prospective treatments 
for LAM using nanoparticles and lipid-based nanocarriers, including liposomes, 
solid lipid nanoparticles, micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles. It also 
investigates how nanoparticles' physicochemical factors such as size and charge 
can affect the treatment of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary LAM.
EXPERT OPINION: Advanced clinical research is still needed to demonstrate the 
full potential and drive future commercialization of LAM treatments delivered 
via inhaled lipid nanobased formulations. If successful, the resultant effects 
will be seen in the improvement in the life expectancy and life quality of LAM 
patients.

Association of historic redlining and present-day health in Baltimore.

Huang SJ(1), Sehgal NJ(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Health Policy and Management, University of Maryland School of 
Public Health, College Park, Maryland, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: In the 1930s, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation categorized 
neighborhoods by investment grade along racially discriminatory lines, a process 
known as redlining. Although other authors have found associations between Home 
Owners' Loan Corporation categories and current impacts on racial segregation, 
analysis of current health impacts rarely use these maps.
OBJECTIVE: To study whether historical redlining in Baltimore is associated with 
health impacts today.
APPROACH: Fifty-four present-day planning board-defined community statistical 
areas are assigned historical Home Owners' Loan Corporation categories by area 
predominance. Categories are red ("hazardous"), yellow ("definitely declining") 
with blue/green ("still desirable"/"best") as the reference category. Community 
statistical area life expectancy is regressed against Home Owners' Loan 
Corporation category, controlling for median household income and proportion of 
African American residents.
CONCLUSION: Red categorization is associated with 4.01 year reduction (95% CI: 
1.47, 6.55) and yellow categorization is associated with 5.36 year reduction 
(95% CI: 3.02, 7.69) in community statistical area life expectancy at baseline. 
When controlling for median household income and proportion of African American 
residents, red is associated with 5.23 year reduction (95% CI: 3.49, 6.98) and 
yellow with 4.93 year reduction (95% CI: 3.22, 6.23). Results add support that 
historical redlining is associated with health today.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy has proliferated the number of 
elderly and subsequently increased the prevalence of disability among the 
elderly. This study assesses the prevalence of Activity of Daily Living (ADL) 
and Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) and analyzes determinants of 
ADL and IADL among elderly aged 60 and over living in India.
METHODS: The study utilized the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI, 
2017-18) data, and information was sought from 31,464 elderly aged 60 years and 
above. An index of ADL and IADL was created on a scale of three levels, 
exhibiting no, moderate, or severe levels of ADL/IADL disability. Multinomial 
logistic regression was used to determine the effect of socio-demographic 
parameters on ADL and IADL disability among the elderly.
RESULTS: Around 3% of the elderly reported severe ADL disability, and 6% elderly 
reported severe IADL disability. Elderly who were not involved in any physical 
activity than their counterparts were more likely to report severe ADL 
(RRR = 2.68, C.I. = 1.66-4.32) and severe IADL (RRR = 2.70, C.I. = 1.98-3.67) 
than no ADL and no IADL, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Amidst the study finding, the study emphasizes the importance of 
setting-up of geriatric care centers in rural and urban areas. It would be 
feasible to provide geriatric care under the umbrella of already functioning 
government health facilities in different parts of the country. Community 
interventions earmarking the elderly with a focus on physical activity, 
specifically based in group physical exercise and implemented through existing 
networks, are rewarding for the elderly.

'Not birth, marriage or death, but gastrulation': the life of a quotation in 
biology.

Hopwood N(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge.

This history of a statement attributed to the developmental biologist Lewis 
Wolpert exemplifies the making and uses of quotations in recent science. 
Wolpert's dictum, 'It is not birth, marriage or death, but gastrulation which is 
truly the most important time in your life', was produced in a series of 
international shifts of medium and scale. It originated in his vivid declaration 
in conversation with a non-specialist at a workshop dinner, gained its canonical 
form in a colleague's monograph, and was amplified as a quotation on a poster 
derived from an undergraduate project. Although it drew on Wolpert's authority 
and he accepted his authorship, it thus represents a collective sifting of 
earlier claims for the significance of prenatal existence through the values of 
1980s developmental biology. Juxtaposing a technical term with major life events 
has let teachers engage students, and researchers entice journalists, while 
sharing an in-joke that came to mark community identity. Serious applications 
include arguing for an extension of the fourteen-day limit on human-embryo 
research. On this evidence, quotations have been kept busy addressing every 
audience of specialized knowledge.

The use of biologics in the treatment of numerous diseases has increased 
steadily over the past decade due to their high specificities, low toxicity, and 
limited side effects. Despite this success, peptide- and protein-based drugs are 
limited by short half-lives and immunogenicity. To address these challenges, we 
use a genomically recoded organism to produce genetically encoded elastin-like 
polypeptide-protein fusions containing multiple instances of 
para-azidophenylalanine (pAzF). Precise lipidation of these pAzF residues 
generated a set of sequence-defined synthetic biopolymers with programmable 
binding affinity to albumin without ablating the activity of model fusion 
proteins, and with tunable blood serum half-lives spanning 5 to 94% of albumin's 
half-life in a mouse model. Our findings present a proof of concept for the use 
of genetically encoded bioorthogonal conjugation sites for multisite lipidation 
to tune protein stability in mouse serum. This work establishes a programmable 
approach to extend and tune the half-life of protein or peptide therapeutics and 
a technical foundation to produce functionalized biopolymers endowed with 
programmable chemical and biophysical properties with broad applications in 
medicine, materials science, and biotechnology.

BACKGROUND: Over the last 30 years, South Africa has experienced four 'colliding 
epidemics' of HIV and tuberculosis, chronic illness and mental health, injury 
and violence, and maternal, neonatal, and child mortality, which have had 
substantial effects on health and well-being. Using data from the 2019 Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study (GBD 2019), we evaluated 
national and provincial health trends and progress towards important Sustainable 
Development Goal targets from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: We analysed GBD 2019 estimates of mortality, non-fatal health loss, 
summary health measures and risk factor burden, comparing trends over 1990-2007 
and 2007-2019. Additionally, we decomposed changes in life expectancy by cause 
of death and assessed healthcare system performance.
RESULTS: Across the nine provinces, inequalities in mortality and life 
expectancy increased over 1990-2007, largely due to differences in HIV/AIDS, 
then decreased over 2007-2019. Demographic change and increases in 
non-communicable diseases nearly doubled the number of years lived with 
disability between 1990 and 2019. From 1990 to 2019, risk factor burdens 
generally shifted from communicable and nutritional disease risks to 
non-communicable disease and injury risks; unsafe sex remained the top risk 
factor. Despite widespread improvements in healthcare system performance, the 
greatest gains were generally in economically advantaged provinces.
CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in HIV/AIDS and related conditions have led to improved 
health since 2007, though most provinces still lag in key areas. To achieve 
health targets, provincial governments should enhance health investments and 
exchange of knowledge, resources and best practices alongside populations that 
have been left behind, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is a major public health problem and is the second leading 
cause of death around the world. The incidence rates of some cancer types rise 
dramatically with certain risk factors, a fact that is exemplified by the high 
susceptibility to lung cancer as a result of tobacco smoking. The frame of 
cancer as a preventable disease and the challenges of its treatment emphasize 
the need for specific risk preventive measures. Therefore, attempts are 
continuously carried out to provide a better understanding of the cancer 
incidence patterns and how the most common risk factors are implicated.
AIMS: This study aimed to compare the cancer incidence rates in Jordan, Lebanon, 
Palestine, Syria, and Iraq over 18 years (2000-2017) and relate the high 
estimates to certain risk factors to help decision-makers better prevent this 
disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Graphical and numerical descriptive illustrations of the 
total incidence rates, age-specific incidence rates, and incidence by cancer 
type were generated using data obtained from the Global Health Data exchange 
database. Risk factors prevalence and their pathogenic role were sought using 
PubMed and science direct databases as well as the world bank data.
RESULTS: Lebanon had the highest overall age-adjusted incidence rates with a 
gradual increase from 231 to 353 and the highest life expectancy mean of 77.5 
years. Breast, lung, and colorectal cancers were the most common cancer types in 
both genders and all ages in the five countries with varied ratios that were 
consistent with the risk factors prevalent.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between the spread of the studied risk factors and 
the high trends of the corresponding cancer types highlights the importance of 
targeted preventive measures and serve as a guide for evidence-based prevention 
strategies.

The liver is the major drug-metabolizing and drug-detoxifying organ. Many drugs 
can cause liver damage through various mechanisms; however, the liver response 
to injury includes a relatively narrow spectrum of alterations that, regardless 
of the cause, are represented by phlogosis, oxidative stress and necrosis. The 
combination of these alterations mainly results in three radiological findings: 
vascular alterations, structural changes and metabolic function reduction. 
Chemotherapy has changed in recent decades in terms of the drugs, protocols and 
duration, allowing patients a longer life expectancy. As a consequence, we are 
currently observing an increase in chemotherapy-associated liver injury patterns 
once considered unusual. Recognizing this form of damage in an early stage is 
crucial for reconsidering the therapy regimen and thus avoiding severe 
complications. In this frontier article, we analyze the role of imaging in 
detecting some of these pathological patterns, such as pseudocirrhosis, "yellow 
liver" due to chemotherapy-associated steatosis-steatohepatitis, and "blue 
liver", including sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, veno-occlusive disease and 
peliosis.

Background: Lifestyle Medicine (LM) aims to address six main behavioral domains: 
diet/nutrition, substance use (SU), physical activity (PA), social 
relationships, stress management, and sleep. Digital Health Interventions (DHIs) 
have been used to improve these domains. However, there is no consensus on how 
to measure lifestyle and its intermediate outcomes aside from measuring each 
behavior separately. We aimed to describe (1) the most frequent lifestyle 
domains addressed by DHIs, (2) the most frequent outcomes used to measure 
lifestyle changes, and (3) the most frequent DHI delivery methods. Methods: We 
followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA-ScR) Extension for Scoping Reviews. A literature search was conducted 
using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science for publications 
since 2010. We included systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials 
using DHI to promote health, behavioral, or lifestyle change. Results: Overall, 
954 records were identified, and 72 systematic reviews were included. Of those, 
35 conducted meta-analyses, 58 addressed diet/nutrition, and 60 focused on PA. 
Only one systematic review evaluated all six lifestyle domains simultaneously; 1 
systematic review evaluated five lifestyle domains; 5 systematic reviews 
evaluated 4 lifestyle domains; 14 systematic reviews evaluated 3 lifestyle 
domains; and the remaining 52 systematic reviews evaluated only one or two 
domains. The most frequently evaluated domains were diet/nutrition and PA. The 
most frequent DHI delivery methods were smartphone apps and websites. 
Discussion: The concept of lifestyle is still unclear and fragmented, making it 
hard to evaluate the complex interconnections of unhealthy behaviors, and their 
impact on health. Clarifying this concept, refining its operationalization, and 
defining the reporting guidelines should be considered as the current research 
priorities. DHIs have the potential to improve lifestyle at primary, secondary, 
and tertiary levels of prevention-but most of them are targeting clinical 
populations. Although important advances have been made to evaluate DHIs, some 
of their characteristics, such as the rate at which they become obsolete, will 
require innovative research designs to evaluate long-term outcomes in health.

As life expectancy increases, the population experiences progressive ageing. 
Ageing, in turn, is connected to an increase in bone-related diseases (i.e., 
osteoporosis and increased risk of fractures). Hence, the search for new 
approaches to study the occurrence of bone-related diseases and to develop new 
drugs for their prevention and treatment becomes more pressing. However, to 
date, a reliable in vitro model that can fully recapitulate the characteristics 
of bone tissue, either in physiological or altered conditions, is not available. 
Indeed, current methods for modelling normal and pathological bone are poor 
predictors of treatment outcomes in humans, as they fail to mimic the in vivo 
cellular microenvironment and tissue complexity. Bone, in fact, is a dynamic 
network including differently specialized cells and the extracellular matrix, 
constantly subjected to external and internal stimuli. To this regard, perfused 
vascularized models are a novel field of investigation that can offer a new 
technological approach to overcome the limitations of traditional cell culture 
methods. It allows the combination of perfusion, mechanical and biochemical 
stimuli, biological cues, biomaterials (mimicking the extracellular matrix of 
bone), and multiple cell types. This review will discuss macro, milli, and 
microscale perfused devices designed to model bone structure and 
microenvironment, focusing on the role of perfusion and encompassing different 
degrees of complexity. These devices are a very first, though promising, step 
for the development of 3D in vitro platforms for preclinical screening of novel 
anabolic or anti-catabolic therapeutic approaches to improve bone health.

'Superimposed miracles': an extremely rare case of a septuagenarian with an 
unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot: a case report.

BACKGROUND: Although the life expectancy of patients with tetralogy of Fallot 
(TOF) is comparable to that of the general population due to advancements in 
surgical intervention, if untreated, patients with TOF may die during their 
childhood. However, it has been anecdotally reported that a small number of 
patients with unrepaired TOF survived into their senescence.
CASE SUMMARY: A 71-year-old man with a history of multiple heart failure 
admissions was referred to our institute after successful cardiopulmonary arrest 
resuscitation. Transthoracic echocardiography showed the overriding of the aorta 
on a large ventricular septal defect and right ventricular hypertrophy, along 
with severe pulmonary stenosis (PS), all of which indicated unrepaired TOF. 
Computed tomography revealed a patent Blalock-Taussig shunt, which was 
constructed at the age of 19 years. Coronary angiography revealed multivessel 
coronary stenoses. Although radical intracardiac repair was not performed due to 
his multiple comorbidities, his heart failure symptoms were significantly 
improved owing to proper medication titration. One year following discharge, the 
patient was well and enjoyed playing golf.
DISCUSSION: Specific anatomical, functional, and haemodynamic characteristics 
may be required for the long-term survival of patients with TOF. Pulmonary 
stenosis should be initially mild to guarantee pulmonary flow during childhood 
and adolescence, and gradual PS exacerbation should be paralleled with 
systemic-to-pulmonary collateral development or an extracardiac shunt. Moreover, 
reduced left ventricular compliance may act as a balancing factor against a 
right-to-left shunt. The presence of all of these special requirements may have 
contributed to the unusual survival for this patient.

Inherited muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies present in early 
childhood with progressive muscle weakness, determining severe motor 
limitations. Active surveillance and management of associated complications have 
improved ambulation, function, quality of life and life expectancy. The need for 
repeatable, objective and quantitative measures to monitor the clinical course 
of the disease is a current issue, particularly in the new era where new flows 
of therapies are proposed to the patients. In this scenario, we designed and 
tested a wearable device termed AUTOMA that is able to provide quantification of 
the muscular impairment in the upper limb upon isokinetic tests through the 
integration of a force sensor and an electric goniometer. This allows 
qualitatively estimating the muscular functions with a systematic procedure. We 
carried out a preliminary pilot study on 9 patients that revealed the 
suitability of AUTOMA as an objective measurement tool for diagnosing and 
monitoring neuromuscular disorders, and opens to a more extensive clinical study 
in which to test and validate our platform intensively.

BACKGROUND: A Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) has shown a 
one-to-one male-to-female mortality ratio, notwithstanding the statistically 
longer life expectancy of women in the general population. This finding 
contrasts with the recent report that Japanese women on dialysis treatment have 
a more favorable longevity. Accordingly, we further investigated the clinical 
procedures and outcomes to clarify the sex differences in Japanese patients 
undergoing dialysis treatment.
METHODS: Subjects were incident dialysis patients who participated in a 
multicenter prospective cohort study from October 2011 to September 2013. The 
all-cause mortality was analyzed by a Cox proportional hazard regression model 
and studied separately in women and men with or without cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) at baseline.
RESULTS: Overall, 492 (32.3%) of the 1520 test subjects were women. All-cause 
mortality was higher in men (28.6%) than in women (19.9%, p < 0.001). Female sex 
(hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.90) and history 
of CVD (HR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.18-1.95) were independent predictors of all-cause 
mortality. In patients without CVD, female gender was strong independent 
contributor (HR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.30-0.70, p < 0.001). In contrast, patients 
with CVD showed no difference in survival between the sexes (HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 
0.67-1.24, p = 0.597).
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that women undergoing chronic dialysis 
therapy had a lower mortality risk than men. However, complication with CVD 
canceled out the survival advantage in Japanese women on chronic dialysis. We 
should reevaluate the risk of women with CVD undergoing dialysis and apply the 
optimal care for CVD.

OBJECTIVE: Emotion recognition is a fundamental neurocognitive capacity that is 
a critical predictor of interpersonal function and, in turn, mental health. 
Although people with Parkinson's disease (PD) often exhibit difficulties 
recognizing emotions, almost all studies to date have focused on basic emotions 
(happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust), with little 
consideration of how more cognitively complex self-conscious emotions such as 
contempt, embarrassment, and pride might also be affected. Further, the few 
studies that have considered self-conscious emotions have relied on high 
intensity, static stimuli. The aim of the present study was to therefore provide 
the first examination of how self-conscious emotion recognition is affected by 
PD using a dynamic, dual-intensity measure that more closely captures how 
emotion recognition judgements are made in daily life.
METHOD: People with PD (n = 42) and neurotypical controls (n = 42) completed a 
validated measure of self-conscious facial emotion recognition. For comparative 
purposes, in addition to a broader clinical test battery, both groups also 
completed a traditional static emotion recognition measure and a measure of 
self-conscious emotional experience.
RESULTS: Relative to controls, the PD group did not differ in their capacity to 
recognize basic emotions but were impaired in their recognition of 
self-conscious emotions. These difficulties were associated with elevated 
negative affect and poorer subjective well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: Difficulties recognizing self-conscious emotions may be more 
problematic for people with PD than difficulties recognizing basic ones, with 
implications for interventions focused on helping people with this disorder 
develop and maintain strong social networks.
PRACTITIONER POINTS: This is the first direct investigation into how the 
recognition of self-conscious emotion is affected in Parkinson's disease using 
dynamic, dual-intensity stimuli, thus providing an important extension to prior 
literature that has focused solely on basic emotion recognition and/or relied on 
static, high-intensity stimuli. Results revealed preserved basic facial 
emotional recognition coexisting with impairment in all three self-conscious 
emotions assessed, therefore suggesting that the latter stimuli type may 
function as a more sensitive indicator of Parkinson's disease-related social 
cognitive impairment. Problems with self-conscious emotion recognition in people 
with Parkinson's disease were associated with poorer broader subjective 
well-being and increased negative affect. This aligns with the broader 
literature linking interpersonal difficulties with poorer clinical outcomes in 
this cohort.

OBJECTIVE: Telehealth is rapidly gaining ground from usual treatment, not least 
because of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) measures. Within rheumatology, 
telehealth has been used for, inter alia, follow-up for patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) with low disease activity or in remission. This study aims to 
assess the cost-effectiveness of such a telehealth intervention.
METHOD: In a randomized controlled trial, 294 patients were randomized into 
patient-reported outcome-based telehealth follow-up by either a nurse (PRO-TN) 
or a rheumatologist (PRO-TR) or to conventional outpatient follow-up (control). 
Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using costs per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained. Individual-level healthcare and productivity costs were retrieved 
from national Danish registers. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 
calculated for the intervention groups compared to the control group. 
Bootstrapping with 10 000 replications was used to obtain confidence intervals. 
Furthermore, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated.
RESULTS: The cost comparison showed that PRO-TR was significantly less costly 
than the control group, whereas the relative reduction in costs for PRO-TN was 
not significant. The telehealth groups experienced minor, non-significant 
declines in QALYs, whereas the control group experienced a slight, 
non-significant increase. The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that for 
PRO-TR, the willingness to accept a QALY loss was 89 328 EUR. A similar but 
smaller and non-significant result was seen for PRO-TN.
CONCLUSION: PRO-TR and PRO-TN seem to cost less but provide broadly similar 
health outcomes compared with conventional follow-up. Between the intervention 
groups, PRO-TR was significantly less costly. More studies are needed to 
conclude whether rheumatologist- or nurse-led telehealth is more cost-effective 
than conventional follow-up.

'Well, what do You Want to do?' A Case Study of Community Palliative Care 
Programme: 'Heidi's Have a Go'.

Victoria, Australia.

The demand for palliative care has increased in high income countries as 
mortality in older adults has decreased and life expectancy increased. In this 
context, the priorities of palliative and end of life care (EoLC) have shifted 
in Australia, reflected in policy frameworks, national guidelines, service 
systems and funding models. However, aligning service systems and practice 
realities with these policy aspirations has been problematic in Australia and 
elsewhere. The current study investigates the recent implementation of a unique, 
community palliative care (CPC) programme called Heidi's Have a Go (HHaG) in 
regional Australia, which seemed to bridge the problematic divide between policy 
aspirations and practice implementation. Qualitative research was undertaken to 
examine the programme design and influence from the perspective of programme 
staff and volunteers. The data generated compelling stories on staff and patient 
experiences in its first 2 years, achieving service outcomes aligned with 
current policy and national frameworks and privileging patient voices.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have emerged as a major threat to global health 
resulting in a decrease in life expectancy with respect to humans. Thrombosis is 
one of the foremost causes of CVDs, and it is characterized by the unwanted 
formation of fibrin clots. Recently, microbial fibrinolytic enzymes due to their 
specific features have gained much more attention than conventional thrombolytic 
agents for the treatment of thrombosis. Marine microorganisms including bacteria 
and microalgae have the significant ability to produce fibrinolytic enzymes with 
improved pharmacological properties and lesser side effects and, hence, are 
considered as prospective candidates for large scale production of these 
enzymes. There are no studies that have evaluated the fibrinolytic potential of 
marine fungal-derived enzymes. The current review presents an outline regarding 
isolation sources, production, features, and thrombolytic potential of 
fibrinolytic biocatalysts from marine microorganisms identified so far.
