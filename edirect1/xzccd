were as follows: English or Dutch language, model-based economic evaluation, 
chemotherapy or TT as intervention, population diagnosed with MBC, published 
between 2000 and 2014, reporting life years (LY) or quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. General characteristics, 
model characteristics and outcomes of the studies were extracted. Quality of the 
studies was assessed through a checklist.
RESULTS: 24 studies were included, considering 50 comparisons (20 concerning 
chemotherapy and 30 TT). Seven comparisons were represented in multiple studies. 
A health state-transition model including the following health states: 
stable/progression-free disease, progression and death was used in 18 studies. 
Studies fulfilled on average 14 out of the 26 items of the quality checklist, 
mostly due to a lack of transparency in reporting. Thirty-one per cent of the 
incremental net monetary benefit was positive. TT led to higher iQALY gained, 
and industry-sponsored studies reported more favourable cost-effectiveness 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of a disease-specific reference model would improve 
the transparency and quality of model-based cost-effectiveness assessments for 
MBC treatments. Incremental health benefits increased over time, but were 
outweighed by the increased treatment costs. Consequently, increased health 
benefits led to lower value for money.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI) in the elderly 
patients is challenging because of the comorbidity and fragility of these 
patients. We analyzed survival in relation to different treatment options and 
estimated life expectancy of our study group by age and gender.
METHODS: All patients aged ≥70 years, presenting with chronic CLI, between 2006 
and 2013 were included. The treatment was conservative, endovascular, surgical, 
or by primary major amputation. The interest was in the effect of conservative 
versus nonconservative treatment on survival. Furthermore, we compared mortality 
and life expectancy between the study population to the overall Dutch population 
by age and gender.
RESULTS: In total, 686 legs in 651 patients were treated. Initial treatment of 
patients was conservative (n = 181), endovascular (n = 259), surgical (n = 169), 
or amputation (n = 42). The overall 1-year mortality was 29%. Patients were 
stratified by age: 70-79 (n = 350) years and ≥80 (n = 301) years. Higher 
mortality rate ratios (RR) were found in octogenarians compared with patients 
aged 70-79 years, in the endovascular (P < 0.001) and surgical (P < 0.001) 
group. The mortality RRs of conservative relatively to nonconservative treatment 
was 0.84 (95% confidence interval: 0.65-1.09; P = 0.19), not significantly 
differing between both age groups (P = 0.74). The mortality RR of 3.72 of our 
study population to the Dutch general population was high, with an excess 
mortality of 272%. Life expectancy at the age of 70 years was substantially 
decreased by 9 and 8 years for, respectively, the male and female population.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality rates in elderly patients with CLI are high, 
corresponding with a decreased life expectancy, regardless of the type of 
intervention. Revascularization is associated with high periprocedural 
mortality, especially in octogenarians. Conservative treatment is noninferior to 
nonconservative treatment in terms of mortality and should be considered as the 
treatment in octogenarians with substantial comorbidity.

BACKGROUND: Population-based BRCA1/BRCA2 testing has been found to be 
cost-effective compared with family history-based testing in Ashkenazi-Jewish 
women were >30 years old with 4 Ashkenazi-Jewish grandparents. However, 
individuals may have 1, 2, or 3 Ashkenazi-Jewish grandparents, and 
cost-effectiveness data are lacking at these lower BRCA prevalence estimates. We 
present an updated cost-effectiveness analysis of population BRCA1/BRCA2 testing 
for women with 1, 2, and 3 Ashkenazi-Jewish grandparents.
STUDY DESIGN: Decision analysis model.
METHODS: Lifetime costs and effects of population and family history-based 
testing were compared with the use of a decision analysis model. 56% BRCA 
carriers are missed by family history criteria alone. Analyses were conducted 
for United Kingdom and United States populations. Model parameters were obtained 
from the Genetic Cancer Prediction through Population Screening trial and 
published literature. Model parameters and BRCA population prevalence for 
individuals with 3, 2, or 1 Ashkenazi-Jewish grandparent were adjusted for the 
relative frequency of BRCA mutations in the Ashkenazi-Jewish and general 
populations. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for all 
Ashkenazi-Jewish grandparent scenarios. Costs, along with outcomes, were 
discounted at 3.5%. The time horizon of the analysis is "life-time," and 
perspective is "payer." Probabilistic sensitivity analysis evaluated model 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: Population testing for BRCA mutations is cost-saving in 
Ashkenazi-Jewish women with 2, 3, or 4 grandparents (22-33 days life-gained) in 
the United Kingdom and 1, 2, 3, or 4 grandparents (12-26 days life-gained) in 
the United States populations, respectively. It is also extremely cost-effective 
in women in the United Kingdom with just 1 Ashkenazi-Jewish grandparent with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £863 per quality-adjusted life-years and 
15 days life gained. Results show that population-testing remains cost-effective 
at the £20,000-30000 per quality-adjusted life-years and $100,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-years willingness-to-pay thresholds for all 4 
Ashkenazi-Jewish grandparent scenarios, with ≥95% simulations found to be 
cost-effective on probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Population-testing remains 
cost-effective in the absence of reduction in breast cancer risk from 
oophorectomy and at lower risk-reducing mastectomy (13%) or risk-reducing 
salpingo-oophorectomy (20%) rates.
CONCLUSION: Population testing for BRCA mutations with varying levels of 
Ashkenazi-Jewish ancestry is cost-effective in the United Kingdom and the United 
States. These results support population testing in Ashkenazi-Jewish women with 
1-4 Ashkenazi-Jewish grandparent ancestry.

BACKGROUND: Chronic neuronopathic Gaucher's disease type 3 (GD3) is relatively 
frequent in northern Sweden. Besides multiple other neurological symptoms, 
horizontal gaze palsy or oculomotor apraxia is common in GD3.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the saccades in patients with Norrbottnian GD3 with 
respect to their neurological and cognitive status using a computer-based 
eye-tracking technique.
METHODS: Horizontal and vertical reflexive saccades as well as antisaccades of 
nine GD3 patients [4M/5F; 41.1 ± 11.0 years; modified severity scoring tool 
(mSST): 9.3 ± 5.4; Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): 24.0 ± 4.2] and 
age-matched controls were analyzed using EyeBrain T2, a head-mounted binocular 
eye tracker. Systematic clinical assessment included the mSST, a valid tool for 
monitoring the neurological progression in GD3 and MoCA.
RESULTS: In Norrbottnian GD3 patients, gain, peak, and average velocity 
(107.5°/s ± 41.8 vs. 283.9°/s ± 17.0; p = 0.0009) of horizontal saccades were 
reduced compared to healthy controls (HCs). Regarding vertical saccades, only 
the average velocity of downward saccades was decreased (128.6°/s ± 63.4 vs. 
244.1°/s ± 50.8; p = 0.004). Vertical and horizontal saccadic latencies were 
increased (294.3 ms ± 37.0 vs. 236.5 ms ± 22.4; p = 0.005) and the latency of 
horizontal reflexive saccades was correlated with the mSST score (R2 = 0.80; 
p = 0.003). The latency of antisaccades showed association to MoCA score 
(R2 = 0.70; p = 0.009). GD3 patients made more errors in the antisaccade task 
(41.5 ± 27.6% vs. 5.2 ± 5.8%; p = 0.005), and the error rate tended to correlate 
with the cognitive function measured in MoCA score (p = 0.06).
CONCLUSION: The mean age of 41 years of our GD3 cohort reflects the increased 
life expectancy of patients in the Norrbottnian area compared to other GD3 
cohorts. Marked impairment of horizontal saccades was evident in all patients, 
whereas vertical saccades showed distinct impairment of downward velocity. 
Latency of reflexive saccades was associated with the severity of neurological 
symptoms. Increased latency and error rate in the antisaccade task were linked 
to cognitive impairment. The assessment of saccades provides markers for 
neurological and neuropsychological involvement in Norrbottnian GD3.

Incidence of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) is increasing due to the 
increase in human life expectancy and prevalence of osteoporosis. Percutaneous 
vertebroplasty (PVP) has become a widely used alternative treatment for 
symptomatic VCFs refractory to medical therapy. It is a minimally invasive 
technique involving injection most frequently of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) 
directly into the vertebral body through the pedicles. Percutaneous 
vertebroplasty yields good results in terms of early vertebral stabilization and 
prompt pain relief. This study describes the experience of the Department of 
Neurosurgery at Ibn Sina University Hospital (Rabat, Morocco) and assesses short 
and long term clinical and radiological outcomes and complications of 
vertebroplasty in a retrospective assessment of 36 vertebral compression 
fractures in 35 patients (16 men and 19 women subjects) who had been treated 
with vertebroplasty from November 2006 to December 2014.

The EMG signal indicates the electrophysiological response to daily living of 
activities, particularly to lower-limb knee exercises. Literature reports have 
shown numerous benefits of the Wavelet analysis in EMG feature extraction for 
pattern recognition. However, its application to typical knee exercises when 
using only a single EMG channel is limited. In this study, three types of knee 
exercises, i.e., flexion of the leg up (standing), hip extension from a sitting 
position (sitting) and gait (walking) are investigated from 14 healthy untrained 
subjects, while EMG signals from the muscle group of vastus medialis and the 
goniometer on the knee joint of the detected leg are synchronously monitored and 
recorded. Four types of lower-limb motions including standing, sitting, stance 
phase of walking, and swing phase of walking, are segmented. The Wavelet 
Transform (WT) based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) approach is proposed for 
the classification of four lower-limb motions using a single-channel EMG signal 
from the muscle group of vastus medialis. Based on lower-limb motions from all 
subjects, the combination of five-level wavelet decomposition and SVD is used to 
comprise the feature vector. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then configured 
to build a multiple-subject classifier for which the subject independent 
accuracy will be given across all subjects for the classification of four types 
of lower-limb motions. In order to effectively indicate the classification 
performance, EMG features from time-domain (e.g., Mean Absolute Value (MAV), 
Root-Mean-Square (RMS), integrated EMG (iEMG), Zero Crossing (ZC)) and 
frequency-domain (e.g., Mean Frequency (MNF) and Median Frequency (MDF)) are 
also used to classify lower-limb motions. The five-fold cross validation is 
performed and it repeats fifty times in order to acquire the robust subject 
independent accuracy. Results show that the proposed WT-based SVD approach has 
the classification accuracy of 91.85%±0.88% which outperforms other feature 
models.

BACKGROUND: There are growing numbers of older parents providing ongoing care 
for adults with disabilities. A parent's aging calls for a redefinition of 
parental care practices and roles in light of his or her own changing needs.
PURPOSE: The current study aims to highlight the ways in which aging parents 
perceive and construct their parental role to adult children with disabilities 
at this point in their lives.
METHODS: An interpretive phenomenological analysis perspective was used. Data 
collection was performed through in-depth, semistructured interviews with 20 
aging parents of children with developmental disabilities, followed by a content 
analysis.
RESULTS: Four patterns of parental identity emerged: "Being happy is his 
responsibility; I did my part," embracing aging needs; "I can do part-time 
worrying," a gradual letting go of parental roles; "I'm worn out, but I keep 
going. What choice do I have?" bearing the brunt; "I'm an old woman changing 
diapers," full-time parents.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings enable a deeper understanding of the various ways in 
which parents cope with aging alongside caring for an adult child with 
disability. Hence, this study can serve as a framework for developing tailored 
and differential intervention methods for these families.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: As the world's people experience longer life expectancy, of 
both individuals with disabilities and their parents, nurses' education and 
practice should be challenged by the double sensitivities of elder's 
caregiving and address the unique needs of this unique population.

Metastases of transverse colon cancer to bilateral ovaries (Krukenberg tumor) 
and the left breast: A case report.

Breast cancer has the highest rate of incidence among all types of cancer in 
women. Only ~0.43% of breast malignancies occur as a result of metastatic 
lesions from extramammary tumors. The present study reports an extremely rare 
case of transverse colon cancer metastasizing to the bilateral ovaries and the 
left breast. The patient was a 47-year old female, who had a lump in the left 
breast without axillary lymphadenopathy. Specimens obtained by core needle 
biopsy were submitted for hematoxylin and eosin examination, and results 
revealed that the lump was a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Since the 
patient had elevated levels of the carcinoembryonic antigen and a medical 
history of a Krukenberg tumor metastasized from colon cancer, 
immunohistochemical examinations were applied. Results identified that 
caudal-related homeobox protein 2 and cytokeratin 20 were positively stained, 
whilst cytokeratin 7 was negatively stained. Therefore, this patient was 
diagnosed as having colon cancer that had metastasized to the bilateral ovaries 
and the left breast. As the life expectancy of patients with cancer is 
increasing, types of metastases that used to be seen as rare are increasingly 
becoming more common. For clinicians, diagnosis should be cautious, and 
differential diagnosis should always be kept in mind.

Clinical features and surgical management of intracranial meningiomas in the 
elderly.

Health, Kitakyushu 807-8555, Japan.

Meningioma accounts for ~25% of all primary intracranial neoplasms and the 
incidence increases with age. Prvios population-based studies demonstrated that 
the annual incidence of intracranial meningiomas was 1.2-3.1/100,000 population. 
In particular, the incidence of this disease among the elderly is high. 
Recently, increased life expectancy and greater use of diagnostic radiological 
imaging led to an increased incidence in the diagnosis of intracranial 
meningiomas, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, in the elderly. Thus, 
neurosurgeons may be increasingly confronted with the management of intracranial 
meningiomas in the elderly. In practice, it is often difficult for physicians to 
determine whether traditional surgical resection is the optimal management 
strategy for intracranial meningiomas in the elderly. However, reported clinical 
studies about the outcome of surgical resection of intracranial meningiomas in 
the elderly are limited. Increased risk of mortality and morbidity associated 
with surgical treatment for intracranial meningiomas in the elderly compared 
with younger patients have been controversial. In the present study, the 
clinical features of intracranial meningiomas in 70 consecutive intracranial 
meningioma patients that underwent surgical treatment at the affiliated hospital 
of University of Occupational and Environmental Health between 2007 and 2013 
were assessed. In addition, patient selection and surgical management of 
intracranial meningioma in elderly patients was discussed. Preoperative factors, 
including symptoms, tumor location, tumor size, Karnofsky Performance Scale 
(KPS) score and American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score, and 
postoperative factors, including pathological diagnosis, tumor proliferation 
index (Ki-67), resection rate (Simpson grade), length of hospital stay and 
discharge destination were retrospectively analyzed in patients aged ≥75 years 
(n=16; elderly group) and <75 years (n=54; younger group). Outcomes were 
assessed 6 months after surgery. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that 
tumor resection rate (Simpson grade III-V) was an important predictor of 
surgical complications (odds ratio, 5.662; 95% confidence interval, 
1.323-24.236; P=0.0194). Perioperative morbidity was not correlated with age 
(>75 years), tumor location, tumor size, KPS score or ASA score. Thus, the 
present study indicated that age is not associated with surgical outcome in 
elderly meningioma patients. Regardless of patient age, the decision to perform 
surgical resection should be made on an individual basis wherein tumor 
characteristics and the general health of the patient are considered.

BACKGROUND: The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) has been 
funded under the Australia National Immunisation Program (NIP) since January 
2005 for those aged >65years and other risk groups. In 2016, PCV13 was accepted 
by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) as a replacement for a 
single dose of PPV23 in older Australian adults.
METHODS: A single-cohort deterministic multi-compartment (Markov) model was 
developed describing the transition of the population between different invasive 
and non-invasive pneumococcal disease related health states. We applied a 
healthcare system perspective with costs (Australian dollars, A$) and health 
effects (measured in quality adjusted life-years, QALYs) attached to model 
states and discounted at 5% annually. We explored replacement of PPV23 with 
PCV13 at 65years as well as other age based vaccination strategies. Parameter 
uncertainty was explored using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: In a single cohort, we estimated PCV13 vaccination at the age of 
65years to cost ∼A$11,120,000 and prevent 39 hospitalisations and 6 deaths from 
invasive pneumococcal disease and 180 hospitalisations and 10 deaths from 
community acquired pneumonia. The PCV13 program had an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of ∼A$88,100 per QALY gained when compared to a 
no-vaccination, whereas PPV23 was ∼A$297,200 per QALY gained. To fall under a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of A$60,000 per QALY, PCV13 would have to be priced 
below ∼A$46 per dose. The cost-effectiveness of PCV13 in comparison to PPV23 was 
∼A$35,300 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: In comparison to no-vaccination, we found PCV13 use in those aged 
65years was unlikely to be cost-effective unless the vaccine price was below 
A$46 or a longer duration of protection can be established. However, we found 
that in comparison to the PPV23, vaccination with PCV13 was cost-effective. This

INTRODUCTION: Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide. While a 
curative intent is the aim of any surgical treatment many patients either 
present with or go onto develop disseminated disease requiring systemic 
anti-cancer therapy with a palliative intent. Given their limited life 
expectancy appropriate allocation of treatment is vital. It is recognised that 
systemic chemoradiotherapy may shorten the quality/quantity of life in patients 
with advanced cancer. It is against this background that the present systematic 
review and meta-analysis of the prognostic value of markers of the systemic 
inflammatory response in patients with advanced cancer was conducted.
METHODS: An extensive literature review using targeted medical subject headings 
was carried out in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CDSR databases until the end of 
2016. Titles were examined for relevance and studies relating to duplicate 
datasets, that were not published in English and that did not have full text 
availability were excluded. Full texts of relevant articles were obtained and 
were then examined to identify any further relevant articles.
RESULTS: The majority of studies were retrospective. The systemic inflammatory 
response, as evidenced by a number of markers at clinical thresholds, was 
reported to have independent prognostic value, across tumour types and 
geographical locations. In particular, C-reactive protein (CRP, 63 studies), 
albumin (33 studies) the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS, 44 studies) and the 
Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR, 59 articles) were consistently validated 
across tumour types and geographical locations. There was considerable variation 
in the thresholds reported to have prognostic value when CRP and albumin were 
examined. There was less variation in the thresholds reported for NLR and still 
less for the GPS.
DISCUSSION: The systemic inflammatory response, especially as evidenced by the 
GPS and NLR, has reliable prognostic value in patients with advanced cancer. 
Further prospective studies of their clinical utility in randomised clinical 
trials and in treatment allocation are warranted.

The management of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases is 
challenging, as this frequent complication negatively impacts patients' quality 
of life, and can be a life-threatening event. Through a review of the 
literature, we discuss the main therapeutic options and the recent developments 
that improved (and complicated) the management of NSCLC brain metastases 
patients. Most current validated approaches are local with exclusive or combined 
surgery, whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). At 
the same time, there is a growing role for systemic treatments that might 
significantly postpone WBRT. Targeted therapies efficacy/toxicity profile 
remains to be defined but predictive and prognostic molecular factors 
integration could help to select treatments fully adapted to life expectancy and 
progression risk.

[Priority setting and rationing of pharmaceuticals - an experimental analysis of 
discussion processes].

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: In the face of rising expenditure among statutory sickness 
funds in Germany it is necessary to start a discussion about priority setting in 
the healthcare system. For a long time this issue has been avoided in healthcare 
debates. As a result, normative directives are still missing, which can lead to 
priority setting among healthcare providers in daily healthcare practice. 
Prioritization can be conducted at three different levels: at the government 
(macro), the institutional (meso), and the patient (micro) level. Surveys about 
societal preferences for different criteria exist; however, specifications on 
their respective weighting in the situation of approval and reimbursement of 
pharmaceuticals (meso) are missing. For this reason, the present study analyzed 
the implementation and weighting of the criteria for priority setting at the 
meso level, taking values and experiences of the participants into account.
METHOD: Six qualitative focus groups were carried out with representatives from 
the fields of medicine, ethics, public health and economics. During the 
discussions four fictitious drugs for the treatment of different lung diseases 
were prioritized based on guidelines. The discussion processes were analyzed 
according to Bohnsack's documentary method.
RESULTS: The criteria "quality of life", "life expectancy" and "other 
patient-relevant outcomes" were discussed in relation to each other. The 
evaluation of change in patient-relevant outcomes was difficult to perform for 
non-medical participants. The second argument concerned the criteria "costs", 
disease severity and "number of patients". Costs were given less weight, but 
were often used to support other criteria. Other challenges in reaching a 
consensus included emerging role conflicts between profession and personal 
opinion, and the transfer of the discussion to a different level of 
decision-making.
DISCUSSION: In the discussions the problem of prioritizing did not arise from 
different preferences for prioritization criteria, but from the weighting of the 
criteria. The operationalization of the criteria seemingly depends on the 
decision-making situation, the participants' personal connection with the 
relevant disease and on the correspondence between evidence and personal 
experiences.

[Effect of disease severity on upper extremity muscle strength, exercise 
capacity, and activities of daily living in individuals with pulmonary arterial 
hypertension].

OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease. Although 
muscle strength, exercise capacity, quality of life, and activities of daily 
living of patients with PAH are affected, it is not known how they are affected 
by disease severity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate effects 
of disease severity on upper extremity muscle strength, exercise capacity, and 
performance of activities of daily living in patients with PAH.
METHODS: Twenty-five patients with disease severity classified according to the 
New York Heart Association (NYHA) as functional class II (n=14) or class III 
(n=11) were included in the study. Upper-extremity exercise capacity and 
limitations in performing activities of daily living were assessed with 6-minute 
pegboard and ring test (6PBRT) and the Milliken activities of daily living scale 
(MAS), respectively. Shoulder flexion, elbow extension, elbow flexion muscle 
strength, and handgrip strength were measured with dynamometer.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, gender, body mass index, 
or mean pulmonary artery pressure between groups (p>0.05). The 6PBRT, MAS, and 
elbow flexion (right) and grip strength (right and left) results were 
significantly lower in NYHA III group than in NYHA II group (p=0.004, p=0.002, 
p=0.043, p=0.002 and p=0.003, respectively). There was no significant difference 
in shoulder flexion, elbow flexion (left), or elbow extension between groups 
(p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that upper extremity exercise capacity, elbow 
flexion muscle strength (right), and handgrip strength decrease and that 
limitations in activities of daily living grow as disease severity increases in 
patients with PAH. When planning rehabilitation programs, disease severity 
should be considered and evaluations and treatments for the upper extremities 
should be included.

Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Gaziantep

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is expected to increase gradually with the 
prolongation of population aging and life expectancy. In addition to 
macrovascular and microvascular complications of elderly patients of diabetes 
mellitus, geriatric syndromes such as cognitive impairment, depression, urinary 
incontinence, falling and polypharmacy are also accompanied by aging. Individual 
functional status in the elderly shows heterogeneity so that in these patients, 
there are many unanswered questions about the management of diabetes treatment. 
The goals of diabetes treatment in elderly patients include hyperglycemia and 
risk factors, as in younger patients. comorbid diseases and functional 
limitations of individuals should be taken into consideration when setting 
treatment targets. Thus, treatment should be individualized. In the treatment of 
diabetes in vulnerable elderly patients, hypoglycemia, hypotension, and drug 
interactions due to multiple drug use should be avoided. Since it also affects 
the ability to self-care in these patients, management of other concurrent 
medical conditions is also important.

OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains the gold standard for 
complex revascularisation in multivessel disease. The concept of the minimally 
invasive extracorporeal circulation circuit (MiECC) was introduced to minimise 
pathophysiological side effects of conventional extracorporeal circulation. This 
study presents early and long-term outcomes after CABG with use of MiECC in a 
single-centre consecutive patient cohort.
METHODS: From 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2010, 2130 patients underwent 
isolated CABG with MiECC at our centre. We evaluated morbidity and mortality 
follow-up data with a median follow-up of 3.6 years. Kaplan-Meier curves and 
estimates of the primary end-point for all-cause mortality were compared with 
the life expectancy of the general population.
RESULTS: Mortality in CABG patients was comparable to the general population 
beginning 1 year after surgery for the whole observation period. All-cause 
30-day mortality was 0.8%. The mean estimated logistic EuroSCORE and EuroSCORE 
II were 5.8 ± 8.6 and 3.0 ± 5.1, respectively. Mean perfusion time was 71.1 ± 
23.8 min with a cross-clamp time of 44.9 ± 16.3 min. Mortality was predicted by 
the presence of diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] 1.85, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 1.40-2.46; p <0.001), peripheral arterial disease (OR 2.36, 95% CI 
1.64-3.38; p <0.001), severe obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 3.21, 1.42-7.24; 
p = 0.005), chronic renal failure (OR 3.68, 2.49-5.43; p <0.001) and transfusion 
of more than one unit of erythrocyte concentrate in the perioperative period (OR 
1.46, 1.09-1.95; p = 0.015). Cerebrovascular events occurred in 36 patients 
(1.7%).
CONCLUSION: CABG with use of MiECC is associated with a mortality rate 
comparable to the overall life expectancy of the general population. MiECC is 
the first choice for routine and emergency CABG at our centre with a 30-day 
mortality rate of 0.8% and a low complication rate.

Medical challenges at the end of the first ten decades of life.

Münzer T(1).

Author information:
(1)Geriatrische Klinik St Gallen, Switzerland.

Demographic changes worldwide challenge the healthcare system. Advanced age is 
associated with a number of biological alterations that, together with 
concomitant comorbidities, increase the risk for functional decline by inducing 
functional disintegration. In this concept frailty and sarcopenia play an 
important role. Consequently the preservation of muscle mass and function are 
prominent targets of medicine in old age. In order to professionally care for 
persons in their last years of life several other factors influencing medical 
decisions regarding diagnostic and treatments are important. These factors 
concern the life expectancy, the person`s functional status the physicians 
involved in care and the family system. Balancing between over- and 
undertreatment in very old patients can be optimised by a goal-oriented decision 
making approach. Very old persons with poor decision making capacity might 
benefit from decisions made in a team. To be able to manage the challenges 
associated with the last decade of life, we need physicians who have the 
knowledge, the appropriate attitude towards frail old patients and the skills to 
communicate with different groups involved in care. Ideally old age medicine 
should become an integrative part of a unified national medical curriculum.

This qualitative study explored the views of family carers about the support 
that their adult children with an intellectual disability had received in 
relation to their behaviour that challenged. There was a particular focus on 
positive behavioural support (PBS), although some participants spoke more 
generally in terms of positive approaches. Semi-structured interviews with eight 
family carers were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Four key themes 
were identified. Good support, of which PBS was an example, was seen as both 
having reduced behaviours that challenged and having a wider positive impact on 
the quality of life of the individual and their families. Key features 
highlighted were: technical knowledge and skill; a strong value base of warmth, 
acceptance and respect; a collaborative, consistent approach; open 
communication; and the extension of support to the family carer when needed. It 
was recognised that there is a need for broad systemic change and for the 
application of a workforce development model that takes account of the needs of 
staff, carers and those working in wider systems that have contact with people 
with an intellectual disability.

Novel strategies for anti-aging drug discovery.

Scientific achievements in the last few decades, leading to effective 
therapeutic interventions, have dramatically improved human life expectancy. 
Consequently, aging has become a significant problem and represents the major 
risk factor for most human pathologies including diabetes, cardiovascular 
diseases, neurological disorders, and cancer. Scientific discoveries over the 
past two decades have been instrumental in dissecting molecular mechanism(s) 
which play important roles in determining longevity. The same understanding has 
also led to the acknowledgement of the plurality of 'causes' which act either 
alone or in combination to create the condition which can be defined as 'aging'. 
Areas covered: Over the years, several concepts have been put forward for the 
development of a viable anti-aging regimen. In this review, the authors 
extensively review anti aging interventions based on caloric restriction, 
activation of telomerase, autophagy inducers, senolytic therapeutics, plasma 
membrane redox system (PMRS) activators, epigenetic modulators, and stem cell 
therapies. Expert opinion: Based upon our current understanding, one of the most 
promising approaches for a successful anti-aging strategy includes the 
activation of adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (AMPK). Another 
strategy may involve activation of PMRS. Future research efforts are likely to 
focus on nutrient and energy sensing molecular pathways which include mTOR, 
IGF-1, AMPK and the sirtuins.

Men have shorter life expectancy and higher mortality than women; however, only 
a few countries have dedicated men's health policies. Men's health reports can 
support the development of men's health policies. The 2013 Asian Men's Health 
Report (AMHR) systematically documents and compares the status of men's health 
across countries in Asia. The AMHR can be used as an exemplar to guide future 
men's health reports. The main challenges during creation of the AMHR were the 
lack of comprehensive health databases and the variety of data quality between 
countries. The AMHR revealed variations in mortality and morbidity across 
diseases, regions, and income groups, prompting a Delphi survey among men's 
health stakeholders to determine whether any dedicated men's health policies in 
Asia existed and to reach a consensus on the recommendations of men's health 
policies. The AMHR helped to promote men's health in Asia and across the world, 
generated research questions and collaborations, provided evidence to support 
development of men's health policies, identified the need to improve existing 
health databases, and developed a framework for the creation of other men's 
health reports.

BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion in chronic anemia is not covered by guidelines 
specific to older adults. When they consider that this treatment is necessary in 
elderly patients, French general practitioners (GPs) contact a hospital 
specialist to plan a transfusion.
METHODS: Twenty French GPs were questioned individually regarding their approach 
to blood transfusion using semi-structured interviews. Each interview was 
recorded, typed up verbatim and then coded using an inductive procedure by 
theme, in a cross-over design (two researchers) in two phases: analysis and 
summary, followed by grouping of the recorded comments.
RESULTS: The criteria for transfusion were hemoglobin level < 8 g/dL and cardiac 
comorbidities. Some geriatric issues, such as cognitive disorder or dependence, 
were considered, either as aspects of frailty favoring transfusion or as markers 
of reduced life expectancy that limit care. Falls and fear of an unpleasant 
death from anemia prompted GPs to order blood transfusion. The patient's family 
provided guidance, but the patient was not routinely consulted. The specialists 
were rarely asked to participate in decision making. GPs' perceptions were 
ambivalent: they considered transfusion to be extraordinary and magical, but 
also pointless since its effects are transient.
CONCLUSION: The decision to give a transfusion to an elderly patient with 
chronic anemia is deemed complex, but GPs seem to take it alone, sometimes 
guided by the patient's family. The drawing up of an advance care plan could 
help involve the patient in decision making.
