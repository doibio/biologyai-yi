LIMITATION: Some projections are based on extrapolations of the actual data.
CONCLUSION: In counties with fewer PCPs per population, increases in PCP density 
would be expected to substantially improve life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Total knee replacement (TKR) is an effective and cost-effective 
strategy for treating end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Greater risk for 
complications among TKR recipients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or 
greater has raised concerns about the value of TKR in this population.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of TKR in recipients with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or 
greater using a cost-effectiveness analysis.
DESIGN: Osteoarthritis Policy Model to assess long-term clinical benefits, 
costs, and cost-effectiveness of TKR in patients with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or 
greater.
DATA SOURCES: Total knee replacement parameters from longitudinal studies and 
published literature, and costs from Medicare Physician Fee Schedules, the 
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, and published data.
TARGET POPULATION: Recipients of TKR with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater in the 
United States.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care sector.
INTERVENTION: Total knee replacement.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), discounted at 3% annually.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Total knee replacement increased QALYs by 0.71 
year and lifetime medical costs by $25 200 among patients aged 50 to 65 years 
with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater, resulting in an ICER of $35 200. Total knee 
replacement in patients older than 65 years with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater 
increased QALYs by 0.39 year and costs by $21 100, resulting in an ICER of 
$54 100.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: In TKR recipients with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or 
greater and diabetes and cardiovascular disease, ICERs were below $75 000 per 
QALY. Results were most sensitive to complication rates and preoperative pain 
levels. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, at a $55 000-per-QALY 
willingness-to-pay threshold, TKR had a 100% and 90% likelihood of being a 
cost-effective strategy for patients aged 50 to 65 years and patients older than 
65 years, respectively.
LIMITATION: Data are derived from several sources.
CONCLUSION: From a cost-effectiveness perspective, TKR offers good value in 
patients with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater, including those with multiple 
comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive 
neurodegenerative condition with a mean life expectancy of 3 years from first 
symptom. Understanding the factors that are important to both patients and their 
caregivers has the potential to enhance service delivery and engagement, and 
improve efficiency. The Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) is a stated preferences 
method which asks service users to make trade-offs for various attributes of 
health services. This method is used to quantify preferences and shows the 
relative importance of the attributes in the experiment, to the service user.
METHODS: A DCE with nine choice sets was developed to measure the preferences 
for health services of ALS patients and their caregivers and the relative 
importance of various aspects of care, such as timing of care, availability of 
services, and decision making. The DCE was presented to patients with ALS, and 
their caregivers, recruited from a national multidisciplinary clinic. A random 
effects probit model was applied to estimate the impact of each attribute on a 
participant's choice.
RESULTS: Patients demonstrated the strongest preferences about timing of 
receiving information about ALS. A strong preference was also placed on seeing 
the hospice care team later rather than early on in the illness. Patients also 
indicated their willingness to consider the use of communication devices. 
Grouping by stage of disease, patients who were in earlier stages of disease 
showed a strong preference for receipt of extensive information about ALS at the 
time of diagnosis. Caregivers showed a strong preference for engagement with 
healthcare professionals, an attribute that was not prioritised by patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The DCE method can be useful in uncovering priorities of patients 
and caregivers with ALS. Patients and caregivers have different priorities 
relating to health services and the provision of care in ALS, and patient 
preferences differ based on the stage and duration of their illness. 
Multidisciplinary teams must calibrate the delivery of care in the context of 
the differing expectations, needs and priorities of the patient/caregiver dyad.

BACKGROUND: The stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans, is a major blood-feeding pest 
of livestock that has near worldwide distribution, causing an annual cost of 
over $2 billion for control and product loss in the USA alone. Control of these 
flies has been limited to increased sanitary management practices and 
insecticide application for suppressing larval stages. Few genetic and molecular 
resources are available to help in developing novel methods for controlling 
stable flies.
RESULTS: This study examines stable fly biology by utilizing a combination of 
high-quality genome sequencing and RNA-Seq analyses targeting multiple 
developmental stages and tissues. In conjunction, 1600 genes were manually 
curated to characterize genetic features related to stable fly reproduction, 
vector host interactions, host-microbe dynamics, and putative targets for 
control. Most notable was characterization of genes associated with reproduction 
and identification of expanded gene families with functional associations to 
vision, chemosensation, immunity, and metabolic detoxification pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined sequencing, assembly, and curation of the male stable 
fly genome followed by RNA-Seq and downstream analyses provide insights 
necessary to understand the biology of this important pest. These resources and 
new data will provide the groundwork for expanding the tools available to 
control stable fly infestations. The close relationship of Stomoxys to other 
blood-feeding (horn flies and Glossina) and non-blood-feeding flies (house 
flies, medflies, Drosophila) will facilitate understanding of the evolutionary 
processes associated with development of blood feeding among the Cyclorrhapha.

OBJECTIVE: To understand the nature of genetic and environmental susceptibility 
to multiple sclerosis (MS) and, by extension, susceptibility to other complex 
genetic diseases.
BACKGROUND: Certain basic epidemiological parameters of MS (e.g., 
population-prevalence of MS, recurrence-risks for MS in siblings and twins, 
proportion of women among MS patients, and the time-dependent changes in the 
sex-ratio) are well-established. In addition, more than 233 genetic-loci have 
now been identified as being unequivocally MS-associated, including 32 loci 
within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and one locus on the X 
chromosome. Despite this recent explosion in genetic associations, however, the 
association of MS with the HLA-DRB1*15:01~HLA-DQB1*06:02~a1 (H+) haplotype has 
been known for decades.
DESIGN/METHODS: We define the "genetically-susceptible" subset (G) to include 
everyone with any non-zero life-time chance of developing MS. Individuals who 
have no chance of developing MS, regardless of their environmental experiences, 
belong to the mutually exclusive "non-susceptible" subset (G-). Using these 
well-established epidemiological parameters, we analyze, mathematically, the 
implications that these observations have regarding the genetic-susceptibility 
to MS. In addition, we use the sex-ratio change (observed over a 35-year 
interval in Canada), to derive the relationship between MS-probability and an 
increasing likelihood of a sufficient environmental exposure.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that genetic-susceptibitly is confined to less than 7.3% 
of populations throughout Europe and North America. Consequently, more than 
92.7% of individuals in these populations have no chance whatsoever of 
developing MS, regardless of their environmental experiences. Even among 
carriers of the HLA-DRB1*15:01~HLA-DQB1*06:02~a1 haplotype, far fewer than 32% 
can possibly be members the (G) subset. Also, despite the current preponderance 
of women among MS patients, women are less likely to be in the susceptible (G) 
subset and have a higher environmental threshold for developing MS compared to 
men. Nevertheless, the penetrance of MS in susceptible women is considerably 
greater than it is in men. Moreover, the response-curves for MS-probability in 
susceptible individuals increases with an increasing likelihood of a sufficient 
environmental exposure, especially among women. However, these environmental 
response-curves plateau at under 50% for women and at a significantly lower 
level for men.
CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of MS requires both a genetic predisposition and a 
suitable environmental exposure. Nevertheless, genetic-susceptibility is rare in 
the population (< 7.3%) and requires specific combinations of non-additive 
genetic risk-factors. For example, only a minority of carriers of the 
HLA-DRB1*15:01~HLA-DQB1*06:02~a1 haplotype are even in the (G) subset and, thus, 
genetic-susceptibility to MS in these carriers must result from the combined 
effect this haplotype together with the effects of certain other (as yet, 
unidentified) genetic factors. By itself, this haplotype poses no MS-risk. By 
contrast, a sufficient environmental exposure (however many events are involved, 
whenever these events need to act, and whatever these events might be) is 
common, currently occurring in, at least, 76% of susceptible individuals. In 
addition, the fact that environmental response-curves plateau well below 50% 
(especially in men), indicates that disease pathogenesis is partly stochastic. 
By extension, other diseases, for which monozygotic-twin recurrence-risks 
greatly exceed the disease-prevalence (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and 
celiac disease), must have a similar genetic basis.

their functions.

A large number of proteins involved in RNA metabolism possess a double-stranded 
RNA-binding domain (dsRBD), whose sequence variations and functional 
versatilities are still being recognized. All dsRBDs have a similar structural 
fold: α1-L1-β1-L2-β2-L3-β3-L4-α2 (α represents an α-helix, β a β-sheet, and L a 
loop conformation between the well-defined secondary structures). Our recent 
work revealed that the dsRBD in Drosha, which is involved in animal microRNA 
(miRNA) biogenesis, differs from other dsRBDs by containing a short insertion in 
its L1 region and that this insertion is important for Drosha function. We asked 
why the same insertion is excluded in all other dsRBDs and proposed that a 
longer L1 may be detrimental to their functions. In this study, to test this 
hypothesis, we inserted the Drosha sequence into several well-known dsRBDs from 
various organisms. Gel mobility shift assay demonstrated that L1 extension 
invariably reduced RNA binding by these dsRBDs. In addition, such a mutation in 
Dicer, another protein involved in miRNA biogenesis, impaired Dicer's ability to 
process miRNAs, which led to de-repression of reporter expression, in human 
cells. Taken together, our results add to the growing appreciation of the 
diversity in dsRBDs and suggest that dsRBDs have intricate structures and 
functions that are sensitive to perturbations in the L1 region.

OBJECTIVES: This research aims to (1) replicate published health economic 
models, (2) compare reproduced results with original results, (3) identify 
facilitators and hurdles to model replicability and determine reproduction 
success, and (4) suggest model replication reporting standards to enhance model 
reproducibility, in the context of health economic obesity models.
METHODS: Four health economic obesity models simulating an adult UK population 
were identified, selected for replication, and evaluated using the Consolidated 
Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Reproduction 
results were compared to original results, focusing on cost-effectiveness 
outcomes, and the resulting reproduction success was assessed by published 
criteria. Replication facilitators and hurdles were identified and transferred 
into related reporting standards.
RESULTS: All four case studies were state-transition models simulating costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Comparing original versus reproduction 
outcomes, the following deviation ranges were observed: costs - 3.9 to 16.1% 
(mean over all model simulations 3.78%), QALYs - 3.7 to 2.1% (mean - 0.11%), and 
average cost-utility ratios - 3.0 to 17.9% (mean 4.28%). Applying different 
published criteria, an overall reproduction success was observed for three of 
four models. Key replication facilitators were input data tables and model 
diagrams, while missing standard deviations and missing formulas for equations 
were considered as key hurdles.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the feasibility of rebuilding health economic 
obesity models, but minor to major assumptions were needed to fill reporting 
gaps. Model replications can help to assess the quality of health economic model 
documentation and can be used to validate current model reporting practices. 
Simple changes to actual CHEERS reporting criteria may solve identified 
replication hurdles.

Sleep problems and short sleep duration have been linked to adverse health 
effects, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, but the mechanisms are not 
fully understood. Finding biomarkers could explain mechanistic pathways and help 
in understanding relationships between sleep and cardiometabolic health. The aim 
was to assess if sleep duration and sleep quality affect the 
cardiometabolic-related protein profile. In total, 242 proteins related to 
cardiometabolic health were measured in 2,430 plasma samples (male:female ratio 
1:1, aged 45-75 years) from the population-based EpiHealth cohort, using a 
proximity extension assay. The association of self-reported sleep duration and 
sleep quality with each of the 242 proteins (primary outcome) was assessed with 
linear regression modelling, adjusting for confounders, and corrected for 
multiple testing using the false discovery rate (5%). Potential effect 
modification of age and sex was also tested using an interaction term. We 
identified U-shaped associations between sleep duration and the plasma levels of 
the proteins follistatin (more prominent in younger individuals), matrix 
metallopeptidase 9 (men only), urokinase receptor, adrenomedullin and kidney 
injury molecule, all previously known to be related to cardiovascular risk. 
There was no relationship between sleep quality and any of the proteins, after 
adjustment for confounders. These results give new leads to investigate the 
potential mechanistic pathways between sleep and cardiometabolic health.

This study aimed to investigate the combined effects of a coating based on 
shellac and the active agent tannic acid (TA) on the storability and 
physiological variations of mangoes stored at room temperature. Results showed 
that TA-shellac prolonged shelf life and improved overall quality of mangoes to 
a higher extent compared with controls, which was reflected in the extension of 
shelf life for approximately 10 days, maintaining of tissue firmness and weight 
loss, slowing down of respiration rate, improvement of physical properties and 
chemical qualities, suppression of browning, reduction of lipid peroxidation, 
preservation of aromatic volatiles, and regulation of the related enzymes 
activities. Addition of TA to shellac coating also improved the antifungal 
effect of the formulation. The results suggest that a synergistic effect took 
place between TA and shellac, which demonstrates the high potential for shelf 
life extension and quality improvement of mangoes of this formulation.

BACKGROUND: A Korean Multicenter Prospective cohort study of Active Surveillance 
or Surgery (KoMPASS) for papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMCs) has been 
initiated. The aim is to compare clinical outcomes between active surveillance 
(AS) and an immediate lobectomy for low-risk PTMCs. We here outline the detailed 
protocol for this study.
METHODS: Adult patients with a cytopathologically confirmed PTMC sized 6.0 to 
10.0 mm by ultrasound (US) will be included. Patients will be excluded if they 
have a suspicious extra-thyroidal extension or metastasis of a PTMC or multiple 
thyroid nodules or other thyroid diseases which require a total thyroidectomy. 
Printed material describing the prognosis of PTMCs, and the pros and cons of 
each management option, will be provided to eligible patients to select their 
preferred intervention. For the AS group, thyroid US, thyroid function, and 
quality of life (QoL) parameters will be monitored every 6 months during the 
first year, and then annually thereafter. Disease progression will be defined as 
a ≥3 mm increase in maximal diameter of a PTMC, or the development of new 
thyroid cancers or metastases. If progression is detected, patients should 
undergo appropriate surgery. For the lobectomy group, a lobectomy with 
prophylactic central neck dissection will be done within 6 months. After initial 
surgery, thyroid US, thyroid function, serum thyroglobulin (Tg), anti-Tg 
antibody, and QoL parameters will be monitored every 6 months during the first 
year and annually thereafter. Disease progression will be defined in these cases 
as the development of new thyroid cancers or metastases.
CONCLUSION: KoMPASS findings will help to confirm the role of AS, and develop 
individualized management strategies, for low-risk PTMCs.

Objective: To investigate the current status and trend of disease burden of 
neoplasms in 1990 and 2016 for Beijing people. Methods: The incidence situation, 
deaths status and disease burden of neoplasms in Beijing were described by using 
the results of the global burden of diseases study 2016 (GBD 2016). The 
measurement index included incidence, death, years of life lost due to premature 
mortality (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and disability-adjusted 
years (DALY). Using the average world population from 2000 to 2025 as standard 
population to calculate the age-standardized incidence rate, mortality rate, 
DALY rate, YLL rate and YLD rate. Results: The age-standardized incidence rate 
of neoplasms in 2016 was 250.68 per 100 000, which increased by 30.03% than in 
1990. The age-standardized mortality rate was 115.83 per 100 000, which 
decreased by 26.71% than in 1990. The DALY, YLL and YLD of neoplasms in 2016 
were 671.2, 651.1 and 20.1 thousand person-years, respectively, which increased 
by 85.83%, 82.79% and 302.00% than those in 1990. The age-standardized DALY rate 
and YLL rate were 2 549.00 and 2 469.84 per 100 000, which decreased by 33.22% 
and 34.30% than those in 1990. The age-standardized YLD rate was 79.16 per 100 
000, which increased by 37.17% than that in 1990. The male DALY, YLL and YLD in 
2016 were 428.8, 417.8 and 11.0 thousand person-years, and female were 242.4, 
233.3 and 9.1 thousand person-years, respectively.Among different neoplasms, the 
top three neoplasms of DALY and YLL were lung cancer, liver cancer, colon and 
rectum cancer, the top three of YLD were lung cancer, colon and rectum cancer, 
breast cancer. The topped group of disease burden of neoplasms was aged from 50 
to 69 years old, the DALY of which was 323.6 thousand person-years, accounted 
for 48.21% of all DALY, and increased by 87.70% than that in 1990. Conclusions: 
The disease burden of neoplasms in Beijing is dominated by YLL, and the YLD 
increases rapidly. The burden is severe in the group of aged from 50 to 69 years 
old, and the male is severer than female. Lung cancer ranks the first of the 
disease burden of neoplasms. The DALY of colorectal cancer has increased. 
Comprehensive strategies should be promoted, including cultivating a good 
lifestyle and implementing prevention and control of neoplasm risk factors as 
early as teenage group, early screening of high-risk population, and enhancing 
the instruction of patients' treatment and rehabilitation.

Publisher: 目的： 了解北京市1990年与2016年恶性肿瘤的疾病负担现状及其变化情况。 方法： 
利用2016年全球疾病负担研究结果，对1990年和2016年北京市恶性肿瘤发病情况、死亡情况和疾病负担进行描述。主要指标包括发病数、死亡数、过早死亡损失寿命年(YLL)、伤残损失寿命年(YLD)和伤残调整寿命年(DALY)，同时使用2000—2025年世界人口的平均人口作为标准人口，计算标化发病率、标化死亡率、DALY率、YLL率和YLD率。 
结果： 
2016年恶性肿瘤标化发病率为250.68/10万，较1990年增加30.03%；标化死亡率为115.83/10万，较1990年降低26.71%。恶性肿瘤DALY、YLL和YLD分别为67.12万人年、65.11万人年和2.01万人年，较1990年分别增加85.83%、82.79%和302.00%；标化DALY率和标化YLL率分别为2 
549.00/10万和2 
469.84/10万，较1990年分别下降33.22%和34.30%；标化YLD率为79.16/10万，较1990年增加37.17%。2016年男性DALY、YLL和YLD分别为42.88万人年、41.78万人年和1.10万人年；女性分别为24.24万人年、23.33万人年和0.91万人年。2016年不同恶性肿瘤中，DALY和YLL排名前3位的均分别为肺癌、肝癌和结直肠癌；YLD排名前3位分别为肺癌、结直肠癌和乳腺癌。2016年恶性肿瘤DALY负担最高的年龄段为50～69岁，为32.36万人年，占总DALY的48.21%，较1990年增加87.70%。 
结论： 
北京市恶性肿瘤疾病负担重，以过早死亡导致的疾病负担为主，伤残疾病负担增长迅速。疾病负担集中在50～69岁，且男性高于女性。肺癌居恶性肿瘤疾病负担首位。结直肠癌疾病负担增加。应从青少年开始培养良好的生活方式，加强肿瘤危险因素的预防与干预，加强高危人群早期筛查，规范患者治疗和康复指导。.

BACKGROUND: Aerobic exercise is currently considered to be an effective method 
of rehabilitation in breast cancer patients. Studies have shown that aerobic 
exercise after breast cancer surgery can improve upper limb function, 
cardiopulmonary function, and quality of life. Breast cancer rehabilitation 
guidelines encourage patients to actively participate in aerobic exercise to 
promote rehabilitation, the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of 
aerobic exercise on upper limb muscle strength and range of motion (ROM) 
following breast cancer treatment.
METHODS: Electronic databases (Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO 
and Embase) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published 
before September 1, 2019, using the search terms "aerobic exercise", "exercise", 
"breast cancer", "muscle strength", "strength", "flexibility" and "function". 
Grip strength and shoulder joint ROM were used to evaluate upper limb strength 
and upper limb flexibility respectively. All statistical tests were performed 
using RevMan5.3 software.
RESULTS: Nine RCTs (421 patients) were included for analysis, with JBI scores 
ranging from 19 to 23, and bias grade B for all studies among which, there were 
six studies reported change in grip strength, and five studies reported change 
in shoulder joint ROM. Meta-analysis showed a statistically significant 
difference in shoulder flexion ROM (MD =4.97, 95% CI: 0.47-9.46, P=0.03), 
shoulder abduction ROM (MD =8.95, 95% CI: 0.99-16.91, P=0.03), shoulder internal 
rotation ROM (MD =3.45, 95% CI: 1.80-5.09, P<0.0001), shoulder external rotation 
ROM (MD =7.69, 95% CI: 0.06-15.32, P=0.05) between the intervention and control 
groups following completion of the aerobic exercise intervention, while there 
were no significant improvement with respect to grip strength and shoulder 
extension ROM (P>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise could improve shoulder joint ROM in breast cancer 
survivors, but shows no obvious effect on the improvement of upper limb 
strength.

Incidental Diagnosis of Swyer-James-MacLeod Syndrome in a Military Pilot.

Harrison MF, Cowl CT.

BACKGROUND: Swyer-James-MacLeod syndrome (SJMS) is a specific form of 
bronchiolitis obliterans that occurs rarely, but represents recognized sequelae 
of common pediatric respiratory illness, and presents as unilateral hyperlucency 
on chest imaging. This case study describes such an incidental radiographic 
finding identified during the assessment of chest wall discomfort in a military 
pilot.CASE REPORT: A 35-yr-old military pilot presented to his flight surgeon 
with vague intermittent chest discomfort. Initial evaluation revealed an 
abnormal chest radiograph with unilateral hyperlucency and mild expiratory 
airflow limitation on pulmonary function testing. The evaluation also included 
computed tomography imaging with contrast infusion and echocardiography, though 
the presenting complaint had resolved. The airman was referred to our clinic for 
further evaluation and aeromedical recommendations regarding returning to flight 
duties. He was diagnosed with SJMS and recommended to be returned to flight 
duties.DISCUSSION: SJMS can be challenging to recognize to the untrained eye. An 
inflammatory response from viral or bacterial infection in childhood results in 
dysfunctional growth of the affected region of the lung, causing radiographic 
asymmetry. Although destruction of the alveoli and emphysema may occur, for most 
cases, there are minimal clinical sequelae. SJMS is not known to be progressive 
and is not associated with systemic conditions. The pilot likely had the 
abnormal chest radiograph at the time of commission and had not experienced any 
in-flight complications. His chest pain had resolved without intervention and 
SJMS was determined to be unlikely to impact his flight performance (such as 
response to supplemental oxygen) or life expectancy.Harrison MF, Cowl CT.

BACKGROUND: Preliminary studies using the FENIX™ (Torax Medical, Minneapolis, 
MN, USA) magnetic sphincter augmentation device suggest that it is safe to use 
for the treatment of adult faecal incontinence, but efficacy data are limited.
OBJECTIVE: To compare FENIX with sacral nerve stimulation for the treatment of 
adult faecal incontinence in terms of safety, efficacy, quality of life and 
cost-effectiveness.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicentre, parallel-group, unblinded, 
randomised trial comparing FENIX with sacral nerve stimulation in participants 
suffering moderate to severe faecal incontinence.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised on an equal basis to either sacral 
nerve stimulation or FENIX. Follow-up occurred 2 weeks postoperatively and at 6, 
12 and 18 months post randomisation.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The primary outcome was success, defined as device in 
use and ≥ 50% improvement in Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score at 18 months 
post randomisation. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, quality of 
life and cost-effectiveness. Between 30 October 2014 and 23 March 2017, 99 
participants were randomised across 18 NHS sites (50 participants to FENIX vs. 
49 participants to sacral nerve stimulation). The median time from randomisation 
to FENIX implantation was 57.0 days (range 4.0-416.0 days), and the median time 
from randomisation to permanent sacral nerve stimulation was 371.0 days (range 
86.0-918.0 days). A total of 45 out of 50 participants underwent FENIX 
implantation and 29 out of 49 participants continued to permanent sacral nerve 
stimulation. The following results are reported, excluding participants for whom 
the corresponding outcome was not evaluable. Overall, there was success for 10 
out of 80 (12.5%) participants, with no statistically significant difference 
between the two groups [FENIX 6/41 (14.6%) participants vs. sacral nerve 
stimulation 4/39 (10.3%) participants]. At least one postoperative complication 
was experienced by 33 out of 45 (73.3%) participants in the FENIX group and 9 
out of 40 (22.5%) participants in the sacral nerve stimulation group. A total of 
15 out of 50 (30%) participants in the FENIX group ultimately had to have their 
device explanted. Slightly higher costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(incremental = £305.50 and 0.005, respectively) were observed in the FENIX group 
than in the sacral nerve stimulation group. This was reversed over the lifetime 
horizon (incremental = -£1306 and -0.23 for costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years, respectively), when sacral nerve stimulation was the optimal option 
(net monetary benefit = -£3283), with only a 45% chance of FENIX being 
cost-effective.
LIMITATIONS: The SaFaRI study was terminated in 2017, having recruited 99 
participants of the target sample size of 350 participants. The study is, 
therefore, substantially underpowered to detect differences between the 
treatment groups, with significant uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness 
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The SaFaRI study revealed inefficiencies in the treatment pathways 
for faecal incontinence, particularly for sacral nerve stimulation. The success 
of both FENIX and sacral nerve stimulation was much lower than previously 
reported, with high postoperative morbidity in the FENIX group.
FUTURE WORK: Further research is needed to clarify the treatment pathways for 
sacral nerve stimulation and to determine its true clinical and 
cost-effectiveness.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN16077538.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research 
(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in 
Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 25, No. 18. See the NIHR Journals Library 
website for further project information.

Plain Language Summary: Faecal incontinence is a distressing condition for 
patients, and surgery is recommended if symptoms are having an effect on quality 
of life. One of the treatments recommended for faecal incontinence by the 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is sacral nerve stimulation, 
which aims to improve continence by stimulating the nerves to the back passage. 
A newer treatment involves surgery to implant a string of magnetic beads around 
the anal canal using the FENIX™ device (Torax Medical, Minneapolis, MN, USA). 
The aim of this study was to assess the benefits and risks of the FENIX device 
compared with sacral nerve stimulation. The SaFaRI study aimed to recruit 350 
participants with faecal incontinence, but was stopped early because of the 
manufacturer withdrawing the FENIX device for strategic reasons. In total, we 
recruited 99 participants. Fifty participants were allocated to receive the 
FENIX device and 49 participants were allocated to receive sacral nerve 
stimulation. The observed success rates with both devices were low: at 18 months 
following their entry into the study, 6 out of 41 (14.6%) participants in the 
FENIX group and 4 out of 39 (10.3%) participants in the sacral nerve stimulation 
group had the device both in use and producing a benefit. A total of 5 out of 50 
(10.0%) participants allocated to receive the FENIX device did not have a device 
implanted, and 15 out of 45 (33.3%) participants who did have the FENIX device 
implanted needed to have it removed because of complications during the 18-month 
follow-up period. A total of 21 out of 49 (42.9%) participants allocated to 
receive sacral nerve stimulation did not have a permanent sacral nerve 
stimulation device implanted, and 0 of the 28 who did have a permanent sacral 
nerve stimulation device implanted needed to have it removed during the 18-month 
follow-up period. The costs associated with the FENIX device were higher because 
of a greater number of participants experiencing complications, meaning that the 
FENIX device is unlikely to be cost-effective in the treatment of faecal 
incontinence compared with sacral nerve stimulation.

Leigh syndrome is a severe mitochondrial neurodegenerative disease with no 
effective treatment. In the Ndufs4-/- mouse model of Leigh syndrome, 
continuously breathing 11% O2 (hypoxia) prevents neurodegeneration and leads to 
a dramatic extension (~5-fold) in lifespan. We investigated the effect of 
hypoxia on the brain metabolism of Ndufs4-/- mice by studying blood gas tensions 
and metabolite levels in simultaneously sampled arterial and cerebral internal 
jugular venous (IJV) blood. Relatively healthy Ndufs4-/- and wildtype (WT) mice 
breathing air until postnatal age ~38 d were compared to Ndufs4-/- and WT mice 
breathing air until ~38 days old followed by 4-weeks of breathing 11% O2. 
Compared to WT control mice, Ndufs4-/- mice breathing air have reduced brain O2 
consumption as evidenced by an elevated partial pressure of O2 in IJV blood 
(PijvO2) despite a normal PO2 in arterial blood, and higher lactate/pyruvate 
(L/P) ratios in IJV plasma revealed by metabolic profiling. In Ndufs4-/- mice, 
hypoxia treatment normalized the cerebral venous PijvO2 and L/P ratios, and 
decreased levels of nicotinate in IJV plasma. Brain concentrations of 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) were lower in Ndufs4-/- mice breathing 
air than in WT mice, but preserved at WT levels with hypoxia treatment. Although 
mild hypoxia (17% O2) has been shown to be an ineffective therapy for Ndufs4-/- 
mice, we find that when combined with nicotinic acid supplementation it provides 
a modest improvement in neurodegeneration and lifespan. Therapies targeting both 
brain hyperoxia and NAD+ deficiency may hold promise for treating Leigh 
syndrome.

Recent advances in rapid medical detection and diagnostic technology have 
extended both human health and life expectancy. However, ageing remains one of 
the critical risk factors in contributing to major incapacitating and fatal 
conditions, including cancer and neurodegeneration. Therefore, it is vital to 
study how ageing attributes to (or participates in) endangering human health via 
infliction of age-related diseases and what must be done to tackle this 
intractable process. This review encompasses the most recent literature 
elaborating the role of cell competition (CC) during ageing. CC is a process 
that occurs between two heterogeneous populations, where the cells with higher 
fitness levels have a competitive advantage over the neighbouring cells that 
have comparatively lower fitness levels. This interaction results in the 
selection of the fit cells, within a population, and elimination of the viable 
yet suboptimal cells. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that, if this 
quality control mechanism works efficiently throughout life, can it ultimately 
lead to a healthier ageing and extended lifespan. Furthermore, the review aims 
to collate all the important state of the art publications that provides 
evidence of the relevance of CC in dietary restriction, stem cell dynamics, and 
cell senescence, thus, prompting us to advocate its contribution and in 
exploring new avenues and opportunities in fighting age-related conditions.
