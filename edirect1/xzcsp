In this study, chitosan coatings incorporated with propolis extract (PE) were 
utilized to extend the shelf-life of refrigerated Nemipterus japonicus fillets. 
Microbiological (total mesophilic bacteria (TMB) and total psychrotrophic count 
(TPC)), physicochemical (pH, total volatile bases nitrogen (TVB-N), 
2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), free fatty acid (FFA)) and 
sensory (color, odor and preference) characteristics of coated fillets were 
evaluated during 12days. The results showed that incorporating PE into chitosan 
solution could significantly (P<0.05) improve the quality of fish fillets. The 
results showed that the chitosan+PE samples reduced the extent of lipid 
oxidation, as judged by TBARS and FFA, suggesting that there is a synergistic 
effect between chitosan coating and propolis. Moreover, the application of 
chitosan coatings with PE improved the TVB-N and pH values of the Nemipterus 
japonicus samples significantly compared to untreated sample, thus extending the 
shelf life of Nemipterus japonicus fillet approximately >10days. All wrapped 
fillets in treatment samples incorporated with PE had lower bacterial counts 
compared to control (P<0.05). However, the bacterial counts of chitosan coating 
combined with PE were lower than those treated by chitosan or PE alone during 
the storage. The fillets treated with chitosan and PE had the best sensory 
properties. The increase (>10days) in the shelf-life was attributed to the 
antioxidant and antimicrobial characteristics of chitosan and PE. These results 
confirmed that chitosan coating enriched with PE can be an improving method to 
reducing deterioration of refrigerated Nemipterus japonicus fillets.

BACKGROUND: Significant unmet need exists for long-term treatment of moderate to 
severe atopic dermatitis (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of dupilumab in patients 
with AD.
METHODS: This ongoing, multicenter, open-label extension study (NCT01949311) 
evaluated long-term dupilumab treatment in adults who had previously 
participated in phase 1 through 3 clinical trials of dupilumab for AD. This 
analysis examined patients given 300 mg dupilumab weekly for up to 76 weeks at 
data cutoff (April 2016). Safety was the primary outcome; efficacy was also 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Of 1491 enrolled patients (1042.9 patient-years), 92.9% were receiving 
treatment at cutoff. The safety profile was consistent with previously reported 
trials (420.4 adverse events/100 patient-years and 8.5 serious adverse 
events/100 patient-years), with no new safety signals; common adverse events 
included nasopharyngitis, conjunctivitis, and injection-site reactions. 
Sustained improvement was seen up to 76 weeks in all efficacy outcomes, 
including measures of skin inflammation, pruritus, and quality of life.
LIMITATIONS: Lack of control arm, limited number of patients with 76 weeks or 
longer of treatment (median follow-up, 24 weeks), and patients not receiving the 
approved dose regimen of 300 mg every 2 weeks.
CONCLUSION: The safety and efficacy profile from this study supports the role of 
dupilumab as continuous long-term treatment for patients with moderate to severe 
AD.

DNA polymerase (pol) kappa is a Y-family translesion DNA polymerase conserved 
throughout all domains of life. Pol kappa is special6 ized for the ability to 
copy DNA containing minor groove DNA adducts, especially N2-dG adducts, as well 
as to extend primer termini containing DNA damage or mismatched base pairs. Pol 
kappa generally cannot copy DNA containing major groove modifications or 
UV-induced photoproducts. Pol kappa can also copy structured or non-B-form DNA, 
such as microsatellite DNA, common fragile sites, and DNA containing G 
quadruplexes. Thus, pol kappa has roles both in maintaining and compromising 
genomic integrity. The expression of pol kappa is altered in several different 
cancer types, which can lead to genome instability. In addition, many 
cancer-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been reported in the POLK 
gene, some of which are associated with poor survival and altered chemotherapy 
response. Because of this, identifying inhibitors of pol kappa is an active area 
of research. This review will address these activities of pol kappa, with a 
focus on lesion bypass and cellular mutagenesis.

The increased global market trend for food packaging is imposing new improved 
methods for the extension of shelf-life and quality of food products. Active 
packaging, which is based on the incorporation of additives into packaging 
materials, is becoming significant for this purpose. In this work, 
nanostructured low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was combined with chitosan (CS) 
to aim for a food packaging development with an increased oxygen permeability 
barrier and higher antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, essential oil extracts 
as rosemary (RO) and Melissa (MO) were added to this packaging matrix in order 
to improve its antioxidant properties and vanish food odor problems. The novel 
nanostructured active packaging film was tested using laboratory instrumental 
methods, such as thermogravimetry (TG), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) 
spectrometry, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, a dilatometer for tensile 
properties (DMA), and an oxygen permeation analyzer (OPA). Moreover, 
laboratorian tests according to ASTM standards were carried out for the 
estimation of water sorption, water vapor permeability, overall migration, and, 
finally, the antioxidant properties of such films. The experimental results have 
indicated that the final material exhibits advanced properties. More 
specifically, chitosan addition was observed to lead to an enhanced oxygen and 
water-vapor permeability barrier while the extracted essential oil addition led 
to enhanced tensile strength and antioxidant properties.

Hospice is a model of care that offers significant benefits to patients at the 
end of their lives, their families, and also to the primary care physicians who 
have diligently cared for their patients. As comprehensive care physicians, 
primary care physicians can benefit from a strong understanding of hospice and 
the Medicare Hospice Benefit. This article describes the history of hospice, 
palliative care versus hospice care, clinical appropriateness of the hospice 
patient, the regulatory guidelines of the Medicare Hospice Benefit, hospice 
reimbursement, primary care reimbursement, and employment opportunities in 
hospice.

BACKGROUND: It remains unclear whether patients with positive surgical margins 
or extracapsular extension benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy following radical 
prostatectomy.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and tolerability of adjuvant 
radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a randomised, open-label, 
parallel-group trial. A total of 250 patients were enrolled between April 2004 
and October 2012 in eight Finnish hospitals, with pT2 with positive margins or 
pT3a, pN0, M0 cancer without seminal vesicle invasion.
INTERVENTION: A total of 126 patients received adjuvant radiotherapy at 66.6Gy.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was 
biochemical recurrence-free survival, which we analysed using the Kaplan-Meier 
method and Cox proportional hazard regression. Overall survival, cancer-specific 
survival, local recurrence, and adverse events were secondary endpoints.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The median follow-up time for patients who were alive 
when the follow-up ended was 9.3yr in the adjuvant group and 8.6yr in the 
observation group. The 10-yr survival for biochemical recurrence was 82% in the 
adjuvant group and 61% in the observation group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.26 [95% 
confidence interval {CI} 0.14-0.48], p<0.001), and for overall survival 92% and 
87%, respectively (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.29-1.60], p=0.4). Two and four metastatic 
cancers occurred, respectively. Out of the 43 patients with biochemical 
recurrence in the observation group, 37 patients received salvage radiotherapy. 
In the adjuvant group, 56% experienced grade 3 adverse events, versus 40% in the 
observation group (p=0.016). Only one grade 4 adverse event occurred (adjuvant 
group). A limitation of this study was the number of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy is generally 
well tolerated and prolongs biochemical recurrence-free survival compared with 
radical prostatectomy alone in patients with positive margins or extracapsular 
extension.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Radiotherapy given immediately after prostate cancer surgery 
prolongs prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival, but causes more 
adverse events, when compared with surgery alone.

OBJECTIVE: The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network reported that left 
ventricular reverse remodeling at 2 years did not differ between patients with 
moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation randomized to coronary artery bypass 
grafting plus mitral valve repair (n = 150) or coronary artery bypass grafting 
alone (n = 151). To address health resource use implications, we compared costs 
and quality-adjusted survival.
METHODS: We used individual patient data from the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials 
Network trial on survival, hospitalizations, quality of life, and US 
hospitalization costs to estimate cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life 
years. A microsimulation model was developed to extrapolate to 10 years. 
Bootstrap and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to address 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: In-hospital costs were $59,745 for coronary artery bypass grafting plus 
mitral valve repair versus $51,326 for coronary artery bypass grafting alone 
(difference $8419; 95% uncertainty interval, 2259-18,757). Two-year costs were 
$81,263 versus $67,341 (difference 13,922 [2370 to 28,888]), and 
quality-adjusted life years were 1.35 versus 1.30 (difference 0.05; -0.04 to 
0.14), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$308,343/quality-adjusted life year for coronary artery bypass grafting plus 
mitral valve repair. At 10 years, its costs remained higher ($107,733 vs 
$88,583, difference 19,150 [-3866 to 56,826]) and quality-adjusted life years 
showed no difference (-0.92 to 0.87), with 5.08 versus 5.08. The likelihood that 
coronary artery bypass grafting plus mitral valve repair would be considered 
cost-effective at 10 years based on a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
$100K/quality-adjusted life year did not exceed 37%. Only when this procedure 
reduces the death rate by a relative 5% will the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio fall below $100K/quality-adjusted life year.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of mitral valve repair to coronary artery bypass 
grafting for patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation is unlikely to 
be cost-effective. Only if late mortality benefits can be demonstrated will it 
meet commonly used cost-effectiveness criteria.

Dietary restriction (DR) is a potent forerunner in aging studies capable of 
influencing lifespan and improving health in various model organisms even in 
their old age. Despite the importance of protein and carbohydrates in the diet 
(regulation of fecundity and body maintenance respectively), different ratio 
based combinations of these components has played a major role in lifespan 
extension studies. In spite of differences existing in dietary protocols across 
laboratories, diet manipulations have evolved as a major area of research in 
Drosophila lifespan studies, prominently shedding light on the multi-faceted 
process over the last two decades. Here, we review various advances and 
technicalities involved in understanding the DR-mediated lifespan alongside 
discussing the pros and cons of various existing approaches/diets used across 
labs. The current review also focuses on the importance of life-stage specific 
DR implementation and their influence on the life-history traits including 
lifespan and fecundity, by taking examples of results from different studies 
comprising diet dilution, calorie restriction, protein restriction, 
carbohydrate: protein ratios and the modulations in various minor diet 
components. We thereby intend to gather the major advances made in these fields 
alongside reviewing the practical implementations that need to be made to get a 
better view of the DR-mediated lifespan studies.

A population is considered stationary if the growth rate is zero and the age 
structure is constant. It thus follows that a population is considered 
non-stationary if either its growth rate is nonzero and/or its age structure is 
non-constant. We propose three properties that are related to the stationary 
population identity (SPI) of population biology by connecting it with stationary 
populations and non-stationary populations which are approaching stationarity. 
One of these important properties is that SPI can be applied to partition a 
population into stationary and non-stationary components. These properties 
provide deeper insights into cohort formation in real-world populations and the 
length of the duration for which stationary and non-stationary conditions hold. 
The new concepts are based on the time gap between the occurrence of stationary 
and non-stationary populations within the SPI framework that we refer to as 
Oscillatory SPI and the Amplitude of SPI.

BACKGROUND: More than 70 million people worldwide are estimated to have 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Emerging evidence indicates an association 
between HCV and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We aimed to determine 
the association between HCV and cardiovascular disease, and estimate the 
national, regional, and global burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to 
HCV.
METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, 
Embase, Ovid Global Health, and Web of Science databases from inception to May 
9, 2018, without language restrictions, for longitudinal studies that evaluated 
the risk ratio (RR) of cardiovascular disease in people with HCV compared with 
those without HCV. Two investigators independently reviewed and extracted data 
from published reports. The main outcome was cardiovascular disease, defined as 
hospital admission with, or mortality from, acute myocardial infarction or 
stroke. We calculated the pooled RR of cardiovascular disease associated with 
HCV using a random-effects model. Additionally, we calculated the population 
attributable fraction and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) from 
HCV-associated cardiovascular disease at the national, regional, and global 
level. We also used age-stratified and sex-stratified HCV prevalence estimates 
and cardiovascular DALYs for 100 countries to estimate country-level burden 
associated with HCV. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number 
CRD42018091857.
FINDINGS: Our search identified 16 639 records, of which 36 studies were 
included for analysis, including 341 739 people with HCV. The pooled RR for 
cardiovascular disease was 1·28 (95% CI 1·18-1·39). Globally, 1·5 million (95% 
CI 0·9-2·1) DALYs per year were lost due to HCV-associated cardiovascular 
disease. Low-income and middle-income countries had the highest disease burden 
with south Asian, eastern European, north African, and Middle Eastern regions 
accounting for two-thirds of all HCV-associated cardiovascular DALYs.
INTERPRETATION: HCV infection is associated with an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease. The global burden of cardiovascular disease associated 
with HCV infection was responsible for 1·5 million DALYs, with the highest 
burden in low-income and middle-income countries.

In this work, an antifouling electrochemiluminescent (ECL) ratiometric biosensor 
is designed for the accurate, selective and sensitive detection of DNA 
methyltransferase (MTase) activity based on a dual-signaling strategy. Briefly, 
an ITO electrode is used to construct the anti-fouling interfaces with the 
modification of polyaniline (PANI), AuNPs and peptide. Hairpin DNA molecules 
containing the symmetric sequence of 5'-CATC-3' are attached onto the modified 
ITO electrode and the ds-DNA can be cut off in the presence of Dam MTase and 
DpnI. The residual DNA and two hairpin DNA could lead to the extension of ds-DNA 
due to the Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR). ECL signal is amplified 
significantly with the insertion of PTC-NH2 molecules into the dsDNA grooves. 
The ECLPTC-NH2/ECLAu@luminol is found in a logarithmic linear relation with the 
concentration of Dam MTase. Moreover, owing to the presence of antifouling 
peptide on the sensing interface, the ECL biosensor was capable of sensing MTase 
activity in complex biological media, such as FBS samples and human serum with 
significantly reduced nonspecific adsorption effect. Assaying Dam MTase in 
complex sample mixture containing 5% calf serum and 5% human serum further 
proved the feasibility of this ECL biosensor for early clinical diagnosis.

PM2.5-bound toxic metals (TMs) are derived from various sources, and they can 
cause many adverse health effects on the human body. To effectively reduce the 
disease burden of TMs by controlling the relative sources, an integrated 
approach of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and source-apportionment 
(positive matrix factorization, PMF) was proposed and applied to some typical 
diseases induced by TMs in 2017 in Beijing. The estimation included two parts; 
first, the number of potentially affected people was calculated based on the 
source mass contribution from PMF and the inhalation unit risk of TMs; second, 
the QALYs lost per affected person was calculated based on the disease duration, 
expected years of life lost (EYLL) and quality of life (QoL) for both affected 
people and the general population. The results showed that QALYs lost per person 
for renal cancer (17.3 QALYs), pneumonia (14.4 QALYs), lung cancer (14.2 QALYs), 
skin cancer (12.7 QALYs) and diabetes mellitus (12.6 QALYs) were higher than 
those for other diseases. Combined with PMF, the source contributions to the 
overall burden of typical diseases from the TMs followed the order of coal 
combustion (50.2%) > vehicle emissions (24.4%) > fuel oil combustion 
(11.4%) > Cr-related industry (10.9%) > resuspended dust (3.0%). The rank was 
further compared with that assessed for noncancer and cancer risks, and we 
verified the reasonability of the QALYs method. For seasonal contributions to 
coal combustion, winter and spring had the highest contributions, which 
coincided with the fact that coal was the main fuel for heating in Beijing. The 
QALYs lost attributed to TMs for coal combustion decreased by 49.1% from 2016 to 
2017, which may indicate an effective policy associated with coal control. 
Overall, the integrated approach was successfully employed for estimating the 
disease burden induced by TMs from each source and was an effective solution to 
identify the control rank of sources for TM reduction.

Objective: To evaluate the cost-utility of different immunization strategies for 
rabies in China, and to provide a reference for determining the optimal 
immunization strategy. Methods: The system dynamics model was used to simulate 
the epidemic of canine rabies and a decision tree model was conducted to 
analysis different immune strategies. Relevant probabilities were obtained 
through literature search and on-site investigation. Sensitivity analysis was 
used to explore the important influenced factors. Results: At baseline, from a 
social perspective, 70% vaccination of dogs was the optimal strategy compared to 
current vaccination strategy (43% vaccination in dogs, human category-Ⅱ exposure 
vaccination/category-Ⅲ exposure vaccination combined with RIG). The total cost 
was 14 084 354 CNY, and the total utility value was 22 078 616.23 QALYs, and the 
incremental cost-utility ratio was-62 148 147 CNY/QALY; if human vaccination was 
considered, 55% vaccination of dogs combined with strategy one was the optimal 
strategy, its incremental cost-utility ratio was-444 620 557 CNY/QALY. The 
probability that an injured dog carries rabies virus was the most sensitive 
parameter. When it was greater than 0.005 03, strategy four was the optimal 
strategy. When it was less than 82/100 000, strategy one was the optimal 
strategy; when it was between 82/100 000 and 120/100 000, strategy two was the 
optimal strategy; when it was between 120/100 000 and 503/100 000, strategy two 
was the optimal strategy. Conclusion: It was conducive to increase the 
vaccination coverage of canine for the prevention and control of rabies.

Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with colorectal cancer are older. For 
surgeons dealing with older patients, it is important to recognize patients that 
are frail and have an increased risk of complications and mortality. In this 
review, we will go through pre-treatment assessment, peri-operative management, 
as well as discharge planning and rehabilitation.
METHODS: This review is based on searching the literature for studies regarding 
colorectal cancer, frailty, cognition, patient preferences and geriatric 
assessment as well as the academic and clinical experience of the authors.
RESULTS: In the pre-treatment assessment, surgeons need to consider capacity to 
consent, patient preferences, frailty and life-expectancy, risk of 
complications, and whether the patient can be optimized before surgery. Then, 
the patient and treatment options should be discussed at a multidisciplinary 
team meeting. When the patient is admitted for surgery, discharge planning 
should start immediately, and if complications such as delirium or falls occur, 
the patient should be co-managed with geriatric services.
CONCLUSION: Frail older adults with colorectal cancer need a tailored approach 
from pre-treatment assessment until discharge after surgery, and co-management 
with a geriatrician is recommended. If this is not possible, surgeons treating 
frail older patients may improve care by adapting some geriatric principles.

BACKGROUND: Rationale exists for combined treatment with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in a variety of 
solid tumours. This study aimed to investigate the safety and antitumour effects 
of pamiparib, an oral PARP 1/2 inhibitor, combined with tislelizumab, a 
humanised anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with advanced solid tumours 
and to determine the optimum doses for further evaluation.
METHODS: We did a multicentre, open-label, phase 1a/b study at five academic 
sites or community oncology centres in Australia. We recruited adults (aged ≥18 
years) with advanced solid tumours who had received one or more previous lines 
of therapy, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 1 or 
less, and a life expectancy of 12 weeks or more. Patients were enrolled into one 
of five dose-escalation cohorts, with dose-escalation done in a 3 + 3 design. 
Cohorts 1-3 received intravenous tislelizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks plus 20, 40, 
or 60 mg oral pamiparib twice daily, respectively; cohorts 4 and 5 received 200 
mg intravenous tislelizumab every 3 weeks plus 40 or 60 mg oral pamiparib twice 
daily, respectively. The primary endpoints of the phase 1a dose-escalation part 
of the study were safety and tolerability, including the occurrence of 
dose-limiting toxicities and determination of the maximum tolerated dose and 
recommended phase 2 dose. All primary endpoints were analysed in the safety 
analysis set, which included all patients who received at least one dose of 
tislelizumab or pamiparib, with the exception of the occurrence of dose-limiting 
toxicities, which was analysed in the dose-limiting toxicity analysis set, which 
included all patients who received at least 90% of the first scheduled 
tislelizumab dose and at least 75% of scheduled pamiparib doses, or who had a 
dose-limiting toxicity event during cycle 1. Reported here are results of the 
phase 1a dose-escalation stage of the trial. This trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02660034, and is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 22, 2016, and May 16, 2017, we enrolled 49 patients 
(median age 63 years [IQR 55-67]), all of whom received at least one dose of 
pamiparib or tiselzumab. Four patients had dose-limiting toxicities (intractable 
grade 2 nausea [n=1] and grade 3 rash [n=1] in cohort 4, and grade 2 nausea and 
vomiting [n=1] and grade 4 immune-mediated hepatitis [n=1] in cohort 5). The 
recommended phase 2 dose was tislelizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks plus pamiparib 40 
mg twice daily (the dose given in cohort 4). The most common treatment-emergent 
adverse events were nausea (in 31 [63%] of 49 patients), fatigue (26 [53%]), 
diarrhoea (17 [35%]), and vomiting (15 [31%]). 23 (47%) of 49 patients had 
immune-related adverse events, of whom nine (39%) had asymptomatic grade 3-4 
hepatic immune-related adverse events, which were reversible with corticosteroid 
treatment. The most common adverse event of grade 3 or worse severity was 
anaemia (in six [12%] patients) and no grade 5 adverse events were reported. 
Hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis was the only serious adverse event to occur in 
two or more patients (in four [8%] patients). At a median follow-up of 8·3 
months (IQR 4·8-12·8), ten (20%) of 49 patients achieved an objective response 
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1, 
including two complete responses and eight partial responses.
INTERPRETATION: Pamiparib with tislelizumab was generally well tolerated and 
associated with antitumour responses and clinical benefit in patients with 
advanced solid tumours supporting further investigation of the combination of 
pamiparib with tislelizumab.

Management of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis in a pediatric 
population: A scoping review.

House, Bournemouth, UK.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) negatively impacts 
the quality of life for children with the condition. Although up to 2% of 
children have CFS/ME, the bulk of research investigates adults with CFS/ME. 
Using the PRISMA extension for a scoping review and the work of Arksey and 
O'Malley (2005), a scoping review was conducted of all relevant peer-reviewed 
research investigating nutrition, exercise, and psychosocial factors within a 
pediatric population diagnosed with CFS/ME. Key themes found were nutrition and 
dietary components, exercise therapy, psychosocial factors, and multifaceted 
treatment. Nutrition was explored on its own as a tool to decrease symptoms; 
however, there were very few studies found to examine nutritional deficiency or 
treatment with those under the age of 18. Graded exercise and resistance 
training improved fatigue severity and symptoms of depression in adolescents 
with CFS/ME. Research exploring psychosocial factors of CFS/ME presented 
attributes that could lead to being diagnosed as well as barriers to treatment. 
The multifaceted treatment undertaken typically consists of graded 
activities/exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, nutritional advice, and 
family sessions. This has shown to increase school attendance and decrease the 
severity of the fatigue for adolescents. Minimal literature exploring CFS/ME 
within a prepubescent population presents the need for further research.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease, involves 
the rapid deterioration of motor neurons resulting in severe muscle atrophy and 
respiratory insufficiency. It is considered a "multisystemic" disease with many 
potential mechanisms responsible for its pathology. Currently, there is no cure 
for ALS. Exercise training is suggested as a potential approach to reduce ALS 
pathology, but its beneficial role remains controversial. This review provides 
an overview of the effects of exercise training in ALS-affected mice and 
patients. It will compare the intensity, duration, and type of exercise on the 
health of SOD1G93A mice, a mouse model of familial ALS, and review clinical 
studies involving ALS patients undergoing both endurance and resistance 
training. In summary, mild-to-moderate swimming-based endurance training appears 
the most advantageous mode of exercise in SOD1G93A mice, improving animal 
survival, and delaying the onset and progression of disease. Furthermore, 
clinical studies show that both endurance and resistance training have an 
advantageous impact on the quality of life of ALS patients without extending 
life expectancy. However, small sample sizes, non-representative control 
populations, heterogeneous disease stage of patients, and the presence of 
confounders often exist in the exercise studies conducted with ALS patients. 
This raises concerns about the interpretation of these findings and, therefore, 
these results should be considered with caution. While promising, more 
pre-clinical and clinical studies with improved experimental design and fewer 
limitations are still necessary to confirm the impact of exercise training on 
the health of ALS patients.
