healthcare services. The causality and cointegration analyses reveal that 
economic freedom and educational attainment are significant factors underlying 
life expectancy in the short and long term. However, educational attainment is 
found to be more effective on life expectancy than economic freedom. The 
findings have important implications for educational and health policies in 
analyzed countries. Governments must understand the education-health 
relationship to be able to develop and promote educational policies that have 
the potential to improve public health.

Climacteric fruits continue to ripen after harvest and produce ethylene, coupled 
with an increase in respiration rate, which contributes to more rapid 
perishability. Inhibition of ethylene biosynthesis has been shown to be an 
efficient way to delay the onset of ripening and lengthen shelf life. The use of 
edible materials as coatings presents an efficient approach in preserving the 
quality of fruits. Edible coatings have many benefits, such as affordability, 
ease of application, and use of natural ingredients. Nanotechnology provides 
interesting approaches to the management of fruit shelf life after harvest. 
Nanotechnology has the capacity of producing new materials by minimizing the 
size of components to a nanometric level. These kinds of nanomaterials possess 
distinct and improved properties for delaying fruit ripening and decay. The main 
goal of adding nanoparticles to edible coatings is to enhance the biopolymer's 
mechanical and water vapor barrier properties. Nanoparticles also contain 
biopolymer-like features and are thought to have superior antibacterial, 
antifungal, and antiviral properties than edible coatings. This review is aimed 
at summarizing recent findings on the application of edible coatings in the form 
of nanoparticles, and their effect on quality parameters and shelf life 
extension of climacteric fruits. Peer-reviewed articles were obtained by using 
Scopus and science direct. The current materials widely used for coating 
climacteric fruits are zinc, silver and chitosan nanoparticles. Zinc 
nanoparticles have been shown to be more effective in delaying ripening 
significantly by reducing weight and moisture loss and ensuring retention of 
fruit firmness. Further research is needed to understand their effect on other 
physicochemical properties of fruits.

DNA adenine N6-methylation (6mA) plays a critical role in various biological 
functions, but its occurrence and functions in filamentous plant pathogens are 
largely unexplored. Botrytis cinerea is an important pathogenic fungus 
worldwide. A systematic analysis of 6mA in B. cinerea was performed in this 
study, revealing that 6mA is widely distributed in the genome of this fungus. 
The 2 kb regions flanking many genes, particularly the upstream promoter 
regions, were susceptible to methylation. The role of BcMettl4, a 6mA 
methyltransferase, in the virulence of B. cinerea was investigated. BcMETTL4 
disruption and point mutations of its catalytic motif "DPPW" both resulted in 
significant 6mA reduction in the genomic DNA and in reduced virulence of B. 
cinerea. RNA-Seq analysis revealed a total of 13 downregulated genes in the 
disruption mutant ΔBcMettl4 in which methylation occurred at the promoter sites. 
These were involved in oxidoreduction, secretory pathways, autophagy and 
carbohydrate metabolism. Two of these genes, BcFDH and BcMFS2, were 
independently disrupted. Knockout of BcFDH led to reduced sclerotium formation, 
while disruption of BcMFS2 resulted in dramatically decreased conidium formation 
and pathogenicity. These observations indicated that 6mA provides potential 
epigenetic markers in B. cinerea and that BcMettl4 regulates virulence in this 
important plant pathogen.

Rhizosphere colonization is a pre-requisite for the favorable application of 
plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Exchange and mutual recognition of 
signaling molecules occur frequently between plants and microbes. Here, the 
luciferase luxAB gene was electrotransformed into the phosphate-solubilizing 
strain Pseudomonas sp. WS32, a type of plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium 
with specific affinity for wheat. A labeled WS32 strain (WS32-L) was applied to 
determine the temporal and spatial traits of colonization within the wheat 
rhizosphere using rhizoboxes experimentation under natural condition. The 
effects of colonization on wheat root development and seedling growth were 
evaluated, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to explore the 
transcriptional changes that occur in wheat roots under WS32 colonization. The 
results showed that WS32-L could survive in the wheat rhizosphere for long 
periods and could expand into new zones following wheat root extension. 
Significant increases in seedling fresh and dry weight, root fresh and dry 
weight, root surface area, number of root tips, and phosphorus accumulation in 
the wheat leaves occurred in response to WS32 rhizosphere colonization. RNA-seq 
analysis showed that a total of 1485 genes in wheat roots were differentially 
expressed between the inoculated conditions and the uninoculated conditions. 
Most of the transcriptional changes occurred for genes annotated to the 
following functional categories: "phosphorus and other nutrient transport," 
"hormone metabolism and organic acid secretion," "flavonoid signal recognition," 
"membrane transport," and "transcription factor regulation." These results are 
therefore valuable to future studies focused on the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the growth-promoting activities of PGPR on their host plants.

Hemiplegia is a common dysfunction caused by the brain stroke and leads to 
movement disability. Although the lateralization of movement-related potential, 
the event-related desynchronization, and more complicated inter-regional 
information coupling have been investigated, seldom studies have focused on 
investigating the dynamic information exchanging among multiple brain regions 
during motor execution for post-stroke hemiplegic patients. With high 
temporal-resolution electroencephalogram (EEG), the time-varying network is able 
to reflect the dynamical complex network modalities corresponding to the 
movements at a millisecond level. In our present study, the wrist extension 
experiment was designed, along with related EEG datasets being collected. 
Thereafter, the corresponding time-varying networks underlying the wrist 
extension were accordingly constructed by adopting the adaptive directed 
transfer function and then statistically explored, to further uncover the 
dynamic network deficits (i.e., motor dysfunction) in post-stroke hemiplegic 
patients. Results of this study found the effective connectivity between the 
stroked motor area and other areas decreased in patients when compared to 
healthy controls; on the contrary, the enhanced connectivity between non-stroked 
motor areas and other areas, especially the frontal and parietal-occipital 
lobes, were further identified for patients during their accomplishing the 
designed wrist extension, which might dynamically compensate for the deficited 
patients' motor behaviors. These findings not only helped deepen our knowledge 
of the mechanism underlying the patients' motor behaviors, but also facilitated 
the real-time strategies for clinical therapy of brain stroke, as well as 
providing a reliable biomarker to predict the future rehabilitation.

Twenty percent of patients with high-tumor-burden (HTB) follicular lymphoma (FL) 
develop progression/relapse of disease (POD) within 24 months of frontline 
immunochemotherapy. Unfortunately, about 50% of these patients die within 5 
years since POD event. Rituximab maintenance was proven to reduce relapse rate 
in responding FL, but its role on preventing POD was not defined. We analyzed 
1360 HTB-FL patients from the Czech Lymphoma Study Group registry treated with 
frontline rituximab-containing regimen. Of those, 950 cases received rituximab 
plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) and 
achieved complete or partial remission: 712 patients received rituximab 
maintenance (MAINT) and 238 were a historical observational cohort (OBS). We 
have proposed a modified POD24 (mPOD24) endpoint for the chemosensitive patients 
calculated from the end-of-induction (EOI). Survival rates since EOI were as 
follows: 5-year overall survival (OS) 86.2% versus 94.5% in the OBS and MAINT 
groups, respectively (P < .001) and 5-year progression-free survival 58.5% (OBS) 
and 75.4% (MAINT) (P < .001). The Cox proportional hazards model showed a 
decrease in mPOD24 incidence in the MAINT group with the overall hazard rate 
reduced by 56% (hazard ratio = 0.44; P < .001). The cumulative incidence of 
mPOD24 was reduced from 24.1% in OBS to 10.1% in MAINT (P < .001). Comparison of 
non-mPOD24 cases showed OS similar to that in the general population. Rituximab 
maintenance given after R-CHOP resulted in a 2.4-fold reduction in mPOD24 
incidence. Once the non-POD24 status is achieved, FL does not shorten the 
patients' life expectancy.

Studies of the relationship between income inequality and life expectancy often 
speculate about the role of policy, but direct empirical research is limited. 
Drawing on the neo-materialist perspective, we examine whether the longitudinal 
association between income inequality and life expectancy is mediated and 
moderated by policy liberalism in U.S. states (2000-2014). More liberal policy 
contexts are characterized by greater efforts to regulate the economy, 
redistribute income, and protect vulnerable groups and lesser efforts to 
penalize deviant social behavior. We find that state-level income inequality is 
inversely associated with policy liberalism and life expectancy. The association 
between income inequality and life expectancy was not mediated by policy 
liberalism but was moderated by it. The association is attenuated in states with 
more liberal policy contexts, supporting the neo-materialist perspective. This 
finding illustrates how states like New York and California (with liberal policy 
contexts) can exhibit high income inequality and high life expectancy.

The Missing Mortality Advantage for European Immigrants to the United States in 
the Early Twentieth Century.

Bakhtiari E(1).

Author information:

Immigrant populations typically have lower mortality rates and longer life 
expectancies than their nonimmigrant counterparts. This immigrant mortality 
advantage has been a recurrent finding in demographic and population health 
research focused on contemporary waves of immigration. However, historical data 
suggest that European immigrants to the United States in the early twentieth 
century had worse health and higher rates of mortality, yet it remains unclear 
why a mortality advantage was absent for immigrants during this period. This 
article combines Vital Statistics records and Lee-Carter mortality models to 
analyze mortality by nativity status for the U.S. White population from 1900 to 
1960, examining variation by age, sex, time, and place. Contrary to contemporary 
expectations of a foreign-born mortality advantage, White immigrants had higher 
mortality rates in the early 1900s, with the largest foreign-born disadvantage 
among the youngest and oldest populations. Although foreign-born and U.S.-born 
White mortality rates trended toward convergence over time, the foreign-born 
mortality penalty remained into the 1950s. A decomposition analysis finds that 
immigrants' concentration in cities, which had higher rates of infectious 
disease mortality, accounted for nearly half of the nativity difference in 1900, 
and this place effect declined in subsequent decades. Additional evidence, such 
as a spike in mortality inequalities during the 1918 influenza pandemic, 
suggests that common explanations for the immigrant mortality advantage may be 
less influential in a context of high risk from infectious disease.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate associations of muscle 
quality indices with joint-level power-related measures in the knee extensors of 
thirty-two older males (65-88 years).
METHODS: Muscle quality indices included: echo intensity, ratio of 
intracellular- to total water content (ICW/TW), and specific muscle strength. 
Echo intensity was acquired from the rectus femoris (EIRF) and vastus lateralis 
(EIVL) by ultrasonography. ICW/TW was computed from electrical resistance of the 
right thigh obtained by bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy. Specific muscle 
strength was determined as the normalized maximal voluntary isometric knee 
extension (MVIC) torque to estimated knee extensor volume. Isotonic maximal 
effort knee extensions with a load set to 20% MVIC torque were performed to 
obtain the knee extension power-related measures (peak power, rate of power 
development [RPD], and rate of velocity development [RVD]). Power and RPD were 
normalized to MVIC.
RESULTS: There were no significant correlations between muscle quality indices 
except between EIRF and EIVL (|r|≤ 0.253, P ≥ 0.162). EIRF was negatively 
correlated with normalized RPD and RVD (r ≤  - 0.361, P ≤ 0.050). ICW/TW was 
positively correlated with normalized peak power (r = 0.421, P = 0.020). 
Specific muscle strength was positively correlated with absolute peak power and 
RPD (r ≥ 0.452, P ≤ 0.012).
CONCLUSION: Knee extension power-related measures were lower in participants 
with higher EI, lower ICW/TW, and lower specific muscle strength, but the muscle 
quality indices may be determined by independent physiological characteristics.

BACKGROUND: Patients diagnosed with metastatic cancer have shortened life 
expectancy with questionable benefit of routine screening mammography (SM). The 
aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and consequences of continued SM 
in the setting of reduced survival from stage IV non-breast cancer.
METHODS: Women diagnosed with Stage IV non-breast cancer at a single institution 
from 2015 to 2019 were queried from the institutional tumor registry for 
demographics, stage IV cancer diagnosis, and survival. Incidence and timing of 
SM after stage IV diagnosis and further diagnostic workup were extracted from 
the medical record.
RESULTS: 790 women with Stage IV non-breast cancer were identified, 109 (14%) 
had at least 1 SM, 23% required diagnostic mammography, 7% breast biopsy, and 1% 
breast surgery. No breast cancers were identified. SM was ordered most often in 
stage IV gynecological cancers (28%), with more common cancers still seeing a 
high percentage of patients screened (lung 10%, colorectal 15%). Study 3-year 
survival was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI] 23-30%), with 74% mortality 
during follow up and median time from Stage IV diagnosis to death of 1.2 years 
(CI 0.4-2.3 years). Of patients screened, 41/109 died within 2 years of 
undergoing SM.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite low overall survival for patients diagnosed with metastatic 
non-breast cancer, 14% of women underwent SM which resulted in additional 
imaging, biopsies, and surgery with no new breast cancers identified. Continued 
SM in this population offers risk without benefit of reduced breast cancer 
mortality and should no longer continue in women with stage IV non-breast 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Sexual minority men are disproportionately affected by HIV. Medical 
advances in HIV treatment have extended life expectancy, and as this group ages, 
medical and psychological challenges become more prominent. Older people with 
HIV experience a higher incidence of cancer and other comorbidities; these 
burdens along with sexual minority stress can strain coping resources and 
diminish health-related quality of life. Interventions such as cognitive 
behavioral stress and self-management (CBSM) can mitigate some of this burden; 
however, no manualized, eHealth-based interventions have focused on the unique 
needs of sexual minority men living with HIV and cancer.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to refine and finalize a web-based, CBSM-based 
intervention to meet the unique needs of this population, including sexual 
health, comanagement of 2 chronic conditions, and coping with sexual minority 
stress.
METHODS: This mixed methods study used a previously completed qualitative phase 
(n=6) to inform the development of a web-based platform and intervention called 
SmartManage. The pilot phase study (n=50) involved randomization (1:1) into 
either 10 sessions of adapted CBSM or an attention control health promotion. 
Both conditions used the SmartManage platform, a web-based eHealth program 
designed to deliver CBSM and health promotion content and host live groups. 
Feasibility and acceptability (eg, rates of participant engagement and 
retention) were the primary outcomes.
RESULTS: Participant-related activities are expected to be completed by November 
2022, and results are expected to be submitted for publication by February 2023.
CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that participants would find the intervention 
acceptable (compared with engagement and retention rates observed in similar 
CBSM studies). We also hypothesize that participants receiving the SmartManage 
intervention would have reduced symptom burden and improved health-related 
quality of life before and after treatment compared with those who do not.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to important indirect health and social 
harms in addition to deaths and morbidity due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These 
indirect impacts, such as increased depression and substance abuse, can have 
persistent effects over the life course. Estimated health and cost outcomes of 
such conditions and mitigation strategies may guide public health responses.
METHODS: We developed a cost-effectiveness framework to evaluate societal costs 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to six health-related indirect 
effects of COVID-19 in California. Short- and long-term outcomes were evaluated 
for the adult population. We identified one evidence-based mitigation strategy 
for each condition and estimated QALYs gained, intervention costs, and savings 
from averted health-related harms. Model data were derived from literature 
review, public data, and expert opinion.
RESULTS: Pandemic-associated increases in prevalence across these six conditions 
were estimated to lead to over 192,000 QALYs lost and to approach $7 billion in 
societal costs per million population over the life course of adults. The 
greatest costs and QALYs lost per million adults were due to adult depression. 
All mitigation strategies assessed saved both QALYs and costs, with five 
strategies achieving savings within one year. The greatest net savings over 10 
years would be achieved by addressing depression ($242 million) and excessive 
alcohol use ($107 million).
DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is leading to significant human suffering and 
societal costs due to its indirect effects. Policymakers have an opportunity to 
reduce societal costs and health harms by implementing mitigation strategies.

BACKGROUND: High prevalence of diabetes has been reported in the Americas, but 
no comprehensive analysis of diabetes burden and related factors for the region 
is available. We aimed to describe the burden of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and 
that of hyperglycaemia in the Americas from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: We used estimates from GBD 2019 to evaluate the burden of diabetes in 
adults aged 20 years or older and high fasting plasma glucose in adults aged 25 
years or older in the 39 countries and territories of the six regions in the 
Americas from 1990 to 2019. The main source to estimate the mortality 
attributable to diabetes and to chronic kidney disease due to diabetes was vital 
registration. Mortality due to overall diabetes (ie, diabetes and diabetes due 
to chronic kidney disease) was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble 
model. Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated as the number of deaths 
multiplied by standard life expectancy at the age that the death occurred, years 
lived with disability (YLDs) were estimated based on the prevalence and severity 
of complications of diabetes. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were 
estimated as a sum of YLDs and YLLs. We assessed the association of diabetes 
burden with the level of development of a country (according to the 
Socio-demographic Index), health-care access and quality (estimated with the 
Healthcare Access and Quality Index), and diabetes prevalence. We also 
calculated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of diabetes burden due to 
each of its risk factors. We report the 95% uncertainty intervals for all 
estimates.
FINDINGS: In 2019, an estimated total of 409 000 (95% uncertainty interval 
373 000-443 000) adults aged 20 years or older in the Americas died from 
diabetes, which represented 5·9% of all deaths. Diabetes was responsible for 
2266 (1930-2649) crude DALYs per 100 000 adults in the Americas, and high 
fasting plasma glucose for 4401 DALYs (3685-5265) per 100 000 adults, with large 
variation across regions. DALYs were mostly due to type 2 diabetes and 
distribution was heterogeneous, being highest in central Latin America and the 
Caribbean and lowest in high-income North America and southern Latin America. 
Between 1990 and 2019, age-standardised DALYs due to type 2 diabetes increased 
27·4% (22·0-32·5). This increase was particularly high in Andean Latin America 
and high-income North America. Burden for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes across 
countries increased with higher diabetes prevalence and decreased with greater 
Socio-demographic and Healthcare Access and Quality Indices. Main risk factors 
for the burden were high BMI, with a PAF of 63·2% and dietary risks, with a PAF 
of 27·5%. The fraction of burden due to disability has increased since 1990 and 
now represents nearly half of the overall burden in 2019.
INTERPRETATION: The burden of diabetes in the Americas is large, increasing, 
heterogeneous, and expanding. To confront the rising burden, population-based 
interventions aimed to reduce type 2 diabetes risk and strengthening health 
systems to provide effective and cost-efficient care for those affected are 
mandatory.

OBJECTIVES: To map the randomized trial evidence describing the feasibility of 
discontinuing active medications with potential adverse effects in older 
patients.
DESIGN: Scoping review with systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane 
Library.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized trials investigating discontinuation of a 
single medicine or medicine class in patients with mean age ≥65 years.
METHODS: We extracted trial characteristics including study design and assessed 
bias. As proxies for the "feasibility of discontinuation," we extracted the 
"dropout rate" and "disease recurrence rate."
RESULTS: We identified 40 trials investigating discontinuation of symptomatic 
(n = 26), preventive (n = 6), or both preventive and symptomatic medicines (n = 
8) against psychiatric (n = 10), neurologic (n = 9), musculoskeletal (n = 8), 
cardiovascular (n = 5), respiratory (n = 4), and urologic diseases (n = 4). Five 
discontinuation designs were used, 75% (30/40) of trials were 
placebo-controlled, and 48% (19/40) of trials had bias disfavoring 
discontinuation. The dropout rate was similar between the discontinuation group 
and the continuation group in 79% of the trials (30/38), whereas disease 
recurrence was similar in 72% (23/32) of the trials. In 42% (13/31) of trials 
reporting both dropout rate and disease recurrence rate, the differences between 
groups were statistically insignificant and less than 10%; these trials 
investigated discontinuation of cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's 
disease in various settings (n = 3), alendronate for osteoporosis (n = 3), 
glucosamine for osteoarthritis, lithium as adjunct for unipolar depression, 
statins for cardiovascular disease in patients with limited life expectancy, 
droxidopa for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, tamsulosin for lower urinary 
tract symptoms, sertraline for major depressive episode, and fentanyl patch for 
low back or osteoarthritis pain.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We identified 40 randomized trials using a variety 
of designs investigating discontinuation of both symptomatic and preventive 
medicines in older patients. Discontinuation of medicines seems feasible for 
most of the investigated medicines. This scoping review can guide clinical 
practice and future trials on deprescribing.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease in which mutations in the gene 
encoding for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein result in a 
multisystem disease dominated by digestive and respiratory manifestations. In 
the mid-20th century, CF caused death within the first years of life. Over the 
past decades, advances in disease management, which includes systematic neonatal 
screening, multidisciplinary symptomatic CF care, lung transplantation and, more 
recently, highly effective CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators, 
have transformed the prognosis of people with CF markedly. In most countries 
with well-established CF care, adults now outnumber children, and life 
expectancy is expected to increase further, narrowing the survival gap with the 
general population. However, marked differences in the prognosis of CF exist not 
only among high-, low-, and middle-income countries but also among high-income 
countries, based on the presence and quality of a specialized CF care provision 
network. Current evidence suggests that differences in patient clinical status 
and survival could be attributable not only to intrinsic disease severity but 
also to disparities in access to high-quality specialized care. Because CF is 
generally a progressive disease, adults with CF often show increased pulmonary 
severity and complications and increased occurrence of comorbidities, which 
highlights the need for specialized adult CF centers. This article seeks to 
describe the evolution of CF demography over the past decades, predict future 
trends, and anticipate the future provision of adult CF care.

The aim of this study is to report the case of a 4-month-old Beagle dog 
diagnosed with Musladin-Lueke syndrome. The dog appeared to walk on the digits 
("tiptoes") with all limbs during ambulation and rigid extension of the carpus, 
elbow, tarsus, and knee joints during ambulation. Thickening of the fur and 
auricular cartilage, reduction in radiocarpal, and tibiotarsal joint amplitude, 
macrocephaly, and lateralized eyes were noticed on physical examination. 
Echocardiography showed reduced mobility and altered (tortuous) valve 
morphology. Bilateral abdominal cryptorchidism was confirmed by ultrasonography. 
Musladin-Lueke syndrome was the presumptive diagnosis, based on the clinical 
signs presented. The diagnosis was confirmed after DNA testing performed by 
serial collection of saliva. This is the first paper that describes 
unprecedented cardiac and reproductive changes of Musladin-Lueke syndrome in 
which the dog was followed for 2 years, presenting a good quality of life.

BACKGROUND: People with severe mental illness (SMI), such as schizophrenia, have 
higher rates of physical long-term conditions (LTCs), poorer health outcomes, 
and shorter life expectancy compared with the general population. Previous 
research exploring SMI and diabetes highlights that people with SMI experience 
barriers to self-management, a key component of care in long-term conditions; 
however, this has not been investigated in the context of other LTCs. The aim of 
this study was to explore the lived experience of co-existing SMI and LTCs for 
service users, carers, and healthcare professionals.
METHODS: A qualitative study with people with SMI and LTCs, their carers, and 
healthcare professionals, using semi-structured interviews, focused 
observations, and focus groups across the UK. Forty-one interviews and five 
focus groups were conducted between December 2018 and April 2019. Transcripts 
were coded by two authors and analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Three themes were identified, 1) the precarious nature of living with 
SMI, 2) the circularity of life with SMI and LTCs, and 3) the constellation of 
support for self-management. People with co-existing SMI and LTCs often 
experience substantial difficulties with self-management of their health due to 
the competing demands of their psychiatric symptoms and treatment, social 
circumstances, and access to support. Multiple long-term conditions add to the 
burden of self-management. Social support, alongside person-centred professional 
care, is a key facilitator for managing health. An integrated approach to both 
mental and physical healthcare was suggested to meet service user and carer 
needs.
CONCLUSION: The demands of living with SMI present a substantial barrier to 
self-management for multiple co-existing LTCs. It is important that people with 
SMI can access person-centred, tailored support for their LTCs that takes into 
consideration individual circumstances and priorities.

INTRODUCTION: Alcohol-related harm is a rising global concern particularly in 
low-income and middle-income countries where alcohol use fuels the high rates of 
violence, road traffic accidents and is a risk factor for communicable diseases 
such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Existing evidence to address alcohol-related 
harm recommends the use of intersectoral approaches, however, previous efforts 
have largely focused on addressing individual behaviour with limited attention 
to whole-of-community approaches. Whole-of-community approaches are defined as 
intersectoral interventions that are systematically coordinated and implemented 
across the whole community. The objective of this scoping review is to 
synthesise the existing literature on multisectoral, whole-of-community 
interventions which have been used to modify or prevent alcohol-related harms.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review will follow the six-step approach that 
involves; (1) identifying the research question, (2) identifying relevant 
studies, (3) selecting studies, (4) charting the data, (5) collating, 
summarising and reporting the results and (6) expert consultation. Published 
literature from 2010 to 2021 will be accessed through PubMed, Web of Science, 
CINAHL Plus and Scopus databases. Search terms will focus on the concepts of 
'interventions', 'community-based', 'harm reduction' and 'alcohol'. There will 
be no restrictions on the type of study methodology or country of origin. Title 
and abstract followed by full-text screening will be conducted by two reviewers 
to identify relevant articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Data from selected articles will be extracted and charted in Excel software. 
Findings will be analysed qualitatively and presented using the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis: Extension for Scoping 
Review.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This review makes use of published and publicly 
available data and no ethics approval is required. The results from this study 
will be disseminated via publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations 
at relevant academic research fora and conferences.
