OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness (CE) of an intensive lifestyle 
intervention (ILI) compared with standard diabetes support and education (DSE) 
in adults with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes, as implemented in the 
Action for Health in Diabetes study.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were from 4,827 participants during their 
first 9 years of study participation from 2001 to 2012. Information on Health 
Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI-2) and HUI-3, Short-Form 6D (SF-6D), and Feeling 
Thermometer (FT), cost of delivering the interventions, and health expenditures 
was collected during the study. CE was measured by incremental CE ratios (ICERs) 
in costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Future costs and QALYs were 
discounted at 3% annually. Costs were in 2012 U.S. dollars.
RESULTS: Over the 9 years studied, the mean cumulative intervention costs and 
mean cumulative health care expenditures were $11,275 and $64,453 per person for 
ILI and $887 and $68,174 for DSE. Thus, ILI cost $6,666 more per person than 
DSE. Additional QALYs gained by ILI were not statistically significant measured 
by the HUIs and were 0.07 and 0.15, respectively, measured by SF-6D and FT. The 
ICERs ranged from no health benefit with a higher cost based on HUIs to 
$96,458/QALY and $43,169/QALY, respectively, based on SF-6D and FT.
CONCLUSIONS: Whether ILI was cost-effective over the 9-year period is unclear 
because different health utility measures led to different conclusions.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be life-threatening and often 
reduces quality of life. We determined trends in life expectancy and 
health-adjusted life expectancy in people with and without IBD.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of population-level health 
administrative, demographic and health survey data available from databases in 
Ontario. We matched people with a diagnosis of IBD to those without a diagnosis 
of IBD. We used period life tables that were generated using age- and 
sex-specific 5-year mortality rates to calculate life expectancy (for 1996, 
2000, 2008 and 2011). We incorporated the Health Utility Index (National 
Population Health Study; Canadian Community Health Survey) to estimate 
health-adjusted life expectancy (for 1996, 2000 and 2008).
RESULTS: Life expectancy in patients with IBD increased between 1996 and 2011 
(females: from 75.5 to 78.4 yr, difference: 2.9 yr [95% confidence interval (CI) 
1.3 to 4.5]; males: from 72.2 to 75.5 yr, difference: 3.2 yr [95% CI 2.1 to 
4.4]). Between 1996 and 2008, health-adjusted life expectancy decreased among 
males by 3.9 years (95% CI 1.2 to 6.6). There was no statistically significant 
change in health-adjusted life expectancy among females with IBD (difference: 
2.0 yr, 95% CI -1.6 to 5.7). Life expectancy and health-adjusted life expectancy 
were lower in people with IBD compared with those without IBD. Differences in 
life expectancy in people with and without IBD ranged from 6.6 to 8.1 years in 
females and 5.0 to 6.1 years in males, depending on the year. Differences in 
health-adjusted life expectancy for people with and without IBD ranged from 9.5 
to 13.5 years in females and 2.6 to 6.7 years in males.
INTERPRETATION: Whilst life expectancy has increased among people with IBD, a 
gap in life expectancy between those with and without IBD remains, and the 
effect of pain on daily functioning contributes substantially to reduced 
health-adjusted life expectancy, suggesting that improved pain mitigation 
strategies should be implemented.

The metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor (GABABR) is a 
G protein-coupled receptor that mediates neuronal inhibition by the 
neurotransmitter GABA. While GABABR-mediated signalling has been suggested to 
play central roles in neuronal differentiation and proliferation across 
evolution, it has mostly been studied in the mammalian brain. Here, we 
demonstrate that ectopic activation of GABABR signalling affects neurogenic 
functions in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We identified four putative 
Nematostella GABABR homologues presenting conserved three-dimensional 
extracellular domains and residues needed for binding GABA and the GABABR 
agonist baclofen. Moreover, sustained activation of GABABR signalling reversibly 
arrests the critical metamorphosis transition from planktonic larva to sessile 
polyp life stage. To understand the processes that underlie the developmental 
arrest, we combined transcriptomic and spatial analyses of control and 
baclofen-treated larvae. Our findings reveal that the cnidarian neurogenic 
programme is arrested following the addition of baclofen to developing larvae. 
Specifically, neuron development and neurite extension were inhibited, resulting 
in an underdeveloped and less organized nervous system and downregulation of 
proneural factors including NvSoxB(2), NvNeuroD1 and NvElav1. Our results thus 
point to an evolutionarily conserved function of GABABR in neurogenesis 
regulation and shed light on early cnidarian development.

Excess mortality from COVID-19: weekly excess death rates by age and sex for 
Sweden and its most affected region.

Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Sweden has one of the highest numbers of COVID-19 deaths per 
inhabitant globally. However, absolute death counts can be misleading. 
Estimating age- and sex-specific mortality rates is necessary in order to 
account for the underlying population structure. Furthermore, given the 
difficulty of assigning causes of death, excess all-cause mortality should be 
estimated to assess the overall burden of the pandemic.
METHODS: By estimating weekly age- and sex-specific death rates during 2020 and 
during the preceding 5 years, our aim is to get more accurate estimates of the 
excess mortality attributed to COVID-19 in Sweden, and in the most affected 
region Stockholm.
RESULTS: Eight weeks after Sweden's first confirmed case, the death rates at all 
ages above 60 were higher than for previous years. Persons above age 80 were 
disproportionally more affected, and men suffered greater excess mortality than 
women in ages up to 75 years. At older ages, the excess mortality was similar 
for men and women, with up to 1.5 times higher death rates for Sweden and up to 
3 times higher for Stockholm. Life expectancy at age 50 declined by <1 year for 
Sweden and 1.5 years for Stockholm compared to 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The excess mortality has been high in older ages during the 
pandemic, but it remains to be answered if this is because of age itself being a 
prognostic factor or a proxy for comorbidity. Only monitoring deaths at a 
national level may hide the effect of the pandemic on the regional level.

OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims at exploring the effectiveness of nurse-led 
advanced practice for patients with cancer.
METHODS: This review followed the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. 
Randomised controlled trials on cancer nurse-led clinics for patient outcomes, 
costs, service utilisation and other outcomes were included. Databases such as 
MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsychINFO were searched based on MeSH 
terms. Thematic analysis was used to synthesise results of the included studies.
RESULTS: Seventeen articles were included, published between 2001 and 2019. 
There were methodological shortcomings with a number of the studies reviewed. 
Five themes were identified including (1) rationale for developing nurse-led 
clinics, (2) mode of delivery of nurse-led clinics, (3) the content of nurse-led 
clinics, (4) exploring patient outcomes and (5) satisfaction with nurse-led 
clinics.
CONCLUSIONS: The results support the effectiveness of nurse-led clinics in 
improving self-reported responses such as distress levels, satisfaction, quality 
of life, depressive symptoms, concerns and vomiting among cancer patients. 
Following a sound protocol for both the study and the reporting is recommended, 
and future studies should focus more on costs and effectiveness of different 
models of care administered by advanced practice nurses. Effectiveness of 
nurse-led clinics needs further evaluation with stronger trials and wider focus 
on nursing-sensitive clinical outcomes and costs.

Endoglucanase (EG) is an important component of cellulases and play an important 
role in cellulose degradation. However, its application is limited due to the 
low yield of endoglucanase from natural microorganisms. Efficient heterologous 
expression of endoglucanase is an effective way to solve this problem. To obtain 
the engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae for high-yield endoglucanase, 
endoglucanase gene was cloned from Clostridium cellulovorans, with a total 
length of 1 996 bp, encoding 440 amino acids, and the complete expression 
cassette (PαEGC) was constructed with the PGK promoter sequence from 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, α-signal peptide sequence from pPIC9K plasmid and CYC1 
terminator sequence from pSH65 plasmid by gene splicing by overlap extension PCR 
(SOE PCR), and the expression vector of endoglucanase in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae was constructed by rDNA integration. The relationship between copy 
number and protein expression was explored. Random multicopy expression of 
endoglucanase was performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The copy number of 
endoglucanase was identified by Droplet Digital PCR and explore the relationship 
between copy number and protein expression.The engineered Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae of endoglucanase with copy numbers of 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11, 15, 16, 19, 
21, 22 and 23 were obtained by rDNA integration, respectively. The results 
showed that when the copy number was 15, the enzyme activity was the highest, 
namely 351 U/mL. The engineered strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for 
endoglucanase was successfully constructed, which can provide reference for the 
heterologous expression of other industrial enzymes.

BACKGROUND: Information regarding the prognosis and burden of diseases can be 
used by policymakers to determine competing health priorities. We aimed to 
assess the Relative Survival Rate (RSR) and loss of expectation of life (LEL) to 
evaluate the prognosis and burden of diseases in Hemodialysis (HD) patients.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: We recruited 648 HD patients referred to three referral centers in 
Kerman City, Iran, from 2008 to 2019. RSR, was defined as the ratio of the 
observed and the expected survival rates of general population for persons of 
the same age and sex as patients in the current study. LEL was determined as the 
difference between corresponding life expectancies (LE). The extended Cox 
proportional hazard model was used to identify variables associated with the 
outcome.
RESULTS: Variables associated with outcome were diabetic status and age. In the 
5th year of the follow-up study, the overall RSR was 0.57. In general, for HD 
patients, the estimation of LE and LEL was 22.6 and 12.36 year, respectively.
CONCLUSION: HD patients, especially older patients, showed a very poor 
prognosis, with a large amount of lost life expectancy. Therefore, they need 
more care and attention from health authorities. It is suggested to estimate the 
cost of eliminating the risk factors causing kidney diseases.

Integration of a vertebral fracture identification service into a Fracture 
Liaison Service is possible. Almost one-fifth of computerised tomography scans 
performed identified an individual with a fracture. This increase in workload 
needs to be considered by any FLS that wants to utilise such a service.
INTRODUCTION: This service improvement project aimed to improve detection of 
incidental vertebral fractures on routine imaging. It embedded a vertebral 
fracture identification service (Optasia Medical, OM) on routine computerised 
tomography (CT) scans performed in this hospital as part of its Fracture Liaison 
Service (FLS).
METHODS: The service was integrated into the hospital's CT workstream. Scans of 
patients aged ≥ 50 years for 3 months were prospectively retrieved, alongside 
their clinical history and the CT report. Fractures were identified via OM's 
machine learning algorithm and cross-checked by the OM radiologist. Fractures 
identified were then added as an addendum to the original CT report and the 
hospital FLS informed. The FLS made recommendations based on an agreed 
algorithm.
RESULTS: In total, 4461 patients with CT scans were retrieved over the 3-month 
period of which 850 patients had vertebra fractures identified (19.1%). Only 49% 
had the fractures described on hospital radiology report. On average, 61 
patients were identified each week with a median of two fractures. Thirty-six 
percent were identified by the FLS for further action and recommendations were 
made to either primary care or the community osteoporosis team within 3 months 
of fracture detection. Of the 64% not identified for further action, almost half 
was because the CT was part of cancer assessment or treatment. The remaining 
were due to a combination of only ≤ 2 mild fractures; already known to a bone 
health specialist; in the terminal stages of any chronic illness; significant 
dependency for activities of daily living; or a life expectancy of less than 12 
months CONCLUSION: It was feasible to integrate a commercial vertebral fracture 
identification service into the daily working of a FLS. There was a significant 
increase in workload which needs to be considered by any future FLS planning to 
incorporate such a service into their clinical practice.

The paradigm for managing patients with chronic myeloid leukemia is evolving. In 
the recent past, restoring a normal life expectancy while patients are receiving 
never-ending targeted therapy with BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors through 
prevention of progression to blast phase and mitigation of iatrogenic risks was 
considered the best achievable outcome. Now, long-term treatment-free remission 
with continued response off tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is recognized as 
the most optimal benefit of treatment. Indeed, numerous independent clinical 
trials provided solid proof that tyrosine kinase inhibitor discontinuation was 
feasible in patients with deep and sustained molecular responses. This article 
discusses when tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be safely stopped in clinical 
practice on the basis of the best and latest available evidence.

OBJECTIVE: Establish the impact of pain severity on the cost-effectiveness of 
generic duloxetine for knee osteoarthritis (OA) in the United States.
DESIGN: We used a validated computer simulation of knee OA to compare usual care 
(UC) - intra-articular injections, opioids, and total knee replacement (TKR) - 
to UC preceded by duloxetine in those no longer achieving pain relief from 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Outcomes included 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime medical costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We considered cohorts with mean ages 57-75 
years and Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain 25-55 
(0-100, 100-worst). We derived inputs from published data. We discounted costs 
and benefits 3% annually. We conducted sensitivity analyses of duloxetine 
efficacy, duration of pain relief, toxicity, and costs.
RESULTS: Among younger subjects with severe pain (WOMAC pain = 55), duloxetine 
led to an additional 9.6 QALYs per 1,000 subjects (ICER = $88,500/QALY). The 
likelihood of duloxetine being cost-effective at willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
thresholds of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY was 40% and 54%. Offering 
duloxetine to older patients with severe pain led to ICERs >$150,000/QALY. 
Offering duloxetine to subjects with moderate pain (pain = 25) led to ICERs 
<$50,000/QALY, regardless of age. Among knee OA subjects with severe pain 
(pain = 55) who are unwilling or unable to undergo TKR, ICERs were 
<$50,600/QALY, regardless of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Duloxetine is a cost-effective addition to knee OA UC for subjects 
with moderate pain or those with severe pain unable or unwilling to undergo TKR. 
Among younger subjects with severe pain, duloxetine is cost-effective at WTP 
thresholds >$88,500/QALY.

INTRODUCTION: Gait velocity in spastic patients after stroke is both a life 
quality and mortality predictor. However, the precise biomechanical events that 
impair a faster velocity in this population are not defined. This study goal is 
to find out which are the gait parameters associated with a higher velocity in 
stroke patients with spastic paresis.
METHODS: The registries of a Gait analysis laboratory were retrospectively 
analyzed. The inclusion criteria were: trials of adult stroke patients with 
unilateral deficits. The exclusion criteria were: trials when patients used an 
external walking device, an orthosis, or support by a third person. Of the 116 
initial patients, after the application of the exclusion criteria, 34 patients 
were included in the cohort, all with spatiotemporal, static and dynamic 
kinematic and dynamometric studies.
RESULTS: There was a correlation of velocity with cadence, stride length of the 
paretic (P) limb, stride length, and time of the P and non-paretic (NP) limb, 
double support time, all the parameters related to hip extension during stance 
phase, knee flexion during swing phase, and parameters related to ankle 
plantarflexion during stance phase.
CONCLUSIONS: The main gait analysis outcomes that have a correlation with speed 
are related to the formula velocity = step length × cadence or are related to 
stance phase events that allow the anterior projection of the body. The only 
swing phase outcome that has a correlation with speed is knee flexion. More 
studies are needed from gait analysis laboratories in order to point out the 
most relevant goals to achieve with gait training in spastic stroke patients.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an autosomal dominant disease, is 
characterized by telangiectases and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). 
Untreated AVMs, especially in the lungs-pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs)-can result in 
morbidity with a decreased life expectancy. We have investigated whether HHT 
patients, systematically screened for HHT-related organ involvement and treated 
if needed, have a similar survival as persons without HHT. We included all 
individuals screened for HHT between 2004 and 2016 with a genetically or 
clinically confirmed diagnosis (HHT group) or excluded diagnosis (non-HHT 
control group). The social security number was used to confirm status as dead or 
alive in December 2019. We included 717 HHT patients and 471 controls. There was 
no difference in survival between the HHT and the non-HHT control group. The HHT 
group had a life expectancy of 75.9 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 
73.3-78.6), comparable to the control group (79.3 years, 95% CI 74.8-84.0, 
Mantel-Cox test: p = 0.29). In conclusion, the life expectancy of HHT patients 
systematically screened for HHT-related organ involvement and treated if needed 
in an HHT center of excellence was similar compared to their controls, 
justifying systematic screening and treatment in HHT patients.

BACKGROUND: Tools based on diagnostic prediction models are available to help 
general practitioners (GP) diagnose colorectal cancer. It is unclear how well 
they perform and whether they lead to increased or quicker diagnoses and 
ultimately impact on patient quality of life and/or survival. The aim of this 
systematic review is to evaluate the development, validation, effectiveness, and 
cost-effectiveness, of cancer diagnostic tools for colorectal cancer in primary 
care.
METHODS: Electronic databases including Medline and Web of Science were searched 
in May 2017 (updated October 2019). Two reviewers independently screened titles, 
abstracts and full-texts. Studies were included if they reported the 
development, validation or accuracy of a prediction model, or assessed the 
effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of diagnostic tools based on prediction 
models to aid GP decision-making for symptomatic patients presenting with 
features potentially indicative of colorectal cancer. Data extraction and risk 
of bias were completed by one reviewer and checked by a second. A narrative 
synthesis was conducted.
RESULTS: Eleven thousand one hundred thirteen records were screened and 23 
studies met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-studies reported on the development, 
validation and/or accuracy of 13 prediction models: eight for colorectal cancer, 
five for cancer areas/types that include colorectal cancer. The Qcancer models 
were generally the best performing. Three impact studies met the inclusion 
criteria. Two (an RCT and a pre-post study) assessed tools based on the RAT 
prediction model. The third study looked at the impact of GP practices having 
access to RAT or Qcancer. Although the pre-post study reported a positive impact 
of the tools on outcomes, the results of the RCT and cross-sectional survey 
found no evidence that use of, or access to, the tools was associated with 
better outcomes. No study evaluated cost effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Many prediction models have been developed but none have been fully 
validated. Evidence demonstrating improved patient outcome of introducing the 
tools is the main deficiency and is essential given the imperfect classification 
achieved by all tools. This need is emphasised by the equivocal results of the 
small number of impact studies done so far.

Animal-derived dietary protein ingestion and physical activity stimulate 
myofibrillar protein synthesis rates in older adults. We determined whether a 
non-animal-derived diet can support daily myofibrillar protein synthesis rates 
to the same extent as an omnivorous diet. Nineteen healthy older adults (aged 66 
(sem 1) years; BMI 24 (sem 1) kg/m2; twelve males, seven females) participated 
in a randomised, parallel-group, controlled trial during which they consumed a 
3-d isoenergetic high-protein (1·8 g/kg body mass per d) diet, where the protein 
was provided from predominantly (71 %) animal (OMNI; n 9; six males, three 
females) or exclusively vegan (VEG; n 10; six males, four females; mycoprotein 
providing 57 % of daily protein intake) sources. During the dietary control 
period, participants conducted a daily bout of unilateral resistance-type leg 
extension exercise. Before the dietary control period, participants ingested 400 
ml of deuterated water, with 50-ml doses consumed daily thereafter. Saliva 
samples were collected throughout to determine body water 2H enrichments, and 
muscle samples were collected from rested and exercised muscle to determine 
daily myofibrillar protein synthesis rates. Deuterated water dosing resulted in 
body water 2H enrichments of approximately 0·78 (sem 0·03) %. Daily myofibrillar 
protein synthesis rates were 13 (sem 8) (P = 0·169) and 12 (sem 4) % (P = 0·016) 
greater in the exercised compared with rested leg (1·59 (sem 0·12) v. 1·77 (sem 
0·12) and 1·76 (sem 0·14) v. 1·93 (sem 0·12) %/d) in OMNI and VEG groups, 
respectively. Daily myofibrillar protein synthesis rates did not differ between 
OMNI and VEG in either rested or exercised muscle (P > 0·05). Over the course of 
a 3-d intervention, omnivorous- or vegan-derived dietary protein sources can 
support equivalent rested and exercised daily myofibrillar protein synthesis 
rates in healthy older adults consuming a high-protein diet.

OBJECTIVE: To present a summary of the 2020 version of the European Association 
of Urology (EAU)-European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM)-European 
Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO)-European Society of Urogenital 
Radiology (ESUR)-International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) guidelines 
on screening, diagnosis, and local treatment of clinically localised prostate 
cancer (PCa).
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The panel performed a literature review of new data, 
covering the time frame between 2016 and 2020. The guidelines were updated and a 
strength rating for each recommendation was added based on a systematic review 
of the evidence.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A risk-adapted strategy for identifying men who may develop 
PCa is advised, generally commencing at 50 yr of age and based on individualised 
life expectancy. Risk-adapted screening should be offered to men at increased 
risk from the age of 45 yr and to breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) 
mutation carriers, who have been confirmed to be at risk of early and aggressive 
disease (mainly BRAC2), from around 40 yr of age. The use of multiparametric 
magnetic resonance imaging in order to avoid unnecessary biopsies is 
recommended. When a biopsy is performed, a combination of targeted and 
systematic biopsies must be offered. There is currently no place for the routine 
use of tissue-based biomarkers. Whilst prostate-specific membrane antigen 
positron emission tomography computed tomography is the most sensitive staging 
procedure, the lack of outcome benefit remains a major limitation. Active 
surveillance (AS) should always be discussed with low-risk patients, as well as 
with selected intermediate-risk patients with favourable International Society 
of Urological Pathology (ISUP) 2 lesions. Local therapies are addressed, as well 
as the AS journey and the management of persistent prostate-specific antigen 
after surgery. A strong recommendation to consider moderate hypofractionation in 
intermediate-risk patients is provided. Patients with cN1 PCa should be offered 
a local treatment combined with long-term hormonal treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence in the field of diagnosis, staging, and treatment of 
localised PCa is evolving rapidly. The 2020 EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-SIOG guidelines 
on PCa summarise the most recent findings and advice for their use in clinical 
practice. These PCa guidelines reflect the multidisciplinary nature of PCa 
management.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Updated prostate cancer guidelines are presented, addressing 
screening, diagnosis, and local treatment with curative intent. These guidelines 
rely on the available scientific evidence, and new insights will need to be 
considered and included on a regular basis. In some cases, the supporting 
evidence for new treatment options is not yet strong enough to provide a 
recommendation, which is why continuous updating is important. Patients must be 
fully informed of all relevant options and, together with their treating 
physicians, decide on the most optimal management for them.

In recent years considerable improvements have been made in increasing the life 
expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis. New highly effective modulator 
therapies targeting the underlying defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator protein are expected to enhance lifespan even further. 
However, chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infections continue to 
threaten CF patient lung health and mortality rates. Early and aggressive 
antibiotic eradication therapies targeting P. aeruginosa are standard practice, 
but these eradication therapies fail in 10-40% of patients. The reasons for P. 
aeruginosa eradication failure remain unclear. Thus, this review summarizes the 
evidence to date for pseudomonal acquisition and eradication failure in the 
cystic fibrosis lung. A complex combination of host and bacterial factors are 
responsible for initial establishment of P. aeruginosa pulmonary infections. 
Moreover, host and pseudomonal factors, polymicrobial interactions, and 
antimicrobial limitations in relation to P. aeruginosa eradication therapy 
failure are summarized.

BACKGROUND: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a time-sensitive emergency procedure 
for patients who had ischaemic stroke leading to improved health outcomes. 
Health systems need to ensure that MT is delivered to as many patients as 
quickly as possible. Using decision modelling, we aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of secondary transfer by helicopter emergency medical 
services (HEMS) compared with ground emergency medical services (GEMS) of rural 
patients eligible for MT in England.
METHODS: The model consisted of (1) a short-run decision tree with two branches, 
representing secondary transfer transportation strategies and (2) a long-run 
Markov model for a theoretical population of rural patients with a confirmed 
ischaemic stroke. Strategies were compared by lifetime costs: quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs), incremental cost per QALY gained and net monetary benefit. 
Sensitivity and scenario analyses explored uncertainty around parameter values.
RESULTS: We used the base case of early-presenting (<6 hours to arterial 
puncture) patient aged 75 years who had stroke to compare HEMS and GEMS. This 
produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £28 027 when a 60 min 
reduction in travel time was assumed. Scenario analyses showed the importance of 
the reduction in travel time and futile transfers in lowering ICERs. For late 
presenting (>6 hours to arterial puncture), ground transportation is the 
dominant strategy.
CONCLUSION: Our model indicates that using HEMS to transfer patients who had 
stroke eligible for MT from remote hospitals in England may be cost-effective 
when: travel time is reduced by at least 60 min compared with GEMS, and a 
£30 000/QALY threshold is used for decision-making. However, several other 
logistic considerations may impact on the use of air transportation.
