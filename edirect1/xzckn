expectancy of the general popula-tion. HIV is now a chronic treatable disease 
and requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes both the hospital 
medicine specialties and primary care physicians. The fragmented model to 
provide social and medical healthcare hinders the proper management of patients 
with HIV infection. There is significant clinical and geographical variability 
in the healthcare provided for HIV infection in Spain and the need to define and 
implement new models of healthcare delivery for this disease has been 
identified.

Thanks to advances in antiretroviral therapy, the life expectancy of people 
infected with HIV is approaching that of the general population. In this new 
clinical scenario, comorbidities related to age and geriatric syn-dromes are 
gaining prominence. The experiences from various innovative initiatives for the 
care of patients with chronic diseases indicate that the optimisation of health 
outcomes not only depends on proper diagnosis and treatment, but also on the way 
in which care is managed. To cover the future needs of HIV-infected patients, we 
will have to implement care models that have proven effective in other types of 
chronic di-seases. This will require a reliable method to stratify patients 
according to their level of complexity or functional capacity to detect the most 
vulnerable cases.

OBJECTIVES: In shared decision making it is important to adequately, timely and 
actively involve patients in treatment decisions. Sharing prognostic information 
can be of key importance. This study describes whether and how prognostic 
information on life expectancy is included during communication on diagnosis and 
treatment plans between physicians and head and neck (H&N) oncologic patients in 
different phases of disease.
METHODS: A descriptive, qualitative study was performed of n = 23 audiotaped 
physician-patient conversations in which both palliative and curative treatment 
options were discussed and questions on prognosis were expected. Verbatim 
transcribed consultations were systematically analyzed. A distinction was made 
between prognostic information that was provided (a) quantitatively: by giving 
numerical probability estimates, such as percentages or years or (b) 
qualitatively: through the use of words such as 'most likely' or 'highly 
improbable'.
RESULTS: In all consultations, H&N surgeons provided some prognostic 
information. In 5.9% of the provided prognostic information, a quantitative 
method was used. In 94.1% prognostic information was provided qualitatively, 
using six identified approaches. H&N surgeons possibly affect patients' 
perception of prognostic content with two identified communication styles: 
directive (more physician-centered) and affective (more patient-centered).
CONCLUSION: This study is first in providing examples of how H&N surgeons 
communicate with their patients regarding prognosis in all stages of disease. 
They often exclude specific prognostic information. The study outcomes can be 
used as a first step in developing a guideline for sharing prognostic 
information in H&N oncologic patients, in order enable the process of shared 
decision making.

Menopause is an age-dependent physiological condition associated with a natural 
decline in oestrogen levels, which causes a progressive decrease of muscle mass 
and strength and bone density. Sarcopenia and osteoporosis often coexist in 
elderly people, with a prevalence of the latter in elderly women. The profound 
interaction between muscle and bone induces a negative resonance between the two 
tissues affected by these disorders worsening the quality of life in the 
postmenopausal period. It has been estimated that at least 1 in 3 women over age 
50 will experience osteoporotic fractures, often requiring hospitalisation and 
long-term care, causing a large financial burden to health insurance systems. 
Hormonal replacement therapy is effective in osteoporosis prevention, but 
concerns have been raised with regard to its safety. On the whole, the increase 
in life expectancy for postmenopausal women along with the need to improve their 
quality of life makes it necessary to develop specific and safe therapeutic 
strategies, alternative to hormonal replacement therapy, targeting both 
sarcopenia and osteoporosis progression. This review will examine the rationale 
and the effects of dietary protein, vitamin D and calcium supplementation 
combined with a specifically-designed exercise training prescription as a 
strategy to counteract these postmenopausal-associated disorders.

BACKGROUND: Skeletal metastases are a common problem in patients with cancer, 
and surgical decision making depends on multiple factors including life 
expectancy. Identification of new prognostic factors can improve survival 
estimation and guide healthcare providers in surgical decision making. In this 
study, we aim to determine the prognostic value of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio 
(NLR) and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in patients with bone metastasis.
METHODS: One thousand and twelve patients from two tertiary referral centers 
between 2002 and 2014 met the inclusion criteria. Bivariate and multivariate Cox 
regression analyses were performed to determine the association of NLR and PLR 
with survival.
RESULTS: At 3 months, 84.0% of the patients with low NLR were alive versus 61.3% 
of the patients with a high NLR (p < 0.001), and 75.8% of the patients with a 
low PLR were alive versus 55.6% of the patients with a high PLR (p < 0.001). 
Both elevated NLR and elevated PLR were independently associated with worse 
survival (hazard ratio (HR): 1.311; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.117-1.538; 
p = 0.001) and (HR: 1.358; 95% CI: 1.152-1.601; p < 0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study showed both NLR and PLR to be independently associated 
with survival in patients who were treated for skeletal metastasis.

PURPOSE: To assess the cost-utility of the photovaporization of the prostate 
(PVP) with GreenLight™ laser 180 W XPS compared to transurethral resection of 
the prostate with monopolar energy (M-TURP) for lower urinary tract symptoms 
(LUTS) due to benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) from a healthcare perspective 
in Colombia.
METHODS: We designed a Markov model to compare four health states following 
treatment with either PVP or M-TURP to estimate expected costs and outcomes. We 
used the results of the only randomized clinical trial published to date 
comparing PVP versus M-TURP to estimate surgical outcomes, complications, 
re-operation and re-intervention rates. Time horizon was defined at 2 years with 
four cycles of 6 months each. Resource-use estimation involved a random 
selection of clinical records from a local institution and cost list from public 
healthcare system. Costs were obtained in Colombian pesos and converted to US 
dollars. Threshold was defined at three-times the Colombian gross domestic 
product (GDP) per capita. Quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) were used based on 
the utilities of the available literature. Uncertainty was analyzed with 
deterministic and probabilistic models using a Monte Carlo simulation.
RESULTS: Patients who underwent PVP gained 1.81 QALYs compared to 1.59 with 
M-TURP. Costs were US$6797.98 and US$7777.59 for M-TURP and PVP, respectively. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$4452.81 per QALY, favoring PVP as a 
cost-effective alternative in our context.
CONCLUSIONS: In Colombia, with current prices, PVP is cost-effective when 
compared to M-TURP for LUTS due to BPE for a 2-year time horizon.

Increasing device implantations, patient comorbidities, and longer life 
expectancy contribute to an increased need for lead extraction. Even if 
transvenous lead extraction (TLE) is a highly successful procedure, some serious 
procedural complications are reported. In order to identify those patients who 
are at higher risk, risk stratification scores were proposed. Areas covered: The 
major obstacles to lead extractions are represented by the body's response to 
the foreign implanted material and by the following development of fibrotic 
reaction between the lead and the vascular system. Several clinical factors and 
device features are associated with major complications and worse outcomes. 
Although different multiparametric scores predicting the safety and the efficacy 
of TLE procedures were reported, none of these scores were prospective 
evaluated. Expert commentary: A correct risk stratification is needed in order 
to refer complex patients to centers with proven experience and avoid futile 
procedures. Furthermore, the identification of high-risk patients allows to 
perform the extraction procedure in the operating room instead of 
electrophysiology lab. Albeit some risk scores able to predict adverse event in 
cardiac lead extraction were described, there are still several limitations to 
their use and reproducibility.

Before antibiotics, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and life-sustaining 
technologies, humans had little choice about the timing and manner of their 
deaths. Today, the medicalization of death has enabled patients to delay death, 
prolonging their living and dying. New technology, the influence of the media, 
and medical professionals themselves have together transformed dying from a 
natural part of the human experience into a medical crisis from which a patient 
must be rescued, often through the aggressive extension of life or through its 
premature termination. In this paper, we examine problematic forms of rescue 
medicine and suggest the need to rethink medicalized dying within the context of 
medicine's orientation to health and wholeness.

"What next now that you are sixty?" - Preliminary exploration of the 
self-reported aspirations of community-dwelling older persons in the Western 
Cape Province, South Africa within the active aging framework.

Future aspirations of older persons should interest professionals involved in 
health promotion services in view of World Health Organization's Active Aging 
Framework. With the South African government's plan to raise life expectancy to 
70 years by 2030, there is likelihood that life expectancy at 60 years will 
increase. Future aspirations give motivations for living, with short and 
long-term goals to work toward. As part of a larger study exploring the profile 
of members of 35 Service Centers for Older Persons in the Western Cape Province, 
selected using stratified random sampling, this manuscript reports on the 
qualitative responses relating to the self-determined future aspirations of the 
members. Thematic analysis was utilized to explore the aspirations of 625 
members, aged 60-100 years. The aspirations were classified into two, namely 
aspirations with and without possible future-oriented behavior. Separate six and 
three themes were identified respectively in the first and second categories of 
aspirations. Being members of centers meant to provide programs to enhance their 
future, an awareness of the future aspirations of older persons should inform 
the services provided to encourage older persons identify something to live for.

About 15% of human cancers counteract telomere loss by alternative lengthening 
of telomeres (ALT), which is attributed to homologous recombination 
(HR)-mediated events. But how telomeric HR leads to length elongation is poorly 
understood. Here, we explore telomere clustering and telomeric HR induced by 
double-stranded breaks (DSBs). We show that telomere clustering could occur at 
G1 and S phase of cell cycle and that three types of telomeric HR occur based on 
the manner of telomeric DNA exchange: equivalent telomeric sister chromatin 
exchange (T-SCE), inequivalent T-SCE, and No-SCE. While inequivalent T-SCE 
increases telomere length heterogeneity with no net gain of telomere length, 
No-SCE, which is presumably induced by interchromatid HR and/or break-induced 
replication, results in telomere elongation. Accordingly, cells subjected to 
long-term telomeric DSBs display increased heterogeneity of length and longer 
telomeres. We also demonstrate that DSBs-induced telomere elongation is 
telomerase independent. Moreover, telomeric recombination induced by DSBs is 
associated with formation of ALT-associated PML body and C-circle. Thus, DNA 
damage triggers recombination mediated elongation, leading to the induction of 
multiple ALT phenotypes.

BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular diseases in childhood, adolescence and adulthood are 
rare or very rare diseases and for many of them the prevalence and incidence are 
unknown. Causal therapies are currently used for individual disease entities 
only. Nevertheless, new genetic methods, a better understanding of the 
pathophysiology and multidisciplinary treatment concepts help to improve patient 
life expectancy and quality of life. As a result, more and more patients with an 
early disease onset reach adulthood and further care in adult medicine is 
necessary. This imposes new challenges particularly on neurology and the 
requirements for interdisciplinary cooperation in adult medicine are increased.
OBJECTIVE: How can transition be made meaningful? Where do structural and 
content problems stand out?
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Using the example of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the 
content and structural requirements for transition are presented and important 
aspects and possible problems are pointed out.
CONCLUSION: The transition process is complex and requires time and personnel 
resources. If carried out sensibly, it can lead to a better and more efficient 
care of patients in the long term and thus can also become economically more 
effective.

BACKGROUND: Osteogenic sarcoma of the skull is uncommon and long-term outcome is 
not well defined. We review the literature and present a pediatric case of 
calvarial osteogenic sarcoma with good long-term oncological and cosmetic 
outcome and excellent quality of life. This case presented major surgical 
challenges, which are detailed.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 6-year-old boy presented with a painless 5 cm × 5 cm lump 
over the vertex region. He was neurologically normal. Imaging showed an 
extensive bony lesion with intradural extension. After incisional biopsy showed 
probable low grade osteosarcoma, a complete en bloc resection with margins was 
attempted via a concentric craniotomy around the lesion after embolization to 
reduce blood loss. Invasion of the brain by the tumor precluded the complete en 
bloc resection, but gross total resection was achieved. The final pathology was 
consistent with a low-grade osteosarcoma and adjuvant chemotherapy was provided. 
Follow-up for 8 years has shown no recurrence with good cosmetic and functional 
outcome.

Poultry are important for many poor households in developing countries, but 
there are many constraints to poultry production, including disease. One of the 
most important diseases of chickens is Newcastle disease (ND). Even though there 
are effective vaccines against this disease available in most countries, uptake 
by small-scale poultry keepers is often low. In this study, two areas in Kenya 
and Tanzania were studied, where some villages had received additional support 
to get vaccination and other villages had not. In Kenya, 320 households from 10 
villages were interviewed, of which half of the villages had active promotion of 
vaccination through village-based advisors. In Tanzania, 457 households were 
interviewed, of which 241 came from villages that have had active support 
through either a project or government extension services. Knowledge about 
vaccines and the attitudes towards vaccinating against ND was evaluated using 
mixed multivariable logistic models. Results indicate that in Kenya, the most 
important determinants for understanding the function of a vaccine were having 
had support in the village and to have knowledge about ND signs, while in 
Tanzania gender and previous vaccine use were important in addition to having 
had support. Attitudes towards vaccination were mainly determined by knowledge, 
where more knowledge about how vaccines work in general or about ND contributed 
to more positive attitudes. Among Kenyan farmers that had never used the vaccine 
before, the amount of birds they lost to disease and predators also influenced 
attitudes. In conclusion, this study supports the notion that knowledge is a 
very important component of extension support and that simply making vaccines 
available may not be sufficient for high levels of uptake.

Acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is an uncommon cause of acute hospital 
admission with high mortality rates (50-90%) that requires early diagnosis and 
treatment. With the increase in average life expectancy, AMI represents one of 
the most threatening abdominal conditions in elderly patients. Untreated, AMI 
will cause mesenteric infarction, intestinal necrosis, an overwhelming 
inflammatory response and death. Early intervention can reverse this process 
leading to a full recovery, but the diagnosis of AMI is difficult. The failure 
to recognise AMI before intestinal necrosis has developed is responsible for the 
high mortality of the disease. Unfortunately, common CT findings in bowel 
ischaemia are not specific. Therefore, it is often a combination of nonspecific 
clinical, laboratory and radiological findings that helps most in the correct 
interpretation of CT findings. The purpose of this article is to provide an 
overview of the anatomy, physiology of mesenteric perfusion and discussions of 
causes, pathogenesis and CT findings in various types of acute bowel ischaemia. 
Familiarity with various imaging features of mesenteric injury is essential to 
make a timely diagnosis that will lead to improved patient outcomes. TEACHING 
POINTS: • AMI is a potentially life-threatening disorder whose prognosis depends 
on early recognition, accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. • Arterial 
inflow occlusion due to thrombosis or embolisation is the most common cause of 
AMI. • Four aetiological types of AMI have been associated with different 
characteristics and risk factors (EAMI, TAMI, VAMI and NOMI). • Physical 
examination and laboratory findings are not sensitive or specific for diagnosing 
AMI; therefore, MDCT is still the first-line imaging method in suspected AMI. • 
Although a number of scoring systems for prognosis have been proposed, these 
have not been validated in large-scale studies.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare pericranial tenderness of 
females with episodic cervical headache vs matched asymptomatic controls.
METHODS: Through a single-blind, cross-sectional study, pericranial tenderness 
was compared between 20 females with episodic cervical headaches (29.4 ± 13.2 
years) and 20 age-matched female asymptomatic controls (30.1 ± 13.7 years). 
Pericranial tenderness was bilaterally measured in a headache-free period with 
the "total tenderness score" (TTS) in the suboccipital, temporal, frontal, 
masseter, upper trapezius (UT), levator scapula, and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) 
muscle insertions. Passive cervical mobility, headache intensity, frequency, and 
duration were secondary outcomes. Analysis was done with a 95% confidence level 
(SPSS version 22). The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare pericranial, 
cephalic, cervical, and muscle-specific tenderness between groups. Correlations 
between passive cervical mobility and headache characteristics and the TTS were 
estimated with Spearman's ρ.
RESULTS: The headache group (1.25 ± 0.89) showed a 2 times higher (P < .05) 
pericranial TTS compared to the control group (0.62 ± 0.70). Higher (P < .05) 
scores were observed for the left suboccipital, temporal, masseter, UT, levator 
scapula, and SCM muscles and the right suboccipital, frontal, UT, and levator 
scapula muscles. Grouping the tenderness scores into cervical (suboccipital, UT, 
levator scapula, SCM) and cephalic (frontal, temporal, masseter) regions 
revealed greater scores (P < .05) in the headache group. In the latter, the TTS 
was significantly positively correlated with passive cervical extension (ρ = 
0.78).
CONCLUSION: Consistent higher tenderness scores were observed and suggest 
involvement of sensitization in patients with episodic cervical headaches. A 
positive correlation was seen between passive cervical extension and 
sensitivity.

To determine the priority hazard in drinking water, disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) method was used to evaluate the disease burden induced by 
trihalomethanes (THMs) and low-level arsenic through multiple exposure routes 
based on the two-year sampling from drinking water in Xi'an city, Northwest 
China. The average concentrations of chloroform (TCM), bromodichloromethane 
(BDCM), dibromochloromethane (DBCM), bromoform (TBM) and arsenic were 
12.67 μg/L, 1.42 μg/L, 0.60 μg/L, 0.13 μg/L and 1.00 μg/L, respectively, and the 
total lifetime cancer risks for all THMs and arsenic were 8.54 × 10-6 and 
4.02 × 10-5, which were 8.54 and 40.2 times of the negligible risk level 
(1.00 × 10-6), respectively. The DALYs estimation showed that the total DALYs 
lost for all age groups was 32.62 person-year, and the average individual DALYs 
lost was 4.77 × 10-6 per person-year (ppy), which was 4.77 times of the 
reference level (1.00 × 10-6 ppy). About 72.07% of the total disease burden was 
due to arsenic, which was considered to be the priority hazard in Xi'an drinking 
water. The age group of 75-80 years was found to be most vulnerable to the 
induced cancer risk, and skin cancer had the highest disease burden (2.24 × 10-6 
ppy). Due to the relatively high incidence rates of lung cancer and skin cancer, 
most DALYs lost for males were 2-4 times to that for females in the same age 
group. Oral ingestion made the most contribution (88.58%) to the total disease 
burden, followed by inhalation of THMs (11.30%), whereas dermal absorption 
showed negligible risk (0.12%). As the first to compare the cancer risks of 
arsenic and THMs to the public in DALYs in China, this study might be useful for 
potential strategies of risk control and management of hazardous agents in 
drinking water.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine how social development influenced life 
expectancy from a spatio-temporal perspective.
STUDY DESIGN: Data were taken from the China Statistical Yearbooks for 2001 and 
2011, which presented results from 2000 to 2010, respectively.
METHODS: A geographically weighted regression method was performed. A total of 
31 provinces were treated as units of our analysis, and four social development 
dimensions were extracted by exploratory factor analysis.
RESULTS: Generally speaking, healthcare and education development could 
significantly improve life expectancy. Between 2000 and 2010, the positive 
effects of social harmony and eco-environment development were gradually 
increasing. Spatially speaking, the enhancing effect of healthcare development 
on life expectancy generally declined from south to north China; the improving 
effect of education development generally declined from southwest China to 
northeast and northwest China. The geographical distributions of the effects of 
eco-environment and social harmony development on life expectancy were different 
between 2000 and 2010; the former declined from the eastern coast to west China 
in 2000 and declined from northwest to south China in 2010, while the latter 
first declined from north to southwest China in 2000 and then declined from 
southwest to northeast China in 2010.
CONCLUSIONS: Because the effects of various social development dimensions on 
life expectancy vary with time and space, it is necessary to improve certain 
aspects of social development in specific areas and social stages to efficiently 
improve life expectancy and population health.

BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression negatively affects the whole family and its 
prevalence in Sweden ranges between 6-10% for fathers and 13-16% for mothers. 
However, only mothers in Sweden are currently routinely screened.
AIM: The aim of this study was to determine if a postpartum depression screening 
for fathers in Stockholm County could be cost-effective.
METHODS: National Swedish databases were used to find registry data and a 
literature review was undertaken to identify the model data inputs associated 
with postpartum depression in Sweden. The generated evidence was used to build a 
Markov model in TreeAge. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed to account for parameter uncertainties. Alternative scenario analyses 
were further undertaken to test the assumptions in the base case analysis.
RESULTS: A postpartum screening for depression in fathers is cost-effective in 
base case and alternative scenarios. The results indicate that the screening 
program is associated with lower costs and higher health effects. The results 
were sensitive to variables of quality adjusted life years for the depressed 
fathers, probabilities of remission in treatment and no treatment groups and 
start age and productivity losses. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
resulted in a 70% probability of the postnatal depression screening intervention 
being cost-effective.
LIMITATIONS: The current study only uses secondary data; therefore future 
research should assess the cost-effectiveness of screening fathers for 
depression.
CONCLUSION: The postpartum screening intervention for fathers could be 
cost-effective compared to no screening. Future research should replicate the 
potential cost-effectiveness for screening fathers for postpartum depression.

PURPOSE: Acute leukemia (AL) and its initial treatment can impair physical 
functioning and capacity significantly. Exercise as a countermeasure has been 
investigated in few studies confirming its feasibility and safety during 
intensive induction chemotherapy, but the relative effects of diverse exercise 
programs have not been analyzed. Therefore, we aimed to investigate independent 
effects of endurance and resistance training on physical capacity and quality of 
life (QOL).
METHODS: Twenty-nine adult AL patients were randomly allocated to an endurance 
(EG), resistance (RG), or control (CG) group. The intervention took place during 
induction chemotherapy with three exercise sessions per week for 30-45 min each. 
Endurance capacity at individual anaerobic threshold, maximum knee extension and 
flexion strength, standardized phase angle (SPA), and QOL were measured at 
baseline prior to induction chemotherapy and before discharge.
RESULTS: Endurance capacity changed in neither the EG, RG, or CG (P = 0.104); 
descriptively, the EG (- 0.05 W/kg) and RG (- 0.04 W/kg) exhibited a smaller 
decrease than CG (- 0.22 W/kg). We noted a significant difference in knee 
extension strength (P = 0.002); RG improved their maximum strength 
(+ 0.14 Nm/kg), while the EG's (- 0.13 Nm/kg) and CG's (- 0.19 Nm/kg) was 
significantly reduced. QOL and SPA revealed no change after the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that resistance training is a key component when 
exercising during induction chemotherapy: it improved maximum strength, but also 
influenced endurance capacity even during intensive treatment. Considering the 
prognostic value of physical function, we strongly propose integrating exercise, 
especially resistance-based training, already during induction chemotherapy to 
preserve AL patients' physical capacity and functional status.

AIMS: This paper investigates the distributional implications for eight 
population groups of using six different instruments to measure wellbeing and to 
prioritise access to health services. Specifically, it examines the importance 
of different physical and psycho-social problems for the scores obtained using 
each instrument and whether scores differ because of differences in the concept 
measured by the instrument or because of the instrument's construction.
METHODS: Patients with seven chronic conditions and a sample of the 'healthy' 
public were administered six instruments: two utility instruments; two 
self-rating scales; a subjective wellbeing instrument and the ICECAP measure of 
capability. Scores were regressed upon the subscales of the SF-36 and the 
AQoL-8D. Each instrument's 'problem mix' was measured by the numerical 
importance of the subscales for the instrument's score and compared with the 
problem mix of patients constructed from all of the instruments.
RESULTS: The apparent importance of different problems varied significantly with 
the instrument used to assess welfare but not with the chronic conditions. The 
correspondence between an instrument's problem mix and the patients' problem mix 
was highly variable.
CONCLUSION: Different instruments give prominence to different physical and 
psycho-social problems and consequently favour different groups of patients. 
Budgetary decisions which appear to be based on efficiency criteria such as the 
cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) conceal distributive effects 
attributable to the instrument used in the analysis. The effects are additional 
to the ethical questions considered in making an equity-efficiency trade-off as 
they arise from the measurement of efficiency.

INTRODUCTION: A previous study found that the Food and Drug Administration's The 
Real Cost national tobacco education campaign was associated with preventing 
approximately 350,000 U.S. youth from initiating smoking between 2014 and 2016. 
This study translates the reduction in smoking initiation into monetary terms by 
examining the cost effectiveness of the campaign.
METHODS: The cost effectiveness of The Real Cost was assessed by measuring 
efficiency in two ways: (1) estimating the cost per quality-adjusted life year 
saved and (2) estimating the total monetary return on investment by comparing 
the cost savings associated with the campaign to campaign expenditures. Analyses 
were conducted in 2017.
RESULTS: The Real Cost averted an estimated 175,941 youth from becoming 
established smokers between 2014 and 2016. Campaign expenditures totaled 
$246,915,233. The cost per quality-adjusted life year saved of the campaign was 
$1,337. When considering the costs of smoking, the averted established smokers 
represent >$31 billion in cost savings ($1.3 billion when only external costs 
considered). The overall return on investment of the campaign was $128 in cost 
savings for every $1 spent ($4 for every $1 spent when only external costs 
considered). These conclusions were robust to sensitivity analyses surrounding 
the parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Campaign expenditures were cost efficient. The cost savings 
resulting from The Real Cost represent a large reduction in the financial burden 
to individuals, their families, and society as a result of tobacco. Public 
health campaigns, like The Real Cost, that reduce tobacco-related morbidity and 
mortality for a generation of U.S. youth also provide substantial cost savings.

Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

BACKGROUND: This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of patellar resurfacing 
in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytic 
model representing a hypothetical TKA cohort, with or without patellar 
resurfacing, using data from the 2014 Australian Registry. The model represents 
3 possible postoperative health states: (1) well, (2) patellofemoral pain, or 
(3) serious adverse event (any event resulting in a revision). Our effectiveness 
outcome was the quality-adjusted life year, from published utility scores. We 
estimated cost-effectiveness from a Canadian public healthcare payer 
perspective. Costs and quality of life were valued in 2015 United States dollars 
and discounted annually at 5%.
RESULTS: Our results suggest that TKA with resurfacing is cost-effective 
compared to nonresurfacing. Unresurfacing the patellae resulted in higher costs 
($13,296.63 vs $12,917.01) and lower quality-adjusted life year (5.37 vs 6.01) 
at 14 years. Sensitivity analysis suggests that if rates of secondary 
resurfacing are <0.5%, there was no cost difference.
CONCLUSION: Over 14 years postoperative, patellar resurfacing appears to be 
cost-effective, due to higher revision rates for unresurfaced TKA. Although our 
results suggest resurfacing improves quality of life, our model is limited by 
the availability and validity of long-term utility outcomes reported for TKA. 
Our cost-effectiveness analysis showed superiority of the resurfacing compared 
to retention of the patella.
